# Healthcare RAG Assistant – Progress Update

**Situation:** Building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for medical question answering using research papers on Alzheimer's Disease.

**Task:** Integrate FAISS vector database with Google Gemini LLM to enable contextual question answering over preprocessed medical literature.

**Action Taken So Far:**  
- Processed research papers and created embeddings using Gemini text-embedding-004 model.  
- Built FAISS vector database and stored associated metadata.  
- Developed a Python pipeline to take user queries, retrieve top-k relevant contexts, and generate answers using Gemini 2.5 Flash.  
- Implemented error handling for missing API keys, missing embeddings, and indexing issues.  
- Tested the pipeline successfully on example queries like "What causes headache?" and "Which diseases are similar to Alzheimer's Disease?".

**Result / Outcome:**  
- System retrieves relevant literature-based context and answers questions with high accuracy for Alzheimer’s Disease.  
- Ready for expansion to additional neurological disorders.  

**Next Steps:**  
- Extend dataset to include other neurological diseases beyond Alzheimer’s.  
- Improve embeddings and context retrieval for more comprehensive answers.  
- Fine-tune response generation for clarity and medical accuracy.
