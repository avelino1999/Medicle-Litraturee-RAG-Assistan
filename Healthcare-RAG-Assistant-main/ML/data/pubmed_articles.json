    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a formidable challenge in modern healthcare, necessitating innovative approaches for its early detection and intervention. This study aimed to enhance the identification of individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at risk of developing AD. Leveraging advances in computational power and the extensive availability of healthcare data, we explored the potential of deep learning models for early prediction using medical claims data. We employed a bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU) deep learning model for predictive modeling of MCI progression across various prediction intervals, extending up to five years post-initial MCI diagnosis. The performance of the BiGRU model was rigorously compared with several machine-learning model baselines to evaluate its efficacy. Using a robust cross-validation methodology, the BiGRU emerged as the top-performing model, achieving an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.833 (95% CI: 0.822, 0.843), an Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUC-PR) of 0.856 (95% CI: 0.845, 0.867), and an F1-Score of 0.71 (95% CI: 0.694, 0.724) for a five-year prediction interval. The results indicate that BiGRU, utilizing longitudinal claims data, reliably predicts MCI-to-AD progression over a lengthy interval following the initial MCI diagnosis, offering clinicians a valuable tool for targeted risk identification and stratification."

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline and memory loss, with few effective treatments currently available. The multifactorial nature of AD, shaped by genetic, environmental, and biological factors, complicates both research and clinical management. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and multi-omics technologies provide new opportunities to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of AD and identify early biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis. AI-driven approaches such as machine learning, deep learning, and network-based models have enabled the integration of large-scale genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and microbiomic datasets. These efforts have facilitated the discovery of novel molecular signatures and therapeutic targets. Methods including deep belief networks and joint deep semi-non-negative matrix factorization have contributed to improvements in disease classification and patient stratification. However, ongoing challenges remain. These include data heterogeneity, limited interpretability of complex models, a lack of large and diverse datasets, and insufficient clinical validation. The absence of standardized multi-omics data processing methods further restricts progress. This review systematically summarizes recent advances in AI-driven multi-omics research in AD, highlighting achievements in early diagnosis and biomarker discovery while discussing limitations and future directions needed to advance these approaches toward clinical application."

Here, we developed a radiomics-based machine learning (ML) approach to enhance neuroimaging assessments in distinguishing Alzheimer's disease (AD) from other imaging-evident dementias (OIED). We retrospectively analyzed 1041 individuals from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center with confirmed dementia diagnoses and at least one T1 or T2/FLAIR MRI scan. Using FastSurfer and a Lesion Prediction Algorithm, we extracted volumetric and lesion features, which were then used to train ML models. Model performance was compared to the independent evaluations of seven fellowship-trained neuroradiologists. The classifier achieved an AUROC of 0.79 ± 0.01 for AD and 0.66 ± 0.03 for OIED, performing comparably to expert assessments. Interpretation using SHAP values showed strong alignment with imaging features known to align with AD or OIED, respectively. These findings highlight the potential of radiomics to augment neuroimaging workflows."

While T1-weighted MRI is widely used in AD research, its capacity to identify early vulnerability and monitor longitudinal progression remains incompletely characterized. We analyzed longitudinal T1-weighted MRI data from 224 cognitively unimpaired older adults followed for up to 12 years. Participants were stratified by clinical outcome into converters to mild cognitive impairment (HC-converters, n = 112) and stable controls (HC-stable, n = 112). Groups were matched at baseline for age (mean ~ 74-75 years), education (~ 16.4 years), and cognitive scores (MMSE ≈ 29; CDR-SB ≈ 0.04). Four MRI-derived biomarkers were examined: brain-predicted age difference (brain-PAD), mean cortical thickness, AD-cortical signature, and hippocampal volume. Brain-PAD showed the strongest baseline association with future conversion (β = 1.25, t = 3.52, p = 0.0009) and highest classification accuracy (AUC = 0.66; sensitivity = 62%, and specificity = 67%). Longitudinal mixed-effects models focusing on the group × time interaction revealed a significant positive slope in brain-PAD for converters (β = 0.0079, p = 0.003) and a non-significant trend in stable controls (β = 0.0047, p = 0.075), indicating incipient divergence in brain aging trajectories during the preclinical window. Hippocampal volume and AD-cortical signature declined similarly in both groups. The mean cortical thickness had limited discriminative or dynamic utility. These findings support brain-PAD, derived from routine T1-weighted MRI using machine learning, as a sensitive, performance-independent biomarker for early risk stratification and monitoring of cognitive aging trajectories."

Imaging and machine learning-based analysis validated in situ DNTs as anatomically distinct from synaptic spines. DNTs actively transported small molecules and human amyloid-β (Aβ); DNT density increased before plaque formation in the medial prefrontal cortex of APP/PS1 mice (APP, Aβ precursor protein; PS1, presenilin-1), suggesting that the dendrite-DNT network might play a role in Alzheimer's disease pathology. Computational models of DNT-mediated Aβ propagation recapitulated early amyloidosis, predicting selective intracellular accumulation.

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a chronic neurological disorder that impairs the cognitive and behavioral abilities of older people. Early detection and treatment are crucial for minimizing the progression of the disease. Electroencephalogram (EEG) makes it possible to investigate the brain activities linked to various forms of disabilities experienced by individuals with AD. Nevertheless, the EEG signals are non-linear and non-stationary in nature making it difficult to retrieve the concealed information from the EEG signals. Therefore, a Fourier Decomposition Method (FDM) and Hilbert Transform (HT) based EEG signals analysis (FHESA) method is developed in this paper for the automated detection of AD. The FHESA method aims to efficiently analyze the EEG data to identify the important brain regions vulnerable to AD, and to assess the impact of various EEG channels for the timely and early detection of AD. The proposed FHESA method is divided into three primary stages. The first stage deals with the decomposition of the EEG signals into a finite number of Fourier Intrinsic Band Functions (FIBFs). In the second stage, HT is applied to all FIBFs to obtain instantaneous amplitude, frequency, and phase, that are then used to construct feature vectors. In the last stage, various Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are used to classify these feature vectors for efficient AD detection. Two distinct data sets are employed to assess the effectiveness of the proposed FHESA method. The outcome demonstrates that with dataset-I and dataset-II, the proposed methodology can detect AD with 98% and 99% accuracy, respectively. The performance of the proposed FHESA method is compared to other state-of-the-art methods used for AD detection. The promising results show that the proposed FHESA method can assist neurological experts in identifying and utilizing EEG signals for AD detection."

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative illness causing a significant decrease in cognitive function, and early, accurate diagnosis is of great therapeutic and diagnostic value. Currently, there is promising potential for applying various types of artificial intelligence techniques, such as enhanced models of deep learning, for classifying Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, this study proposes an Outline of deep learning to classify Alzheimer's disease with segmentation using the Multi-Layer U-Net and a hybrid classification approach combining multi-scale EfficientNet with SVM. The proposed methodology consists of a four-phase process: (1) Whole brain segmentation, (2) Gray matter segmentation using multi-layer U-Net segmentation, (3) Feature extraction using Multi-Scale Efficient Net with SVM for classification, and (4) XAI (explainable AI) techniques by integrating Saliency Map Quantitative Analysis for increased clinical trustworthiness and model interpretability. It is found that the experiment results provide promising classification performance for three classes - Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Cognitively Normal (CN) with an overall accuracy of 97.78% ± 0.54%, precision of 97.18% ± 1.14% (AD), 97.78% ± 0.29% (CN) and 97.03% ± 1.10% (MCI), recall of 97.90% ± 0.77% (AD), 97.49% ± 1.34% (CN) and 97.25% ± 0.99% (MCI), and F1 score of 97.74% ± 0.63% (AD), 97.78% ± 0.79% (CN), and 97.54% ± 0.69%(MCI).

    "abstract": "Despite recent developments, the genetics and biology of Alzheimer's disease remain insufficiently characterized. As an important first step toward developing effective treatment strategies to slow or prevent Alzheimer's disease onset, the identification of relevant genetic markers is crucial. In the present study, we analyzed transcriptomic and multi-omic datasets across multiple cohorts (the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project, Mount Sinai Brain Bank, and Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Studies) using gene set enrichment analysis, machine learning algorithms, and polygenic risk scoring to identify gene sets relevant to Alzheimer's disease risk and pathological features. For prioritized gene sets, we performed epigenome-wide association studies to assess DNA methylation patterns, and used multi-omic mediation analysis to characterize the causal gene regulatory networks. Overall, we identified several key gene sets relevant to Alzheimer's disease pathology-particularly, those related to immune system function and mitochondrial dysfunction. Upregulated pathways, including neutrophil degranulation and tumor necrosis factor-α signaling pathways, correlated strongly with aspects of neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease. By contrast, downregulated oxidative phosphorylation pathways further suggested mitochondrial dysfunction. Gene sets that contained mitochondrially located genes (e.g., SGK1 and LRRK1) were identified as significantly contributing to neurodegeneration. Moreover, genes such as CXCL1, TGFB2, and DUSP1 were consistently implicated in all datasets, thus emphasizing their involvement in immune modulation and mitochondrial function. The multimodal investigation outlined in the current study represents useful steps toward comprehending the genetic architecture of Alzheimer's disease, including an expanded understanding of the spatial interactions of genes associated with disease susceptibility. Mitochondrial dysfunction and immune modulation were pathological pathways that converged on Alzheimer's disease and future treatment novel options. Using the frameworks provided in the current comprehensive study, we present opportunities to explore targeted treatment strategies that may alter immune systems and mitochondrial function to optimize treatment outcomes for individuals at increased risk of or living with Alzheimer's disease."

    "abstract": "The voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.6, encoded by the sodium voltage-gated channel alpha subunit 8 gene, is a crucial regulator of neuronal excitability, with widespread expression throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems. Recent breakthroughs in structural biology, particularly the elucidation of the cryo-EM architecture of Nav1.6 at a resolution of 0.31 nm, have provided unprecedented insights into its molecular organization and functional modulation. As a key mediator of action potential initiation and propagation, Nav1.6 possesses unique biophysical properties, including persistent and resurgent sodium currents that critically influence neuronal firing patterns. This comprehensive review synthesizes current knowledge on the physiological functions and pathological roles of Nav1.6 in multiple neurological conditions. Key findings include the following: (1) Epilepsy studies reveal more than 250 sodium voltage-gated channel alpha subunit 8 mutations with distinct genotype-phenotype correlations, where gain-of-function variants lead to severe epileptic encephalopathies, while loss-of-function variants are associated with generalized epilepsy, highlighting the potential of Nav1.6-selective blockers such as XEN901 and GS967. (2) In Alzheimer's disease, Nav1.6 mediates amyloid-β oligomer-induced neuronal hyperexcitability through amyloid precursor protein-dependent membrane trafficking and regulates beta-secretase 1 expression via nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 signaling, suggesting novel disease-modifying strategies. (3) Parkinson's disease research has demonstrated that Nav1.6 upregulation in reactive astrocytes in the globus pallidus contributes to motor deficits through calcium-mediated abnormalities in neuronal synchronization. (4) Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis involves Nav1.6-dependent cortical hyperexcitability preceding motor neuron degeneration, with riluzole showing partial efficacy through sodium current modulation. (5) Multiple sclerosis pathophysiology features Nav1.6 redistribution in demyelinated axons, which drives calcium-dependent axonal injury via reverse Na+/Ca2+ exchange. (6) Chronic pain mechanisms involve Nav1.6 overexpression in dorsal root ganglia neurons, regulated by the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and tumor necrosis factor-α signaling pathways. (7) Traumatic brain injury models show that exercise-induced cognitive improvement is correlated with the normalization of Nav1.6-mediated excitability. Therapeutic development has progressed from nonselective sodium channel blockers to precision approaches, including state-dependent pore blockers designed using structural insights; allosteric modulators targeting specific conformations; gene therapy strategies using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and antisense oligonucleotides; and miRNA-based regulation of channel expression. Current challenges include achieving sufficient subtype selectivity, optimizing blood-brain barrier penetration, and developing clinically relevant biomarkers for patient stratification. Future directions emphasize the integration of advanced technologies-such as singlecell multiomics to map neuronal subtype-specific expression patterns, patient-derived organoids for personalized drug testing, and machine learning-assisted drug design-to accelerate translation. Large-scale collaborative efforts will be essential to validate therapeutic candidates and establish genotype-guided treatment protocols for Nav1.6-related disorders."

We propose a novel classification pipeline that combines autoencoders for feature extraction and bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) networks for analyzing patterns over time in EEG data. Given the complexity and high dimensionality of EEG signals, we employed an autoencoder to reduce data dimensionality while preserving key diagnostic features.

We evaluated our approach on a publicly available EEG dataset from OpenNeuro, which includes resting-state EEG recordings from 88 elderly participants-36 with AD, 23 with FTD, and 29 cognitively normal controls. EEG provides a non-invasive, cost-effective tool for brain monitoring, but presents challenges such as noise sensitivity and inter-subject variability. Despite these challenges, our approach achieved 98% accuracy while maintaining transparency, making it a promising tool for clinical applications in the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases."

Meanwhile, aging is a critical risk factor in age-related diseases, including AD. Now, the underlying mechanisms of gastrodin against aging-related genes in Alzheimer's disease remain unclear. Our study aimed to identify and validate the molecular mechanisms of gastrodin on aging-related genes in Alzheimer's disease. Firstly, we analyzed gene expression datasets from GEO in NCBI, and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to identify the intersected genes with differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and aging genes. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) functional enrichment analyses and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network were performed to analyze and evaluate the intersected genes to screen key genes. Subsequently, we used machine learning techniques to screen hub genes and subcellular localization to confirm the reliability of the hub genes. Finally, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation were combined to explore the binding interactions between core targets and gastrodin. We identified 29 intersecting genes among DEGs of AD, key module genes of AD, and aging genes. Next, nine common hub genes were identified by four algorithms of the cytoHubba plug-in. Four hub genes, <i>GFAP</i>, <i>NPY</i>, <i>SNAP25</i>, and <i>SST</i>, were found as possibly hub aging-related genes in Alzheimer's disease from machine algorithms by adopting the random forest, LASSO, SVM, and Boruta models. Among them, <i>GFAP</i> showed marked upregulation, while <i>NPY</i>, <i>SNAP25</i>, and <i>SST</i> exhibited significant downregulation (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Finally, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation exhibited that gastrodin has an excellent affinity in docking with SNAP25. This study demonstrates that SNAP25 can be considered a key aging-related gene in AD, and gastrodin could treat AD by targeting specific genes and signaling pathways. These findings provide critical insights for the clinical application of gastrodin."

Various neurological disorders are also associated with hypothalamic abnormalities. Automated image analysis of this structure from brain MRI is thus highly desirable to study the hypothalamus in vivo. However, most of the automated segmentation tools currently available focus exclusively on T1w images. In this study, we introduce H-SynEx, a machine learning method for automated segmentation of hypothalamic subregions that generalizes across different MRI sequences and resolutions without retraining. H-synEx was trained with synthetic images built from label maps derived from ultra-high resolution ex vivo MRI scans, allowing finer-grained manual segmentation when compared with 1 mm isometric in vivo images. We validated our method using Dice Coefficient (DSC) and Average Hausdorff distance (AVD) across in vivo images from six different datasets with six different MRI sequences (T1, T2, proton density, quantitative T1, fractional anisotropy, and FLAIR). Statistical analysis compared hypothalamic subregion volumes in controls, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) subjects using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) and the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Our results show that H-SynEx successfully leverages information from ultra-high resolution scans to segment in vivo from different MRI sequences. Our automated segmentation was able to discriminate controls versus patients with Alzheimer's disease on FLAIR images with 5 mm spacing.

All EEG data underwent standardized preprocessing incorporating a 0.5-35 Hz band-pass filter and automated artifact rejection. The EEG data were subsequently partitioned into 20-s segments for microstate analysis, generating temporally aligned sequences characterized by canonical four-class spatial configurations.ResultsA total of 24 features were extracted from microstate sequences, including coverage, mean duration, occurrence, and transition probabilities between each two microstates. The statistical testing results indicated that there were significant differences in 21 features between AD patients and healthy controls. Based on the features of statistical significance, we implemented support vector machine models to distinguish the AD patients from the healthy controls, achieving an averaged classification accuracy of 75.8% in a 5-fold cross-subject validation via 10 times repeated random trials.ConclusionsThe EEG microstate analysis methods was a non-invasive, convenient, and efficient technical pathway and could be adopted for identifying AD."

Several machine learning models including Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Partial Least Squares (PLS), Random Forest, and XGBoost were trained to classify AD and HC. Repeated cross-validation was used to ensure performance evaluation.ResultsThe LASSO and PLS models showed the strongest classification performance on the test set, achieving area under the ROC curve (AUC) values of 0.84 and 0.90, respectively. A refined model based on only the top 5 metabolites maintained strong performance, and the inclusion of Apolipoprotein E (<i>APOE</i>) genotype information notably improved classification accuracy, particularly by reducing false negatives in AD cases.ConclusionsThese results highlight important metabolic signatures that could help to reduce misdiagnosis and support the development of metabolomic panels to detect AD. The combination of multiple serum metabolic biomarkers and <i>APOE</i> genotyping can significantly improve classification accuracy and potentially assist in making non-invasive, cost-effective diagnostic approach."

    "abstract": "Understanding complex diseases requires models that can integrate diverse layers of biological data while yielding insights that are biologically interpretable. Although multi-omics integration with machine learning (ML) has advanced disease prediction and biomarker discovery, most existing approaches overlook the hierarchical and regulatory relationships that connect these molecular layers. Here, we present the Hierarchical Input Neural Network (HINN), a deep learning framework that incorporates known cross-omics relationships directly into its architecture, capturing the flow of information from genomics to epigenomics, transcriptomics, and downstream biological processes. By embedding these relationships, HINN improves both predictive performance and biological interpretability. We applied HINN to blood-derived multi-omics data from individuals with Alzheimer's disease or mild cognitive impairment to predict cognitive scores from standardized assessments. HINN outperformed both baseline and state-of-the-art models and pinpointed multi-omics biomarkers-including SNPs and promoter-region CpG sites in <i>ATP6V1C1</i> and <i>RCHY1</i> -that were significantly correlated with plasma p-Tau181 levels. These features map to biologically relevant processes with potential implications for cognitive decline. Our findings demonstrate how combining deep learning with biological knowledge can uncover interpretable, blood-based biomarkers for cognitive decline due to complex diseases such as Alzheimer's.

    "abstract": "The indicator cell assay platform (iCAP) is a novel next-generation approach for blood-based diagnostics that uses standardized cells as biosensors to amplify weak disease signals in blood. We developed an Alzheimer's disease iCAP (AD-iCAP) for early detection at the mild cognitive impairment/mild dementia stages. To develop the assay, patient plasma is incubated with standardized neurons, which transduce complex circulating signals into gene-expression readouts used to train multivariate disease classifiers via machine learning. We applied systems biology analyses (e.g., GSEA, PCA, correlation/network analyses) to optimize analytical and computational parameters, and then evaluated a locked model in a study with retrospectively collected samples. Performance was AUC 0.64 (95% CI 0.51-0.78, n=82) on an independent external-validation set and AUC 0.77 (95% CI 0.57-0.96, n=23) on a blind set, supporting prospective confirmation in a larger cohort. To overcome pre-analytical noise and reduce bias in feature-selection, modeling was done using a fixed panel of 84 candidate genes chosen a priori from an external AD-iCAP dataset generated with 5XFAD mouse plasma. Despite using no AD-specific prior knowledge in this approach, the assay readout was enriched for Alzheimer's-relevant pathways, including cholesterol biosynthesis, synaptic structure/neurotransmission and PIK3/AKT activation. Because the assay senses a multivalent cellular response, which is orthogonal to circulating amyloid or tau measurements, AD-iCAP may complement existing blood tests, and its multivariate readout offers a path to precision-medicine applications such as patient stratification for treatment response."

Here, we demonstrate that disease-specific tau conformations determine unique protein interaction landscapes across Alzheimer's disease (AD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Through comprehensive interactome profiling of misfolded tau aggregates from PBS- and sarkosyl-soluble fractions. We identified 493 high-confidence proteins with remarkable disease specificity-notably, no common interactors overlapping across all three tauopathies. Machine learning classification achieved compelling discrimination between diseases using as few as 4-6 proteins features, demonstrating robust molecular signatures underlying clinical heterogeneity. AD derived tau aggregates uniquely engaged cellular metabolism machinery, including key glycolytic enzymes and TCA cycle proteins, alongside glutamate/GABA neurotransmitter cycling components, with the astrocytic glutamate transporter SLC1A2 showing 27-fold enrichment over other tauopathies. In contrast, PSP tau displayed the most distinctive profile, with extensive protein depletion (52/57 significant proteins) and selective enrichment of proteasome components, particularly PSMB7 showing >3000-fold abundance. DLB tau is associated with neurogenesis modulators while depleting neuroinflammatory mediators. These interaction patterns were validated through proximity ligation assays and correlated with distinct post-translational modification profiles, with PSP tau exhibiting globally elevated ubiquitination, AD showing mixed modification patterns, and DLB displaying minimal ubiquitination. Critically, sarkosyl-soluble fractions revealed reduced interactome complexity across diseases, except for PSP tau which maintained robust interactions with GPCR-ERK signaling and kinetochore proteins, suggesting unique aggregation mechanisms. Our findings establish that conformationally distinct tau strains dictate disease-specific protein interaction networks, providing molecular insight into tauopathy diversity and identifying novel therapeutic targets for precision medicine approaches in neurodegeneration."

Dietary interventions, particularly the Mediterranean (MeDi) and MIND diets, have been associated with reduced cognitive decline, but their long-term comparative effects remain underexplored. To compare the long-term neuroprotective effects of the Mediterranean and MIND diets in healthy individuals and AD patients, assess dietary adherence and cognitive function relationships, and investigate the impact of micronutrients on cognitive biomarkers. A 5-year prospective cohort study was conducted with 1500 participants (750 healthy controls, 750 AD patients). Dietary adherence was assessed using validated dietary screening tools. Cognitive function was evaluated via MMSE and MoCA scores, while biomarkers (amyloid-beta, tau, NfL, CRP, IL-6, TNF-α, polyphenols, omega-3, and B vitamins) were measured through blood and CSF samples. Machine learning techniques were utilized to analyze dietary patterns and predict cognitive trajectories. Higher adherence to both diets was associated with significantly better cognitive scores (p < 0.0001), lower amyloid-beta, tau, and NfL levels, and reduced inflammatory markers (CRP, IL-6, TNF-α). The MIND diet showed a slightly stronger association with cognitive protection than MeDi. Micronutrients such as polyphenols, omega-3, and B vitamins correlated with improved cognitive performance. Genetic analysis suggested that APOE-ε4 carriers may experience variable responses to dietary interventions. The Mediterranean and MIND diets provide significant neuroprotection against cognitive decline and AD progression. While both diets confer benefits, the MIND diet demonstrated a marginally greater impact on cognitive preservation. These findings underscore the importance of dietary interventions as non-pharmacological strategies for AD prevention and management. Further research is needed to optimize dietary recommendations based on genetic predisposition and metabolic factors."

At first, an input Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) image is attained from the database. Image preprocessing is then performed by a Bilateral Filter (BF) to enhance the quality of image by denoising. Then segmentation is carried out by the proposed O-SegUNet. This method integrates the O-SegNet and U-Net model using Pearson correlation coefficient-based fusion. After the segmentation, augmentation is carried out by utilizing Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to address class imbalance. After that, feature extraction is carried out. Finally, AD classification is performed by the Fuzzy Res-LeNet. The stages are classified as Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), AD, Cognitive Normal (CN), Early Mild Cognitive Impairment (EMCI), and Late Mild Cognitive Impairment (LMCI). Here, Fuzzy Res-LeNet is devised by integrating Fuzzy logic, ResNeXt, and LeNet.

However, the late enriched understanding of the genetic underpinnings of AD has been made possible due to recent advancements in data mining analysis methods, machine learning, and microarray technologies. However, the \"curse of dimensionality\" caused by the high-dimensional microarray datasets impacts the accurate prediction of the disease due to issues of overfitting, bias, and high computational demands. To alleviate such an effect, this study proposes a gene selection approach based on the parameter-free and large-scale manta ray foraging optimization algorithm. Given the dimensional disparities and statistical relationship distributions of the six investigated datasets, in addition to four evaluated machine learning classifiers; the proposed Sign Random Mutation and Best Rank enhancements that substantially improved MRFO's exploration and exploitation contributed to efficient identification of relevant genes and to machine learning improved prediction accuracy."

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder that affects millions worldwide, leading to cognitive decline and memory impairment. Structural changes in the brain gradually impair cognitive functions, and by the time symptoms become evident, significant and often irreversible neuronal damage has already occurred. This makes early diagnosis critical, as timely intervention can help slow disease progression and improve patients' quality of life. Recent advancements in machine learning and neuroimaging have enabled early detection of AD using imaging data and computer-aided diagnostic systems. Deep learning, particularly with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), has gained widespread recognition for its ability to extract high-level features by leveraging localized connections, weight sharing, and three-dimensional invariance. In this study, we present a 3d convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) designed to enhance classification accuracy using data from the latest version of the OASIS database (OASIS-3). Unlike traditional 2D approaches, our model processes full 3D MRI scans to preserve spatial information and prevent information loss during dimensionality reduction. Additionally, we applied advanced preprocessing techniques, including intensity normalization and noise reduction, to enhance image quality and improve classification performance. Our proposed 3D-CNN achieved an impressive classification accuracy of 91%, outperforming several existing models.

    "abstract": "People with semantic dementia (SD) or semantic variant primary progressive aphasia typically present with marked atrophy of the anterior temporal lobe, and thereafter progress more slowly than other forms of frontotemporal dementia. This suggests a prolonged prodromal phase with accumulation of neuropathology and minimal symptoms, about which little is known. To study early and presymptomatic SD, we first examine a well-characterised cohort of people with SD recruited from the Cambridge Centre for Frontotemporal Dementia. Five people with early SD had coincidental MRI prior to the onset of symptoms, or were healthy volunteers in research with anterior temporal lobe atrophy as an incidental finding. We model longitudinal imaging changes in left- and right-lateralised SD to predict atrophy at symptom onset. We then assess 61,203 participants with structural brain MRI in the UK Biobank to find individuals with imaging changes in keeping with SD but with no neurodegenerative diagnosis. To identify these individuals in UK Biobank, we design an ensemble-based classifier, differentiating baseline structural MRI in SD from healthy controls and patients with other neurodegenerative diseases, including other causes of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. We train the classifier on a Cambridge-based cohort (SD n=47, other neurodegenerative diseases n=498, healthy controls n=88) and test it on a combined cohort from the Neuroimaging in Frontotemporal Dementia study and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (SD n=42, other neurodegenerative n=449, healthy control n=127). From our case series, we find people with marked atrophy three to five years before recognition of symptom onset in left- or right-predominant SD. We present right-lateralised cases with subtle multimodal semantic impairment, found concurrently with only mild behavioural disturbance. We show that imaging measures can be used to reliably and accurately differentiate clinical SD from other neurodegenerative diseases (recall 0.88, precision 0.95, F1 score 0.91). We find individuals with no neurodegenerative diagnosis in the UK Biobank with striking left-lateralised (prevalence ages 45-85 4.8/100,000) or right-lateralised (5.9/100,000) anterior temporal lobe atrophy, with deficits on cognitive testing suggestive of semantic impairment. These individuals show progressive involvement of other cognitive domains in longitudinal follow-up. Together, our findings suggest that (i) there is a burden of incipient early anterior temporal lobe atrophy in older populations, with comparable prevalence of left- and right-sided cases from this prospective unbiased approach to identification, (ii) substantial atrophy is required for manifest symptoms, particularly in right-lateralised cases, and (iii) semantic deficits across multiple domains can be detected in the early symptomatic phase."

Traditional diagnostic tools, like neuroimaging, provide valuable insights but are limited by accessibility and infrastructure demands. Meanwhile, emerging modalities, including wearable sensors and speech analysis, enable less invasive and more continuous data collection but introduce challenges related to standardization and privacy. The coexistence of these heterogeneous data streams complicates multimodal integration across cohorts, populations, and clinical settings. Current analytical approaches typically require modality-specific preprocessing pipelines and harmonization methods that were not designed to accommodate modern AI-based capabilities, such as multimodal fusion. In this perspective, we propose an \"AI-first\" strategy for multimodal data integration that aligns data structuring, harmonization, and modeling within a unified set of guiding principles to optimize modern AI development, while remaining flexible enough to support classical analytical approaches. HIGHLIGHTS: Understanding and managing ADRD requires integrating biological, cognitive, and behavioral data across multiple modalities. Incorporating multiple modalities requires new standards for harmonization and interoperability. Current data platforms are not necessarily built to support multimodal fusion or generalizable AI models across diverse ADRD populations. Modern AI models are capable of learning from messy, multimodal, and incomplete data but require infrastructure designed for this purpose.

Present deep learning methodologies for MRI-based AD detection frequently demonstrate spatial dependencies and exhibit deficiencies in robust validation mechanisms. Extant validation techniques inadequately integrate anatomical knowledge and exhibit challenges in feature interpretability across a range of imaging conditions. To address this fundamental gap, we introduce a reverse validation paradigm that systematically repositions anatomical structures to test whether models recognize features based on anatomical characteristics rather than spatial memorization. Our research endeavors to rectify these shortcomings by proposing three innovative methodologies: Feature Position Invariance (FPI) for the validation of anatomical features, biomarker location augmentation aimed at enhancing spatial learning, and High-Confidence Cohort (HCC) selection for the reliable identification of training samples. The FPI methodology leverages reverse validation approach to substantiate model predictions through the reconstruction of anatomical features, bolstered by our extensive data augmentation strategy and a confidence-based sample selection technique. The application of this framework utilizing YOLO and MobileNet architecture has yielded significant advancements in both binary and three-class AD classification tasks, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with enhancements of 2-4 % relative to baseline models. Additionally, our methodology generates interpretable insights through anatomy-aligned validation, establishing direct links between model decisions and neuropathological features. Our experimental findings reveal consistent performance across various anatomical presentations, signifying that the framework effectively enhances both the reliability and interpretability of AD diagnosis through MRI analysis, thereby equipping medical professionals with a more robust diagnostic support system."

This paper aims to tackle a situation when precisely labeled samples are limited in the training set due to cost or availability constraints, whereas there could be an abundance of samples with imprecise labels. We focus on imprecise labels that are intervals, i.e., one can know that the a sample belongs to an interval of labels but cannot know which unique label it has. This situation is quite common in health care datasets due to limitations of the diagnostic instrument, sparse clinical visits, or/and patient dropout. Limited research has been done to develop OL models with imprecise/interval labels. We propose a new Hybrid Ordinal Learner (HOL) to integrate samples with both precise and interval labels to train a robust OL model. We also develop a tractable and efficient optimization algorithm to solve the HOL formulation. We compare HOL with several recently developed OL methods on four benchmarking datasets, which demonstrate the superior performance of HOL. Finally, we apply HOL to a real-world dataset for predicting the speed of progressing to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) for individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) based on a combination of multi-modality neuroimaging and demographic/clinical datasets. HOL achieves high accuracy in the prediction and outperforms existing methods.

Applied to MRI data, CASFI achieved an accuracy of 97.27%, outperforming baseline deep learning models and traditional classifiers in both accuracy and robustness. This approach supports early diagnosis and informed clinical decision-making, providing a valuable tool to assist healthcare professionals in managing and planning treatment for Alzheimer's patients."

    "title": "Design of Tau Aggregation Inhibitors Using Iterative Machine Learning and a Polymorph-Specific Brain-Seeded Fibril Amplification Assay.",
    "abstract": "The aggregation of tau into amyloid fibrils is associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related tauopathies. Since different tauopathies are characterized by the formation of distinct tau fibril morphologies, it is important to combine the search of tau aggregation inhibitors with the development of in vitro tau aggregation assays that recapitulate aggregation as it may occur in the brain. Here we address this problem by reporting an in vitro tau aggregation assay in which AD brain homogenates are used to seed the generation of first-generation tau fibrils in a polymorph-specific manner under quiescent conditions. These fibrils are then used to create amyloid seed libraries from which second-generation kinetic assays can be readily performed. Using this strategy, we illustrate an iterative machine learning method for the identification of small molecules for the polymorph-specific inhibition of the in vitro formation of tau fibrils. We further show that the small molecules selected by this procedure are potent inhibitors in a <i>Drosophila</i> tauopathy model."

    "abstract": "<i>Objective.</i>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia worldwide, encompassing a prodromal stage known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI), where patients may either progress to AD or remain stable. The objective of the work was to capture structural and functional modulations of brain structure and function relying on multimodal MRI data and single nucleotide polymorphisms, also in case of missing views, with the twofold goal of classifying AD patients versus healthy controls and detecting MCI converters.<i>Approach.</i>We propose a multimodal deep learning (DL)-based classification framework where a generative module employing cycle generative adversarial networks was introduced in the latent space for imputing missing data (a common issue of multimodal approaches). Explainable AI method was then used to extract input features' relevance allowing for post-hoc validation and enhancing the interpretability of the learned representations.<i>Main results.</i>Experimental results on two tasks, AD detection and MCI conversion, showed that our framework reached competitive performance in the state-of-the-art with an accuracy of0.926±0.02(CI [0.90, 0.95]) and0.711±0.01(CI [0.70, 0.72]) in the two tasks, respectively. The interpretability analysis revealed gray matter modulations in cortical and subcortical brain areas typically associated with AD. Moreover, impairments in sensory-motor and visual resting state networks along the disease continuum, as well as genetic mutations defining biological processes linked to endocytosis, amyloid-beta, and cholesterol, were identified.<i>Significance.</i>Our integrative and interpretable DL approach shows promising performance for AD detection and MCI prediction while shedding light on important biological insights."

    "abstract": "Deep mutational scanning (DMS) assays provide a powerful method to generate large-scale datasets essential for advancing AI-driven predictions in biology. The tripartite β-lactamase assay (TPBLA), in which a protein of interest is inserted between two domains of β-lactamase, has previously been reported as capable of detecting and quantitating the aggregation of proteins and biologics in the oxidizing periplasm of <i>Escherichia coli</i> and used as a platform for identifying small molecule inhibitors of aggregation. Here, we repurpose the TPBLA into a high-throughput DMS platform. We validate this format using a single-site saturation library of the intrinsically disordered peptide Aβ<sub>42</sub>, linked to Alzheimer's disease, demonstrating strong agreement between observed variant fitness scores and variant behavior using our previously reported low-throughput TPBLA. The results of DMS revealed variant fitness scores that correlate with known amyloid-promoting regions. An in silico approach using FoldX-derived per-residue thermodynamic stability confirmed that the TPBLA reports on amyloid fibril stability. In vitro experiments support this finding, showing a strong correlation between variant fitness scores and the critical concentration of amyloid formation. Machine learning using the DMS dataset identified β-sheet propensity and polarity as primary drivers of variant fitness scores. The derived model is also able to predict thermodynamically stabilizing regions in other amyloid systems, underscoring its generalizability. Collectively, our results demonstrate the TPBLA as a versatile platform for generating robust datasets to advance predictive modeling and to inform the design of aggregation-resistant proteins."

Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, a deep learning model was developed using a diverse training dataset of 1900 MRI scans (ages 24-93 with a mean of 65 years (SD: 11.5 years) and 1007 females and 893 males) with reference labels generated using a multiatlas segmentation method with human supervision. The final model was validated using 71391 scans from 14 studies. Segmentation quality was assessed using Dice similarity and Pearson correlation coefficients with reference segmentations. Downstream predictive performance for brain age and Alzheimer's disease was evaluated by fitting machine learning models. Statistical significance was assessed using Mann-Whittney U and McNemar's tests. Results The DLMUSE model achieved high correlation (r = 0.93-0.95) and agreement (median Dice scores = 0.84-0.89) with reference segmentations across the testing dataset. Prediction of brain age using DLMUSE features achieved a mean absolute error of 5.08 years, similar to that of the reference method (5.15 years, <i>P</i> = .56). Classification of Alzheimer's disease using DLMUSE features achieved an accuracy of 89% and F1-score of 0.80, which were comparable to values achieved by the reference method (89% and 0.79, respectively). DLMUSE segmentation speed was over 10000 times faster than that of the reference method (3.5 seconds vs 14 hours). Conclusion DLMUSE enabled rapid brain MRI segmentation, with performance comparable to that of state-of-theart methods across diverse datasets. The resulting open-source tools and user-friendly web interface can facilitate large-scale neuroimaging research and wide utilization of advanced segmentation methods. ©RSNA, 2025."

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms, particularly the biological paths linking these primary conditions to downstream diseases remain incompletely understood. In this study, we investigated the role of plasma proteins as mediators of secondary disease development using data from ~50,000 UK Biobank participants. Across three primary diseases and 18 subsequent conditions, we identified 1,461 significant mediation pathways involving 395 unique plasma proteins. Notable examples included GDF15 consistently mediating the diabetes-CVD link and ADM mediating the hypertension-pulmonary disease pathway. Protein mediators of secondary disease development were highly enriched in immune, metabolic, and cytokine-related pathways. Mendelian randomization supported causal roles for 84 proteins, highlighting their potential as therapeutic targets. Moreover, the identified mediating proteins improved predictive accuracy for secondary disease risk compared to other proteins and traditional clinical risk factors from machine learning methods. For example, in individuals with hypertension, the inclusion of top mediating proteins improved prediction accuracy for glomerular disease risk by approximately 14% measured by C-index. Stratified analyses based on disease severity revealed additional disease progression pathways and mediating proteins, such as APOE mediating the association between severe diabetes and Alzheimer's disease. Together, these findings implicate plasma proteins as central molecular mediators linking these primary diseases to subsequent development of a secondary condition and nominate promising targets for biomarker development and therapeutic intervention."

Structural MRI (sMRI) is a key imaging modality for detecting AD-related brain atrophy, yet traditional deep learning models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) struggle to capture complex spatial dependencies critical for AD diagnosis. This study introduces the Regional Attention-Enhanced Vision Transformer (RAE-ViT), a novel framework designed for AD classification using sMRI data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. RAE-ViT leverages regional attention mechanisms to prioritize disease-critical brain regions, such as the hippocampus and ventricles, while integrating hierarchical self-attention and multi-scale feature extraction to model both localized and global structural patterns. Evaluated on 1152 sMRI scans (255 AD, 521 MCI, 376 NC), RAE-ViT achieved state-of-the-art performance with 94.2 % accuracy, 91.8 % sensitivity, 95.7 % specificity, and an AUC of 0.96, surpassing standard ViTs (89.5 %) and CNN-based models (e.g., ResNet-50: 87.8 %). The model's interpretable attention maps align closely with clinical biomarkers (Dice: 0.89 hippocampus, 0.85 ventricles), enhancing diagnostic reliability. Robustness to scanner variability (92.5 % accuracy on 1.5T scans) and noise (92.5 % accuracy under 10 % Gaussian noise) further supports its clinical applicability. A preliminary multimodal extension integrating sMRI and PET data improved accuracy to 95.8 %. Future work will focus on optimizing RAE-ViT for edge devices, incorporating multimodal data (e.g., PET, fMRI, genetic), and exploring self-supervised and federated learning to enhance generalizability and privacy. RAE-ViT represents a significant advancement in AI-driven AD diagnosis, offering potential for early detection and improved patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder that progressively impairs cognitive, neurological, and behavioral functions, severely affecting quality of life. The current diagnostic process relies on expert interpretation of extensive clinical assessments, often leading to delays that reduce the effectiveness of early interventions. Given the lack of a definitive cure, accelerating and improving diagnosis is critical to slowing disease progression. Electroencephalography (EEG), a widely used non-invasive technique, captures AD-related brain activity alterations, yet extracting meaningful features from EEG signals remains a significant challenge. This study introduces a machine learning (ML)-driven approach to enhance AD diagnosis using EEG data. <b>Methods:</b> EEG recordings from 36 AD patients, 23 Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) patients, and 29 healthy individuals (HC) were analyzed. EEG signals were processed within the 0.5-45 Hz frequency range using the Welch method to compute the Power Spectral Density (PSD). From both the time-domain signals and the corresponding PSD, a total of 342 statistical and spectral features were extracted. The resulting feature set was then partitioned into training and test datasets while preserving the distribution of class labels. Feature selection was performed on the training set using Spearman and Pearson correlation analyses to identify the most informative features. To enhance classification performance, hyperparameter tuning was conducted using Bayesian optimization. Subsequently, classification was carried out using Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) the optimized hyperparameters. <b>Results:</b> The SVM classifier achieved a notable accuracy of 96.01%, outperforming previously reported methods. <b>Conclusions:</b> These results demonstrate the potential of machine learning-based EEG analysis as an effective approach for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease, enabling timely clinical intervention and ultimately contributing to improved patient outcomes."

Disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), schizophrenia, and depression often share overlapping symptoms, complicating diagnosis and treatment. Early detection is crucial for timely intervention; however, traditional diagnostic methods rely on subjective assessments and costly imaging, which are not universally accessible. Addressing these challenges, this study investigates the classification of multiple ND using electroencephalography (EEG) signals. <b>Methods:</b> Various feature extraction methods were employed, and the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso) algorithm was utilized for effective feature selection. Two-class (disease-disease and healthy control-disease), three-class (healthy control and two ND, as well as three ND), and four-class (healthy control and three ND) classifications were conducted using different machine learning algorithms with the selected features. An EEG dataset comprising 40 Alzheimer's patients, 43 healthy controls, 42 schizophrenia patients, 28 MCI patients, and 28 depression patients served as the experimental benchmark. <b>Results:</b> The Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classifier achieved the highest accuracy, distinguishing between healthy controls and Alzheimer's with 100% accuracy and demonstrating strong performance in other comparisons. Multi-class classification reached 84.67% accuracy for distinguishing depression, MCI, and schizophrenia, while four-class classification achieved 57.89%, highlighting the complexity of differentiating among multiple ND. The frequent selection of frontal lobe channels across ND indicates their critical role in classification. <b>Conclusions:</b> This study contributes to the literature by emphasizing disease-to-disease classification over the traditional control-versus-patient framework, highlighting the potential for more effective diagnostic tools in clinical settings."

Receptive language dysfunction (i.e., comprehension) tends to be more difficult to recognize for both the patient and the clinician. Subtle yet pervasive decrements in language may be a key feature (and potential driver) of pathological cognitive decline inherent to neurologic diseases involving a primary or secondary neurodegenerative process. While severe language impairment such as aphasia presenting in the context of stroke or dementia has been studied in detail, mild or insidious presentations remain relatively understudied. In this review, we evaluate neural substrates and clinical manifestations of language deficits noted in four neurologic populations: Alzheimer's disease (AD), stroke, multiple sclerosis (MS), and Parkinson's disease (PD). Despite differences in etiology and pathophysiology, these four neurologic populations each present with prominent language dysfunction. For each, we describe neuroanatomical substrates and networks underlying language dysfunction. We then describe current observations of language dysfunction in each population. We incorporate a discussion of emerging speech measurement tools employing machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). Overall, we provide evidence to support a nascent hypothesis of language dysfunction as a potential driver of cognitive decline across neurologic populations with the aim of motivating novel research insights and informing clinical care."

TCS-AD-related genes were identified using bioinformatics tools and public databases, followed by the screening of key genes through multi-model machine learning algorithms (LASSO, SVM-RFE, RF) to mitigate random errors in small sample sizes. DRD2 was confirmed as the most robust core gene by LASSO confidence interval analysis and SHAP evaluation, while APP and SLC6A3 were validated through cross-method intersection. Findings from functional enrichment analysis, Mendelian randomization, and molecular docking demonstrated that TCS may affect AD pathogenesis through these key genes. Moreover, a stable AD risk scoring model and predictive formula were developed via logistic regression analysis of T-A-Key Genes. This study constitutes an innovative and transformative research endeavor. Building upon the understanding of TCS-induced neurotoxicity, it extends to the clinical translational direction of predicting AD onset risk, thereby establishing a quantitative association model of \"environmental exposure-core genes-disease risk. \" It not only provides novel evidence for the potential role of TCS neurotoxicity as an environmental pathogenic factor in AD, emphasizing the necessity of prioritizing risk management of daily chemical exposure in AD prevention and treatment, but also offers a scientific foundation for the formulation of public health policies aimed at preventing long-term TCS exposure."

However, the exact nature of the relationship between RNA methylation and Alzheimer's disease remains unclear. In this study, RNA methylation levels were analyzed by bulk transcriptomic and single-cell RNA sequencing. The expression levels of RNA methylation regulators were confirmed using molecular biology techniques. Co-expression network analysis was used to identify relevant long non-coding RNAs. Molecular subtypes related to RNA methylation were classified, and variations in clinical characteristics, biological behavior, and immune signatures between subtypes were assessed. Machine learning approaches were applied to identify methylation-associated long noncoding RNAs, which were used to construct a risk model and nomogram for Alzheimer's disease. Potential therapeutic agents for different risk groups were predicted, and in vitro experiments were conducted to identify key RNA methylation events. Single-cell analysis demonstrated enhanced RNA methylation in patients with Alzheimer's disease, particularly within T cells, B cells, and NK cells. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blot confirmed alterations in RNA methylation regulators in neurons treated with amyloid-β oligomers in vitro . This evidence supported the classification of patients with Alzheimer's disease into heterogeneous subtypes. Specifically, subtype 1 was identified as the immune-active subtype, while subtype 2 was characterized by a metabolic phenotype. Machine learning algorithms identified five significant methylation-associated long non-coding RNAs -LINC01007, MAP4K3-DT, MIR302CHG, VAC14-AS1, and TGFB2-OT1-that accurately predict clinical outcomes for patients with Alzheimer's disease. These patients were classified into low- and high-risk categories; the latter group displayed higher immune infiltration, upregulated immune regulatory gene expression, and elevated immune scores and responded better to treatment with arachidonic-trifluoroethane. These findings suggest that dysregulated RNA methylation alters the immune microenvironment in Alzheimer's disease and is closely associated with its progression. This phenomenon provides novel insights into potential therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's disease that target RNA methylation."

In AD analysis, global efficiency, diffusion efficiency, and clustering coefficient were consistently reduced in the delta and theta bands, reflecting disrupted low-frequency network integration and the theta band presents the most prominent group differences between AD and HC. In FTD analysis, graph theory metrics were also reduced in the delta and theta bands, with the delta band showing the most pronounced group differences compared to HC."

    "title": "Artificial Intelligence for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis through T1-weighted MRI: A systematic review.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of dementia worldwide, characterized by heterogeneous neuropathological changes and progressive cognitive decline. Despite the numerous studies, there are still no effective treatments beyond those that aim to slow progression and compensate the impairment. Neuroimaging techniques provide a comprehensive view of brain changes, with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) playing a key role due to its non-invasive nature and wide availability. The T1-weighted MRI sequence is frequently used due to its prevalence in most MRI protocols, generating large datasets, ideal for artificial intelligence (AI) applications. AI, particularly machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques, has been increasingly utilized to model these datasets and classify individuals along the AD continuum. This systematic review evaluates studies using AI to classify more than two stages of AD based on T1-weighted MRI data. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the most widely applied, achieving an average classification accuracy of 85.93 % (range: 51.80-100 %; median: 87.70 %). These good results are due to CNNs' ability to extract hierarchical features directly from raw imaging data, reducing the need for extensive preprocessing. Non-convolutional neural networks and traditional ML approaches also demonstrated strong performance, with mean accuracies of 82.50 % (range: 57.61-99.38 %; median: 86.67 %) and 84.22 % (range: 33-99.10 %; median: 87.75 %), respectively, underscoring importance of input data selection. Despite promising outcomes, challenges remain, including methodological heterogeneity, overfitting risks, and a reliance on the ADNI database, which limits dataset diversity. Addressing these limitations is critical to advancing AI's clinical application for early detection, improved classification, and enhanced patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) greatly affects the daily functioning and life quality of patients and is prevalent in the elderly population. Amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation in the brain is the main hallmark of AD pathophysiology. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging is the most accurate method to identify Aβ deposits in the brain, but it is expensive and not widely available. The development of a low-cost method to detect Aβ deposition in the brain, as an alternative to PET, would therefore be of great value. This study aims to develop and validate machine learning algorithms for accurately predicting brain Aβ positivity using plasma biomarkers, genetic information, and clinical data as a cost-effective alternative to PET imaging."

However, most studies focused on balanced, large, broad-domain datasets like ImageNet, whereas, in real-world medical applications, dataset size is typically limited. This study compares the performance of SSL versus supervised learning (SL) on small, imbalanced medical imaging datasets. We experimented with four binary classification tasks: age prediction and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease from brain magnetic resonance imaging scans, pneumonia from chest radiograms, and retinal diseases associated with choroidal neovascularization from optical coherence tomography with a mean size of training sets of 843 images, 771 images, 1,214 images, and 33,484 images, respectively. We tested various combinations of label availability and class frequency distribution, repeating the training with different random seeds to assess result uncertainty. In most experiments involving small training sets, SL outperformed the selected SSL paradigms, even when a limited portion of labeled data was available. Our findings highlight the importance of carefully selecting learning paradigms based on specific application requirements, which are influenced by factors such as training set size, label availability, and class frequency distribution."

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the pathological aggregation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly Aβ-42, which plays a central role in disease progression. Soluble Aβ dimers have been implicated as the primary neurotoxic species contributing to synaptic dysfunction and cognitive impairment. In this study, we employ a comprehensive computational framework integrating molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, neural relational inference (NRI) modeling, and largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) analysis to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying Aβ-42 dimerization and evaluate the inhibitory potential of small molecules, apigenin and caffeine. Our findings demonstrate that apigenin exhibits a stronger inhibitory effect on Aβ-42 aggregation compared to caffeine. MD simulations reveal that apigenin disrupts monomer-monomer interactions by destabilizing key aggregation-prone regions, particularly residues 29 and 30, as quantified by MM/GBSA binding-free energy calculations. The application of NRI modeling further confirms the role of apigenin in reducing residue-residue interaction strength, thereby preventing the formation of stable β-sheet structures. Additionally, LLE analysis highlights the ability of apigenin to mitigate chaotic fluctuations within Aβ-42 dynamics, stabilizing monomeric conformations while preventing dimerization. By integrating computational biophysics and mathematical modeling approaches, this study provides a novel mechanistic understanding of Aβ-42 aggregation and offers compelling evidence for apigenin as a promising therapeutic candidate for AD. These findings underscore the potential of natural small molecules in targeting early-stage Aβ-42 aggregation, paving the way for future experimental and clinical investigations."

    "abstract": "Lipidomic profiling generates vast datasets, making manual annotation and trend interpretation complex and time-intensive. The structural and chemical diversity of the lipidome further complicates the analysis. While existing tools support targeted lipid identification, they often lack automated workflows and seamless integration with statistical and bioinformatics tools. Here, we introduce the comprehensive lipidomics automated workflow for multiple reaction monitoring (CLAW-MRM), a platform designed to automate lipid annotation, statistical analysis, and data parsing using custom multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) precursor product ion transitions. CLAW-MRM employs trimmed mean of m-value (TMM) normalization to account for lipid load differences, enabling robust cross-sample comparisons. To evaluate CLAW-MRM's performance, we analyzed lipid profiles in liver tissues of Alzheimer's disease (AD) mice and age-matched wild-type controls under conditions of constant and variable tissue mass, assessing the impact of normalization strategies on TMM-normalized lipidomic outcomes. Additionally, we isolated and profiled lipid droplets from individual brain regions of 18- to 24-month-old AD male mice and controls, leveraging nearly 1,500 MRM transitions across 11 lipid classes. Enhancing biological relevance, CLAW-MRM integrates LIGER (lipidome gene enrichment reactions), linking lipid expression with gene activation and suppression patterns. Through CLAW-MRM-based LIGER, we identified metabolic pathways enriched in differentially expressed lipids, offering insights into altered lipid metabolism in AD. To improve usability, CLAW-MRM incorporates a natural language interface powered by large language models, enabling artificial intelligence (AI)-driven user interaction for statistical and bioinformatics analyses. By automating lipid structural identification and integrating AI-assisted bioinformatics, CLAW-MRM provides an end-to-end workflow from data acquisition to interpretation, streamlining high-throughput lipidomics."

However, to what extent they are predictive of dementia burden nationally and regionally remains understudied.ObjectiveThis study investigates the cross-sectional associations between county-level BE and social vulnerability index (SVI) variables and AD dementia prevalence across the US and identifies the key variables within each region.MethodsWe applied eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Random Forest (RF) models nationally and regionally using a combined set of BE and SVI variables. Variable importance was assessed using SHapley Additive Explanations values.ResultsSignificant regional differences in AD dementia prevalence were observed (F = 126.56, <i>p</i> < 0.05). XGBoost consistently outperformed RF when using SVI and BE variables, with the highest predictive accuracy observed in the Northeast (R² = 0.92), followed by the South (R² = 0.73), West (R² = 0.72), and Midwest (R² = 0.72). In the Northeast, BE variables alone explained most of the variance, with grocery store density and walkability emerging as key variables. In contrast, the BE-only model for the South performed poorly but improved substantially with the inclusion of SVI variables. In the Midwest and West regions, both BE and SVI variables contributed more evenly to the model predictions.ConclusionsWhile BE variables are more influential in urbanized regions with increased infrastructure (Northeast), SVI variables play a stronger role in more socioeconomically disadvantaged regions (South), underscoring the need for region-specific interventions."

    "abstract": "The early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is important for effective therapeutic interventions and optimized enrollment for clinical trials. Recent studies have shown high accuracy in identifying mild AD by applying visibility graph and machine learning methods to electroencephalographic (EEG) data. We present a novel analytical framework combining Weighted Visibility Graphs (WVG) and ensemble learning to detect individuals in the \"preclinical\" stage of AD (preAD) using a word repetition EEG paradigm, where WVG is an advanced variant of natural Visibility Graph (VG), incorporating weighted edges based on the visibility degree between corresponding data points. The EEG signals were recorded from 40 cognitively unimpaired elderly participants (20 preclinical AD and 20 normal old) during a word repetition task. Event-related potential (ERP) and oscillatory signals were extracted from each EEG channel and transformed into a WVG network, from which relevant topological features were extracted. The features were selected using <i>t</i>-tests to reduce noise. Subsequent statistical analysis reveals significant disparities in the structure of WVG networks between preAD and normal subjects. Furthermore, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to condense the input data into its principal features. Leveraging these PCA components as input features, several machine learning algorithms are used to classify preAD vs. normal subjects. To enhance classification accuracy and robustness, an ensemble method is employed alongside the classifiers. Our framework achieved an accuracy of up to 92% discriminating preAD from normal old using both linear and non-linear classifiers, signifying the efficacy of combining WVG and ensemble learning in identifying very early AD from EEG signals. The framework can also improve clinical efficiency by reducing the amount of data required for effective classification and thus saving valuable clinical time."

Although laboratory techniques have validated many lncRNA-disease associations (LDAs), they are costly, laborious, and time-consuming. This study introduces LDA-GMCB, an LDA inference model, by leveraging graph embedding learning, multi-head self-attention mechanism (MSA) with convolutional neural network (CNN), low-rank singular value decomposition (SVD), and histogram-based gradient boosting (HGBoost). For all lncRNAs and diseases, LDA-GMCB first deciphers their nonlinear features by incorporating graph embedding learning and MSA with CNN, then captures their linear features through low-rank SVD, and finally infers their relationships based on HGBoost. LDA-GMCB was compared with four baselines (i.e., SDLDA, LDNFSGB, IPCARF and LDA-VGHB) under 5-fold cross validation and two cold start scenarios, and four popular classifiers (i.e., multi-layer perceptron, SVM, random forest, and XGBoost). Additionally, LDA-GMCB implemented ablation study. The outcomes demonstrated that LDA-GMCB greatly surpassed the above models and gained significant improvement on two public databases (i.e., lncRNADisease and MNDR) under most conditions. Moreover, LDA-GMCB was further applied to infer potential lncRNAs for Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. It identified that DGCR5 and HIF1A could link with the two diseases, respectively.

Given the biochemical heterogeneity of OxLDL, its accurate quantification remains a significant analytical challenge for precise statistical and Machine Learning (ML) methods. The paper examines statistical and computational methodologies used to assess OxLDL levels in clinical studies, highlighting strengths, limitations, and clinical relevance. This contribution provides current insights on standardizing analytic pipelines using statistical and machine learning tools for reproducibility, interpretability, and translational impact in clinical research. Traditional statistical methods have provided a foundational understanding of OxLDL's clinical implications. Meta-analyses, regression models, and survival analyses have consistently demonstrated associations between elevated OxLDL levels and increased disease risk, severity, and mortality. Comparative analyses (t-tests, ANOVA) and correlation studies further reveal its links with inflammation, lipid profiles, and cardiac function. Emerging ML and Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches offer powerful tools to advance OxLDL research. Predictive models using ML algorithms enhance disease risk stratification, while deep learning facilitates automated image analysis to assess OxLDL-induced vascular changes.

We use this paradigm in clinical trials. The predictions are provided by disease progression models, providing prognostic scores for all the participants as a function of baseline covariates. The proposed method would empower clinical trials by providing untreated digital twins of the treated patients while remaining statistically valid. The potential implications of this new estimator of the treatment effect in a two-arm randomized clinical trial (RCT) are manifold. First, it leads to an overall reduction of the sample size required to reach the same power as a standard RCT. Secondly, it advocates for an imbalance of controls and treated patients, requiring fewer controls to achieve the same power. Finally, this technique directly transfers any disease prediction model trained on large cohorts to practical and scientifically valid use. In this paper, we demonstrate the theoretical properties of this estimator and illustrate them through simulations. We show that it is asymptotically unbiased for the Average Treatment Effect and derive an explicit formula for its variance. We then compare this estimator to a regression-based linear covariate adjustment method. An application to an Alzheimer's disease clinical trial showcases the potential to reduce the sample size."

Since the FDA approval of Tauvid, a PET tracer targeting tau pathology, there has been a notable increase in studies applying AI to neuroimaging data. This narrative review synthesizes recent, high-impact literature to highlight clinically relevant AI applications in AD imaging. <b>Methods:</b> This review examined peer-reviewed studies published between January 2020 and January 2025, focusing on the use of AI, including machine learning, deep learning, and hybrid models for diagnostic and prognostic tasks in AD using PET and/or MRI. Studies were identified through targeted PubMed, Scopus, and Embase searches, emphasizing methodological diversity and clinical relevance. <b>Results:</b> A total of 111 studies were categorized into five thematic areas: Image preprocessing and segmentation, diagnostic classification, prognosis and disease staging, multimodal data fusion, and emerging innovations. Deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), and transformer-based architectures were widely employed by the research community in the field of AD. At the same time, several models reported strong diagnostic performance, but methodological challenges such as reproducibility, small sample sizes, and lack of external validation limit clinical translation. Trends in explainable AI, synthetic imaging, and integration of clinical biomarkers are also discussed. <b>Conclusions:</b> AI is rapidly advancing the field of AD imaging, offering tools for enhanced segmentation, staging, and early diagnosis. Multimodal approaches and biomarker-guided models show particular promise.

This study employed a multi-modal integrative analysis of mitochondrial gene expression in Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Multiple Sclerosis (MS), and Parkinson's Disease (PD) to address these gaps. We combined machine learning for predictive modeling with genetic causal inference methods (Mendelian Randomization, colocalization, PheWAS), followed by drug enrichment analysis and molecular docking. Our machine learning models, particularly Support Vector Machine and Multi-layer Perceptron, effectively classified these conditions, with MS exhibiting the highest predictability (mean Accuracy: 0.758). Causal inference analyses identified specific gene-disease links; for instance, genetically predicted increased expression of <i>PDK1</i> was causally associated with an elevated risk for both AD (OR = 1.041) and ALS (OR = 1.037), identifying pyruvate metabolism as a shared vulnerability. In contrast, genes like <i>SLC25A38</i> emerged as highly predictive specifically for PD. We also observed evidence of potential brain-periphery interaction, such as a bidirectional causal relationship between red blood cell indices and MS risk. Finally, drug enrichment analysis highlighted Celecoxib, and subsequent molecular docking predicted a strong binding affinity to <i>PDK1</i> (docking score S = -6.522 kcal/mol), generating hypotheses for potential metabolic modulation. Taken together, this study provides a computational hypothesis framework suggesting mitochondrial pathways and targets that warrant future biological validation. This study provides specific, genetically supported evidence for the causal role of mitochondrial pathways in neurological diseases and identifies tangible targets for future therapeutic development."

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, posing a growing public health challenge. Traditional machine learning models for AD prediction have relied on single omics data or phenotypic assessments, limiting their ability to capture the disease's molecular complexity and resulting in poor performance. Recent advances in high-throughput multi-omics have provided deeper biological insights. However, due to the scarcity of paired omics datasets, existing multi-omics AD prediction models rely on unpaired omics data, where different omics profiles are combined without being derived from the same biological sample, leading to biologically less meaningful pairings and causing less accurate predictions. To address these issues, we propose UnCOT-AD, a novel deep learning framework for Unpaired Cross-Omics Translation enabling effective multi-omics integration for AD prediction. Our method introduces the first-ever cross-omics translation model trained on unpaired omics datasets, using two coupled Variational Autoencoders and a novel cycle consistency mechanism to ensure accurate bidirectional translation between omics types. We integrate adversarial training to ensure that the generated omics profiles are biologically realistic. Moreover, we employ contrastive learning to capture the disease specific patterns in latent space to make the cross-omics translation more accurate and biologically relevant. We rigorously validate UnCOT-AD on both cross-omics translation and AD prediction tasks. Results show that UnCOT-AD empowers multi-omics based AD prediction by combining real omics profiles with corresponding omics profiles generated by our cross-omics translation module and achieves state-of-the-art performance in accuracy and robustness.
