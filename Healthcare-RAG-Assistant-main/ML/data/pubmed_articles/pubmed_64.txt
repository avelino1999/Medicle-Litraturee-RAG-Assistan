BACKGROUND: Central nervous system (CNS)-active polypharmacy (defined as 
concurrent exposure to three or more antidepressant, antipsychotic, antiseizure, 
benzodiazepine, opioid, or nonbenzodiazepine benzodiazepine receptor agonists) 
is associated with significant potential harms in persons living with dementia 
(PLWD).We conducted a pilot trial to assess a patient nudge intervention's 
implementation feasibility and preliminary effectiveness to prompt deprescribing 
conversations between PLWD experiencing CNS-active polypharmacy and their 
primary care clinicians ("clinicians").
METHODS: We used the electronic health record to identify PLWD prescribed 
CNS-active polypharmacy in primary care clinics from two health systems. Clinics 
were assigned to intervention (n = 10) or control (n = 12), with PLWD in 
intervention clinics mailed an educational brochure to prompt discussion with 
clinicians about the appropriateness of their CNS-active regimen. We conducted 
chart reviews for evidence of documentation related to these medications and 
used the electronic health record (EHR) to assess preliminary effectiveness 120 
days after sending the brochure (e.g., number of CNS-active medications 
prescribed, change in total standardized daily dose [TSDD] of CNS-active 
medications, and change in prevalence of CNS-active polypharmacy). We 
interviewed 10 clinicians from intervention clinics to assess their perceptions 
about the acceptability of the intervention.
RESULTS: PLWD in the intervention group (n = 61) and control group (n = 68) had 
an average age of 72.4 years (standard deviation [SD] 9.7), 62.8% were female, 
and 84.5% were white. We did not find any documented evidence of conversations 
related to CNS-active medications between PLWD who received the brochure and 
their primary care clinicians. After 120 days, there was no significant 
between-group difference in the mean number of CNS-active medications prescribed 
(- 1.0 [SD 1.3] versus - 1.0 [SD 1.3]), mean TSDD (- 1.6 [SD 6.0] versus - 1.3 
[SD 5.8]), or the percentage of patients with CNS-active polypharmacy (52.6% 
versus 50.4%). Interviews with clinicians suggested they were aware that 
combinations of CNS-active medications were not ideal; however, they reported 
inheriting patients who were already on these medications, and they did not have 
sufficient clinic time or access to safer alternatives to overcome patient 
hesitation to deprescribe.
CONCLUSIONS: A direct-to-patient mailed educational brochure did not demonstrate 
feasibility in provoking deprescribing conversations between PLWD and clinicians 
or preliminary effectiveness in decreasing CNS-active polypharmacy.

This review explores the intricate connections between Drosophila models and the 
human blood-brain barrier (BBB) with nanoparticle-based approaches for 
neurological treatment. Drosophila serves as a powerful model organism due to 
its evolutionary conservation of key biological processes, particularly in the 
context of the BBB, which is formed by glial cells that share structural and 
functional similarities with mammalian endothelial cells. Recent advancements in 
nanoparticle technology have highlighted their potential for effective drug 
delivery across the BBB, utilizing mechanisms such as passive diffusion, 
receptor-mediated transcytosis, and carrier-mediated transport. The ability to 
engineer nanoparticles with specific physicochemical properties-such as size, 
surface charge, and functionalization-enhances their targeting capabilities, 
particularly towards astrocytes, which play a crucial role in maintaining BBB 
integrity and responding to neuroinflammation. Insights gained from Drosophila 
studies have informed the design of personalized nanomedicine strategies aimed 
at treating neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's 
disease etc. As research progresses, the integration of findings from Drosophila 
models with emerging humanized BBB systems will pave the way for innovative 
therapeutic approaches that improve drug delivery and patient outcomes in 
neurological disorders.

Aging is the most common risk factor for Multiple Sclerosis (MS) disease 
progression. Cellular senescence, the irreversible state of cell cycle arrest, 
is the main driver of aging and has been found to accumulate prematurely in 
neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. 
Cellular senescence in the central nervous system of MS patients has recently 
gained attention, with several studies providing evidence that demyelination 
induces cellular senescence, with common hallmarks of p16INK4A and p21 
expression, oxidative stress, and senescence-associated secreted factors. Here 
we discuss the current evidence of cellular senescence in animal models of MS 
and different glial populations in the central nervous system, highlighting the 
major gaps in the field that still remain. As premature senescence in MS may 
exacerbate demyelination and inflammation, resulting in inhibition of myelin 
repair, it is critical to increase understanding of cellular senescence in vivo, 
the functional effects of senescence on glial cells, and the impact of removing 
senescent cells on remyelination and MS. This emerging field holds promise for 
opening new avenues of treatment for MS patients.

OBJECTIVES: To explore interrelations between cognitive, physical, affective, 
and daily functioning, quality of life and white matter hyperintensities (WMH) 
in a geriatric memory clinic sample.
METHOD: Participants received brain imaging, comprehensive geriatric assessment 
and neuropsychological evaluation including measurements of cognitive, physical, 
affective, and daily functioning and health-related quality of life. Data was 
analyzed using multiple linear regressions and network analysis using 
(moderated) mixed graphical models.
RESULTS: The total sample included 932 patients (age: 79.6 ± 6.0, 49% women). In 
regression analyses, severe WMH (Fazekas 3) was associated with decreased 
cognitive (attention/speed, language) and physical functioning, more apathy 
symptoms and more (instrumental) activities of daily living dependency (All β's 
-0.40 to -0.24). Within the network analysis, daily functioning was directly 
associated with memory, attention/speed, and gait speed, while quality of life 
was associated with gait speed and affective functioning. WMH had no direct 
network associations with domains of functioning.
CONCLUSION: Cognitive, physical, and affective changes associated with severe 
WMH co-occur with decreased daily functioning and lower quality of life in a 
geriatric memory clinic sample. However, relationships between domains of 
functioning are independent of WMH. This warrants a holistic and symptom-based 
approach in clinical care and post-diagnostic support.

INTRODUCTION: Improving sleep in murine Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated 
with reduced brain amyloidosis. However, the window of opportunity for 
successful sleep-targeted interventions, regarding the reduction in pathological 
hallmarks and related cognitive performance, remains poorly characterized.
METHODS: Here, we enhanced slow-wave activity (SWA) during sleep via sodium 
oxybate (SO) oral administration for 2 weeks at early (6 months old) or 
moderately late (11 months old) disease stages in Tg2576 mice and evaluated 
resulting neuropathology and behavioral performance.
RESULTS: We observed that the cognitive performance of 6-month-old Tg2576 mice 
significantly improved upon SO treatment, whereas no change was observed in 
11-month-old mice. Histochemical assessment of amyloid plaques demonstrated that 
SO-treated 11-month-old Tg2576 mice had significantly less plaque burden than 
placebo-treated ones, whereas ELISA of insoluble protein fractions from brains 
of 6-month-old Tg2576 mice indicated lower Aβ-42/Aβ-40 ratio in SO-treated group 
vs. placebo-treated controls.
DISCUSSION: Altogether, our results suggest that SWA-dependent reduction in 
brain amyloidosis leads to alleviated behavioral impairment in Tg2576 mice only 
if administered early in the disease course, potentially highlighting the key 
importance of early sleep-based interventions in clinical cohorts.

BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has a high risk of progression to 
Alzheimer's disease. The disease is often accompanied by sleep disorders, and 
whether sleep disorders have an effect on brain function in patients with MCI is 
unclear.
AIM: To explore the near-infrared brain function characteristics of MCI with 
sleep disorders.
METHODS: A total of 120 patients with MCI (MCI group) and 50 healthy subjects 
(control group) were selected. All subjects underwent the functional 
near-infrared spectroscopy test. Collect baseline data, Mini-Mental State 
Examination, Montreal Cognitive Assessment scale, fatigue severity scale (FSS) 
score, sleep parameter, and oxyhemoglobin (Oxy-Hb) concentration and peak time 
of functional near-infrared spectroscopy test during the task period. The 
relationship between Oxy-Hb concentration and related indexes was analyzed by 
Pearson or Spearmen correlation.
RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the FSS score of the MCI group was 
higher (t = 11.310), and the scores of Pittsburgh sleep quality index, sleep 
time, sleep efficiency, nocturnal sleep disturbance, and daytime dysfunction 
were higher (Z = -10.518, -10.368, -9.035, -10.661, -10.088). Subjective sleep 
quality and total sleep time scores were lower (Z = -11.592, -9.924). The sleep 
efficiency of the MCI group was lower, and the awakening frequency, rem sleep 
latency period, total sleep time, and oxygen desaturation index were higher (t = 
5.969, 5.829, 2.887, 3.003, 5.937). The Oxy-Hb concentration at T0, T1, and T2 
in the MCI group was lower (t = 14.940, 11.280, 5.721), and the peak time was 
higher (t = 18.800, 13.350, 9.827). In MCI patients, the concentration of Oxy-Hb 
during T0 was negatively correlated with the scores of Pittsburgh sleep quality 
index, sleep time, total sleep time, and sleep efficiency (r = -0.611, -0.388, 
-0.563, -0.356). It was positively correlated with sleep efficiency and total 
sleep time (r = 0.754, 0.650), and negatively correlated with oxygen 
desaturation index (r = -0.561) and FSS score (r = -0.526). All comparisons were 
P < 0.05.
CONCLUSION: Patients with MCI and sleep disorders have lower near-infrared brain 
function than normal people, which is related to sleep quality. Clinically, a 
comprehensive assessment of the near-infrared brain function of patients should 
be carried out to guide targeted treatment and improve curative effect.

BACKGROUND: Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are complex compounds that 
play a critical role in neurological disorders, including the pathogenesis of 
Alzheimer's disease. Methylglyoxal (MG) is recognized as the primary precursor 
of AGEs. Methylglyoxal is produced endogenously and also introduced through 
dietary exposures.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate and compare the effects of 
aminoguanidine (AG), semicarbazide (SC), and thiosemicarbazide (TSC) on 
MG-induced neurological toxicity in rats.
METHODS: Male Wistar rats were exposed orally to MG, MG + AG, MG + SC, and MG + 
TSC for 70 days. Neurobehavioral, biochemical, and histopathological changes 
were evaluated.
RESULTS: The findings indicated that oral administration of MG for 70 days 
resulted in memory impairment and increased anxiety in neurobehavioral tests. 
Additionally, MG elevated protein carbonylation in brain tissues. Semicarbazide 
was found to prevent MG-induced memory problems, while both SC and AG reduced 
carbonyl content in brain tissues. Aminoguanidine and TSC were effective in 
alleviating anxiety induced by MG exposure. Histopathological analysis revealed 
that MG caused cell damage and neuronal necrosis in the hippocampus, 
particularly in the cornu ammonis 1 and 3 (CA1 and CA3) and AG, SC, and TSC 
improved neuronal survival specifically in the CA1 and DG areas.
CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that SC, AG, and TSC may offer neuroprotective 
effects against MG-induced neurobehavioral toxicity. Further studies are 
required to explore the mechanisms of action of these compounds.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, characterized by 
progressive cognitive decline. Cholinesterase inhibitors are commonly used to 
manage symptoms but have limited efficacy as the disease progresses. Aducanumab, 
a monoclonal antibody targeting amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, has emerged as a novel 
therapeutic approach. Despite its Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, 
its efficacy and safety remain contentious, particularly following the European 
Medicines Agency's (EMA's) rejection. This systematic review aims to evaluate 
the efficacy, safety, and clinical outcomes of aducanumab in treating mild 
AD. Adhering to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA) 2020 
guidelines, we conducted a comprehensive search of PubMed and Science Direct 
databases, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, and 
case-control studies focusing on aducanumab versus placebo in mild AD. Studies 
were screened based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, and data 
were extracted on clinical outcomes, biomarkers, and neuroimaging markers. The 
risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Handbook and Newcastle-Ottawa 
Scale. Out of 967 identified records, seven studies met the inclusion criteria. 
Findings indicated a dose-dependent reduction in Aβ plaques with aducanumab, but 
clinical outcomes varied. High-dose aducanumab (10 mg/kg) demonstrated 
significant improvements in some studies but not others. Adverse events, notably 
amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), were frequent, especially at 
higher doses. The studies exhibited heterogeneous treatment effects and 
underscored the potential of cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers as an alternative to 
amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) scans. Aducanumab shows promise in 
reducing Aβ plaques and has potential clinical benefits at high doses; however, 
its safety profile, particularly concerning ARIA, remains a significant concern. 
The variability in clinical efficacy highlights the need for further research to 
optimize dosing regimens and identify patient populations most likely to benefit 
from treatment. Future studies should focus on refining treatment protocols and 
exploring alternative biomarkers to improve therapeutic outcomes for AD.

BACKGROUND: Early detection of brain amyloidosis (Aβ+) is crucial for diagnosing 
Alzheimer'disease (AD) and optimizing patient management, especially in light of 
emerging treatments. While plasma biomarkers are promising, their combined 
diagnostic value through specific ratios remains underexplored. In this study, 
we assess the diagnostic accuracy of plasma pTau isoform (pTau181 and pTau217) 
to Aβ42 ratios in detecting Aβ+ status.
METHODS: This study included 423 participants from the multicenter prospective 
ALZAN cohort, recruited for cognitive complaints. Aβ+ status was determined 
using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. The confirmatory cohort comprises 
1,176 patient samples from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI), with Aβ+ status determined by positron emission tomography (PET) 
imaging. Plasma biomarkers (pTau181, pTau217, Aβ40, Aβ42) were measured using 
immunoassays and mass spectrometry, with specific ratios calculated. In the 
ALZAN cohort, the impact of confounding factors such as age, renal function, 
ApoE4 status, body mass index, and the delay between blood collection and 
processing was also evaluated to assess their influence on biomarker 
concentrations and diagnostic performance. The primary outcome was the 
diagnostic performance of plasma biomarkers and their ratios for detecting Aβ+ 
status. Secondary outcomes in the ALZAN cohort included the proportion of 
patients classified as low, intermediate, or high risk for Aβ+ using a 
two-cutoff approach.
FINDINGS: In ALZAN the pTau181/Aβ42 ratio matched the diagnostic performance of 
pTau217 (AUC of 0.911 (0.882-0.940) vs. 0.909 (0.879-0.939), P=0.85). The 
pTau217/Aβ42 ratio demonstrated the highest diagnostic accuracy, with an AUC of 
0.927 (0.900-0.954). Both ratios effectively mitigated confounding factors, such 
as variations in renal function, and were also efficient in identifying Aβ+ 
status in individuals with early cognitive decline. Diagnostic accuracy of 
ratios vs. individual measurement was confirmed in the ADNI cohort. In ALZAN, 
using two-cutoff workflows with pTau217/Aβ42 instead of pTau217 alone reduced 
the intermediate-risk zone from ∼16% to ∼8%, enhancing stratification for 
clinical decision-making.
INTERPRETATION: The pTau217/Aβ42 ratio demonstrated improved diagnostic 
performance for detecting Aβ+ compared to individual biomarkers, potentially 
reducing diagnostic uncertainty. These findings suggest that plasma biomarker 
ratios could be useful; however, further validation in independent and diverse 
clinical settings is necessary before broader clinical implementation.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT: Evidence before this study: Blood biomarkers of Alzheimer's 
disease are receiving increasing attention, as they have great potential for 
non-invasive detection of the presence of cerebral amyloidosis (Aβ+), one of the 
key elements in the diagnosis of the disease. Among these biomarkers, the 
phosphorylated isoforms of the tau protein, principally the pTau217 form, show 
performances that suggest major interest for clinical use. In addition, a number 
of studies have demonstrated the value of calculating ratios such as Aβ42/40 or 
pTau181/Aβ42 in CSF and blood, thereby eliminating the variability associated 
with pre-analytical or physiological confounding factors, such as renal failure. 
However, studies directly comparing ratios with individual markers remain 
limited.Added value of this study: In the prospective real-life ALZAN cohort of 
cognitively impaired participants we show that plasma pTau181/Aβ42 and 
pTau217/Aβ42 ratios outperform individual biomarkers for the detection of Aβ+ 
status established from CSF. This result was confirmed for pTau217/Aβ42 in the 
ADNI cohort in which detection of Aβ+ status is done with PET. The ratios also 
show greater resistance to confounding factors such as impaired renal function 
or delays in sample processing. Finally, by using an approach based on the use 
of two cutoffs enabling effective population Aβ+ risk stratification, the ratios 
help to reduce the number of inconclusive situations.Implications of all the 
available evidence: Taking previous studies into account, our results strengthen 
the case for using tau and amyloid ratios, and in particular the plasma 
pTau217/Aβ42 ratio, in the detection of Aβ+ status. These ratios not only 
improve detection accuracy but also help to take confounding factors into 
account. Ultimately, they could encourage wider use of routine blood tests, 
making diagnosis earlier, guiding therapeutic decisions while potentially 
reducing the use of procedures such as lumbar punctures or PET imaging.

Postoperative delirium is the most common postsurgical complication in older 
adults and is associated with an increased risk of long-term cognitive decline 
and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD). However, the 
neurological basis of this increased risk-whether postoperative delirium unmasks 
latent preoperative pathology or leads to AD-relevant pathology after 
perioperative brain injury-remains unclear. Recent advancements in neuroimaging 
techniques now enable the detection of subtle brain features or damage that may 
underlie clinical symptoms. Among these, Neurite Orientation Dispersion and 
Density Imaging (NODDI) can help identify microstructural brain damage, even in 
the absence of visible macro-anatomical abnormalities. To investigate potential 
brain microstructural abnormalities associated with postoperative delirium and 
cognitive function, we analyzed pre- and post-operative diffusion MRI data from 
111 patients aged ≥60 years who underwent non-cardiac/non-intracranial surgery. 
Specifically, we investigated preoperative variation in diffusion metrics within 
the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), a region in which prior work has 
identified glucose metabolism alterations in the delirious brain, and a key 
region in the early accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) in preclinical AD. We also 
examined the relationship of preoperative PCC NODDI abnormalities with 
preoperative cognitive function. Compared to patients who did not develop 
postoperative delirium (n=99), we found increased free water (FISO) and neurite 
density index (NDI) and decreased orientation dispersion index (ODI) in the 
dorsal PCC before surgery among those who later developed postoperative delirium 
(n=12). These FISO differences before surgery remained present at six weeks 
postoperatively, while these NDI and ODI differences did not. Preoperative 
dorsal PCC NDI and ODI values were also positively associated with preoperative 
attention/concentration performance, independent of age, education level, and 
global brain atrophy. Yet, these diffusion metrics were not correlated with 
cerebrospinal fluid Aβ positivity or levels. These results suggest that 
preoperative latent brain abnormalities within the dorsal PCC may underlie 
susceptibility to postoperative delirium, independent of AD-related (i.e., Aβ) 
neuropathology. Furthermore, these preoperative microstructural differences in 
the dorsal PCC were linked to preoperative deficits in attention/concentration, 
a core feature of postoperative delirium. Our findings highlight microstructural 
vulnerability within the PCC, a key region of the default mode network, as a 
neuroanatomic locus that can help explain the link between preoperative 
attention/concentration deficits and increased postoperative delirium risk among 
vulnerable older surgical patients.

INTRODUCTION: Accurately assessing temporal order of cognitive decline across 
multiple domains is critical in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Existing literature 
presented controversial conclusions likely due to the use of a single cohort and 
different analytical strategies.
METHODS: Harmonized composite cognitive measures in memory, language and 
executive functions from 13 cohorts in the ADSP-PHC data are used. A novel 
double anchoring events-based sigmoidal mixed model was developed using time to 
the incident of AD diagnosis as the time scale.
RESULTS: Decline in memory occurred before decline in language which was 
followed by the decline in executive function. Throughout the entire AD 
continuum, APOE-ε4 non-carriers and non-Hispanic Whites showed better memory 
performance, respectively, in all three cognitive domains.
DISCUSSION: Using harmonized data across multiple cohorts is the key to 
accurately characterizing the temporal order of AD biomarkers. Time to incident 
AD diagnosis should be used as the time scale for reproducibility purposes.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent type of dementia. Treatments for 
AD do not reverse the loss of brain function; rather, they decrease the rate of 
cognitive deterioration. Current treatments are ineffective in part because they 
do not address neurotrophic mechanisms, which are believed to be critical for 
functional recovery. Given that structural losses are assumed to be the root 
cause of cognitive impairment in AD, strengthening neurotrophic pathways may be 
a useful preventative therapeutic approach. Insulin-like growth factor-2 (IGF2), 
which is widely expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), has emerged as a 
crucial mechanism of synaptic plasticity and learning and memory, and many 
studies have indicated that this neurotrophic peptide is a viable candidate for 
treating and preventing AD-induced cognitive decline. An increase in IGF2 levels 
improves memory in healthy animals and alleviates several symptoms associated 
with neurodegenerative disorders. These effects are primarily caused by the IGF2 
receptor, which is widely expressed in neurons and controls protein trafficking, 
synthesis, and degradation. However, the use of IGF2 as a potential target for 
the development of novel pharmaceuticals to treat AD-induced memory impairment 
needs further investigation. We compiled recent studies on the role of IGF2 in 
AD-associated memory issues and summarized the current knowledge regarding IGF2 
expression and function in the brain, specifically in AD-induced memory 
impairment.

β-Amyloid (Aβ) aggregation is the major pathological feature of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), resulting in oxidative stress and further exacerbating Aβ 
aggregation. Ginger leaf polyphenols (GLP) have been found to possess 
antioxidant activity, evidencing their potential in addressing AD. GLP is mainly 
composed of 12 polyphenols, 8 organic acids, and 6 glycosides, of which 
polyphenols are predominantly composed of apigenin, kaempferol, and quercetin 
derivatives. Moreover, GLP alleviates reproductive toxicity, longevity toxicity, 
and neurotoxicity induced by Aβ via regulating the antioxidase system in 
Caenorhabditis elegans. As shown by the network pharmacology results, GLP might 
activate the JNK/Foxo signaling pathway to regulate the antioxidase system, 
which was evidenced by the up-regulation of gene expression levels of jnk-1, 
daf-16, sod-3, and hsp-16.2. Overall, GLP might be a potential antioxidant for 
combating AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder affecting the 
elderly. The imbalance of protein production and degradation processes leads to 
the accumulation of misfolded and abnormally aggregated amyloid-beta (Aβ) in the 
extracellular space and forms senile plaques, which constitute one of the most 
critical pathological hallmarks of AD. KIF9, a member of the kinesin protein 
superfamily, mediates the anterograde transport of intracellular cargo along 
microtubules. However, the exact role of KIF9 in AD pathogenesis remains largely 
elusive. In this study, we reported that the expression of kinesin family member 
9 (KIF9) in the hippocampus of APP23/PS45 double-transgenic AD model mice 
declined in an age-dependent manner, concurrent with macroautophagy dysfunction. 
Furthermore, we found that KIF9 mediated the transport of lysosomes through 
kinesin light chain 1 (KLC1), thereby participating in the degradation of 
amyloidogenic pathway-related proteins of Aβ precursor protein (APP) in AD model 
cells through promoting the macroautophagy pathway. Importantly, genetic 
upregulation of KIF9 via adeno-associated virus (AAV) diminished Aβ deposition 
and alleviated cognitive impairments in AD model mice by enhancing 
macroautophagy function. Collectively, our findings underscore the ability of 
KIF9 to promote macroautophagy through KLC1-mediated anterograde transport of 
lysosomes, effectively ameliorating cognitive dysfunction in AD model mice. 
These discoveries suggest that KIF9 may represent a novel therapeutic target for 
the treatment of AD.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: TMEM16A chloride channels constitute a depolarising 
mechanism in arterial smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and contractile cerebral 
pericytes. TMEM16A pharmacology is incompletely defined. We elucidated the mode 
of action and selectivity of a recently identified positive allosteric modulator 
of TMEM16A (PAM_16A) and of a range of TMEM16A inhibitors. We also explore the 
consequences of selective modulation of TMEM16A activity on arterial and 
capillary function.
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Patch-clamp electrophysiology, isometric tension 
recordings, live imaging of cerebral cortical capillaries and assessment of cell 
death were employed to explore the effect of selective pharmacological control 
of TMEM16A on vascular function.
KEY RESULTS: In low intracellular free Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i), nanomolar 
concentrations of PAM_16A activated heterologous TMEM16A channels, while being 
almost ineffective on the closely related TMEM16B channel. In either the absence 
of Ca2+ or in saturating [Ca2+]i, PAM_16A had no effect on TMEM16A currents at 
physiological potentials. PAM_16A selectively activated TMEM16A currents in SMCs 
and enhanced aortic contraction caused by phenylephrine or angiotensin-II and 
capillary (pericyte) constriction evoked by endothelin-1 or oxygen-glucose 
deprivation (OGD) to simulate cerebral ischaemia. Conversely, selective TMEM16A 
inhibition with Ani9 facilitated aortic, mesenteric and pericyte relaxation, and 
protected against OGD-mediated pericyte cell death. Unlike PAM_16A and Ani9, a 
range of other available modulators were found to interfere with endogenous 
cationic currents in SMCs.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Arterial tone and capillary diameter can be 
controlled with TMEM16A modulators, highlighting TMEM16A as a target for 
disorders with a vascular component, including hypertension, stroke, Alzheimer's 
disease and vascular dementia.

Impaired glycemic control increases the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Heat therapy (HT), via hot water immersion (HWI), has 
shown promise in improving shared mechanisms implicated in both T2D and AD, like 
blood glucose regulation, insulin sensitivity, and inflammation. The potential 
for HT to improve brain health in individuals at risk for AD has not been 
examined. This pilot study aimed to assess the feasibility and adherence of 
using HT in cognitively healthy older individuals at risk for AD due to existing 
metabolic risk factors. Participants underwent 4 wk of HT (three sessions/week) 
via HWI, alongside cognitive screening, self-reported sleep characterization, 
glucose tolerance tests, and MRI scans pre- and postintervention. A total of 18 
participants (9 males, 9 females; mean age: 71.1 ± 3.9 yr), demonstrating 
metabolic risk, completed the intervention. Participant adherence for the study 
was 96% (8 missed sessions out of 216 total sessions), with one study-related 
mild adverse event (mild dizziness/nausea). Overall, the research participants 
responded to a postintervention survey saying they enjoyed participating in the 
study and it was not a burden on their schedules. Secondary outcomes of the HT 
intervention demonstrated significant changes in mean arterial pressure, 
diastolic blood pressure, and cerebral blood flow (P < 0.05), with a trend 
toward improved body mass index (P = 0.06). Future studies, including longer 
durations and a thermoneutral control group, are needed to fully understand heat 
therapy's impact on glucose homeostasis and the potential to improve brain 
health.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Our pilot study demonstrated promising results for heat 
therapy (HT) via hot water immersion in older adults at risk for Alzheimer's 
disease due to metabolic factors. Despite a relatively short intervention, 
significant improvements in mean arterial pressure, diastolic blood pressure, 
and cerebral blood flow postintervention were observed. High participant 
adherence, overall satisfaction, and minimal adverse events suggest HT's 
feasibility. These findings highlight HT's potential as an effective alternative 
intervention for cardiometabolic dysfunction in at-risk populations.

BACKGROUND: The growing aging population has led to an increase in the 
prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and osteoporosis (OP), both of which 
significantly impair quality of life. The comorbid nature of these conditions 
suggests a shared genetic etiology, the understanding of which is crucial for 
developing targeted therapies.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the shared genetic etiology underlying AD 
and OP, using a system biology approach to identify potential therapeutic 
targets and natural compounds for treatment.
METHODS: We employed Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) with 
molecular docking strategies to uncover the genetic links between AD and OP. 
MT2A and CACNA1C were identified as key pleiotropic hub genes potentially 
linking AD and OP. Molecular docking was utilized to screen for compounds with 
therapeutic potential, leading to the identification of formononetin as a 
compound with significant binding affinity to these hub genes. Quantitative 
real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) validation was conducted to confirm the gene expression 
changes in disease models.
RESULTS: Our study indicate that formononetin exhibits strong binding affinity 
to the identified hub genes, MT2A and CACNA1C. qRT-PCR validation confirmed the 
upregulation of these genes in disease models, which was mitigated upon 
treatment with formononetin, suggesting a reversal of disease markers.
CONCLUSIONS: This study advances our understanding of the genetic intersections 
between AD and OP and positions formononetin as a promising natural agent for 
further translational research. Formononetin's multi-target potential makes it a 
valuable candidate for managing these comorbid conditions, meriting further 
investigation and development as a therapeutic strategy.

β-Secretase-1 (BACE1) plays a key role in the regulation of cerebral amyloid-β 
homeostasis, being involved in amyloidogenic and, as recently found, 
amyloidolytic pathways. Growing evidence indicates that increased serum BACE1 
(sBACE1) activity might represent an early biomarker for Alzheimer's disease. 
Here, we tested the hypothesis that an increase in sBACE1 activity may already 
occur in individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD). We found that 
sBACE1 activity was significantly higher in individuals with SCD (n 118) 
compared to cognitively normal subjects (controls, n 137) (p < 0.001). Moreover, 
compared with SCD, sBACE1 activity was even higher in patients affected by 
amnestic (n 179) or non-amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (n 99) 
(p < 0.001 and p 0.02, respectively). In all cases, the respective increase in 
sBACE1 activity was significant after adjustment for possible confounders 
including age, sex, and comorbidities. We also found a significant sexual 
dimorphism, with women affected by either type of MCI, but not by SCD, having 
higher levels of serum BACE1 activity compared to men. These results provide 
evidence supporting the potential use of sBACE1 activity as tool for blood-based 
screening of cognitively healthy individuals at clinical risk of MCI and 
dementia.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease is caused by modifiable and non-modifiable risk 
factors. Randomised controlled trials have investigated whether the strongest 
genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, APOE4, impacts the effectiveness of 
exercise on health. Systematic reviews are yet to evaluate the effect of 
exercise on physical and cognitive outcomes in APOE genotyped participants. A 
quality assessment of these randomised controlled trials is needed to understand 
the impact genotype has on the potential success of intervention. This 
systematic review aimed to determine if the APOE4 genotype influences the 
effectiveness of exercise-based randomised controlled trials.
METHOD: Searches on MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO identified eligible exercise 
based randomised controlled trials incorporating participants with varied 
cognitive abilities. Quality assessments were conducted.
RESULTS: Nineteen studies met the inclusion criteria for systematic review, and 
3 for the meta-analysis. Very low to moderate quality evidence showed that APOE4 
carriers benefitted more than APOE4 non-carriers on cognitive (e.g. executive 
function, learning) and physical (e.g. relative telomere length) outcomes after 
exercise; and that APOE4 non-carriers benefited over carriers for physical 
(serum BDNF, gait speed) and cognitive (global cognition, verbal memory) 
markers. Very low quality evidence indicated that there was no evidence of 
difference between APOE4 carriers and non-carriers on physical function outcomes 
in meta-analysis. Several areas of study design and reporting, including 
maintenance of relative exercise intensity and complete statistical reporting, 
were identified as needing improvement.
DISCUSSION: This systematic review found very limited evidence to suggest that 
exercise interventions can benefit APOE4 carriers and non-carriers equally, 
though conclusions were limited by evidence quality. Further randomised 
controlled trials, stratifying participants by APOE status are required to 
better understand the relationship between APOE genotype and the effect of 
exercise on health-related outcomes.

RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Cognitive disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
and Parkinson's disease (PD), significantly impact the quality of life in older 
adults. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a critical stage for intervention and 
can predict the development of dementia. The causes of these two diseases are 
not fully understood, but there is an overlap in their neuropathology. There is 
a lack of direct comparison regarding the changes in functional connectivity 
within and between different brain networks during cognitive impairment in these 
two diseases.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate changes in brain network connectivity 
of AD and PD with mild cognitive impairment, shedding light on the underlying 
neuropathological mechanisms and potential treatment options.
METHODS: A total of 33 AD-MCI patients, 55 PD-MCI patients, and 34 healthy 
controls (HCs) underwent resting-state functional MRI and cognitive function 
assessment using Independent Components Analysis (ICA). We compared intra- and 
inter-network functional connectivity among the three groups and analyzed the 
correlation between changes in functional connectivity and cognitive domain 
performance.
RESULTS: Using ICA, we identified eight functional networks. In the AD-MCI 
group, reductions in internetwork functional connectivity were mainly around the 
default mode network (DMN). Intra-network functional connectivity was widely 
reduced, especially in the DMN, while intra-network functional connectivity in 
the Salience Network (SN) increased. In contrast, in the PD-MCI group, 
reductions in internetwork functional connectivity were mainly around the SN. 
Intra-network functional connectivity in the SN decreased, while intra-network 
functional connectivity in other networks increased.
CONCLUSION: This study highlights distinct yet overlapping changes in brain 
network connectivity in AD and PD, providing new insights into the underlying 
mechanisms of cognitive impairment disorders.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease, and 
neuroprotection is an important approach to improving AD outcomes. Rhizoma of 
Anemarrhena asphodeloides (RAA) is a commonly used Traditional Chinese Medicine 
(TCM) with demonstrated neuroprotective effects, but its anti-AD mechanism 
requires further exploration.
AIM OF THE STUDY: To elucidate the neuroprotective mechanism of RAA on 
TMT-induced AD mice.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The AD mice model was established via intraperitoneal 
injection of TMT. The effect of RAA on ameliorating learning and memory was 
assessed using the Morris Water Maze (MWM) and Y-maze tests. Haematoxylin-Eosin 
(HE), Nissl, and TUNEL staining were used to observe the neuroprotective effect 
of RAA. The components in serum containing RAA (RAA-S) were detected using 
UPLC-Q-Orbitrap MS. Potential targets were predicted through network 
pharmacology and molecular docking. Serum levels of reactive oxygen species 
(ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), and 
glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were measured with ELISA kits. The HT22 hippocampal 
neuronal cell line injured by l-glutamate (L-Glu) was used to further elucidate 
the mechanism of RAA. ROS levels in HT22 cells were detected with the 
2'-7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) fluorescent probe and flow 
cytometry. Apoptosis in HT22 cells was measured by flow cytometry. The proteins 
MAP2, GAP-43, Nrf2, Keap1, HO-1, Bax, and Bcl-2 were detected by Western 
blotting. Immunofluorescence staining was employed to observe Nrf2 nuclear 
translocation.
RESULTS: RAA significantly increased the residence time of mice in the W zone 
and enhanced the correct alternation rate in TMT-treated mice. RAA preserved the 
integrity and orderly arrangement of nerve cells. A total of 12 components were 
detected in RAA-S. AKT1, PPARG, CASP3, STAT3, HSP90AA1, and NFE2L2 (Nrf2) were 
involved in the RAA-S target pathway network. Molecular docking revealed that 
Nrf2 exhibited the highest average binding energy with all components in RAA-S. 
In vivo, RAA elevated MAP2, GAP-43, Nrf2, and HO-1 levels, along with GPx, GSH, 
and SOD activity, which had been reduced by TMT. Additionally, RAA reduced serum 
levels of MDA and ROS, which had been elevated by TMT. In vitro, RAA-S reduced 
HT22 cell apoptosis and ROS accumulation caused by TMT. Furthermore, RAA-S 
promoted the expression of N-Nrf2 and HO-1 in L-Glu-injured HT22 cells.
CONCLUSION: RAA attenuated oxidative stress induced by TMT and L-Glu in AD model 
mice. The underlying mechanism was associated with the activation of the 
Nrf2/Keap1-HO-1 pathway.

OBJECTIVES: To assess recent trends in antipsychotic use among older adults with 
Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRDs) according to their residential 
status and determine the factors associated with the use of antipsychotics.
DESIGN: Population-based, cross-sectional study using Texas Medicare 
Fee-for-Service data.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged ≥ 65 years with ADRDs who had at 
least 3 months of Medicare Part A and B, and Part D for prescription drug 
coverage, in any year between 2015 and 2020.
METHODS: Temporal trends for antipsychotic use were reported by calendar year, 
and the associations between antipsychotic use and potential predictors were 
assessed overall and by residential status.
RESULTS: Among an annual average of 161,848 older adults with ADRDs (median age, 
82 years; 64.8% female), overall antipsychotic use decreased by 25.8%, from 
14.5% in 2015 to 10.8% in 2020. The decline was primarily observed among those 
with any nursing facility (NF) residence, where use dropped from 22.1% to 12.4%, 
whereas community-dwelling individuals maintained a steady rate of approximately 
10%. Factors associated with increased antipsychotic use included male sex, 
Black and Hispanic individuals, dual eligibility, Alzheimer's disease 
(non-Alzheimer's disease), emergency department visits, hospitalization, 
depression, and anxiety disorders. However, these associations varied across 
residential statuses. Older age was more strongly associated with decreased 
antipsychotic use among those with NF residence than those in the community. 
Compared with white individuals, Black individuals were more likely to receive 
antipsychotics in the community, whereas Hispanic and Asian individuals were 
more likely to receive antipsychotics among those with NF residence.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Although antipsychotic use substantially decreased 
among those with NF residence, it remained steady among community-dwelling 
individuals. Given that two-thirds of individuals with dementia reside in the 
community, more attention is needed to understand antipsychotic use in this 
population.

Alzheimer's disease is a chronic complex neurodegenerative disease characterized 
with amyloid plaques and loss of neurons. TGF-β1 is important growth factor, 
plays critical roles in cell metabolism, tissue homeostasis, neuronal 
development, and synaptic plasticity. In this study, we aimed to examine the 
effect of TGF-β1 on the regulation of α, β, and γ-secretase enzymes, Aβ-40 
accumulation, apoptosis, and neuronal damage in an experimental 
Scopolamine-induced AD-like model. The subjects were divided into 5 groups such 
as control, sham, TGF-β1 control, Scopolamin group, TGF-β1 treatment groups.Then 
all groups were divided into 2 subgroups according to 28th-56th days. Except for 
Morris water maze (MWM) test, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex tissues were 
taken for light-electron microscopic, immunohistochemical, and biochemical 
examinations. It was observed that learning and memory abilities, which 
decreased in the MWM test of the Scopolamine group, increased in the treatment 
groups. In addition, α-secretase expression decreased in the Scopolamin group, 
while it increased in the TGF-β1 treatment group. It was determined that Aβ-40 
and caspase-3 immunoreactivity, β and γ-secretase enzyme levels increased in the 
Scopolamin group and decreased in TGF-β1 treatment group. Cellular degenerations 
were relatively decreased in TGF-β1 treatment group. It was thought that TGF-β1 
might have a therapeutic effect on Alzheimer's disease by increasing memory 
performance and preventing Aβ-40 accumulation in the AD-like model induced by 
Scopolamine and also, may be effective preventing neuronal damage by 
down-regulating caspase-3 expression. When all the findings evaluated together, 
it was concluded that TGF-β1 could be evaluated as a therapeutic agent in 
Alzheimer's disease.

The traditional model of protein structure determined by the amino acid sequence 
is today seriously challenged by the fact that approximately half of the human 
proteome is made up of proteins that do not have a stable 3D structure, either 
partially or in totality. These proteins, called intrinsically disordered 
proteins (IDPs), are involved in numerous physiological functions and are 
associated with severe pathologies, e.g. Alzheimer, Parkinson, 
Creutzfeldt-Jakob, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and type 2 diabetes. 
Targeting these proteins is challenging for two reasons: i) we need to preserve 
their physiological functions, and ii) drug design by molecular docking is not 
possible due to the lack of reliable starting conditions. Faced with this 
challenge, the solutions proposed by artificial intelligence (AI) such as 
AlphaFold are clearly unsuitable. Instead, we suggest an innovative approach 
consisting of mimicking, in short synthetic peptides, the conformational 
flexibility of IDPs. These peptides, which we call adaptive peptides, are 
derived from the domains of IDPs that become structured after interacting with a 
ligand. Adaptive peptides are designed with the aim of selectively antagonizing 
the harmful effects of IDPs, without targeting them directly but through 
selected ligands, without affecting their physiological properties. This "target 
the target, not the arrow" strategy is promised to open a new route to drug 
discovery for currently undruggable proteins.

Neurodegenerative disorders arise when nerve cells in the brain or peripheral 
nervous system gradually lose functions and eventually die. Although certain 
therapies may alleviate some of the physical and mental symptoms associated with 
neurodegenerative disorders, hence slowing their progression, but no sure-shot 
treatment is currently available. It was shown that the rise in life expectancy 
and the number of elderly people in the community led to an increasing trend in 
the incidence and prevalence of neurodegenerative disease. Phytomolecules are 
demonstrating their effectiveness in combating, regression, and delaying various 
diseases. Genistein is one of soy isoflavone with antioxidant, 
anti-inflammatory, and estrogenic effects. Researchers demonstrated that 
Genistein treatment significantly reduced hyperglycemia, improved cognitive 
performance by modulating acetylcholinesterase activity and oxidative stress, 
and alleviated neuroinflammatory conditions in mice. This paper evaluates (in

BACKGROUND: Preventive medications are potential targets for deprescribing in 
older adults with dementia as goals of care change from preventive to 
palliative. Yet, prescribers lack communication guidance to address 
deprescribing.
OBJECTIVE: Using bisphosphonates as a case example, we sought to characterize 
and compare communication preferences of prescribers and family/informal 
caregivers regarding deprescribing.
METHODS: We conducted 23 semi-structured interviews with prescribers (12) and 
caregivers (11) of older adults with Alzheimer's disease or related dementias 
(ADRD). Prescribers and caregivers were asked to provide their impressions of 
seven conversation starters for discussing deprescribing, focusing on a case 
example using bisphosphonates. These phrases focused on topics including life 
expectancy, treatment burden, adverse effects, and costs. We used a qualitative 
framework analysis to identify relevant themes as prescribers and caregivers 
discussed their general perceptions of the potential benefits and harms of 
bisphosphonates and experiences with deprescribing.
RESULTS: Among prescribers, there were ten physicians and two nurse 
practitioners; most (nine) female and white. Among caregivers, eight were 
female, seven were white, and five were Latino/a. For both prescribers and 
caregivers, preferred conversation starters initiated a risk versus benefit 
discussion, emphasizing medication adverse effects and patient-specific factors, 
such as functional status and indication for treatment. While prescribers 
emphasized discussing common medication adverse effects, caregivers noted the 
importance of knowing a medication's potential impact on ADRD. The least 
preferred conversation starter for deprescribing among both groups focused on 
the extra effort and cost of continuing bisphosphonates. Discordance between 
caregivers and prescribers were identified in several phrases; notably, 
caregivers disliked statements that introduced discussions of prognosis and life 
expectancy.
CONCLUSIONS: Deprescribing conversations may be best perceived by caregivers 
when introduced with a discussion of a medication's adverse effects and 
potential impact on cognition. In addition, deprescribing conversations should 
be tailored to patient-specific factors, including functional status, goals of 
care, and the role of their caregiver in medical decision-making. Avoiding 
discussions of medication cost, pill burden, and life expectancy may help 
reassure the caregiver that deprescribing is a form of medication optimization 
and not a withdrawal of care.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains incurable, yet its long prodromal 
phase offers a crucial window for early intervention. Pretangle tau, a precursor 
to neurofibrillary tangles, plays a key role in early AD pathogenesis. 
Intervening in pretangle tau pathology could significantly delay the progression 
of AD. The gut-brain axis, increasingly recognized as a contributor to AD, 
represents a promising therapeutic target due to its role in regulating 
neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. While probiotics have shown cognitive 
benefits in amyloid-centered AD models, their effect on pretangle tau pathology 
remains elusive.
METHODS: This study evaluates the effects of probiotics in a rat model of 
preclinical AD, specifically targeting hyperphosphorylated pretangle tau in the 
locus coeruleus. TH-CRE rats (N = 47; 24 females and 23 males) received either 
AAV carrying pseudophosphorylated human tau (htauE14) or a control virus at 3 
months of age. Probiotic or control diets were administered at 9-12 months, with 
blood and fecal samples collected for ELISA and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. 
Behavioral assessments were conducted at 13-14 months, followed by analysis of 
brain inflammation, blood-brain barrier integrity, and GSK-3β activation.
RESULTS: Rats expressing pseudophosphorylated tau displayed impairment in 
spatial Y-maze (F1,39 = 4.228, p = 0.046), spontaneous object location (F1,39 = 
6.240, p = 0.017), and olfactory discrimination (F1,39 = 7.521, p = 0.009) 
tests. Phosphorylation of tau at S262 (t3 = -4.834) and S356 (t3 = -3.258) in 
the locus coeruleus was parallelled by GSK-3β activation in the hippocampus 
(F1,24 = 10.530, p = 0.003). Probiotic supplementation increased gut microbiome 
diversity (F1,31 = 8.065, p = 0.007) and improved bacterial composition (F1,31 = 
3.4867, p = 0.001). The enhancement in gut microbiomes was associated with 
enhanced spatial learning (p < 0.05), reduced inflammation indexed by Iba-1 
(F1,25 = 5.284, p = 0.030) and CD-68 (F1,26 = 8.441, p = 0.007) expression, and 
inhibited GSK-3β in female rats (p < 0.01 compared to control females).
CONCLUSIONS: This study underscores the potential of probiotics to modulate the 
gut-brain axis and mitigate pretangle tau-related pathology in preclinical AD. 
Probiotic supplementation could offer a novel early intervention strategy for 
AD, highlighting the pivotal role of gut health in neurodegeneration.

With advancements in veterinary care and the growing recognition of pets as 
integral member of the family, the lifespans of dogs and cats have significantly 
increased, leading to a higher prevalence of age-related conditions, including 
cognitive dysfunction syndrome (CDS). CDS adversely impacts pets' quality of 
life and presents emotional and practical challenges for owners. Given its 
similarities to Alzheimer's disease in humans, CDS has gained attention as a 
target for nutrition-based interventions aimed at preserving cognitive function. 
This systematic review evaluates the efficacy of enriched diets and 
nutraceuticals in improving cognition in aging companion animals. A literature 
search was conducted using PubMed, CAB Abstracts, Web of Science, and Dimensions 
to identify clinical trials published in English that investigated the effects 
of enriched diets or nutraceuticals on cognitive functions in aged cats or dogs. 
Study quality was assessed using a modified CAMARADES checklist. A total of 30 
studies (27 canine and 2 feline trials) published between 2002 and 2023 were 
reviewed. Studies on enriched diets generally demonstrated higher methodological 
quality compared to those on supplements. Omega-3 fatty acids showed cognitive 
benefits in aging pets, especially at higher doses, while antioxidants from 
plant extracts and products and vitamins E and C alone were less effective but 
remain essential for stabilizing omega-3 fatty acids. Other supplements, 
including S-adenosyl methionine, medium-chain triglycerides, homotaurine, and 
apoaequorin, also showed promise. However, future studies must standardize 
protocols, include robust control groups, and utilize both objective tasks and 
subjective questionnaires to strengthen conclusions.

Cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease (AD) correlates closely with 
pathology in the neuronal microtubule-associated protein tau. Tau pathology may 
spread via neural synapses. In a population of cognitively unimpaired elderly at 
elevated risk of AD, we investigated four cerebrospinal (CSF) markers of 
synaptic dysfunction and degeneration. Three of these (SYT1, SNAP25, and ADAM23) 
are derived from pre-synaptic structures, while ADAM22 reflects post-synaptic 
changes. All four markers correlated strongly with tau protein measures. In 
statistical models, SYT1 accounted for more than half the total variance in both 
total- and P(181)-tau levels. Observed correlations with CSF levels of Alzheimer 
amyloid-β (Aβ42) were somewhat weaker. In longitudinal data, baseline levels of 
ADAM22 and ADAM23 robustly predicted increase over time in both total- and 
P-tau. CSF SYT1 levels also correlated with PET image uptake of tau and (at a 
trend level) Aβ in areas of interest for early AD pathology. CSF SYT1 and SNAP25 
levels correlated inversely with a global psychometric score and several of its 
domain subscales. In quantitative trait loci analyses, all four synaptic markers 
were associated with at least one AD genetic risk locus. Upon "staging" 
participants by their evidence of amyloid and tau pathology (A/T/N framework), 
the CSF synaptic markers were unexpectedly reduced in participants with CSF 
evidence of amyloid but not tau pathology. They were clearly elevated, however, 
in the CSF of persons with indications of both tau and amyloid pathology. These 
observations provide evidence for clear pre-synaptic degeneration in cognitively 
unimpaired persons with biomarker evidence of early AD pathology.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration, 
marked by the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles. Emerging 
evidence suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a pivotal role in AD 
pathogenesis, driven by impairments in mitochondrial quality control (MQC) 
mechanisms. MQC is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial integrity through 
processes such as proteostasis, mitochondrial dynamics, mitophagy, and precise 
communication with other subcellular organelles. In AD, disruptions in these 
processes lead to bioenergetic failure, gene dysregulation, the accumulation of 
damaged mitochondria, neuroinflammation, and lipid homeostasis impairment, 
further exacerbating neurodegeneration. This review elucidates the molecular 
pathways involved in MQC and their pathological relevance in AD, highlighting 
recent discoveries related to mitochondrial mechanisms underlying 
neurodegeneration. Furthermore, we explore potential therapeutic strategies 
targeting mitochondrial dysfunction, including gene therapy and pharmacological 
interventions, offering new avenues for slowing AD progression. The complex 
interplay between mitochondrial health and neurodegeneration underscores the 
need for innovative approaches to restore mitochondrial function and mitigate 
the onset and progression of AD.

BACKGROUND: Healthy Actions and Lifestyles to Avoid Dementia Program (HALT-AD) 
or Hispanos y el ALTo a la Demencia is a recently-developed online educational 
platform to help individuals identify and modify their own dementia modifiable 
risk factors (MRF). In light of known challenges in recruiting and retaining 
diverse participants in research studies, there is a need to identify 
data-informed strategies that will contribute to effective outreach and tailored 
implementation of HALT-AD among its intended users of Hispanic and non-Hispanic 
midlife and older adults in the US.
OBJECTIVES: To identify factors (i.e, demographic, medical, psychosocial and 
environmental) that may facilitate or impede effective program enrollment and 
participation.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study SETTING: Data from an online and self-administered 
survey conducted between January and April 2023 PARTICIPANTS: Residents of 
California, predominately San Diego, who were 50 to 85 years old, with no 
dementia or Alzheimer's disease, proficient in English or Spanish and with 
enough technical ability to complete the survey electronically (n=157; 43% 
Hispanic). INTERVENTION (IF ANY): none MEASUREMENTS: RedCap was used to capture 
answers to closed and open-ended survey questions. Mixed-methods analysis was 
used: For quantitative data, descriptive statistics, comparisons by group 
(Hispanic/non-Hispanic), and exploratory factor analysis were conducted in SPSS. 
Thematic analysis with open coding in Excel was used for qualitative responses.
RESULTS: Independent of ethnicity, participants' most preferred method of reach 
for recruitment was through a conversation with their doctor or with a family 
member or friend. Their least preferred method was receiving a Facebook 
advertisement especially among non-Hispanics. Interest in program participation 
did not differ by sociodemographic characteristics or self-rated satisfaction 
with individualized MRFs. Instead, having higher confidence in one's ability to 
commit to behavior change was significantly associated with higher interest in 
program participation. While a common theme to motivate both groups to 
participate was the potential to decrease dementia risk, non-Hispanics were 
motivated by the premise of supporting research and having a positive user 
experience. For program implementation, Hispanics were more likely to be 
interested in participating if live sessions, either online or in-person, were 
provided to offer support with making lifestyle changes as adjunct to completing 
online courses independently. In both groups, participation may be further 
facilitated by offering wearable devices which provide participants with 
feedback on lifestyle change progress.
CONCLUSIONS: A "one-size-fits-all" approach to recruitment and implementation of 
HALT-AD may not be effective in enrolling and retaining participants in future 
studies or for clinical use. Instead, a tailored approach that accounts for 
personal and ethnically-dependent preferences may be more beneficial.

recommendations of 150 min/wk is difficult for older adults, particularly among 
those living with frailty and its associated risk of dementia. We examined the 
dose-response relationship between MVPA and dementia risk among at-risk persons 
living with and without frailty enrolled in the UK Biobank study.
DESIGN: Survival analysis within a prospective cohort study.
SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: Participants at risk for all-cause dementia who wore 
an Axivity AX3 triaxial wrist-worn accelerometer between February 2013 and 
December 2015.
METHODS: MVPA was estimated from wrist-worn accelerometry in a subpopulation of 
the UK Biobank study. A modified version of the physical frailty phenotype was 
used to define frailty. Associations between MVPA dose (including interactions 
with frailty) and first-time incident dementia were analyzed using Cox 
regression models. MVPA was treated continuously and categorically across 5 
levels to estimate the dose-response curve. Models were adjusted for 
demographics, frailty status, and comorbidities.
RESULTS: This study included 89,667 adults (median age, 63 years; 56% women), 
with 735 participants developing dementia over an average of 4.4 years. Average 
weekly MVPA was 126 minutes. Each 30 minutes higher MVPA was associated with a 
4% reduction in the risk of all-cause dementia (hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 
0.93-0.99). The hazard ratios for engaging in 0-34.9, 35-69.9, 70-139.9, and 
≥140 MVPA minutes per week were 0.59, 0.40, 0.37, and 0.31, respectively (P < 
.05 for all) compared with 0 MVPA minutes per week. All associations were 
similar across frailty status (interaction P for all models > .21).
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Our results suggest engaging in any additional 
amount of MVPA reduces dementia risk, with the highest benefit appearing among 
individuals with no MVPA. These associations are not substantially modified by 
frailty status.

Recent studies have shown that neuroinflammation and heightened glial activity, 
particularly astrocyte overactivation, are associated with Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). Abnormal accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) induces endoplasmic reticulum 
(ER) stress and activates astrocytes. Artemisinin (ART), a frontline 
anti-malarial drug, has been found to have neuroprotective properties. However, 
its impact on astrocytes remains unclear. In this study, we used Aβ1-42 induced 
astrocyte cultures and 3 × Tg-AD mice as in vitro and in vivo models, 
respectively, to investigate the effects of ART on AD related astrocyte 
overactivation and its underlying mechanisms. ART attenuated Aβ1-42-induced 
astrocyte activation, ER stress, and inflammatory responses in astrocyte 
cultures by inhibiting IRE1 phosphorylation and the NF-κB pathway, as evidenced 
by the overexpression of IRE1 WT and IRE1-K599A (kinase activity invalidated), 
along with application of activators and inhibitors related to ER stress. 
Furthermore, ART alleviated the detrimental effects and restored neurotrophic 
function of astrocytes on co-cultured neurons, preventing neuronal apoptosis 
during Aβ1-42 treatment. In 3 × Tg-AD mice, ART treatment improved cognitive 
function and reduced astrocyte overactivation, neuroinflammation, ER stress, and 
neuronal apoptosis. Moreover, ART attenuated the upregulation of IRE1/NF-κB 
pathway activity in AD mice. Astrocyte-specific overexpression of IRE1 via 
adeno-associated virus in AD mice reversed the ameliorating effects of ART. Our 
findings suggest that ART inhibits astrocyte overactivation and 
neuroinflammation in both in vitro and in vivo AD models by modulating the 
IRE1/NF-κB signaling pathway, thereby enhancing neuronal functions. This study 
underscores the therapeutic potential of ART in AD and highlights the 
significance of modulating the ER stress-inflammatory cycle and normalizing 
astrocyte-neuron communication.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent form of dementia, 
remains enigmatic in its origins despite the widely accepted "amyloid 
hypothesis," which implicates amyloid-beta peptide aggregates in its 
pathogenesis and progression. Despite advancements in technology and healthcare, 
the incidence of AD continues to rise. The traditional drug development process 
remains time-consuming, often taking years to bring an AD treatment to market. 
Drug repurposing has emerged as a promising strategy for developing 
cost-effective and efficient therapeutic options by identifying new uses for 
existing approved drugs, thus accelerating drug development.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to examine two key drug repurposing methodologies 
in general diseases and specifically in AD, which are artificial intelligent 
(AI) approach and molecular docking approach. In addition, the hybrid approach 
that integrates AI with molecular docking techniques will be explored too.
METHODOLOGY: This study systematically compiled a comprehensive collection of 
relevant academic articles, scientific papers, and research studies which were 
published up until November 2024 (as of the writing of this review paper). The 
final selection of papers was filtered to include studies related to Alzheimer's 
disease and general diseases, and then categorized into three groups: AI 
articles, molecular docking articles, and hybrid articles.
RESULTS: As a result, 331 papers were identified that employed AI for drug 
repurposing in general diseases, and 58 papers focused specifically in AD. For 
molecular docking in drug repurposing, 588 papers addressed general diseases, 
while 46 papers were dedicated to AD. The hybrid approach combining AI and 
molecular docking in drug repurposing has 52 papers for general diseases and 9 
for AD. A comparative review was done across the methods, results, strengths, 
and limitations in those studies. Challenges of drug repurposing in AD are 
explored and future prospects are proposed.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Drug repurposing emerges as a compelling and 
effective strategy within AD research. Both AI and molecular docking methods 
exhibit significant potential in this domain. AI algorithms yield more precise 
predictions, thus facilitating the exploration of new therapeutic avenues for 
existing drugs. Similarly, molecular docking techniques revolutionize 
drug-target interaction modelling, employing refined algorithms to screen 
extensive drug databases against specific target proteins. This review offers 
valuable insights for guiding the utilization of AI, molecular docking, or their 
hybrid in AD drug repurposing endeavors. The hope is to speed up the timeline of 
drug discovery which could improve the therapeutic approach to AD.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this systematic review was to synthesize evidence 
from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) regarding the efficacy of music-based 
interventions (MBIs) in improving anxiety and depression in older adults with 
dementia.
METHODS: Relevant RCTs were identified through searches in electronic databases, 
including PubMed, Embase, EBSCOhost, Scopus, Web of Science, APA PsycINFO, and 
Google. The Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (RoB 2) was 
used to evaluate the risk of bias in the included trials. A narrative synthesis 
of the included trials was conducted.
RESULTS: Nine RCTs involving 496 patients met the inclusion criteria; five 
trials evaluated the efficacy of MBIs for anxiety, and six trials evaluated 
their efficacy for depression in older adults with dementia. Of the nine trials, 
two reported significant improvements in anxiety in older adults with dementia 
following MBIs (Cohen's d = -1.71 to -2.48), while one trial reported 
significant improvements in depression (Cohen's d = -0.66).
CONCLUSIONS: Only a few trials support the efficacy of MBIs in alleviating 
negative emotions in older adults with dementia, as evidenced by three out of 
the nine trials. However, due to the small sample sizes and heterogeneity in 
dementia types, stages, and interventions, quantitative results were not pooled, 
making it challenging to draw reliable conclusions. Further validation and 
examination of the findings presented in this study are warranted to strengthen 
the evidence base for integrating MBIs into dementia care and treatment 
protocols.

Repeated traumatic brain injury has grown in importance as sports-related 
injuries have increased. Repetitive mild TBI (rmTBI) increases the risk of 
developing neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's 
diseases, as well as chronic comorbidities like PTSD, depression, substance 
abuse and neuroendocrine functions. However, no effective therapeutic strategies 
have been reported for the effective management of TBI. Herein, we examined the 
effectiveness of co-delivery of the phytonutrients curcumin, trans-resveratrol, 
and carnosic acid as a bioavailable complex (CGM+) in managing rmTBI in the 
rodent model. The rats were randomly assigned to sham, rmTBI, and 
CGM+ (300 mg/kg b.wt.) groups for a total of 21 days. On Days 6 and 7, all 
animals, except those in the sham group, were subjected to repeated mild 
traumatic brain injury (rmTBI). The CGM+ group received supplementation 
throughout the 21 days, while the other groups received a vehicle. Neurological 
severity score (NSS) was assessed 24 h after the last injury, and behavioral 
tests were completed within 14 days post-injury. Samples for the biochemical 
analysis were collected after euthanasia. CGM+ supplementation significantly 
decreased the sensory-motor deficits associated with rmTBI. Following TBI, the 
CGM+ group demonstrated enhanced memory and low-stress levels. Furthermore, 
CGM+ has been shown to modulate neurotransmitter levels and promote 
neurogenesis. The biochemical and molecular analysis revealed that CGM+ promotes 
recovery following rmTBI by modulating mitochondrial bioenergetics and BDNF 
pathways. The findings indicate that CGM+ can be used to manage cognitive and 
sensory-motor defects caused by rmTBI, such as in the case of sports injuries.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the association of systemic inflammation 
measured by plasma biomarkers with the change in cognitive function among 
participants from the Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial (MAPT) exposed to 
the multidomain intervention (MI). Secondary analysis of the MAPT longitudinal 
data. MAPT is a randomized, placebo-controlled trial with 3 interventional 
groups (omega-3 only, MI only, omega-3 plus MI) and a control group. We tested 
the association of the change in cognitive function with inflammatory biomarkers 
(tumoral necrosis factor receptor-1 (TNFR1), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 
(MCP1), Growth Differentiation Factor-15 (GDF15), Interleukin-6 (IL6) and C 
reactive protein (CRP)) using mixed-effects models. A subgroup analysis was 
performed in those exposed to the MI. The response to the MI was defined as the 
change in the composite cognitive score over the 2-year clinical follow-up 
period. by modeling the response to the intervention and identifying "good 
responders", i.e., those in the 5th quintile of response at the end of the 
intervention period (2 years after the measurement of inflammatory markers). We 
included 1,527 participants (mean age 75.3, SD = 4.4; 64% female). Higher levels 
of GDF15 and TNFR1 were associated with a worse trajectory in the cognitive 
composite score in adjusted models. "Good responders" had an estimated mean 
change in the composite score of 0.051 (SD 0.062) over two years of 
intervention, compared to -0.136 (SD = 0.111) for the "not-good responders". 
Higher IL6 levels were associated with a decreased likelihood of being a "good 
responder" (OR = 0.22, p = 0.018, 95% CI 0.06; 0.78), with similar results for 
CRP (OR = 0.48, p = 0.009, 95% CI 0.28; 0.84). Higher inflammation was 
associated with a worse cognitive trajectory among nondemented participants and 
a lower likelihood of being classified as a "good responder" in those receiving 
a MI. Further confirmation of these findings could lead to the use of systemic 
inflammation as inclusion or stratification criteria in prevention trials.

Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease 
with the age at which characteristic symptoms manifest strongly influenced by 
inherited HTT CAG length. Somatic CAG expansion occurs throughout life and 
understanding the impact of somatic expansion on neurodegeneration is key to 
developing therapeutic targets. In 57 HD gene expanded (HDGE) individuals, ~23 
years before their predicted clinical motor diagnosis, no significant decline in 
clinical, cognitive or neuropsychiatric function was observed over 4.5 years 
compared with 46 controls (false discovery rate (FDR) > 0.3). However, 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers showed very early signs of neurodegeneration 
in HDGE with elevated neurofilament light (NfL) protein, an indicator of 
neuroaxonal damage (FDR = 3.2 × 10-12), and reduced proenkephalin (PENK), a 
surrogate marker for the state of striatal medium spiny neurons 
(FDR = 2.6 × 10-3), accompanied by brain atrophy, predominantly in the caudate 
(FDR = 5.5 × 10-10) and putamen (FDR = 1.2 × 10-9). Longitudinal increase in 
somatic CAG repeat expansion ratio (SER) in blood was a significant predictor of 
subsequent caudate (FDR = 0.072) and putamen (FDR = 0.148) atrophy. Atypical 
loss of interruption HTT repeat structures, known to predict earlier age at 
clinical motor diagnosis, was associated with substantially faster caudate and 
putamen atrophy. We provide evidence in living humans that the influence of CAG 
length on HD neuropathology is mediated by somatic CAG repeat expansion. These 
critical mechanistic insights into the earliest neurodegenerative changes will 
inform the design of preventative clinical trials aimed at modulating somatic 
expansion. ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT06391619 .

Histone acetylation is the process by which histone acetyltransferases (HATs) 
add an acetyl group to the N-terminal lysine residues of histones, resulting in 
a more open chromatin structure. Histone acetylation tends to increase gene 
expression more than methylation does. In the central nervous system (CNS), 
histone acetylation is essential for controlling the expression of genes linked 
to cognition and learning. Histone deacetylases (HDACs), "writing" enzymes 
(HATs), and "reading" enzymes with bromodomains that identify and localize to 
acetylated lysine residues are responsible for maintaining histone acetylation. 
By giving animals HDAC inhibitors (HDACis), it is possible to intentionally 
control the ratios of "writer" and "eraser" activity, which will change the 
acetylation of histones. In addition to making the chromatin more accessible, 
these histone acetylation alterations re-allocate the targeting of "readers," 
including the transcriptional co-activators, cAMP response element-binding 
protein (CBP), and bromodomain-containing protein 4 (Brd4) in the CNS. 
Conclusive evidence has shown that HDACs slow down the progression of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) by reducing the amount of histone acetylation, 
decreasing the activity of genes linked to memory, supporting cognitive decline 
and Amyloid beta (Aβ) protein accumulation, influencing aberrant tau 
phosphorylation, and promoting the emergence of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). 
In this review, we have covered the therapeutic targets and functions of HDACs 
that might be useful in treating AD.

Schizophrenia is a chronic and severe mental disorder. It is currently treated 
with antipsychotic drugs (APD). However, APD's work only in a limited number of 
patients and may have cognition impairing side effects. A growing body of 
evidence points out the potential involvement of abnormal sphingolipid 
metabolism in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Here, an analysis of human 
gene polymorphisms and brain gene expression in schizophrenia patients 
identified an association of SMPD1 and SMPD3 genes coding for acid- (ASM) and 
neutral sphingomyelinase-2 (NSM). In a rat model of psychosis using amphetamine 
hypersensitization, we found a locally restricted increase of ASM activity in 
the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Short-term haloperidol (HAL) treatment reversed 
behavioral symptoms and the ASM activity. A sphingolipidomic analysis confirmed 
an altered ceramide metabolism in the PFC during psychosis. Targeting enhanced 
ASM activity in a psychotic-like state with the ASM inhibitor KARI201 reversed 
psychotic like behavior and associated changes in the sphingolipidome. While 
effective HAL treatment led to locomotor decline and cognitive impairments, 
KARI201 did not. An RNA sequencing analysis of the PFC suggested a dysregulation 
of numerous schizophrenia related genes including Olig1, Fgfr1, Gpr17, Gna12, 
Abca2, Sox1, Dpm2, and Rab2a in the rat model of psychosis. HAL and KARI201 
antipsychotic effects were associated with targeting expression of other 
schizophrenia associated genes like Col6a3, Slc22a8, and Bmal1, or Nr2f6a, 
respectively, but none affecting expression of sphingolipid regulating genes. 
Our data provide new insight into a potentially pathogenic mechanism of 
schizophrenia and suggest a new pharmaco-treatment strategy with reduced side 
effects.

BACKGROUND: Older adults with mild behavioral impairment (MBI) are at the higher 
risk of developing dementia compared to those without MBI, leading to decreased 
quality of life (QoL). Addressing MBI in older adults provides valuable 
opportunities to prevent dementia.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the effects of traditional Thai folk 
dance combined with a cognitive stimulation program on MBI, QoL, subjective 
cognitive decline (SCD), and cognitive functioning in older Thai adults.
DESIGN: Single-blinded, two-armed, randomized controlled trial, with a 
three-month follow-up period.
SETTING: Outpatient chronic disease clinics at two districts in Suphan Buri 
province, Thailand.
PARTICIPANTS: One-hundred twenty-eight older adults with MBI were randomly 
assigned to either the experimental (n = 64) and cognitive education control 
group (n = 64).
INTERVENTION: The 14-session, 7-week traditional Thai folk-dance program 
combined with cognitive stimulation focused on enhanced moderate intensity 
physical activity and cognitive stimulation engagement to improve MBI of older 
adults.
MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was MBI assessed using Mild Behavioral 
Impairment Checklist. Secondary outcomes were QoL, SCD, and cognitive tests of 
memory and executive functions.
RESULTS: Compared to the control group, participants in the experimental group 
demonstrated significantly reduced MBI (p <.01), improved QoL (p <.01), 
decreased SCD (p <.01), and enhanced cognitive functioning (p <.01) after the 
7-week intervention and at the 12-week follow-up.
CONCLUSION: The traditional Thai folk dance combined with cognitive stimulation 
improved outcomes related to early signs of dementia and enhanced the overall 
QoL of older adults.

Different neurological diseases including, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and 
Huntington's diseases extant momentous global disease burdens, affecting 
millions of lives for imposing a heavy disease burden on the healthcare systems. 
Despite various treatment strategies aimed at alleviating symptoms, treatments 
remain elusive and ineffective due to the disease's complexity. However, recent 
advancements in gene therapy via the CRISPR-Cas system offer ground-breaking and 
targeted treatment options. Based on a bacterial immune mechanism, the 
CRISPR-Cas system enables precise genome editing, allowing for the alteration of 
different genetic mutations and the possible cure of genetic diseases. In the 
context of neurological disorders, the CRISPR-Cas system shows a promising 
avenue by allowing researchers to conduct genome-editing which is implicated in 
neurodegenerative disease therapeutics. This book chapter provides an updated 
overview of the application of the CRISPR-Cas system for addressing 
target-specific therapeutic approaches for neurodegenerative disorders. 
Furthermore, we discuss the principles of the CRISPR-Cas mechanism, its role in 
modeling neurological disorders, identifying molecular targets, and developing 
gene-based therapies. Additionally, the chapter explores the recent clinical 
trials and CRISPR-Cas-mediated treatments for neurological conditions. By 
leveraging the accuracy and versatility of the CRISPR-Cas system, scientists can 
more effectively handle the genetic underpinnings of neurodegenerative diseases. 
Furthermore, the chapter extends the critical viewpoints on ethical 
considerations and technical limitations related to the clinical deployment of 
this revolutionizing technique.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by 
cognitive decline and memory loss. A critical aspect of AD pathology is 
represented by oxidative stress, which significantly contributes to neuronal 
damage and death. Microglia and astrocytes, the primary glial cells in the 
brain, are crucial for managing oxidative stress and supporting neuronal 
function. Carnosine is an endogenous dipeptide possessing a multimodal mechanism 
of action that includes antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-aggregant 
activities. The present study investigated the effects of Aβ1-42 oligomers 
(oAβ), small aggregates associated with the neurodegeneration observed in AD, on 
primary rat mixed glia cultures composed of both microglia and astrocytes, 
focusing on the ability of these detrimental species to induce oxidative stress. 
We assessed intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) 
levels as markers of oxidative stress. Exposure to oAβ significantly elevated 
both ROS and NO intracellular levels compared to control cells. However, this 
effect was completely inhibited by the pre-treatment of mixed cultures with 
carnosine, resulting in ROS and NO levels similar to those observed in untreated 
(control) cells. Single-cell analysis of cellular responses to oAβ revealed 
heterogeneous ROS production, resulting in two distinct clusters of cells, one 
of which was very responsive to the treatment. The presence of carnosine 
counteracted the overproduction of ROS, also leading to a single, homogeneous 
cluster, similar to that observed in the case of control cells. Interestingly, 
unlike ROS response, single-cell analysis of NO production did not show any 
distinct clusters. Overall, our findings demonstrated the ability of carnosine 
to mitigate Aβ-induced oxidative stress in mixed glia cells, by rescuing ROS and 
NO intracellular levels, as well as to normalize the heterogeneous response to 
the treatment measured in terms of clusters' formation. The present study 
suggests a therapeutic potential of carnosine in pathologies characterized by 
oxidative stress including AD.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a major global health challenge, largely due to its 
complex pathology and the limited effectiveness of existing treatments. 
Quercetin, a bioactive compound belonging to the flavonoid class, its promising 
antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects in addressing AD. 
However, its therapeutic potential is hindered by challenges such as low 
bioavailability, instability, and restricted permeability across the blood-brain 
barrier (BBB). Advances in nanotechnology have paved the way for 
quercetin-functionalized nanomaterials, offering solutions to these challenges. 
These nanostructures enhance quercetin's solubility, stability, and targeted 
brain delivery, thereby augmenting its therapeutic potential. In this review, 
nanocarriers (like liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, and metal-based 
nanosystems) are explored for their potential application in optimizing 
quercetin delivery in AD management. It discusses the mechanisms by which these 
nanostructures enhance BBB penetration and exert neuroprotective effects. 
Furthermore, the review examines the outcomes of preclinical and in vitro 
studies, while addressing the challenges of scaling these approaches for 
clinical application. By merging the fields of nanotechnology and 
neurotherapeutics, the importance of quercetin-functionalized nanomaterials in 
advancing AD management strategies is underscored in this review.

OBJECTIVE: The study objective was to compare sex and racial differences in 
180-day infection rates after coronary artery bypass grafting and aortic valve 
replacement.
METHODS: A statewide Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database 
was linked to Medicare claims data to identify 8887 beneficiaries undergoing 
coronary artery bypass grafting and aortic valve replacement (surgical or 
transcatheter) between 2017 and 2021. The primary outcome was the incidence of 
180-day infection. Secondary outcomes included 10 infection subtypes. 
Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the relationship between 
sex and race (Black vs non-Black) and infections. Two secondary analyses were 
conducted: (1) robustness of the primary analysis after excluding urinary tract 
infections given established sex-related differences and (2) testing a sex∗race 
interaction.
RESULTS: The mean (SD) age of the cohort was 74.5 (8.9) years, with 36.9% female 
and 4.2% Black. The infection rate was 19.6%, although this varied by patient 
sex (female vs male: 23.7% vs 17.1%) and race (Black vs non-Black: 28.0% vs 
19.2%), both P less than .0001. Differences in infection rates for female 
patients were driven by urinary tract infections and pneumonia for Black 
patients. Risk-adjusted odds of infection were 1.6-fold significantly higher 
among female patients but nonsignificant for Black patients. A sex∗race 
interaction was present, with non-Black female patients versus non-Black male 
patients having a 1.63 higher odds of infection.
CONCLUSIONS: This multicenter study identified a 1.6-fold higher odds of 
infection among female patients. Non-Black female versus male patients had a 63% 
higher odds of infection. Transdisciplinary collaborative learning interventions 
should be considered to address these known disparities in infection rates.

Compared to the general population, individuals with Down syndrome carry a much 
higher genetic risk of developing early onset Alzheimer's dementia. This leads 
to unique challenges and the need for a targeted patient journey.In a 
qualitative interview study with medical professionals, patient organisations 
and formal and informal care persons, we assessed barriers within the medical 
care process of this patient group as well as current approaches to overcome 
these problems. The study is one module of a multi-method project founded by the 
Innovation Fund of the German Joint Commission. The results presented here focus 
on access to and transitions within the medical care process. 14 guided 
interviews were conducted by a team of moderators by video conference, recorded 
and transcribed. The analysis of the results was carried out as a qualitative 
content analysis based on the methods of Mayring.Given the varying degree of 
premorbid intellectual disability, difficulties recognizing dementia symptoms 
were reported leading to delays in initiating the diagnostic process. Limited 
knowledge of the special disease risk and symptom manifestation in routine 
medical care as well as the lack of specialized medical institutions were 
identified as additional hurdles. Insufficient dissemination of information 
about existing specialised institutions to regular physicians and caregivers was 
criticized. All stakeholder groups drew attention to limitations in access to 
occupational and speech therapy because of the inadequate number of specialized 
therapists. Improvements suggested by the interview partners focussed on topics 
such as the implementation of guidance of the patient journey to and within the 
medical care process by one institution, easily accessible information for 
patients and caregivers as well as optimised training for physicians in routine 
care.Barriers such as insufficient availability of specialised service providers 
and information deficits about the specific disease risks and symptoms of the 
population have also been identified in international literatur; in addition, 
management and coordination deficits in the fragmented German health care system 
represent well known additional barriers. Approaches to improve the situation 
can be seen, on the one hand, in improved information and training offers for 
caregivers and service providers, and, on the other hand, in the expansion of 
the range of specialized service providers, in particular the Medical Centres 
for Adults with Disabilities. Informed by these study results and the results of 
other project modules, health policy recommendations for the improvement of the 
patient journey of patients with Down syndrome and dementia will be developed in 
the last project module.

Herausforderungen sowie die Notwendigkeit einer zielgruppenspezifischen Patient 
Journey.In einer Interviewstudie mit medizinischen Leitungserbringenden, 
Vertreter:innen von Selbsthilfeorganisationen und Wohn- und Arbeitseinrichtungen 
als Baustein des Innovationsfondsprojektes „DS-Demenz“ wurden Hürden im 
medizinischen Versorgungsprozess der Zielgruppe und Ansätze zu ihrer Überwindung 
erhoben. Die vorgestellten Ergebnisse fokussieren auf Zugang zur und 
Schnittstellengestaltung in der medizinischen Versorgung. 14 leitfadengestützte 
Interviews wurden von einem Moderator:innenteam per Videokonferenz durchgeführt, 
aufgezeichnet und transkribiert. Die Auswertung erfolgte über eine qualitative 
Inhaltsanalyse in Anlehnung an Mayring.Im Zugang zur Diagnostik wurde von 
Verzögerungen durch Schwierigkeiten bei der Symptomerkennung der Alzheimer 
Demenz aufgrund der Variabilität des kognitiven Ausgangsniveaus und der in dem 
Zusammenhang fehlenden Sachkunde der Untersucher:innen berichtet. Entsprechend 
zeigten sich bei Erstzugang und Weiterleitung im Rahmen der Patient Journey 
Hürden aufgrund häufig begrenzter medizinischer Kenntnisse über 
Erkrankungsrisiko und -ausprägung in der Regelversorgung sowie eines 
unzureichenden Angebots und fehlender Bekanntheit spezialisierter 
Leistungserbringender. Auch in der Heilmitteltherapie wurde ein unzureichendes 
Angebot spezialisierter Leistungserbringender deutlich. Ein Schwerpunkt der 
Verbesserungsvorschläge lag auf einer gezielteren Patient:innensteuerung durch 
das Versorgungssystem und einfach zugänglicher Information für Patient:innen und 
ihre Betreuenden sowie auf einer verbesserten Schulung der Ärzt:innen.Die 
identifizierten Hürden entsprechen sowohl den in der internationalen Literatur 
genannten Hürden wie dem unzureichenden Angebot an spezialisierten 
Leistungserbringenden und Informationsdefiziten über die spezifischen 
Krankheitsrisiken und Symptomatiken der Population als auch den bekannten 
Steuerungs- und Koordinationsdefiziten des fragmentierten deutschen 
Gesundheitssystems. Lösungsansätze sind einerseits in verbesserten Informations- 
und Schulungsangeboten für Betreuende und Leistungserbringende, andererseits 
aber in der Verbreiterung des Angebots spezialisierter Leistungserbringender, 
hier insbesondere der Medizinischen Zentren für Erwachsene mit Behinderung 
(MEZB), zu sehen. Diese Lösungsansätze gehen im weiteren Verlauf des 
Forschungsprojekts in die Entwicklung gesundheitspolitischer 
Handlungsempfehlungen ein, um die Versorgungssituation Betroffener nachhaltig zu 
optimieren.

The rise of antimicrobial resistance has made necessary the increase of the 
antibacterial arsenal against multidrug-resistant bacteria. In this context, 
colistin has re-emerged as a first-line antibiotic in critical situations 
despite its nephro- and neuro- toxicity at peripheral level. However, the 
mechanism underlying its toxicity remains unknown, particularly in relation to 
the central nervous system (CNS). Therefore, this study aimed to characterize 
the molecular mechanisms underlying colistin-induced neurotoxicity in the CNS 
through a combination of in vitro and in vivo molecular studies along with 
several in vivo behavioral tests. Following colistin treatment, mice exhibited a 
significant reduction in body weight together with renal impairment, and 
locomotor dysfunction. Moreover, our results demonstrated that colistin 
disrupted the blood-brain barrier, inducing astrogliosis, and triggering 
apoptosis-related processes probably through the accumulation of reactive oxygen 
species (ROS) and mitochondrial dysfunction. Further analysis on mice and 
primary neuronal cultures revealed that colistin administration altered neuronal 
plasticity by reducing the number of immature neurons in adult neurogenesis and 
altering the synaptic function through a reduction of the post-synaptic protein 
PSD95. All these alterations together finally lead to cognitive impairment and 
depression-like symptoms in mice. These findings provide novel insights into the 
mechanisms of colistin-induced neurotoxicity in the CNS, highlighting the need 
for careful monitoring of cognitive function in patients undergoing colistin 
treatment.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is known to be 
associated with increased plasma phosphorylated tau217 (p-tau217) 
concentrations, potentially confounding the utility of plasma p-tau217 
measurements as a marker of amyloid pathology in individuals with suspected 
Alzheimer disease (AD). In this study, we quantitatively investigate the 
relationship of plasma p-tau217 concentrations vs estimated glomerular 
filtration rate (eGFR) in individuals with CKD with and without amyloid 
pathology.
METHODS: This was a retrospective examination of data from 2 observational 
cohorts from either the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging or the Alzheimer's Disease 
Research Center cohorts. p-Tau217 was determined using the ALZpath Simoa 
p-tau217 immunoassay and an immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry assay that 
simultaneously measures p-tau217 and nonphosphorylated-tau217 (np-tau217) to 
determine %p-tau217 ([p-tau217/nonphosphorylated-tau217]) × 100%) (C2N 
Diagnostics). Amyloid positivity was defined by amyloid-PET and a centiloid of 
≥25. Log-log linear regression fits were used to quantitatively predict 
increases in plasma p-tau217 associated with decreasing eGFR.
RESULTS: Participants (n = 202, mean age of 78 years, 38% female) with diagnoses 
of cognitive unimpairment (n = 109), mild cognitive impairment (n = 71), and 
dementia (n = 22) were included. In all, 114 (56%) of all participants were 
amyloid-PET positive (A+). In addition, 86 (43%) of all participants were 
classified as having CKD (CKD stages 3-4). p-Tau217 concentrations were 
significantly higher in A- participants with an eGFR of <60 (mL/min/1.73 m2), as 
compared with those with eGFR >60 A- participants. For an eGFR of 45 vs 60 in 
the A- cohort, the calculated percentage changes were +31%, +55%, and +19%, for 
ALZpath p-tau217, C2N p-tau217, and C2N %p-tau217, respectively. For the A+ 
cohort, the corresponding calculated percentage changes were +17%, +15%, and 
-5%, respectively.
DISCUSSION: CKD was associated with increased p-tau217 concentrations when 
measuring p-tau217 by ALZpath and C2N methodologies, but the effect was 
mitigated by the use of %p-tau217. These results indicate limitations for the 
utility of plasma p-tau217 measurements in individuals with significant renal 
impairment (eGFR <45 or CKD stage 3b or greater). Determination of eGFR should 
be considered to avoid inaccurate classification of the presence of AD-related 
pathology by plasma p-tau217 in individuals with CKD.
CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that in 
individuals with CKD stage 3 (especially stage 3b) or higher, p-tau217 
concentrations are increased, with a greater increase in amyloid-PET-negative 
individuals.

Enhancing protein O-GlcNAcylation by pharmacological inhibition of the enzyme 
O-GlcNAcase (OGA) has been considered as a strategy to decrease tau and 
amyloid-beta phosphorylation, aggregation, and pathology in Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). There is still more to be learned about the impact of enhancing global 
protein O-GlcNAcylation, which is important for understanding the potential of 
using OGA inhibition to treat neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we 
investigated the acute effect of pharmacologically increasing O-GlcNAc levels, 
using the OGA inhibitor Thiamet G (TG), in normal mouse brains. We hypothesized 
that the transcriptome signature in response to a 3 h TG treatment (50 mg/kg) 
provides a comprehensive view of the effect of OGA inhibition. We then performed 
mRNA sequencing of the brain using NovaSeq PE 150 (n = 5 each group). We 
identified 1234 significant differentially expressed genes with TG versus saline 
treatment. Functional enrichment analysis of the upregulated genes identified 
several upregulated pathways, including genes normally down in AD. Among the 
downregulated pathways were the cell adhesion pathway as well as genes normally 
up in AD and aging. When comparing acute to chronic TG treatment, protein 
autophosphorylation and kinase activity pathways were upregulated, whereas cell 
adhesion and astrocyte markers were downregulated in both datasets. AMPK subunit 
Prkab2 was one gene in the kinase activity pathway, and the increase after acute 
and chronic treatment was confirmed using qPCR. Interestingly, mitochondrial 
genes and genes normally down in AD were up in acute treatment and down in 
chronic treatment. Data from this analysis will enable the evaluation of the 
mechanisms underlying the impact of OGA inhibition in the treatment of AD. In 
particular, OGA inhibitors appear to have downstream effects related to 
bioenergetics which may limit their therapeutic benefits.

INTRODUCTION: Understanding how a research sample compares to the population 
from which it is drawn can help inform future recruitment planning. We compared 
the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (WADRC) participant sample to 
the Wisconsin state population (WI-pop) on key demographic, social exposome, and 
vascular risk measures.
METHODS: The WADRC sample included 930 participants. Population statistics were 
estimated using several national and state data sources. We compared WADRC to 
WI-pop for two age groups, 45-64 years and ≥65 years, separately.
RESULTS: Compared to WI-pop, WADRC participants were older and included more 
women, more Black and American Indian individuals, and fewer Hispanic and Asian 
individuals. WADRC participants had higher levels of educational attainment, 
consisted of smaller proportions living in rural areas and disadvantaged 
neighborhoods, and showed lower vascular risks. Greater differences between 
WADRC and WI-pop were found for most metrics in the ≥65 group compared to the 
45-64 group.
DISCUSSION: The findings revealed opportunities to increase enrollment from the 
Hispanic/Latino and Asian American populations, to include participants from a 
broader range of educational backgrounds, and to enroll more residents from 
rural areas and disadvantaged neighborhoods, which may lead to a broader 
distribution of cardiovascular risk factors. Expanding sociodemographic and 
health profiles represented in the participant candidate pool for study 
selection and including those who are underrepresented in research may 
potentially reduce selection bias but not eliminate it. Statistical approaches 
can be applied to address bias and generalize findings from a study sample to 
its target population by adjusting for their differences in the joint 
distribution of covariates. Although research centers have different regional 
populations and specific recruitment focuses for scientific reasons, evaluating 
their participant characteristics may help plan engagement efforts to improve 
the inclusion of underrepresented groups and collaboratively support 
generalizable research nationwide.
HIGHLIGHTS: We compared the characteristics of Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease 
Research Center (WADRC) participants with the Wisconsin population.Metrics of 
comparison included demographics, social exposomes, and vascular risks.WADRC 
participants are different from the Wisconsin population.We explored the 
implications and causes of the differences.We discussed strategies for engaging 
and recruiting underrepresented groups.

Clinical Diagnoses and Characterization of Patients With Amyloid-Negative 
Amyloid-Beta, p-Tau, and Neurofilament Light Chain (ATN) Profiles.

The novel amyloid-beta, p-Tau, and neurofilament light chain (ATN) 
classification scheme has become a promising system for clinically detecting and 
diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD). In addition to its utility in Alzheimer's 
diagnosis and treatment, the ATN framework may also have clinical relevance in 
identifying non-Alzheimer's pathologies. In this study conducted at Broadlawns 
Geriatric and Memory Center, 92 amyloid-negative profiles out of 182 patients 
with an ATN framework were categorized into subjective cognitive impairment 
(SCI), non-amnestic mild cognitive impairment (non-amnestic MCI), amnestic MCI, 
Alzheimer's dementia, vascular dementia, mixed dementia, unspecified dementia, 
or other memory changes based on diagnoses written in the chart. Additionally, 
other secondary diagnoses were found in the differential, including sleep 
disorders, anxiety, depressive disorders and grief, and cerebrovascular disease. 
The results are concordant with our expectations that amyloid-negative ATN 
profiles are associated with mostly non-Alzheimer's cognitive decline. We were 
also able to demonstrate that amyloid-negative patients have other secondary 
neurologic or psychiatric diagnoses related to memory or cognitive changes. 
However, certain enigmatic patient presentations warrant further scrutiny in the 
medical chart. It is possible that ATN may pose a risk of misclassification in 
both Alzheimer and non-Alzheimer pathologies, particularly at early stages. 
Future work may be required to corroborate findings using other new plasma 
biomarkers, such as p-Tau217. Overall, we hope that this study will provide 
options for early detection and future treatment of AD and other neurocognitive 
disorders. We also anticipate that this work will lead to the recognition of 
other non-neurocognitive conditions comorbid with such neurocognitive disorders.

INTRODUCTION: Studies have shown that blood biomarkers can differentiate 
dementia disorders. However, the diagnosis of dementia still relies primarily on 
cerebrospinal fluid and imaging modalities. The new disease-modifying treatments 
call for more widely applicable biomarkers.
METHODS: Plasma samples (n = 250) from two mixed memory clinic were included. 
Participants were divided into amyloid beta positives (Aβ+) and Aβ negatives 
(Aβ-). Plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau) 181, p-tau231, Aβ1-42 (Aβ42), Aβ40, 
Aβ42/Aβ40, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light chain 
(NfL) were measured by single molecule array.
RESULTS: Significant differences were found among cognitively unimpaired, mild 
cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and non-AD, and nearly all of 
the biomarkers were able to predict amyloid status. When combining p-tau181 and 
p-tau231 they predicted Aβ positivity with an area under the curve (AUC) of 
0.75, and when combining all biomarkers an AUC of 0.86 was found.
DISCUSSION: This study supports previous findings on plasma biomarkers, even 
when investigated in a typical clinical setting in a consecutive, heterogeneous, 
mixed memory clinic.
HIGHLIGHTS: This study investigated seven plasma biomarkers in a mixed memory 
clinic, regardless of amyloid co-pathology or atypical phenotypes.These findings 
support previous promising results on plasma biomarkers, even when investigated 
in a heterogeneous population.The combination of phosphorylated tau (p-tau)181 
and p-231 performed only slightly worse than a panel of multiple biomarkers, 
aligning with previous studies.Plasma biomarkers show potential for future 
applications in primary care, treatment monitoring, and trial selection.

INTRODUCTION: Melanopsin is a photopigment with roles in mediating sleep and 
circadian-related processes, which are often disrupted in Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). Melanopsin also impacts cognition and synaptogenesis. This study 
investigated the associations between melanopsin genetic variants, sleep, and 
markers of brain health.
METHODS: Linear regression analyses examined the relationship of 
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the melanopsin gene (OPN4), with 
cortical amyloid beta (Aβ), cognition, brain volumes, and self-reported sleep 
traits in cognitively unimpaired older adults. Further analyses assessed whether 
sleep traits x OPN4 SNP interactions were associated with markers of brain 
health.
RESULTS: OPN4 SNPs rs2355009 and rs3740334 were associated with attention and 
processing speed and ventricular volume and language, respectively. Furthermore, 
rs3740334 and rs1079610 showed significant interactions with sleep traits in 
association with language.
DISCUSSION: This study shows associations of OPN4 genetic variants with markers 
of brain health, and suggests that these variants interact with sleep to 
exacerbate cognitive effects.
HIGHLIGHTS: The relationships between melanopsin gene (OPN4) variants and 
markers of brain health were examined cross-sectionally in cognitively 
unimpaired older individuals.Variation within OPN4is associated with differences 
in cognition and ventricular volume.rs2355009 and rs3740334 show small-moderate 
associations with differences in attention and processing speed. Further to 
this, rs2355009 and rs3740334 were associated with ventricular volumes and 
language performance, respectively.The interactions between rs3740334 and 
rs1079610 and sleep traits also showed small-moderate associations with 
differences in language performance.

INTRODUCTION: We examined semantic and phonemic fluency in individuals with 
subjective cognitive decline (SCD) in relation to amyloid status and clinical 
progression.
METHODS: A total of 490 individuals with SCD (62 ± 8 years, 42% female, 28% 
amyloid-positive, 17% clinical progression) completed annual fluency assessments 
(mean ± SD follow-up 4.3 ± 2.9 years). Associations between fluency 
trajectories, amyloid status, and clinical progression were examined with linear 
mixed models and joint models.
RESULTS: Amyloid-positive individuals declined faster than amyloid-negative 
individuals on semantic fluency (B = -0.35, p < 0.001), but not on phonemic 
fluency (B = -0.06, p = 0.218). An annual decline of one word in semantic and 
phonemic fluency was associated with 22% (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.22, p < 0.001) 
and 28% (HR = 1.28, p = 0.004) increased risk of clinical progression.
DISCUSSION: Our results indicate that decline in semantic fluency is an early 
indicator of cognitive deficits in preclinical Alzheimer's disease.
HIGHLIGHTS: Abnormal amyloid burden is associated with decline in semantic 
fluency.Fluency trajectories are associated with an increased risk of clinical 
progression.More refined measures are needed to detect the earliest language 
deficits.

The endocannabinoid N-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA) is a pro-homeostatic 
bioactive lipid known for its anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, 
immunomodulatory, and neuroprotective properties, which may contrast/mitigate 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. This study explores the therapeutic 
potential of targeting fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), the major enzyme 
degrading AEA, in mouse models of amyloidosis (APP/PS1 and Tg2576). Enhancing 
AEA signaling by genetic deletion of FAAH delayed cognitive deficits in APP/PS1 
mice and improved cognitive symptoms in 12-month-old AD-like mice. Chronic 
pharmacological FAAH inhibition fully reverted neurocognitive decline, 
attenuated neuroinflammation, and promoted neuroprotective mechanisms in Tg2576 
mice. Additionally, pharmacological FAAH inhibition robustly suppressed 
β-amyloid production and accumulation, associated with decreased expression of 
β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), possibly through a 
cannabinoid receptor 1-dependent epigenetic mechanism. These findings improve 
our understanding of AEA signaling in AD pathogenesis and provide proof of 
concept that selective targeting of FAAH activity could be a promising 
therapeutic strategy against AD.

The Canadian Stroke Best Practice Recommendations (CSPR) 7th edition includes 
this new module on the diagnosis and management of vascular cognitive impairment 
(VCI) with or without neurodegenerative disease. An expert writing group and 
people with VCI lived experience (PWLE) reviewed current evidence. Existing 
recommendations were reviewed and revised, and new recommendations added. 
Sections include definitions, signs and symptoms, screening, assessment, 
diagnosis, pharmacological and non-pharmacological management, secondary 
prevention, rehabilitation, and end-of-life care. PWLE were actively involved in 
all aspects of the development, ensuring their experiences are integrated. A 
unique VCI journey map, developed by PWLE, is included, and helped to motivate 
and anchor the recommendations. We encourage it to be displayed across 
healthcare settings to raise awareness and support persons with VCI. These VCI 
CSBPRs emphasize the need for integrated multidisciplinary care across the 
continuum. Evidence for the diagnosis and management of VCI continues to emerge 
and gaps in knowledge should drive future research. HIGHLIGHTS: This Canadian 
Stroke Best Practice Recommendations module focuses specifically on VCI using a 
structured framework and validated methodology. A comprehensive set of 
evidence-based recommendations is presented that addresses the continuum from 
symptom onset to diagnosis, management, and end of life. The recommendations 
consider individuals who experience VCI because of stroke or because of other 
vascular pathologies such as atrial fibrillation or heart failure. A journey map 
of an individual's experience with VCI has been developed by individuals with 
lived experience. It is a valuable guide to inform educational content, 
approaches to caring for individuals and families with VCI, and systems 
planning.

Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative chronic disease with a severe social 
and economic impact in the societies, which still lacks an efficient therapy. 
Several pathophysiological events (β-amyloid [Aβ] deposits, τ-protein 
aggregation, loss of cholinergic activity, and oxidative stress) occurs in the 
progression of the disease. Therefore, the search for efficient multi-targeted 
agents for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease becomes indispensable. In this 
paper we evaluated the AChE inhibition by Ellman's method and antioxidant 
activity by DPPH assay of nine synthetic compounds: two hydroxy-benzene 
derivatives (1 and 2), three bis-thioureidic derivatives (3-5), two imidazole 
derivatives (6 and 7), and two phenylacetamide derivatives (8 and 9). The 
compound 2, (3s,5s,7s)-adamantan-1-yl 
4-(((E)-2,5-dihydroxybenzylidene)amino)benzoate, exhibited the best antioxidant 
activity (30.00 ± 1.05 μM eq Trolox) and compound 4 showed the highest AChE 
inhibition value (IC50 [μM] 8.40 ± 0.32). In the search for a compound showing 
combined activities (antioxidant and AChE inhibition), the compound 4, 
octane-1,8-diyl-bis-S-amidinothiourea dihydrobromide, (19.02 ± 1.52 μM eq 
Trolox; IC50 [μM] 8.40 ± 0.32) was chosen to carry out a molecular docking 
study. The results showed that compound 4 has the ability to bind the active 
site of acetylcholinesterase with considerable affinity (estimated binding 
energies of -8.5 kcal/mol). All data indicate that compound 4 has the potential 
to be further investigated as a possible candidate in the Alzheimer's disease 
treatment.

To explore the pharmacological mechanism of Changpu-Yizhi-Wan (CYW) in the 
treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from the perspective of ferroptosis based 
on network pharmacology and experimental verification. The Encyclopedia of 
Traditional Chinese Medicine 2.0 (ETCM2.0) database was used to collect the 
active components of CYW, and the putative targets were predicted in ETCM2.0 and 
SwissTargetPrediction database. The AD related targets were collected from 
GeneCards, comparative toxicogenomics database (CTD), Online Mendelian 
Inheritance in Man (OMIM), DisGeNET and Therapeutic Target Database (TTD), the 
ferroptosis related targets were collected from FerrDb V2 database, and the 
common targets of CYW, AD and ferroptosis were calculated by Venny2.1 platform. 
Protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis was performed by STRING database, and 
the active compounds-target network and the PPI network were constructed using 
Cytoscape software. Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes 
(KEGG) and Reactome pathway enrichment analysis were performed through DAVID 
database. RSL3 was used to induce HT22 cells to establish a neuronal ferroptosis 
cell model, and the inhibitory effect of CYW on neuronal ferroptosis was 
evaluated by cell viability assay, intracellular iron assay and lipid 
peroxidation staining. The ferroptosis-associated key protein expressions of 
Nrf2, SLC7A11, GPX4 and FTH1 were detected by Western blot. A total of 100 
candidate compounds were identified from CYW, and 1129 putative targets were 
obtained. 3924 AD-related targets and 564 ferroptosis-related targets were 
collected, respectively. There were 78 common targets between them and CYW 
targets, which were potential targets for CYW to regulate ferroptosis in the 
treatment of AD. PPI network analysis identified 10 key targets, including TP53, 
IL6, STAT3, HIF1A, NFE2L2, and others. GO, KEGG and Reactome enrichment analysis 
showed that 78 potential targets were involved in the regulation of ferroptosis 
and Nrf2-mediated gene transcription. Molecular docking showed that some active 
components of CYW had good affinity with Nrf2. In RSL3-induced HT22 cells, CYW 
significantly improved cell viability, reduced intracellular iron levels and 
inhibited lipid peroxidation, and improved the protein expression of Nrf2, 
SLC7A11, GPX4 and FTH1. The pharmacological mechanism of CYW in the treatment of 
AD may be related to the regulation of Nrf2/SLC7A11/GPX4/FTH1 axis to inhibit 
neuronal ferroptosis.

OBJECTIVE: This paper introduces a novel framework for evaluating phenotype 
algorithms (PAs) using the open-source tool, Cohort Diagnostics.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The method is based on several diagnostic criteria to 
evaluate a patient cohort returned by a PA. Diagnostics include estimates of 
incidence rate, index date entry code breakdown, and prevalence of all observed 
clinical events prior to, on, and after index date. We test our framework by 
evaluating one PA for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and two PAs for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) across 10 different observational data sources.
RESULTS: By utilizing CohortDiagnostics, we found that the population-level 
characteristics of individuals in the cohort of SLE closely matched the 
disease's anticipated clinical profile. Specifically, the incidence rate of SLE 
was consistently higher in occurrence among females. Moreover, expected clinical 
events like laboratory tests, treatments, and repeated diagnoses were also 
observed. For AD, although one PA identified considerably fewer patients, 
absence of notable differences in clinical characteristics between the two 
cohorts suggested similar specificity.
DISCUSSION: We provide a practical and data-driven approach to evaluate PAs, 
using two clinical diseases as examples, across a network of OMOP data sources. 
Cohort Diagnostics can ensure the subjects identified by a specific PA align 
with those intended for inclusion in a research study.
CONCLUSION: Diagnostics based on large-scale population-level characterization 
can offer insights into the misclassification errors of PAs.

Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that impairs neurocognitive 
functions. Acetylcholinesterase, Butyrylcholinesterase, Monoamine Oxidase B, 
Beta-Secretase, and Glycogen Synthase Kinase Beta play central roles in its 
pathogenesis. Current medications primarily inhibit AChE but fail to halt or 
reverse disease progression due to the multifactorial nature of Alzheimer's. 
This underscores the necessity of developing multi-target ligands for effective 
treatment. This study investigates the potential of phytochemical compounds from 
Moroccan medicinal plants as multi-target agents against Alzheimer's disease, 
employing computational approaches. A virtual screening of 386 phytochemical 
compounds, followed by an assessment of pharmacokinetic properties and ADMET 
profiles, led to the identification of two promising compounds, naringenin (C23) 
and hesperetin (C24), derived from Anabasis aretioides. These compounds exhibit 
favourable pharmacokinetic profiles and strong binding affinities for the five 
key targets associated with the disease. Density functional theory, molecular 
dynamics simulations, and MM-GBSA calculations further confirmed their 
structural stability, with a slight preference for C24, exhibiting superior 
intermolecular interactions and overall stability. These findings provide a 
strong basis for further experimental research, including in vitro and in vivo 
studies, to substantiate their potential efficacy in Alzheimer's disease.

BACKGROUND: Declining gait performance is seen in aging individuals, due to 
neural and systemic factors. Plasma biomarkers provide an accessible way to 
assess evolving brain changes; non-specific neurodegeneration (NfL, GFAP) or 
evolving Alzheimer's disease (Aβ 42/40 ratio, P-Tau181).
METHODS: In a population-based cohort of older adults, we evaluate the 
hypothesis that plasma biomarkers of neurodegeneration and Alzheimer's Disease 
pathology are associated with worse gait performance. A sample of 2641 Mayo 
Clinic Study of Aging participants with measurements of plasma biomarkers and 
gait parameters was analyzed in this cross-sectional study. Linear regression 
models using plasma biomarkers as predictors of gait parameters and adjusted for 
age, sex, BMI, Charlson Comorbidity Index, and cognitive diagnosis were 
evaluated.
RESULTS: In this study multiple statistically significant relationships are 
observed for GFAP, NfL, and P-Tau181 with gait parameters. Each standard 
deviation increase in GFAP, NfL, and P-Tau181 is associated with a reduction in 
velocity of 2.100 (95% CI: -3.004, -1.196; p = 5.4 × 10-6), 4.400 (-5.292, 
-3.507; p = 9.5 × 10-22), and 2.617 (-3.414, -1.819; p = 1.5 × 10-10) cm/sec, 
respectively. Overall, NfL has the strongest associations with poor gait 
performance. Models with age interactions show that the strength of associations 
between the plasma biomarkers and the gait parameters became stronger with 
increasing age. There are no specific gait parameters that associate with 
individual plasma biomarkers.
CONCLUSION: Plasma biomarkers of neurodegeneration and Alzheimer's Disease 
pathology are not only markers of cognitive decline but also indicate motor 
decline in the aging population.

Plain Language Summary: Decline in gait and balance occurs as an individual gets 
older. These changes can increase risk for falls, death and disability. However, 
the brain changes that cause a declining gait and balance in aging are 
incompletely understood. Here, we evaluated gait performance in over 2000 
individuals as well as blood biomarkers that indicate evolving Alzheimer’s 
disease or neurodegeneration. We found that gait changes in the aging individual 
are associated with neurodegeneration and accumulation of Alzheimer’s disease 
pathology independent of their memory performance. These findings offer evidence 
for the role of blood biomarkers in investigating gait decline. Future research 
will build upon these findings to expand our understanding of brain mechanisms 
that contribute to gait and balance abnormalities in aging individuals.

Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is linked to memory formation in the adult brain, 
with new neurons in the hippocampus exhibiting greater plasticity during their 
immature stages compared to mature neurons. Abnormal adult hippocampal 
neurogenesis is closely associated with cognitive impairment in central nervous 
system diseases. Targeting and regulating adult hippocampal neurogenesis have 
been shown to improve cognitive deficits. This review aims to expand the current 
understanding and prospects of targeting neurogenesis in the treatment of 
cognitive impairment. Recent research indicates the presence of abnormalities in 
AHN in several diseases associated with cognitive impairment, including 
cerebrovascular diseases, Alzheimer's disease, aging-related conditions, and 
issues related to anesthesia and surgery. The role of these abnormalities in the 
cognitive deficits caused by these diseases has been widely recognized, and 
targeting AHN is considered a promising approach for treating cognitive 
impairment. However, the underlying mechanisms of this role are not yet fully 
understood, and the effectiveness of targeting abnormal adult hippocampal 
neurogenesis for treatment remains limited, with a need for further development 
of treatment methods and detection techniques. By reviewing recent studies, we 
classify the potential mechanisms of adult hippocampal neurogenesis 
abnormalities into four categories: immunity, energy metabolism, aging, and 
pathological states. In immunity-related mechanisms, abnormalities in meningeal, 
brain, and peripheral immunity can disrupt normal adult hippocampal 
neurogenesis. Lipid metabolism and mitochondrial function disorders are 
significant energy metabolism factors that lead to abnormal adult hippocampal 
neurogenesis. During aging, the inflammatory state of the neurogenic niche and 
the expression of aging-related microRNAs contribute to reduced adult 
hippocampal neurogenesis and cognitive impairment in older adult patients. 
Pathological states of the body and emotional disorders may also result in 
abnormal adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Among the current strategies used to 
enhance this form of neurogenesis, physical therapies such as exercise, 
transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and enriched environments have 
proven effective. Dietary interventions, including energy intake restriction and 
nutrient optimization, have shown efficacy in both basic research and clinical 
trials. However, drug treatments, such as antidepressants and stem cell therapy, 
are primarily reported in basic research, with limited clinical application. The 
relationship between abnormal adult hippocampal neurogenesis and cognitive 
impairment has garnered widespread attention, and targeting the former may be an 
important strategy for treating the latter. However, the mechanisms underlying 
abnormal adult hippocampal neurogenesis remain unclear, and treatments are 
lacking. This highlights the need for greater focus on translating research 
findings into clinical practice.

Treadmill Exercise Mitigates Alzheimer's Pathology by Modulating Glial 
Polarization and Reducing Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cell Perivascular 
Clustering.

University, Guangzhou, CHINA.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the pathological responses of glial 
cells at different distances from amyloid plaques and the characteristics of 
oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPC) in perivascular clustering. In addition, 
it sought to explore the impact of exercise training on AD pathology, 
specifically focusing on the modulation of glial responses and the effects of 
OPC perivascular clustering.
METHODS: Three-month-old C57BL/6 and APP/PS1 mice were divided into four groups: 
wild-type sedentary, wild-type exercise, sedentary AD, and exercise AD groups. 
The Barnes maze test was conducted to analyze spatial learning and memory. 
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis, Immunofluorescence staining, 
Fluro-Jade C staining, TUNEL staining, Sholl analysis, and 3D rendering analysis 
were employed to detect Aβ 1-42, tau hyperphosphorylation, typical amyloid 
plaques, abnormal tau phosphorylation, neuronal damage, apoptosis, 
neurodegeneration, microglial and astrocytic activation and phenotypic 
polarization, and OPC perivascular clustering.
RESULTS: Behavioral results revealed that long-term exercise training 
ameliorated cognitive deficits in APP/PS1 mice. Histopathological analysis 
showed a reduction in amyloid deposition and decreased tau hyperphosphorylation. 
Immunofluorescence and Fluro-Jade C staining indicated that exercise attenuated 
neuronal damage, degeneration, and apoptosis. Sholl and 3D rendering analysis 
demonstrated that exercise mitigated spatially dependent glial phenotypic 
changes surrounding amyloid plaques in the AD cortex and hippocampus. Further, 
immunofluorescence staining revealed that exercise alleviated plaque-associated 
glial changes in these regions. Exercise also alleviated the reduction of 
microglial SIRPα and reduced synaptic loss mediated by microglial and astrocyte 
phagocytosis. Lastly, exercise mitigated OPC senescence and cellular 
senescence-induced OPC perivascular clustering in AD mice.
CONCLUSIONS: Exercise can counteract AD pathological features by modulating 
glial responses and reducing OPC senescence and perivascular clustering near 
amyloid plaques, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic strategy for AD.

OBJECTIVES: Loneliness is associated with an elevated risk of dementia. There is 
mixed evidence from imaging studies on whether loneliness is associated with 
neuropathology in dementia-free adults. This study tests whether loneliness is 
associated with plasma neurobiomarkers of amyloid (Aβ42/Aβ40), phosphorylated 
tau 181 (pTau181), neurofilament light chain (NfL), and glial fibrillary acidic 
protein (GFAP) and imaging measures of amyloid and tau.
METHODS: Participants were cognitively unimpaired older adults from the 
Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging (BLSA; N = 1,028 individuals and up to 
2,277 neurobiomarker measurements; Baseline mean age = 66, SD = 15 years) and 
the UK Biobank (N = 1,263 individuals and up to 2,526 neurobiomarker 
measurements; Baseline mean age = 60, SD = 7 years). Single-item measures of 
loneliness and the Quanterix Single Molecule Array assays were used in both 
samples. In a subset of BLSA participants, positron emission tomography (PET) 
was used to assess cerebral amyloid burden (n = 220) and tau in the entorhinal 
cortex (n = 102).
RESULTS: In both samples and meta-analyses, loneliness was unrelated to plasma 
measures of Aβ42/Aβ40, pTau181, NfL, and GFAP. Changes in loneliness were also 
unrelated to changes in the plasma neurobiomarkers, and no consistent evidence 
of moderation by age, sex, or APOE ε4 allele was found. Loneliness was also 
unrelated to PET-based measures of amyloid and tau.
DISCUSSION: This study found no associations between loneliness and measures of 
Alzheimer's disease pathology, axonal damage, or astrogliosis.

Diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD) through pathological markers is typically 
costly and invasive. This study aims to find a noninvasive, cost-effective 
method using portable electroencephalography (EEG) to detect changes in 
AD-related biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). A total of 102 patients, 
both with and without AD-related biomarker changes (amyloid beta and 
phosphorylated tau), were recorded using a 2-minute resting-state portable EEG. 
A machine-learning algorithm then analyzed the EEG data to identify these 
biomarker changes. The results showed that the machine learning model could 
distinguish patients with AD-related biomarker changes, achieving 68.1% accuracy 
(AUROC 0.75) for amyloid beta and 71.2% accuracy (AUROC 0.77) for phosphorylated 
tau, with gamma activities being key features. When excluding cases with 
idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus, accuracy improved to 74.1% (AUROC 
0.80) for amyloid beta and 73.1% (AUROC 0.80) for phosphorylated tau. This study 
suggests that portable EEG combined with machine learning is a promising 
noninvasive and cost-effective tool for early AD-related pathological marker 
screening, which could enhance neurophysiological understanding and diagnostic 
accessibility.

Ferritin nanoparticles, which can penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB), have 
gained significant research interest for the diagnosis and treatment of central 
nervous system (CNS) diseases, including gliomas, Alzheimer's disease, and brain 
metastases. In recent years, ferritin has been proved as a candidate to cross 
the BBB using receptor-mediated transport (RMT) mechanism through transferrin 
receptor 1 (TfR1) which is overexpressed in the cells of the BBB. Various types 
of cargo molecules, including therapeutics, imaging agents, nucleic acids, and 
metal nanoparticles, have been incorporated into ferritin nanocages for the 
diagnosis and treatment of CNS diseases. In particular, low immunogenicity of 
ferritin implies safety for its usage in clinical practices, and high 
biocompatibility add to the perspectives of its applications. Furthermore, 
contemporary strides in molecular biology have enabled some alteration in the 
configuration of the ferritin outer layers and surface characters so as to 
enhance the drug encapsulation capacity and conjugation affinity. Such 
modifications not only enhance the property of ferritin in crossing the BBB, but 
also enhance its efficacy when applied to CNS diseases. In summary, ferritin, as 
a drug delivery system, shows great potential for the treatment and diagnosis of 
CNS diseases.

Proteinopathies in neurology typically refer to pathological changes in proteins 
associated with neurological diseases, such as the aggregation of amyloid β and 
Tau in Alzheimer's disease, α-synuclein in Parkinson's disease and multiple 
system atrophy, and TAR DNA-binding protein 43 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
and frontotemporal dementia. Interestingly, these proteins are also commonly 
found in peripheral tissues, raising important questions about their roles in 
neurological disorders. Multiple studies have shown that peripherally derived 
pathological proteins not only travel to the brain through various routes, 
aggravating brain pathology, but also contribute significantly to peripheral 
dysfunction, highlighting their crucial impact on neurological diseases. 
Investigating how these peripherally derived proteins influence the progression 
of neurological disorders could open new horizons for achieving early diagnosis 
and treatment. This review summarizes the distribution, transportation pathways, 
and pathogenic mechanisms of several neurodegenerative disease-related 
pathological proteins in the periphery, proposing that targeting these 
peripheral pathological proteins could be a promising strategy for preventing 
and managing neurological diseases.

BACKGROUND: AD is a demyelinating disease. Myelin damage initiates the 
pathological process of AD, resulting in abnormal synaptic function and 
cognitive decline. The myelin sheath formed by oligodendrocytes (OL) is a 
crucial component of white matter. Investigating AD from the perspective of OL 
may offer novel diagnostic and therapeutic perspectives.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to analyze the association between OL-related genes 
and Alzheimer's disease (AD) using bioinformatics and verify this association 
via molecular biology experiments.
METHODS: The AD datasets were acquired from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) 
database of NCBI. Consensus clustering was employed to determine the subtypes of 
AD, followed by evaluating the clinical characteristics of these subtypes. 
Subsequently, immune infiltration analysis of relevant genes and Weighted Gene 
Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) were conducted to identify modules and 
hub genes associated with AD progression. The intersection of genes obtained was 
analyzed using Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes 
(KEGG) enrichment analyses. To narrow down the scope and identify OL-related 
genes with diagnostic potential, three machine learning algorithms were 
utilized. In addition, the eXtreme Sum (XSum) algorithm was used to screen small 
molecule drug candidates based on the connectivity map (CMAP) database. Finally, 
these identified genes were validated using Real-time fluorescence quantitative 
PCR (RT-qPCR).
RESULTS: Among the three subtypes of AD, Cluster A and Cluster C exhibited 
increased levels of Braak and neurofibrillary tangles compared to Cluster B. The 
proportion of females was greater than that of males among the three subclasses 
of AD. There were no significant differences in age among the three subclasses, 
but significant differences in gene expression existed. Through WGCNA analysis, 
108 genes were identified. Among these, 16 genes were identified as shared genes 
by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), random forest 
(RF), and support vector machines (SVM) algorithms, and logistic regression 
further determined 11 genes. The establishment of a nomogram demonstrated the 
significance of these 11 genes in AD. The "XSum" algorithm revealed five drugs 
with therapeutic potential for AD. RT-qPCR analysis revealed the upregulation 
and downregulation of the highlighted genes. According to this study, 11 genes 
related to OL were also found to be associated with immune cell infiltration in 
AD patients. These genes demonstrated potential diagnostic value for AD. 
Additionally, we screened five small molecular drugs that exhibit potential 
therapeutic effects on AD.
CONCLUSION: This research provides a new perspective for personalized clinical 
management and treatment of AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a debilitating condition that significantly affects 
the elderly. Early diagnosis is not only critical for improving patient outcomes 
but also directly influences the success of emerging therapeutic interventions. 
A therapeutic strategy targeting only one pathogenic mechanism is unlikely to be 
very effective, as there is increasing evidence that AD does not have a single 
pathogenic cause. Therefore, combining medications or developing therapies that 
address multiple pathways may be beneficial. Most clinical trials can be 
classified under added therapy rather than combination therapy. Effective 
treatment of AD likely requires targeting multiple mechanisms, such as 
amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau pathology. However, many medications face challenges, 
including poor solubility, low permeability, and the inability to cross the 
blood- -brain barrier (BBB). This is where nanocarriers come into play, as they 
can be loaded with these medications to facilitate targeted drug delivery. This 
approach enhances the pharmacokinetic profile of drugs in both the blood and the 
brain. Therefore, this paper provides a concise overview of the use of various 
nanocarriers loaded with drug combinations for treating AD.

Imidazoline I2 receptors (I2-IRs) are altered in Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
patients and are associated with analgesia. I2-IRs are not structurally 
described, and their pharmacological characterization relies on their modulation 
by highly affine ligands. Herein, we describe the synthesis of 
(3-phenylcarbamoyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-2-yl)phosphonates endowed with relevant 
affinities for I2-IRs in human brain tissues. The optimal ADME and 
pharmacokinetic profile of a selected compound, 12d, secured its in vivo 
exploration in a senescence accelerated prone 8 mice revealing improvement in 
the cognitive impairment and unveiling the mechanism of action by analyzing 
specific AD biomarkers. The treatment of a capsaicin-induced mechanical 
hypersensitivity murine model with 12d revealed analgesic properties devoid of 
motor coordination issues. The target engagement of 12d was demonstrated by 
suppression of the analgesic effect by pretreatment with idazoxan. Overall, 12d 
is a putative candidate for advancing preclinical phases and supports the 
modulation of I2-IRs as an innovative approach for therapeutics.

Alzheimer's disease is the neurodegenerative disorder responsible for 
approximately 60% to 70% of all cases of dementia and is expected to affect 152 
million by 2050. Recently, anti-amyloid therapies have been developed and 
approved by the Food and Drug Administration as disease-modifying treatments 
given as infusions every 2 to 5 weeks for Alzheimer's disease. Although this is 
an important milestone in mitigating Alzheimer's disease progression, it is 
critical for emergency medicine clinicians to understand what anti-amyloid 
therapies are and how they work to recognize, treat, and mitigate their adverse 
effects. Anti-amyloid therapies may be underrecognized contributors to emergency 
department visits because they carry the risk of adverse effects, namely 
amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities are 
observed as abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging as computed tomography 
is not sensitive enough to detect the microvasculature abnormalities causing 
vasogenic edema (amyloid-related imaging abnormalities-E) microhemorrhages and 
hemosiderin deposits (amyloid-related imaging abnormalities-H). Patients 
presenting with amyloid-related imaging abnormalities may have nonspecific 
neurologic symptoms, including headache, lethargy, confusion, and seizures. 
Anti-amyloid therapies may increase risk of hemorrhagic conversion of ischemic 
stroke patients receiving thrombolytics and complicate the initiation of 
anticoagulation. Given the novelty of anti-amyloid therapies and limited 
real-world data pertaining to amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, it is 
important for emergency medicine clinicians to be aware of these agents.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder characterized 
by amyloid-β and Tau protein depositions, with treatments focusing on single 
proteins have shown limited success due to the complexity of pathways involved. 
This study explored the potential of chronokines -proteins that modulate 
aging-related processes- as an alternative therapeutic approach. Specifically, 
we focused on a novel pleiotropic chimeric protein named HEBE, combining s-KL, 
sTREM2 and TIMP2, guided by bioinformatic analyses to ensure the preservation of 
each protein's conformation, crucial for their functions. In vitro studies 
confirmed HEBE's stability and enzymatic activities, even suggesting it has 
different activities compared to the individual chronokines. In vivo experiments 
on APP/Tau mice revealed improved learning and memory functions with HEBE 
treatment, along with decreased levels of phosphorylated Tau and minor effects 
on amyloid-β levels. These findings suggest that HEBE is as a promising 
therapeutic candidate for ameliorating memory deficits and reducing pTau in an 
AD mouse model.

The cholinergic deficits and amyloid beta (Aβ) aggregation are the mainstream 
simultaneously observed pathologies during the progression of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). Deposited Aβ plaques are considered to be the primary pathological 
hallmarks of AD and are contemplated as promising diagnostic biomarker. Herein, 
a series of novel theranostic agents were designed, synthesised and evaluated 
against cholinesterase (ChEs) enzymes and detection of Aβ species, which are 
major targets for development of therapeutics for AD. Among all the tested 
compounds against ChEs enzymes, compound/probe 39 & 43 exhibited potent 
inhibitory activities. Its excellent BBB permeability was anticipated in PAMPA 
assay. Measurement of fluorescent properties showed emission maxima (λemm) in 
between 530 and 550 nm in distinct organic solvent except in the most polar 
solvent i.e., PBS (10 % DMSO), where broad absorption (λabs of 440 nm) and 
emission spectrum (λemm of 640 nm) was observed. The relative fluorescence 
quantum yield of probe 39 in methanol was found to be 0.17. The increase in 
fluorescence intensity displayed by the probe 39 upon binding with Aβ aggregates 
in the in vitro assay, and produced high apparent binding constant. Further, 
it's binding affinity towards Aβ1-42 aggregates was validated on the basis of 
colocalization with thioflavin T (ThT). A significant enhancement in the 
fluorescence lifetime of probe 39 on binding with Aβ aggregates was observed in 
time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) analysis (10.00 ± 1.12 ns) and 
fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) imaging (11.53 ± 0.01 ns). 
Furthermore, acute oral toxicity studies signified the safety profile of lead 
probe 39. The in-vivo behavioural studies demonstrated a substantial improvement 
of cognitive and special memory impairment in the scopolamine-induced cognitive 
deficit in mice model on the administration of compound 39 at a dose of 
20 mg/kg. The AChE inhibitory potential and antioxidant property of lead probe 
39 were further accessed with ex vivo biochemical analysis. Together, our 
findings suggest Probe 39 as a promising theranostic agent for the AD.

Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is widely recognized as a promising therapeutic 
target enzyme for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The screening of AChE inhibitors 
(AChEIs) holds great significance for the treatment of AD. In this study, 
cellulose ﬁlter paper (CFP) -immobilized AChE was prepared and firstly applied 
to screening AChEIs from 30 % ethanol extract of Phyllanthus emblica L. fruits 
combined with ultra-high performance liquid chromatography quadrupole 
time-of-fight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS). Using CFP-immobilized AChE 
as the bait, AChEIs were harvested and the instantaneous separation 
characteristics of CFP were utilized to further facilitate the separation of the 
complex from the inactive components. Ultimately, 27 compounds specifically 
bound with AChE were screened and identified using UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS. 
Additionally, molecular docking was employed to explore the binding mechanisms 
between screened potential inhibitors and AChE. The results show that, most of 
the screened compounds were found to exhibit higher affinity that of the 
positive control (huperzine A), and all the compounds expect mucic acid to be 
well embedded into the active pocket of AChE. To verify the reliability of the 
screening method and molecular docking, two commercial standards geraniin and 
ellagic acid were experimented with an AChE inhibition assay in vitro. The 
results showed that both compounds were found to effectively inhibit AChE with 
IC50 values of 42.42 ± 7.10 μM, 172.43 ± 9.22 μM. The developed method exhibits 
the advantages of rapidness and effectiveness in screening of AChEIs from 
complex herbal extracts.

OBJECTIVE: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are considered diagnostic and 
prognostic indicators of dementia and are attributable to neurodegenerative 
processes. Little is known about the prognostic value of early NPS on executive 
functioning (EF) decline in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). We 
examined whether baseline NPS predicted the rate of executive function (EF) 
decline among older adults with ADRD.
METHOD: Older adults (n = 1625) with cognitive impairment were selected from the 
National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center database. EF was estimated with a 
latent factor indicated by scores on Number Span Backward, Letter Fluency, and 
Trail Making-Part B. A curve of factors (CUFF) latent growth curve model was 
estimated to examine rate of change over four years. Baseline NPS severity was 
entered as a predictor in the model to examine its influence on the rate of 
change in EF over time.
RESULTS: The CUFF models exhibited good fit. EF significantly declined over four 
waves (slope = -.16, p < .001). Initial visit NPS severity predicted decline in 
EF (slope = .013, p < .001), such that those with greater baseline NPS severity 
demonstrated a more rapid decline in EF performance over time. Presence of 2 NPS 
significantly predicted EF decline, and those with medium total NPS severity 
(NPS score of 2-4) at baseline exhibited a sharper decline in EF.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings underscore the importance of targeting NPS early across 
ADRD syndromes to minimize EF decline, offering novel insights into how early 
NPS treatment may alter cognitive trajectories. We provide an innovative, 
user-friendly web-based application that may be helpful for personalized 
treatment planning.

INTRODUCTION: Age-associated depletion in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide 
(NAD+) concentrations has been implicated in metabolic, cardiovascular, and 
neurodegenerative disorders. Supplementation with NAD+ precursors, such as 
nicotinamide riboside (NR), offers a potential therapeutic avenue against 
neurodegenerative pathologies in aging, Alzheimer's disease, and related 
dementias. A crossover, double-blind, randomized placebo (PBO) controlled trial 
was conducted to test the safety and efficacy of 8 weeks' active treatment with 
NR (1 g/day) on cognition and plasma AD biomarkers in older adults with 
subjective cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment.
METHODS: The primary efficacy outcome was the Repeatable Battery for the 
Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS). Secondary outcomes included 
plasma phosphorylated tau 217 (pTau217), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), 
and neurofilament light chain (NfL). Exploratory outcomes included Lumosity 
gameplay (z-scores) for cognition and step counts from wearables. Mixed model 
for repeated measures was used for between-group comparisons; paired t-tests 
were used for within-individual comparisons.
RESULTS: Forty-six participants aged over 55 were randomized to NR-PBO or PBO-NR 
groups; 41 completed baseline visits, and 37 completed the trial. NR 
supplementation was safe and well tolerated with no differences in adverse 
events reported between NR and PBO treatment phases. For the between-group 
comparison, there was a 7% reduction in pTau217 concentrations after taking NR, 
while an 18% increase with PBO (p = 0.02). No significant between-group 
differences were observed for RBANS, other plasma biomarkers(GFAP and NfL), 
Lumosity gameplay scores or step counts. For the within-individual comparison, 
pTau217 concentrations significantly decreased during the NR phase compared to 
the PBO (p = 0.02), while step counts significantly increased during the NR 
phase than PBO (p = 0.04).
DISCUSSION: Eight weeks NR supplementation is safe and lowered pTau217 
concentrations but did not alter cognition as measured by conventional or novel 
digital assessments. Further research is warranted to validate NR's efficacy in 
altering pathological brain aging processes.
HIGHLIGHTS: The integrated study design combines a two-arm parallel trial with a 
crossover phase, offering the opportunity to enhance sample size for 
within-individual analysis and assess carryover effects.NR is safe but did not 
alter cognition as measured by multi-modal assessments in SCD/MCI.For 
between-group comparison, pTau217 levels decreased with NR and increased with 
PBO at 8-week follow-up.For within-individual comparison, step counts increased 
after NR and decreased after PBO.A larger, longer study with pharmacodynamic and 
pathophysiological biomarkers is needed to assess NR's disease-modifying 
effects.

Rationale: Mutations in the synaptic protein MAM domain containing 
glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor 2 (MDGA2) have been associated with autism 
spectrum disorder (ASD). Therefore, elucidating the regulatory mechanisms of 
MDGA2 can help develop effective treatments for ASD. Methods: Liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was carried out to identify proteins 
interacting with the extracellular domain of RPS23RG1 and with MDGA2, followed 
by co-immunoprecipitation assays to confirm protein-protein interactions. 
RPS23RG1 and SORT1 levels were downregulated by siRNAs to study their effects on 
MDGA2 degradation, with additional applications of immunoblotting and 
immunostaining assays. Lysosome isolation was performed to determine the 
lysosomal degradation of MDGA2 further. Rps23rg1 knockout mice and Mdga2 +/- 
mice were subjected to various behavioral tests to study their ASD-like 
phenotypes. AAVs expressing MDGA2 were delivered in Rps23rg1 knockout mice, and 
RPS23RG1-derived peptide was delivered in Mdga2 +/- mice to study their rescuing 
effects. Results: We found that both RPS23RG1 and SORT1 interacted with MDGA2. 
MDGA2 was primarily degraded through the SORT1-mediated lysosomal degradation 
pathway. RPS23RG1 competed with SORT1 for MDGA2 binding to inhibit MDGA2 
degradation. Furthermore, we showed that Rps23rg1 knockout mice exhibited 
decreased MDGA2 levels and ASD-like behaviors, whereas restoration of MDGA2 
levels attenuated social defects in Rps23rg1 KO mice. Moreover, we identified a 
crucial region of RPS23RG1 for MDGA2 interaction and found that a peptide 
derived from this region not only bound MDGA2 and promoted MDGA2 levels, but 
also rescued social defects in Mdga2 +/- mice. Conclusion: Our findings 
highlight a crucial role of RPS23RG1 in antagonizing SORT1-mediated lysosomal 
degradation of MDGA2 and suggest a potential for targeting the RPS23RG1-MDGA2 
axis to treat ASD with MDGA2 deficiency.

Parkinson's disease is primarily marked by mitochondrial dysfunction and 
metabolic abnormalities. We recently reported that the combined metabolic 
activators improved the immunohistochemical parameters and behavioural functions 
in Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease animal models and the cognitive 
functions in Alzheimer's disease patients. These metabolic activators serve as 
the precursors of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and glutathione, and they 
can be used to activate mitochondrial metabolism and eventually treat 
mitochondrial dysfunction. Here, we designed a randomized, double-blinded, 
placebo-controlled phase II study in Parkinson's disease patients with 84 days 
combined metabolic activator administration. A single dose of combined metabolic 
activator contains L-serine (12.35 g), N-acetyl-L-cysteine (2.55 g), 
nicotinamide riboside (1 g) and L-carnitine tartrate (3.73 g). Patients were 
administered either one dose of combined metabolic activator or a placebo daily 
for the initial 28 days, followed by twice-daily dosing for the next 56 days. 
The main goal of the study was to evaluate the clinical impact on motor 
functions using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale and to determine 
the safety and tolerability of combined metabolic activator. A secondary 
objective was to assess cognitive functions utilizing the Montreal Cognitive 
Assessment and to analyse brain activity through functional MRI. We also 
performed comprehensive plasma metabolomics and proteomics analysis for detailed 
characterization of Parkinson's disease patients who participated in the study. 
Although no improvement in motor functions was observed, cognitive function was 
shown to be significantly improved (P < 0.0000) in Parkinson's disease patients 
treated with the combined metabolic activator group over 84 days, whereas no 
such improvement was noted in the placebo group (P > 0.05). Moreover, a 
significant reduction (P = 0.001) in Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores was 
observed in the combined metabolic activator group, with no decline (P > 0.05) 
in the placebo group among severe Parkinson's disease patients with lower 
baseline Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores. We showed that improvement in 
cognition was associated with critical brain network alterations based on 
functional MRI analysis, especially relevant to areas with cognitive functions 
in the brain. Finally, through a comprehensive multi-omics analysis, we 
elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying cognitive improvements observed 
in Parkinson's disease patients. Our results show that combined metabolic 
activator administration leads to enhanced cognitive function and improved 
metabolic health in Parkinson's disease patients as recently shown in 
Alzheimer's disease patients. The trial was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov 
NCT04044131 (17 July 2019, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04044131).

The largest risk factor for dementia is age. Heterochronic blood exchange 
studies have uncovered age-related blood factors that demonstrate 'pro-aging' or 
'pro-youthful' effects on the mouse brain. The clinical relevance and combined 
effects of these factors for humans is unclear. We examined five previously 
identified brain rejuvenation factors in cerebrospinal fluid of adults with 
autosomal dominant forms of frontotemporal dementia and sporadic Alzheimer's 
disease. Our frontotemporal dementia cohort included 100 observationally 
followed adults carrying autosomal dominant frontotemporal dementia mutations 
(Mage = 49.6; 50% female; 43% C9orf72, 24% GRN, 33% MAPT) and 62 non-carriers 
(Mage = 52.6; 45% female) with cerebrospinal fluid analysed on Somascan, and 
longitudinal (Mvisits = 3 years, range 1-7 years) neuropsychological and 
functional assessments and plasma neurofilament light chain. Our Alzheimer's 
disease cohort included 35 adults with sporadic Alzheimer's disease (Mage = 
69.4; 60% female) and 56 controls (Mage = 68.8, 50% female) who completed the 
same cerebrospinal fluid and clinical outcome measures cross-sectionally. Levels 
of C-C motif chemokine ligand 11, C-C motif chemokine ligand 2, 
beta-2-micorglobulin, bone gamma-carboxyglutamate protein (aka Osteocalcin) and 
colony stimulating factor 2 in cerebrospinal fluid were linearly combined into a 
composite score, with higher values reflecting 'pro-youthful' levels. In genetic 
frontotemporal dementia, higher baseline cerebrospinal fluid rejuvenation 
proteins predicted slower decline across cognitive, functional, and 
neurofilament light chain trajectories; estimates were similar across genotypes. 
In transdiagnostic analyses, higher cerebrospinal fluid rejuvenation proteins 
associated with better functional, cognitive, and neurofilament light chain 
outcomes in adults with sporadic Alzheimer's disease. Proteins with pre-clinical 
evidence for brain rejuvenation show translational clinical relevance in adults 
with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias and warrant further 
investigation.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most frequent form of dementia and represents an 
increasing global burden, particularly in countries like Indonesia, where the 
population has begun to age significantly. Current medications, including 
cholinesterase inhibitors and NMDA receptor antagonists, have modest effects on 
clinical symptoms in the early to middle stages, but there is no curative 
treatment available so far despite progress. Activating or repressing epigenetic 
modifications, including DNA methylation, histone modification and microRNA 
regulation, appears to play an important role in AD development. These 
alterations further enact transcriptional changes relevant to the signature AD 
pathologies of amyloid-β deposition, tau protein malfunctioning, 
neuroinflammation, and neuronal death. Here, we discuss the feasibility of 
targeting these epigenetic alterations as a new treatment strategy due to the 
reversibility of epigenetics and their ability to correct faulty gene 
expression. We also review the combined promise of stem cell therapies and 
epigenetic modulation in neurodegeneration, inflammation and cognitive decline. 
This combined approach may provide a multifaceted strategy to slow disease 
progression, replace lost neurons, and restore neural function. Despite 
challenges, including ethical, financial, and methodological barriers, ongoing 
research in epigenetic modulation and stem cell therapy holds promise for 
pioneering therapies in AD.

New Horizons in Menopause, Menopausal Hormone Therapy, and Alzheimer's Disease: 
Current Insights and Future Directions.

Accumulating evidence suggests that the effects of menopausal hormone therapy 
(MHT) on risk of Alzheimer disease (AD) and all-cause dementia are influenced by 
timing of initiation relative to age, time-since-menopause, and the type of 
formulation. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of MHT conducted in 
postmenopausal women ages 65 and older indicated an increased risk of dementia. 
While RCTs conducted in midlife are lacking, observational research has provided 
evidence for associations between midlife estrogen-only therapy (ET) use and a 
reduced risk of AD and dementia, whereas estrogen-progestogen therapy (EPT) was 
associated with more variable outcomes. However, existing studies are 
heterogenous, and conventional endpoints might not adequately assess MHT's 
potential for AD prevention. Herein, several approaches are being discussed, and 
the case is being made for utilizing AD biomarkers for assessment of early, 
AD-specific outcomes in relation to MHT use. From a clinical standpoint, 
findings that MHT may lower dementia risk warrant consideration as existing 
therapies like acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and memantine lack preventative 
efficacy, and vaccines for primary or secondary prevention are not yet 
available. MHT-associated risks, including breast cancer, stroke and venous 
thromboembolism, are generally considered rare (<10 events/10 000 women). 
Overall, the literature supports renewed research interest in evaluating MHT as 
a female-specific, time-sensitive approach for AD risk reduction, which is key 
to applying cumulated data in clinical decision making concerning AD prevention.

This study investigates the pharmaceutical potential both in vitro and in silico 
of ethanolic propolis extract from three Algerian regions namely Tahir-Jijel 
(TAH), Oued Athmania-Mila (ATH) and Oued Zhor-Skikda (OZ). Twenty-three 
compounds were identified via a high-performance liquid chromatography-diode 
array detector, with key constituents including caffeic acid, cynarin, chrysin, 
naringin and hesperetin. Moreover, antioxidant and anti-Alzheimer activities 
were assessed by multiple assays. Antimicrobial activity was tested against four 
pathogens and one yeast. The TAH extract showed the highest antioxidant 
activity, and ATH exhibited the strongest anticholinesterase activity. Extracts 
demonstrated potent inhibition against Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus 
luteus ATCC 4698. Docking studies revealed that cynarin was the most potent 
acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, and quercetin was the most potent 
butyrylcholinesterase inhibitor. These compounds were found to bind to both the 
catalytic site and the peripheral site, showing greater inhibitory potency than 
galantamine.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a type of neurodegenerative illness in which 
β-amyloid (Aβ) and tau protein accumulate in neurons in the form of tangles. The 
pathophysiological pathway of AD consists of Aβ-amyloid peptides, tau proteins, 
and oxidative stress in neurons and increased neuro-inflammatory response. Food 
and Drug Administration in the United States has authorized various drugs for 
the effective treatment of AD, which include galantamine, rivastigmine, 
donepezil, memantine, sodium oligomannate, lecanemab, and aducanumab. The major 
disadvantage of these drugs is that they only provide "symptomatic" relief. They 
are most effective in the early stages or for mild to moderate cases of the 
disease, but are not suitable for long-term use. Besides conventional therapies, 
phytochemicals have the potential to stop the progression of AD. According to 
research, the use of potential phytochemicals against AD has gained attention 
due to their potent anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-hyperphosphorylation of 
the tau protein, metal chelation, and anti-amyloid properties. This study seeks 
to provide an up-to-date compilation of the most current and promising 
breakthroughs in AD therapy using phytochemicals. It could be concluded that 
phytochemicals light serve as an effective therapy for AD. However, more 
mechanistic investigations are needed to determine the clinical implications of 
phytochemicals in AD treatment.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with no effective 
treatment, often preceded by mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Multimodal imaging 
genetics integrates imaging and genetic data to gain a deeper understanding of 
disease progression and individual variations. This study focuses on exploring 
the mechanisms that drive the transition from normal cognition to MCI and 
ultimately to AD. As an effective joint feature extraction and dimensionality 
reduction method, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and its improved 
variants, particularly the network-based non-negative matrix factorization 
(netNMF), have been widely used in multimodal analysis to mine brain imaging and 
genetic data by considering the interactions between different features. 
However, many of these methods overlook the importance of the coefficient matrix 
and do not address issues related to data accuracy and feature redundancy. To 
address these limitations, we propose an orthogonal sparse network non-negative 
matrix factorization (OSnetNMF) algorithm, which introduces orthogonal and 
sparse constraints based on netNMF. By establishing linear relationships between 
structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) and corresponding gene expression 
data, OSnetNMF reduces feature redundancy and decreases correlation between 
data, resulting in more accurate and reliable biomarker extraction. Experiments 
demonstrate that the OSnetNMF algorithm can accurately identify risk regions of 
interest (ROIs) and key genes that characterize AD progression, revealing 
significant trends in ROI pairs such as l4thVen-HIF1A, rBst-MPO, and rBst-PTK2B. 
Comparative experiments show that the improved algorithm outperforms traditional 
methods, identifying more disease-related biomarkers and achieving better 
reconstruction performance.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) significantly aggravates human dignity and quality of 
life. While newly approved amyloid immunotherapy has been reported, effective AD 
drugs remain to be identified. Here, we propose a novel AI-driven 
drug-repurposing method, DeepDrug, to identify a lead combination of approved 
drugs to treat AD patients. DeepDrug advances drug-repurposing methodology in 
four aspects. Firstly, it incorporates expert knowledge to extend candidate 
targets to include long genes, immunological and aging pathways, and somatic 
mutation markers that are associated with AD. Secondly, it incorporates a signed 
directed heterogeneous biomedical graph encompassing a rich set of nodes and 
edges, and node/edge weighting to capture crucial pathways associated with AD. 
Thirdly, it encodes the weighted biomedical graph through a Graph Neural Network 
into a new embedding space to capture the granular relationships across 
different nodes. Fourthly, it systematically selects the high-order drug 
combinations via diminishing return-based thresholds. A five-drug lead 
combination, consisting of Tofacitinib, Niraparib, Baricitinib, Empagliflozin, 
and Doxercalciferol, has been selected from the top drug candidates based on 
DeepDrug scores to achieve the maximum synergistic effect. These five drugs 
target neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and glucose metabolism, 
which are all related to AD pathology. DeepDrug offers a novel AI-and-big-data, 
expert-guided mechanism for new drug combination discovery and drug-repurposing 
across AD and other neuro-degenerative diseases, with immediate clinical 
applications.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a serious neurodegenerative disorder 
without a clear understanding of pathophysiology. Recent experimental data have 
suggested neuronal excitation-inhibition (E-I) imbalance as an essential element 
of AD pathology, but E-I imbalance has not been systematically mapped out for 
either local or large-scale neuronal circuits in AD, precluding precise 
targeting of E-I imbalance in AD treatment.
METHOD: In this work, we apply a Multiscale Neural Model Inversion (MNMI) 
framework to the resting-state functional MRI data from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to identify brain regions with disrupted E-I 
balance in a large network during AD progression.
RESULTS: We observe that both intra-regional and inter-regional E-I balance is 
progressively disrupted from cognitively normal individuals, to mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) and to AD. Also, we find that local inhibitory connections are 
more significantly impaired than excitatory ones and the strengths of most 
connections are reduced in MCI and AD, leading to gradual decoupling of neural 
populations. Moreover, we reveal a core AD network comprised mainly of limbic 
and cingulate regions. These brain regions exhibit consistent E-I alterations 
across MCI and AD, and thus may represent important AD biomarkers and 
therapeutic targets. Lastly, the E-I balance of multiple brain regions in the 
core AD network is found to be significantly correlated with the cognitive test 
score.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study constitutes an important attempt to delineate E-I 
imbalance in large-scale neuronal circuits during AD progression, which may 
facilitate the development of new treatment paradigms to restore physiological 
E-I balance in AD.

Plain Language Summary: The cells within the brain, neurons, communicate using 
excitatory and inhibitory activity. The Excitation-inhibition (E-I) balance is a 
measure of the contribution of excitatory and inhibitory communication. 
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a brain disorder in which memory, thinking and 
reasoning are disrupted. The E-I balance is found to be disrupted in people with 
AD. We applied a computational model to brain imaging data and found that E-I 
balance is progressively disrupted during AD progression. E-I balance could 
potentially be used to identify people with AD. Also, treatments could be 
developed that improve the E-I balance, possibly improving symptoms for people 
with AD.

Nanotechnology has experienced significant advancements, attracting considerable 
attention in various biomedical applications. This innovative study synthesizes 
and characterizes Ge/PLA/AuNCs (gelatin/PLA/gold nanocomposites) using Syzygium 
cumini extract to evaluate their various biomedical applications. The UV-Visible 
spectroscopy results in an absorption peak at 534 nm were primarily confirmed by 
Ge/PLA/AuNCs synthesis. The FTIR spectrum showed various functional groups and 
the XRD patterns confirmed the crystalline shape and structure of 
nanocomposites. The FESEM and HRTEM results showed a oval shape of Ge/PLA/AuNCs 
with an average particle size of 21 nm. The Ge/PLA/AuNC's remarkable antioxidant 
activity, as evidenced by DPPH (70.84 ± 1.64%), ABTS activity (86.17 ± 1.96%), 
and reducing power activity (78.42 ± 1.48%) at a concentration of 100 μg/mL was 
observed. The zone of inhibition against Staphylococcus aureus (19.45 ± 0.89 mm) 
and Echericia coli (20.83 ± 0.97 mm) revealed the excellent antibacterial 
activity of Ge/PLA/AuNCs. The anti-diabetic activity of Ge/PLA/AuNCs was 
supported by inhibition of α-amylase (82.56 ± 1.49%) and α-glucosidase 
(80.27 ± 1.57%). The anti-Alzheimer activity was confirmed by inhibition of the 
AChE (76.37 ± 1.18%) and BChE (85.94 ± 1.38%) enzymes. In vivo studies of 
zebrafish embryos showed that Ge/PLA/AuNCs have excellent biocompatibility and 
nontoxicity. The SH-SY5Y cell line study demonstrated improved cell viability 
(95.27 ± 1.62%) and enhanced neuronal cell growth following Ge/PLA/AuNCs 
treatment. In conclusion, the present study highlights the cost-effective and 
non-toxic properties of Ge/PLA/AuNCs. Furthermore, it presents an attractive and 
promising approach for various future biomedical applications.

As novel, anti-amyloid therapies have become more widely available, access to 
timely and accurate diagnosis has become integral to ensuring optimal treatment 
of patients with early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD). Plasma biomarkers are a 
promising tool for identifying AD pathology; however, several technical and 
clinical factors need to be considered prior to their implementation in routine 
clinical use. Given the rapid pace of advancements in the field and the wide 
array of available biomarkers and tests, this review aims to summarize these 
considerations, evaluate available platforms, and discuss the steps needed to 
bring plasma biomarker testing to the clinic. We focus on plasma 
phosphorylated(p)-tau, specifically plasma p-tau217, as a robust candidate 
across both primary and secondary care settings. Despite the high performance 
and robustness demonstrated in research, plasma p-tau217, like all plasma 
biomarkers, can be affected by analytical and pre-analytical variability as well 
as patient comorbidities, sex, ethnicity, and race. This review also discusses 
the advantages of the two-point cut-off approach to mitigating these factors, 
and the challenges raised by the resulting intermediate range measurements, 
where clinical guidance is still unclear. Further validation of plasma p-tau217 
in heterogeneous, real-world cohorts will help to increase confidence in testing 
and support establishing a standardized approach. Plasma biomarkers are poised 
to become a more affordable and less invasive alternative to PET and CSF 
testing. However, understanding the factors that impact plasma biomarker 
measurement and interpretation is critical prior to their implementation in 
routine clinical use.

BACKGROUND: One of the hallmark pathological characteristics of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) is amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulated in brain, which is mainly derived 
from the proteolytic processing of amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP). The 
ubiquitin-proteasome system is able to reduce Aβ generation by ubiquitination 
and degradation of AβPP. Icariin (ICA), a flavonoid isolated from Epimedium 
brevicornum Maxim., has been reported that it could regulate the metabolism of 
AβPP and reduce the Aβ level in AD in vivo and in vitro models.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the effect of ICA on AβPP and Aβ is related to 
AβPP ubiquitination.
METHODS: We used in vivo and in vitro models to observe the effect of ICA on 
AβPP ubiquitination as well as to investigate the effect of HMG-CoA reductase 
degradation protein 1 (HRD1), an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, on the processing 
of AβPP ubiquitination.
RESULTS: This study showed that ICA improved the cognitive abilities of APP/PS1 
AD mice in Morris Water Maze and Y-maze tests, upregulated HRD1 expression, 
subsequently elevated the total ubiquitination and K48-linked polyubiquitination 
of AβPP level, as well as increased AβPP degradation. Moreover, silenced HRD1 
gene abolished the aforementioned effects of ICA. Furthermore, ICA decreased the 
location of AβPP in the early endosome, where AβPP is cleaved into Aβ, evidenced 
by reducing the co-localization of AβPP and early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1).
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that ICA increased AβPP degradation by 
upregulating HRD1 mediated ubiquitination.

BACKGROUND: Spatial orientation is required for independent mobility in society. 
Deficits in spatial orientation can be an early symptom of Alzheimer's disease 
and other dementias, and there is a need for brief assessment tools to identify 
impairments.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the construct and known-group 
validity of our newly developed Spatial Orientation Screening (SOS) 
questionnaire.
METHODS: We included 132 patients with subjective cognitive decline (n = 16), 
mild cognitive impairment (n = 32), or all-cause dementia (n = 84) from a memory 
clinic and a reference group of cognitively unimpaired older adults (n = 108). 
The patients and their next-of-kin answered the self- and proxy-rated versions 
of the 4-item SOS (0-8 points) and the 10-item Questionnaire of Everyday 
Navigational Ability (QuENA, 0-30 points). The patients also performed the Floor 
Maze Test (FMT) for performance-based spatial abilities.
RESULTS: Mean ages (SD) of the patient and reference groups were 68.6 (±7.6) 
years and 73.7 (±6.7) years, respectively. Construct validity between self-rated 
versions of the SOS and QuENA was satisfactory with rs = 0.66, between the 
proxy-rated versions rs = 0.61, and between the proxy-reported SOS and FMT 
rs = 0.49 (all p < 0.001). Known-group validity was also acceptable, with 
significantly higher median (IQR) SOS self-reported scores in patients 1.0 (2.0) 
compared to the reference group 0.2 (0.5) points, (p < 0.001). Informants 
reported more severe impairments compared to the patients' self-reports on both 
SOS and QuENA (both p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The SOS had satisfactory validity for use as a screening instrument 
for assessment of spatial orientation in memory clinic patients.

BACKGROUND: Physical activity and fitness are major targets in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) preventive research. However, current research is heterogeneous and 
often disregards the relationship between these parameters and disease outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of physical activity and fitness on AD within 
the context of a multicomponent sports intervention.
METHODS: 46 participants with early-stage AD (mean age 70 ± 7 years, 18 women, 
mean Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score 19±5) were included in a 
six-month randomized controlled trial (Dementia-MOVE), participating in either a 
multicomponent sports intervention or a control condition with a 
psychoeducational program. The modulating effect of fitness and physical 
activity changes on AD outcome parameters such as cognition, function and 
cerebral brain structure from 3T-MRI were examined using multiple linear 
regression analyses.
RESULTS: An increase in VO2max was associated with assignment to the 
intervention group (p = 0.016), lower baseline fitness (p = 0.001), and an 
increased rate of physical activity (p = 0.046). Only in the intervention group, 
ΔVO2max had a beneficial modulating effect on the MoCA score (p = 0.039), the 
executive functions (p = 0.017) and regional brain volumes of the temporal lobe, 
e.g., the hippocampus (p = 0.044). High daily step count was associated with 
preserved executive functions (p = 0.001), and caregivers' quality of life 
(p ≤ 0.001) in the overall sample.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that multicomponent exercise improves 
cardiorespiratory fitness in AD, which is associated with advantageous 
developments in cognitive performance and preservation of brain structure. These 
findings suggest that especially patients with comparably worse cognition and 
fitness benefit and should be encouraged for activity engagement.

BACKGROUND: Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1) belongs to 
mitogen-activated protein kinases, which are essential for memory formation, 
cognitive function, and synaptic plasticity. During Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
ERK1 phosphorylates tau at 15 phosphorylation sites, leading to the formation of 
neurofibrillary tangles. The overactivation of ERK1 in microglia promotes the 
release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which results in neuroinflammation. 
Additionally, elevated oxidative stress during AD stimulates the ERK1 pathway, 
leading to neuronal loss.
OBJECTIVE: Because ERK1 signaling plays a significant role in tau 
phosphorylation, targeting ERK1 may be therapeutically beneficial by either 
preventing excessive activation of the signaling pathway or altering its pathway 
to enhance neuroprotective effects during AD.
METHODS: This study employed structure-based virtual screening of 
phytoconstituents from the IMPPAT library. Subsequently, in-depth docking and 
molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies were implemented to identify 
potential ERK1 inhibitors with desirable pharmacological properties.
RESULTS: Silandrin and Hydroxytuberosone were found to be potential ERK1 
inhibitors with higher affinity and specificity than the control molecule 
Tizaterkib. These compounds specifically bind to the ERK1 substrate binding 
pocket and interact with crucial residues. Finally, the elucidated compounds 
with ERK1 were evaluated using an all-atom molecular MD simulation to analyze 
structural dynamics, structural compactness, hydrogen bond dynamics, principal 
component analysis, and free energy landscape.
CONCLUSIONS: The study suggested that Silandrin and Hydroxytuberosone can 
further be exploited as potential lead molecules for therapeutic development 
against ERK1-mediated AD.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRDs) are increasingly 
common progressive conditions that have a substantial impact on individuals and 
their primary care partners-together described as a dyad. The stressors 
experienced by dyad members at around the time of ADRD diagnosis commonly 
produce clinically elevated emotional distress (ie, depression and anxiety 
symptoms), which can become chronic and negatively impact health, relationships, 
and the overall quality of life. Dyads commonly report unmet needs for early 
support to address these challenges early after diagnosis.
OBJECTIVE: This study is part of a larger study that has the primary objective 
to develop, adapt, and establish the feasibility of Resilient Together for 
Dementia (RT-ADRD), a novel dyadic skills-based intervention aimed at preventing 
chronic emotional distress early after diagnosis. The present study protocol 
describes an open pilot of the RT-ADRD intervention. This study will allow the 
study team to gather feedback on intervention components, administration of 
study measures, issues within general protocol, and perceptions about live video 
interventions prior to a larger feasibility trial.
METHODS: All study procedures will be conducted on the web (via phone and health 
care system-supported videoconferencing) to optimize accessibility, inclusion, 
and representativeness. Eligible dyads will include couples (up to N=10) 
referred from Mount Sinai Hospital (MSH) clinics within 3 months of an ADRD 
diagnosis. Dyads will be referred by their diagnosing clinicians (eg, 
neurologists, geriatricians, and neuropsychologists) and screened for 
eligibility. Eligible dyads will have at least one member who exhibits 
clinically elevated emotional distress and will demonstrate capacity to consent 
to research participation on a standardized assessment. Consenting dyads will 
complete baseline assessments of emotional distress, quality of life, 
relationship functioning, and resiliency skills. Dyads will then participate in 
6 weekly RT-ADRD sessions together (30-60 minutes each). After the conclusion of 
the intervention, dyad members will complete posttest assessments with similar 
measures as the pretest. Finally, dyads will participate together in a single 
60-minute exit interview to gather information on intervention content and 
procedures to refine the intervention before a pilot feasibility trial.
RESULTS: This study has been approved by the MSH institutional review board and 
is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT06421545). We anticipate that the study 
will be completed by late 2024.
CONCLUSIONS: We will use these results to administer changes and develop 
procedures for a pilot feasibility trial of RT-ADRD relative to a minimally 
enhanced control condition. Our study will allow us to gather comprehensive 
information on proposed RT-ADRD procedures and content and the best ways of 
delivering prevention-focused interventions to reduce the potential for chronic 
emotional distress stemming from ADRDs.

BACKGROUND: The amyloid cascade hypothesis still dominates in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), and the acceleration of the clearance efficiency of amyloid-β (Aβ) 
has been always considered as an effective treatment option to slow the 
occurrence and progression of AD.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the role of zkscan3 and its related 
pathways in AD of the microglia-mediated pathogenesis, and whether the combined 
effect of drugs can exert neuroprotective function.
METHODS: N9 mouse microglia and HT-22 mouse hippocampal neurons were randomly 
divided into 6 groups, qRT-PCR technique was used to detect the gene expression 
level of zkscan3 and the genes related to lysosome generation and function. 
Fourteen C57 mice were randomly divided into two groups, and drug intervention 
model mice were randomly selected to establish from the AD group. Transmission 
electron microscope was used to detect the cell status and lysosome function in 
the hippocampus together with the other two groups.
RESULTS: Compared with the AD model group, the gene expression of zkscan3 in the 
drug intervention group was downregulated, and the degree of neuronal injury in 
the hippocampus was reduced, the structure and number of synapses were improved, 
and the function of intracellular lysosome was enhanced.
CONCLUSIONS: Zkscan3 and its related genes play a vital role in the development 
of AD. CGRP and CHIT-1, as a combined intervention, imparts effects through 
zkscan3-related pathways to improve lysosomal function and exert certain 
neuroprotective effects.

Wogonin, an O-methylated flavonoid extracted from Scutellaria baicalensis, has 
demonstrated profound neuroprotective effects in a range of central nervous 
system (CNS) diseases. This review elucidates the pharmacological mechanisms 
underlying the protective effects of wogonin in CNS diseases, including ischemic 
stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, traumatic brain injury, epilepsy, anxiety, 
neurodegenerative diseases, and CNS infections. Wogonin modulates key signaling 
pathways, such as the MAPK, NF-κB, and ROS pathways, contributing to its 
anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antiapoptotic properties. In ischemic stroke 
models, wogonin reduces infarct size and enhances neurological outcomes by 
mitigating inflammation and oxidative stress. For patients with hemorrhagic 
stroke and traumatic brain injury, it accelerates hematoma regression, mitigates 
secondary brain damage, and promotes neurogenesis, making it an entirely new 
treatment option for patients with limited access to this type of therapy. Its 
anticonvulsant and anxiolytic effects are mediated through GABA-A receptor 
modulation. Moreover, wogonin shows promise in treating neurodegenerative 
diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease by promoting 
autophagy and reducing neuroinflammation. Additionally, it exhibits antiviral 
properties, offering potential benefits against CNS infections. Despite 
extensive preclinical evidence, further clinical studies are warranted to 
confirm its efficacy and safety in humans. This review highlights the great 
therapeutic potential of wogonin in terms of CNS protection. However, despite 
the substantial preclinical evidence, further large-scale clinical studies are 
necessary. Future researchers need to further explore the long-term efficacy and 
safety of wogonin in clinical trials and translate it for early application in 
the clinical treatment of true CNS disorders.

Microglia-mediated neuroinflammation plays a critical role in neuronal damage in 
neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Evidence shows that 
voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels regulate microglial activation. We 
previously reported that copper dyshomeostasis causes neuronal injury via 
activating microglia. This study was designed to explore the role of Kv1.1 
channels in copper-evoked microglial neuroinflammation. BV-2 microglial cells 
were treated with Cu(II). DiBAC4(3) was used to measure membrane potential. 
Microglial activation and neuronal loss were detected by enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay, Western blotting, and immunostaining. Learning and memory 
function was assessed with Morris water maze task. Cu(II) caused a 
hyperpolarized membrane potential in microglial cells, an effect abolished by 
functional Kv1.1 blockade. Blockade of Kv1.1 and knock-down of Kv1.1 with small 
interfering RNA repressed Cu(II)-induced microglial production of 
pro-inflammatory mediators. Also, Kv1.1 inhibition attenuated activation of 
PI3K/Akt-ERK1/2 signaling pathway and production of mitochondrial reactive 
oxidative species as well as nuclear factor-κB activation in Cu(II)-stimulated 
microglia. Moreover, the Cu(II)-caused, microglia-mediated neurotoxicity 
(indicated by reduced neuronal survival and increased dendritic loss) was 
attenuated by Kv1.1 knock-down. In an in vivo mouse model, hippocampal injection 
of Cu(II) caused elevated Kv1.1 mRNA (but not other Kv1 channels) expression and 
enhanced microglial Kv1.1 immunoreactivity in the hippocampus. Furthermore, 
blockade of Kv1.1 attenuated Cu(II)-induced microglial activation and neuronal 
dendritic loss in the hippocampus and learning and memory dysfunction. These 
findings suggest that inhibition of Kv1.1 ameliorates Cu(II)-induced microglial 
activation and cognitive impairment. Thus, it might represent a potential 
molecular target for anti-inflammatory therapy of neurodegenerative disorders.

Ganoderma lucidum is a traditional Chinese medicine used to treat Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), whose main active ingredient is polysaccharides. A 
heteropolysaccharide named GLPZ-1 was isolated from Ganoderma lucidum. GLPZ-1 
(6.608 kDa) predominantly consisted of Glc and minor Gal. The results of GC-MS 
and NMR analyses indicated that the backbone of GLPZ-1 was mainly composed of 
1,4-α-D-Glcp, 1,4,6-α-Glcp and a minor amount of 1,3,4-β-D-Glcp, which was 
substituted with complex side chains at C-6 of 1,4,6-α-D-Glcp and at C-3 of 
1,3,4-β-D-Glcp. GLPZ-1 demonstrated a protective effect on AD rats by improving 
behavioral abnormalities, alleviating pathological damage and ameliorating 
levels of IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α and Th17, which were associated with GLPZ-1 
modulating the microbiota-gut-metabolomics of AD rats. GLPZ-1 regulated the gut 
microbiota in AD rats by increasing the abundance of Bacteroides, 
unclassified_Lachnospiraceae, Lactobacillus, Pediococcus, Oscillibacter, 
Lachnoclostridium and Bifidobacterium, while simultaneously reducing the 
abundance of Pseudomonas and Desulfovibrio. GLPZ-1 could regulate fecal 
metabolites in AD rats tending towards the normal levels. These regulated fecal 
metabolites belonged to fatty acid metabolism, cholesterol and bile acid 
metabolism, neurotransmitters and aromatic amino acid metabolism. These findings 
provide a preliminary research basis for the exploitation of GLPZ-1 as an 
effective drug to prevent and delay AD.

In our previous study, the whole cells containing an aldo-keto reductase (yhdN) 
and glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) were constructed and applied in a 
stereoselective carbonyl reduction reaction to prepare (S)-NEMCA-HEPE, being a 
key chiral intermediate of (S)-Rivastigmine which is widely prescribed for the 
treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Although the conversion and enantiomeric 
excess (e.e.) could reach to 78.2 % and 99 %, respectively, ionic liquid as an 
additive was required to improve the permeability of cell membrane. To further 
simplify the reaction, the molecular docking and saturation mutagenesis 
technology were used here to obtain an activity-improved yhdN variant such as 
G19A. And then, both excellent conversion and e.e. of 99 % for (S)-NEMCA-HEPE 
could be achieved within 40 min by using only G19A-GDH whole cell as a catalyst 
without any additive. However, the use of the whole cells still faces the issues 
of poor operation stability and adverse application prospect. Subsequently, a 
hydrophobic "cell-in-shell" complex of G19A-GDH@O-Silica was constructed by 
using a silica nanocoated technology. The obtained G19A-GDH@O-Silica exhibited 
an excellent conversion towards the asymmetric carbonyl reduction, and a good 
tolerance in changing thermal, pH, and storage environmental. Giving 76.3 % of 
reaction conversion even after the 11th cycle of reuse, indicated that 
G19A-GDH@O-Silica also possessed ideal recyclability. The aim of this study is 
to provide a rapid, and cost-effective nanocoated whole-cell biocatalyst for 
efficient preparation of (S)-NEMCA-HEPE. The simplicity and robustness of the 
immobilization approach may become a powerful tool to utilize whole-cell 
catalysts towards organic catalysis.
