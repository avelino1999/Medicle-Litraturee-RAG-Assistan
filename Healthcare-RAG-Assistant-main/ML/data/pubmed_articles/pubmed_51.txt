The ubiquitin-protein ligase E3A (UBE3A, aka E6-AP), an E3 ligase belonging to 
the HECT family, plays crucial roles in the stability of various proteins 
through the proteasomal degradation system. Abnormal UBE3A activity is essential 
for the initiation and progression of several cancers. A gain of function and an 
overdosage of maternal UBE3A is associated with an increased risk of autism 
spectrum disorders. Conversely, a loss of function due to mutations, deletions, 
paternal duplications, or imprinting defects in neurons leads to Angelman 
syndrome. Emerging evidence suggests that abnormal UBE3A activity may also 
contribute to the development of various brain disorders, including 
schizophrenia, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's 
disease, making UBE3A a protein of significant interest. However, research on 
UBE3A's functions in the brain has primarily focused on neurons due to the 
imprinting of UBE3A in mature neuronal cells, while being obscured in glia. This 
review outlines the expression of UBE3A in neurons and glial cells based on 
published studies, highlights newly identified patterns of UBE3A, such as its 
secretion, and emphasizes the involvement of UBE3A in neurodegenerative 
diseases. Furthermore, we summarize glial UBE3A and propose a model of 
bi-directional interactions between the neurons and glia mediated by UBE3A that 
underlies brain functions. Insights gained from this research could provide new 
avenues for therapeutic interventions targeting various brain disorders.

Non-invasive, non-contact, and painless methods of electrical stimulation to 
enhance neural function have been widely studied in recent years, particularly 
in the context of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
and related dementias, which cause cognitive decline and other neurological 
symptoms. Radiofrequency (RF), which is a rate of oscillation in the range of 3 
kHz to 300 GHz (3 THz), has been suggested as one potential non-contact neuronal 
stimulation (NCNS) technique for improving brain function. A new type of 
electrical stimulation uses a radiofrequency electromagnetic field (RF-EMF). RF 
exposure has been shown to modulate neural stimulation and influence various 
brain activities in in vitro and in vivo models. Recent studies have explored 
the effects of RF-EMF on human physiology, particularly in areas such as brain 
activity, cognition, and sleep behavior. In this review, we summarize recent 
findings about the effects of non-contact stimulations in in vitro studies, in 
vivo animal models, and human clinical cases.

As the blood-brain barrier (BBB) prevents molecules from accessing the central 
nervous system (CNS), the traditional systemic delivery of chemical drugs limits 
the development of neurological drugs. However, in recent years, innovative 
therapeutic strategies have tried to bypass the restriction of traditional drug 
delivery methods. In vivo gene therapy refers to emerging biopharma vectors that 
carry the specific genes and target and infect specific tissues; these infected 
cells and tissues then undergo fundamental changes at the genetic level and 
produce therapeutic proteins or substances, thus providing therapeutic benefits. 
Clinical and preclinical trials mainly utilize adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), 
lentiviruses (LVs), and other viruses as gene vectors for disease investigation. 
Although LVs have a higher gene-carrying capacity, the vector of choice for many 
neurological diseases is the AAV vector due to its safety and long-term 
transgene expression in neurons. Here, we review the basic biology of AAVs and 
summarize some key issues in recombinant AAV (rAAV) engineering in gene therapy 
research; then, we summarize recent clinical trials using rAAV treatment for 
neurological diseases and provide translational perspectives and future 
challenges on target selection.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by a gradual decline in cognitive function. Currently, there are 
no effective treatments for this condition. Medicine food homology plants have 
gained increasing attention as potential natural treatments for AD because of 
their nutritional value and therapeutic benefits. In this work, we aimed to 
provide a deeper understanding of how medicine food homology plants may help 
alleviate or potentially treat AD by identifying key targets, pathways, and 
small molecule compounds from 10 medicine food homology plants that play an 
important role in this process. Using network pharmacology, we identified 623 
common targets between AD and the compounds from the selected 10 plants, 
including crucial proteins such as STAT3, IL6, TNF, and IL1B. Additionally, the 
small molecules from the selected plants were grouped into four clusters using 
hierarchical clustering. The ConPlex algorithm was then applied to predict the 
binding capabilities of these small molecules to the key protein targets. 
Cluster 3 showed superior predicted binding capabilities to STAT3, TNF, and 
IL1B, which was further validated by molecular docking. Scaffold analysis of 
small molecules in Cluster 3 revealed that those with a steroid-like 
core-comprising three fused six-membered rings and one five-membered ring with a 
carbon-carbon double bond-exhibited better predicted binding affinities and were 
potential triple-target inhibitors. Among them, MOL005439, MOL000953, and 
MOL005438 were identified as the top-performing compounds. This study highlights 
the potential of medicine food homology plants as a source of active compounds 
that could be developed into new drugs for AD treatment. However, further 
pharmacokinetic studies are essential to assess their efficacy and minimize side 
effects.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive cognition and behavior 
impairments. Diagnosing AD early is important for clinicians to slow down AD 
progression and preserve brain function. Biomarkers such as tau protein and 
amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) are used to aid diagnosis as clinical diagnosis often 
lags. Additionally, biomarkers can be used to monitor AD status and evaluate AD 
treatment. Clinicians detect these AD biomarkers in the brain using positron 
emission tomography/computed tomography or in the cerebrospinal fluid using a 
lumbar puncture. However, these methods are expensive and invasive. In contrast, 
saliva collection is simple, inexpensive, non-invasive, stress-free, and 
repeatable. Moreover, damage to the brain parenchyma can impact the oral cavity 
and some pathogenic molecules could travel back and forth from the brain to the 
mouth. This has prompted researchers to explore biomarkers in the saliva. 
Therefore, this study provides an overview of the main finding of salivary 
biomarkers for AD diagnosis. Based on these available studies, Aβ, tau, 
cholinesterase enzyme activity, lactoferrin, melatonin, cortisol, proteomics, 
metabolomics, exosomes, and the microbiome were changed in AD patients' saliva 
when compared to controls. However, well-designed studies are essential to 
confirm the reliability and validity of these biomarkers in diagnosing and 
monitoring AD.

The role of amyloid beta peptide (Aβ) in memory regulation has been a subject of 
substantial interest and debate in neuroscience, because of both physiological 
and clinical issues. Understanding the dual nature of Aβ in memory regulation is 
crucial for developing effective treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Moreover, accurate detection and quantification methods of Aβ isoforms have been 
tested for diagnostic purposes and therapeutic interventions. This review 
provides insight into the current knowledge about the methods of amyloid beta 
detection in vivo and in vitro by fluid tests and brain imaging methods (PET), 
which allow for preclinical recognition of the disease. Currently, the priority 
in the development of new therapies for Alzheimer's disease has been given to 
potential changes in the progression of the disease. In light of increasing 
amounts of data, this review was focused on the diagnostic and therapeutic 
employment of amyloid beta in Alzheimer's disease.

Diabetes constitutes a risk factor for cognitive impairment, whereas insulin 
resistance serves as the shared pathogenesis underlying both diabetes and 
cognitive decline. The use of metformin for treating cognitive impairment 
remains controversial. The present study found that hesperetin, a flavanone 
derived from citrus peel, enhanced metformin's efficacy in reducing blood sugar 
levels, improving insulin sensitivity, and ameliorating cognitive impairment in 
diabetic rats. Additionally, it reduced the required dosage of metformin to 
one-third of its conventional dose. Transcriptome analysis and 16S rRNA 
sequencing revealed that the activation of insulin and cyclic-adenosine 
monophosphate response element binding protein (CREB)/brain-derived neurotrophic 
factor (BDNF) pathways benefited from the regulation of gut microbiota and the 
promotion of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) producers such as Romboutsia. 
Furthermore, this study demonstrated that hesperetin supplementation 
counteracted the upregulation of β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving 
enzyme 1 (BACE1), a pathological factor of Alzheimer's disease (AD) that was 
induced by metformin. Our findings reveal that hesperetin can be used in 
supplementary treatment for cognitive impairment associated with diabetes.

Tacrolimus (TAC) has emerged as a potential therapy for Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), with the challenge of balancing its therapeutic benefits against its 
immunosuppressive effects. This study explores the efficacy of a 
sub-immunosuppressive TAC dosing regimen to ameliorate AD-related pathologies. 
TAC was administered daily for 14 days, with drug concentrations measured via 
liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in whole blood and 
hippocampal tissue from C57BL6J mice, while immunofluorescence analyses and 
Western blotting (performed on hippocampal extracts) were conducted in 10-12 
month old 3xTg-AD mice to evaluate levels of tau and amyloid-beta (Aβ) proteins. 
The results from LC-MS/MS revealed that lower TAC doses resulted in 
sub-immunosuppressive blood levels, while still penetrating the hippocampi. 
Immunofluorescence showed reductions in tau and Aβ proteins in 3xTg-AD mice. 
Additionally, Western blot analyses revealed reductions in tau and Aβ, along 
with increases in synaptic and autophagy-related proteins. These findings 
highlight the potential of sub-immunosuppressive TAC doses in effectively 
targeting AD pathology while minimizing the risk of chronic systemic 
immunosuppression. Further research and clinical trials are warranted to 
establish the optimal TAC dosing regimen for AD treatment.

Vitamin K is essential for many physiological processes, including coagulation, 
bone metabolism, tissue calcification, and antioxidant activity. Vitamin K 
vitamers are represented by lipophilic compounds with similar chemical structure 
(i.e., phylloquinone (vitamin K1) and menaquinone (vitamin K2)). Vitamin K 
deficiency can affect coagulation and vascular calcification, increasing the 
risk of hemorrhages, atherosclerosis, cerebrovascular diseases, and 
neurodegeneration. Recently, several studies have hypothesized a possible dual 
role of vitamin K vitamers in benefiting both vascular and cerebral health, 
e.g., by sphingolipids biosynthesis or ferroptosis inhibition. The aim of this 
narrative review is to deepen the understanding of biological activities of 
vitamin K and its possible dual protective/preventive actions in neurovascular 
and degenerative conditions, e.g., stroke and dementia. Given the difficulties 
related to hemorrhagic risk entailed in the prevention of strokes, the function 
of vitamin K antagonists is also investigated. Finally, we track the development 
of a clinical concept for a future preventive strategy and innovative use of 
vitamin K as a supplement to counteract neurovascular and pathological 
processes, focusing in particular on stroke and dementia.

27-Hydroxymangiferolic acid (27-HMA) is a naturally occurring compound in mango 
fruits that exhibits diverse biological functions. Here, we show that 27-HMA 
activates the transcriptional activity of farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a nuclear 
receptor transcription factor, extending the lifespan and healthspan in 
Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). Meanwhile, the longevity-promoting effect 
of 27-HMA was attenuated in the mutants of nhr-8 and daf-12, the FXR homologs, 
indicating that the longevity effects of 27-HMA in C. elegans may depend on 
nuclear hormone receptors (NHRs). Further analysis revealed potential 
associations between the longevity effects of 27-HMA and the 
insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling (IIS)/TORC1 pathway. Moreover, 
27-HMA increased the toxin resistance of nematodes and activated the expression 
of detoxification genes, which rely on NHRs. Finally, 27-HMA improved the 
age-related neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's 
disease (PD) C. elegans models. Taken together, our findings suggest that 27-HMA 
is a novel FXR agonist and may prolong lifespan and healthspan via activating 
NHRs.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a significant global health challenge, 
affecting millions worldwide and imposing substantial burdens on healthcare 
systems. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in deep learning 
and machine learning, have revolutionized neuroimaging-based AD diagnosis. 
However, the complexity and lack of interpretability of these models limit their 
clinical applicability. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) addresses this 
challenge by providing insights into model decision-making, enhancing 
transparency, and fostering trust in AI-driven diagnostics. This review explores 
the role of XAI in AD neuroimaging, highlighting key techniques such as SHAP, 
LIME, Grad-CAM, and Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP). We examine their 
applications in identifying critical biomarkers, tracking disease progression, 
and distinguishing AD stages using various imaging modalities, including MRI and 
PET. Additionally, we discuss current challenges, including dataset limitations, 
regulatory concerns, and standardization issues, and propose future research 
directions to improve XAI's integration into clinical practice. By bridging the 
gap between AI and clinical interpretability, XAI holds the potential to refine 
AD diagnostics, personalize treatment strategies, and advance neuroimaging-based 
research.

BACKGROUND: Therapeutic development for frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is 
hindered by the lack of biomarkers that inform susceptibility/risk, prognosis, 
and the underlying causative pathology. Blood glial fibrillary acidic protein 
(GFAP) has garnered attention as a FTD biomarker. However, investigations of 
GFAP in FTD have been hampered by symptomatic and histopathologic heterogeneity 
and small cohort sizes contributing to inconsistent findings. Therefore, we 
evaluated plasma GFAP as a FTD biomarker and compared its performance to that of 
neurofilament light (NfL) protein, a leading FTD biomarker.
METHODS: We availed ARTFL LEFFTDS Longitudinal Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration 
(ALLFTD) study resources to conduct a comprehensive cross-sectional and 
longitudinal examination of the susceptibility/risk, prognostic, and predictive 
performance of GFAP and NfL in the largest series of well-characterized 
presymptomatic FTD mutation carriers and participants with sporadic or familial 
FTD syndromes. Utilizing single molecule array technology, we measured GFAP and 
NfL in plasma from 161 controls, 127 presymptomatic mutation carriers, 702 
participants with a FTD syndrome, and 67 participants with mild behavioral 
and/or cognitive changes. We used multivariable linear regression and Cox 
proportional hazard models adjusted for co-variates to examine the biomarker 
utility of baseline GFAP and NfL concentrations or their rates of change.
RESULTS: Compared to controls, GFAP and NfL were elevated in each FTD syndrome 
but GFAP, unlike NfL, poorly discriminated controls from participants with mild 
symptoms. Similarly, both baseline GFAP and NfL were higher in presymptomatic 
mutation carriers who later phenoconverted, but NfL better distinguished 
non-converters from phenoconverters. We additionally observed that GFAP and NfL 
were associated with disease severity indicators and survival, but NfL far 
outperformed GFAP. Nevertheless, we validated findings that the GFAP/NfL ratio 
may discriminate frontotemporal lobar degeneration with tau versus TDP-43 
pathology.
CONCLUSIONS: Our head-to-head comparison of plasma GFAP and NfL as biomarkers 
for FTD indicate that NfL consistently outmatched GFAP as a prognostic and 
predictive biomarker for participants with a FTD syndrome, and as a 
susceptibility/risk biomarker for people at genetic risk of FTD. Our findings 
underscore the need to include leading biomarkers in investigations evaluating 
new biomarkers if the field is to fully ascertain their performance and clinical 
value.

Neuroinflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of various central 
nervous system (CNS) diseases. The NLRP3 inflammasome is an important 
intracellular multiprotein complex composed of the innate immune receptor NLRP3, 
the adaptor protein ASC, and the protease caspase-1. The activation of the NLRP3 
inflammasome can induce pyroptosis and the release of the proinflammatory 
cytokines IL-1β and IL-18, thus playing a central role in immune and 
inflammatory responses. Recent studies have revealed that the NLRP3 inflammasome 
is activated in the brain to induce neuroinflammation, leading to further 
neuronal damage and functional impairment, and contributes to the pathological 
process of various neurological diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, 
Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and stroke. In this review, we 
summarize the important role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the pathogenesis of 
neuroinflammation and the pathological course of CNS diseases and discuss 
potential approaches to target the NLRP3 inflammasome for the treatment of CNS 
diseases.

Periodontal disease is a risk factor for many systemic diseases such as 
Alzheimer's disease and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Cleft palate (CP), the most 
common congenital craniofacial defect, has a multifaceted etiology influenced by 
complex genetic and environmental risk factors such as maternal bacterial or 
virus infection. A prior case-control study revealed a surprisingly strong 
association between maternal periodontal disease and CP in offspring. However, 
the precise relationship remains unclear. In this study, the relationship 
between maternal oral pathogen and CP in offspring was studied by sonicated P. 
gingivalis injected intravenously and orally into pregnant mice. We investigated 
an obvious increasing CP (12.5%) in sonicated P. gingivalis group which had 
inhibited osteogenesis in mesenchyme and blocked efferocytosis in epithelium. 
Then glycolysis and H4K12 lactylation (H4K12la) were detected to elevate in both 
mouse embryonic palatal mesenchyme (MEPM) cells and macrophages under P. 
gingivalis exposure which further promoted the transcription of metallopeptidase 
domain17 (ADAM17), subsequently mediated the shedding of transforming growth 
factor-beta receptor 1 (TGFBR1) in MEPM cells and mer tyrosine kinase (MerTK) in 
macrophages and resulted in the suppression of efferocytosis and osteogenesis in 
palate, eventually caused abnormalities in palate fusion and ossification. The 
abnormal efferocytosis also led to a predominance of M1 macrophages, which 
indirectly inhibited palatal osteogenesis via extracellular vesicles. 
Furthermore, pharmacological ADAM17 inhibition could ameliorate the abnormality 
of P. gingivalis-induced abnormal palate development. Therefore, our study 
extends the knowledge of how maternal oral pathogen affects fetal palate 
development and provides a novel perspective to understand the pathogenesis of 
CP.

The purpose of this study was to recognise predictive biomarkers and explore the 
promising therapeutic targets of AD with depression. We confirmed a positive 
correlation between AD and depression through MR Analysis. Through WGCNA 
analysis, we identified 1569 genes containing two modules, which were most 
related to AD. In addition, 1629 depressive DEGs were also identified. In these 
genes, 84 genes were shared by both AD and depression, which were screened by 
the Degree algorithm, MCC algorithm, and four machine learning algorithms. Two 
genes (ITGB5 and SPCS1) were confirmed as predictive biomarkers with AUC > 0.7. 
Furthermore, the nomogram indicated that ITGB5 and SPCS1 are good biomarkers in 
diagnosing AD with depression. Four drugs targeted at ITGB5 were determined by 
the DGIdb website. In conclusion, we identified two predictive biomarkers for AD 
with depression, thus providing promising therapeutic targets for AD with 
depression.

BACKGROUND: The swift rise in the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
alongside its significant societal and economic impact has created a pressing 
demand for effective interventions and treatments. However, there are no 
available treatments that can modify the progression of the disease.
METHODS: Eight AD brain tissues datasets and three blood datasets were obtained. 
Consensus clustering was utilized as a method to discern the various subtypes of 
AD. Then, module genes were screened using weighted correlation network analysis 
(WGCNA). Furthermore, screening hub genes was conducted through machine-learning 
analyses. Finally, A comprehensive analysis using a systematic approach to 
druggable genome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) was conducted.
RESULTS: Two AD subclasses were identified, namely cluster.A and cluster.B. The 
levels of gamma secretase activity, beta secretase activity, and amyloid-beta 42 
were found to be significantly elevated in patients classified within cluster A 
when compared to those in cluster B. Furthermore, by utilizing the 
differentially expressed genes shared among these clusters, along with 
identifying druggable genes and applying WGCNA to these subtypes, we were able 
to develop a scoring system referred to as DG.score. This scoring system has 
demonstrated remarkable predictive capability for AD when evaluated against 
multiple datasets. Besides, A total of 30 distinct genes that may serve as 
potential drug targets for AD were identified across at least one of the 
datasets investigated, whether derived from brain samples or blood analyses. 
Among the identified genes, three specific candidates that are considered 
druggable (LIMK2, MAPK8, and NDUFV2) demonstrated significant expression levels 
in both blood and brain tissues. Furthermore, our research also revealed a 
potential association between the levels of LIMK2 and concentrations of CSF Aβ 
(OR 1.526 (1.155-2.018)), CSF p-tau (OR 1.106 (1.024-01.196)), and hippocampal 
size (OR 0.831 (0.702-0.948)).
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a notable advancement to the existing 
literature by offering genetic evidence that underscores the potential 
therapeutic advantages of focusing on the druggable gene LIMK2 in the treatment 
of AD. This insight not only contributes to our understanding of AD but also 
guides future drug discovery efforts.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) constitutes approximately 70 % of dementia cases and is 
the most prevalent form of dementia. Current therapeutic options, including 
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor 
antagonists, provide symptomatic relief but do not cure the disease and often 
come with side effects. The primary pathological features of AD are amyloid 
plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, with amyloid plaques formed by the abnormal 
accumulation of Amyloid-β (Aβ). BACE1 (β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1), a 
β-secretase, is a key initiator in amyloidosis. Previous research has shown that 
G-Bro hydrolysate, produced from the bromelain hydrolysis of gliadin, has 
optimal BACE1 inhibitory efficiency. This study employs G-Bro hydrolysate for 
nano UHPLC-ESI Q-TOF mass spectrometry to identify peptide fragment sequences 
and conducts BACE1 inhibition assays to isolate the most effective peptide, 
VR-peptide. Using the N2a/PS/APP cell model, we explored the impact of 
chemically synthesized VR-peptide on BACE1 protein expression, the secretion of 
soluble APP (sAPP), and levels of Aβ and intracellular Aβ1-42. Results 
demonstrate that VR-peptide achieves a BACE1 inhibitory rate of 63.8 % and 
reduces BACE1 expression by over 90 % in comparison with untreated N2a/PS/APP 
cells. It shifts the balance between extracellular Aβ monomers and aggregates, 
favoring monomer formation and decreasing intracellular Aβ1-42 levels by over 
56 %, underscoring its neuroprotective potential. In conclusion, VR-peptide 
exhibits promise as a BACE1 inhibitor and a preventive agent against Alzheimer's 
disease. Derived from hydrolyzed cereal foods, it could be effectively paired 
with a suitable drug delivery system for enhanced neuronal penetration, paving 
the way for neuroprotective peptide products targeting Alzheimer's disease.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCY: Lancao decoction (LC) is a traditional Chinese 
medicine (TCM) formulation mentioned in the "Huangdineijing", known for its 
ability to dispel turbidity and eliminate heat. TCM believes that the etiology 
of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is phlegm turbidity, and the fiery internal 
obstruction of the gods, which suggests that LC has the possibility of treating.
AIM OF THE STUDY: This investigation will examine the possibilities of LC to 
improve AD and uncover the underlying mechanisms.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Gas chromatography (GC) and HPLC-MS were used to identify 
the content of the primary elements in LC and test the stability of its 
extraction. The function of LC in ameliorating AD was characterized by utilizing 
behavioral assessments such as the Morris water maze (MWM) and the Y-maze in AD 
modeling mice. Levels of molecular signaling and neurogenesis within the 
hippocampus was assessed using Western blot and immunostaining. Pharmacological 
interventions were used to explore the association of specific targets with 
neurogenesis and synaptic proteins and their contributions in LC improvement of 
AD.
RESULTS: The main components of LC include p-Cymene, 3-Methoxy-p-cymene, neryl 
acetate, gallic acid, protocatechuic acid and euparin. APP/PS1 mice displayed 
behavioral characteristics indicative of memory and learning deficits, such as a 
notably longer time taken to reach the platform and reduced time spent in the 
area without the platform in the Morris Water Maze (MWM), as well as a longer 
delay in exploring the new arm and less time spent in the new arm in the Y-maze, 
when compared to C57BL6/J mice. However, these impairments were alleviated by 
chronic treatment with either LC or donepezil (DON) over a period of 14 days. 
Additionally, the phosphorylated levels of CaMKII and the amounts of synaptic 
proteins (synapsin1 and PSD95) were greatly diminished within the hippocampal 
region of APP/PS1 mice, which were also reversed by LC or DON. In addition, Aβ 
area was obviously increased in the hippocampus of the APP/PS1 murine model, 
which was also reversed by LC or DON. Inhibition of CaMKII activities not only 
blunted LC's therapeutic actions of AD, but also blocked the enhancements of LC 
on synaptic proteins in the hippocampus, the quantity of cells that are 
co-stained with BrdU and DCX, and Ki67-positive cells located in the dentate 
gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus.
CONCLUSION: The results indicated that LC activated CaMKII to relieve Aβ 
formation, thereby enhancing neuronal functions in the hippocampus, and thus 
alleviated AD, which provided a theoretical basis for a deeper understanding of 
the mechanism, clinical application, and subsequent research of LC in 
alleviating AD.

A key molecule in cellular metabolism, citrate is essential for lipid 
biosynthesis, energy production, and epigenetic control. The etiology of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative illness marked by 
memory loss and cognitive decline, may be linked to dysregulated citrate 
transport, according to recent research. Citrate transporters, which help 
citrate flow both inside and outside of cells, are becoming more and more 
recognized as possible participants in the molecular processes underlying AD. 
Citrate synthase (CS), a key enzyme in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, 
supports mitochondrial function and neurotransmitter synthesis, particularly 
acetylcholine (ACh), essential for cognition. Changes in CS activity affect 
citrate availability, influencing energy metabolism and neurotransmitter 
production. Choline, a precursor for ACh, is crucial for neuronal function. 
Lipid metabolism, oxidative stress reactions, and mitochondrial function can all 
be affected by aberrant citrate transport, and these changes are linked to 
dementia. Furthermore, the two main pathogenic characteristics of AD, tau 
hyperphosphorylation and amyloid-beta (Aβ) aggregation, may be impacted by 
disturbances in citrate homeostasis. The goal of this review is to clarify the 
complex function of citrate transporters in AD and provide insight into how they 
contribute to the development and course of the illness. We aim to provide an 
in-depth idea of which particular transporters are dysregulated in AD and 
clarify the functional implications of these dysregulated transporters in brain 
cells. To reduce neurodegenerative processes and restore metabolic equilibrium, 
we have also discussed the therapeutic potential of regulating citrate 
transport. Gaining insight into the relationship between citrate transporters 
and the pathogenesis of AD may help identify new indicators for early detection 
and creative targets for treatment. This study offers hope for more potent ways 
to fight this debilitating illness and is a crucial step in understanding the 
metabolic foundations of AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the chief cause of dementia and related mortality 
worldwide due to progressive accumulation of amyloid peptide (Aβ) and 
hyperphosphorylated tau protein. These neuropathological changes lead to 
cognitive impairment and memory dysfunction. Notably, most Food drug 
Administration (FDA) approved anti-AD medications such as tacrine and donepezil 
are engaged with symptomatic relief of cognitive impairment but do not reverse 
the underlying AD neuropathology. Therefore, searching for new anti-AD is 
advisable. It has been shown that the inflammatory signaling pathways such as 
mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) are intricate with the Aβ and tau 
protein neuropathology in AD. In addition, inhibition of brain MAPK plays a 
critical role in mitigating cognitive dysfunction in early-onset AD. Though, the 
fundamental mechanisms for the beneficial effects of MAPK inhibitors were not 
fully explained. Therefore, this review aims to discuss the potential molecular 
mechanisms of MAPK inhibitors in AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegeneration driven by beta-amyloid (Aβ) 
deposits in the brain involving autophagy dysfunction. Ginsenoside Rg1, a 
pharmacologically active compound found in ginseng, has possible therapeutic 
effects for AD. This study discovered that FGR proto-oncogene (FGR) was a 
therapeutic target of Rg1 in AD and it was possibly involved in autophagy. 
C57BL/6 J mice were injected with 5 μL (1 μg/mL) Aβ1-42 in the right lateral 
ventricle to establish an AD model. AD mouse hippocampus had high FGR 
expression. Intragastrically administered Rg1 (40 mg/kg) decreased FGR protein 
levels in AD mice's hippocampus and improved memory function in AD mice. Both 
sides of the mice hippocampal fissure were administered with 2 μL lentiviral 
particles (1 × 107 TU) containing FGR overexpression plasmids. FGR 
overexpression rendered Rg1 ineffectual in restoring memory function and 
reducing hippocampal neuron damage. We injected 2 μL lentiviral particles 
(1 × 107 TU) containing short hairpin RNA plasmids targeting FGR to the mice 
hippocampal fissures. FGR knockdown improved spatial memory function of AD mice, 
reduced hippocampal neuron apoptosis, and prevented Aβ accumulation. HT22 cells 
were transfected with small interfering RNA targeting FGR. FGR knockdown 
increased the viability of Aβ1-42 treated HT22 cells. BACE1 and LC3II/I protein 
levels were decreased and p62 and SIRT1 were increased in AD mice and cells with 
FGR knockdown. LC3 was down-regulated after inhibiting FGR expression in Aβ1-42 
treated hippocampal neurons. In conclusion, Rg1 exerts anti-AD functions by 
targeting FGR and downregulating its expression.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial disorder associated with 
neuroinflammation, elevated oxidative stress, lipid alterations as well as 
amyloid-deposits and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles. Ibuprofen, a 
globally used analgesic, is discussed to influence disease progression due to 
its anti-inflammatory effect. However, changes in lipid-homeostasis induced by 
Ibuprofen have not yet been analyzed. Here we investigate the effect of 
Ibuprofen on lipid classes known to be associated with AD. Ibuprofen treatment 
leads to a significant increase in phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin and 
triacylglyceride (TAG) species whereas plasmalogens, which are highly 
susceptible for oxidation, were significantly decreased. The observed 
alterations in phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin levels in presence of 
Ibuprofen might counteract the reduced phosphatidylcholine- and 
sphingomyelin-levels found in AD brain tissue with potential positive aspects on 
synaptic plasticity and ceramide-induced apoptotic effects. On the other hand, 
Ibuprofen leads to elevated TAG-level resulting in the formation of lipid 
droplets which are associated with neuroinflammation. Reduction of 
plasmalogen-levels might accelerate decreased plasmalogen-levels found in AD 
brains. Treatment of Ibuprofen in terms of lipid-homeostasis reveals both 
potentially positive and negative changes relevant to AD. Therefore, 
understanding the influence of Ibuprofen on lipid-homeostasis may help to 
understand the heterogeneous results of studies treating AD with Ibuprofen.

Ectoine, a cytoprotective compound derived from bacteria and categorized as a 
postbiotic, is increasingly recognized as a viable alternative to traditional 
therapeutic agents, frequently presenting considerable side effects. This 
extensive review underscores the effectiveness of ectoine as a postbiotic in 
managing conditions such as rhinosinusitis, atopic dermatitis, and allergic 
rhinitis, all while demonstrating a commendable safety profile. Its capacity to 
establish robust hydrogen bonds without compromising cellular integrity supports 
its potential application in anti-aging and cancer prevention strategies. Recent 
studies have clarified ectoine's function in alleviating oxidative stress caused 
by environmental pollutants and ultraviolet radiation, broadening its advantages 
for skin and ecological health. The review details ectoine's mechanisms of 
action, which include the protection of cellular macromolecules, modulation of 
inflammation, and prevention of apoptosis, while also highlighting emerging 
research that positions ectoine as a promising postbiotic candidate for 
therapeutic strategies in neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, 
autoimmune conditions, and metabolic syndromes. Additionally, the review 
addresses challenges such as the low bioavailability of ectoine in eukaryotic 
cells, the constraints on scalability for industrial production, and the high 
costs associated with synthetic biology methods. Future prospects for ectoine as 
a postbiotic therapeutic option are also discussed, including the potential for 
advanced delivery systems, such as ectoine-loaded nanoparticles and hydrogels, 
to improve stability and bioavailability, as well as synergistic combinations 
with phytochemicals like resveratrol and curcumin to enhance therapeutic 
efficacy. Integrating artificial intelligence into ectoine research 
revolutionizes understanding its therapeutic properties, streamlining drug 
formulation and clinical applications. By synthesizing insights into ectoine's 
molecular mechanisms and investigating new therapeutic pathways, this review 
advocates for advancing ectoine as a natural postbiotic therapeutic agent, 
addressing contemporary health challenges while meeting the growing demand for 
safer alternatives.

Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) disproportionately impact 
Latinos in the US. Interventions that promote engagement in established 
protective behaviors throughout the life course may offer an opportunity to 
address disparities. To inform brain health promotion efforts, this study aimed 
to examine current brain health-related attitudes, awareness, and actions of 
middle-aged Latinos. A cross-sectional, online survey was completed by 200 
Latinos 35-64 years old. Survey items assessed concern about ADRD, beliefs 
related to ways to support brain health, knowledge of protective behaviors, and 
actual engagement in protective behaviors. Multivariable analyses examined 
differences in knowledge, attitudinal, and behavioral outcomes by 
sociodemographic and psychosocial factors including health literacy and health 
activation. A third (36.0%) of participants were "very concerned" about ADRD. 
Nearly two thirds (61.0%) "strongly agreed" steps can be taken to reduce risk of 
ADRD. Less than a third (29.5%) were able to name three steps to support brain 
health, and 45.5% reported currently engaging in behaviors to support brain 
health. In multivariable analyses, participants with lower acculturation were 
more likely to be "very concerned" about ADRD and to "strongly agree" that steps 
can be taken to support brain health. Participants with low health activation 
were less likely to agree that steps can be taken. Those who were older and had 
a family member with ADRD were more likely to be able to name three steps that 
can be taken. Most middle-aged Latinos believed brain health is actionable, 
while concern for ADRD, awareness of ways to protect the brain, and engagement 
in science-based protective behaviors was variable. Opportunities exist for 
increasing education about well-established modifiable risk factors for ADRD, 
yet more research is needed to understand these factors in historically 
minoritized communities.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a widespread condition that affects adults and the 
community considerably. The causes are yet unknown, except from advanced age and 
genetic predisposition. Natural products provided advantageous advantages for 
managing AD due to their efficacy, safety, and accessibility. The memory 
boosting effects of chemically characterized Ipomoea carnea ethanol extract 
(IPC-EtOH) on behavioral, biochemical, histological, and molecular levels 
against cognitive impairment induced by AlCl3 exposure in rats were assessed 
using donepezil as a reference drug. Behavioral tests (spontaneous alternation 
T-maze and open field test) and assays for GSK3β, CREB, FOXO1a, β-secretase, 
tau, oxidative stress biomarkers, histopathology, and immunohistochemistry for 
cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) were conducted. The chemical profiling of IPC-EtOH 
using UPLC-ESI-qTOF-MS coupled with molecular networking revealed the 
identification of 83 bioactive metabolites, including pyrrolizidine alkaloids 
and cinnamic acid derivatives which previously undescribed from this species. 
AlCl3 injection significantly elevated tau, β-secretase, GSSG, GSK-3β, and 
FOXO3a levels and down regulated CAT, SOD, and CREB, with strong COX-2 
immunoexpression in the cortex and hippocampus compared to controls. Oral 
co-administration of donepezil or IPC-EtOH to AlCl3-treated rats restored 
near-normal function in these brain regions, significantly attenuating spatial 
learning, memory, and locomotor impairments. These results suggest that IPC-EtOH 
could be a promising therapy for mitigating aluminum-induced neurotoxicity, 
though further studies are needed to elucidate its precise mechanisms of action. 
These outcomes emphasize I. carnea ethanol extract's potential as an appealing 
therapy for AD by demonstrating its neuroprotective and memory-enhancing 
properties in rats having AlCl3-induced memory impairment.

"It's almost like not existing": Adult children's experiences of not being 
recognized and their perceptions of being forgotten by their parents with 
dementia.

Parents living with dementia sometimes do not recognize their adult child 
caregivers, who may then perceive they are forgotten. Yet, research on the 
experience of being unrecognized and perceived as forgotten by a parent with 
dementia is scarce. Object relations theory suggests healthy development of a 
child's sense of self during early development is linked to being held in mind 
by a primary caretaker. Thus, it is unclear how being unrecognized and perceived 
as forgotten by parents living with dementia impacts adult children's 
identities. To investigate this phenomenon, this qualitative study explored 
adult child caregivers' experiences of not being recognized in the context of a 
parent's dementia. The aims were to (1) develop an in-depth understanding of 
what it means for adult children to perceive they were unrecognized and/or 
forgotten by their parents with dementia and (2) gain insight on the effects of 
being unrecognized and perceived as forgotten on adult children's identities. 
Twelve adult child caregivers of mothers with dementia due to a 
neurodegenerative disease were recruited through purposive sampling. 
Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis was conducted to analyze data collected 
via semi-structured in-depth interviews. Findings revealed participants 
experienced intense emotional pain from perceptions of being forgotten resulting 
in injuries to their identity and sense of self. Four superordinate themes were 
identified: Attribution, Relationship, Emotional Landscape, and Reactions, 
overarching ten emergent themes. Overall, this study underscores the relational 
interdependence of shared memories between parents and children in shaping 
children's self-perceptions, sense of personal history, and felt connection with 
parents living with dementia. Psychotherapeutic interventions grounded in 
cognitive behavioral therapy, object relations theory, and distributed cognition 
are recommended to enhance caregiver support. Helping adult children navigate 
ambiguity and embrace the possibility that they are not forgotten, but 
remembered differently, by their parents living with dementia may offer 
significant emotional relief and foster resilience.

Neurodegenerative diseases encompass a number of very heterogeneous disorders, 
primarily characterized by neuronal loss and a concomitant decline in 
neurological function. Examples of this type of clinical condition are 
Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, Huntington's Disease and Amyotrophic 
Lateral Sclerosis. Age has been identified as a major risk in the etiology of 
these disorders, which explains their increased incidence in developed 
countries. Unfortunately, despite continued and intensive efforts, no cure has 
yet been found for any of these diseases; reliable markers that allow for an 
early diagnosis of the disease and the identification of key molecular events 
leading to disease onset and progression are lacking. Altered adult neurogenesis 
appears to precede the appearance of severe symptoms. Given the scarcity of 
human samples and the considerable differences with model species, increasingly 
complex human stem-cell-based models are being developed. These are shedding 
light on the molecular alterations that contribute to disease development, 
facilitating the identification of new clinical targets and providing a 
screening platform for the testing of candidate drugs. Moreover, the secretome 
and other promising features of these cell types are being explored, to use them 
as replacement cells of high plasticity or as co-adjuvant therapy in 
combinatorial treatments.

Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are specialized extracellular matrix structures that 
predominantly surround inhibitory neurons in the central nervous system (CNS). 
They have been identified as crucial regulators of synaptic plasticity and 
neuronal excitability. This literature review aims to summarize the current 
state of knowledge about PNNs, their molecular composition and structure, as 
well as their functional roles and involvement in neurological diseases. 
Furthermore, future directions in PNN research are proposed, and the therapeutic 
potential of targeting PNNs to develop novel treatment options for various 
neurological disorders is explored. This review emphasizes the importance of 
PNNs in CNS physiology and pathology and underscores the need for further 
research in this area.

Arbor, Michigan.

Theories of pain have been developed in several patient populations, but none 
currently exist for heart failure (HF) that include contributing factors and 
associated outcomes. We developed a situation-specific theory of pain in HF by 
adapting the biopsychosocial model of pain. Existing theoretical and empirical 
literature in HF samples was utilized to construct the new theory. Components, 
contributing factors, and associated outcomes of pain in HF are presented in the 
new theory. Areas in need of additional research are emphasized, and strengths 
and limitations are discussed. This theory could provide a foundation for future 
pain research initiatives in HF. Key words : pain, heart failure, theoretical 
model.

Therapeutics for Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease in Unani Medicine.

Mehnaz D, Shamsi Y, Akhtar MW, Rahman Y.

Alzheimer's disease refers to a neurological disorder marked by memory loss and 
cognitive dysfunction caused by the death of brain cells. It is a progressive, 
devitalizing disease of aging that has skyrocketed in recent years. The disease 
progresses gradually, with symptoms including forgetfulness, difficulty with 
language or communication, disorientation, mood swings, and changes in 
behaviour. Unani medicine, being an older system of medicine, does not mention 
Alzheimer's disease as such since the name was coined only in 1907 AD. The Unani 
medical literature has, however, described the existence of Nisyān with signs 
and symptoms similar to those of Alzheimer's disease. The renowned Unani 
scholars have not only mentioned the aetiology and pathogenesis of Nisyān but 
also designed a specific line of treatment. This study attempts to present the 
pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease and Nisyān, along with an exploration of 
potential treatment options available in Unani medicine.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe neurodegenerative disease characterized 
mainly by the formation of amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques and abnormal 
phosphorylation of tau. In recent years, an imbalance in iron homeostasis has 
been recognized to play a key role in the pathological process of AD. Abnormal 
iron accumulation can activate various kinases such as glycogen synthase 
kinase-3β, cyclin-dependent kinase 5, and mitogen-activated protein kinase, 
leading to abnormal phosphorylation of tau and amyloid precursor protein, and 
accelerating the formation of Aβ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. In 
addition, iron-mediated oxidative stress not only triggers neuronal damage, but 
also exacerbates neuronal dysfunction by altering the phosphorylation of 
N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors. Iron 
accumulation also affects the phosphorylation status of tyrosine hydroxylase, 
the rate-limiting enzyme for dopamine synthesis, interfering with the dopamine 
signaling pathway. On the other hand, iron affects iron transport and metabolism 
in the brain by regulating the phosphorylation of transferrin, further 
disrupting iron homeostasis. Therapeutic strategies targeting iron metabolism 
show promise by reducing iron accumulation, inhibiting oxidative stress, and 
reducing abnormal phosphorylation of key proteins. This article reviews the 
molecular mechanisms of phosphorylation modifications mediated by iron 
homeostasis imbalance in AD, and discusses the potential of interventions that 
regulate iron metabolism and related signaling pathways, providing a new 
theoretical basis for the treatment of AD.

Identification of early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a challenge due 
to limited specialist availability, diagnostic access, disease awareness, and 
cultural factors. Blood-based biomarkers (BBBM) could play a critical role in 
the identification and referral of patients suspected of AD to specialty care. A 
multidisciplinary AD Biomarker Task Force was convened to evaluate current 
biomarker use cases, define an optimal biomarker-enabled AD diagnostic care 
pathway, and understand factors impacting adoption. The Task Force identified 
opportunities to support biomarker-enabled AD diagnostic care pathway adoption, 
including streamlining risk assessment and screening by leveraging digital 
tools, activating primary care providers through education, generating data to 
expand applicability to diverse populations, and advocating for aligned policies 
and quality measures. Adoption of BBBMs in the primary care setting will be 
critical to improve early AD detection. However, challenges to pathway adoption 
persist and will require action from clinicians, payers, policy makers, and 
patients to address.
HIGHLIGHTS: Blood-based biomarkers can streamline the identification of AD in 
primary care.Future biomarker-enabled diagnostic care pathways will leverage 
digital assessments.Education, data generation, and policy advocacy are vital to 
encourage BBBM use.Implementation of AD care pathways requires the activation of 
diverse stakeholders.

BACKGROUND: High-definition-tDCS (HD-tDCS) is a recent technology that allows 
for localized cortical stimulation, but has not yet been investigated as an 
augmentative therapy while targeting the left temporoparietal cortex in 
logopenic variant PPA (lvPPA). The changes in neuronal oscillatory patterns and 
resting-state functional connectivity in response to HD-tDCS also remains poorly 
understood.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate the effects of HD-tDCS with phonologic-based 
language training on language, cognition, and resting-state functional 
connectivity in lvPPA.
METHODS: We used a double-blind, within-subject, sham-controlled crossover 
design with a 4-month between-treatment period in four participants with lvPPA. 
Participants completed language, cognitive assessments, and imaging with 
magnetoencephalography (MEG) and resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) prior to 
treatment with either anodal HD-tDCS or sham targeting the left supramarginal 
gyrus over 10 sessions. Language and cognitive assessments, MEG, and fMRI were 
repeated after the final session and at 2 months follow-up. Preliminary data on 
efficacy was evaluated based on relative changes from baseline in language and 
cognitive scores. Language measures included metrics derived from spontaneous 
speech from picture description. Changes in resting-state functional 
connectivity within the phonological network were analyzed using fMRI. 
Magnitudes of source-level evoked responses and hemispheric laterality indices 
from language task-based MEG were used to assess changes in cortical engagement 
induced by HD-tDCS.
RESULTS: All four participants were retained across the 4-month 
between-treatment period, with satisfactory blinding of participants and 
investigators throughout the study. Anodal HD-tDCS was well tolerated with a 
side effect profile that did not extend past the immediate treatment period. No 
benefit of HD-tDCS over sham on language and cognitive measures was observed in 
this small sample. Functional imaging results using MEG and fMRI indicated an 
excitatory effect of anodal HD-tDCS compared to sham and suggested that greater 
temporoparietal activation and connectivity was positively associated with 
language outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Anodal HD-tDCS to the inferior parietal cortex combined with 
language training appears feasible and well tolerated in participants with 
lvPPA. Language outcomes may be explained by regression to the mean, and to a 
lesser degree, by ceiling effects and differences in baseline disease severity. 
The intervention has apparent temporoparietal correlates, and its clinical 
efficacy should be further studied in larger trials.

Advancing personalized digital therapeutics: integrating music therapy, 
brainwave entrainment methods, and AI-driven biofeedback.

London, United Kingdom.

Mental health disorders and cognitive decline are pressing global concerns, 
increasing the demand for non-pharmacological interventions targeting emotional 
dysregulation, memory deficits, and neural dysfunction. This review 
systematically examines three promising methodologies-music therapy, brainwave 
entrainment (binaural beats, isochronic tones, multisensory stimulation), and 
their integration into a unified therapeutic paradigm. Emerging evidence 
indicates that music therapy modulates affect, reduces stress, and enhances 
cognition by engaging limbic, prefrontal, and reward circuits. Brainwave 
entrainment, particularly within the gamma frequency range (30-100 Hz), 
facilitates neural oscillatory patterns linked to relaxation, concentration, and 
memory, with 40 Hz showing promise for cognitive enhancement, albeit with 
individual variability. Synchronized multisensory stimulation, combining 
auditory and visual inputs at gamma frequencies, has demonstrated potential in 
enhancing memory and supporting neural integrity, particularly in Alzheimer's 
disease. However, challenges such as patient response variability, lack of 
standardization, and scalability hinder widespread implementation. Recent 
research suggests that a synergistic application of these modalities may 
optimize therapeutic outcomes by leveraging complementary mechanisms. To 
actualize this, AI-driven biofeedback, enabling real-time physiological 
assessment and individualized adjustments-such as tailoring musical complexity, 
entrainment frequencies, and multisensory components-emerges as a promising 
solution. This adaptive model enhances treatment accessibility and consistency 
while maximizing long-term efficacy. Although in early stages, preliminary 
evidence highlights its transformative potential in reshaping 
non-pharmacological therapeutic strategies. Advancing this field requires 
interdisciplinary research, rigorous evaluation, and ethical data stewardship to 
develop innovative, patient-centered solutions for mental health and cognitive 
rehabilitation.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is the 
leading cause of dementia, affecting nearly 55 million people across the world. 
One of the central pathological factors associated with AD is the aggregation of 
Aβ42, a peptide product cleaved through pathological processes in AD. Under 
pathological conditions, Aβ42 aggregates into insoluble plaques in the brain and 
impairs the function of neurons, which contributes to the cognitive decline 
associated with AD. Therefore, the modulation of Aβ42 aggregation is considered 
a potential therapeutic intervention for AD. Using an Oligoquinoline-based 
foldamer library, we have identified a potent foldamer antagonist (SK-131) of 
Aβ42 aggregation. SK-131 inhibits the aggregation by inducing a α-helical 
structure in monomeric Aβ42. Here, we demonstrated that SK-131 rescues Aβ42 
aggregation-associated phenotypes in AD cellular and multiple Caenorhabditis 
elegans AD models, including intracellular inhibition of Aβ42 aggregation, 
rescue of behavioral deficits, and attenuation of reactive oxygen species. It 
efficiently crosses the blood-brain barrier and demonstrates favorable 
pharmaceutical properties. It also potently inhibits Zn2+-mediated Aβ42 
aggregation by potentially displacing Zn2+ from Aβ42. In summary, we have 
identified a potent brain-penetrating foldamer that efficiently rescues AD 
phenotypes in in vivo models. Unlike most of the therapeutic approaches that 
target Aβ aggregates, we have identified and validated a novel therapeutic 
pathway by inducing structural change in Aβ and rescuing AD phenotypes in in 
vivo models. This study will further aid in the quest to identify lead 
therapeutics to slow or stop the progression of AD.

BACKGROUND: Nicotinamide, a form of B3 vitamin, is an NAD+ precursor that 
reduces pTau231 levels via histone deacetylase inhibition in murine models of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). A recent phase 2a randomized placebo-controlled trial 
tested high-dose oral nicotinamide for the treatment of early AD. While 
nicotinamide demonstrated good safety and tolerability, it did not significantly 
lower CSF pTau231, the primary biomarker endpoint of the study. Characterization 
of nicotinamide's pharmacokinetics and metabolites in the blood and CSF is 
needed.
METHODS: In these post hoc, blinded analyses of plasma and CSF samples from the 
completed two-site placebo controlled randomized trial testing of 1500 mg PO BID 
oral nicotinamide, we used mass spectroscopy to measure nicotinamide and its 
inactive metabolite 1-methyl-nicotinamide in plasma at baseline, 6, and 
12 months and in CSF at baseline and 12 months from 23 participants on drug and 
24 on placebo.
RESULTS: Pharmacokinetic analysis found mean 12 month plasma nicotinamide 
increased > 130-fold to 52 μM while mean methyl-nicotinamide 
increased > 600-fold to 91 μM in individuals receiving nicotinamide compared to 
those receiving placebo, whose levels were unchanged from baseline. However, CSF 
nicotinamide was only measurable in 6 of the 19 available participants (32%) 
(mean increase of at least 147-fold to 18 μM). These CSF nicotinamide 
concentrations were 66% of their plasma levels, indicating good CNS 
bioavailability in only some participants. In contrast to CSF nicotinamide, more 
treated participants had higher CSF methyl-nicotinamide (n = 9, 43 μM), 
suggesting high-dosage nicotinamide was sufficient to pass the blood-brain 
barrier, but 13 of 19 were metabolically inactivated. Treatment favorably 
decreased mean pTau231 levels by 34% in those six participants with elevated CSF 
levels of nicotinamide, compared to 3% elevation in participants who did not 
have elevated CSF nicotinamide, and a 3% decrease for placebo. No such 
relationships were observed for total tau, pTau181, or amyloid beta biomarkers.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that oral administration markedly increased 
mean plasma nicotinamide levels, however CSF levels were below quantitation in a 
majority of participants and there was extensive metabolic inactivation to 
methyl-nicotinamide. Both the bioavailability and rapid metabolic methylation 
need to be addressed if nicotinamide is further developed as a potential 
intervention for AD.

BACKGROUND: Recent studies highlight the critical role of microglia in 
neurodegenerative disorders, and emphasize the need for humanized models to 
accurately study microglial responses. Human-mouse microglia xenotransplantation 
models are a valuable platform for functional studies and for testing 
therapeutic approaches, yet currently those models are only available for 
academic research. This hampers their implementation for the development and 
testing of medication that targets human microglia.
METHODS: We developed the hCSF1Bdes mouse line, which is suitable as a new 
transplantation model and available to be crossed to any disease model of 
interest. The hCSF1Bdes model created by CRISPR gene editing is RAG2 deficient 
and expresses human CSF1. Additionally, we crossed this model with two humanized 
App KI mice, the AppHu and the AppSAA. Flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry and 
bulk sequencing was used to study the response of microglia in the context of 
Alzheimer's disease.
RESULTS: Our results demonstrate the successful transplantation of iPSC-derived 
human microglia into the brains of hCSF1Bdes mice without triggering a NK-driven 
immune response. Furthermore, we confirmed the multipronged response of 
microglia in the context of Alzheimer's disease. The hCSF1Bdes and the crosses 
with the Alzheimer's disease knock-in model AppSAA and the humanized App 
knock-in control mice, AppHu are deposited with EMMA and fully accessible to the 
research community.
CONCLUSION: The hCSF1Bdes mouse is available for both non-profit and for-profit 
organisations, facilitating the use of the xenotransplantation paradigm for 
human microglia to study complex human disease.

The IL-20 cytokine family, comprising IL-19, IL-20, IL-22, IL-24, and IL-26, has 
emerged as a critical player in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases 
due to its multiple roles in inflammation, tissue repair, and immune modulation. 
These cytokines signal through IL-20 receptor complexes (IL-20RA/IL-20RB and 
IL-22RA1/IL-20RB), triggering diverse immune processes. Recent evidence 
highlights their significant contributions to neuroinflammation and 
neurodegeneration in central nervous system disorders. IL-20 family cytokines 
impact microglial activation, which, when dysregulated, exacerbates neuronal 
damage. Specifically, IL-20 and IL-24 are linked to elevated pro-inflammatory 
markers in glial cells, promoting neurodegeneration. In contrast, IL-22 exhibits 
dual functionality, exerting protective and pathological roles depending on the 
inflammatory milieu. Key mechanisms involve the regulation of blood-brain 
barrier integrity, oxidative stress, and autophagy. IL-22 and IL-24 also protect 
neurons by enhancing antioxidant defenses and maintaining epithelial barrier 
function, while their dysregulation contributes to blood-brain barrier 
disruption and protein aggregate accumulation, hallmark features of Alzheimer's 
disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis. Elevated IL-22 levels in 
Alzheimer's disease and IL-19's regulatory role in multiple sclerosis suggest 
they may serve as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. IL-26's role in 
amplifying inflammatory cascades further underscores the complexity of this 
cytokine family in neurodegenerative pathology. Therapeutically, strategies 
targeting IL-20 cytokines include monoclonal antibodies, receptor modulation, 
and recombinant cytokine administration. These approaches aim to mitigate 
neuroinflammation, restore immune balance, and protect neuronal integrity. This 
review underscores the IL-20 family's emerging relevance in neurodegenerative 
diseases, highlighting its potential for novel diagnostic and therapeutic 
strategies.

Aggregation of the tau protein into cross-β amyloid fibrils is a hallmark of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and many other neurodegenerative disorders. Developing 
small molecules that bind these tau fibrils is important for the diagnosis and 
treatment of tauopathies. Here, we report the binding sites of a positron 
emission tomography (PET) ligand, PI-2620, to a recombinant tau construct that 
adopts the C-shaped AD fold. Using solid-state NMR 13C-19F rotational-echo 
double-resonance (REDOR) experiments, we measured the proximity of protein 
residues to the fluorine atom of the ligand. These data indicate that PI-2620 
binds at two main locations in the concave interior of the C-shaped structure. 
Molecular docking simulations constrained by these REDOR data identified five 
binding poses at these two locations. In addition, 2D 13C-13C correlation NMR 
spectra indicate that PI-2620 decreased the intensities of residues at the 
protofilament interfaces, indicating that the ligand disordered the filament 
packing. Quantitative analysis of the 19F NMR spectra indicates that PI-2620 
binds these AD-fold tau fibrils with a stoichiometry of ∼20 mol %, in which 10 
mol % are immobilized and the rest are mobile. These results provide 
experimental constraints to the interaction of this second-generation PET tracer 
with tau fibrils adopting the AD fold and should be useful for the development 
of future imaging agents with improved stoichiometry and specificity for AD tau.

IMPORTANCE: Bioenergetic failure has been proposed as a driver of amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis (ALS). CNM-Au8 is a suspension of gold nanocrystals that 
catalyzes the conversion of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydride into NAD+, 
resulting in an increase of cellular adenosine triphosphate production.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of CNM-Au8 on ALS disease progression.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: CNM-Au8 was tested as a regimen of the HEALEY 
ALS Platform Trial, a phase 2/3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind platform 
trial. The study was conducted at 54 sites in the US from July 2020 to March 
2022 (final follow-up, March 17, 2022). A total of 161 participants with ALS 
were randomized to receive CNM-Au8 (n = 120) or regimen-specific placebo 
(n = 41). Data from 123 concurrently randomized placebo participants in other 
regimens were combined for analyses.
INTERVENTIONS: Eligible participants were randomized in a 3:3:2 ratio to receive 
CNM-Au8 60 mg daily (n = 61), CNM-Au8 30 mg daily (n = 59), or matching placebo 
(n = 41) for 24 weeks.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary efficacy outcome was change from 
baseline through week 24 in ALS disease severity measured by a bayesian shared 
parameter model of function (based on the Revised Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis 
Functional Rating Scale) and survival, which provided an estimate of the rate of 
disease progression measured by the disease rate ratio (DRR), with a DRR of less 
than 1 indicating treatment benefit. Secondary end points included a Combined 
Assessment of Function and Survival using a joint-rank test, rate of decline in 
slow vital capacity (percent predicted), and survival free of permanent assisted 
ventilation.
RESULTS: Among 161 participants who were randomized within the CNM-Au8 regimen 
(mean age, 58.4 years; 61 [37.9%] female), 145 (90%) completed the trial. In the 
primary analysis comparing the combined CNM-Au8 dosage groups vs the combined 
placebo groups, the primary end point (DRR, 0.97 [95% credible interval, 
0.783-1.175]; posterior probability of DRR <1, 0.65) and the 3 secondary end 
points suggested no benefit or harm of CNM-Au8. In the active (n = 120) vs 
placebo (n = 163) groups, the most common adverse events were diarrhea (23 [19%] 
vs 12 [7%]), nausea (17 [14.2%] vs 14 [8.6%]), fatigue (12 [10.8%] vs 30 
[18.4%]), and muscular weakness (24 [20%] vs 45 [27.6%]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: No benefit of CNM-Au8 on ALS disease progression was 
observed at 24 weeks.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate neurophysiological correlates of 
subjective cognitive decline (SCD) among midlife women at risk for Alzheimer's 
disease (AD).
METHODS: We examined 156 cognitively normal perimenopausal and postmenopausal 
women aged 40 to 65 years, with an AD family history and/or apolipoprotein E 
epsilon 4 genotype, who were not on menopause hormone therapy. Participants 
underwent neuropsychological testing, health and menopausal symptom 
questionnaires, and brain volumetric magnetic resonance imaging, arterial spin 
labeling-magnetic resonance (MR) measuring cerebral blood flow, and 31 
phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 31 P-MRS) measuring mitochondria 
high-energy phosphates (adenosine triphosphate [ATP], phosphocreatine [PCr], 
inorganic phosphate [Pi]). We used multivariable regressions to compare outcomes 
between participants with and without SCD and to identify the main correlates of 
SCD status.
RESULTS: The SCD group (n = 53) exhibited worse verbal memory and executive 
function test performance (multivariable adjusted P  = 0.029) compared to 
controls (n = 103). On brain imaging, the SCD group showed higher PCr/ATP in 
precuneus, posterior cingulate, and parietal regions compared to controls 
(multivariable adjusted P  < 0.05) and no overall differences in Pi/ATP, PCr/Pi, 
volume, or cerebral blood flow measures. Results were controlled for age, race, 
smoking status, hysterectomy status, presence of vasomotor symptoms, menopause 
symptom severity score, past menopause hormone therapy usage, history of 
depression, AD family history, and apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 status. The 
factors more strongly associated with SCD status were inferior parietal PCr/ATP, 
menopause symptom severity, and presence of vasomotor symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: Among perimenopausal and postmenopausal midlife women, SCD was 
associated with altered brain mitochondria bioenergetics in some brain regions 
similarly affected by AD, warranting further investigation.

IMPORTANCE: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal disease. The sigma-1 
(σ1) receptor emerged as a target for intervention.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of pridopidine, a σ1-receptor agonist, in 
ALS.
DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS: Pridopidine was tested as a regimen of the 
HEALEY ALS Platform Trial, a phase 2/3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 
platform trial. The study was conducted at 54 sites in the US from January 2021 
to July 2022 (final follow-up, July 14, 2022). A total of 163 participants with 
ALS were randomized to receive pridopidine or placebo. An additional 122 
concurrently randomized participants were assigned to receive placebo in other 
regimens and included in the analyses.
INTERVENTIONS: Eligible participants were randomized 3:1 to receive oral 
pridopidine 45 mg twice daily (n = 121) or matching oral placebo (n = 42) for a 
planned duration of 24 weeks.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary efficacy outcome was change from 
baseline through week 24 in ALS disease severity, analyzed using a bayesian 
shared parameter model, which has components for function (Revised Amyotrophic 
Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale [ALSFRS-R]) and survival that were 
linked through an integrated estimate of treatment-dependent disease slowing 
across these 2 components. This was denoted as the disease rate ratio (DRR), 
with DRR less than 1 indicating a slowing in disease progression on pridopidine 
relative to placebo. There were 5 key secondary end points: time to 2-point or 
greater reduction in ALSFRS-R total score among participants with bulbar 
dysfunction at baseline, rate of decline in slow vital capacity among 
participants with bulbar dysfunction at baseline, percentage of participants 
with no worsening in the ALSFRS-R bulbar domain score, time to 1-point or 
greater change in the ALSFRS-R bulbar domain score, and time to death or 
permanent assisted ventilation.
RESULTS: Among 162 patients (mean age, 57.5 years; 35% female) who were 
randomized to receive the pridopidine regimen and included in the primary 
efficacy analysis, 136 (84%) completed the trial. In the primary analysis 
comparing pridopidine vs the combined placebo groups, there was no significant 
difference between pridopidine and placebo in the primary end point (DRR, 0.99 
[95% credible interval, 0.80-1.21]; probability of DRR <1, 0.55) and no 
differences were seen in the components of ALSFRS-R or survival. There was no 
benefit of pridopidine on the secondary end points. In the safety dataset 
(pridopidine, n = 121; placebo, n = 163), the most common adverse events were 
falls (28.1% vs 29.3%, respectively) and muscular weakness (24.0% vs 31.7%, 
respectively).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this 24-week study, pridopidine did not impact the 
progression of ALS.

The limitations of current Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapies necessitate novel 
treatment approaches. Elaeocarpus angustifolius Blume, a plant traditionally 
used in India for neurological disorders, was investigated for its therapeutic 
potential in AD. E. angustifolius alkaloid-rich fraction (EAF) was analysed 
using LCMS and GCMS, identifying 66 phytochemicals. Compounds were evaluated 
using Schrodinger software against key AD targets obtained from Protein Data 
Bank (PDB), including recombinant human acetylcholinesterase (PDB ID: 4EY7), 
β-secretase (PDB ID: 6C2I), TNF-α converting enzyme (PDB ID: 2FV5), glycogen 
synthase kinase 3 (PDB ID: 1Q5K), and amyloid-β precursor protein (PDB ID: 
1AAP). Among the identified compounds, (+)-Elaeocarpine, Genistein, Caffeic 
acid, Avenalumic acid, Verimol A, Apigenin 7-glucoside, and 
(1xi,3xi)-1,2,3,4-Tetrahydro-1-methyl-β-carboline-3-carboxylic acid exhibited 
the highest binding affinities. ADMET analysis confirmed favourable profiles for 
these phytochemicals. The study suggests that these compounds present in EAF 
could be promising candidates for developing novel AD therapies.

The disease course and outcome of COVID-19 greatly varies between individuals. 
To explore which biological systems may contribute to this variation, we 
examined how individual metabolites and three metabolic scores relate to 
COVID-19 outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The metabolome of 346 
patients was measured using the 1H-NMR Nightingale platform. The association of 
individual metabolomic features and multi-biomarker scores, i.e. MetaboHealth, 
MetaboAge, and Infectious Disease Score (IDS) (higher scores reflect poorer 
health), with in-hospital disease course, long-term recovery, and overall 
survival were analyzed. Higher values for the metabolites phenylalanine 
(HR = 1.33, CI = 1.14-1.56), glucose (HR = 1.37, CI = 1.16-1.62) and lactate 
(HR = 1.38, CI = 1.16-1.63) were associated with mortality. For all three 
metabolic scores, higher scores were significantly associated with higher odds 
of a poorer in-hospital disease course (MetaboHealth: OR = 1.61, CI = 1.29-2.02; 
ΔMetaboAge: OR = 1.42, CI = 1.16-1.74; IDS: OR = 1.55, 1.25-1.93) and with 
overall survival (MetaboHealth: HR = 1.57, CI = 1.28-1.92; ΔMetaboAge: 
HR = 1.34, CI = 1.15-1.57; IDS: HR = 1.56, CI = 1.27-1.93). MetaboHealth and 
ΔMetaboAge showed a stronger association in younger patients (< 70 yrs.) than 
older patients. No clear patterns were found in associations between the three 
scores and measures of long-term recovery. In conclusion, the heterogeneity in 
disease course after SARS-COV2 infection may be explained either by generic 
biological frailty reflected by the three metabolomics scores or by glycemic 
control (glucose, lactate) and respiratory distress (phenylalanine).

BACKGROUND: Carers play an important role in providing practical and emotional 
support to people with dementia. There is a need to ensure carers are supported 
in this role to maximise their ability to provide care while maintaining their 
own wellbeing. This study aimed to develop a psychometrically rigorous 
self-report instrument to assess the unmet needs of carers of people with 
dementia.
METHODS: The Unmet Needs Instrument for Carers of People with Dementia (UNI-C) 
was developed using a multi-methods approach including a comprehensive 
literature review, in-depth interviews and focus groups, expert opinion, 
cognitive interviews and pilot testing. A cross-sectional survey of 169 carers 
was used to examine the psychometric characteristics of the instrument. 
Specifically, internal reliability, and structural and convergent validity were 
assessed and the number of items reduced.
RESULTS: The original 80 item instrument was reduced to 46 items across four 
domains based on prevalence, item-total and pairwise correlations, factor 
loadings and clinical relevance. The resulting instrument, named the UNI-C46, 
showed acceptable evidence of structural and convergent validity, and good 
internal reliability (α = 0.94) and acceptability. The four domains measure 
'Your own wellbeing' (16 items), 'Finding information' (12 items), 'Managing 
practical needs' (10 items), and 'Managing dementia symptoms' (8 items).
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first demonstration of reliability and 
validity of the UNI-C46. Further testing of these properties with a larger and 
more representative sample of carers is recommended.

Publisher: Carers play an important and ongoing role in supporting those with 
dementia living in the community. While caring can be rewarding, carers can also 
experience significant burden due to the caring role. Improving support for 
carers of people with dementia is a public health priority. Unmet needs 
assessment offers a practical approach to identifying areas in which carers 
require more support. We developed the Unmet Needs Instrument for Carers of 
People with Dementia (UNI-C) using a rigorous and accepted measure development 
process including literature reviews, expert opinion, interviews and focus 
groups with carers, pilot testing and psychometric evaluation. The final 
instrument measures carers unmet needs across four domains: Your own wellbeing, 
finding information, managing practical needs and managing dementia symptoms. 
The self-report instrument is suitable for use in clinical and research 
settings.

Linalool (LIN) has some important neuropharmacological activities, including 
anxiolytic and sedative effects. It is also clear that it protects experimental 
animals from convulsions and Alzheimer's disease. On the other hand, caffeine 
(CAF) and sclareol (SCL) have neurostimulatory potential. This study evaluates 
the sedative effect and possible molecular mechanisms of CAF with LIN and/or SCL 
through in vivo and in silico studies. For this, CAF (10 mg/kg) alone or with 
LIN (50 mg/kg) and/or SCL (10 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally (i.p.) treated before 
thirty minutes of thiopental sodium (TS) injection (40 mg/kg, i.p.) to the mice 
and observed for latency and duration of sleep up to 4 h. To understand the 
possible action mechanisms of these drugs, we also performed molecular docking 
and pharmacokinetics profile studies with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) 
receptor respective subunits. Findings suggest that LIN exerted significant 
(p < 0.05) sedative effects on the animals. CAF and SCL alone or in their 
combinations significantly reduced LIN's effects in mice. CAF, LIN, and SCL 
showed binding affinities of ‒6.2, ‒5.5, and ‒7.3 kcal/mol with 6X3X of the 
GABAA receptor (α1 and β2 subunits), respectively. Taken together, LIN exerted 
significant sedative effects, whereas CAF and SCL, either alone or in 
combination, attenuated this effect in mice. These findings suggest that LIN, 
CAF, and SCL modulate sedation through interactions with the GABAA receptor 
pathway. Further clinical studies are required to confirm these results.

Objectives: epidemiological data show growing numbers of patients with 
Alzheimer´s disease. Cognitive decline and progressive swallowing impairment 
lead to a significant deterioration of the nutrition status in this population. 
Early detection and treatment of malnutrition is important for the prognosis of 
the disease. Method: a systematic review was conducted. Four databases such as 
Cochrane, PubMed, Embase and Web of Science were searched by two independent 
researchers. The inclusion criteria encompass adult patients with diagnosed 
Alzheimer's disease, studies with screening tools for nutritional assessment 
such as Mini-Nutritional Assessment and body mass index. Patients without 
diagnosis or with possible or probable Alzheimer's disease were excluded. 
Finally, 36 studies with 5293 participants were included to the systematic 
review. PRISMA protocol was followed when writing this article. Critical 
Appraisal tools for use in JBI Systematic Reviews were used for quality 
assessment. Results: 36 studies were included in this systematic review. More 
than half of the respondents were from Europe. According to MNA 33.97 % of 
participants were at risk of malnutrition, 3.74 % malnourished and more than 62 
% had proper nutritional status. According to the BMI, nearly 50 % of patients 
were overweight or obese, 4.22 % had BMI < BMI < 18,49 kg/m2. Risk of 
malnutrition and malnutrition was diagnosed in 53.8 % and 8.2 % of patients 
assessed with Mini-Nutritional Assessment - Short Form. Conclusion: the risk of 
malnutrition in AD is high, however, significant differences between studies can 
be observed due to methodological differences. Large epidemiological studies are 
needed with unified nutritional assessment methods for patients with Alzheimer's 
disease.

el 33,97 % de los participantes estaban en riesgo de desnutrición, el 3,74 % 
estaban desnutridos y más del 62 % tenían un estado nutricional adecuado. Según 
el IMC, casi el 50 % de los pacientes tenían sobrepeso u obesidad, mientras que 
el 4,22 % tenían un IMC inferior a 18,49 kg/m². Se diagnosticó riesgo de 
desnutrición y desnutrición en el 53,8 % y el 8,2 % de los pacientes evaluados 
con la Mini-Nutritional Assessment - short form. Conclusión: el riesgo de 
desnutrición en la EA es alto; sin embargo, se pueden observar diferencias 
significativas entre los estudios debido a diferencias metodológicas. Se 
necesitan estudios epidemiológicos amplios con métodos unificados de evaluación 
nutricional para pacientes con enfermedad de Alzheimer.

INTRODUCTION: Ginseng, known as the "king of herbs," has long been used in 
traditional Chinese medicine due to its beneficial properties, including 
anti-aging, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic effects. Ginsenosides, the 
active compounds in ginseng, have shown promise in treating neurodegenerative 
diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study investigates the 
therapeutic potential of Ginsenoside Ro and its underlying mechanisms in AD 
treatment.
METHODS: In this study, male APP/PS1 transgenic mice were divided into five 
groups and treated with Ginsenoside Ro or ginseng for one month. Cognitive 
function and anxiety were assessed through behavioral tests, including the open 
field test (OFT) and Morris water maze (MWM). To evaluate Aβ deposition, 
neuronal apoptosis, neuroinflammation, and the MAPK pathway, various techniques 
were employed: Thioflavin-T staining, Nissl staining, immunofluorescence, 
Western blot, and qRT-PCR analyses.
RESULTS: Ginsenoside Ro significantly improved cognitive function and reduced 
anxiety in APP/PS1 mice. It also decreased Aβ deposition and ameliorated 
neuronal apoptosis in the cerebral cortex. The treatment regulated the 
expression of pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax and Caspase3) and increased the 
anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. Additionally, Ginsenoside Ro reduced 
neuroinflammation by decreasing IBA1-positive microglia and GFAP-positive 
astrocytes and lowering pro-inflammatory cytokines while enhancing 
anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Furthermore, the phosphorylation levels of p38 
and JNK in the MAPK pathway were significantly reduced, suggesting a key 
mechanism for its therapeutic effects.
DISCUSSION: These findings provide strong evidence supporting Ginsenoside Ro as 
a potential therapeutic agent for Alzheimer's disease. Its effects appear to be 
mediated through the modulation of the IBA1/GFAP-MAPK pathway, which may offer 
new insights into AD treatment strategies.

We examine the relationship between sleep, glymphatics and Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), and recent work questioning glymphatic clearance during sleep. We 
highlight a need for understanding glymphatic and/or other mechanism of 
clearance during sleep, and review glymphatic flow measurement methods. Further, 
we explore dual orexin receptor antagonists (DORAs) potential to mitigate AD 
sleep disturbances and enhance clearance. Further research could elucidate a 
linkage between DORAs, improved sleep and reducing AD pathophysiology.

Perspective: Minimal clinically important difference (MCID) and Alzheimer's 
disease clinical trials.

The minimum clinically important difference (MCID) is a measure of the minimal 
clinically relevant change. The MCID represents the smallest difference in score 
on the measure or domain of interest which patients or clinicians perceive as 
beneficial or as meaningful decline. The MCID is not an alternative clinical 
trial outcome; it does not apply to group measures and is used as a means of 
determining whether an individual patient has reached a threshold of change. 
MCIDs have been derived for symptomatic treatments and for disease targeted 
therapies. MCIDs have been derived for nearly all clinical trial instruments 
used in AD therapeutic research. Application of the MCID to patients on 
disease-targeted therapies requires awareness of the expected increasing 
treatment-no treatment difference exhibited by these agents. The MCID 
complements other strategies for assessing the meaningfulness of interventions 
including effect size, number needed to treat, responder analyses, time saved, 
quality of life, and quality-adjusted life years. MCID is not a required measure 
for regulatory approval of a therapeutic since it is applicable to individual 
patients and not to group outcomes or mean differences used to determine 
treatment benefit in clinical trials.
HIGHLIGHTS: MCID is a key measure of within-person change in cognition, 
function, or behavior when it is applied to metrics of Alzheimer's disease 
progression.In Alzheimer's disease, MCID or minimum within person change (MWPC) 
can function as useful means of determining if a patient has progressed to 
thresholds of detectable change.In Alzheimer's disease, MCID/MWPC can be used to 
determine the number or percent of individuals who have progressed to detectable 
levels of within-person change, with differences anticipated in active treatment 
and placebo groups.MCID/MWPC are not measures that are appropriately applied to 
group outcomes of clinical trials.

INTRODUCTION: Brain network dysfunction, particularly within the default mode 
network (DMN), is an increasingly apparent contributor to the clinical 
progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Repetitive transcranial magnetic 
stimulation (rTMS) can target key DMN hubs, maintain signaling function, and 
delay or improve clinical outcomes in AD. Here, we present the rationale and 
design of a study using off-the-shelf equipment and the latest clinical evidence 
to expand on prior rTMS work and reduce participant burden in the process.
METHODS: We will conduct a two-stage trial of large-coil rTMS targeting the 
precuneus (a key hub in the DMN affected by AD) in 54 participants with mild to 
moderate Alzheimer's Clinical Syndrome focused primarily on determining 
tolerability and feasibility and secondarily focused on determining short-term 
efficacy for memory. The first stage will involve 5 to 10 participants receiving 
open-label active treatment to refine the protocol. The following second stage 
will consist of a 1:1 randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled clinical trial 
to study feasibility and tolerability while exploring target engagement and 
short-term efficacy for memory. Participants will undergo 16 total rTMS brain 
stimulation sessions over the course of 5 weeks. A full course of open-label 
active treatment will be offered as an extension to the sham group after 
unblinding. Outcomes will focus on completion rates and adverse events to 
demonstrate feasibility and tolerability. Further exploratory outcomes will 
include neuropsychological assessments, electroencephalography, neuroimaging, 
and blood biomarkers to demonstrate the feasibility of collection and explore 
preliminary changes in these measures.
RESULTS: We anticipate this treatment is feasible and tolerable and may show 
evidence of target engagement and clinical improvement.
DISCUSSION: Should we achieve expected positive outcomes in feasibility and 
tolerability, this will justify future work focusing on clear demonstrations of 
clinical efficacy and biomarker engagement, as well as enhancement of 
generalizability and scalability.
HIGHLIGHTS: Induction-to-maintenance repetitive transcranial magnetic 
stimulation (rTMS) of the precuneus is a promising treatment for Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), though recent methods require intensive personalization.We propose 
here a trial design of precuneus rTMS in mild-to-early-moderate AD dementia 
using exclusively off-the-shelf equipment and protocol modifications to reduce 
participant burden.Our two novel modifications from prior work are (1) using a 
larger rTMS coil, and (2) consolidating the induction phase of treatment.This 
trial focuses primarily on tolerability and feasibility while exploring clinical 
measures of efficacy and biomarkers of target engagement.Our trial is registered 
at ClinicalTrials.gov NCT06597942.

Pennsylvania, USA.

BACKGROUND: Adults with Down syndrome are living longer and have high risk of 
experiencing Alzheimer's disease as they age. With few services available, music 
is a promising modality that has been shown to support cognitive functioning. 
This study reported on the frequency of music participation for adults with Down 
syndrome and explored associations of age, race and level of intellectual 
disability with music participation.
METHODS: The research team administered a survey to care partners of adults with 
Down syndrome (n = 27) that measured music participation in terms of 'listening' 
and 'playing' using the Guernsey Community Participation and Leisure Assessment.
RESULTS: 44.4% of care partners reported providing over 50 h of care a week. 
92.6% of adults with Down syndrome listened to music, and 33.3% played music 
either weekly or daily. 74.1% of care partners reported that adults with Down 
syndrome could listen to music unaccompanied, and 48.2% of care partners 
reported that adults with Down syndrome could play music unaccompanied. A 
statistically significant association was found between race and playing music.
CONCLUSIONS: Knowing that multiracial adults with Down syndrome had a higher 
frequency in playing music, a potent future research direction is better 
understanding the musical needs and preferences of these diverse adults. 
Broadly, those developing services and supports could consider utilizing music 
as a meaningful activity that does not add care partner burden.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive cognitive decline, 
severe brain atrophy and neuroinflammation. We conducted a randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group phase 2a clinical trial that 
tested the safety and efficacy of laromestrocel, a bone-marrow-derived, 
allogeneic mesenchymal stem-cell therapy, in slowing AD clinical progression, 
atrophy and neuroinflammation. Participants across ten centers in the United 
States were randomly assigned 1:1:1:1 to four infusion groups: group 1 (placebo; 
four monthly infusions, n = 12); group 2 (25 million cells, one infusion 
followed by three monthly infusions of placebo, n = 13); group 3 (25 million 
cells; four monthly doses, n = 13); and group 4 (100 million cells; four monthly 
doses, n = 11). The study met its primary end point of safety; the rate of 
treatment-emergent serious adverse events within 4 weeks of any infusion was 
similar in all four groups: group 1, 0% (95% CI 0-26.5%); group 2, 7.7% (95% CI 
0.2-36%); group 3, 7.7% (95% CI 0.2-36%) and group 4, 9.1% (95% CI 0.2-41.3%). 
Additionally, there were no reported infusion-related reactions, 
hypersensitivities or amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. Laromestrocel 
improved clinical assessments at 39 weeks compared to placebo, as measured by a 
composite AD score (secondary end point was met: group 2 versus placebo change: 
0.38; 95% CI -0.06-0.82), Montreal cognitive assessment and the Alzheimer's 
Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living. At 39 weeks, Laromestrocel 
slowed the decline of whole brain volume compared to placebo (n = 10) by 48.4% 
for all treatment groups combined (groups 2-4: P = 0.005; n = 32) and left 
hippocampal volume by 61.9% (groups 2-4, P = 0.021; n = 32), and reduced 
neuroinflammation as measured by diffusion tensor imaging. The change in 
bilateral hippocampal atrophy correlated with the change in mini-mental state 
exam scores (R = 0.41, P = 0.0075) in all study patients (N = 42). Collectively 
these results support safety of single and multiple doses of laromestrocel 
treatment for mild AD and provide indications of efficacy in combating decline 
of brain volume and potentially cognitive function. Larger-scale clinical trials 
of laromestrocel in AD are warranted. ClinicalTrials.gov registration: 
NCT05233774 .

The scarcity of effective biomarkers and therapeutic strategies for predicting 
disease onset and progression in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) is a major challenge. Conventional drug discovery approaches have 
been unsuccessful in providing efficient interventions due to their 
'one-size-fits-all' nature. As an alternative, personalised drug development 
holds promise to pre-select responders and identifying suitable indicators of 
drug efficacy. In this exploratory study, we have established a pipeline with 
the potential to guide patient stratification studies before clinical trials. 
This pipeline uses 2D and 3D in vitro models of monocyte-derived microglia-like 
cells (MDMi) from AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, and matched 
healthy control (HC) individuals. By profiling cytokine responses in these 
models using multidimensional analyses, we have observed that the 3D model 
offers a more defined separation of profiles between individuals based on 
disease status. While this pilot study focuses on AD and MCI, future 
investigations incorporating other neurodegenerative disorders will be necessary 
to validate the pipeline's findings and demonstrate its broader applicability.

Lipid nanoparticles have shown success in targeting major organs such as the 
liver, spleen, and lungs, but crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB) remains a 
major challenge. Effective brain-targeted delivery systems are essential for 
advancing gene therapy for neurological diseases but remain limited by low 
transport efficiency and poor nucleic acid stability. Here, we report a library 
of ionizable lipids based on the tetrahydroisoquinoline structure of 
protoberberine alkaloids, designed to improve BBB penetration via dopamine D3 
receptor-mediated endocytosis. These nanoparticles offer three key advantages: 
enhanced brain uptake, improved nucleic acid stability through poly(A) 
self-assembly, and minimal immunogenicity with inherent neuroprotective 
properties. In murine models, they demonstrate therapeutic potential in 
Alzheimer's disease, glioma, and cryptococcal meningitis. This 
berberine-inspired delivery system integrates precise receptor targeting with 
nucleic acid stabilization, offering a promising platform for brain-targeted 
therapeutics.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD), one of the most common neurodegenerative 
disorders, is characterised by hallmark abnormalities such as amyloid-β plaques 
and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Emerging evidence suggests that faulty 
insulin signalling contributes to these pathological features, impairing 
critical cellular and metabolic processes.
OBJECTIVE: This review aims to elucidate the role of insulin signalling in the 
central nervous system (CNS) under normal and pathological conditions and to 
explore therapeutic approaches targeting insulin pathways in AD and other 
neurodegenerative diseases.
METHODS: We reviewed studies highlighting the involvement of insulin-signalling 
pathways in neuronal health, with a particular focus on the key components-IRS, 
PI3K, Akt, and GSK-3β-predominantly expressed in cortical and hippocampal 
regions.
RESULTS: Insulin, an essential growth factor, regulates numerous cellular 
functions, including glucose metabolism, mitochondrial activity, oxidative 
stress response, autophagy, synaptic plasticity, and cognitive processes. 
Altered phosphorylation of signalling molecules in insulin pathways contributes 
to oxidative stress, inflammation, and the formation of AD hallmarks. Indirect 
modulators such as NF-κB and caspases further exacerbate neuronal damage, 
linking impaired insulin signalling to neurodegeneration.
CONCLUSION: Insulin signalling plays a crucial role in maintaining neuronal 
health and mitigating neurodegenerative processes. Targeting insulin pathways 
and associated molecules offers promising therapeutic avenues for AD and other 
neurodegenerative disorders.

BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is commonly co-morbid with Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). However, it remains unclear whether T2D itself or the antidiabetic drug 
metformin contributes to the progression of AD.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the overall and independent effects 
of T2D and metformin use on the risk of AD.
METHODS: Summary genome-wide association study datasets were utilized for the 
Mendelian randomization (MR) and multivariable MR (MVMR) analyses, including 
ones for T2D (N = 455,017), metformin (N = 456,276), and AD (N = 453,733). 
Additionally, using the proportional imbalance method, we analyzed AD-related 
adverse drug events in the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database 
(covering Q1 2004 to Q2 2024).
RESULTS: Our two-sample MR analysis indicated that T2D is not associated with 
the risk of AD (OR: 1.03, CI: 0.99-1.08, P = 0.128). However, while not 
statistically significant, genetic signature for metformin exposure demonstrated 
a trend toward an increased risk of AD (OR: 1.05, CI: 1.00-1.09, P = 0.053). 
Interestingly, in MVMR analysis, which evaluates independent effects of T2D and 
metformin exposure on T2D, we found a robust association of T2D with a decrease 
in the risk of AD (OR: 0.82, CI: 0.68-0.98, P = 0.031), while the use of 
metformin was associated with a higher risk of AD (OR: 1.26, CI: 1.06-1.50, P = 
9.45E-3). In the FAERS database, a total of 228,283 metformin-related adverse 
event reports from 67,742 cases were found. For metformin as the target drug and 
AD as the target adverse event, signal analysis reported 29 cases of AD (ROR: 
0.83, 95 % CI: 0.58-1.19, P = 0.3126).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals the opposite independent causal effects of T2D 
and metformin exposure on AD. These findings highlight the importance of 
assessing AD risk when prescribing metformin to patients with T2D.

Alexander disease (AxD) is a rare neurological disorder caused by dominant 
gain-of-function mutations in the gene for glial acidic fibrillary protein 
(GFAP). Expression of mutant protein results in astrocyte dysfunction that 
ultimately leads to developmental delay, failure to thrive, and intellectual and 
motor impairment. The disease is typically fatal, and at present there are no 
preventative or effective treatments. To gain a better understanding of the link 
between astrocyte dysfunction and behavioral deficits in AxD we recently 
developed a rat model that recapitulates many of the clinical features of the 
disease, including failure to thrive, motor impairment, and white matter 
deficits. In the present study, we show that both male and female AxD model rats 
exhibit a neurodegenerative profile with a progressive neuroinflammatory 
response combined with reduced expression of synaptic and mitochondrial 
proteins. Consistent with these results AxD rats show reduced hippocampal 
long-term potentiation and are cognitively impaired, as demonstrated by poor 
performance in the Barnes maze and novel object recognition tests. The AxD rat 
provides a novel model in which to investigate the impact of astrocyte pathology 
on central nervous system function and provides an essential platform for 
further development of effective treatments for AxD and potentially other 
neurodegenerative diseases with astrocyte pathology.Significance Statement 
Alexander disease (AxD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by 
gain-of-function GFAP mutations. We recently developed a Gfap +/R237H rat model 
which demonstrates hallmark astrocyte pathology, myelin deficits, and motor 
impairment. Here, we show that Gfap +/R237H rats also exhibit reduced synaptic 
plasticity and cognitive deficits as additional clinically relevant phenotypes, 
further demonstrating its utility as a model. Hippocampal transcriptomic 
analysis in young adult animals reveals a neurodegenerative signature with an 
innate immune response and loss of synaptic and metabolic gene expression, 
features that are typically associated with chronic diseases of aging. These 
results reveal mechanisms by which astrocyte dysfunction leads to learning and 
memory deficits in AxD and perhaps contributes to other diseases such as 
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.

The introduction of amyloid positron emission tomography and cerebrospinal fluid 
biomarkers, along with the advent of anti-amyloid β antibodies, has brought 
about significant changes in the diagnosis and treatment of dementia. 
Furthermore, new technologies, such as plasma biomarkers, are being developed. 
Therefore, it is increasingly important to accurately convey the latest and most 
appropriate information in daily clinical practice. This paper outlines the 
latest diagnostic criteria, advancements in diagnostic technology, and 
anti-amyloid β antibody therapy for Alzheimer's disease, and discusses important 
points in communicating diagnoses.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Plasma biomarkers of Alzheimer disease (AD), 
neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration are increasingly being used in clinical 
trials for diagnosis and monitoring of dementia. However, their association with 
longitudinal structural brain MRI changes, an important outcome measure across 
neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular diseases, is less known. We investigated 
how baseline plasma biomarkers reflect MRI markers of progression over time in 
patients with neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular diseases.
METHODS: This longitudinal cohort study included patients from the Ontario 
Neurodegenerative Disease Research Initiative diagnosed with AD or mild 
cognitive impairment (AD/MCI), Parkinson disease (PD), frontotemporal dementia 
spectrum disorders (FTD), or cerebrovascular disease (CVD), followed annually 
for 2 years. Recruitment took place at specialized university-based dementia, 
movement disorders, and/or stroke clinics in the province of ON, Canada. MRI 
outcomes included markers of cerebral atrophy (ventricular CSF and regional gray 
matter volumes) and of small vessel disease pathology (white matter 
hyperintensity [WMH], perivascular spaces, and lacunar volumes). Hemorrhagic 
markers at baseline were also included. Plasma levels of glial fibrillary acidic 
protein (GFAP), neurofilament light chain (NfL), phosphorylated tau181 and 
tau217 (p-tau181, p-tau217), and β-amyloid (Aβ42/40) were quantified from blood 
samples collected at baseline using Simoa and used as predictors in linear mixed 
models adjusted for time (months), age, sex, apolipoprotein E (APOE)-ε4 carrier 
status, kidney function, vascular risk factors, microtubule-associated protein 
tau (MAPT) diplotypes, waist-hip circumference ratio, and disease duration.
RESULTS: We analyzed 1,240 MRIs from 473 patients (age: 69.2 ± 7.4 [range: 
49-87]; 32.8% women). Elevated baseline levels of GFAP, NfL, p-tau181, and 
p-tau217, and to a lesser extent decreased levels of Aβ42/40, were significantly 
associated with more cerebral atrophy and WMH burden at baseline (|B| = 0.02 to 
1.69, p = 0.044 to <0.001) and with progression over time (|B| = 0.001 to 0.028, 
p = 0.049 to <0.001) in the pooled disease-agnostic group. Within 
disease-specific cohorts, GFAP and NfL were associated with cerebral atrophy 
and/or small vessel disease copathology in AD/MCI, PD, FTD, or CVD. P-tau181 and 
p-tau217 were associated with cerebral atrophy and/or small vessel disease 
copathology in AD/MCI, CVD, PD-MCI, or PD-dementia.
DISCUSSION: Selected plasma biomarkers seem useful as prognosis and monitoring 
tools of longitudinal imaging changes within real-world populations of 
neurodegenerative and/or cerebrovascular diseases, and provide insight into 
overlap across diseases in shared pathologic burden.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), a growing global challenge, lacks effective preventive 
and therapeutic strategies. This study explored the promising potential of the 
Kaempferia parviflora (KP) and its methoxyflavones (MFs) against the disease. We 
evaluated KP extract and its five MFs for antioxidant capacity, cholinesterase 
inhibition (AChE, and BChE), amyloid plaque (Aβ) reduction, neuroprotection, and 
memory improvement in a mouse model. HPLC quantified the five MFs in KP extract, 
with 5,7-dimethoxyflavone (F1) being the most abundant. 5,7,4'-Trimethoxyflavone 
(F3) and 5-hydroxy-3,7-dimethoxyflavone (F4) exhibited the strongest AChE and 
BChE inhibitory activities, respectively. MFs hindered Aβ1-42 aggregation and 
destabilized fibrils, with F3 showing the potent anti-aggregation and the 
strongest fibril destabilization. They also protected SH-SY5Y cells from 
Aβ1-42-induced damage. Notably, F3 combined anti-cholinesterase and anti-Aβ 
activities, suggesting its potential as a multi-target agent. KP extract 
ameliorated scopolamine-induced memory deficits in mice, suggesting its 
potential for cognitive improvement. These findings revealed that KP can be a 
promising candidate for herbal medicine development against AD. Its multi-target 
MFs offered a unique advantage by targeting multiple AD pathways. KP may have a 
great potential to modify the disease and overcome the challenge of drug 
development as cognitive enhancing herbal medicine.

IMPORTANCE: Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) are the major adverse 
event associated with amyloid-targeting immunotherapy. Identifying clinical 
features and individual risk factors for ARIA could facilitate effective 
prediction and prevention strategies.
OBJECTIVE: To characterize ARIA in participants treated with donanemab.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: These prespecified and post hoc exploratory 
analyses use data from the placebo-controlled portions of the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 
and ALZ 2 randomized clinical trials, conducted from December 2017 to December 
2020 and from June 2020 to April 2023, respectively. Additional analyses are 
included from a stand-alone open-label addendum conducted from August 2021 
through August 2023. Participants in the placebo-controlled trials and the 
open-label addendum aged 60 to 85 years with early symptomatic Alzheimer disease 
and elevated amyloid levels were included. The placebo-controlled trials, but 
not the addendum, had tau inclusion criteria.
INTERVENTIONS: Placebo-controlled trial participants were randomized 1:1 to 
receive placebo or donanemab, and all open-label participants received 
donanemab. Donanemab was administered every 4 weeks for up to 72 weeks.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were the frequency, 
radiographic severity, seriousness, symptoms, timing relative to donanemab 
treatment, and risk factors for ARIA.
RESULTS: Across 3030 total participants (placebo-controlled trials: 999 placebo 
participants, 984 donanemab participants; open-label addendum: 1047 donanemab 
participants), mean (SD) age was approximately 73.7 (6.0) years and 1684 
participants (55.6%) were female. Frequencies of ARIA-edema/effusions (ARIA-E) 
and ARIA-microhemorrhages and hemosiderin deposition (ARIA-H) were higher with 
donanemab (24.4% and 31.3% in placebo-controlled trials, respectively; 19.8% and 
27.2% in open-label addendum, respectively) than with placebo (1.9% and 13.0%, 
respectively). ARIA-E was mostly mild or moderate in severity. Serious ARIA-E 
was reported in 1.5% and symptomatic ARIA-E in 5.8% of donanemab-treated 
participants in the placebo-controlled trials. Symptoms most frequently reported 
with ARIA-E were headache and confusional state. In 58.3% of donanemab-treated 
participants with ARIA-E, the first event occurred by the third infusion 
(approximately month 3). Risk analysis demonstrated independent associations 
between ARIA-E and 6 baseline variables, including increased risk with APOE ε4 
allele number, greater number of microhemorrhages, presence of cortical 
superficial siderosis, higher amyloid plaque, and elevated mean arterial 
pressure, and decreased risk with antihypertensive use.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: ARIA is an adverse event associated with donanemab 
treatment that requires safety monitoring. Individual ARIA risk can be assessed 
by APOE ε4 status and baseline imaging findings.

Plasma levels of protein biomarkers glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and 
neurofilament light (NEFL) are key dementia biomarkers, but it is unclear how 
risk genes for Alzheimer's disease (AD) influence levels of these biomarkers. We 
investigated the association of the established high-effect variants for AD in 
APOE and TREM2 with these biomarkers, using data from over 50,000 participants 
from the UK Biobank (UKB). The results show that APOE4 is associated with 
elevated levels of plasma GFAP, and to a lesser extent, NEFL. The APOE4 effect 
on GFAP increases with age and the number of APOE4 alleles. The risk variants 
R47H and R62H in TREM2 are associated with higher NEFL levels, but not with 
GFAP, and the effect sizes do not increase with age. Higher levels of both GFAP 
and NEFL in midlife are significantly associated with greater risk for incident 
dementia. In contrast, the protective APOE2 allele showed no effect on GFAP or 
NEFL. In conclusion, we find that major genetic risk factors for AD 
differentially affect dementia protein biomarkers across age, indicating gene 
specific pathways with potential therapeutic implications.

BACKGROUND: Genetic risk factors for psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders 
are well documented. However, some individuals with high genetic risk remain 
unaffected, and the mechanisms underlying such resilience remain poorly 
understood. The presence of protective resilience factors that mitigate risk 
could help explain the disconnect between predicted risk and reality, 
particularly for brain disorders, where genetic contributions are substantial 
but incompletely understood. Identifying and studying resilience factors could 
improve our understanding of pathology, enhance risk prediction, and inform 
preventive measures or treatment strategies. However, such efforts are 
complicated by the difficulty of identifying resilience that is separable from 
low risk.
METHODS: We developed a novel adversarial multi-task neural network model to 
detect genetic resilience markers. The model learns to separate high-risk 
unaffected individuals from affected individuals at similar risk while 
"unlearning" patterns found in low-risk groups using adversarial learning. In 
simulated and existing Alzheimer's disease (AD) datasets, we identified markers 
of resilience with a feature-importance-based approach that prioritized 
specificity, generated resilience scores, and analyzed associations with 
polygenic risk scores (PRS).
RESULTS: In simulations, our model had high specificity and moderate sensitivity 
in identifying resilience markers, outperforming traditional approaches. Applied 
to AD data, the model generated genetic resilience scores protective against AD 
and independent of PRS. We identified five resilience-associated SNPs, including 
known AD-associated variants, underscoring their potential involvement in 
risk/resilience interactions.
CONCLUSIONS: Our methods of modeling and evaluation of feature-importance 
successfully identified resilience markers that were obscured in previous work. 
The high specificity of our model provides high confidence that these markers 
reflect resilience and not simply low risk. Our findings support the utility of 
resilience scores in modifying risk predictions, particularly for high-risk 
groups. Expanding this method could aid in understanding resilience mechanisms, 
potentially improving diagnosis, prevention, and treatment strategies for AD and 
other complex brain disorders.

To elucidate the impact of Aβ pathology on microglia in Alzheimer's disease 
pathogenesis, we profiled the microglia surfaceome following treatment with Aβ 
fibrils. Our findings reveal that Aβ-associated human microglia upregulate 
Glypican 4 (GPC4), a GPI-anchored heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG). In a 
Drosophila amyloidosis model, glial GPC4 expression exacerbates motor deficits 
and reduces lifespan, indicating that glial GPC4 contributes to a toxic cellular 
program during neurodegeneration. In cell culture, GPC4 enhances microglia 
phagocytosis of tau aggregates, and shed GPC4 can act in trans to facilitate tau 
aggregate uptake and seeding in neurons. Additionally, our data demonstrate that 
GPC4-mediated effects are amplified in the presence of APOE. These studies offer 
a mechanistic framework linking Aβ and tau pathology through microglial HSPGs 
and APOE.

BACKGROUND: The epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are derivatives of the 
arachidonic acid metabolism with anti-inflammatory activities. However, their 
efficacy is limited due to the rapid hydrolasis by the soluble epoxide hydrolase 
(sEH). Accordingly, inhibition of sEH has been shown to stabilize the EETs and 
dampen neuroinflammation in Aβ mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
However, the role of the sEH-EET signaling pathway in other cell types of the 
CNS and in other neurodegenerative conditions are less understood.
METHODS: Here we examined the mechanisms and the functional role of the sEH-EET 
axis in tauopathy by treating the PS19 mice with a small molecule sEH inhibitor 
TPPU and by crossing the PS19 mice with Ephx2 (gene encoding sEH) knockout mice, 
followed by single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq), biochemical and 
immunohistochemical characterization, and behavioral analysis. We also tested 
the effect of the sEH-EET pathway in primary microglia cultures and human 
induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons that develop 
seeding-induced Tau inclusions.
RESULTS: We show that sEH inhibition improved cognitive function, rescued 
neuronal cell loss, and reduced Tau pathology and microglia reactivity. 
snRNA-seq revealed that TPPU treatment resulted in the upregulation of actin 
cytoskeleton and excitatory synaptic pathway genes. Treating the human 
iPSC-derived neurons with TPPU led to enhanced synaptic density without 
affecting Tau accumulation, indicating a cell-autonomous effect of sEH blockade 
in neuroprotection. Further, sEH inhibition reversed disease-associated and 
interferon-response microglia states in PS19 mice and EET supplementation 
enhanced Tau phagocytosis and clearance in primary microglia cultures.
CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that sEH blockade or EET augmentation 
confer therapeutic benefit against neurodegenerative tauopathies through 
parallel targeting of neuronal and microglial pathways.

Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease that progressively damages the 
supporting structures of teeth, resulting in gum bleeding, inflammation, gum 
recession, and eventual tooth loss. Key factors, including poor oral hygiene, 
plaque accumulation, smoking, inadequate nutrition, and genetic predisposition, 
drive its development. Recent evidence underscores the potential role of 
periodontitis as a contributing factor to systemic diseases, including 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is a neurodegenerative disorder marked by memory 
loss, cognitive decline, and brain inflammation. Emerging clinical and 
experimental studies indicate that these two conditions share overlapping risk 
factors and may be interconnected. One notable finding is the detection of 
specific periodontal pathogens, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. 
gingivalis), in the brains of individuals with AD. This suggests a possible link 
between chronic oral infections and neurodegeneration. These pathogens are 
believed to exacerbate neuroinflammatory processes by activating microglia and 
promoting systemic inflammation, which is central to AD pathogenesis. Further 
research is needed to clarify the biological mechanisms underlying this 
association. Targeted interventions that address periodontitis, such as 
anti-inflammatory therapies or treatments targeting specific pathogens like P. 
gingivalis, could potentially mitigate its impact on the onset and progression 
of AD, offering a novel avenue for prevention and management strategies.

Multifunctional ligand design strategy may be a promising approach for the 
treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). α-Mangostin (α-M), a natural small 
molecule with anti-AD properties, was used as the lead compound for the design 
and synthesis of six α-M derivatives (1-6) with the help of 
computer-aided-drug-design (CADD). Both theoretical calculations and 
experimental results suggested that 1-6 might serve as promising selective 
butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) inhibitors and amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregation 
inhibitors. Meanwhile, experimental results confirmed the high selectivity of 
the derivatives, in which 1 had the best inhibitory activity and selectivity on 
BuChE (IC50 = 0.016 µM, SI = 700.63). The experimental results also showed that 
1-6 could act as copper chelators and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers. 
Furthermore, in vivo experiments with Caenorhabditis elegans also showed that 1 
could scavenge ROS and inhibit Aβ aggregation. Notably, single crystals of 1, 4, 
and the 4-Cu(II) complex were prepared for the first time, which provided a 
reliable structural basis for analyzing the structure-activity relationship. The 
dimethylamino derivatives (1, 4) of α-M showed the best activities and were 
expected to become promising candidate drugs for multifunctional anti-AD.

Cancer and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are among the most prevalent diseases in 
contemporary society, exerting profound psychological and physical distress on 
affected individuals and their kin. There is an emerging consensus from 
epidemiological studies suggesting a potential inverse relationship between the 
two conditions; that is, the presence of one disease might offer some level of 
protection against the other. The etiology of both cancer and AD is intricately 
linked to dysregulation and perturbations in critical signaling pathways. These 
pathways, along with the diverse factors they encompass, exert distinct 
influences on the pathogenesis of two diseases. In this paper, we make a short 
review of the different mutations in the relevant signaling pathways between 
cancer and AD and introduce a few representative drugs for the two diseases 
based on various targets to provide a new idea for treating cancer and AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is caused by the accumulation of amyloid-beta, 
is a major medical concern today. Controlling these aggregates is critical to 
drug development, but delivering them effectively into the bloodstream poses 
significant challenges. In this context, aromatherapy has been proposed as an 
innovative and promising approach for AD disease. The volatile compounds 
cinnamaldehyde, phenylethyl alcohol, α-asarone, and β-caryophyllene have 
neuroprotective effects that can be effective in the treatment of 
neurodegenerative diseases like AD. The amyloid-beta (Aβ) fragment (25-35), 
which retains the properties of the full-length Aβ is used as a suitable model 
to evaluate the potential toxicity associated with AD. This study investigated 
the effects of the four mentioned volatile compounds at four different 
concentrations on the fibrillation process of the Aβ (25-35) peptide. Structural 
changes in the peptide have been analyzed using various techniques such as 
fluorescence probing, far-UV circular dichroism spectroscopy (CD), and atomic 
force microscopy (AFM). Fluorescence probing results showed that these compounds 
can effectively prevent the formation of amyloid fibrils by forming chemical 
bonds with the intermediate species. CD spectroscopy results indicated a 
decrease in β-sheet content of fibrils and confirmed the effect of pH on 
structural changes. AFM analysis revealed that volatile compounds effectively 
prevented the formation of amyloid fibrils at different concentrations and 
changed the average size of intermediates and oligomeric species. These findings 
show a promising future for AD patients and emphasize the importance of natural 
compounds in the treatment and prevention of neurodegenerative diseases.

In the context of global ageing, the prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases 
and dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), is increasing. However, the 
current symptomatic and disease-modifying therapies have achieved limited 
benefits for neurodegenerative diseases in clinical settings. Halting the 
progress of neurodegeneration and cognitive decline or even improving impaired 
cognition and function are the clinically meaningful goals of treatments for 
neurodegenerative diseases. Ageing is the primary risk factor for 
neurodegenerative diseases and their associated comorbidities, such as vascular 
pathologies, in elderly individuals. Thus, we aim to elucidate the role of 
ageing in neurodegenerative diseases from the perspective of a complex system, 
in which the brain is the core and peripheral organs and tissues form a holistic 
network to support brain functions. During ageing, the progressive deterioration 
of the structure and function of the entire body hampers its active and adaptive 
responses to various stimuli, thereby rendering individuals more vulnerable to 
neurodegenerative diseases. Consequently, we propose that the prevention and 
treatment of neurodegenerative diseases should be grounded in holistic 
antiageing and rejuvenation means complemented by interventions targeting 
disease-specific pathogenic events. This integrated approach is a promising 
strategy to effectively prevent, pause or slow down the progression of 
neurodegenerative diseases.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by a decline in cognitive, 
learning, and memory abilities. Neuroinflammation is associated with the spread 
of tau tangles in the neocortex of AD, leading to cognitive impairment. 
Therefore, clarifying the pathogenesis of Neuroinflammation and finding 
effective treatments are the crucial issues for the clinical management of AD.
METHOD: We systematically review the latest research on the pathogenesis and 
therapeutic strategies of AD in PubMed, Web of Science, and Elsevier SD.
RESULT: In this review, the mechanism of the effect of gut-brain axis lipid 
metabolism mediated by circadian rhythm on AD was discussed, and we also 
analysed the effects of inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) 
induced by lipid abnormalities on intestinal mucosal barrier and 
neurodegeneration; furthermore, the importance of lipid homeostasis 
(phospholipids, fatty acids, sterol) in maintaining the functions of endoplasmic 
reticulum was emphasized. Meanwhile, as lipid composition affects protein 
conformation, the membrane phospholipids surrounding sarcoplasmic reticulum 
Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) that influence SERCA to release Ca2+ mediating inflammation 
were also reviewed.
CONCLUSION: We interpreted the mechanism of action between lipid microdomains 
and ER membrane proteins, reviewed the role of the new pathway of circadian 
rhythm, lipid metabolism, intestinal mucosa, and brain signaling in the 
pathogenesis of AD, and proposed strategies to prevent AD by changing the 
dietary lipid measures.

Programmed cell death (PCD) in the brain occurs throughout the whole process of 
life, and abnormal PCD may be an important factor leading to encephalopathy. It 
has been demonstrated that acupuncture has a good cerebral protective effect in 
the treatment of epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, depression, 
anxiety, insomnia, migraine and other dozens of brain diseases, and possesses 
characteristics of multi-point, networking, two-way and holistic regulation. In 
the present paper, we sum up the protective effect of acupuncture therapy from 
1) cell apoptosis (for example, improving post-surgery cognition impairment, 
traumatic brain injury and ischemic stroke by relieving mitochondrial damage, 
activating mitochondrial autophagy, increasing blood-brain barrier permeability, 
and thus reducing cell apoptosis ), 2) cell autophagy (for example, improving 
post-surgery cognition impairment, traumatic brain injury and ischemic stroke by 
relieving mitochondrial damage, activating mitochondrial autophagy, and 
increasing blood-brain barrier permeability, and thus reducing cell apoptosis), 
3) pyroptosis (for example, inhibiting abnormally-activated inflammasomes, and 
caspase and gasdermin D activity to remit pyroptosis in the treatment of stroke, 
depression, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease animal models), 4) 
ferroptosis (for instance, regulating iron ion metabolism, relieving lipid 
peroxidation damage, and thus playing a brain protection role in the treatment 
of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke animal models), 5) necroptosis (inhibiting 
necrotic apoptosis mediated by receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 in 
intracerebral hemorrhage rats), and so on. We believe that along with the 
continuous development of brain science, artificial intelligence, big data and 
other new concepts and new technologies, it is expected to expand and improve 
the research level and quality of acupuncture in the prevention and treatment of 
encephalopathy through faster, more accurate and more comprehensive methods, 
which will help promote the modern interpretation of the brain protective effect 
of traditional acupuncture from the perspective of acupuncture regulation of 
PCD.

We describe the model developed by two separate healthcare systems to deliver 
the antiamyloid therapy, lecanemab, to patients with mild cognitive impairment 
and mild dementia. Based on current guidelines, the experience of two separate 
healthcare systems that developed lecanemab clinical care delivery programs is 
described in detail including the development of patient eligibility criteria, 
cooperation with specialty services, patient monitoring, and practical steps 
required to safely implement lecanemab programs at a systems level. Geriatric 
psychiatrists have a prominent role in prescribing and monitoring antiamyloid 
therapy in both systems and we highlight the unique role of the geriatric 
psychiatrist in the future delivery of antiamyloid therapies as memory care 
specialists.

Colocalization of Neurotransmitters in Hippocampus and Afferent Systems: 
Possible Functional Role.

Sciences, Pushchino, Moscow Region, 142290, Russia. vkitchigina@gmail.com.

In neurophysiology, the transmitter phenotype is considered as an indicator of 
neuronal identity. It has become known at the end of last century that a nerve 
cell can produce and use several different molecules to communicate with other 
neurons. These could be "classical" transmitters: glutamate or 
gamma-aminobutyric acid (or acetylcholine, serotonin, norepinephrine), as well 
as secondary messengers, mainly neuropeptides released from the same neurons. In 
the case, when classical neurotransmitters are released together from the same 
nerve cell, this event is called cotransmission or corelease (release from the 
same vesicles). In this review article, the term "cotransmission" is used in a 
broad sense, denoting neurons that can release more than one classical mediator. 
Since transmitters are often intermediate products of metabolism and are found 
in many cells, the neuron classification is currently based on the carrier 
proteins (transporters) that "pack" neurotransmitters synthesized in the 
cytoplasm into vesicles. Here, we limit the issue of colocalization of the main 
neurotransmitters in mammals to the neurons of hippocampus and those structures 
that send their pathways to it. The review considers problems concerning the 
mechanisms of multitransmitter signaling, as well as probable functional role of 
mediator colocalization in the work of hippocampus, which yet has been poorly 
understood. It has been suggested that co-expression of different mediator 
phenotypes is involved in maintaining the balance of excitation and inhibition 
in different regions of hippocampus, facilitates rapid selection of information 
processing mode, induction of long-term potentiation, maintenance of spatial 
coding by place cells, as well as ensuring flexibility of learning and formation 
of working memory. However, the functional role of mediator colocalization, as 
well as the mechanisms of release of "dual" transmitters, have not been fully 
elucidated. The solution of these problems will advance some areas of 
fundamental neuroscience and help in the treatment of those diseases, where 
disruption of the balance between excitation and inhibition is detected, such 
as, for example, in epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, and many others.

INTRODUCTION: This study investigates whether the ability to tolerate distress 
decreases in caregivers of patients with Alzheimer's disease who also experience 
sleep disturbances.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty patients and their caregivers, who were 
hospitalised with a diagnosis of severe Alzheimer's disease and were bedridden, 
were included in the study. The caregivers of the patients completed the Jenkins 
Sleep Scale to assess the patients' sleep disturbances, and the Distress 
Tolerance Scale was administered to measure the caregivers' distress tolerance.
RESULTS: A significant difference was observed between patients' sleep 
disturbance duration for 'Trouble falling asleep', 'Waking up and trouble 
falling asleep again', and caregivers' Distress Tolerance Scale questions 9 and 
13. A negative correlation was found between caregivers' age and question 11 on 
the Distress Tolerance Scale.
CONCLUSION: The distress tolerance of caregivers of patients with severe 
Alzheimer's disease and sleep disturbances is negatively affected by the sleep 
disturbances of the patients and the caregivers' gender, with male caregivers 
reporting lower distress tolerance.

Decreased hemoglobin (Hb) levels in peripheral blood may be a risk factor for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Hb-α is a monomeric form of Hb that exists in the 
central nervous system. Our previous RNA sequencing results revealed a decrease 
in the expression of the Hb-α gene in the hippocampus of AD model mice. However, 
the effects of Hb-α deficiency in the hippocampus on cognitive function and the 
underlying mechanism are unclear. Running exercise has been shown to improve 
cognition, but whether it can reverse the damage caused by Hb-α deficiency in 
the hippocampus needs to be further researched. In the present study, Mendelian 
randomization (MR) analyses revealed that lower levels of mean corpuscular Hb 
and Hemoglobin alpha 1 (HBA1) increased the risk of developing AD. When an 
adeno-associated virus (AAV) was used to knock down hippocampal Hb-α, the 
learning and memory ability of the resulting model mice decreased, similar to 
that of AD model mice. Moreover, the expression levels of advanced glycation end 
products (AGE) and their receptor (RAGE) were upregulated, microglia were 
activated, and the number of engulfed synapses increased, which damaged the 
number and structure of hippocampal synapses in the model mice. However, four 
weeks of voluntary wheel exercise effectively improved these conditions. In 
addition, we found that voluntary wheel exercise may compensate for Hb-α protein 
deficiency in the hippocampus by increasing the expression levels of Hb-α 
protein in plasma, cerebrospinal fluid, and other brain regions without altering 
Hb-α mRNA in the hippocampus of model mice. These results highlight the key role 
of Hb-α in hippocampal synaptic damage, elucidate the mechanism by which running 
exercise improves cognition by connecting the peripheral circulation and central 
nervous system through Hb-α, and provide new ideas for the diagnosis and 
treatment of AD.

Hippocampal sclerosis (HS) is a pathological condition characterized by 
significant loss of hippocampal neurons and gliosis. This condition represents 
the most common neuropathological change observed in patients with temporal lobe 
epilepsy (TLE) and is also found in aging individuals. TLE related to HS is the 
most prevalent type of drug-resistant epilepsy in adults, and its underlying 
mechanisms are not yet fully understood. Therefore, developing improved methods 
for predicting and treating drug-resistant patients with TLE-HS is crucial. 
Patients with TLE-HS often experience cognitive impairment and psychological 
comorbidities, significantly affecting their quality of life. Consequently, a 
thorough review of the current research status of TLE-HS is essential, focusing 
on its prediction, diagnosis, treatment, and underlying mechanisms. The 
hippocampus plays a pivotal role in memory and cognition. HS of aging 
(HS-Aging), a condition linked to dementia in the ultra-elderly, is marked by 
severe CA1 (cornu ammonis) neuronal loss and frequent transactive response 
DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) proteinopathy, often misdiagnosed as 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nonetheless, clinical characteristics and patterns of 
hippocampal atrophy can help differentiate between the two disorders. This 
review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the pathological features of 
HS, the relevant mechanisms underlying TLE-HS and HS-Aging, current imaging 
diagnostic techniques, including machine learning, and available treatment 
modalities. It also explores the prognosis and comorbidities related to these 
conditions. Future research directions include establishing animal models to 
clarify the poorly understood mechanisms underlying HS, particularly those 
related to emotional processing. Investigating post-HS behavioral and cognitive 
changes in these models will lay the foundation for further advancements in this 
field. This review is a cornerstone for future investigations and suggests 
additional research endeavors.

Metabolic abnormalities and gut microbiota imbalance are intricately linked to 
the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Kai-Xin-San (KXS) is a 
traditional herbal formula known for its therapeutic effects on AD. Our previous 
research indicated that Kai-Xin-San polysaccharide (KXS-P) exhibits a 
significant therapeutic impact on AD, but the precise mechanisms remain 
incompletely understood. In this study, untargeted fecal metabolomics and 16S 
rRNA gene sequencing were used to investigate the potential mechanisms by which 
KXS-P acts against AD. Key metabolites and gut microbial species were identified 
using multivariate analysis and a comprehensive examination of intestinal 
microecology. Our findings revealed that KXS-P improves lipid metabolism in AD 
rats by modulating a series of lipid molecules and bile acid levels. 
Additionally, KXS-P regulated gut microbiota composition and restored the 
symbiotic relationships within the gut microbiome. Notably, the 
anti-inflammatory effect of KXS-P may be related to its regulation of specific 
lipotypes levels and the abundance of Romboutsia, Bifidobacterium and 
Alloprevotella. KXS-P demonstrates the ability to alleviate symptoms of AD rats 
through multiple mechanisms: ① Improving lipid metabolism and maintaining lipid 
homeostasis; ② Reducing neuronal and inflammatory damage; ③ Regulating the 
composition and symbiotic relationships of gut microbiota to preserve intestinal 
microecological balance.

S100 calcium-binding protein B, a member of the S100 protein family, plays an 
important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease, 
a neurodegenerative disorder, is characterized by amyloid-beta plaques, 
neurofibrillary tangles, progressive dementia, and severe neuroinflammation. 
S100 calcium-binding protein B, predominantly secreted by astrocytes, exhibits a 
dual role in Alzheimer's disease, where at low (nanomolar) concentrations, it 
exhibits neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects and enhances synaptic 
plasticity, while at higher concentrations, it contributes to neuroinflammation 
and neuronal damage. In addition to its pathological roles in Alzheimer's 
disease, S100 calcium-binding protein B is also considered a potential 
biomarker, as increased levels correlate with cognitive decline and disease 
progression in cerebrospinal fluid. Targeting S100 calcium-binding protein B 
and/or its interaction with the receptor for advanced glycation end-products 
seems to be a potential target for therapeutic intervention. The development of 
multiple treatment approaches, such as pharmacological inhibitors, 
immunotherapy, and modulation of S100 calcium-binding protein B / receptor for 
advanced glycation end-products signalling pathways, might help to reduce 
neuroinflammation and amyloid-beta deposition effectively. This review aims to 
provide an overview of the role of S100 calcium-binding protein B in Alzheimer's 
disease and to explore its potential as a treatment target, well-grounded in its 
dual nature. Understanding S100 calcium-binding protein B's involvement in the 
pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease may advance its application as a biomarker 
and help in the development of new treatment strategies, ultimately improving 
patients' quality of life.

Protein aggregation is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases, which connects 
these neuropathologies by a common phenotype. Various proteins and peptides form 
aggregates that are poorly degraded, and their ensuing pathological accumulation 
underlies these neurodegenerative diseases. Similarities may exist in the 
mechanisms responsible for the buildup of these aggregates. Therefore, 
therapeutics designed to treat one neurodegenerative disease may be beneficial 
to others. In ALS models, the compound NU-9 was previously shown to block 
neurodegeneration produced by aggregation-inducing mutations of SOD-1 and TDP-43 
[B. Genç et al., Clin. Transl. Med. 11, e336 (2021)]. Here, we report that NU-9 
also prevents the accumulation of amyloid beta oligomers (AβOs), small peptide 
aggregates that are instigators of Alzheimer's disease neurodegeneration [M. 
Tolar et al., Int. J. Mol. Sci. 22, 6355 (2021)]. AβO buildup was measured by 
immunofluorescence imaging of cultured hippocampal neurons exposed to exogenous 
monomeric Aβ. In this model, AβO buildup occurs via cathepsin L- and 
dynamin-dependent trafficking. This is prevented by NU-9 through a cellular 
mechanism that is cathepsin B- and lysosome-dependent, suggesting that NU-9 
enhances the ability of endolysosomal trafficking to protect against AβO 
buildup. This possibility is strongly supported by a quantitative assay for 
autophagosomes that shows robust stimulation by NU-9. These results contribute 
additional understanding to the mechanisms of protein aggregation and suggest 
that multiple neurodegenerative diseases might be treatable by targeting common 
pathogenic mechanisms responsible for protein aggregation.

The Alzheimer's Disease in Older Adults with Chronic Conditions (ADACC) Network 
is funded by the National Institute on Aging as a U24 cooperative agreement. 
ADACC is an inclusive, multidisciplinary group across multiple institutions that 
is charged with the task of developing evidence-based strategies for the use and 
implementation of Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease-related dementias 
(AD/ADRD) biomarkers among older adults with cognitive impairment and multiple 
chronic conditions (MCCs). This report summarizes highlights of the First Annual 
Symposium of ADACC, which was held in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, in April 
2024. An overview of the ADACC Network and goals were initially described, 
followed by a state of the science integrating biomarkers, AD/ADRD, and MCCs. 
Multiple presentations on a variety of topics were featured, including the 
significance of MCCs in AD/ADRD, the effects of MCCs on Alzheimer's blood-based 
biomarkers, the incorporation of AD/ADRD biomarkers into cancer care, the need 
to address racial and biomarker disparities, clinician and patient perspectives 
on plasma AD/ADRD biomarker testing, and ethical considerations. ADACC 
emphasized the importance of supporting emerging researchers and fostering a 
collaborative environment.

This study investigates the impact of combined special education and 
occupational therapy intervention on cognitive functions in Alzheimer's 
patients. Specifically, it evaluates changes measured by the Addenbrooke's 
Cognitive Examination (ACE-R) after six months compared to a control group 
receiving standard care. A longitudinal, controlled experiment was conducted 
with random assignment to experimental and control groups. The experimental 
group underwent three weekly interventions of 45-50 min over eight months in 
2021. Cognitive functions were periodically assessed using ACE-R. Power analysis 
determined a sample size of 128 participants for adequate statistical power; the 
study included 60 participants (30 per group). Data were analyzed using 
non-parametric methods due to non-normal data distribution. The experimental 
group showed significant improvement in ACE-R scores compared to the control 
group. The mean difference in scores was 10.27 points (SD = 2.83) for the 
experimental group, indicating improved cognitive function, while the control 
group showed a mean decrease of 5.67 points (SD = 2.06). Statistical analysis 
confirmed significant differences between groups at both interim and final 
assessments (p < 0.001). The combined special education and occupational therapy 
intervention led to significant cognitive improvements in Alzheimer's patients 
compared to standard care. The study supports the efficacy of such interventions 
in enhancing cognitive functions, as evidenced by the substantial score 
increases in the experimental group.

The progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its interaction with 
COVID-19-induced social isolation remains poorly understood. This study 
investigated the longitudinal trajectories of AD severity on cognitive function, 
functional ability, and neuropsychiatric symptoms, and examined the impact of 
COVID-19 lockdown on AD patients in South Korea. In this retrospective 
longitudinal study, data from 253 adults (aged ≥ 55) diagnosed with mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD were analyzed, collected between 2018 and 2022. 
Participants were classified into four groups based on clinical dementia rating 
(CDR) scores: MCI, AD-CDR0.5, AD-CDR1, and AD-CDR2. Cognitive function, 
functional abilities, neuropsychiatric symptoms, depressive symptoms, and 
overall dementia severity were assessed. Linear mixed-effects models, along with 
mediation and moderation analyses were employed to analyze the data. Significant 
trajectories of decline in cognitive function and functional abilities were 
observed over time, with more pronounced declines in higher AD severity groups. 
The COVID-19 lockdown exacerbated cognitive decline and impairment in activities 
of daily living (ADL) specifically in the most severe AD group (AD-CDR2). 
Instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) mediated the relationship between 
mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scores and CDR sum of boxes (CDR-SB) in the 
MCI, AD-CDR0.5, and AD-CDR1 groups. A significant interaction between MMSE 
scores and neuropsychiatric symptoms was observed in the moderate AD group 
(AD-CDR1), indicating that worsening neuropsychiatric symptoms intensified 
cognitive decline. Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) scores increased over time, 
indicating worsening neuropsychiatric symptoms, whereas depressive symptoms, 
measured by the short geriatric depression scale (SGDS), remained stable over 
the study period. This study highlights the impact of AD severity on cognitive 
and functional decline, further exacerbated by the COVID-19 lockdown. The 
mediating role of IADL suggests that maintaining complex daily activities may be 
crucial in slowing disease progression in AD patients. Additionally, the 
worsening of neuropsychiatric symptoms underscores the need for targeted mental 
health support, especially during periods of social isolation, to mitigate 
adverse effects on patients and caregivers.

Tinospora cordifolia has been used for thousands of years to treat various 
health conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases. The study aimed to 
elucidate the mechanism of action and protein targets of T. cordifolia in the 
context of Alzheimer's disease through untargeted metabolomics and network 
pharmacology. LC-MS/MS analysis resulted in 1186 metabolites, including known 
bioactive compounds such as liquiritin, Plastoquinone 3, and Shoyuflavone A, to 
name a few. The network pharmacology analysis highlighted the metabolite-protein 
interaction with the enrichment of 591 human proteins, including 
neurotransmitter receptors and other regulatory proteins. Pathway analysis 
highlighted the enrichment of cAMP, mTOR, MAPK, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways 
along with cholinergic, dopaminergic, serotonergic, glutamatergic synapse, and 
apoptosis. The docking results suggest that T. cordifolia metabolites could 
interact with key Alzheimer's disease targets BACE1 and MAO-B, suggesting its 
role in neuroprotection. These findings provide insights into the biochemical 
pathways underlying T. cordifolia's therapeutic effects and provides a 
foundation for future exploration of T. cordifolia in the context of 
translational research.

BACKGROUND: Integrating machine learning with medical records offers potential 
for early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD), enabling timely interventions.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning 
in constructing a predictive model for AD, designed to predict AD with data up 
to three years before diagnosis. Using clinical data, including prior diagnoses 
and medical treatments, we sought to enhance sensitivity and specificity in 
diagnostic procedures. A second aim was to identify the most important factors 
in the machine learning models, as these may be important predictors of AD.
DESIGN: The study employed Stochastic Gradient Boosting, a machine learning 
method, to identify diagnoses predictive of AD using primary healthcare data. 
The analyses were stratified by sex and age groups.
SETTING: The study included individuals within Region Stockholm, Sweden, using 
medical records from 2010 to 2022.
PARTICIPANTS: The study analyzed clinical data for individuals over the age of 
40. Patients with an AD diagnosis (ICD-10-SE codes F00 or G30) during 2010-2012 
were excluded to ensure prospective modeling. In total, AD was identified in 
3,407 patients aged 41-69 years and 25,796 patients aged over 69.
MEASUREMENTS: The machine learning model ranked predictive diagnoses, with 
performance assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic 
curve (AUC). Known and novel predictors were evaluated for their contribution to 
AD risk.
RESULTS: AUC values ranged from 0.748 (women aged 41-69) to 0.816 (women over 
69), with men across age groups falling within this range. Sensitivity and 
specificity ranged from 0.73 to 0.79 and 0.66 to 0.79, respectively, across age 
and gender groups. Negative predictive values were consistently high (≥0.954), 
while positive predictive values were lower (0.199-0.351). Additionally, we 
confirmed known risk factors as predictors and identified novel predictors that 
warrant further investigation. Key predictors included medical observations, 
cognitive symptoms, antidepressant treatment, visit frequency, and vitamin 
B12/folic acid treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning applied to clinical data shows promise in 
predicting AD, with robust model performance across age and sex groups. The 
findings confirmed known risk factors, such as depression and vitamin B12 
deficiency, while also identifying novel predictors that may guide future 
research. Clinically, this approach could enhance early detection and risk 
stratification, facilitating timely interventions and improving patient 
outcomes.

Dementia is a growing global public health concern. The search for effective 
anti-dementia drugs with fewer side effects, particularly in the early stages of 
the disease, is a key focus of current research. Natural compounds like 
1-Epilupinine (ELP) may offer therapeutic potential for cognitive improvement 
and neuroprotection. To assess the potential of ELP in improving dementia and 
neuroinflammation in a scopolamine-induced dementia model in mice, a mouse model 
was induced using scopolamine hydrobromide, with Donepezil as the positive 
control. After five days of treatment, cognitive performance was assessed using 
the Morris water maze test. Motor function and anxiety-related behaviors were 
evaluated through the open field test. An inflammatory factor array was employed 
to measure inflammatory markers in the prefrontal cortex. The Morris water maze 
showed that the model group treated with scopolamine hydrobromide (1 mg/kg) had 
significantly fewer platform crossings and longer latency (P < 0.001) while mice 
treated with ELP (5 mg/kg) exhibited improved performance, with more crossings 
and reduced latency (P < 0.01), suggesting ELP effectively reversed cognitive 
deficits. In the open field test, no significant difference of total movement 
distance was detected in ELP-treated groups, indicating it did not impair motor 
function. The result of the inflammation factors array detecting showed lower 
levels of GM-CSF, IFN-γ, IL-2, and IL-23 significantly in the ELP (5 mg/kg) 
group, suggesting its potential anti-inflammatory properties for the dementia 
treatment. Therefore, ELP may serve as a promising treatment for early-stage 
dementia, offering cognitive improvement alongside anti-inflammatory 
neuroprotection.

BACKGROUND: Synapse loss and damage are underlying causes of Alzheimer's 
disease. Duloxetine has been identified as a mimetic of neural adhesion molecule 
L1CAM, a neuronal synapse component, suggesting duloxetine could be therapeutic 
for Alzheimer's disease.
METHODS: Cognitive function in 5xFAD mice was evaluated by open field, novel 
object recognition, and Morris water maze tests. Hippocampal and cortical 
Aβ1-40, Aβ1-42 and amyloid plaque deposition were quantified by ELISA and 
immunohistochemistry. RT-qPCR and western blotting quantified the effects of 
duloxetine treatment on L1CAM levels and PI3K/Akt/CREB signaling pathway 
activation. Apoptosis markers Bcl-2 and Bax were also measured by RT-qPCR and 
western blotting. HT22 cell survival was measured by CCK8 assay.
RESULTS: Duloxetine preserved learning and memory abilities, but had no effect 
on locomotor performance of 5xFAD mice. Duloxetine decreased Aβ1-42 expression 
levels, increased Aβ1-40 levels, reduced amyloid plaque formation, and activated 
the PI3K/Akt/CREB signaling pathway in both cortices and hippocampi of 5xFAD 
mice. Moreover, duloxetine increased the expression of L1CAM and Bcl-2, and 
inhibited the expression of Bax, as well as prevented Aβ1-42 cytotoxicity in 
wild-type, but not L1CAM-knockdown HT22 cells, suggesting a feed-forward 
mechanism for duloxetine-mediated neuroprotection, whereby duloxetine induces 
and activates L1CAM to exert neuroprotective effects.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that duloxetine plays a neuroprotective 
role in 5xFAD mice and HT22 cells through activating L1CAM, likely by regulating 
the PI3K/Akt/CREB signaling pathway. These results suggest that duloxetine may 
be a potential reagent for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

Synapse loss driven by amyloid-β (Aβ) is an early event in Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). Although the mechanism by which Aβ drives synapse loss remain poorly 
understood data indicate that a disruption of Wnt signalling plays an important 
part. We have shown that Aβ exerts its effects on synapses through Dickkopf-1 
(Dkk1), a secreted protein that acts upon Wnt signalling via a direct 
interaction with the canonical Wnt pathway co-receptor proteins, LRP5 and LRP6, 
preventing their interaction with the receptor Frizzled. This antagonises 
canonical, Wnt/β-catenin, signalling and allows concomitant activation of 
non-canonical signalling pathways. We contend that it is the switch from 
canonical to non-canonical Wnt signalling activity that drives synapse loss and 
subsequent cognitive impairment in AD, driven by Aβ and mediated by Dkk1. 
Preventing the Dkk1-LRP5/6 interaction could protect synapses and cognition 
against Aβ by maintaining canonical Wnt signalling. To test this, we mapped the 
Dkk1-LRP6 interaction by peptide array and identified a small peptide able to 
disrupt the Dkk1-LRP6 interaction. This Dkk1-LRP6 'disruptor' peptide dose 
dependently restores canonical Wnt signalling in the presence of Dkk1; blocks 
Dkk1-driven dendritic spine loss in primary rat cortical cultures and the 
accompanying increase in endogenous Aβ production; and when administered 
intracerebroventricularly to a rat acute Aβ model, blocks Aβ-driven cognitive 
impairment. These data support our contention that the ability of Aβ to induce 
Dkk1 and the effects of Dkk1 on LRP6 are an important element in AD 
aetiopathology and establish Dkk1 as a therapeutic target for protecting synapse 
and cognition in AD.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the associations between dietary B 
vitamin intakes and the prevalence of cognitive impairment among elderly 
individuals in the United States.
METHODS: This cross-sectional analysis, based on data from 2716 participants 
aged 60 years or older in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
2011 to 2014. Dietary intakes of six B vitamins (vitamins B1, B2, niacin, B6, 
total folate, and B12) were assessed using two 24-hour dietary recalls. 
Cognitive function was evaluated through the Consortium to Establish a Registry 
for Alzheimer's Disease word list learning test, the Animal Fluency Test, and 
the Digit Symbol Substitution Test. Associations between dietary B vitamin 
intakes and cognitive impairment were analyzed using multivariable logistic 
regression, restricted cubic spline regression, and weighted quantile sum 
regression.
RESULTS: Higher dietary intakes of B vitamins were inversely associated with the 
prevalence of cognitive impairment. Participants in the highest quartile of 
intake showed reduced odds of cognitive impairment compared to the lowest 
quartile for vitamin B1 (OR = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.29-0.97), vitamin B2 (OR = 0.54, 
95% CI: 0.29-1.02), niacin (OR = 0.32, 95% CI: 0.15-0.65), vitamin B6 (OR = 
0.45, 95% CI: 0.26-0.79), total folate (OR = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.31-0.89), and 
vitamin B12 (OR = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.25-0.95). Restricted cubic spline analysis 
showed linear and inverse exposure-response relationships for all six vitamins 
without evidence of non-linearity. The weighted quantile sum regression 
indicated a combined protective effect of dietary B vitamins on cognitive 
impairment (OR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.65-0.89), with niacin contributing most to the 
association (weight: 0.48).
CONCLUSIONS: Higher dietary B vitamin intakes may be linked to a lower 
prevalence of cognitive impairment among older adults in the US. These findings 
suggest that adequate consumption of dietary B vitamins may be beneficial for 
maintaining cognitive health. Further, longitudinal studies are needed to 
confirm these associations.

In an increasingly aging world where neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) are 
exponentially rising, research into more effective and innovative treatments 
seems paramount. Bioactive peptides (BPs) emerge as promising compounds with 
revolutionary potential in the treatment of NDs, particularly in well-known 
conditions like Alzheimer's disease (AD). The biological potential of these 
compounds is primarily attributed to their drug development advantages such as 
enhanced penetration, low toxicity, and rapid clearance, as well as, their 
antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties bio-linked to the neuroprotective 
effect, able to attenuate the multifactorial pathologies of AD. BPs can be 
sourced from common dietary origins, like animals, plants, marine, and from 
emerging sources like edible insects. However, to isolate an active BP with 
beneficial biological effects it must first be released from its parent protein, 
followed by a synthesis-flow. While in silico approaches can predict a BP's 
potential bioactivity and structural characteristics, in vitro, cell-based, and 
in vivo assays should be conducted to ensure these properties. The 
blood-brain-barrier (BBB) microenvironment and permeability in health or disease 
state are key factors to consider since they can limit the ability of 
circulating therapeutical agents, including BPs, to reach the brain. This review 
focuses on the bioactivity properties of BPs from different dietary protein 
sources and explores their beneficial effect and neuroprotective activity in AD, 
unraveling new paths of treatment.

BACKGROUND: Sleep disorders are common in people with Huntington's Disease (HD). 
Possible causes include disruptions to the body's internal clock and changes in 
melatonin levels. Although melatonin is known to treat sleep disruptions related 
to circadian rhythm disorders, its effects on HD patients have not been 
thoroughly explored.
OBJECTIVE: to assess the effectiveness of melatonin in improving the sleep 
quality of individuals with HD.
METHODS: double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial with 
individuals with HD experiencing sleep disturbances, defined as Pittsburgh Sleep 
Quality Index (PSQI) > 5. Participants received 4-week treatments with 5 mg 
immediate-release melatonin/placebo, separated by a one-week wash-out 
(NCT04421339). Clinical assessments were conducted at baseline, week 5 
(crossover visit), and week 9 (final visit) and included the PSQI, HD Sleep 
Questionnaire (HD-SQ), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Montreal Cognitive 
Assessment (MoCA), Neuro-QoL™ v2.0 Cognitive Function, Neuropsychiatric 
Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), 
Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS), and Clinical Global Impression 
(CGI).
RESULTS: Fifteen patients (46.53 ± 13.92 years old, seven females) completed the 
study procedures. We found no significant differences between melatonin and 
placebo treatments in the primary outcome (PSQI), other sleep measures (ESS and 
HD-SQ), neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPI-Q, HADS, Neuro-QoL, MoCA), and 
motor/functional measures.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that melatonin did not significantly differ from placebo 
in improving sleep quality in individuals with HD. Given the conflicting 
findings from previous research, it may be beneficial to explore alternative 
dosages of melatonin, increase the sample size, and consider different stages of 
HD in future studies.

OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that leads to 
dementia, but effective treatments are lacking. This study aims to evaluate the 
therapeutic effects of Gegen Qinlian Decoction (GGQLD) on AD and investigate the 
underlying mechanisms.
METHODS: Using network pharmacology and bioinformatics, we identified 376 active 
ingredients of GGQLD and 427 drug targets. Among these, 7 potential targets 
(CASP1, MKI67, NFKB1, TLR4, NLRP3, IL1B, and AKT1) were identified as 
intersecting targets of both GGQLD and AD. Functional enrichment analysis 
revealed that GGQLD regulates pyroptosis-related pathways. In vivo, GGQLD was 
administered to AD rat models to assess its effects on spatial learning, memory, 
and brain tissue injury.
RESULTS: GGQLD significantly reduced latency time by 40 % and increased platform 
crossings by 60 % in AD rats, demonstrating improved spatial learning and memory 
abilities. It also reduced hippocampal tissue damage and abnormal Aβ deposition. 
Mechanistically, GGQLD downregulated pyroptosis-related targets (TLR4, NF-κB, 
NLRP3, IL-1β, and Caspase-1), which were significantly upregulated in AD. ROC 
analysis demonstrated strong diagnostic significance for these genes, with AUC 
values exceeding 0.70. Functional enrichment and KEGG analysis further indicated 
that GGQLD exerts its therapeutic effects through multiple pathways, 
particularly the NOD-like receptor pathway, Necroptosis, and NF-kappa B pathway.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that GGQLD improves spatial learning, 
reduces brain tissue damage, and alleviates inflammation in AD through the 
regulation of pyroptosis-related pathways, providing evidence for its potential 
as a therapeutic agent for AD.

Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) have two types of abnormal protein 
buildups: amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, in addition to the early 
synaptic dysfunction associated with the enzymes acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and 
butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE). Impairment of the glutamatergic system is also 
crucial for neuronal survival, as it can cause synaptic dysfunction that 
overstimulates glutamate receptors, especially N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors 
(NMDARs). Another protein affecting neuronal health is glycogen synthase 
kinase-3 (GSK3), a widely preserved serine/threonine protein kinase linked to 
neuronal disorders, including AD. In recent years, alkaloids from the 
Amaryllidaceae have received great attention for their known anticholinergic 
activity, as well as their antioxidant, antigenotoxic, and neuroprotective 
properties. In this context, the identification of compounds capable of 
interacting with different targets involved in AD provides a possible new 
therapeutic strategy. In this study, we conducted a combination of in vitro and 
in silico approaches to identify the potential of C. subedentata in regulating 
key proteins involved in AD. Viability and neuroprotection assays were performed 
to evaluate the neuroprotection exerted by C. subedentata extract against 
neurotoxicity induced by Aβ (1-42) peptide and Okadaic acid in SH-SY5Y cells. 
Computational methods such as docking and molecular dynamic and viability 
therapeutic analysis were conducted to explore the interaction of alkaloids from 
C. subedentata with target proteins (AChE, BuChE, NMDA, and GSK-3) involved in 
AD. Our findings show that C. subedentata extract exerts neuroprotective effects 
against neurotoxic stimuli induced by Aβ (1-42) peptide and Okadaic acid. In 
addition, in silico approaches provide insight into how C. subedentata extract 
alkaloids interact with key proteins involved in AD. These findings provide 
insights into the potential therapeutic effects and action mechanisms of these 
alkaloids. We hope these rapid findings can contribute as a bridge to the 
identification of new molecules with the potential to counteract the effects of 
AD.

Middle-aged adults who are parents have better average cognitive performance and 
lower average brain age compared with middle-aged adults without children, 
raising the possibility that caregiving slows brain aging. Here, we investigate 
this hypothesis in two additional groups of caregivers: grandmothers and 
caregivers for people living with dementia (PLWD). Demographic, questionnaire, 
and structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data were acquired from n = 50 
grandmothers, n = 24 caregivers of PLWD, and n = 37 non-caregiver controls, and 
BrainAGE was estimated. BrainAGE estimation results suggest that after 
controlling for relevant covariates, grandmothers had a brain age that was 
5.5 years younger than non-grandmother controls, and caregivers of PLWD had 
brains that were 4.7 years younger than non-caregiver controls. Women who became 
grandmothers at a later age had lower brain age than those who became 
grandmothers at an earlier age. Among caregivers of PLWD, stress and caregiving 
burden were associated with increased brain age, such that the beneficial effect 
of caregiving on brain age was reduced in caregivers reporting more burden. Our 
findings suggest that caring for dependents may slow brain aging.

Multiple lines of evidence indicate that immune signaling can impact the 
pathological progression in Alzheimer's disease (AD), including amyloid 
deposition, tau aggregation, synaptic pathology and neurodegenerative 
trajectory. In earlier studies, we reported that intracerebral expression of the 
anti-inflammatory cytokines, Interleukin-10 (Il10) and Interleukin-4 (Il4), 
increased amyloid β (Aβ) burden in TgCRND8 mice, a preclinical model of AD-type 
amyloidosis. As both Interleukin-10 receptor (IL10R) and Interleukin-4 receptor 
(IL4R) are upregulated in an age-progressive manner in rodent models of AD and 
in specific regions of human AD brains, we hypothesized that a decoy receptor 
strategy specifically targeting Il10 and Il4 signaling could have a 
disease-modifying effect. We derivatized the ectodomains of mouse Il10R (sIl10R) 
and mouse Il4R (sIl4R) into corresponding recombinant solubilized receptor forms 
and delivered these intracranially into neonatal TgCRND8 mice or hippocampally 
into adult TgCRND8 mice with pre-existing Aβ deposits. AAV-mediated expression 
of sIl10R and sIl4R robustly attenuated Aβ burden in TgCRND8 mice when expressed 
neonatally while in the hippocampus injection cohort, AAV-sIl4R, but not sIl10R, 
reduced Aβ burden. sIl10R and sIl4R had opposing effects on microglial and 
astrocyte proliferation, with sIl10R generally reducing gliosis. RNAseq analysis 
showed that sIl10R likely acts as a microglial immune checkpoint inhibitor while 
both sIl10R and sIl4R expression show unexpected impacts on genes related to 
circadian rhythm. Notably, neither Il10 nor sIl10R expression altered tau 
pathology in two tau transgenic models, despite robust expression and impacts on 
glial proliferation. Together, these data reveal that decoy receptor mediated 
targeting of physiological Il10 or Il4 signaling can beneficially impact amyloid 
deposition and thus represent novel immunomodulatory approaches for AD therapy.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by neurodegeneration, nerve loss, neurofibrillary tangles and Aβ 
plaques. Different process of the AD pathology present more opportunities for 
treatment. In addition, the holistic approaches involving network pharmacology 
with traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) may be viable options for AD treatment, 
and lead to an effective cure for AD in the future. Therefore, this study 
explored the therapeutic effect and mechanism of Rosmarinus officinalis 
L(rosemary) in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease on basis of cell 
experiments, network pharmacology and molecular docking.
METHODS: We performed cell experiments, to investigate the therapeutic effects 
of Rosmarinus officinalis L on AD in vitro using CCK8 assay, flow cytometry and 
TMRE Kit. In addition, carnosic acid is a major antioxidant diterpenoid in 
Rosmarinus officinalis L. We performed cell experiments, to investigate the 
neuroprotective effects of carnosic acid on AD in virto using CCK8 assay and 
flow cytometry. Furthermore, the main antioxidant compounds of rosemary ware 
collected through literature reviews, PharmMapper and Swiss Target prediction 
ware used to identify their potential targets. Targets of AD were obtained from 
Genecards and OMIM. The intersection targets of the main active components of 
rosemary and the therapeutic targets of Alzheimer's disease were subsequently 
obtained by using online Venn diagram. Protein-protein interaction, Cytoscape, 
Gene Ontology, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes were used to analyze potential 
targets and key pathways of rosemary in AD. Besides, through molecular docking, 
the interactions of the main active components of rosemary, and the predicted 
candidate targets were verified. Finally, quantitative Real-Time PCR (RT-qPCR) 
was performed to confirm the effectiveness of the genes.
RESULTS: It was found that rosemary could reversed Aβ25-35 induced damage to 
mouse hippocampal neuron HT22 cells, significantly improved the viability of 
damaged cells, and reduced apoptosis. The results of fluorescent staining with 
Hoechst 33,342 and TMRE suggested that rosemary inhibited the reduction of 
mitochondrial membrane potential levels induced by Aβ25-35, which had a specific 
protective effect on AD in vitro. Additionally, a main antioxidant compound in 
rosemary, carnosic acid, also has neuroprotective effects. Eight main 
antioxidant compounds of rosemary ware collected. Network pharmacology and 
molecular docking, revealed that rosemary plays a therapeutic role in the 
treatment of Alzheimer's disease through the main active carnosic acid, 
carnosol, rosmarinol, rosmadial, genkwanin, cirsimaritin, rosmarinic acid and 
caffeic acid in Rosmarinus officinalis L, which affects the gene regulation of 
HRAS, ESR1, RHOA, IGF1, SRC, ANXA5, MMP9, MAPK14, NOS3, and PIK3R1, and 
participates in the PI3K-Akt, Rap1, MAPK, and estrogen signaling pathways. 
RT-qPCR indicated that rosemary could elevated expression of IGF1, MMP9 and 
decreased mRNA levels of SRC, MAPK14, compared with the control group.
CONCLUSIONS: Rosemary is an important economic plant with 
multi-component, multi-target and multi-pathway synergistic effects.The findings 
highlight the effectiveness of rosemary in helping to increase cell viability 
and reduce apoptosis when treating mouse hippocampal neuron HT22 cells, thereby 
supporting its therapeutic potential in treating Alzheimer's disease.

GRIK1 has been identified to suppress the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. The 
present study investigated the damaging effect of GRIK1 on Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), the most common neurodegenerative disease, by focusing on inflammasome. 
APP-PS1 mice were subjected to a Y-maze test and a Morris water maze test. 
APP-PS1 mice with GRIK1 knockdown were constructed using adeno-associated virus, 
and the effects of GRIK1 knockdown on the NLRP3 inflammasome activation in 
microglia of brain tissues of APP-PS1 mice were analyzed. Mouse primary 
microglia BV2 was induced by LPS, and Western blot, flow cytometry, and ELISA 
were performed. GRIK1 was significantly elevated in the brain tissues of APP-PS1 
mice. GRIK1 knockdown inhibited the neuronal damage and NLRP3 neuroinflammation 
in the brain tissues and improved cognitive dysfunction of APP-PS1 mice. 
Knockdown of GRIK1 inhibited activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in BV2 cells. SP3 
was upregulated in the brain tissues of APP-PS1 mice, and SP3 promoted GRIK1 
transcription by binding to its promoter. Overexpression of GRIK1 reversed the 
mitigating effect of knockdown of SP3 on cognitive dysfunction and NLRP3 
activation in APP-PS1 mice. Overall, our results revealed that SP3-induced GRIK1 
transcription potentiates NLRP3 inflammasome activation in microglia, leading to 
cognitive dysfunction in AD.

Clemastine, a first-generation antihistamine traditionally used for treating 
allergic rhinitis and urticaria, has recently gathered interest due to its 
potential therapeutic applications beyond its antihistaminergic properties. This 
review examines recent patent filings (2015-2024) to elucidate the emerging 
therapeutic landscape for this compound. The analysis reveals various potential 
applications, including neurodegenerative disorders, cardiovascular diseases, 
and cancer treatment. Specifically, several studies focus on its ability to 
promote remyelination in multiple sclerosis and other demyelinating disorders, 
highlighting its potential neuroprotective effects. Recent findings suggest its 
efficacy in treating heart failure and arrhythmias, possibly through its action 
on cardiac ion channels. In oncology, patents propose this compound as an 
adjuvant therapy to enhance the efficacy of existing treatments and potentially 
overcome drug resistance. This review also explores combination therapies 
involving this drug, which aim to synergize its effects with other active 
compounds. The patent literature indicates a significant change in the 
therapeutic potential of ethanolamine derivatives, from a simple antihistamine 
to a multifaceted drug candidate with far-reaching implications across various 
medical fields. These developments emphasize the importance of repurposing 
existing drugs and highlight Clemastine as a promising candidate for further 
clinical investigation in multiple therapeutic areas.

BACKGROUND: Dietary factors play a major role in cognitive aging, but few 
studies have assessed and compared the associations between specific dietary 
patterns and Alzheimer's disease (AD) mortality.
METHODS: We included 27,773 U.S. participants (mean age = 59.8 years, 51.4 % 
female) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 
between 1998 and 2016, with follow-up for AD mortality until December 2019. Five 
dietary pattern scores were calculated utilizing one (1999-2002) or two repeated 
(2003-2016) 24hr dietary recalls, including the Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2015), 
the healthful plant-based diet index (hPDI), the alternate Mediterranean diet 
(aMED), the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension diet (DASH), and the 
Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegeneration Delay diet (MIND) scores. 
We utilized Cox proportional hazard models to evaluate the associations of these 
dietary pattern scores with AD mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 260 AD deaths occurred during a median follow-up of 9.8 
years. Higher aMED score was associated with a lower risk of AD mortality 
(HRT3vs T1: 0.72, 95 % CI, 0.52-1.00, p-trend = 0.041). In a sub-sample of 2,713 
participants in NHANES 2011-2014, 432 individuals had prevalent psychometric 
mild cognitive impairment (p-MCI). Higher aMED, MIND, HEI-2015, and hPDI were 
associated with lower odds of p-MCI. The potential contributors to these 
associations included higher intake levels of vegetables and nuts, moderate 
alcohol consumption, and lower intake level of sweets.
CONCLUSIONS: The Mediterranean dietary pattern was associated with more 
favorable cognitive outcomes among middle-aged and older adults, underscoring 
the importance of a healthy diet for long-term benefits in cognitive and brain 
health.
