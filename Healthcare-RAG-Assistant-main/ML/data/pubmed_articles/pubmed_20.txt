Although increasingly used for research, electronic health records (EHR) often 
lack a gold-standard assessment of key data elements. Linking EHRs to other data 
sources with higher-quality measurements can improve statistical inference, but 
such analyses must account for selection bias if the linked data source arises 
from a non-probability sample. We propose a set of novel estimators targeting 
the average treatment effect (ATE) that combine information from binary outcomes 
measured with error in a large, population-representative EHR database with 
gold-standard outcomes obtained from a smaller validation sample subject to 
selection bias. We evaluate our approach in extensive simulations and an 
analysis of data from the Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) study, a longitudinal 
study of incident dementia in a cohort of Kaiser Permanente Washington members 
with linked EHR data. For a subset of deceased ACT participants who consented to 
brain autopsy prior to death, gold-standard measures of Alzheimer's disease 
neuropathology are available. Our proposed estimators reduced bias and improved 
efficiency for the ATE, facilitating valid inference with EHR data when key data 
elements are ascertained with error.

BACKGROUND: Bidirectional communication and mutual regulation between the 
gastrointestinal tract and the CNS is facilitated through the gut-brain axis. 
Recent studies have found reduced diversity of the gut microbiota in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) patients, and animal models suggest microbial involvement in 
amyloid beta peptide (Aβ) accumulation. Modulation of the gut microbiota by 
new-generation probiotics represents a novel treatment strategy to alleviate the 
symptoms and slow the progression of AD.
METHODS: In this study, the therapeutic effect of the probiotic Akkermansia 
muciniphila and the prebiotic galactooligosaccharides (GOS) was investigated in 
the APP/PS1 mouse model. After 7 months of triweekly administration, we 
evaluated physiological parameters, glucose metabolism, and behavioral outcomes. 
Additionally, we assessed gut microbiota diversity and composition, short-chain 
fatty acid (SCFA) concentrations in the cecum, Aβ load in the hippocampus and 
prefrontal cortex, and microglial abundance in the hippocampus.
RESULTS: A. muciniphila and GOS administration normalized fasting glucose 
levels, glucose metabolism, and intestinal transit time to wild-type levels. 
Furthermore, supplementation reduced anxiety, improved long-and short-term 
memory, and partially restored activity levels. It also regulated SCFA 
concentrations in the cecum, improved the richness of the gut microbiota, and 
normalized abundance of microglia in the hippocampus, indicating reduced 
neuroinflammation.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that long-term administration of A. 
muciniphila and GOS effectively improves metabolic health and modulates symptoms 
of AD in the APP/PS1 mouse model.

AD pathology is accompanied by increased senescence and reduced levels of 
autophagy in the brain. We investigated whether pharmacologically inducing 
autophagy could alter the senescent phenotype and help ameliorate AD pathology. 
We discovered that Bisdemethoxycurcumin (BDMC), a natural compound found in 
Curcuma longa, stimulates autophagy in primary astrocytes. We found that 
autophagy and senescence exhibit an inverse relationship in aging astrocytes, 
with increased expression of senescent proteins and downregulation of autophagic 
proteins. However, treatment of aged astrocytes with BDMC reversed the senescent 
phenotype by ameliorating the impaired autophagy. Interestingly, the senescent 
phenotype persisted when autophagy was downregulated by knockdown of AMPK. 
Additionally, BDMC-induced autophagy aided in the removal of amyloid beta that 
was administered externally to the astrocytes. Further, to validate these 
results in a mouse model of AD, we confirmed that BDMC can significantly 
penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in mice. Therefore, we administered 50 
and 100 mg/kg b.w. of BDMC to transgenic 3xTg-AD mice for two months. In their 
hippocampus, the Control 3xTg-AD animals showed more senescent cells and lower 
autophagy levels. In contrast, autophagic proteins were significantly 
upregulated while senescence indicators, such as senescence-associated secretory 
phenotype (SASP) proteins, were sharply downregulated in the brain of treated 
animals. Additionally, we discovered that the treated mice's hippocampus had a 
significantly lower amyloid beta load. These molecular changes in the brain were 
ultimately reflected in the improved working memory and neuromuscular 
coordination behavior of mice treated with BDMC. This study warrants further 
evaluation of BDMC for the management of AD.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening form of acute 
lung injury (ALI), which is a common cause of respiratory failure and high 
mortality in critically ill patients. Long-term mortality and brain dysfunction 
have been documented in ARDS patients after hospital discharge. Inflammation 
plays a key role in ALI/ARDS pathogenesis. Neural cholinergic signaling 
regulates cytokine responses and inflammation. Here, we studied the effects of 
galantamine, an approved cholinergic drug (for Alzheimer's disease) on ALI/ARDS 
severity and inflammation in mice, using a clinically relevant mouse model 
induced by intratracheal administration of hydrochloric acid and 
lipopolysaccharide. Mice were treated 30 mins prior to each insult with vehicle 
or galantamine (4 mg/kg, i.p.). Galantamine treatment significantly decreased 
bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and serum TNF, IL-1β, and IL-6 levels, as well as 
BAL total protein and myeloperoxidase and lung histopathology in ALI/ARDS mice. 
In addition, galantamine improved the functional state of mice with ALI/ARDS 
during a 10-day monitoring and attenuated lung injury and indices of brain 
inflammation at 10 days. These findings support further studies utilizing this 
approved cholinergic drug in therapeutic strategies for ARDS and its subacute 
sequelae.

Aging is the strongest risk factor for cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), yet the mechanisms underlying brain aging and their modulation by 
pharmacological interventions remain poorly defined. The hippocampus, essential 
for learning and memory, is particularly vulnerable to metabolic stress and 
inflammation. Canagliflozin (Cana), an FDA-approved sodium-glucose 
co-transporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) for type 2 diabetes, extends lifespan in 
male but not female mice, but its impact on brain aging is unknown. Here, we 
used a multi-omics strategy integrating transcriptomics, proteomics, and 
metabolomics to investigate how chronic Cana treatment reprograms brain aging in 
genetically diverse UM-HET3 mice. In males, Cana induced mitochondrial function, 
insulin and cGMP-PKG signaling, and suppressed neuroinflammatory networks across 
all molecular layers, resulting in improved hippocampal-dependent learning and 
memory. In females, transcriptional activation of neuroprotective pathways did 
not translate to protein or metabolite-level changes and failed to rescue 
cognition. In the 5xFAD AD model, Cana reduced amyloid plaque burden, 
microgliosis, and memory deficits in males only, despite comparable peripheral 
glucose improvements in both sexes. Our study reveals sex-specific remodeling of 
hippocampal aging by a clinically available SGLT2i, with implications for AD 
pathology and lifespan extension, and highlights Cana's potential to combat 
brain aging and AD through sex-specific mechanisms.

BACKGROUND: Women face a significantly higher lifetime risk of developing 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) than men. This disparity is often attributed to longer 
female longevity, but growing evidence suggests a multifactorial origin, 
including hormonal, vascular, and immunologic contributions. Estrogen plays a 
critical neuroprotective role across multiple systems implicated in AD 
pathogenesis, including synaptic plasticity, mitochondrial function, and 
cerebrovascular integrity. However, clinical trials investigating hormone 
therapy (HT) for AD prevention have yielded mixed results, in part due to 
variability in study populations, timing of intervention, and formulation of 
hormones.
AIMS/METHODS: This review examines the biological rationale for estrogen's role 
in cognitive aging, synthesizes clinical and translational data on hormone 
therapy and AD risk, and highlights the importance of vascular comorbidity, 
including cerebral small vessel disease, in mediating AD pathology.
CONCLUSION: We propose that estrogen's neuroprotective potential may be best 
realized in personalized treatment frameworks that account for age, timing, APOE 
genotype, and vascular burden. Interpretation of estrogen's role in AD is 
further complicated by variability in diagnostic criteria, which may contribute 
to conflicting findings across studies. Recognition of menopause-related 
cognitive impairment as an early, hormonally modulated risk state may offer 
additional opportunity for timely intervention. Addressing this complexity is 
essential to refining AD prevention strategies in midlife women.

Department, Garching, Germany.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been the standard for computer vision 
tasks and are frequently applied in medical conditions, such as in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). Recently, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have been introduced, which 
provide a strong alternative to CNNs by discarding the convolution approach in 
favor of the attention mechanism. This allows modeling global and distant 
relationships within distinct parts of an image without relying on the strong 
inductive biases present in CNNs. A common precursor stage of AD is a syndrome 
called mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, not all individuals diagnosed 
with MCI progress to AD. The establishment of reliable classification models 
that predict converters versus non-converters would be a valuable tool to 
support clinical decision-making, such as enabling early treatment. Hence, in 
this investigation a transfer learning approach was used by applying a 
pretrained ViT model, fine-tuned on the ADNI dataset comprising 575 subjects 
with MCI. We included baseline T1-weighted structural MRI data from 299 stable 
MCI and 276 progressive MCI individuals, who developed Alzheimer's disease 
within 36 months. Inputs to the model were three normalized axial slices 
covering areas of the hippocampal region, consisting of the combined gray and 
white matter segmentations. The final model was evaluated over multiple runs to 
obtain stable performance estimates, yielding an average area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) on the test set of 0.74 ± 0.02 (mean ± 
SD), an accuracy of 0.69 ± 0.03, a sensitivity of 0.65 ± 0.07, a specificity of 
0.72 ± 0.06, and a F1-score for the pMCI class of 0.67 ± 0.04. By specifically 
focusing on axial slices covering the hippocampal region, we aimed to target the 
brain structure often reported as being the first affected by the disease, while 
our results indicate that a ViT approach achieves reasonable classification 
accuracy for predicting the conversion from MCI to AD.

IMPORTANCE: Antidepressants are recommended as the initial choice of treatment 
for moderate and severe depression, but the choice of antidepressant class can 
be challenging, with the possibility of serious adverse events such as increased 
suicidality with antidepressant initiation.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the utility of polygenic scores in predicting 
heterogeneous effects of antidepressants on suicidal thoughts.
DESIGN: Using genetic and clinical data on both children and adults with major 
depressive disorder from the All of Us Research Program, we used a target trial 
emulation framework to evaluate the heterogeneous effects of antidepressants on 
suicidal thoughts across genetic characteristics.
SETTING: Longitudinal cohort from the All of Us Research Program.
PARTICIPANTS: More than 7,000 patients, both children and adults, with major 
depressive disorder.
INTERVENTIONS: The initiation of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors 
(SSRIs), compared to the initiation of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake 
inhibitors (SNRIs) and bupropion.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The effects of antidepressants on suicidal thoughts, 
as well as subgroup effects across polygenic scores (PGSs) of various 
psychiatric disorders.
RESULTS: Patients with higher PGS for psychiatric disorders, particularly for 
attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), were more likely than those 
with lower scores to experience suicidal thoughts with the initiation of SSRIs, 
relative to bupropion (hazard ratio 1.66, 95%CI, 1.30-2.12, for participants 
with ADHD PGS higher than median vs. hazard ratio 1.06, 95%CI, 0.81-1.38, for 
participants with ADHD PGS lower than median; P-for-interaction, 0.01). We 
observed a similar trend for schizophrenia, although the interaction was not 
statistically significant (hazard ratio 1.52, 95%CI, 1.19-1.93, for participants 
with schizophrenia PGS higher than median vs. hazard ratio 1.1.17, 95%CI, 
0.89-1.53, for participants with ADHD PGS lower than median; P-for-interaction, 
0.16). We did not observe differences in the effects of SSRIs relative to SNRIs 
across PGSs.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The genetic predisposition to psychiatric disorders 
may, at least partially, underlie the heterogeneity in the risk of suicidal 
thoughts with antidepressant use. In the personalized medicine framework, PGSs 
for various psychiatric disorders may help tailor antidepressants to each 
patient to avoid serious adverse effects such as suicidal thoughts.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, while the 
existing treatments primarily focus on alleviating symptoms rather than 
addressing the underlying pathophysiology. Seeking a safer alternative, the 
study explores the potential of Piper chaba Hunter as a promising drug lead for 
AD by eliciting the major signaling pathway, key players, and their interaction 
with phytochemicals from the plant extract. Initially, the phytochemicals in the 
P. chaba crude extract were identified using GC-MS, and their physicochemical 
properties were verified using SwissADME. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) and 
signaling pathways-target proteins-compounds (STC) networks were analyzed to dig 
out target proteins and effective compounds for AD based on rigorous screening. 
Approximately 60 target proteins that interacted with GC-MS-identified compounds 
underwent PPI and STC networking which identified five compounds, a signaling 
pathway, and three target proteins with therapeutic potential. Three compounds, 
namely, bicyclo[7.2.0]undec-4-ene, 
4,11,11-trimethyl-8-methylene-,[1R-(1R∗,4Z,9S∗)], 2-methoxybenzoic acid, 
2,3-dichlorophenyl ester, and 
(E)-3-butylidene-4,5-dihydroisobenzofuran-1(3H)-one, have the potential to 
modulate PTGS2, PLA2G4A, and CYP2C19 within metabolic signaling pathway, thus 
serving as promising therapeutic agents. Moreover, the drug likeliness and 
efficacy of those phytochemicals were justified by molecular docking tests 
(MDTs), molecular dynamics simulations (MDSs), and quantum chemistry analyses, 
which confirmed their ability to inhibit key targets to mitigate AD-associated 
pathology.

This review explores the potential of Traditional, Complementary, and 
Integrative Medicine (TCIM) as an adjunct to conventional therapies for 
Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Unlike pharmaceutical treatments that primarily offer 
symptomatic relief, TCIM encompasses holistic approaches that target multiple 
pathophysiological pathways involved in AD, including tau pathology, oxidative 
stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation. Herbal therapies such 
as Withania somnifera, Ginkgo biloba, and Curcuma longa have shown promising 
neuroprotective effects in preclinical and limited clinical studies. Mind-body 
practices like Kirtan Kriya meditation have also demonstrated stress-reduction 
benefits, addressing modifiable risk factors for AD. While current evidence 
highlights the potential of TCIM interventions to complement standard care, 
rigorous validation through high-quality randomized controlled trials remains 
essential. This review underscores the need for integrative, personalized 
approaches that synergize traditional and modern medical systems to enhance 
therapeutic outcomes in AD.

BACKGROUND: First held in 2020, the Institute on Methods and Protocols for 
Advancement of Clinical Trials in ADRD (IMPACT-AD) is a program to train the 
next generation of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (AD/ADRD) 
clinical trialists.
METHODS: IMPACT-AD includes didactic, workshop, and small group components.
RESULTS: IMPACT-AD has trained 18 alumni-scholars (accepted from 424 
applicants), of whom 67% were female. Forty-eight (26%) were the first in their 
family to attend college. Scholars included individuals from all racial and 
ethnic groups. Each year, participants demonstrated increased learning about 
AD/ADRD clinical trials through a pre/post-test model of knowledge assessments. 
Among those completing annual follow-up surveys, >84% remain in AD/ADRD trials 
careers, and 80% have experienced career advances or milestones. In the latter 
group, > 90% indicated that participating in IMPACT-AD contributed to this 
career growth.
DISCUSSION: IMPACT-AD is a novel educational program that is achieving its 
goals.
HIGHLIGHTS: Over 5 years, the Institute on Methods and Protocols for Advancement 
of Clinical Trials in ADRD (IMPACT-AD) has trained 188 scholars. The course has 
been accessible to a broad range of trainees who were diverse in professional 
and demographic backgrounds. Objective assessments indicate that participants 
gain knowledge through participation. Eighty-four percent of trainees have 
remained in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) trials careers. 
Eighty percent of alumni have experienced career advances; nearly all indicated 
that participating in the course contributed to their success.

INTRODUCTION: Monoclonal anti-amyloid therapies are now accessible, but how 
these treatments influence changes within the brain is still not clear. We 
investigated overall and regional change in amyloid removal, glucose metabolism, 
and atrophy in trial participants with dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease 
(DIAD).
METHODS: In the DIAN-TU-001 trial, 92 carriers received gantenerumab or placebo 
and underwent serial neuroimaging assessments including [11C]-Pittsburgh 
compound-B (PiB) positron emission tomography (PET), [18F]-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose 
(FDG) PET, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
RESULTS: Gantenerumab significantly reduced PiB-PET uptake overall and in most 
regions and showed no changes in FDG-PET or MRI measures. Drug effects were 
associated with baseline PiB-PET uptake, and the largest effects occurred in 
medial regions.
DISCUSSION: Treated DIAD participants, and especially those with higher amyloid 
burden, showed a decrease in PiB-PET uptake, which was more pronounced in the 
basal ganglia and medial frontal structures. These results may inform patient 
response and future drug trial design.
HIGHLIGHTS: Gantenerumab unevenly decreased Aβ burden as measured by PiB-PET 
across brain regions. The strongest decrease in PiB-PET uptake was in basal 
ganglia and medial frontal structures. Variable drug effect on Aβ was partly due 
to the amount of burden present before treatment. There was no regional effect 
on FDG-PET metabolism or MRI volumetrics after 4 years.

INTRODUCTION: Irisin is a glycosylated polypeptide hormone derived from muscles 
that plays a crucial role in learning and memory by promoting the growth of 
hippocampal neurons, thereby influencing cognitive function.
OBJECTIVE: Despite increasing evidence, a comprehensive understanding of the 
exact role of irisin remains elusive, necessitating further research to unravel 
the complex mechanisms through which irisin influences cognitive function and to 
explore therapeutic approaches targeting irisin.
METHOD: A literature review was performed by searching PubMed for articles 
published between 2012 and 2024, using the keywords ‘fibronectin type III 
domain-containing 5 (FNDC5)’, ‘irisin’, ‘cognitive impairment’, ‘Alzheimer’s 
disease’, ‘Age-related cognitive dysfunction’ and ‘Diabetes-associated cognitive 
dysfunction’, combined with Boolean operators (AND/OR).
RESULTS: This review highlighted the potential impact of irisin on cognitive 
function in the context of ageing, diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease. The 
anti-cognitive impairment effects of irisin are associated with the regulation 
of energy metabolism, insulin resistance, inflammation, oxidative stress, 
amyloid-beta deposition, synaptogenesis and plasticity. The signalling pathways 
through which irisin improves cognitive impairment are complex and highly 
regulated processes, involving multiple signalling pathways such as the 
adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signalling pathway, 
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway, nuclear factor-κB 
(NF-κB) signalling pathway, ERK-STAT3 signalling pathway, cAMP/PKA/CREB 
signalling pathway and Nrf2/HO-1 signalling pathway.
CONCLUSION: This review delves into the positive effects of irisin on cognitive 
impairment, examines the signalling pathways related to fibronectin type III 
domain-containing 5 (FNDC5)/irisin and provides future perspectives for research 
on the anti-cognitive impairment effects of irisin.

The increase in life expectancy has caused a rise in age-related brain 
disorders. Although brain rejuvenation is a promising strategy to counteract 
brain functional decline, systematic discovery methods for efficient 
interventions are lacking. A computational platform based on a transcriptional 
brain aging clock capable of detecting age- and neurodegeneration-related 
changes is developed. Applied to neurodegeneration-positive samples, it reveals 
that neurodegenerative disease presence and severity significantly increase 
predicted age. By screening 43840 transcriptional profiles of chemical and 
genetic perturbations, it identifies 453 unique rejuvenating interventions, 
several of which are known to extend lifespan in animal models. Additionally, 
the identified interventions include drugs already used to treat neurological 
disorders, Alzheimer's disease among them. A combination of compounds predicted 
by the platform reduced anxiety, improved memory, and rejuvenated the brain 
cortex transcriptome in aged mice. These results demonstrate the platform's 
ability to identify brain-rejuvenating interventions, offering potential 
treatments for neurodegenerative diseases.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The abnormal accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) in the brain 
is a characteristic pathological change observed in patients with Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). Microglial phagocytosis, dependent on recycling through the 
retromer complex and cell membrane-bound receptors, plays a vital role in 
clearing Aβ from the brain. Previous studies have demonstrated the neurotrophic 
and neuroprotective effects of Scorpion Venom Heat-Resistant Synthetic Peptide 
(SVHRSP); however, its impacts on cognitive function remain unclear. The present 
study aims to investigate the impact of SVHRSP on cognitive function in APP/PS1 
transgenic mice and underlying mechanisms associated with microglial retromer 
complex.
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: SVHRSP and 3-methyladenine (3-MA) were intraperitoneally 
injected at 7.5 months to investigate their effects on cognitive dysfunction in 
APP/PS1 mice. Following behavioural testing, brain samples were harvested 24 h 
later for electrophysiological recordings, analysis of protein and gene 
expression, and histological assessment. The role of microglial retromer complex 
was examined using primary microglia cultures.
KEY RESULTS: SVHRSP treatment effectively improved AD-related pathological 
features, including cognitive impairment, neuronal loss, impaired synaptic 
plasticity, neuroinflammation, and Aβ deposition in APP/PS1 mice. Both in vivo 
and in vitro studies revealed that SVHRSP treatment increased expression of 
retromer complex protein VPS35. 3-MA, a specific class III phosphoinositide 
3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor that prevents autophagosome formation, reduced 
retromer complex protein expression and hindered the cognitive function 
improvements of SVHRSP.
CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Our findings suggest that SVHRSP may enhance 
microglial phagocytosis by modulating retromer complex activity, thereby 
alleviating Aβ accumulation and improving cognitive dysfunction in AD.

Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role in the pathogenesis of 
neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's 
disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis 
(ALS). Targeted drug delivery to mitochondria represents a promising therapeutic 
strategy to mitigate neuronal degeneration and preserve mitochondrial function 
in these devastating conditions. This review provides a comprehensive overview 
of recent advances in targeted drug delivery solutions for mitochondrial 
dysfunction in neurodegenerative disorders. The mechanisms underlying 
mitochondrial dysfunction in AD, PD, HD, and ALS are explored, highlighting the 
specific challenges and opportunities for therapeutic intervention. Emerging 
drug delivery technologies are discussed, including mitochondriaresponsive 
systems, nanoparticles, peptides, and viral vectors, designed to deliver 
therapeutic agents directly to mitochondria along with suitable case studies. 
Furthermore, preclinical and clinical studies evaluating the efficacy and safety 
of mitochondria-targeted therapeutics are reviewed, and future directions and 
challenges in the field are outlined. By elucidating the intersection of 
mitochondrial biology and drug delivery, this review aims to inspire further 
research and innovation toward effective treatments for neurodegenerative 
diseases.

BACKGROUND: Effective treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD) are limited, so 
preventing or delaying its onset is crucial. Previous clinical trials have shown 
the safety and potential efficacy of the Chinese herbal formula Guilingji (GLJ), 
but its preventive effect on AD and mechanism are still unclear.
METHODS: In this study, a network pharmacology approach was employed to 
elucidate the mechanism of GLJ in AD. Behavioral assessments and biochemical 
experiments were conducted on APPswe/PS1ΔE9 transgenic (APP/PS1) mice. The 
pivotal pathways and biological processes were validated in vitro AD model using 
HT22 and BV-2 cells stimulated by Aβ1-42. Additionally, molecular docking was 
utilized to illustrate the binding affinity of GLJ's active components to key 
genes implicated in AD prevention.
RESULTS: Network pharmacology analysis identified 482 common targets associated 
with the active components of GLJ. KEGG enrichment analysis highlighted the 
PI3K-AKT and retrograde endocannabinoid signaling pathways as the key 
mechanisms. GLJ significantly postponed cognitive decline, suppressed Aβ plaque 
accumulation, mitigated neuronal damage, and reduced inflammatory responses in 
glial cells in AD mice. GLJ and its compounds quercetin and carvone assist in 
neuron survival by regulating the PI3K/AKT pathway and the apoptotic proteins 
Bcl-2 and Bax. Additionally, GLJ, kaempferol and stigmasterol enhance microglial 
clearance of Aβ through the CB2 receptor. Moreover, molecular docking suggested 
that quercetin and carvone interacted effectively with PI3K, while kaempferol 
and stigmasterol combined well with CB2.
CONCLUSIONS: GLJ effectively delays AD progression by modulating critical 
pathological pathways such as neuronal survival, neuroinflammation, and Aβ 
clearance through a synergistic multi-target approach, offering a promising 
avenue for AD prevention.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents the most prevalent neurodegenerative 
disorder and leading cause of dementia worldwide, with its incidence rising 
dramatically in aging populations. This progressive disease is 
neuropathologically characterized by extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, 
intracellular neurofibrillary tau tangles, and chronic neuroinflammation, 
leading to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal loss. Despite extensive research 
efforts, the complex and multifactorial nature of AD pathogenesis has prevented 
the development of truly disease-modifying therapies. Current therapeutic 
approaches, including recently approved anti-amyloid immunotherapies, 
demonstrate limited clinical efficacy and significant adverse effects, 
highlighting the need for alternative treatment strategies. This comprehensive 
review systematically evaluates recent advances in understanding AD 
pathophysiology, emphasizing the interplay between genetic risk factors 
(particularly APOE ε4), proteostasis imbalance, metabolic dysfunction, and 
neurovascular contributions. We critically analyze emerging diagnostic 
biomarkers, including novel neuroimaging techniques and cerebrospinal 
fluid/blood-based biomarkers, that enable earlier and more accurate detection. 
The review provides an in-depth assessment of both pharmacological interventions 
(such as tau-targeting therapies, anti-inflammatory agents, and neurotransmitter 
modulators) and non-pharmacological approaches (including lifestyle 
modifications and cognitive training). Special attention is given to 
personalized medicine strategies that account for disease heterogeneity and 
individual risk profiles. By synthesizing evidence from molecular studies, 
animal models, and clinical trials, we identify key challenges in therapeutic 
translation and propose future research directions. Our analysis underscores the 
importance of multimodal interventions targeting multiple pathological processes 
simultaneously, combined with early detection methods, to effectively combat 
this devastating disease. This review aims to provide researchers and clinicians 
with an updated framework for understanding AD pathogenesis and developing more 
effective treatment paradigms.

ObjectiveTo assess the feasibility and, preliminarily, the effectiveness of 
long-term, personalized gait training using a digital wearable system (Gait 
Tutor) that provides real-time audio biofeedback to correct or reinforce gait 
behaviour.DesignOpen-label and non-controlled, with assessments before and after 
intervention.SettingReal-world.ParticipantsTwenty persons with Parkinson's 
disease.InterventionParticipants performed home-based gait training in their ON 
medication state for 30 minutes, 3 times per week, for 9 months using a Gait 
Tutor.Main measuresWe evaluated adherence (% of expected sessions), usability, 
and, preliminarily, efficacy by assessing the motor performance of the 
participants before and after the intervention.ResultsSeventeen participants 
(85%) completed the study, performing an average of 83 sessions. Adherence was 
higher for persons with an intermediate disease stage (80.5% of expected 
training sessions), compared to those with a more advanced disease stage 
(46.2%). All participants reported extremely positive scores on the 
questionnaire about ease of use and effectiveness (4.37 ± 0.42). The Movement 
Disorders Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor scores remained stable 
after the training (mean 9 months). In people with an intermediate disease 
stage, clinical scores and physical capacity tended to improve.ConclusionsFor 
the first time, this study shows the feasibility of long-term real-world gait 
training for people with Parkinson's disease, providing preliminary evidence 
that personalized, technology-driven rehabilitation strategies can be sustained 
over extended periods and can assist clinicians in objectively assessing gait 
performance in the real world.

BACKGROUND: Apathy and depression are the most prevalent neuropsychiatric 
symptoms in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Although insufficiently 
investigated, their distinction holds important clinical relevance for accurate 
diagnosis of ALS with behavioural impairment and for patients' prognosis and 
management. In the present study, we aimed to assess both apathy and depressive 
symptoms in patients with ALS and whether they have similar or different 
functional neural correlates.
METHODS: Using graph analysis and connectomics, global and lobar nodal 
properties and regional functional brain connectivity were assessed in ALS 
patients without apathy/depression (ALSn, n = 42), with apathy without 
depression (ALSa, n = 14), with depressive symptoms without apathy (ALSd, 
n = 20), and with apathy and depressive symptoms (ALSad, n = 6), and 46 healthy 
controls. Correlations between brain functional properties, apathy and 
depressive symptoms were performed in all patients.
RESULTS: Depressive symptoms were related with reduced path length within 
bilateral basal ganglia (BG) network, and apathy was related with increased path 
length, decreased nodal strength and local efficiency within left BG network. 
ALSa patients showed altered functional nodal properties within BG network 
compared to ALSn and ALSd. Compared to healthy controls and all non-apathetic 
patients (ALSn and ALSd), all apathetic patients (ALSa and ALSad) exhibited 
altered functional nodal properties within parietal, occipital and frontal 
networks. Non-apathetic patients, compared to apathetic patients, showed 
relatively preserved functional nodal properties in the BG network.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate differences in brain functional neural 
organization associated with apathy and depression, underscoring the importance 
of distinguishing these symptoms in ALS and highlighting the need for targeted 
interventions.

Patients with a history of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection often suffer 
from irreversible and progressive pulmonary damage, yet the underlying 
mechanisms are not fully understood. Here we conducted single-cell 
transcriptomic analysis of human lung tissues including 19 post-tuberculosis 
lung tissues and 13 matched normal lung samples as controls, focusing on areas 
within and surrounding tuberculosis lesions. We identified 
tuberculosis-associated molecular signatures across various cell types, 
including gene expression patterns associated with senescence, inflammation, 
fibrosis and apoptosis. We observed increased vascular inflammation as a key 
feature of lung tissues following tuberculosis. Signatures of decreased FOXO3 
signalling and increased NF-κB-dependent thromboinflammation were validated by 
showing that small interfering RNA silencing of FOXO3 and thrombin treatment 
exacerbated senescence and inflammation in pulmonary endothelial cells. These 
findings provide insight into the mechanisms contributing to post-tuberculosis 
pulmonary damage and suggest potential therapeutic targets for alleviating lung 
impairment in these patients.

Microglial spatial heterogeneity remains a crucial yet not fully answered 
question in the context of potential cell-directed therapies for Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). There is an unclear understanding of the dynamics of distinct 
microglia states adjacent to or far from amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and their 
contributions to neurodegenerative diseases. Here we combine multicolor 
fluorescence cell fate mapping, single-cell transcriptional analysis, epigenetic 
profiling, immunohistochemistry and computational modeling to comprehensively 
characterize the relation of plaque-associated microglia (PAM) and 
non-plaque-associated microglia (non-PAM) in a mouse model of AD. We show that 
non-PAM are a distinct and highly dynamic microglial state, transitioning to PAM 
after Aβ plaque deposition in female mice. Non-PAM modulate the cell population 
expansion in response to amyloid deposition and rapidly respond to environmental 
cues. Indeed, Csf1 signaling modulates non-PAM-to-PAM transition during disease 
progression. Our data suggest that microglia states and their dynamics between 
each other can have distinct contributions to disease, and they may be targeted 
for the treatment of AD.

Plasma levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neurofilament light 
(NEFL) are key dementia biomarkers. GFAP and NEFL represent different underlying 
disease processes, i.e. astrocytic activation vs. neuronal damage. The 
associations of established genetic risk variants with these biomarkers may 
reflect time course and mechanisms by which the respective genes influence 
disease risk. Therefore, we investigated the association of the established 
high-effect dementia variants in APOE and TREM2 with these biomarkers, in a 
large population cohort of over 50,000 participants from the UK Biobank (UKB). 
The results show that APOE4 is associated with elevated levels of plasma GFAP, 
and to a lesser extent, NEFL. The APOE4 effect on GFAP increases with age and 
the number of APOE4 alleles. The risk variants R47H and R62H in TREM2 are 
associated with higher NEFL levels, but not with GFAP, and the effect sizes do 
not increase with age. In contrast, the protective APOE2 allele showed no effect 
on GFAP or NEFL. In conclusion, we find that major genetic risk factors for 
Alzheimer's disease exhibit distinct patterns of effect on these biomarkers, 
with APOE4 primarily affecting astrocyte activation starting in midlife, while 
TREM2 variants affect NEFL but not GFAP, and the protective effects of APOE2 are 
not captured by either of these biomarkers.

The Rab3 protein family is composed of a series of small GTP-binding proteins, 
including Rab3a, Rab3b, Rab3c, and Rab3d, termed Rab3s. They play crucial roles 
in health, including in brain function, such as through the regulation of 
synaptic transmission and neuronal activities. In the high-energy-demanding and 
high-traffic neurons, the Rab3s regulate essential cellular processes, including 
trafficking of synaptic vesicles and lysosomal positioning, which are pivotal 
for the maintenance of synaptic integrity and neuronal physiology. Emerging 
findings suggest that alterations in Rab3s expression are associated with 
age-related neurodegenerative pathologies, including Alzheimer's disease, 
Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease, among others. Here, we provide an 
overview of how Rab3s dysregulation disrupts neuronal homeostasis, contributing 
to impaired autophagy, synaptic dysfunction, and eventually leading to neuronal 
death. We highlight emerging questions on how Rab3s safeguards the brain and how 
their dysfunction contributes to the different neurodegenerative diseases. We 
propose fine-tuning the Rab3s signaling directly or indirectly, such as via 
targeting their upstream protein AMPK, holding therapeutic potential.

This review evaluates the role of vitamins in neurodegeneration. Low levels of B 
vitamins have been associated with cognitive decline. B vitamins may help 
inhibit amyloid plaque aggregation. Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to an 
increased risk of cognitive impairment, correlating with Alzheimer's pathology. 
Vitamin E may help delay Alzheimer's disease progression and support functional 
abilities. In Parkinson's disease, vitamin D shows promise in reducing 
dopaminergic neuron loss and improving motor and cognitive outcomes. Vitamin C 
reduces oxidative stress and preserves neuronal integrity. Vitamin K has gained 
attention for its role in cognitive health, with studies suggesting that higher 
levels may be linked to improved cognitive performance. In conclusion, a better 
understanding of the translational potential of these vitamins may inform 
preventive and therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases. Clinicians 
should consider vitamin supplementation for aging-related conditions. Further 
studies are needed to confirm its therapeutic potential and clarify underlying 
mechanisms in neurodegeneration.

Yunnan, China.

BACKGROUND: Aducanumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting amyloid-beta plaques, 
has been introduced as a pivotal therapeutic agent for Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Although it offers promising benefits in the treatment of early-stage 
Alzheimer's disease, a thorough evaluation of its safety profile and potential 
adverse events (AEs) is essential to ensure patient safety.
METHODS: This retrospective pharmacovigilance study analyzed data from the FDA 
Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database to evaluate AEs associated with 
Aducanumab. Employing a case/non-case methodology, the study utilized signal 
detection algorithms, including the Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR), Proportional 
Reporting Ratio (PRR), Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN), 
and Multi-Item Gamma Poisson Shrinker (MGPS), to identify AEs signals related to 
Aducanumab use.
RESULTS: The study encompassed a total of 11517459 reports, with 431 
specifically citing Aducanumab. A substantial number of AEs were identified, 
particularly among the elderly population and those with pre-existing 
neurological conditions. The most frequently reported AEs were related to the 
nervous system, including "amyloid-related imaging abnormalities" such as 
edema/effusion and microhemorrhages. Other affected system organ classes (SOCs) 
included psychiatric disorders and general disorders and administration site 
conditions. Specific preferred terms (PTs) linked with Aducanumab included 
"confusional state," "disorientation," and "cerebral microhemorrhage." 
Unexpected AEs such as "subdural hematoma" and "head injury" were also noted, 
indicating a broader safety profile that requires further investigation.
CONCLUSIONS: The study's findings underscore the necessity for close monitoring 
of Aducanumab use, especially in elderly patients with AD. The identification of 
both expected and unexpected AEs emphasizes the need for ongoing 
pharmacovigilance and additional research to fully understand the safety profile 
of Aducanumab in clinical practice.
STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY: Strength: Utilized multiple signal 
detection algorithms (ROR, PRR, BCPNN, MGPS) to enhance robustness of 
pharmacovigilance findings. Limitation: Reliance on spontaneous FAERS reports, 
which are prone to underreporting, overreporting, and reporting bias.

OBJECTIVE: This double-blinded randomized trial investigated the effects of 
accelerated intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) and adaptive cognitive 
training on brain function in 24 patients with amnestic mild cognitive 
impairment (aMCI).
METHODS: Participants received real (n=12) or sham (n=12) iTBS targeting the 
left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) thrice daily alongside cognitive 
training for 14 days. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Alzheimer's 
Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog), and functional 
near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) during rest and N-back tasks, which measure 
cognitive function and brain activity respectively, were administered pre-and 
post-intervention.
RESULTS: The active group demonstrated significant cognitive improvement. 
Compared to sham controls, postintervention fNIRS results revealed reduced 
global brain activation during the 1-back task in the active group, particularly 
in the left prefrontal cortex, and the brain activation correlated with reaction 
time. In the 2-back task after treatment, the active group exhibited decreased 
activation in the right motor cortex, while the sham group showed increased 
activation in the left motor cortex. The overall brain connectivity in the sham 
group enhanced following the intervention, with significant differences in the 
correlations between the left prefrontal cortex and left motor cortex between 
groups.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the combined intervention can 
effectively promote cognitive performance and brain function in aMCI patients. 
iTBS causes enhanced functional engagement of the left DLPFC, which further 
facilitates neural efficiency and restores the capacity to modulate the 
allocation of neural resources rather than relying on global compensatory 
hyperactivation. These may be the underlying neural mechanisms for memory 
improvement in aMCI patients (Chinese Clinical Trial Registry: 
ChiCTR2400087943).

Liposomes composed of phospholipids (PLs) either alone or with an active 
molecule, can reveal a significant potential in the improvement of severe 
disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, osteoporosis, and inflammatory 
conditions. For instance, PLs exhibit anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, 
neuroprotective, and osteogenic properties in pathological conditions which 
accelerate the therapeutic effect of the drugs. These pharmacological properties 
can be modulated by the type and dose of PLs or liposome administration. They 
affect disorders through the signalling pathways, down or upregulation of gene 
expression, balance of oxidative stress, and other biological mechanisms. 
Interestingly, liposomes containing essential PLs like phosphatidylserine with 
active molecules such as curcumin or alendronate could synergistically improve 
certain diseases like osteoporosis in experimental models. Accordingly, we aimed 
to highlight the unique advantages of various PLs or liposomes with an emphasis 
on their diverse therapeutic modalities and potentiation of liposomes in synergy 
with the cargos in experimental studies. These properties suggest a promising 
approach to enhance drug efficacy and mitigate the side effects through reduced 
drug usage in chronic diseases, however, their clinical translation requires 
further validation of safety and effectiveness in human.

Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are a group of complex disorders marked by 
pathophysiological mechanisms involving protein aggregation, mitochondrial 
dysfunction, oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Irrespective of extensive 
research advances, NDDs have become a serious global concern and persist as a 
major therapeutic challenge. In recent years, microRNAs (miRNAs), a class of 
small non-coding RNAs, have established a pivotal role in combating NDDs. The 
altered expression of miRNAs is reported to be associated with the progression 
of various NDDs. This review aims to discuss miRNA biogenesis; dysregulation in 
NDDs, specifically Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease (PD) and amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis; their potential as biomarkers; and promising therapeutic 
targets. Additionally, there are various emerging technologies discussed that 
are advanced approaches to enhance miRNA-based diagnostics and therapeutics.

BACKGROUND: Neurological diseases such as stroke and Alzheimer's disease pose 
increasing challenges to global public health. Salvianolic Acid B (SalB), a 
major active component of Salvia miltiorrhiza, has garnered attention due to its 
anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, neuroprotective, and pro-angiogenic properties 
in neurological disease treatment.
PURPOSE: This paper aims to review the mechanisms and effects of SalB in the 
treatment of neurological diseases, exploring its role in improving neurological 
function, mitigating neuroinflammation, and reducing oxidative stress.
RESULTS: SalB demonstrates multifaceted mechanisms in neurological disease 
management. In animal models of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury, SalB 
reduces infarct size and enhances neurological recovery via anti-inflammatory, 
anti-oxidative stress, and angiogenic pathways. It protects the blood-brain 
barrier and inhibits neuronal apoptosis in stroke models. In spinal cord injury 
models, SalB alleviates edema and promotes motor function recovery. In 
Alzheimer's disease models, SalB suppresses amyloid-beta formation and 
neuroinflammation. Additionally, SalB exhibits antidepressant and analgesic 
effects in pain-depression comorbidity models. These effects are mediated 
through the regulation of signaling pathways, including NF-κB, AMPK, PI3K/Akt, 
and Nrf2, highlighting SalB's broad therapeutic potential in neurological 
diseases.
CONCLUSION: SalB exhibits promising prospects in the treatment of neurological 
diseases. However, its clinical application faces challenges such as chemical 
stability and bioavailability. Further research on the mechanisms of SalB and 
innovative drug delivery strategies is needed to advance its application in 
neurological disease therapy.

Late Onset Alzheimer's Disease (LOAD) is the most common cause of dementia, 
characterized by the deposition of plaques primarily of neurotoxic 
amyloid-[Formula: see text] ([Formula: see text]) peptide and tau protein. Our 
objective is to develop a noninvasive therapy to decrease the toxic A[Formula: 
see text] levels, using repeated electromagnetic field stimulation (REMFS) in 
the brain of Alzheimer's disease patients. We previously examined the effects of 
REMFS on [Formula: see text] levels in primary human brain (PHB) cultures at 
different frequencies, powers, and specific absorption rates (SAR). PHB cultures 
at day in vitro (DIV7) treated with 64 MHz with a SAR of 0.6 W/Kg, one hour 
daily for 14 days (DIV 21) had significantly reduced (p =0.001) levels of 
secreted [Formula: see text]-42 and [Formula: see text]-40 peptide without 
evidence of toxicity. The EMF frequency and power, and SAR levels used in our 
work is utilized in MRI's, thus suggesting REMFS can be further developed in 
clinical settings to lower ([Formula: see text]) levels and improve the memory 
in AD patients. These findings and numerous studies in rodent AD models prompted 
us to design a portable RF device, appropriate for human use, that will deliver 
a homogeneous RF power deposition with a SAR value of 0.4-0.9 W/kg to all human 
brain memory areas, lower ([Formula: see text]) levels, and potentially improve 
memory in human AD patients.The research took place at the Indiana University 
School of Medicine (IUSM) and Purdue University Indianapolis. The first phase 
was done in PHB cultures at the IUSM. Through this phase, we found that a 64 MHz 
frequency and an RF power deposition with a SAR of 0.4-0.6 W/kg reduced the 
(A[Formula: see text]) levels potentially impacting Alzheimer's disease. The 
second phase of the project was conducted at Purdue University, we used ANSYS 
HFSS (High Frequency Simulation System) to design the devices that produced an 
appropriate penetration depth, polarization, and power deposition with a SAR of 
0.4-0.9 W/kg to all memory brain areas of several numerical models. In Phase 
II-B will validate the device in a physical phantom. Phase III will require the 
FDA approval and application in clinical trials.The research parameters were 
translated into a designed product that fits comfortably in human head and fed 
from an external RF source that generates an RF power deposition with a SAR of 
0.4-0.9 W/kg to a realistic numerical brain. The engineering design is flexible 
by varying the leg capacitors of the Meander Line Antenna (MLA) devices. Thermal 
outcomes of the results guarantee less than 0.5 C temperature increase within 
one-hour time of exposure, which can be used in clinical trials for AD patients. 
Design parameters include dimension of the coil, the MLA structure, conducting 
material, and capacitance values with the produced EM fields. The flexible 
design was achieved by varying the additive capacitance between conductors, and 
via a hybrid approach integrating a birdcage with sixteen MLA. A coil antenna 
size within 16 cm radius and 13 cm length was achieved. A capacitance between 
6.9 nF and 9.2 nF were observed when copper materials with 16 conductors were 
used to achieve the research parameters in focus.The medical project proposed 
here has three phases: The initial phase of determining the research parameters 
for reducing A[Formula: see text] levels in human brain cultures and animal 
studies was completed at the IUSM. The translational engineering design of the 
REMS device and the numerical head and Antenna devices was successfully 
completed and presented in this paper by Purdue University and IUSM. Future 
phases will require manufacture and experimental validation of the REMS device 
with FDA approval for human application. Clinical impact: Our biological studies 
in human brain cultures showed that an RF power with a SAR of 0.4-0.9 W/kg at 64 
MHz, lowered A[Formula: see text] levels, which potentially will prevent the 
death of the brain neurons and improve memory in AD. The fact that we found a 
safe RF power deposition with a SAR value associated with the proposed 
biological effects in human neurons and that 64 MHz provides a penetration depth 
of 13.5 cm that reaches all memory areas in a human brain makes the design and 
manufacture of this device of high clinical impact in the study of these 
exposures on the treatment of Alzheimer's and other protein associate diseases. 
Also, 64 MHz and RF power deposition with similar SAR levels are administer 
routinely in routine MRI for more than 4 decades makes it a safe framework for 
these novel therapeutic strategy.Clinical and Translational Impact Statement: 
The basic science work presented previously is both mechanistic and 
translational, and would advance the field of neuroscience as well as AD. This 
prompted us to joint efforts between the Indiana University School of Medicine 
and the electrical and computer engineering at Purdue University to design and 
develop a suitable EMF device for human treatments. Recently, our engineering 
team designed a birdcage antenna that generate a homogeneous RF power deposition 
with the same SAR values of our biological experiments in a realistic numerical 
human brain. Here, the engineering research has been extended to investigate the 
design of a portable flexible birdcage antenna that will enable adjustments to 
fit physical patient's characteristics, such as geometry, head size, and tissue 
dimensions. This new device is expected to improve SAR uniformity and may reduce 
the likelihood of untreated regions in the brains of patients during treatments. 
Also, here we determined that the maximum temperature rise of these exposures 
was less than 0.5°C, which is a safe level per regulatory agencies. This study 
considers a portable device system that will achieve the research parameters and 
patient satisfaction regarding reliability and comfort.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the leading tauopathies in which several 
kinases phosphorylate Tau in response to Aβ oligomers, inflammation, calcium 
dysregulation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, or disruption of the 
key signaling pathways. Tau is phosphorylated by Ser/Thr kinases such as GSK3β, 
CDK5, MAPK14, and MARK2, as well as Tyr kinases like Fyn. Given the large 
crosstalk among these kinases, targeting one of these kinases is ineffective in 
treating tauopathies such as AD, highlighting the need for a multi-targeted 
approach. In this study, we targeted key kinases involved in Tau 
hyperphosphorylation using compounds derived from the medicinal plant Berberis 
lycium (B.ly.), which is reported to have anti-inflammatory, autophagy, and 
antioxidant properties. We employed virtual screening, ADMET evaluation, PASS 
analysis, DFT, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, and MM/PBSA studies to assess 
the interaction of B.ly. compounds with CDK5, Fyn, GSK3β, MARK2, and MAPK14. 
Apigenin-7-O-glucoside (A7OG) was selected for its strong binding affinity 
within the ATP-binding pockets of these kinases. MD simulations demonstrated 
that A7OG exhibited promising inhibitory effects on CDK5, Fyn, MARK2, and 
MAPK14, with minimal fluctuation in its interaction with GSK3β. MM/PBSA analyses 
indicated stable binding energies for all the kinase-A7OG complexes. Our 
multitargeted investigations revealed that A7OG could be a promising molecule 
implicated in modulating tau hyperphosphorylating kinases that could lead to the 
development of therapeutic interventions in AD treatment.

INTRODUCTION: This study uses longitudinal amyloid biomarker and cognitive data 
to generate sample size estimates for two-armed, pre-clinical amyloid clearance 
clinical trials.
METHODS: PET PiB DVR ranges defined three amyloid groups (positive, "A+"; sub 
threshold/low positive, "subA+"; and negative, "A-") in cognitively unimpaired 
Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention participants. Amyloid group 
trajectories estimated from mixed effects models informed per-treatment-arm 
sample size estimates to detect plausible treatment effects over 3-year 
(biomarker) or 6-year (cognition) study windows (80% power).
RESULTS: To detect ≥60% slowing in PiB accumulation, ≤40 may be needed per arm 
for both SubA+ and A+; to detect the same effect sizes in plasma p-tau217 
trajectories, ~50-1700 are needed, depending on assay and amyloid subgroup. 
Among cognitive outcomes, Digit Symbol Substitution and a 5-test Preclinical 
Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite consistently required fewest (<2000) per arm.
DISCUSSION: Early intervention study planning will benefit from selection of 
outcomes that are most sensitive to AD biomarker-related preclinical change.

Essential oils (EOs), derived from aromatic plants, have garnered significant 
attention for their potential neuroprotective properties in neurodegenerative 
diseases. This systematic review evaluates recent advancements in understanding 
the neuroprotective role of EOs against Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's 
disease (PD). Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a comprehensive 
literature search across three major databases (PubMed, Virtual Health Library, 
and Web of Science) from inception to January 2024, resulting in thirteen 
high-quality in vivo studies for qualitative analysis. The review assessed 
various EOs, with hydrodistillation being the predominant extraction method 
(66.66% of studies). Studies primarily utilized Wistar rats (46.15%) and various 
mouse strains, employing diverse disease induction methods including β-amyloid 
administration (30.7% of AD models), rotenone (7.7% of PD models), and 
6-hydroxydopamine (7.7% of PD models). Administration routes varied, with oral 
administration being most common (38.4%), with gavage and inhalation each 
accounting for 23.1% of studies. Key findings revealed that EOs exhibit 
multifaceted neuroprotective mechanisms. In AD models (69.3% of studies), EOs 
reduced oxidative stress markers, decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, 
and increased neuroprotective protein expression. In PD models (30.7% of 
studies), EOs demonstrated significant dopaminergic neuroprotection, with 
improvements in behavioral outcomes. Behavioral assessments showed consistent 
enhancements in memory, learning, and motor functions across studies. The 
systematic analysis provides compelling evidence for EOs' neuroprotective 
efficacy, particularly in early-stage intervention. However, limitations include 
the predominance of animal studies, variability in dosing, and administration 
methods. The most promising EOs identified were from Pinus halepensis, Citrus 
limon, and Acorus species, showing particular efficacy in reducing cognitive 
deficits and oxidative stress. Chemical analysis revealed that compounds such as 
α-pinene, limonene, and β-caryophyllene were predominantly responsible for the 
observed therapeutic effects. The molecular mechanisms underlying these effects 
included modulation of cholinergic transmission, reduction of amyloid-β 
aggregation, and enhancement of antioxidant enzyme activities. These findings 
suggest that EOs could serve as valuable complementary therapeutic agents, 
particularly when standardized for specific bioactive compounds. Future research 
should focus on standardizing EO compositions, conducting human clinical trials 
to establish safety and efficacy profiles, and investigating potential 
synergistic effects with conventional treatments.

Objective This study aimed to investigate the relationship between white matter 
hyperintensities (WMH) and perivascular spaces (PVS) on magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) with Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores in patients 
referred for possible lecanemab therapy based on clinical suspicion of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) prior to biomarker confirmation. Materials and methods 
In this retrospective review, 149 consecutive patients with suspected AD between 
November 2023 and June 2024 who were evaluated for possible lecanemab therapy 
were identified. All underwent brain MRI and had valid MoCA scores. WMH were 
graded using the Fazekas scale (0-3). PVS were visually graded (1-4) in the 
basal ganglia and centrum semiovale on T2-weighted images. Generalized linear 
models assessed the association between imaging markers and MoCA, adjusting for 
age, sex, hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HLD), and diabetes mellitus (DM). 
Results The mean MoCA score was 19.56, reflecting mild to moderate cognitive 
impairment. The mean Fazekas score was 1.37, indicating mild to moderate WMH 
burden, while the mean PVS scores for basal ganglia and centrum semiovale were 
1.99 and 2.37, respectively. There is no significant correlation between age and 
MoCA scores in our patient population. A negative association of -0.1 between 
the Fazekas score and MoCA score was observed after controlling for the effects 
of PVS. In contrast, PVS did not significantly correlate with MoCA score. 
Conclusion In patients evaluated for possible lecanemab therapy, a higher WMH 
burden was negatively associated with global cognition, whereas PVS demonstrated 
no significant relationship with MoCA scores. These findings suggest that WMH 
may be an imaging marker of vascular pathology in those suspected of AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves progressive degeneration of cholinergic and 
synaptic networks, leading to cognitive decline. Nerve growth factor (NGF) and 
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), essential for neuronal survival and 
plasticity, have gained therapeutic interest. Particularly through gene therapy 
approaches. Preclinical studies have shown improved neuronal integrity and 
memory restoration. Nonetheless, clinical translation faces significant 
challenges, including invasive delivery, vector limitations, and receptor 
dysregulation. Gene therapy must be focused on precision-targeted, minimally 
invasive delivery systems, controlled gene expression, and early-stage 
intervention. This review critically evaluates NGF- and BDNF-based gene 
therapies, highlighting advances, limitations, and future directions that may 
position neurotrophin modulation as a viable disease-modifying strategy in AD.

Huperzine A (HupA) and huperzine B (HupB) are potent acetylcholinesterase 
inhibitor used widely for clinical treatment of Alzheimer's disease, which are 
mainly extracrted from natural populations of Huperzia species. This study aimed 
to the evaluate potential of producing Hup of native Huperzia javanica species 
collected in Vietnam as well as identify endophytic fungi that produce high Hup 
or simultaneously produce many types of Hup derived from this plant as a 
material source for natural Hup production. By HPLC-DAD-MS analysis, H. javanica 
collected from Ha Giang, Vietnam was found as a novel producer of HupA and HupB 
with a yield of 0.513 mg/g dry weight (wt) and 0.192 mg/g dry wt, respectively. 
Inspired by this discovery, a total of 63 endophytic fungi were isolated from 
healthy tissues of the collected H. javanica plants, including 52 fungal strains 
belonging to nine genera and 11 unidentified strains based on morphological 
characteristics. Using HPLC, 9 Hup-producing fungi were identified when compared 
to the standard HupA and HupB. Surprisingly, 7 fungal strains produced both HupA 
and HupB, among which strain TLC12 produced the highest HupA and HupB contents 
of 0.271 and 0.163 mg/g mycelium dry cell weight (gdcw), respectively. Fungal 
strains TLC19 and TLC22 only yielded a respective amount of 0.305 and 0.135 mg/ 
gdcw of HupA. Combining with Internal Transcribed Spacer sequence analysis, 9 
potent fungi were identified as Neurospora calospora (TLC9, TLC10, TLC11), 
Schizophyllum commune TLC12, Epicoccum sorghinum TLC13, Alternaria tenuissima 
TLC14, Cephalotrichum sp. TLC20, Daldinia sp. TLC19, and Schizophyllum sp. 
TLC22. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating H. 
javanica as a prolific and novel source of endophytic fungi capable of yielding 
high HupA and HupB contents. The exploitation of 9 Hup-producing fungi is also 
valuable for both basic research and industrial Hup manufactures. These findings 
open new perspectives for industrial production of fungal HupA and HupB and 
conservation of Huperzia species.

Structurally diverse tau filaments form proteinaceous aggregates in a 
heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative diseases called tauopathies1. The 
factors extrinsic to the highly ordered core structure that influence tau 
filament stability are not well understood. Here, we found that 
polyubiquitinated tau filaments from Alzheimer's disease and vacuolar tauopathy 
human brain tissue exhibit distinct seeding patterns in mice, in association 
with differences in tau filament ultrastructure determined by cryo-electron 
microscopy. Interestingly, chemical modulation of the polarity of polyubiquitin 
adjacent to the tau core with the small molecule ubistatin B resulted in the 
repositioning of poorly structured densities towards positively charged residues 
on the highly structured core filament, leading to shifting of the 
protofilament-protofilament interface of certain vacuolar tauopathy tau 
filaments. These results suggest that the structure of tau filaments that are 
associated with different seeding activities in vivo can be influenced by 
post-translational modifications.

Identifying Alzheimer's disease (AD) subtypes is essential for AD diagnosis and 
treatment. We integrated multiomics data from brain tissues of the ROSMAP and 
MSBB studies using a subspace merging algorithm and identified two AD patient 
clusters with notable cognitive and AD pathology differences. Analysis of 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in brain and blood samples pinpointed the 
LDLR gene as a potential blood biomarker linked to brain gene expression 
changes. Furthermore, we conducted PheWAS analysis on All of Us Project's EHR 
and WGS dataset for 105 eQTLs associated with the DEGs and revealed significant 
associations between these eQTLs and several phenotypes, shedding light on 
potential regulatory roles of these genes in diverse physiological processes. 
Our study successfully integrated multiomics data and proposes LDLR as a 
candidate blood biomarker for AD subtyping. The identified phenotypic signatures 
provide valuable insights on molecular mechanisms underlying AD heterogeneity, 
paving the way for personalized AD treatment.

Metabolic dysfunction is linked to several forms of age-related 
neurodegeneration including Alzheimer's Disease (AD), and targeting brain energy 
metabolism is an increasingly attractive mode of therapeutic intervention. 
However, commonly used in vitro methods to identify specific metabolic pathways 
of interest in preclinical models of neurodegenerative disease have considerable 
limitations. They are prone to subselection of sample material, unable to 
identify cell type-specific effects, or cannot identify metabolic defects 
upstream of mitochondria. Here we address these challenges by validating a 
method for stable isotope tracing with isolated synaptic nerve terminals, or 
'synaptosomes'. We further applied this approach to study glucose metabolism in 
synaptosomes isolated from the 5X-FAD mouse model of AD treated with the 
antidiabetic sodium-glucose linked transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor 
Dapagliflozin. Treatment with Dapagliflozin preserved steady-state levels of 
synaptosomal metabolites and enrichment from labeled glucose into citrate that 
was reduced in the 5X-FAD model. These changes correlated with trends towards 
improved spatial working memory but not amyloid burden. The results highlight 
the utility of stable isotope tracing in synaptosomes to identify precise sites 
of metabolic dysfunction and mechanisms of action for metabolic drug candidates 
in preclinical models of neurodegeneration.

O-GlcNAcase inhibitors (OGAi) have been proposed as therapeutics for Alzheimer's 
disease due to their ability to increase O-GlcNAcylation of tau and reduce its 
aggregation. However, the recent failure of ceperognastat in a Phase II 
trial-marked by accelerated cognitive decline in the treatment arm-has raised 
concerns about the safety of this therapeutic class. Here, we evaluated the 
acute synaptic effects of three structurally distinct OGAi (ceperognastat, 
ASN90, and MK8719) in mouse hippocampal slices. Electrophysiological recordings 
revealed that all three compounds impaired both short- and long-term synaptic 
plasticity, as evidenced by reduced paired-pulse facilitation/depression and 
suppressed long-term potentiation. Immunohistochemistry showed altered synaptic 
protein levels, with increased PSD-95 and reduced Synaptophysin 1 in neurons, 
alongside a biphasic shift in Tau phosphorylation. These findings indicate that 
OGAi produce rapid and convergent synaptotoxic effects across pre- and 
postsynaptic compartments, likely reflecting a class-wide mechanism. We argue 
that electrophysiological screening should be standard in CNS drug development 
and caution against targeting essential synaptic processes in chronic 
neurodegenerative conditions.

Dysregulated RNA metabolism is a significant feature of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), yet how post-transcriptional RNA modifications like N 6-methyladenosine 
(m6A) are altered in AD is unknown. Here, we performed deamination adjacent to 
RNA modification targets (DART-seq) on human dorsolateral prefrontal cortices to 
assess changes in m6A with nucleotide resolution. In non-AD brains, m6A sites 
increased with age, predominantly within the 3'UTR of transcripts encoding 
tripartite synapse proteins. In contrast, AD brains lost the age-associated m6A 
site increase and exhibited global hypomethylation of transcripts, including 
MAPT and APP. Hypomethylated genes involved with GABAergic signaling, glutamate 
transport, and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis exhibited reduced expression, 
connecting m6A to synaptic excitotoxicity and disrupted proteostasis in AD. 
Site-specific m6A levels were linked with GABRA1 expression and protein levels, 
but this relationship was abolished in AD. Our findings provide insight into 
post-transcriptional mechanisms of dysregulated RNA metabolism in AD that are 
related to aging and GABAergic regulation.

Mitochondrial dysfunction is a critical factor in the pathogenesis of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). The mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing 
system (MICOS) plays a pivotal role in shaping the inner mitochondrial membrane, 
forming cristae junctions and establishing interaction sites between the inner 
and outer mitochondrial membranes and thereby serving as a cornerstone of 
mitochondrial structure and function. In the past decade, MICOS abnormalities 
have been extensively linked to AD pathogenesis. In particular, dysregulated 
expression of MICOS subunits and mutations in MICOS-related genes have been 
identified in AD, often in association with hallmark pathological features such 
as amyloid-β plaque accumulation, neurofibrillary tangle formation, and neuronal 
apoptosis. Furthermore, MICOS subunits interact with several etiologically 
relevant proteins, significantly influencing AD progression. The intricate 
crosstalk between these proteins and MICOS subunits underscores the relevance of 
MICOS dysfunction in AD. Therapeutic strategies targeting MICOS subunits or 
their interacting proteins may offer novel approaches for AD treatment. In the 
present review, we introduce current understanding of MICOS structures and 
functions, highlight MICOS pathogenesis in AD, and summarize the available 
MICOS-targeting drugs potentially useful for AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), characterized by β-amyloid (Aβ) aggregation and 
neuroinflammation, remains a formidable clinical challenge. Herein, we present 
an innovative nose-to-brain delivery platform utilizing lactoferrin 
(Lf)-functionalized lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) co-encapsulating α-mangostin 
(α-M) and β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) siRNA (siB). This dual-modal 
therapeutic system synergistically combines the neuroprotective and 
microglia-reprogramming capabilities of α-M with the transcriptional silencing 
of BACE1 via siB, thereby simultaneously inhibiting Aβ production and enhancing 
its clearance. Fabricated via a microfluidic approach, the LNPs exhibited 
uniform particle size distribution, great encapsulation efficiency, and robust 
colloidal stability. Upon intranasal administration, Lf-functionalization 
enabled superior brain-targeting efficacy through receptor-mediated 
transcytosis. In vitro studies demonstrated that α-M reversed Aβ-induced 
low-density lipoprotein receptor downregulation, promoting microglial 
phagocytosis and autophagic degradation of Aβ, while siB effectively suppressed 
BACE1 expression, abrogating Aβ synthesis. In vivo investigations in APP/PS1 
transgenic mice revealed remarkable cognitive recovery, substantial Aβ plaque 
reduction, and alleviation of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. This 
intricately designed LNP system, exploiting a non-invasive and efficient 
nose-to-brain delivery route, provides a biocompatible, synergistic, and 
transformative therapeutic strategy for the multifaceted management of AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by cognitive decline and pathological brain changes. While aging 
is the primary risk factor, circadian rhythm disruption (CRD) is increasingly 
recognized as a central driver of AD pathology. CRD exacerbates oxidative 
stress, systemic inflammation, and gut microbiome dysbiosis, impairing 
sleep-wake cycles, disrupting metabolic homeostasis, and promoting 
neuroinflammation, ultimately accelerating disease progression. Oxidative 
stress, a key factor in neuronal damage, is both a cause and consequence of 
circadian misalignment, while mitochondrial dysfunction further amplifies 
oxidative damage, impairing synaptic function and cognitive stability. 
Additionally, gut microbiome dysbiosis contributes to neuroinflammatory 
processes, worsening neurodegeneration. Given these complex interactions, this 
review aims to elucidate the role of CRD in AD pathology and explore potential 
therapeutic interventions targeting circadian dysfunction. Specifically, it 
examines the efficacy of time-restricted feeding (TRF), a dietary strategy that 
aligns food intake with circadian rhythms. TRF has shown promise in restoring 
circadian function, reducing oxidative stress, improving mitochondrial health, 
and promoting gut microbiome diversity. By addressing CRD, TRF may offer a novel 
approach to mitigating AD pathologies. This review also identifies current 
research gaps and future directions for developing circadian-based interventions 
in AD prevention and treatment.

BACKGROUND: The negative consequences of caregiving can be mitigated by 
providing caregivers with support programs that increase their dementia care 
skills and provide emotional and tangible support. Web-based technology can 
increase the availability of evidence-based caregiver interventions. 
GamePlan4Care (GP4C) is a web-based adaptation of the Resources for Enhancing 
Alzheimer's Caregiver Health II (REACH II) intervention, redesigned and 
reformatted for web-based delivery.
OBJECTIVE: The goal of GP4C is to create a web-based family caregiver support 
platform that facilitates self-directed exposure to evidence-based skills 
training and support for caregivers of persons living with dementia. This 
multidimensional approach of using technology enhanced with live support has the 
potential for improved scalability and sustainability. In preparation for a 
randomized clinical trial of the new intervention, the GP4C platform underwent 
user interface/user experience (UI/UX) testing with caregivers as part of an 
iterative design process.
METHODS: UI/UX testing of caregivers' reactions to technical and content-related 
aspects of the platform was conducted with 31 caregivers recruited through 
partnerships with community-based organizations in central Texas. Usability 
testing consisted of performing system tasks, answering open-ended questions on 
the tasks, and providing feedback on their experience with the platform. Two 
researchers used an inductive thematic approach to data analysis using 
transcripts of individual audio and screen-recorded sessions with each 
participant. The analysis consisted of 3 phases: data familiarization, coding, 
and theme formulation.
RESULTS: In total, 18 participants tested technical-related aspects of the GP4C 
platform, and 13 participants tested content-related aspects. The average age of 
participants was 62 (SD 12.2, range 31-86). A majority of participants were 
female (27/31, 87.1%) and White or Caucasian (26/31, 83.1%) while almost 
one-third were Hispanic (10/31, 32.3%). The thematic analysis revealed 3 themes: 
supportive resources as a common theme, active engagement for technical aspects 
of the platform, and a comprehensive approach for content aspects of the 
platform. Participants also suggested changes in navigation and content.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings from the usability testing sessions indicate that the 
platform provided engaging, useful content that the caregiver would continue to 
use, resonated with their caregiving experience, helped the caregivers think 
through their choices and emotions, and could be used to help communicate with 
the person living with dementia. Caregivers appreciated the personalization 
based on what they had already completed and the concept of having a Dementia 
Care Navigator when they needed additional help. Caregivers also provided 
multiple suggestions on how to improve the system, including changes for easier 
navigation and inclusiveness. This positive feedback indicates that with a few 
changes, the platform would be beneficial to meet the needs and provide 
resources for caregivers of persons living with dementia. The process of 
involving end users in usability testing during the development stage ensures 
that the finished tool will better meet users' expectations and current needs.

BackgroundAlzheimer's disease (AD) is recognized as a multifactorial 
neurodegenerative disorder involving numerous cellular and molecular processes, 
such as sleep disturbance, imbalance in brain glucose metabolism and 
neuroinflammation; these dysregulations typically precede the onset of symptoms. 
Hence, the results of mono-target therapy after AD diagnosis are in many cases 
unsatisfactory.ObjectiveTraditional Chinese medicine (TCM) presents significant 
potential for treating AD. Sleep disorders are one of the early symptoms of AD; 
however, there is no effective solution to sleep disorders caused by AD. Some 
TCMs have been shown to treat sleep disorders by regulating energy metabolism or 
improving neuroinflammation. This study aims to investigate if XX-F 
administrated in advance could alleviate AD by improving sleep quality and 
neuroinflammation.MethodsMice were given Xiexintongfu formula (XX-F) 
intragastrically for three months. Morris water maze and pentobarbital-induced 
sleep test were performed to evaluate cognition and sleep. Determine changes in 
energy metabolism related to glycolysis through western blot and specific assay 
kits. Using immunofluorescence and western blot to detect 
neuroinflammation.ResultsShortened sleep duration and cognitive impairment were 
observed in 6-month-old APP/PS1 mice. XX-F significantly prolonged sleep 
duration and rescued cognition. In addition, XX-F reduced the number of 
amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and ameliorated neuroinflammation, and inhibited 
glycolysis by reducing pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) and lactate levels while 
rescuing adenosine triphosphate (ATP) deficiency.ConclusionsWe demonstrate that 
XX-F can improve sleep and cognition of AD mice by regulating energy metabolism 
and reducing neuroinflammation. This is a potential treatment method for AD and 
requires further in-depth research.

BACKGROUND: Analyzing disease-linked genetic variants via expression 
quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) helps identify potential disease-causing genes. 
Previous research prioritized genes by integrating Genome-Wide Association Study 
(GWAS) results with tissue-level eQTLs. Recent studies have explored brain cell 
type-specific eQTLs, but a systematic analysis across multiple Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) genome-wide association study (GWAS) datasets or comparisons 
between tissue-level and cell type-specific effects remain limited. Here, we 
integrated brain cell type-level and bulk-level eQTL datasets with AD GWAS 
datasets to identify potential causal genes.
METHODS: We used Summary Data-Based Mendelian Randomization (SMR) and Bayesian 
Colocalization (COLOC) to integrate AD GWAS summary statistics with eQTLs 
datasets. Combining data from five AD GWAS, two single-cell eQTL datasets, and 
one bulk eQTL dataset, we identified novel candidate causal genes and further 
confirmed known ones. We investigated gene regulation through enhancer activity 
using H3K27ac and ATAC-seq data, performed protein-protein interaction (PPI) and 
pathway enrichment, and conducted a drug/compound enrichment analysis with Drug 
Signatures Database (DSigDB) to support drug repurposing for AD.
RESULTS: We identified 28 candidate causal genes for AD, of which 12 were 
uniquely detected at the cell-type level, 9 were exclusive to the bulk level and 
7 detected in both. Among the 19 cell-type level candidate causal genes, 
microglia contributed the highest number of candidate genes, followed by 
excitatory neurons, astrocytes, inhibitory neurons, oligodendrocytes, and 
oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). PABPC1 emerged as a novel candidate 
causal gene in astrocytes. We generated PPI networks for the candidate causal 
genes and found that pathways such as membrane organization, cell migration, and 
ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT signaling were enriched. The AD-risk variant associated with 
candidate causal gene PABPC1 is located near or within enhancers only active in 
astrocytes. We classified the 28 genes into three drug tiers and identified 
druggable interactions, with imatinib mesylate emerging as a key candidate. A 
drug-target gene network was created to explore potential drug targets for AD.
CONCLUSIONS: We systematically prioritized AD candidate causal genes based on 
cell type-level and bulk level molecular evidence. The integrative approach 
enhances our understanding of molecular mechanisms of AD-related genetic 
variants and facilitates interpretation of AD GWAS results.

Resveratrol, a natural phytoalexin, has been suggested to have beneficial 
effects in age-related diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Studies indicate 
that it may delay memory decline and exert neuroprotective properties in vitro 
and in vivo. However, the precise mechanisms underlying these effects remain 
unclear, and the impact of resveratrol on central insulin resistance-a key 
feature of neurodegenerative disorders-remains insufficiently explored. Given 
the potential therapeutic significance of targeting insulin sensitivity in 
neurodegeneration, further investigation into the role of resveratrol in 
modulating these pathways is warranted. Our aim was to investigate the effects 
of resveratrol on insulin signaling and mitochondrial function in a previously 
established streptozotocin-induced in vitro neurodegeneration model. The 
phosphorylation status of key insulin signaling proteins and regulators of 
insulin resistance and autophagy markers were analyzed via Western blot and an 
ELISA-based microarray technique. The effects of resveratrol on mitochondrial 
biogenesis were evaluated through Mitotracker staining and quantification of 
mitochondrial mRNA and protein expression. Resveratrol augmented the 
cytoprotective effect of insulin in a concentration-dependent manner. It reduced 
the Ser(312) phosphorylation of IRS1, which is commonly linked to insulin 
resistance, and lowered the IC50 value for Tyr(895) phosphorylation required for 
activation. Similar insulin-sensitizing effects were observed in downstream 
signaling components. Resveratrol treatment exerted a caloric restriction 
mimetic activity through activating the AMPK/PGC1α/SIRT1 pathway and upregulated 
the expression of mitochondrial transcription factor TFAM and ATP synthase 
subunit (ATP5B). Despite the activation of mitochondrial biogenesis, the number 
of mitochondria was not altered, because it simultaneously induced autophagy 
marked by ULK1 phoshorylation and LC3 lipidation. Our findings indicate that 
resveratrol can enhance insulin signaling, even at the initial step of IRS1 
phosphorylation. Its insulin-sensitizing effects extend beyond metabolic 
regulation to include survival responses. Resveratrol as a caloric restriction 
mimetic exerted a balanced effect on mitochondrial biogenesis and autophagy 
therefore improving mitochondrial quality control.

More than 65 million people worldwide experience neurodegenerative diseases, 
such as Alzheimer disease, frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson disease, and 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. As the risk of developing these diseases 
increases with age, increasing life expectancy will further accelerate their 
prevalence. Despite major advances in the understanding of the molecular 
mechanisms of neurodegeneration, no curative therapy is available to date. 
Neurodegenerative diseases are known to be associated with alterations in 
serotonergic neurotransmission, which might critically contribute to the 
pathogenesis of these diseases. Therefore, targeting the serotonergic system 
appears to be a promising therapeutic approach. In this review, we provide a 
comprehensive overview of pathological changes in serotonergic neurotransmission 
in different neurodegenerative diseases and discuss novel treatment strategies 
based on targeted modulation of the serotonergic system. We primarily focus on 
the therapeutic approaches modulating serotonin homeostasis, its biosynthesis, 
and the modulation of defined serotonin receptors. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: A 
common feature of multiple neurodegenerative diseases is dysregulation of the 
serotonergic system at the cellular, molecular, and genetic levels that strongly 
contributes to specific pathological phenotypes. Targeting these alterations 
represents a suitable therapeutic strategy to combat disease-relevant 
pathomechanisms, slow down disease progression, and overcome pathological 
consequences.

Inflammation in both CNS and peripheral circulation system is known to have a 
significant impact in AD pathogenesis. In the CNS, AD-related inflammation 
involves the activation of various types of immune cells, such as microglia, 
astrocytes, and T cells. Meanwhile, one of the hallmarks of peripheral 
circulation inflammation in AD is activation of T cells. In addition, 
Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4), as a key genetic risk factor for late-onset AD, 
significantly influences both CNS and peripheral circulation system inflammation 
in the pathogenesis of AD. Moreover, APOE4 play a key role in various 
pathological changes in AD, such as Aβ accumulation, tau phosphorylation, lipid 
metabolism disorders, and BBB dysfunction, resulting in microglia, astrocytes, 
and T cells activation, as well as the release of inflammatory factors. This 
comprehensive review aims to elucidate the specific mechanisms through which 
APOE4 triggers inflammation in both CNS and peripheral circulation system in the 
context of AD. Furthermore, we also summarize several therapeutic approaches 
that target APOE for the treatment of AD.

A series of novel 2-(2-phenylethyl)chromone and 2/3-styrylchromone derivatives 
(A1-A16, B1-B43) were designed, synthesized, and systematically evaluated for 
their multi-target activities against key pathological factors of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). In vitro studies demonstrated that compound B22 exhibited potent 
and selective acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition (IC₅₀ = 2.52 ± 1.11 μM) 
with negligible activity against butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) (IC₅₀ > 500 μM), 
along with strong monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) inhibition (93.6% inhibition at 1 
μM). Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence assays revealed that B18 and B22 
effectively inhibited the aggregation of both Aβ40/42 peptides (IC₅₀ = 1.44 and 
1.00 μM, respectively) and Tau fibrillization (IC₅₀ = 2.61 and 3.32 μM), while 
promoting the disaggregation of pre-formed amyloid fibrils. Molecular docking 
and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations indicated that B22 exhibited favorable 
binding affinities (ΔG ≈ - 7.3 kcal/mol) and stable interactions within the AChE 
active site. Furthermore, B22 significantly attenuated reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) levels (by up to 89.5%) and rescued Aβ-induced cytotoxicity in SHSY5Y 
cells, restoring cell viability to 85.7% at 20 μM. Collectively, these results 
highlight chromone-based scaffolds, particularly compound B22, as promising 
multifunctional candidates for the development of disease-modifying therapeutics 
targeting AD.

Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by the deposition of amyloid fibrils, 
such as senile plaques, composed of amyloid β peptide (Aβ). As a novel 
therapeutic modality, we have previously developed an azobenzene-boron complex 
type photocatalyst that photo-oxygenates Aβ fibrils. And the in vivo 
photo-oxygenation reaction using this photocatalyst successfully reduced the Aβ 
fibrils in the brain. Since Aβ fibril is one of the causative molecules in the 
brains of AD patients, the photocatalyst is expected to be a new modality for 
disease-modifying therapy against AD. However, the exact relationship between 
light energy and photo-oxygenating activity for Aβ fibrils remains unclear. In 
this paper, we have demonstrated using mass spectrometric analysis that the 
number of oxygens added to Aβ fibrils was increased in a sigmoidal curve with 
the logarithm of light energy. We also showed that it depended on the total 
light energy, not on the irradiance. These data suggest that photo-oxygenation 
proceeds at even lower levels of light energy, and it may be possible to induce 
photo-oxygenation in areas where light penetration is difficult, such as the 
human brain.

Neurological disorders significantly impact billions of individuals worldwide, 
representing a leading cause of disability and premature death. Antibody-based 
therapeutics, known for their high target specificity, have been investigated 
for various neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's 
diseases. However, despite advancements in neuropharmacology, the use of 
therapeutic antibodies in neurological disorders faces considerable challenges, 
particularly due to their limited bioavailability across the blood-brain barrier 
and often invasive administration protocols. In this context, the intranasal 
route has emerged as a promising noninvasive alternative for drug delivery, 
prompting direct brain access and rapid therapeutic effects, especially for 
larger molecules such as antibodies. Therefore, we aimed at the present study to 
gather information on the current state of research in the field and to 
summarize potential trends in methodology employed in such studies. The present 
systematic review identified a total of 1135 articles through databases such as 
Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed, ultimately including 31 articles for 
detailed analysis. The study methodology was preregistered at Open Science 
Framework platform. Our findings indicate that Alzheimer's disease is the most 
studied condition, and the hippocampus is the most frequently evaluated brain 
area. Monoclonal antibodies were the predominant therapeutic agents utilized, 
and significant variation in dosages used were noted. Furthermore, despite being 
high-molecular entities, antibodies can target both intracellular and 
extracellular proteins and eventually bring neuroprotective effects after 
intranasal administration. In summary, while this systematic review highlights 
the potential of intranasal antibodies for treating neurodegenerative diseases, 
there is significant room for additional studies on their mechanisms of action, 
long-term effects, and strategies to clinical translation.

This systematic bibliometric analysis evaluates the scientific evidence, impact, 
and trends of photobiomodulation (PBM) for central nervous system (CNS) 
disorders. Analyzing 150 relevant PubMed-indexed studies (including 46 clinical 
trials) up to September 2024, we demonstrate PBM's positive effects on the CNS. 
Key mechanisms include enhanced ATP synthesis, modulated nitric oxide signaling, 
improved neuronal excitability, suppressed oxidative stress, anti-inflammatory 
effects, and ion channel modulation. PBM offers therapeutic flexibility: 
shorter-wavelength, high-irradiance power lasers effectively target deep brain 
structures, while both modalities suit superficial cortical applications where 
fine spatial control is nonessential.Crucially, PBM induces long-lasting 
biological effects, highlighting significant potential for chronic CNS 
conditions like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and stroke. However, 
critical challenges hinder translation: optimizing disease-specific wavelengths 
and light sources (laser vs. LED, continuous vs. pulsed), and establishing 
standardized, long-term treatment protocols based on robust dose-response 
relationships. Resolving heterogeneity in parameters (energy density, power, 
potential thermal effects) is paramount for PBM to become a reliable 
neuromodulation tool. This analysis provides critical insights for advancing 
targeted PBM therapies in CNS.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe neurodegenerative condition characterized 
by progressive cognitive decline and behavioral changes. These symptoms are 
primarily driven by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques, tau tangles, 
and persistent neuroinflammation. Microglia, the brain's resident immune cells, 
play a crucial role in the disease's progression. Initially, these cells 
protectively respond to Aβ deposits, working to clear plaques and support 
neuronal health. However, prolonged activation of microglia leads to a 
transition from a neuroprotective state to a pro-inflammatory one, ultimately 
contributing to neuronal damage and worsening disease progression. This review 
explores the molecular mechanisms responsible for microglial dysfunction in AD, 
with a particular emphasis on key inflammatory pathways, including NF-κB, MAPK, 
and TLR4 signaling. These pathways drive the release of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines such as IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6, which further amplify 
neuroinflammation, disrupt synaptic plasticity, and contribute to neuronal loss. 
Additionally, emerging therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating microglial 
activity to reduce neuroinflammation and enhance Aβ clearance are examined. A 
key focus is placed on the future of AD research, emphasizing the importance of 
longitudinal studies to gain a deeper understanding of how microglia contribute 
to disease progression over time. The review also highlights the potential of 
personalized medicine, which seeks to tailor treatments based on an individual's 
unique genetic and environmental risk factors. Notably, genetic predispositions 
such as the APOE4 allele, along with environmental influences like air pollution 
and chronic infections, are identified as significant modulators of microglial 
activity. Given the complexity of AD, a comprehensive, multi-faceted approach 
will be essential for advancing research and developing more effective 
therapeutic interventions.

Medial ganglionic eminence-derived inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid (GABAergic) 
pallial interneurons (MGE-pINs) are essential regulators of cortical circuits, 
and their dysfunction is associated with neurological disorders. We developed 
human MGE-pINs from pluripotent stem cells for the treatment of drug-resistant 
epilepsy. Here, we analyzed xenografted MGE-pINs from human pluripotent stem 
cells (hMGE-pINs) over the lifespan of host mice in healthy and epileptic 
environments using single-nuclei RNA sequencing. Comparative transcriptomics 
against endogenous human brain datasets revealed that 97% of grafted cells 
developed into somatostatin (SST) and parvalbumin (PVALB) subtypes, including 
populations that exhibit selective vulnerability in Alzheimer's disease. 
Transplanted hMGE-pINs demonstrated rapid emergence of subclass features, 
progressing through distinct transcriptional states sequentially involving 
neuronal migration, synapse organization, and membrane maturation. We present 
molecular, electrophysiological, and morphological data that collectively 
confirm the derivation of diverse bona fide human SST and PVALB subtypes, 
providing a high-fidelity model to study hMGE-pIN development as well as a 
compositional atlas for regenerative cell therapy applications.

OBJECTIVES: Identify risk factors for profiles of caregiver burden, depression, 
and social disconnectedness among Alzheimer's disease and related dementias 
(ADRD) care partners.
METHODS: Latent Profile Analysis of baseline caregiver burden, depressive 
symptoms, and social disconnectedness among 95 ADRD care partners enrolled in a 
problem-solving intervention clinical trial. Multivariable linear regressions 
determined risk factors associated with these profiles. Intervention engagement 
was compared between profiles.
RESULTS: The Lower Distress group (n = 56) was characterized by lower burden, 
depressive symptoms, and disconnectedness compared to the Higher Distress group 
(n = 39). Lower Distress was associated with higher life satisfaction (p = 
0.019), more social support (p = 0.022), and less resentment towards caregiving 
(p < 0.001) than Higher Distress. Both groups had similar intervention 
attendance (median = 100 %) and engagement (median = 5 and 5.1 of 6).
CONCLUSION: Two profiles differed by well-being and social dynamics, but 
intervention engagement was similar. Multifaceted approaches are needed to 
improve health and well-being among ADRD care partners.

Identification of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), especially in its early phases, 
presents significant challenges due to the nonexistence of reliable biomarkers 
and effective treatments. Clinical trials for AD medications also suffer from 
high failure rates. Accurate diagnosis, prognosis determination, progression 
monitoring, and treatment effect assessment depend heavily on analysing various 
brain regions, including the Corpus Callosum (CC), Grey Matter (GM), Hippocampus 
(HC), Ventricle, and White Matter (WM). Among these, the Hippocampus plays a 
pivotal role in early detection. This study employs deep learning for 
classification and optimization techniques for segmenting the HC region to 
enable the AD diagnosis. The pre-processing of raw images involves histogram 
equalization and Otsu's thresholding methods. The research focuses on data 
collection and pre-processing as essential steps for advancing diagnostic 
methods. Segmentation and classification utilize Elephant Herding Optimization 
(EHO) and Crow Search Optimization (CSO) techniques in combination with the 
ResNet50 classifier. The results reveal that Crow Search Optimization achieves 
superior performance, with an accuracy of 92 %, surpassing Elephant Herding 
Optimization.

OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
lacking effective treatment. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and extracellular 
vesicles (EVs) have shown promise in degrading amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques due to 
their low immunogenicity and ability to mediate intercellular communication. 
This study investigates the therapeutic potential of EVs derived from human 
adipose tissue MSCs (hAT-MSCs) and preconditioned human adipose tissue MSCs in 
an in vitro AD model.
METHODS: MSCs characterized by flow cytometry and differentiation assays. 
hAT-MSCs stimulated with hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) or a cytokine complex (CC; 
TNF-α, IL-1β, IFN-γ). EVs were isolated via ultracentrifugation and analyzed by 
electron microscopy and Zetasizer. An in vitro AD model was established using 
neural-differentiated SH-SY5Y cells treated with Aβ peptides. Differentiation 
and Aβ degradation were assessed using immunocytochemistry, qRT-PCR, and ELISA.
RESULTS: EVs derived from cytokine complex stimulated hAT-MSCs significantly 
reduced Aβ plaque size and intensity compared to EVs from unstimulated or 
H₂O₂-stimulated cells. When immunocytochemistry images were analyzed using 
ImageJ, Aβ levels were found to be highest in the Alzheimer's group and lowest 
in the CC-EV group. According to ELISA analyses, no significant difference was 
observed between the Alzheimer's model (a1) and the hAT-MSC-EVs (a3) groups, 
whereas both the H₂O₂-EV (a4) and CC-EV (a5) groups showed a significant 
reduction compared to the control (**** P ≤ 0,0001) CONCLUSION: These findings 
suggest that cytokine-stimulated hAT-MSC-derived EVs effectively promote Aβ 
degradation and represent a promising cell-free therapeutic strategy for AD.

The rising incidence of brain diseases parallels the global trend of an aging 
population, with Alzheimer's disease (AD) being a leading neurodegenerative 
disorder characterized by memory loss, dementia, and cognitive decline. Despite 
extensive research, current treatments for AD remain largely symptomatic and 
have had limited success in halting disease progression, thereby shifting 
attention toward glial cells as promising therapeutic targets due to their 
emerging roles in AD pathogenesis. Astrocytes are involved in both beneficial 
and pathological processes in AD, such as cytokine secretion, Aβ removal, 
metabolic support, and tau pathology, with deficiency resulting in 
neuroinflammation and excitotoxicity. Microglia have dual functions in AD by 
phagocytosing amyloid plaques and limiting tau spread in initial phases but may 
develop a pro-inflammatory, neurodegenerative phenotype with progression of the 
disease. Oligodendrocytes and their precursors are involved in Aβ generation and 
myelin homeostasis, and their disturbance is responsible for white matter 
lesions and cognitive impairment, though their exact mechanisms are less clear. 
This review also examines emerging therapeutic strategies targeting glial cells, 
including modulating TREM2 pathways and novel drug candidates. These methods 
highlight the therapeutic value of the glial cells and provide valuable leads 
for furthering the treatment of AD by elucidating their changing roles in the 
course of the disease.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that causes cognitive 
impairment and loss of neurons. According to the Alzheimer's Association's 2022 
US report, the USA saw a 145% increase in AD-related fatalities from 2000 to 
2020, with an estimated financial burden of these disorders surpassing $1 
trillion annually. Its pathological features include neurofibrillary tangles and 
amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques. Although there is presently no treatment that may 
stop the growth of AD, new clinical trials have suggested that anti-amyloid 
disease-modifying drugs may reduce the progression of the illness. According to 
a recent study, Copper (Cu) dysregulation plays a crucial role in AD 
pathogenesis by causing oxidative stress and encouraging the aggregation of Aβ. 
Meanwhile, melatonin, a neurohormone with strong neuroprotective, antioxidant, 
and Cu chelation qualities, has drawn an interest due to its possible use for AD 
treatment. This review thoroughly summarizes the most recent research, including 
in vivo, in vitro, and human studies, and also examines the complex 
relationships among AD, melatonin, and Cu toxicity. We observe how an excess of 
Cu aggravates AD pathogenesis and how the special qualities of melatonin can 
counteract these effects. Melatonin is a promising molecule having a dual 
approach to address pathogenesis of AD by chelating excess Cu and lowering 
oxidative stress. Comprehending the interplay between Cu dysregulation and the 
protective mechanisms of melatonin may result in innovative therapies, providing 
promises for enhanced management of AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent form of neurodegenerative dementia, 
is characterized by progressive cognitive decline and neuronal loss. Despite 
advances in pharmacological treatments, current therapies remain limited in 
efficacy and often induce adverse effects. Increasing evidence highlights 
oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and disrupted neurotrophic 
signaling as key contributors to AD pathogenesis. Pulsed electromagnetic fields 
(PEMFs) are emerging as a non-invasive, multifactorial approach with promising 
biological effects. In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective potential 
of PEMFs in NGF-differentiated PC12 cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or 
amyloid-β peptide (Aβ), both of which model pathological features of AD. PEMF 
treatment significantly counteracted H2O2- and Aβ-induced cytotoxicity by 
restoring cell viability, reducing reactive oxygen species production, and 
improving catalase activity. Furthermore, PEMFs preserved the mitochondrial 
membrane potential and decreased caspase-3 activation and chromatin 
condensation. Mechanistically, PEMFs inhibited ERK phosphorylation and enhanced 
cAMP levels, CREB phosphorylation, and BDNF expression, pathways known to 
support neuronal survival and plasticity. In conclusion, these findings suggest 
that PEMFs modulate multiple stress response systems, promoting neuroprotection 
under oxidative and amyloidogenic conditions.

Neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases of the central nervous system 
are closely linked to aging and sustained oxidative and inflammatory stress. 
Polyphenols, plant-derived secondary metabolites, exhibit broad biological 
activities, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, the modulation 
of pathways such as PI3K/Akt, MAPK, Nrf2, and CREB, and the regulation of 
neurogenesis and microglial activation. This review focuses on the cell-specific 
actions of selected polyphenols in neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and 
oligodendrocytes within the context of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, 
and multiple sclerosis. A major limitation to the therapeutic use of polyphenols 
is their poor bioavailability, due to instability, low solubility, and limited 
blood-brain barrier penetration. Liposomal nanocarriers are explored as 
promising delivery systems to overcome these barriers. Both conventional and 
functionalized liposomes (e.g., PEGylated, receptor-targeted) are discussed, 
alongside in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrating enhanced efficacy compared 
to free compounds. Intranasal delivery is also presented as a viable alternative 
to oral administration. Overall, polyphenols offer great potential as 
neuroprotective agents, and liposome-based delivery platforms have the potential 
to significantly enhance their clinical potential, provided that key formulation 
and targeting issues are addressed.

Microglia-mediated neuroinflammation is a key driver of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). In AD, microglia are activated and trigger an increased secretion of 
pro-inflammatory factors. Rhein, an anthraquinone compound extracted from 
rhubarb, has been shown to reduce the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines 
including TNF-α and IL-1β in activated microglia. However, the mechanism of 
rhein on microglia-mediated neuroinflammation and neuronal damage in AD remains 
unclear. In this study, we found that rhein improved behavioral abnormalities in 
AD rats and reduced the levels of inflammatory factors such as IL-1β, iNOS, and 
NO in the brain of AD rats. In the LPS-induced microglial model, rhein 
significantly reduced the levels of inflammatory factors to improve 
neuroinflammation. Untargeted metabolomics showed that the reprogramming of 
glutamine metabolism occurred in M1 microglia. Targeted metabolomics and 13C, 
15N isotope tracing experiments demonstrated that rhein regulated the metabolite 
levels in the glutamine-aspartate-arginine metabolic pathway. Meanwhile, the 
upregulated expression of proteins such as GLS1 and GOT1 within this pathway was 
reversed by rhein. Furthermore, we found that the glutamine-aspartate-arginine 
metabolic pathway regulates the production of nitric oxide (NO, a 
neuroinflammatory mediator). Rhein alleviates neuronal damage by inhibiting the 
glutamine-aspartate-arginine-NO metabolic pathway. In conclusion, our study 
shows that rhein may inhibits NO production by regulating the 
glutamine-aspartate-arginine metabolic pathway in activated microglia, thereby 
inhibiting the neuroinflammation and neuronal damage in AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized 
by multifactorial pathogenesis, including oxidative stress, cholinergic 
dysfunction, β-amyloid (Aβ) aggregation, and neuroinflammation. In this study, 
we investigated the neuroprotective potential of the Pheka capsule (PC) formula, 
a traditional Thai polyherbal medicine comprising Oroxylum indicum (OI), 
Zingiber officinale (ZO), and Boesenbergia rotunda (BR). Phytochemical analysis 
by HPLC confirmed the presence of key bioactive compounds including baicalein, 
baicalin, oroxylin A, 6-gingerol, 6-shogaol, pinocembrin, and pinostrobin. The 
PC formula exhibited strong antioxidant activity, highly selective 
butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibition with a selectivity index (SI) of BChE > 
20, suppression of Aβ aggregation, and protection against H2O2-induced neuronal 
damage in vitro. Network pharmacology analysis identified multiple AD-relevant 
targets and pathways, including APP, GSK3B, CASP3, GAPDH, PTGS2, and PPARG, 
implicating the PC formula in modulating oxidative stress, apoptosis, and 
inflammation. Notably, OI emerged as the primary contributor to the formula's 
multitargeted actions. These findings support the therapeutic potential of the 
PC formula as a multitarget agent for AD, aligning with the growing interest in 
polypharmacological strategies for complex neurodegenerative diseases. Further 
in vivo and clinical studies are warranted to confirm its efficacy and safety.

Recent Advances in Antibody Therapy for Alzheimer's Disease: Focus on Bispecific 
Antibodies.

University Hospital, Seoul 03080, Republic of Korea.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) impacts more than half a million people worldwide, with 
no cure available. The regulatory approval of three anti-amyloid monoclonal 
antibodies (mAbs), including aducanumab, lecanemab, and donanemab, has 
established immunotherapy as a therapeutic approach to modify disease 
progression. Its multifactorial pathology, which involves amyloid-β (Aβ) 
plaques, tau neurofibrillary tangles, neuroinflammation, and cerebrovascular 
dysfunction, limits the efficacy of single-target therapies. The restricted 
blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration and amyloid-related imaging abnormalities 
(ARIA), together with small treatment effects, demonstrate the necessity for 
advanced biologic therapies. Protein engineering advancements have created 
bispecific antibodies that bind to pathological proteins (e.g., Aβ, tau) and BBB 
shuttle receptors to boost brain delivery and dual therapeutic effects. This 
review combines existing information about antibody-based therapy in AD by 
focusing on bispecific antibody formats and their preclinical and clinical 
development, as well as biomarker-based patient selection and upcoming 
combination strategies. The combination of rationally designed bispecific 
antibodies with fluid and imaging biomarkers could show potential for overcoming 
existing therapeutic challenges and delivering significant clinical advantages.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and schizophrenia are traditionally considered distinct 
clinical entities, yet growing evidence highlights substantial overlap in their 
molecular and neuroinflammatory pathogenesis. This review explores current 
insights into the shared and divergent mechanisms underlying these disorders, 
with emphasis on neuroinflammation, autophagy dysfunction, blood-brain barrier 
(BBB) disruption, and cognitive impairment. We examine key signaling pathways, 
particularly spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK), the mechanistic (or mammalian) target 
of rapamycin (mTOR), and the S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B)/receptor for 
advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) axis, that link glial activation, 
excitatory/inhibitory neurotransmitter imbalances, and impaired proteostasis 
across both disorders. Specific biomarkers such as S100B, matrix 
metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), and soluble RAGE show promise for stratifying 
disease subtypes and predicting treatment response. Moreover, psychiatric 
symptoms frequently precede cognitive decline in both AD and schizophrenia, 
suggesting that mood and behavioral disturbances may serve as early diagnostic 
indicators. The roles of autophagic failure, cellular senescence, and impaired 
glymphatic clearance are also explored as contributors to chronic inflammation 
and neurodegeneration. Current treatments, including cholinesterase inhibitors 
and antipsychotics, primarily offer symptomatic relief, while emerging 
therapeutic approaches target upstream molecular drivers, such as mTOR 
inhibition and RAGE antagonism. Finally, we discuss the future potential of 
personalized medicine guided by genetic, neuroimaging, and biomarker profiles to 
optimize diagnosis and treatment strategies in both AD and schizophrenia. A 
greater understanding of the pathophysiological convergence between these 
disorders may pave the way for cross-diagnostic interventions and improved 
clinical outcomes.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is a progressive 
neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory loss and cognitive decline. 
In addition to its two major pathological hallmarks, extracellular amyloid beta 
(Aβ) plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), recent evidence 
highlights the critical roles of mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation 
in disease progression. Aβ impairs mitochondrial function, which, in part, can 
subsequently trigger inflammatory cascades, creating a vicious cycle of neuronal 
damage. Estrogen receptors (ERs) are widely expressed throughout the brain, and 
the sex hormone 17β-estradiol (E2) exerts neuroprotection through both 
anti-inflammatory and mitochondrial mechanisms. While E2 exhibits 
neuroprotective properties, its mechanisms against Aβ toxicity remain 
incompletely understood. In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective 
effects of E2 against Aβ-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation 
in primary cortical neurons, with a particular focus on the role of 
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). We found that E2 treatment significantly 
increased phosphorylated AMPK and upregulated the expression of mitochondrial 
biogenesis regulator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 
coactivator-1 α (PGC-1α), leading to improved mitochondrial respiration. In 
contrast, Aβ suppressed AMPK and PGC-1α signaling, impaired mitochondrial 
function, activated the pro-inflammatory nuclear factor kappa-light-chain 
enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), and reduced neuronal viability. E2 
pretreatment also rescued Aβ-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, suppressed NF-κB 
activation, and, importantly, prevented the decline in neuronal viability. 
However, the pharmacological inhibition of AMPK using Compound C (CC) abolished 
these protective effects, resulting in mitochondrial collapse, elevated 
inflammation, and cell death, highlighting AMPK's critical role in mediating 
E2's actions. Interestingly, while NF-κB inhibition using BAY 11-7082 partially 
restored mitochondrial respiration, it failed to prevent Aβ-induced 
cytotoxicity, suggesting that E2's full neuroprotective effects rely on broader 
AMPK-dependent mechanisms beyond NF-κB suppression alone. Together, these 
findings establish AMPK as a key mediator of E2's protective effects against 
Aβ-driven mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation, providing new 
insights into estrogen-based therapeutic strategies for AD.

Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 
Parkinson's disease (PD), are characterized by progressive neuronal dysfunction 
and loss and represent a significant global health challenge. Oxidative stress, 
neuroinflammation, and neurotransmitter dysregulation, particularly affecting 
acetylcholine (ACh) and monoamines, are key hallmarks of these conditions. The 
current therapeutic strategies targeting cholinergic and monoaminergic systems 
have some limitations, highlighting the need for novel approaches. Metallodrugs, 
especially ruthenium and platinum complexes, are gaining attention for their 
therapeutic use. Among metal complexes, gold(I) and silver(I) N-heterocyclic 
carbene (NHC) complexes exhibit several biological activities, but their 
application in NDDs, particularly as monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, remains 
largely unexplored. To advance the understanding of this field, we designed, 
synthesized, and evaluated the biological activity of a new series of Au(I) and 
Ag(I) complexes stabilized by NHC ligands and bearing a carboxylate salt of 
tert-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc)-N-protected proline as an anionic ligand. Through in 
silico and in vitro studies, we assessed their potential as acetylcholinesterase 
(AChE) and MAO inhibitors, as well as their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory 
properties, aiming to contribute to the development of potential novel 
therapeutic agents for NDD management.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive cognitive decline 
strongly associated with impaired adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN). Mounting 
evidence suggests that this impairment results from both the intrinsic 
dysfunction of neural stem cells (NSCs)-such as transcriptional alterations in 
quiescent states-and extrinsic niche disruptions, including the dysregulation of 
the Reelin signaling pathway and heightened neuroinflammation. Notably, AHN 
deficits may precede classical amyloid-β and Tau pathology, supporting their 
potential as early biomarkers of disease progression. In this review, we 
synthesize recent advances in therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring AHN, 
encompassing pharmacological agents, natural products, and non-pharmacological 
interventions such as environmental enrichment and dietary modulation. Emerging 
approaches-including BDNF-targeted nanocarriers, NSC-derived extracellular 
vesicles, and multimodal lifestyle interventions-highlight the translational 
promise of enhancing neurogenesis in models of familial AD. We further propose 
the Neurogenesis Impairment Index (NII)-a novel composite metric that quantifies 
hippocampal neurogenic capacity relative to amyloid burden, while adjusting for 
demographic and cognitive variables. By integrating neurogenic potential, 
cognitive performance, and pathological load, NII provides a framework for 
stratifying disease severity and guiding personalized therapeutic approaches. 
Despite ongoing challenges-such as interspecies differences in neurogenesis 
rates and the limitations of stem cell-based therapies-this integrative 
perspective offers a promising avenue to bridge mechanistic insights with 
clinical innovation in the development of next-generation AD treatments.

University of Lodz, 92215 Lodz, Poland.

Adenylyl cyclases (ACs) are key regulators of cyclic adenosine monophosphate 
(cAMP) signaling-a pathway critical for neuroregeneration, synaptic plasticity, 
and neuronal survival. In both the central and peripheral nervous systems, 
injury-induced activation of ACs promotes axonal outgrowth and functional 
recovery through the stimulation of protein kinase A (PKA), exchange proteins 
directly activated by cAMP (Epac), and cAMP-response element-binding protein 
(CREB). Among the various AC isoforms, calcium-sensitive AC1, AC8, and AC5, as 
well as bicarbonate-responsive soluble AC (sAC), have emerged as crucial 
mediators of neuroplasticity and axon regeneration. These isoforms coordinate 
diverse cellular responses-including gene transcription, cytoskeletal 
remodeling, and neurotransmitter release-to metabolic, synaptic, and 
injury-related signals. Dysregulation of AC activity has been implicated in the 
pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, 
Alzheimer's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, as well as in chronic 
pain syndromes. Pharmacological modulation of cAMP levels through AC activation, 
phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibition, or pituitary adenylyl cyclase-activating 
polypeptide (PACAP) receptor signaling has shown therapeutic promise in 
preclinical models by enhancing neurogenesis, remyelination, and synaptic 
repair. Conversely, targeted inhibition of specific AC isoforms, particularly 
AC1, has demonstrated efficacy in reducing maladaptive plasticity and 
neuropathic pain. This review highlights the diverse roles of ACs in neuronal 
function and injury response and discusses emerging strategies for their 
therapeutic targeting.

This study investigated the potential neuroprotective mechanisms of porcine 
brain enzyme hydrolysate (PBEH) against Alzheimer's disease pathology using 
differentiated SH-SY5Y cells. Differentiated neuronal cells were treated with 40 
μM amyloid-β(1-42; Aβ) to induce neurotoxicity, followed by PBEH treatment 
(12.5-400 μg/mL), Com-A (peptide-based neuroprotective supplement; 200 μg/mL) 
treatment, and Com-B (herbal extract known for improving memory function; 100 
μg/mL) treatment. Key assessments included cell viability, Aβ aggregation in 
adding 10 μM Aβ, amyloidogenic proteins (APP, BACE), synaptic markers (BDNF, 
ERK), apoptotic markers (BAX/BCL-2, caspase-3), oxidative stress (reactive 
oxygen species (ROS)), cholinergic function (ChAT, AChE), MAPK signaling (JNK, 
p38), and neuroinflammation (IL-1β). PBEH contained high concentrations of amino 
acids, including L-lysine (32.3 mg/g), L-leucine (42.4 mg/g), L-phenylalanine 
(30.0 mg/g) and the PSIS peptide (86.9 μg/g). Treatment up to 400 μg/mL showed 
no cytotoxicity and had cognitive protection effects up to 152% under Aβ stress 
(p < 0.05). PBEH significantly attenuated Aβ aggregation, decreased APP (28%) 
and BACE (51%) expression, enhanced synaptic function through increased BDNF, 
and restored ERK phosphorylation (p < 0.05). Anti-apoptotic effects included a 
76% reduction in the BAX/BCL-2 ratio, a 47% decrease in caspase-3, and a 56% 
reduction in ROS levels. Cholinergic function showed restoration via increased 
ChAT activity (p < 0.01) and decreased AChE activity (p < 0.05). PBEH reduced 
IL-1β levels by 70% and suppressed JNK/p38 phosphorylation (p < 0.05). While 
Com-A enhanced BDNF and Com-B showed anti-inflammatory effects, PBEH 
demonstrated activity across multiple pathway markers. In conclusion, these 
findings suggest that PBEH may enable neuronal preservation through 
multi-pathway modulation, establishing foundational evidence for further 
mechanistic investigation in cognitive enhancement applications.

Foeniculum vulgare Mill. (Apiaceae) is an aromatic medicinal plant known for its 
anti-inflammatory, antispasmodic, antiseptic, carminative, diuretic, and 
analgesic properties. This study aimed to investigate the effects of F. vulgare 
essential oil (FVEO; 25, 150, and 300 μL/L) on the cognitive performance and 
brain oxidative stress in a scopolamine (SCOP; 100 μM)-induced zebrafish model 
of cognitive impairment. Additionally, the pharmacokinetic properties and 
bioactivity profiles of the main FVEO constituents were predicted to be used in 
silico tools, including SwissADME, pkCSM, PASS online, and ADMETlab 2.0. 
Behavioral assays, novel tank diving test (NTT), Y-maze, and novel object 
recognition (NOR) test, were used to evaluate anxiety-like behavior, spatial 
memory, and recognition memory, respectively. Biochemical assessments of 
acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and oxidative stress biomarkers were also 
conducted. The results demonstrated that FVEO significantly improved cognitive 
performance in SCOP-treated zebrafish, normalized AChE activity, and reduced 
oxidative stress in the brain. These findings suggest the therapeutic potential 
of FVEO in ameliorating memory impairment and oxidative damage associated with 
neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD).

An important field of research in medicinal and organic chemistry involves 
halogen-containing heterocyclic synthones, which form the backbone of more 
complex organic compounds. This study aimed to design and synthesize 28 novel 
derivatives of 7-aryl-2,3-dihydropyrrolo[2,1-b]quinazolin-9(1H)-one. The 
derivatives were created from 7-bromoquinoline intermediates to evaluate their 
potential as cholinesterase inhibitors for treating neurodegenerative diseases 
such as Alzheimer's disease. The conditions for the Suzuki-Miyaura 
cross-coupling reaction were optimized to improve yield and purity. The 
derivatives were evaluated for their anticholinesterase activity using Ellman's 
method, revealing that it most effectively inhibited cholinesterase within the 
micromolar range. 
7-(3-Chloro-4-fluorophenyl)-2,3-dihydropyrrolo[2,1-b]quinazolin-9(1H)-one 
derivative exhibited the highest inhibitory potency, with an IC50 value of 6.084 
± 0.26 μM. Additionally, molecular dynamics simulations provided insight into 
how this lead compound interacts with the enzyme, suggesting its potential as a 
drug candidate for Alzheimer's disease.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder that leads to 
memory loss and changes in mental and behavioral functions in elderly 
individuals. A major pathological feature of AD is the aggregation of 
amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, along with oxidative stress, inducing neurocellular 
apoptosis in the brain. Gobaishi (Galla chinensis), a traditional herbal 
medicine, has gained considerable attention for its constituents and potent 
therapeutic properties, particularly its strong inhibitory activity against Aβ 
fibril formation. In this study, we investigated the anti-Aβ aggregation effects 
of Gobaishi and its active constituents. We isolated two compounds by employing 
Thioflavin T (ThT) assay-guided fractionation, which were identified through 
various spectroscopic methods as pentagalloyl glucose (PGG) and methyl gallate 
(MG). Evaluation of their anti-Aβ aggregation effects revealed that PGG and MG 
contribute 1.5% and 0.7% of the activity of Gobaishi, respectively. In addition, 
PGG demonstrated significantly stronger DPPH radical scavenging activity (EC50 = 
1.16 µM) compared to MG (EC50 = 6.44 µM). At a concentration of 30 µM, PGG 
significantly reduced the Aβ-induced cytotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cell lines compared 
to MG. Based on these findings, both Gobaishi and its active compound PGG are 
proposed as promising candidates for further investigation as potent 
anti-amyloidogenic agents in AD management.

In this study, we analyzed the essential oils (EOs) extracted by steam 
distillation from the leaves and flowers of Parthenium hysterophorus L., grown 
in three different locations in southern Ecuador: Espíndola (ESP), Loja (LOJ) 
and Quilanga (QUI). Approximately 97.45%, 98.27% and 95.99% of the oil 
constituents were identified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) 
and gas chromatography-flame ionization detection (GC-FID). Sesquiterpene 
hydrocarbons were predominant in the EOs. The most representative constituents 
of the sample from ESP were germacrene D (35.08%), myrcene (11.32%), 
(E)-β-ocimene (10.21%), (E)-caryophyllene (7.90%), 
germacra-4(15),5,10(14)-trien-1-α-ol (5.18%) and (E, E)-α-farnesene (4.99%), 
with an AChE IC50 of 14.78 and with 16.38 and 93.16 µg/mL from ABTS and DPPH, 
respectively. The EOs from LOJ were characterized by the abundant presence of 
germacrene D (28.30%), myrcene (13.95%), (E)-β-ocimene (10.51%) and 
isolongifolan-7-α-ol (8.26%), with an AChE IC50 of 16.65 and with 36.18 and 
158.43 µg/mL from ABTS and DPPH, respectively. Finally, the EOs from QUI 
contained germacrene D (32.20%), myrcene (13.36%), (E)-β-ocimene (8.54%), (E, 
E)-α-farnesene (6.77%), germacra-4(15),5,10(14)-trien-1-α-ol (5.69%) and 
(E)-caryophyllene (5.37%), with an AChE IC50 of 10.69 and with 14.50 and 92.98 
µg/mL from ABTS and DPPH, respectively. This study identifies chemotypic 
variation in P. hysterophorus collected from different locations and, for the 
first time, the AChE inhibitor was evaluated. These findings provide a 
scientific basis for the clinical application of P. hysterophorus EOs in the 
future treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

Background/Objectives: Cognitive impairment and vestibular dysfunction commonly 
co-occur in older adults and may share overlapping neuroanatomical pathways. 
Understanding their association may enhance the early identification of 
cognitive decline using clinically feasible vestibular assessments. This study 
aimed to examine the relationship between vestibular dysfunction and early 
cognitive impairment, assess the diagnostic accuracy of vestibular markers, and 
explore the association of subjective dizziness and balance measures with 
cognitive performance. Methods: Our cross-sectional study included 90 
participants aged ≥60 years, classified into cognitively healthy, mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI), and early Alzheimer's disease (AD) groups. Cognitive function 
was assessed using the MoCA and the MMSE; vestibular function was evaluated via 
posturography sway and horizontal vHIT gain. Subjective dizziness and balance 
were measured using the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI), gait speed, and 
eyes-closed balance time. The data were analyzed using SPSS v24 with ANOVA, 
Pearson correlations, linear regression, and ROC curve analyses. Results: 
Significant group differences were found across the cognitive and vestibular 
scores (MoCA: p = 0.001. Sway: p = 0.001. vHIT: p = 0.001). vHIT gain and 
posturography sway independently predicted the MoCA and MMSE scores (adjusted R2 
= 0.68 and 0.65, respectively). The ROC analysis showed a strong diagnostic 
accuracy for posturography sway (AUC = 0.87) and vHIT gain (AUC = 0.82). 
Conclusions: Vestibular dysfunction is significantly associated with early 
cognitive impairment and may serve as a useful clinical marker for cognitive 
screening in older adults.

Euterpe oleracea Martius, also popularly known as açaí palm, is a palm tree of 
the Aracaceae family widely found in the Amazon region. Traditional plant use 
reports indicate the beneficial effects of açaí juice on fever, pain, and flu. 
Moreover, many studies have demonstrated the pharmacological potential of açaí, 
mainly the pulp and seed of the fruit, due to its chemical composition, which 
significantly consists of polyphenols. In recent years, there has been a growing 
interest in investigating the neuroprotective effects of açaí, with the 
potential for the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, such 
as Alzheimer's disease, mainly due to the increasing aging of the population 
that has contributed to the increase in the number of individuals affected by 
this disease that has no cure. Therefore, this review aims to evaluate the 
potential role of açaí fruit in preventing or treating cognitive deficits, 
highlighting its potential in Alzheimer's disease therapy. Preclinical in vivo 
and in vitro pharmacological studies were utilized to investigate the learning 
and memory effects of the pulp and seed of the açaí fruit, focusing on 
antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic, and autophagy restoration 
actions.

The distribution of Amaryllidaceae alkaloids, with a focus on their 
chemodiversity, has been reported previously, but not at a genera-wide diversity 
level. This review provides a comprehensive survey of the occurrence of 
Amaryllidaceae alkaloids across the genera of the Amaryllidaceae family. This 
survey is taxonomically guided by the National Center for Biotechnology 
Information (NCBI) Taxonomy Browser, with targeted keyword searches conducted in 
the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) SciFinder-n and PubMed. The family 
Amaryllidaceae comprises over 1214 species across three subfamilies: 
Agapanthoideae (1 genus, 5 species), Allioideae (3 genera plus 11 subgenera, 617 
species), and Amaryllidoideae (58 genera plus 13 subgenera, 592 species). 
Amaryllidaceae alkaloids have been identified exclusively in 36 of the 58 genera 
and 6 of the 13 subgenera within the Amaryllidoideae subfamily. To date, more 
than 600 Amaryllidaceae alkaloids have been isolated, predominantly from this 
subfamily-hence the designation "Amaryllidaceae alkaloids". These alkaloids 
display a wide spectrum of biological activities, including acetylcholinesterase 
inhibition, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antimicrobial, antidiabetic, and 
anticancer effects. A notable example is galanthamine (also known as 
galantamine), an FDA-approved drug marketed under the brand names Reminyl™ 
(Janssen Research Foundation, Beerse, Belgium, 2001) and Razadyne™ (Johnson & 
Johnson Pharmaceutical Research, New Brunswick, NJ, USA, 2004) for the treatment 
of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease, due to its potent 
acetylcholinesterase-inhibitory activity. Galanthamine has been isolated from 
species belonging to the genera Cyrtanthus, Galanthus, Leucojum, Lycoris, 
Narcissus, Ungernia, Chlidanthus, Crinum, Eucharis, Eustephia, Pancratium, and 
Phaedranassa. Lycorine is another widely distributed alkaloid found across 
multiple genera, and it has been extensively studied for its diverse 
bioactivities. Given the remarkable chemical diversity and bioactivity of 
Amaryllidaceae alkaloids, along with the many underexplored genera and species, 
further research into Amaryllidaceae species and their alkaloids is strongly 
warranted to support the discovery and development of novel therapeutic agents.

Magnesium is an essential mineral involved in hundreds of biochemical reactions, 
with particular relevance to maintaining neural homeostasis, modulating 
neurotransmitter systems, and regulating inflammatory and oxidative stress 
mechanisms. This comprehensive review aims to evaluate the potential role of 
magnesium in the pathophysiology and treatment of three prevalent neurological 
and psychiatric disorders-depression, migraine, and Alzheimer's disease-as well 
as its broader implications for cognitive health. Current research suggests that 
magnesium deficiency is associated with the development of depression, as 
magnesium influences glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission, as well as 
the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, both of which 
play critical roles in stress responses and mood regulation. Additionally, 
magnesium's anti-inflammatory properties may contribute to the alleviation of 
depressive symptoms. In the context of migraine's pathophysiology, magnesium 
plays a role in regulating cerebral vascular tone, modulating the 
trigeminovascular system, and reducing neuronal hyperexcitability, which may 
explain the observed correlation between magnesium levels and the incidence of 
migraines. Regarding Alzheimer's disease, preclinical and epidemiological 
studies suggest that magnesium may contribute to modulating neurodegenerative 
processes and preserving cognitive function; however, due to the heterogeneity 
of the current findings, further longitudinal and interventional studies are 
necessary to determine its precise clinical relevance. This review aims to 
enhance the understanding of the relationship between magnesium and these 
disorders through a narrative review of relevant clinical studies. The findings 
may provide insights into the potential therapeutic applications of magnesium 
and guide the future directions of the research into the prevention and 
treatment of depression, migraine, and Alzheimer's disease and overall cognitive 
health.

In neurons, mitochondria generate energy through ATP production, thereby 
sustaining the high energy demands of the central nervous system (CNS). 
Mitochondrial dysfunction within the CNS was implicated in the pathogenesis and 
progression of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, 
Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis, 
often involving altered mitochondrial dynamics like fragmentation and functional 
impairment. Accordingly, mitochondrial targeting represents an alternative 
therapeutic strategy for the treatment of these disorders. Current standard drug 
treatments present limitations due to adverse effects associated with their 
chronic use. Therefore, in recent years, nutraceuticals, natural compounds 
exhibiting diverse biological activities, have garnered significant attention 
for their potential to treat these diseases. It has been shown that these 
compounds represent safe and easily available sources for the development of 
innovative therapeutics, and by modulating mitochondrial function, 
nutraceuticals offer a promising approach to address neurodegenerative 
pathologies. We referred to approximately 200 articles published between 2020 
and 2025, identified through a focused search across PubMed, Google Scholar, and 
Scopus using keywords such as "nutraceutical," "mitochondrial dysfunction," and 
"neurodegenerative diseases. The purpose of this review is to examine how 
mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to the genesis and progression of 
neurodegenerative diseases. Also, we discuss recent advances in mitochondrial 
targeting using nutraceuticals, focusing on their mechanisms of action related 
to mitochondrial biogenesis, fusion, fission, bioenergetics, oxidative stress, 
calcium homeostasis, membrane potential, and mitochondrial DNA stability.

BACKGROUND: We explored the associations of comorbidities with cognitive 
deterioration, institutionalization, and mortality in biomarker-confirmed 
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) dementia.
METHODS: We conducted a Swedish Register-based cohort study consisting of 10,857 
people (mean age 74 years) with diagnosed dementia and positive AD biomarkers 
(CSF Aβ42/P-tau181 ratio). Cognitive function was measured by mini-mental state 
examination (MMSE). Comorbidities by human body organ systems (e.g., diseases of 
the circulatory system) and six selected comorbidities: type-2 diabetes (T2DM), 
ischemic heart disease (IHD), stroke, chronic kidney disease (CKD), inflammatory 
bowel disease, and depression, were analyzed. Multistate Cox regressions 
assessed the associations of comorbidities with cognitive deterioration, 
institutionalization, and death.
RESULTS: Only T2DM and IHD were associated with cognitive deterioration. Mental 
disorders, T2DM, and stroke were linked to higher hazards of 
institutionalization. Endocrine-metabolic disorders, circulatory system 
diseases, and CKD were associated with higher mortality rates.
CONCLUSIONS: Comorbidities may help inform the prognosis of biomarker-confirmed 
AD dementia.

BACKGROUND: Diffusible Aβ oligomers (oAβ) confer cytotoxicity in Alzheimer's 
disease. The dynamic complexity of this hydrophobic analyte means few 
immunoassays exist to quantify oAβ in CSF and plasma.
METHODS: We characterized antibody 71A1 to a cyclized dimer of Aβ9-18 for oAβ 
preference over monomers by surface plasmon resonance. We improved an earlier 
bead-based immunoassay by using 71A1 streptavidin plates for capture and 
N-terminal antibody 3D6 for detection. Numerous controls systematically 
validated accuracy.
RESULTS: 71A1 showed highly selective binding kinetics to Aβ oligomers over 
monomers. It enriched bioactive oligomers from AD brain that altered neuronal 
excitatory currents and calcium transients. 71A1/3D6 immunoassay exhibited 
specificity and reproducibility in human biofluids. CSF oAβ levels correlated 
positively with CSF tau and phosphorylated-tau-181. APP and PS1 FAD mutations 
increased oAβ levels in human neuronal media.
CONCLUSIONS: CSF oAβ levels rise in concert with rising tau levels. A new 
plate-based ELISA offers improved consistency, less sample volume, and lower 
cost, thus better suited to quantify this challenging analyte.

Polyscias fruticosa leaves have been used in traditional medicine to aid in the 
therapy of brain and nerve-related disorders, including dementia. However, the 
evidences for the effects and mechanisms of P. fruticosa leaf extract (PFLE) and 
its constituents in improving dementia remain unclear. This study aims to 
evaluate the ameliorative effect of PFLE in aluminum chloride-induced 
neurotoxicity Drosophila melanogaster model. Simultaneously, the 
dementia-improving mechanisms of PFLE's compounds were explored by computational 
pharmacological analysis. Results showed that D. melanogaster exposed to 1.0, 
2.0, and 4.0 mg/mL PFLE or 0.1 mg/mL donepezil hydrochloride had significant 
improvements in lifespan, memory, motor behavior, and oxidative stress markers, 
including decreased malondialdehyde level and increased glutathione level in 
flies' homogenates. Also, PFLE had acetylcholinesterase inhibitory ability with 
an IC50 value of 266.10 µg/mL. Applying the UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS technique, 36 
compounds were identified in the PFLE. Among these, 25 compounds, including acid 
amines, flavonoids, saponins, choline, piperine, and vitamin B1, have been 
demonstrated potential for supporting the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Interestingly, molecular docking study indicated that many of the compounds are 
agents of prominent targets in dementia treatment including N-methyl-D-aspartate 
(NMDA) receptor and cholinesterase, in which polyscioside A-E are the main 
components of the PFLE that may be responsible for the NMDA receptor 
antagonistic and anticholinesterase activities. These compounds have favorable 
physiochemical properties and drug-likeliness. This study suggested the 
potential of the PFLE and its compounds in the prophylactic and treatment of 
neurodegenerative pathologies, including AD, and laid the foundation for further 
studies.

Risk factors for developing dementia include type 2 diabetes and obesity. 
Streptozotocin (STZ) intracerebroventricularly (icv) treated rats are a 
well-accepted animal model for the sporadic Alzheimer`s disease (sAD). STZ-icv 
treatment results in an insulin-resistant brain state, cognitive deficits, and 
reduced hippocampal adult neurogenesis (AN). As the antidiabetic drug 
liraglutide (LIR) has been shown to improve AN, and spatial learning in an AD 
mouse model, we have investigated the effects of LIR treatment on spatial and 
fear-motivated learning, AN, and gene expression profiles in STZ-icv treated 
rats. Male Wistar rats were injected icv with STZ (f.c. 3 mg/kg) or vehicle. Two 
months later, four weeks of subcutaneous treatment with LIR (0.3 mg/kg) began. 
Cognitive abilities were assessed with the Morris water maze (MWM) and passive 
avoidance (PA) test. We performed quantitative immunohistochemistry to evaluate 
AN, and quantitative real-time PCR to determine the expression levels of genes 
involved in insulin signaling, glucose uptake, and neuroinflammation. STZ-icv 
rats showed significantly impaired spatial learning performance in the MWM and 
fear-motivated memory deficits in the PA test accompanied by reduced AN, 
downregulated insulin system- and glucose metabolism-related genes in the 
hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. LIR treatment did not reverse these cognitive 
deficits of STZ-icv rats in the MWM, and did even worsen PA performance. 
However, LIR partially restored dysregulated gene expression, however, 
additionally stimulated neuroinflammation. Refined experimental designs, e.g., 
refined dosing, should help to further clarify the therapeutic potential of LIR 
in the future.

BACKGROUND: Blood-based biomarkers (BBM) of neurodegenerative diseases are 
emerging as cost-effective tools in the differential diagnostics of Alzheimer's 
disease and other dementias. Scarce data exist about factors explaining BBM 
variation in population-based cohorts, and their intergenerational associations 
are unknown. This study aimed to characterise BBM distributions among a 
population-based cohort, investigate the association of a wide array of factors 
with BBM both in midlife and old age, and investigate intergenerational 
associations of BBM.
METHODS: We measured BBM detecting amyloid β and tau pathologies, including 
amyloid β42, amyloid β40, and phosphorylated Tau (pTau)-217, as well as glial 
fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neurofilament light chain (NfL) in the 
multigenerational Young Finns Study participants (n=1237, age 41-56 years) and 
their parents (n=814, age 59-90 years) using the Quanterix Simoa HD-X analyser. 
Standard statistical methods were used to examine the associations between BBM 
and age, sex, genetic factors, a plethora of cardiometabolic markers, liver and 
kidney function, and lifestyle factors, as well as their intergenerational 
associations.
FINDINGS: Increased age was associated with adverse BBM concentrations. Of the 
various investigated factors, the most robust associations towards adverse BBM 
concentration were found for APOE ε4 carrier status among parents (amyloid 
β42:40 ratio, pTau-217, and GFAP) and high serum creatinine concentration in 
both generations (pTau-217, GFAP, and NfL). Several factors related to glucose 
metabolism and dyslipidaemia were negatively associated with all BBM, but 
adjusting for BMI diluted many of these associations. Statistically significant 
intergenerational correlations ranged from 0·20 to 0·33 and were mostly observed 
between mothers and offspring in pTau-217, GFAP, and NfL. No intergenerational 
correlations existed in amyloid β42:40 ratio.
INTERPRETATION: We identified several factors that might influence BBM 
concentrations, parental transmission being one of them. For reliable use of BBM 
in clinical practice, it is important to identify which factors directly link to 
amyloid β and tau pathology and which factors influence BBM concentrations due 
to other physiological processes.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are conditions 
with progressive cognitive decline. Still, people living with late-stage ADRD 
(PLWD) have been reported to exhibit transient recovery of communication or 
behavioural abilities that had seemingly been lost. These lucid episodes (LEs) 
are underinvestigated and poorly understood. This study aims to advance 
scientific understanding of the incidence, prevalence and predictors of LEs and 
assess from family caregivers if LEs are associated with changes they make in 
care planning or experiences with burden, distress or grief.
METHODS: This study recruited 545 caregivers from five ADRD-related registries 
in the USA. Eligibility included caregivers over 18 years who currently provide 
care to someone with moderate to very severe ADRD and can complete online 
questionnaires. Using a longitudinal observational study design, consented 
caregivers will be assessed monthly for 1 year using online questionnaires that 
inquire about witnessing LEs. If witnessed, the context and content of the LE is 
reported. Changes in caregiver decision-making about care for the PLWD, and 
caregiver burden, distress and grief are assessed at baseline, 6 and 12 months.
ANALYSIS: Analysis of baseline data will assess descriptive aspects of LEs that 
are currently unknown (eg, prevalence, content, antecedents, duration). 
Longitudinal analysis will examine the incidence of LEs, characteristics of PLWD 
and caregivers that are predictors of episodes, and the associations between LEs 
and caregiver outcomes (eg, burden, distress, grief).
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study is being conducted in accordance with all 
Federal Policies for the Protection of Human Subjects. The protocol has been 
approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board (ID 22-006861). Findings 
will be presented at scientific conferences and disseminated through journal 
publications and outreach efforts with collaborating partners invested in brain 
health and caregiver support.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: In Zhuang medicine, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is 
termed "Qiaowuwa', attributed to the accumulation of heat-toxin in the Huolu 
(Fire Pathway) and malnutrition of Qiaowu. The dried tuberous roots of Tinospora 
sagittata (Oliv.) Gagnep., known as "Tinosporae Radix', are documented in Zhuang 
medicinal texts for their bitter flavor and cold nature, which clear heat-toxin, 
regulate Huolu, and treat inflammatory disorders. Despite its established 
clinical efficacy, the anti-neuroinflammatory mechanisms of this ethnomedicine 
remain uncharacterized.
AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the therapeutic effects of Tinosporae Radix 
ethanolic extract (EETs) against neuroinflammation and to explore its underlying 
mechanisms.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: UPLC-Q-TOF/MS analysis identified the primary chemical 
constituents of EETs. A neuroinflammatory mouse model was established via 
intraperitoneal injection of LPS (250 μg/kg). Following EETs intervention, the 
mRNA and protein expression levels of inflammatory mediators in cerebral tissues 
were quantified using qRT-PCR and ELISA, respectively. Immunofluorescence was 
used to detect Iba-1 expression in the mouse brain to assess microglial 
activation. Behavioral assessments (Open field, Novel object recognition, Morris 
water maze) were conducted to examine spatial learning and memory in 
neuroinflammatory mice. Neuronal apoptosis was analyzed by histopathological 
examination (HE/Nissl staining), TUNEL assay, and Western blotting of 
apoptosis-related proteins (Bcl-2, Bax, Caspase-3). Network pharmacology 
predicted EETs' bioactive targets and pathways. Proteomics identified 
differentially expressed proteins in neuroinflamed brain tissues. Integrated 
network pharmacology-proteomics analysis elucidated EETs' anti-neuroinflammatory 
mechanisms.
RESULTS: EETs contained 126 comprises, predominantly terpenoids (17), alkaloids 
(16), and flavonoids (10). The extract significantly inhibited LPS-induced 
neuroinflammatory responses. At the animal level, it reduced pro-inflammatory 
(IL-1β, TNF-α) and elevated anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-10) in brain 
tissue. It also suppressed excessive microglial hyperactivation, ameliorated 
hippocampal neuronal damage, and enhanced cognitive function in the model 
animals. At the molecular mechanism level, integrated analysis using proteomics 
and network pharmacology identified 60 overlapping pathways. Combined with 
Western blotting verification, the results collectively demonstrate that 
Tinosporae Radix may exert anti-neuroinflammatory effects via modulation of the 
TLR4-mediated PI3K/AKT/NF-κB cascade.
CONCLUSIONS: EETs attenuates neuroinflammation by inhibiting the 
TLR4/PI3K/AKT/NF-κB signaling and suppressing neuronal apoptosis, demonstrating 
therapeutic potential against neurodegenerative disorders.

Neurodegenerative diseases involve a spectrum of diseases, with Alzheimer's 
being the most prevalent one. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive 
neurodegenerative disorder marked by cognitive decline, memory loss, and 
synaptic dysfunction. Despite extensive research, effective therapeutic 
interventions remain limited, largely due to the complex molecular underpinnings 
of the disease and the challenge posed by the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This 
review explores the critical molecular mechanisms implicated in AD pathogenesis, 
i.e. disruption of cholinergic neurotransmission, aggregation of β-amyloid 
fragments, tau protein phosphorylation, and oxidative stress. As the 
establishment of effective treatments remains a major research goal, the present 
review further gives an insight into the various preclinical in vivo models like 
chemical, lesion-induced, beta-amyloid, streptozotocin infusion, and transgenic 
models that have been instrumental in advancing our understanding of disease 
progression and testing potential treatments. A significant focus is given to 
emerging strategies designed to circumvent or modulate the BBB, including 
nanoparticle-based delivery systems, receptor-mediated transport, and focused 
ultrasound techniques. By integrating insights from molecular biology, 
experimental modeling, and drug delivery science, this work aims to highlight 
current challenges and propose comprehensive strategies for improving the 
diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

The gut-brain-immune (GBI) axis, connecting gut microbes, neural tissue, and the 
cells of the immune system, plays a critical role in human health, particularly 
in relation to neurological diseases. Research in this field over the last few 
decades shows that disruptions in the microbiome have been linked to chronic 
inflammation, which may contribute to neurological conditions, including 
Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and other mental health disorders. As 
we gain a greater understanding of the links between these systems, novel 
therapeutic strategies are being explored to treat disease by modulation of the 
GBI axis. One of the most promising approaches is the use of live 
biotherapeutics, such as engineered probiotics, as next-generation drug delivery 
systems. These live microorganisms can be designed to deliver specific 
therapeutic compounds to the gut and brain in order to modulate immune responses 
and reduce inflammation at the source. Probiotics and live biotherapeutics can 
offer a targeted approach to treating neurological diseases by influencing both 
the microbiome and immune system. In this review, we outline the research and 
mechanisms that have been implicated in GBI interactions and highlight the 
potential of these innovative therapies in treating neurological disorders, 
emphasizing their role in improving precision medicine through targeted, 
microbiome-based interventions.

OBJECTIVES: To compare distressed behavior in Veterans with Alzheimer disease 
and related dementias (ADRD) residing in Veterans Affairs (VA) Community Living 
Centers (CLCs) during the COVID-19 pandemic to previous years.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Veterans with ADRD and without baseline distressed 
behavior residing in CLCs in March 2020 (Early-COVID) and March 2018 or March 
2019 (Pre-COVID).
METHODS: We measured distressed behavior with the Distressed Behaviors in 
Dementia Indicator. Using a Cox regression, we compared the 180-day hazard of 
distressed behavior in the Early-COVID group to that in the Pre-COVID group.
RESULTS: Of 4383 sampled Veterans, 1190 (27%) had recently taken an 
antipsychotic medication. In the Pre-COVID (n = 2795) and Early-COVID groups (n 
= 1588), new distressed behavior occurred in 629 (22.5%) and 313 (19.7%) 
Veterans, respectively. The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of new distressed 
behavior was 0.82 (95% CI 0.71-0.95) for Early-COVID compared with Pre-COVID. 
Antipsychotic medication was associated with new distressed behavior (HR 1.61, 
95% CI 1.40-1.86).
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: New distressed behavior decreased during the first 
6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic compared with the previous 2 years. The 
observed association between antipsychotic medication use and distressed 
behavior may reflect clinical recognition and treatment of a predisposition 
toward distressed behavior. Recorded changes in distressed behavior in Veterans 
with dementia residing in CLCs opposed the trend of decreased well-being in 
residents of non-VA nursing homes, but changes in resident assessment fidelity 
during the Early-COVID period could have confounded the study.

Neurogenetic disorders (NeD) are a group of neurological conditions resulting 
from inherited genetic defects. By affecting the normal functioning of the 
nervous system, these diseases lead to serious problems in movement, cognition, 
and other body functions. In recent years, machine learning (ML) approaches have 
proven highly effective, enabling the analysis and processing of vast amounts of 
medical data. By analyzing genetic data, medical imaging, and other clinical 
data, these techniques can contribute to early diagnosis and more effective 
treatment of NeD. However, using these approaches is challenged by issues 
including data variability, model explainability, and the requirement for 
interdisciplinary collaboration. This paper investigates the impact of ML on 
healthcare diagnosis and care of common NeD, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and Multiple Sclerosis 
disease (MSD). The purpose of this research is to determine the opportunities 
and challenges of using these techniques in the field of neurogenetic medicine. 
Our findings show that using ML can increase the detection accuracy by 85 % and 
reduce the detection time by 60 %. Additionally, the use of these techniques in 
predicting patient prognosis has been 70 % more accurate than traditional 
methods. Ultimately, this research will enable medical professionals and 
researchers to leverage ML approaches in advancing the diagnostic and 
therapeutic processes of NeD by identifying the opportunities and challenges.

BACKGROUND: Cognitive decline, a natural aspect of aging, is linked to negative 
outcomes like increased mortality and social isolation. The Mediterranean-DASH 
Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet, blending the Mediterranean 
diet and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet elements, aims 
to slow cognitive decline and reduce dementia risk. Secondary analyses of 
population studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) show mixed results on 
the MIND diet's effectiveness in improving cognitive health. Existing reviews 
have explored the MIND diet's impact on cognitive health, though their focus can 
be broad or narrow. Our review offers an updated perspective by specifically 
targeting dementia risk and clinical cognitive function, integrating new studies 
for enhanced insights into clinical practice and research.
METHODS: This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 and the Synthesis Without Meta-analysis 
(SWiM) guidelines and was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42023391972). We included 
quantitative studies on middle-aged and older adults (mean age >40 years) 
examining MIND diet adherence and cognitive health, excluding non-original 
research. A systematic search was conducted in five databases from March 2023 to 
March 2024 using relevant search terms. Data were extracted and assessed for 
bias by multiple reviewers using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) tools. 
Heterogeneous data were synthesized using SWiM guidelines, focusing on cognitive 
function outcomes, with results presented in tables and figures.
RESULTS: The search over five databases identified 898 articles, with 26 meeting 
the inclusion criteria. A hand search added 13 more, totaling 39 articles from 
14 countries, including cohorts, cross-sectional, RCTs, and case-control 
studies. Most studies were conducted in the United States of America (USA), 
published between 2015 and 2024. Participant numbers ranged from 37 to 120,661, 
with follow-ups from 3 months to 24 years. Some studies explored more than one 
correlation. Of the studies, 14 out of 19 articles explored MIND diet adherence 
and global cognitive function, showing positive results. 10 out of 11 studies 
investigated MIND diet adherence and dementia/Alzheimer's risk, showing positive 
associations. 16 out of 18 articles examined the MIND diet's effect on 
domain-specific cognitive functions, with favorable outcomes.
DISCUSSION: This systematic review reveals the significant promise of the MIND 
diet in enhancing cognitive health, specifically in global cognition, memory, 
and executive function. While observational studies strongly advocate for its 
inclusion in clinical guidelines to prevent and manage Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
and dementia, results from RCTs are mixed, suggesting further investigation is 
needed. The use of PRISMA and SWiM guidelines ensures robust and transparent 
findings, categorizing cognitive outcomes into critical areas for a holistic 
insight. Despite the effectiveness of alternative methods, such as MIND diet 
questionnaires, for adherence assessment apart from FFQ, variability in study 
populations, interventions, and scoring methods complicates pinpointing an 
optimal MIND score. This underscores the importance of standardized 
methodologies to refine dietary recommendations and consolidate the diet's 
cognitive health benefits across various populations.

Changes to cellular lipids accompany shifts in microglial cell state, but the 
functional significance of these metabolic changes remains poorly understood. In 
human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia, we observed that both 
extrinsic activation (by lipopolysaccharide treatment) and intrinsic triggers 
(the Alzheimer's disease-associated APOE4 genotype) result in accumulation of 
triglyceride-rich lipid droplets. We demonstrate that lipid droplet accumulation 
is not simply concomitant with changes in the cell state. In fact, both 
triglyceride biosynthesis and catabolism are critical for the activation-induced 
transcription and secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, as well as 
changes in phagocytosis. In microglia harboring the Alzheimer's disease risk 
APOE4 genotype, inhibiting triglyceride biosynthesis attenuates 
disease-associated transcriptional states. Triglyceride biosynthesis inhibition 
also rescues microglial surveillance defects observed in slices from APOE4 
humanized transgenic mice. Together, our findings establish that modulating 
triglyceride metabolism can tune microglial immune activity in response to 
extrinsic activation and in APOE4-associated disease.

Neuroinflammation, triggered by lipoxygenase (LOX), contributes to Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) progression. Overexpression of LOX-5 in patients with AD serum 
highlights its role. This study assessed the efficacy of the 
LOX-inhibitor-peptide YWCS in an AD rat model induced by Aβ25-35 injection. 
Cognitive tests, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, and molecular analyses 
were conducted. YWCS treatment significantly improved cognitive function, as 
evidenced by improved performance in the open field, novel object recognition, 
elevated plus maze, and Morris water maze tests. MRI scans revealed hippocampal 
shrinkage in AD rats and no changes were observed from YWCS treatment. Molecular 
analysis revealed altered expression of LOX-5, LOX-12, Aβ, γ-secretase 
components, p-Tau181, Akt, p-Akt, and p53 in AD rats. Immunofluorescence 
staining confirmed increased expression of LOX, Aβ, and p-Tau181 in the 
hippocampus of AD rats, which was reduced by YWCS treatment. Serum LOX levels 
were elevated in AD rats and significantly decreased after YWCS treatment, 
aligning with previous findings in human AD patients and AD cell models. YWCS 
offered improvements in behavioral and inflammatory marker regulation and also 
prevented progression of the disease, as shown by MRI results. These results 
suggest that YWCS, by targeting LOX, has the potential to be a promising 
therapeutic agent for AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) as well as other memory disorders significantly impair 
cognitive and behavioral functions, posing a growing global health burden. 
Research increasingly supports the synergistic effects of natural 
products-bioactive compounds derived from plant-based diets-and regular physical 
exercise in promoting brain health. Natural products exhibit neuroprotective 
effects by modulating oxidative stress, reducing neuroinflammation, and 
enhancing synaptic plasticity, while exercise complements these benefits by 
improving neurogenesis, cerebral blood flow, and mitochondrial function. This 
review synthesizes current findings on the signaling mechanisms underlying the 
combined impact of natural products and physical exercise on brain function. We 
focus on their influence on key pathways, including brain-derived neurotrophic 
factor (BDNF) signaling, amyloid-beta clearance, and the regulation of 
neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. Evidence recommends that the integration 
of these interventions can attenuate cognitive decline, support behavioral 
resilience, and delay disease progression in AD and other memory disorders. We 
also highlight the translational challenges of implementing these strategies in 
clinical settings, including individual variability in response and adherence. 
Future research directions are discussed, emphasizing the potential of combining 
dietary and exercise-based interventions. This review aims to advance the 
understanding of how lifestyle interventions can enhance behavioral and brain 
functions in the situation of neurodegenerative disorders.

The apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele is the most important genetic risk factor 
for sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet its mechanisms in AD pathology and 
cognitive decline remain unclear. Using a sliding-time window approach to 
directly quantify the instantaneous fluctuations of various local metrics based 
on continuous time series and calculate voxel-wise concordance of these metrics, 
we explored the impact of APOE ε4 on dynamic local brain activity and functional 
integration in AD, and its interrelations with plasma biomarkers and cognition. 
Results showed that APOE ε4 widely affected dALFF, dReHo, dGSCorr, and 
voxel-wise concordance. For AD patients, APOE ε4 carriers uniquely exhibited 
correlations between dALFF in the right angular gyrus/supramarginal gyrus and 
MoCA scores and orientation function, and between voxel-wise concordance in the 
right caudate nucleus (CAU) and general cognition, attention, language function, 
orientation function, plasma Aβ42. Critically, APOE ε4-related altered 
voxel-wise concordance in the right CAU mediated the relationship between plasma 
Aβ and language cognition in AD. Moreover, the combined model incorporating 
dynamic metrics, plasma AD biomarkers, and demographic data effectively 
distinguished AD from NC (AUC = 0.94, sensitivity = 87.69%, 
specificity = 86.84%). In conclusion, the APOE ε4 allele might play a pivotal 
role in modulating brain dynamic functional activities in AD, which may 
contribute to the association between Aβ pathology and cognitive decline. Our 
findings may provide imaging markers and targets for the diagnosis and treatment 
of AD.

BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) has a prolonged latency period, 
though its preclinical characteristics remain poorly understood. This study uses 
UK Biobank data to explore and compare ALS's pre-diagnostic features, including 
symptoms and medication use, aiming to provide insights into the disease's 
underlying mechanisms.
METHODS: Clinical symptoms and medications were identified from self-reports, 
hospital records, and death registry data. Propensity score matching was used to 
match ALS with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), ensuring 
balance in socioeconomic factors to compare symptoms 0-5 years before diagnosis. 
Cox regression analysis was applied to assess the associations between 
medication use and the risk of incident ALS and mortality after ALS diagnosis.
RESULTS: A total of 753 ALS cases were observed in 502 417 participants, with an 
incidence rate of 10.58 per 100 000 person-years. In the ALS cohort, the 
male-to-female ratio was 2.9, with a median age at onset of 64.61 years 
(Interquartile range (IQR): 56.80-71.31) and a median survival time 
post-diagnosis of 9.08 months (IQR: 3.18-18.98), while females (log-rank 
p = 0.038) and individuals with earlier (< 64.61 years) disease onset (log-rank 
p < 0.001) had longer survival periods. In the 5 years prior to diagnosis, ALS 
showed a higher incidence of falls compared to ad (11.3% vs. 3.2%, p < 0.001), 
but a lower incidence than PD (10.7% vs. 28.3%, p < 0.001). Additionally, ALS 
had a lower incidence of depression (4.6% vs. 25.6%, p < 0.001), anxiety (3.5% 
vs. 18.1%, p < 0.001), sleep disorders (1.4% vs. 7.2%, p < 0.001), hypotension 
(3.4% vs. 30.5%, p < 0.001), constipation (0.3% vs. 4.9%, p < 0.001), and 
urinary dysfunction (2.2% vs. 8.7%, p < 0.001) compared with PD. The use of 
calcium channel blockers may be a risk factor for incident ALS (adjusted HR 
1.61, 95% CI: 1.22-2.12, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Pre-diagnostic presentations of falls are more frequent in ALS than 
in AD, but less frequent than in PD. However, ALS exhibits fewer psychiatric 
symptoms and autonomic dysfunction compared with PD. The use of calcium channel 
blockers may be associated with an increased risk of developing ALS in the 
future.
