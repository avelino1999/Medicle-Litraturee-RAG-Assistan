BACKGROUND: Black adults have higher dementia risk than White adults. Whether 
tighter population-level blood pressure (BP) control reduces this disparity is 
unknown.
OBJECTIVE: Estimate the impact of optimal BP treatment intensity on racial 
disparities in dementia.
METHODS: A microsimulation study of US adults ≥18 across a life-time 
policy-planning horizon. BP treatment strategies were the Systolic Blood 
Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) protocol, the Eighth Joint National 
Committee (JNC-8) recommendations, and usual care (non-intervention control). 
Outcomes were all-cause dementia, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease 
(ASCVD), stroke, myocardial infarction, non-ASCVD death, global cognitive 
performance, and optimal brain health (being free of dementia, cognitive 
impairment, or stroke). Population-level and individual-level effects stratified 
by race were estimated.
RESULTS: Optimal population-level implementation of a SPRINT-based BP treatment 
strategy, compared to usual care, would increase average annual dementia 
incidence in White, but not Black, adults (1% versus 0%), due to hypertensive 
individuals' greater survival, and reduce annual ASCVD events more in Black than 
White adults (13% versus 5%). Under a SPRINT-based strategy, individuals with 
hypertension gained more years lived without dementia, ASCVD, myocardial 
infarction, or stroke and more years lived in optimal brain health. A 
SPRINT-based strategy did not attenuate individual-level race disparities in 
outcomes, except stroke. Due to longer life expectancy, a SPRINT-based strategy 
did not substantially reduce lifetime dementia risk in either group. The 
JNC-8-based strategy had similar but smaller effects as the SPRINT-based 
strategy.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that tighter population-level BP control would 
not reduce population-level disparities in dementia between US Black and White 
adults.

Mobility tasks like the Timed Up and Go test (TUG), cognitive TUG (cogTUG), and 
walking with turns provide insights into the impact of Parkinson's disease (PD) 
on motor control, balance, and cognitive function. We assess the test-retest 
reliability of these tasks in 262 PD participants and 50 controls by evaluating 
machine learning models based on wearable-sensor-derived measures and 
statistical metrics. This evaluation examines total duration, subtask duration, 
and other quantitative measures across two trials. We show that the diagnostic 
accuracy for distinguishing PD from controls decreases by a mean of 1.8% between 
the first and the second trial, suggesting that task repetition may not be 
necessary for accurate diagnosis. Although the total duration remains relatively 
consistent between trials (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.62 to 
0.95), greater variability is seen in subtask duration and sensor-derived 
measures, reflected in machine learning performance and statistical differences. 
Our findings also show that this variability differs not only between controls 
and PD participants but also among groups with varying levels of PD severity, 
indicating the need to consider population characteristics. Relying solely on 
total task duration and conventional statistical metrics to gauge the 
reliability of mobility tasks may fail to reveal nuanced variations in movement.

Sciences, 1113 Sofia, Bulgaria.

The genus Galanthus (Amaryllidaceae) currently contains 25 plant species 
naturally occurring in Europe and the Middle East region. These perennial 
bulbous plants possess well-known medicinal and ornamental qualities. Alkaloid 
diversity is their most distinctive phytochemical feature. A total of 127 
compounds (≈20% of all known Amaryllidaceae alkaloids) grouped in 16 structural 
types have been previously found in Galanthus extracts. Some structural types 
like galanthindole, graciline and plicamine were first discovered in Galanthus 
plants. Nine Galanthus species, however, remain unstudied regarding their 
alkaloid patterns. Intraspecific variability has only been studied in G. nivalis 
and G. elwesii. Amaryllidaceae alkaloids are molecules with anticholinesterase, 
antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral and anticancer properties. Galanthamine, 
isolated for the first time from Galanthus woronowii Losinsk., stands out as an 
acetylcholinesterase inhibitor approved for medical use by the FDA for the 
treatment of symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Lycorine, narciclasine and 
pancratistatin are noteworthy cytotoxic and antitumor alkaloids. Structural 
types like galanthamine, homolycorine and haemanthamine are fairly well studied 
in anticancer research, but little to no information is available on 
galanthindole, graciline and other types. This review aims to present an update 
on the alkaloid diversity of Galanthus spp. and highlight the need for further 
research on the antitumor potential of these molecules.

Peptides: New Perspectives in Attenuating Prothrombotic Risk in Alzheimer's 
Disease Patients.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Amyloid peptides, whose accumulation in the brain as 
senile plaques is associated with the onset of Alzheimer's disease, are also 
found in cerebral vessels and in circulation. In the bloodstream, amyloid 
peptides promote platelet adhesion, activation, oxidative stress, and 
thrombosis, contributing to the cardiovascular complications observed in 
Alzheimer's disease patients. Natural compounds, such as curcumin, are known to 
modulate platelet activation induced by the hemostatic stimuli thrombin and 
convulxin. In this study, we investigated the ability of curcumin to modulate 
platelet activation triggered by amyloid peptides, and we compared its effects 
with those displayed on platelet activation induced by physiological agonists.
METHODS: Commercial ultrapure curcumin was used, and platelet aggregation, 
granule secretion, phosphorylation of selected signaling proteins, and reactive 
oxygen species production were analyzed on isolated human platelets.
RESULTS: Our results demonstrate that curcumin effectively suppressed platelet 
aggregation induced by fibrillar amyloid peptides. This effect was associated 
with the reduction in intracellular signaling pathways involving PKC, PI3K, and 
MAPK. By contrast, platelet aggregation and activation induced by thrombin and 
convulxin were only partially reduced by preincubation with curcumin. Moreover, 
curcumin completely suppressed granule secretion only when platelets were 
stimulated with hemostatic agonists, but it had no effects upon stimulation with 
amyloid peptides. Additionally, curcumin reduced the production of reactive 
oxygen species induced by amyloid peptides with a stronger efficiency compared 
to platelets stimulated with thrombin.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that curcumin displays selective and potent 
inhibitory activity on platelet responses to pathological stimuli, such as 
fibrillar amyloid peptides.

Systematic Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease increasingly 
prevalent in the aging population. AD is characterized by pathological features 
such as β-amyloid (Aβ) plaque accumulation, tau neurofibrillary tangles 
formation, oxidative stress, an impaired cholinergic system, and 
neuroinflammation. Many therapeutic drugs have been developed to slow the 
progression of AD by targeting these pathological mechanisms. However, synthetic 
drugs, such as donepezil and memantine, can often lead to side effects. In this 
context, seaweeds have been drawing attention as a nutrient source and a 
potential source of health-improving metabolites. Studies have shown that 
extracts from brown macroalgae can potentially reduce the inflammation 
associated with neurodegenerative diseases by inhibiting proinflammatory 
cytokine expression. Furthermore, their bioactive compounds exhibit antioxidant 
properties vital in combating oxidative stress. Antioxidants, mainly carotenoids 
and phenolic compounds, have been linked to improved cognitive function and a 
reduced risk of neurodegenerative disorders by protecting neuronal cells through 
their ability to scavenge free radicals. In addition, omega-3 fatty acids found 
in certain macroalgae have the potential to support brain health and cognitive 
function, further enhancing their neuroprotective effects. In conclusion, this 
review has comprehensively evaluated the research conducted on brown macroalgae 
in the last five years, covering their potential bioactive compounds, methods of 
obtaining these compounds, and their neuroprotective properties against AD. The 
limited number of clinical studies in the literature highlights the need for 
further research. This narrative review provides a basic framework for new 
approaches to neuroprotective strategies, such as those associated with brown 
macroalgae natural resources. Furthermore, they may play an increasingly 
important role in developing functional foods and nutraceuticals that can 
support human health in preventing and managing neurodegenerative diseases.

The brain contains many interconnected and complex cellular and molecular 
mechanisms. Injury to the brain causes permanent dysfunctions in these 
mechanisms. So, it continues to be an area where surgical intervention cannot be 
performed except for the removal of tumors and the repair of some aneurysms. 
Some agents that can cross the blood-brain barrier and reach neurons show 
neuroprotective effects in the brain due to their anti-apoptotic, 
anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. In particular, some agents act by 
reducing or modulating the accumulation of protein aggregates in 
neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, 
Huntington's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and prion disease) caused 
by protein accumulation. Substrate accumulation causes increased oxidative 
stress and stimulates the brain's immune cells, microglia, and astrocytes, to 
secrete proinflammatory cytokines. Long-term or chronic neuroinflammatory 
response triggers apoptosis. Brain damage is observed with neuronal apoptosis 
and brain functions are impaired. This situation negatively affects processes 
such as motor movements, memory, perception, and learning. Neuroprotective 
agents prevent apoptosis by modulating molecules that play a role in apoptosis. 
In addition, they can improve impaired brain functions by supporting 
neuroplasticity and neurogenesis. Due to the important roles that these agents 
play in central nervous system damage or neurodegenerative diseases, it is 
important to elucidate many mechanisms. This review provides an overview of the 
mechanisms of flavonoids, which constitute a large part of the agents with 
neuroprotective effects, as well as vitamins, neurotransmitters, hormones, amino 
acids, and their derivatives. It is thought that understanding these mechanisms 
will enable the development of new therapeutic agents and different treatment 
strategies.

Sodium Thiosulfate: An Innovative Multi-Target Repurposed Treatment Strategy for 
Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease.

Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) is a chronic, multifactorial, and 
progressive neurodegenerative disease that associates with aging and is highly 
prevalent in our older population (≥65 years of age). This hypothesis generating 
this narrative review will examine the important role for the use of sodium 
thiosulfate (STS) as a possible multi-targeting treatment option for LOAD. 
Sulfur is widely available in our environment and is responsible for forming 
organosulfur compounds that are known to be associated with a wide range of 
biological activities in the brain. STS is known to have (i) antioxidant and 
(ii) anti-inflammatory properties; (iii) chelation properties for calcium and 
the pro-oxidative cation metals such as iron and copper; (iv) donor properties 
for hydrogen sulfide production; (v) possible restorative properties for brain 
endothelial-cell-derived bioavailable nitric oxide. Thus, it becomes apparent 
that STS has the potential for neuroprotection and neuromodulation and may allow 
for an attenuation of the progressive nature of neurodegeneration and impaired 
cognition in LOAD. STS has been successfully used to prevent cisplatin 
oxidative-stress-induced ototoxicity in the treatment of head and neck and solid 
cancers, cyanide and arsenic poisoning, and fungal skin diseases. Most recently, 
intravenous STS has become part of the treatment plan for calciphylaxis globally 
due to vascular calcification and ischemia-induced skin necrosis and ulceration. 
Side effects have been minimal with reports of metabolic acidosis and increased 
anion gap; as with any drug treatment, there is also the possibility of allergic 
reactions, possible long-term osteoporosis from animal studies to date, and 
minor side-effects of nausea, headache, and rhinorrhea if infused too rapidly. 
While STS poorly penetrates the intact blood-brain barrier(s) (BBBs), it could 
readily penetrate BBBs that are dysfunctional and disrupted to deliver its 
neuroprotective and neuromodulating effects in addition to its ability to 
penetrate the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier of the choroid plexus. Novel 
strategies such as the future use of nano-technology may be helpful in allowing 
an increased entry of STS into the brain.

Targeting Iron Responsive Elements (IREs) of APP mRNA into Novel Therapeutics to 
Control the Translation of Amyloid-β Precursor Protein in Alzheimer's Disease.

Khan MA(1).

University, Riyadh 11533, Saudi Arabia.

The hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the buildup of amyloid-β (Aβ), which 
is produced when the amyloid precursor protein (APP) misfolds and deposits as 
neurotoxic plaques in the brain. A functional iron responsive element (IRE) RNA 
stem loop is encoded by the APP 5'-UTR and may be a target for regulating the 
production of Alzheimer's amyloid precursor protein. Since modifying Aβ protein 
expression can give anti-amyloid efficacy and protective brain iron balance, 
targeted regulation of amyloid protein synthesis through modulation of 5'-UTR 
sequence function is a novel method for the prospective therapy of Alzheimer's 
disease. Numerous mRNA interference strategies target the 2D RNA structure, even 
though messenger RNAs like tRNAs and rRNAs can fold into complex, 
three-dimensional structures, adding even another level of complexity. The IRE 
family is among the few known 3D mRNA regulatory elements. This review seeks to 
describe the structural and functional aspects of IREs in transcripts, including 
that of the amyloid precursor protein, that are relevant to neurodegenerative 
diseases, including AD. The mRNAs encoding the proteins involved in iron 
metabolism are controlled by this family of similar base sequences. Like 
ferritin IRE RNA in their 5'-UTR, iron controls the production of APP in their 
5'-UTR. Iron misregulation by iron regulatory proteins (IRPs) can also be 
investigated and contrasted using measurements of the expression levels of tau 
production, Aβ, and APP. The development of AD is aided by iron binding to Aβ, 
which promotes Aβ aggregation. The development of small chemical therapeutics to 
control IRE-modulated expression of APP is increasingly thought to target 
messenger RNAs. Thus, IRE-modulated APP expression in AD has important 
therapeutic implications by targeting mRNA structures.

Florbetaben (FBB) is a radiopharmaceutical approved by the FDA and EMA in 2014 
for the positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of brain amyloid deposition 
in patients with cognitive impairment who are being evaluated for Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) or other causes of cognitive decline. Initially, the clinical 
adoption of FBB PET faced significant barriers, including reimbursement 
challenges and uncertainties regarding its integration into diagnostic clinical 
practice. This review examines the progress made in overcoming these obstacles 
and describes the concurrent evolution of the diagnostic landscape. Advances in 
quantification methods have further strengthened the traditional visual 
assessment approach. Over the past decade, compelling evidence has emerged, 
demonstrating that amyloid PET has a strong impact on AD diagnosis, management, 
and outcomes across diverse clinical scenarios, even in the absence of 
amyloid-targeted therapies. Amyloid PET imaging has become essential in clinical 
trials and the application of new AD therapeutics, particularly for confirming 
eligibility criteria (i.e., the presence of amyloid plaques) and monitoring 
biological responses to amyloid-lowering therapies. Since its approval, FBB PET 
has transitioned from a purely diagnostic tool aimed primarily at excluding 
amyloid pathology to a critical component in AD drug development, and today, it 
is essential in the diagnostic workup and therapy management of approved AD 
treatments.

Background/Objectives: Tacrine is a centrally active non-competitive reversible 
acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. It also exerts antagonising activity against 
N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Tacrine was approved for the treatment of 
Alzheimer's disease in 1993, but was withdrawn from clinical use in 2013 because 
of its hepatotoxicity and gastrointestinal side effects. Nevertheless, tacrine 
is currently facing a renewed wave of interest primarily due to several new 
tacrine-incorporated hybrids and derivates. There were two specific aims for 
this study: firstly, to explain the mechanisms of the adverse action of tacrine, 
as a distinctive example of a highly effective acetylcholinesterase inhibitor; 
and secondly to check whether luminal impedance planimetry is feasible for 
preclinical testing of possible side effects of compounds potentially toxic to 
the gastrointestinal tract. Methods: Six experimental pigs were used as the 
animal model in this study. Five major parameters were evaluated: luminal 
pressure (mmHg), estimated diameter (mm), cross-sectional area (mm2), 
distensibility (mm2/mmHg), and zone compliance (mm3/mmHg). All measurements were 
performed before and 360 min after intragastric administration of 200 mg tacrine 
(at the porcine tacrine Tmax). Results: This study consistently demonstrated an 
increase in luminal pressure (a directly measured indicator) for the particular 
balloon filling volumes used, and inversely a reciprocal decrease in the other 
parameters after tacrine administration. Conclusions: Endoscopic luminal 
impedance planimetry is a feasible method to evaluate functional response of the 
lower oesophageal sphincter to tacrine in experimental pigs. Tacrine did not 
compromise the function of the lower oesophageal sphincter either toward 
oesophageal spasms or, in contrast, decreased competence of the lower 
oesophageal sphincter.

This review synthesizes the findings from 252 studies to explore the 
relationship between the oral pathogens associated with periodontitis, dental 
caries, and systemic diseases. Individuals with oral diseases, such as 
periodontitis, are between 1.7 and 7.5 times (average 3.3 times) more likely to 
develop systemic diseases or suffer adverse pregnancy outcomes, underscoring the 
critical connection between dental and overall health. Oral conditions such as 
periodontitis and dental caries represent a significant health burden, affecting 
26-47% of Americans. The most important oral pathogens, ranked by publication 
frequency, include the herpes virus, C. albicans, S. mutans, P. gingivalis, F. 
nucleatum, A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. intermedia, T. denticola, and T. 
forsythia. The systemic diseases and disorders linked to oral infections, ranked 
similarly, include cancer, respiratory, liver, bowel, fever, kidney, 
complications in pregnancy, cardiovascular bacteremia, diabetes, arthritis, 
autoimmune, bladder, dementia, lupus, and Alzheimer's diseases. Evidence 
supports the efficacy of dental and periodontal treatments in eliminating oral 
infections and reducing the severity of systemic diseases. The substantial 
burden that oral pathogens have on cancer, cardiovascular diseases, Alzheimer's, 
diabetes, and other systemic diseases poses a significant public health crisis.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with 
cognitive dysfunction, memory decline, and behavioral disturbance, and it is 
pathologically characterized by the accumulation of amyloid plaques and 
neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. Although various hypotheses have been 
proposed to explain the pathogenesis of AD, including the amyloid beta 
hypothesis, oxidative stress hypothesis, and abnormal phosphorylation of tau 
proteins, the exact pathogenic mechanisms underlying AD remain largely 
undefined. Furthermore, effective curative treatments are very limited. 
Epidemiologic studies provide convincing evidence for a significant association 
between type 2 diabetes and AD. Here, we showed energy metabolism using glucose, 
lactate, ketone bodies, and lipids as energy substrates in a normal brain, and 
changes in such energy metabolism due to type 2 diabetes. We also showed the 
influences of such altered energy metabolism due to type 2 diabetes on the 
pathology of AD. Furthermore, we comprehensively searched for risk factors 
related with type 2 diabetes for AD and showed possible therapeutic 
interventions based on considering risk factors and altered brain energy 
metabolism due to type 2 diabetes for the development of AD.

CX3CR1-transduced regulatory T cells (Tregs) have shown potential in reducing 
neuroinflammation by targeting microglial activation. Reactive microglia are 
implicated in neurological disorders, and CX3CR1-CX3CL1 signaling modulates 
microglial activity. The ability of CX3CR1-transduced Tregs to inhibit 
LPS-induced neuroinflammation was assessed in animal models. CX3CR1 Tregs were 
administered to LPS-induced and 3xTg Alzheimer's mouse models, resulting in 
reduced proinflammatory marker expression in both the cortices and hippocampi. 
In the 3xTg Alzheimer's model, neuroinflammation was significantly reduced, 
demonstrating the efficacy of CX3CR1 Tregs even in chronic neuroinflammatory 
conditions. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of CX3CR1 Treg 
therapy in modulating microglial activity and offer promising treatment 
strategies for neurodegenerative diseases.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disease mainly 
caused by β-amyloid (Aβ) accumulation in the brain. Among the several factors 
that may concur to AD development, elevated cholesterol levels and brain 
cholesterol dyshomeostasis have been recognized to play a relevant role. 
Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a protein primarily 
known to regulate plasma low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) rich in cholesterol and 
to be one of the main causes of familial hypercholesterolemia. In addition to 
that, PCSK9 is also recognized to carry out diverse important activities in the 
brain, including control of neuronal differentiation, apoptosis, and, 
importantly, LDL receptors functionality. Moreover, PCSK9 appeared to be 
directly involved in some of the principal processes responsible for AD 
development, such as inflammation, oxidative stress, and Aβ deposition. On these 
bases, PCSK9 management might represent a promising approach for AD treatment. 
The purpose of this review is to elucidate the role of PCSK9, whether or not 
cholesterol-related, in AD pathogenesis and to give an updated overview of the 
most innovative therapeutic strategies developed so far to counteract the 
pleiotropic activities of both humoral and brain PCSK9, focusing in particular 
on their potentiality for AD management.

Alzheimer's disease is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, 
characterized by a wide range of neurological symptoms that begin with 
personality changes and psychiatric symptoms, progress to mild cognitive 
impairment, and eventually lead to dementia. Physical exercise is part of the 
non-pharmacological treatments used in Alzheimer's disease, as it has been shown 
to delay the neurodegenerative process by improving the redox state in brain 
tissue, providing anti-inflammatory effects or stimulating the release of the 
brain-derived neurotrophic factor that enhances the brain structure and 
cognitive performance. Here, we reviewed the results obtained from studies 
conducted in both animal models and human subjects to comprehend how physical 
exercise interventions can exert changes in the molecular mechanisms underlying 
the pathophysiological processes in Alzheimer's disease: amyloid β-peptide 
pathology, tau pathology, neuroglial changes, mitochondrial dysfunction, and 
oxidative stress. Physical exercise seems to have a protective effect against 
Alzheimer's disease, since it has been shown to induce positive changes in some 
of the biomarkers related to the pathophysiological processes of the disease. 
However, additional studies in humans are necessary to address the current lack 
of conclusive evidence.

The fibronectin domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5), or irisin, is an 
adipo-myokine hormone produced during exercise, which shows therapeutic 
potential for conditions like metabolic disorders, osteoporosis, sarcopenia, 
obesity, type 2 diabetes, and neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). This review explores its potential across various 
pathophysiological processes that are often considered independent. Elevated in 
healthy states but reduced in diseases, irisin improves muscle-adipose 
communication, insulin sensitivity, and metabolic balance by enhancing 
mitochondrial function and reducing oxidative stress. It promotes osteogenesis 
and mitigates bone loss in osteoporosis and sarcopenia. Irisin exhibits 
anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting NF-κB signaling and countering insulin 
resistance. In the brain, it reduces amyloid-β toxicity, inflammation, and 
oxidative stress, enhancing brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling, 
which improves cognition and synaptic health in AD models. It also regulates 
dopamine pathways, potentially alleviating neuropsychiatric symptoms like 
depression and apathy. By linking physical activity to systemic health, irisin 
emphasizes its role in the muscle-bone-brain axis. Its multifaceted benefits 
highlight its potential as a therapeutic target for AD and related disorders, 
with applications in prevention, in treatment, and as a complement to exercise 
strategies.

Targeting 5-HT Is a Potential Therapeutic Strategy for Neurodegenerative 
Diseases.

There is increasing interest in the potential therapeutic role of 5-HT 
(serotonin) in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, which are 
characterized by the progressive degeneration and death of nerve cells. 5-HT is 
a vital neurotransmitter that plays a central role in regulating mood, 
cognition, and various physiological processes in the body. Disruptions in the 
5-HT system have been linked to several neurological and psychiatric disorders, 
making it an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. Although the exact 
causes of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are not fully 
understood, researchers believe that regulating the 5-HT system could help 
alleviate symptoms and potentially slow the progression of these diseases. Here, 
we delve into the potential of harnessing 5-HT as a therapeutic target for the 
treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. It is important to note that the 
current clinical drugs targeting 5-HT are still limited in the treatment of 
these complex diseases. Therefore, further research and clinical trials are 
needed to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of its clinical 
application.

The predominant neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's 
disease, dementia with Lewy Bodies, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis, and frontotemporal dementia, are rarely pure diseases but, instead, 
show a diversity of mixed pathologies. At some level, all of them share a 
combination of one or more different toxic biomarker proteins: amyloid beta 
(Aβ), phosphorylated Tau (pTau), alpha-synuclein (αSyn), mutant huntingtin 
(mHtt), fused in sarcoma, superoxide dismutase 1, and TAR DNA-binding protein 
43. These toxic proteins share some common attributes, making them potentially 
universal and simultaneous targets for therapeutic intervention. First, they all 
form toxic aggregates prior to taking on their final forms as contributors to 
plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, Lewy bodies, and other protein deposits. 
Second, the primary enzyme that directs their aggregation is transglutaminase 2 
(TGM2), a brain-localized enzyme involved in neurodegeneration. Third, TGM2 
binds to calmodulin, a regulatory event that can increase the activity of this 
enzyme threefold. Fourth, the most common mixed pathology toxic biomarkers (Aβ, 
pTau, αSyn, nHtt) also bind calmodulin, which can affect their ability to 
aggregate. This review examines the potential therapeutic routes opened up by 
this knowledge. The end goal reveals multiple opportunities that are immediately 
available for universal therapeutic treatment of the most devastating 
neurodegenerative diseases facing humankind.

This review aims to address the significant challenges of treating central 
nervous system (CNS) disorders such as neurodegenerative diseases, strokes, 
spinal cord injuries, and brain tumors. These disorders are difficult to manage 
due to the complexity of disease mechanisms and the protective blood-brain 
barrier (BBB), which restricts drug delivery. Recent advancements in 
nanoparticle (NP) technologies offer promising solutions, with potential 
applications in drug delivery, neuroprotection, and neuroregeneration. By 
examining current research, we explore how NPs can cross the BBB, deliver 
medications directly to targeted CNS regions, and enhance both diagnostics and 
treatment. Key NP strategies, such as passive targeting, receptor-mediated 
transport, and stimuli-responsive systems, demonstrate encouraging results. 
Studies show that NPs may improve drug delivery, minimize side effects, and 
increase therapeutic effectiveness in models of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, 
stroke, and glioblastoma. NP technologies thus represent a promising approach 
for CNS disorder management, combining drug delivery and diagnostic capabilities 
to enable more precise and effective treatments that could significantly benefit 
patient outcomes.

Background and Objectives: Alzheimer's dementia is a progressive 
neurodegenerative disease that affects memory abilities due to genetic and 
environmental factors. A well-known gene that influences the risk of Alzheimer's 
disease is the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene. The APOE gene is involved in the 
production of a protein that helps transport cholesterol and other types of fat 
in the bloodstream. Problems in this process are thought to contribute to the 
development of Alzheimer's disease. APOE comes in several forms, which are 
called alleles (ε2, ε3, ε4). Materials and Methods: Therefore, our study aims to 
identify those subjects with a higher genetic risk through the polymorphism of 
the APOE gene, using a population screening in patients with a clinical 
diagnosis of AD in a region of Spain, Castilla y León, as potential biomarkers 
and to identify individuals at increased genetic risk by polymorphism of the 
APOE gene. An observational case-control study was conducted in Castilla y León 
(Spain). Saliva samples were collected and the ApoE gene was analyzed by PCR and 
agarose gel electrophoresis, respecting ethical criteria. Results: In the 
Alzheimer's population in Castilla y León, a high prevalence of ApoE3 (74%) was 
found, followed by ApoE4 (22%); in addition, a higher presence of the ε4 allele 
was found in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) group than in the control group. It 
was also observed that the ε2/ε2 genotype was not found in any individual with 
AD but was found in healthy subjects and that the opposite was observed for the 
ε4/ε4 genotype. The odds ratio (OR) indicated a risk four times greater of 
having AD if having the ε4 allele. Conclusions: The demonstrated relation 
between the different isoforms and the likelihood of developing AD has led to 
its consideration as a biomarker and a potential pre-symptomatic therapy. The 
molecular mechanisms that confer a disruptive and protective role to ApoE4 and 
ApoE2, respectively, are still being studied.

Background: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is employed to adjust the activity of 
impaired brain circuits. The variability in clinical trial outcomes for treating 
Alzheimer's disease with memantine is not yet fully understood. We conducted a 
randomized in silico study comparing virtual DBS therapies with treatment 
involving an NMDA antagonist combined with DBS in patients with Alzheimer's 
disease. Methods: Neural network models representing Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
patients were randomly assigned to four groups: AD, memantine treatment, DBS, 
and DBS and memantine. Out of 100 unique neural networks created to model 
moderate and severe AD with varying hippocampal synaptic loss, 20 were randomly 
selected to represent AD patients. Virtual treatments-memantine, DBS, and DBS 
and memantine-were applied, resulting in a total of 80 simulations. Results: The 
normalized mean number of spikes in the CA1 region among the virtual AD 
hippocampi treated with memantine, DBS therapy, and DBS and memantine differed 
significantly (p < 0.0001). The normalized mean number of spikes in the virtual 
AD hippocampi was 0.33 (95% CI, 0.29-0.36) and was significantly lower compared 
to the number of spikes in the virtual AD hippocampi treated with memantine, 
which was 0.53 (95% CI, 0.48-0.59) (p = 0.0162), and in the DBS and memantine 
group, which was 0.67 (95% CI, 0.57-0.78) (p = 0.0001). Conclusions: Our 
simulation results indicate the effectiveness of virtual memantine and DBS 
therapy compared to memantine monotherapy for Alzheimer's disease.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second-leading cause of death among 
neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's disease (AD), affecting around 2% of 
the population. It is expected that the incidence of PD will exceed 12 million 
by 2040. Meanwhile, there is a recognized difference in the phenotypical 
expression of the disease and response to treatment between men and women. Men 
have twice the incidence of PD compared to women, who have a late onset and 
worse prognosis that is usually associated with menopause. In addition, the 
incidence of PD in women is associated with the cumulative estrogen levels in 
their bodies. These differences are suggested to be due to the protective effect 
of estrogen on the brain, which cannot be given in clinical practice to improve 
the symptoms of the disease because of its peripheral side effects, causing 
cancer in both males and females in addition to the feminizing effect it has on 
males. As PD pathophysiology involves alteration in the expression levels of 
multiple LncRNAs, including metastatic-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 
1 (MALAT1), and as estrogen has been illustrated to control the expression of 
MALAT1 in multiple conditions, it is worth investigating the estrogen-MALAT1 
interaction in Parkinson's disease to mimic its protective effect on the brain 
while avoiding its peripheral side effects. The following literature review 
suggests the potential regulation of MALAT1 by estrogen in PD, which would 
enhance our understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease, improving the 
development of more tailored and effective treatments.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex/multifactorial brain disorder involving 
hundreds of defective genes, epigenetic aberrations, cerebrovascular 
alterations, and environmental risk factors. The onset of the neurodegenerative 
process is triggered decades before the first symptoms appear, probably due to a 
combination of genomic and epigenetic phenomena. Therefore, the primary 
objective of any effective treatment is to intercept the disease process in its 
presymptomatic phases. Since the approval of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors 
(Tacrine, Donepezil, Rivastigmine, Galantamine) and Memantine, between 1993 and 
2003, no new drug was approved by the FDA until the advent of immunotherapy with 
Aducanumab in 2021 and Lecanemab in 2023. Over the past decade, more than 10,000 
new compounds with potential action on some pathogenic components of AD have 
been tested. The limitations of these anti-AD treatments have stimulated the 
search for multi-target (MT) drugs. In recent years, more than 1000 drugs with 
potential MT function have been studied in AD models. MT drugs aim to address 
the complex and multifactorial nature of the disease. This approach has the 
potential to offer more comprehensive benefits than single-target therapies, 
which may be limited in their effectiveness due to the intricate pathology of 
AD. A strategy still unexplored is the combination of epigenetic drugs with MT 
agents. Another option could be biotechnological products with pleiotropic 
action, among which nosustrophine-like compounds could represent an attractive, 
although not definitive, example.

Sex differences in brain metabolism and their relationship to neurodegenerative 
diseases like Alzheimer's are an important emerging topic in neuroscience. 
Intrinsic anatomic and metabolic differences related to male and female 
physiology have been described, underscoring the importance of considering 
biological sex in studying brain metabolism and associated pathologies. The 
hippocampus is a key structure exhibiting sex differences in volume and 
connectivity. Adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus, dendritic spine density, 
and electrophysiological plasticity contribute to the hippocampus' remarkable 
plasticity. Glucose transporters GLUT3 and GLUT4 are expressed in human 
hippocampal neurons, with proper glucose metabolism being crucial for learning 
and memory. Sex hormones play a major role, with the aromatase enzyme that 
generates estradiol increasing in neurons and astrocytes as an endogenous 
neuroprotective mechanism. Inhibition of aromatase increases gliosis and 
neurodegeneration after brain injury. Genetic variants of aromatase may confer 
higher Alzheimer's risk. Estrogen replacement therapy in postmenopausal women 
prevents hippocampal hypometabolism and preserves memory. Insulin is also a key 
regulator of hippocampal glucose metabolism and cognitive processes. 
Dysregulation of the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter GLUT4 may explain the 
comorbidity between type II diabetes and Alzheimer's. GLUT4 colocalizes with the 
insulin-regulated aminopeptidase IRAP in neuronal vesicles, suggesting an 
activity-dependent glucose uptake mechanism. Sex differences in brain metabolism 
are an important factor in understanding neurodegenerative diseases, and future 
research must elucidate the underlying mechanisms and potential therapeutic 
implications of these differences.

Alzheimer's Disease: In Vitro and In Vivo Evidence of Activation of the Plasma 
Bradykinin-Forming Cascade and Implications for Therapy.

The plaques associated with Alzheimer's disease are formed as a result of the 
aggregation of Aβ peptides, which vary in length from 38 to 43 amino acids. The 
1-40 peptide is the most abundant, while the 1-42 peptide appears to be the most 
destructive to neurons and/or glial cells in a variety of assays. We have 
demonstrated that aggregated Aβ, a state prior to plaque formation, will 
activate the plasma bradykinin-forming pathway when tested in vitro. Aggregation 
is zinc-dependent, optimal at 25-50 µM, and the rate of aggregation is 
paralleled by the rate of activation of the bradykinin-forming pathway as 
assessed by plasma kallikrein formation. The aggregation of Aβ 1-38, 1-40, and 
1-42 is optimal after incubation for 3 days, 3 h, and under 1 min, respectively. 
The cascade is initiated by the autoactivation of factor XII upon binding to 
aggregated Aβ; then, prekallikrein is converted to kallikrein, which cleaves 
high-molecular-weight kininogen (HK) to release bradykinin. Studies by a variety 
of other researchers have demonstrated the presence of each "activation-step" in 
either the plasma or spinal fluid of patients with Alzheimer's disease, 
including activated factor XII, kallikrein, and bradykinin itself. There is also 
evidence that activation is more prominent as dementia worsens. We now have 
medications that can block each step of the bradykinin-forming pathway as 
currently employed for the therapy of hereditary angioedema. Given the current 
state of therapy for Alzheimer's disease, which includes monoclonal antibodies 
that retard the rate of progression by 30% at most and have significant side 
effects, it seems imperative to explore prophylaxis using one of the long-acting 
agents that target plasma kallikrein or factor XIIa. There is a long-acting 
bradykinin antagonist in development, and techniques to target kallikrein mRNA 
to lower levels or knock out the prekallikrein gene are being developed.

(1) Background: Impeded resolution of inflammation contributes substantially to 
the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD); consequently, resolving 
inflammation is pivotal to the amelioration of AD pathology. This can 
potentially be achieved by the treatment with specialized pro-resolving lipid 
mediators (SPMs), which should resolve neuroinflammation in brains. (2) Methods: 
Here, we report the histological effects of long-term treatment with an SPM, 
maresin-like 1 (MarL1), on AD pathogenesis in a transgenic 5xFAD mouse model. 
(3) Results: MarL1 treatment reduced Aβ overload, curbed the loss of neurons in 
brains especially cholinergic neurons associated with 
cleaved-caspase-3-associated apoptotic degeneration, reduced microgliosis and 
the pro-inflammatory M1 polarization of microglia, curbed the AD-associated 
decline in anti-inflammatory Iba1+Arg-1+-M2 microglia, inhibited phenotypic 
switching to pro-inflammatory N1 neutrophils, promoted the blood-brain 
barrier-associated tight-junction protein claudin-5 and decreased neutrophil 
leakage in 5xFAD brains, and induced the switch of neutrophils toward the 
inflammation-resolving N2 phenotype. (4) Conclusions: Long-term administration 
of MarL1 mitigates AD-related neuropathogenesis in brains by curbing 
neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, based on the histological results. 
These findings provide preclinical leads and mechanistic insights for the 
development of MarL1 into an effective modality to ameliorate AD pathogenesis.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), accounting for the majority of diabetes 
mellitus prevalence, is associated with an increased risk of cognition decline 
and deterioration of cognition function in diabetic patients. The sodium-glucose 
cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), located in the renal proximal tubule, plays a role in 
urine glucose reabsorption. SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), have shown potential 
benefits beyond cardiac and renal improvement in preventing and treating 
cognitive impairment (CI), including mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's 
disease and vascular dementia in T2DM patients. Studies suggest that SGLT2i may 
ameliorate diabetic CI through metabolism pathways, inflammation, oxidative 
stress, neurotrophic factors and AChE inhibition. Clinical trials and 
meta-analyses have reported significant and insignificant results. Given their 
vascular effects, SGLT2i may offer unique protection against vascular CI. This 
review compiles mechanisms and clinical evidence, emphasizing the need for 
future analysis, evaluation, trials and meta-analyses to verify and recommend 
optimal SGLT2i selection and dosage for specific patients.

Spring, MD 20910, USA.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a global public health concern. It remains one 
of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality. TBI pathology involves complex 
secondary injury cascades that are associated with cellular and molecular 
dysfunction, including oxidative stress, coagulopathy, neuroinflammation, 
neurodegeneration, neurotoxicity, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, 
among others. These pathological processes manifest as a diverse array of 
clinical impairments. They serve as targets for potential therapeutic 
intervention not only in TBI but also in other diseases. Monoclonal antibodies 
(mAbs) have been used as key therapeutic agents targeting these mechanisms for 
the treatment of diverse diseases, including neurological diseases such as 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). MAb therapies provide a tool to block disease pathways 
with target specificity that may be capable of mitigating the secondary injury 
cascades following TBI. This article reviews the pathophysiology of TBI and the 
molecular mechanisms of action of mAbs that target these shared pathological 
pathways in a wide range of diseases. Publicly available databases for various 
applications of mAb therapy were searched and further classified to assess 
relevance to TBI pathology and evaluate current stages of development. The 
authors intend for this review to highlight the potential impact of current mAb 
technology within pathological TBI processes.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent form of dementia, is 
characterized by progressive cognitive decline and behavioral disturbances, with 
an increasing incidence as the global population ages. This study investigates 
the effects of semaglutide (SEM), a glucagon-like peptide-1 analog, on cognitive 
function and anxiety-like behavior in a transgenic murine model of AD.
METHODS: 20 mice were randomly distributed into the following groups (n = 5): 
(WT + VEH) group: C57BL/6J + saline, (WT + SEM) group: C57BL/6J + semaglutide, 
(AD + VEH) group: AD + saline, (AD + SEM) group: AD + semaglutide. The animals 
underwent a four-week treatment, during which we monitored blood glucose levels, 
body weight, and responses in an open field test, novel object recognition test, 
social chamber test, and 0-maze test.
RESULTS: Post-treatment, SEM significantly reduced blood glucose levels in AD 
mice, aligning them with those of wild-type controls. Cognitive assessments 
indicated an improvement in the investigation index for SEM-treated mice 
compared to those receiving a vehicle, suggesting cognitive benefits. Although 
SEM did not significantly enhance motor and exploratory activities, it displayed 
a potential anxiolytic effect, particularly evident in the combined anxiety 
index, with notable differences observed before and after treatment in the AD 
group.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this pilot study suggest that SEM may play a dual 
role in managing AD by improving glycemic control and potentially enhancing 
cognitive function. As the landscape of AD treatment evolves, the comprehensive 
approach of utilizing SEM could pave the way for innovative interventions 
targeting the complex interplay of metabolic and cognitive dysfunctions in this 
challenging neurodegenerative disorder.

Microbiota-derived hydrogen sulfide (H2S) plays a crucial role in modulating the 
gut-brain axis, with significant implications for neurodegenerative diseases 
such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. H2S is produced by sulfate-reducing 
bacteria in the gut and acts as a critical signaling molecule influencing brain 
health via various pathways, including regulating inflammation, oxidative 
stress, and immune responses. H2S maintains gut barrier integrity at 
physiological levels and prevents systemic inflammation, which could impact 
neuroinflammation. However, as H2S has a dual role or a Janus face, excessive 
H2S production, often resulting from gut dysbiosis, can compromise the 
intestinal barrier and exacerbate neurodegenerative processes by promoting 
neuroinflammation and glial cell dysfunction. This imbalance is linked to the 
early pathogenesis of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, where the 
overproduction of H2S exacerbates beta-amyloid deposition, tau 
hyperphosphorylation, and alpha-synuclein aggregation, driving neuroinflammatory 
responses and neuronal damage. Targeting gut microbiota to restore H2S 
homeostasis through dietary interventions, probiotics, prebiotics, and fecal 
microbiota transplantation presents a promising therapeutic approach. By 
rebalancing the microbiota-derived H2S, these strategies may mitigate 
neurodegeneration and offer novel treatments for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's 
diseases, underscoring the critical role of the gut-brain axis in maintaining 
central nervous system health.

The World Health Organization in 2021 ranked Alzheimer's disease and other 
dementias as the seventh leading cause of death globally. Neurodegenerative 
disorders are progressive, intractable, and often fatal diseases. Early 
diagnosis may allow patients to enjoy prolonged survival with attenuated 
symptomatology because of early intervention. Hence, further research on finding 
non-invasive biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases is warranted. 
Apolipoprotein D (ApoD) is a glycoprotein involved in lipid metabolism, 
oxidative stress regulation, and inflammation. It is expressed in various body 
fluids and regions of the central nervous system. ApoD's roles in 
neuroprotection, lipid transport, and anti-inflammatory processes are crucial as 
far as the prevention of neurodegenerative pathologies is concerned. This review 
aims to summarize the background knowledge on ApoD, and it covers studies 
indexed in the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. It discusses the 
evidence for the multifaceted roles of ApoD in the mechanisms and pathogenesis 
of multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. ApoD may be 
a specific, sensitive, easily obtained, cost-effective biomarker for 
neurodegenerative diseases and its applications in diagnostic practices, 
treatment strategies, and advancing neurodegenerative disorders' management.

Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
and is the most common cause of dementia. Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease 
is critical for better management and treatment outcomes, but it remains a 
challenging task due to the complex nature of the disease. Clinical data, 
including a range of cognitive, functional, and demographic variables, play a 
crucial role in Alzheimer's disease classification. Also, challenges such as 
data imbalance and high-dimensional feature sets often hinder model performance. 
Objective: This paper aims to propose a computationally efficient, reliable, and 
transparent machine learning-based framework for the classification of 
Alzheimer's disease patients. This framework is interpretable and helps medical 
practitioners learn complex patterns in patients. Method: This study addresses 
these issues by employing boosting algorithms, for enhanced classification 
accuracy. To mitigate data imbalance, a random sampling technique is applied, 
ensuring a balanced representation of Alzheimer's and healthy cases. Extensive 
feature analysis was conducted to identify the most impactful clinical features 
followed by feature reduction techniques to focus on the most informative 
clinical features, reducing model complexity and overfitting risks. Explainable 
AI tools, such as SHAP, LIME, ALE, and ELI5 are integrated to provide 
transparency into the model's decision-making process, highlighting key features 
influencing the classification and allowing clinicians to understand and trust 
the key features driving the predictions. Results: This approach results in a 
robust, interpretable, and clinically relevant framework for Alzheimer's disease 
diagnosis. The proposed approach achieved the best accuracy of 95%, 
demonstrating its effectiveness and potential for reliable early diagnosis of 
Alzheimer's disease. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that integrating 
ensemble learning algorithms and explainable AI, while using a balanced dataset 
with feature selection, improves quantitative results and interpretability. This 
approach offers a promising method for early and better-informed clinical 
decisions.

Advancements in neuroimaging, particularly diffusion magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) techniques and molecular imaging with positron emission tomography (PET), 
have significantly enhanced the early detection of biomarkers in 
neurodegenerative and neuro-ophthalmic disorders. These include Alzheimer's 
disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, and 
myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody disease. This review highlights the 
transformative role of advanced diffusion MRI techniques-Neurite Orientation 
Dispersion and Density Imaging and Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging-in identifying 
subtle microstructural changes in the brain and visual pathways that precede 
clinical symptoms. When integrated with artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, 
these techniques achieve unprecedented diagnostic precision, facilitating early 
detection of neurodegeneration and inflammation. Additionally, next-generation 
PET tracers targeting misfolded proteins, such as tau and alpha-synuclein, along 
with inflammatory markers, enhance the visualization and quantification of 
pathological processes in vivo. Deep learning models, including convolutional 
neural networks and multimodal transformers, further improve diagnostic accuracy 
by integrating multimodal imaging data and predicting disease progression. 
Despite challenges such as technical variability, data privacy concerns, and 
regulatory barriers, the potential of AI-enhanced neuroimaging to revolutionize 
early diagnosis and personalized treatment in neurodegenerative and 
neuro-ophthalmic disorders is immense. This review underscores the importance of 
ongoing efforts to validate, standardize, and implement these technologies to 
maximize their clinical impact.

Pharmaceutical Sciences, The University of Toledo, Toledo, OH 43614, USA.

Age-associated alterations in the brain lead to cognitive deterioration and 
neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs). This review with a particular focus on 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), emphasizes the burgeoning significance of the gut 
microbiota (GMB) in neuroinflammation and its impact on the gut-brain axis 
(GBA), a communication conduit between the gut and the central nervous system 
(CNS). Changes in the gut microbiome, including diminished microbial diversity 
and the prevalence of pro-inflammatory bacteria, are associated with AD 
pathogenesis. Promising therapies, such as fecal microbiota transplantation 
(FMT), probiotics, and prebiotics, may restore gut health and enhance cognitive 
performance. Clinical data remain insufficient, necessitating further research 
to elucidate causes, enhance therapy, and consider individual variances. This 
integrative approach may yield innovative therapies aimed at the GMB to improve 
cognitive function and brain health in older people.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The biological basis for behavioral manifestations of 
Alzheimer's disease remains unclear. Emotional and behavioral alterations of 
Alzheimer's disease can result in substantial caregiver burden and lack 
effective management. This study expands upon previous work investigating 
behavioral alterations in mice with Alzheimer's disease and a potential 
treatment of increasing brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) using 
repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS).
METHODS: A total of 47 3xTg-AD (Alzheimer's) and 53 B6 (wildtype) mice were 
administered ANA12 (an antagonist of TrkB receptor) or Vehicle (saline) and then 
rTMS or Sham treatment daily. After 14 days of treatments and injections, mouse 
behavior was assessed under various behavioral cognitive tests. Mice were then 
perfused, and brain samples were processed for histology and protein assays. 
Brain homogenates were analyzed for BDNF and its downstream signaling molecules.
RESULTS: Open field testing demonstrated that 3xTg-AD mice spent more time in 
the center than B6 mice. 3xTg-AD-Sham mice injected with ANA12 were the only 
group to travel significantly less distance than B6-ANA12-Sham or 
B6-Vehicle-Sham mice (p < 0.05), while 3xTg-AD-rTMS mice (irrespective of 
injection) were not significantly different from B6 mice. 3xTg-AD mice had 
significantly greater measured levels of BDNF and TrkB than the wild-type mice.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of Alzheimer's disease using rTMS positively affects 
elements of hypoactivity, but not all behavioral abnormalities. rTMS shifted 
3xTg-AD open field behavioral test measures, generating significant differences 
between untreated 3xTg-AD and B6 genotypes. Despite its benefit, further 
investigation of rTMS as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease as well as its 
biological underpinnings are needed.

Alcohol consumption is believed to affect Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk, but the 
contributing mechanisms are not well understood. A potential mediator of the 
proposed alcohol-AD connection is autophagy, a degradation pathway that 
maintains organelle and protein homeostasis. Autophagy is regulated through the 
activity of Transcription factor EB (TFEB), which promotes lysosome and 
autophagy-related gene expression. The purpose of this study is to explore 
whether chronic alcohol consumption worsens the age-related decline in 
TFEB-mediated lysosomal biogenesis in the brain and exacerbates cognitive 
decline associated with aging. To explore the effect of alcohol on brain TFEB 
and autophagy, we exposed young (3-month-old) and aged (23-month-old) mice to 
two alcohol-feeding paradigms and assessed biochemical, transcriptome, 
histology, and behavioral endpoints. In young mice, alcohol decreased 
hippocampal nuclear TFEB staining but increased SQSTM1/p62, LC3-II, 
ubiquitinated proteins, and phosphorylated Tau. Hippocampal TFEB activity was 
lower in aged mice than it was in young mice, and Gao-binge alcohol feeding did 
not worsen the age-related reduction in TFEB activity. Morris Water and Barnes 
Maze spatial memory tasks were used to characterize the effects of aging and 
chronic alcohol exposure (mice fed alcohol for 4 weeks). The aged mice showed 
worse spatial memory acquisition in both tests. Alcohol feeding slightly 
impaired spatial memory in the young mice, but had little effect or even 
slightly improved spatial memory acquisition in the aged mice. In conclusion, 
aging produces greater reductions in brain autophagy flux and impairment of 
spatial memory than alcohol consumption.

Based on the established neuroprotective properties of indole-based compounds 
and their significant potential as multi-targeted therapeutic agents, a series 
of synthetic indole-phenolic compounds was evaluated as multifunctional 
neuroprotectors. Each compound demonstrated metal-chelating properties, 
particularly in sequestering copper ions, with quantitative analysis revealing 
approximately 40% chelating activity across all the compounds. In cellular 
models, these hybrid compounds exhibited strong antioxidant and cytoprotective 
effects, countering reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by the Aβ(25-35) 
peptide and its oxidative byproduct, hydrogen peroxide, as demonstrated by 
quantitative analysis showing on average a 25% increase in cell viability and a 
reduction in ROS levels to basal states. Further analysis using thioflavin T 
fluorescence assays, circular dichroism, and computational studies indicated 
that the synthesized derivatives effectively promoted the self-disaggregation of 
the Aβ(25-35) fragment. Taken together, these findings suggest a unique profile 
of neuroprotective actions for indole-phenolic derivatives, combining chelating, 
antioxidant, and anti-aggregation properties, which position them as promising 
compounds for the development of multifunctional agents in Alzheimer's disease 
therapy. The methods used provide reliable in vitro data, although further in 
vivo validation and assessment of blood-brain barrier penetration are needed to 
confirm therapeutic efficacy and safety.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is characterized by deterioration in cognitive 
function and neuronal death, is the most prevalent age-related progressive 
neurodegenerative disease. Clinical and experimental research has revealed that 
gut microbiota dysbiosis may be present in AD patients. The changed gut 
microbiota affects brain function and behavior through several mechanisms, 
including tau phosphorylation and increased amyloid deposits, neuroinflammation, 
metabolic abnormalities, and persistent oxidative stress. The lack of effective 
treatments to halt or reverse the progression of this disease has prompted a 
search for non-pharmaceutical tools. Modulation of the gut microbiota may be a 
promising strategy in this regard. This review aims to determine whether 
specific dietary interventions, particularly antioxidant vitamins, either 
obtained from the diet or as supplements, may support the formation of 
beneficial microbiota in order to prevent AD development by contributing to the 
systemic reduction of chronic inflammation or by acting locally in the gut. 
Understanding their roles would be beneficial as it may have the potential to be 
used as a future therapy option for AD patients.

The enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) plays a crucial role in the termination 
of nerve impulses by hydrolyzing the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh). The 
inhibition of AChE has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach for the 
management of neurological disorders such as Lewy body dementia and Alzheimer's 
disease. The potential of various compounds as AChE inhibitors was investigated. 
In this study, we evaluated the impact of natural compounds of interest on the 
intrinsic deformability of human AChE using computational biophysical analysis. 
Our approach incorporates classical dynamics, elastic networks (ENM and NMA), 
statistical potentials (CUPSAT and SWOTein), energy frustration 
(Frustratometer), and volumetric cavity analyses (MOLE and PockDrug). The 
results revealed that cyanidin induced significant changes in the flexibility 
and rigidity of AChE, especially in the distribution and volume of internal 
cavities, compared to model inhibitors such as TZ2PA6, and through a distinct 
biophysical-molecular mechanism from the other inhibitors considered. These 
findings suggest that cyanidin could offer potential mechanistic pathways for 
future research and applications in the development of new treatments for 
neurodegenerative diseases.

Histone methyltransferases (HMTs) and histone demethylases (HDMs) are critical 
enzymes that regulate chromatin dynamics and gene expression through the 
addition and removal of methyl groups on histone proteins. HMTs, such as PRC2 
and SETD2, are involved in the trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 and 
lysine 36, influencing gene silencing and activation. Dysregulation of these 
enzymes often leads to abnormal gene expression and contributes to 
tumorigenesis. In contrast, HDMs including KDM7A and KDM2A reverse these 
methylation marks, and their dysfunction can drive disease progression. In 
cancer, the aberrant activity of specific HMTs and HDMs can lead to the 
silencing of tumor suppressor genes or the activation of oncogenes, facilitating 
tumor progression and resistance to therapy. Conversely, in neurodegenerative 
diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and 
Huntington's disease (HD), disruptions in histone methylation dynamics are 
associated with neuronal loss, altered gene expression, and disease progression. 
We aimed to comprehend the odd activity of HMTs and HDMs and how they contribute 
to disease pathogenesis, highlighting their potential as therapeutic targets. By 
advancing our understanding of these epigenetic regulators, this review provides 
new insights into their roles in cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, offering 
a foundation for future research.

Individuals, families, and communities are impacted by Alzheimer's disease and 
other dementias worldwide. In Canada and elsewhere, family members commonly see 
loved ones living with dementia experience difficult moments, including anxiety, 
stress, and fear. Struggling health care systems strive to apply the latest 
evidence-based interventions. In this case report, we explore how individuals 
who care for people with dementia can help redirect difficult personal and 
interpersonal moments towards hopeful moments in the presence of therapy dogs. 
The cases of four individuals diagnosed with dementia and interacting with 
therapy dog intervention in one of three environments-at a family home, in a 
hospital awaiting placement to a long-term care facility, and in a psychiatric 
centre-are reviewed from the perspectives of two attending therapy dog handlers. 
In addition to being researchers in the therapy dog field and authors on this 
case report, both handlers were guided in a 110 min focused conversational 
method by a third author, from which self-affirmation theory surfaced as a 
guiding framework for explaining their observations and experiences. Therapy dog 
visiting appears to facilitate positive social interactions that can help 
redirect difficult moments to moments defined by self-affirmation or 
experiencing a positive sense of self. This is an under-recognized association 
in the dementia literature. Self-affirmation is demonstrated through four themes 
during therapy dog visits: (a) physical movement, (b) psychological shift, (c) a 
transition in the experience of time, and (d) connective interactions. Therapy 
dogs are identified here as a promising self-affirming psychosocial intervention 
for individuals with dementia and their caregivers worthy of further research 
and practice attention.

Cellular senescence is a cell state triggered by programmed physiological 
processes or cellular stress responses. Stress-induced senescent cells often 
acquire pathogenic traits, including a toxic secretome and resistance to 
apoptosis. When pathogenic senescent cells form faster than they are cleared by 
the immune system, they accumulate in tissues throughout the body and contribute 
to age-related diseases, including neurodegeneration. This review highlights 
evidence of pathogenic senescent cells in the brain and their role in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), the leading cause of dementia in older adults. We also 
discuss the progress and challenges of senotherapies, pharmacological strategies 
to clear senescent cells or mitigate their toxic effects, which hold promise as 
interventions for AD and related dementias (ADRD).

Mild cognitive impairment is a diagnostic category marked by declines in memory 
and cognitive function that are less severe than those observed in Alzheimer's 
disease. Previous studies have indicated that individuals with mild cognitive 
impairment have an elevated risk of progressing to Alzheimer's disease. The 
hippocampus is well known to play pivotal roles in memory and cognitive 
functions. Scopolamine (Sco) disrupts cholinergic neurotransmission in the 
hippocampus and triggers functional declines in memory and cognition. SHCog™ is 
a commercially available alpha glycerophosphorylcholine (α-GPC) derived from 
soybean lecithin. The objective of the present study was to examine whether 
SHCog™ can alleviate memory and cognitive dysfunctions in a mouse model of 
cognitive impairments induced by Sco. In this study, C57BL/6 J mice were 
subjected to the passive avoidance and Morris water maze tests to investigate 
short-term and spatial memory functions, respectively. This study also examined 
cellular morphology and distribution by cresyl violet staining and investigated 
changes in acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) as 
cholinergic enzymes through immunohistochemical staining of the hippocampus. 
Additionally, we examined changes in postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) 
and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) related to neural plasticity in the 
hippocampus. Treatment with SHCog™ (125 mg/kg and 250 mg/kg) brought functional 
recovery in short-term and spatial memory against Sco-induced memory and 
cognitive impairments. Changes in cellular morphology and distribution in the 
hippocampus were not detected following the administration of Sco and/or SHCog™. 
Treatment with SHCog™ reduced AChE elevated by Sco, whereas SHCog™ 
administration increased ChAT decreased by Sco. Furthermore, SHCog™ restored 
PSD-95 and BDNF in the mouse hippocampus reduced by Sco. Specifically, SHCog™ 
modulated cholinergic neurotransmission and enhanced neural plasticity in the 
hippocampus. Taken together, we suggest that SHCog™ can be a valuable ingredient 
in functional foods or supplements for improving memory and cognitive functions.

Dementia is a group of diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular 
dementia, Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson's disease 
dementia, metabolic dementia and toxic dementia. The treatment of dementia 
mainly includes symptomatic treatment by controlling the primary disease and 
accompanying symptoms, nutritional support therapy for repairing nerve cells, 
psychological auxiliary treatment, and treatment that improves cognitive 
function through drugs. Among them, drug therapy to improve cognitive function 
is important. This review focuses on introducing and commenting on some recent 
progress in exploring drugs to improve cognitive function, especially the new 
progress in drug treatment for AD. We mainly discuss the opportunities and 
challenges in finding and developing new therapeutic drugs from the aspects of 
acetylcholinesterase, N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor, amyloid protein, 
tau protein and chronic immune inflammation.

BACKGROUND: While semaglutide, approved for type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), is 
being investigated as a treatment for brain disorders, concerns over adverse 
neuropsychiatric events have emerged. More data are therefore needed to assess 
the effects of semaglutide on brain health. This study provides robust estimates 
of the risk of neurological and psychiatric outcomes following semaglutide use 
compared to three other antidiabetic medications.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used electronic health records from 
TriNetX US Collaborative Network, covering >100 million patients in the USA. Due 
to the exploratory nature of this study, we did not use a pre-registered 
protocol or statistical analysis plan. Three cohorts with T2DM prescribed 
semaglutide between 1st December 2017 and 31st May 2021 were propensity-score 
matched (1:1 using a greedy nearest-neighbour algorithm with calliper distance 
of 0.1) with cohorts receiving sitagliptin, empagliflozin, and glipizide. Using 
Cox regression analysis, we compared the risks of 22 neurological and 
psychiatric outcomes within one year since the index prescription: encephalitis, 
parkinsonism, cognitive deficit, dementia, epilepsy/seizure, migraine, insomnia, 
nerve disorder, myoneural junction/muscle disease, intracranial haemorrhage, 
ischaemic stroke, alcohol misuse, opioid misuse, cannabis misuse, stimulants 
misuse, nicotine misuse, psychosis, bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, 
obsessive-compulsive disorder, and suicidality. Negative control outcomes (NCOs) 
were used to assess unmeasured confounding.
FINDINGS: Each matched cohort included 23,386 (semaglutide vs sitagliptin), 
22,584 (vs empagliflozin), and 19,206 (vs glipizide) patients. Semaglutide was 
not associated with an increased risk of neurological and psychiatric outcomes. 
Instead, after multiple-testing correction, semaglutide was associated with 
reduced risk for several such outcomes, notably cognitive deficit compared to 
sitagliptin (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.64-0.80) and glipizide (HR 0.72, 95% CI 
0.63-0.81), dementia compared to sitagliptin (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.40-0.68), and 
nicotine misuse across most comparisons (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61-0.85 against 
glipizide; HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.65-0.90 against empagliflozin; HR 0.82, 95% CI 
0.70-0.95 against sitagliptin, though the latter was no longer statistically 
significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons). Empagliflozin showed 
fewest differences from semaglutide. No differences in NCOs were observed 
between cohorts.
INTERPRETATION: Semaglutide is not associated with higher 12-month risk of 
adverse neuropsychiatric outcomes compared to other antidiabetic medications. 
Potential beneficial associations with some outcomes, especially cognitive 
deficit and nicotine misuse, should stimulate validation in clinical trials.

BACKGROUND: As a key inflammatory factor, the nucleotide-binding oligomerization 
domain (NOD)-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome plays a crucial role 
in neuroinflammation and the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. 
Dysregulation of NLRP3 signaling can trigger various inflammatory responses in 
the brain, contributing to the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as 
ischemic stroke, vascular dementia (VaD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's 
disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Therefore, the NLRP3 
signaling pathway is a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of 
neurodegenerative diseases, including VaD.
METHODS: In this study, we investigated the therapeutic effects of a synthetic 
sulfonylurea NLRP3 inhibitor, AMS-17, in a VaD mouse model using bilateral 
common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) and elucidated the underlying mechanisms. 
All mice were randomly divided into three groups: Sham, VaD + Vehicle, and VaD + 
AMS-17. Cognitive function was assessed using the Y-maze and Morris water maze 
(MWM) on the 50th day after BCAS. Brain sections and blood serum samples were 
collected for biomarker analysis and immunohistochemistry. Neurodegeneration, 
expressions of the molecules involved in the NLRP3 signaling pathways, tight 
junction proteins, and myelination were assessed using western blotting and 
immunofluorescence (IF). The levels of Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), Tumor 
Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α) and Interleukin-4 (IL-4) in the blood were 
measured using ELISA.
RESULTS: AMS-17 treatment improved cognitive function, enhanced blood-brain 
barrier (BBB) integrity, and promoted remyelination in VaD mice. Additionally, 
AMS-17 reduced neurodegeneration and decreased the expression of NLRP3 and its 
associated proteins, Apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC), and cleaved 
caspase-1 in the brain. It also lowered pro-inflammatory TNF-α and IL-1β levels, 
while increasing the anti-inflammatory IL-4 level in the blood.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study provide the first promising evidence for 
the use of AMS-17 in VaD treatment in mice. This study introduces AMS-17 as a 
novel chemical scaffold with NLRP3 inhibitory activity, which can be further 
developed for the treatment of VaD in humans.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurological condition characterized 
by a loss in cognitive functions, with no disease-modifying medication now 
available. It is crucial for early detection and treatment of Alzheimer's 
disease before clinical manifestation. The stage between cognitively healthy 
older persons and AD is known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). To predict the 
transition from one-stage MCI to probable AD, five ensemble learning approach 
was used (Stacking, Gradient boost Bagging, Adaptive boost and Voting), an 
integrated model that combines not only cross-sectional neuroimaging biomarkers 
at baseline but also longitudinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and cognitive 
performance biomarkers from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
cohort (ADNI). The adaptive boost, stacking and bagging ensemble approach has 
shown potential to identify those at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, 
this would benefit them the most from a clinical trial or to use as a 
stratification approach inside clinical trials.

Excess lipid droplet (LD) accumulation is associated with several pathological 
states, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the mechanism(s) by which 
changes in LD composition and dynamics contribute to pathophysiology of these 
disorders remains unclear. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is a droplet associated 
protein with a common risk variant (E4) that confers the largest increase in 
genetic risk for late-onset AD. E4 is associated with both increased 
neuroinflammation and excess LD accumulation. In the current study, we sought to 
quantitatively profile the lipid and protein composition of LDs between the 
'neutral' E3 and risk variant E4, to gain insight into potential LD-driven 
contributions to AD pathogenesis. Targeted replacement mice expressing human E3 
or E4 were injected with saline or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and after 24 hours, 
hepatic lipid droplets were isolated for proteomic and lipidomic analyses. 
Lipidomics revealed a shift in the distribution of glycerophospholipids in E4 
LDs with a concomitant increase in phosphatidylcholine species, and overall, the 
baseline profile of E4 LDs resembled that of the LPS-treated groups. 
Quantitative proteomics showed that LDs from E4 mice are enriched for proteins 
involved in protein/vesicle transport but have decreased levels of proteins 
involved in fatty acid β-oxidation. Interestingly, proteins associated with LDs 
showed substantial overlap with previously published lists of AD postmortem 
tissue and microglia 'omics studies, suggesting a potential role for LDs in 
modulating AD risk or progression. Given this, we exposed primary microglia from 
the same E3 or E4 mice to exogenous lipid, inflammatory stimulation, necroptotic 
N2A cells (nN2A), or a combination of treatments to evaluate LD formation and 
its impact on the cells' immune state. Microglia from E4 mice accumulated more 
LDs in every condition tested - at baseline and following addition of fatty 
acids, LPS stimulation, or nN2As. E4 microglia also secreted significantly more 
cytokines (TNF, IL-1β, IL-10) than E3 microglia in the control, oleic acid, and 
nN2A treatment conditions, yet showed a blunted response to LPS. In sum, these 
results suggest that E4 microglia accumulate more LDs compared to E3 microglia 
and that E4 is associated with a basal LD composition that resembles a 
pro-inflammatory cell. Together with the high overlap of the LD proteome with 
established AD-associated datasets, these data further support the idea that 
alterations in LD dynamics, particularly within microglia, may contribute to the 
increased risk for AD associated with APOE4 .

Response of Serum-isolated Extracellular Vesicles to Focused Ultrasound 
Blood-Brain Barrier Opening.

The blood-brain barrier (BBB) limits drug delivery to the brain and the movement 
of neurological biomarkers between the brain and blood. Focused 
ultrasound-mediated blood-brain barrier opening (FUS-BBBO) noninvasively opens 
the BBB, allowing increased molecular transport to and from the brain 
parenchyma. Despite being initially developed as a drug delivery method, 
FUS-BBBO has shown promise both as a neuroimmunotherapeutic modality, and as a 
way of improving neurological disease diagnosis via amplification of disease 
biomarker circulation. Recently, the role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in 
modulating the neuroimmune system and in improving biomarker detection has 
sparked research interest. However, despite their potential role in modulating 
FUS-BBBO-induced neuroimmunotherapy and their ability to improve biomarker 
specificity after treatment, the EV response to FUS-BBBO had not been 
extensively characterized prior to this study. In this study, we investigated 
the effect of FUS-BBBO on EV concentration and content in the serum of mice and 
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients. We observed a 164% increase in murine EV 
concentration one hour after treatment, as well as an increase in EV RNA 
associated with FUS-BBBO neuroimmunotherapy. Patient EV concentration also 
increased one hour after treatment and was dependent on the volume of BBB 
opening three days post-treatment. Furthermore, EV isolation was found to 
significantly enhance the amplification of AD biomarker detection by FUS-BBBO. 
Overall, we present the first evidence of altered murine and AD patient EV 
concentration and content in response to FUS-BBBO, providing evidence of EVs' 
role within FUS-BBBO neuroimmunotherapy as well as their utility in improving 
FUS-BBBO biomarker amplification.

OBJECTIVE: Bile acids may contribute to pathophysiologic markers of Alzheimer's 
disease, including disruptions of the executive control network (ECN) and the 
default mode network (DMN). Cognitive dysfunction is common in major depressive 
disorder (MDD), but whether bile acids impact these networks in MDD patients is 
unknown.
METHODS: Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans and 
blood measures of four bile acids from 74 treatment-naïve adults with MDD were 
analyzed. Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) seeds were used to examine 
connectivity of the ECN and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) seeds were used for 
the DMN. Using a whole-brain analysis, the functional connectivity of these 
seeds was correlated with serum levels chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and its 
bacterially-derived secondary bile acid, lithocholic acid (LCA).
RESULTS: CDCA levels were strongly and inversely correlated with connectivity 
between DLPFC regions of the ECN (R 2 = .401, p<.001). LCA levels were strongly 
and positively correlated with connectivity of the DLPFC and left inferior 
temporal cortex of the ECN (R 2 =.263, p<.001). The LCA/CDCA ratio was strongly 
and positively correlated with connectivity of the DLPFC with two components of 
the ECN: bilateral inferior temporal cortex and the left superior and inferior 
parietal lobules (all R 2 >.24, all p<.001). For the DMN, the LCA/CDCA ratio was 
strongly and negatively correlated with connectivity of the PCC with multiple 
bilateral insula regions (all R 2 >0.25, all p<.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between LCA and CDCA levels and functional 
connectivity of the ECN and DMN suggests potential shared pathophysiologic 
processes between Alzheimer's disease and MDD.

INTRODUCTION: Diabetes is a metabolic disorder of glucose homeostasis that is a 
significant risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's 
disease, as well as mood disorders, which often precede neurodegenerative 
conditions. We examined the medial habenulainterpeduncular nucleus (MHb-IPN), as 
this circuit plays crucial roles in mood regulation, has been linked to the 
development of diabetes after smoking, and is rich in cholinergic neurons, which 
are affected in other brain areas in Alzheimer's disease.
METHODS: This study aimed to investigate the impact of streptozotocin 
(STZ)-induced hyperglycemia, a type 1 diabetes model, on mitochondrial and lipid 
homeostasis in 4% paraformaldehyde-fixed sections from the MHb and IPN of 
C57BL/6 J male mice, using a recently developed automated pipeline for 
mitochondrial analysis in confocal images. We examined different time points 
after STZ-induced diabetes onset to determine how the brain responded to chronic 
hyperglycemia, with the limitation that mitochondria and lipids were not 
examined with respect to cell type or intracellular location.
RESULTS: Mitochondrial distribution and morphology differentially responded to 
hyperglycemia depending on time and brain area. Six weeks after STZ treatment, 
mitochondria in the ventral MHb and dorsal IPN increased in number and exhibited 
altered morphology, but no changes were observed in the lateral habenula (LHb) 
or ventral IPN. Strikingly, mitochondrial numbers returned to normal dynamics at 
12 weeks. Both blood glucose level and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) correlated 
with mitochondrial dynamics in ventral MHb, whereas only HbA1C correlated in the 
IPN. We also examined lipid homeostasis using BODIPY staining for neutral lipids 
in this model given that diabetes is associated with disrupted lipid 
homeostasis. BODIPY staining intensity was unchanged in the vMHb of STZ-treated 
mice but increased in the IPN and VTA and decreased in the LHb at 12 weeks. 
Interestingly, areas that demonstrated changes in mitochondria had little change 
in lipid staining and vice versa.
DISCUSSION: This study is the first to describe the specific impacts of diabetes 
on mitochondria in the MHb-IPN circuit and suggests that the cholinergic MHb is 
uniquely sensitive to diabetesinduced hyperglycemia. Further studies are needed 
to understand the functional and behavioral implications of these findings.

Increasing evidence suggests the involvement of metabolic alterations in 
neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), and highlights the 
significance of the peripheral metabolome, influenced by genetic factors and 
modifiable environmental exposures, for brain health. In this study, we examined 
1,387 metabolites in plasma samples from 1,082 dementia-free middle-aged 
participants of the population-based Rotterdam Study. We assessed the relation 
of metabolites with general cognition (G-factor) and magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) markers using linear regression and estimated the variance of these 
metabolites explained by genes, gut microbiome, lifestyle factors, common 
clinical comorbidities, and medication using gradient boosting decision tree 
analysis. Twenty-one metabolites and one metabolite were significantly 
associated with total brain volume and total white matter lesions, respectively. 
Fourteen metabolites showed significant associations with G-factor, with 
ergothioneine exhibiting the largest effect (adjusted mean difference = 0.122, P 
= 4.65×10-7). Associations for nine of the 14 metabolites were replicated in an 
independent, older cohort. The metabolite signature of incident AD in the 
replication cohort resembled that of cognition in the discovery cohort, 
emphasizing the potential relevance of the identified metabolites to disease 
pathogenesis. Lifestyle, clinical variables, and medication were most important 
in determining these metabolites' blood levels, with lifestyle, explaining up to 
28.6% of the variance. Smoking was associated with ten metabolites linked to 
G-factor, while diabetes and antidiabetic medication were associated with 13 
metabolites linked to MRI markers, including N-lactoyltyrosine. Antacid 
medication strongly affected ergothioneine levels. Mediation analysis revealed 
that lower ergothioneine levels may partially mediate negative effects of 
antacids on cognition (31.5%). Gut microbial factors were more important for the 
blood levels of metabolites that were more strongly associated with cognition 
and incident AD in the older replication cohort (beta-cryptoxanthin, imidazole 
propionate), suggesting they may be involved later in the disease process. The 
detailed results on how multiple modifiable factors affect blood levels of 
cognition- and brain imaging-related metabolites in dementia-free participants 
may help identify new AD prevention strategies.

Stratification of Alzheimer's Disease Patients Using Knowledge-Guided 
Unsupervised Latent Factor Clustering with Electronic Health Record Data.

Wang L, Venkatesh S, Morris M, Li M, Srivastava R, Visweswaran S, Lopez O, Xia 
Z, Cai T.

BACKGROUND: People with Alzheimer's disease (AD) exhibit varying clinical 
trajectories. There is a need to predict future AD-related outcomes such as 
morbidity and mortality using clinical profile at the point of care.
OBJECTIVE: To stratify AD patients based on baseline clinical profiles (up to 
two years prior to AD diagnosis) and update the model after AD diagnosis to 
prognosticate future AD-related outcomes.
METHODS: Using the electronic health record (EHR) data of a large healthcare 
system (2011-2022), we first identified patients with ≥1 diagnosis code for AD 
or related dementia and applied a validated unsupervised phenotyping algorithm 
to assign AD diagnosis status. Next, we applied an unsupervised latent factor 
clustering approach, guided by knowledge graph embeddings of relevant EHR 
features up to the baseline, to cluster patients into two groups at AD 
diagnosis. We then prognosticated the risk of two readily ascertainable and 
clinically relevant AD-related outcomes ( i.e., nursing home admission 
indicating greater need for assistance and mortality), adjusting for baseline 
confounders ( e.g., age, gender, race, ethnicity, healthcare utilization, and 
comorbidities). For patients remaining at risk one year post-diagnosis, we 
updated their group membership and repeated the prognostication.
RESULTS: We stratified 16,411 algorithm-identified AD patients into two groups 
based on their baseline clinical profiles (41% Group 1, 59% Group 2). Patients 
in Group 1 were marginally older at AD diagnosis (age Mean [SD]: 81.4 [9.3] vs 
81.0 [8.7], p =.007), exhibited greater comorbidity burden (Elixhauser 
comorbidity index Mean [SD]: 11.3 [10.3] vs 7.5 [8.6], p <.0001), and more 
frequently received AD-related medications (47.7% vs 40.9%, p <.0001) than those 
in Group 2. Compared to Group 1, Group 2 had a lower risk of nursing home 
admission (HR [95% CI]=0.804 [0.765, 0.844], p <.001), while the two groups had 
similar mortality risk (HR [95% CI]=1.008 [0.963, 1.056], p =.733). One year 
after AD diagnosis, 12,606 patients remained at risk (45.7% Group 1, 54.3% Group 
2). Consistent with baseline findings, Group 2 had a lower risk of nursing home 
admission than (HR [95% CI]=0.815 [0.766, 0.868], p <.001) and similar mortality 
risk as (HR [95% CI]=0.977 [0.922, 1.035], p =0.430) Group 1 in the updated 
model.
CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to stratify patients based on readily available 
clinical profiles before AD diagnosis and crucially to update the model one year 
after diagnosis to effectively prognosticate future AD-related outcomes.
SHORT ABSTRACT: Prognostication for people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) at the 
point of care could improve clinical management. Applying a novel unsupervised 
latent factor clustering approach guided by knowledge graph embeddings of 
relevant clinical features from electronic health records, we stratified 16,411 
AD patients into two groups at diagnosis and prognosticated their risk of 
AD-related outcomes ( i.e., nursing home admission, mortality), adjusting for 
baseline confounders. To reflect real-world evolution in clinical trajectories, 
we updated patient stratification for 12,606 AD patients remaining at risk 
1-year post-diagnosis and repeated prognostication. At both timepoints, one 
group had a higher nursing home admission risk and exhibited characteristics 
suggesting greater symptom burden, but the mortality risk remained comparable 
between groups. This study supports that patient stratification can enable 
outcome prognosis for AD patients. While baseline prognostication can guide 
early treatment and tailored management, dynamic prognostication may inform more 
timely interventions to improve long-term outcomes.

Neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's 
disease, present formidable challenges in modern medicine due to their complex 
pathologies and the absence of curative treatments. Despite advances in 
symptomatic management, early diagnosis remains essential for mitigating disease 
progression and improving patient outcomes. Traditional diagnostic methods, such 
as MRI, PET, and cerebrospinal fluid biomarker analysis, are often inadequate 
for the early detection of these diseases. Emerging porous materials, including 
metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent-organic frameworks (COFs), MXene, 
zeolites, and porous silicon, offer promising new approaches for the early 
diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. These materials, characterized by 
highly tunable physicochemical properties, have the potential to capture and 
concentrate disease-specific biomarkers such as amyloid-beta (Aβ), tau protein, 
and alpha-synuclein (α-Syn). The integration of these materials into advanced 
biosensors for real-time detection holds the promise of revolutionizing 
neurodiagnostic, enabling non-invasive, highly sensitive, and specific detection 
platforms. Furthermore, the incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) and 
machine learning (ML) techniques into the analysis of sensor data enhances 
diagnostic accuracy and allows for more efficient interpretation of complex 
biomarker profiles. AI and ML can optimize feature selection, improve pattern 
recognition, and facilitate the prediction of disease progression, making them 
indispensable tools for personalized medicine. This review explores the 
potential of porous materials in neurodegenerative disease diagnostics, 
emphasizing their design, functionality, and the synergistic role of AI and ML 
in advancing clinical applications.

BACKGROUND: Fluoroethylnormemantine (FENM), a new Memantine (MEM) derivative, 
prevented amyloid-β[25-35] peptide (Aβ25-35)-induced neurotoxicity in mice, a 
pharmacological model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with high predictive value for 
drug discovery. Here, as drug infusion is likely to better reflect drug 
bioavailability due to the interspecies pharmacokinetics variation, we analyzed 
the efficacy of FENM after chronic subcutaneous (SC) infusion, in comparison 
with IP injections in two AD mouse models, Aβ25-35-injected mice and the 
transgenic APPswe/PSEN1∂E9 (APP/PS1) line.
METHODS: In Aβ25-35-treated mice, FENM was infused at 0.03-0.3 mg/kg/day during 
one week after Aβ25-35 injection. For comparison, FENM and MEM were administered 
IP daily at 0.03-0.3 mg/kg. In 10-month-old APP/PS1 mice, FENM was administered 
during four weeks by daily IP injections at 0.3 mg/kg or chronic SC infusion at 
0.1 mg/kg/day. Memory deficits, spatial working memory and recognition memory, 
were analysed. Markers of neuroinflammation, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and 
amyloid burden in APP/PS1 mice, were quantified. Markers of synaptic plasticity 
such as PSD-95 and GluN2A/B/D subunits expression in hippocampus homogenates or 
synaptosomes were quantified in Aβ25-35-treated mice and synaptic long-term 
potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal slices was analysed in APP/PS1 mice.
RESULTS: Deficits in spontaneous alternation and object recognition in Aβ25-35 
mice were prevented by infused FENM at all doses tested. Similar effects were 
observed with the daily FENM or MEM treatments. Animals infused with 
0.1 mg/kg/day FENM showed prevention of Aβ25-35-induced neuroinflammation, 
oxidative stress and apoptosis. FENM infusion restored Aβ25-35-induced 
alterations in synaptosomal PSD-95, GluN2A and P-GluN2B levels. GluN2D levels 
were unchanged whatever the treatment. In APP/PS1 mice, FENM infused or 
administered IP alleviated spontaneous alternation deficits, neuroinflammation, 
increases in Aβ1-40/Aβ1-42 and hippocampal LTP alteration.
CONCLUSION: These data confirmed the neuroprotective potential of FENM in the 
pharmacological Aβ25-35 and transgenic APP/PS1 mouse models of AD, with a 
superiority to MEM, and showed that the drug can be efficiently infused 
chronically.

BACKGROUND: Changes in amyloid beta (Aβ) and phosphorylated tau brain levels are 
known to affect brain network organization but very little is known about how 
plasma markers can relate to these measures. We aimed to address the 
relationship between centrality network changes and two plasma pathology 
markers: phosphorylated tau at threonine 231 (p-tau231), a proxy for early Aβ 
change, and neurofilament light chain (Nfl), a marker of axonal degeneration.
METHODS: One hundred and four cognitively unimpaired individuals were divided 
into a high pathology load (33 individuals; HP) group and a low pathology (71 
individuals; LP) one. All participants underwent a magnetoencephalography (MEG) 
recording, a neuropsychological evaluation and plasma sampling. With the MEG 
recordings, a compound centrality score for each brain source was calculated 
that considered both intra- and inter-band links. For each group, the 
relationship between this centrality score and the two plasma markers was 
studied by means of correlation analyses. Furthermore, the relationship between 
the centrality score and the plasma markers among the HP and LP groups was 
compared. Lastly, we investigated whether hubs were more intensely affected by 
these changes.
RESULTS: Increasing concentrations of p-tau231, which is a proxy of Aβ 
pathology, were associated with greater theta centrality score of posterior 
areas that increased their connectedness in the theta range with the remaining 
areas, regardless of the latter's frequency range. The opposite relationship was 
found for left areas that decreased their centrality score in the gamma 
frequency range. These results only emerged for HP individuals, who showed a 
significantly different relationship between centrality and p-tau231 compared to 
LP individuals. Hubs' centrality score in the theta band was significantly more 
affected by p-tau231 levels compared to less central regions.
CONCLUSIONS: Early brain network reorganizations in cognitively unimpaired 
individuals are associated with elevated plasma p-tau231, a proxy for very early 
Aβ changes, only among individuals who show signs of a higher pathology load. 
Posterior centrality score increases in the theta band are congruent with 
previous literature and theoretical models, while gamma centrality score losses 
could be associated with inhibitory neuron dysfunction. Hubs were more intensely 
affected by p-tau231, and changed to a higher degree, thus corroborating hubs' 
vulnerability.

BACKGROUND: Non-pharmacological dementia research products, such as social and 
behavioural interventions, are generated in traditional university settings. 
These often experience challenges to impact practices that they were developed 
for. The Netherlands established five specialized academic health science 
centres, referred to as Alzheimer Centres, to structurally coordinate and 
facilitate the utilization of dementia research knowledge. This study leverages 
implementation science to systematically explore the research utilization 
strategies used by academic researchers from each Alzheimer Centre, on the basis 
of the "knowledge-to-action" (KTA) framework that includes knowledge creation, 
adaptation, dissemination and implementation.
METHODS: Individual semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with 
29 respondents across the five Alzheimer Centres in the Netherlands. 
Participants were selected through purposive (snowball) sampling. Interviews 
were conducted in-person and virtually through Microsoft Teams, and all were 
audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data analysis was guided by the 
dimensions of the KTA framework.
RESULT: There was a high variation in the strategies used across the five 
Alzheimer Centres to bring non-pharmacological dementia research into practice. 
Selected strategies in each Centre were influenced by the typology of research 
products produced and the Centres' organizational heritage. The knowledge 
creation and adaptation phases were mainly facilitated by funders' guidance 
towards research impact and research product co-creation with patients and 
implementing organizations. Dissemination and implementation phases were often 
facilitated through utilizing support from university-based technology transfer 
offices to facilitate implementation and valorization and establishing and 
strategically leveraging formal infrastructure, such as public-private 
partnerships and professional collaborative networks.
CONCLUSIONS: Successful research utilization requires evolving researcher 
competencies to meet environmental demands and facilitating co-creation with 
research end-users and implementing partners. Understanding external 
determinants influencing research utilization in the Dutch dementia research 
ecosystem is crucial for capacity-building and aligning cross-sector agendas. 
The KTA framework appears to reveal the intricacies of research utilization, 
guiding future studies to explore strategies employed across various contexts.

BACKGROUND: Hypertension management is a national priority. However, 
hypertension control rates are suboptimal and vary across clinics, even among 
those in the same health system and geographic region.
OBJECTIVE: To identify organizational barriers and facilitators that impact 
hypertension management at the provider, clinic, and health system level.
DESIGN: Semi-structured interviews were conducted to assess patient and provider 
experiences with hypertension care.
PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-five providers and 22 patients with uncontrolled 
hypertension were recruited from thirteen high- and low-performing primary care 
clinics across two health systems in North Carolina and Kansas.
APPROACH: Interviews were analyzed using both inductive and deductive coding 
methodologies. A health equity framework scaffolded interview guide design and 
codebook development, with thematic analysis employed to categorize emergent 
themes.
KEY RESULTS: Participants discussed organizational and clinic-level barriers and 
facilitators that impact hypertension management, with health systems' resource 
centralization being frequently mentioned. Some participants lauded centralized 
interventions for improving patient access and increasing touchpoints, while 
others lamented reductions in clinic staffing to accommodate centralized 
workflows. Insufficient in-clinic staffing and blood pressure (BP) measurement 
equipment, limited exam rooms, short appointment duration, and hurried clinic 
environments were all mentioned as challenges to hypertension management, 
particularly as they hindered adherence to BP recheck policies. Appointment 
availability was mentioned as a barrier; however, some providers referenced 
clinics' use of virtual and/or nurse-specific visits as a mechanism to increase 
patient access. Multiple providers noted that tasks central to hypertension 
management, like BP telemonitoring and MyChart correspondence, go unaccounted 
for on their schedules and can lead to unpaid work, which they linked with 
increased stress and burnout.
CONCLUSIONS: Primary care clinics experience multiple interrelated 
organizational barriers to effective hypertension management. Future studies 
should examine the impact of different clinic staffing models, including 
multidisciplinary care teams, telemedicine, and remote BP monitoring, on BP 
outcomes in diverse primary care settings.

Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by physical, cognitive, and behavioral impairments. The PSP Rating 
Scale (PSPRS) is a widely used and validated, clinical scale to monitor disease 
progression. Here we show the modification of PSPRS to improve clinical 
meaningfulness and sensitivity. A conceptual framework was used to select 
meaningful items. Datasets were analyzed to improve the psychometric properties, 
understand factor structure, and develop a scoring algorithm. Fifteen items of 
the PSPRS were selected based on whether the items reflect concepts specific to 
the disease and those responsive to change over 12 months. Some items were 
rescored to reflect meaningful changes and to improve discrimination and 
reliability. The rescored 15-item PSPRS was more interpretable and sensitive to 
disease progression over 12 months. The approach to develop the 15-item PSPRS 
provides an example of how to modify an existing clinical outcome assessment for 
use as a primary endpoint in a clinical trial of a progressive neurological 
disorder.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Panax notoginseng (Burkill) F.H.Chen(P. 
notoginseng) has been widely used as an herbal medicine for reducing swelling, 
relieving pain, promoting blood circulation and stopping bleeding, with notable 
therapeutic effects on obesity, liver diseases, colitis, Alzheimer's disease, 
chronic kidney disease and other diseases.
AIM OF THE STUDY: This review highlighted the close link and bidirectional 
effects between P. notoginseng and gut microbiota, with the ultimate aim of 
providing new insights into the potential mechanisms of pharmacological effects 
of P. notoginseng in the treatment of different diseases and PNS transformation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: By means of some reputable databases (PubMed, China 
National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Google Scholar, etc.), we screened the 
published articles related to P. notoginseng from 1998 to 2024, including 
original research, clinical trials and review on raw materials and chemical 
constituents of P. notoginseng. Then, we employed the keywords "gut microbiota", 
"intestinal microbiota", "gut biotransformation" and "intestinal" to exclude the 
articles that do not in line with our topic. Plant information was obtained from 
www.worldfloraonline.org using "Panax notoginseng (Burkill) F.H.Chen" as the 
keyword.
RESULTS: P. notoginseng elevated certain probiotics including Lactobacillus, 
Bifidobacterium and Akkermansia, while simultaneously reducing pathogenic 
bacteria such as Prevotellaceae, Enterococcus, Enterobacter and Helicobacter, to 
fight various diseases. Meanwhile, considering to the low oral bioavailability 
and degradable properties of Panax notoginseng saponin (PNS), gut microbiota 
converted it into protopanaxatriol(PPT) and protopanaxadiol(PPD) mainly through 
deglycosylation reactions to enhance the bioactivity.
CONCLUSION: Increasing evidences suggest that gut microbiota may play a vital 
role for P. notoginseng exerting on beneficial effects on the prevention and 
treatment of metabolic disorders, liver diseases, neurological diseases, chronic 
kidney diseases, vascular diseases, colitis, and other diseases, as well as for 
biotransformation of P. notoginseng.

Neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs) have been prevalent for more than a decade, 
and the number of individuals affected per year has increased exponentially. 
Among these NDDs, Alzheimer's disease, which causes extreme cognitive 
impairment, and Parkinson's disease, characterized by impairments in motor 
activity, are the most prevalent. While few treatments are available for 
clinical practice, they have minimal effects on reversing the neurodegeneration 
associated with these debilitating diseases. Lifestyle modifications and dietary 
choices are emerging and promising approaches to combat these disorders. Of the 
lifestyle changes that one could adopt, a major habit is caloric restriction. 
Caloric restriction (CR) is a lifestyle modification in which the amount of 
calories ingested is reduced to a significant amount without resulting in 
malnutrition. However, maintaining such a lifestyle is challenging. As 
alternatives, certain compounds have been recognized to mimic the effects 
produced by CR. These compounds are called caloric restriction mimetics (CRMs). 
Among these compounds, some have been designated established CRMs, namely, 
resveratrol, metformin, and rapamycin, whereas several other candidates are 
termed potential CRMs because of a lack of conclusive evidence of their effects. 
The potential CRMs discussed in this review are quercetin, chrysin, astragalin, 
apigenin, curcumin, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, and NAD+ precursors. This review 
aims to provide an overview of these CRMs' effectiveness in preventing 
neurodegenerative disorders associated with aging. Moreover, we highlight the 
clinical relevance of these compounds by discussing in detail the results of 
clinical trials on them.

Blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology have been 
investigated intensively as markers for AD-related neurodegeneration. Comorbid 
AD pathology is common in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Accordingly, we 
hypothesized that plasma biomarkers associated with AD pathology might be useful 
to predict DLB in a cohort of idiopathic/isolated REM sleep behaviour disorder 
(iRBD), an incipient synucleinopathy. The aim of this study was to determine 
whether plasma amyloid-β and pTau181 biomarkers can predict DLB. This 
longitudinal single-centre (Canada) cohort study included 158 individuals with 
polysomnography-confirmed iRBD between September 2004 and October 2022, each 
providing blood plasma samples, who were then offered prospective follow-up. 
Plasma Aβ40, Aβ42 and pTau181 levels were measured using NeuroToolKit, a 
prototype assay panel of neurodegeneration (Roche Diagnostics International 
Ltd). The primary outcome was the association between plasma biomarkers at 
baseline and eventual development of DLB. Correlations between plasma markers 
and baseline cognitive tests were assessed. A total of 142 iRBD participants 
[109 male (77%); mean ± SD, 67.6 ± 8.0 years of age] were included in the final 
analysis. On prospective follow-up (2.9 ± 2.1 years after sampling), 32 
individuals phenoconverted to a defined neurodegenerative syndrome (18 DLB, 13 
Parkinson's disease and one multiple system atrophy). The combined 
phenoconvertor group had lower baseline plasma Aβ42/40 ratio compared with 
non-phenoconvertors (mean ± SD, 0.103 ± 0.010 versus 0.114 ± 0.012, P < 0.001) 
and higher pTau181 levels (0.993 ± 0.354 versus 0.784 ± 0.266 pg/ml, P = 0.008). 
When divided by phenoconversion subtype, significant differences were seen 
selectively in DLB convertors [Aβ42/40 = 0.101 ± 0.010, difference -0.011, 95% 
confidence interval (-0.016; -0.005), P < 0.001; pTau181 = 1.144 ± 0.326 pg/ml, 
difference 0.282 pg/ml, 95% confidence interval (0.146; 0.418), P < 0.001]. 
Cross-sectional analysis showed that plasma pTau181 (but not Aβ42/40) was 
correlated with cognitive tests across various domains. Our results indicate 
that plasma Aβ42/40 ratio and pTau181 can predict conversion to DLB in iRBD.

The MAPT gene encodes Tau protein, a member of the large family of 
microtubule-associated proteins. Tau forms large insoluble aggregates that are 
toxic to neurons in several neurological disorders, and neurofibrillary Tau 
tangles represent a key pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 
other tauopathies. Lowering Tau expression levels constitutes a potential 
treatment for AD but the mechanisms that regulate Tau expression at the 
transcriptional or translational level are not well understood. Natural 
antisense transcripts (NATs) are a particular class of long non-coding RNAs 
(lncRNAs) that can regulate expression of their overlapping protein-coding genes 
at the epigenetic, transcriptional, or translational level. We and others 
identified a long non-coding RNA associated with the MAPT gene, named MAPT 
antisense 1 (MAPT-AS1). We confirmed that MAPT-AS1 is expressed in neurons in 
human post mortem brain tissue. To study the role of MAPT-AS1 on MAPT expression 
regulation, we modulated the expression of this lncRNA in human neuroblastoma 
cell lines and in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived neurons. In 
contrast to previous reports, we observed no changes on MAPT mRNA or Tau protein 
levels upon modulation of MAPT-AS1 levels in these cellular models. Our data 
suggest that MAPT-AS1 does not regulate Tau expression levels in human neurons 
in vitro. Thus, MAPT-AS1 does not represent a valuable therapeutic target to 
lower Tau expression in patients affected by tauopathies including AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) consists of two main pathologies, which are the 
deposition of amyloid plaque as well as tau protein aggregation. Evidence 
suggests that not everyone who carries the AD-causing genes displays AD-related 
symptoms; they might never acquire AD as well. These individuals are referred to 
as non-demented individuals with AD neuropathology (NDAN). Despite the presence 
of extensive AD pathology in their brain, it was found that NDAN had better 
cognitive function than was expected, suggesting that they were more resilient 
(better at coping) to AD due to differences in their brains compared to other 
demented or cognitively impaired patients. Thus, identification of the 
mechanisms underlying resilience is crucial since it represents a promising 
therapeutic strategy for AD. In this review, we will explore the molecular 
mechanisms underpinning the role of genetic and molecular resilience factors in 
improving resilience to AD. These include protective genes and proteins such as 
APOE2, BDNF, RAB10, actin network proteins, scaffolding proteins, and the basal 
forebrain cholinergic system. A thorough understanding of these resilience 
mechanisms is crucial for not just comprehending the development of AD but may 
also open new treatment possibilities for AD by enhancing the neuroprotective 
pathway and targeting the pathogenic process.

We have previously shown in small studies that full brain Transcranial 
Radiofrequency Wave Treatment (TRFT) to subjects with Alzheimer's Disease could 
stop and reverse their cognitive decline. An 8-emitter head device, the 
"MemorEM", was used in these studies to provide TRFT at 915 MHz frequency and 
power level of 1.6 W/kg Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) during daily 1-hour 
treatments. Although no deleterious side effects during up to 2.5 years of 
treatment were reported, it is important to rule out the possibility that brain 
heating will occur during TRFT in humans at a higher power level of 4.0 W/kg 
SAR, which is anticipated for future clinical testing in order to increase 
treatment intensity/efficacy to deep sub-cortical areas. To examine if brain 
heating occurs during a single 1-hour treatment at 4 W/kg SAR, a hollow human 
head phantom filled with brain-analogous gel and with an attached MemorEM head 
device was utilized. Brain temperatures were taken at 64 specific coordinates 
within the brain gel before and immediately following one-hour of TRFT. Results 
revealed none of the 64 sites having a temperature increase after TRFT of 1 °C 
or more. Indeed, 45 of the 64 sites exhibited a temperature rise of less than 
0.5 °C, with just three sites exhibiting an increase between 0.75 and 0.9 °C. 
These results demonstrate that TRFT in a human head phantom that mimics the 
electromagnetic properties of the human head, does not appreciably increase 
brain temperature (i.e., is non-thermal) at 915 MHz frequency and 4 W/kg SAR 
power level. Thus, TRFT would appear to be safe at 4 W/kg for long-term daily 
treatments.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prototypical neurodegenerative disorder, 
predominantly affecting individuals in the presenile and elderly populations, 
with an etiology that remains elusive. This investigation aimed to elucidate the 
alterations in anoikis-related genes (ARGs) in the AD brain, thereby expanding 
the repertoire of biomarkers for the disease. Using publically available gene 
expression data for the hippocampus from both healthy and AD subjects, 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. Subsequent intersection 
with a comprehensive list of 575 ARGs yielded a subset for enrichment analysis. 
Machine learning algorithms were employed to identify potential biomarker, which 
was validated in an AD animal model. Additionally, gene set enrichment analysis 
was conducted on the biomarker and its interacting genes and microRNAs were 
predicted through online databases. To assess its biological functions, the 
expression of the marker was suppressed in an in vitro model to examine cell 
viability and inflammation-related indicators. Furthermore, following treatment 
with the inhibitor, the dysregulated metabolites in the hippocampus of the model 
mice were evaluated. Forty-seven ARGs were ultimately identified, with HSP90B1 
emerging as a central marker. HSP90B1 was found to be significantly up-regulated 
in AD hippocampal samples and its inhibition conferred increased cell viability 
and reduced levels of inflammatory factors in amyloid β-protein (Aβ)-treated 
cells. A total of 24 differentially expressed metabolites were confidently 
identified between model mice and those with low HSP90B1 expression, with 
bioinformatics analysis shedding light on the molecular underpinnings of 
HSP90B1's involvement in AD. Collectively, these findings may inform novel 
insights into the pathogenesis, mechanisms, or therapeutic strategies for AD.

The etiology and pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are complex, and 
currently, no comprehensive treatment measures exist. In this study, we 
initially utilized ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography with quadrupole 
orbitrap mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QE-MS) to profile the bioactive constituents 
of SZLOL present in the bloodstream. Subsequent Y-maze experimental data 
demonstrated that SZLOL could ameliorate short-term memory deficits in APP/PS1 
mice. Furthermore, micro-positron emission tomography (Micro-PET) experiments 
revealed that SZLOL enhanced glucose metabolism in the cerebral cortex of the 
mice. To model AD in vitro, we utilized Aβ42-induced SH-SY5Y cells and assessed 
the effects of SZLOL-containing serum on cell growth and migration using 
immunofluorescence and wound-healing assays. Both in vivo and in vitro Western 
blot analyses indicated that SZLOL and SZLOL-containing serum were capable of 
activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which modulates the expression of 
inflammatory mediators. In future studies, we will validate our findings in more 
animal and cell models.

Neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's 
disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) 
are characterized by the progressive degeneration of neuronal structure and 
function, leading to severe cognitive and motor impairments. These conditions 
present significant challenges to healthcare systems, and traditional treatments 
often fail to account for genetic variability among patients, resulting in 
inconsistent therapeutic outcomes. Pharmacogenomics aims to tailor medical 
treatments based on an individual's genetic profile, thereby improving 
therapeutic efficacy and reducing adverse effects. This focused review explores 
the genetic factors influencing drug responses in neurodegenerative diseases and 
the potential of pharmacogenomics to revolutionize their treatment. Key genetic 
markers, such as the APOE ε4 allele in AD and the CYP2D6 polymorphisms in PD, 
are highlighted for their roles in modulating drug efficacy. Additionally, 
advancements in pharmacogenomic tools, including genome-wide association studies 
(GWAS), next-generation sequencing (NGS), and CRISPR-Cas9, are discussed for 
their contributions to personalized medicine. The application of 
pharmacogenomics in clinical practice and its prospects, including ethical and 
data integration challenges, are also examined.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by memory and cognitive impairments. Previous studies have shown 
neuronal death in the brains of AD patients, but the role of cuproptosis and its 
associated genes in AD neurons remains unclear.
METHODS: Intersection analysis was conducted using the AD transcriptome dataset 
GSE63060, neuron dataset GSE147528, and reported cuproptosis-related genes to 
identify the cuproptosis key gene FDX1 highly expressed in AD. Subsequently, 
cell experiments were performed by treating SH-SY5Y cells with Aβ25-35 to 
establish AD cell model. The real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain 
reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blotting (WB) assays were employed to detect the 
expression levels of FDX1, DLAT, and DLST. Cell proliferation was analyzed by 
counting Kit-8 (CCK8), mitochondrial ROS levels were analyzed using flow 
cytometry. shRNA was used to downregulate FDX1 expression, followed by 
repetition of the aforementioned experiments. Clinical experiments utilized qPCR 
to detect FDX1 mRNA levels in peripheral venous blood of patients, and analyzed 
FDX1 expression differences in different APOE genotypes of AD patients. Finally, 
a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of FDX1 was constructed based on the 
GeneMANIA database, immune infiltration analysis was conducted using R language, 
and transcription factors prediction for FDX1 was performed based on the ENCODE 
database.
RESULTS: The cuproptosis key gene FDX1 showed significantly higher expression in 
peripheral blood and neuron models of AD compared to non-AD individuals, with 
significantly higher expression in APOE ε4/ε4 genotype than other APOE genotype 
of AD patients. Knockdown of FDX1 expression reduced the lipidation levels of 
DLAT and DLST in neurons, alleviated ROS accumulation in mitochondria, improved 
cell viability, and mitigated cuproptosis. Immune infiltration analysis results 
indicated a high enrichment of peripheral blood γδ-T lymphocytes in AD, and FDX1 
was significantly associated with the infiltration of four immune cells and may 
be regulated by three transcription factors.
CONCLUSION: The cuproptosis key gene FDX1 is highly expressed in AD and may 
promote cuproptosis in AD neurons by regulating the lipidation levels of DLAT 
and DLST, thereby participating in the onset and development of AD. This 
provides a potential target for the diagnosis and treatment of AD.

A growing literature suggests that declines in sensory/perceptual systems 
predate cognitive declines in aging, and furthermore, they are highly predictive 
for developing Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's related dementias (ADRD). 
While vision, hearing, olfaction, and vestibular function have each been shown 
to be related to ADRD, their causal relations to cognitive declines, how they 
interact with each other remains to be clarified. Currently, there is 
substantial debate whether sensory/perceptual systems that fail early in disease 
progression are causal in their contributions to cognitive load and/or social 
isolation or are simply coincident declines due to aging. At the same time, 
substantial declines in any of these senses requires compensation, can strain 
other neural processes and impact activities of daily living, including social 
engagement, quality of life, and the risk of falls. In this perspective piece, 
we review literature that illustrates the different relationships between 
sensory/perceptual systems, cognitive aging and ADRD. We suggest that broadly 
administered and precise assessment of sensory/perceptual functions could 
facilitate early detection of ADRD and pave the way for intervention strategies 
that could help reduce the multifaceted risk of developing ADRD and to improve 
everyday functioning as people age.

BACKGROUND: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have garnered significant attention in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) research over the past decade, largely due to their 
potential in diagnostics and therapeutics. Although the investigation of EVs in 
AD is a relatively recent endeavor, a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of 
this rapidly growing field has yet to be conducted.
METHODS: This study aims to elucidate and synthesize the relationship between 
EVs and AD, offering critical insights to guide future research and expand 
therapeutic possibilities. Over the past 10-15 years, substantial progress has 
been made in this domain. Through bibliometric techniques, this analysis 
assesses research performance by examining scientific publications and metrics, 
including productivity indicators, impact measurements, data mining, and 
visualization tools.
RESULTS: A total of 602 publications were analyzed using various online 
platforms for bibliometric analysis. Notably, the number of publications began 
to increase rapidly in 2018, with China and the United States emerging as 
leaders in this research area. The National Institute on Aging produced the 
highest number of publications among institutions. The Journal of Molecular 
Sciences and the Journal of Biological Chemistry were the most prolific and most 
frequently cited journals, respectively. Among individual contributors, 
Dimitrios Kapogiannis was identified as the most productive author, while Edward 
J. Goetzl was the most co-cited. The most prevalent keywords included 
"neurodegenerative diseases," "exosomes," "blood biomarkers," "amyloid beta," 
"microglia," and "tau protein." Current research hotspots involve microRNA 
dysregulation, oxidative stress, carboxyl-terminal fragments, small EVs, and 
mesenchymal stem cell-derived EVs, indicating key areas for future research.
CONCLUSION: Research on microRNA dysregulation, oxidative stress, 
carboxyl-terminal fragments, small EVs, and mesenchymal stem cell-derived EVs 
represents a critical frontier in the study of Alzheimer's disease. The role of 
EV-mediated neuroinflammation in AD is a focal point of ongoing investigation 
and will likely shape future developments in the field.

In early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition can induce 
neuronal hyperactivity, thereby potentially triggering activity-dependent 
neuronal secretion of phosphorylated tau (p-tau), ensuing tau aggregation and 
spread. Therefore, cortical excitability is a candidate biomarker for early AD 
detection. Moreover, lowering neuronal excitability could potentially complement 
strategies to reduce Aβ and tau buildup. There is, however, a lack of 
understanding of the relationship between cortical excitability and p-tau 
increase in vivo. Therefore, in a sample of 658 healthy middle-aged (between the 
ages of 40 and 65) participants of the Barcelona Brain Health Initiative cohort 
study, we examined the relation of blood-based tau, phosphorylated at amino acid 
181 (p-tau181), reflecting neuronal p-tau secretion; neurofilament light chain 
(NfL), as a passively released control for p-tau181; and electroencephalography 
(EEG) markers of cortical excitability. A subsample of 47 participants also 
completed a controlled brain perturbation approach via transcranial magnetic 
stimulation (TMS) with concurrent EEG. Results show that both spontaneous (i.e., 
resting-state) and perturbation-based TMS-EEG markers, are associated with blood 
p-tau181, particularly in older individuals. The perturbation-based marker was a 
significantly more sensitive predictor of p-tau181 concentration than the 
spontaneous resting state EEG-based marker. The relationships observed are not 
present for the NfL control. These results show that relationships between 
p-tau181 and cortical excitability are present in healthy middle-aged subjects 
and that p-tau181 increases may reflect activity-dependent secretion.

It is believed that inflammation influences several physiological processes, 
including the function of the central nervous system. Moreover, the impairment 
of lipid mechanisms/pathways is associated with neurodegenerative disorders and 
onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is a chronic neurodegenerative disease 
representing the major cause of dementia worldwide. In this case, the 
overexpression of different pharmacological targets has been confirmed to 
address neuronal inflammation and AD, with acetylcholinesterase (AChE), 
monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and 5-lipoxygenase (LOX-5) 
being the most explored targets. Currently, the available treatments are only 
capable of alleviating the symptoms and not capable of delivering 
disease-modifying effects. Thus, the current research objective is to synthesize 
triazolo-thiadiazine derivatives of the deferasirox drug as multi-target 
compounds that could concurrently inhibit ChEs, MAOs, LOX-5 and COX-2. The 
synthesized derivatives were confirmed by FTIR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR and DEPT-135 
spectroscopic techniques. During in vitro investigations, compound 11 was found 
to be the most potent inhibitor of all the targeted enzymes. Briefly, this 
compound exhibited inhibitory values (IC50 ± SEM) of 0.31 ± 0.16, 0.13 ± 0.16 
and 0.94 ± 0.16 μM against AChE, MAO-B and COX-2, respectively, suggesting that 
it is a lead molecule for the synthesis of more potential multi-targeted 
inhibitors. Several compounds, such as compound 9 and 13, showed dual inhibition 
potential in comparison to standard drugs. Furthermore, molecular docking 
analysis was performed to validate the in vitro results, where the potent 
compounds showed some significant interactions with the key amino acids present 
in the active site of the targeted enzymes. Furthermore, molecular dynamics (MD) 
simulation data and physicochemical properties supported deferasirox-substituted 
triazolo-thiadiazine as a promising horizon for the discovery and development of 
new molecules to treat multifactorial diseases associated with 
neuro-inflammation, such as AD.

PURPOSE: The aim is to provide new insights for researchers studying the 
pathogenesis of diabetic cognitive dysfunction and promoting the wider use of 
natural products in their treatment.
METHOD: First, the Web of Science Core Collection was selected as the data 
source for a computerized literature search on oxidative stress and diabetic 
cognitive dysfunction (DCD). Next, Biblimetrix and VOSviewer performed 
statistical analysis focusing on publication countries, institutions, authors, 
research hotspots, and emerging directions in the field. Then, through the 
analysis of keywords and key articles, the forefront of the field is identified. 
Finally, we discussed the pathogenesis of DCD, the influence of oxidative stress 
on DCD and the antioxidant effect of natural products on DCD.
RESULT: 293 valid papers were obtained. Bibliometrics showed that oxidative 
stress, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease (AD), cognitive decline, insulin 
resistance and quercetin were the key words of the symbiotic network.
CONCLUSION: The antioxidant effects of natural products in improving DCD have 
been extensively studied in preclinical studies, providing potential for their 
treatment in DCD, but their evaluation in clinical trials is currently uncommon.

In this study, an acid-assisted extraction strategy was used to extract a novel 
polysaccharide (ACP) from Asparagus cochinchinensis, after which this 
polysaccharide was purified and subjected to extensive characterization. ACP was 
determined to have an average molecular weight of 15,580 Da in structural 
characterization studies, and it was found to primarily consist of glucose, 
galactose, L-fucose, and fructose at an 82.14:12.23:2.61:2.49 ratio. Trace 
amounts of xylose, arabinose, and rhamnose were also detected in ACP 
preparations at a 0.48:0.04:0.02 ratio. GC-MS analyses identified eight 
different sugar linkages within ACP, including Glcp-(1→, →2)-Glcp-(1→, 
→6)-Glcp-(1→, →4)-Glcp-(1→, →3, 4)-Glcp-(1→, →2,4) -Galp-(1→, →4,6)-Galp-(1→, 
and →3,4,6)-Galp-(1 → linkages present at 
23.70:1.30:3.55:50.77:6.91:1.10:11.50:1.18 molar percent ratios. One-dimensional 
NMR, two-dimensional NMR, and methylation analyses ultimately revealed that the 
polysaccharide is mainly composed of →4)-β-D-Glcp-(1 → and a small 
amount→4,6)-α-D-Galp-(1 → and →3,4)-α-D-Glcp-(1 → and so on. Branched chain is 
mainly composed of α-D-Glcp-(1 → 4)-β-D-Glcp-(1 → connected to the sugar 
residues α-D-Glcp-(1 → 4)-β-D-Glcp-(1 → O-4 position or sugar residues of 
α-D-Glcp-(1 → 4)-β-D-Glcp-(1 → O-3 position. ACP treatment in SAMP8 mice was 
associated with reductions in oxidative stress and brain pathology together with 
enhanced cognitive function. ACP treated SAMP8 mice also presented with 
increases in Bacteroidota abundance and reduced Firmicutes, Patescibacteria, 
Actinobacteriota, and Campilobacterota abundance. Thus, ACP can prevent 
Alzheimer's disease by modulating the microbe-gut-brain axis.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves neuroinflammation and amyloid 
plaque deposition, yet the role of amyloid-reactive immune response in 
neurodegeneration remains unclear. We investigate amyloid-reactive T cell levels 
in the Epidemiology of Mild Cognitive Impairment Study in Taiwan (EMCIT) and 
Taiwan Precision Medicine Initiative of Cognitive Impairment and Dementia 
(TPMIC) cohorts.
METHOD: Using diverse amyloid peptide formulations, we established a 
polyfunctionality assay for five T cell functions and compared mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) patients to control subjects in both cohorts.
RESULTS: In both cohorts, MCI individuals exhibit higher amyloid-reactive T cell 
responses than controls. In the TPMIC cohort, CD4+ and CD8+ total response 
frequencies are notably elevated in MCI (CD4: 1.3%, CD8: 1.91%) versus controls 
(CD4: 0.15%, CD8: 0.28%; both p < 0.001). Amyloid-reactive T cell response 
outperforms plasma phosphorylated tau 181 (p-tau181) in discriminating MCI (area 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve CD4+: 0.97; CD8+: 0.96; 
p-tau181: 0.72; both p < 0.001).
DISCUSSION: Amyloid-reactive T cell polyfunctional response distinguishes MCI 
from normal aging and could serve as a novel MCI biomarker.
HIGHLIGHTS: Amyloid-reactive polyfunctional T cell responses can be detected in 
the peripheral circulation.Amyloid-reactive T cell response is significantly 
enhanced in individuals with mild cognitive impairment compared to age-matched, 
cognitively unimpaired individuals.The unique discriminative accuracy of 
amyloid-reactive T cell response is significantly higher than phosphorylated 
tau181 and is not a result of overall T cell hyperreactivity.Future studies are 
needed to determine the predictive role of amyloid-reactive T cell responses in 
disease progression and if the amyloid-reactive immune response could be a 
therapeutic target for the treatment of neurodegeneration.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is well known among the elderly and has a profound 
impact on both patients and their families. Increasing research indicates that 
AD is a systemic disease, with a strong connection to cardiovascular disease. 
They share common genetic factors, such as mutations in the presenilin (PS1 and 
PS2) and the apolipoprotein E (APOE) genes. Cardiovascular conditions can lead 
to reduced cerebral blood flow and increased oxidative stress. These factors 
contribute to the accumulation of Aβ plaques and the formation of abnormal tau 
protein tangles, which are both key pathological features of AD. Additionally, 
Aβ deposits and abnormal protein responses have been observed in cardiomyocytes 
as well as in peripheral tissues. The toxic Aβ deposition intensifies damage to 
the microvascular structure associated with blood-brain barrier disruption and 
the initiation of neuroinflammation, which may accelerate the onset of 
neurocognitive deficits and cardiovascular dysfunction. Thus, we discuss the 
main mechanisms linking AD and cardiac dysfunction to enhance our understanding 
of these conditions. Ultimately, insights into the brain-heart axis may help us 
develop effective treatment strategies in the future.

OBJECTIVES: Few digital health interventions for dementia caregivers, especially 
for racial and ethnic minorities, include long-term follow-ups. This study 
assessed the feasibility of two-year follow-up of the Wellness Enhancement for 
Caregivers (WECARE) intervention for Chinese American dementia caregivers, 
examined the changes in psychosocial health and explored future strategies.
METHOD: A mixed-method study was conducted two years after the initial WECARE 
intervention trial. Participants completed an online survey and phone 
interviews. Quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed complementarily.
RESULTS: Eighteen of 24 participants completed the survey and 15 participated in 
interviews. Caregivers reported deteriorating conditions of care-recipients and 
increased caregiving burden, but their depressive symptoms and life satisfaction 
remained lower compared to baseline. Participants highlighted sustained benefits 
of WECARE, including stress management, improved communication, and a sense of 
community through group chats. They expressed a need for ongoing social and 
information support.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the feasibility of long-term evaluation for 
digital interventions like WECARE and emphasizes the need for continuous 
support. Sustained benefits underscore the potential of culturally tailored 
digital health interventions for underserved dementia caregivers. Future efforts 
should integrate ongoing resource access to enhance caregivers' long-term 
well-being.

Neuropsychiatric disorders encompass a range of conditions resulting from 
various dysfunctions within the nervous system, manifesting in diverse 
neurological impairments. These disorders, including depression, schizophrenia, 
anxiety, and Alzheimer's disease, impose significant economic and psychological 
burdens on both individuals and society overall. Recent clinical and preclinical 
studies have highlighted that dexmedetomidine (Dex), a highly selective α2 
adrenergic receptor agonist, may offer therapeutic benefits beyond its 
well-known sedative properties. Dex has demonstrated neuroprotective effects, 
including anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects, as well as contributing 
to maintaining the integrity of the blood-brain barrier. Additionally, clinical 
observations suggest that Dex could be beneficial in managing neuropsychiatric 
disorders, with fewer side effects compared to traditional antipsychotics in 
both rodent and human studies. This review presents a comprehensive overview of 
the preclinical and clinical evidence supporting the therapeutic efficacy of Dex 
in neuropsychiatric disorders. We also discuss the underlying mechanisms of its 
effect and point out future research directions to further investigate Dex's 
role in this field.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by 
gradual onset and complex pathological mechanisms. Clinically, it presents with 
progressive cognitive decline and behavioral impairments, making it one of the 
most common causes of dementia. The intricacies of its pathogenesis are not 
fully understood, and current treatment options are limited, with diagnosis 
typically occurring at intermediate to advanced stages. The development of new 
biomarkers offers a crucial avenue for the early diagnosis of AD and improving 
patient outcomes. Several biomarkers with high specificity have been identified. 
This article reviews biomarkers related to tau protein, β-amyloid, and blood 
cells to deepen our understanding of AD and emphasize the advantages and 
disadvantages of various biomarkers in order to explore further and mine new 
biomarkers for AD diagnosis.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD), a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, poses a 
significant global health challenge with complicated pathogenesis. Pathological 
characteristics of AD include increasing loss of cholinergic neurons, oxidative 
stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and amyloid beta accumulation. Due to the 
limited availability of effective therapeutic options with only symptomatic 
relief and their severe adverse effects, there is a significant need to search 
and explore new agents for the management of AD. Recently, natural products 
and/or phytoconstituents of plants have gained notable attention as potential 
sources of neuroprotective agents due to their diverse chemical constituents, 
mechanism of action, and relatively safe profiles. In view of this, Glycyrrhiza 
glabra has been recognized for its several therapeutic properties in traditional 
medicine systems for centuries. Further, neuroactive phytoconstituents of this 
plant, including glycyrrhizin, liquiritigenin, isoliquiritigenin, glabridin, and 
glycyrrhizic acid, exhibit significant pharmacological advantages along with 
potential neuroprotective effects against AD. Glycyrrhiza glabra and its 
phytoconstituents have gained significant interest due to its ability to exert a 
neuroprotective impact by influencing multiple signaling pathways, inhibiting 
AChE and BACE1 activity, reducing Aβ accumulation, plaque formation, and tau 
phosphorylation, and quenching the free radical in experimentally-induced 
AD-like brain. The present review summarizes available in vitro and in vivo 
preclinical studies that have been performed to evaluate the beneficial 
neuroprotective effect of Glycyrrhiza glabra and its phytoconstituents against 
AD-like pathology. Based on available facts, it can be concluded that 
neuroactive phytoconstituents of Glycyrrhiza glabra could be significant lead 
molecules for the drug discovery of anti-AD medicines in the future.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses a global health challenge, demanding innovative 
approaches for effective treatments. Clerodendrum infortunatum Linn. (Lamiaceae) 
is a shrub traditionally used as a medicinal plant to treat inflammation, skin 
diseases, and bronchitis. This study aims to identify the main bioactive 
metabolites in C. infortunatum using LC-QTOF-MS/MS and investigate its potential 
in protecting against cognitive decline in rats with scopolamine-induced AD 
disease. Metabolite profiling was performed on the methanol extract of the 
plant's aerial parts using LC-QTOF-MS/MS. The inhibitory activity of the 
acetylcholinesterase enzyme was measured in vitro. To evaluate the cognitive 
effects, the methanol extract was orally administered at three doses (100, 200, 
and 400 mg/kg) to scopolamine-induced AD rats, and their cognitive functions 
were assessed using the novel object recognition test. Additionally, 
acetylcholinesterase enzyme activity, as well as the levels of acetylcholine, 
dopamine, noradrenaline, glutathione, malondialdehyde, tumor necrosis factor-α, 
interleukin-1β, and amyloid-β in the rat hippocampus, were measured using ELISA, 
followed by histopathological evaluation. A total of 79 metabolites, spanning 
various chemical classes, such as organic acids, phenolic acids, 
phenylpropanoids and phenylethanoids, flavonoids, coumarins, other phenolics, 
and fatty acids and their derivatives, were identified. The results showed that 
the extract promoted enhanced cognitive functions in the novel object 
recognition test. Scopolamine administration significantly altered the 
acetylcholinesterase enzyme activity and biomarker levels in the rat's 
hippocampus. However, treatment with C. infortunatum at 200 and 400 mg/kg almost 
restored these neurotransmitter levels to normal, which was further confirmed by 
histopathological analysis. This study demonstrates the therapeutic potential of 
C. infortunatum in mitigating cognitive decline in AD, with its first metabolite 
profiling revealing a range of bioactive compounds. The extract improved 
cognitive function in scopolamine-induced AD rats, restored acetylcholinesterase 
activity, normalized neurotransmitter levels, and reduced oxidative stress and 
inflammation. These findings suggest that C. infortunatum is a promising 
candidate for the development of natural therapies targeting AD.

Ginseng has been commonly used as a traditional Chinese medicine in Asian 
countries for thousands of years. Ginsenosides are the main pharmacologically 
active ingredients isolated from ginseng and have neuroprotective effects in the 
treatment of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). To summarise and investigate the protective roles of 
ginsenosides and their underlying mechanisms in PD and AD, we used 
''Ginsenoside", ''Parkinson's disease", ''Alzheimer's disease", 
''anti-inflammatory", ''antioxidant", and ''apoptosis" as keywords to search and 
extract relevant literature information from scientific databases such as 
Elsevier, PubMed, and Google Scholar databases. In particular, we used network 
pharmacology to identify the potential targets of ginsenosides Rg1 and Rb1 in PD 
and AD. By analysing the existing research advances and network pharmacology 
results, we found that the neuroprotective effects of ginsenosides, primarily 
mediated through anti-inflammation, anti-apoptosis and anti-oxidative stress, 
etc, may be associated with the PI3K/Akt, BDNF/TrkB, MAPKs, NF-κB, Nrf2 and 
Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathways. This review systematically summarises the 
different roles and mechanisms of ginsenosides Rg1, Rb1, and rare ginsenosides 
in PD and AD and provides new strategies for the treatment of neurodegenerative 
disorders. Network pharmacology provides a new research paradigm for the 
treatment of PD and AD using Rg1 and Rb1.

Alzheimer's disease is an irreversible central neurodegenerative disease, and 
early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is beneficial for its prevention and 
early intervention treatment. In this study, we propose a novel framework, 
FusionNet-ISBOA-MK-SVM, which integrates a fusion network (FusionNet) and 
improved secretary bird optimization algorithm to optimize multikernel support 
vector machine for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. The model leverages 
multimodality data, including functional magnetic resonance imaging and genetic 
information (single-nucleotide polymorphisms). Specifically, FusionNet employs 
U-shaped hierarchical graph convolutional networks and sparse graph attention 
networks to select feature effectively. Extensive validation using the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset demonstrates the model's 
superior interpretability and classification performance. Compared to other 
state-of-the-art machine learning methods, FusionNet-ISBOA-MK-SVM achieves 
classification accuracies of 98.6%, 95.7%, 93.0%, 91.8%, 93.1%, and 95.4% for HC 
vs. AD, EMCI vs. AD, LMCI vs. AD, EMCI vs. AD, HC vs. EMCI, and HC vs. LMCI, 
respectively. Moreover, the proposed model identifies affected brain regions and 
pathogenic genes, offering deeper insights into the mechanisms and progression 
of Alzheimer's disease. These findings provide valuable scientific evidence to 
support early diagnosis and preventive strategies for Alzheimer's disease.

β-secretase (BACE1) is instrumental in amyloid-β (Aβ) production, with 
overexpression noted in Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology. The interaction 
of Aβ with the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) facilitates 
cerebral uptake of Aβ and exacerbates its neurotoxicity and neuroinflammation, 
further augmenting BACE1 expression. Given the limitations of previous BACE1 
inhibition efforts, the study explores reducing BACE1 expression to mitigate AD 
pathology. The research reveals that the anticancer agent 6-thioguanosine (6-TG) 
markedly diminishes BACE1 expression without eliciting cytotoxicity while 
enhancing microglial phagocytic activity, and ameliorate cognitive impairments 
with reducing Aβ accumulation in AD mice. Leveraging advanced deep 
learning-based tool for target identification, and corroborating with surface 
plasmon resonance assays, it is elucidated that 6-TG directly interacts with 
RAGE, modulating BACE1 expression through the JAK2-STAT1 pathway and elevating 
soluble RAGE (sRAGE) levels in the brain. The findings illuminate the 
therapeutic potential of 6-TG in ameliorating AD manifestations and advocate for 
small molecule strategies to increase brain sRAGE levels, offering a strategic 
alternative to the challenges posed by the complexity of AD.

Amyloidogenic protein aggregation is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's 
Disease (AD). As such, this critical feature of the disease has been 
instrumental in guiding research on the mechanistic basis of disease, diagnostic 
biomarkers and preventative and therapeutic treatments. Here we review 
identified molecular triggers and modulators of aggregation for two of the 
proteins associated with AD: amyloid beta and tau. We aim to provide an overview 
of how specific molecular factors can impact aggregation kinetics and aggregate 
structure to promote disease. Looking toward the future, we highlight some 
research areas of focus that would accelerate efforts to effectively target 
protein aggregation in AD.

BACKGROUND: Certain peripheral proteins are believed to be involved in the 
development of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the roles of other new protein 
biomarkers are still unclear. Current treatments aim to manage symptoms, but 
they are not effective in stopping the progression of the disease. New drug 
targets are needed to prevent Alzheimer's disease.
METHODS: We used Mendelian randomization (MR) to study drug targets for 
Alzheimer's disease. We analyzed data from the European Alzheimer's and Dementia 
Biobank consortium and replicated our findings in GWAS data from IGAP and 
FinnGen cohorts. We identified genetic instruments for plasma and cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) proteins and conducted sensitivity analyses using various methods. 
Additionally, a comparison and analysis of protein-protein interactions (PPI) 
were conducted to identify potential causal proteins. The implications of these 
findings were further explored through an examination of existing AD drugs and 
their respective targets.
RESULTS: Through MR analysis, 10 protein AD pairs were identified as 
statistically significant at the Bonferroni level (P < 6.35 × 10-5). The 
specific findings indicate that elevated levels of plasma cathepsin H (CTSH) 
(OR = 1.06, 95%CI: 1.03-1.08, p = 6.12 × 10-6), plasma signal regulatory protein 
alpha (SIRPA) (OR = 1.03, 95%CI: 1.02-1.05, p = 1.37 × 10-5), plasma TMEM106B 
(OR = 1.16, 95%CI: 1.09-1.23, p = 1.92 × 10-6), and CSF bone sialoprotein (BSP) 
(OR = 1.33, 95%CI: 1.17-1.51, p = 9.34 × 10-6), CSF Interleukin-34 (IL-34) 
(OR = 2.13, 95%CI: 1.51-3.01, p = 1.85 × 10-5), CSF immunoglobulin-like 
transcript 2 (ILT-2) (OR = 1.33, 95%CI: 1.17-1.51, p = 9.34 × 10-6) are 
associated with an increased risk of AD, while increased levels of plasma 
progranulin gene (GRN) (OR = 0.79, 95%CI: 0.74-0.84, p = 2.19 × 10-12), plasma 
triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) (OR = 0.67, 95%CI: 
0.58-0.78, p = 6.95 × 10-8), plasma sialic acid-bind immunoglobulin-like lectins 
(SIGLEC)-9 (OR = 0.67, 95%CI: 0.58-0.78, p = 6.95 × 10-8), and CSF SIGLEC7 
(OR = 0.42, 95%CI: 0.28-0.64, p = 4.30 × 10-5) are associated with a decreased 
risk of AD. Bayesian colocalization found that the above protein-related genes 
shared the same mutation as AD.
CONCLUSION: Increased levels of plasma CTSH, SIRPA, TMEM106B, CSF BSP, CSF 
IL-34, and CSF ILT-2 have been found to be correlated with an elevated risk of 
AD, whereas elevated levels of plasma GRN, TREM2, SIGLEC9, and CSF SIGLEC7 are 
associated with a decreased risk of developing AD. Further investigation through 
clinical trials is needed.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Originally formulated to mitigate high-altitude 
sickness, Xinnaoxin capsules (XNX) are composed of three traditional Chinese 
medicines (Rhodiola rosea L., Lycium barbarum L. and Hippophae rhamnoides) with 
properties of anti-hypoxia, anti-fatigue, and anti-aging. Emerging evidence now 
suggests that XNX may also offer therapeutic benefits in Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), highlighting its potential significance in the development of novel AD 
treatments.
AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aims to investigate whether XNX improves AD-related 
behavioral and cognitive deficits by enhancing antioxidant defenses, reducing 
peripheral and neuroinflammation, and protecting neurons.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The AD mouse model was established using D-galactose and 
aluminum chloride. Spatial memory and anxiety-like behaviors were assessed via 
the Morris water maze and open field tests to evaluate the therapeutic effects 
of XNX. Biochemical markers in hippocampal tissue and serum were measured using 
ELISA kits, while serum chemical composition was analyzed by LC-MS. 
Histopathological changes and amyloid-β deposition in the hippocampus were 
examined through hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining and immunofluorescence. 
Additionally, hippocampal expression of apoptotic proteins Bax and Caspase-3, 
anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, and synaptic proteins PSD-95 and Syn were assessed 
via Western blot.
RESULTS: Behavioral tests demonstrated that XNX significantly improved spatial 
learning and memory abilities, as well as reduced anxiety-like behaviors in AD 
mice. XNX also modulated inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers in 
hippocampal tissue and serum, while reducing amyloid-β deposition. Further LC-MS 
analysis of serum revealed a marked upregulation of compounds such as adenosine 
following treatment, with key metabolic pathways affected, including linoleic 
acid metabolism and phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis. HE 
staining and immunofluorescence indicated that XNX ameliorated neuronal damage 
and decreased amyloid-β accumulation. Western blot analysis confirmed that XNX 
inhibited neuronal apoptosis and preserved synaptic proteins in the hippocampus.
CONCLUSION: XNX mitigates AD-induced behavioral and cognitive deficits by 
enhancing antioxidant defenses, reducing peripheral and neuroinflammation, and 
protecting neurons. Our findings provide valuable data and a theoretical 
foundation for the potential therapeutic application of XNX in AD treatment and 
its further development.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Dihuang Drink (DHD), formulated by Liu Hejian 
during the Yuan Dynasty, is listed as one of the first ancient classical 
prescriptions by the National Medical Products Administration of China. It is 
commonly used for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This 
study further investigates the therapeutic effects and potential mechanisms of 
DHD in AD.
AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to evaluate the cognitive improvement effects 
of DHD on scopolamine (SCOP)-induced memory impairment in mice and to explore 
its anti-AD mechanisms mediated by exosomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cognitive impairment model was established in C57BL/6J 
mice via intraperitoneal injection of SCOP (1 mg/kg) for 21 consecutive days, 
followed by DHD intervention to assess its effects on learning, memory, 
hippocampal synaptic density, and the cholinergic system. SD rats were gavaged 
with DHD (22.00 g/kg) for 7 days, and plasma exosomes were extracted. These 
exosomes were injected into SCOP-treated mice (2 mg/kg, every other day for 14 
days, 7 injections) to verify the role of exosomes in improving cognitive 
function. Behavioral performance and brain ChAT and BDNF levels were measured.
RESULTS: DHD improved learning and memory in SCOP model mice, attenuated 
neuronal loss and decreases in dendritic spines induced by scopolamine, and 
modulated the expression of BDNF, SYN-1, PSD95, and M1 mAChR. DHD-derived plasma 
exosomes further enhanced learning and memory function and significantly 
increased brain ChAT activity and BDNF levels.
CONCLUSIONS: DHD may alleviate cognitive impairment in SCOP model mice, 
potentially through exosome-mediated neuroprotection.

This four-year longitudinal study investigated whether the cross-sectional and 
longitudinal associations of inflammation-related and neurodegenerative-related 
blood biomarkers with intrinsic capacity differ according to sex. The sample 
comprised 1117 older adults (<70 years, 63.8 % females) from the Multidomain 
Alzheimer's Prevention Trial (MAPT). The domains of intrinsic capacity were 
operationalized as cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination), locomotion (Short 
Physical Performance Battery), vitality (Handgrip Strength), and psychological 
well-being (Geriatric Depression Scale), each scaled from 0 (worst intrinsic 
capacity possible) to 100 (best intrinsic capacity possible). Plasma biomarkers 
included interleukin 6 (picograms per milliliter), growth differentiation 
factor-15 (picograms per milliliter), tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 
(picograms per milliliter), neurofilament light chain (picograms per 
milliliter), progranulin (nanograms per milliliter), and amyloid-beta ratio. 
Linear mixed models were analyzed to examine whether sex modified the 
cross-sectional and longitudinal association between biomarkers and intrinsic 
capacity. No significant interaction effect was observed at baseline. 
Longitudinal analyses revealed a significant interaction between sex and 
interleukin 6 (p = .005), such that higher levels of interleukin 6 tended to be 
associated with a faster decline in intrinsic capacity for males (B = -0.385; 
p = .055; 95 % CI = -0.778; 0.008) but not for females (B = 0.287; p = .041; 
95 % CI = 0.011; 0.563). The other biomarkers had no sex-dependent associations 
with intrinsic capacity. A potential sex-dependent effect of the inflammatory 
status on intrinsic capacity must be further investigated. Clinical trial 
registration with ClinicalTrials.govNCT00672685.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that primarily affects 
the elderly population and is the leading cause of dementia. Meanwhile, the 
vascular hypothesis suggests that vascular damage occurs in the early stages of 
the disease, leading to neurodegeneration and hindered waste clearance, which in 
turn triggers a series of events including the accumulation of amyloid plaques 
and Tau protein tangles. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including long noncoding RNAs 
(lncRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs), have been found to 
be involved in the regulation of AD. Furthermore, lncRNAs and circRNAs can act 
as competitive endogenous RNAs to inhibit miRNAs, and their interactions can 
form a complex regulatory network. Exosomes, which are extracellular vesicles 
(EVs), are believed to be able to transfer ncRNAs between cells, thus playing a 
regulatory role in the brain by crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Exosomes 
are part of the intercellular carrier system; therefore, utilizing exosomes to 
deliver drugs to recipient cells might not activate the immune system, making it 
a potential strategy to treat central nervous system diseases. In this review, 
we review that AD is a multifactorial neurological disease and that ncRNAs can 
regulate its multiple pathogenic mechanisms to improve our understanding of the 
etiology of AD and to simultaneously regulate multiple pathogenic mechanisms of 
AD through the binding of ncRNAs to exosomes to improve the treatment of AD.

This study investigated the relationship between eye movement parameters and 
cognitive function in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). A 
total of 80 patients with AD (mild and moderate) and 34 normal controls (NC) 
participated. Neuropsychological assessments were conducted using the 
Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment 
(MoCA), while eye movements were recorded using eye-tracking technology. 
Comparisons of neuropsychological scores and eye movement parameters were made 
across the groups, and partial correlation analysis was performed to examine 
associations between eye movement metrics and specific cognitive domains. No 
significant differences were found among the groups in pursuit and fixation 
tasks. However, in pro-saccade tasks, patients in the moderate AD group 
exhibited significantly lower accuracy and longer latency compared to those in 
the mild AD and NC groups. Similarly, in anti-saccade tasks, the moderate AD 
group showed significantly lower accuracy and error correction rates compared to 
the other groups. Partial correlation analysis revealed that overall cognitive 
function was positively associated with the accuracy of pro-saccade and 
anti-saccade tasks, as well as the error correction rate of anti-saccade tasks, 
but negatively associated with pro-saccade latency. Further, orientation was 
negatively correlated with saccade latency and positively correlated with 
saccade accuracy, while visuospatial skills were positively associated with the 
accuracy of both saccade and anti-saccade tasks. A positive correlation was also 
observed between word fluency and both saccade accuracy and error correction 
rate. These findings indicate that eye movement parameters, particularly those 
related to saccade and anti-saccade tasks, are associated with various cognitive 
domains in mild to moderate AD patients. Eye-tracking technology may provide a 
convenient and non-invasive tool for assessing cognitive function and aiding in 
the diagnosis and evaluation of AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) 
plaques and the aggregation of tau protein, resulting in intense memory loss and 
dementia. Diabetes-associated cognitive dysfunction (DACD) is a complication of 
diabetes mellitus, which is associated with decreased cognitive function and 
impaired memory. A growing body of literature emphasize the involvement of 
microglia in AD and DACD. Although AD and DACD share some common features 
related to symptomatology and pathophysiology, the characteristics and 
heterogeneity of microglia remain largely unknown in these two diseases. In this 
study, multiple bioinformatics analyses were performed to analyze the frequency, 
altered genes, cell-cell communication, and subtypes of microglia in AD and DACD 
mouse models based on two publicly single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-Seq) 
datasets. The results revealed that the frequency of microglia was increased in 
both AD and DACD mouse models when compared with control mice. After analyzing 
the differentially expressed genes of microglia from the two mouse models, only 
six common upregulated genes were found. The CellChat analysis revealed the 
complex cell-cell communication network (microglia clusters with other cell 
types) in 5XFAD vs. control mice and db/db vs. control mice. The microglia 
subtypes and their transcription factor activity profile in 5XFAD mice were 
different from that in db/db mice. In summary, this study provided some insights 
into the alterations of microglia in 5XFAD and db/db mice, which might open up 
potential avenues for the microglial-targeted therapy in AD and DACD.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of eight weeks 
of aerobic training (AT) and vitamin C supplementation (VC) on apoptotic markers 
in hippocampus tissue of AD rats treated with trimethyltin (TMT).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this experimental study, 32 Sprague- Dawley rats (mean 
age: 14-18 months and mean weight 270-320 g) were treated with (10 mg/kg) TMT 
and divided into 4 groups including: 1) ADcontrol, 2) VC, 3) AT and 4) AT+VC 
groups. In order to investigate the effects of AD induction on research 
variables, 8 healthy rats selected as healthy control group (HC). Groups 3 and 4 
trained for eight weeks, three sessions per week and each session lasted 
15-48 minutes with an intensity of 10-24 m/min. Groups 2 and 4 received 4 mg/kg 
VC orally. One-way ANOVA with Tukey's post- hoc tests were used for statistical 
analysis of data (p ≤ 0.05).
RESULTS: The gene expression levels of Caspase 3, FasL, Cyt-C and AP-1 in the 
AT, VC and AT+VC groups were significantly lower than TMT group (p ≤ 0.05); 
Caspase 3, FasL and Cyt-C levels were significantly lower in the AT+VC group 
compare to VC and ET groups (p ≤ 0.05). CytC levels in AT group were 
significantly lower than VC group (p = 0.002). Also, AP-1 levels in AT+VC group 
were significantly lower than AT group (p = 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: It seems that AT and VC, both alone and interactively, can probably 
induce their anti-apoptotic effects in the hippocampus tissue of rats with AD 
via a common signaling pathway.

Misfolding and accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) in the brains of patients with 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) lead to neuronal loss through various mechanisms, 
including the downregulation of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (EEF2) protein 
synthesis signaling. This study investigated the neuroprotective effects of 
indole and coumarin derivatives on Aβ folding and EEF2 signaling using SH-SY5Y 
cells expressing Aβ-green fluorescent protein (GFP) folding reporter. Among the 
tested compounds, two indole (NC009-1, -6) and two coumarin (LM-021, -036) 
derivatives effectively reduced Aβ misfolding and associated reactive oxygen 
species (ROS) production. Additionally, these compounds decreased 
acetylcholinesterase and caspase-3/-6 activities while promoting neurite 
outgrowth. NC009-1 increased active phosphorylation of extracellular-signal 
regulated kinase (ERK) (T202/Y204), leading to an increase in inactive 
eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (EEF2K) phosphorylation (S366). LM-021 
decreased the active phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) 
(T172) and EEF2K (S398), while LM-036 exhibited dual effects, increasing 
inactive phosphorylation and decreasing active phosphorylation of EEF2K. These 
changes in EEF2K phosphorylation led to decreased EEF2K activity and a 
subsequent reduction in inactive phosphorylation of EEF2 (T56). This cascade 
further promoted the phosphorylation of transcription factor 
cAMP-response-element binding protein (CREB) (S133) and the expression of 
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and reduced BCL-2 associated X-protein 
(BAX)/B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) ratio. Knockdown of EEF2 abolished the effects of 
NC009-1, LM-021, and LM-036 on CREB phosphorylation, BDNF expression, caspase-3 
activity, and neurite outgrowth. These findings demonstrate that NC009-1, 
LM-021, and LM-036 exert their neuroprotective effects through modulation of 
EEF2K signaling, highlighting their potentials as therapeutic candidates for AD.

OBJECTIVES: The diagnosis of early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) can cause 
emotional stress not only to the patients themselves but also to their spouses. 
This study aimed to evaluate the risk of psychiatric disorders in spouses of 
EOAD patients, using psychotropic drug initiation as a surrogate indicator.
METHODS: A cohort study was conducted using a Japanese claims database, with 
spouses of EOAD patients (exposed spouses) matched with spouses of non-EOAD 
individuals (reference spouses) up to a 1:10 ratio. Primary outcome was the 
initiation of mood disorder drugs, and secondary outcomes were the initiation of 
drugs for anxiety disorders, sleep disorders, and schizophrenia spectrum 
disorders. Four study cohorts were created according to each outcome analysis. 
Multivariable Cox regression models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios 
(aHRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for study outcomes.
RESULTS: The analysis of mood disorder drugs included 395 exposed spouses and 
3711 reference spouses. The proportion of patients excluded from the analysis 
due to prescription of mood disorder drugs during the baseline period was 4.3% 
higher among exposed spouses than reference spouses. There was no major 
difference between groups with respect to mood disorder drug initiation after 
1 year (aHR, 2.08 [95% CI, 0.61 to 7.13]). In subgroup analysis of females and 
dependents, exposed spouses showed a higher rate of initiation (females: aHR, 
6.39 [95% CI, 1.24 to 32.80]; dependents: aHR, 6.47 [95% CI, 1.25 to 33.55]). No 
substantial differences in secondary outcomes were observed in any comparison.
CONCLUSIONS: This study does not conclusively demonstrate an increase in mood 
disorder drug initiation among spouses of EOAD patients overall; however, 
initiation rates may be higher among female or dependent spouses. Our findings 
also suggest that exposed spouses experience significant psychological stress 
prior to their partners' EOAD diagnoses.

OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are 
common neurodegenerative diseases with distinct but overlapping pathogenic 
mechanisms. The clinical similarities between these diseases often result in 
high misdiagnosis rates, leading to serious consequences. Peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are easy to collect and can accurately reflect the 
immune characteristics of both DLB and AD.
METHODS: We utilized time-of-flight mass cytometry (CyTOF) with single-cell 
resolution to quantitatively analyze peripheral PBMCs, identifying 1228 immune 
characteristics. Based on the top-selected immune features, we constructed 
immunological elastic net (iEN) models.
RESULTS: These models demonstrated high diagnostic efficacy in distinguishing 
diseased samples from healthy donors as well as distinguishing AD and DLB cases. 
The selected features reveal that the primary peripheral immune characteristic 
of AD is a decrease in total T cells, while DLB is characterized by low 
expression of I-kappa-B-alpha (IKBα) in the classical monocyte subset.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that peripheral immune characteristics could 
serve as potential biomarkers, facilitating the diagnosis of neurodegenerative 
diseases.

BACKGROUND: Effective treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains an unmet 
need. Thus, identifying patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who are at 
high-risk of progressing to AD is crucial for early intervention.
METHODS: Blood-based transcriptomics analyses were performed using a 
longitudinal study cohort to compare progressive MCI (P-MCI, n = 28), stable MCI 
(S-MCI, n = 39), and AD patients (n = 49). Statistical DESeq2 analysis and 
machine learning methods were employed to identify differentially expressed 
genes (DEGs) and develop prediction models.
RESULTS: We discovered a remarkable gender-specific difference in DEGs that 
distinguish P-MCI from S-MCI. Machine learning models achieved high accuracy in 
distinguishing P-MCI from S-MCI (AUC 0.93), AD from S-MCI (AUC 0.94), and AD 
from P-MCI (AUC 0.92). An 8-gene signature was identified for distinguishing 
P-MCI from S-MCI.
CONCLUSIONS: Blood-based transcriptomic biomarker signatures show great utility 
in identifying high-risk MCI patients, with mitochondrial processes emerging as 
a crucial contributor to AD progression.
