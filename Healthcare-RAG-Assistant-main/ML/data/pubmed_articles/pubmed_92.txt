This paper for the 20th anniversary of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) provides an overview of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of 
medial temporal lobe (MTL) subregions in ADNI using a dedicated high-resolution 
T2-weighted sequence. A review of the work that supported the inclusion of this 
imaging modality into ADNI Phase 3 is followed by a brief description of the 
ADNI MTL imaging and analysis protocols and a summary of studies that have used 
these data. This review is supplemented by a new study that uses novel 
surface-based tools to characterize MTL neurodegeneration across 
biomarker-defined AD stages. This analysis reveals a pattern of spreading 
cortical thinning associated with increasing levels of tau pathology in the 
presence of elevated amyloid beta, with apparent epicenters in the 
transentorhinal region and inferior hippocampal subfields. The paper concludes 
with an outlook for high-resolution imaging of the MTL in ADNI Phase 4. 
HIGHLIGHTS: As of Phase 3, the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocol includes a high-resolution 
T2-weighted MRI scan optimized for imaging hippocampal subfields and medial 
temporal lobe (MTL) subregions. These scans are processed by the ADNI core to 
obtain automatic segmentations of MTL subregions and to derive morphologic 
measurements. More detailed granular examination of MTL neurodegeneration in 
response to disease progression is achieved by applying surface-based modeling 
techniques. Surface-based analysis of gray matter loss in MTL subregions reveals 
increasing and spatially expanding patterns of neurodegeneration with advancing 
stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD), as defined based on amyloid and tau positron 
emission tomography biomarkers in accordance with recently proposed criteria. 
These patterns closely align with post mortem literature on spread of 
pathological tau in AD, supporting the role of tau pathology in the presence of 
elevated levels of amyloid beta as the driver of neurodegeneration.

Recent discoveries of rare variants of human APOE may shed light on novel 
therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we highlight the 
newly identified protective variant [APOE3 Christchurch (APOE3ch, R136S)] as an 
example. We summarize human AD and mouse amyloidosis and tauopathy studies from 
the past 5 years that have been associated with this R136S variant. We also 
propose a potential mechanism for how this point mutation might lead to 
protection against AD pathology, from the molecular level, to cells, to mouse 
models, and potentially, to humans. Lastly, we extend our discussion of the 
recent insights gained regarding different APOE variants to putative therapeutic 
approaches in AD.

OBJECTIVES: Alzheimer's disease (AD), a brain disorder, is the leading cause of 
dementia among older adults. Taurine, an amino acid abundantly present in the 
brain, and shows potential neuroprotective properties. Therefore, we 
investigated the effects of taurine on Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) levels 
and the expression changes of miRNA-21 and miRNA-146a in the SH-SY5Y cell line.
METHODS: Taurine's impact on the SH-SY5Y cell line was evaluated via the 
2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. MMP-9 levels were measured 
using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit, while the expression of 
miRNA-21 and miRNA-146a genes was assessed through Real-Time PCR analysis.
RESULTS: The MTT assay revealed no toxic effects on SH-SY5Y cells with 
increasing concentrations of taurine. Analysis of gene expression indicated a 
rise in miRNA-21 expression and a decline in miRNA-146 expression with 
increasing taurine concentration, with the most notable change observed at 
1 mg/mL taurine (p<0.001). ELISA results demonstrated a significant increase in 
MMP-9 levels in the SH-SY5Y cell line treated with 1 mg/mL taurine compared to 
the untreated group (p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed that taurine can alter the expression of 
miRNA-146a and miRNA-21. In conclusion, taurine therapy presents promising 
therapeutic avenues for treating AD or mitigating severe symptoms. Nonetheless, 
further research is necessary to comprehensively grasp the precise mechanisms at 
play.

Background: People from South Asian communities are under-represented at all 
levels of dementia services. Consequently, there is pressure for the statutory 
sector to deliver services in partnership with Voluntary, Community, Faith and 
Social Enterprises (VCFSEs). This study set out to explore the constraints to 
effective partnership working which prevent dementia care from being delivered 
in an equitable way.Methods: Data collection consisted of two phases. First, we 
interviewed seven people with experience of partnership working and developed 
three fictional vignettes that were representative of the challenges they faced. 
We then used these vignettes to stimulate discussion in focus groups and 
interviews with 13 VCFSE and 16 statutory sector participants. Data was analysed 
using deductive thematic analysis.Findings: Three themes were developed during 
the analysis. First, White British-centric services focused on the challenges 
for statutory services in meeting the needs of South Asians, developing 
flexible, responsive services and making inclusive partnership working truly 
meaningful. Second, VCFSE participants (but not statutory service participants) 
associated a failure to deliver effective partnership working with unconscious 
bias operating within systems, leading to the devaluing of their expertise and 
to their views being ignored. Finally, participants emphasised the need to 
prioritise relationships if they were to meet the challenges of developing 
partnership working.Conclusion: We identified three constraints acting to 
prevent effective partnership working. First, the different meanings that 
statutory and VCFSE participants attach to challenges threatens their ability to 
develop a shared understanding of the needs of communities. Second, a reluctance 
to explicitly address service deficiencies can mean that stereotypes remain 
unaddressed. Finally, while both parties lacked power to change the fundamentals 
of service delivery, power and resources were also unbalanced with VCSFE 
services being more reliant on the statutory sector.

Identifying concomitant Lewy body (LB) pathology through seed amplification 
assays (SAA) might enhance the diagnostic and prognostic work-up of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) in clinical practice and trials. This study examined whether LB 
pathology exacerbates AD-related disease progression in 795 cognitively impaired 
individuals (Mild Cognitive Impairment and dementia) from the longitudinal 
multi-center observational ADNI cohort. Participants were on average 75 years of 
age (SD = 7.89), 40.8% were female, 184 (23.1%) had no biomarker evidence of 
AD/LB pathology, 39 (4.9%) had isolated LB pathology (AD-LB+), 395 (49.7%) had 
only AD pathology (AD+LB-), and 177 (22.3%) had both pathologies (AD+LB+). The 
AD+LB+ group showed worst baseline performance for most cognitive outcomes and 
compared to the AD+LB- group faster global cognitive decline and more cortical 
hypometabolism, particularly in posterior brain regions. Neuropathological 
examination (n = 61) showed high sensitivity (26/27, 96.3%) and specificity 
(27/28, 96.4%) of the SAA-test. We showed that co-existing LB-positivity 
exacerbates cognitive decline and cortical brain hypometabolism in AD. In vivo 
LB pathology detection could enhance prognostic evaluations in clinical practice 
and could have implications for clinical AD trial design.

Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are zinc-dependent deacetylases that remove acetyl 
groups from lysine residues of histones or form protein complexes with other 
proteins for transcriptional repression, changing chromatin structure tightness, 
and inhibiting gene expression. Recent in vivo and in vitro studies have amply 
demonstrated the critical role of HDACs in the cell biology of the nervous 
system during both physiological and pathological processes and have provided 
new insights into the conduct of research on neurological disease targets. In 
addition, in vitro and in vivo studies on HDAC inhibitors show promise for the 
treatment of various diseases. This review summarizes the regulatory mechanisms 
of HDAC and the important role of its downstream targets in nervous system 
diseases, and summarizes the therapeutic mechanisms and efficacy of HDAC 
inhibitors in various nervous system diseases. Additionally, the current 
pharmacological situation, problems, and developmental prospects of HDAC 
inhibitors are described. A better understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of 
HDACs in the nervous system may reveal new targets for therapeutic interventions 
in diseases and help to relieve healthcare pressure through preventive measures.

Numerous eukaryotic toxins that accumulate in geophytic plants are valuable in 
the clinic, yet their biosynthetic pathways have remained elusive. A notable 
example is the >150 Amaryllidaceae alkaloids (AmAs), including galantamine, an 
FDA-approved treatment for Alzheimer's disease. We show that while AmAs 
accumulate to high levels in many daffodil tissues, biosynthesis is localized to 
nascent, growing tissue at the leaf base. A similar trend is found in the 
production of steroidal alkaloids (e.g., cyclopamine) in corn lily. This model 
of active biosynthesis enabled the elucidation of a complete set of biosynthetic 
genes that can be used to produce AmAs. Taken together, our work sheds light on 
the developmental and enzymatic logic of diverse alkaloid biosynthesis in 
daffodils. More broadly, it suggests a paradigm for biosynthesis regulation in 
monocot geophytes, where plants are protected from herbivory through active 
charging of newly formed cells with eukaryotic toxins that persist as 
above-ground tissue develops.

Protein aggregation causes a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases. Targeting 
and removing aggregates, but not the functional protein, is a considerable 
therapeutic challenge. Here, we describe a therapeutic strategy called 
"RING-Bait," which employs an aggregating protein sequence combined with an E3 
ubiquitin ligase. RING-Bait is recruited into aggregates, whereupon clustering 
dimerizes the RING domain and activates its E3 function, resulting in the 
degradation of the aggregate complex. We exemplify this concept by demonstrating 
the specific degradation of tau aggregates while sparing soluble tau. Unlike 
immunotherapy, RING-Bait is effective against both seeded and cell-autonomous 
aggregation. RING-Bait removed tau aggregates seeded from Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) brain extracts and was also 
effective in primary neurons. We used a brain-penetrant adeno-associated virus 
(AAV) to treat P301S tau transgenic mice, reducing tau pathology and improving 
motor function. A RING-Bait strategy could be applied to other neurodegenerative 
proteinopathies by replacing the Bait sequence to match the target aggregate.

BACKGROUND: Combined art activities can improve the neural network function 
within various brain regions involved in emotions, cognition, and behavior, 
thereby preventing or reversing cognitive decline. However, few studies have 
systematically examined its effects. Furthermore, the impact of nurse-led 
art-based cognitive intervention on cognitive and psychological health is 
unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of a nurse-led staged integral art-based 
cognitive intervention in older adults on the Alzheimer's disease spectrum.
DESIGN: This was a randomized wait-list controlled trial with allocation 
concealment and blinding of outcome assessors and data analysts. All data were 
collected between April 2021 and January 2023 and analyzed from January to March 
2023.
SETTING: One memory clinic and four medical partnership communities.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 144 participants with subjective or objective memory 
decline (aged ≥60 years).
METHODS: Participants were randomized into an intervention group (n = 72) and a 
wait-list control group (n = 72), in a 1:1 ratio. The intervention group 
underwent a 16-week, 24-session nurse-led staged integral art-based cognitive 
intervention program, which was based on neurocognitive function training 
patterns. The control group underwent the program after the follow-up 
assessment. General and specific domains of cognitive function and other 
health-related outcomes were measured at baseline (T0), immediately after the 
intervention (T1), and at the 6-month follow-up (T2).
RESULTS: Of the 144 participants (mean [SD] age, 71.6 [5.8] years; 50 [34.7 %] 
males and 94 [65.3 %] females), 130 and 115 completed the questionnaires at T1 
and T2, respectively. The average attendance rate in the intervention group was 
86.0 %. At T1, the intervention group showed greater improvement than the 
control group did in general cognitive functions (MoCA, between-group mean 
difference, 1.4 [95 % CIs, 0.4 to 2.5], p = 0.009). Additionally, the 
intervention group demonstrated statistically significant improvement compared 
to the control group in language, memory, quality of life, sleep quality and 
physical activity level at T1. Statistically significant group differences 
remained in sleep quality (PSQI, between-group mean difference, -1.3 [95 % CIs, 
-2.5 to -0.1], p = 0.035) at the 6-month follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: In this randomized controlled trial of a nurse-led staged integral 
art-based cognitive intervention program, older adults on the Alzheimer's 
disease spectrum who participated in the program experienced improved cognition 
and psychological health.

Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) represent a hallmark of numerous incapacitating 
and untreatable conditions, the incidence of which is escalating swiftly, 
exemplified by Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. There is an urgent 
necessity to create pharmaceuticals that exhibit high efficacy and minimal 
toxicity in order to address these debilitating diseases. The structural 
complexity and diversity of natural products confer upon them a broad spectrum 
of biological activities, thereby significantly contributing to the history of 
drug discovery. Nevertheless, natural products present challenges in drug 
discovery, including time-consuming separation processes, low content, low 
bioavailability, and other related issues. To address these challenges, numerous 
analogs of natural products have been synthesized. This methodology enables the 
rapid synthesis of analogs of natural products with the potential to serve as 
lead compounds for drug development, thereby paving the way for the discovery of 
novel pharmaceuticals. This paper provides a summary of 127 synthetic analogues 
featuring various natural product structures, including flavonoids, alkaloids, 
coumarins, phenylpropanoids, terpenoids, polyphenols, and amides. The compounds 
are categorized based on their efficacy in treating various diseases. 
Furthermore, this article delves into the structure-activity relationship (SAR) 
of certain analogues, offering a thorough point of reference for the systematic 
development of pharmaceuticals aimed at addressing neurodegenerative conditions.

OBJECTIVE: Visual assessments of amyloid-β PET, used for Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) diagnosis and treatment evaluation, require a careful approach when 
different PET ligands are utilized. Because the gray matter (GM) and white 
matter (WM) ligand bindings vary with age, the objective was to investigate the 
agreement between visual reads of 11 C- and 18 F-PET scans.
METHODS: Cognitively unimpaired (CU) younger adults ( N  =   30; 39.5   ±   6.0 
  years), CU older adults ( N  =   30; 68.6   ±   5.9   years), and adults with 
AD ( N  =   22; 67.0   ±   8.5   years) underwent brain MRI, 11 C-Pittsburgh 
compound-B (PiB)-PET, and 18 F-flutemetamol-PET. Amyloid-β deposition was 
assessed visually by two nuclear medicine specialists on 11 C-PiB-PET and 18 
F-flutemetamol-PET, and quantitatively by PET centiloids.
RESULTS: Seventy-two 11 C-PiB-PET and 18 F-flutemetamol-PET visual reads were 
concordant. However, 1 18 F-flutemetamol-PET and 9 11 C-PiB-PET were discordant 
with quantitative values. In four additional cases, while 11 C-PiB-PET and 18 
F-flutemetamol-PET visual reads were concordant, they were discordant with 
quantitative values. Disagreements in CU younger adults were only with 11 
C-PiB-PET visual reads. The remaining disagreements were with CU older adults.
CONCLUSION: Age, GM/WM binding, amyloid-β load, and disease severity may affect 
visual assessments of PET ligands. Increase in WM binding with age causes a loss 
of contrast between GM and WM on 11 C-PiB-PET, particularly in CU younger 
adults, leading to false positivity. In CU older adults, increased WM signal may 
bleed more into cortical regions, hiding subtle cortical uptake, especially with 
18 F-flutemetamol, whereas 11 C-PiB can detect true regional positivity. 
Understanding these differences will improve patient care and treatment 
evaluation in clinic and clinical trials.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common forms of dementia and 
neurodegenerative diseases, characterized by the formation of neuritic plaques 
and neurofibrillary tangles. Many different proteins participate in this 
complicated pathogenic mechanism, and missense mutations can alter the folding 
and functions of these proteins, significantly increasing the risk of AD. 
However, many methods to identify AD-causing variants did not consider the 
effect of mutations from the perspective of a protein three-dimensional 
environment. Here, we present a machine learning-based analysis to classify the 
AD-causing mutations from their benign counterparts in 21 AD-related proteins 
leveraging both sequence- and structure-based features. Using computational 
tools to estimate the effect of mutations on protein stability, we first 
observed a bias of the pathogenic mutations with significant destabilizing 
effects on family AD-related proteins. Combining this insight, we built a 
generic predictive model, and improved the performance by tuning the sample 
weights in the training process. Our final model achieved the performance on 
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve up to 0.95 in the blind 
test and 0.70 in an independent clinical validation, outperforming all the 
state-of-the-art methods. Feature interpretation indicated that the hydrophobic 
environment and polar interaction contacts were crucial to the decision on 
pathogenic phenotypes of missense mutations. Finally, we presented a 
user-friendly web server, AlzDiscovery, for researchers to browse the predicted 
phenotypes of all possible missense mutations on these 21 AD-related proteins. 
Our study will be a valuable resource for AD screening and the development of 
personalized treatment.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Amyloid β (Aβ), a major biomarker of Alzheimer's 
disease, leads to tau accumulation, neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. 
Modelling the trajectory of Aβ accumulation in cognitively unimpaired (CU) 
individuals is crucial, as treatments targeting Aβ are anticipated. The 
evolution of Aβ levels was investigated to determine whether it could lead to 
classification into different groups by studying longitudinal Aβ changes in 
older CU individuals, and differences between the groups were compared.
METHODS: A total of 297 CU participants were included from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database, and these participants underwent 
apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotyping, neuropsychological testing, brain magnetic 
resonance imaging, and an average of 3.03 follow-up 18F-florbetapir positron 
emission tomography scans. Distinct Aβ trajectory patterns were classified using 
latent class growth analysis, and longitudinal cognitive performances across 
these patterns were assessed with a linear mixed effects model.
RESULTS: The optimal model consisted of three classes, with a high entropy value 
of 0.947. The classes were designated as follows: class 1, non-accumulation 
group (n  = 197); class 2, late accumulation group (n  = 70); and class 3, early 
accumulation group (n  = 30). The late accumulation and early accumulation 
groups had more APOE ε4 carriers than the non-accumulation group. The 
longitudinal analysis of cognitive performance revealed that the early 
accumulation group showed the steepest decline (modified Preclinical Alzheimer's 
Cognitive Composite with digit symbol substitution [mPACCdigit], p < 0.001; 
modified Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite with trails B 
[mPACCtrailsB], p < 0.001) and the late accumulation group showed a steeper 
decline (mPACCdigit, p = 0.014; mPACCtrailsB, p = 0.007) compared to the 
non-accumulation group.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed the heterogeneity of Aβ accumulation trajectories 
in CU older individuals. The prognoses for cognitive decline differ according to 
the Aβ trajectory patterns.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasingly recognized as a metabolic disorder, 
often referred to as type 3 diabetes, due to its strong association with insulin 
resistance. Chronic exposure to aluminum, a known neurotoxin, has been 
identified as a significant risk factor in the development and progression of 
AD. This study explores the potential of metformin, a common anti-diabetic drug, 
to mitigate aluminum-induced neurotoxicity in an in vitro model of AD. Our 
findings reveal that metformin significantly reduces oxidative stress markers 
such as malonaldehyde, carbonyl groups, and reactive oxygen species while 
enhancing antioxidant defenses. Metformin modulates critical signaling pathways, 
including glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3-β)/RAC-alpha serine/threonine 
protein kinase (RAC-alpha serine/threonine protein kinase (Akt1)/protein 
phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and Wnt/β-catenin, decreasing Tau protein levels and 
promoting neurogenesis. These results suggest that metformin may offer a novel 
therapeutic approach for AD, particularly in cases where aluminum exposure is a 
contributing factor.

Recent studies have reported the benefits of food-derived peptides for memory 
dysfunction. Beyond the physiological effects of peptides, their bioavailability 
to the brain still remains unclear since the blood-brain barrier (BBB) strictly 
controls the transportation of compounds to the brain. Here, updated 
transportation studies on BBB transportable peptides are introduced and 
evaluated using in vitro BBB models, in situ perfusion, and in vivo mouse 
experiments. Additionally, the mechanisms of action of brain health peptides in 
relation to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly 
Alzheimer's disease, are discussed. This discussion follows a summary of 
bioactive peptides with neuroprotective effects that can improve cognitive 
decline through various mechanisms, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, 
anti-amyloid β aggregation, and neurotransmitter regulation.

Natural compounds are important precursors for the synthesis of new drugs. The 
development of novel molecules that are useful for various diseases is the main 
goal of researchers, especially for the diagnosis and treatment of many 
diseases. Some pathologies need to be treated with radiopharmaceuticals, and, 
for this reason, radiopharmaceuticals that use the radiolabeling of natural 
derivates molecules are arousing more and more interest. Radiopharmaceuticals 
can be used for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes depending on the 
radionuclide. β+- and gamma-emitting radionuclides are used for diagnostic use 
for PET or SPECT imaging techniques, while α- and β--emitting radionuclides are 
used for in metabolic radiotherapy. Based on these assumptions, the purpose of 
this review is to highlight the studies carried out in the last ten years, to 
search for potentially useful radiopharmaceuticals for nuclear medicine that use 
molecules of natural origin as lead structures. In this context, the main 
radiolabeled compounds containing natural products as scaffolds are analyzed, in 
particular curcumin, stilbene, chalcone, and benzofuran. Studies on structural 
and chemical modifications are emphasized in order to obtain a collection of 
potential radiopharmaceuticals that exploit the biological properties of 
molecules of natural origin. The radionuclides used to label these compounds are 
68Ga, 44Sc, 18F, 64Cu, 99mTc, and 125I for diagnostic imaging.

Pomegranate is a notable source of nutrients, containing a considerable 
proportion of organic acids, polysaccharides, vitamins, fatty acids, and 
polyphenols such as flavonoids, phenolic acids, and tannins. It is also rich in 
nutritionally important minerals and chemical elements such as K, P, Na, Ca, Mg, 
and N. The presence of several bioactive compounds and metabolites in 
pomegranate has led to its incorporation into the functional food category, 
where it is used for its numerous therapeutic properties. Pomegranate's 
bioactive compounds have shown antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer 
effects. Aging is a process characterized by the chronic accumulation of 
damages, progressively compromising cells, tissues, and organs over time. 
Inflammaging is a chronic, subclinical, low-grade inflammation that occurs 
during the aging process and is linked to many age-related diseases. This review 
aims to summarize and discuss the evidence of the benefits of pomegranate 
extract and its compounds to slow the aging processes by intervening in the 
mechanisms underlying inflammaging. These studies mainly concern 
neurodegenerative and skin diseases, while studies in other fields of 
application need to be more practical. Furthermore, no human studies have 
demonstrated the anti-inflammaging effects of pomegranate. In the future, 
supplementation with pomegranate extracts, polyphenols, or urolithins could 
represent a valuable low-risk complementary therapy for patients with 
difficult-to-manage diseases, as well as a valid therapeutic alternative for the 
topical or systemic treatment of skin pathologies.

There has been a growing interest recently in exploring the role of the 
blood-brain barrier (BBB) in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a 
neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline and memory loss 
that affects millions of people worldwide. Research has shown that the BBB plays 
a crucial role in regulating the entry of therapeutics into the brain. Also, the 
potential benefits of using antioxidant molecules for drug delivery were 
highlighted in Alzheimer's treatment to enhance the therapeutic efficacy and 
reduce oxidative stress in affected patients. Antioxidant-based nanomedicine 
shows promise for treating AD by effectively crossing the BBB and targeting 
neuroinflammation, potentially slowing disease progression and improving 
cognitive function. Therefore, new drug delivery systems are being developed to 
overcome the BBB and improve the delivery of therapeutics to the brain, 
ultimately improving treatment outcomes for AD patients. In this context, the 
present review provides an in-depth analysis of recent advancements in AD 
treatment strategies, such as silica nanoparticles loaded with curcumin, 
selenium nanoparticles loaded with resveratrol, and many others, focusing on the 
critical role of the BBB and the use of antioxidant-based drug delivery systems.

Experimental models play a pivotal role in biomedical research, facilitating the 
understanding of disease mechanisms and the development of novel therapeutics. 
This is particularly true for neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's 
disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis, and motor neuron disease, which present complex challenges for 
research and therapy development. In this work, we review the recent literature 
about experimental models and motor neuron disease. We identified three main 
categories of models that are highly studied by scientists. In fact, 
experimental models for investigating these diseases encompass a variety of 
approaches, including modeling the patient's cell culture, patient-derived 
induced pluripotent stem cells, and organoids. Each model offers unique 
advantages and limitations, providing researchers with a range of tools to 
address complex biological questions. Here, we discuss the characteristics, 
applications, and recent advancements in terms of each model system, 
highlighting their contributions to advancing biomedical knowledge and 
translational research.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) still prevails and continues to increase 
indiscriminately throughout the 21st century, and is thus responsible for the 
depreciating quality of health and associated sectors. AD is a progressive 
neurodegenerative disorder marked by a significant amassment of beta-amyloid 
plaques and neurofibrillary tangles near the hippocampus, leading to the 
consequent loss of cognitive abilities. Conventionally, amyloid and tau 
hypotheses have been established as the most prominent in providing detailed 
insight into the disease pathogenesis and revealing the associative biomarkers 
intricately involved in AD progression. Nanotheranostic deliberates rational 
thought toward designing efficacious nanosystems and strategic endeavors for AD 
diagnosis and therapeutic implications. The exceeding advancements in this field 
enable the scientific community to envisage and conceptualize pharmacokinetic 
monitoring of the drug, sustained and targeted drug delivery responses, 
fabrication of anti-amyloid therapeutics, and enhanced accumulation of the 
targeted drug across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), thus giving an optimistic 
approach towards personalized and precision medicine. Current methods idealized 
on the design and bioengineering of an array of nanoparticulate systems offer 
higher affinity towards neurocapillary endothelial cells and the BBB. They have 
recently attracted intriguing attention to the early diagnostic and therapeutic 
measures taken to manage the progression of the disease. In this article, we 
tend to furnish a comprehensive outlook, the detailed mechanism of conventional 
AD pathogenesis, and new findings. We also summarize the shortcomings in 
diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic approaches undertaken to alleviate AD, 
thus providing a unique window towards nanotheranostic advancements without 
disregarding potential drawbacks, side effects, and safety concerns.

The amyloid cascade hypothesis postulates that extracellular deposits of amyloid 
β (Aβ) are the primary and initial cause leading to the full development of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) with intracellular neurofibrillary tangles; however, 
the details of this mechanism have not been fully described until now. Our 
preliminary data, coming from our day-to-day neuropathology practice, show that 
the primary location of the hyperphosphorylated tau protein is in the vicinity 
of the cell membrane of dystrophic neurites. This observation inspired us to 
formulate a hypothesis that presumes an interaction between low-density 
lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) and fibrillar aggregates of, 
particularly, Aβ42 anchored at the periphery of neuritic plaques, making 
internalization of the LRP1-Aβ42 complex infeasible and, thus, causing membrane 
dysfunction, leading to the tauopathy characterized by intracellular 
accumulation and hyperphosphorylation of the tau protein. Understanding AD as a 
membrane dysfunction tauopathy may draw attention to new treatment approaches 
not only targeting Aβ42 production but also, perhaps paradoxically, preventing 
the formation of LRP1-Aβ42.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents a significant global health challenge and 
affects approximately 50 million people worldwide. This overview of published 
reviews provides a comprehensive understanding of the intricate correlations 
between AD and body composition, focusing particularly on obesity. We used a 
systematic approach to collect and analyze relevant reviews on the topic of 
obesity and Alzheimer's disease. A comprehensive search of electronic databases, 
including PubMed, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar, was conducted. We searched 
keywords such as "Alzheimer's disease", "body composition", "lean mass", "bone 
mass", and "fat mass". We considered only reviews written within the past 5 
years and in English. Fifty-six relevant reviews were identified that shed light 
on the multiple connections between AD and body composition. The review involves 
several aspects, including the impact of lean mass, bone mass, and 
endocrinological factors related to obesity, as well as inflammation, 
neuroinflammation, and molecular/genetic factors. The findings highlight the 
complex interplay of these elements in the development of AD, underscoring the 
need for holistic approaches to reduce the risk of AD and to explore innovative 
strategies for diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.

Neurodegenerative disorders are the main cause of cognitive and physical 
disabilities, affect millions of people worldwide, and their incidence is on the 
rise. Emerging evidence pinpoints a disturbance of the communication of the 
gut-brain axis, and in particular to gut microbial dysbiosis, as one of the 
contributors to the pathogenesis of these diseases. In fact, dysbiosis has been 
associated with neuro-inflammatory processes, hyperactivation of the neuronal 
immune system, impaired cognitive functions, aging, depression, sleeping 
disorders, and anxiety. With the rapid advance in metagenomics, metabolomics, 
and big data analysis, together with a multidisciplinary approach, a new horizon 
has just emerged in the fields of translational neurodegenerative disease. In 
fact, recent studies focusing on taxonomic profiling and leaky gut in the 
pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders are not only shedding light on an 
overlooked field but are also creating opportunities for biomarker discovery and 
development of new therapeutic and adjuvant strategies to treat these disorders. 
Lactiplantibacillus plantarum (LBP) strains are emerging as promising 
psychobiotics for the treatment of these diseases. In fact, LBP strains are able 
to promote eubiosis, increase the enrichment of bacteria producing beneficial 
metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids, boost the production of 
neurotransmitters, and support the homeostasis of the gut-brain axis. In this 
review, we summarize the current knowledge on the role of the gut microbiota in 
the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders with a particular focus on the 
benefits of LBP strains in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis, autism, anxiety, and depression.

In patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in animal models, the increased 
accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) in retinal blood vessels strongly correlates with 
brain amyloid deposits and cognitive decline. The accumulation of Aβ in blood 
vessels may result from impaired transcytosis and a dysfunctional ocular 
glymphatic system in AD. High-dose fish oil (FO) supplementation has been shown 
to significantly change the expression of major facilitator superfamily 
domain-containing protein 2a (Mfsd2a), a key regulator of transcytosis, and 
Aquaporin 4 (Aqp4), an essential component of the glymphatic system in the 
retinas of WT mice. We examined the expression of Mfsd2a and Aqp4 in the retinas 
of 4-month-old 5xFAD female mice supplemented with high-dose FO for three weeks. 
There was a significant increase in Mfsd2a expression in 5xFAD retinas 
supplemented with FO compared to control 5xFAD mice. Additionally, the increase 
in Aqp4 expression observed in 4-month-old 5xFAD retinas, indicative of an 
impaired glymphatic system, was significantly decreased. Simultaneously, Aβ 
accumulation in 5xFAD retinal blood vessels was reduced following FO 
supplementation. These findings suggest that high-dose FO supplementation could 
serve as an adjunct in developing new treatments aimed at improving the 
regulation of transcytosis or the function of the glymphatic system in the AD 
retina.

Cosmic radiation experienced during space travel may increase the risk of 
cognitive impairment. While simulated galactic cosmic radiation (GCRsim) has led 
to memory deficits in wildtype (WT) mice, it has not been investigated whether 
GCRsim in combination with genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
worsens memory further in aging mice. Here, we investigated the central nervous 
system (CNS) effects of 0 Gy (sham) or 0.75 Gy five-ion GCRsim or 2 Gy gamma 
radiation (IRR) in 14-month-old female and male APPNL-F/NL-F knock-in (KI) mice 
bearing humanized ApoE3 or ApoE4 (APP;E3F and APP;E4F). As travel to a 
specialized facility was required for irradiation, both traveled sham-irradiated 
C57BL/6J WT and KI mice and non-traveled (NT) KI mice acted as controls for 
potential effects of travel. Mice underwent four behavioral tests at 20 months 
of age and were euthanized for pathological and biochemical analyses 1 month 
later. Fecal samples were collected pre- and post-irradiation at four different 
time points. GCRsim seemed to impair memory in male APP;E3F mice compared to 
their sham counterparts. Travel tended to improve cognition in male APP;E3F mice 
and lowered total Aβ in female and male APP;E3F mice compared to their 
non-traveled counterparts. Sham-irradiated male APP;E4F mice accumulated more 
fibrillar amyloid than their APP;E3F counterparts. Radiation exposure had only 
modest effects on behavior and brain changes, but travel-, sex-, and 
genotype-specific effects were seen. Irradiated mice had immediate and long-term 
differences in their gut bacterial composition that correlated to Alzheimer's 
disease phenotypes.

Cellular metabolism is crucial for various physiological processes, with 
folate-dependent one-carbon (1C) metabolism playing a pivotal role. Folate, a B 
vitamin, is a key cofactor in this pathway, supporting DNA synthesis, 
methylation processes, and antioxidant defenses. In dividing cells, folate 
facilitates nucleotide biosynthesis, ensuring genomic stability and preventing 
carcinogenesis. Additionally, in neurodevelopment, folate is essential for 
neural tube closure and central nervous system formation. Thus, dysregulation of 
folate metabolism can contribute to pathologies such as cancer, severe birth 
defects, and neurodegenerative diseases. Epidemiological evidence highlights 
folate's impact on disease risk and its potential as a therapeutic target. In 
cancer, antifolate drugs that inhibit key enzymes of folate-dependent 1C 
metabolism and strategies targeting folate receptors are current therapeutic 
options. However, folate's impact on cancer risk is complex, varying among 
cancer types and dietary contexts. In neurodegenerative conditions, including 
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, folate deficiency exacerbates cognitive 
decline through elevated homocysteine levels, contributing to neuronal damage. 
Clinical trials of folic acid supplementation show mixed outcomes, underscoring 
the complexities of its neuroprotective effects. This review integrates current 
knowledge on folate metabolism in cancer and neurodegeneration, exploring 
molecular mechanisms, clinical implications, and therapeutic strategies, which 
can provide crucial information for advancing treatments.

Integrating protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) data and summary statistics 
from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of brain image-derived phenotypes 
(IDPs) can benefit in identifying IDP-related proteins. Here, we developed a 
systematic omics-integration analytic framework by sequentially using 
proteome-wide association study (PWAS), Mendelian randomization (MR), and 
colocalization (COLOC) analyses to identify the potentially causal brain and 
plasma proteins for IDPs, followed by pleiotropy analysis, mediation analysis, 
and drug exploration analysis to investigate potential mediation pathways of 
pleiotropic proteins to neuropsychiatric disorders (NDs) as well as candidate 
drug targets. A total of 201 plasma proteins and 398 brain proteins were 
significantly associated with IDPs from PWAS analysis. Subsequent MR and COLOC 
analyses further identified 313 potentially causal IDP-related proteins, which 
were significantly enriched in neural-related phenotypes, among which 91 were 
further identified as pleiotropic proteins associated with both IDPs and NDs, 
including EGFR, TMEM106B, GPT, and HLA-B. Drug prioritization analysis showed 
that 6.33% of unique pleiotropic proteins had drug targets or interactions with 
medications for NDs. Nine potential mediation pathways were identified to 
illustrate the mediating roles of the IDPs in the causal effect of the 
pleiotropic proteins on NDs, including the indirect effect of TMEM106B on 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk via radial diffusivity (RD) of the posterior limb 
of the internal capsule (PLIC), with the mediation proportion being 11.18%, and 
the indirect effect of EGFR on AD through RD of PLIC, RD of splenium of corpus 
callosum (SCC), and fractional anisotropy (FA) of SCC, with the mediation 
proportion being 18.99%, 22.79%, and 19.91%, respectively. These findings 
provide novel insights into pathogenesis, drug targets, and neuroimaging 
biomarkers of NDs.

Cholesterol homeostasis is pivotal for cellular function. Acyl-coenzyme 
A:cholesterol acyltransferase 1 (ACAT1), also abbreviated as SOAT1, is an enzyme 
responsible for catalyzing the storage of excess cholesterol to cholesteryl 
esters. ACAT1 is an emerging target to treat diverse diseases including 
atherosclerosis, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases. F12511 is a 
high-affinity ACAT1 inhibitor. Previously, we developed a stealth liposome-based 
nanoparticle to encapsulate F12511 to enhance its delivery to the brain and 
showed its efficacy in treating a mouse model for Alzheimer's disease (AD). In 
this study, we introduce F26, a close derivative of F12511 metabolite in rats. 
F26 was encapsulated in the same DSPE-PEG2000/phosphatidylcholine (PC) 
liposome-based nanoparticle system. We employed various in vitro and in vivo 
methodologies to assess F26's efficacy and toxicity compared to F12511. The 
results demonstrate that F26 is more effective and durable than F12511 in 
inhibiting ACAT1, in both mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), and in multiple 
mouse tissues including the brain tissues, without exhibiting any overt systemic 
or neurotoxic effects. This study demonstrates the superior pharmacokinetic and 
safety profile of F26 in wild-type mice, and suggests its therapeutic potential 
against various neurodegenerative diseases including AD.

There is an urgent need for effective disease-modifying therapeutic 
interventions for Alzheimer's disease (AD)-the most prevalent cause of dementia 
with a profound socioeconomic burden. Most clinical trials targeting the 
classical hallmarks of this disease-β-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary 
tangles-failed, showed discrete clinical effects, or were accompanied by 
concerning side effects. There has been an ongoing search for novel therapeutic 
targets. Neuroinflammation, now widely recognized as a hallmark of all 
neurodegenerative diseases, has been proven to be a major contributor to AD 
pathology. Here, we summarize the role of neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis 
and progression of AD and discuss potential targets such as microglia, TREM2, 
the complement system, inflammasomes, and cytosolic DNA sensors. We also present 
an overview of ongoing studies targeting specific innate immune system 
components, highlighting the progress in this field of drug research while 
bringing attention to the delicate nature of innate immune modulations in AD.

Although the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still unknown, the 
molecular pathological phenomena is clear, mainly due to mitochondrial 
dysfunction and central nervous system inflammation caused by imbalanced 
antioxidant capacity and synaptic dysfunction, so antioxidant therapy is still 
the preferred treatment for AD. However, although antioxidant enzymes have high 
catalytic efficiency, the substrate spectrum is narrow; Antioxidants have wider 
range of effects, but their efficiency is low. Since the antioxidant defense 
system in high-grade organisms is composed of both enzymatic and non-enzymatic 
systems, therefore we synthesized a metal-organic framework (MOF) with 
superoxide dismutase activity, and depending on the interface potential effect, 
curcumin was loaded to construct a synergistic antioxidant treatment system. 
More importantly, due to the complementary surface electrostatic potential 
between MOF and curcumin, the system exhibited both good antioxidant activity 
and efficient β-amyloid plaque scavenging ability, which slowed down the 
cognitive dysfunction in the brain of AD mice.

Transcriptomic profiles are important indicators for molecular mechanisms and 
pathways involved in major depressive disorder (MDD) and its different 
phenotypes, such as immunometabolic depression. We performed whole-transcriptome 
and pathway analyses on 139 individuals from the observational, case-control, 
BIOmarkers in DEPression (BIODEP) study, 105 with MDD and 34 controls. We 
divided MDD participants based on levels of inflammation, as measured by serum 
high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP), in n = 39 'not inflamed' 
(CRP < 1 mg/L), n = 31 with 'elevated CRP' (1-3 mg/L), and n = 35 with 
'low-grade inflammation' (>3 mg/L). We performed whole-blood RNA sequencing 
using Illumina NextSeq 550 and statistical analyses with the Deseq2 package for 
R statistics (RUV-corrected) and subsequent pathway analyses with Ingenuity 
Pathway Analysis. Immunometabolic pathways were activated in individuals with 
CRP > 1 mg/L, although surprisingly the CRP 1-3 group showed stronger immune 
activation than the CRP > 3 group. The main pathways identified in the 
comparison between CRP < 1 group and controls were cell-cycle-related, which may 
be protective against immunometabolic abnormalities in this 'non-inflamed' 
depressed group. We further divided MDD participants based on exposure and 
response to antidepressants (n = 47 non-responders, n = 37 responders, and 
n = 22 unmedicated), and identified specific immunomodulatory and 
neuroprotective pathways in responders (especially vs. non-responders), which 
could be relevant to treatment response. In further subgroup analyses, we found 
that the specific transcriptional profile of responders is independent of CRP 
levels, and that the inhibition of cell-cycle-related pathways in MDD with 
CRP < 1 mg/L is present only in those who are currently depressed, and not in 
the responders. The present study demonstrates immunometabolic and 
cell-cycle-related transcriptomic pathways associated with MDD and different 
(CRP-based and treatment-based) MDD phenotypes, while shedding light on 
potential molecular mechanisms that could prevent or facilitate an individual's 
trajectory toward immunometabolic depression and/or treatment-non-responsive 
depression. The recognition and integration of these mechanisms will facilitate 
a precision-medicine approach in MDD.

The conditions supporting the generation of microglia-like cells in the central 
nervous system (CNS) after transplantation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor 
cells (HSPC) have been studied to advance the treatment of neurodegenerative 
disorders. Here, we explored the transplantation efficacy of different cell 
subsets and delivery routes with the goal of favoring the establishment of a 
stable and exclusive engraftment of HSPCs and their progeny in the CNS of female 
mice. In this setting, we show that the CNS environment drives the expansion, 
distribution and myeloid differentiation of the locally transplanted cells 
towards a microglia-like phenotype. Intra-CNS transplantation of HSPCs 
engineered to overexpress TREM2 decreased neuroinflammation, Aβ aggregation and 
improved memory in 5xFAD female mice. Our proof of concept study demonstrates 
the therapeutic potential of HSPC gene therapy for Alzheimer's disease.

Plasma biomarkers of dementia, including phosphorylated tau (p-tau217), offer 
promise as tools for diagnosis, stratification for clinical trials, monitoring 
disease progression, and assessing the success of interventions in those living 
with Alzheimer's disease. However, currently, it is unknown whether these 
dementia biomarker levels vary with the time of day, which could have 
implications for their clinical value. In two protocols, we studied 38 
participants (70.8 ± 7.6 years; mean ± SD) in a 27-h laboratory protocol with 
either two samples taken 12 h apart or 3-hourly blood sampling for 24 h in the 
presence of a sleep-wake cycle. The study population comprised people living 
with mild Alzheimer's disease (PLWA, n = 8), partners/caregivers of PLWA (n = 6) 
and cognitively intact older adults (n = 24). Single-molecule array technology 
was used to measure phosphorylated tau (p-tau217) (ALZpath), amyloid-beta 40 
(Aβ40), amyloid-beta 42 (Aβ42), glial fibrillary acidic protein, and 
neurofilament light (NfL) (Neuro 4-Plex E). Analysis with a linear mixed model 
(SAS, PROC MIXED) revealed a significant effect of time of day for p-tau217, 
Aβ40, Aβ42, and NfL, and a significant effect of participant group for p-tau217. 
For p-tau217, the lowest levels were observed in the morning upon waking and the 
highest values in the afternoon/early evening. The magnitude of the diurnal 
variation for p-tau217 was similar to the reported increase in p-tau217 over one 
year in amyloid-β-positive mild cognitively impaired people. Currently, the 
factors driving this diurnal variation are unknown and could be related to 
sleep, circadian mechanisms, activity, posture, or meals. Overall, this work 
implies that the time of day of sample collection may be relevant in the 
implementation and interpretation of plasma biomarkers in dementia research and 
care.

Atorvastatin an HMGCR inhibitor may play a role in enhancing spatial and 
long-term memory and combating anxious behavior deficits induced by Aβ1-42. 
Behavioral deficit studies, immunoblotting for the antioxidant/apoptotic protein 
expression, flow cytometry (FACS) for mitochondrial ROS, membrane potential 
(▲ψm), and histopathological alterations were performed against Aβ1-42 toxicity. 
Aβ1-42 was infused directly into the brain through i.c.v for the establishment 
of the AD model. Atorvastatin (ATOR) was administered orally and was used to 
treat AD in adult male Wistar rats aged between 200 and 250 g. We confirmed that 
ATOR administration significantly attenuates the Aβ1-42-induced cognitive 
decline targeted mitochondrial-mediated age-dependent disease progression. Nrf2 
stabilizes to interact SOD2 antioxidant enzyme, allowing transcriptional 
activity by the steep increase in ▲ψm and a reduction in ROS by activating 
mitochondrial superoxide scavenger and Nrf2-dependent pathway. These findings 
confirmed that ATOR has the potential efficacy to modulate the interference in 
cognitive decline induced by Aβ1-42.

Age is the greatest risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) as well as for 
other disorders that increase the risk of AD such as diabetes and obesity. There 
is growing interest in determining if interventions that promote metabolic 
health can prevent or delay AD. Acarbose is an anti-diabetic drug that not only 
improves glucose homeostasis, but also extends the lifespan of wild-type mice. 
Here, we test the hypothesis that acarbose will not only preserve metabolic 
health, but also slow or prevent AD pathology and cognitive deficits in 3xTg 
mice, a model of AD, fed either a Control diet or a high-fat, high-sucrose 
Western diet (WD). We find that acarbose decreases the body weight and adiposity 
of WD-fed 3xTg mice, increasing energy expenditure while also stimulating food 
consumption, and improves glycemic control. Both male and female WD-fed 3xTg 
mice have worsened cognitive deficits than Control-fed mice, and these deficits 
are ameliorated by acarbose treatment. Molecular and histological analysis of 
tau and amyloid pathology identified sex-specific effects of acarbose which are 
uncoupled from the dramatic improvements in cognition in females, suggesting 
that the benefits of acarbose on AD may be largely driven by improved metabolic 
health. In conclusion, our results suggest that acarbose may be a promising 
intervention to prevent, delay, or even treat AD, especially in individuals 
consuming a WD.

Recent advances in clinical passive immunotherapy have provided compelling 
evidence that eliminating amyloid-β (Aβ) slows cognitive decline in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). However, the modest benefits and side effects observed in clinical 
trials indicate that current immunotherapy therapy is not a panacea, 
highlighting the need for a deeper understanding of AD mechanisms and the 
significance of early intervention through optimized immunotherapy or 
immunoprevention. This review focuses on the centrality of Aβ pathology in AD 
and summarizes recent clinical progress in passive and active immunotherapies 
targeting Aβ, discussing their lessons and failures to inform future anti-Aβ 
biotherapeutics design. Various delivery strategies to optimize Aβ-targeting 
immunotherapies are outlined, highlighting their benefits and drawbacks in 
overcoming challenges such as poor stability and limited tissue accessibility of 
anti-Aβ biotherapeutics. Additionally, the perspectives and challenges of 
immunotherapy and immunoprevention targeting Aβ are concluded in the end, aiming 
to guide the development of next-generation anti-Aβ immunotherapeutic agents 
towards improved efficacy and safety.

Excessive iron accumulation in the brain plays a significant role in 
neurodegenerative processes, contributing to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). AD, a prominent neurological disorder affecting the central 
nervous system, is characterized by the accumulation of beta-amyloid (Aβ) and 
tau phosphorylation. This accumulation leads to the subsequent development of 
cognitive impairments, particularly in learning and memory functions. This study 
investigates the neuroprotective effects of emoxypine succinate in a zebrafish 
model of iron overload-induced neurodegeneration. Iron was administered to the 
zebrafish for 28 days to induce neurodegeneration. Following induction, 
Emoxypine succinate was employed as a treatment intervention for 14 days 
(concentrations of 4 mg/L, 8 mg/L, and 12 mg/L). Following the end of the 
treatment, behavioral tests (Y maze test, Novel tank test) were conducted on the 
zebrafish, and the biochemical (MDA, Catalase, SOD, GSH) and molecular 
parameters (AchE, Iron levels, IL-1β, TNF-α, CDK-5, GSK-3β, and NLRP3) of the 
zebrafish brain were also assessed. In the novel tank test, emoxypine 
succinate-treated groups exhibited significantly increased time in the upper 
zone (p < 0.001), higher distance travelled (p < 0.001), and shorter latency to 
the top (p < 0.001) compared to the negative control. Similarly, the Y-maze test 
revealed improved time in the novel arm (p < 0.001) and total distance travelled 
(p < 0.001) in treated groups versus the negative control. Assessment of 
oxidative stress parameters demonstrated significant reductions in oxidative 
stress in emoxypine succinate-treated groups. Furthermore, AChE activity 
decreased significantly (p < 0.001), and brain iron levels decreased 
substantially (p < 0.001) in treated groups, indicating positive therapeutic 
outcomes. Molecular analysis showed a significant reduction in pro-inflammatory 
markers like IL-1β, TNF-α, CDK-5, GSK-3β, and NLRP3 (p < 0.001). This 
comprehensive study highlights the potential efficacy of emoxypine succinate in 
mitigating neurodegeneration associated with iron dysregulation.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD), reported for the first time in 1906, is a common 
disease that remains incurable to this day. In the past, a family of treatments 
using Cu(II) chelators failed during clinical trials, evidencing the importance 
of pre-clinical studies. In this work, we performed electrochemical 
characterisation of TDMQ20, a new potential drug against AD, using 
electrochemistry and spectroelectrochemistry. On the basis of voltammetry, we 
determined that TDMQ20 undergoes a two-step irreversible oxidation process and a 
one-step irreversible reduction process. Both oxidation and reduction reactions 
are pH-sensitive. Bidimensional UV-Vis spectroelectrochemistry (UV-Vis-SEC) 
allowed us to confirm that oxidation of TDMQ20 can occur both on the aliphatic 
chain and on the aromatic ring. The results expand the knowledge of the TDMQ20 
redox activity in the human body which is important from the point of view of 
the toxicity of the proposed therapy.

The complex nature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) etiopathology is among the 
principal hurdles to developing effective anti-Alzheimer agents. Tau pathology 
and Amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation are hallmarks and validated therapeutic 
strategies of AD. GSK-3β is a serine/threonine kinase involved in tau 
phosphorylation. Its excessive activity also contributes to the production of Aβ 
plaques, making GSK-3β an attractive AD target. Taking this into account, In 
this article, we outline the design, synthesis, and biological validation of a 
focused library of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyrimidine based derivatives as inhibitors 
of GSK-3β, tau phosphorylation, and Aβ accumulation. The inhibitory activity of 
forty nine synthetic compounds was tested against GSK-3β and other AD-relevant 
kinases. The kinetic experiments revealed the mode of GSK-3β inhibition by the 
most potent compound 44. The in- vitro drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic 
studies were thereafter performed. The anti-aggregation activity of the most 
potent GSK-3β inhibitor was tested using AD transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans 
(C. elegans) strain CL2006 for quantification of Aβ plaques and BR5706 C. 
elegans strain for tau pathology evaluation. We then evaluated the blood-brain 
barrier permeability and got promising results. Therefore, we present compound 
44 as a potential ATP-competitive GSK-3β inhibitor with good metabolism and 
pharmacokinetic profile, anti-aggregation properties for amyloid beta protein, 
and reduction in tau-phosphorylation levels. We recommend more investigation 
into compound 44-based small molecules as possible targets for AD 
disease-modifying treatments.

Wild fruits, particularly the underutilized sloe (Prunus spinosa), are gaining 
interest as natural antioxidants, with residues from liqueur production being a 
source of bioactive compounds. This study proposes a sustainable approach for 
valorizing sloe residues, seeds and skins, by employing an innovative green 
extraction method. HPLC-ESI-QTOF and spectrophotometric techniques were used to 
explore the phenolic profile, highlighting the predominance of quercetin, 
2,3-dihydroxybenzoic and ferulic acids (9.7-57 μg·g-1). In addition, the 
presence of Cu, Zn and Ca was confirmed by atomic absorption spectroscopy. 
Simultaneously, their neuroprotective potential against Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
was studied by exploring the inhibition of beta-amyloid aggregation and 
oxidative stress cytoprotection in SH-SY5Y cell line, standing out 1 μg·g-1 and 
10 μg·g-1 extracts of sloe skin. Phenolic composition was correlated with 
bioactivities by means of multivariate analysis. These results contributed to 
highlight the potential of this bio-residue as a neuroprotective agent against 
AD in pharmaceutical and nutraceutical industries.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: More than 200 genetic variants have been associated 
with multiple sclerosis (MS) susceptibility. However, it is unclear to what 
extent genetic factors influence lifetime risk of MS. Using a population-based 
birth-year cohort, we investigate the effect of genetics on lifetime risk of MS.
METHODS: In the Project Y study, we tracked down almost all persons with MS 
(pwMS) from birth year 1966 in the Netherlands. As control participants, we 
included non-MS participants from the Project Y cohort (born 1965-1967 in the 
Netherlands) and non-MS participants from the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort born 
between 1963 and 1969. Genetic variants associated with MS were determined in 
pwMS and control participants using genotyping or imputation methods. Polygenic 
risk scores (PRSs) based on variants and weights from the largest genetic study 
in MS were calculated for each participant and assigned into deciles based on 
the PRS distribution in the control participants. We examined the lifetime risk 
for each decile and the association between PRS and MS disease variables, 
including age at onset and time to secondary progression.
RESULTS: MS-PRS was calculated for 285 pwMS (mean age 53.0 ± 0.9 years, 72.3% 
female) and 267 control participants (mean age 51.8 ± 3.2 years, 58.1% female). 
Based on the lifetime risk estimation, we observed that 1:2,739 of the women 
with the lowest 30% genetic risk developed MS, whereas 1:92 of the women with 
the top 10% highest risk developed MS. For men, only 1:7,900 developed MS in the 
lowest 30% genetic risk group, compared with 1:293 men with the top 10% genetic 
risk. The PRS was not significantly associated with age at onset and time to 
secondary progression in both sexes.
DISCUSSION: Our results show that the lifetime risk of MS is strongly influenced 
by genetic factors. Our findings have the potential to support diagnostic 
certainty in individuals with suspected MS: a high PRS could strengthen a 
diagnosis, but especially a PRS from the lowest tail of the PRS distribution 
should be considered a red flag and could prevent misdiagnosing conditions that 
mimic MS.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: It remains unknown whether the associations between 
protective lifestyles and sporadic dementia risk reported in observational 
studies also affect age at symptom onset (AAO) in autosomal dominant Alzheimer 
disease (ADAD) with predominant genetic influences. We investigated the 
associations between resilience-related life experiences and interindividual AAO 
variability in ADAD.
METHODS: We performed a longitudinal and confirmatory analysis of the Dominantly 
Inherited Alzheimer Network prospective observational cohort (January 2009-June 
2018, follow-up duration 2.13 ± 2.22 years), involving clinical, CSF, and 
lifestyle/behavioral assessments. We performed a 2-pronged comprehensive 
resilience assessment in each cohort. Cohort 1, incorporating the general 
resilience definition (cognitive maintenance [Clinical Dementia Rating = 0] 
despite high pathology), included carriers during the periods of significant 
CSFp-tau181 variability and grouped into resilience/resistance outcome bins 
according to the dichotomous pathologic and cognitive statuses, subcategorized 
by the estimated years from expected symptom onset (EYO). Cohort 2, focused on 
ADAD-specific genetically determined time frame characterizing the onset 
predictability, included asymptomatic participants with available preclinical 
lifestyle data and AAO outcomes and grouped into delayed or earlier AAO relative 
to the parental AAO. Associations of cognitive, CSFp-tau181, and 
lifestyle/behavioral predictors with binary outcomes were investigated using 
logistic regression.
RESULTS: Of 320 carriers (age 38.19 ± 10.94 years, female 56.25%), cohort 1 
included 218 participants (39.00 ± 9.37 years, 57.34%) and cohort 2 included 28 
participants (43.34 ± 7.40 years, 71.43%). In cohort 1, 218 carriers after -20 
EYO, when the interindividual variability (SD) of CSFp-tau181 first became more 
than twice greater in carriers than in noncarriers, were grouped into low-risk 
control (asymptomatic, low pathology, n = 103), high-resilience (asymptomatic 
despite high pathology, n = 60), low-resilience (symptomatic despite low 
pathology, n = 15), and susceptible control (symptomatic, high pathology, n = 
40) groups. Multivariable predictors of high resilience, controlling for age and 
depression, included higher conscientiousness (odds ratio 1.051 [95% CI 
1.016-1.086], p = 0.004), openness to experience (1.068 [1.005-1.135], p = 0.03) 
(vs. susceptible controls), and agreeableness (1.082 [1.015-1.153], p = 0.02) 
(vs. low resilience). From 1 to 3 years before parental AAO (cohort 2), the 
multivariable predictor of delayed AAO, controlling for CSFp-tau181, was higher 
conscientiousness (0.916 [0.845-0.994], p = 0.036).
DISCUSSION: Among the cognitively and socially integrated life experiences 
associated with resilience, measures of conscientiousness were useful indicators 
for evaluating resilience and predicting future dementia onset in late 
preclinical ADAD.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Idiopathic/isolated REM sleep behavior disorder 
(iRBD) has been strongly linked to neurodegenerative synucleinopathies such as 
Parkinson disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy. 
However, there have been increasing reports of RBD as a presenting feature of 
serious and treatable autoimmune syndromes, particularly IGLON5. This study's 
objective was to investigate the frequency of autoantibodies in a large cohort 
of participants with iRBD.
METHODS: Participants were enrolled in the North American Prodromal 
Synucleinopathy cohort with polysomnography-confirmed iRBD, free of parkinsonism 
and dementia. Plasma samples were systematically screened for the autoantibodies 
IGLON5, DPPX, LGI1, and CASPR2 using plasma IgG cell-based assay. Positive or 
equivocal results were confirmed by repeat testing, plus tissue-based indirect 
immunofluorescence assay for IGLON5.
RESULTS: Of 339 samples analyzed, 3 participants (0.9%) had confirmed positive 
IGLON5 autoantibodies in the cell-based assay, which were confirmed by the 
tissue-based assay. An additional participant was positive for CASPR2 with low 
titer by cell-based assay only (of lower clinical certainty). These cases 
exhibited a variety of symptoms including dream enactment, cognitive decline, 
autonomic dysfunction, and motor symptoms. In 1 IGLON5 case and the CASPR2 case, 
evolution was suggestive of typical synucleinopathy, suggesting the possibility 
that findings were incidental. However, 2 participants with IGLON5 died before 
diagnosis was clinically suspected, with a final clinical picture highly 
suggestive of autoimmune disease.
DISCUSSION: Our finding that nearly 1% of a large iRBD cohort may have a serious 
but potentially treatable autoantibody syndrome has important clinical 
implications. In particular, it raises the question of whether autoantibody 
testing for IGLON-5-IgG should be widely implemented for participants with iRBD, 
considering the difficulty in diagnosis of autoimmune diseases, their response 
to treatment, and the potential for rapid disease progression. However, any 
routine testing protocol will also have to consider costs and potential adverse 
effects of false-positive findings.

Anti-amyloid drugs for early Alzheimer's disease, including lecanemab, are 
associated with adverse events (AEs), such as amyloid-related imaging 
abnormalities (ARIA)-edema/effusion (E), ARIA-hemorrhage, and infusion-related 
reactions, which can indicate allocated arms in clinical trials. Herein, we 
evaluated the predictive value of AEs using a meta-analysis to estimate their 
incidence and simulated positive predictive value (PPV). The PPV for ARIA-E was 
high (0.915), but that for ARIA hemorrhage was low (0.630). Infusion-related 
reactions had a high PPV of 0.910, but with a wide confidence interval. Our 
results suggest the need to ameliorate the unblinding effects of AEs, 
particularly ARIA-E in trials.

BACKGROUND: Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) could improve 
cognition in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the effects of 
tACS on brain activity remain unclear.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose is to investigate the change in regional neuronal 
activity after tACS in AD patients employing resting-state functional magnetic 
resonance imaging (rs-fMRI).
METHODS: A total of 46 patients with mild AD were enrolled. Each patient 
received 30 one-hour sessions of real or sham tACS for three weeks (clinical 
trial: NCT03920826). The fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations 
(fALFF) and the regional homogeneity (ReHo) measured by rs-fMRI were calculated 
to evaluate the regional brain activity.
RESULTS: Compared to baseline, AD patients in the real group exhibited increased 
fALFF in the left middle frontal gyrus-orbital part and right inferior frontal 
gyrus-orbital part, as well as increased ReHo in the left precentral gyrus and 
right middle frontal gyrus at the end of intervention. At the 3-month follow-up, 
fALFF increased in the left superior parietal lobule and right inferior temporal 
gyrus, as well as ReHo, in the left middle frontal gyrus and right superior 
medial frontal gyrus. A higher fALFF in the right lingual gyrus and ReHo in the 
right parahippocampal gyrus were observed in the response group than in the 
nonresponse group.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings demonstrated the beneficial effects of tACS on the 
neuronal activity of the prefrontal cortex and even more extensive regions and 
provided a neuroimaging biomarker of treatment response in AD patients.

BACKGROUND: Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative 
tauopathy more frequently found in deceased former football players. CTE has 
heterogeneous clinical presentations with multifactorial causes. Previous 
literature has shown substance use (alcohol/drug) can contribute to Alzheimer's 
disease and related tauopathies pathologically and clinically.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between substance use and clinical and 
neuropathological endpoints of CTE.
METHODS: Our sample included 429 deceased male football players. CTE was 
neuropathologically diagnosed. Informant interviews assessed features of 
substance use and history of treatment for substance use to define indicators: 
history of substance use treatment (yes vs no, primary variable), alcohol 
severity, and drug severity. Outcomes included scales that were completed by 
informants to assess cognition (Cognitive Difficulties Scale, BRIEF-A 
Metacognition Index), mood (Geriatric Depression Scale-15), behavioral 
regulation (BRIEF-A Behavioral Regulation Index, Barratt Impulsiveness 
Scale-11), functional ability (Functional Activities Questionnaire), as well as 
CTE status and cumulative p-tau burden. Regression models tested associations 
between substance use indicators and outcomes.
RESULTS: Of the 429 football players (mean age = 62.07), 313 (73%) had autopsy 
confirmed CTE and 100 (23%) had substance use treatment history. Substance use 
treatment and alcohol/drug severity were associated with measures of behavioral 
regulation (FDR-p-values<0.05, ΔR2 = 0.04-0.18) and depression 
(FDR-p-values<0.05, ΔR2 = 0.02-0.05). Substance use indicators had minimal 
associations with cognitive scales, whereas p-tau burden was associated with all 
cognitive scales (p-values <0.05). Substance use treatment had no associations 
with neuropathological endpoints (FDR-p-values>0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Among deceased football players, substance use was common and 
associated with clinical symptoms.

BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence suggests the potential of 
hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA, statins) as a therapeutic option for 
dementia.
OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study is to assess the current state of 
research on statins use in dementia, with a focus on identifying pivotal 
questions within the field.
METHODS: A systemic search for publications on statin use in dementia between 
2007 and 2023 was conducted, utilizing the Web of Science Core Collection. The 
scientific output was analyzed from various perspectives through VOSviewer, 
CiteSpace, and the bibliometrics website (https://bibliometric.com/).
RESULTS: 560 articles authored by 2,977 individuals and 999 institutions across 
58 countries were included, which were published in 295 periodicals and cited 
21,176 references from 16,424 authors. The annual publication output remained 
steady, while the number of citations increased consistently. The U.S. and Mayo 
Clinic emerged as the most significant country and institution, respectively. B. 
McGuinness and D.L. Sparks were the most eminent authors. Journal of Alzheimer's 
Disease was the most influential journal. Three sets of keywords and the top 10 
references were identified, suggesting pivotal questions within the field.
CONCLUSIONS: While statins show promising potential as a treatment option for 
dementia, their use remains uncertain due to the reported short-term cognitive 
impairment events and questionable long-term protective effects against 
dementia. The pivotal question is to ascertain the association between statins 
and cognition. The mechanisms underlying the effects of statins on cognition are 
multifaceted. This study provides insights into the current status within the 
field of statin use in dementia.

BACKGROUND: Vascular cognitive impairment is frequent, in mild (mVCI) or severe 
forms (vascular dementia).
OBJECTIVE: To do a randomized controlled-trial to evaluate the impact of 
physical activity on cognition (primary outcome), neurocognitive measures, 
quality of life, functional status, and physical function (secondary outcomes), 
in patients with mVCI.
METHODS: A hundred and four patients with mVCI (mean age 71.2 years; 53 women) 
were randomized for a six-month intervention of moderate physical activity 
(60-minute sessions, 3 times/week) (n = 53) or best-practice "usual care" 
(n = 51). Comprehensive evaluations of primary and secondary outcomes included 
an objective measure of physical activity through accelerometry at baseline and 
after intervention.
RESULTS: Mean session attendance was 58%. Adverse events were negligible. After 
6 months, no significant primary outcome change was observed, either in the 
intervention or 'usual care' group. The intervention group improved 
significantly in some secondary outcomes in physical function - aerobic capacity 
(U = 403; p = 0.000) and agility (U = 453; p = 0.005) after 6 months. Regardless 
of randomization arm, a post-hoc analysis based on fulfilling at least 21.5 
minutes/day of moderate or 10.7 minutes/day of vigorous physical activity (World 
Health Organization-WHO standards) revealed improvements. These were not only in 
motor capacity but also on the global measure of cognition, executive functions 
and memory.
CONCLUSIONS: Physical activity was safe and beneficial regarding domains of 
physical function. No significant cognitive decline was registered over 
6-months, regardless of intervention allocation. Larger samples, longer 
follow-ups and focus on intervention adherence are needed to fully analyze the 
impact of WHO recommendations for physical activity in mVCI populations.

A Drug Repositioning Approach Reveals Ergotamine May Be a Potential Drug for the 
Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is the 
most common form of dementia in the elderly. The drugs currently used to treat 
AD only have limited effects and are not able to cure the disease. Drug 
repositioning has increasingly become a promising approach to find potential 
drugs for diseases like AD.
OBJECTIVE: To screen potential drug candidates for AD based on the relationship 
between risk genes of AD and drugs.
METHODS: We collected the risk genes of AD and retrieved the information of 
known drugs from DrugBank. Then, the AD-related genes and the targets of each 
drug were mapped to the human protein-protein interaction network (PPIN) to 
represent AD and the drugs on the network. The network distances between each 
drug and AD were calculated to screen the drugs proximal to AD-related genes on 
PPIN, and the screened drug candidates were further analyzed by molecular 
docking and molecular dynamics simulations.
RESULTS: We compiled a list of 714 genes associated with AD. From 5,833 drugs 
used for human diseases, we identified 1,044 drugs that could be potentially 
used to treat AD. Then, amyloid-β (Aβ) protein, the key molecule involved in the 
pathogenesis of AD was selected as the target to further screen drugs that may 
inhibit Aβ aggregation by molecular docking. We found that ergotamine and 
RAF-265 could bind stably with Aβ. In further analysis by molecular dynamics 
simulations, both drugs exhibited reasonable stability.
CONCLUSIONS: Our work indicated that ergotamine and RAF-265 may be potential 
candidates for treating AD.

BACKGROUND: Integrating scores from multiple cognitive tests into a single 
cognitive composite has been shown to improve sensitivity to detect AD-related 
cognitive impairment. However, existing composites have little sensitivity to 
amyloid-β status (Aβ +/-) in preclinical AD.
OBJECTIVE: Evaluate whether a data-driven approach for deriving cognitive 
composites can improve the sensitivity to detect Aβ status among cognitively 
unimpaired (CU) individuals compared to existing cognitive composites.
METHODS: Based on the data from the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in the Asymptomatic 
Alzheimer's Disease (A4) study, a novel composite, the Data-driven Preclinical 
Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite (D-PACC), was developed based on test scores and 
response durations selected using a machine learning algorithm from the Cogstate 
Brief Battery (CBB). The D-PACC was then compared with conventional composites 
in the follow-up A4 visits and in individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).
RESULT: The D-PACC showed a comparable or significantly higher ability to 
discriminate Aβ status [median Cohen's d = 0.172] than existing composites at 
the A4 baseline visit, with similar results at the second visit. The D-PACC 
demonstrated the most consistent sensitivity to Aβ status in both A4 and ADNI 
datasets.
CONCLUSIONS: The D-PACC showed similar or improved sensitivity when screening 
for Aβ+ in CU populations compared to existing composites but with higher 
consistency across studies.

Mitochondria, essential organelles responsible for cellular energy production, 
emerge as a key factor in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. This 
review explores advancements in mitochondrial biology studies that highlight the 
pivotal connection between mitochondrial dysfunctions and neurological 
conditions such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, ischemic stroke, and 
vascular dementia. Mitochondrial DNA mutations, impaired dynamics, and 
disruptions in the ETC contribute to compromised energy production and 
heightened oxidative stress. These factors, in turn, lead to neuronal damage and 
cell death. Recent research has unveiled potential therapeutic strategies 
targeting mitochondrial dysfunction, including mitochondria targeted therapies 
and antioxidants. Furthermore, the identification of reliable biomarkers for 
assessing mitochondrial dysfunction opens new avenues for early diagnosis and 
monitoring of disease progression. By delving into these advancements, this 
review underscores the significance of understanding mitochondrial biology in 
unraveling the mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative disorders. It lays the 
groundwork for developing targeted treatments to combat these devastating 
neurological conditions.

The blood-brain barrier (BBB) plays a vital role in safeguarding the central 
nervous system by selectively controlling the movement of substances between the 
bloodstream and the brain, presenting a substantial obstacle for the 
administration of therapeutic agents to the brain. Recent breakthroughs in 
nanoparticle-based delivery systems, particularly metal-organic frameworks 
(MOFs), provide promising solutions for addressing the BBB. MOFs have become 
valuable tools in delivering medications to the brain with their ability to 
efficiently load drugs, release them over time, and modify their surface 
properties. This review focuses on the recent advancements in molecular-based 
approaches for treating brain disorders, such as glioblastoma multiforme, 
stroke, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. This paper highlights the 
significant impact of MOFs in overcoming the shortcomings of conventional brain 
drug delivery techniques and provides valuable insights for future research in 
the field of neurotherapeutics.

Cognitive decline is a frequent complaint in healthy controls and neurological 
patients, regardless of the underlying pathology. Whilst cognitive impairment 
can be easily diagnosed in the more advanced stages of neurodegenerative 
diseases, early detection can be challenging. This is mainly the consequence of 
the incomplete understanding of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. In 
addition, currently available neurological treatments do not specifically target 
cognitive decline, since other motor and non-motor symptoms, such as 
bradykinesia, tremor, autonomic disturbances and depression, are of greater 
relevance from a therapeutic perspective. In this context, prospective studies 
must address a number of issues, including the risk factors associated with 
cognitive deficits in neurodegenerative diseases. The present review aims to 
offer a novel perspective on the association between Epstein-Barr virus 
infection and cognitive decline found in patients with neurodegenerative 
disorders. Specifically, relevant epidemiological studies and clinical trials 
explaining this connection were reviewed, focusing on the most frequent 
neurodegenerative disorders. They are namely Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's 
disease and multiple sclerosis. Despite their limitations, possible underlying 
pathophysiological mechanisms that explain the impact of Epstein-Barr virus 
infection on cognitive decline are expected to offer novel study directions on 
this clinically relevant topic.

Depressive disorders are leading contributors to the global mental 
health-related burden, and they represent a challenge for real-world clinicians, 
due to the low rates of remission despite the high availability of treatments. 
Often, depression shows in the context of multiple chronic comorbidities, thus 
requiring precise and accurate management of pharmacological treatments to avoid 
interactions and side effects. These criticalities call for the need for new 
strategies of treatment, which may include new insights into the pharmacological 
properties of currently available antidepressant drugs, to enhance their 
efficacy in the different contexts in which depression may arise. Trazodone is 
the prototype serotonin antagonist/reuptake inhibitor antidepressant (SARI). Due 
to the malleability granted by its multiple formulations, trazodone is 
frequently used to treat depression, both as an add-on to other antidepressants 
and as a monotherapy, with satisfying results. Moreover, its tolerability makes 
it one of the most prescribed antidepressants in patients with poly-treated 
comorbid medical illnesses, especially in the elderly. Herein, a case series is 
presented regarding the use of trazodone in patients with complex comorbid 
diagnoses or distressing side effects. Each of the three cases has been 
discussed in three specific Round Tables, involving expert clinicians in the 
fields of Psychiatry, Neurology, General Practice, and Geriatrics using the 
Nominal Group Technique. The ideas collected have been used to integrate the 
cases and the discussion with the intent of facilitating accessibility to the 
widest audience of physicians and clinical workers in different clinical 
practice contexts. The final aim of this paper is to promote an increasingly 
personalized use of trazodone in real-world patients with depression.

BACKGROUND: The established association between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 
compromised neural regeneration is well-documented. In addition to the 
mitigation of apoptosis in neural stem cells (NSCs), the induction of 
neurogenesis has been proposed as a promising therapeutic strategy for AD. Our 
previous research has demonstrated the effective inhibition of NSC injury 
induced by microglial activation through the repression of oxidative stress and 
mitochondrial dysfunction by Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3). Nonetheless, the precise role of 
SIRT3 in neurogenesis remains incompletely understood.
METHODS: In vivo, SIRT3 overexpression adenovirus was firstly injected by brain 
stereotaxic localization to affect the hippocampal SIRT3 expression in APP/PS1 
mice, and then behavioral experiments were performed to investigate the 
cognitive improvement of SIRT3 in APP/PS1 mice, as well as neurogenic changes in 
hippocampal region by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. In vitro, 
under the transwell co-culture condition of microglia and neural stem cells, the 
mechanism of SIRT3 improving neurogenesis of neural stem cells through 
DVL/GSK3/ISL1 axis was investigated by immunoblotting, immunofluorescence and 
other experimental methods.
RESULTS: Our findings indicate that the overexpression of SIRT3 in APP/PS1 mice 
led to enhanced cognitive function and increased neurogenesis. Additionally, 
SIRT3 was observed to promote the differentiation of NSCs into neurons during 
retinoic acid (RA)-induced NSC differentiation in vitro, suggesting a potential 
role in neurogenesis. Furthermore, we observed the activation of the 
Wnt/ß-catenin signaling pathway during this process, with Glycogen Synthase 
Kinase-3a (GSK3a) primarily governing NSC proliferation and GSK3ß predominantly 
regulating NSC differentiation. Moreover, the outcomes of our study demonstrate 
that SIRT3 exerts a protective effect against microglia-induced apoptosis in 
neural stem cells through its interaction with DVLs.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that SIRT3 overexpressing APP/PS1 mice have 
improved cognition and neurogenesis, as well as improved neurogenesis of NSC in 
microglia and NSC transwell co-culture conditions through the DVL/GSK3/ISL1 
axis.

BACKGROUND: The mechanistic effects of gamma transcranial alternating current 
stimulation (tACS) on hippocampal gamma oscillation activity in Alzheimer's 
Disease (AD) remains unclear. This study aimed to clarify beneficial effects of 
gamma tACS on cognitive functioning in AD and to elucidate effects on 
hippocampal gamma oscillation activity.
METHODS: This is a double-blind, randomized controlled single-center trial. 
Participants with mild AD were randomized to tACS group or sham group, and 
underwent 30 one-hour sessions of either 40 Hz tACS or sham stimulation over 
consecutive 15 days. Cognitive functioning, structural magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI), and simultaneous electroencephalography-functional MRI (EEG-fMRI) 
were evaluated at baseline, the end of the intervention and at 3-month follow-up 
from the randomization.
RESULTS: A total of 46 patients were enrolled (23 in the tACS group, 23 in the 
sham group). There were no group differences in the change of the primary 
outcome, 11-item cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale 
(ADAS-Cog) score after intervention (group*time, p = 0.449). For secondary 
outcomes, compared to the control group, the intervention group showed 
significant improvement in MMSE (group*time, p = 0.041) and MoCA scores 
(non-parametric test, p = 0.025), which were not sustained at 3-month follow-up. 
We found an enhancement of theta-gamma coupling in the hippocampus, which was 
positively correlated with improvements of MMSE score and delayed recall. 
Additionally, fMRI revealed increase of the local neural activity in the 
hippocampus.
CONCLUSION: Effects on the enhancement of theta-gamma coupling and neural 
activity within the hippocampus suggest mechanistic models for potential 
therapeutic mechanisms of tACS.

BACKGROUND: There is increasing evidence that inflammation plays a key role in 
the pathophysiology of periodontitis (PT) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the 
roles of inflammation in linking PT and AD are not clear. Our aim is to analyze 
the potential molecular mechanisms between these two diseases using 
bioinformatics and systems biology approaches.
METHODS: To elucidate the link between PT and AD, we selected shared genes (SGs) 
with gene-disease-association scores of ≥ 0.1 from the Disease Gene Network 
(DisGeNET) database, followed by extracting the hub genes. Based on these genes, 
we constructed gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis, pathway enrichment 
analysis, protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, transcription factors 
(TFs)-gene networks, microRNAs (miRNAs)-gene regulatory networks, and 
gene-disease association analyses. Finally, the Drug Signatures database 
(DSigDB) was utilized to predict candidate molecular drugs related to hub genes.
RESULTS: A total of 21 common SGs between PT and AD were obtained. Cell cytokine 
activity, inflammatory response, and extracellular membrane were the most 
important enriched items in GO analysis. Interleukin-10 Signaling, LTF Danger 
Signal Response Pathway, and RAGE Pathway were identified as important shared 
pathways. IL6, IL10, IL1B, TNF, IFNG, CXCL8, CCL2, MMP9, TLR4 were identified as 
hub genes. Both shared pathways and hub genes are closely related to endoplasmic 
reticulum (ER) stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Importantly, glutathione, 
simvastatin, and dexamethasone were identified as important candidate drugs for 
the treatment of PT and AD.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a close link between PT and AD pathogenesis, which may 
involve in the inflammation, ER and mitochondrial function.

The review considers the use of exogenous neurotrophic factors in the treatment 
of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, 
multiple sclerosis, and others. This group of diseases is associated with the 
death of neurons and dysfunction of the nervous tissue. Currently, there is no 
effective therapy for neurodegenerative diseases, and their treatment remains a 
serious problem of modern medicine. A promising strategy is the use of exogenous 
neurotrophic factors. Targeted delivery of these factors to the nervous tissue 
can improve survival of neurons during the development of neurodegenerative 
processes and ensure neuroplasticity. There are methods of direct injection of 
neurotrophic factors into the nervous tissue, delivery using viral vectors, as 
well as the use of gene cell products. The effectiveness of these approaches has 
been studied in numerous experimental works and in a number of clinical trials. 
Further research in this area could provide the basis for the creation of an 
alternative treatment for neurodegenerative diseases.

Neurodegenerative disorder refers to malfunctioning of neurons their degradation 
leading to death of neurons. Among various neurodegenerative disorders APHD 
(Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's Disease) are particularly concerning 
due to their progressive and debilitating nature. The therapeutic agent used for 
treatment and management of APHD often show unsatisfactory clinical outcome 
owing to poor solubility and limited permeability across blood brain barrier 
(BBB). The nose-to brain delivery can overcome this BBB challenge as it can 
transport drug directly to brain though olfactory pathways bypassing BBB. 
Additionally, the nanotechnology has emerged as a cutting-edge methodology to 
address this issue and specifically mucoadhesive micro/nanoemulsion can improve 
the overall performance of the drug when administered intranasally. Beyond the 
therapy neurotechnology has emerged as are revolutionary AI-driven BCI (Brain 
computer interface) aimed to restore independence in patients with function loss 
due to neuron degeneration/death. A promising BCI Neuralink has been recently 
explored for clinical trials and results revealed that a quadriplegia bearing 
person with implanted Neuralink chip was able to perform few normal functions of 
daily routine such as playing online games, text messaging, reading, and 
learning foreign languages online through accessing the particular websites. 
This review will discuss the fundamental concepts of neurodegeneration, 
application of micro/nanoemulsion through intranasal route and integration of 
neurotechnology for the management and treatment of APHD.

Observational and genetic studies have reported the relationship between 
dyslexia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Until now, the causal effect of dyslexia 
on AD risk has remained unclear. We conducted a two-sample univariable Mendelian 
randomization (MR) analysis to determine the causal association between dyslexia 
and the risk of AD, vascular dementia (VD), Lewy body dementia (LBD), and 
frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and its four subtypes. First, we selected 42 
dyslexia genetic variants from a large-scale genome-wide association studies 
(GWAS) dataset and extracted their corresponding GWAS summary statistics from 
AD, VD, LBD, and FTD. Second, we selected four MR methods, including 
inverse-variance weighted (IVW), weighted median, MR-Egger, and MR-PRESSO. 
Heterogeneity, horizontal pleiotropy, and leave-one-out sensitivity analysis 
were then used to evaluate the reliability of all causal estimates. We also 
conducted multivariable MR (MVMR) and mediation analysis to assess the potential 
mediating role of cognitive performance (CP) or educational achievement (EA) on 
the causal association between dyslexia and AD. Two MVMR methods, including MV 
IVW and MV-Egger, and two-step MR were used to perform the analysis. Using IVW, 
we found a significant causal association between increased dyslexia and 
increased risk of AD (OR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.04-1.28, P = 0.006), but not VD, LBD, 
FTD, or its four subtypes. MR-PRESSO further supported the statistically 
significant association between dyslexia and AD (OR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.05-1.27, 
P = 0.006). All sensitivity analyses confirmed the reliability of causal 
estimates. Using MV IVW and mediation analysis, we found no causal relationship 
between dyslexia and AD after adjusting for CP but not EA, CP mediated the total 
effect of dyslexia on AD with a proportion of 46.32%. We provide genetic 
evidence to support a causal effect of increased dyslexia on increased risk of 
AD, which was largely mediated by CP. Reading activity may be a potential 
intervention strategy for AD by improving cognitive function.

FAM19A5, a novel secretory protein highly expressed in the brain, is potentially 
associated with the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, its role 
in the AD pathogenesis remains unclear. Here, we investigated the potential 
function of FAM19A5 in the context of AD. We generated APP/PS1 mice with partial 
FAM19A5 deficiency, termed APP/PS1/FAM19A5+/LacZ mice. Compared with control 
APP/PS1 mice, APP/PS1/FAM19A5+/LacZ mice exhibited significantly lower Aβ plaque 
density and prolonged the lifespan of the APP/PS1 mice. To further explore the 
therapeutic potential of targeting FAM19A5, we developed a FAM19A5 antibody. 
Administration of this antibody to APP/PS1 mice significantly improved their 
performance in the Y-maze and passive avoidance tests, indicating enhanced 
cognitive function. This effect was replicated in 5XFAD mice, a model of 
early-onset AD characterized by rapid Aβ accumulation. Additionally, FAM19A5 
antibody treatment in 5XFAD mice led to enhanced exploration of novel objects 
and increased spontaneous alternation behavior in the novel object recognition 
and Y-maze tests, respectively, indicating improved cognitive function. These 
findings suggest that FAM19A5 plays a significant role in AD pathology and that 
targeting with FAM19A5 antibodies may be a promising therapeutic strategy for 
AD.

BACKGROUND: Previous observational studies have suggested that there appears to 
be a close association between mitochondrial function and psychiatric disorders, 
but whether a causal role exists remains unclear.
METHODS: We extracted genetic instruments for 67 mitochondrial-related proteins 
and 10 psychiatric disorders from publicly available genome-wide association 
studies, and employed five distinct MR methods and false discovery rate 
correction to detect causal associations between them. Additionally, we 
conducted a series of sensitivity tests and additional model analysis to ensure 
the robustness of the results. For potential causal associations, we further 
performed reverse MR analyses to assess the impact of reverse causality.
RESULTS: We identified a total of 2 significant causal associations and 24 
suggestive causal associations. Specifically, Phenylalanine-tRNA ligase was 
found to increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease, while Mitochondrial glutamate 
carrier 2 decreased the risk of autism spectrum disorder. Furthermore, there was 
no evidence of significant pleiotropy, heterogeneity, or reverse causality.
LIMITATIONS: This study was limited to individuals of European ancestry, and the 
conclusions drawn are merely revelatory.
CONCLUSION: This study provides novel insights into the relationship between 
mitochondria and psychiatric disorders, as well as the pathogenesis and 
treatment strategies for psychiatric disorders.

Flavonoids, a commonly consumed natural product, elicit health-benefits such as 
antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, anti-allergic, hepatoprotective, 
anti-carcinogenic and neuroprotective activities. Several studies have reported 
the beneficial role of flavonoids in improving memory, learning, and cognition 
in clinical settings. Their mechanism of action is mediated through the 
modulation of multiple signalling cascades. This polypharmacology makes them an 
attractive natural scaffold for designing and developing new effective 
therapeutics for complex neurological disorders like Alzheimer's disease and 
Parkinson's disease. Flavonoids are shown to inhibit crucial targets related to 
neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs), including acetylcholinesterase, 
butyrylcholinesterase, β-secretase, γ-secretase, α-synuclein, Aβ protein 
aggregation and neurofibrillary tangles formation. Conserved neuro-signalling 
pathways related to neurotransmitter biogenesis and inactivation, ease of 
genetic manipulation and tractability, cost-effectiveness, and their short 
lifespan make Caenorhabditis elegans one of the most frequently used models in 
neuroscience research and high-throughput drug screening for neurodegenerative 
disorders. Here, we critically appraise the neuroprotective activities of 
different flavonoids based on clinical trials and epidemiological data. This 
review provides critical insights into the absorption, metabolism, and tissue 
distribution of various classes of flavonoids, as well as detailed mechanisms of 
the observed neuroprotective activities at the molecular level, to rationalize 
the clinical data. We further extend the review to critically evaluate the scope 
of flavonoids in the disease management of neurodegenerative disorders and 
review the suitability of C. elegans as a model organism to study the 
neuroprotective efficacy of flavonoids and natural products.

The development of successful therapeutics for dementias requires an 
understanding of their shared and distinct molecular features in the human 
brain. We performed single-nuclear RNA-seq and ATAC-seq in Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), 
analyzing 41 participants and ∼1 million cells (RNA + ATAC) from three brain 
regions varying in vulnerability and pathological burden. We identify 32 shared, 
disease-associated cell types and 14 that are disease specific. Disease-specific 
cell states represent glial-immune mechanisms and selective neuronal 
vulnerability impacting layer 5 intratelencephalic neurons in AD, layer 2/3 
intratelencephalic neurons in FTD, and layer 5/6 near-projection neurons in PSP. 
We identify disease-associated gene regulatory networks and cells impacted by 
causal genetic risk, which differ by disorder. These data illustrate the 
heterogeneous spectrum of glial and neuronal compositional and gene expression 
alterations in different dementias and identify therapeutic targets by revealing 
shared and disease-specific cell states.

Individuals with DS develop Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology, including 
endosomal-lysosomal system abnormalities and degeneration of basal forebrain 
cholinergic neurons (BFCNs). We investigated whether maternal choline 
supplementation (MCS) affects early endosome pathology within BFCNs using the 
Ts65Dn mouse model of DS/AD. Ts65Dn and disomic (2N) offspring from dams 
administered MCS were analyzed for endosomal pathology at 3-4 months or 10-12 
months. Morphometric analysis of early endosome phenotype was performed on 
individual BFCNs using Imaris. The effects of MCS on the endosomal interactome 
were interrogated by relative co-expression (RCE) analysis. MCS effectively 
reduced age- and genotype-associated increases in early endosome number in 
Ts65Dn and 2N offspring, and prevented increases in early endosome size in 
Ts65Dn offspring. RCE revealed a loss of interactome cooperativity among 
endosome genes in Ts65Dn offspring that was restored by MCS. These findings 
demonstrate MCS rescues early endosome pathology, a driver of septohippocampal 
circuit dysfunction. The genotype-independent benefits of MCS on endosomal 
phenotype indicate translational applicability as an early-life therapy for DS 
as well as other neurodevelopmental/neurodegenerative disorders involving 
endosomal pathology.

PURPOSE: Numerous studies have highlighted a close link between metabolic 
imbalances and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The advancement of metabolomics has 
recently enabled the exploration of characteristic metabolic changes associated 
with AD. Studies indicate that serum glutamate (Glu) levels may correlate with 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. This study aims to further elucidate the 
characteristics of baseline serum Glu levels in MCI and AD.
METHODS: This study included 783 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative-1 (ADNI-1) cohort, categorized into cognitively normal 
(CN, n = 224), stable MCI (sMCI, n = 181), progressive MCI (pMCI, n = 193), and 
AD (n = 185). The study aimed to analyze the diagnostic value of baseline serum 
Glu, to explore its predictive capability for the progression from CN to MCI or 
AD, and from MCI to AD, and to analyze the relationship between serum Glu and 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and cognitive functions in different 
diagnostic groups.
RESULTS: Compared to the CN and sMCI groups, the pMCI group showed significantly 
lower levels of serum Glu, and the AD group also had lower Glu levels compared 
to the sMCI group. However, serum Glu did not show significant diagnostic value 
for MCI and AD. Lower levels of serum Glu could predict the progression from MCI 
to AD.
CONCLUSION: Serum Glu levels can predict the progression from MCI to AD, 
suggesting that it could provide new insights into the pathophysiological 
mechanisms of AD. However, serum Glu may not be an ideal peripheral biomarker 
for AD.

This study protocol describes the development of the first instrument of 
functional communication for people living with primary progressive aphasia 
(PPA), with future applications to other progressive conditions, with expert 
validation, item-level reliability analyses, input from partners in research, 
and outcomes. Progressive conditions like PPA require monitoring, and as such, 
re-assessment. Re-assessment poses the high risk of being burdensome, 
destructive, and of little use to the patient. As such, there is a significant 
need to establish a validated and reliable measure that (1) poses minimal 
patient burden and (2) captures communication ability in a strengths-based 
manner for both clinical and research purposes. A strengths-based approach to 
assessment is widely recognized as the optimal way to promote patient autonomy, 
minimize harm, and implement functional treatment protocols and strategies. To 
date, there are no strengths-based assessment tools that were developed for 
people living with PPA nor ways to efficiently document functional communication 
performance. This study protocol outlines our work to address this gap in 
clinical practice and research.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI), a global leading cause of mortality and 
disability, lacks effective treatments to enhance recovery. Synaptic remodeling 
has been postulated as one mechanism that influences outcomes after TBI. We 
sought to investigate whether common mechanisms affecting synapse maintenance 
are shared between TBI and other neuropsychiatric conditions using pathway 
enrichment tools and genome-wide genotype data, with the goal of highlighting 
novel treatment targets. We leveraged an integrative approach, combining data 
from genome-wide association studies with pathway and gene-set enrichment 
analyses. Literature review-based and Reactome database-driven approaches were 
combined to identify synapse-related pathways of interest in TBI outcome and to 
assess for shared associations with conditions in which synapse-related 
pathobiological mechanisms have been implicated, including Alzheimer's disease, 
schizophrenia (SCZ), major depressive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, 
attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and autism spectrum disorder. Gene and 
pathway-level enrichment analyses were conducted using MAGMA and its extensions, 
e- and H-MAGMA, followed by Mendelian randomization to investigate potential 
causal associations. Of the 98 pathways tested, 32 were significantly enriched 
in the included conditions. In TBI outcome, we identified significant enrichment 
in five pathways: "Serotonin clearance from the synaptic cleft" (p = 0.0001), 
"Presynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors" (p = 0.0003), "Postsynaptic 
nicotinic acetylcholine receptors" (p = 0.0003), "Highly sodium permeable 
postsynaptic acetylcholine nicotinic receptors" (p = 0.0001), and "Acetylcholine 
binding and downstream events" pathways (p = 0.0003). These associations 
highlight potential involvement of the cholinergic and serotonergic systems in 
post-TBI recovery. Three of those pathways were shared between TBI and SCZ, 
suggesting possible pathophysiologic commonalities. In this study, we utilize 
comparative and integrative genomic approaches across brain conditions that 
share synaptic mechanisms to explore the pathophysiology of TBI outcomes. Our 
results implicate associations between TBI outcome and synaptic pathways as well 
as pathobiological overlap with other neuropsychiatric diseases.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are the two most common 
neurodegenerative diseases in the world. Misfolding of β-amyloid (Aβ) and 
α-synuclein (α-syn) and subsequent fibril formation are closely associated with 
the pathogenesis of AD and PD, respectively. Lentinan is a natural product 
commonly used in medicine and dietary supplements. It has potential antitumor, 
anti-inflammatory, and antiviral effects, but the underlying mechanism of its 
action on AD and PD remains unclear. In this study, lentinan inhibited the 
formation of Aβ and α-syn fibers in a dose-dependent manner and disrupted their 
mature fibers. Lentinan inhibited the conversion of Aβ and α-syn conformations 
to β-sheet-rich conformations. Additionally, lentinan protected Caenorhabditis 
elegans against damage caused by the accumulation of Aβ and α-syn aggregation 
and prolonged their lifespan. Notably, the beneficial effects of lentinan in AD 
and PD mice were also demonstrated, including ameliorating the cognitive and 
memory impairments in AD mice and behavioral deficits in PD mice. Finally, 
molecular interactions between lentinan and Aβ/α-syn pentamers were also 
explored using molecular docking.

RATIONALE: The endocannabinoid system (ECS) belongs to the G protein-coupled 
receptor family of cell membranes and is associated with neuropsychiatric 
conditions, and neurodegenerative diseases. Cannabinoid 2 receptors (CB2) are 
expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) on microglia and subgroups of 
neurons and are involved in various behavioural processes via immunological and 
neural regulation.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to summarize and explore the impact of 
CB2 receptors on neuronal modulation, their involvement in various neurological 
disorders, and their influence on mood, behavior, and cognitive function.
RESULTS: The activation of CB2 appears to protect the brain and its functions 
from damage under neuroinflammatory actions, making it an attractive target in a 
variety of neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple 
sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Huntington's disease (HD). During 
inflammation, there is an overexpression of CB2 receptors, and CB2 agonists show 
a strong anti-inflammatory effect. These results have sparked interest in the 
CB2 receptors as a potential target for neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory 
disease treatment.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, CB2 receptors signalling shows promise for developing 
targeted interventions that could positively affect both immune and neuronal 
functions, ultimately influencing behavioral outcomes in both health and 
disease.

Blood-based biomarkers (BBM) are becoming easily detectable tools to reveal 
pathological changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD). A comprehensive and up-to-date 
overview of the association between BBM and brain MRI parameters is not 
available. This systematic review aimed to summarize the literature on the 
associations between the main BBM and MRI markers across the clinical AD 
continuum. A systematic literature search was carried out on PubMed and Web of 
Science and a total of 33 articles were included. Hippocampal volume was 
positively correlated with Aβ42 and Aβ42/Aβ40 and negatively with Aβ40 plasma 
levels. P-tau181 and p-tau217 concentrations were negatively correlated with 
temporal grey matter volume and cortical thickness. NfL levels were negatively 
correlated with white matter microstructural integrity, whereas GFAP levels were 
positively correlated with myo-inositol values in the posterior cingulate 
cortex/precuneus. These findings highlight consistent associations between 
various BBM and brain MRI markers even in the pre-clinical and prodromal stages 
of AD. This suggests a possible advantage in combining multiple AD-related 
markers to improve accuracy of early diagnosis, prognosis, progression 
monitoring and treatment response.

INTRODUCTION: Recent advances in biomarker research have improved the diagnosis 
and monitoring of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but in vivo biomarker-based 
workflows to assess 4R-tauopathy (4RT) patients are currently missing. We 
suggest a novel biomarker-based algorithm to characterize AD and 4RTs.
METHODS: We cross-sectionally assessed combinations of cerebrospinal fluid 
measures (CSF p-tau181 and t-tau) and 18F-PI-2620 tau-positron emission 
tomography (PET) in patients with AD (n = 64), clinically suspected 4RTs 
(progressive supranuclear palsy or corticobasal syndrome, n = 82) and healthy 
controls (n = 19).
RESULTS: Elevated CSF p-tau181 and cortical 18F-PI-2620 binding was 
characteristic for AD while normal CSF p-tau181 with elevated subcortical 
18F-PI-2620 binding was characteristic for 4RTs. 18F-PI-2620-assessed posterior 
cortical hypoperfusion could be used as an additional neuronal injury biomarker 
in AD.
DISCUSSION: The specific combination of CSF markers and 18F-PI-2620 tau-PET in 
disease-specific regions facilitates the biomarker-guided stratification of AD 
and 4RTs. This has implications for biomarker-aided diagnostic workflows and the 
advancement in clinical trials.
HIGHLIGHTS: Novel biomarker-based algorithm for differentiating AD and 
4R-tauopathies. A combination of CSF p-tau181 and 18F-PI-2620 discriminates AD 
versus 4R tauopathies. Hypoperfusion serves as an additional neuronal injury 
biomarker in AD.

Family caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias 
(ADRD) living in rural areas face significant health and healthcare challenges. 
Limited research, however, has explored factors shaping their use of home- and 
community-based services (HCBS). This study identifies unmet needs among 
caregivers of people with ADRD in rural Western North Carolina and highlights 
contextual factors that facilitate HCBS use. Nineteen qualitative interviews 
were conducted with 21 family caregivers and 1 person with ADRD between 2021 and 
2022. Thematic analyses revealed unmet needs among caregivers for information, 
service navigation, and caregiving support. HCBS use was shaped by multiple 
factors including illness needs, cultural beliefs, preferences for home-based 
care, and place-based resources. These findings suggest that culturally tailored 
HCBS are needed to support people with ADRD and their caregivers in rural 
Appalachian communities, especially those which facilitate access to paid 
caregiving, clearly communicate program eligibility requirements, and emphasize 
service availability.

Brain health means optimal physiological brain function across the normal 
life-course. It encompasses not only healthy brain aging but also brain 
diseases, their diagnosis and treatment. In all these areas, molecular science 
has advanced our understanding. This multi-disciplinary review combines 
viewpoints from laboratory science, clinical medicine and the bioscience 
industry. First, we review the advances that molecular science has brought to 
brain health in the past twenty years. These include therapeutic antibodies for 
CNS diseases (multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer disease) and the dramatic 
introduction of RNA-targeted therapeutics. Second, we highlight areas where 
greater molecular understanding is needed. Salient examples are the relation of 
brain structure to cognitive symptoms, and molecular biomarkers for diagnosis, 
target discovery and testing of interventions. Finally, we speculate on aspects 
of molecular science that are likely to advance brain health in the next twenty 
years. These include: cell senescence and chronobiology; gene editing (notably, 
CRISPR) and RNA targeting (RNA interference, miRNA manipulation); brain-immune 
interactions; novel drug targets (AQP4, HIF1, Toll-like receptors); and novel 
chemistry to make new drugs (molecular machines, quantum molecular modelling and 
"click" chemistry). Early testing of the relationships between molecular 
pathways and clinical manifestations will drive much-needed breakthroughs in 
neurology and psychiatry.

Menopause is a natural phase marked by the permanent cessation of menstrual 
cycles, occurring when the production of reproductive hormones from the ovaries 
stops for at least 12 consecutive months. Studies have suggested a potential 
connection between menopause and a heightened risk of developing Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), underscoring the significant role of reduced estrogen levels in 
the development of AD. Estrogen plays a crucial role in brain metabolism, 
influencing energy metabolism, synaptic plasticity, and cognitive functions. The 
cognitive benefits associated with hormone replacement therapy (HRT) are 
believed to be linked to estrogen's neuroprotective effects, either through 
direct action on the brain or indirectly by improving cardiovascular health. 
Extensive literature supports the positive impact of estrogen on brain cells. 
While the physiological effects of estrogen on the brain have not been 
consistently replicated in clinical trials, further research is crucial to 
provide more definitive recommendations to menopausal patients regarding the 
influence of HRT on AD. This review aims to comprehensively explore the 
interplay between menopause and AD, as well as the potential of HRT to mitigate 
cognitive decline in post-menopausal individuals.

The limited success of plaque-reducing therapies in Alzheimer's disease suggests 
that early treatment might be more effective in delaying or reversing memory 
impairments. Toward this end, it is important to establish the progression of 
synaptic and circuit changes before onset of plaques or cognitive deficits. 
Here, we used quantitative, fluorescence-based methods for synapse detection in 
CA1 pyramidal neurons to investigate the interaction between abnormal circuit 
activity, measured by Fos-immunoreactivity, and synapse reorganization in mouse 
models of amyloidosis. Using a genetically encoded, fluorescently labeled 
synaptic marker in juvenile mice (prior to sexual maturity), we find both 
synapse gain and loss depending on dendritic location. This progresses to broad 
synapse loss in aged mice. Elevated hippocampal activity in both CA3 and CA1 was 
present at weaning and preceded this reorganization. Thus, Aβ overproduction may 
initiate abnormal activity and subsequent input-specific synapse plasticity. 
These findings indicate that sustained amyloidosis drives heterogeneous and 
progressive circuit-wide abnormalities.

[Rationale for Increasing Doses of Statins in Everyday Clinical Practice].

[Article in Russian]

Susekov AV(1).

Author information:
(1)Russian Medical Academy of Continuous Professional Education.

HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) were discovered in the early 1970s in 
Japan and were originally used to treat patients with hereditary hyperlipidemia. 
In the late 1990s and early 2000s, clinical trials using statins for primary and 
secondary prevention showed the possibility of reducing cardiovascular (CV) and, 
in some cases, all-cause mortality. Intensive statin therapy (atorvastatin 80 
mg/day and rosuvastatin 40 mg/day) compared to initial doses provides an 
additional 16% reduction in CV complications. Regression studies with the 
original rosuvastatin using intracoronary ultrasound and other modern methods 
have shown the possibility of stabilization and regression of atherosclerosis in 
the carotid and coronary arteries. High-dose statin therapy is generally well 
tolerated; the incidence of clinically significant adverse liver reactions does 
not exceed 2-3 per 100,000 people, and the incidence of myopathies with 
increased creatine kinase over 10 upper limits of normal is not higher than 1 
per 10,000 people per year. Long-term statin treatment does not increase the 
risk of dementia and, in some studies, reduced the risk of Alzheimer's disease. 
Achieving target levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in 
routine practice does not exceed 5-11%; one of the main reasons for that is the 
rare (2-3%) prescription of high doses of statins. Increasing statin doses in 
routine clinical practice will optimize the treatment of patients with high CV 
risk and will contribute to further reduction of mortality in our country.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a significant global healthcare challenge, 
particularly in the elderly population. This neurodegenerative disorder is 
characterized by impaired memory and progressive decline in cognitive function. 
BACE1, a transmembrane protein found in neurons, oligodendrocytes, and 
astrocytes, exhibits varying levels across different neural subtypes. Abnormal 
BACE1 activity in the brains of individuals with AD leads to the formation of 
beta-amyloid proteins. The complex interplay between myelin sheath formation, 
BACE1 activity, and beta-amyloid accumulation suggests a critical role in 
understanding the pathological mechanisms of AD. The primary objective of this 
study was to identify molecular inhibitors that target Aβ. Structure-based 
virtual screening (SBVS) was employed using the MCULE database, which houses 
over 2 million chemical compounds. A total of 59 molecules were selected after 
the toxicity profiling. Subsequently, five compounds conforming to the Egan-Egg 
permeation predictive model of the ADME rules were selected and subjected to 
molecular docking using AutoDock Vina on the Mcule drug discovery platform. The 
top two ligands and the positive control, 5HA, were subjected to molecular 
dynamics simulation for five nanoseconds. Toxicity profiling, physiochemical

INTRODUCTION: Diagnostic criteria for Parkinson's disease (PD) rely on clinical, 
mainly motor, features, implying that pre-motor phase cannot be accurately 
identified. To achieve a reliable early diagnosis, similar to what has been done 
for Alzheimer's disease (AD), a shift from clinical to biological identification 
of PD is being pursued. This shift has taken great advantage from the research 
on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers as they mirror the ongoing molecular 
pathogenic mechanisms taking place in PD, thus intercepting the disease timely 
with respect to clinical manifestations.
AREAS COVERED: CSF α-synuclein seed amplification assay (αS-SAA) has emerged as 
the most promising biomarker of α-synucleinopathy. CSF biomarkers reflecting 
AD-pathology and axonal damage (neurofilament light chain) and a novel marker of 
dopaminergic dysfunction (DOPA decarboxylase) add valuable diagnostic and 
prognostic information in the neurochemical characterization of PD.
EXPERT OPINION: A biological classification system of PD, encompassing 
pathophysiological and staging biomarkers, might ensure both early 
identification and prognostic characterization of the patients. This approach 
could allow for the best setting for disease-modifying treatments which are 
currently under investigation.

As the global older adult population continues to grow, challenges related to 
managing multiple chronic conditions (MCCs) or multimorbidity underscore the 
growing need for palliative care. Palliative care preferences and needs vary 
significantly based on context, location, and culture. As a result, there is a 
need for more clarity on what constitutes palliative care in diverse settings. 
Our objective was to present an international perspective on palliative care in 
India, a culturally diverse and large ancient Eastern middle-income country. In 
this narrative review article, we considered three questions when re-designing 
palliative care for older adults aging-in-place in India: (I) what are the needs 
for palliative care for persons and their families? (II) Which palliative care 
domains are essential in assessing improvements in the quality of life (QoL)? 
(III) What patient reported measures are essential considerations for palliative 
care? To address these questions, we provide recommendations based on the 
following key domains: social, behavioral, psychological, cultural, spiritual, 
medical, bereavement, legal, and economic. Using an established and widely 
reported conceptual framework on aging and health disparities, we provide how 
these domains map across multiple levels of influence, such as individual or 
family members, community, institutions, and health systems for achieving the 
desired QoL. For greater adoption, reach, and accessibility across diverse 
India, we conclude palliative care must be carefully and systematically 
re-designed to be culturally appropriate and community-focused, incorporating 
traditions, individual preferences, language(s), supports and services from 
educational and health institutions, community organizations and the government. 
In addition, national government insurance schemes such as the Ayushman Bharat 
Yojna can include explicit provisions for palliative care so that it is 
affordable to all, regardless of ability to pay. In summary, our considerations 
for incorporating palliative care domains to care of whole person and their 
families, and provision of supports of services from an array of stakeholders 
broadly apply to culturally diverse older adults aging in place in India and 
around the globe who prefer to age and die in place.

Familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) is a chronic neurological condition that 
progresses over time. Currently, lacking a viable treatment, the use of 
multitarget medication combinations has generated interest as a potential FAD 
therapy approach. In this study, we examined the effects of 4-phenylbutyric acid 
(4-PBA) and methylene blue (MB) either separately or in combination on PSEN1 
I416T cholinergic-like neuron cells (ChLNs), which serve as a model for FAD. We 
found that MB was significantly efficient at reducing the accumulation of 
intracellular Aβ, phosphorylation of TAU Ser202/Thr205, and increasing Δψm, 
whereas 4-PBA was significantly efficient at diminishing oxidation of 
DJ-1Cys106-SH, expression of TP53, and increasing ACh-induced Ca2+ influx. Both 
agents were equally effective at blunting phosphorylated c-JUN at Ser63/Ser73 
and activating caspase 3 (CASP3) into cleaved caspase 3 (CC3) on mutant cells. 
Combination of MB and 4-PBA at middle (0.1, 1) concentration significantly 
reduced iAβ, p-TAU, and oxDJ-1 and augmented the ACh-induced Ca2+ influx 
compared to combined agents at low (0.05, 0.5) or high (0.5, 5) concentration. 
However, combined MB and 4-PBA were efficient only at dropping DJ-1Cys106-SO3 
and increasing ACh-induced Ca2+ inward in mutant ChLNs. Our data show that the 
reagents MB and 4-PBA alone possess more than one action (e.g., antiamyloid, 
antioxidant, anti-TAU, antiapoptotic, and ACh-induced Ca2+ influx enhancers), 
that in combination might cancel or diminish each other. Together, these results 
strongly argue that MB and 4-PBA might protect PSEN1 I416T ChLNs from Aβ-induced 
toxicity by working intracellularly as anti-Aβ and anti-Tau agents, improving 
Δψm and cell survival, and extracellularly, by increasing ACh-induced Ca2+ ion 
influx. MB and 4-PBA are promising drugs with potential for repurposing in 
familial AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common aetiology of dementia. The 
transcription factor NF-E2-related factor 2 (NRF2) induces the expression of 
genes encoding phase II detoxification and antioxidant genes. NRF2 is regulated 
by Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1), and the KEAP1-NRF2 system is the 
key regulatory system involved in cytoprotection. To examine whether 
pharmacological induction of NRF2 expression alleviates AD phenotypes in vivo, 
we employed two AD mouse models, i.e. App  NL-G-F/NL-G-F (AppNLGF) and 
APPV717I::TAUP301L (APP/TAU) mice. As the synthetic oleanane triterpenoid 
1-[2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9(11-dien-28-oyl)] 
(CDDO)-4(-pyridin-2-yl)-imidazole (CDDO-2P-Im) exhibits strong NRF2-inducing 
activity, we treated AD model mice with CDDO-2P-Im. We found that Aβ42 levels 
were markedly greater in the brains of AppNLGF mice than in those of APP/TAU 
mice. CDDO-2P-Im treatment significantly decreased Aβ42 levels, but not Aβ40 
levels, in APP/TAU mice. Consequently, CDDO-2P-Im also decreased the ratio of 
Aβ42/Aβ40, a vital marker of amyloid plaque formation. LC-MS/MS analyses 
revealed that CDDO-2P-Im was delivered to the brains of the APP/TAU mice. 
CDDO-2P-Im induced the expression of detoxification and antioxidant gene targets 
of NRF2 and elevated reduced glutathione (GSH) levels in the mouse brain. These 
results support the notion that CDDO-2P-Im ameliorates AD-related pathologic 
changes.

Positive effects of new anti-amyloid-β (Aβ) monoclonal antibodies in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) have been attributed to brain amyloid reduction. However, most 
anti-Aβ antibodies also increase the CSF levels of the 42-amino acid isoform 
(Aβ42). We evaluated the associations of changes in CSF Aβ42 and brain Aβ-PET 
with cognitive and clinical end points in randomized trials of anti-Aβ drugs 
that lowered (β- and γ-secretase inhibitors) or increased CSF Aβ42 levels 
(anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies) to test the hypothesis that post-treatment 
increases in CSF Aβ42 levels are independently associated with cognitive and 
clinical outcomes. From long-term (≥12 months) randomized placebo-controlled 
clinical trials of anti-Aβ drugs published until November 2023, we calculated 
the post-treatment versus baseline difference in ADAS-Cog (cognitive subscale of 
the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale) and CDR-SB (Clinical Dementia Rate-Sum 
of Boxes) and z-standardized changes in CSF Aβ42 and Aβ-PET Centiloids (CL). We 
estimated the effect size [regression coefficients (RCs) and confidence 
intervals (CIs)] and the heterogeneity (I2) of the associations between AD 
biomarkers and cognitive and clinical end points using random-effects 
meta-regression models. We included 25 966 subjects with AD from 24 trials. In 
random-effects analysis, increases in CSF Aβ42 were associated with slower 
decline in ADAS-Cog (RC: -0.55; 95% CI: -0.89, -0.21, P = 0.003, I2 = 61.4%) and 
CDR-SB (RC: -0.16; 95% CI: -0.26, -0.06, P = 0.002, I2 = 34.5%). Similarly, 
decreases in Aβ-PET were associated with slower decline in ADAS-Cog (RC: 0.69; 
95% CI: 0.48, 0.89, P < 0.001, I2 = 0%) and CDR-SB (RC: 0.26; 95% CI: 0.18, 
0.33, P < 0.001, I2 = 0%). Sensitivity analyses yielded similar results. Higher 
CSF Aβ42 levels after exposure to anti-Aβ drugs are independently associated 
with slowing cognitive impairment and clinical decline. Increases in Aβ42 may 
represent a mechanism of potential benefit of anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies in 
AD.

Acetylcholine (ACh) is a critical neurotransmitter influencing various 
neurophysiological functions. Despite its significance, quantitative methods 
with adequate spatiotemporal resolution for recording a single exocytotic ACh 
efflux are lacking. In this study, we introduce an ultrafast amperometric ACh 
biosensor that enables 50 kHz electrochemical recording of spontaneous single 
exocytosis events at axon terminals of differentiated cholinergic human SH-SY5Y 
neuroblastoma cells with sub-millisecond temporal resolution. Characterization 
of the recorded amperometric traces revealed seven distinct current spike types, 
each displaying variations in shape, time scale, and ACh quantities released. 
This finding suggests that exocytotic release is governed by complex fusion pore 
dynamics in these cells. The absolute number of ACh molecules released during 
exocytosis was quantified by calibrating the sensor through the electroanalysis 
of liposomes preloaded with varying ACh concentrations. Notably, the largest 
quantal release involving approximately 8000 ACh molecules likely represents 
full exocytosis, while a smaller release of 5000 ACh molecules may indicate 
partial exocytosis. Following a local administration of bafilomycin A1, a 
V-ATPase inhibitor, the cholinergic cells exhibited both a larger quantity of 
ACh released and a higher frequency of exocytosis events. Therefore, this ACh 
sensor provides a means to monitor minute amounts of ACh and investigate 
regulatory release mechanisms at the single-cell level, which is vital for 
understanding healthy brain function and pathologies and optimizing drug 
treatment for disorders.

INTRODUCTION: We examined the relations of misfolded alpha synuclein 
(α-synuclein) with Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers in two large independent 
cohorts.
METHODS: We included Biomarkers for Identifying Neurodegenerative Disorders 
Early and Reliably Two (BioFINDER-2) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) participants (n = 2315, cognitively unimpaired, mild cognitive 
impairment, AD dementia) who had cross-sectional cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
α-synuclein measurement from seed-amplification assay as well as cross-sectional 
and longitudinal amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau levels (measured in CSF and/or by 
positron emission tomography). All analyses were adjusted for age, sex, and 
cognitive status.
RESULTS: Across cohorts, the main biomarker associated with α-synuclein 
positivity at baseline was higher levels of Aβ pathology (all p values ≤ 0.02), 
but not tau. Looking at longitudinal measures of AD biomarkers, α-synuclein 
-positive participants had a statistically significant faster increase of Aβ 
load, although of modest magnitude (1.11 Centiloid/year, p = 0.02), compared to 
α-synuclein -negative participants in BioFINDER-2 but not in ADNI.
DISCUSSION: We showed associations between concurrent misfolded α-synuclein and 
Aβ levels, providing in vivo evidence of links between these two molecular 
disease pathways in humans.
HIGHLIGHTS: Amyloid beta (Aβ), but not tau, was associated with alpha-synuclein 
(α-synuclein) positivity. Such association was consistent across two cohorts, 
beyond the effect of age, sex, and cognitive status. α-synuclein-positive 
participants had a small, statistically significant faster increase in Aβ 
positron emission tomography levels in one of the two cohorts.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Dental care utilization is an important, yet 
understudied aspect of healthcare in informal caregivers of persons with 
dementia. This study examined how caregiving-related characteristics are 
associated with dental care utilization among U.S. informal caregivers of 
persons with dementia and further examined gender differences.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Pooled data came from the Behavioral Risk Factor 
Surveillance System in 2016, 2018, 2020, and 2022. A nationally representative 
sample of informal caregivers (n = 3,909) was included. Dental care utilization 
was "yes" versus "no" within the past year. Caregiving-related characteristics 
included caregiver role, intensity of care, duration of care, and type of care. 
Logistic regressions and subgroup analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: In total sample, compared to adult child caregivers, spousal caregivers 
were 28% less likely to visit a dentist (odds ratio [OR] = 0.72; 95% confidence 
interval [CI] = 0.56, 0.94). Caregivers who provided care for more than 
20 hr per week were 18% less likely to visit a dentist (OR = 0.82; 95% CI = 
0.69, 0.98). In subgroup analyses, intensity of care was a barrier to dental 
care utilization for female caregivers (OR = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.62, 0.98), whereas 
caregiver role such as spousal caregiver (OR = 0.59; 95% CI = 0.39, 0.89) or 
other relative caregiver (OR = 0.70; 95% CI = 0.50, 0.99) was a barrier to 
dental care utilization for male caregivers.
DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: The findings highlight the importance of 
caregiving-related characteristics in dental care utilization and suggest 
gender-tailored interventions.

Due to its high modification content tRNAs are notoriously hard to quantify by 
reverse transcription and RNAseq. Bypassing numerous biases resulting from 
concatenation of enzymatic treatments, we here report a hybrid approach that 
harnesses the advantages of hybridization-based and deep sequencing-based 
approaches. The method renders obsolete any RNAseq related workarounds and 
correction factors that affect accuracy, sensitivity, and turnaround time. 
Rather than by reverse transcription, quantitative information on the 
isoacceptor composition of a tRNA pool is transferred to a cDNA mixture in a 
single step procedure, thereby omitting all enzymatic conversations except for 
the subsequent barcoding PCR. As a result, a detailed tRNA composition matrix 
can be obtained from femtomolar amounts of total tRNA. The method is fast, low 
in cost, and its bioinformatic data workup surprisingly simple. These properties 
make the approach amenable to high-throughput investigations including clinical 
samples, as we have demonstrated by application to a collection of variegated 
biological questions, each answered with novel findings. These include tRNA pool 
quantification of polysome-bound tRNA, of tRNA modification knockout strains 
under stress conditions, and of Alzheimer patients' brain tissues.

The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Core has been operating since Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative's (ADNI) inception, providing 20 years of data 
including reliable, multi-platform standardized protocols, carefully curated 
image data, and quantitative measures provided by expert investigators. The 
overarching purposes of the MRI Core include: (1) optimizing and standardizing 
MRI acquisition methods, which have been adopted by many multicenter studies and 
trials worldwide and (2) providing curated images and numeric summary values 
from relevant MRI sequences/contrasts to the scientific community. Over time, 
ADNI MRI has become increasingly complex. To remain technically current, the 
ADNI MRI protocol has changed substantially over the past two decades. The ADNI 
4 protocol contains nine different imaging types (e.g., three dimensional [3D] 
T1-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery [FLAIR]). Our view is that 
the ADNI MRI data are a greatly underutilized resource. The purpose of this 
paper is to educate the scientific community on ADNI MRI methods and content to 
promote greater awareness, accessibility, and use. HIGHLIGHTS: The MRI Core 
provides multi-platform standardized protocols, carefully curated image data, 
and quantitative analysis by expert groups. The ADNI MRI protocol has undergone 
major changes over the past two decades to remain technically current. As of 
April 25, 2024, the following numbers of image series are available: 17,141 3D 
T1w; 6877 FLAIR; 3140 T2/PD; 6623 GRE; 3237 dMRI; 2846 ASL; 2968 TF-fMRI; and 
2861 HighResHippo (see Table 1 for abbreviations). As of April 25, 2024, the 
following numbers of quantitative analyses are available: FreeSurfer 10,997; BSI 
6120; tensor based morphometry (TBM) and TBM-SYN 12,019; WMH 9944; dMRI 1913; 
ASL 925; TF-fMRI NFQ 2992; and medial temporal subregion volumes 2726 (see Table 
4 for abbreviations). ADNI MRI is an underutilized resource that could be more 
useful to the research community.

There is presently no disease-modifying therapy for Alzheimer's Disease (AD), 
which is the most prevalent cause of dementia.
OBJECTIVE: This study aspires to estimate the efficacy and safety of cell-based 
treatments in AD.
METHODS: Observing the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methods and Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement, a 
systematic search was accomplished in PubMed, Medical Literature Analysis and 
Retrieval System Online (Medline, via Ovid), Embase; Cochrane, and Cumulative 
Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature - CINAHL (via EBSCO) databases up 
to June 2023. The relevant clinical studies in which cell-based therapies were 
utilized to manage AD were included. The risk of bias was evaluated using the 
JBI checklists, based on the study designs.
RESULTS: Out of 1,014 screened records, a total of five studies with 70 
individuals (including 59 patients receiving stem cells and 11 placebo controls) 
were included. In all these studies, despite the discrepancy in the origin of 
stem cells, cell density, and transplant site, safety goals were obtained. The 
intracerebroventricular injection of adipose-derived stromal vascular fraction 
(ADSVF) and umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs), the 
intravenous injection of Lomecel-B, and the bilateral hippocampi and right 
precuneus injection of UC-MSCs are not linked to any significant safety 
concerns, according to the five included studies. Studies also revealed 
improvements in biomarkers and clinical outcomes as a secondary outcome. Three 
studies had no control groups and there are concerns regarding the similarity of 
the groups in others. Also, there is considerable risk of bias regarding the 
outcome assessment scales.
CONCLUSION: Cell-based therapies are well tolerated by AD patients, which 
emphasizes the need for further, carefully planned randomized studies to reach 
evidence-based clinical recommendations in this respect.

Publisher: Atualmente, não há terapia modificadora da doença para a doença de 
Alzheimer (DA), que é a causa mais prevalente de demência.
OBJETIVO: Este estudo teve como objetivo estimar a eficácia e segurança dos 
tratamentos baseados em células na DA.
MÉTODOS: Observando os métodos do JBI e a declaração PRISMA, uma busca 
sistemática foi realizada nas bases de dados PubMed, Medical Literature Analysis 
and Retrieval System Online — Medline (via Ovid), Embase, Cochrane e CINAHL (via 
EBSCO) até junho de 2023. Foram incluídos os estudos clínicos relevantes nos 
quais terapias baseadas em células foram utilizadas para gerenciar a DA. O risco 
de viés foi avaliado utilizando os checklists do JBI, com base nos desenhos dos 
estudos.
RESULTADOS: Dos 1.014 registros examinados, foi incluído um total de cinco 
estudos com 70 indivíduos (incluindo 59 pacientes que receberam células-tronco e 
11 controles de placebo). Em todos esses estudos, apesar da discrepância na 
origem das células-tronco, densidade celular e local de transplante, os 
objetivos de segurança foram alcançados. A injeção intracerebroventricular de 
ADSVF e UC-MSCs, a injeção intravenosa de Lomecel-B e a injeção bilateral dos 
hipocampos e precuneus direito de UC-MSCs não estão relacionadas a quaisquer 
preocupações significativas de segurança, de acordo com os cinco estudos 
incluídos. Os estudos também revelaram melhorias nos biomarcadores e resultados 
clínicos como um desfecho secundário. Três estudos não tinham grupos de controle 
e há preocupações quanto à semelhança dos grupos em outros. Além disso, há um 
risco considerável de viés em relação às escalas de avaliação de desfechos.
CONCLUSÃO: As terapias baseadas em células são bem toleradas por pacientes com 
DA, o que enfatiza a necessidade de mais estudos randomizados cuidadosamente 
planejados para alcançar recomendações clínicas baseadas em evidências.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Periodontitis (PD), a chronic inflammatory disease, 
is a serious threat to oral health and is one of the risk factors for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). A growing body of evidence suggests that the two 
diseases are closely related. However, current studies have not provided a 
comprehensive understanding of the common genes and common mechanisms between PD 
and AD. This study aimed to screen the crosstalk genes of PD and AD and the 
potential relationship between cross-talk and PANoptosis-related genes. The 
relationship between core genes and immune cells will be analyzed to provide new 
targets for clinical treatment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The PD and AD datasets were downloaded from the GEO 
database and differential expression analysis was performed to obtain DEGs. 
Overlapping DEGs had cross-talk genes linking PD and OP, and PANoptosis-related 
genes were obtained from a literature review. Pearson coefficients were used to 
compute cross-talk and PANoptosis-related gene correlations in the PD and AD 
datasets. Cross-talk genes were obtained from the intersection of PD and 
AD-related genes, protein-protein interaction(PPI) networks were constructed and 
cross-talk genes were identified using the STRING database. The intersection of 
cross-talk and PANoptosis-related genes was defined as cross-talk-PANoptosis 
genes. Core genes were screened using ROC analysis and XGBoost. PPI subnetwork, 
gene-biological process, and gene-pathway networks were constructed based on the 
core genes. In addition, immune infiltration on the PD and AD datasets was 
analyzed using the CIBERSORT algorithm.
RESULTS: 366 cross-talk genes were overlapping between PD DEGs and AD DEGs. The 
intersection of cross-talk genes with 109 PANoptosis-related genes was defined 
as cross-talk-PANoptosis genes. ROC and XGBoost showed that MLKL, DCN, IL1B, and 
IL18 were more accurate than the other cross-talk-PANoptosis genes in predicting 
the disease, as well as better in overall characterization. GO and KEGG analyses 
showed that the four core genes were involved in immunity and inflammation in 
the organism. Immune infiltration analysis showed that B cells naive, Plasma 
cells, and T cells gamma delta were significantly differentially expressed in 
patients with PD and AD compared with the normal group. Finally, 10 drugs 
associated with core genes were retrieved from the DGIDB database.
CONCLUSION: This study reveals the joint mechanism between PD and AD associated 
with PANoptosis. Analyzing the four core genes and immune cells may provide new 
therapeutic directions for the pathogenesis of PD combined with AD.

Alpha-synuclein (αSyn) is an intrinsically disordered protein that accumulates 
in the brains of patients with Parkinson's disease and forms intraneuronal 
inclusions called Lewy Bodies. While the mechanism underlying the dysregulation 
of αSyn in Parkinson's disease is unclear, it is thought that prionoid 
cell-to-cell propagation of αSyn has an important role. Through a high 
throughput screen, we recently identified 38 genes whose knock down modulates 
αSyn propagation. Follow up experiments were undertaken for two of those genes, 
TAX1BP1 and ADAMTS19, to study the mechanism with which they regulate αSyn 
homeostasis. We used a recently developed M17D neuroblastoma cell line 
expressing triple mutant (E35K+E46K+E61K) "3K" αSyn under doxycycline induction. 
3K αSyn spontaneously forms inclusions that show ultrastructural similarities to 
Lewy Bodies. Experiments using that cell line showed that TAX1BP1 and ADAMTS19 
regulate how αSyn interacts with lipids and phase separates into inclusions, 
respectively, adding to the growing body of evidence implicating those processes 
in Parkinson's disease. Through RNA sequencing, we identified several genes that 
are differentially expressed after knock-down of TAX1BP1 or ADAMTS19. Burden 
analysis revealed that those differentially expressed genes (DEGs) carry an 
increased frequency of rare risk variants in Parkinson's disease patients versus 
healthy controls, an effect that was independently replicated across two 
separate cohorts (GP2 and AMP-PD). Weighted gene co-expression network analysis 
(WGCNA) showed that the DEGs cluster within modules in regions of the brain that 
develop high degrees of αSyn pathology (basal ganglia, cortex). We propose a 
novel model for the genetic architecture of sporadic Parkinson's disease: 
increased burden of risk variants across genetic networks dysregulates pathways 
underlying αSyn homeostasis, thereby leading to pathology and neurodegeneration.

Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease-related dementias (AD/ADRD) pose 
major global healthcare challenges, with diabetes mellitus (DM) being a key risk 
factor. Both AD and DM-related ADRD are characterized by reduced cerebral blood 
flow, although the exact mechanisms remain unclear. We previously identified 
compromised cerebral hemodynamics as early signs in TgF344-AD and type 2 DM-ADRD 
(T2DN) rat models. Genome-wide studies have linked AD/ADRD to SNPs in soluble 
epoxide hydrolase (sEH). This study explored the effects of sEH inhibition with 
TPPU on cerebral vascular function and cognition in AD and DM-ADRD models. 
Chronic TPPU treatment improved cognition in both AD and DM-ADRD rats without 
affecting body weight. In DM-ADRD rats, TPPU reduced plasma glucose and HbA1C 
levels. Transcriptomic analysis of primary cerebral vascular smooth muscle cells 
from AD rats treated with TPPU revealed enhanced pathways related to cell 
contraction, alongside decreased oxidative stress and inflammation. Both AD and 
DM-ADRD rats exhibited impaired myogenic responses and autoregulation in the 
cerebral circulation, which were normalized with chronic sEH inhibition. 
Additionally, TPPU improved acetylcholine-induced vasodilation in the middle 
cerebral arteries (MCA) of DM-ADRD rats. Acute TPPU administration unexpectedly 
caused vasoconstriction in the MCA of DM-ADRD rats at lower doses. In contrast, 
higher doses or longer durations were required to induce effective vasodilation 
at physiological perfusion pressure in both control and ADRD rats. Additionally, 
TPPU decreased reactive oxygen species production in cerebral vessels of AD and 
DM-ADRD rats. These findings provide novel evidence that chronic sEH inhibition 
can reverse cerebrovascular dysfunction and cognitive impairments in AD/ADRD, 
offering a promising avenue for therapeutic development.

INTRODUCTION: The use of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) in degenerative dementia 
(DD) remains uncertain. We aimed to evaluate the association of early AED 
administration with subsequent DD occurrence.
METHODS: Using a large nationwide database, we enrolled patients newly diagnosed 
with epilepsy from 2014 to 2019 (n = 104,225), and using propensity score 
matching, we divided them into treatment (those prescribed AEDs in 2014) and 
control groups. The primary outcome was subsequent DD occurrence in 2019.
RESULTS: Overall, 4489 pairs of patients (2156 women) were matched. The odds 
ratio (treatment/control) for DD occurrence was 0.533 (95% confidence interval: 
0.459-0.617). The DD proportions significantly differed between the treatment 
(340/4489 = 0.076) and control (577/4489 = 0.129) groups.
DISCUSSION: Among patients newly diagnosed with epilepsy, compared to non-use, 
early AED use was associated with a lower occurrence of subsequent DD. Further 
investigations into and optimization of early intervention for epilepsy in DD 
are warranted.
HIGHLIGHTS: Anti-epileptic drug (AED) use before epilepsy diagnosis was linked 
with a lower subsequent degenerative dementia (DD) occurrence.Identifying the 
epileptic phenotype was crucial for justifying early AED use in DD.AED use with 
an epilepsy diagnosis did not pose an additional risk of DD.The potential 
contribution of combination drug therapy to the strategy was noted.

Histone acetyltransferase inhibitors (HATi) are mechanism-based inhibitors that 
show promise in the treatment of several illnesses, including diabetes, 
hyperlipidemia, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease. The work emphasizes the 
significance of HATi as a possible treatment strategy against Candida species 
biofilms. Here, in this study, we found that combining a HATi, anacardic acid 
(AA), and quercetin, a known flavonoid, significantly prevented biofilm 
formation by C. tropicalis. We further show that C. tropicalis exhibited a 
considerable downregulation of drug-resistance gene expression (CDR1 and MDR1) 
when co-administrated. Additionally, in silico studies revealed that the AA 
interacts strongly with a histone acetyltransferase, Rtt109, which may account 
for the observed biofilm inhibitory effect. In conclusion, the study illustrates 
how HATi may be used to potentiate the inhibitory action of phytoactives or 
antifungals against drug-resistant yeast infections.

INTRODUCTION: Antimuscarinics are often the first-choice medications used to 
treat overactive bladder (OAB), a condition that increasingly affects the aging 
population. However, concerns regarding their potential impact on cognitive 
function have persisted for more than a decade.
AREAS COVERED: This review was conducted to update the literature on the 
cognitive safety profiles of various antimuscarinics, integrating findings from 
both recent and earlier studies to present an updated and comprehensive 
analysis. A search of English-language publications, including electronic 
databases and gray literature, focused on the cognitive impacts of 
antimuscarinics, resulting in a review and assessment of diverse studies and 
their associated outcomes.
EXPERT OPINION: Oxybutynin requires caution due to potential adverse effects, 
suggesting a need to consider alternative therapies. Darifenacin, while 
promising in preserving cognitive function, warrants further investigation for 
use in dementia patients. Fesoterodine has shown tolerance without cognitive 
decline in controlled trials. However, Tolterodine and Solifenacin present 
conflicting evidence regarding cognitive impairment and dementia risk, 
respectively, necessitating additional research to ascertain their safety 
profiles. Careful monitoring and treatment of patients taking these medications 
for cognitive impairment are essential. Further research, particularly in 
vulnerable populations, is crucial to establish cognitive safety profiles of 
various antimuscarinics and inform optimal OAB treatment strategies.
