The accumulation of tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles and beta-amyloid 
deposits has been identified as the hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) is a hereditary and neurological condition that can result in 
non-amnestic cognitive decline in less common forms and amnestic memory loss in 
its classic form. While Alzheimer's disease is the most prevalent cause of 
memory loss in middle-aged and older adults, other neurodegenerative and 
cerebrovascular disorders can have an impact on the disease's clinical course. 
Designing multi-target-directed ligands (MTDLs) is a very promising modern 
approach. This methodology was designed specifically for treating disorders with 
complex pathological mechanisms. Among these disorders is Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), which is currently the most prevalent multifactorial neurodegenerative 
illness. Increased amounts of the amyloid βpeptide (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated 
tau protein, together with the loss of neurons and synapses, are linked to 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Additionally, there is evidence that the 
pathophysiology of this condition is influenced by oxidative stress, metal ion 
dysregulation, inflammation, and failure of the cell cycle regulatory system. 
Since Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multi-factor illness, there are many 
attractive targets for the development of anti-AD medications. These molecules 
can be useful in treating AD since they are multi-target-directed. This review 
focuses on the discovery of dual and multi-acting anti-AD drug candidates, 
especially hybrids made by combining chemically active moieties that function 
against distinct targets. The first group of substances consists of 
cholinesterase inhibitors with extra properties or those that function as 
multiple binding site inhibitors. Natural products also provide numerous options 
for slowing the progression and symptoms of many diseases, including Alzheimer's 
Meanwhile, Natural chemical structures with the following characteristics: 
alkaloids, sterols, triterpenes, tannins, flavonoids, polyphenols, and 
antioxidants as well as anti-inflammatory and anti-amyloidogenic properties. We 
provide an overview of Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology and therapy targets 
in this study. We also show several isolated chemicals and medicinal plants that 
are used to treat and prevent the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.

This study explores the complex link between vitamin D and neurological 
illnesses, focusing on how vitamin D affects possible risk factors, therapeutic 
applications, and the trajectory of the disease. An epidemiological study has 
linked vitamin D insufficiency to several neurological conditions, including 
Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and multiple sclerosis. It is 
hypothesized that immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties of vitamin D 
contribute to its neuroprotective effects. Two major mechanisms in dementia 
include neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. Adequate levels of vitamin D 
have been shown in both animal models and human studies to enhance both clinical 
outcomes and the duration of illness in those who have it. Other ways that 
vitamin D contributes to its therapeutic potential include the production of 
neurotrophic factors, control over neurotransmitter synthesis, and preservation 
of the blood-brain barrier. Despite the encouraging outcomes, research is still 
being conducted to determine the optimal dosage and long-term benefits of 
vitamin D supplementation on brain function. In order to furnish precise 
directives and clarify the processes behind the neuroprotective impacts of 
vitamin D, future research must focus on large-scale randomized controlled 
studies. . This study highlights the significance of maintaining adequate levels 
of vitamin D as a modifiable risk factor for neurological disorders. Further 
study is also required to comprehend the possible medical benefits of this 
vitamin fully.

The grey matter of the brain develops and declines in coordinated patterns 
during the lifespan. Such covariation patterns of grey matter structure can be 
quantified as grey matter networks, which can be measured with magnetic 
resonance imaging. In Alzheimer's disease, the global organization of grey 
matter networks becomes more random, which is captured by a decline in the 
small-world coefficient. Such decline in the small-world value has been robustly 
associated with cognitive decline across clinical stages of Alzheimer's disease. 
The biological mechanisms causing this decline in small-world values remain 
unknown. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein biomarkers are available for studying 
diverse pathological mechanisms in humans and can provide insight into decline. 
We investigated the relationships between 10 CSF proteins and small-world 
coefficient in mutation carriers (N = 219) and non-carriers (N = 136) of the 
Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network Observational study. Abnormalities in 
Amyloid beta, Tau, synaptic (Synaptosome associated protein-25, Neurogranin) and 
neuronal calcium-sensor protein (Visinin-like protein-1) preceded loss of 
small-world coefficient by several years, while increased levels in CSF markers 
for inflammation (Chitinase-3-like protein 1) and axonal injury (Neurofilament 
light) co-occurred with decreasing small-world values. This suggests that axonal 
loss and inflammation play a role in structural grey matter network changes.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influencing factors of dysphagia in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) patients.
METHODS: The study evaluated the demographic characteristics, nutritional 
status, social functioning, and swallowing dysfunction of 109 hospitalized AD 
patients.
RESULTS: The sample include 65.1% of female patients, mainly concentrate in >70 
years old (72.5%). The illness duration is mainly 0~5 years (62.4%). After 
adjusting for confounding factors such as gender, poor lifestyle habits, illness 
duration, marital status, route to admission, concomitant medical illness, 
nutritional status, and social functioning, we find that the swallowing function 
in patients with AD is related to route to admission and concomitant medical 
illness (mainly includes: circulatory disease and respiratory disease). Age ≥90 
years old and more concomitant medical illness contribute to a lower swallowing 
dysfunction score in patients with AD (P<0.05).
CONCLUSION: Age and concomitant medical illness are the important influencing 
factors in swallowing dysfunction in patients with AD. Therefore, we believe 
that future research should focus on the treatment and care of patients with 
medical conditions in order to enhance the swallowing function in patients with 
AD.

Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis (ALS) affect millions and present significant challenges in 
healthcare and treatment costs. The debate in the field pivots around two 
hypotheses: synaptic spread and selective vulnerability. Pioneers like Virginia 
Lee and John Trojanowski have been instrumental in identifying key proteins 
(tau, alpha-synuclein, TDP-43) central to these diseases. The synaptic spread 
hypothesis suggests a cell-to-cell propagation of pathogenic proteins across 
neuronal synapses, influencing disease progression, with studies highlighting 
the role of proteins like alpha-synuclein and amyloid-beta in this process. In 
contrast, the selective vulnerability hypothesis proposes inherent 
susceptibility of certain neurons to degeneration due to factors like metabolic 
stress, leading to protein aggregation. Recent advancements in neuroimaging, 
especially PET/MRI hybrid imaging, offer new insights into these mechanisms. 
While both hypotheses offer substantial evidence, their relative contributions 
to neurodegenerative processes remain to be fully elucidated. This uncertainty 
underscores the necessity for continued research, with a focus on these 
hypotheses, to develop effective treatments for these devastating diseases.

Introduction: Pharmacopuncture (PA) is widely used in traditional Korean 
medicine to treat various diseases, including abdominal obesity, nervous system 
diseases, and musculoskeletal disorders. In the present study, we attempted to 
identify the chemical components of SU-Eohyeol PA (SUEHP), comprising extracts 
of eight medicinal herbs and Cervi Parvum Cornu, using gas chromatography-mass 
spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and 
evaluated the in vitro anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities of SUEHP. 
Methods: Volatile components of SUEHP were identified by GC-MS analysis of the 
n-hexane, dichloromethane (DCM), and distilled water-acetonitrile (DW-CAN) 
solvent fractions. LC-MS was performed to identify small metabolites of SUEHP 
using a water-methanol solvent fraction. In vitro anti-inflammatory and 
antioxidant potential of SUEHP was evaluated using cell-free biochemical assays 
and a BV2 microglial cell culture system. Results: GC-MS of SUEHP using the 
n-hexane, DCM, and DW-ACN solvent fractions detected 32 components. The major 
components (>3%) were 9-octadecenamide (25.9%) and eicosane (5.4%) in n-hexane 
fraction, 9-octadecenamide (29.1%) and cis-11-octadecenoic acid (3.1%) in DCM 
fraction, and 9-octadecenamide (31.1%) and 9-octadecenoic acid (17.9%) in DW-CAN 
fraction. LC-MS of SUEHP using a water-methanol solvent fraction detected 36 
primary metabolites, including (a)symmetric dimethylarginine, L-pyroglutamic 
acid, n,n-dimethylglycine, n-acetyl-L-aspartic acid, and amino acids. Enrichment 
analysis and subsequent network analysis of the primary metabolites suggested 
their association with neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease 
and schizophrenia. Cell-free biochemical assays and molecular signaling studies 
of lipopolysaccharide-stimulated BV2 murine microglial cells demonstrated the 
anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities of SUEHP. Conclusion: The present 
study identified the biochemically active components of SUEHP and suggested 
their therapeutic potential against diseases related to inflammatory and 
oxidative stress.

INTRODUCTION: Assessing treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD) relies on 
reliable tools for measuring AD progression. In this analysis, we evaluate the 
sensitivity of clinical progression measures in AD within randomized controlled 
trials (RCTs) with confirmed positive amyloid (Aβ+) status prior to trial 
enrollment.
METHODS: Excluding trials targeting non-cognitive symptoms, we conducted 
meta-analyses on progression measures from 25 selected RCTs using R version 
4.2.0, along with the metafor and emmeans libraries.
RESULTS: The Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) demonstrated the greatest 
sensitivity over 12 weeks. Other cognitive measures demonstrated lower 
sensitivity. The integrated Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (iADRS) and 
Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) seemed more effective than their 
individual cognitive components. Neuropsychiatric measures were the least 
sensitive in measuring progression.
DISCUSSION: Functional measures generally outperformed other measure categories. 
Purely cognitive domain-based measures were suboptimal for tracking early AD 
progression. Ideally, future measures should incorporate both cognitive and 
functional components to enhance sensitivity.
HIGHLIGHTS: Concerns remain regarding the limitations of current outcome 
measures used in AD clinical trials, particularly their sensitivity in the early 
and preclinical stages of the disease, which hampers their reliability as 
indicators of AD progression. The Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) 
demonstrated the most substantial weighted mean change over 12 weeks, followed 
by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Functional measures outperformed 
other measure categories. Composite scores of integrated Alzheimer's Disease 
Rating Scale and Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes are more sensitive to 
change than their individual cognitive components, possibly driven by the 
functional components of the score. Neuropsychiatric measures analyzed in this 
study appeared to be the least sensitive in measuring progression.

BACKGROUND: Metabolic dysregulation is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases, 
including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). 
Although metabolic dysregulation is a common link between these two tauopathies, 
a comprehensive brain metabolic comparison of the diseases has not yet been 
performed.
METHODS: We analyzed 342 postmortem brain samples from the Mayo Clinic Brain 
Bank and examined 658 metabolites in the cerebellar cortex and the temporal 
cortex between the two tauopathies.
RESULTS: Our findings indicate that both diseases display oxidative stress 
associated with lipid metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction linked to lysine 
metabolism, and an indication of tau-induced polyamine stress response. However, 
specific to AD, we detected glutathione-related neuroinflammation, deregulations 
of enzymes tied to purines, and cognitive deficits associated with vitamin B.
DISCUSSION: Our findings underscore vast alterations in the brain's metabolome, 
illuminating shared neurodegenerative pathways and disease-specific traits in AD 
and PSP.
HIGHLIGHTS: First high-throughput metabolic comparison of Alzheimer's diesease 
(AD) versus progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) in brain tissue. Cerebellar 
cortex (CER) shows substantial AD-related metabolic changes, despite limited 
proteinopathy. AD impacts both CER and temporal cortex (TCX); PSP's changes are 
primarily in CER. AD and PSP share metabolic alterations despite major 
pathological differences.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative 
disease. Three new drugs for AD based on monoclonal antibodies against the 
amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) have recently been approved because they favor the 
reduction of the burden of senile plaque in the AD patient's brain. Nonetheless, 
both drugs have very limited applicability and benefits and show several side 
effects. These limitations invite us to find alternative strategies for treating 
patients with AD. Here, we explored whether tissue-nonspecific alkaline 
phosphatase (TNAP), an ectoenzyme upregulated in the brain of AD patients and 
whose inhibition has beneficial effects on tau-induced pathology, is also 
efficient in reducing senile plaque burden.
METHODS: To evaluate whether TNAP may reduce cerebral senile plaque loading and 
Aβ-related toxicity, we use both pharmacological and genetic approaches. We 
analyze postmortem samples from human AD patients, APP/PS1 mice (a mouse model 
that mimics amyloid pathology observed in AD patients) treated or not with TNAP 
inhibitors, and the newly generated transgenic mouse line, TNAP-deficient 
APP/PS1 mice.
RESULTS: For the first time, we describe that genetic or pharmacological 
blockade of TNAP effectively reduces senile plaque burden by promoting its 
clearance, which leads to amelioration of cognitive impairment caused by 
Aβ-induced toxicity. These beneficial effects of TNAP inhibition occur 
concomitantly with higher microglial recruitment toward the senile plaque and 
increased microglial phagocytic capacity of Aβ by a mechanism involving 
metalloprotease-depending osteopontin processing. In addition, we also found 
that TNAP blockade favors LRP1-mediated transport of Aβ through the BBB.
CONCLUSIONS: Here, we have shown that TNAP inhibition effectively reduces brain 
senile plaque burden and associated behavioral defects. Furthermore, given that 
we had previously reported that TNAP blockade also ameliorates Tau-induced 
neurotoxicity and increases lifespan of P301S tauopathy mouse model, we can 
state that TNAP blockade may be a novel and efficient therapy for treating 
patients with AD.

BACKGROUND: The risk factors for contralateral hip refracture after primary hip 
fracture are not fully understood; therefore, this study compared the clinical 
characteristics of patients with first and second hip fractures and explored and 
analyzed the risk factors for contralateral refracture after hip fracture in 
elderly individuals to provide a reference for the clinical prevention of 
postoperative refracture of hip fracture in elderly individuals.
METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on 458 elderly patients with hip 
fractures who underwent surgical treatment and were discharged from our hospital 
from March 2016 to March 2019. The clinical data of the patients were analyzed 
retrospectively. Patients were divided into a case group (postoperative 
refracture) and a control group (no postoperative refracture) based on whether 
they experienced refracture within five years after surgery. The clinical data 
of the two groups were compared and analyzed via univariate and multivariate 
logistic regression analyses and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
regression analysis to identify the risk factors for refractures after hip 
fracture surgery in elderly patients.
RESULTS: Sixty-one patients experienced refracture, with an incidence rate of 
13.3%. Age ≥ 80.5 years, female sex, poor knee joint function, FRAX 
score ≥ 15.5, anemia, visual impairment, osteoporosis, and Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) were identified as risk factors for refracture after hip fracture surgery 
in elderly individuals (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Elderly patients with hip fractures are susceptible to refracture 
after surgery because of factors such as advanced age, female sex, high FRAX 
score, poor knee joint function, anemia, osteoporosis, visual impairment, and 
AD. Targeted interventions should be implemented based on the above risk 
factors.

Alzheimer's dementia (AD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disease often 
accompanied by neuropsychiatric symptoms that profoundly impact both patients 
and caregivers. Agitation is among the most prevalent and distressing of these 
symptoms and often requires treatment. Appropriate therapeutic interventions 
depend on understanding the biological basis of agitation and how it may be 
affected by treatment. This narrative review discusses a proposed 
pathophysiology of agitation in Alzheimer's dementia based on convergent 
evidence across research approaches. Available data indicate that agitation in 
Alzheimer's dementia is associated with an imbalance of activity between key 
prefrontal and subcortical brain regions. The monoamine neurotransmitter systems 
serve as key modulators of activity within these brain regions and circuits and 
are rendered abnormal in AD. Patients with AD who exhibited agitation symptoms 
during life have alterations in neurotransmitter nuclei and related systems when 
the brain is examined at autopsy. The authors present a model of agitation in 
Alzheimer's dementia in which noradrenergic hyperactivity along with 
serotonergic deficits and dysregulated striatal dopamine release contribute to 
agitated and aggressive behaviors.

Preclinical methods are needed for screening potential Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
therapeutics that recapitulate phenotypes found in the Mild Cognitive Impairment 
(MCI) stage or even before this stage of the disease. This would require a 
phenotypic system that reproduces cognitive deficits without significant 
neuronal cell death to mimic the clinical manifestations of AD during these 
stages. Long-term potentiation (LTP), which is a correlate of learning and 
memory, was induced in mature human iPSC-derived cortical neurons cultured on 
microelectrode arrays utilizing circuit patterns connecting two adjacent 
electrodes. We demonstrated an LTP system that modeled the MCI and pre-MCI 
stages of Alzheimer's and validated this functional system utilizing four AD 
therapeutics, which was also verified utilizing patch-clamp electrophysiology. 
LTP was induced by tetanic electrical stimulation, and LTP maintenance was 
significantly reduced in the presence of Amyloid-Beta 42 (Aβ42) oligomers 
compared to the controls, however, co-treatment with AD therapeutics (Donepezil, 
Memantine, Rolipram and Saracatinib) corrected Aβ42-induced LTP impairment. The 
results illustrate the utility of the system as a validated platform to model 
MCI AD pathology, and potentially for the pre-MCI phase before significant 
neuronal death. This system also has the potential to become an ideal platform 
for high-content therapeutic screening for other neurodegenerative diseases.

The perturbed structure and function of mitochondria-associated membranes (MAM), 
instead of the amyloid cascade, have been gradually proposed to play a basic 
role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Notably, autophagy 
inhibition is one of the main mechanisms of MAM dysfunction and plays an 
important role in neuronal injury. However, the upstream molecular mechanism 
underlying the MAM dysfunctions remains elusive. Here, we defined an unexpected 
and critical role of connexin43 (Cx43) in regulating the MAM structure. The 
expression levels of Cx43 and mitofusin-2 (MFN2, the MAM biomarker) increase 
significantly in 9-month-old APPswe/PS1dE9 double-transgenic AD model mice, and 
there is an obvious colocalization relationship. Moreover, both AD mice and 
cells lacking Cx43 exhibit an evident reduction in the MAM contact sites, which 
subsequently promotes the conversion from microtubule-associated protein 1 
light-chain 3B I (LC3B-I) to LC3B-II via inhibition mTOR-dependent pathway and 
then initiates the generation of autophagosomes. Autophagosome formation 
ultimately promotes β-amyloid (Aβ) clearance and attenuates Aβ-associated 
pathological changes in AD, mainly including astrogliosis and neuronal 
apoptosis. Our findings not only reveal a previously unrecognized effect of Cx43 
on MAM upregulation but also highlight the major player of MAM-induced autophagy 
inhibition in Cx43-facilitated AD pathogenesis, providing a novel insight into 
the alternative therapeutic strategies for the early treatment of AD.

BackgroundEndoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced neurodegeneration has been 
considered an underlying cause of Alzheimer disease (AD). Here, we investigated 
the beneficial effects of licochalcone A (Lico A), a valuable flavonoid of the 
root of the Glycyrrhiza species, against cognitive impairment in AD by 
regulating ER stress.MethodsThe triple transgenic mouse AD models were used and 
were administrated 5 or 15 mg/kg Lico A. Cognitive deficits, Aβ deposition, ER 
stress, and neuronal apoptosis were determined using Morris Water Maze test, 
probe trial, immunofluorescence staining, western blotting, and TUNEL staining. 
To investigate the mechanisms of how Lico A exerts anti-AD effects, primary 
hippocampal neurons were isolated from the AD model mice and treated with Lico 
A, salubrinal, an eIF2α phosphatase inhibitor, ML385, a Nrf2 inhibitor, or 
LY294002, an inhibitor of PI3K. Pharmacokinetics and toxicity of Lico A 
(15 mg/kg) in AD mice were evaluated.ResultsWe found that Lico A improved 
cognitive impairment, decreased Aβ plaques, inhibited ER stress, and reduced 
neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampus and cortex of AD mice. Treatment with Lico 
A in primary hippocampal neurons exerted the same effects as it did in vivo. 
Additionally, cotreatment with ML385 or LY294002 significantly impeded the 
effects of Lico A against ER stress. Moreover, 15 mg/kg Lico A had a good 
bioavailability and low toxicity in AD mice.ConclusionOur results demonstrated 
that Lico A ameliorates ER stress-induced neuronal apoptosis by inhibiting 
PERK/eIF2α/ATF4/CHOP signaling, suggesting the therapeutic potential of Lico A 
in AD treatment.

BACKGROUND: Plasma phospho-tau 217 (pTau217) assays can accurately detect 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, but clinical application is limited by the 
need for specialised equipment. This study tests the performance of a plasma 
pTau217 assay performed on the Lumipulse-G® platform, that is in widespread 
clinical use, for selecting patients for therapy based on β-amyloid (Aβ) status 
and tau staging.
METHODS: Participants included 388 individuals with 18F-NAV4694 Aβ-PET and 
18F-MK6240 tau-PET. Association of pTau217 with PET was examined using 
Spearman's correlation. Discriminative performance for Aβ and tau PET status as 
well as tau staging was assessed using Receiver Operating Characteristic 
analysis.
FINDINGS: Plasma pTau217 had a high correlation with both Aβ Centiloid 
(r = 0.76) and tau SUVRmeta-temporal (r = 0.78). Area under curve (AUC) was 0.93 
for Aβ- vs Aβ+ and 0.94 for tau- vs tau+. Applying one threshold (Youden's 
index), pTau217 was 87% accurate in classification of participants to Aβ- vs 
Aβ+. Applying two thresholds to classify participants into Low, Indeterminate, 
and High zones, 17.8% had Indeterminate results and among Low/High zone 
participants, 92% were correctly classified as Aβ- or Aβ+. The assay accurately 
discriminated moderate/high neocortical tau from no tau or tau limited to 
mesial-temporal lobe (AUC 0.97) and high neocortical tau from all others (AUC 
0.94).
INTERPRETATION: Plasma pTau217, measured by the widely-available, 
fully-automated Lumipulse®, was a strong predictor of both Aβ and tau PET status 
and demonstrated strong predictive power in identifying individuals likely to 
benefit the most from anti-Aβ treatments.

Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) 
and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) positively affect cognitive function. However, it 
remains unclear whether the improvement is related to the alterations of gut 
microbiota and inflammation and the impact of the combined intervention. In this 
study, we hypothesized that the supplementation of MCTs combined with DHA could 
modulate gut microbiota, inflammation, and improve cognitive function in 
APPswe/PS1De9 model mice and senescence-accelerated mouse-prone-8, which are two 
different mouse models used in neurodegeneration research. The mice were divided 
into four groups: Control group, MCTs group, DHA group, and MCTs + DHA group. 
The study assessed cognitive function, inflammatory cytokines, and gut 
microbiota composition. The results showed that supplementation of MCTs + DHA 
improved spatial learning ability, memory capacity, exploratory behavior; 
decreased the relative abundance of Proteobacteria; reduced the ratio of 
Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes; decreased the concentrations of serum interleukin 
(IL)-2, IL-6, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, while 
increasing the concentration of IL-10. Furthermore, supplementation with MCTs + 
DHA exhibited significantly superior effects compared to MCTs or DHA alone in 
reducing inflammation, optimizing gut microbiota composition, and improving 
cognitive function. In conclusion, supplementation with MCTs + DHA improved 
cognition function, accompanied with favorable alterations in gut microbiota and 
inflammation in APPswe/PS1De9 and senescence-accelerated mouse-prone-8 mice.

BACKGROUND: Noise pollution pervades daily working and living environment, 
becoming a serious public health problem. In addition to causing auditory 
impairment, noise independently contributes to cognitive decline as a risk 
factor. Though neuroinflammation plays an important role in noise-induced 
cognitive deficits, the mechanisms underlying noise-induced neuroinflammation in 
the hippocampus are still poorly understood. Glial hyperactivation of the NLRP3 
inflammasome contributes to various neurodegenerative diseases, including 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). However, whether the 
NLRP3 inflammasome plays a role in noise-induced cognitive impairment remains to 
be further investigated.
METHODS: Adult male Wistar rats were exposed to 100 dB white noise (4 h/day) for 
30 days with or without injection of the NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 (10 mg/kg/day). 
The Morris water maze (MWM) test and the open field test (OFT) were performed to 
evaluate learning and memory ability of rats. HE staining was used to explore 
hippocampal pathological changes, while immunohistochemical staining was 
employed to evaluate the number and morphology of microglia and astrocytes. The 
mRNA levels of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the hippocampus were examined by 
Real-time PCR. The protein levels of NLRP3 inflammasome, inflammatory cytokines, 
p-Tau-S396, and amyloid-β (Aβ) 42 in the hippocampus were examined by Western 
blot. Immunofluorescence was used to observe the distribution of NLRP3 in glial 
cells and neurons, and the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome.
RESULTS: We found that noise exposure induced learning and memory impairment in 
rats, mainly related to the activation of microglia and astrocytes in 
hippocampus region. Noise exposure increased the protein levels of p-Tau-S396, 
Aβ42, ionized calcium binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba-1), glial fibrillary 
acidic protein (GFAP), interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-18, and tumor necrosis factor-α 
(TNF-α) in hippocampus. Furthermore, the hippocampus of noise-exposed rats 
showed elevated protein levels of NLRP3, ASC and cleaved caspase-1. The 
co-labeled immunofluorescence levels of Iba-1 or GFAP with NLRP3 significantly 
increased in the dentate gyrus (DG) region of the hippocampus. NLRP3 inhibitor 
MCC950 intervention reversed chronic noise-induced activation of NLRP3 
inflammasome, AD-like pathologies and impairment of learning and memory in rats.
CONCLUSIONS: The NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated neuroinflammation played an 
essential role in chronic noise-induced cognitive dysfunction. These results 
provide novel strategies for the prevention and treatment of cognitive deficits 
caused by chronic noise.

OBJECTIVES: Neurodegenerative diseases are defined by specific protein 
accumulation and anatomic vulnerability leading to neuronal loss. Some studies 
have shown that lutein may have an effect on neurodegenerative diseases. As most 
of the neurodegenerative diseases don't have certain cure and therapies focus on 
symptom control, Lutein may be a complementary treatment. Due to controversies 
in studies investigating lutein effect on neurodegenerative diseases, we decided 
to perform a systematic review on these studies.
METHODS: A systematic search was carried out in the available databases. We used 
all MeSH terms and relevant keywords. Studies that reported relationship between 
lutein and any neurodegenerative disease were included.
RESULTS: We found 278 studies. After removing duplicates, screening by titles 
and abstracts and excluding irrelevant papers, 17 articles were included in this 
study. Fourteen studies investigated Alzheimer's disease, 2 studies Parkinson's 
disease and 1 study Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. 1/17 study found that high 
serum levels of lutein at baseline were associated with a lower risk of AD 
mortality and lutein effect on lipid profile have been investigated in 2/17 
studies. Also, 1/17 study has been shown that high intake of lutein may reduce 
the risk of ALS progression.
CONCLUSIONS: 4/17 studies confirm that lutein can improve cognitive function. 
8/17 studies demonstrate a reduction in the progression of AD, and 2/17 studies 
indicate an improvement in lipid profiles. However, some studies did not find 
any significant associations. Additionally, there is a limited number of studies 
investigating the effects of lutein on other neurodegenerative diseases.

Several studies have been done to investigate the role of hearing loss (HL) in 
cognitive decline. A co-existence of these two conditions has been identified. 
Recently, thanks to the use of functional MRI and EEG it has been shown that 
untreated HL can expose patients with cognitive decline to a higher risk of 
developing Alzheimer Disease (AD). This chapter will discuss the difference 
between central and peripheral HL, the link between HL and cognition and the 
relationship between HL and AD. At the end of the chapter the available 
technologies to treat HL will be discussed as well as their impact on memory and 
cognition.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a progressive neurodegenerative disease with no 
cure. Treatment of AD relies on administering drugs that only subside the 
symptoms. In recent studies, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-exosomes have been 
marked to possess therapeutic potential for treating AD. This study aims to 
systematically review and analyse findings that focus on the isolation, 
characterisation, and sources of MSC-derived exosomes used to unravel the 
therapeutic potential of these exosomes targeting AD using in vitro and in vivo 
models. It is hypothesised that MSC-exosomes exhibit high therapeutic potential 
for AD treatment by exerting various modes of action. PubMed, Scopus, and 
Medline were used to find relevant published works from January 2016 until 
December 2020, using assigned keywords including "Alzheimer's disease", 
"secretome", and "exosomes". Only research articles meeting the predefined 
inclusion/exclusion criteria were selected and analysed. The risk of bias was 
assessed using the Office of Health Assessment and Translation tool (OHAT). A 
total of 17 eligible in vivo and in vitro studies were included in this review. 
Bone marrow-derived stem cells (BMSCs) were the most used source for exosome 
isolation, even though studies on exosomes from adipose-derived stem cells 
(ADSCs) and human umbilical cord stem cells (HUCSCs) provide more information on 
the characteristics. When the risk of bias was assessed, the studies presented 
various levels of biases. Notably, the in vitro and in vivo studies revealed 
neuroprotective properties of MSC-exosomes through different modes of action to 
alleviate AD pathology. Our review discovered that most MSC exosomes could 
degrade Aβ plaques, enhance neurogenesis, extenuate neuroinflammatory response 
through microglial activation, regulate apoptosis and reduce oxidative stress. 
Delivery of exosomal micro-RNAs was also found to reduce neuroinflammation. 
Findings from this review provided convincing systematic evidence highlighting 
the therapeutic properties of MSC-derived exosomes as a prospective source for 
cell-free (acellular) therapy in treating AD.

Gene editing in human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells with programmable 
nucleases facilitates reliable disease models, but methods using double-strand 
break repair often produce random on-target by-products. Prime editing (PE) 
combines Cas9 nickase with reverse transcriptase and PE guide RNA (pegRNA) 
encoding a repair template to reduce by-products. We implemented a 
GMP-compatible protocol for transfecting Cas9- or PE-2A-mCherry plasmids to 
track and fractionate human iPS cells based on PE expression level. We compared 
the editing outcomes of Cas9- and PE-based methods in a GFP-to-BFP conversion 
assay at the HEK3 benchmark locus and at the APOE Alzheimer's risk locus, 
revealing superior precision of PE at high expression levels. Moreover, sorting 
cells for PE expression level influenced allelic editing outcomes at the target 
loci. We expect that our findings will aid in the creation of gene-edited human 
iPS cells with intentional heterozygous and homozygous genotypes.

Ozone: complicated effects in central nervous system diseases.

University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China.

Oxidative stress is closely related to various diseases. Ozone can produce redox 
reactions through its unique response. As a source of the oxidative stress 
response, the strong oxidizing nature of ozone can cause severe damage to the 
body. On the other hand, low ozone concentrations can activate various 
mechanisms to combat oxidative stress and achieve therapeutic effects. Some 
animal experiments and clinical studies have revealed the potential medical 
value of ozone, indicating that ozone is not just a toxic gas. By reviewing the 
mechanism of ozone and its therapeutic value in treating central nervous system 
diseases (especially ischemic stroke and Alzheimer's disease) and the toxic 
effects of ozone, we find that ozone inhalation and a lack of antioxidants or 
excessive exposure lead to harmful impacts. However, with adequate antioxidants, 
ozone can transmit oxidative stress signals, reduce inflammation, reduce amyloid 
β peptide levels, and improve tissue oxygenation. Similar mechanisms to those of 
possible new drugs for treating ischemic stroke and Alzheimer's disease indicate 
the potential of ozone. Nevertheless, limited research has restricted the 
application of ozone. More studies are needed to reveal the exact dose-effect 
relationship and healing effect of ozone.

Neuronal connectivity is essential for adaptive brain responses and can be 
modulated by dendritic spine plasticity and the intrinsic excitability of 
individual neurons. Dysregulation of these processes can lead to aberrant 
neuronal activity, which has been associated with numerous neurological 
disorders including autism, epilepsy, and Alzheimer's disease. Nonetheless, the 
molecular mechanisms underlying abnormal neuronal connectivity remain unclear. 
We previously found that the serine/threonine kinase Microtubule Affinity 
Regulating Kinase 2 (MARK2), also known as Partitioning Defective 1b (Par1b), is 
important for the formation of dendritic spines in vitro. However, despite its 
genetic association with several neurological disorders, the in vivo impact of 
MARK2 on neuronal connectivity and cognitive functions remains unclear. Here, we 
demonstrate that the loss of MARK2 in vivo results in changes to dendritic spine 
morphology, which in turn leads to a decrease in excitatory synaptic 
transmission. Additionally, the loss of MARK2 produces substantial impairments 
in learning and memory, reduced anxiety, and defective social behavior. Notably, 
MARK2 deficiency results in heightened seizure susceptibility. Consistent with 
this observation, electrophysiological analysis of hippocampal slices indicates 
underlying neuronal hyperexcitability in MARK2-deficient neurons. Finally, 
RNAseq analysis reveals transcriptional changes in genes regulating synaptic 
transmission and ion homeostasis. These results underscore the in vivo role of 
MARK2 in governing synaptic connectivity, neuronal excitability, and cognitive 
functions.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are multifactorial, 
chronic diseases involving neurodegeneration. According to recent studies, it is 
hypothesized that the intraneuronal and postsynaptic accumulation of misfolded 
proteins such as α-synuclein (α-syn) and tau, responsible for Lewy bodies (LB) 
and tangles, respectively, disrupts neuron functions. Considering the 
co-occurrence of α-syn and tau inclusions in the brains of patients afflicted 
with subtypes of dementia and LB disorders, the discovery and development of 
small molecules for the inhibition of α-syn and tau aggregation can be a 
potentially effective strategy to delay neurodegeneration. Urea is a chaotropic 
agent that alters protein solubilization and hydrophobic interactions and 
inhibits protein aggregation and precipitation. The presence of three hetero 
atoms (O/S and N) in proximity can coordinate with neutral, mono, or dianionic 
groups to form stable complexes in the biological system. Therefore, in this 
study, we evaluated urea and thiourea linkers with various substitutions on 
either side of the carbamide or thiocarbamide functionality to compare the 
aggregation inhibition of α-syn and tau. A thioflavin-T (ThT) fluorescence assay 
was used to evaluate the level of fibril formation and monitor the 
anti-aggregation effect of the different compounds. We opted for transmission 
electron microscopy (TEM) as a direct means to confirm the anti-fibrillar 
effect. The oligomer formation was monitored via the photoinduced cross-linking 
of unmodified proteins (PICUP). The anti-inclusion and anti-seeding activities 
of the best compounds were evaluated using M17D intracellular inclusion and 
biosensor cell-based assays, respectively. Disaggregation experiments were 
performed with amyloid plaques extracted from AD brains. The analogues with 
indole, benzothiazole, or N,N-dimethylphenyl on one side with halo-substituted 
aromatic moieties had shown less than 15% cutoff fluorescence obtained with the 
ThT assay. Our lead molecules 6T and 14T reduced α-syn oligomerization 
dose-dependently based on the PICUP assays but failed at inhibiting tau oligomer 
formation. The anti-inclusion effect of our lead compounds was confirmed using 
the M17D neuroblastoma cell model. Compounds 6T and 14T exhibited an 
anti-seeding effect on tau using biosensor cells. In contrast to the control, 
disaggregation experiments showed fewer Aβ plaques with our lead molecules 
(compounds 6T and 14T). Pharmacokinetics (PK) mice studies demonstrated that 
these two thiourea-based small molecules have the potential to cross the 
blood-brain barrier in rodents. Urea and thiourea linkers could be further 
improved for their PK parameters and studied for the anti-inclusion, 
anti-seeding, and disaggregation effects using transgenic mice models of 
neurodegenerative diseases.

Medical University, Volgograd, Russia.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of monocarbonyl analogues of curcumin on 
changes in the processes of mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis in the 
cerebral cortex of rats with experimental Alzheimer's disease.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Alzheimer's disease was modeled in Wistar rats of both 
sexes by injection of β-amyloid fragments into the hippocampus of the animal. 
Compounds (1E, 4E)-1.5-bis (3.4.5-trimethoxyphenyl) penta-1.4-diene-3-one 
(AZBAX4 code) and (1E, 4E)-1.5-bis (2.4.6-trimethoxyphenyl) 
penta-1.4-diene-3-one (AZBAX6 code) at a dose of 20 mg/ kg (orally) and the 
reference drug donepezil at a dose of 50 mg/kg (orally) were administered for 30 
days, after which changes in the activity of succinate dehydrogenase, 
cytochrome-c oxidase and citrate synthase as enzymatic biomarkers of 
mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy, respectively, were evaluated in the 
mitochondrial fraction of the cerebral cortex.
RESULTS: The administration of AZBAX4 and AZBAX6 compounds led to an increase in 
the activity of succinate dehydrogenase; cytochrome-c oxidase, as well as 
citrate synthase in relation to the same indicators of the group of untreated 
animals. The use of the analyzed compounds was equally effective in both female 
and male rats. At the same time, it should be noted that the analyzed compounds 
significantly exceeded the activity level of the reference donepezil.
CONCLUSION: AZBAX4 and AZBAX6 contribute to an increase in the intensity of 
mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy reactions in the cerebral cortex of rats 
with Alzheimer's disease, which makes them potentially effective neuroprotective 
compounds.

Recent advances in research on extracellular vesicles have significantly 
enhanced their potential as therapeutic agents for neurological diseases. Owing 
to their therapeutic properties and ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, 
extracellular vesicles are recognized as promising drug delivery vehicles for 
various neurological conditions, including ischemic stroke, traumatic brain 
injury, neurodegenerative diseases, glioma, and psychosis. However, the clinical 
application of natural extracellular vesicles is hindered by their limited 
targeting ability and short clearance from the body. To address these 
limitations, multiple engineering strategies have been developed to enhance the 
targeting capabilities of extracellular vesicles, thereby enabling the delivery 
of therapeutic contents to specific tissues or cells. Therefore, this review 
aims to highlight the latest advancements in natural and targeting-engineered 
extracellular vesicles, exploring their applications in treating traumatic brain 
injury, ischemic stroke, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis, glioma, and psychosis. Additionally, we summarized recent 
clinical trials involving extracellular vesicles and discussed the challenges 
and future prospects of using targeting-engineered extracellular vesicles for 
drug delivery in treating neurological diseases. This review offers new insights 
for developing highly targeted therapies in this field.

Age-related macular degeneration is a serious neurodegenerative disease of the 
retina that significantly impacts vision. Unfortunately, the specific 
pathogenesis remains unclear, and effective early treatment options are 
consequently lacking. The microbiome is defined as a large ecosystem of 
microorganisms living within and coexisting with a host. The intestinal 
microbiome undergoes dynamic changes owing to age, diet, genetics, and other 
factors. Such dysregulation of the intestinal flora can disrupt the 
microecological balance, resulting in immunological and metabolic dysfunction in 
the host, and affecting the development of many diseases. In recent decades, 
significant evidence has indicated that the intestinal flora also influences 
systems outside of the digestive tract, including the brain. Indeed, several 
studies have demonstrated the critical role of the gut-brain axis in the 
development of brain neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease 
and Parkinson's disease. Similarly, the role of the "gut-eye axis" has been 
confirmed to play a role in the pathogenesis of many ocular disorders. Moreover, 
age-related macular degeneration and many brain neurodegenerative diseases have 
been shown to share several risk factors and to exhibit comparable etiologies. 
As such, the intestinal flora may play an important role in age-related macular 
degeneration. Given the above context, the present review aims to clarify the 
gut-brain and gut-eye connections, assess the effect of intestinal flora and 
metabolites on age-related macular degeneration, and identify potential 
diagnostic markers and therapeutic strategies. Currently, direct research on the 
role of intestinal flora in age-related macular degeneration is still relatively 
limited, while studies focusing solely on intestinal flora are insufficient to 
fully elucidate its functional role in age-related macular degeneration. 
Organ-on-a-chip technology has shown promise in clarifying the gut-eye 
interactions, while integrating analysis of the intestinal flora with research 
on metabolites through metabolomics and other techniques is crucial for 
understanding their potential mechanisms.

INTRODUCTION: Erlotinib is an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor 
that is approved by the FDA to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Several 
membrane receptors, including EGFR, interact with amyloid β (Aβ), raising the 
possibility that erlotinib could have therapeutic effects on Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). However, the effects of erlotinib on Aβ/tau-related pathology and 
cognitive function in mouse models of AD and its mechanisms of action have not 
been examined in detail.
METHODS: To investigate the effects of erlotinib on cognitive function and AD 
pathology, 3 to 6-month-old PS19 mice and 3 to 3.5-month-old 5xFAD mice and WT 
mice were injected with vehicle (5% DMSO + 10% PEG + 20% Tween80 + 65% D.W.) or 
erlotinib (20 mg/kg, i.p.) daily for 14 or 21 days. Then, behavioral tests, 
Golgi staining, immunofluorescence staining, western blotting ELISA, and 
real-time PCR were conducted.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We found that erlotinib significantly enhanced 
short-term spatial memory and dendritic spine formation in 6-month-old P301S tau 
transgenic (PS19) mice. Importantly, erlotinib administration reduced tau 
phosphorylation at Ser202/Thr205 (AT8) and Thr231 (AT180) and further 
aggregation of tau into paired helical fragments (PHFs) and neurofibrillary 
tangles (NFTs) in 3-month-old and/or 6-month-old PS19 mice by suppressing the 
expression of the tau kinase DYRK1A. Moreover, erlotinib treatment decreased 
astrogliosis in 6-month-old PS19 mice and reduced proinflammatory responses in 
primary astrocytes (PACs) from PS19 mice. In 3- to 3.5-month-old 5xFAD mice, 
erlotinib treatment improved short-term spatial memory and hippocampal dendritic 
spine number and diminished Aβ plaque deposition and tau hyperphosphorylation. 
Furthermore, erlotinib-treated 5xFAD mice exhibited significant downregulation 
of astrocyte activation, and treating PACs from 5xFAD mice with erlotinib 
markedly reduced cxcl10 (reactive astrocyte marker) and gbp2 (A1 astrocyte 
marker) mRNA levels and proinflammatory cytokine mRNA and protein levels. Taken 
together, our results suggest that erlotinib regulates tau/Aβ-induced AD 
pathology, cognitive function, and Aβ/tau-evoked astrogliosis and therefore 
could be a potent therapeutic drug for ameliorating AD symptoms.

BACKGROUND: Loneliness has been associated with several consequences, including 
increased risk of developing Alzheimer disease (AD). Loneliness may arise during 
the preclinical phase of AD, but little is known about the relationship between 
loneliness and amyloid accumulation consistent with preclinical AD. Therefore, 
the purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between amyloid 
accumulation and subjective experiences of loneliness among cognitively normal 
older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: A global Clinical Dementia Rating ® Scale score of 0 was required for 
enrollment. Cortical amyloid burden was measured using [11C] Pittsburgh compound 
B or [18F]-Florbetapir PET tracers. Centiloids were used to synchronize 
measures. Demographic characteristics and measures of loneliness, anxiety, and 
depression were collected via self-report. Multiple linear regression was used 
to examine the relationship between loneliness and amyloid accumulation.
RESULTS: The 108 participants had a mean age of 75.0 and an average amyloid 
accumulation of 22.2 ± 31.9. Mean UCLA Loneliness Scale scores were 31.6 ± 10.8. 
A significant positive association was detected between loneliness and amyloid 
accumulation (β = 0.064, SE = 0.027, 95% CI = [0.011, 0.118], p = 0.018).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the relationship between higher amyloid 
accumulation and greater loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic. Healthcare 
professionals should include routine assessments for characteristics of 
loneliness in routine clinical evaluations and integrate loneliness reduction 
and prevention treatments among older adults experiencing loneliness. Additional 
research is needed with a larger, more diverse sample to examine the 
relationship between loneliness and amyloid accumulation.

BACKGROUND: Our previously randomized controlled trial (RCT) showed daily oral 
folic acid (FA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and their combined treatment for 6 
months could significantly improve cognitive function in mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) individuals.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate whether this benefit seen in the 
treatment group would sustain after stopping intervention when patients returned 
to a real-world.
METHODS: RCT (ChiCTR-IOR-16008351) was conducted in Tianjin, China. 160 MCI 
elders aged ≥60 years were randomly divided into four groups: FA + DHA, FA, DHA, 
and control. 138 MCI elders who completed the 6-month interventional trial 
underwent another 6-month follow-up without receiving nutritional therapy. 
Cognitive performance was measured at 6 and 12 months. Blood amyloid-β peptide 
(Aβ) and homocysteine (Hcy) related biomarkers were measured at baseline and 6 
months.
RESULTS: In comparison to the end of nutritional therapy, all intervention 
groups had considerably lower full-scale IQ, arithmetic, and image completion 
scores during the follow-up period, while the combined intervention and DHA 
groups had significantly lower picture arrangement scores. Furthermore, after 
6-month treatment with FA and FA + DHA, plasma Aβ40, Aβ42, and Hcy levels were 
significantly decreased. However, these biomarker levels at the start of 
follow-up were positively correlated with the degree of cognitive function 
change during follow-up period.
CONCLUSIONS: FA and DHA supplementation enhance cognitive performance in MCI 
elderly following a six-month intervention by reducing Hcy or Aβ levels. 
However, their effects on improving cognitive decline are likely to diminish 
when the intervention is discontinued.

BACKGROUND: Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a language-based dementia, 
causing progressive decline of language functions. Transcranial direct current 
stimulation (tDCS) can augment effects of speech-and language therapy (SLT). 
However, this has not been investigated in bilingual patients with PPA.
OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the case of Mr. G., a French (native language, L1)/Dutch 
(second language, L2)-speaking 59-year-old male, with logopenic PPA, associated 
with Alzheimer's disease pathology. We aimed to characterize his patterns of 
language decline and evaluate the effects of tDCS applied to the right 
posterolateral cerebellum on his language abilities and executive control 
circuits.
METHODS: In a within-subject controlled design, Mr. G received 9 sessions of 
sham and anodal tDCS combined with semantic and phonological SLT in L2. Changes 
were evaluated with an oral naming task in L2, the Boston Naming Task and 
subtests of the Bilingual Aphasia Test in in L2 and L1, the Stroop Test and 
Attention Network Test, before and after each phase of stimulation (sham/tDCS) 
and at 2-month follow-up.
RESULTS: After anodal tDCS, but not after sham, results improved significantly 
on oral naming in L2, with generalization to untrained tasks and cross-language 
transfer (CLT) to L1: picture naming in both languages, syntactic comprehension 
and repetition in L2, and response times in the incongruent condition of the 
Attention Network Test, indicating increased inhibitory control.
CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results are the first to indicate that tDCS applied 
to the cerebellum may be a valuable tool to enhance the effects of SLT in 
bilingual patients with logopenic PPA.

BACKGROUND: Accurate and timely diagnosis of dementia is necessary to allow 
affected individuals to make informed decisions and access appropriate 
resources. When dementia goes undetected until a hospitalization or nursing home 
stay, this could reflect delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis, and may reflect 
underlying disparities in healthcare access.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we used 2012-2020 Medicare claims 
and other administrative data to examine variation in setting of dementia 
diagnosis among fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries with an initial 
claims-based dementia diagnosis in 2016. We used multinomial logistic regression 
to evaluate the association of person and geographic factors with diagnosis 
location, and Cox proportional hazards regression to examine 4-year survival 
relative to diagnosis location.
RESULTS: Among 754,204 Medicare beneficiaries newly diagnosed with dementia in 
2016, 60.3% were diagnosed in the community, 17.2% in hospitals, and 22.5% in 
nursing homes. Adjusted 4-year survival rates were significantly lower among 
those diagnosed in hospitals [-16.1 percentage points (95% CI: -17.0, -15.1)] 
and nursing homes [-16.8 percentage points (95% CI: -17.7, -15.9)], compared to 
those diagnosed in the community. Community-diagnosed beneficiaries were more 
often female, younger, Asian or Pacific Islander, Native American or Alaskan 
Native, Hispanic, had fewer baseline hospitalizations and higher homecare use, 
and resided in wealthier ZIP codes. Rural beneficiaries were more likely to be 
diagnosed in hospitals.
CONCLUSIONS: Many older adults are diagnosed with dementia in a hospital or 
nursing home. These individuals have significantly lower survival than those 
diagnosed in the community, which may indicate diagnosis during an acute illness 
or care transition, or at a later disease stage, all of which are suboptimal. 
These results highlight the need for improved dementia screening in the general 
population, particularly for individuals in rural areas and communities with 
higher social deprivation.

Tauopathies are neurodegenerative diseases that involve tau misfolding and 
aggregation in the brain. These diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
are some of the least understood and most difficult to treat neurodegenerative 
disorders. Antibodies and antibody fragments that target tau oligomers, which 
are especially toxic forms of tau, are promising options for immunotherapies and 
diagnostic tools for tauopathies. In this study, we have developed 
conformational, tau oligomer-specific nanobodies, or single-domain antibodies. 
We demonstrate that these nanobodies, OT2.4 and OT2.6, are highly specific for 
tau oligomers relative to tau monomers and fibrils. We used epitope mapping to 
verify that these nanobodies bind to discontinuous epitopes on tau and to 
support the idea that they interact with a conformation present in the 
oligomeric, and not monomeric or fibrillar, forms of tau. We show that these 
nanobodies interact with tau oligomers in brain samples from AD patients and 
from healthy older adults with primary age-related tauopathy. Our results 
demonstrate the potential of these nanobodies as tau oligomer-specific binding 
reagents and future tauopathy therapeutics and diagnostics.

Population growth and improved industrialization have led to a sharp rise in the 
demand for plant medicine. In recent years, there has been a general concern 
about developing new medicinal resources, cutting down on pharmaceutical waste, 
and discovering new, effective components of traditional Chinese medicine. A 
novel medication called Wuteng tablets is made from Schisandra chinensis stems 
and shows promise as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease. This work is the first 
development of an overall identification technique based on 
ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole 
time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q/TOF-MS). Using the MS-DIAL integrated 
informatics platform and UNIFI software, the chemical components of Wuteng 
tablets were identified, and the amount of lignin in the tablets was 
ascertained. This study will identify the chemical components of such 
medications, aid in the development and utilization of medicinal plant 
resources, and serve as a foundation for the analysis of the components of their 
biopharmaceutical origin.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between suspected pseudobulbar affect 
(PBA), clinical diagnosis, cognitive testing, and self-reported mood in older 
adults presenting for evaluation of dementia.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients presenting to an outpatient memory disorders clinic 
(N = 311).
METHODS: We used traditional and novel network modeling approaches to examine 
associations between neuropsychological (NP) tests, patient and clinician rating 
scales, and the Center for Neurological Study-Lability Scale (CNS-LS) among 
patients with suspected AD (n = 133) and other neurocognitive diagnosis 
(n = 178). We then examined differences in test performance between patients 
with and without suspected PBA (CNS-LS cut-off of ≥ 13), while accounting for 
demographic and psychiatric covariates with propensity score matching. Group 
differences were assessed with Bayesian models.
RESULTS: Prevalence of suspected PBA in AD was slightly less than half (44.4%) 
and at a similar rate in other dementias (e.g., 46.9% in CVD and 45.5% in LBD). 
In network models, the CNS-LS was associated with higher anxiety and better word 
list recall. After accounting for covariates, AD patients with suspected PBA 
performed better on word list recall βM = 0.40, 95% CI [0.15, 0.66], and 
committed fewer false positive errors on recognition βM = -1.51, 95% CI [-2.34, 
-0.59] than AD patients without suspected PBA. There were no differences in 
patients with any other diagnostic impression, nor group differences on other NP 
measures.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with suspected PBA and AD diagnosis had better memory 
recall and recognition than those without suspected PBA, suggesting that 
impaired emotional regulation may be an early sign of AD in patients with less 
prominent memory decline. Better understanding PBA in neurodegenerative 
diseases, including prevalence and comorbidity with psychiatric conditions, 
could help with early identification, education, and initiation of treatment.

BACKGROUND: Anti-amyloid-β (Aβ) immunotherapy trials have revealed 
amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) as the most prevalent and serious 
adverse events linked to pathological changes in cerebral vasculature. Recent 
studies underscore the critical involvement of perivascular macrophages and the 
infiltration of peripheral immune cells in regulating cerebrovascular damage. 
Specifically, Aβ antibodies engaged at cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) 
deposits trigger perivascular macrophage activation and the upregulation of 
genes associated with vascular permeability. Nevertheless, further research is 
needed to understand the immediate downstream consequences of macrophage 
activation, potentially exacerbating CAA-related vascular permeability and 
microhemorrhages linked to Aβ immunotherapy.
METHODS: This study investigates immune responses induced by amyloid-targeting 
antibodies and CAA-induced microhemorrhages using RNA in situ hybridization, 
histology and digital spatial profiling in an Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse 
model of microhemorrhage.
RESULTS: In the present study, we have demonstrated that bapineuzumab murine 
surrogate (3D6) induces profound vascular damage, leading to smooth muscle cell 
loss and blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown. In addition, digital spatial 
profiling (DSP) reveals that distinct immune responses contribute to vascular 
damage with peripheral immune responses and perivascular macrophage activation 
linked to smooth muscle cell loss and vascular fibrosis, respectively. Finally, 
RNA in situ hybridization identifies two distinct subsets of Trem2+ macrophages 
representing tissue-resident and monocyte-derived macrophages around vascular 
amyloid deposits. Overall, these findings highlight multifaceted roles of immune 
activation and vascular damage in driving the development of microhemorrhage.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our study has established a significant link between 
CAA-Aβ antibody immune complex formation, immune activation and vascular damage 
leading to smooth muscle cell loss. However, the full implications of this 
cascade on the development of microhemorrhages requires further exploration. 
Additional investigations are warranted to unravel the precise molecular 
mechanisms leading to microhemorrhage, the interplay of diverse immune 
populations and the functional roles played by various Trem2+ macrophage 
populations in response to Aβ immunotherapy.

Subcortical brain structures are involved in developmental, psychiatric and 
neurological disorders. Here we performed genome-wide association studies 
meta-analyses of intracranial and nine subcortical brain volumes (brainstem, 
caudate nucleus, putamen, hippocampus, globus pallidus, thalamus, nucleus 
accumbens, amygdala and the ventral diencephalon) in 74,898 participants of 
European ancestry. We identified 254 independent loci associated with these 
brain volumes, explaining up to 35% of phenotypic variance. We observed gene 
expression in specific neural cell types across differentiation time points, 
including genes involved in intracellular signaling and brain aging-related 
processes. Polygenic scores for brain volumes showed predictive ability when 
applied to individuals of diverse ancestries. We observed causal genetic effects 
of brain volumes with Parkinson's disease and attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder. Findings implicate specific gene expression patterns in brain 
development and genetic variants in comorbid neuropsychiatric disorders, which 
could point to a brain substrate and region of action for risk genes implicated 
in brain diseases.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses a major challenge due to its impact on the 
elderly population and the lack of effective early diagnosis and treatment 
options. In an effort to address this issue, a study focused on identifying 
potential biomarkers and therapeutic agents for AD was carried out. Using 
RNA-Seq data from AD patients and healthy individuals, 12 differentially 
expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, with 9 expressing upregulation (ISG15, 
HRNR, MTATP8P1, MTCO3P12, DTHD1, DCX, ST8SIA2, NNAT, and PCDH11Y) and 3 
expressing downregulation (LTF, XIST, and TTR). Among them, TTR exhibited the 
lowest gene expression profile. Interestingly, functional analysis tied TTR to 
amyloid fiber formation and neutrophil degranulation through enrichment 
analysis. These findings suggested the potential of TTR as a diagnostic 
biomarker for AD. Additionally, druggability analysis revealed that the 
FDA-approved drug Levothyroxine might be effective against the Transthyretin 
protein encoded by the TTR gene. Molecular docking and dynamics simulation 
studies of Levothyroxine and Transthyretin suggested that this drug could be 
repurposed to treat AD. However, additional studies using in vitro and in vivo 
models are necessary before these findings can be applied in clinical 
applications.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) presents a growing societal challenge, driven by an 
aging population. It is characterized by neurodegeneration linked to β-amyloid 
(Aβ) and tau protein aggregation. Reactive glial cell-mediated neuroinflammation 
exacerbates disease progression by facilitating the accumulation of Aβ and 
impairing its clearance, thus highlighting potential therapeutic targets. Aerial 
parts of Artemisia iwayomogi (AIH), a kind of mugwort, has been consumed as a 
medicinal herb in East Asia for relieving inflammation-related diseases. 
Previously, AIH was found to exert potent inhibitory effects on 
neuroinflammation. This study aimed to examine whether AIH mitigates AD 
pathogenesis by regulating neuroinflammation and reducing Aβ deposition. AIH 
treatment to primary mixed glial cultures attenuated the pro-inflammatory 
responses evoked by Aβ stimulation. When treated to 5 × familial AD (5xFAD) 
mice, AIH improved learning and cognitive ability and reduced Aβ burden in the 
brain. AIH suppressed glial overactivation, as well as inhibited the expressions 
of pro-inflammatory mediators in the brain. Moreover, AIH regulated AKT 
signaling and elevated the expression of autophagy-lysosomal mediators in vitro. 
It was confirmed that lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) was 
increased in the Aβ-associated microglia in the mouse hippocampus. Finally, it 
was observed that tau phosphorylation was alleviated, and synaptic protein 
expression was increased in AIH-treated 5xFAD mice. Overall, this study 
demonstrated that AIH ameliorated excessive neuroinflammation and Aβ 
accumulation by regulating microglial activation and autophagy-lysosomal 
pathway, thereby suggesting AIH as a promising therapeutic candidate for AD 
treatment.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one kind of devasting neurodegenerative disorders 
affecting over 50 million people worldwide. Multi-targeted therapy has emerged 
as a new treatment for diagnosing and alleviating the pathogenesis process of 
AD; however, the current strategy is limited by its unsatisfactory efficiency. 
In our study, engineered activated neutrophil-derived exosomes (MP@Cur-MExo) 
were developed to improve the mitochondrial function in neurons by targeting and 
alleviating Aβ-induced neurotoxicity. MP@Cur-MExo are exosomes derived from 
IL-8-stimulated neutrophils decorated with mitochondria targeting ligand and Aβ 
targeted ligand modified SPION. Engineered exosomes can be cleaved by matrix 
metallopeptidase-2, which is overexpressed in the AD brain. Consequently, the 
released SPION and Curcumin-loaded engineered exosomes collaboratively protected 
neuron cells against Aβ-induced mitochondrial deficiency. In addition, 
MP@Cur-MExo effectively accumulated in the inflamed region of AD brain at an 
early stage, allowing early diagnosis of AD through bimodal (MRI/IVIS) imaging. 
Importantly, in a mouse model at an early stage of AD, intravenously injected 
MP@Cur-MExo restored mitochondrial function and reduced Aβ-induced mitochondrial 
damage, thereby attenuating AD progression. In conclusion, our designed 
engineered exosomes demonstrated that omnidirectional improvement of 
mitochondrial function can serve as a novel and practical approach for the 
diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. This study also reveals a 
promising therapeutic agent for impeding AD progression for future clinical 
applications.

As per the World Health Organization (WHO) estimation, Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
will affect 100 million population across the globe by 2050. AD is an incurable 
neurodegenerative disease that remains a mystery for neurologists owing to its 
complex pathophysiology. Currently, available therapeutic regimens will only 
cause symptomatic relief by improving the cognitive and behavioral functions of 
AD. However, the major pitfalls in managing AD include tight junctions in the 
endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), diminished neuronal 
bioavailability, enzymatic degradation and reduced stability of the therapeutic 
moiety. In an effort to surmount the drawbacks mentioned above, researchers 
shifted their focus toward nanocarriers (NCs). Nevertheless, non-specific 
targeting of NCs imparts toxicity to the peripheral organs, thereby reducing the 
bioavailability of therapeutic moiety at the target site. To unravel this unmet 
clinical need, scientists came up with the idea of a novel intriguing strategy 
of surface engineering by targeting ligands. Surface-decorated NCs provide 
targeted drug delivery, controlled drug release, enhanced penetration and 
bioavailability. In this state-of-the-art review, we have highlighted in detail 
various molecular signalling pathways involved in AD pathogenesis. The 
significance of surface functionalization and its application in AD management 
have been deliberated. We have elaborated on the regulatory bottlenecks and 
clinical hurdles faced during lab-to-industrial scale translation along with 
possible solutions.

In animal models, brain neurodegeneration biomarkers drain into cervical lymph 
nodes (CLNs), and this drainage function is reduced with ageing. If this 
occurred in humans, CLNs may provide a readily accessible measure of this aspect 
of protein clearance. We tested this hypothesis in people using 
ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration. We measured amyloid-beta 40 and 42, 
phosphorylated tau 181 (pTau181), glial fibrillary acidic protein and 
neurofilament light using single molecule array in CLN aspirates and plasma 
from: (i) a discovery cohort of 25 autoimmune patients; and (ii) plasma, CLNs 
and capillary blood in four healthy volunteers, an optimization cohort. 
Ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration was well-tolerated by all participants. 
In both cohorts, all biomarkers were detected in all plasma and CLN samples, 
other than neurofilament light (8/17 of discovery cohort). CLN biomarker 
concentrations were significantly greater than plasma concentrations for all 
except neurofilament light, most markedly for pTau181 (266-fold; P < 0.02), 
whose CLN concentrations decreased with age (Spearman r = -0.66, P = 0.001). 
This study presents the first evidence that neurodegenerative biomarkers are 
detectable in human CLNs. Raised CLN:plasma biomarker ratios suggest their 
concentration in CLNs may offer a distinct compartment for minimally-invasive 
measurement of brain clearance and lymphatic drainage, with potential 
applicability to study of ageing and future clinical trials.

With global increase in ageing population along with increasing age-related 
neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), development of sustainable, safe and effective 
solutions for promoting healthy ageing and preventing diseases has become a 
priority. Traditional healthcare systems/medicines prescribe several herbs, 
foods and formulations to promote healthy ageing and prevent and/or treat 
age-related diseases. However, the scientific data elucidating their mechanism 
of action is very limited and deeper research using different models is 
warranted for timely and wider use. The clinical studies and research with 
higher model organisms, although useful, have several practical, technical, and 
financial limitations. Conversely, small organism models like Yeast, Roundworm, 
Fruit fly, and Zebrafish, which have genetic similarities to humans, can 
replicate the disease features and provide behavioural, cellular and molecular 
insights. The common features of ageing and NDs, like amyloid protein 
aggregations, oxidative stress, energy dysregulation, inflammation and 
neurodegeneration can be mimicked in the small organism models for Alzheimer's, 
Parkinson's, Huntington's diseases, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. This 
review focuses on small organism model- based research unveiling interesting 
modes of action and synergistic effects of herbal extracts, foods, and 
formulations, which are indicated especially for healthy ageing and management 
of NDs. This will provide leads for the quick and sustainable development of 
scientifically evaluated solutions for clinically relevant, age-related 
conditions.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease can cause dementia through brain matter 
degradation. This study investigates the monoclonal antibody usage for AD 
treatment, following PRISMA 2020 guidelines, and aims to discern the monoclonal 
antibody that offers the optimal balance of efficacy and safety for individuals 
with AD.
METHODS: A systematic search was conducted across databases such as PubMed, 
Cochrane Library, and clinical trial registries for randomized controlled 
trials. The quality of studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias 2 
tool. Cognitive function and daily activities were evaluated using MMSE, 
ADAS-Cog, and CDR-SB test data.
RESULTS: According to CDR-SB measurements, lecanemab showed effectiveness in 
reducing brain amyloid and cognitive decline, with a change from baseline of 
1.21. Aducanumab resulted in a decrease of -0.39 (-22%). Bapineuzumab showed no 
significant benefit, with scores of 2.4 (2.8). Gantenerumab, scoring 1.69 (1.37, 
2.01), reduces amyloid, particularly in early Alzheimer's stages. Crenezumab was 
ineffective, with a score of 3.61.
CONCLUSION: The findings provide various perspectives. Lecanemab showed the most 
promise in brain amyloid reduction and decelerating cognitive decline compared 
to the other therapies. Further research is needed, highlighting the necessity

Plain Language Summary: This study investigates the safety and efficacy of 
treating Alzheimer’s disease (AD) with monoclonal antibodies. In order to 
determine which antibody could be most helpful, we looked over a number of 
trials. Several antibodies, such as lecanemab, solanezumab, aducanumab, 
bapineuzumab, gantenerumab, and crenezumab, were the subject of the 
study.According to our research, lecanemab is particularly effective at lowering 
brain amyloid plaques and delaying cognitive deterioration, two major problems 
associated with Alzheimer’s disease. Other antibodies, such as solanezumab and 
bapineuzumab, had little to no beneficial effects, making their benefits less 
evident. The contradictory results of aducanumab indicate that further research 
is necessary to ascertain its actual efficacy. When administered at the earliest 
stages of Alzheimer’s disease or when used at a higher dose, crenezumab may be 
beneficial.Even though lecanemab seems promising, research in this field is 
still in its infancy. To validate these results and get further insight into the 
potential applications of these medicines in the management of Alzheimer’s 
disease, additional research is required. In summary, this study emphasizes the 
necessity of ongoing research to discover trustworthy treatments for AD 
patients.

IMPORTANCE: Individuals with Alzheimer disease (AD) and Alzheimer 
disease-related dementias (ADRD) may be at increased risk for adverse outcomes 
relating to inappropriate prescribing of certain high-risk medications, 
including antipsychotics, sedative-hypnotics, and strong anticholinergic agents.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of a patient/caregiver and prescriber-mailed 
educational intervention on potentially inappropriate prescribing to patients 
with AD or ADRD.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective, open-label, pragmatic 
randomized clinical trial, embedded in 2 large national health plans, was 
conducted from April 2022 to June 2023. The trial included patients with AD or 
ADRD and use of any of 3 drug classes targeted for deprescribing 
(antipsychotics, sedative-hypnotics, or strong anticholinergics).
INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to 1 of 3 arms: (1) a mailing of 
educational materials specific to the medication targeted for deprescribing to 
both the patient and their prescribing clinician; (2) a mailing to the 
prescribing clinician only; or (3) a usual care arm.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Analysis was performed using a modified 
intention-to-treat approach. The primary study outcome was the dispensing of the 
medication targeted for deprescribing during a 6-month study observation period. 
Secondary outcomes included changes in medication-specific mean daily dose and 
health service utilization.
RESULTS: Among 12 787 patients included in the modified intention-to-treat 
analysis, 8742 (68.4%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was 77.3 (9.4) years. 
The cumulative incidence of being dispensed a medication targeted for 
deprescribing was 76.7% (95% CI, 75.4-78.0) in the patient and prescriber 
mailing group, 77.9% (95% CI, 76.5-79.1) in the prescriber mailing only group, 
and 77.5% (95% CI, 76.2-78.8) in the usual care group. Hazard ratios were 0.99 
(95% CI, 0.94-1.04) for the patient and prescriber group and 1.00 (95% CI, 
0.96-1.06) for the prescriber only group compared with the usual care group. 
There were no differences between the groups for secondary outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest medication-specific 
educational mailings targeting patients with AD or ADRD and their clinicians are 
not effective in reducing the use of high-risk medications.

Growing evidence indicates that healthy diets are associated with a slower 
progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Flavonoids are among the most abundant 
natural products in diets beneficial to AD, such as the Mediterranean diet. 
However, the effect and mechanism of these dietary flavonoids on AD remains 
incompletely understood. Here, we found that a representative dietary natural 
flavonoid, chrysin (Chr), significantly ameliorated cognitive impairment and AD 
pathology in APP/PS1 mice. Furthermore, mechanistic studies showed that Chr 
significantly reduced the levels of amyloid-β (Aβ) and phosphorylated tau 
(p-tau), along with dual inhibitory activity against β-site amyloid precursor 
protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β). 
Moreover, the effect of Chr was further confirmed by EW233, a structural analog 
of Chr that exhibited an improved pharmacokinetic profile. To further verify the 
role of Chr and EW233, we utilized our previously established chimeric human 
cerebral organoid (chCO) model for AD, in which astrogenesis was promoted to 
mimic the neuron-astrocyte ratio in human brain tissue, and similar dual 
inhibition of Aβ and p-tau was also observed. Altogether, our study not only 
reveals the molecular mechanisms through which dietary flavonoids, such as Chr, 
mitigate AD pathology, but also suggests that identifying a specific constituent 
that mimics some of the benefits of these healthy diets could serve as a 
promising approach to discover new treatments for AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common type of dementia among older adults, 
is a chronic neurodegenerative pathology that causes a progressive loss of 
cognitive functioning with a decline of rational skills. It is well known that 
AD is multifactorial, so there are many different pharmacological targets that 
can be pursued. According to estimates from the World Health Organization (WHO), 
18 million individuals worldwide suffer from AD. Major initiatives to identify 
risk factors, enhance care giving, and conduct basic research to delay the 
beginning of AD were started by the USA, France, Germany, France, and various 
other nations. Widely recognized as a key player in the development and 
subsequent progression of AD pathogenesis, glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) 
controls a number of crucial targets associated with neuronal degeneration. 
GSK-3 inhibition has been linked to reduced tau hyperphosphorylation, β-amyloid 
formation, and neuroprotective benefits in Alzheimer's disease. Lithium, the 
very first inhibitor of GSK-3β that was used therapeutically, has been 
successfully used for many years with remarkable results. A great variety of 
structurally varied strong GSK-3β blockers have been identified in recent years. 
The purpose of this thorough review is to cover the biological and structural 
elements of glycogen synthase kinase, as well as the medicinal chemistry aspects 
of GSK inhibitors that have been produced in recent years.

OBJECTIVE: Develop and preliminarily validate recognition subtests for Form B of 
the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS).
METHOD: 49 older adults with no cognitive impairment were compared to 53 
individuals with a primary neurocognitive disorder (e.g., dementia, mild 
cognitive impairment, and traumatic brain injury) and 22 individuals with a 
primary psychiatric disorder (e.g., depression and anxiety) on three recognition 
subtests (list, story, and figure) for Form B of the RBANS in this observational 
study.
RESULTS: The individuals with a primary neurocognitive disorder performed 
significantly poorer on most of the recognition scores compared to those with no 
cognitive impairment and those with a primary psychiatric disorder, with these 
latter two groups being largely comparable. In the entire sample, for the 
recognition subtests, education only correlated with figure recognition scores, 
and neither age nor gender influenced recognition scores. The RBANS indexes 
correlated with most of the recognition scores in the expected directions.
CONCLUSIONS: The group differences in performance on these recognition subtests 
preliminarily validate these scores on Form B, which were not previously 
available. Furthermore, these scores tended to not be influenced by age, 
education, or gender, although they were related to overall cognitive 
functioning. Additional validation is needed in larger, better 
clinically-defined, and more diverse samples. Nonetheless, these findings 
support the inclusion of the newly-developed Form B recognition subtests in 
future clinical practice and research settings to enhance the accuracy of 
diagnoses and treatment recommendations.

BACKGROUND: Dementia is a prevalent, progressive, neurodegenerative condition 
with multifactorial causes. Due to the lack of effective pharmaceutical 
treatments for dementia, there are growing clinical and research interests in 
using vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) as a potential non-pharmacological therapy 
for dementia. However, the extent of the research volume and nature into the 
effects of VNS on dementia is not well understood. This study aimed to examine 
the extent and nature of research activities in relation to the use of VNS in 
dementia and disseminate research findings for the potential utility in dementia 
care.
METHODS: We performed a scoping review of literature searches in PubMed, HINARI, 
Google Scholar, and the Cochrane databases from 1980 to November 30th, 2023, 
including the reference lists of the identified studies. The following search 
terms were utilized: brain stimulation, dementia, Alzheimer's disease, vagal 
stimulation, memory loss, Deme*, cognit*, VNS, and Cranial nerve stimulation. 
The included studies met the following conditions: primary research articles 
pertaining to both humans and animals for both longitudinal and cross-sectional 
study designs and published in English from January 1st, 1980, to November 30th, 
2023; investigated VNS in either dementia or cognitive impairment; and were not 
case studies, conference proceedings/abstracts, commentaries, or ordinary review 
papers.
FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS: We identified 8062 articles, and after screening for 
eligibility (sequentially by titles, abstracts and full text reading, and 
duplicate removal), 10 studies were included in the review. All the studies 
included in this literature review were conducted over the last three decades in 
high-income geographical regions (i.e., Europe, the United States, the United 
Kingdom, and China), with the majority of them (7/10) being performed in humans. 
The main reported outcomes of VNS in the dementia cases were enhanced cognitive 
functions, an increased functional connectivity of various brain regions 
involved in learning and memory, microglial structural modifications from 
neurodestructive to neuroprotective configurations, a reduction of cerebral 
spinal fluid tau-proteins, and significant evoked brain tissue potentials that 
could be utilized to diagnose neurodegenerative disorders. The study outcomes 
highlight the potential for VNS to be used as a non-pharmacological therapy for 
cognitive impairment in dementia-related diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.

Rationale: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is hallmarked by amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and 
hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) neurofibrillary tangles. While Aβ-centric 
therapies have shown promise, the complex pathology of AD requires a 
multifaceted therapeutic approach. The weak association between Aβ levels and 
cognitive decline highlights the need for alternative theranostic strategies. 
Currently, oxidative stress and tau hyperphosphorylation are now recognized as 
critical pathological events in AD. Thus, therapies that concurrently attenuate 
oxidative stress damage and inhibit tau pathology hold great potential for AD 
treatment. Methods: Herein, a multifunctional neuron-targeted nanocomposite is 
devised to realize dual imaging-guided AD therapy, integrating the inhibition of 
tau pathology and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-neutralizing biofunctions. The 
construction of the nanocomposite incorporates polyphenolic antioxidants tannic 
acid (TA)-based nanoparticles carrying manganese ions (Mn2+) and fluorescent dye 
IR780 iodide (IR780), coupled with a neuron-specific TPL peptide. The resulting 
IR780-Mn@TA-TPL nanoparticles (NPs) are comprehensively evaluated in both in 
vitro and in vivo AD models to assess their imaging capabilities and therapeutic 
efficacy. Results: The nanocomposite facilitates Mn-enhanced magnetic resonance 
(MR) imaging and near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging. It effectively 
neutralizes toxic ROS and reduces tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation. In 
AD rat models, the nanocomposite restores neuronal density in the hippocampus 
and significantly improves spatial memory. Conclusions: Such a neuron‑targeting 
multifunctional nanocomposite represents a potential theranostic strategy for 
AD, signifying a shift towards bimodal imaging-guided treatment approaches.

Rationale: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease 
accompanied by neurotoxicity, excessive inflammation, and cognitive impairment. 
The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) δ is a potential target 
for AD. However, its regulatory mechanisms and therapeutic potential in AD 
remain unclear. We aimed to investigate if the activation of PPARδ using a 
highly selective and potent agonist could provide an effective therapeutic 
strategy against AD. Methods: We synthesized a novel PPARδ agonist, 5a, 
containing a selenazole group and determined the X-ray crystal structure of its 
complex with PPARδ. The drug-like properties of 5a were assessed by analyzing 
cytochrome P450 (CYP) inhibition, microsomal stability, pharmacokinetics, and 
mutagenicity. We investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of 5a using 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated BV-2 microglia and neuroinflammatory mouse 
model. The therapeutic efficacy of 5a was evaluated in AD mice with 
scopolamine-induced memory impairment and APP/PS1 by analyzing cognitive 
function, glial reactivity, and amyloid pathology. Results: Compound 5a, the 
most potent and selective PPARδ agonist, was confirmed to bind hPPARδ in a 
complex by X-ray crystallographic analysis. PPARδ activation using 5a showed 
potent anti-inflammatory effects in activated glial cells and mouse model of 
neuroinflammation. Administration of 5a inhibited amyloid plaque deposition by 
suppressing the expression of neuronal beta-site amyloid precursor protein 
cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), and reduced abnormal glial hyperactivation and 
inflammatory responses, resulting in improved learning and memory in the APP/PS1 
mouse model of AD. Conclusion: We identified that specific activation of PPARδ 
provides therapeutic effects on multiple pathogenic phenotypes of AD, including 
neuroinflammation and amyloid deposition. Our findings suggest the potential of 
PPARδ as a promising drug target for treating AD.

Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) plays an essential role 
in microglia activation and is being investigated as a potential therapeutic 
target for modulation of microglia in several neurological diseases. In this 
study, we present the development and preclinical evaluation of 64Cu-labeled 
antibody-based PET radiotracers as tools for non-invasive assessment of TREM2 
expression. Furthermore, we tested the potential of an antibody transport 
vehicle (ATV) that binds human transferrin receptor to facilitate transcytosis 
of TREM2 antibody-based radiotracers to the CNS and improve target engagement. 
Methods: A TREM2 antibody with an engineered transport vehicle (ATV:4D9) and 
without (4D9) were covalently modified with pNCS-benzyl-NODAGA and labeled with 
copper-64. Potency, stability, and specificity were assessed in vitro followed 
by in vivo PET imaging at the early 2 h, intermediate 20 h, and late imaging 
time points 40 h post-injection using a human transferrin receptor (hTfR) 
expressing model for amyloidogenesis (5xFAD;TfRmu/hu) or wild-type mice 
(WT;TfRmu/hu), and hTfR negative controls. Organs of interest were isolated to 
determine biodistribution by ex vivo autoradiography. Cell sorting after in vivo 
tracer injection was used to demonstrate cellular specificity for microglia and 
to validate TREM2 PET results in an independent mouse model for amyloidogenesis 
(AppSAA;TfRmu/hu). For translation to human imaging, a human TREM2 antibody 
(14D3) was radiolabeled and used for in vitro autoradiography on human brain 
sections. Results: The 64Cu-labeled antibodies were obtained in high 
radiochemical purity (RCP), radiochemical yield (RCY), and specific activity. 
Antibody modification did not impact TREM2 binding. ATV:4D9 binding proved to be 
specific, and the tracer stability was maintained over 48 h. The uptake of 
[64Cu]Cu-NODAGA-ATV:4D9 in the brains of hTfR expressing mice was up to 4.6-fold 
higher than [64Cu]Cu-NODAGA-4D9 in mice without hTfR. TREM2 PET revealed 
elevated uptake in the cortex of 5xFAD mice compared to wild-type, which was 
validated by autoradiography. PET-to-biodistribution correlation revealed that 
elevated radiotracer uptake in brains of 5xFAD;TfRmu/hu mice was driven by 
microglia-rich cortical and hippocampal brain regions. Radiolabeled ATV:4D9 was 
selectively enriched in microglia and cellular uptake explained PET signal 
enhancement in AppSAA;TfRmu/hu mice. Human autoradiography showed elevated TREM2 
tracer binding in the cortex of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Conclusion: 
[64Cu]Cu-NODAGA-ATV:4D9 has potential for non-invasive assessment of TREM2 as a 
surrogate marker for microglia activation in vivo. ATV engineering for hTfR 
binding and transcytosis overcomes the blood-brain barrier restriction for 
antibody-based PET radiotracers. TREM2 PET might be a versatile tool for many 
applications beyond Alzheimer's disease, such as glioma and chronic inflammatory 
diseases.

Background: Ferroptosis, a recently unveiled iron-dependent form of cellular 
demise, has emerged as a pivotal process contributing to the pathology of 
Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Glutathione Peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a vital defense 
mechanism countering ferroptosis by nullifying lipid peroxides and maintaining 
cellular redox equilibrium, has garnered significant attention in AD. Thus, 
identifying ferroptosis inhibitors to target GPX4 activation may help mitigate 
neuronal damage and impede AD progression. Objectives: We aimed to screen potent 
ferroptosis inhibitors and investigate their mechanism of action and therapeutic 
potential in AD, as well as lay the groundwork for future research in this 
promising area of study. Methods: This study employed a natural compound library 
to screen potential ferroptosis inhibitors in RAS-selective lethal compounds 3 
(RSL-3)-induced PC-12 cells. Ferroptosis was evaluated by examining the 
mitochondrial morphology and function, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, 
and lipid peroxide levels. The ability to chelate iron and intracellular iron 
levels was determined by UHPLC-Q/TOF-MS/MS and PGSK staining, respectively. APP 
Swe/ind- or Tau P301L-overexpressing PC-12 cells, and Amyloid-β transgenic 
CL4176 and Tau transgenic BR5270 Caenorhabditis elegans were employed as 
cellular and animal models of AD. Results: Thonningianin A (ThA) was identified 
as a novel ferroptosis inhibitor, as demonstrated by augmented cellular 
viability, mitigated mitochondrial impairment, diminished lipid peroxides, iron 
levels, and ROS generation. Mechanistically, ThA binds with GPX4 and enhances 
the AMPK/Nrf2 signaling pathway to stimulate GPX4 activation, effectively 
inhibiting ferroptosis. Moreover, in cellular and Caenorhabditis elegans AD 
models, ThA substantially inhibits ferroptosis by reducing ROS, lipid peroxide 
generation, and iron accumulation. Furthermore, ThA significantly delays 
paralysis, ameliorates food-sensing deficits and increases worms' antioxidative 
capacity. Conclusion: ThA ameliorates AD by inhibiting neuronal ferroptosis 
mediated by GPX4 activation through its binding with GPX4 and the upregulation 
of the AMPK/Nrf2/GPX4 pathway.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent degenerative disorder affecting the 
central nervous system of the elderly. Patients primarily manifest cognitive 
decline and non-cognitive neuro-psychiatric symptoms. Currently, western 
medications for AD primarily include cholinesterase inhibitors and glutamate 
receptor inhibitors, which have limited efficacy and accompanied by significant 
toxic side effects. Given the intricate pathogenesis of AD, the use of 
single-target inhibitors is limited. In recent years, as research on AD has 
progressed, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and its active ingredients have 
increasingly played a crucial role in clinical treatment. Numerous studies 
demonstrate that TCM and its active ingredients can exert anti-Alzheimer's 
effects by modulating pathological protein production and deposition, inhibiting 
tau protein hyperphosphorylation, apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress, 
while enhancing the central cholinergic system, protecting neurons and synapses, 
and optimizing energy metabolism. This article summarizes extracts from TCM and 
briefly elucidates their pharmacological mechanisms against AD, aiming to 
provide a foundation for further research into the specific mechanisms of TCM in 
the prevention and treatment of the disease, as well as the identification of 
efficacious active ingredients.

BACKGROUND: China has the largest number of dementia patients in the world, 
posing a significant health and economic burden. Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 
other dementia patients face a higher risk of mortality during heatwaves, but 
relevant studies on this topic have been limited so far.
METHODS: The study extracted data from the China Cause of Death Reporting System 
(CDRS) on deaths of AD and other dementia patients aged 60 years and above 
between 2013 and 2020. Using an individual-level, time-stratified, and 
case-crossover study design, the effects of heatwaves across nine scenarios on 
dementia mortality were quantified by conditional logistic regression combined 
with distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM). Additionally, the attributable 
fractions (AFs) of deaths due to heatwaves were calculated.
FINDINGS: A total of 399,036 death cases were reported caused by AD and other 
dementias during the study period. It was found that heatwaves significantly 
increased the risk of death among people with AD and other dementias. As the 
intensities and durations of the heatwaves increased, the lag0-7 cumulative odds 
ratios (CORs) of mortality increased progressively from 1.140 (95% CI: 1.118, 
1.163) under the mildest heatwave to 1.459 (95% CI: 1.403, 1.518) under the most 
severe one, across nine heatwave scenarios examined. Additionally, under 
specific heatwave scenarios, sex and regions modified the mortality risk, but no 
significant age differences were observed. The AFs of AD and other dementia 
mortality due to milder heatwaves were lower compared to more severe heatwaves, 
ranging from 12.281% (95% CI: 10.555%, 14.015%) to 31.460% (95% CI: 28.724%, 
34.124%).
INTERPRETATION: The study provided critical insights into the substantial 
increase in heatwave-related mortality among AD and other dementia patients 
during and after heatwave events. The results from our quantitative analyses 
will provide needed scientific evidence for policymakers and practitioners to 
develop relevant policies and guidelines to protect the health and well-beings 
of vulnerable populations in future in the context of both seasonal changes and 
long-term climate change.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by 
multiple causes. The main pathological features of AD are β-amyloid (Aβ) 
deposition, hyperphosphorylation of Tau protein, and progressive neuronal loss. 
Pyroptosis is one of the main forms of neuronal death, which is mainly caused by 
the activation of Gasdermin protein by upstream signals and the release of its 
N-terminal domain on the cell membrane. Studies have shown that there is a close 
relationship between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and pyroptosis. Therefore, this 
paper summarizes the relationship between pyroptosis and its molecular mechanism 
and AD, as well as the related research of traditional Chinese medicine in the 
treatment of AD by regulating pyroptosis, in order to provide a new direction 
for the study of AD pathogenesis based on pyroptosis pathway.

Clinical trial participation across disease areas, including Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), has been biased towards White participants of European ancestry. To 
support clinical decision-making across diverse populations, we must recognize 
and address barriers to trial participation. To inform the design of ALUMNI AD, 
a trial focused on historically underrepresented AD populations, we held 
advice-seeking fora with key stakeholders to understand barriers and identify 
potential solutions to maximize trial participation of underrepresented racial 
and ethnic groups in the US. Strategies identified from this process include: 
obtaining and implementing recommendations from community stakeholders; 
establishing a simple and inclusive prescreening and screening process; 
supporting participants and care partners; identifying and activating 
community-centric clinical sites; and demonstrating community commitment. While 
ALUMNI AD did not commence, we hope that our insights could be incorporated into 
future studies to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion in AD clinical 
research.

BACKGROUND: We aimed to assess perioperative changes in fibrinogen in the 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), their association with markers of blood-brain barrier 
breakdown and neuroinflammation, and their association with postoperative 
delirium severity.
METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of the Interventions for 
Postoperative Delirium-Biomarker 2 (IPOD-B2, NCT02926417) study, a prospective 
observational cohort study. We included 24 patients aged >21 yr undergoing 
aortic aneurysm repair. CSF samples were obtained before (n=24) and after 
surgery (n=13), with some participants having multiple postoperative samples. 
Our primary outcome was the perioperative change in CSF fibrinogen. Delirium was 
assessed using the Delirium Rating Scale-Revised-98.
RESULTS: CSF fibrinogen increased after surgery (P<0.001), and this was 
associated with an increase in CSF/plasma albumin ratio (β=1.09, 95% CI 
0.47-1.71, P=0.004). The peak change in CSF fibrinogen was associated with the 
change in CSF interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-12p70. The peak change in CSF 
fibrinogen was associated with the change in CSF total tau (β=0.47, 95% CI 
0.24-0.71, P=0.002); however, we did not observe an association with 
postoperative delirium severity (incidence rate ratio = 1.20, 95% CI 0.66-2.17, 
P=0.540).
CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary findings support the hypothesis that fibrinogen 
enters the brain via blood-brain barrier disruption, promoting neuroinflammation 
and neuronal injury. However, we did not observe an association between 
cerebrospinal fluid fibrinogen and peak delirium severity in this limited 
cohort.

Background Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a form of dementia, marked by amyloid-β 
plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuronal loss. The amyloid burden has been 
associated with cognitive impairment and depression, suggesting a potential link 
between these conditions. Objective This study investigates the relationships 
between amyloid burden, cognitive impairment, and depression in the preclinical 
stages of AD. Methods Data from the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic 
Alzheimer's (A4) study, involving 4486 cognitively unimpaired individuals aged 
65-85, was analyzed. The amyloid burden was assessed using positron emission 
tomography (PET) standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR), cognitive function 
via cognitive function index (CFI) and tests, and depression via the short-form 
geriatric depression scale. Mediation analyses, adjusted for age, sex, and 
education, were employed to measure the impact of amyloid deposition on 
depression into direct and cognition-mediated indirect effects. Results No 
significant direct correlation between amyloid burden and depression was found 
(p=0.2935). Significant indirect effects were observed in cognition measures: 
CFI (0.3203, 95% CI: (0.2382, 0.4010)), digit symbol substitution test (0.0401, 
95% CI: (0.0180, 0.0683)), and immediate recall (0.0169, 95% CI: (0.0014, 
0.0354)). However, free and cued selective reminding (0.0056, 95% CI: (-0.0078, 
0.0268)) and delayed recall (0.0105, 95% CI: (-0.0009, 0.0259)) showed no 
significant indirect effects. Conclusions The findings indicate significant 
mediation by CFI, digit symbol substitution test, and immediate recall in the 
relationship between amyloid burden and depression while free and cued selective 
reminding and delayed recall showed no significant mediation. These results 
underscore the importance of further research using longitudinal data and a 
broader range of confounders to fully understand cognition's mediating role.

Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is associated with an increased risk for 
cognitive impairment and dementia, which likely involves Alzheimer's disease 
pathology. Non-rapid eye movement slow-wave activity (SWA) has been implicated 
in amyloid clearance, but it has not been studied in the context of longitudinal 
amyloid accumulation in OSA. This longitudinal retrospective study aims to 
investigate the relationship between polysomnographic and electrophysiological 
SWA features and amyloid accumulation. From the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging 
cohort, we identified 71 participants ≥60 years old with OSA (mean baseline age 
= 72.9 ± 7.5 years, 60.6% male, 93% cognitively unimpaired) who had at least 2 
consecutive Amyloid Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB)-PET scans and a polysomnographic 
study within 5 years of the baseline scan and before the second scan. Annualized 
PiB-PET accumulation [global ΔPiB(log)/year] was estimated by the difference 
between the second and first log-transformed global PiB-PET uptake estimations 
divided by the interval between scans (years). Sixty-four participants were 
included in SWA analysis. SWA was characterized by the mean relative spectral 
power density (%) in slow oscillation (SO: 0.5-0.9 Hz) and delta (1-3.9 Hz) 
frequency bands and by their downslopes (SO-slope and delta-slope, respectively) 
during the diagnostic portion of polysomnography. We fit linear regression 
models to test for associations among global ΔPiB(log)/year, SWA features (mean 
SO% and delta% or mean SO-slope and delta-slope), and OSA severity markers, 
after adjusting for age at baseline PiB-PET, APOE ɛ4 and baseline amyloid 
positivity. For 1 SD increase in SO% and SO-slope, global ΔPiB(log)/year 
increased by 0.0033 (95% CI: 0.0001; 0.0064, P = 0.042) and 0.0069 (95% CI: 
0.0009; 0.0129, P = 0.026), which were comparable to 32% and 59% of the effect 
size associated with baseline amyloid positivity, respectively. Delta-slope was 
associated with a reduction in global ΔPiB(log)/year by -0.0082 (95% CI: 
-0.0143; -0.0021, P = 0.009). Sleep apnoea severity was not associated with 
amyloid accumulation. Regional associations were stronger in the pre-frontal 
region. Both slow-wave slopes had more significant and widespread regional 
associations. Annualized PiB-PET accumulation was positively associated with SO 
and SO-slope, which may reflect altered sleep homeostasis due to increased 
homeostatic pressure in the setting of unmet sleep needs, increased synaptic 
strength, and/or hyper-excitability in OSA. Delta-slope was inversely associated 
with PiB-PET accumulation, suggesting it may represent residual physiological 
activity. Further investigation of SWA dynamics in the presence of sleep 
disorders before and after treatment is necessary for understanding the 
relationship between amyloid accumulation and SWA physiology.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of a 12-week individual cognitive 
stimulation (iCS) intervention on global cognition, memory, and executive 
function of older adults with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHOD: Protocolized analysis using data from a multicenter, single-blind, 
randomized, parallel two-arm RCT of iCS for older adults with probable AD. A 
sample of 142 people with probable Alzheimer's disease attending 13 Portuguese 
institutions providing care and support services for older adults were selected. 
Intervention group (n = 72) received 24 iCS sessions, twice a week for 12 weeks. 
Control group (n = 70) maintained their activities as usual. Outcomes included 
global cognitive function (Mini-Mental State Examination, and Alzheimer's 
Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale), memory (Memory Alteration Test, 
and Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test), and executive functioning (Frontal 
Assessment Battery). All participants were assessed at baseline (T0), after the 
intervention (T1), and 12 weeks follow-up (T2).
RESULTS: The results showed significant improvements in memory performance at 
follow-up for the intervention group and greater stability in global cognition 
in the intervention relative to the control group.
CONCLUSION: The current iCS protocol shows effectiveness in cognitive 
functioning in older adults with probable AD, particularly for memory upon 
completion of the intervention and at follow-up, adding further support to 
previous iCS studies showing similar results and to the effectiveness of the 
current intervention.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a gradual degenerative ailment of the nervous system 
that is marked by the buildup of amyloid-β plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. 
This accumulation causes problems with the connections between nerve cells and 
the loss of these cells. This review paper explores the complex pathophysiology 
of AD, analyzing the neuronal loss reported in key brain regions like the 
entorhinal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, and cortical association areas. The 
text also examines subcortical nuclei participation, such as the noradrenergic 
locus coeruleus, serotonergic dorsal raphe, and cholinergic basal nucleus. Also, 
this review discusses the importance of tau protein hyperphosphorylation, 
oxidative stress, and metal ion dysregulation in the evolution of AD. Moreover, 
it explores the cholinergic theory and the influence of the APOE (apolipoprotein 
E) genotype on the effectiveness of therapy. This article thoroughly summarizes 
the current knowledge on AD, including its clinical symptoms and possible 
treatment approaches, by combining several theories and new targets. The study 
highlights the connection between the degree of tangle development and the 
severity of dementia, underlining the need for creative methods to tackle the 
complex difficulties of discovering drugs for AD.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative 
disease in older people, characterized by the accumulation of beta-amyloid (Aβ) 
plaques and neurofibrillary tangles composed of aggregated of 
hyperphosphorylated tau protein, which normally helps stabilize microtubules in 
neurons.
METHOD: Nowadays, artemisinin (ART) as well as its semisynthetic derivatives 
(ARTs) are seen as potential neuroprotectors. The goal of the present study is 
the assessment of neuroprotective, antibacterial activity of ART, as well as in 
silico studies of ART affinity to Aβ-peptides and the search of potential 
targets for ART. The study is referring to explores the impact of ART on an 
animal model of AD that is induced by the aggregated amyloidogenic peptide 
Aβ1-42 by electrophysiology and morphology analysis. Specifically, the focus is 
on the activation of the entorhinal cortex (ENT) as synaptic potentiation.
RESULT: Electrophysiological and histochemical have demonstrated that 
therapeutic injection of ART or its derivatives acts as a neuroprotective This 
treatment appears to prevent or slow down damage to brain tissue, and it 
promotes the restoration of neurons and their surrounding environment. The 
protective effects of ART may involve various mechanisms, including antioxidant 
activity, anti-inflammatory effects, and the inhibition of apoptosis.
CONCLUSION: in silico studies revealed a direct, strong interaction of ART with 
the amyloidogenic peptides 5Aβ17-42, 12Aβ9-40, and 18Aβ9-40. in silico screening 
revealed several protein targets for ART, including cytochrome P-450 2B6 
(CYP2B6). The highest binding affinity was found on the active site of CYP2B6. 
ART has great potential for discovering new drugs using combined therapies.

This proof-of-concept study uses individualized functional magnetic resonance 
imaging neuromodulation (iNM) to explore the mechanisms that enhance BOLD 
signals in visuospatial perception (VP) networks that are crucial for 
navigation. Healthy participants (n = 8) performed a VP up- and down-direction 
discrimination task at full and subthreshold coherence through peripheral 
vision, and superimposed direction through visual imagery (VI) at central space 
under iNM and control conditions. iNM targets individualized anatomical and 
functional middle- and medial-superior temporal (MST) networks that control VP. 
We found that iNM engaged selective exteroceptive and interoceptive attention 
(SEIA) and motor planning (MP) networks. Specifically, iNM increased overall: 
(i) area under the curve of the BOLD magnitude: 100% in VP (but decreased for 
weak coherences), 21-47% in VI, 26-59% in MP and 48-76% in SEIA through 
encoding; and (ii) classification performance for each direction, coherence and 
network through decoding, predicting stimuli from brain maps. Our findings, 
derived from encoding and decoding models, suggest that mechanisms induced by 
iNM are causally linked in enhancing visuospatial networks and demonstrate iNM 
as a feasibility treatment for low-vision patients with cortical blindness or 
visuospatial impairments that precede cognitive decline.This article is part of 
the theme issue 'Neurofeedback: new territories and neurocognitive mechanisms of 
endogenous neuromodulation'.

Current diagnosis and treatment strategies mainly focus on the pathologies of 
the mid-to-late stage of AD (Alzheimer's disease), with clinical outcomes that 
are far from ideal. Herein, we developed the ROS (reactive oxygen 
species)-responsive brain neuronal targeting nanotheranostic platforms that 
possess the dual-channel fluorescent "turn-on" properties and release drugs in 
AD neurons in response to ROS, thereby simultaneously facilitating the diagnosis 
and therapy of early AD. Through the modification of acetylcholine receptor 
targeting RVG29 peptide, the nanotheranostics penetrated BBB and accumulated 
into diseased neurons in an intact form, consequently maximizing the diagnostic 
and therapeutic performance. The anti-oxidative drug baicalein conjugated onto 
the surface of nanotheranostics via ROS-cleavable boronate ester linkage rapidly 
released for ROS scavenging, while the encapsulated fluorophores turned on their 
fluorescence for AD diagnosis upon microenvironment stimuli. This 
nanotheranostic strategy exhibited highly sensitivity with a ROS detection limit 
of up to 100 µm and accurately early detection of ROS in 3×Tg AD mice at 6 
months of age in vivo. In addition, it could also rescue memory defects, 
scavenge oxidative stress, attenuate neuroinflammation and enhance 
neuroprotective effect in 3×Tg AD mice. This work opens up a promising and smart 
strategy for early diagnosis and therapy in neurodegenerative disease.

INTRODUCTION: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) α-synuclein (α-syn) seed amplification 
assay (SAA) is a sensitive and specific tool for detecting Lewy body 
co-pathology in Alzheimer's disease.
METHODS: A total of 1637 cross-sectional and 407 longitudinal CSF samples from 
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were tested with SAA. We 
examined longitudinal dynamics of amyloid beta (Aβ), α-syn seeds, and 
phosphorylated tau181 (p-tau181), along with global and domain-specific 
cognition in stable SAA+, stable SAA-, and those who converted to SAA+ from 
SAA-.
RESULTS: SAA+ individuals had faster cognitive decline than SAA-, notably in 
mild cognitive impairment, and presented with earlier symptom onset. SAA+ 
conversion was associated with CSF Aβ42 positivity but did not impact the 
progression of either CSF Aβ42 or CSF p-tau181 status. CSF Aβ42, p-tau181, and 
α-syn SAA were all strong predictors of clinical progression, particularly CSF 
Aβ42. In vitro, CSF α-syn SAA kinetic parameters were associated with 
participant demographics, clinical profiles, and cognitive decline.
DISCUSSION: These results highlight the interplay between amyloid and α-syn and 
their association with disease progression.
HIGHLIGHTS: Seed amplification assay (SAA) positivity was associated with 
greater cognitive decline and earlier symptom onset. Thirty-four Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) individuals progressed from SAA- to SAA+, 
that is, ≈ 5% conversion. SAA conversion was associated with amyloid beta (Aβ) 
pathology and greater cognitive decline. SAA status did not impact the 
progression of either CSF Aβ42 or phosphorylated tau181 biomarkers. Change in 
clinical diagnosis was associated with both Alzheimer's disease biomarkers and 
SAA. SAA kinetic parameters were associated with clinical features and 
progression.

The global increase in the number of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients has posed 
numerous treatment challenges. Six Food and Drug Administration-approved 
medications (e.g., donepezil and memantine) have demonstrated some efficacy but 
are primarily used to alleviate symptoms. The etiology of AD is unknown, and the 
blood-brain barrier restricts drug penetration, which severely restricts the use 
of various therapeutic agents. With their high targeting, long-lasting effect, 
and multifunctionality, inorganic nanomaterials provide a novel approach to the 
treatment of AD. A review of inorganic nanoparticles in the diagnosis and 
therapy of AD. This paper reviews the research literature on the use of 
inorganic nanomaterials in the treatment of AD. Gold nanoparticles, 
superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, magnetic nanoparticles, carbon 
nanotubes, and quantum dots are among the inorganic nanomaterials studied. As 
knowledge of the origins of AD remains limited, the majority of studies on 
inorganic nanomaterials have primarily focused on interventions on Aβ proteins. 
Adjusting and enhancing the properties of these inorganic nanomaterials, such as 
core-shell structure design and surface modification, confer benefits for the 
treatment of AD. Inorganic nanoparticles have a wide spectrum of therapeutic 
potential for AD. Despite their potential benefits, however, the safety and 
translation of inorganic nanomaterials into clinical applications remain 
formidable obstacles.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), a form of neurodegenerative disorder characterized by 
the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ), hyperphosphorylated Tau, and 
neuroinflammation. The increasing population affected by AD urges for the 
development of effective treatments. The correlation between AD and gut 
microbiome remains underexplored, potentially providing a better understanding 
of the disease. Salvianolic acid A (Sal A) and salvianolic acid B (Sal B) are 
the active components extracted from Salvia miltiorrhiza (Danshen), and their 
antioxidant, anti-inflammation and Aβ inhibition activities were shown 
previously. In this study, these compounds were used to investigate their 
effects on Aβ toxicity, using Drosophila melanogaster expressing human Aβ42 as 
the model organism, by examining their lifespan and changes in gut bacterial 
communities. The study used two batches of flies, reared on food with or without 
methylparaben (MP) supplementation to evaluate the influence of MP on this 
animal model during pharmacological studies. MP is a common antimicrobial agent 
used in flies' food. The treatment of Sal A prolonged the lifespan of 
Aβ-expressing flies reared on MP-supplemented food significantly (P < 0.001), 
but not those without MP. The lifespan of Sal B-treated flies did not show a 
significant difference compared to untreated flies for both groups reared on 
food with and without MP. Sal A-treated flies in the presence of MP exhibited a 
lower abundance of Corynebacterium and Enterococcus than the untreated flies, 
while Lactiplantibacillus was the most dominant taxa. Urea cycle was predicted 
to be predominant in this group compared to the untreated group. The control 
group, Aβ-expressing flies treated with Sal A and Sal B on MP-supplemented food 
had improved lifespan compared to their respective groups reared on food without 
MP, while untreated Aβ-expressing flies was the exception. The gut microbiota 
composition of flies reared on MP-supplemented food was also significantly 
different from those without MP (P < 0.001).

Cognitive impairment is often found at the acute stages and sequelae of 
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the underlying mechanisms remain 
unclear. The S1 protein from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2) might be a cause of cognitive impairment associated with COVID-19. 
The nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich-containing family, pyrin 
domain-containing-3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and neuroinflammation play important 
roles in Alzheimer's disease (AD) with cognitive impairment. However, their 
roles remain unknown in COVID-19 with cognitive impairment. We stimulated BV2 
cells with S1 protein in vitro and injected the hippocampi of wild-type (WT) 
mice, NLRP3 knockout (KO), and microglia NLRP3 KO mice in vivo with S1 protein 
to induce cognitive impairment. We assessed exploratory behavior as associative 
memory using novel object recognition and Morris water maze tests. 
Neuroinflammation was analyzed using immunofluorescence and western blotting to 
detect inflammatory markers. Co-localized NLRP3 and S1 proteins were 
investigated using confocal microscopy. We found that S1 protein injection led 
to cognitive impairment, neuronal loss, and neuroinflammation by activating 
NLRP3 inflammation, and this was reduced by global NLRP3 KO and microglia NLRP3 
KO. Furthermore, TAK 242, a specific inhibitor of Toll-like receptor-4, resulted 
in a significant reduction in NLRP3 and pro-IL-1β in BV2 cells with S1 protein 
stimulation. These results reveal a distinct mechanism through which the 
SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 protein promotes NLRP3 inflammasome activation and induces 
excessive inflammatory responses.

Small GTPases Ras, Rac, and RhoA are crucial regulators of cellular functions. 
They also act in dysregulated cell proliferation and transformation. Multiple 
publications have focused on illuminating their roles and mechanisms, including 
in immune system pathologies. Their functions in neurology-related diseases, 
neurodegeneration and neurodevelopment, are also emerging, as well as their 
potential as pharmacological targets in both pathologies. Observations 
increasingly suggest that these pathologies may relate to activation (or 
suppression) of signaling by members of the Ras superfamily, especially Ras, 
Rho, and Rac isoforms, and components of their signaling pathways. Germline (or 
embryonic) mutations that they harbor are responsible for neurodevelopmental 
disorders, such as RASopathies, autism spectrum disorder, and dilated 
cardiomyopathy. In aging, they promote neurodegenerative diseases, with Rho 
GTPase featuring in their pharmacology, as in the case of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). Significantly, drugs with observed anti-AD activity, particularly those 
involved in cardiovascular systems, are associated with the RhoA signaling, as 
well as cerebral vasculature in brain development and aging. This leads us to 
suggest that anti-AD drugs could inform neurodevelopmental disorders, including 
pediatric low-grade gliomas pharmacology. Neurodevelopmental disorders 
associated with RhoA, like autism, are also connected with vascular systems, 
thus could be targets of vascular system-connected drugs.

Despite the importance of supporting older spousal caregivers (OSCs) of people 
with Alzheimer's Disease (PWAD), little evidence is available about the process 
of its occurrence in Middle Eastern countries, such as Iran. Understanding this 
process will help support more effectively. This study explored the support 
process for OSCs of PWAD using the grounded theory approach of Corbin and 
Strauss (2015). A total of 16 participants (10 caregivers, six formal and 
informal resources) were recruited using purposive and theoretical sampling 
methods, and in-depth interviews were conducted with them. Getting sincere and 
efficient support was the core category and was achieved through four 
strategies, which were thoughtful support-seeking, informal support-getting, 
formal seasonal support-getting, and informal support-devoting. Despite OSCs' 
vital need for multiple support, specific factors and conditions impair the 
support process. Healthcare providers and policymakers can use the results to 
make informed decisions and provide more practical support for these older 
caregivers.

One of the significant therapeutic targets for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is 
Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3β (GSK-3β). Inhibition of GSK-3β can prevent 
hyperphosphorylation of tau, and thus prevent formation and accumulation of 
neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads that block intracellular transport, 
trigger unfolded protein response, and increase oxidative stress, cumulatively 
leading to neurodegeneration. In this study, we have performed structure-based 
virtual screening of two small-molecule libraries from ChemDiv CNS databases 
using AutoDock Vina to identify hit molecules based on their binding affinities 
compared to that of an established GSK-3β inhibitor, indirubin-3'-monoxime 
(IMO). Pharmacoinformatic screening on SwissADME and pkCSM servers enabled 
identification of lead molecules with favorable pharmacoinformatic properties 
for drug likeliness, including blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability. Further, 
molecular dynamic simulations identified six candidate lead molecules that show 
stable complex formation with GSK-3β in dynamic state under physiological 
conditions. Principal component analysis of the dynamic state was used to plot 
Free Energy Landscapes (FELs) of GSK-3β-ligand complexes. STRIDE secondary 
structure analysis of the lowest energy conformations identified from FEL plots, 
and binding free energy calculations by Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann 
Surface Area ((ΔGbind)MM-PBSA) of the simulation trajectories led to the 
identification of two ligands as potential lead molecules having favorable free 
energy landscape profiles as well as significantly lower (ΔGbind)MM-PBSA in 
dynamic state compared to that of reference inhibitor IMO. Hence, this study 
identifies two novel brain penetrant GSK-3β inhibitors that are likely to have 
therapeutic potential against Alzheimer's disease.

Computer-vision and machine-learning (ML) approaches are being developed to 
provide scalable, unbiased, and sensitive methods to assess mouse behavior. 
Here, we used the ML-based variational animal motion embedding (VAME) 
segmentation platform to assess spontaneous behavior in humanized App knockin 
and transgenic APP models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to test the role of 
AD-related neuroinflammation in these behavioral manifestations. We found marked 
alterations in spontaneous behavior in AppNL-G-F and 5xFAD mice, including 
age-dependent changes in motif utilization, disorganized behavioral sequences, 
increased transitions, and randomness. Notably, blocking fibrinogen-microglia 
interactions in 5xFAD-Fggγ390-396A mice largely prevented spontaneous behavioral 
alterations, indicating a key role for neuroinflammation. Thus, AD-related 
spontaneous behavioral alterations are prominent in knockin and transgenic 
models and sensitive to therapeutic interventions. VAME outcomes had 
higher specificity and sensitivity than conventional behavioral outcomes. We 
conclude that spontaneous behavior effectively captures age- and sex-dependent 
disease manifestations and treatment efficacy in AD models.

Black family caregivers of persons with dementia experience high levels of 
stress that can negatively affect caregiver health outcomes and reduce 
caregiving capacity. However, Black caregivers tend to report low levels 
depressive symptoms or other negative health effects. This qualitative 
descriptive study aimed to identify factors that contribute to resilience among 
Black family caregivers. Using the rigorous and accelerated data reduction 
(RADaR) technique to complete thematic analysis, a team of five coders examined 
transcript data from three focus groups of Black current and former family 
caregivers (n = 17) of persons with dementia. We identified three primary 
factors that contributed to caregiver resilience including access to supportive 
environments, adaptability, and planning skills. Caregiver resistance to 
reporting depressive symptoms may be attributed to the strong Black woman 
schema. Findings from this study may be used to develop future culturally 
responsive interventions that support caregivers and promote family health.

BACKGROUND: Tau-PET is a diagnostic tool with high sensitivity and specificity 
for discriminating Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia from other 
neurodegenerative disorders in well-controlled research environments. The role 
of tau-PET in real-world clinical practice, however, remains to be established. 
The aim of the TAP-TAU study is therefore to investigate the impact of tau-PET 
in clinical practice.
METHODS: TAP-TAU is a prospective, longitudinal multi-center study in 300 
patients (≥ 50 years old) with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia across 
five Dutch memory clinics. Patients are eligible if diagnostic certainty is 
< 85% after routine dementia screening and if the differential diagnosis 
includes AD. More specifically, we will include patients who (i) are suspected 
of having mixed pathology (e.g., AD and vascular pathology), (ii) have an 
atypical clinical presentation, and/or (iii) show conflicting or inconclusive 
outcomes on other tests (e.g., magnetic resonance imaging or cerebrospinal 
fluid). Participants will undergo a [18F]flortaucipir tau-PET scan, blood-based 
biomarker sampling, and fill out questionnaires on patient reported outcomes and 
experiences. The primary outcomes are change (pre- versus post- tau-PET) in 
diagnosis, diagnostic certainty, patient management and patient anxiety and 
uncertainty. Secondary outcome measures are head-to-head comparisons between 
tau-PET and less invasive and lower cost diagnostic tools such as novel 
blood-based biomarkers and artificial intelligence-based classifiers.
RESULTS: TAP-TAU has been approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the 
Amsterdam UMC. The first participant is expected to be included in October 2024.
CONCLUSIONS: In TAP-TAU, we will investigate the added clinical value of tau-PET 
in a real-world clinical setting, including memory clinic patients with 
diagnostic uncertainty after routine work-up. Findings of our study may 
contribute to recommendations regarding which patients would benefit most from 
assessment with tau-PET. This study is timely in the dawning era of disease 
modifying treatments as an accurate etiological diagnosis becomes increasingly 
important.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial is registered and authorized on December 21st,

BACKGROUND: Analysis of selected research cohorts has highlighted an association 
between plasma neurofilament light (NfL) protein and cross-sectional cognitive 
impairment as well as longitudinal cognitive decline. However, the findings have 
yielded inconsistent results regarding its possible application in clinical 
practice. Despite its potential prognostic significance, the role of plasma NfL 
in daily clinical practice with unselected patients suffering from cognitive 
impairment remains largely unexplored.
METHODS: This retrospective, cross-sectional and longitudinal monocentric study 
enrolled 320 patients with Alzheimer's disease ([AD], n = 158), dementia with 
Lewy body ([DLB], n = 30), frontotemporal dementia ([FTD], n = 32), 
non-neurodegenerative diseases ([NND], n = 59) or subjective cognitive decline 
([SCD], n = 41). Plasma NfL levels were measured at baseline on the Simoa 
platform. AD, DLB, and FTD patients were also analyzed altogether as a 
'degenerative conditions' subgroup, whereas SCD and NND were grouped as a 
'non-degenerative conditions' subgroup. We assessed the relationship between 
plasma NfL levels and cross-sectional cognitive performance, including global 
cognition and six specific cognitive domains. A subset of 239 patients had 
follow-up mini-mental state examinations (MMSE) up to 60 months. Models were 
adjusted on age, education level, glomerular filtration rate and body mass 
index.
RESULTS: In 320 patients, baseline plasma NfL levels were negatively associated 
with global cognition (β=-1.28 (-1.81 ; -0.75) P < 0.001), memory (β=-1.48 
(-2.38 ; -0.59), P = 0.001), language (β=-1.72(-2.49 ; -0.95) P < 0.001), praxis 
(β=-2.02 (-2.91 ; -1.13) P < 0.001) and executive functions (β=-0.81, 
P < 0.001). Across diagnosis, plasma NfL levels were negatively associated with 
cross-sectional global cognition in all but the SCD subgroup, specifically with 
executive functions and memory in AD (respectively β=-0.71(-1.21 ; -0.211), 
P = 0.005 and β=-1.29 (-2.17 ; -0.42), P = 0.004), and with attention in LBD 
(β=-0.81(-1.16 ; -0.002), P = 0.03). Linear mixed-effects models showed that 
plasma NfL predicted MMSE decline in the global population 
(βPlasmaNfLxTime=-0.15 (-0.26 ; -0.04), P = 0.006), as in the neurodegenerative 
condition subgroup (βPlasmaNfLxTime=-0.21 (-0.37 ; - 0.06), P = 0.007), but not 
in non-neurodegenerative condition subgroup.
CONCLUSION: In our clinical cohort, plasma NfL was associated with faster 
cognitive decline in neurodegenerative dementia, which corroborates data 
obtained in research cohorts. Yet, plasma NfL was not predictive of accelerated 
cognitive decline in individuals without neurodegeneration, suggesting its use 
as a neurodegeneration-specific predictive biomarker.

Extracellular vesicles, including exosomes, are small extracellular vesicles 
that range in size from 30 nm to 10 μm in diameter and have specific membrane 
markers. They are naturally secreted and are present in various bodily fluids, 
including blood, urine, and saliva, and through the variety of their internal 
cargo, they contribute to both normal physiological and pathological processes. 
These processes include immune modulation, neuronal synapse formation, cell 
differentiation, cancer metastasis, angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis, progression 
of infectious disease, and neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's and 
Parkinson's disease. In recent years, interest has grown in the use of exosomes 
as a potential drug delivery system for various diseases and injuries. 
Importantly, exosomes originating from a patient's own cells exhibit minimal 
immunogenicity and possess remarkable stability along with inherent and 
adjustable targeting capabilities. This review explores the roles of exosomes in 
angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis, and nerve repair with a specific emphasis on 
these processes within the cornea. Furthermore, it examines exosomes derived 
from specific cell types, discusses the advantages of exosome-based therapies in 
modulating these processes, and presents some of the most established methods 
for exosome isolation. Exosome-based treatments are emerging as potential 
minimally invasive and non-immunogenic therapies that modulate corneal 
angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, as well as enhance and accelerate endogenous 
corneal nerve repair.

Protein aggregation occurs as a consequence of dysfunction in the normal 
cellular proteostasis, which leads to the accumulation of toxic fibrillar 
aggregates of certain proteins in the cell. Enhancing the activity of 
proteolytic pathways may serve as a way of clearing these aggregates in a cell, 
and consequently, autophagy has surfaced as a promising target for the treatment 
of neurodegenerative disorders. Several strategies involving small molecule 
compounds that stimulate autophagic pathway of cell have been discovered. 
However, despite many compounds having demonstrated favorable outcomes in 
experimental disease models, the translation of these findings into clinical 
benefits for patient's remains limited. Consequently, alternative strategies are 
actively being explored to effectively target neurodegeneration via autophagy 
modulation. Recently, newer approaches such as modulation of expression of 
autophagic genes have emerged as novel and interesting areas of research in this 
field, which hold promising potential in neuroprotection. Similarly, as 
discussed for the first time in this review, the use of autophagy-inducing 
nanoparticles by utilizing their physicochemical properties to stimulate the 
autophagic process, rather than relying on their role as drug carriers, offers a 
completely fresh avenue for targeting neurodegeneration without the risk of 
drug-associated adverse effects. This review provides fresh perspectives on 
developing autophagy-targeted therapies for neurodegenerative disorders. 
Additionally, it discusses the challenges and impediments of implementing these 
strategies to alleviate the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders in 
clinical settings and highlights the prospects and directions of future research 
in this context.

Yamanaka factors (YFs) can reverse some aging features in mammalian tissues, but 
their effects on the brain remain largely unexplored. Here, we induced YFs in 
the mouse brain in a controlled spatiotemporal manner in two different 
scenarios: brain development and adult stages in the context of 
neurodegeneration. Embryonic induction of YFs perturbed cell identity of both 
progenitors and neurons, but transient and low-level expression is tolerated by 
these cells. Under these conditions, YF induction led to progenitor expansion, 
an increased number of upper cortical neurons and glia, and enhanced motor and 
social behavior in adult mice. Additionally, controlled YF induction is 
tolerated by principal neurons in the adult dorsal hippocampus and prevented the 
development of several hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease, including cognitive 
decline and altered molecular signatures, in the 5xFAD mouse model. These 
results highlight the powerful impact of YFs on neural proliferation and their 
potential use in brain disorders.

INTRODUCTION: Dementia, a term for a range of cognitive impairments impacting 
memory, thinking, and social abilities, represents a formidable challenge to 
healthcare systems worldwide. Analysing the temporal trends in dementia-related 
mortality among individuals, identifying the populations at high risk, and 
guiding the implementation of tailored interventions to address the escalating 
effects of dementia on public health.
METHODS: Data from CDC WONDER database was examined from 1999 to 2020 for the 
four causes of dementia mortality: unspecified dementia (F03), Alzheimer's 
disease (G30), vascular dementia (F01), and other degenerative diseases of 
nervous system not elsewhere classified (G31). Age-adjusted mortality rates 
(AAMRs) per 100,000 persons and annual percent change (APC) were calculated and 
stratified by geographic region, year, age groups, sex, and race/ethnicity.
RESULTS: A total of 4,077,973 reported deaths were related to dementia from 1999 
to 2020 in the United States. The greatest proportion of deaths was associated 
with Alzheimer's disease (45.9%), followed by unspecified dementia (43.8%). Very 
low proportion of deaths were associated with vascular dementia (4.9%) or other 
neurodegenerative diseases (5.3%). The AAMR increased in two distinct periods: a 
steep incline from 1999 to 2010 (APC: 6.95, 95% CI: 6.00-7.90), followed by a 
modest incline till 2020 (APC: 1.41, 95% CI: 0.80-2.04). Overall, females had a 
higher AAMR than males. AAMRs were highest among NH Whites patients and lowest 
in NH Asians or Pacific Islanders. A significant geographical difference was 
also observed among different US census regions. Nearly equal AAMRs were seen in 
non-metropolitan areas and metropolitan areas. States with AAMRs in the top 90th 
percentile included South Carolina, North Carolina, Maine, Tennessee, Georgia, 
and Alabama while states with AAMRs in the bottom 10th percentile included South 
Dakota, Florida, Hawaii, New Jersey, District of Columbia, and New York (33.1). 
Individuals aged above 85 had the highest AAMRs. Most deaths occurred in nursing 
homes and least in hospice facilities.
CONCLUSION: The dementia related deaths are continuously increasing. Highest 
AAMRs were observed among the NH White people, females, and in the southern 
areas of the United States. People aged 85+ were most affected. To stop the 
rising death rates, targeted interventions and awareness are required for both 
prevention and treatment of dementia.

Multimodal action of phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors against neurodegenerative 
disorders: An update review.

Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) is an enzyme primarily found in the smooth 
muscle of the corpus cavernosum and also highly expressed in the substantia 
nigra, cerebellum, caudate, hippocampal regions and cerebellar purkinje cells, 
responsible for selectively breaking down cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) 
into 5'-GMP and regulate intracellular cGMP levels. As a second messenger, 
cyclic GMP enhances signals at postsynaptic receptors and triggers downstream 
effector molecules, leading to changes in gene expression and neuronal 
responses. Additionally, cGMP signaling transduction cascade, present in the 
brain, is also essential for learning and memory processes. Mechanistically, 
PDE5 inhibitors share structural similarities with cGMP, competitively binding 
to PDE5 and inhibiting cGMP hydrolysis. This action enhances the effects of 
nitric oxide, resulting in anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. 
Neurodegenerative disorders entail the progressive loss of neuron structure, 
culminating in neuronal cell death, with currently available drugs providing 
only limited symptomatic relief, rendering neurodegeneration considered 
incurable. PDE5 inhibitors have recently emerged as a potential therapeutic 
approach for neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation, and diseases involving 
cognitive impairment. This review elucidates the principal roles of 3',5'-cyclic 
adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cGMP signaling pathways in neuronal 
functions, believed to play pivotal roles in the pathogenesis of various 
neurodegenerative disorders. It provides an updated assessment of PDE5 
inhibitors as disease-modifying agents for conditions such as Alzheimer's 
disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, cerebral ischemia, 
Huntington's disease, and neuroinflammation. The paper aims to review the 
current understanding of PDE5 inhibitors, which concurrently regulate both cAMP 
and cGMP signaling pathways, positing that they may exert complementary and 
synergistic effects in modifying neurodegeneration, thus presenting a novel 
direction in therapeutic discovery. Moreover, the review provides critical about 
biological functions, therapeutic potentials, limitations, challenges, and 
emerging applications of selective PDE5 inhibitors. This comprehensive overview 
aims to guide future academic and industrial endeavors in this field.

BACKGROUND: The activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is an early 
pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain, but how ER stress 
contributes to the onset and development of AD remains poorly characterized. 
Mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) is a non-canonical 
neurotrophic factor and an ER stress inducible protein. Previous studies 
reported that MANF is increased in the brains of both pre-symptomatic and 
symptomatic AD patients, but the consequence of the early rise in MANF protein 
is unknown.
METHODS: We examined the expression of MANF in the brain of AD mouse models at 
different pathological stages. Through behavioral, electrophysiological, and 
neuropathological analyses, we assessed the level of synaptic dysfunctions in 
the MANF transgenic mouse model which overexpresses MANF in the brain and in 
wild type (WT) mice with MANF overexpression in the hippocampus. Using proteomic 
and transcriptomic screening, we identified and validated the molecular 
mechanism underlying the effects of MANF on synaptic function.
RESULTS: We found that increased expression of MANF correlates with synapse loss 
in the hippocampus of AD mice. The ectopic expression of MANF in mice via 
transgenic or viral approaches causes synapse loss and defects in learning and 
memory. We also identified that MANF interacts with ELAV like RNA-binding 
protein 2 (ELAVL2) and affects its binding to RNA transcripts that are involved 
in synaptic functions. Increasing or decreasing MANF expression in the 
hippocampus of AD mice exacerbates or ameliorates the behavioral deficits and 
synaptic pathology, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study established MANF as a mechanistic link between ER stress 
and synapse loss in AD and hinted at MANF as a therapeutic target in AD 
treatment.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease characterized by 
progressive cognitive and physical impairment. Neuroinflammation is related to 
AD, and the misfolding and aggregation of amyloid protein in the brain creates 
an inflammatory microenvironment. Microglia are the predominant contributors to 
neuroinflammation, and abnormal activation of microglia induces the release of a 
large amount of inflammatory factors, promotes neuronal apoptosis, and leads to 
cognitive impairment. In this study, we used microglial membranes containing 
caffeic acid-coupled carbon quantum dots to prepare a novel biomimetic 
nanocapsule (CDs-CA-MGs) for the treatment of AD. The application of CDs-CA-MGs 
via nasal administration can bypass the blood‒brain barrier (BBB) and directly 
target the site of inflammation. After treatment with CDs-CA-MGs, AD mice showed 
reduced inflammation in the brain, decreased neuronal apoptosis, and 
significantly improved learning and memory abilities. In addition, CDs-CA-MGs 
affect inflammation-related JAK-STAT and Toll-like receptor signaling pathways 
in AD mice. CDs-CA-MGs significantly downregulated interleukins (IL-1β and IL-6) 
and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α). This finding suggested that CDs-CA-MGs may 
improve cognitive impairment by modulating inflammatory responses. In 
conclusion, the use of CDs-CA-MGs provides a possible therapeutic strategy for 
the treatment of AD.

Amyloid accumulation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with synaptic 
damage and altered connectivity in brain networks. While measures of amyloid 
accumulation and biochemical changes in mouse models have utility for 
translational studies of certain therapeutics, preclinical analysis of altered 
brain connectivity using clinically relevant fMRI measures has not been well 
developed for agents intended to improve neural networks. Here, we conduct a 
longitudinal study in a double knock-in mouse model for AD (AppNL-G-F/hMapt), 
monitoring brain connectivity by means of resting-state fMRI. While the 
4-month-old AD mice are indistinguishable from wild-type controls (WT), 
decreased connectivity in the default-mode network is significant for the AD 
mice relative to WT mice by 6 months of age and is pronounced by 9 months of 
age. In a second cohort of 20-month-old mice with persistent functional 
connectivity deficits for AD relative to WT, we assess the impact of two-months 
of oral treatment with a silent allosteric modulator of mGluR5 
(BMS-984923/ALX001) known to rescue synaptic density. Functional connectivity 
deficits in the aged AD mice are reversed by the mGluR5-directed treatment. The 
longitudinal application of fMRI has enabled us to define the preclinical time 
trajectory of AD-related changes in functional connectivity, and to demonstrate 
a translatable metric for monitoring disease emergence, progression, and 
response to synapse-rescuing treatment.

The Bio-Hermes Study was a cross-sectional observational study designed to 
develop a database of blood-based and digital biomarkers to improve detection of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We examined the 
ability of Cognivue Clarity to (a) detect MCI and AD in clinical diagnostics 
groups, (b) determine the presence of amyloid, and (c) distinguish between 
biomarker-confirmed groups. Bio-Hermes enrolled 887 participants who completed 
both Cognivue Clarity and amyloid PET scans (388 Cognitively Normal, 282 MCI, 
217 Probable AD). Cognivue Clarity differentiated between Cognitively Normal, 
MCI, and probable AD in clinical cohorts, amyloid positive from amyloid negative 
individuals, and True Controls from MCI due to AD and AD in biomarker-confirmed 
cohorts (all p < 0.001) with large effect sizes. Cognivue Clarity correlated 
with amyloid PET and plasma amyloid and pTau (all p < 0.001). In biomarker 
confirmed groups, Cognivue Clarity had a positive likelihood ratio of 2.17, a 
negative likelihood ratio of 0.29, and a diagnostic odds ratio of 7.48. Cognivue 
Clarity detected cognitive impairment and differentiated between both clinically 
and biomarker defined MCI and AD groups. The use of Cognivue Clarity could 
assist with identification of MCI-AD or AD for inclusion into current treatment 
protocols or for enriching recruitment into clinical trials. Trial registration

N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is a prevalent mRNA modification in eukaryotic cells, 
characterized by its reversible nature. YTH structural domain family protein 2 
(YTHDF2), a key reader of m6A, plays a crucial role in identifying and binding 
m6A-containing RNAs, thereby influencing RNA metabolism through various 
functional mechanisms. The upstream and downstream targets of YTHDF2 are 
critical in the pathogenesis of various central nervous system (CNS) diseases, 
affecting disease development by regulating signaling pathways and gene 
expression. This paper provides an overview of current research on the role of 
YTHDF2 in CNS diseases and investigates the regulatory mechanisms by which 
YTHDF2 influences the development of these conditions. This exploration aims to 
improve understanding of disease pathogenesis and offer novel insights for the 
targeted prevention and treatment of neurological disorders.

Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), an NAD+-dependent deacetylase, has emerged as a key regulator 
of cellular processes linked to ageing and neurodegeneration. SIRT1 modulates 
various signalling pathways, including those involved in autophagy, oxidative 
stress, and mitochondrial function, which are critical in the pathogenesis of 
neurodegenerative diseases. This review explores the therapeutic potential of 
SIRT1 in several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and Amyotrophic 
Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Preclinical studies have demonstrated that SIRT1 
activators, such as resveratrol, SRT1720, and SRT2104, can alleviate disease 
symptoms by reducing oxidative stress, enhancing autophagic flux, and promoting 
neuronal survival. Ongoing clinical trials are evaluating the efficacy of these 
SIRT1 activators, providing hope for future therapeutic strategies targeting 
SIRT1 in neurodegenerative diseases. This review explores the role of SIRT1 in 
ageing and neurodegenerative diseases, with a particular focus on its molecular 
mechanisms, therapeutic potential, and clinical applications.

Amyloidogenic transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis is a systemic disease 
characterized by the deposition of amyloid fibrils made of transthyretin. 
Transthyretin is primarily produced in tetrameric form by the liver, but also by 
retinal epithelium and choroid plexus. The deposition of these fibrils in the 
myocardium and peripheral nerves causes cardiomyopathies and neuropathies, 
respectively. Using cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM), we investigated fibrils 
extracted from cardiac and nerve tissues of an ATTRv-V30M patient. We found 
consistent fibril structures from both tissues, similar to cardiac fibrils 
previously described, but different from vitreous humor fibrils of the same 
genotype. Our findings, along with previous ATTR fibrils structural studies, 
suggest a uniform fibrillar architecture across different tissues when 
transthyretin originates from the liver. This study advances our understanding 
of how deposition and production sites influence fibril structure in ATTRv-V30M 
amyloidosis.

Disrupted circadian or 24-h rhythms are among the most common early findings in 
a wide range of neurodegenerative disorders. Once thought to be a mere 
consequence of the disease process, increasing evidence points toward a causal 
or contributory role of the circadian clock in neurodegenerative disease. 
Circadian clocks control many aspects of cellular biochemistry, including stress 
pathways implicated in neuronal survival and death. Given the dearth of 
disease-modifying therapies for these increasingly prevalent disorders, this 
understanding may lead to breakthroughs in the development of new treatments. In 
this review, we provide a background on circadian clocks and focus on some 
potential mechanisms that may be pivotal in neurodegeneration.

Behavioral intervention studies often lack sufficiently sensitive and frequent 
measurements to observe an effect. Remote passive sensing offers a highly 
sensitive, continuous, and ecologically valid method of assessment that 
increases the ability to detect changes in the daily activities and function of 
those being monitored. To be most effectively deployed in research studies, 
applications of remote assessment technology must be designed with the end user 
in mind. User-centered design (UCD) is especially important in clinical trials 
where the needs and characteristics of participants and research staff need to 
be uniquely considered to ensure the feasibility and acceptability of the study. 
This paper describes UCD issues in remote passive sensing that commonly arise 
among older adult participants-including those living with dementia-as well as 
any strategies that were taken to overcome them. Using exemplars from the 
National Institute on Aging-funded Roybal Center ORCASTRAIT (Oregon Roybal 
Center for Care Support Translational Research Advantaged by Integrating 
Technology), as well as other experimental and observational research studies 
conducted in community settings, this paper brings together our collective 
experiences with studies using remote passive sensing technology that 
incorporate a UCD design approach. Although passive sensing eliminates some 
common UCD issues that arise with higher-touch technology, issues, such as 
usability, trust, and aesthetic acceptability, still need to be addressed for 
behavioral interventions using passive sensing technology to be potent and 
implementable.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder responsible 
for over half of dementia cases, with two-thirds being women. Growing evidence 
from preclinical and clinical studies underscores the significance of 
sex-specific biological mechanisms in shaping AD risk. While older age is the 
greatest risk factor for AD, other distinct biological mechanisms increase the 
risk and progression of AD in women including sex hormones, brain structural 
differences, genetic background, immunomodulation and vascular disorders. 
Research indicates a correlation between declining estrogen levels during 
menopause and an increased risk of developing AD, highlighting a possible link 
with AD pathogenesis. The neuroprotective effects of estrogen vary with the age 
of treatment initiation, menopause stage, and type. This review assesses 
clinical and observational studies conducted in women, examining the influence 
of estrogen on cognitive function or addressing the ongoing question regarding 
the potential use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) as a preventive or 
therapeutic option for AD. This review covers recent literature and discusses 
the working hypothesis, current use, controversies and challenges regarding HRT 
in preventing and treating age-related cognitive decline and AD. The available 
evidence indicates that estrogen plays a significant role in influencing 
dementia risk, with studies demonstrating both beneficial and detrimental 
effects of HRT. Recommendations regarding HRT usage should carefully consider 
the age when the hormonal supplementation is initiated, baseline characteristics 
such as genotype and cardiovascular health, and treatment duration until this 
approach can be more thoroughly investigated or progress in the development of 
alternative treatments can be made.

Alzheimer's disease is a devastating neurodegenerative condition that exerts a 
significant global burden. Despite recent efforts, disease modifying therapies 
remain extremely limited, with a tremendous proportion of patients having to 
rely on symptomatic treatment only. Epidemiological and pathological overlaps 
exist between Alzheimer's disease and diabetes mellitus type 2, with people with 
diabetes mellitus type 2 at a significantly increased risk of developing 
Alzheimer's disease in the future. Incretin mimetics, also known as GLP-1/GIP 
receptor agonists, are useful tools licensed for the treatment of diabetes 
mellitus type 2 which have recently been the subject of news coverage for their 
off-label use as weight loss medications. Emerging evidence highlights the 
possible neuroprotective function of incretin mimetics in models of Alzheimer's 
disease as well as in clinical studies. This review details the pre-clinical and 
clinical studies that have explored the effectiveness of incretin mimetics to 
alleviate Alzheimer's disease associated pathology and cognitive impairment, 
while also highlighting the progress made to examine the effectiveness of these 
molecules in Parkinson's disease. Should clinical trials prove effective, 
incretin mimetics may be able to be repurposed and become useful novel tools as 
disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative 
diseases.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by cognitive decline, memory impairment, and behavioral changes, 
significantly impacting the quality of life of affected individuals and their 
caregivers. While pharmacological treatments offer limited relief, 
nonpharmacological interventions, like yoga, have gained attention for their 
potential therapeutic benefits. This critical review synthesizes findings from 
various studies on the feasibility, adherence, physical function, cognitive 
improvements, inflammatory markers, neuroprotection, and mood and behavioral 
changes associated with yoga interventions for older adults with AD. Despite 
these promising results, further research with randomized controlled trials, 
larger sample sizes, control groups, longitudinal follow-ups, standardized 
protocols, and diverse populations is necessary to confirm these benefits and 
understand the long-term effects of yoga on AD progression. This critical review 
highlights yoga's potential as a valuable nonpharmacological intervention in the 
holistic management of AD.

Drug repurposing is a methodology used to identify new clinical indications for 
existing drugs developed for other indications and has been successfully applied 
in the treatment of numerous conditions. Alzheimer's disease (AD) may be 
particularly well-suited to the application of drug repurposing methods given 
the absence of effective therapies and abundance of multi-omic data that has 
been generated in AD patients recently that may facilitate discovery of 
candidate AD drugs. A recent focus of drug repurposing has been in the 
application of pharmacoepidemiologic approaches to drug evaluation. Here, 
real-world clinical datasets with large numbers of patients are leveraged to 
establish observational efficacy of candidate drugs for further evaluation in 
disease models and clinical trials. In this review, we provide a selected 
overview of methods for drug repurposing, including signature matching, network 
analysis, molecular docking, phenotypic screening, semantic network, and 
pharmacoepidemiological analyses. Numerous methods have also been applied 
specifically to AD with the aim of nominating novel drug candidates for 
evaluation. These approaches, however, are prone to numerous limitations and 
potential biases that we have sought to address in the Drug Repurposing for 
Effective Alzheimer's Medicines (DREAM) study, a multi-step framework for 
selection and validation of potential drug candidates that has demonstrated the 
promise of STAT3 inhibitors and re-evaluated evidence for other drug candidates, 
such as phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Taken together, drug repurposing holds 
significant promise for development of novel AD therapeutics, particularly as 
the pace of data generation and development of analytical methods continue to 
accelerate.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by 
gradual and progressive cognitive decline leading to dementia. At its core, the 
neuropathological features of AD include hallmark accumulations of amyloid-β and 
hyperphosphorylated tau proteins. Other harmful processes, such as oxidative 
stress and inflammation, contribute to the disease's neuropathological 
progression. This review evaluates the role of oxidative stress in AD, placing a 
spotlight on the disappointing outcomes of various antioxidant clinical trials. 
Several hypotheses are discussed that might elucidate the failures of these 
therapies in AD. Specifically: 1) The paradoxical and overlooked harmful 
implications of prooxidant intermediates, particularly stemming from 
conventional antioxidants like vitamins E and C; 2) The challenges and failure 
to appreciate the issue of bioavailability-epitomized by the dictum "no on-site 
protection, no protection"-and the preeminent, yet often ignored, role played by 
endogenous antioxidant enzymes in combating oxidative stress; 3) The influence 
of unrecognized etiologies, such as latent infectious agents and others, as 
foundational drivers of oxidative stress in AD; 4) The underestimation of the 
complexity of oxidative mechanisms and the necessity of multi-targeted 
therapeutic approaches, such as those provided by various diets; and 5) The 
limitations of clinical trial designs in fully capturing the effects of 
antioxidants on AD progression. This article also examines the outcomes of 
select clinical trials while highlighting the challenges and barriers these 
therapies pose, offering insights into potential mechanisms to overcome their 
marginal success.

Nervous system growth factors are natural proteins of the brain that influence 
neuronal survival and function throughout life, from embryonic development to 
old age. In animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the growth factor brain 
derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) prevents neuronal death, activates neuronal 
function, builds new synapses and improves learning and memory. Accordingly, we 
are determining whether gene delivery of BDNF in patients with AD will slow 
disease progression and improve memory. In a previous clinical trial of nerve 
growth factor (NGF) gene therapy in AD patients (NCT00017940, June 2001), we 
learned that growth factors can unequivocally elicit classic trophic responses 
from degenerating neurons in AD. Experience gained from the earlier NGF gene 
therapy trial is guiding our effort to optimize gene delivery of BDNF in our 
present clinical program (NCT05040217, June 2021).

BACKGROUND: Metformin is a safe and effective medication for type 2 diabetes 
(T2D) that has been proposed to decrease the risk of aging related disorders 
including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Alzheimer's disease related 
disorders(ADRD).
OBJECTIVE: This review seeks to summarize findings from studies examining the 
association of metformin with AD/ADRD related outcomes.
METHODS: This is a narrative review of human studies, including observational 
studies and clinical trials, examining the association of metformin with 
cognitive and brain outcomes. We used PubMed as the main database for our 
literature search with a focus on English language human studies including 
observational studies and clinical trials. We prioritized studies published from 
2013 until February 15, 2024.
RESULTS: Observational human studies are conflicting, but those with better 
study designs suggest that metformin use in persons with T2D is associated with 
a lower risk of dementia. However, these observational studies are limited by 
the use of administrative data to ascertain metformin use and/or cognitive 
outcomes. There are few clinical trials in persons without T2D that have small 
sample sizes and short durations but suggest that metformin could prevent 
AD/ADRD. There are ongoing studies including large clinical trials with long 
duration that are testing the effect of metformin on AD/ADRD outcomes in persons 
without T2D at risk for dementia.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinical trial results are needed to establish the effect of 
metformin on the risk of AD and ADRD.

Treating Alzheimer's Disease: Focusing on Neurodegenerative Consequences.

Neurodegenerative disorders involve progressive dysfunction and loss of synapses 
and neurons and brain atrophy, slowly declining memories and cognitive skills, 
throughout a long process. Alzheimer's disease (AD), the leading 
neurodegenerative disorder, suffers from a lack of effective therapeutic drugs. 
Decades of efforts targeting its pathologic hallmarks, amyloid plaques and 
neurofibrillary tangles, in clinical trials have produced therapeutics with 
marginal benefits that lack meaningful clinical improvements in cognition. 
Delivering meaningful clinical therapeutics to treat or prevent 
neurodegenerative disorders thus remains a great challenge to scientists and 
clinicians. Emerging evidence, however, suggests that dysfunction of various 
synaptogenic signaling pathways participates in the neurodegenerative 
progression, resulting in deterioration of operation/structure of the synaptic 
networks involved in cognition. These derailed endogenous signaling pathways and 
disease processes are potential pharmacological targets for the therapies. 
Therapeutics with meaningful clinical benefit in cognition may depend on the 
effectiveness of arresting and reversing the neurodegenerative process through 
these targets. In essence, promoting neuro-regeneration may represent the only 
option to recover degenerated synapses and neurons. These potential directions 
in clinical trials for AD therapeutics with meaningful clinical benefit in 
cognitive function are summarized and discussed.

This article examines the relationship between cholesterol levels and 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), beginning with the early observation that individuals 
who died from heart attacks often had brain amyloid deposition. Subsequent 
animal model research proved that high cholesterol could hasten amyloid 
accumulation. In contrast, cholesterol-lowering treatments appeared to 
counteract this effect. Human autopsy studies reinforced the cholesterol-AD 
connection, revealing that higher cholesterol levels during midlife 
significantly correlated with higher brain amyloid pathology. This effect was 
especially pronounced in individuals aged 40 to 55. Epidemiological data 
supported animal research and human tissue observations and suggested that 
managing cholesterol levels in midlife could reduce the risk of developing AD. 
We analyze the main observational studies and clinical trials on the efficacy of 
statins. While observational data often suggest a potential protective effect 
against AD, clinical trials have not consistently shown benefit. The failure of 
these trials to demonstrate a clear advantage is partially attributed to 
multiple factors, including the timing of statin therapy, the type of statin and 
the appropriate selection of patients for treatment. Many studies failed to 
target individuals who might benefit most from early intervention, such as 
high-risk patients like APOE4 carriers. The review addresses how cholesterol is 
implicated in AD through various biological pathways, the potential preventive 
role of cholesterol management as suggested by observational studies, and the 
difficulties encountered in clinical trials, particularly related to statin use. 
The paper highlights the need to explore alternate therapeutic targets and 
mechanisms that escape statin intervention.
