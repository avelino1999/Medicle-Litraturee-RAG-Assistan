BACKGROUND: Multimodal lifestyle interventions might help to maintain healthy 
cognition in older age and to delay onset of dementia. Here, we studied the 
effects of a multi-modal lifestyle-based intervention, based on the FINGER 
trial, on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers of hippocampal-limbic atrophy 
and cerebral small vessel disease in older adults at increased risk for dementia 
in Germany.
METHODS: Leipzig participants of the multicenter AgeWell.de randomized 
controlled trial underwent neuroimaging before and after a two year intervention 
at 3 Tesla MRI. We extracted hippocampal volume and entorhinal cortex thickness 
(ECT), free water fraction (FW), peak width of skeletonized mean diffusivity 
(PSMD), white matter hyperintensity volume and mean gray matter cerebral blood 
flow and assessed the effect of the intervention on these imaging markers using 
linear mixed models. We also tested the effect of the intervention on the 
hippocampus-dependent Mnemonic Similarity Test and fixel-based white matter 
microstructure.
RESULTS: 56 individuals (mean (sd) age: 68.8 (4.2) years, 26 females, 24/32 
intervention/control group) were included at baseline and 41 returned after an 
average of 28 months for the second assessment. ECT and FW exhibited stronger 
decline in the intervention compared to the control group in preregistered 
models but not when adjusted for baseline differences. All other markers 
progressed similarly across groups, however sample size was smaller than 
expected. In exploratory analyses, cerebral blood flow increased more in the 
intervention group and this change was associated with decreases in systolic 
blood pressure.
CONCLUSIONS: In this group of older adults at risk for dementia, we find no 
conclusive evidence whether a multi-modal lifestyle intervention improves brain 
imaging markers of neurodegeneration and small vessel disease. Preliminary 
evidence suggested an association of the intervention, increased cerebral blood 
flow and systolic blood pressure reductions.

INTRODUCTION: Loneliness is linked to poor life quality and health, but its 
relevance in Parkinson's disease (PD) is incompletely understood. The current 
study aimed to understand rates of loneliness and its determinants in PD.
METHODS: Consecutive cross-sectional sampling resulted in 178 PD subjects (60 % 
men) across disease stages (86 % early-stage) with gold-standard diagnoses. 
Loneliness was characterized with two scales, PD was characterized by objective 
measures, motor ratings, and perceived functional impact, and social-emotional 
assessment included social connection, depression, and life space. Nonparametric 
bivariate and robust multivariate regression determined predictors of loneliness 
in PD, and social-emotional predictors of PD functional impact.
RESULTS: Most participants had concern, with 64.6 % endorsing high levels of 
loneliness. PD stage, but not motor impairment or other objective measures, 
predicted loneliness. In contrast, subjective measures of PD functional impact, 
social network size, social support, depression, and life space had a 
significant relationship with loneliness. In multivariate models, depression, PD 
functional impact, and social network size specifically emerged as the most 
important predictors of loneliness. Although social loneliness was generally 
more impacted by PD, men had more emotional loneliness. Similarly, loneliness 
was a potent, independent predictor of PD functional impact.
CONCLUSIONS: We show that loneliness is a critical issue in PD which relates 
more to individual response to disease than objective motor severity. Although 
PD most impacts general relationships' quality, men may have additional loss of 
intimate confidantes. Interventions targeting depression and social networks may 
not only improve loneliness but also improve PD functional impact.

Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation are key contributors to the development 
of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Lycopene 
(LYC) has demonstrated effectiveness in inhibiting inflammatory and oxidative 
stress markers and appears to exert a modulatory impact on several physiological 
pathways, behavioral manifestations, and cognitive symptoms associated with AD 
in animal models. In the present study, an AD model was established in male 
Wistar albino rats through daily oral administration of hydrated aluminum 
chloride (AlCl₃·6H₂O) at a dose of 75 mg/kg for six weeks. A Morris water maze 
(MWM) behavioral test was conducted to confirm memory impairment and cognitive 
deterioration in the treated rats. Animals exhibiting cognitive dysfunction were 
subsequently treated with LYC (5 mg/kg orally) for an additional six weeks, 
followed by a second MWM test before sacrifice. The findings revealed that LYC 
significantly enhanced performance and cognitive function in the AD model rats 
and markedly (p < 0.001) reduced the accumulation of amyloid β1-42, 
proinflammatory mediators [interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis 
factor-alpha (TNF-α)], malondialdehyde (MDA), and nitrite levels. Furthermore, 
LYC significantly (p < 0.001) decreased the acetylcholine (ACh) concentration, 
monoamine oxidase (MAO), creatine kinase (CK), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 
activites. Additionally, LYC significantly (p < 0.001) increased the 
acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 
2 (Nrf2), serotonin, anti-inflammatory mediators [transforming growth factor 
beta-1 (TGF-β1) and interleukin-10 (IL-10)] levels, superoxide dismutase (SOD), 
and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities. The therapeutic efficacy of LYC was 
further supported by improvements in the histopathological appearance of brain 
tissues, significant (p < 0.001) enhancement of synaptophysin 
immunohistochemical expression, and suppression of the immunohistochemical 
expression of cell cycle-related proteins (Ki67 and proliferating cell nuclear 
antigen [PCNA]). In conclusion, LYC may represent a promising therapeutic agent 
for AD by targeting multiple pathogenic mechanisms.

Drug repositioning, which identifies novel therapeutic applications for existing 
drugs, offers a cost-effective alternative to traditional drug development. 
However, effectively capturing the complex relationships between drugs and 
diseases remains challenging. We present HGCL-DR, a novel heterogeneous graph 
contrastive learning framework for drug repositioning that effectively 
integrates global and local feature representations through three key 
components. First, we introduce an improved heterogeneous graph contrastive 
learning approach to model drug-disease relationships. Second, for local feature 
extraction, we employ a bidirectional graph convolutional network with a 
subgraph generation strategy in the bipartite drug-disease association graph, 
while utilizing a graph diffusion process to capture long-range dependencies in 
drug-drug and disease-disease relation graphs. Third, for global feature 
extraction, we leverage contrastive learning in the heterogeneous graph to 
enhance embedding consistency across different feature spaces. Extensive 
experiments on four benchmark data sets using 10-fold cross-validation 
demonstrate that HGCL-DR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in 
both AUPR, AUROC, and F1-score metrics. Ablation studies confirm the 
significance of each proposed component, while case studies on Alzheimer's 
disease and breast neoplasms validate HGCL-DR's practical utility in identifying 
novel drug candidates. These results establish HGCL-DR as an effective approach 
for computational drug repositioning.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases 
worldwide. It is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques 
in which Aβ42 is the most toxic and aggressive species. This work investigates 
the possibility of salvianolic acid B (SalB), a natural compound with 
established neuroprotective activity, to counteract the Aβ42-induced toxicity in 
a Drosophila melanogaster model of AD. SalB's effect was assessed in the 
Aβ42-expressing Drosophila model by measuring three major AD-related behavioural 
symptoms: eye morphology (cytotoxicity), lifespan, and locomotor activity. The 
eye assay, longevity, and locomotion assays were employed, followed by RNA 
sequencing (RNA-seq) to identify molecular alterations following SalB treatment. 
Aβ42 expression in the Aβ42-expressing Drosophila model resulted in deformed eye 
morphology, reduced lifespan, and motor impairment. Treatment with SalB restored 
part of eye morphology, extended lifespan, and improved locomotion. RNA-seq 
revealed differential gene expression in oxidative phosphorylation, glutathione 
metabolism, and detoxification processes, suggesting the involvement of 
antioxidant defence in SalB-mediated neuroprotection. These findings indicate 
that SalB could be therapeutic for AD and other neurodegenerative disorders, 
possibly through the modulation of oxidative stress against Aβ42 toxicity. 
Further research is warranted to address its mechanisms and other uses in 
neurodegenerative therapy.

The relationship between hearing impairment and dementia has attracted 
significant attention, the 2024 Lancet Commission report identifying hearing 
loss as the largest modifiable risk factor for dementia from mid-life. The 
nature of this linkage between dementia and hearing remains unclear and is 
likely to be complex. In principle, hearing impairment could cause (directly 
promote), catalyze (amplify) or be a consequence of neurodegenerative pathology 
and cognitive decline. Here we use this framework to examine different lines of 
evidence for the association between hearing impairment and dementia, and 
consider how this evidence speaks to potential mechanisms and treatment 
implications. We conclude by considering practical clinical implications for 
management of patients with hearing impairment and dementia, the potential role 
for central hearing tests as 'auditory biomarkers' of dementia, and the need for 
further collaborative and mechanistically motivated research in this area.

A core tenant of the Geriatric Emergency care Applied Research Network 
2.0-Advancing Dementia Care (GEAR 2.0-ADC) is the inclusion of community members 
during all stages of clinical research. As such, we deliberately integrated and 
supported patient and public involvement in the evaluation and selection of GEAR 
2.0-ADC Pilot Research Grants by developing and adapting traditional grant 
application review structures, with input from community members, to create the 
GEAR 2.0-ADC Community Review Committee approach. Community members, including 
persons living with dementia, effectively participated in all three rounds of 
research grant application review and selection, complementing the traditional 
scientific review process. The structure and flexibility of the GEAR 2.0-ADC 
Community Review Committee approach serve as a model for patient and public 
grant application review involvement with strong potential for applications 
across grant reviews in other medical specialties.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a formidable challenge, impacting individuals, 
families, caregivers, and soci- ety. Despite being identified over a century 
ago, effective drug treatments for AD remain elusive, with numerous clinical 
trials failing to produce meaningful results. The pathological hallmarks of AD, 
including the accumulation of beta-amyloid plaques and tau protein tangles, are 
well-established contributors to cogni- tive decline. However, recent research 
has raised questions about the efficacy of therapies targeting these 
abnormalities. Emerging evidence suggests that AD should not be viewed purely as 
a brain-centered disease but as a systemic condition involving complex 
interactions between the brain and peripheral organs. While the mechanisms 
linking peripheral processes and AD pathology remain unclear, studies indicate 
that these systems may contribute to or be affected by the disease. Recognizing 
AD as a heterogeneous disorder with systemic implications opens new 
opportunities for therapeutic innovation. Multimodal therapies targeting both 
central and peripheral aspects of AD pathology-such as amyloid-beta deposition, 
neuroinflammation, and systemic dysfunction-hold promise for slowing disease 
progression. This review aims to critically assess the current understanding of 
AD pathology, with a particular focus on the peripheral system's involvement and 
its interplay with the brain. Additionally, it will explore novel therapeutic 
strategies and emphasize the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration to 
advance our knowledge and develop effective treatments.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), characterized by β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and 
neurofibrillary tangles, is the leading cause of dementia globally. Donanemab is 
a humanized immunoglobulin G1 in development as a treatment to slow AD 
progression. This study aimed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, 
pharmacokinetics (PKs), and immunogenicity of donanemab in healthy Chinese 
adults. The study included screening, inpatient, and follow-up periods. 
Following successful screening, participants were assigned to one of three 
donanemab cohorts (350, 700, or 1400 mg) and randomized in a 5:1 ratio to 
receive donanemab or placebo. Participants received a single intravenous (IV) 
dose of donanemab or placebo, and the safety, PKs, and immunogenicity of 
donanemab were monitored. A total of 36 male Chinese participants were included. 
All treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were mild in severity. Two 
participants on 350 mg donanemab experienced treatment-related TEAEs. Serum 
concentrations decreased over time with dose-dependent PK parameters (Cmax, 
t1/2, AUC0-tlast, and AUC0-inf) as expected. Clearance values were similar 
across doses. All donanemab recipients developed treatment-emergent antidrug 
antibodies (ADAs) in the inpatient and follow-up periods, with similar ADA titer 
ranges across all donanemab doses. Single IV doses of donanemab 350, 700, and 
1400 mg showed acceptable safety, tolerability, and dose-proportional PK in 
healthy Chinese adults.

Tau hyperphosphorylation represents a critical pathological hallmark of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder characterized 
by progressive cognitive decline. The ubiquitin-specific proteases 14 (USP14) 
impairs proteasomal function and accelerates hyperphosphorylated Tau 
accumulation, making it an attractive therapeutic target for modulating the 
ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in AD treatment. In this study, it is reported that 
wogonoside-functionalized ultrasmall Cu2-xSe nanoparticles (CSPW NPs) 
significantly reduce hyperphosphorylated Tau accumulation and alleviate AD 
symptoms. The therapeutic mechanism involves activation of the 
ubiquitin-proteasome pathway through USP14 inhibition by CSPW NPs, thereby 
preventing hyperphosphorylated Tau accumulation. Furthermore, after cell 
membrane coating (CSPW@CM NPs), these nanoparticles efficiently cross the 
blood-brain barrier with focused ultrasound assistance and accumulate in the 
brain to target neurons. Within neurons, they inhibit USP14, reduce 
phosphorylated Tau deposition, enhance microtubule stability, mitigate synaptic 
loss, restore synaptic integrity, and ultimately alleviate cognitive dysfunction 
in AD mice. The findings highlight the substantial potential of USP14 modulation 
for mitigating Tau hyperphosphorylation in the treatment of AD and related 
tauopathies.

BACKGROUND: In 2024, Alzheimer's disease affected approximately 6.9 million 
Americans aged 65 and older. Current therapies include acetylcholinesterase 
inhibitors, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor inhibitors, and monoclonal antibodies. 
With an economic burden surpassing $345 billion, $222 billion borne by Medicare 
and Medicaid, this study evaluates lecanemab's budgetary impact for early AD, 
including subgroup analyses by gender and race.
METHODS: A budget impact model evaluated LECA for early Alzheimer's disease, 
comparing scenarios with and without the therapy. Inputs included market share, 
costs, duration, and compliance. Gender and race subgroup analyses, annual 
costs, PMPM, PTMPM, and sensitivity analysis outcomes were assessed to explore 
parameter-driven variability comprehensively.
RESULTS: Introducing LECA for over 3.5 million eligible early AD patients in the 
U.S. may generate a three-year budget impact of $4.1 billion for Medicare. 
Incremental PMPM savings were $1.4, and PTMPM savings reached $24.1. Subgroup 
analyses revealed no significant gender or racial differences in PMPM and PTMPM, 
with variability only in overall budget impact. Sensitivity analyses indicate 
that enhanced healthcare resource utilization, reduced disease severity, and 
improved cost-efficiency among males contribute to strengthening Medicare's 
budget sustainability.
CONCLUSIONS: Utilizing LECA as a treatment for early AD is expected to be cost 
saving with respect to Medicare budgets in the U.S.

Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases are the most common neurodegenerative 
disorders, causing significant disability and mortality worldwide. Though 
traditionally classified as Tau and α-synuclein-related disorders, respectively, 
there is growing evidence of clinical overlap between dementia and Parkinsonism, 
with comorbidity worsening cognitive impairment and prognosis. Emerging research 
on liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) offers promising insights into novel 
treatments of these proteinopathies by targeting the phase behavior of the 
disease-associated proteins. Thus, manipulating condensates has become a focus 
for developing new therapeutic compounds, termed condensate-modifying drugs 
(c-mods), by which historically considered undruggable proteins can be targeted. 
This review offers an overview of bioactive molecules that act as modifiers of 
Tau and α-synuclein condensates through various mechanisms. The goal is to lay 
the groundwork for discovering new therapeutic approaches to prevent harmful 
protein aggregation and treat comorbidity in tau and synucleinopathies.

Alzheimer's disease, characterized by the progressive loss of cognitive 
functions of the brain, is still an incurable pathology. Current treatments 
primarily aim to alleviate symptoms, acting mainly on behavioral changes, having 
a modest impact in the disease course. Recently, potential role of probiotics in 
managing Alzheimer's has been explored. Kefir, a fermented food teeming with 
live microorganisms, is thought to influence the gut microbiota, potentially 
reducing inflammation and the accumulation of toxic proteins in the brain. 
Additionally, kefir contains bioactive compounds, such as B vitamins, choline, 
and folic acid, which are essential for neuronal health and cognitive function. 
Thus, kefir could emerge as a promising complementary treatment for Alzheimer's 
disease. This systematic review, conducted in January 2024, examined the effects 
of kefir in both in vivo animal models and human patients with neurodegenerative 
conditions. The review was based on studies retrieved from BVS, Embase, 
PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. Seven studies were 
included, involving invertebrates, murine models, and human participants. In 
animal models, the primary outcomes were antioxidant effects, reduced 
beta-amyloid deposition, and attenuation of vascular damage and 
neurodegeneration. In human studies, kefir supplementation resulted in decreased 
levels of inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and oxidative 
proteins, and was associated with improvements in memory. Given its potential 
benefits, kefir could serve as a valuable adjunct to conventional treatments for 
Alzheimer's disease, warranting further investigation in clinical settings.

Meaningful benefit is a much-debated concept in Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Research to date has primarily focused on change thresholds that are anchored in 
clinicians' or care partners' impressions; however, these thresholds are not 
inherently meaningful to people living with AD (PLWAD) and may not take their 
perspectives into account. By overlaying the lived experience of AD through the 
eyes of individual PLWAD and their care partners with clinical outcomes, we 
offer an important framework in which to consider meaningful benefit in terms of 
symptoms, functioning, and outcomes. The PLWAD and care partner interviews and 
surveys of the What Matters Most (WMM) research program have identified 
treatment-related needs, preferences, and priorities of people at risk of or 
living with AD and their care partners across the AD continuum. A WMM conceptual 
model of disease-created and refined through interviews with PLWAD and care 
partners across the AD severity spectrum-includes 50 concepts across six domains 
(social life/activities, thought processing, communication, daily activities, 
mood/emotion, and general independence) considered important to all PLWAD and 
care partners. From the PLWAD and care partner perspectives, an increase in time 
to the onset, development, or worsening of the symptoms in any of these 
meaningful concepts was considered a meaningful benefit. No single commonly used 
clinical outcome assessment captures all concepts of importance, nor the 
importance of time in AD; considering the lived experience and priorities of 
individuals affected by AD is crucial to put the "meaning" in "meaningful."

INTRODUCTION: Microglial dysfunction is characteristic of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), with triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) and 
transcription factor PU.1 playing crucial roles. However, the relationship 
between TREM2 and PU.1 remains unclear.
METHODS: We investigated TREM2 and PU.1 expression patterns in the 5×FAD mouse 
AD model. Experimental approaches included quantitative PCR, western blotting, 
immunofluorescence staining, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and luciferase 
reporter assays to examine the interaction between PU.1 and TREM2. The 
phagocytic function of microglial cells was evaluated using Aβ42 and Nile red 
fluorescent microsphere phagocytosis assays.
RESULTS: TREM2 and PU.1 expression significantly correlated with brain β-amyloid 
(β) deposition. PU.1 directly interacted with the TREM2 promoter region, 
promoting its transcription and potently impacting microglial phagocytosis. PU.1 
overexpression amplified TREM2 expression, while PU.1 knockdown reduced it.
DISCUSSION: Our findings reveal a novel regulatory mechanism where PU.1 directly 
modulates TREM2 transcription in activated microglia during AD progression. 
These insights highlight the potential of TREM2 and PU.1 as therapeutic targets 
in AD treatment.

BACKGROUND: There are more and more Alzheimer's patients. The formation of 
plaques of Aβ1-42 in the brain is one of the main causes of Alzheimer's disease. 
Corn oligopeptides have natural antioxidant effects. It is aimed to develop 
functional corn oligopeptides to prevent Alzheimer's disease through 
antioxidation.
METHODS: According to previous laboratory studies, peptides of corn 
oligopeptides were screened by biological activity score and ADMET prediction, 
and molecular docking technology was used to screen the peptides that had high 
binding energy with Aβ1-42. The protective effects of the selected peptides were 
evaluated against oxidative stress in Aβ1-42-injured SHSY5Y cells, and the 
mechanism of the effects in the protein kinase A (PKA)/cAMP-response element 
binding protein (CREB)/brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-mediated 
signaling pathway was investigated, which is closely related to 
neurodegenerative and neurological diseases.
RESULTS: The results showed that three peptides (GL, FA and FQ) significantly 
increased the cell viability of Aβ1-42-induced cells and mitochondrial intensity 
and decreased extracellular lactate dehydrogenase content. They also improved 
intracellular oxidative stress caused by Aβ1-42, including reducing the 
overproduction of intracellular reactive oxygen species, and increasing the 
content of lipid oxidation, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. In 
addition, western blot showed that treatment with GL, FA and FQ significantly 
increased the expression of PKA, CREB and BDNF, whereas cells injured with 
Aβ1-42 decreased the expression of these signaling proteins.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that peptides of corn oligopeptides can 
effectively improve Aβ1-42-induced Alzheimer's disease, and may improve 
oxidative stress response to protective nerve cells by up-regulating the protein 
expression of the PKA/CREB/BDNF signaling pathway. © 2025 Society of Chemical

Epilepsy is a neurological disease characterized by repeated unprovoked seizure. 
Epilepsy is controlled by anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs); however, one third of 
epileptic patients have symptoms that are not controlled by AEDs in a condition 
called refractory epilepsy. Dysregulation of macroautophagy/autophagy is 
involved in the pathogenesis of epilepsy. Autophagy prevents the development and 
progression of epilepsy through regulating the balance between inhibitory and 
excitatory neurotransmitters. Induction of autophagy and autophagy-related 
proteins could be a novel therapeutic strategy in the management of epilepsy. 
Despite the protective role of autophagy against epileptogenesis and epilepsy, 
its role in status epilepticus is perplexing and might reflect its nature as a 
double-edged sword. Autophagy inducers play a critical role in reducing seizure 
frequency and severity, and could be an adjuvant treatment in the management of 
epilepsy. However, autophagy inhibitors also have an anticonvulsant effect. 
Therefore, the aim of the present mini-review is to discuss the potential role 
of autophagy in the pathogenesis of epileptogenesis and epilepsy, and how 
autophagy modulators affect epileptogenesis and epilepsy.Abbreviations: AD:

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic, progressive neurodegenerative 
disorder clinically characterized by memory decline, cognitive dysfunction, 
language impairment, deterioration of visuospatial skills, and personality 
changes. Pathologically, AD is marked by the deposition of β-amyloid (Aβ) 
plaques in the brain, the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, and progressive 
neuronal loss. Recent research has highlighted transfer RNA (tRNA)-derived small 
RNAs (tsRNAs) as crucial regulators in various biological processes; however, 
their roles in the pathophysiology of AD remain largely unexplored. The 
erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular (Eph) receptor family has recently drawn 
attention in the study of neurodegenerative diseases due to their role in 
regulating critical processes, including cell migration, neural development, 
angiogenesis, and tumor formation. This study aimed to investigate specific 
tsRNAs associated with AD by performing RNA sequencing on the cortex of APP/PS1 
transgenic mice and to explore the relationship between tsRNAs and their target 
genes within the Eph receptor family, thereby elucidating insights into the 
specific regulatory functions of these molecules.
METHODS: Eight-month-old male C57BL/6 and APP/PS1 transgenic mice were used in 
the study. BV-2 and HT22 cells were cultured and treated with Aβ25-35 at 
concentrations ranging from 0 µM to 40 µM. RNA was extracted from cortical 
tissues, and tRNA-derived fragments were analyzed after pre-treatment to remove 
RNA modifications. Differential expression of tRFs and tiRNAs was identified 
through sequencing, followed by bioinformatics analysis of target genes using 
TargetScan and miRanda. Transfection of BV-2 and HT22 cells with EphA7-siRNA and 
tRFAla-AGC-3-M8-mimic was conducted, and their interaction was validated using 
dual-luciferase reporter assays. Protein expression levels were assessed by 
western blotting and immunofluorescence. Statistical analyses were performed 
using R and GraphPad Prism, with significance set at p < 0.05.
RESULTS: We identified for the first time that EphA7 expression is upregulated 
in aggregated microglia and neuronal cells in the dentate gyrus region of the 
hippocampus, with increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p70S6K in AD. This 
upregulation occurred following the downregulation of tRFAla-AGC-3-M8 due to Aβ 
stimulation and was confirmed via in vitro experiments. By inhibiting EphA7 
expression and increasing tRFAla-AGC-3-M8 expression, we suppressed the 
ERK1/2-p70S6K signaling pathway in BV-2 and HT22 cells. This intervention 
alleviated neuronal damage and tau hyperphosphorylation in HT22 cells and 
reduced the M1-type polarization state of BV-2 cells induced by Aβ25-35 (see 
Graphical Abstract).
CONCLUSIONS: This study clarifies the specific role of tRFAla-AGC-3-M8 in AD 
pathology and offers a promising target for therapeutic interventions.

Serum glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) is a ubiquitous serine and 
threonine kinase and has been implicated in many physiological processes 
including cell survival, proliferation, metabolism, and ion transport. The 
dysregulation of SGK1 has also been linked to various diseases including 
cardiometabolic diseases, cancer, and neurological disorders. Recent evidence 
indicates that SGK1 is influential in the key Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
pathologic mechanisms including memory and cognitive dysfunction and AD 
hallmarks such as amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. 
Overexpression of SGK1 affects the Aβ metabolism and affects the pathway and 
enzymes disserting Aβ. SGK1 also increases dendritic spine density through 
regulation of actin polymerization, which increases the ratio of synaptic 
contacts leading to possible enhancement of memory and cognitive function. The 
modulation of SGK1 dysfunction in AD pathology leads to tau hyperphosphorylation 
through glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3β), thereby promoting the formation of 
neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). In addition, SGK1 enhances neuroinflammation 
through the activation of microglia as well as astrocytes into the release of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines and neuronal damage. Consequently, SGK1 has been 
implicated in pathological processes in neurodegeneration and further research 
is required to delineate its dual role. In this review, we focus on the role of 
SGK1 in neurodegenerative diseases, specifically in AD. In addition, it 
discusses the role of SGK1 signaling pathways and the possible SGK1 as a 
therapeutic target in memory formation and Aβ metabolism.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the primary cause of dementia in the elderly. 
However, effective therapies that modify the disease process in AD remain 
elusive. Far-infrared radiation (FIR) is commonly utilized as a complementary 
treatment a range of disease, for example insomnia and rheumatoid arthritis. In 
this research, we explored how FIR light impacts the cognitive functions of 
TgCRND8 AD mice and elucidated its underlying molecular mechanism. The cognitive 
capabilities of TgCRND8 mice assessed by employing the Morris water maze. The 
concentrations of IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-4, Aβ40, and Aβ42 protein were assessed by 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Immunostaining was conducted to assess the Aβ 
deposits and microglial presence in the brains of TgCRND8 mice. Western blot was 
applied to detect the protein expressions of tau phosphorylation, amyloid-β (Aβ) 
production, Jak-2/Stat3, and Nrf-2/HO-1 pathways. The results indicated that FIR 
light notably ameliorated the cognitive impairments of the AD mice, reduced both 
Aβ deposition and tau protein hyperphosphorylation at sites of Thr205, Ser369, 
Ser404, and Thr181, suppressed the release of TNF-α and IL-1β, attenuated the 
ratios of p-Jak-2/Jak-2 and p-Stat3/Stat3, while increased the protein levels of 
IL-4, Nrf-2, and HO-1 in the brains of TgCRND8 mice. These findings amply 
demonstrated that FIR light ameliorated cognitive deficits of TgCRND8 mice via 
reducing both Aβ burden and tau protein hyperphosphorylation, suppressing the 
neuroinflammation, and restoring the levels of the oxidative-related proteins 
through modulating Jak-2/Stat3 and Nrf-2/HO-1 pathways. These experimental 
findings indicate that FIR light treatment is a promising treatment approach for 
AD.

BACKGROUND: Neurodegenerative disorders are a group of debilitating diseases 
affecting the central nervous system, and are characterized by the progressive 
loss of neurons, leading to declines in cognitive function, movement, and 
overall quality of life. While the exact causes remain elusive, it's believed 
that a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors contribute 
to their development. Metabolites, the end products of cellular processes, 
reflect the physiological state of an organism. By analysing these molecules, 
researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the underlying metabolic changes 
associated with neurodegenerative disorders.
AIM OF REVIEW: This review aims to explore the possibilities between metabolites 
and their association with neurodegenerative disorders such as amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), 
Multiple sclerosis (MS) and Huntington's disease (HD).
KEY SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTS OF REVIEW: Metabolomic studies could potentially 
illuminate altered biochemical pathways, facilitating earlier detection and 
treatment of these conditions. Metabolomic investigations have revealed the role 
of oxidative stress, alterations in glucose and fat metabolism, mitochondrial 
dysfunction, apoptosis, glutamate excitotoxicity and alterations in myelin 
composition in neurodegenerative disorders. The common metabolic biomarkers 
identified includes glutamate, taurine, uric acid, branched chain amino acids, 
acylcarnitine, creatinine, choline, with some more amino acids and lipids. 
Metabolomics offers valuable insights into disease mechanisms and potential 
therapeutic targets by identifying biochemical and metabolic alterations, but 
still there are several aspects to be explored for accurate mapping of 
metabolites with specific pathway involved in the disease.

DDX3X is an X-linked RNA helicase that escapes X chromosome inactivation and is 
expressed at higher levels in female brains. Mutations in DDX3X are associated 
with intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and are 
predominantly identified in females (DDX3X syndrome). Using cellular and mouse 
models, we show that Ddx3x mediates sexual dimorphisms in brain development at a 
molecular, cellular, and behavioral level. During cortical neuronal development, 
Ddx3x sustains a female-biased signature of enhanced ribosomal biogenesis and 
mRNA metabolism. Compared to male neurons, female neurons display larger 
nucleoli, higher expression of a set of ribosomal proteins, and a higher 
cytoplasm-to-nucleus ratio of ribosomal RNA. All these sex dimorphisms are 
obliterated by Ddx3x loss. Ddx3x regulates dendritic arborization complexity in 
a sex- and dose-dependent manner in both female and male neurons. Ddx3x 
modulates the development of dendritic spines but only in female neurons. 
Further, ablating Ddx3x conditionally in forebrain neurons is sufficient to 
yield sex-specific changes in developmental outcomes and motor function. 
Together, these findings pose Ddx3x as a mediator of sexual differentiation 
during neurodevelopment and open new avenues to understand sex differences in 
health and disease.

The NOD-like receptor pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is a 
megadalton complex implicated in numerous inflammation-driven diseases including 
COVID-19, Alzheimer's disease, and gout. Although past efforts have focused on 
inhibiting IL-1β downstream of NLRP3 activation using drugs such as canakinumab, 
no FDA-approved NLRP3-targeted inhibitors are currently available. MCC950, a 
direct NLRP3 inhibitor, showed promise but exhibited off-target effects. Recent 
research has focused on optimizing the sulfonylurea-based MCC950 scaffold by 
leveraging recent structural and medicinal chemistry insights into the NLRP3 
nucleotide-binding and oligomerization (NACHT) domain to improve solubility and 
clinical efficacy. In addition, oxidized DNA (oxDNA) has emerged as a key 
inflammasome trigger, and molecules targeting the pyrin domain have shown 
promise in inhibiting NLRP3 activation. This review discusses the role of NLRP3 
in inflammation-related diseases, the status of ongoing clinical trials, and 
emerging small-molecule therapeutics targeting NLRP3.

Gastrodia elata Blume, a traditional medicinal herb primarily used in Asian 
countries such as China, has long been valued for treating headaches, dizziness, 
spasms, epilepsy, strokes, forgetfulness, and other ailments. Gastrodin, a 
glycoside analog and major bioactive component of Gastrodia elata Blume, has 
garnered significant scientific attention owing to its extensive pharmacological 
effects. It is commonly obtained through plant extraction, chemical synthesis, 
and biosynthesis. Gastrodin exhibits remarkable modulatory effects on the 
central nervous system (CNS), with promising applications in epilepsy, 
neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), and affective and cognitive disorders. Furthermore, the 
pharmacokinetics (PK) of gastrodin has been extensively reviewed. As a small 
molecule drug, this study focused on its efficiency and molecular mechanisms in 
treating CNS disorders, aiming to elucidate its interactions with disease 
targets. This study provides valuable insights for its development and addresses 
the drawbacks of unclear pharmacological mechanisms in traditional Chinese 
medicine.

[Expert consensus on disease-modifying therapy for Alzheimer's disease (2025 
edition)].

[Article in Chinese; Abstract available in Chinese from the publisher]

Neurologist Branch, Chinese Medical Doctor Association; Expert Group for Expert 
Consensus on Disease-Modifying Therapy for Alzheimer′s Disease.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses a significant challenge to China's aging 
population, and treatment is now comprehensively shifting toward 
disease-modifying therapy (DMT). By intervening core pathophysiological 
mechanisms, DMT seeks to alter the natural progression of the disease. As an 
emerging therapeutic paradigm, there is an urgent need for expert consensus to 
standardize the clinical use of DMT drugs in AD. This consensus systematically 
reviews both clinical practice and research advancements related to DMT for AD, 
including the target populations, contraindications and high-risk groups, 
pre-treatment evaluation procedures, administration methods and durations, 
efficacy assessments, and adverse event monitoring. It presents 17 
recommendations aiming to guide the clinical application of DMT in AD.

Chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment (CICI) is reported in over 35% of 
cancer survivors. Understanding risk factors for the development of CICI may 
provide insight into mechanisms and treatment. Being female and carrying the E4 
allele of the APOE gene are risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease, and 
there is emerging evidence that they may also confer risk for CICI. We sought to 
investigate these factors in a middle-aged (8-9 months) murine model of CICI. We 
used a 2 (+/- cisplatin) x 2 (male/female) x 2 (wild-type/APOE4 transgenic) 
factorial design in which cisplatin, or an equal volume of saline vehicle, was 
administered at 2.3 mg/kg/day for 5 days for 2 rounds separated by a 5-day rest. 
Behavioral tests of cognition and activity were evaluated one month after 
treatment completion followed by tissue collection. Male mice exhibited more 
severe weight loss following cisplatin, irrespective of genotype. Cisplatin was 
also associated with reduced open-field and nest building activity for both 
sexes and genotypes. In the puzzle box task, cisplatin treatment reduced 
performance in the task with indication that sex and genotype trial dependently 
modulated performance. In the novel object task, male mice of both genotypes 
showed cisplatin-induced deficits. In analyzing tissue, we did not note 
significant cisplatin-induced neuroinflammatory processes. We did observe an 
effect of cisplatin on brain Bdnf mRNA expression that varied by brain region, 
sex, and genotype. Within the hippocampus, cisplatin reduced Bdnf in male mice 
but mildly elevated it within female mice; within the frontal cortex, Bdnf 
expression was reduced by cisplatin in both sexes but more severely in APOE4 
mice. Overall, our data provide evidence that both sex and genotype may modulate 
the effect of cisplatin on the brain and on cognitive performance.

EphB2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor that regulates key neuronal functions such 
as synaptic transmission and morphogenesis. EphB2 dysfunction is associated with 
neurological disorders and dementia. In Alzheimer's disease, EphB2 depletion 
leads to memory deficits in mouse models, and its level is reduced in patients. 
EphB2 expression also declines with aging. Moreover, EphB2 dysfunction has been 
linked to autism. Here, we show that long-term memory (LTM) of auditory fear 
conditioning is impaired in EphB2lacZ/lacZ male mice that lack EphB2 forward 
signaling. However, LTM was significantly increased when we microinjected the 
5-HT2C serotonin receptor antagonist SB 242084 into the hippocampus before fear 
memory retrieval. SB 242084 microinjection before testing did not affect 
freezing in EphB2lacZ/lacZ when mice were exposed to the tone per se during 
training and testing. The 5-HT2C antagonist did not affect fear LTM in wild-type 
mice. SB 242084 was ineffective when injected before fear conditioning training. 
Microinjection of the 5-HT2C receptor agonist MK-212 into the hippocampus of 
wild-type mice before memory retrieval did not affect LTM. We further revealed 
that SB 242084 altered the intrinsic properties of pyramidal hippocampal neurons 
leading to increased excitability only in EphB2lacZ/lacZ but not in wild-type 
mice. The results show that memory is not lost in EphB2lacZ/lacZ mice but rather 
memory is inaccessible and can be recovered with 5-HT2C antagonists. 
Furthermore, it may be possible to rescue such memory impairments in brain 
diseases where EphB2 dysfunction is involved.

The growing population of older adults and the lack of cure for Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) has resulted in researchers identifying modifiable lifestyle 
factors that might prevent or slow the progression of the disease. Prospective 
studies exploring the relationship between baseline physical activity (PA) and 
the subsequent risk of a diagnoses of AD and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) 
testing the effects of aerobic exercise (AE) and resistance exercise (RE) on 
cognitive performance, blood-based biomarkers of AD, and neuroimaging measures 
of brain health provide some intriguing results. Exemplars of these studies and 
results from meta-analytic reviews (when available) are presented to provide an 
overview of the state of the science. In general, results from prospective 
studies show that PA is protective, and results from RCTs show that AE improves 
cognitive performance by older adults who are cognitively normal and by those 
with mild cognitive impairment. Promising results have been observed for AE on 
measures of brain health, and studies exploring the effects on biomarkers have 
yielded some intriguing results but are less consistent to date. Studies testing 
the effects of RE also find benefits for cognitive performance by older adults 
and consistently show improvements in brain health. In conclusion, results from 
prospective studies and RCTs demonstrate the potential of exercise to improve 
cognition, brain health, and, to a lesser extent, blood-based biomarkers. Future 
research linking the magnitude of the findings from RCTs with evidence from 
prospective studies will advance our understanding of the potential of exercise 
to reduce the risk of AD.

Tau protein is enriched in neuronal axons, it functions as a stabilizer of 
axonal transportation. Hyperphosphorylation of Tau in the brain results in 
early-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), causes remarkable bone loss. Notably, 
pathological Tau leads to the loss of specific physiological Tau that 
exaggerates Tau toxicity. However, little was known about the physiological role 
of Tau in bone homeostasis although it's rarely expressed in peripheral tissues. 
Here, we provided evidence for brain Tau's role in promoting bone formation. Tau 
knockout (Tau-/-) mice showed smaller body size and exhibited osteoporotic-like 
deficit, including reduced trabecular and cortical bone mass, especially in 
young male Tau-/- mice. Such a deficit is likely due to a decrease in osteoblast 
(OB)-mediated bone formation, as little change in bone resorption in Tau-/- 
mice. Further mechanistic studies showed increased PPARγ signaling in the brain 
of Tau-/- mice, which contributed to chemerin release and CMKLR1upregulation in 
Tau-/- mice brain. Chemerin neutralization remarkably restored osteogenesis 
potential. Furthermore, reduced repressive H3K9me2 in Tau-/- mice brain led to 
decreased enrichment of H3K9me2 at PPARγ promoter and thus increased chemerin 
production. Moreover, PPARγ inhibitor GW9662 significantly reversed the 
osteoporotic phenotype of Tau-/- mice. Our results implicated brain Tau acting 
as a dominant positive regulator in bone mass, and unveiled a potential clinical 
value of PPARγ inhibition in treatment of AD-associated osteoporotic deficits.

The hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative 
condition, is the buildup of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaque, which is mainly caused by 
β-secretase 1 (BACE-1) activity. BACE-1 inhibition is a potentially effective 
treatment strategy to lower the progression of AD. In order to find possible 
BACE-1 inhibitors using a drug repurposing technique, this study uses an 
integrated computational approach that includes pharmacophore modelling, virtual 
screening, molecular docking, MM-GBSA, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, 
in-silico ADMET profiling, and PBPK modelling. A pharmacophore model, was 
created with known BACE-1 inhibitors to enable virtual screening of both novel 
and FDA-approved chemical libraries. Top candidates with good free energy scores 
and strong binding affinities were found using molecular docking and MM-GBSA 
calculations. The stability of shortlisted Hits inside the BACE-1 active site 
was further validated using MD simulations, which showed that some of the 
important interactions were maintained across a period of 50ns. ADMET and PBPK 
studies predicted favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profiles for the 
shortlisted hits, particularly for B2 and B9. These findings identify potential 
candidates for future experimental validation, offering an inexpensive approach 
for identification of compounds as potential BACE-1 inhibitors.

For effective in vivo applications, imaging probes must exhibit sufficient 
tissue penetration depth, high sensitivity, and specificity. Increasing evidence 
suggests that pathological accumulation of Aβ results in elevated mitochondrial 
viscosity. To achieve red-shifted absorption and emission characteristics of 
small-molecule theranostic agents and to enhance their mitochondrial targeting 
efficiency, a series of M-series probes (M13 ∼ M15) was rationally designed 
based on the previously reported Q-series compounds. Using compound Q16 as the 
parent structure, the M series probes retained the electron-donating 
dimethylamino group while replacing the benzene ring with a quinoline moiety. 
This modification was intended to enhance the intramolecular charge transfer 
(ICT) effect of the "D-π-A" system, thereby red-shifting the fluorescence 
emission wavelength and expanding the Stokes shift. The enhanced push-pull 
effect induced a redshift in the emission wavelength of probe M13 to 806 nm in 
DMSO, resulting in a Stokes shift of 266 nm. This large Stokes shift effectively 
minimizes the overlap between excitation and emission wavelengths, thereby 
reducing self-quenching effects. Building on this, the interactions between 
M-series probes and Aβ aggregates were further explored. The probes exhibited 
the expected fluorescence characteristics and displayed varying degrees of 
response upon binding with Aβ aggregates. To enable a more precise early 
diagnosis, M13, M14, and M15 were evaluated for their ability to monitor changes 
in mitochondrial viscosity and their mitochondrial targeting efficiency. The 
results demonstrated that the M-series fluorescent probes could effectively 
monitor variations in mitochondrial viscosity in cells. All three probes 
demonstrated strong mitochondrial targeting in HeLa cells, with M14 achieving a 
high colocalization coefficient of 0.89 when compared with a commercial 
mitochondrial dye. These findings highlight the potential application of 
M-series probes in the early diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD).

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Aligning biomarker evidence with clinical 
presentation in early Alzheimer disease (AD) is essential for improving 
diagnosis, prognosis, and interventions. This study evaluates the relationship 
between cognitive impairment, future decline, and phosphorylated tau levels in 
plasma and CSF in predementia AD.
METHODS: This longitudinal observational study included predementia cases and 
controls from 2 independent cohorts: the Norwegian Dementia Disease Initiation 
(DDI) and Canadian Pre-Symptomatic Evaluation of Experimental or Novel 
Treatments for Alzheimer's Disease (PREVENT-AD). In DDI, cognitively normal (CN) 
and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) cases were classified using CSF Aβ42/40 
ratio (A) and p-tau181 (T), whereas classification in PREVENT-AD (A) was based 
on amyloid PET scans. In DDI, we assessed CSF-plasma correlations for p-tau181, 
p-tau217, and p-tau231. Diagnostic accuracies were evaluated through receiver 
operating characteristic analyses. Linear mixed models evaluated p-tau 
associations with future memory decline. Between-group differences in plasma 
p-tau217 were assessed in both cohorts.
RESULTS: In DDI (n = 431), participants were classified as CN A-/T- (n = 169), 
A+/T- (CN = 26, MCI = 24), A+/T+ (CN = 40, MCI = 105), and A-/T+ (CN = 34, MCI = 
33), with a mean age of 64.1 years and 55.9% female. In PREVENT-AD (n = 190), 
participants were categorized as CN A- (n = 118), CN A+ (n = 49), and MCI A+ (n 
= 21), with a mean age of 67.8 years and 72.6% female. In DDI, plasma p-tau217 
showed high accuracy in identifying A+ participants (areas under the curve 
[AUC]: 0.85) and a moderate correlation with CSF p-tau217 (rho = 0.65, p < 
0.001). Diagnostic accuracy of plasma p-tau217 was greater in MCI A+ (AUC: 0.89) 
than in CN A+ (AUC: 0.79, p < 0.05) and in A+/T+ (AUC: 0.88) vs A+/T- (AUC: 
0.78, p < 0.05). p-Tau181 and p-tau231 had weaker CSF-plasma correlations (rho = 
0.47 and rho = 0.32, p < 0.001) and were less associated with cognitive status 
in A+ individuals. Higher plasma p-tau217 in A+ MCI vs A+ CN individuals (p < 
0.001) was confirmed in PREVENT-AD. All CSF p-tau markers, but only plasma 
p-tau217, were associated with future memory decline (β = 0.05, p < 0.05).
DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that, unlike p-tau181 and p-tau231, plasma 
p-tau217 consistently aligns with cognitive status in A+ individuals and better 
reflects CSF biomarker abnormalities, reducing discrepancies between clinical 
and biochemical findings. Its association with baseline and future memory 
decline highlights its diagnostic and prognostic value, particularly when CSF 
analysis or PET is unavailable.

Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is commonly used as a solvent for preparing 
amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides implicated in Alzheimer's disease. While considered 
relatively non-toxic at low concentrations, DMSO itself may exert biological 
effects that could confound experimental outcomes, especially for weakly 
cytotoxic substances like Aβ. Seven brain cell types (BV-2, N2a, SH-SY5Y, U87, 
neurons, astrocytes, microglia) were treated with varying DMSO concentrations or 
Aβ1-42 oligomers/protofibrils/fibrils prepared using DMSO. Cell viability was 
assessed by CCK-8 and LDH assays. Matched DMSO controls were prepared alongside 
Aβ treatments to delineate solvent effects. Low DMSO concentrations 
(0.0625-0.015625%) exhibited hormetic cytoprotective and growth-promoting 
effects, while higher concentrations (≥2%) were cytotoxic. Importantly, these 
hormetic solvent effects confounded the measurement of Aβ cytotoxicity. By 
accounting for matched DMSO controls, the study revealed that Aβ fibril toxicity 
may have been underestimated due to the cytoprotective solvent effects of low 
DMSO concentrations used in their preparation. In conclusion, DMSO exhibits 
complex hormetic dose-responses that can significantly influence experimental 
outcomes, especially for weakly cytotoxic agents like Aβ. Rigorous solvent 
controls are crucial to delineate genuine substance effects from potential 
solvent confounds and avoid erroneous interpretations.

GMAMDA: Predicting Metabolite-Disease Associations Based on Adaptive Hardness 
Negative Sampling and Adaptive Graph Multiple Convolution.

Metabolites are small molecules produced during organism metabolism, with their 
abnormal concentrations closely linked to the onset and progression of various 
diseases. Accurate prediction of metabolite-disease associations is crucial for 
early diagnosis, mechanistic exploration, and treatment optimization. However, 
existing algorithms often overlook the integration of node features and neglect 
the impact of different hop domains on nodes in the processing of heterogeneous 
graphs. Furthermore, current methods solely rely on random sampling for 
selecting negative samples without considering their reliability, thereby 
compromising model stability. A novel metabolite-disease association prediction 
model, GMAMDA, is proposed to address these challenges. GMAMDA integrates 
adaptive hardness negative sampling, adaptive graph multiple convolution 
techniques, and a multiheterogeneous graph fusion strategy to forecast potential 
metabolite-disease associations. Initially, by computing multisource similarity 
information for metabolites and diseases, multiple heterogeneous graph networks 
are established for metabolite-disease association networks. Subsequently, the 
adaptive graph's multiconvolution mechanism is employed to generate feature-rich 
node representations across various heterogeneous graphs by dynamically 
leveraging information from different hop neighborhoods. The model then utilizes 
an adaptive hardness negative sampling approach based on principal component 
analysis to select negative samples with the highest information content for 
training, enabling the prediction of potential associations between new 
metabolites and diseases. Experimental findings demonstrate that GMAMDA 
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various evaluation metrics, 
including AUC (0.9962 ± 0.0014), AUPR (0.9967 ± 0.0009), and accuracy (0.9733 ± 
0.0042). Case studies focusing on Alzheimer's disease and kidney disease further 
validate GMAMDA's clinical potential in predicting metabolite markers.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a formidable challenge in 
neurodegeneration research, with limited therapeutic options despite decades of 
study. While Drosophila melanogaster has been instrumental in in modeling AD 
related Tau and amyloid beta toxicity, inflammation, a key driver of AD 
pathology, remains unexplored in fly models. Given the evolutionary conservation 
of innate immune pathways between flies and mammals, drosophila presents a 
powerful yet underutilized tool for inflammation led drug discovery in AD.
AREAS COVERED: This perspective highlights the relevance of Drosophila in 
studying neuroinflammatory processes, including microglial-like glial 
activation, systemic inflammation and gut-brain axis interactions. It further 
explores how fly models can be leveraged to screen anti-inflammatory compounds 
and dissect immune related genetic factors implicated in AD.
EXPERT OPINION: By integrating immune modulation in Drosophila-based drug 
discovery pipeline we can accelerate the identification of novel therapeutic 
strategies. Fully exploiting the potential of Drosophila in inflammation led 
drug screening may usher in a new era of AD therapeutics, bridging gaps between 
fundamental research and translational medicine.

Deformable brain templates are an important tool in many neuroimaging analyses. 
Conditional templates (e.g., age-specific templates) have advantages over single 
population templates by enabling improved registration accuracy and capturing 
common processes in brain development and degeneration. Conventional methods 
require large, evenly spread cohorts to develop conditional templates, limiting 
their ability to create templates that could reflect richer combinations of 
clinical and demographic variables. More recent deep-learning methods, which can 
infer relationships in very high-dimensional spaces, open up the possibility of 
producing conditional templates that are jointly optimised for these richer sets 
of conditioning parameters. We have built on recent deep-learning template 
generation approaches using a diffeomorphic (topology-preserving) framework to 
create a purely geometric method of conditional template construction that 
learns diffeomorphisms between: (i) a global or group template and conditional 
templates, and (ii) conditional templates and individual brain scans. We 
evaluated our method, as well as other recent deep-learning approaches, on a 
data set of cognitively normal (CN) participants from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), using age as the conditioning parameter of 
interest. We assessed the effectiveness of these networks at capturing 
age-dependent anatomical differences. Our results demonstrate that while the 
assessed deep-learning methods have a number of strengths, they require further 
refinement to capture morphological changes in ageing brains with an acceptable 
degree of accuracy. The volumetric output of our method, and other recent 
deep-learning approaches, across four brain structures (grey matter, white 
matter, the lateral ventricles and the hippocampus), was measured and showed 
that although each of the methods captured some changes well, each method was 
unable to accurately track changes in all of the volumes. However, as our method 
is purely geometric, it was able to produce T1-weighted conditional templates 
with high spatial fidelity and with consistent topology as age varies, making 
these conditional templates advantageous for spatial registrations. The use of 
diffeomorphisms in these deep-learning methods represents an important strength 
of these approaches, as they can produce conditional templates that can be 
explicitly linked, geometrically, across age as well as to fixed, unconditional 
templates or brain atlases. The use of deep learning in conditional template 
generation provides a framework for creating templates for more complex sets of 
conditioning parameters, such as pathologies and demographic variables, in order 
to facilitate a broader application of conditional brain templates in 
neuroimaging studies. This can aid researchers and clinicians in their 
understanding of how brain structure changes over time and under various 
interventions, with the ultimate goal of improving the calibration of treatments 
and interventions in personalised medicine. The code to implement our 
conditional brain template network is available at:

INTRODUCTION: This study examines the associations of caregiver role with 
lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) identity social support, 
relationships, and care outcomes among LGBTQ+ older adults.
METHODS: We use LGBTQ+ Social Networks, Aging, and Policy Study Wave 3 data 
(QSNAPS; N = 982). Descriptive and logistic regression analyses were conducted 
to examine associations between caregiver role and outcomes.
RESULTS: Eighty respondents (8.1%) care for 90 individuals with neurocognitive 
disorders, a majority of whom are parents of the respondent. LGBTQ+ older adult 
caregivers were half as likely to have family support (p < 0.05); 40.6% less 
likely to have coworker support (p < 0.1); and 45.6% less likely to have 
neighbor support (p < 0.05) for LGBTQ+ identities. Caregivers were more likely 
to receive practical help from others (p < 0.01), but experienced issues related 
to their own access to health care.
DISCUSSION: Understanding LGBTQ-identity social support and care access can 
inform targeted interventions to reduce LGBTQ+ caregiver health disparities.
HIGHLIGHTS: Transgender and gender diverse adults were more likely to be mild 
cognitive impairment/Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (MCI/ADRD) 
caregivers. LGBTQ+ MCI/ADRD caregivers primarily provide care to parents and 
familial relatives. MCI/ADRD care recipients hold differing political views than 
LGBTQ+ caregivers. LGBTQ+ caregivers were less likely to have family, coworker, 
and neighbor support. LGBTQ+ caregivers were less likely to receive 
LGBTQ-affirming care communication.

INTRODUCTION: Oxidative stress (OS) is implicated in dementia. While elevated 
peripheral OS biomarkers were observed in vascular mild cognitive impairment 
(vMCI), the role of central antioxidants remains unclear. We assessed levels of 
the major brain antioxidant glutathione (GSH) in vMCI compared to cognitively 
normal coronary artery disease (CAD) controls (CN).
METHODS: In vivo tissue-corrected GSH in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and 
occipital cortex (OC) were quantified in persons with vMCI and CN using 
MEscher-GArwood Point RESolved magnetic resonance Spectroscopy.
RESULTS: Among participants (vMCI, n = 22, age [mean ± SD] = 67.4 ± 7.3; CN, 
n = 21, age = 66.7 ± 7.8), ACC-GSH (i.u. ± SD) was higher in vMCI (4.42 ± 0.59) 
versus CN (3.72 ± 1.01) (Z = -2.5, p = .01), even after controlling for age and 
sex (B [SE] = 0.74 [0.26], p = .007). Increased ACC-GSH correlated with poorer 
executive function (EF) (B [SE] = -0.31 [0.14], p = .04). OC-GSH showed no 
effect.
DISCUSSION: Higher ACC-GSH in vMCI may reflect a compensatory response to OS. 
ACC-GSH was negatively correlated with EF, suggesting a linkage between regional 
brain antioxidants and disease-relevant cognitive domains.
HIGHLIGHTS: Brain GSH was measured in vascular MCI and matched controls using 
MEGA-PRESS. In contrast to GSH deficits in AD, anterior cingulate GSH was 
elevated in vMCI. Brain GSH was correlated with disease-relevant cognitive 
domains in vMCI. The GSH antioxidant system may be etiologically implicated in 
vMCI.

INTRODUCTION: As India's population ages, the prevalence of dementia is 
increasing rapidly, inducing higher need for informal caregivers for a complex 
population. However, the effects of individuals' cognitive impairment on their 
caregivers' well-being in India have not been well studied.
METHODS: We analyzed data from 4196 informants of participants in the 
Longitudinal Aging Study in India-Diagnostic Assessment of Dementia (LASI-DAD). 
Informants' caregiving roles and well-being, including stress, mental health, 
positive affect, and spirituality, were assessed alongside the cognitive 
function and dementia status of LASI-DAD respondents.
RESULTS: Informants of individuals with cognitive impairment experienced 
significantly higher stress, poorer mental health, and lower levels of positive 
affect and spirituality. Greater caregiving responsibility intensified the 
negative impact on well-being.
DISCUSSION: These results demonstrate the significant emotional and 
psychological strain on dementia caregivers in India, underscoring the need for 
targeted interventions and support structures.
HIGHLIGHTS: We used a dual data collection approach in LASI-DAD to create a 
first-of-its-kind linked dataset on care recipients' and caregivers' outcomes, 
representative of Indian older adults. Using this dataset, we tested whether 
cognitive impairment in care recipients increased informants' stress and lowers 
well-being, with greater caregiving responsibility amplifying these effects. 
Informants of cognitively impaired individuals reported significantly higher 
stress, poorer mental health, and lower positive affect and spirituality, with 
stronger effects for those with greater caregiving roles. Non-primary caregivers 
also experienced well-being declines when assisting a cognitively impaired older 
adult, likely driven by family disruptions and added household responsibilities 
for co-residents and logistical challenges and reduced control for those living 
separately. Our findings highlight the widespread emotional and psychological 
strain of dementia caregiving in India, emphasizing the need for targeted 
support and interventions.

INTRODUCTION: Further research is needed to understand the performance of plasma 
phosphorylated tau (p-tau)217 in the diagnostic thinking at the individual 
patient level. We evaluated the incremental diagnostic value of plasma p-tau217, 
expressed in terms of diagnostic confidence of Alzheimer's disease (DCAD; range 
0-100).
METHODS: Two hundred thirty-two patients with dementia were included and scored 
in terms of DCAD in a three-step consecutive assessment: (1) clinical work-up, 
(2) clinical work-up plus plasma p-tau217, and (3) clinical work-up, plasma 
p-tau217, plus conventional amyloid markers. Two blinded neurologists were asked 
to review DCAD at each step.
RESULTS: DCAD accuracy, expressed as area under the curve, significantly 
increased from 0.93 with clinical work-up alone, to 0.97 with clinical work-up 
plus plasma p-tau217 (P = 0.01), with no further increase with the addition of 
conventional amyloid markers (0.99, P = 0.13).
DISCUSSION: Plasma p-tau217 in addition to routine assessment significantly 
enhances diagnostic confidence that is comparable to well-established 
amyloidosis biomarkers.
HIGHLIGHTS: Plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau)217 measurements increase 
diagnostic confidence of Alzheimer's disease. Plasma p-tau217 increases 
diagnostic confidence comparable to traditional markers. Plasma p-tau217 dosage 
may be helpful in addition to routine assessment.

BACKGROUND: Genetic testing for dementia has drawn public attention in recent 
years, albeit with concerns on its appropriate use. This study leveraged Twitter 
data to analyze public perceptions related to genetic testing for dementia.
METHODS: English tweets from January 1, 2010 to April 1, 2023, containing 
relevant terms, were extracted from Twitter API. A Bidirectional Encoder 
Representations from Transformers (BERT) model was used with Named Entity 
Recognition (NER) to identify individual and organizational users. BERT-based 
topic modeling was applied to identify the themes for relevant source tweets. 
Topic coherence was assessed through manual inspection, complemented by the 
Silhouette Coefficient. Manual thematic analysis, following Braun and Clarke's 
approach, refined the topics and themes.
RESULTS: The analysis of 3045 original/source tweets identified 9 topics 
(Silhouette Coefficient=0.19), categorized into 3 main themes: (1) opinions on 
the appropriateness of genetic testing in dementia diagnosis; (2) discussion on 
the psychosocial impact; (3) discussion on genetic testing's role in Alzheimer 
disease treatment and prevention. Theme 1 comprised 90.6% of source tweets, 
demonstrating prevailing contentions. Tweets in theme 2 were increasingly 
contributed by organization users over time and included tweets containing 
misinformation about genetic testing in children. Tweets in theme 3 were 
increasingly contributed by individual users, possibly suggesting rising public 
interest in the treatment and prevention of dementia.
CONCLUSION: The study highlighted limited public understanding of the 
nondeterministic nature of genetic testing for dementia, with concerns about 
unsupervised direct-to-consumer genetic test marketing, emphasizing the need to 
counter misinformation and raise public awareness.

BACKGROUND: Dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is an important 
pathological mechanism in central nervous system (CNS) diseases and can trigger 
a series of pathological reactions, such as neuroinflammatory responses, 
oxidative stress, immune infiltration, etc., thereby worsening brain damage. 
However, pericytes are often overlooked by researchers, and no review research 
has yet summarized the mechanism by which pericytes contribute to BBB 
dysfunction in CNS diseases.
RESULTS: Therefore, this review explores the pathophysiology of BBB dysfunction 
in CNS diseases and provides a detailed account of the biological 
characteristics of pericytes, especially the controversy over their biomarkers. 
Subsequently, we review the role of pericytes in CNS diseases such as 
Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, multiple sclerosis, ischemic stroke, and 
hemorrhagic stroke, with a particular focus on the role of pericytes in BBB 
dysfunction. In addition, we also discuss treatments based on pericytes, such as 
regenerative medicine that induces pericyte differentiation and 
Pericyte-Extracellular Vesicles.
CONCLUSIONS: This review aims to provide a more comprehensive understanding and 
guidance on the role of pericytes in BBB dysfunction in CNS diseases and serve 
clinical treatment.

BACKGROUND: Long COVID incidence and risk factors in older adults need to be 
better characterized to identify risk mitigation strategies. Our aim was to 
quantify the incidence of Long COVID in a population-based sample of older 
adults and to describe the association between COVID-19 vaccination and Long 
COVID risk.
METHODS: This cohort study included Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries ≥ 66 
years diagnosed with COVID-19 between October 1, 2021, and March 31, 2023 (index 
date). Long COVID diagnoses were identified from Medicare Part A-B claims based 
on ICD-10-CM code U09.9. We measured the number of COVID-19 vaccine doses 
administered prior to the index date using Medicare Part B claims and pharmacy 
records. Kaplan-Meier estimators, Cox proportional hazards, and Fine-Grey 
regression models were used to estimate the 1-year cumulative incidence and 
relative rate of Long COVID.
RESULTS: We identified 3 588 671 Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with COVID-19. 
Overall, 3.89% of beneficiaries were diagnosed with Long COVID over 1 year. A 
gradient in the 1-year cumulative incidence of Long COVID was observed according 
to the number of prior COVID-19 vaccine doses. Beneficiaries with 4 or more 
COVID-19 vaccine doses had a 39% lower adjusted rate of Long COVID relative to 
beneficiaries without a prior dose (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.61, 95% 
CI = 0.60-0.62).
CONCLUSIONS: Long COVID diagnoses in Medicare claims were common in a large 
sample of older adults with COVID-19, and we observed a gradient in Long COVID 
risk across the number of prior COVID-19 vaccine doses. Promoting continued 
vaccination may be an effective strategy to mitigate the burden of Long COVID in 
older adults.

Gastrodia elata Blume (GE), a traditional Chinese medicine clinically employed 
to treat neurological disorders, demonstrates therapeutic efficacy supported by 
robust clinical evidence. Nowadays, conventional pharmacotherapies for 
neurological conditions-such as cholinesterase inhibitors for Alzheimer's or 
Ldopa for Parkinson's-often provide limited symptom relief, exhibit side 
effects, and fail to halt disease w, underscoring the need for alternative 
strategies. The primary bioactive compounds of Gastrodia elata Blume (GE) 
include gastrodin, p-hydroxybenzyl alcohol, Vanillyl alcohol, Polysaccharides, 
and β-sitosterol. Modern research has demonstrated that GE and its active 
components exhibit neuropharmacological effects, including neuron protection, 
reduction of neurotoxicity, and promotion of nerve regeneration and survival. 
For example, Gastrodin, exerts neuroprotection by scavenging reactive oxygen 
species, suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokines, and enhancing GABAergic 
transmission, thereby alleviating oxidative stress and neuronal apoptosis. 
Vanillin, potentiates GABA receptor activity, enhancing inhibitory 
neurotransmission and reducing seizure susceptibility.GE polysaccharides 
modulate the gut-brain axis and suppress microglial activation, mitigating 
neuroinflammation. Current studies primarily focus on GE and its active 
ingredients for the treatment of neurological diseases such as Parkinson's 
disease, Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, convulsions, depression, schizophrenia, 
as well as enhancing learning and memory, and preventing or treating cerebral 
ischemic injury. This review explores the neuropharmacological effects of GE and 
its active compounds, elucidates the underlying mechanisms, and suggests 
potential preventive and therapeutic strategies for neurological diseases using 
herbal remedies.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and insulin resistance are associated with an 
increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia, including Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), originally developed 
for glycemic control, are emerging as neuroprotective agents. This review 
evaluates the evidence regarding the effects of GLP-1RAs in populations with 
T2DM-both with and without cognitive impairment, as well as in individuals 
diagnosed with AD. We conducted a comprehensive literature search and identified 
ten studies for inclusion: six randomized controlled trials, one prospective 
open-label study, and three observational studies. GLP-1RAs consistently 
demonstrated cognitive benefits in patients with T2DM, even in the absence of 
metabolic improvements. In cases of early dementia or AD, GLP-1RA treatment 
preserved brain metabolism and connectivity but did not significantly alter 
amyloid or tau biomarkers. Notably, cognitive improvements were most evident in 
individuals with higher body mass index (BMI) or obesity. While some studies 
reported neural functional changes via imaging, direct modifications in 
established AD biomarkers were not consistently observed. In conclusion, 
GLP-1RAs may improve cognitive outcomes and brain function, particularly in the 
early stages of neurodegeneration and among high-risk T2DM populations. Further 
well-designed clinical trials are needed to evaluate the impacts of GLP-1RAs on 
both the clinical progression and underlying pathology of dementia.

Aging is the primary risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the aging 
brain shares many characteristics with the early stages of AD. This study 
investigates the interplay between aging and amyloid-beta (Aβ) induced 
pathology. We developed an AD-like in vivo model, using the stereotactic 
injection of Aβ1-42 oligomers into the hippocampi of aged mice. Cognitive 
impairments were assessed using a Y maze. Immunohistochemical and protein 
analyses were conducted to evaluate neuronal survival, synaptic function and 
number, levels of tau hyperphosphorylation, microglial activation, autophagy, 
and mitochondrial function. We compared baseline aging effects in young adult (3 
months) and aged (16-18 months) healthy mice. We found that aged mice displayed 
significant deficits in working memory, synaptic density and neurogenesis, and 
an increased basal inflammation. In response to acute injury to the hippocampus 
with Aβ oligomer injection, aged mice suffered sustained deficits, including 
impaired cognitive function, further reduced neurogenesis and synaptic density, 
increased microglial activation, astrogliosis, mitochondrial stress, and 
lysosomal burden. Furthermore, in the weeks following injury, the aged mice show 
increased amyloid accumulation, microglial activation and phosphorylated tau 
propagation, expanding from the injection site to adjacent hippocampal regions. 
In contrast, the young adult mice exhibited only acute effects without long-term 
progression of pathology or neurodegeneration. We conclude that the aging brain 
environment increases susceptibility to an acute Aβ injury, creating fertile 
soil for the progression of AD, whereas younger brains are able to overcome this 
injury. The processes of aging should be considered as an integral factor in the 
development of the disease. Targeting aging mechanisms may provide new 
strategies for AD prevention and treatment, as well as for other 
neurodegenerative diseases.

Alzheimer's disease, a significant contributor to dementia, is rapidly becoming 
a serious healthcare concern in the 21st century. The alarming number of 
patients with Alzheimer's disease is steadily increasing, which is contributed 
by the dearth of treatment options. The current treatment for Alzheimer's 
disease is heavily dependent on symptomatic treatment that has failed to cure 
the disease despite huge investments in the development of drugs. The clinical 
treatment of Alzheimer's disease with limited drugs is generally targeted 
towards the inhibition of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor and acetylcholine 
esterase, which only elevate cognition levels for a limited period. Beyond the 
aforementioned molecular targets, β-amyloid was much explored with little 
success and thus created a feel and palpable growing emphasis on discovering new 
putative and novel targets for AD. This has inspired medicinal chemists to 
explore new targets, including microglia, triggering receptors expressed on 
myeloid cells 2 (Trem-2), and notum carboxylesterase, to discover new lead 
compounds. This review explores the functions, pathophysiological roles, and 
importance of all AD-related targets that address therapeutic and preventive 
approaches for the treatment and protection of Alzheimer's disease.

Recent accelerated and traditional approval of anti-amyloid therapies by the 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients with early 
Alzheimer's disease has stimulated heated debate on whether or not the benefits 
of these therapeutic agents achieve a minimum clinically important effect size, 
or minimum clinically important difference. We argue that these debates are 
rooted in the entanglement of two fundamentally different concepts, the minimum 
clinically important difference for an individual versus that of a population. 
At the core of the indiscrimination between the two concepts is the unrealistic 
requirement or expectation that a drug should provide the same clinically 
important effect for every patient in the target population to be considered 
achieving meaningful benefit for the population. We discuss the difference and 
connection between the two concepts to facilitate the communication about their 
difference and relatedness.
HIGHLIGHTS: Minimum clinically important difference (MCID) is defined for an 
individual and population-level mimimum clinically important difference (pMCID) 
is defined for a population.MCID and pMCID are fundamentally different 
measures.We established their connection and showed in general pMCID < 
MCID.Discussion of effect size of Alzheimer's disease treatments should clearly 
distinguish the two measures.

Clinical evaluation of medicines for patients with mild cognitive impairment and 
mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease in Japan.

Japan.

Lecanemab and donanemab were approved in Japan in September 2023 and September 
2024, respectively, for the treatment of patients with mild cognitive impairment 
and mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. Evaluating the efficacy of these 
drugs requires demonstrating a clinically meaningful delay in symptom 
progression while ensuring an acceptable safety profile. This paper describes 
the efficacy assessment in the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency's 
(PMDA) review, focusing on clinical endpoints, biomarker evaluations, and the 
role of minimal clinically important difference (MCID) in benefit-risk 
assessment. At present, the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), 
which assesses both cognitive and functional decline, is one of the most 
recommended primary endpoints in confirmatory trials. Time-to-progression 
analysis should be also conducted to support clinical significance. Biomarker 
evaluations, particularly amyloid beta (Aβ) reduction, should be included as 
secondary endpoints to confirm the mechanism of action. Though biomarker 
assessments showed significant Aβ reduction for both anti-amyloid therapies, no 
direct correlation with clinical outcomes was observed, limiting their use as 
surrogate endpoints. Therefore, the MCID for clinical symptom progression 
suppression cannot be inferred based on Aβ reduction. Safety evaluation focused 
on amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIAs), a key risk associated with 
anti-Aβ antibody treatments. Under the condition in which ARIA risk is managed 
through magnetic resonance imaging monitoring and predefined risk mitigation 
measures, PMDA considers the benefit-risk balance of these anti-amyloid 
therapies are favorable. While regulatory approval does not require meeting 
predefined MCID thresholds, it is based on a comprehensive benefit-risk 
assessment. For regulatory approval, future drugs will be required to 
demonstrate a benefit-risk balance equivalent to or more favorable than that of 
the approved anti-Aβ antibody drugs.
HIGHLIGHTS: Lecanemab and donanemab were approved in Japan for early Alzheimer's 
disease in 2023 and 2024, respectively.Drug efficacy was considered clinically 
meaningful after comprehensive evaluation.Biomarker evaluation, including 
amyloid beta (Aβ), is crucial to support the intended mechanism of action.Aβ 
reduction did not correlate with the suppression of clinical symptom progression 
in individual cases.No biomarker is validated as a surrogate, and minimal 
clinically important difference cannot be inferred from Aβ reduction.

INTRODUCTION: While a limited number of disease-modifying treatments for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been approved in the United States, there is 
caution in adopting these treatments in clinical use. The electronic 
Person-Specific Outcome Measure (ePSOM) tool was recently developed to establish 
whether, besides modifying underlying AD pathology, new treatments exerted 
sufficient beneficial effects in areas that matter the most to an individual.
METHODS: We conducted a study to understand how findings from the ePSOM UK study 
applied in the United States. The ePSOM US survey (May 2023 to January 2024) 
collected primarily free-text responses in personally defined brain health 
priorities, alongside self-reported confidence in managing these priorities. We 
used natural language processing (k-means clustering of GloVe vectors) and 
chi-squared tests to examine differences between the US and UK populations' 
answers. We used a Mann-Whitney U test to compare the confidence ratings between 
participants with and without a self-reported diagnosis of neurodegenerative 
disease.
RESULTS: Our analysis included 764 participants in the United States (68.8% 
female; 74.2% high educational attainment) with a total of 9010 free-text 
responses, of whom 53 individuals (6.90%) reported neurodegenerative disease 
diagnosis. The comparable sample from the UK survey included 4529 participants 
with a total of 38,056 responses. There were statistically significant 
differences in the proportion of responses between the US and UK populations. 
The diagnosis group showed a significant difference in average total scores of 
self-reported confidence compared with those without a diagnosis (median score 
21, interquartile range [IQR] = 17 to 23 vs median score 24, IQR = 22 to 25, U = 
8908, p < .01).
DISCUSSION: Our study demonstrates heterogeneity in individual-level brain 
health priorities in the US and differences between the US and UK populations. 
The diagnosis group was significantly less confident in managing personally 
meaningful priorities. These findings support our hypothesis that what 
constitutes meaningful treatment benefits should be determined at an individual 
rather than group level, and cultural context needs to be considered.
HIGHLIGHTS: The study captured individually defined treatment priorities.A 
self-reported confidence rating was used to assess how people manage their most 
meaningful areas of lifeThe study found differences between US and UK 
participants' priorities.Neurodegenerative disease is associated with lower 
confidence in managing priorities.The ePSOM tool offers a method to assess 
meaningful treatment benefits.

BACKGROUND: Amyloid-beta (Aβ) oligomers, formed by Aβ aggregation, are the 
causative agent of Alzheimer's disease and induce the hyperphosphorylation of 
tau protein (Tau) and neurotoxicity. The antioxidant ergothioneine (ERGO) is 
transferred to the brain after oral ingestion and protects against Aβ- induced 
neurotoxicity and cognitive dysfunction. However, the impact of ERGO on Aβ 
oligomer-induced Tau phosphorylation remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of ERGO on Aβ-induced Tau phosphorylation 
and their mechanism in neurons.
METHOD: SH-SY5Y cells differentiated into cholinergic neuron-like cells or 
primary cultured neurons derived from the murine hippocampus were pretreated 
with ERGO and exposed to Aβ25-35 oligomers. Cytotoxicity was evaluated by 
assessing the chemiluminescence of dead cell-derived proteases. The expression 
of phosphorylated (p-) Tau at serine 396, p-glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta 
(GSK-3β) at serine 9, amyloid precursor protein (APP), beta-site amyloid 
precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1; β-secretase), and nicastrin, which 
is a component protein of the γ-secretase complex, was assessed by western 
blotting.
RESULT: Differentiated SH-SY5Y cells exhibited increased neurite outgrowth and 
mRNA expression of choline acetyltransferase, and showed cholinergic neuron-like 
characteristics compared with those of undifferentiated cells. ERGO 
significantly suppressed the Aβ25-35 oligomer-induced increased cytotoxicity and 
p-Tau expression in differentiated SH-SY5Y cells and cultured hippocampal 
neurons. ERGO recovered the decreased expression of p-GSK-3β at serine 9, 
indicating its inactivation, and the increased expression of APP, BACE1, and 
nicastrin induced by Aβ25-35 oligomer exposure in cultured hippocampal neurons. 
These ERGO effects on Aβ25-35 oligomers were inhibited by treatment with 
LY294002, which activated GSK-3β.
CONCLUSION: ERGO may suppress the increased expression of p-Tau and proteins 
involved in Aβ production induced by Aβ oligomers by inactivating GSK-3β, 
thereby mitigating neurotoxicity.

This paper explores the research progress of acupuncture for the prevention and 
treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) based on the "kidney-governor 
vessel-brain" axis. According to the fundamental pathogenesis of AD in 
traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), which attributes to kidney deficiency, 
marrow depletion, and impaired mental faculties, as well as the governor 
vessel's connection between the kidney and brain, the concept of the 
"kidney-governor vessel-brain" axis is proposed. The theoretical basis of the 
"kidney-governor vessel-brain" axis is analyzed based on the meridian pathway 
and physiological functions of the governor vessel, as well as the 
interdependent and mutually reinforcing relationships among the kidney, governor 
vessel, and brain. The relationship between AD and the "kidney-governor 
vessel-brain" axis is elucidated from both traditional medical theories and 
modern biological perspectives. Integrating clinical and mechanistic research on 
AD prevention and treatment based on this axis, it is suggested that the 
"kidney-governor vessel-brain" axis provides valuable insights and references 
for future research on AD prevention and treatment.

As the rates of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD and related dementias (ADRD) in 
the United States steadily rise, so too does the demand for informal caregiving. 
Research on AD/ADRD caregiving highlights the associated risk of adverse health 
outcomes and lower quality of life; however, there is a lack of discussion about 
Black male dementia caregivers, who already face unique health challenges. 
Through an intersectionality lens, this perspective will raise awareness of the 
multifaceted burden of Black male informal AD/ADRD caregiving, along with 
strategies to better support this underserved community. HIGHLIGHTS: The 
non-Hispanic Black population in the United States is disproportionately 
affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD and related dementias (ADRD), which 
will increase the demand for caregiving. Most dementia informal caregiving 
research focuses on non-Hispanic White females, with little emphasis on Black 
men, who represent an at-risk population. By adopting an intersectional 
approach, clinicians, researchers, and policymakers can better understand and 
improve the health of informal Black male AD/ADRD caregivers. The increasing 
prevalence of AD and ADRD in the US Black community can create an added strain 
on Black male informal caregivers. Examining the unique AD/ADRD caregiving needs 
of Black men can inform future research to improve the health of similar at-risk 
communities.

BACKGROUND: Oxytosis/ferroptosis is a form of non-apoptotic regulated cell death 
characterized by specific changes in the redox balance that lead to lethal lipid 
peroxidation. It has been hypothesized recently that aging predisposes the brain 
to the activation of oxytosis/ferroptosis in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 
consequently that inhibition of oxytosis/ferroptosis offers a path to develop a 
new class of therapeutics for the disease. The goal of the present study was to 
investigate the occurrence of oxytosis/ferroptosis in the AD brain by examining 
transcriptomic signatures of oxytosis/ferroptosis in cellular and animal models 
of AD as well as in human AD brain samples.
RESULTS: Since oxytosis/ferroptosis has been poorly defined at the RNA level, 
the publicly available datasets are limited. To address this limitation, we 
developed TrioSig, a gene signature generated from transcriptomic data of human 
microglia, astrocytes, and neurons treated with inducers of 
oxytosis/ferroptosis. It is shown that the different signatures of 
oxytosis/ferroptosis are enriched to varying extents in the brains of AD mice 
and human AD patients. The TrioSig signature was the most frequently found 
enriched, and bioinformatic analysis of its composition identified genes 
involved in the integrated stress response (ISR). It was confirmed in nerve cell 
culture that oxytosis/ferroptosis induces the ISR via phosphorylation of 
eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α) and activating 
transcription factor 4 (ATF4) signaling.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the involvement of oxytosis/ferroptosis in AD. The 
implications of the ISR for the progression and prevention of AD are discussed.

Background Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIAs), including 
edema/effusion (ARIA-E) and hemosiderin deposition (ARIA-H), are complications 
of anti-amyloid β (Aβ) monoclonal antibody therapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Case Presentation A Japanese woman in her 70s with mild cognitive impairment due 
to AD, confirmed by positive amyloid positron emission tomography, developed a 
new lobar cerebral microbleed (CMB) after participating in aducanumab clinical 
trials. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed juxtacortical white matter 
hyperintensities on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, which were later 
resolved as a novel CMB. Conclusions Juxtacortical white matter hyperintensities 
may precede ARIA-H and may suggest cerebral amyloid angiopathy-related changes 
during anti-Aβ therapy. Monitoring of these lesions is essential.

substance use disorders, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple 
sclerosis. This review investigates the core mechanisms driving demyelination, 
its clinical impact, and emerging therapeutic strategies aimed at maintaining or 
restoring myelin integrity. Disruption of myelin impairs crucial neural 
communication pathways, resulting in cognitive, motor, and behavioral deficits 
that substantially reduce quality of life and create significant economic and 
social challenges. Key contributors to demyelination include genetic 
predisposition, environmental triggers, immune dysregulation, neuroinflammation, 
and alterations in the gut-brain axis mediated by the vagus nerve. Promising 
therapies include sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulators and muscarinic 
acetylcholine receptor antagonists, both of which diminish immune-related myelin 
damage and may enhance neuroprotection. In addition, the novel antidepressant 
arketamine appears to boost myelination through transforming growth factor-β1 
signaling pathways. Approaches targeting the gut-brain axis, such as noninvasive 
transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation and fecal microbiota 
transplantation, may also help reduce inflammation and support myelin repair. 
Future research should center on clarifying the precise molecular mechanisms of 
demyelination, developing targeted therapies, and leveraging advanced 
neuroimaging for earlier detection and personalized treatment. By combining 
immunomodulatory and neuroprotective strategies, there is potential to 
significantly improve outcomes for individuals affected by demyelinating 
psychiatric and neurological disorders.

The identification of active interventions in neurodegenerative disorders is a 
major challenge in neurology; the use of repurposed drugs may represent a 
valuable strategy. Tetracyclines, a second generation of antibiotic molecules, 
offer various potential applications. Following an anecdotal observation of the 
potential anti-amyloidogenic activity of iododoxorubicin, the search for 
chemical analogs with a better safety profile led to tetracyclines. Their 
heterocyclic structures with a planar conformation interfere with b-sheet 
amyloid formation. Thus, doxycycline, a derivative with favorable blood-brain 
barrier penetration, emerged as a strong candidate to combat peripheral and 
central amyloidosis. In particular, we tested the anti-prion activity of 
doxycycline in vitro and in vivo experiments, confirming its capacity to disrupt 
or inhibit the formation of prion protein aggregates associated with 
pathological events. Treatment with doxycycline in human subjects with prion - 
related encephalopathies yielded contradictory results, suggesting that a 
preventive approach is a more favorable condition to verify efficacy; a clinical 
trial involving subjects at genetic risk of developing fatal familial insomnia, 
exposed to doxycycline for ten years, is currently ongoing. The 
anti-amyloidogenic capacity of doxycycline, combined with its safety profile in 
long-term treatment, has suggested its use in peripheral amyloidosis, which was 
tested with positive results. A specific interaction with β-amyloid or 
α-synuclein oligomers, as well as tau aggregation has also been demonstrated. 
More recently, the action of doxycycline has been extended to its 
anti-inflammatory and antioxidant capacities. In particular, the 
anti-inflammatory activity of doxycycline may explain the drug 's efficacy in 
numerous experimental models where protein misfolding has been associated with 
neuroinflammation, including Huntington's and Parkinson' s diseases. Thus, the 
pleiotropic action of doxycycline appears to be an interesting tool for 
addressing progressive neuronal dysfunction in multifactorial neurodegenerative 
diseases. The application of precision medicine principles to doxycycline 
treatment represents the best strategy to determine its efficacy. These aspects 
are illustrated here concerning another pleiotropic tetracycline, minocycline.

BACKGROUND: Using remote monitoring technology in the context of Alzheimer 
disease (AD) care presents exciting new opportunities to lessen caregiver stress 
and improve patient care quality. The application of wearables, environmental 
sensors, and smart home systems designed specifically for patients with AD 
represents a promising interdisciplinary approach that integrates advanced 
technology with health care to enhance patient safety, monitor health parameters 
in real time, and provide comprehensive support to caregivers.
OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study included evaluating the effectiveness of 
various remote sensing technologies in enhancing patient outcomes and 
identifying strategies to alleviate the burden on health care professionals and 
caregivers. Critical elements such as regulatory compliance, user-centered 
design, privacy and security considerations, and the overall efficacy of 
relevant technologies were comprehensively examined. Ultimately, this study 
aimed to propose a comprehensive remote monitoring framework tailored to the 
needs of patients with AD and related dementias.
METHODS: Guided by the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews 
and Meta-Analyses) framework, we conducted a systematic review on remote 
monitoring for patients with AD and related dementias. Our search spanned 4 
major electronic databases-Google Scholar, PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and DBLP on 
February 20, 2024, with an updated search on May 18, 2024.
RESULTS: A total of 31 publications met the inclusion criteria, highlighting 4 
key research areas: existing remote monitoring technologies, balancing 
practicality and empathy, security and privacy in monitoring, and technology 
design for AD care. The studies revealed a strong focus on various remote 
monitoring methods for capturing behavioral, physiological, and environmental 
data yet showed a gap in evaluating these methods for patient and caregiver 
needs, privacy, and usability. The findings also indicated that many studies 
lacked robust reference standards and did not consistently apply critical 
appraisal criteria, underlining the need for comprehensive frameworks that 
better integrate these essential considerations.
CONCLUSIONS: This comprehensive literature review of remote monitoring 
technologies for patients with AD provides an understanding of remote monitoring 
technologies, trends, and gaps in the current research and the significance of 
novel strategies for remote monitoring to enhance patient outcomes and reduce 
the burden among health professionals and caregivers. The proposed remote 
monitoring framework aims to inspire the development of new interdisciplinary 
research models that advance care for patients with AD.

Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) is a key pro-inflammatory cytokine implicated 
in the pathogenesis of numerous inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, including 
rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and neurodegenerative 
disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Effective inhibition of TNFα is essential 
for mitigating disease progression and improving patient outcomes. In this 
study, we present the development and comprehensive characterization of potent 
humanized TNFα inhibitory nanobodies (TNFI-Nbs) derived from camelid 
single-domain antibodies. In silico analysis of the original camelid nanobodies 
revealed low immunogenicity, which was further reduced through machine 
learning-guided humanization and developability optimization. The two humanized 
TNFI-Nb variants we developed demonstrated high anti-TNFα activity, achieving 
IC₅₀ values in the picomolar range. Binding assays confirmed their high affinity 
for TNFα, underscoring robust neutralization capabilities. These TNFI-Nbs 
present valid alternatives to conventional monoclonal antibodies currently used 
in human therapy, offering potential advantages in potency, specificity, and 
reduced immunogenicity. Our findings establish a solid foundation for further 
preclinical development and clinical translation of TNFα-targeted nanobody 
therapies in TNFα-mediated diseases.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative brain 
disorder, and autophagy crafts a new dawn on AD therapeutics. However, whether 
LINC00672 exerts its biological effects involvement in autophagy-mediated 
mechanisms in AD remain obscure.
METHODS: SH-SY5Y cells were treated with Amyloid Beta 1-42 (Aβ1-42, Aβ), while 
an AD mouse model was established using streptozotocin (STZ). The effects of 
LINC00672 overexpression on cell proliferation, apoptosis, and autophagy were 
evaluated in Aβ-stimulated SH-SY5Y cells. Besides, the impact of LINC00672 on 
cognitive function and pathological changes of the hippocampal tissues were 
validated in AD mice. Additionally, the interaction between LINC00672 
overexpression and GPNMB silencing were determined in vitro.
RESULTS: Aβ stimulation diminished viability, augmented apoptosis, restricted 
the activation of autophagy in SH-SY5Y cells, while these alterations were 
partially abolished by LINC00672 overexpression. Furthermore, LINC00672 
upregulation could improve cognitive impairment, and attenuate neuronal damage 
and even death in the STZ-treated AD mice. Additionally, GPNMB knockdown 
aggravated the improved neuronal injury and relatively restrained autophagy in 
Aβ-stimulated cells after LINC00672 overexpression.
CONCLUSIONS: LINC00672 exerted a protective effect in the AD progression by 
upregulating GPNMB to promote autophagy.

OBJECTIVES: The brain and its cognitive functions are most liable to stress, 
where it is known to promote the pathological manifestation of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). This study aimed to investigate the effect of a 2-week-period of 
restraint stress (RS), as well as the protective effect of Quercetin in a 
dose-dependent manner against the early start of AD via studying the NLRP3 
inflammasome pathway.
METHODS: The rats were divided into four groups: control (Con), induction (Ind), 
where 6 h/day for 2 weeks of RS was induced, low and high doses of Q (Q1+Ind and 
Q2+Ind, respectively), which were administered before the induction of RS for 
the same period. Behavioral tests were performed to assess the cognitive 
functions.
KEY FINDINGS: The higher dose of Q has shown more inhibition of the NLRP3 
inflammasome pathway, oxidative stress, as well as the phosphorylated-tau and 
amyloid-β (Aβ) protein, which were significantly fired up by the 2 weeks of RS. 
These results were backed with the improved cellular structure in the 
histopathological examination and enhanced cognitive functions, where the two 
doses of Q have shown their protective effect.
CONCLUSIONS: This proves that Q shielded the brain against the initial 
pathogenesis of AD, induced by 2 weeks of RS.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is comorbid condition in epilepsy. Mitochondrial 
dysfunction serves as a common disease mechanism. This study aimed to develop a 
new mouse of epilepsy-associated AD by inhibiting mitochondrial complex-I and 
exploring neurochemistry to identify therapeutic targets. Swiss albino mice were 
divided into naïve, corneal kindled (CK), and rotenone corneal kindled (RCK) 
groups. CK underwent epileptogenesis by using 6 Hz corneal kindling model 
(15 mA, 20 V, 6-Hz, 3 s for 15 days), while RCK underwent both epileptogenesis 
and mitochondrial dysfunction via rotenone administration (2.5 mg/kg, i.p 
daily). RCK mice exhibited generalised tonic-clonic seizures, cognitive 
deficits, oxidative stress, and Aβ/tau deposition. Neurochemical analysis showed 
increased glutamate, kynurenine, and reduced GABA, taurine, monoamines, 
antioxidants, and acetylcholinesterase activity. The RCK model replicates 
construct and face validity of both epilepsy and AD, may serve as a new model to 
investigate shared disease mechanisms and associated altered neurotransmitter as 
therapeutic approach.

Scopolamine-induced memory impairment is a well-established model for studying 
the therapeutic potential of novel compounds in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). This study aimed to evaluate the protective effects and underlying 
mechanisms of anethole against scopolamine-induced memory and cognitive 
disorders. Rats were treated with scopolamine (0.7 mg/kg, i.p.) for 14 
consecutive days. Anethole (125, 250, and 500 mg/kg, i.g.) was administered one 
hour prior to scopolamine injection. Memory and cognitive performance were 
assessed using the Passive Avoidance Test (PAT) and the Novel Object Recognition 
Test (NORT). In addition, blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, brain water 
content (BWC), and hippocampal levels of oxidative stress markers, inflammatory 
cytokines, acetylcholine (ACh), and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) were evaluated 
following the behavioral tests. Histological changes in the hippocampus were 
examined using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Anethole treatment 
significantly improved scopolamine-induced memory deficits in both NORT and PAT. 
Furthermore, anethole reduced BBB permeability and BWC in the AD rat model. 
Hippocampal levels of oxidative stress and inflammation were also attenuated 
following anethole administration. Additionally, anethole exerted cholinergic 
effects by inhibiting AChE and increasing ACh levels in the scopolamine-induced 
AD model. The neuroprotective effects of anethole were further confirmed by H&E 
staining. Our findings demonstrate that anethole effectively reverses 
scopolamine-induced memory and cognitive impairments through antioxidant, 
anti-inflammatory, and anticholinesterase mechanisms in rats. Therefore, 
anethole may be considered a promising therapeutic candidate for alleviating 
symptoms of AD and warrants further investigation in future studies.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder characterized 
by progressive memory loss and cognitive decline. It involves the irreversible 
destruction of higher brain structures, leading to significant cognitive 
deficits, personality changes, and aberrant behavior. Key pathological features 
include the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and hyperphosphorylated 
tau protein neurofibrillary tangles, which disrupt cellular communication and 
neuron function. Chronic inflammation, vascular abnormalities, and genetic 
factors like the APOE (apolipoprotein E) ε4 allele also play crucial roles in AD 
progression. Epidemiological data indicate a substantial global impact, 
especially among older adults, with women disproportionately affected. Animal 
models, both transgenic and non-transgenic, are pivotal in researching AD 
pathophysiology and potential treatments. This review presents a full overview 
regarding a variety of non-transgenic rodent models of Alzheimer's disease 
utilized in the preclinical research for treatment approaches in Alzheimer's 
disease.

Taipei City, Taiwan (R.O.C.).

Despite the growing number of people living at home with dementia, there is a 
lack of home-based music intervention, especially in Chinese-speaking societies. 
This study implemented a music care program and assessed its impact on the 
relationship between caregivers and people living with dementia in Taiwan. We 
recruited family caregivers of people with dementia for a non-randomized 
controlled trial. The experimental group participated in a 12-week Music Care 
Training Program for Dementia Caregivers and practiced music activities at home. 
Meanwhile, the control group provided standard care to their care recipients. 
The Mutuality, Positive Aspects of Care, and Rewards of Caregiving scales and 
the WHO-5 Well-being Index were implemented before and after the intervention. 
We used the scales' pretest scores as covariates and performed an analysis of 
covariance to compare the differences between the two groups. The experimental 
group consisted of 14 caregivers aged 43-76 years (with only one male), whereas 
the control group consisted of 11 caregivers aged 50-75 years (all female). 
After the intervention, ANCOVA results indicated the experimental group showed 
significantly higher scores than the control group on the Positive Aspects of 
Care scale and minor positive changes in the WHO-5 Well-being Index. In 
conclusion, caregivers' scores on the Positive Aspects of Care scale improved 
following the Music Care Program, which might suggest the program's potential 
effect on fostering positive experiences and improving relationships between 
caregivers and care recipients.

Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis are characterized by progressive neuronal loss and the accumulation of 
misfolded proteins including amyloid proteins. Current therapeutic options 
include the use of antibodies for these proteins, but novel chemical strategies 
need to be developed. The disaccharide trehalose has been widely reported to 
prevent misfolding and aggregation of proteins, and we therefore investigated 
the conjugation of this moiety to biocompatible peptide amphiphiles (TPAs) known 
to undergo supramolecular polymerization. Using X-ray scattering, circular 
dichroism, and infrared spectroscopy, we found that trehalose conjugation 
destabilized the internal β-sheet structures within the TPA supramolecular 
polymers as evidenced by a lower thermal transition. Thioflavin T fluorescence 
showed that these metastable TPA nanofibers suppressed A42 aggregation. 
Interestingly, we found that the suppression involved supramolecular 
copolymerization of TPA polymers with Aβ42, which effectively trapped the 
peptides within the filamentous structures. In vitro assays with human induced 
pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons demonstrated that these TPAs significantly 
improved neuron survival compared to other conditions. Our study highlights the 
potential of properly tuned supramolecular polymerizations of monomers to safely 
remove amyloidogenic proteins in neurodegeneration.

Harmonized neuropsychological assessment for neurocognitive disorders (NCDs) is 
an urgent priority in clinics. Neuropsychology assessments in NCDs seldom 
include tests exploring social cognitive skills. In 2022, we launched the 
SIGNATURE initiative to optimize socio-cognitive assessment in NCDs. Here, we 
report findings from the first initiative phase, including consortium creation 
and evaluation of the state of the art in socio-cognitive assessment in memory 
clinics. We developed an ad hoc online survey to explore practices and measures, 
relevance, and obstacles preventing the use of socio-cognitive testing in 
clinics. The survey was distributed within the SIGNATURE network. National 
coordinators were identified to disseminate the survey to local collaborators 
and scientific societies active in the field of dementia and/or neuropsychology. 
Data were analysed in aggregate form and stratified by geographical area and 
variables of interest. Four hundred and thirteen (413) responses from 10 
European and Latin American geographical regions were recorded. Responders were 
balanced between physicians and psychologists. Seventy-eight (78) % of 
respondents reported no/limited experience with socio-cognitive measures; more 
than 85% agreed on their relevance in clinics. Ekman-60 faces was the most 
well-known and/or used task, followed by the Faux-Pas and 
Reading-the-Mind-in-the-Eyes tests. Lack of clinical measures, assessment time, 
guidelines, and education/training were reported as main obstacles. Real-life 
barriers prevent the adoption of socio-cognitive testing in clinics. 
Bidirectional collaboration between clinicians and researchers is required to 
address clinical needs and constraints and facilitate consistent socio-cognitive 
assessment.

Four decades of the National Institute on Aging's sponsored research into 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) have resulted in symptomatic and mechanistic therapies, 
lifestyle interventions, increased understanding of genetic factors and protein 
misfolding, and descriptions of non-AD neuropathological entities that mimic AD 
clinical symptoms. This is an overview of contributions from one of the original 
ten Alzheimer Disease Research Centers (ADRCs), the University of Kentucky ADRC. 
We celebrate 40 years of helping the field to define early pathogenetic 
mechanisms underlying transitions from normal cognitive aging to impairment in 
our elderly community-based cohort, increased appreciation of the heterogeneity 
and multiple pathologies that characterize late-life dementia, strategies for 
therapeutic intervention, and novel statistical approaches. We also highlight 
our educational efforts to train the workforce of the future and our 
long-standing community outreach and partnerships. HIGHLIGHTS: The University of 
Kentucky Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (UK-ADRC) is an experienced and 
collaborative center celebrating its 40th year of National Institute on Aging 
funding in 2025. Our long-standing community-based cohort of motivated older 
adult volunteers and strong neuropathology program support the rationale for our 
overarching theme: "Transitions from Normal to Late-Life Multi-Etiology 
Dementia." The UK-ADRC's focus on normal aging and early cognitive transitions 
has been central to elucidating pathogenic mechanisms underlying transitions 
from normal cognitive aging to impairment and defining the heterogeneity and 
multiple pathologies that characterize late-life dementia. UK-ADRC 
infrastructure and resources support and create new opportunities for innovative 
and inclusive research, clinical programs across the cognitive continuum, 
educational and training opportunities, and community and national partnerships.

AIM: To investigate the role and mechanism of uridine (URI), an active component 
in deer antler, in improving cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
mice.
METHOD: The APP/PS1 mouse model was used for AD. After URI gavage 
administration, cognitive behavioral changes in mice were detected using the 
Morris water maze, eight-arm maze, and novel object recognition tests. Levels of 
inflammatory cytokines and lactate, pyruvate in the cortex were measured. The 
proportions of IBA-1 and CD86 cells in tissues were detected, and the expression 
of key glycolysis proteins was examined. Network pharmacology was employed to 
analyze the targets of URI-AD-glycolysis. AAV-CMV-shHSP90 was injected to knock 
down brain HSP90 levels to further explore the anti-AD mechanism of URI. 
In vitro, primary microglia were used to detect the proportion of CD86+ M1 cells 
and glycolysis levels.
RESULT: URI can improve cognitive impairment in AD mice, with significant 
changes in cognitive ability and behavior. URI reduces glycolysis levels, the 
proportion of M1 cells (CD86+), and the activation degree of microglia, while 
inhibiting the activation of HSP90-HIF-1α. Network pharmacology analysis 
revealed that HSP90 is a major target of URI. When HSP90 is inhibited, the 
effect of URI is diminished. In vitro experiments showed that URI can inhibit 
the M1 polarization of microglia and reduce glycolysis levels.
CONCLUSION: URI can inhibit microglial glycolysis and M1 polarization via 
HSP90/HIF-1α, thereby improving cognitive behavioral deficits in AD mice due to 
neuroinflammation. Uridine in deer antler is a novel small molecule for anti-AD.

Lipocalin 2 Facilitates the Initial Compromise of the Blood-Brain Barrier 
Integrity in Chronic Cerebral Hypoperfusion.

AIMS: Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is primarily attributed to vascular 
risk factors and cerebrovascular disease. Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) 
initiates in the early stages of VCI and contributes to blood-brain barrier 
(BBB) disruption. Nevertheless, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying this 
process remain elusive and warrant further investigation.
METHODS: The Bilateral Carotid Artery Stenosis (BCAS) model was employed to 
simulate CCH, and the permeability of the BBB in the mouse frontal cortex was 
assessed at various time points post-operation. Transcriptome sequencing was 
conducted to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs), which were then 
intersected with cortical gene chip data from human vascular dementia cases. Key 
genes identified through this analysis were subsequently measured in the serum 
of VCI patients and correlated with cognitive performance scores. Additionally, 
in vivo experiments were conducted to validate the influence of these key genes 
on BBB endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) and peripheral neutrophil 
infiltration.
RESULTS: Time-course studies investigating BBB disruption revealed an increase 
in BBB permeability in the frontal cortex of mice on day 14 following BCAS, a 
stage at which the mice had not yet exhibited cognitive impairment. Subsequent 
sequencing analyses, integrated with human cortical gene expression profiles, 
identified Lipocalin 2 (LCN2) as a pivotal gene involved in mediating 
inflammatory responses and cell migration. Clinical studies have demonstrated 
that LCN2 is upregulated in the serum of patients with VCI and exhibits a 
significant negative correlation with Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) 
scores. Downregulation of LCN2 leads to a reduction in EndMT markers and 
peripheral neutrophil infiltration, as well as significant enhancements in 
learning and memory in BCAS mice through modulation of the MEK/ERK signaling 
pathway.
CONCLUSION: This study elucidates the temporal characteristics and key molecular 
mechanisms underlying BBB disruption in the frontal cortex during CCH, thereby 
identifying novel potential targets for the early diagnosis and treatment of 
VCI.

BACKGROUND: HIV and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are significant global health 
challenges with overlapping neuroinflammatory and protein aggregation 
mechanisms. Understanding their intersection is critical for advancing 
therapeutic strategies, particularly in aging populations.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to provide a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of 
research trends at the intersection of HIV and AD, identify emerging themes, and 
highlight key contributors in this interdisciplinary field.
METHODS: Using the Web of Science Core Collection, we retrieved 4,856 articles 
and reviews published between 1994 and 2025. Bibliometric analysis was conducted 
with VOSviewer, CiteSpace, and R software to examine publication trends, 
international collaboration, institutional contributions, journal dynamics, 
author networks, and thematic evolution.
RESULTS: The analysis reveals a 14.18% annual growth rate in publications, with 
the U.S. leading in productivity, followed by China, Germany, and Japan. Key 
institutions include the NIH and the University of California System, while 
journals such as Journal of Biological Chemistry and PLOS ONE show significant 
growth. Prominent authors include Masliah, Eliezer, and Heaton, RK. Research 
highlights the overlap between HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) 
and AD, emphasizing shared mechanisms like neuroinflammation, protein 
aggregation, and blood-brain barrier disruption. Recent advances focus on 
cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, oxidative stress, and the impact of 
antiretroviral therapy (ART) on neurological outcomes. Studies increasingly 
explore the role of advanced methodologies, including machine learning, in 
elucidating shared mechanisms such as neuroinflammation, endoplasmic reticulum 
stress, and protein misfolding.
CONCLUSION: This bibliometric analysis underscores the dynamic and rapidly 
evolving research landscape at the intersection of HIV and AD, driven by 
collaborative efforts and technological advancements. Future research should 
prioritize longitudinal studies, mechanistic insights, and translational 
applications to address unanswered questions in this critical field.

Neurodegenerative diseases, contributing to the significant socioeconomic burden 
due to aging society, are gaining increasing interest. Despite each disease 
having different etiologies, neuroinflammation is believed to play a crucial 
role in Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and multiple 
sclerosis (MS). In addition to the pathogenic function of inflammation in the 
brain there is growing evidence that immune responses are essential for 
neuroregeneration. This review compares and contrasts the neuroinflammatory 
pathways that selected neurodegenerative diseases share and have in common. In 
AD, tau tangles and beta-amyloid plaques cause microglia and astrocytes to 
become activated in an inflammatory response. Alpha-synuclein aggregation 
stimulate neuroinflammation in Parkinson's disease, especially in the substantia 
nigra. In Multiple Sclerosis an autoimmune attack on myelin is connected to 
inflammation via invading immune cells. Commonalities include the release of 
pro-inflammatory mediators like cytokines and activation of signaling pathways 
such as NF-κB and MAPK. Comprehending these common routes is essential for 
discovering early diagnostic possibilities for the diseases and possible 
tailored treatments. Our work underscores the potential for insights into 
disease mechanisms. Identifying common targets offers promise for advancing our 
understanding and potential future treatment approaches across these 
debilitating disorders.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), and 
neuroinflammation. Monocytes and macrophages, particularly microglia, play a 
dual role in AD pathogenesis. In the early stages, they delay disease 
progression by phagocytosing Aβ, but chronic activation leads to Aβ accumulation 
and exacerbated neuroinflammation. Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) is 
a key regulator in neuroinflammation, Aβ deposition, and tau pathology, making 
it a potential therapeutic target. Moreover, recent breakthroughs in fluid and 
imaging biomarkers and targeted immunomodulatory agents underscore the growing 
importance of early diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. This review 
explores the complex interplay between monocytes, macrophages, and AD pathology, 
highlighting their roles in neuroinflammation, Aβ metabolism, and tau 
phosphorylation. Understanding these mechanisms offers new insights into 
developing effective diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic strategies for AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder affecting 
millions worldwide and imposing a significant social and economic burden. 
Despite extensive research, there is still no effective cure for this disease. 
AD is multifactorial and involves multiple etiopathogenic mechanisms, one of 
which is oxidative stress. Consequently, the Nrf2/ARE pathway, which regulates 
the expression of cellular defense genes, including those for antioxidant 
enzymes, is considered to be a prospective therapeutic target for AD. Meanwhile, 
multitarget-directed ligands (MTDLs) are a promising approach for developing 
effective AD medications. In this regard, we evaluated the antioxidant potential 
of eight chromone-containing MTDLs in vitro, including Nrf2 transcriptional 
activation potencies, Nrf2/ARE downstream genes activation, and antioxidant 
effects in vitro. All tested compounds effectively activated the Nrf2/ARE 
pathway. Notably, compounds 4b, 4c, 4f, and 4h demonstrated the highest Nrf2 
activation potencies, while compounds 4b, 4c, 4d, and 4g significantly induced 
the expression of Nrf2-target antioxidant genes, specifically NQO1 and HO1. 
Additionally, compound 4d exhibited a significant antioxidant effect in vitro. 
These findings encourage further investigation of the studied compounds, with 
particular emphasis on compound 4d as the most promising candidate.

Familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) is a complex multifactorial disorder 
clinically characterized by cognitive impairment and memory loss. 
Pathologically, FAD is characterized by intracellular accumulation of the 
protein fragment Aβ42 (iAβ), hyperphosphorylated microtubule-associated protein 
TAU (p-TAU), and extensive degeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons 
of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NbM) and the medial septal nucleus (MSN), 
mainly caused by mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 
(PSEN1), and PSEN2 gene. Since the dopaminergic system may contribute to FAD 
symptoms, alterations in the nigro-hippocampal pathway may be associated with 
cognitive impairment in FAD. Interestingly, p-α-synuclein (p-α-Syn), Aβ, and 
p-TAU have been found to coexist in vulnerable regions of postmortem AD brains. 
However, the mechanism by which Aβ, p-TAU, and α-Syn coexist in DAergic neurons 
in AD brains has not been determined. We generated PSEN1 I416T dopaminergic-like 
neurons (DALNs) from I416T menstrual stromal cells (MenSCs) in NeuroForsk 2.0 
medium for 7 days and then cultured them in minimal culture medium (MCm) for 
another 4 days. On day 11, DALNs were analyzed for molecular and pathological 
markers by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. We found that mutant 
DALNs showed increased accumulation of iAβ as well as increased phosphorylation 
of TAU at S202/T205 compared to WT DALNs. Thus, mutant DALNs exhibited typical 
pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, PSEN1 I416T DALNs 
showed concomitant signs of OS as evidenced by the appearance of oxidized sensor 
protein DJ-1 (i.e., DJ-1C106-SO3) and apoptotic markers TP53, pS63-c-JUN, PUMA, 
and cleavage caspase 3 (CC3). Notably, these DALNs exhibited PD-associated 
proteins such as intracellular accumulation of α-Syn (detected as aggregates of 
pS129-α-Syn) and phosphorylation of LRRK2 kinase at residue S935. In addition, 
mutant DALNs showed a 17.16- and 6.17-fold decrease in DA-induced Ca2+ flux, 
compared to WT DALNs. These observations suggest that iAβ and p-TAU, together 
with p-α-Syn, and p-LRRK2 kinase, may damage DAergic neurons and thereby 
contribute to the exacerbation of neuropathologic processes in FAD. Remarkably, 
the LRRK2 inhibitor PF-06447475 (PF-475) significantly reversed PSEN1 
I416T-induced neuropathological markers in DAergic neurons. PF-465 inhibitor 
reduced iAβ, oxDJ-1C106-SO3, and p-TAU. In addition, this inhibitor reduced 
pS935-LRRK2, pS129-αSYN, pS63-c-JUN, and CC3. We conclude that the observed 
neuroprotective effects of PF-475 are due to direct inhibition of LRRK2 activity 
and that the LRRK2 protein is upstream of the molecular cascade of apoptosis and 
proteinopathy. Our results suggest that PF-475 is an effective neuroprotective 
agent against endogenous PSEN1 I416T-induced neurotoxicity in DALNs coexisting 
with Parkinson's disease markers. Therefore, PF-475 may be of great therapeutic 
value in FAD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized 
by cognitive decline, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, amyloid-beta (Aβ) 
accumulation, and tau protein hyperphosphorylation. In this study, we 
synthesized novel Ramalin derivatives and evaluated their therapeutic potential 
against AD, focusing on antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective 
activities. RA-2OMe, RA-4OMe, RA-2CF3, and RA-4OCF3 showed strong antioxidant 
effects, while RA-2OMe exhibited potent NO and NLRP3 inhibition (~20%). RA-NAP, 
RA-PYD, and RA-2Q showed moderate anti-inflammatory activity. BACE-1 inhibition 
was significant in RA-3CF3, RA-NAP, and RA-PYD, with IC50 values lower than that 
of positive control, indicating greater inhibitory potency. RA-NAP and RA-PYD 
effectively inhibited both Aβ and tau aggregation, highlighting their 
multi-target potential for AD therapy. These findings indicate that Ramalin 
derivatives exhibit potential for multi-target activity in AD treatment. 
However, further studies on their pharmacokinetics, in vivo efficacy, and 
long-term safety are required to confirm their therapeutic applicability.

This review covers preclinical studies of stilbene derivative compounds (both 
natural and synthetic) with potential preventive and therapeutic effects against 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is a worldwide neurodegenerative disease 
characterized by the destruction of nerve cells in the brain and the loss of 
cognitive function due to aging. Stilbenes are a unique class of natural 
phenolic compounds distinguished by a C6-C2-C6 (1,2-diphenylethylene) structure 
and two aromatic rings connected by an ethylene bridge. Stilbenes' distinct 
features make them an intriguing subject for pharmacological research and 
development. Several preclinical studies have suggested that stilbenes may have 
neuroprotective effects by reducing Aβ generation and oligomerization, enhancing 
Aβ clearance, and regulating tau neuropathology through the prevention of 
aberrant tau phosphorylation and aggregation, as well as scavenging reactive 
oxygen species. Synthetic stilbene derivatives also target multiple pathways 
involved in neuroprotection and have demonstrated promising biological activity 
in vitro. However, some properties of stilbenes, such as sensitivity to 
physiological conditions, low solubility, poor permeability, instability, and 
low bioavailability, limit their usefulness in clinical applications. To address 
this issue, current investigations have developed new drug delivery systems 
based on stilbene derivative molecules. This review aims to shed light on the 
development of next-generation treatment strategies by examining in detail the 
role of stilbenes in Alzheimer's pathophysiology and their therapeutic 
potential.

The early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease remains an unmet medical need due to 
the cost and invasiveness of current methods. Early detection would ensure a 
higher quality of life for patients, enabling timely and suitable treatment. We 
investigate microwave sensing for low-cost, non-intrusive early detection and 
assessment of Alzheimer's disease. This study is based on the emerging evidence 
that the electromagnetic properties of cerebrospinal fluid are affected by 
abnormal concentrations of proteins recognized as early-stage biomarkers. We 
design a conformal six-element antenna array placed on the upper portion of the 
head, operating in the 500 MHz to 6.5 GHz band. It measures scattering response 
due to changes in the dielectric properties of intracranial cerebrospinal fluid. 
A multi-layer perceptron network extracts the diagnostic information. Data 
classification consists of two steps: binary classification to identify the 
disease presence and multi-class classification to evaluate its stage. The 
algorithm is trained and validated through controlled experiments mimicking 
various pathological severities with an anthropomorphic multi-tissue head 
phantom. Results support the feasibility of the proposed method using only 
amplitude data and lay the foundation for more extensive studies on microwave 
sensing for early Alzheimer's detection.

BACKGROUND: Methylglyoxal (MGO), a reactive dicarbonyl compound, has been 
implicated in the formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) and 
neuronal dysfunction. This study investigated the neuroprotective effects of the 
combination of trans-resveratrol and hesperidin (tRES-HESP) against MGO-induced 
neurotoxicity, focusing on memory dysfunction and depression-like behavior.
METHODS: Neuroblastoma 2a (N2a) cells were treated with MGO to induce 
neurotoxicity. The effects of tRES-HESP on cell viability, reactive oxygen 
species (ROS) production, apoptotic markers (BAX/Bcl 2 ratio, caspase 3 
activity, and poly [ADP ribose] polymerase cleavage), and components of the 
glyoxalase system (glyoxalase-1, glyoxalase- 2, and receptors for AGEs) were 
assessed. The activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/Nuclear 
factor erythroid-2-related factor 2/Heme oxygenase-1 (Keap1/Nrf2/HO-1) pathway 
was also evaluated. In vivo, mice with MGO-induced depressive amnesia were 
treated with tRES-HESP (200 mg/kg) for eight weeks, and behavioral, biochemical, 
and histological assessments were performed.
RESULTS: tRES-HESP significantly reduced MGO-induced cytotoxicity, ROS 
production, and apoptosis in N2a cells. In addition, it restored the glyoxalase 
system and activated the Keap1/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. In an in vivo model, tRES-HESP 
improved memory and depression-like behaviors, reduced cortisol and interleukin 
(IL)-6 levels, increased IL-10 levels, and lowered the expression of amyloid 
precursor protein and amyloid beta. Furthermore, tRES-HESP protected CA2/3 
hippocampal subregions from MGO-induced damage. tRES-HESP exhibited 
neuroprotective effects through antioxidant, anti-apoptotic, and 
anti-inflammatory mechanisms.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that tRES-HESP is a potential dietary 
supplement for preventing cognitive decline and depression, particularly in 
neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. Further studies are 
required to assess its clinical relevance and efficacy in the human population.

Curcumin, a polyphenolic compound derived from Curcuma longa, has gained 
significant attention for its potential therapeutic benefits, particularly 
counteracting inflammation, oxidative stress, and metabolic disorders. Its 
chemical structure, featuring conjugated double bonds between two aromatic 
rings, allows it to act as an electron donor, thereby mitigating free radical 
formation. Despite its poor solubility in water, curcumin is stable in acidic 
environments and undergoes significant metabolism in both the liver and the gut. 
Intestinal microbiota, particularly at the colon level, further metabolizes 
curcumin into several derivatives, including dihydrocurcumin and 
tetrahydrocurcumin, which exhibit antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. 
Studies suggest that curcumin can reduce body mass index (BMI) and improve other 
body composition parameters, especially when used in combination with lifestyle 
changes, though its bioavailability is low due to its rapid metabolism and the 
resulting low blood concentration. In obesity, dysfunctional adipose tissue 
remodeling and chronic inflammation play critical roles in the development of 
metabolic complications. Curcumin's anti-inflammatory properties are related to 
the inhibition of the NF-κB pathway, leading to the reduction in inflammatory 
markers in adipocytes and macrophages. Additionally, curcumin modulates 
oxidative stress by activating the NRF2 pathway, enhancing cellular antioxidant 
defenses. Emerging evidence also supports curcumin's potential in improving gut 
health by modulating microbiota composition, enhancing intestinal barrier 
function, and reducing systemic inflammation. This interaction with the 
gut-brain axis highlights the broader implications of curcumin in 
neuroprotection, as it positively affects cognitive function and mitigates 
neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's. disease. Thus, 
curcumin holds promise as a multifaceted agent in the management of obesity and 
associated diseases.

Scorpion Venom Heat-Resistant Synthetic Peptide Alleviates Neuronal Necroptosis 
in Alzheimer's Disease Model by Regulating Lnc Gm6410 Under PM(2.5) Exposure.

China.

Recent epidemiological studies have indicated that exposure to particulate 
matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 μm or less in the ambient air (PM2.5) 
is significantly associated with an elevated risk of developing Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) and its progression. Scorpion venom heat-resistant synthetic 
peptide (SVHRSP) exhibits anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. 
However, the exact ways in which SVHRSP mitigates the progression of AD induced 
by PM2.5 are still unknown. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) plays a crucial role in 
various biological processes. Necroptosis, a form of programmed cell death, has 
garnered considerable attention in recent years. This study aims to investigate 
whether Lnc Gm16410 and neuronal necroptosis are involved in PM2.5-exacerbated 
AD progression and the mechanisms of SVHRSP in alleviating this process. Through 
the establishment of a PM2.5 exposure model in AD mice and an in vitro model, it 
was found that PM2.5 exposure could promote necroptosis and the down-regulation 
of Lnc Gm16410, thereby promoting the progression of AD. Behavioral tests showed 
that SVHRSP alleviated cognitive impairment in PM2.5-induced AD mice. WB, 
qRT-PCR, and other molecular biological assays indicate that Lnc Gm16410 
regulates neuronal necroptosis under PM2.5 exposure via the p38 MAPK pathway. 
SVHRSP is a potential regulator of AD progression by regulating Lnc Gm16410 to 
alleviate PM2.5 exposure-induced necroptosis. These findings offer new insights 
into the mechanism through which PM2.5 exposure accelerates the progression of 
AD, examined from the perspective of LncRNA. Furthermore, we offer new targets 
for the treatment and prevention of AD following PM2.5 exposure by investigating 
the mechanism of action of SVHRSP in alleviating AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid-beta (Aβ) pathology and is 
closely linked to oxidative stress, which contributes to blood-brain barrier 
leakage, renal dysfunction, and cognitive decline. We investigated the effects 
of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), an FDA-approved antioxidant, on oxidative stress, 
brain Aβ levels, barrier leakage, renal function, and cognition in 5xFAD mice. 
Eight-week-old 5xFAD mice were fed a rodent diet supplemented with 600 mg/kgDiet 
NAC for 4 weeks; wild-type (WT) mice and control 5xFAD mice were fed a regular 
rodent diet. We detected elevated brain and renal 4-hydroxynonenal(4-HNE) 
levels, reduced creatinine clearance, and increased plasma S100β levels in 
untreated 5xFAD mice compared to WT controls. Untreated 5xFAD mice also had 
higher capillary leakage, reduced P-gp activity, and impaired cognition compared 
to WT. NAC treatment of 5xFAD mice reduced brain Aβ40 levels, normalized 4-HNE 
levels to control levels, improved creatinine clearance, decreased capillary 
leakage, and lowered S100β plasma levels. NAC improved cognitive performance in 
5xFAD mice, as shown by Y-maze. Our findings indicate that Aβ-induced oxidative 
stress contributes to barrier dysfunction, renal impairment, and cognitive 
deficits in 5xFAD mice. Notably, NAC treatment mitigates these effects, 
suggesting its potential as an adjunct therapy for AD and other Aβ-related 
pathologies by reducing oxidative stress.

The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has become one of the cornerstones 
of neuropathology, influencing synaptic plasticity, cognitive resilience, and 
neuronal survival. Apart from its molecular biology, BDNF is a powerful target 
for transformative benefit in precision medicine, leading to innovative 
therapeutic approaches for neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases like 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), major depressive disorder 
(MDD), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Nevertheless, clinical 
applicability is obstructed by hurdles in delivery, patient-specific diversity, 
and pleiotropic signaling. Here, we summarize findings in BDNF research, 
including its regulatory pathways and diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers and 
integrative therapeutic approaches. We describe innovative delivery systems, 
such as lipid nanoparticle-based mRNA therapies and CRISPR-dCas9-based 
epigenetic editing that bypass obstacles such as BBB (blood-brain barrier) and 
enzymatic degradation. The recent implementation of multiplex panels combining 
BDNF biodynamic indicators with tau and amyloid-β signaling markers showcases 
novel levels of specificity for both early detection and potential therapeutic 
monitoring. Humanized preclinical models like iPSC-derived neurons and organoids 
point to the key role of BDNF in neurodeveloping and neurodegenerative 
processes, paralleling advances in bridging preclinical observation and clinical 
environments. Moreover, novel therapeutic tools delivering TrkB activators or 
the implementation of AI-based dynamic care platforms enable tailored and 
scalable treatments. This review also aims to extend a framework used in the 
understanding of BDNF's relevance to traditional neurodegenerative models by 
situating more recent work detailing BDNF's actions in ischemic tissues and the 
gut-brain axis in the context of systemic health. Finally, we outline a roadmap 
for the incorporation of BDNF-centered therapies into worldwide healthcare, 
highlighting ethical issues, equity, and interdisciplinary decomposition. The 
therapeutic potential of BDNF heralds a new era in neuroscience and medicine, 
revolutionizing brain health and paving the way for the advancement of precision 
medicine.

Alzheimer's Is a Multiform Disease of Sustained Neuronal Integrated Stress 
Response Driven by the C99 Fragment Generated Independently of AβPP; Proteolytic 
Production of Aβ Is Suppressed in AD-Affected Neurons: Evolution of a Theory.

The present Perspective analyzes the remarkable evolution of the Amyloid Cascade 
Hypothesis 2.0 (ACH2.0) theory of Alzheimer's disease (AD) since its inception a 
few years ago, as reflected in the diminishing role of amyloid-beta (Aβ) in the 
disease. In the initial iteration of the ACH2.0, Aβ-protein-precursor 
(AβPP)-derived intraneuronal Aβ (iAβ), accumulated to neuronal integrated stress 
response (ISR)-eliciting levels, triggers AD. The neuronal ISR, in turn, 
activates the AβPP-independent production of its C99 fragment that is processed 
into iAβ, which drives the disease. The second iteration of the ACH2.0 stemmed 
from the realization that AD is, in fact, a disease of the sustained neuronal 
ISR. It introduced two categories of AD-conventional and 
unconventional-differing mainly in the manner of their causation. The former is 
caused by the neuronal ISR triggered by AβPP-derived iAβ, whereas in the latter, 
the neuronal ISR is elicited by stressors distinct from AβPP-derived iAβ and 
arising from brain trauma, viral and bacterial infections, and various types of 
inflammation. Moreover, conventional AD always contains an unconventional 
component, and in both forms, the disease is driven by iAβ generated 
independently of AβPP. In its third, the current, iteration, the ACH2.0 posits 
that proteolytic production of Aβ is suppressed in AD-affected neurons and that 
the disease is driven by C99 generated independently of AβPP. Suppression of Aβ 
production in AD seems an oxymoron: Aβ is equated with AD, and the later is 
inconceivable without the former in an ingrained Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis 
(ACH)-based notion. But suppression of Aβ production in AD-affected neurons is 
where the logic leads, and to follow it we only need to overcome the inertia of 
the preexisting assumptions. Moreover, not only is the generation of Aβ 
suppressed, so is the production of all components of the AβPP proteolytic 
pathway. This assertion is not a quantum leap (unless overcoming the inertia 
counts as such): the global cellular protein synthesis is severely suppressed 
under the neuronal ISR conditions, and there is no reason for constituents of 
the AβPP proteolytic pathway to be exempted, and they, apparently, are not, as 
indicated by the empirical data. In contrast, tau protein translation persists 
in AD-affected neurons under ISR conditions because the human tau mRNA contains 
an internal ribosomal entry site in its 5'UTR. In current mouse models, iAβ 
derived from AβPP expressed exogenously from human transgenes elicits the 
neuronal ISR and thus suppresses its own production. Its levels cannot 
principally reach AD pathology-causing levels regardless of the number of 
transgenes or the types of FAD mutations that they (or additional transgenes) 
carry. Since the AβPP-independent C99 production pathway is inoperative in mice, 
the current transgenic models have no potential for developing the full spectrum 
of AD pathology. What they display are only effects of the AβPP-derived 
iAβ-elicited neuronal ISR. The paper describes strategies to construct adequate 
transgenic AD models. It also details the utilization of human neuronal cells as 
the only adequate model system currently available for conventional and 
unconventional AD. The final alteration of the ACH2.0, introduced in the present 
Perspective, is that AβPP, which supports neuronal functionality and viability, 
is, after all, potentially produced in AD-affected neurons, albeit not 
conventionally but in an ISR-driven and -compatible process. Thus, the present 
narrative begins with the "omnipotent" Aβ capable of both triggering and driving 
the disease and ends up with this peptide largely dislodged from its pedestal 
and retaining its central role in triggering the disease in only one, although 
prevalent (conventional), category of AD (and driving it in none). Among 
interesting inferences of the present Perspective is the determination that 
"sporadic AD" is not sporadic at all ("non-familial" would be a much better 
designation). The term has fatalistic connotations, implying that the disease 
can strike at random. This is patently not the case: The conventional disease 
affects a distinct subpopulation, and the basis for unconventional AD is well 
understood. Another conclusion is that, unless prevented, the occurrence of 
conventional AD is inevitable given a sufficiently long lifespan. This 
Perspective also defines therapeutic directions not to be taken as well as 
auspicious ways forward. The former category includes ACH-based drugs (those 
interfering with the proteolytic production of Aβ and/or depleting extracellular 
Aβ). They are legitimate (albeit inefficient) preventive agents for conventional 
AD. There is, however, a proverbial snowball's chance in hell of them being 
effective in symptomatic AD, lecanemab, donanemab, and any other "…mab" or 
"…stat" notwithstanding. They comprise Aβ-specific antibodies, inhibitors of 
beta- and gamma-secretase, and modulators of the latter. In the latter category, 
among ways to go are the following: (1) Depletion of iAβ, which, if sufficiently 
"deep", opens up a tantalizing possibility of once-in-a-lifetime preventive 
transient treatment for conventional AD and aging-associated cognitive decline, 
AACD. (2) Composite therapy comprising the degradation of C99/iAβ and concurrent 
inhibition of the neuronal ISR. A single transient treatment could be sufficient 
to arrest the progression of conventional AD and prevent its recurrence for 
life. Multiple recurrent treatments would achieve the same outcome in 
unconventional AD. Alternatively, the sustained reduction/removal of 
unconventional neuronal ISR-eliciting stressors through the elimination of their 
source would convert unconventional AD into conventional one, 
preventable/treatable by a single transient administration of the composite 
C99/iAβ depletion/ISR suppression therapy. Efficient and suitable ISR inhibitors 
are available, and it is explicitly clear where to look for C99/iAβ-specific 
targeted degradation agents-activators of BACE1 and, especially, BACE2. Directly 
acting C99/iAβ-specific degradation agents such as proteolysis-targeting 
chimeras (PROTACs) and molecular-glue degraders (MGDs) are also viable options. 
(3) A circumscribed shift (either upstream or downstream) of the position of 
transcription start site (TSS) of the human AβPP gene, or, alternatively, a gene 
editing-mediated excision or replacement of a small, defined segment of its 
portion encoding 5'-untranslated region of AβPP mRNA; targeting AβPP RNA with 
anti-antisense oligonucleotides is another possibility. If properly executed, 
these RNA-based strategies would not interfere with the protein-coding potential 
of AβPP mRNA, and each would be capable of both preventing and stopping the 
AβPP-independent generation of C99 and thus of either preventing AD or arresting 
the progression of the disease in its conventional and unconventional forms. The 
paper is interspersed with "validation" sections: every conceptually significant 
notion is either validated by the existing data or an experimental procedure 
validating it is proposed.

Researchers have long focused on the accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides 
in the brain as a primary pathological hallmark driving cognitive decline. This 
study investigated the neuroprotective effects of Rosa rugosa (RR) root extract 
and its key bioactive constituent, oleamide, against amyloid beta (Aβ)-induced 
neurotoxicity. Initially, an ethanolic extract of RR root was screened via in 
vitro assays to assess antioxidant and cytoprotective potential in rat 
pheochromocytoma cells. Subsequent fractionation, open-column chromatography, 
and preparatory thin-layer chromatography led to the isolation of oleamide, 
confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and 1H/13C nuclear magnetic 
resonance analyses. In vivo experiments using intracerebroventricularly injected 
Aβ in male mice demonstrated that both RR root extract and oleamide 
significantly improved cognitive performance in the Y-maze and passive avoidance 
tests. Additionally, oleamide restored acetylcholine levels and reduced 
malondialdehyde concentrations in brain tissue, indicating mitigation of 
oxidative stress and support of cholinergic function. No significant toxicity 
was observed, as evidenced by stable serum transaminase levels and unaltered 
body or brain weights. These findings highlight oleamide's potential to protect 
against Aβ-driven pathology through multiple mechanisms, including reduced lipid 
peroxidation and improved neurotransmission. Further investigations into 
oleamide's molecular targets and synergy with existing therapies may advance its 
development as a novel candidate for Alzheimer's disease prevention or adjunct 
treatment.

The development of more effective disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) is compromised by the lack of streamlined measures to detect and 
monitor the full spectrum of neurodegeneration, including white matter 
pathology, which begins early. This study utilized an established intracerebral 
streptozotocin (STZ) model of AD to examine the potential utility of a 
non-invasive serum extracellular vesicle (SEV)-based liquid biopsy approach for 
detecting a broad range of molecular pathologies related to neurodegeneration. 
The design enabled comparative analysis of immunoreactivity in frontal lobe 
tissue (FLTX), frontal lobe-derived EVs (FLEVs), and SEVs. Long Evans rats were 
administered i.c. STZ or saline (control) on postnatal day 3 (P3). Morris Water 
Maze testing was performed from P24 to P27. On P31-32, the rats were sacrificed 
to harvest FLTX and serum for EV characterization. STZ caused brain atrophy, 
with deficits in spatial learning and memory. STZ significantly impacted FLEV 
and SEV nanoparticle abundance and size distributions and concordantly increased 
AD (Tau, pTau, and Aβ) and oxidative stress (ubiquitin, 4-HNE) biomarkers, as 
well as immunoreactivity to immature oligodendrocyte (PLP), non-myelinating 
glial (PDGFRA, GALC) proteins, MAG, nestin, and GFAP in FLTX and FLEV. The SEVs 
also exhibited concordant STZ-related effects, but they were limited to 
increased levels of 4-HNE, PLP, PDGFRA, GALC, MAG, and GFAP. The findings 
suggest that non-invasive EV-based liquid biopsy approaches could potentially be 
used to detect and monitor some aspects of AD-type neurodegeneration. Targeting 
brain-specific EVs in serum will likely increase the sensitivity of this 
promising non-invasive approach for diagnostic and clinical management.

Soluble oligomeric forms of Amyloid-β (Aβ) are considered the major toxic 
species leading to the neurodegeneration underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Therefore, drugs that prevent oligomer formation might be promising. The 
atypical dipeptide GAL-201 is orally bioavailable and interferes as a modulator 
of Aβ aggregation. It binds to aggregation-prone, misfolded Aβ monomers with 
high selectivity and affinity, thereby preventing the formation of toxic 
oligomers. Here, we demonstrate that the previously observed protective effect 
of GAL-201 on synaptic plasticity occurs irrespective of shortages and 
post-translational modifications (tested isoforms: Aβ1-42, Aβ(p3-42), Aβ1-40 and 
3NTyr(10)-Aβ). Interestingly, the neuroprotective activity of a single dose of 
GAL-201 was still present after one week and correlated with a prevention of 
Aβ-induced spine loss. Furthermore, we could observe beneficial effects on spine 
morphology as well as the significantly reduced activation of proinflammatory 
microglia and astrocytes in the presence of an Aβ1-42-derived toxicity. In line 
with these in vitro data, GAL-201 additionally improved hippocampus-dependent 
spatial learning in the "tgArcSwe" AD mouse model after a single subcutaneous 
administration. By this means, we observed changes in the deposition pattern: 
through the clustering of misfolded monomers as off-pathway non-toxic Aβ 
agglomerates, toxic oligomers are removed. Our results are in line with 
previously collected preclinical data and warrant the initiation of 
Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling studies for GAL-201. By demonstrating 
the highly efficient detoxification of β-sheet monomers, leading to the 
neutralization of Aβ oligomer toxicity, GAL-201 represents a promising drug 
candidate against Aβ-derived pathophysiology present in AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common progressive neurodegenerative 
diseases leading to impairments in memory, orientation, and behavior. However, 
significant work is still needed to fully understand the progression of such 
disease and develop novel therapeutic agents for AD prevention and treatment. 
Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) have received attention in recent years due 
to their potential therapeutic effects on AD. The aim of this study was to 
determine the potential effect of sEVs in an in vitro model of AD. sEVs were 
isolated from human Wharton's jelly mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) by asymmetric 
depth filtration, a method developed recently by us. AD was modeled in vitro 
using cells obtained from the hippocampi of newborn 5xFAD transgenic mice 
carrying mutations involved in familial AD. After isolation, sEVs underwent 
detailed characterization that included scanning electron microscopy, 
nanoparticle tracking analysis, confocal microscopy, Western blotting, and 
Luminex assay. When added to 5xFAD hippocampal cells, sEVs were nontoxic, 
colocalized with neurons and astrocytes, decreased the level of Aβ peptide, and 
increased the synaptic density. These results support the possibility that sEVs 
can improve brain cell function during aging, decrease the risk of AD, and 
potentially be used for AD therapeutics.

Neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common 
form of dementia, represent a growing global health crisis, yet current 
treatment strategies remain primarily palliative. Recent studies have shown that 
neurodegeneration through complex interactions within the gut-brain axis largely 
depends on the gut microbiota and its metabolites. This review explores the 
intricate molecular mechanisms linking gut microbiota dysbiosis to cognitive 
decline, emphasizing the impact of microbial metabolites, including short-chain 
fatty acids (SCFAs), bile acids, and tryptophan metabolites, on 
neuroinflammation, blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity, and amyloid-β and tau 
pathology. The paper highlights major microbiome signatures associated with 
Alzheimer's disease, detailing their metabolic pathways and inflammatory 
crosstalk. Dietary interventions have shown promise in modulating gut microbiota 
composition, potentially mitigating neurodegenerative processes. This review 
critically examines the influence of dietary patterns, such as the Mediterranean 
and Western diets, on microbiota-mediated neuroprotection. Bioactive compounds 
like prebiotics, omega-3 fatty acids, and polyphenols exhibit neuroprotective 
effects by modulating gut microbiota and reducing neuroinflammation. 
Furthermore, it discusses emerging microbiome-based therapeutic strategies, 
including probiotics, prebiotics, postbiotics, and fecal microbiota 
transplantation (FMT), as potential interventions for slowing Alzheimer's 
progression. Despite these advances, several knowledge gaps remain, including 
interindividual variability in microbiome responses to dietary interventions and 
the need for large-scale, longitudinal studies. The study proposes an 
integrative, precision medicine approach, incorporating microbiome science into 
Alzheimer's treatment paradigms. Ultimately, cognizance of the gut-brain axis at 
a mechanistic level could unlock novel therapeutic avenues, offering a 
non-invasive, diet-based strategy for managing neurodegeneration and improving 
cognitive health.

BACKGROUND: The development of anti-amyloid-beta (Aβ) immunotherapies as the 
first disease modifying therapy for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a breakthrough 
of basic research and translational science.
MAIN TEXT: Genetically modified mouse models developed to study AD 
neuropathology and physiology were used for the discovery of Aβ immunotherapies 
and helped ultimately propel therapies to FDA approval. Nonetheless, the 
combination of modest efficacy and significant rates of an adverse side effect 
(amyloid related imaging abnormalities, ARIA), has prompted reverse 
translational research in these same mouse models to better understand the 
mechanism of the therapies.
CONCLUSION: This review considers the use of these mouse models in understanding 
the mechanisms of Aβ clearance, cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), blood brain 
barrier breakdown, neuroinflammation, and neuronal dysfunction in response to Aβ 
immunotherapy.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) affects ~1% of children and adults and is 
partly caused by genetic factors. We conducted a genome-wide association study 
(GWAS) meta-analysis combining 53,660 OCD cases and 2,044,417 controls and 
identified 30 independent genome-wide significant loci. Gene-based approaches 
identified 249 potential effector genes for OCD, with 25 of these classified as 
the most likely causal candidates, including WDR6, DALRD3 and CTNND1 and 
multiple genes in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region. We 
estimated that ~11,500 genetic variants explained 90% of OCD genetic 
heritability. OCD genetic risk was associated with excitatory neurons in the 
hippocampus and the cortex, along with D1 and D2 type dopamine 
receptor-containing medium spiny neurons. OCD genetic risk was shared with 65 of 
112 additional phenotypes, including all the psychiatric disorders we examined. 
In particular, OCD shared genetic risk with anxiety, depression, anorexia 
nervosa and Tourette syndrome and was negatively associated with inflammatory 
bowel diseases, educational attainment and body mass index.

Imaging genetics is one of the important keys to precision medicine that leads 
to personalized treatment based on a patient's genetics, phenotype, or 
psychosocial characteristics. It deepens the understanding of the mechanisms 
through which genetic variations contribute to neurological and psychiatric 
disorders. This systematic review overviews the methods and applications of 
imaging genetics in the context of neurological diseases, mentioning its 
potential role in personalized medicine. Following PRISMA guidelines, this 
review systematically analyzes 28 studies integrating genetic and neuroimaging 
data to explore disease mechanisms and their implications for precision 
medicine. Selected research included multiple neurological disorders, including 
frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer's disease, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, 
Parkinson's disease, and others. Voxel-based morphometry was the most common 
imaging technique, while frequently examined genetic variants included APOE, 
C9orf72, MAPT, GRN, COMT, and BDNF. Associations between these variants and 
regional gray matter loss (e.g., frontal, temporal, or subcortical regions) 
suggest that genetic risk factors play a key role in disease pathophysiology. 
Integrating genetic and neuroimaging analyses enhances our understanding of 
disease mechanisms and supports advancements in precision medicine.

Few studies have examined the effects of self-managed lifestyle behavioral 
adjustment on cognitive status. This study aimed to explore the association 
between self-managed behavioral changes and transitions in cognitive status. The 
Hubei Memory and Aging Cohort Study was a prospective cohort study conducted 
from 2018-2023 in rural and urban areas. Home-dwelling adults aged ≥65 years 
completed neuropsychological, lifestyle, clinical, and cognitive assessments. 
The Cox regressions and cubic splines were used to assess the risk of incident 
cognitive impairment, and latent class analysis was used to group participants 
based on behavioral patterns and assess transitions in cognitive status. Among 
2477 participants with a mean of 2.02 (SD, 1.25) years of follow-up were 
included in the study. Participants with low and intermediate compared with high 
baseline behavioral risk exhibited a reduced risk of incident cognitive 
impairment. At follow-up, those who maintained stable healthy behaviors or 
positively adjusted them had a 54% (HR, 0.46 [95% CI, 0.34-0.62]) and 84% (0.16 
[0.07-0.35]) lower risk of developing cognitive impairment, respectively, 
compared with those who maintained unhealthy behaviors. The standard and 
reinforced behavioral adjustment patterns exhibited a 37% (0.63 [0.22-1.79]) and 
77% (0.23 [0.05-0.97]) reduction in the risk of incident cognitive impairment, 
respectively, compared with the basic pattern. Optimal cognitive gains were 
attributed to positive adjustments in social networks, physical exercise, 
cognitive activity, and sleep health. Older adults who maintained healthy 
behaviors or positively adjusted their unhealthy behaviors exhibited a reduced 
risk of incident cognitive impairment. Positive behavior modification brought 
greater cognitive improvement to all participants and more pronounced effects 
for those with dementia.

BACKGROUND: Reducing time to intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) is crucial for 
effective ischemic stroke treatment. Through grassroots efforts, the FSR 
(Florida Stroke Registry) developed regional dashboards (RDs) displaying 
reperfusion metrics within local Stroke Coalitions to improve acute stroke care 
quality. We sought to evaluate whether RD use is associated with faster IVT 
times and improved hospitalization outcomes.
METHODS: We compared IVT-treated cases of ischemic stroke at FSR hospitals 
participating in the RD initiative versus nonparticipating hospitals from 
January 2016 to December 2023. Primary outcomes were door-to-treatment time 
<20 minutes and onset-to-treatment time <60 minutes. Secondary outcomes included 
intracerebral hemorrhage after IVT, discharge disposition, and in-hospital 
death. Logistic regression models, adjusted for calendar year, patient 
characteristics, and hospital factors, assessed the association between RD use 
and study outcomes.
RESULTS: By the end of the study period, 92 of 172 FSR hospitals (53.5%) were 
participating in stroke coalitions and using RDs. Among 32 320 IVT-treated cases 
(mean age, 69±15 years, 48.4% women), 10 666 (33.0%) were treated in 
RD-participating hospitals. RD participation was independently associated with 
door-to-treatment time <20 minutes (12.7% versus 7.3%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.48 
[95% CI, 1.35-1.63]) and onset-to-treatment time <60 minutes (13.9% versus 9.0%; 
adjusted odds ratio, 1.63 [95% CI, 1.49-1.80]), as well as increased likelihood 
of being discharged directly to home (adjusted odds ratio, 1.15 [95% CI, 
1.07-1.23]).
CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of the FSR RD initiative within stroke 
coalitions was associated with faster IVT times and higher likelihood of home 
discharge. This quality improvement initiative, adaptable to local needs, could 
emerge as a valuable tool for enhancing stroke systems of care.

Neurodegenerative diseases, characterized by progressive neuronal degeneration 
and associated with neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, present significant 
challenges in diagnosis and treatment. This review explores the potential of 
copper(II)-bis(thiosemicarbazone) complexes, particularly Cu-ATSM, as a 
dual-purpose radiopharmaceutical for imaging and therapeutic interventions. 
Cu-ATSM exhibits unique redox-dependent retention in pathological 
microenvironments, driven by mitochondrial dysfunction and hyper-reductive 
states, which enables the noninvasive detection of oxidative stress via positron 
emission tomography (PET). Preclinical studies demonstrate its efficacy in 
mitigating neuroinflammation by suppressing glial activation, reducing the 
secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α, MCP-1), and increasing the 
expression of neuroprotective metallothionein-1 (MT1). Some Clinical research 
reveals elevated ⁶⁴Cu-ATSM uptake in Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients, correlating with 
disease severity and regional oxidative stress markers. Furthermore, Cu-ATSM 
derivatives show promise in modulating blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, 
enhancing amyloid-β clearance, and restoring copper homeostasis in ALS models. 
Despite these advances, limitations such as small cohort sizes and heterogeneity 
in clinical studies underscore the need for larger-scale validation. Multimodal 
imaging integrating PET and MRI, alongside novel structural analogs targeting Aβ 
plaques and redox imbalances, emerges as a strategic direction for future 
research. Collectively, Cu-ATSM represents a transformative tool for elucidating 
neuropathological mechanisms and advancing therapeutic strategies in 
neurodegenerative disorders.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most debilitating form of dementia, 
characterized by amyloid-β (Aβ)-related toxic mechanisms such as oxidative 
stress, neuroinflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. The development of AD 
is influenced by environmental factors linked to lifestyle, including physical 
and mental inactivity, diet, and smoking, all of which have been associated with 
the severity of the disease and Aβ-related pathology. In this study, we used 
differentiated SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma and C6 glioma cells to investigate the 
neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of daidzein, a naturally occurring 
isoflavone, in the context of Aβ oligomer-related toxicity. We observed that 
pre-treatment with daidzein prevented Aβ-induced cell viability loss, increased 
oxidative stress, and mitochondrial membrane potential decline in both SH-SY5Y 
and C6 cells. Furthermore, daidzein application reduced elevated levels of MAPK 
pathway proteins, pro-inflammatory molecules (cyclooxygenase-2 and IL-1β), and 
pyroptosis markers, including caspase-1 and gasdermin D, all of which were 
increased by Aβ exposure. These findings strongly suggest that daidzein 
alleviates inflammation and toxicity caused by Aβ oligomers. Our results 
indicate that daidzein could be a potential therapeutic agent for AD and other 
Aβ-related neurodegenerative diseases.

BACKGROUND: Considering the prevalence of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) among the 
aging population and the limited means of treatment, early detection emerges as 
a crucial focus area whereas electroencephalography (EEG) provides a promising 
diagnostic tool. To date, several studies indicated EEG dataset-based models 
sporting high diagnostic power in distinguishing patients with AD from healthy 
controls (HC). However, exploration into which features play a crucial role in 
the diagnosis remains limited.
METHODS: This study investigates the diagnostic capabilities of EEG for 
distinguishing patients with AD from HCs through random forest classification on 
EEG features. Band power and cross-correlation from the resting state EEG 
dataset of 22 HCs and 160 patients with AD were calculated using Welch's 
periodogram and Pearson's correlation, respectively. Welch's t-test was applied 
to identify features demonstrating significant differences between patients with 
AD and HCs. Band power and cross-correlation were analyzed using a random forest 
classifier (RFC) and feature-importance analysis. The importance of feature 
categories, defined as subsets of features grouped by frequency bands (for band 
power features) or brain regions (for cross-correlation features), was 
quantified by calculating their average occurrence across all hyperparameter 
configurations.
RESULT: Distinct patterns between the eyes-closed and eyes-open conditions in 
alpha power were not observed for patients with AD (vs. HC), whereas theta power 
(4-8 Hz) in all regions was higher in patients with AD (vs. HC)(p<0.05). 
Interhemispheric cross-correlation in the temporal lobes exhibited the most 
distinguishable distribution for the cross-correlation dataset. An RFC, 
exploring 512 models with varied hyperparameters followed by feature-importance 
analysis based on the mean decrease in impurity, highlighted "theta relative 
power" and "interhemispheric cross-correlation of channel pairs including 
temporal channels" as the most important features for distinguishing patients 
with AD from HCs. RFC on theta-band filtered cross-correlation dataset informed 
by important features demonstrated the robustness of important features across 
models with different hyperparameter settings.
DISCUSSION: The models achieved over 97% accuracy and 100% recall in test sets, 
although the interpretation of this extraordinarily high accuracy warrants 
caution due to the small dataset size with high data imbalance and the absence 
of external validation. This methodology demonstrates the efficacy of EEG-based 
metrics and machine learning in improving our understanding of EEG 
characteristics in patients with AD, emphasizing the potential of integrating 
machine learning techniques into clinical practices.

As the percentage of geriatric patients continues to increase in both the United 
States and globally, the prevalence of both cardiovascular disease and dementia 
continues to climb. Both dementia and cardiovascular disease are devastating 
diseases that impose a significant burden economically, socially, and medically 
on both a local and systemic level. The most common fatal manifestation of 
cardiovascular disease is acute myocardial infarction, responsible for death in 
more than 80% of patients with cardiovascular disease. Prominent risk factors 
for acute myocardial infarction including hypertension and atherosclerosis have 
been independently associated with an increased risk for cognitive decline and 
all-cause dementia and Alzheimer disease, separate from vascular dementia. Acute 
myocardial infarction itself has also been independently associated with an 
increased incidence of all-cause dementia and Alzheimer disease. It is based on 
the connection between acute myocardial infarction, its major risk factors, and 
the incidence of dementia that it is of importance to define and explore the 
potential role that therapies for these conditions, as well as acute myocardial 
infarction itself, may play in mitigating the risk of dementia onset and 
severity. In this review, we assess current therapeutics that exist for 
atherosclerosis, hypertension and acute myocardial infarction that have been 
demonstrated to reduce later risk of dementia, and explore the mechanism that 
underlies the association between the incidence of acute myocardial infarction 
and the risk of dementia.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder that 
currently affects an estimated 6.9 million people in the United States. Despite 
the growing prevalence of AD, management of this common condition remains 
suboptimal. To address knowledge and practice gaps related to cognitive 
evaluation and Alzheimer's diagnosis and treatment, the American Association of 
Nurse Practitioners (NPs) developed a 1.5-contact hour NP-focused continuing 
education (CE) program on AD. Changes in learner knowledge, competence, and 
confidence were assessed with preactivity and postactivity surveys; qualitative 
follow-up interviews were conducted to evaluate retention of CE material and 
behavior changes. In total, 4,793 learners (NPs, 93.6%) who completed the 
activity and self-reported providing patient care were included in the outcomes 
analysis. In the pre-activity assessment, notable knowledge and competence 
deficiencies were identified related to the diagnosis, classification, and 
pharmacotherapeutic management of AD. The CE activity was associated with 
significant improvements in knowledge and competence, with a 20-percentage point 
increase in correct response rate from the pre-activity to post-activity survey 
( p < .001). Learner confidence in their ability to perform key clinical tasks 
related to Alzheimer's management also improved. Twelve NPs participated in 
follow-up interviews; most reported that the CE activity reinforced their 
current practices. Despite improvements in knowledge and competence, certain 
knowledge gaps persisted, and learners identified several ongoing barriers to 
optimal management, including lack of access to specialists. Given the changing 
Alzheimer's landscape, ongoing educational interventions targeted to the NP 
workforce are needed to serve the growing population of adults at risk for AD.
