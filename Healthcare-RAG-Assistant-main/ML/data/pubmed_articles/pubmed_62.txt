Physical exercise is known to slow synaptic neurodegeneration and cognitive 
aging in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The benefits of physical exercise are related 
to reduced amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition and increased synaptic plasticity. Yet 
little is known about the mechanisms that mediate these effects. Here, we show 
that physical exercise down-regulated the microglial Tmem9 protein, inhibited 
C1q activation, and decreased C1q-dependent microglial synapse engulfment, 
eventually ameliorating cognitive impairment in 5xFAD mice. Furthermore, using 
oAβ cultured-BV2 in vitro, we show that downregulation of microglial Tmem9 was 
sufficient to restrain complement activity and decrease microglia-mediated 
synaptic loss, whereas overexpression of microglial Tmem9 tended to promote 
complement activation and induced synaptic loss, abolishing exercise-associated 
protection. Finally, we show that microglial Tmem9 contributed to complement 
activation by regulating ATP6V0D1, a vesicular (H+) ATP-dependent proton pump 
(V-ATPase) subunit that regulates V-ATPase assembly. Together, our results 
demonstrate that exercise is a potential treatment for AD patients. In an AD 
mouse model, it decreased the levels of microglial Tmem9 to inhibit the 
activation of complement, alleviated complement-dependent synaptic loss, and 
eventually ameliorated emotional and cognitive disorders.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is among the most devastating neurodegenerative 
disorders with limited treatment options. Emerging evidence points to the 
involvement of lipid dysregulation in the development of AD. Nevertheless, the 
precise lipidomic landscape and the mechanistic roles of lipids in disease 
pathology remain poorly understood. This review aims to highlight the 
significance of lipidomics and lipid-targeting approaches in the diagnosis and 
treatment of AD. We summarized the connection between lipid dysregulation in the 
human brain and AD at both genetic and lipid species levels. We briefly 
introduced lipidomics technologies and discussed potential challenges and areas 
of future advancements in the lipidomics field for AD research. To elucidate the 
central role of lipids in converging multiple pathological aspects of AD, we 
reviewed the current knowledge on the interplay between lipids and major AD 
features, including amyloid beta, tau, and neuroinflammation. Finally, we 
assessed the progresses and obstacles in lipid-based therapeutics and proposed 
potential strategies for leveraging lipidomics in the treatment of AD.

Cognitive resilience (CR) describes the phenomenon of individuals evading 
cognitive decline despite prominent Alzheimer's disease neuropathology. 
Operationalization and measurement of this latent construct is non-trivial as it 
cannot be directly observed. The residual approach has been widely applied to 
estimate CR, where the degree of resilience is estimated through a linear 
model's residuals. We demonstrate that this approach makes specific, 
uncontrollable assumptions and likely leads to biased and erroneous resilience 
estimates. This is especially true when information about CR is contained in the 
data the linear model was fitted to, either through inclusion of CR-associated 
variables or due to correlation. We propose an alternative strategy which 
overcomes the standard approach's limitations using machine learning principles. 
Our proposed approach makes fewer assumptions about the data and CR and achieves 
better estimation accuracy on simulated ground-truth data.

BACKGROUND: Multiple Sulfatase Deficiency (MSD) is a rare inherited lysosomal 
storage disorder characterized by loss of function mutations in the SUMF1 gene 
that manifests as a severe pediatric neurological disease. There are no 
available targeted therapies for MSD.
METHODS: We engineered a viral vector (AAV9/SUMF1) to deliver working copies of 
the SUMF1 gene and tested the vector in Sumf1 knock out mice that generally 
display a median lifespan of 10 days. Mice were injected as pre-symptomatic 
neonates via intracerebroventricular administration, or as post-symptomatic 
juveniles via intrathecal alone or combination intrathecal and intravenous 
delivery. Cohorts were assessed for survival, behavioral outcomes, and 
post-mortem for sulfatase activity.
RESULTS: We show that treatment of neonates extends survival up to 1-year 
post-injection. Importantly, delivery of SUMF1 through cerebral spinal fluid at 
7 days of age alleviates MSD symptoms. The treated mice show wide distribution 
of the SUMF1 gene, no signs of toxicity or neuropathy, improved vision and 
cardiac function, and no behavioral deficits. One-year post treatment, tissues 
show increased sulfatase activity, indicating functional SUMF1. Further, a GLP 
toxicology study conducted in rats demonstrates favorable overall safety of this 
approach.
CONCLUSIONS: These preclinical studies highlight the potential of our AAV9/SUMF1 
vector, the design of which is directly translatable for clinical use, as a gene 
replacement therapy for MSD patients.

Plain Language Summary: Multiple Sulfatase Deficiency (MSD) is a rare genetic 
disorder caused by mutations in the SUMF1 gene, leading to severe problems with 
the brain and other organs in children. Currently, there is no available 
treatment. Here we tested an approach called gene therapy in which the deficient 
Sumf1 gene is replaced with the normal gene in a mouse model of MSD. Mice 
treated shortly after birth showed no major problems in brain and other organs 
and lived up to a year, while those treated after symptoms appeared also lived 
longer, with over half surviving beyond 15 months. This study suggests that this 
gene therapy approach could be a promising and safe treatment for MSD.

Aging is a major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). With the prevalence 
of AD increased, a mechanistic linkage between aging and the pathogenesis of AD 
needs to be further addressed. Here, we report that a small ubiquitin-related 
modifier (SUMO) modification of p53 is implicated in the process which 
remarkably increased in AD patient's brain. Mechanistically, SUMOylation of p53 
at K386 residue causes the dissociation of SET/p53 complex, thus releasing SET 
into the cytoplasm, SET further interacts with cytoplasmic PP2A and inhibits its 
activity, resulting in tau hyperphosphorylation in neurons. In addition, 
SUMOylation of p53 promotes the p53 Ser15 phosphorylation that mediates neuronal 
senescence. Notably, p53 SUMOylation contributes to synaptic damage and 
cognitive defects in AD model mice. We also demonstrate that the SUMOylation 
inhibiter, Ginkgolic acid, recovering several senescent phenotypes drove by p53 
SUMOylation in primary neurons. These findings suggest a previously undiscovered 
etiopathogenic relationship between aging and AD that is linked to p53 
SUMOylation and the potential of SUMOylated p53-based therapeutics for 
neurodegeneration such as Alzheimer's disease.

Alternative splicing impacts most multi-exonic human genes. Inaccuracies during 
this process may have an important role in ageing and disease. Here, we 
investigate splicing accuracy using RNA-sequencing data from >14k control 
samples and 40 human body sites, focusing on split reads partially mapping to 
known transcripts in annotation. We show that splicing inaccuracies occur at 
different rates across introns and tissues and are affected by the abundance of 
core components of the spliceosome assembly and its regulators. We find that age 
is positively correlated with a global decline in splicing fidelity, mostly 
affecting genes implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. We find support for 
the latter by observing a genome-wide increase in splicing inaccuracies in 
samples affected with Alzheimer's disease as compared to neurologically normal 
individuals. In this work, we provide an in-depth characterisation of splicing 
accuracy, with implications for our understanding of the role of inaccuracies in 
ageing and neurodegenerative disorders.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of dementia, 
characterized by progressive neurodegeneration and cognitive dysfunction. The 
disease aetiology is closely associated with proteinopathies, mitochondrial 
abnormalities, and elevated ROS generation, which are some of the primary 
markers for AD brains.
OBJECTIVES: The current research was intended to elucidate the chemical 
interaction of β-pinene against potential targets and evaluate its 
neuroprotective potential in ICV-STZ-induced sAD.
METHODOLOGY: The potential binding interactions of β-pinene and galantamine were 
evaluated against the active sites of PP2A, SOD1, catalase-3, and AChE using 
AutoDock vina. Additionally, the β-pinene and galantamine were subjected to 
tests of their ADMET by employing the Swiss ADME and Protox-II web servers. To 
assess the neuroprotective potential, β-pinene (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg) and 
galantamine (2 mg/kg) was administered p.o in ICV-STZ-treated wistar rats for 21 
days. Moreover, behavioral parameters (NOR & MWM), biochemical, AChE activities, 
and mitochondrial complexes were performed.
RESULTS: Molecular docking study showed that β-pinene can interact with human 
PP2A, SOD1, Catalase-3, and AChE with better ligand efficiency as compared to 
galantamine. In-vivo data showed that β-pinene treatment (100, and 200 mg/kg) 
for 21 days exhibited significantly enhanced cognitive performance, as shown in 
behavioral studies. Additionally, β-pinene treatment significantly 
re-established antioxidant levels and mitochondrial capacities and attenuated 
altered AChE activity as compared to ICV-STZ-induced groups.
CONCLUSIONS: In-silico studies revealed that β-pinene shared the same binding 
pocket as galantamine, supporting its neuroprotective effects in the 
ICV-STZ-induced animal model by alleviating oxidative stress and mitochondrial 
dysfunction and reducing AChE activity.

BACKGROUND: Research has shown that engaging in a range of healthy lifestyles or 
behavioral factors can help reduce the risk of developing dementia. Improved 
knowledge of modifiable risk factors for dementia may help engage people to 
reduce their risk, with beneficial impacts on individual and public health. 
Moreover, many guidelines emphasize the importance of providing education and 
web-based resources for dementia prevention. Internet-based interventions may be 
effective, but few have been studied rigorously or widely disseminated. We 
created DementiaRisk, an award-winning, web- and email-based education platform 
for the public focused on modifiable risk factors, featuring multimedia 
e-learning and email "microlearning" content, to help raise awareness and 
improve knowledge of actions to reduce dementia risk.
OBJECTIVE: This protocol describes a randomized controlled trial to (1) evaluate 
whether exposure to DementiaRisk changes knowledge of dementia risk factors, 
intention to engage in risk reduction activities, and health behaviors related 
to dementia risk reduction and to (2) explore qualitative aspects including 
participants' engagement and satisfaction with the intervention and barriers and 
facilitators to use.
METHODS: Using a sequential explanatory mixed methods design, this study 
conducts a quantitative analysis followed by a qualitative inquiry to evaluate 
outcomes and feasibility. In total, 485 participants will be recruited on the 
web and randomly assigned to 2 groups: one accessing DementiaRisk and the other 
receiving alternative e-learning on mild cognitive impairment. Assessments will 
be delivered on the web at baseline (T1), at 4 weeks (T2), and at 2 months after 
the intervention (T3). Knowledge will be assessed using items from the Dementia 
Knowledge Assessment Scale, intentions to engage in risk reduction activities 
will be assessed using items in line with current evidence, and health behaviors 
related to dementia risk reduction will be assessed using items from the 
Godin-Shephard Leisure Time Physical Activity Questionnaire along with 
additional questions related to a range of health status domains. Outcomes and 
feasibility will be assessed using the Information Assessment Method for 
patients and consumers. A linear mixed effects model will be used to examine the 
relationship between each outcome score by group and time point.
RESULTS: This study was approved by the Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics 
Board on August 24, 2022 (project ID 14886) and received funding in February 
2023. Recruitment took place from March 28, 2023, to April 28, 2023, with the 
final participants completing the intervention by August 18, 2023. Analyses and 
interpretation of data are ongoing.
CONCLUSIONS: DementiaRisk is a readily scalable, technology-enhanced solution 
for dementia prevention education. It has been designed using evidence-based 
principles of multimedia learning. It has the potential to scale and spread 
widely using the open internet, so it may be able to reach a wider audience than

With the increasing number of patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD), the demand 
for early diagnosis and intervention is becoming increasingly urgent. The 
traditional detection methods for Alzheimer's disease mainly rely on clinical 
symptoms, biomarkers, and imaging examinations. However, these methods have 
limitations in the early detection of Alzheimer's disease, such as strong 
subjectivity in diagnostic criteria, high detection costs, and high misdiagnosis 
rates. To address these issues, this study proposes a deep learning model to 
detect Alzheimer's disease; it is called Enhanced Residual Attention Network 
(ERAN) that can classify medical images. By combining residual learning, 
attention mechanism, and soft thresholding, the feature representation ability 
and classification accuracy of the model have been improved. The accuracy of the 
model in detecting Alzheimer's disease has reached 99.36%, with a loss rate of 
only 0.0264. The experimental results indicate that the Enhanced Residual 
Attention Network has achieved excellent performance on the Alzheimer's disease 
test dataset, providing strong support for the early diagnosis and treatment of 
Alzheimer's disease.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by cognitive decline. Despite extensive research, therapeutic 
options remain limited. Varenicline, an α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor 
agonist, shows promise in enhancing cognitive function. This study aimed to 
evaluate varenicline's effect on memory and hippocampal activity in rat model of 
AD. Forty-eight adult male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to control, sham, 
AD, and varenicline (0.1, 1, and 3 mg/kg/po for 14 days) groups. AD was induced 
by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of 4 µl amyloid-beta (Aβ)1-42 
(1 µg/µl). Spatial learning and memory, hippocampal synaptic function, and CA1 
electrophysiological activity were evaluated using appropriate methods. Barnes 
maze and T-maze behavioral tests revealed that varenicline, particularly at 
1 mg/kg, significantly improved spatial memory compared to the AD group. Western 
blot analysis showed varenicline's ability to upregulate synaptic proteins 
PSD-95, synaptophysin, and GAP-43 in the hippocampus, with the most significant 
effects observed at 1 mg/kg. Electrophysiological recordings demonstrated that 
varenicline at 1 mg/kg enhanced hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), 
indicating improved synaptic plasticity. Single-unit recordings showed an 
increase in spike count with varenicline administration. These findings suggest 
that varenicline, particularly at 1 mg/kg, ameliorates memory deficits in AD 
rats possibly through modulation of synaptic proteins and enhancement of 
hippocampal LTP and electrical activity. Further investigations are warranted to 
elucidate varenicline's precise mechanisms of action in alleviating AD-induced 
cognitive deficits and its potential as a therapeutic intervention for 
AD-related cognitive impairment.

This proceedings article summarizes the inaugural "T Cells in the Brain" 
symposium held at Columbia University. Experts gathered to explore the role of 
T cells in neurodegenerative diseases. Key topics included characterization of 
antigen-specific immune responses, T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire, microbial 
etiology in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and microglia-T cell crosstalk, with a 
focus on how T cells affect neuroinflammation and AD biomarkers like amyloid 
beta and tau. The symposium also examined immunotherapies for AD, including the 
Valacyclovir Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease (VALAD) trial, and two clinical 
trials leveraging regulatory T cell approaches for multiple sclerosis and 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis therapy. Additionally, single-cell RNA/TCR 
sequencing of T cells and other immune cells provided insights into immune 
dynamics in neurodegenerative diseases. This article highlights key findings 
from the symposium and outlines future research directions to further understand 
the role of T cells in neurodegeneration, offering innovative therapeutic 
approaches for AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. HIGHLIGHTS: Researchers 
gathered to discuss approaches to study T cells in brain disorders. New 
technologies allow high-throughput screening of antigen-specific T cells. 
Microbial infections can precede several serious and chronic neurological 
diseases. Central and peripheral T cell responses shape neurological disease 
pathology. Immunotherapy can induce regulatory T cell responses in 
neuroinflammatory disorders.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative disease characterized by progressive 
cognitive dysfunction. The strong link between nutrition and the occurrence and 
progression of AD pathology has been well documented. Poor nutritional status 
accelerates AD progress by potentially aggravating amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau 
deposition, exacerbating oxidative stress response, modulating the 
microbiota-gut-brain axis, and disrupting blood-brain barrier function. The 
advanced stage of AD tends to lead to malnutrition due to cognitive impairments, 
sensory dysfunctions, brain atrophy, and behavioral and psychological symptoms 
of dementia (BPSD). This, in turn, produces a vicious cycle between malnutrition 
and AD. This review discusses how nutritional factors and AD deteriorate each 
other from the early stage of AD to the terminal stages of AD, focusing on the 
potential of different levels of nutritional factors, ranging from 
micronutrients to diet patterns. This review provides novel insights into 
reducing the risk of AD, delaying its progression, and improving prognosis. 
HIGHLIGHTS: Two-fifths of Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases worldwide have been 
attributed to potentially modifiable risk factors. Up to ≈26% of 
community-dwelling patients with AD are malnourished, compared to 7%∼76% of 
institutionalized patients. Undernutrition effects the onset, progression, and 
prognosis of AD through multiple mechanisms. Various levels of nutritional 
supports were confirmed to be protective factors for AD via specific mechanisms.

Helicobacter pylori Eradication Treatments and Risk of Alzheimer Disease: A 
Case-Control Study Nested in the Finnish Population.

BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori ( H. pylori ) has been inconsistently associated 
with the risk of Alzheimer disease. The exposure assessment period has often 
overlapped with the prodromal time of Alzheimer disease. Cognitive disorders 
might increase vulnerability to infectious pathogens, complicating the 
ascertainment of the temporal relationship between H. pylori infection and 
Alzheimer disease.
METHODS: This Finnish nested case-control study included 70,520 persons with 
incident Alzheimer disease diagnosed between 2005 and 2011 and 281,233 age-, 
sex-, and region of residence-matched controls. We obtained information on 
comorbidities and drug use from the national healthcare registers. We identified 
dispensed H. pylori eradication treatments from the Prescription Register. We 
considered exposure at least 5 years before Alzheimer disease diagnosis in the 
main analysis. We compared the risk of Alzheimer disease between H. pylori 
eradication treatment users and nonusers using confounder-adjusted 
(comorbidities and other drug use) conditional logistic regression. We assessed 
cumulative exposure by calculating the number of eradication treatments.
RESULTS: The prevalence of exposure to H. pylori eradication treatment at least 
5 years before the outcome was 4.1% in cases and 3.9% in controls. The odds 
ratio (95% confidence interval) was 1.06 (1.02, 1.11) in the crude and 1.03 
(0.99, 1.07) in the confounder-adjusted model. We observed no association 
between cumulative exposure and risk of Alzheimer disease.
CONCLUSION: Our results, reflecting diagnosed and treated H. pylori infection 
late in life, do not support the hypothesis of H. pylori as an independent risk 
factor for Alzheimer disease. The previously reported association may be 
explained by reverse association and confounding.

Recent regulatory approvals of three amyloid-lowering monoclonal antibody 
therapies for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have triggered a 
polarizing debate in the field on the clinical meaningfulness of their reported 
effects. The question of how to define clinical meaningfulness for any treatment 
that has a modest effect size is important and will likely be subject to 
influence from interested stakeholders. We warn of claims of evaluating 
meaningful within-individual change from randomized parallel-group trials of AD 
treatments, sometimes purportedly assessed by a commonly recognized "responder" 
analysis approach, and explain why it is likely to mislead and should simply be 
avoided. The average between-group difference in score change is where the 
debate and research efforts should be focused to contextualize and evaluate the 
clinical meaningfulness of the true treatment effect. The statistical and 
communication principles we consider and would recommend are applicable to the 
evaluation of most interventions in medicine. HIGHLIGHTS: Dichotomized outcome 
analysis approaches purporting to evaluate within-individual meaningful change 
are highly likely to mislead. In our view, the most valid statistical approach 
to understanding the true treatment effect is to analyze the average 
between-group difference in outcome scores. The average between-group difference 
in score change is where the debate and research efforts should be focused to 
contextualize and evaluate the clinical meaningfulness of the true treatment 
effect.

INTRODUCTION: The generalizability of neuroimaging and cognitive biomarkers in 
their sensitivity to detect preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) and power to 
predict progression in large, multisite cohorts remains unclear.
METHOD: Longitudinal demographics, T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 
and cognitive scores of 3036 cognitively unimpaired (CU) older adults (amyloid 
beta [Aβ]-negative/positive [A-/A+]: 1270/1558) were included. Cross-sectional 
and longitudinal cognition and medial temporal lobe (MTL) structural measures 
were extracted. Cross-sectional MTL tau burden (T) was computed from tau 
positron emission tomography (N = 1095).
RESULTS: We found cross-sectional tau and longitudinal structural biomarkers 
best separated A+ CU from A- CU. A-T+ CU had significantly faster 
neurodegeneration rate compared to A-T- CU. MTL tau was significantly correlated 
with MRI and cognitive biomarkers regardless of Aβ status. MTL tau, MRI, and 
cognition provided complementary information about disease progression.
DISCUSSION: This large multisite study replicates prior findings in CU older 
adults, supporting the utility of neuroimaging and cognitive biomarkers in 
preclinical AD clinical trials and normal aging studies.
HIGHLIGHTS: We investigated neuroimaging and cognitive biomarkers in 3036 
cognitively unimpaired (CU) participants. Medial temporal lobe (MTL) tau and 
longitudinal MTL atrophy best separate amyloid beta positive (A+) CU from 
amyloid beta negative (A-) CU. A- tau positive (T+) CU had a significantly 
faster neurodegeneration rate compared to A-T- CU. MTL tau correlated with 
structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cognition regardless of amyloid 
beta status. Combined baseline MTL tau, MRI, and cognition best predict 
Alzheimer's disease progression.

Previously, our metabolomic, transcriptomic, and genomic studies characterized 
the ceramide/sphingomyelin pathway as a therapeutic target in Alzheimer's 
disease, and we demonstrated that FTY720, a sphingosine-1-phospahate receptor 
modulator approved for treatment of multiple sclerosis, recovers synaptic 
plasticity and memory in APP/PS1 mice. To further investigate how FTY720 rescues 
the pathology, we performed metabolomic analysis in brain, plasma, and liver of 
trained APP/PS1 and wild-type mice. APP/PS1 mice showed area-specific brain 
disturbances in polyamines, phospholipids, and sphingolipids. Most changes were 
completely or partially normalized in FTY720-treated subjects, indicating 
rebalancing the "sphingolipid rheostat", reactivating phosphatidylethanolamine 
synthesis via mitochondrial phosphatidylserine decarboxylase pathway, and 
normalizing polyamine levels that support mitochondrial activity. Synaptic 
plasticity and memory were rescued, with spermidine synthesis in temporal cortex 
best corresponding to hippocampal CA3-CA1 plasticity normalization. FTY720 
effects, also reflected in other pathways, are consistent with promotion of 
mitochondrial function, synaptic plasticity, and anti-inflammatory environment, 
while reducing pro-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory signals.

Glycation-induced oxidative stress underlies the numerous metabolic ravages of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Reduced glutathione levels in AD lead to increased 
oxidative stress, including glycation-induced pathology. Previously, we showed 
that the accumulation of reactive 1,2-dicarbonyls such as methylglyoxal, the 
major precursor of non-enzymatic glycation products, was reduced by the 
increased function of GSH-dependent glyoxalase-1 enzyme in the brain. In this 
two-pronged study, we evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of an orally 
bioavailable prodrug of our lead glyoxalase substrate, pro-ψ-GSH, for the first 
time in a transgenic Alzheimer's disease mouse model. This prodrug delivers 
pharmacodynamically relevant brain concentrations of ψ-GSH upon oral delivery. 
Chronic oral dosing of pro-ψ-GSH effectively reverses the cognitive decline 
observed in the APP/PS1 mouse model. The prodrug successfully mirrors the robust 
effects of the parent drug i.e., reducing amyloid pathology, glycation stress, 
neuroinflammation, and the resultant neurodegeneration in these mice. We also 
report the first metabolomics study of such a treatment, which yields key 
biomarkers linked to the reversal of AD-related metabolic dysregulation. 
Collectively, this study establishes pro-ψ-GSH as a viable, disease-modifying 
therapy for AD and paves the way for further preclinical advancement of such 
therapeutics. Metabolomic signatures identified could prove beneficial in the 
development of treatment-specific clinically translatable biomarkers.

The blood-brain-barrier prevents many imaging agents and therapeutics from being 
delivered to the brain that could fight central nervous system diseases such as 
Alzheimer's disease and strokes. However, techniques such as the use of stapled 
peptides or peptide shuttles may allow payloads through, with bioconjugation 
achieved via bio-orthogonal tetrazine/norbornene click chemistry. A series of 
lanthanide-tetrazine probes have been synthesised herein which could be utilised 
in bio-orthogonal click chemistry with peptide-based delivery systems to deliver 
MRI agents through the blood-brain-barrier. The Gd complexes show higher 
relaxivities than the clinical standard of Gd(DOTA) at 1.4 T and phosphorescence 
is observed from the Eu and Tb complexes via tetrazine sensitization, with 
supporting in vitro cytotoxicity and cell imaging. A bio-orthogonal click 
reaction between a Gd-tetrazine complex and a cyclic-RGD-norbornene conjugate 
was successful and the resulting clicked probe demonstrated enhanced relaxivity 
and could potentially act as a peptide shuttle for the Gd MRI agent.

In this work, we developed potential multifunctional agents to combat 
Alzheimer's disease. According to our strategy, fragments of tacrine and 
donepezil were merged in a unique hybrid structure. After successfully 
synthesizing the compounds, they were evaluated for their dual AChE/BuChE 
inhibitor potential and neuroprotector response using a glutamate-induced 
excitotoxicity model. Most of the compounds showed promising activity. Among 
them, the hybrid with 2,5-dimetoxysubstitution (3b) was the most potent 
analogue, triggering dual potent AChE/BuChE inhibition with low nanomolar 
affinity (IC50 ∼ 300 nM) and low toxicity to human liver cancer cells (HepG2). 
This analogue prevented the glutamate excitotoxic stimulus during pre/post 
treatment testing, maintained ATP levels, possessed an astrocytic protective 
response, and abolished the glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. Besides, the hit 
compound 3b exhibited suitable permeability in the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and 
low degradability in human blood-plasma. In addition, the docking studies 
suggested that the neuroprotectant response exhibited by 3b can be related to 
the direct blockage of the NMDA channel pore. Finally, an ideal 
neuropharmacokinetic profile was estimated for 3b. Overall, the designed 
conjugates provide a novel multifunctional molecular scaffold that can be used 
as a prototype drug in further investigations toward novel multipotent 
therapeutics for treating AD.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is one of the leading neurodegenerative diseases that 
affect the human population. Several hypotheses are in the pipeline to establish 
the commencement of this disease; however, the amyloid hypothesis is one of the 
most widely accepted ones. Amyloid plaques are rich in Amyloid Beta (Aβ) 
proteins, which are found in the brains of Alzheimer's patients. They are the 
spliced product of a transmembrane protein called Amyloid Precursor Protein 
(APP); when they enter into the amylogenic pathway, they get cleaved 
simultaneously by Beta and Gamma Secretase and produce Aβ protein. Appearances 
of Amyloid plaques are the significant clinical hallmarks of this disease. AD is 
mainly present in two genetically distinct forms; sporadic and familial AD. 
Sporadic Alzheimer's Disease (sAD) is marked by a later clinical onset of the 
disease, whereas, familial Alzheimer's Disease (fAD) is an early onset of the 
disease with mendelian inheritance. Several mutations have been clinically 
reported in the last decades that have shown a direct link with fAD. Many of 
those mutations are reported to be present in the APP. In this study, we 
selected a few significant mutations present in the Aβ stretch of the APP and 
tried to differentiate the wild-type Aβ dimers formed in sAD and the mutant 
dimers formed in fAD through molecular modelling as there are no structures 
available from wet-lab studies till date. We analysed the binding interactions 
leading to formations of the dimers. Our next aim was to come up with a solution 
to treat AD using the method of drug repurposing. For that we used virtual 
screening and molecular docking simulations of the already existing 
anti-inflammatory drugs and studied their potency in resisting the formation of 
Aβ dimers. This is the first such report of drug repurposing for the treatment 
of AD, which might pave new pathways in therapy.

Tau exhibits change in both spatial extent and density of pathology along the 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) spectrum with each aspect contributing to the overall 
burden of pathological tau. Nevertheless, studies using Tau PET have measured 
either magnitude using standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) or extent using 
number of Tau+ regions. We hypothesized that combining these two dimensions into 
a single measure of Magnitude and eXtent, Tau-MaX, would provide improved 
quantification of global tau burden as well as allowing for a region-agnostic 
measure of global tau burden that does not require a pre-specified region of 
interest (ROI) or meta-ROI. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed 
18F-flortaucipir PET scans from local and national consortium data (n=1077 
participants total) and used Gaussian-mixture models for data from 64 brain 
regions, to define both tau positivity and magnitude. We examined 
cross-sectional and longitudinal change in Tau-MaX across the Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) spectrum and compared the association of Tau-MaX, magnitude, and 
extent with plasma p-tau217 and global cognition. We also compared Tau-MaX using 
a global, region-agnostic approach to temporal lobe or Braak stage meta-ROIs. 
Whereas separate assessments of extent and magnitude across the disease spectrum 
found earlier increases in Tau spatial extent and later increases in magnitude, 
Tau-MaX was able to dynamically capture this shift demonstrating a stronger 
association with extent in the preclinical stage and a stronger association with 
magnitude in clinical stages. Global Tau-MaX differed between disease stages 
cross-sectionally and changed over time in all stages of disease. Further, 
Tau-MaX significantly improved associations with plasma p-tau217 and global 
cognition compared to magnitude or extent alone. Finally, global measures of 
Tau-MaX performed similarly to meta-ROI measures of Tau-MaX. Together, these 
findings indicate that combining magnitude and extent provides a robust measure 
of global tau burden that changes throughout the disease course and is 
associated with blood-based biomarkers and cognition. This measure may be of 
particular use for disease staging, as well as serving as an outcome measure to 
monitor response to therapeutic intervention.

Parkinson Disease Neuropathological Comorbidities: Prevalences from Younger-Old 
to Older-Old, With Comparison to Non-Demented, Non-Parkinsonian Subjects.

Co-existing neuropathological comorbidities have been repeatedly reported to be 
extremely common in subjects dying with dementia due to Alzheimer disease. As 
these are likely to be additive to cognitive impairment, and may not be affected 
by molecularly-specific AD therapeutics, they may cause significant 
inter-individual response heterogeneity amongst subjects in AD clinical trials. 
Furthermore, while originally noted for the oldest old, recent reports have now 
documented high neuropathological comorbidity prevalences in younger old AD 
subjects, who are more likely to be included in clinical trials. Comorbid 
neuropathologies in subjects with Parkinson disease have received much less 
attention. As with AD, comorbidities may interfere with the evaluation of PD 
clinical trials. We have here examined the decadal-wise presence of multiple 
co-pathologies, and their clinical effects, in a series of autopsies of PD and 
control subjects from the Arizona Study of Aging and Neurodegenerative 
Disorders. Amyloid plaques were present in more than 40% of PD patients in their 
60s, and in 85% of those in their 90s. Neurofibrillary tangles were present in 
PD, as in all elderly humans, from the 60s onwards, while Braak tangle stages of 
IV or greater, which are strongly associated with severe cognitive impairment, 
reached 40%, 50% and 60% in those subjects in their 70s, 80s and 90s, 
respectively. Both plaques and tangles were significant predictors of a lower 
MMSE score while greater CAA scores had borderline significance. None of these, 
however, were independently associated with a higher UPDRS score. The ApoE4 
allele, while a known predictor of AD pathology, especially amyloid plaques, was 
not an independent predictor of function with either of these clinical measures, 
suggesting that its influence is largely mediated by the neuropathologies that 
it predisposes to. Non-AD tauopathies, including the major conditions of 
progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and corticobasal degeneration (CBD), as 
well as the microscopic changes of argyrophilic grains (ARG) and aging-related 
tau astrogliopathy (ARTAG), also co-existed with PD, especially ARG and ARTAG, 
which ranged between 20% and 40% across decades for the former and up to 80% for 
the latter; we did not find significant associations of either with final MMSE 
or UPDRS scores. We failed to find a significant association of limbic TDP-43 
histopathology with either final MMSE score or final UPDRS motor score but our 
subjects were more heavily weighted with PD than those in prior studies and our 
cognitive correlate, limited to MMSE score, may have missed associations with 
cognitive domain subsets. We found several cerebrovascular pathologies to be 
predictors of both cognitive and motor impairment, including brain infarcts, 
circle of Willis atherosclerosis, and higher white matter rarefaction score. All 
of the investigated pathology types were common in the non-demented, 
non-parkinsonian control subjects, and all increased with age in parallel with 
those co-existing with PD, while with generally lower prevalences. The high 
concurrence rate of the neurodegenerative protein aggregate diseases is 
suggestive of either a synergistic co-pathogenesis, where one aggregate type may 
instigate or accelerate another type, or of one or more underlying predisposing 
physiological or molecular mechanisms.

Prediction-powered Inference for Clinical Trials: application to linear 
covariate adjustment.

Prediction-powered inference (PPI) and its subsequent development called PPI++ 
provide a novel approach to standard statistical estimation leveraging machine 
learning systems to enhance unlabeled data with predictions. We use this 
paradigm in clinical trials. The predictions are provided by disease progression 
models, providing prognostic scores for all the participants as a function of 
baseline covariates. The proposed method would empower clinical trials by 
providing untreated digital twins of the treated patients while remaining 
statistically valid. The potential implications of this new estimator of the 
treatment effect in a two-arm randomized clinical trial (RCT) are manifold. 
First, it leads to an overall reduction of the sample size required to reach the 
same power as a standard RCT. Secondly, it advocates for an imbalance of 
controls and treated patients, requiring fewer controls to achieve the same 
power. Finally, this technique directly transfers any disease prediction model 
trained on large cohorts to practical and scientifically valid use. In this 
paper, we demonstrate the theoretical properties of this estimator and 
illustrate them through simulations. We show that it is asymptotically unbiased 
for the Average Treatment Effect and derive an explicit formula for its 
variance. An application to an Alzheimer's disease clinical trial showcases the 
potential to reduce the sample size.

Elucidating the genetic contributions to Parkinson's disease (PD) etiology 
across diverse ancestries is a critical priority for the development of targeted 
therapies in a global context. We conducted the largest sequencing 
characterization of potentially disease-causing, protein-altering and splicing 
mutations in 710 cases and 11,827 controls from genetically predicted African or 
African admixed ancestries. We explored copy number variants (CNVs) and runs of 
homozygosity (ROHs) in prioritized early onset and familial cases. Our study 
identified rare GBA1 coding variants to be the most frequent mutations among PD 
patients, with a frequency of 4% in our case cohort. Out of the 18 GBA1 variants 
identified, ten were previously classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic, 
four were novel, and four were reported as of uncertain clinical significance. 
The most common known disease-associated GBA1 variants in the Ashkenazi Jewish 
and European populations, p.Asn409Ser, p.Leu483Pro, p.Thr408Met, and 
p.Glu365Lys, were not identified among the screened PD cases of African and 
African admixed ancestry. Similarly, the European and Asian LRRK2 
disease-causing mutational spectrum, including LRRK2 p.Gly2019Ser and 
p.Gly2385Arg genetic risk factors, did not appear to play a major role in PD 
etiology among West African-ancestry populations. However, we found three 
heterozygous novel missense LRRK2 variants of uncertain significance 
overrepresented in cases, two of which - p.Glu268Ala and p.Arg1538Cys - had a 
higher prevalence in the African ancestry population reference datasets. 
Structural variant analyses revealed the presence of PRKN CNVs with a frequency 
of 0.7% in African and African admixed cases, with 66% of CNVs detected being 
compound heterozygous or homozygous in early-onset cases, providing further 
insights into the genetic underpinnings in early-onset juvenile PD in these 
populations. Novel genetic variation overrepresented in cases versus controls 
among screened genes warrants further replication and functional prioritization 
to unravel their pathogenic potential. Here, we created the most comprehensive 
genetic catalog of both known and novel coding and splicing variants potentially 
linked to PD etiology in an underserved population. Our study has the potential 
to guide the development of targeted therapies in the emerging era of precision 
medicine. By expanding genetics research to involve underrepresented 
populations, we hope that future PD treatments are not only effective but also 
inclusive, addressing the needs of diverse ancestral groups.

Cannabis sativa is recognized for its chemical diversity and therapeutic 
potential, particularly in addressing neurodegenerative diseases such as 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Given the complexity of AD, where single-target 
therapies often prove inadequate, a multi-target approach utilizing 
cannabis-derived compounds may offer promising alternatives. This review first 
highlights the chemical diversity of cannabis by categorizing its compounds into 
cannabinoids and non-cannabinoids. It then examines studies investigating the 
effects of these compounds on AD-related pathological features. By synthesizing 
existing knowledge, identifying research gaps, and facilitating comparative 
analysis, this review aims to advance future research and understanding. It 
underscores cannabis's potential as a multi-target therapeutic strategy for AD, 
contributing valuable insights to ongoing scientific discussions.

The myeloid-specific triggering receptors expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) 
is a group of class I receptors expressed in brain microglia plays a decisive 
role in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Nasu 
Hakola disease (NHD). The extracellular domain (ECD) of TREM2 interacts with a 
wide-range of ligands, yet the molecular mechanism underlying recognition of 
such ligands to this class I receptor remains underexplored. Herein, we 
undertook a systematic investigation for exploring the mode of ligand 
recognition in immunoglobulin-like ectodomain by employing both knowledge-based 
and machine-learning guided molecular docking approach followed by the 
state-of-the-art all atoms molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Besides the 
known binding site formed by complementarity-determining regions (CDR) 1 and 
CDR2 loops, which enables the binding of different anionic ligands, our study 
identifies the presence of second binding site formed by β-strands towards the 
C-terminal end. We observe a dense network of hydrophobic contacts formed 
between the explored ligands and CDR loops and β-strands, specifically CDR1, 
CDR2, β-strand C', loop connecting β-strand D and E, and loop connecting 
β-strand E and F. Ligand binding in immunoglobulin-like ectodomain increases the 
conformational flexibility of CDR2 loop, thus most frequently observed 
pathogenic variants i.e. R47H and R62H in TREM2 may affect the development and 
progression of AD. Our knowledge-based and machine-learning guided docking and 
physics-based simulations study unveils deep insights into the endogenous ligand 
recognition by the positive surface ligand binding site and distant core site 
pave the way for exploration of other small molecules towards development of 
novel therapeutics against Alzheimer's disease.

Dance or rhythmic movement-based training has demonstrated significant efficacy 
in addressing a range of motor and cognitive deficits associated with 
neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. Leveraging 
both human and non-human animal behavioral and neurobiological evidence, I 
hypothesize a possible untapped role of dance training in mitigating impairments 
in the motor control of speech, a complex sensorimotor behavior affected in 
these conditions. Here, this hypothesis is supported by an in-depth examination 
of motor speech deficits in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, at a 
behavioral, physiological, and neural level. Additionally, literature on the 
impact of dance training on behaviors and brain pathways possibly relevant to 
speech motor control in populations with neurodegenerative diseases is 
thoroughly reviewed. Synthesizing these findings, I propose repurposing dance as 
a novel treatment for motor speech deficits and outline specific experiments to 
test this hypothesis. By comprehensively investigating the full spectrum of the 
effects of a motor-based training, i.e., dance, on often overlooked motor-based 
behaviors, such as speech, we may uncover novel therapeutic avenues of a 
practice that has already shown promising implications.

Retromer mediates retrograde transport of protein cargoes from endosomes to the 
trans-Golgi network (TGN). γ-secretase is a protease that cleaves the 
transmembrane domain of its target proteins. Although retromer can form a stable 
complex with γ-secretase, the functional consequences of this interaction are 
not known. Here, we report that retromer-mediated retrograde protein trafficking 
in cultured human epithelial cells is impaired by the γ-secretase inhibitor XXI 
or by knockout of PS1 (also known as PSEN1), the catalytic subunit of 
γ-secretase. These treatments inhibited endosome-to-TGN trafficking of 
retromer-dependent retrograde cellular cargoes, divalent metal transporter 1 
isoform II, cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor and shiga toxin, 
whereas trafficking of retromer-independent cargoes, cholera toxin and a mutant 
CIMPR unable to bind retromer was not affected. Moreover, we found that 
γ-secretase associates with retromer cargoes even in the absence of retromer. 
XXI treatment and PS1 knockout did not inhibit the ability of retromer or 
γ-secretase to associate with cargo and did not affect the expression of 
retromer subunits or Rab7-GTP, which regulates retromer-cargo interaction. These 
results imply that the γ-secretase-retromer interaction facilitates 
retromer-mediated retrograde trafficking of cellular transmembrane proteins.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial pathology, responsible for 
neurodegenerative disorders which in more than 60% of patients evolve into 
dementia. Comprehension of the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathology and 
the development of reliable diagnostic methods have made new and more effective 
therapies possible. In recent years, in addition to the classic 
anticholinesterases (AChEs), which can control the clinical symptoms of the 
disease, compounds able to reduce deposits of amyloid-β (Aβ) and/or tau (τ) 
protein aggregates, which are disease-modifying therapeutics (DMTs), have been 
studied. The results have shown that symptomatic therapy works best when 
administered in the disease's mild to moderate clinical phase. On the other 
hand, treatment with DMTs has been found to be more effective in the preclinical 
stage of AD, when Aβ and τ protein neurofibrillary tangles have not yet been 
compromised and patients still have a normal quality of life. This innovative 
approach requires the identification of specific biomarkers predictive of the 
disease, detectable many years before clinical signs are evident. Biomarkers 
allow early diagnosis, give indications of the possible development of dementia 
in the future, and make it possible to study the evolution of the disease. New 
scenarios, involving different pathways and approaches, could emerge and provide 
effective therapies to treat the very early stages of the disease and hamper its 
progression. The specific biomarkers studied so far have been reported here.

According to epidemiological studies, diabetes is more common in patients with 
AD, which suggests that diabetes is a significant risk factor for AD. 
Accelerating brain cell degeneration, worsening cognitive decline, and 
increasing susceptibility to AD can be attributed to pathogenic mechanisms 
linked to diabetes, such as impaired insulin signaling in the brain, 
neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and vascular 
impairment. These factors can also lead to the accumulation of β-amyloid and tau 
protein phosphorylation. New research suggests that certain drugs used to manage 
diabetes have different levels of effectiveness in treating or preventing 
Alzheimer's disease. Exercise has numerous advantages, including the reduction 
of neuroinflammation, alleviation of oxidative stress and mitochondrial 
dysfunction, improvement of endothelial and cerebrovascular function, 
stimulation of neurogenesis, and prevention of pathological changes associated 
with diabetes-related Alzheimer's disease through various internal mechanisms. 
This study examined the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in relation to 
diabetes, evaluated the ability of specific antidiabetic drugs to prevent and 
treat AD, and investigated the impacts and underlying processes of exercise 
interventions in improving AD treatment for individuals with diabetes.

The VA Million Veteran Program (MVP) is a nationwide initiative that seeks to 
examine how genes influence health and behaviors in military veterans. An 
article by Merritt et al. analyzing data from the MVP, developing and testing 
algorithms to query dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnoses from the 
VA's electronic health record system and examining genetic factors, provides an 
extraordinarily important contribution to the dementia and AD fields. The 
analyses presented in the article show how large databases can be used to 
further understand dementia and AD, pointing the way for many more important 
advances for this field.

BACKGROUND: The introduction of therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease has led to 
increased interest in precisely quantifying amyloid-β (Aβ) burden for diagnosis, 
treatment monitoring, and further clinical research. Recent positron emission 
tomography (PET) hardware innovations including digital detectors have led to 
superior resolution and sensitivity, improving quantitative accuracy. However, 
the effect of PET scanner on Centiloid remains relatively unexplored and is 
assumed to be minimized by harmonizing PET resolutions.
OBJECTIVE: To quantify the differences in Centiloid between scanners in a paired 
cohort.
METHODS: 36 participants from the Australian Imaging, Biomarker and Lifestyle 
study (AIBL) cohort were scanned within a year on two scanners. Each participant 
underwent 18F-NAV4694 imaging on two of the three scanners investigated, the 
Siemens Vision, the Siemens mCT and the Philips Gemini. We compared Aβ Centiloid 
quantification between scanners and assessed the effectiveness of 
post-reconstruction PET resolution harmonization. We further compared the 
scanner differences in target sub-regions and with different reference regions 
to assess spatial variability.
RESULTS: Centiloid from the Vision camera was found to be significantly higher 
compared to the Gemini and mCT; the difference was greater at high-Centiloid 
levels. Post-reconstruction resolution harmonization only accounted for and 
corrected ∼20% of the Centiloid (CL) difference between scanners. We further 
demonstrated that residual differences have effects that vary spatially between 
different subregions of the Centiloid mask.
CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that the type of PET scanner that a 
participant is scanned on affects Centiloid quantification, even when scanner 
resolution is harmonized. We conclude by highlighting the need for further 
investigation into harmonization techniques that consider scanner differences.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition marked by 
memory loss and cognitive decline. With current treatments offering limited 
effectiveness, researchers are turning to natural products that can target 
various aspects of AD pathology. Clinically approved natural products, such as 
galantamine and huperzine A, have shown success in AD treatments. Furthermore, 
compounds such as epigallocatechin gallate, quercetin, and resveratrol are in 
clinical trials. This Perspective examines nearly 100 natural compounds with 
promising neuroprotective effects in preclinical and clinical studies. These 
compounds exhibit diverse pharmacological actions that help to prevent 
neurodegeneration while improving cognitive functions. Their unique structures 
further enhance their biological activities, making them promising candidates 
for drug discovery. This Perspective stresses the importance of further clinical 
research to maximize the medical benefits of these compounds and highlights 
their potential as innovative remedies for AD. Continued exploration of these 
compounds is crucial to fully leverage their capabilities in combating AD.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
affecting millions worldwide, leading to cognitive and functional decline. Early 
detection and intervention are crucial for enhancing the quality of life of 
patients and their families. Remote Monitoring Technologies (RMTs) offer a 
promising solution for early detection by tracking changes in behavioral and 
cognitive functions, such as memory, language, and problem-solving skills. 
Timely detection of these symptoms can facilitate early intervention, 
potentially slowing disease progression and enabling appropriate treatment and 
care.
METHODS: The RADAR-AD study was designed to evaluate the accuracy and validity 
of multiple RMTs in detecting functional decline across various stages of AD in 
a real-world setting, compared to standard clinical rating scales. Our approach 
involved a univariate analysis using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) to analyze 
individual features of six RMTs while adjusting for variables such as age, sex, 
years of education, clinical site, BMI and season. Additionally, we employed 
four machine learning classifiers - Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random 
Forest, and XGBoost - using a nested cross-validation approach to assess the 
discriminatory capabilities of the RMTs.
RESULTS: The ANCOVA results indicated significant differences between healthy 
and AD subjects regarding reduced physical activity, less REM sleep, altered 
gait patterns, and decreased cognitive functioning. The machine-learning-based 
analysis demonstrated that RMT-based models could identify subjects in the 
prodromal stage with an Area Under the ROC Curve of 73.0 %. In addition, our 
findings show that the Amsterdam iADL questionnaire has high discriminatory 
abilities.
CONCLUSIONS: RMTs show promise in AD detection already in the prodromal stage. 
Using them could allow for earlier detection and intervention, thereby improving 
patients' quality of life. Furthermore, the Amsterdam iADL questionnaire holds

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia. Monoclonal 
antibodies (MABs) serve as a promising therapeutic approach for AD by 
selectively targeting key pathogenic factors, such as amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide, 
tau protein, and neuroinflammation. Specifically, based on their efficacy in 
removing Aβ plaques from the brains of patients with AD, the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration has approved three anti-amyloid MABs, aducanumab (Aduhelm®), 
lecanemab (Leqembi®), and donanemab (Kisunla™). Notably, lecanemab received 
traditional approval after demonstrating clinical benefit, supporting the Aβ 
cascade hypothesis. These MABs targeting Aβ are categorized based on their 
affinity to diverse conformational features of Aβ, including monomer, fibril, 
protofibril, and plaque forms of Aβ as well as pyroglutamate Aβ. 
First-generation MABs targeting the non-toxic monomeric Aβ, such as solanezumab, 
bapineuzumab, and crenezumab, failed to demonstrate clinical benefit for AD in 
clinical trials. In contrast, second-generation MABs, including aducanumab, 
lecanemab, donanemab, and gantenerumab directed against pathogenic Aβ species 
and aggregates have shown that reducing Aβ deposition can be an effective 
strategy to slow cognitive impairment in AD. In this review, we provide a 
comprehensive overview of the current status, mechanisms, outcomes, and 
limitations of second-generation MABs for the clinical treatment of AD. 
Moreover, we discuss the perspectives and future directions of anti-amyloid MABs 
in the treatment of AD.

Irregular sleep-wake rhythm disorder: From the pathophysiologic perspective to 
the treatment.

Irregular sleep-wake rhythm disorder (ISWRD) is an intrinsic circadian rhythm 
disorder caused by loss of the brain's circadian regulation, through changes of 
the input and/or output to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), or of the SCN 
itself. Although there are limited prevalence data for this rare disease, ISWRD 
is associated with neurodegenerative disorders, including the Alzheimer disease 
(AD) and the Parkinson disease (PD), which will become increasingly prevalent in 
an aging population. It additionally presents in childhood developmental 
disorders, psychiatric disorders, and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Patients 
present with unpredictable, short sleep periods over a 24-h period, with 
significant day-to-day and weekly variability. Symptoms manifest as insomnia and 
excessive daytime sleepiness. Sleep logs and actigraphy monitoring capture 
rest-activity patterns required for diagnosis. Treatment aims to enhance 
external circadian cues through timed light therapy, behavioral activity 
regimens, and melatonin, but efficacy remains quite limited. Pathophysiology of 
ISWRD in association with various diseases and their specific management are 
discussed. There is a need for further investigation of disease pathophysiology, 
development of widely applicable tools for diagnosis, and development of 
treatments.

Sleep-wake disorders are recognized as one of the earliest symptoms of Alzheimer 
disease (AD). Accumulating evidence has highlighted a significant association 
between sleep-wake disorders and AD pathogenesis, suggesting that sleep-wake 
modulation could be a promising approach for postponing AD onset. The 
suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and the pineal hormone melatonin are major central 
modulating components of the circadian rhythm system. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
melatonin levels are dramatically decreased in AD. Interestingly, the number of 
neurofibrillary tangles in the hippocampus, which is one of the two major 
neuropathologic AD biomarkers, increases in parallel with the decrease in CSF 
melatonin levels. Furthermore, a decrease in salivary melatonin levels in 
middle-aged persons is a significant risk factor for the onset of the early 
stages of AD. Moreover, the disappearance of rhythmic fluctuations in melatonin 
may be one of the best biomarkers for AD diagnosis. Light therapy combined with 
melatonin supplementation is the recommended first-line treatment for sleep-wake 
disorders in AD patients and may be beneficial for ameliorating cognitive 
impairment. Sleep-wake cycle modulation based on AD risk gene presence is a 
promising early intervention for AD onset postponement.

Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, orexin, and sleep-wake cycle: The link with 
the neurodegeneration.

Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) significantly affects the sleep-wake 
circadian rhythm through intermittent hypoxia and chronic sleep fragmentation. 
OSAS patients often experience excessive daytime sleepiness, frequent 
awakenings, and sleep fragmentation, leading to a disrupted circadian rhythm and 
altered sleep-wake cycle. These disruptions may exacerbate OSAS symptoms and 
contribute to neurodegenerative processes, particularly through the modulation 
of clock gene expression such as CLOCK, BMAL1, and PER. Emerging evidence 
connects OSAS to cognitive impairment and suggests that these changes may 
contribute to the development of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer 
disease, suggesting that OSAS could be a reversible risk factor for these 
conditions. Biomarkers, including melatonin and orexin, play crucial roles in 
understanding these mechanisms. In OSAS patients, melatonin, a marker of 
circadian rhythmicity, often shows altered secretion patterns that are not fully 
corrected by continuous positive airway pressure therapy. Orexin, which 
regulates the sleep-wake cycle, exhibits increased cerebrospinal fluid levels in 
OSAS patients, possibly due to compensatory mechanisms against sleep impairment 
and daytime sleepiness. These biomarkers highlight the intricate relationship 
between circadian rhythm disruptions and neurodegenerative risks in OSAS, 
emphasizing the need for further research and potential therapeutic strategies 
to mitigate these effects and improve patient outcomes.

Growth and differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), a member of the transforming 
growth factor-βsuperfamily, is considered a stress response factor and has 
garnered increasing attention in recent years due to its roles in neurological 
diseases. Although many studies have suggested that GDF15 expression is elevated 
in patients with neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), glioma, and ischemic stroke, 
the effects of increased GDF15 expression and the potential underlying 
mechanisms remain unclear. Notably, many experimental studies have shown the 
multidimensional beneficial effects of GDF15 on NDDs, and GDF15 overexpression 
is able to rescue NDD-associated pathological changes and phenotypes. In glioma, 
GDF15 exerts opposite effects, it is both protumorigenic and antitumorigenic. 
The causes of these conflicting findings are not comprehensively clear, but 
inhibiting GDF15 is helpful for suppressing tumor progression. GDF15 is also 
regarded as a biomarker of poor clinical outcomes in ischemic stroke patients, 
and targeting GDF15 may help prevent this disease. Thus, we systematically 
reviewed the synthesis, transcriptional regulation, and biological functions of 
GDF15 and its related signaling pathways within the brain. Furthermore, we 
explored the potential of GDF15 as a therapeutic target and assessed its 
clinical applicability in interventions for brain diseases. By integrating the 
latest research findings, this study provides new insights into the future 
treatment of neurological diseases.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia. Its incidence is 
rising rapidly as the global population ages, leading to a significant social 
and economic burden. AD involves complex pathologies, including amyloid plaque 
accumulation, synaptic dysfunction, and neuroinflammation. This study explores 
the therapeutic potential of N 5 -((perfluorophenyl)amino)glutamine (RA-PF), a 
derivative of γ-glutamyl-N'-(2-hydroxyphenyl)hydrazide (Ramalin), a compound 
with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Administration of RA-PF to 
5xFAD mice decreases BACE1, reduces Aβ plaque deposition, inhibits microglial 
activation, restores synaptic transmission, and improves mitochondrial motility, 
leading to the recovery of cognitive function. Additionally, RA-PF treatment in 
3xTg-AD mice alleviates anxiety-like behaviors, tau phosphorylation via 
inactivating GSK-3β, and BACE1 expression. Further transcriptomic analysis 
reveals RA-PF treatment in AD mice models recovers phagosome, inflammation, 
NOD-like receptor, presynaptic membrane, and postsynaptic membrane related 
signaling pathways. These findings suggest that RA-PF effectively targets 
multiple aspects of AD pathology, offering a novel multi-target approach for AD 
treatment.

BACKGROUND: Researchers have encountered challenges in recruiting unpaid 
caregivers of people living with Alzheimer disease and related dementias for 
intervention studies. However, little is known about the reasons for 
nonparticipation in in-home smart health interventions in community-based 
settings.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to (1) assess recruitment rates in a smart health 
technology intervention for caregivers of people living with Alzheimer disease 
and related dementias and reasons for nonparticipation among them and (2) 
discuss lessons learned from recruitment challenges and strategies to improve 
recruitment.
METHODS: The smart health intervention was a 4-month, single-arm trial designed 
to evaluate an in-home, technology-based intervention that monitors stressful 
moments for caregiving dyads through acoustic signals and to provide the 
caregivers with real-time stress management strategies. The recruitment involved 
two main methods: on-site engagement by a recruiter from a memory clinic and 
social media advertising. Caregivers were screened for eligibility by phone 
between January 2021 and September 2023. The recruitment rates, reasons for 
nonparticipation, and participant demographics were analyzed using descriptive 
statistics.
RESULTS: Of 201 caregivers contacted, 11 were enrolled in this study. Eighty-two 
caregivers did not return the screening call, and others did not participate due 
to privacy concerns (n=30), lack of interest (n=29), and burdensome study 
procedures (n=26). Our recruitment strategies included addressing privacy 
concerns, visualizing collected data through a dashboard, boosting social media 
presence, increasing the recruitment budget, updating advertisements, and 
preparing and deploying additional study devices.
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlighted barriers to participation in the smart 
health intervention. Despite several recruitment strategies, enrollment rates 
remained below expectations. These findings underscore the need for future 
research to explore alternative methods for increasing the recruitment of 
informal dementia caregivers in technology-based intervention studies.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), an age-related neurodegenerative disease, brings huge 
damage to the society, to the whole family and even to the patient himself. 
However, until now, the etiological factor of AD is still unknown and there is 
no effective treatment for it. Massive deposition of amyloid-beta peptide(Aβ) 
and hyperphosphorylation of Tau proteins are acknowledged pathological features 
of AD. Recent studies have revealed that neuroinflammation plays a pivotal role 
in the pathology of AD. With the rise of nanomaterials in the biomedical field, 
researchers are exploring how the unique properties of these materials can be 
leveraged to develop effective treatments for AD. This article has summarized 
the influence of neuroinflammation in AD, the design of nanoplatforms, and the 
current research status and inadequacy of nanomaterials in improving 
neuroinflammation in AD.

A-kinase anchoring protein 79/150 (AKAP79/150) is a crucial scaffolding protein 
that positions various proteins at specific synaptic sites to modulate 
excitatory synaptic intensity. As our understanding of AKAP79/150's biology 
deepens, along with its significant role in the pathophysiology of various human 
disorders, there is growing evidence that reveals new opportunities for 
therapeutic interventions. In this review, we examine the fundamental structure 
and primary functions of AKAP79/150, emphasizing its pathophysiological 
mechanisms in different nervous system disorders, particularly inflammatory 
pain, epilepsy, depression, and Alzheimer's disease. We also discuss its 
potential therapeutic implications for patients suffering from these conditions.

[The role of somatostatin and its systemic release in inflammatory, painful and 
other conditions].

Somatostatin (SST) is a multifunctional peptide hormone of 14–28 amino acids, 
first discovered in the hypothalamus and later detected in other tissues, acting 
through different receptors (SST1–5). It has mainly inhibitory properties in 
endocrine and various nervous system processes. Its physiological properties and 
role go beyond the regulation of hormones, and it is involved in the modulation 
and regulation of neurogenic inflammation. During neurogenic inflammation, 
neuropeptides released from sensory neurons – such as substance P and the 
gene-related peptide calcitonin (CGRP) – trigger inflammatory responses. SST 
inhibits the release of these, other mediators and the associated inflammatory 
processes. The anti-inflammatory effect of SST has animportant clinical 
relevance in the treatment of neurological and inflammatory diseases (e.g., 
Alzheimer’s disease, migraine, chronic pain syndrome, neurodegenerative 
disorders, etc.). Synthetic derivatives (e.g., octreotide) can also be used in 
various clinical conditions, as well as in the treatment of neuroendocrine 
tumours (they inhibit excessive hormone production and tumour growth). Recent 
research has highlighted the importance of SST in pain perception. SST and its 
analogues are able to reduce nociceptive transmission and thus modulate pain 
sensation, especially in chronic and neuropathic pain. SST and its analogues 
represent a potential therapeutic target for modulating neurogenic and 
inflammatory pathophysiological processes, as a target for the treatment of pain 
and inflammatory diseases. Orv Hetil. 2025; 166(4): 123–129.

peptidhormon, amelyet először a hypothalamusban fedeztek fel, majd később egyéb 
szöveti struktúrákban is kimutattak. Hatását különböző receptorokon (SST1–5)

neuropeptidek – például a P-anyag és a kalcitoningénnel rokon peptid (CGRP) – 
gyulladásos reakciókat váltanak ki. A szomatosztatin gátolja e mediátorok 
felszabadulását és az ezekhez kapcsolódó gyulladásos folyamatokat is. 
Gyulladáscsökkentő hatása fontos klinikai jelentőséggel bír a neurológiai és 
gyulladásos betegségek (például Alzheimer-kór, migrén, krónikus fájdalom 
szindróma, neurodegeneratív kórképek stb.) kezelésében. Szintetikus származékai 
(például rheumatoid), szintén alkalmazhatók különböző klinikai állapotokban, 
továbbá neuroendokrin tumorok kezelésében (gátolják a túlzott hormontermelést és 
a tumor növekedését). Az utóbbi évek kutatási eredményei rávilágítottak a 
szomatosztatin jelentőségére a fájdalomérzékelés tekintetében is. A 
szomatosztatin és analógjai képesek csökkenteni a nociceptiv ingerületátvitelt, 
így modulálják a fájdalomérzést, különösen krónikus és neuropathiás fájdalmak 
esetében. A szomatosztatin és analógjai potenciális terápiás célpontot 
jelentenek a neurogén és gyulladásos patofiziológiai folyamatok modulálásában, 
célpontként szolgálnak a fájdalomcsillapításban és a gyulladásos betegségek 
kezelésében. Orv Hetil. 2025; 166(4): 123–129.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly, 
clinically characterized by memory loss, cognitive decline, and behavioral 
disturbances. Its pathogenesis is not fully comprehended but involves 
intracellular depositions of amyloid beta peptide (Aβ) and neurofibrillary 
tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau. Currently, pharmacological interventions 
solely slow the progression of symptoms. Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) is 
a simple and valuable organism to study the dynamics of Aβ. It may contribute to 
advancing our comprehension of AD development and progression, as well as to 
discovering new treatments. Herein, we describe usual protocols for evaluating 
Aβ aggregation and toxicity in transgenic C. elegans models of AD (CL2006, 
CL4176, GMC101, and CL2355 strains) through the visualization and quantification 
of the peptide with specific fluorescent dyes, in addition to the analysis of 
particular behaviors (paralysis and chemotaxis associated with learning).

The foremost cause of dementia is Alzheimer's disease (AD). The vital 
pathological hallmarks of AD are amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide and 
hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) protein. The current animal models used in AD 
research do not precisely replicate disease pathophysiology, making it difficult 
for researchers to quickly and effectively gather data or screen potential 
therapy possibilities. Several transgenic animals are used as models for AD; 
however, they have cost and time concerns. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) has become a 
suitable model organism for high-throughput pharmacological screening of 
neuroactive substances and neurodegenerative research. The past few decades have 
seen a significant increase in research on AD. The fight against amyloidosis 
has, however, been unexpectedly unsuccessful. It may be due to a need for more 
relevant in vivo models for high throughput screening, which emphasizes the need 
to find other anti-AD models. Alternative animal models, including zebrafish, 
have developed into a potentially useful research tool that must be employed for 
AD research to be effective. Only a few comprehensive zebrafish models 
exhibiting AD-like pathogenesis have been reported in the literature, and this 
book chapter describes these models.

BACKGROUND: The effect of statins use on the incidence of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) is still under debate, and it could be modified by a series of factors.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to examine the association of statins use with the risk of 
cognitive impairment and AD, and assess the moderating roles of genetic 
susceptibility and other individual-related factors.
DESIGN: A longitudinal study was conducted from the UK Biobank where individuals 
completed baseline surveys (2006-2010) and were followed (mean follow-up period: 
9 years).
SETTING: A population-based study.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 371,019 dementia-free participants (mean age 56.4 
years; 53.6% female).
MEASUREMENTS: The effects of statins use on cognitive performance and incident 
AD were examined by using linear regression model and Cox proportional hazards 
regression model, respectively. We further evaluated the moderating roles of 
genetic risks and individual-related factors on both multiplicative and additive 
scales.
RESULTS: The findings showed statins use was associated with an increased risk 
of AD development [hazard ratio (HR) 1.19 (95% CI: 1.08, 1.30)] compared with no 
use of statins. We further found significant negative additive interactions of 
statins use with APOE ε4 allele. Besides, the effects of statins use would be 
modified by age, sex and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs).
DISCUSSIONS: A protective effect of statins use was observed in those who 
carried two APOE ε4 alleles. Also, sex, age and CVDs could modify the effects of 
statins use, which would provide insights for the guideline of the statins 
therapy.

BACKGROUND: Protein abundance levels, sensitive to both physiological changes 
and external interventions, are useful for assessing the Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) risk and treatment efficacy. However, identifying proteomic prognostic 
markers for AD is challenging by their high dimensionality and inherent 
correlations.
METHODS: Our study analyzed 1128 plasma proteins, measured by the SOMAscan 
platform, from 858 participants 55 years and older (mean age 63 years, 52.9 % 
women) of the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) Offspring cohort. We conducted 
regression analysis and machine learning models, including LASSO-based Cox 
proportional hazard regression model (LASSO) and generalized boosted regression 
model (GBM), to identify protein prognostic markers. These markers were used to 
construct a weighted proteomic composite score, the AD prediction performance of 
which was assessed using time-dependent area under the curve (AUC). The 
association between the composite score and memory domain was examined in 339 
(of the 858) participants with available memory scores, and in a separate group 
of 430 participants younger than 55 years (mean age 46, 56.7 % women).
RESULTS: Over a mean follow-up of 20 years, 132 (15.4 %) participants developed 
AD. After adjusting for baseline age, sex, education, and APOE ε4 + status, 
regression models identified 309 proteins (P ≤ 0.2). After applying machine 
learning methods, nine of these proteins were selected to develop a composite 
score. This score improved AD prediction beyond the factors of age, sex, 
education, and APOE ε4 + status across 15-25 years of follow-up, achieving its 
peak AUC of 0.84 in the LASSO model at the 22-year follow-up. It also showed a 
consistent negative association with memory scores in the 339 participants (beta 
= -0.061, P = 0.046), 430 participants (beta = -0.060, P = 0.018), and the 
pooled 769 samples (beta = -0.058, P = 0.003).
CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the utility of machine learning method in 
identifying proteomic markers in improving AD prediction and emphasize the 
complex pathology of AD. The composite score may aid early AD detection and 
efficacy monitoring, warranting further validation in diverse populations.

BACKGROUND: Imaging studies showed early atrophy of the cholinergic basal 
forebrain in prodromal sporadic Alzheimer's disease and reduced posterior basal 
forebrain functional connectivity in amyloid positive individuals with 
subjective cognitive decline. Similar investigations in familial cases of 
Alzheimer's disease are still lacking.
OBJECTIVES: To test whether presenilin-1 E280A mutation carriers have reduced 
basal forebrain functional connectivity and whether this is linked to amyloid 
pathology.
DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional study that analyzes baseline functional 
imaging data.
SETTING: We obtained data from the Colombia cohort Alzheimer's Prevention 
Initiative Autosomal-Dominant Alzheimer's Disease Trial.
PARTICIPANTS: We analyzed data from 215 asymptomatic subjects carrying the 
presenilin-1 E280A mutation [64% female; 147 carriers (M = 35 years), 68 
noncarriers (M = 40 years)].
MEASUREMENTS: We extracted functional magnetic resonance imaging data using 
seed-based connectivity analysis to examine the anterior and posterior 
subdivisions of the basal forebrain. Subsequently, we performed a Bayesian 
Analysis of Covariance to assess the impact of carrier status on functional 
connectivity in relation to amyloid positivity. For comparison, we also 
investigated hippocampus connectivity.
RESULTS: We found no effect of carrier status on anterior (Bayesian Factor10 = 
1.167) and posterior basal forebrain connectivity (Bayesian Factor10 = 0.033). 
In carriers, we found no association of amyloid positivity with basal forebrain 
connectivity.
CONCLUSIONS: We falsified the hypothesis of basal forebrain connectivity 
reduction in preclinical mutation carriers with amyloid pathology. If 
replicated, these findings may not only confirm a discrepancy between familial 
and sporadic Alzheimer's disease, but also suggest new potential targets for 
future treatments.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are chronically 
underdiagnosed in the U.S., particularly among minoritized racial and ethnic 
groups. Primary care providers are at the forefront of diagnosis given the 
increasing prevalence of cases and shortage of dementia specialists. Advances in 
policy, detection, and treatment in the past decade necessitate an updated 
review of the current state of determinants of ADRD diagnosis in U.S. primary 
care settings.
METHODS: Following Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines, we conducted a scoping 
literature review on ADRD diagnosis among older adults in U.S. primary care 
settings. Studies published in English from January 2010 to January 2024 were 
retrieved from PubMed, PsycINFO, and CINAHL. We extracted primary data on study 
characteristics and synthesized key findings according to facilitators, 
barriers, and rates of diagnosis in primary care.
RESULTS: Of 563 articles retrieved, 12 met eligibility criteria. Three studies 
reported rates of diagnosis, and all but one reported facilitators and/or 
barriers to diagnosis. ADRD remains underdiagnosed in primary care settings, 
especially in the earliest symptomatic stage (i.e., mild cognitive impairment). 
Multi-level barriers and facilitators were identified including individual 
beliefs about ADRD (e.g., value of early diagnosis), interpersonal relationships 
between patients and their family members and providers (e.g., importance of an 
established clinical relationship), and healthcare system limitations (e.g., 
insufficient resources and training).
CONCLUSION: Despite national policy efforts to improve timely diagnosis of ADRD, 
underdiagnosis remains a clinical and public health challenge. Increased 
attention to social and community contexts will be important for future research 
and intervention.

BACKGROUND: Cognitive training (CT) has been one of the important 
non-pharmaceutical interventions that could delay cognitive decline. Currently, 
no definite CT methods are available. Furthermore, little attention has been 
paid to the effect of CT on mood and instrumental activities of daily living 
(IADL).
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of a multicomponent CT using a training 
program of executive functions, attention, memory and visuospatial functions 
(TEAM-V Program) on cognition, mood and instrumental ADL.
DESIGN: A randomized, single-blinded, treatment-as-usual controlled trial.
SETTING: Geriatric clinic in Bangkok, Thailand.
PARTICIPANTS: 80 nondemented community-dwelling older adults (mean age 65.7 ± 
4.3 years).
INTERVENTION: The CT (TEAM-V) Program or the treatment-as-usual controlled 
group. The TEAM-V intervention was conducted over 5 sessions, with a 2-week 
interval between each session. A total of 80 participants were randomized (n = 
40 the TEAM-V Program; n = 40 the control group).
MEASUREMENTS: The Thai version of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), The 
Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-cog), Thai version 
of Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and The Chula ADL were used to 
assess at baseline, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years.
RESULTS: Compared with the control arm (n = 36), the TEAM-V Program (n = 39) was 
associated with significantly improved general cognition (MoCA, P = 0.02) at 2 
years. Compared with baseline, participants receiving the TEAM-V Program were 
associated with significantly improved immediate recall (word recall task, P < 
0.001), retrieval and retention of memory processes (word recognition task, P = 
0.01) and attention (number cancellation part A, P = 0.01) at 2 years. No 
training effects on anxiety (P = 0.94), depression (P = 0.093) and IADL (P = 
0.48) were detected.
CONCLUSIONS: The TEAM-V Program was effective in improving global cognitive 
function. Even though, the program did not significantly improve anxiety, 
depression and IADL compared with the control group, memory and attention 
improved in the intervention group compared with baseline. Further studies 
incorporating a larger sample size, longitudinal follow-up and higher-intensity 
CT should be conducted.

BACKGROUND: Recent disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer's disease show 
promise to slow cognitive decline, but show no efficacy towards reducing 
symptoms already manifested.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the efficacy of a novel noninvasive brain stimulation 
technique in modulating cognitive functioning in Alzheimer's dementia (AD).
DESIGN: Pilot, randomized, double-blind, parallel, sham-controlled study 
SETTING: Clinical research site at UT Southwestern Medical Center PARTICIPANTS: 
Twenty-five participants with clinical diagnoses of AD were enrolled from 
cognition specialty clinics.
INTERVENTION: Treatment consisted of high definition transcranial direct current 
stimulation (HD-tDCS) delivered for 20 min over the medial prefrontal cortex. 
Ten sessions of sham, 1 mA, or 2 mA stimulation were received.
MEASUREMENTS: Cognitive outcomes were measured at baseline, after the last 
HD-tDCS session, and 8-weeks post-treatment. The primary outcome was change in 
total learning and delayed recall on the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test 
(RAVLT) immediately post-treatment and at 8-weeks. Secondary outcomes included 
measures of language, processing speed, and executive functioning. A multi-stage 
approach was used to examine cognitive outcomes, which included evaluation of 
effect sizes, statistical effects, and rate of clinically meaningful responses.
RESULTS: In this pilot trial, no statistically significant differences on 
cognitive outcomes were found between sham and active HD-tDCS immediately 
post-treatment (p's > 0.05). However, moderate-to-large effect sizes were 
identified for enhanced RAVLT total learning (Cohen's d = 0.69-0.93) and 
phonemic fluency (d = 1.08-1.49) for both active HD-tDCS conditions compared to 
sham, with rates of clinically relevant improvement between 25 and 33%. 
Meaningful enhancement persisted to 8 weeks only for the 1 mA condition.
CONCLUSIONS: Multiple sessions of HD-tDCS over the medial prefrontal cortex 
appears to have potential to produce meaningful cognitive enhancements in a 
proportion of patients having AD with improvements maintained for at least 8 
weeks in some.

Autosomal dominant mutations in the gene encoding the DNA and RNA binding 
protein FUS are a cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and about 
0·3-0·9% of patients with ALS are FUS mutation carriers. FUS-mutation-associated 
ALS (FUS-ALS) is characterised by early onset and rapid progression, compared 
with other forms of ALS. However, different pathogenic mutations in FUS can 
result in markedly different age at symptom onset and rate of disease 
progression. Most FUS mutations disrupt its nuclear localisation, leading to its 
cytoplasmic accumulation in the CNS. FUS also forms inclusions in around 5% of 
patients with the related neurodegenerative condition frontotemporal dementia. 
However, there are key differences between the two diseases at the genetic and 
neuropathological level, which suggest distinct pathogenic processes. 
Experimental models have uncovered potential pathogenic mechanisms in FUS-ALS 
and informed therapeutic strategies that are currently in development, including 
the silencing of FUS expression using an intrathecally administered antisense 
oligonucleotide.

BACKGROUND: No treatments exist for apathy in people with frontotemporal 
dementia. Previously, in a randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
dose-finding study, intranasal oxytocin administration in people with 
frontotemporal dementia improved apathy ratings on the Neuropsychiatric 
Inventory over 1 week and, in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
crossover study, a single dose of 72 IU oxytocin increased 
blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal in limbic brain regions. We aimed to 
determine whether longer treatment with oxytocin improves apathy in people with 
frontotemporal dementia.
METHODS: We conducted a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, adaptive, crossover, phase 2a/2b trial, enrolling 
participants from 11 expert frontotemporal dementia outpatient clinics across 
Canada and the USA. People aged 30-80 years with a diagnosis of probable 
frontotemporal dementia, a Neuropsychiatric Inventory apathy score of 2 or 
higher, a study partner who interacted with them for at least 3 h per day, and 
stable cognitive and behavioural medications for 30 days were eligible for 
inclusion. In stage 1, participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1:1) to one 
of three dose schedules (every day, every other day, and every third day) of 72 
IU intranasal oxytocin or placebo and to the order they would received the 
intervention in the crossover; intranasal oxytocin or placebo were administered 
twice daily for 6 weeks, with a 6-week washout and then crossover to the other 
intervention. In stage 2, new participants were randomised (1:1) to the dose 
that had been determined as optimal in stage 1 or to placebo, with crossover as 
in stage 1. Randomisation used variable block sizes and was stratified by 
participant sex and Clinical Dementia Rating severity score. All kits of 
investigational product were identical and produced centrally, and all local 
teams, study staff, and participants were masked to treatment allocation and 
order. The primary outcome was difference in the change in Neuropsychiatric 
Inventory apathy scores for oxytocin versus placebo periods in the per-protocol 
population after 6 weeks of treatment. Safety was assessed at each visit via 
electrocardiogram, blood work, and collection of data on adverse events. This 
trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03260920).
FINDINGS: Between Jan 31, 2018, and Dec 11, 2020, 70 patients were screened for 
stage 1 and 60 (86%) were enrolled. 45 (75%) completed both treatment periods of 
stage 1. 72 IU oxytocin every third day was the optimal dose schedule from stage 
1 based on its Bayesian posterior probability (Pr(Best)=0·478). Between June 28, 
2021, and Jan 31, 2023, 42 patients were screened for stage 2, and 34 (81%) were 
enrolled. 28 (82%) completed both treatment periods in stage 2. 38 (40%) of 94 
participants were female and 56 (60%) were male (mean age 65·9 years, SD 8·2) 
Treatment with oxytocin every third day resulted in an improved Neuropsychiatric 
Inventory apathy score, with an estimated -1·32 points (95% CI -2·43 to -0·21) 
relative to placebo (one sided p=0·010). Two adverse events were reported in at 
least 5% of participants: upper respiratory tract infection (five [6%] of 78 
participants on placebo and three [5%] on every third day at all doses of 
oxytocin) and headache (two [3%] participants on placebo, one [7%] of 15 
participants on oxytocin every day, and two [4%] of 55 participants on oxytocin 
every third day). No adverse events were attributed to oxytocin treatment.
INTERPRETATION: Intranasal oxytocin given every third day was well tolerated and 
was associated with a small reduction in apathy in patients with frontotemporal 
dementia. Future trials might investigate intermittent dosing of more potent 
formulations than in this study, to establish whether larger effects are 
possible.

The search for novel cholinesterase inhibitors is essential for advancing 
treatments for neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). In 
this study, we employed the Rosetta pepspec module, originally developed for 
designing peptides targeting protein-protein interactions, to design de novo 
peptides targeting the peripheral aromatic site (PAS) of acetylcholinesterase 
(AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). A total of nine peptides were designed 
for human AChE (hAChE), T. californica AChE (TcAChE), and human BChE (hBChE). 
These peptides were synthesized using Fmoc-SPPS and tested in vitro using 
Ellman's reaction to evaluate their inhibitory potency. Peptide 11tA, designed 
for TcAChE, exhibited potent inhibition of hAChE (IC50 = 1.21 ± 0.25 µM) and 
demonstrated strong antioxidant activity against DPPH radicals and lipid 
peroxidation, making it a promising multitherapeutic candidate for AD. Peptide 
11hB, designed for hBChE, showed the highest inhibitory activity against hBChE, 
with a Ki of 12.69 ± 1.27 µM, making it the most potent natural amino acid 
peptide reported against hBChE. The computational protocol effectively 
distinguished the specific characteristics of each enzyme target. Toxicity 
assessments, including hemolysis tests and A. salina lethality assays, revealed 
no toxic effects at low concentrations, further supporting the potential of 
these peptides for peptide-based drug development in AD. This study underscores 
the growing potential of peptides as alternatives to small-molecule drugs. It 
demonstrates that computational protocols for protein-protein interactions can 
be successfully adapted to design high-affinity peptide inhibitors.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: This study assessed the utilization of potentially 
inappropriate medications (PIM) including oral sedative-hypnotic and atypical 
antipsychotic (OSHAA), healthcare resource utilization (HCRU), and costs among 
elderly individuals with insomnia and in the subpopulation with Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) who also had a diagnosis of insomnia.
METHODS: Using a claims database containing International Classification of 
Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes, the cohort included individuals 
aged ≥ 65 with incident insomnia (EI, N = 152 969) and AD insomnia subpopulation 
(ADI, N = 4888). The proportion of patients utilizing atypical antipsychotics or 
oral sedative-hypnotic medications, namely z-drugs, benzodiazepines, doxepin, 
dual orexin receptor antagonists (DORAs), and melatonin agonists, were assessed. 
Inappropriate OSHAA utilization was defined as per the American Geriatrics 
Society (AGS) Beers criteria. Multivariable models were utilized to compare HCRU 
and costs between PIM-OSHAA and no PIM-OSHAA groups.
RESULTS: Among the EI cohort, z-drugs (13.39%) were the most commonly utilized 
OSHAA, and in the ADI cohort, it was AAPs (29.97%). PIM-OSHAA was utilized by 
20% of the EI and 35% of the ADI cohorts. Patients with PIM-OSHAA use among the 
EI cohort had a higher annualized adjusted mean HCRU (pharmacy visits: 31.21 vs. 
23.68; ambulatory and outpatient visits: 18.55 vs. 16.85) and costs, primarily 
due to medical costs (mean total cost: $36 676.08 vs. $31 346.54) compared to 
those without.
CONCLUSIONS: Substantial utilization of PIM-OSHAA was observed in EI and ADI 
cohorts. PIM-OSHAA use was associated with higher HCRU and costs. These findings 
underscore the importance of appropriate treatment strategies for insomnia in 
the elderly population especially in those with concurrent AD.

Adaptive promising zone design for sequential parallel comparison design with 
continuous outcomes.

INTRODUCTION: The sequential parallel comparison design has emerged as a 
valuable tool in clinical trials with high placebo response rates. To further 
enhance its efficiency and effectiveness, adaptive strategies, such as sample 
size adjustment and allocation ratio modification can be employed.
METHODS: We compared the performance of Jennison and Turnbull's method and the 
Promising Zone approach for sample size adjustment in a two-phase sequential 
parallel comparison design study. We also evaluated the impact of allocation 
ratio adjustments using Neyman and Optimal allocation strategies. Various 
scenarios were simulated to assess the effects of different design parameters, 
including weight in the test statistic, initial randomization ratio, and interim 
analysis timing.
RESULTS: The Promising Zone approach demonstrated superior or comparable power 
to Jennison and Turnbull's method at equivalent expected sample sizes while 
maintaining the intuitive property that more promising interim results lead to 
smaller required follow-up sample sizes. However, the Promising Zone approach 
may require a larger maximum possible sample size in some cases. The addition of 
allocation ratio adjustments offered minimal improvements overall, but showed 
potential benefits when the variance in the treatment group was larger than that 
in the placebo group. We also applied our findings to a real-world example from 
the AVP-923 trial in patients with Alzheimer's disease-related agitation, 
demonstrating the practical implications of adaptive sequential parallel 
comparison designs in clinical research.
DISCUSSION: Adaptive strategies can significantly enhance the efficiency of 
sequential parallel comparison designs. The choice between sample size 
adjustment methods should consider trade-offs between power, expected sample 
size, and maximum adjusted sample size. Although allocation ratio adjustments 
showed limited overall impact, they may be beneficial in specific scenarios. 
Future research should explore the application of these adaptive strategies to 
binary and survival outcomes in sequential parallel comparison designs.

BACKGROUND: Volume alterations in the parietal subregion have received less 
attention in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and their role in predicting conversion 
of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD and cognitively normal (CN) to MCI 
remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to assess the volumetric variation of 
the parietal subregion at different cognitive stages in AD and to determine the 
role of parietal subregions in CN and MCI conversion.
METHODS: We included 662 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) database, including 228 CN, 221 early MCI (EMCI), 112 late MCI 
(LMCI), and 101 AD participants. We measured the volume of the parietal 
subregion based on the Human Brainnetome Atlas (BNA-246) using voxel-based 
morphometry among individuals at various stages of AD and the progressive and 
stable individuals in CN and MCI. We then calculated the area under the curve 
(AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to test the ability 
of parietal subregions to discriminate between different cognitive groups. The 
Cox proportional hazard model was constructed to determine which specific 
parietal subregions, alone or in combination, could be used to predict 
progression from MCI to AD and CN to MCI. Finally, we examined the relationship 
between the cognitive scores and parietal subregion volume in the diagnostic 
groups.
RESULTS: The left inferior parietal lobule (IPL)_6_5 (rostroventral area 39) 
showed the best ability to discriminate between patients with AD and those with 
CN (AUC = 0.688). The model consisting of the left IPL_6_4 (caudal area 40) and 
bilateral IPL_6_5 showed the best combination for predicting the CN progression 
to MCI. The left IPL_6_1 (caudal area 39) showed the best predictive power in 
predicting the progression of MCI to AD. Certain subregions of the volume 
correlated with cognitive scales.
CONCLUSION: Subregions of the angular gyrus are essential in the early onset and 
subsequent development of AD, and early detection of the volume of these regions 
may be useful in identifying the tendency to develop the disease and its 
treatment.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common central neurodegenerative disease disorder 
characterized primarily by cognitive impairment and non-cognitive 
neuropsychiatric symptoms that significantly impact patients' daily lives and 
behavioral functioning. The pathogenesis of AD remains unclear and current 
Western medicines treatment are purely symptomatic, with a singular pathway, 
limited efficacy, and substantial toxicity and side effects. In recent years, as 
research into AD has deepened, there has been a gradual increase in the 
exploration and application of medicinal plants for the treatment of AD. 
Numerous studies have shown that medicinal plants and their active ingredients 
can potentially mitigate AD by regulating various molecular mechanisms, 
including the production and aggregation of pathological proteins, oxidative 
stress, neuroinflammation, apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, neurogenesis, 
neurotransmission, and the brain-gut microbiota axis. In this review, we 
analyzed the pathogenesis of AD and comprehensively summarized recent 
advancements in research on medicinal plants for the treatment of AD, along with 
their underlying mechanisms and clinical evidence. Ultimately, we aimed to 
provide a reference for further investigation into the specific mechanisms 
through which medicinal plants prevent and treat AD, as well as for the 
identification of efficacious active ingredients derived from medicinal plants.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents an escalating global health crisis, 
constituting the leading cause of dementia among the elderly and profoundly 
impairing their quality of life. Current FDA-approved drugs, such as 
rivastigmine, donepezil, galantamine, and memantine, offer only modest 
symptomatic relief and are frequently associated with significant adverse 
effects. Faced with this challenge and in line with advances in the 
understanding of the pathophysiology of this neurodegenerative condition, 
various innovative therapeutic strategies have been explored. Here, we review 
novel approaches inspired by advanced knowledge of the underlying 
pathophysiological mechanisms of the disease. Among the therapeutic 
alternatives, immunotherapy stands out, employing monoclonal antibodies to 
specifically target and eliminate toxic proteins implicated in AD. Additionally, 
the use of medicinal plants is examined, as their synergistic effects among 
components may confer neuroprotective properties. The modulation of the gut 
microbiota is also addressed as a peripheral strategy that could influence 
neuroinflammatory and degenerative processes in the brain. Furthermore, the 
therapeutic potential of emerging approaches, such as the use of microRNAs to 
regulate key cellular processes and nanotherapy, which enables precise drug 
delivery to the central nervous system, is analyzed. Despite promising advances 
in these strategies, the incidence of Alzheimer's disease continues to rise. 
Therefore, it is proposed that achieving effective treatment in the future may 
require the integration of combined approaches, maximizing the synergistic 
effects of different therapeutic interventions.

Inhibition of Aβ Aggregation by Cholesterol-End-Modified PEG Vesicles and 
Micelles.

Background/Objectives: This study aimed to design and evaluate Chol-PEG2000 
micelles and Chol-PEG500 vesicles as drug delivery system (DDS) carriers and 
inhibitors of amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregation, a key factor in Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). Methods: The physical properties of Chol-PEG assemblies were characterized 
using dynamic light scattering (DLS), electrophoretic light scattering (ELS), 
and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Inhibitory effects on Aβ aggregation 
were assessed via thioflavin T (ThT) assay, circular dichroism (CD) 
spectroscopy, and native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (native-PAGE). 
Results: Chol-PEG2000 micelles and Chol-PEG500 vesicles were found to exhibit 
diameters of 20-30 nm and 70-80 nm, respectively, with neutral surface charges 
and those physical properties indicated the high affinity for Aβ. At a 10-fold 
molar ratio, thioflavin T (ThT) assay revealed that Chol-PEG2000 delayed Aβ 
fibril elongation by 20 hours, while Chol-PEG500 delayed it by 40 hours against 
Aβ peptide. At a 50-fold molar ratio, both Chol-PEG2000 and Chol-PEG500 
significantly inhibited Aβ aggregation, as indicated by minimal fluorescence 
intensity increases over 48 hours. CD spectroscopy indicated that Aβ maintained 
its random coil structure in the presence of Chol-PEG assemblies at a 50-fold 
molar ratio. Native-PAGE analysis demonstrated a retardation in Aβ migration 
immediately after mixing with Chol-PEG assemblies, suggesting complex formation. 
However, this retardation disappeared within 5 min, implying rapid dissociation 
of the complexes. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that Chol-PEG500 vesicles 
more effectively inhibit Aβ aggregation than Chol-PEG2000 micelles. Chol-PEG 
assemblies perform as DDS carriers to be capable of inhibiting Aβ aggregation. 
Chol-PEG assemblies can deliver additional therapeutics targeting other aspects 
of AD pathology. This dual-function platform shows promise as both a DDS carrier 
and a therapeutic agent, potentially contributing to a fundamental cure for AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by a 
gradual decline in cognitive function, for which few effective treatments exist. 
This study investigated the neuroprotective potential of Oroxylum indicum root 
extract and its key constituents (baicalein, chrysin, oroxylin A) against AD 
hallmarks. The extract and its constituents exhibited antioxidant activity in 
the DPPH assay. They inhibited β-amyloid aggregation as measured by the 
thioflavin T assay and acetylcholinesterase activity using the Ellman method. In 
cell culture models, O. indicum extract showed an ability to protect neurons 
from the toxic effects of H2O2. Western blot analysis revealed the extract and 
its major active component, baicalein, downregulated pro-apoptotic markers 
(cleaved caspase-3, and BAX) upon H2O2 exposure. Furthermore, they reduced the 
expression of amyloidogenic proteins (BACE1) and phosphorylated tau. These 
findings suggest that O. indicum root extract, particularly baicalein, possesses 
multifaceted neuroprotective properties, targeting various aspects of AD 
pathogenesis, including oxidative stress, cholinergic dysfunction, β-amyloid 
formation, aggregation, and apoptosis. O. indicum root thus warrants further 
investigation as a promising source of therapeutic agents for AD.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Dementia is not a single disease but an umbrella term 
that encompasses a range of symptoms, such as memory loss and cognitive 
impairments, which are severe enough to disrupt daily life. One of the most 
common forms of dementia is Alzheimer's Disease (AD), a complex 
neurodegenerative condition influenced by both genetic and environmental 
factors. Recent research has highlighted diet as a potential modifiable risk 
factor for AD. Decades of research have explored the role of dietary patterns, 
including the Mediterranean Diet (MD) and its components, in neuroprotection and 
cognitive health. Systematic review examines studies investigating the impact of 
the Mediterranean Diet, Mediterranean-like diets, the Nordic Diet (ND), dietary 
intake patterns, and specific components such as extra virgin olive oil and 
rapeseed oil on cognitive function, disease onset, and progression in AD and 
dementia.
METHODS: A comprehensive search of PubMed, the Directory of Open Access 
Journals, and the Social Science Research Network was conducted independently by 
two reviewers using predefined search terms. The search period included studies 
from 2006 to 2024. Eligible studies meeting the inclusion criteria were 
systematically reviewed, yielding 88 studies: 85 focused on the MD and its 
relationship to AD and dementia, while only 3 investigated the ND.
RESULTS: The findings suggest that adherence to the Mediterranean and Nordic 
diets is generally associated with improved cognitive function and delayed 
cognitive decline and that adherence to both these diets can improve cognitive 
function. Some studies identified that higher legume consumption decreased 
dementia incidence, while fruits and vegetables, carbohydrates, and eggs lowered 
dementia prevalence. Most studies demonstrated that high MD or ND adherence was 
associated with better cognitive function and a lower risk of poor cognition in 
comparison to individuals with lower MD or ND adherence. However, some studies 
reported no significant benefits of the MD on cognitive outcomes, while two 
studies indicated that higher red meat consumption was linked to better 
cognitive function.
CONCLUSION: Despite promising trends, the evidence remains varying across 
studies, underscoring the need for further research to establish definitive 
associations between diet and cognitive function. These findings highlight the 
essential role of dietary interventions in the prevention and management of 
dementia and AD, therefore offering critical insights into the underlying 
mechanisms by which the diet may impact brain health.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia among the elderly, yet 
effective treatments remain elusive. Total saikosaponins (TSS), the primary 
bioactive components in Bupleurum chinense, have shown promising therapeutic 
effects against AD in previous studies. Methods: To delve deeper into the 
mechanisms underlying the therapeutic role of TSS in AD, we investigated its 
neuroprotective effects and associated molecular mechanisms in APP/PS1 mice. 
Further, we employed metabolomic and proteomic analyses, with a focus on the 
potential protein-level changes induced by TSS, particularly those related to 
metabolite accumulation in the brain. Results: Our results showed that 
lysophosphatidylcholine, adenosine, and sphingomyelin in plasma might serve as 
potential biomarkers. Compared to the control group, AD mice exhibited 
significantly increased expression of proteins related to neuroinflammatory 
pathways, whereas proteins involved in cAMP signaling, cGMP-PKG signaling, and 
synaptic plasticity pathways were significantly downregulated. Notably, these 
signaling pathways were partially reversed in APP/PS1 mice following TSS 
administration. Behavioral tests demonstrated that TSS effectively improved the 
learning and memory functions of mice. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that 
TSS ameliorate cognitive decline through regulating neuroinflammatory pathways, 
cAMP and cGMP signaling, and synaptic plasticity pathways, providing insights 
into its therapeutic potential in AD.

Background: A water extract of the Ayurvedic plant Centella asiatica (L.) Urban, 
family Apiaceae (CAW), improves cognitive function in mouse models of aging and 
Alzheimer's disease and affects dendritic arborization, mitochondrial activity, 
and oxidative stress in mouse primary neurons. Triterpenes (TT) and 
caffeoylquinic acids (CQA) are constituents associated with these bioactivities 
of CAW, although little is known about how interactions between these compounds 
contribute to the plant's therapeutic benefit. Methods: Mouse primary cortical 
neurons were treated with CAW or equivalent concentrations of four TT combined, 
eight CQA combined, or these twelve compounds combined (TTCQA). Treatment 
effects on the cell transcriptome (18,491 genes) and metabolome (192 
metabolites) relative to vehicle control were evaluated using RNAseq and 
metabolomic analyses, respectively. Results: Extensive differentially expressed 
genes (DEGs) were seen with all treatments, as well as evidence of interactions 
between compounds. Notably, many DEGs seen with TT treatment were not observed 
in the TTCQA condition, possibly suggesting CQA reduced the effects of TT. 
Moreover, additional gene activity seen with CAW as compared to TTCQA indicates 
the presence of additional compounds in CAW that further modulate TTCQA 
interactions. Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA) identified 4 
gene co-expression modules altered by treatments that were associated with 
extracellular matrix organization, fatty acid metabolism, cellular response to 
stress and stimuli, and immune function. Compound interaction patterns were seen 
at the eigengene level in these modules. Interestingly, in metabolomics 
analysis, the TTCQA treatment saw the highest number of changes in individual 
metabolites (20), followed by CQA (15), then TT (8), and finally CAW (3). WGCNA 
analysis found two metabolomics modules with significant eigenmetabolite 
differences for TT and CQA and possible compound interactions at this level. 
Conclusions: Four gene expression modules and two metabolite modules were 
altered by the four treatment types applied. This methodology demonstrated the 
existence of both negative and positive interactions between TT, CQA, and 
additional compounds found in CAW on the transcriptome and metabolome of mouse 
primary cortical neurons.

In light of the demographic shift towards an aging population, there is an 
increasing prevalence of dementia among the elderly. The negative impact on 
mental health is preventing individuals from taking proper care of themselves. 
For individuals requiring hospital care, those receiving home care, or as a 
precaution for a specific individual, it is advantageous to utilize monitoring 
equipment to track their biological parameters on an ongoing basis. This 
equipment can minimize the risk of serious accidents or severe health hazards. 
The objective of the present research project is to design an armband with an 
accurate location tracking system. This is of particular importance for 
individuals with dementia and Alzheimer's disease, who frequently leave their 
homes and are unable to find their way back. The proposed armband also includes 
a fingerprint identification system that allows only authorized personnel to use 
it. Furthermore, in hospitals and healthcare facilities the biometric 
identification system can be used to trace periodic medical or nursing visits. 
This process improves the reliability and transparency of healthcare. The test 
results indicate that the armband functions in accordance with the desired 
design specifications, with performance evaluation of the main features 
including fall detection, where a hit rate of 100% was obtained, a fingerprint 
recognition test demonstrating accuracy from 88% to 100% on high-quality 
samples, and a GPS tracking test determining position with a difference of 
between 1.8 and 2.1 m. The proposed solution may be of benefit to healthcare 
professionals, supported housing providers, elderly people as target users, or 
their family members.

The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a crucial structure that maintains brain 
homeostasis by regulating the entry of molecules and cells from the bloodstream 
into the central nervous system (CNS). Neurodegenerative diseases such as 
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, as well as ischemic stroke, compromise the 
integrity of the BBB. This leads to increased permeability and the infiltration 
of harmful substances, thereby accelerating neurodegeneration. In this review, 
we explore the mechanisms underlying BBB disruption, including oxidative stress, 
neuroinflammation, vascular dysfunction, and the loss of tight junction 
integrity, in patients with neurodegenerative diseases. We discuss how BBB 
breakdown contributes to neuroinflammation, neurotoxicity, and the abnormal 
accumulation of pathological proteins, all of which exacerbate neuronal damage 
and facilitate disease progression. Furthermore, we discuss potential 
therapeutic strategies aimed at preserving or restoring BBB function, such as 
anti-inflammatory treatments, antioxidant therapies, and approaches to enhance 
tight junction integrity. Given the central role of the BBB in 
neurodegeneration, maintaining its integrity represents a promising therapeutic 
approach to slow or prevent the progression of neurodegenerative diseases.

Background/Objectives: The goal of this commentary is to highlight several key 
components of the inflammatory process as it relates to amyloid toxicity in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), including the role of neuroinflammatory factors and 
peripheral inflammatory events. Methods: Google Scholar and PubMed were used to 
find articles with the following keywords: Alzheimer's disease, amyloids, 
neuroinflammation, peripheral inflammation, microglia, cytokines, and 
treatments. Sources that were case reports, not peer-reviewed, or older than 30 
years were excluded. Abstracts were reviewed first for their relevance before 
the full text was considered. Methods sections were reviewed to ensure the 
interventional papers included were randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, 
or systematic reviews; however, several literature reviews were also included 
due to the relevance of their background information. Results: Based on the 
literature review, we chose to concentrate on microglia, cytokine signaling, and 
peripheral inflammation markers. We found that microglia activation and 
subsequent microglia-driven inflammation play a pivotal role in the 
pathomechanism of AD. Additionally, cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and 
tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) appear to contribute to amyloid accumulation 
and cell damage. Finally, the increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier 
(BBB) allows for the peripheral inflammatory process to contribute to the 
inflammation of the central nervous system (CNS) and amyloid-beta (Aβ) 
accumulation. Conclusions: Current evidence suggests that the immune system 
plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of AD, both in the CNS and the 
periphery.

Vitamin B1 (thiamine) plays an important role in human metabolism. It is 
essential for the proper growth and development of the body and has a positive 
effect on the functioning of the digestive, cardiovascular, and nervous systems. 
Additionally, it stimulates the brain and improves the psycho-emotional state. 
In vivo, vitamin B1 occurs in free form as thiamine or as its ester with 
phosphate residue(s), i.e., as mono-, di-, or triphosphate. It has been proven 
that supportive therapy with vitamin B1 can not only provide neuroprotection but 
also has a positive effect on advanced neurodegenerative diseases, such as 
Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, or 
Huntington's disease. This paper presents studies on the effect of free thiamine 
(T) and thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) on the activity of acetylcholinesterase 
(AChE), which is an enzyme considered to play an important role in the therapies 
for neurodegenerative diseases, especially Alzheimer's disease. The mechanisms 
of action of these compounds as potential inhibitors of AChE were evaluated 
using both experimental (enzymatic activity) as well as computational (molecular 
docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and MM-GBSA calculations) methods. The 
results of the current study indicate a non-competitive type of enzyme 
inhibition, in contrast to the previously published works suggesting a 
competitive one.

Alzheimer's disease is a challenge in modern healthcare due to its complex 
etiology and increasing prevalence. Despite advances, further understanding of 
Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology is needed, particularly the role of Aβ 
neurotoxic peptide. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) has shown 
potential as a screening tool for several pathologies, including Alzheimer's 
disease. Nonetheless, limited research has explored Aβ direct effects on neurons 
and extracellular vesicles metabolic profiles. Hence, this study aims to 
investigate Aβ impact on the spectroscopic profiles of neuronal-like cells (N2a) 
and N2a-derived extracellular vesicles, employing FTIR spectroscopy and focusing 
on the 1280-900 cm-1 region. A comprehensive analysis of spectral data was 
carried out, including multivariate partial least squares (PLS) analysis and 
peak intensities analysis. PLS analysis revealed moderate to strong correlations 
within this spectral region for both N2a and N2a-derived extracellular vesicles. 
The peak intensity analysis revealed additional peaks with significant 
differences in EVs' spectra relative to N2a, following Aβ treatment. 
Specifically, Aβ seems to cause alterations in protein phosphorylation and in 
the nucleic acids content of extracellular vesicles. These findings support that 
Aβ's role in Alzheimer's disease pathology may be mediated by extracellular 
vesicles and highlight FTIR's potential for advancing Alzheimer's disease 
research and clinical applications.

BACKGROUND: The ketogenic diet (KD), high in fat and low in carbohydrates, was 
introduced in the 1920s as a non-pharmacological treatment for refractory 
epilepsy. Although its mechanism of action is not fully understood, beneficial 
effects have been observed in neurological diseases such as epilepsy, 
Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease.
OBJECTIVE: This review examines the impact of the ketogenic diet and its 
molecular and neuroglial effects as a complementary therapy for neurological 
diseases.
DISCUSSION: KD is associated with neuroprotective and antioxidant effects that 
improve mitochondrial function, regulate neurotransmitter flow, and reduce 
neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. Glial cells play an essential role in 
the utilization of ketone bodies (KBs) within the central nervous system's 
metabolism, particularly during ketosis induced by the KD. Thus, the KD 
represents a broad and promising strategy that involves both neurons and glial 
cells, with a molecular impact on brain metabolism and neuroinflammatory 
homeostasis.
CONCLUSION: Multiple molecular mechanisms have been identified to explain the 
benefits of the KD in neurological diseases; however, further experimental and 
clinical studies are needed to address various molecular pathways in order to 
achieve conclusive results.

Ellagic Acid: A Green Multi-Target Weapon That Reduces Oxidative Stress and 
Inflammation to Prevent and Improve the Condition of Alzheimer's Disease.

Oxidative stress (OS), generated by the overrun of reactive species of oxygen 
and nitrogen (RONS), is the key cause of several human diseases. With 
inflammation, OS is responsible for the onset and development of clinical signs 
and the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is a 
multifactorial chronic neurodegenerative syndrome indicated by a form of 
progressive dementia associated with aging. While one-target drugs only soften 
its symptoms while generating drug resistance, multi-target polyphenols from 
fruits and vegetables, such as ellagitannins (ETs), ellagic acid (EA), and 
urolithins (UROs), having potent antioxidant and radical scavenging effects 
capable of counteracting OS, could be new green options to treat human 
degenerative diseases, thus representing hopeful alternatives and/or adjuvants 
to one-target drugs to ameliorate AD. Unfortunately, in vivo ETs are not 
absorbed, while providing mainly ellagic acid (EA), which, due to its trivial 
water-solubility and first-pass effect, metabolizes in the intestine to yield 
UROs, or irreversible binding to cellular DNA and proteins, which have very low 
bioavailability, thus failing as a therapeutic in vivo. Currently, only UROs 
have confirmed the beneficial effect demonstrated in vitro by reaching tissues 
to the extent necessary for therapeutic outcomes. Unfortunately, upon the 
administration of food rich in ETs or ETs and EA, URO formation is affected by 
extreme interindividual variability that renders them unreliable as novel 
clinically usable drugs. Significant attention has therefore been paid 
specifically to multitarget EA, which is incessantly investigated as such or 
nanotechnologically manipulated to be a potential "lead compound" with 
protective action toward AD. An overview of the multi-factorial and multi-target 
aspects that characterize AD and polyphenol activity, respectively, as well as 
the traditional and/or innovative clinical treatments available to treat AD, 
constitutes the opening of this work. Upon focus on the pathophysiology of OS 
and on EA's chemical features and mechanisms leading to its antioxidant 
activity, an all-around updated analysis of the current EA-rich foods and EA 
involvement in the field of AD is provided. The possible clinical usage of EA to 
treat AD is discussed, reporting results of its applications in vitro, in vivo, 
and during clinical trials. A critical view of the need for more extensive use 
of the most rapid diagnostic methods to detect AD from its early symptoms is 
also included in this work.

Interleukin (IL)-1β is a pro-inflammatory cytokine whose levels are increased in 
the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Despite the role of IL-1β in 
the pathology of AD, the fact that it is expressed at very low levels makes it a 
challenging cytokine to measure, hence limiting its potential use as a reliable 
biomarker. Moreover, being able to accurately and reliably measure the levels of 
IL-1 β in blood makes it possible to evaluate this cytokine as a potential 
biomarker of the inflammatory response in AD. In this study, we compared three 
quantification methodologies, Meso-Scale Discovery (MSD), both V-Plex and S-Plex 
versions, and Quanterix's SIMOA (Single-Molecule Array), to measure IL-1β in the 
serum of AD patients and age-matched controls. These assays are routinely used 
to measure IL-1β serum levels with high specificity and sensitivity in human AD 
patients, yet to the best of our knowledge, no study has compared all three 
techniques for their accuracy to measure IL-1β as biomarkers. Our findings 
indicate the two MSD assays can be used to measure IL-1β levels in AD and 
control serum, but the SIMOA assay showed the highest receiver operating 
characteristics (ROCs), with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9532, which can 
be compared to the AUC values for the V-Plex assay, 0.5660, and the S-Plex 
assay, 0.6632. Taken together, these data show that although all technologies 
are useful in the measurement of IL-1β in the blood, the SIMOA IL-1β 3.0 assay 
is more reliable and sensitive in measuring biomarkers of AD.

HERVs (Human endogenous retroviruses) are remnants of ancient exogenous 
retroviruses that have integrated into the human genome, particularly in 
germ-line cells. Among these, the envelope protein gene HERV-W env (Human 
endogenous retroviruses W family envelope protein), located on chromosome 7 and 
primarily expressed in the human placenta, has been closely linked to various 
neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, as well as autoimmune 
diseases and cancer. Recent studies have highlighted the abnormal expression of 
cytokines as a key factor in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Notably, 
elevated serum levels of IL-1β (interleukin 1 beta) in schizophrenia, a cytokine 
associated with inflammation, are a characteristic feature of pyroptosis-a form 
of pro-inflammatory programmed cell death. Although previous research has 
observed significant upregulation of pyroptosis-related genes such as CASP1 
(Caspase-1), NLRP3 (NLR family pyrin domain containing 3), and IL1B (interleukin 
1 beta) in the serum of schizophrenia patients, and extensive neuron pyroptosis 
has been documented in various neuropsychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer's 
disease, epilepsy, and multiple sclerosis, the occurrence of neuron pyroptosis 
in schizophrenia remains uncertain. Furthermore, the mechanisms underlying 
pyroptosis in schizophrenia and its potential connection with HERV-W env have 
yet to be fully elucidated. In this study, we found that the expression levels 
of pyroptosis-related genes, specifically CASP1, GSDMD (Gasdermin D), and IL1B, 
were significantly elevated in patients with schizophrenia compared to healthy 
controls. Furthermore, our analysis revealed a strong positive correlation 
between HERV-W env expression and the levels of CASP1/GSDMD/IL1B in these 
patients. Experimental evidence further demonstrated that HERV-W env promoted 
the activation of Caspase-1 and the cleavage of Gasdermin D, leading to 
increased release of LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) and IL-1β. Importantly, 
inhibitors targeting NLRP3, CASP1, and GSDMD significantly reduced the releases 
of LDH and IL-1β induced by HERV-W env, whereas BID (BH3 interacting domain 
death agonist) inhibitors did not have a notable effect. This suggests that 
HERV-W env induces CASP1-GSDMD-dependent pyroptosis through the 
NLRP3-CASP1-GSDMD signaling pathway. As pyroptosis is increasingly recognized 
for its connection to neurodegenerative diseases, this study provides insights 
into the molecular mechanisms of neuronal pyroptosis mediated by the NLRP3 
inflammasome in the context of HERV-W env. Additionally, it explores the 
potential facilitation of HERV-W env in the development of schizophrenia via 
pyroptosis, proposing that certain pyroptosis indicators could serve as 
potential biomarkers for schizophrenia. Based on our existing research results 
and the findings of previous researchers, we infer that HERV-W env acts as a 
bridge in the onset and progression of schizophrenia. Furthermore, HERV-W env 
may serve as a potential target for the clinical treatment of schizophrenia, 
suggesting that monoclonal antibody therapy targeting HERV-W env could represent 
a novel approach to managing this disease.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterised by progressive neurodegeneration with 
the formation of amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tau tangles in 
the brain parenchyma. The causes of AD have been attributed to a combination of 
age-related changes within the brain as well as genetic, environmental and 
lifestyle factors. However, a recent study by Banerjee et al. highlights the 
possibility that AD may be a transmissible disease and that iatrogenic AD could 
be environmentally acquired, similar to iatrogenic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease 
(iCJD). The study reports that contaminated Aβ in cadaver-derived pituitary 
growth hormone (c-hGH) therapy, which patients received during childhood 
inoculation, may accidentally transmit into their brains, triggering 
neurodegeneration and AD onset in older age. Furthermore, corroborating evidence 
from various animal model studies and human case reports suggests that AD can be 
potentially transmissible.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a leading cause of cognitive decline and 
mortality worldwide, characterized by neurodegeneration, synaptic deficiencies, 
and neuroinflammation. Despite advancements in early detection, diagnosis, and 
treatment, AD presents substantial challenges due to its complex pathology, 
heterogeneity, and the limited efficacy of current therapies. Consequently, 
there is a pressing need for novel therapeutic agents to target the multifaceted 
aspects of AD pathology, enhance current treatments, and minimize adverse 
effects. AdipoRon, an adiponectin receptor agonist, has garnered interest for 
its potential neuroprotective effects, including reducing neuroinflammation, 
improving mitochondrial function, and mitigating tau hyperphosphorylation. This 
review aimed to evaluate the effects of AdipoRon-based adiponectin replacement 
therapy against AD, using a comprehensive approach grounded in the PICO 
framework-Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcomes. A total of six 
studies were reviewed, including in vitro and in vivo investigations examining 
AdipoRon's impact on various AD models. These studies involved different cell 
lines and transgenic mouse models, assessing various outcomes such as cognitive 
function, neuroinflammation, tau phosphorylation, synaptic deficiencies, and 
relevant molecular pathways. By synthesizing data from these studies, our review 
thoroughly explains AdipoRon's neuroprotective effects, mechanisms of action, 
and potential as a therapeutic agent for AD. This analysis aims to highlight the 
current state of knowledge, identify gaps in the research, and suggest 
directions for future studies and clinical applications.

Iron Homeostasis Dysregulation, Oro-Gastrointestinal Microbial Inflammatory 
Factors, and Alzheimer's Disease: A Narrative Review.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is a progressive 
neurodegenerative disorder that profoundly impacts cognitive function and the 
nervous system. Emerging evidence highlights the pivotal roles of iron 
homeostasis dysregulation and microbial inflammatory factors in the oral and gut 
microbiome as potential contributors to the pathogenesis of AD. Iron homeostasis 
disruption can result in excessive intracellular iron accumulation, promoting 
the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative damage. 
Additionally, inflammatory agents produced by pathogenic bacteria may enter the 
body via two primary pathways: directly through the gut or indirectly via the 
oral cavity, entering the bloodstream and reaching the brain. This infiltration 
disrupts cellular homeostasis, induces neuroinflammation, and exacerbates 
AD-related pathology. Addressing these mechanisms through personalized treatment 
strategies that target the underlying causes of AD could play a critical role in 
preventing its onset and progression.

For decades, Alzheimer's Disease (AD) research has focused on the amyloid 
cascade hypothesis, which identifies amyloid-beta (Aβ) as the primary driver of 
the disease. However, the consistent failure of Aβ-targeted therapies to 
demonstrate efficacy, coupled with significant safety concerns, underscores the 
need to rethink our approach to AD treatment. Emerging evidence points to 
microbial infections as environmental factors in AD pathoetiology. Although a 
definitive causal link remains unestablished, the collective evidence is 
compelling. This review explores unconventional perspectives and emerging 
paradigms regarding microbial involvement in AD pathogenesis, emphasizing the 
gut-brain axis, brain biofilms, the oral microbiome, and viral infections. 
Transgenic mouse models show that gut microbiota dysregulation precedes brain Aβ 
accumulation, emphasizing gut-brain signaling pathways. Viral infections like 
Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 (HSV-1) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 
Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may lead to AD by modulating host processes like the 
immune system. Aβ peptide's antimicrobial function as a response to microbial 
infection might inadvertently promote AD. We discuss potential microbiome-based 
therapies as promising strategies for managing and potentially preventing AD 
progression. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) restores gut microbial 
balance, reduces Aβ accumulation, and improves cognition in preclinical models. 
Probiotics and prebiotics reduce neuroinflammation and Aβ plaques, while 
antiviral therapies targeting HSV-1 and vaccines like the shingles vaccine show 
potential to mitigate AD pathology. Developing effective treatments requires 
standardized methods to identify and measure microbial infections in AD 
patients, enabling personalized therapies that address individual microbial 
contributions to AD pathogenesis. Further research is needed to clarify the 
interactions between microbes and Aβ, explore bacterial and viral interplay, and 
understand their broader effects on host processes to translate these insights 
into clinical interventions.

Production of Amyloid-β in the Aβ-Protein-Precursor Proteolytic Pathway Is 
Discontinued or Severely Suppressed in Alzheimer's Disease-Affected Neurons: 
Contesting the 'Obvious'.

A notion of the continuous production of amyloid-β (Aβ) via the proteolysis of 
Aβ-protein-precursor (AβPP) in Alzheimer's disease (AD)-affected neurons 
constitutes both a cornerstone and an article of faith in the Alzheimer's 
research field. The present Perspective challenges this assumption. It analyses 
the relevant empirical data and reaches an unexpected conclusion, namely that in 
AD-afflicted neurons, the production of AβPP-derived Aβ is either discontinued 
or severely suppressed, a concept that, if proven, would fundamentally change 
our understanding of the disease. This suppression, effectively 
self-suppression, occurs in the context of the global inhibition of the cellular 
cap-dependent protein synthesis as a consequence of the neuronal integrated 
stress response (ISR) elicited by AβPP-derived intraneuronal Aβ (iAβ; hence 
self-suppression) upon reaching certain levels. Concurrently with the 
suppression of the AβPP proteolytic pathway, the neuronal ISR activates in human 
neurons, but not in mouse neurons, the powerful AD-driving pathway generating 
the C99 fragment of AβPP independently of AβPP. The present study describes 
molecular mechanisms potentially involved in these phenomena, propounds novel 
approaches to generate transgenic animal models of AD, advocates for the 
utilization of human neuronal cells-based models of the disease, makes 
verifiable predictions, suggests experiments designed to validate the proposed 
concept, and considers its potential research and therapeutic implications. 
Remarkably, it opens up the possibility that the conventional production of 
AβPP, BACE enzymes, and γ-secretase components is also suppressed under the 
neuronal ISR conditions in AD-affected neurons, resulting in the dyshomeostasis 
of AβPP. It follows that whereas conventional AD is triggered by AβPP-derived 
iAβ accumulated to the ISR-eliciting levels, the disease, in its both 
conventional and unconventional (triggered by the neuronal ISR-eliciting 
stressors distinct from iAβ) forms, is driven not (or not only) by iAβ produced 
in the AβPP-independent pathway, as we proposed previously, but mainly, possibly 
exclusively, by the C99 fragment generated independently of AβPP and not cleaved 
at the γ-site due to the neuronal ISR-caused deficiency of γ-secretase 
(apparently, the AD-driving "substance X" predicted in our previous study), a 
paradigm consistent with a dictum by George Perry that Aβ is "central but not 
causative" in AD. The proposed therapeutic strategies would not only deplete the 
driver of the disease and abrogate the AβPP-independent production of C99 but 
also reverse the neuronal ISR and ameliorate the AβPP dyshomeostasis, a 
potentially significant contributor to AD pathology.

Origanum majorana L., also known as sweet marjoram, is a plant with multiple 
uses, both in the culinary field and traditional medicine, because of its major 
antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and digestive properties. In this 
research, we focused on the effects of O. majorana essential oil (OmEO, at 
concentrations of 25, 150, and 300 μL/L), evaluating chemical structure as well 
as its impact on cognitive performance and oxidative stress, in both naive 
zebrafish (Danio rerio), as well as in a scopolamine-induced amnesic model 
(SCOP, 100 μM). The fish behavior was analyzed in a novel tank-diving test 
(NTT), a Y-maze test, and a novel object recognition (NOR) test. We also 
investigated acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and the brain's oxidative 
stress status. In parallel, we performed in silico predictions (research 
conducted using computational models) of the pharmacokinetic properties of the 
main compounds identified in OmEO, using platforms such as SwissADME, pKCSM, 
ADMETlab 2.0, and ProTox-II. The results revealed that the major compounds were 
trans-sabinene hydrate (36.11%), terpinen-4-ol (17.97%), linalyl acetate 
(9.18%), caryophyllene oxide (8.25%), and α-terpineol (6.17%). OmEO can enhance 
memory through AChE inhibition, reduce SCOP-induced anxiety by increasing the 
time spent in the top zone in the NTT, and significantly reduce oxidative stress 
markers. These findings underscore the potential of using O. majorana to improve 
memory impairment and reduce oxidative stress associated with cognitive 
disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Neurodegenerative diseases are currently among the most devastating diseases 
with no effective disease-modifying drugs in the market, with Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) being the most prevalent. AD is a complex multifactorial 
neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive and severe cognitive 
impairment and memory loss. It is the most common cause of progressive memory 
loss (dementia) in the elderly, and to date, there is no effective treatment to 
cure or slow disease progression substantially. The role of adrenergic receptors 
in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies is poorly 
understood or investigated. Recently, some studies indicated a potential benefit 
of drugs acting on the adrenergic receptors for AD and dementias, although due 
to the heterogeneity of the drug classes used, the results on the whole remain 
inconclusive. The scope of this review article is to comprehensively review the 
literature on the possible role of adrenergic receptors in neurodegenerative 
diseases, stemming from the use of agonists and antagonists including 
antihypertensive and asthma drugs acting on the adrenergic receptors, but also 
from animal models and in vitro models where these receptors have been studied. 
Ultimately, we hope to obtain a better understanding of the role of these 
receptors, identify the gaps in knowledge, and explore the possibility of 
repurposing such drugs for AD, given their long history of use and safety.

Aromatic plants are rich sources of essential oils (EOs), recognized for their 
therapeutic properties due to their diversity of phytochemicals. This study 
investigated the anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of Myrcia sylvatica 
essential oil (MsEO) through inhalation in an animal model and its in vitro 
anticholinesterase (AChE) activity. The EO was obtained by hydrodistillation, 
and its volatile constituents were analyzed by GC-MS. Swiss mice were exposed to 
doses of 0.1%, 1%, and 2% of the EO via an inhalation apparatus. The anxiolytic 
activity was assessed using the elevated plus maze and light-dark box tests, 
while antidepressant activity was evaluated using the tail suspension and forced 
swimming tests. To examine potential side effects, the animals were subjected to 
rotarod, Y-maze, and Morris water maze tests to assess motor coordination, 
memory, and learning. Anticholinesterase activity was determined by direct 
bioautography and colorimetry based on the Ellman method. The results 
demonstrated that inhalation of MsEO at doses of 0.1% and 1% significantly 
reduced anxiety and depressive-like behaviors without impairing memory, 
learning, or motor coordination in the animals. Moreover, MsEO inhibited 
acetylcholinesterase with an IC50 of 0.47 μg/mL. These findings suggest that 
MsEO has potential therapeutic applications for anxiety and depression 
disorders, with additional anticholinesterase activity warranting further 
investigation in cognitive-related conditions.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized 
by extracellular amyloid plaques, predominantly consisting of amyloid-β (Aβ) 
peptides. The oligomeric form of Aβ is acknowledged as the most neurotoxic, 
propelling the pathological progression of AD. Interestingly, besides Aβ, other 
proteins are co-localized within amyloid plaques. Peptide analogs corresponding 
to the "aggregation-prone" regions (APRs) of these proteins could exhibit 
high-affinity binding to Aβ and significant inhibitory potential against the Aβ 
oligomerization process. The peptide analogs of co-localized protease, Cathepsin 
B, may act as such potent inhibitors. In silico studies on the complexes of the 
oligomeric state of Aβ and Cathepsin B peptide analogs were performed utilizing 
molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations, revealing that these 
analogs disrupt the β-sheet-rich core of Aβ oligomers, a critical structural 
feature of their stability. Of the four peptide analogs evaluated, two 
demonstrated considerable potential by effectively destabilizing oligomers while 
maintaining low self-aggregation propensity, i.e., a crucial consideration for 
therapeutic safety. These findings point out the potential of APR-derived 
peptide analogs from co-localized proteins as innovative agents against AD, 
paving the way for further exploration in peptide-based therapeutic development.

Vascular dementia (VaD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition prevalent 
among elderly adults marked by cognitive decline resulting from injured and/or 
improperly functioning cerebrovasculature with resultant disruptions in cerebral 
blood flow. Currently, VaD has no specific therapeutics and the exact 
pathobiology is still being investigated. VaD has been shown to develop when 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) form from damaged targets at different levels of 
organization-mitochondria, endothelial cells, or cerebrovasculature. In this 
review, we highlight how specific ROS molecules may be important in the 
development of VaD and how they can be targeted as a potential therapeutic for 
VaD.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Heparan sulfate (HS) is a polysaccharide that is found on 
the surface of cells and has various biological functions in the body.
METHODS: The purpose of this study was to predict the pharmacological effects 
and molecular mechanisms of HS on Alzheimer's disease (AD) and neuroinflammation 
(NI) through a network pharmacology analysis and to experimentally verify them.
RESULTS: We performed functional enrichment analysis of common genes between HS 
target genes and AD-NI gene sets and obtained items such as the 
"Cytokine-Mediated Signaling Pathway", "Positive Regulation Of MAPK Cascade", 
and "MAPK signaling pathway". To confirm the predicted results, the 
anti-inflammatory effect of HS was investigated using lipopolysaccharide 
(LPS)-stimulated BV2 microglia cells. HS inhibited the production of nittic 
oxide, interleukin (IL)-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α in LPS-stimulated BV2 
cells, but not IL-1β. In addition, HS inactivated P38 in the MAPK signaling 
pathway.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest the potential for HS to become a new 
treatment for AD and NI.

Despite the massive efforts of modern medicine to stop the evolution of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), it affects an increasing number of people, changing 
individual lives and imposing itself as a burden on families and the health 
systems. Considering that the vast majority of conventional drug therapies did 
not lead to the expected results, this review will discuss the newly developing 
therapies as an alternative in the effort to stop or slow AD. Focused Ultrasound 
(FUS) and its derived Transcranial Pulse Stimulation (TPS) are non-invasive 
therapeutic approaches. Singly or as an applied technique to change the 
permeability of the blood-brain-barrier (BBB), FUS and TPS have demonstrated the 
benefits of use in treating AD in animal and human studies. Adipose-derived stem 
Cells (ADSCs), gene therapy, and many other alternative methods (diet, sleep 
pattern, physical exercise, nanoparticle delivery) are also new potential 
treatments since multimodal approaches represent the modern trend in this 
disorder research therapies.

The human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) are ancient exogenous retroviruses 
that were embedded in the germline over 30 million years ago and underwent an 
endogenization process. They make up roughly 8% of the human genome. HERVs 
exhibit many physiological and non-physiological functions; for example, they 
play a role in the development of many diseases. They have been shown to affect 
carcinogenesis by modifying the expression of host genes through their functions 
as enhancers and promoters. Additionally, some molecules derived from HERVs may 
stimulate the immune system. Recently research has been focused on the effect of 
human endogenous retroviruses on the development of neurodegenerative diseases, 
including Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is the most common cause of dementia. 
AD is also linked to a significant deterioration in quality of life. The article 
aims to highlight the potential role of HERVs in neurodegenerative diseases such 
as Alzheimer's disease and senescence. Moreover, it is estimated that HERVs may 
be potential targets for diagnosis and therapy of AD.

Preeclampsia (preE) is a severe multisystem hypertensive syndrome of pregnancy 
associated with ischemia/hypoxia, angiogenic imbalance, apolipoprotein E 
(ApoE)-mediated dyslipidemia, placental insufficiency, and inflammation at the 
maternal-fetal interface. Our recent data further suggest that preE is 
associated with impaired autophagy, vascular dysfunction, and 
proteinopathy/tauopathy disorder, similar to neurodegenerative diseases such as 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), including the presence of the cis stereo-isoform of 
phosphorylated tau (cis P-tau), amyloid-β, and transthyretin in the placenta and 
circulation. This review provides an overview of the factors that may lead to 
the induction and accumulation of cis P-tau-like proteins by focusing on the 
inactivation of peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (Pin1) that catalyzes the 
cis to trans isomerization of P-tau. We also highlighted the novel role of the 
Pin1-cis P-tau-ApoE axis in the development of preE, and propagation of cis 
P-tau-mediated abnormal protein aggregation (tauopathy) from the placenta to 
cerebral tissues later in life, leading to neurodegenerative conditions. In the 
case of preE, proteinopathy/tauopathy may interrupt trophoblast differentiation 
and induce cell death, similar to the events occurring in neurons. These events 
may eventually damage the endothelium and cause systemic features of disorders 
such as preE. Despite impressive research and therapeutic advances in both 
fields of preE and neurodegenerative diseases, further investigation of Pin1-cis 
P-tau and ApoE-related mechanistic underpinnings may unravel novel therapeutic 
options, and new transcriptional and proteomic markers. This review will also 
cover genetic polymorphisms in the ApoE alleles leading to dyslipidemia 
induction that may regulate the pathways causing preE or dementia-like features 
in the reproductive age or later in life, respectively.

Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by profound differences between 
females and males in terms of incidence, clinical presentation, and disease 
progression. Furthermore, there is evidence suggesting that differences in 
sensitivity to medical treatments may exist between the two sexes. Although the 
role of sex hormones and sex chromosomes in driving differential susceptibility 
to these diseases is well-established, the molecular alterations underlying 
these differences remain poorly understood. Epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA 
methylation, histone tail modifications, and the activity of non-coding RNAs, 
are strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. While 
it is known that epigenetic mechanisms play a crucial role in sexual 
differentiation and that distinct epigenetic patterns characterize females and 
males, sex-specific epigenetic patterns have been largely overlooked in studies 
aiming to identify epigenetic alterations associated with neurodegenerative 
diseases. This review aims to provide an overview of sex differences in 
epigenetic mechanisms, the role of sex-specific epigenetic processes in the 
central nervous system, and the main evidence of sex-specific epigenetic 
alterations in three neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, 
Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Understanding the 
sex-related differences of these diseases is essential for developing 
personalized treatments and interventions that account for the unique epigenetic 
landscapes of each sex.

Objective: The objective of this study was to assess clinical decision-making 
associated with the use of a multi-analyte blood biomarker (BBM) test among 
patients presenting with signs or symptoms of mild cognitive impairment or 
dementia. Methods: The Quality Improvement PrecivityAD2 (QUIP II) Clinician 
Survey (NCT06025877) study evaluated the clinical utility of the PrecivityAD2™ 
blood test in a prospective, single cohort of 203 patients presenting with 
symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) or other causes of cognitive decline across 
12 memory specialists. The PrecivityAD2 blood test (C2N Diagnostics, St. Louis, 
MO) combines the plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio and the p-tau217/np-tau217 ratio 
(%p-tau217) measurements in a statistical algorithm to yield an Amyloid 
Probability Score 2 (APS2) that informs on the likelihood of brain amyloid 
plaques. After receiving the BBM test results, clinicians completed surveys on 
management strategies for each patient. Results: Patients had a median age of 
74, 53% were female, and 28% were traditionally under-represented in Black, 
Hispanic, and Asian groups. The composite primary endpoint, defined as a change 
in AD diagnostic certainty, drug therapy, or additional brain amyloid evaluation 
pre- and post-BBM testing, was 75% (p < 0.0001 versus the pre-specified 
threshold of 20% clinically meaningful change). Anti-AD medication orders 
decreased among negative APS2 patients and increased among positive APS2 
patients (p < 0.0001). Additional brain amyloid testing decreased among negative 
APS2 patients (p < 0.0001). Conclusions: This blood biomarker test can help 
memory specialists guide patients to anti-AD therapies as well as rule out AD to 
allow for other diagnostic considerations.

OBJECTIVE: Plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein (pGFAP) and plasma 
neurofilament light chain (pNfL) levels reflect astrocyte activation and 
neuronal damage, respectively. Whether these phenomena play a role in migraine 
is unknown. This study aimed to compare pGFAP and pNfL levels in patients with 
chronic migraine (CM) and age-matched controls and to analyze their relation 
with clinical features.
METHODS: The study evaluated two independent cohorts of patients, including in 
total 58 CM and 69 controls. pGFAP and pNfL were quantified with single molecule 
array (Simoa) technology. Demographic and clinical data were collected for each 
subject; differences in NfL/GFAP levels between CM and controls were evaluated 
in analyses adjusted for the effect of age and sex; clinical characteristics 
associated with NfL/GFAP levels were separately evaluated in the two cohorts.
RESULTS: In both cohorts, we did not find a significant difference in pGFAP or 
pNFL levels between CM and matched controls. The study did not find any 
correlation between pGFAP or pNfL levels and any migraine characteristics 
(namely presence of migraine aura, attack frequency, migraine intensity, years 
of disease).
CONCLUSIONS: Our negative results support the assumption that migraine 
represents a benign condition, characterized by transient functional brain 
alterations and not by the accumulation over time of neuroaxonal damage and/or 
associated astrocyte activation detectable by neurodegeneration marker proteins.

body's systems. Its positive impact spans the physical, mental and emotional 
realms, fostering harmony and well-being. Through a combination of postures, 
breathing techniques and meditation, yoga offers profound effects, enhancing 
flexibility, strength and balance while simultaneously promoting relaxation and 
reducing stress. This integrative approach not only cultivates physical 
resilience but also supports mental clarity, emotional balance and overall 
vitality, showcasing yoga as a comprehensive and impactful system for holistic 
health. The review delved into the multifaceted ways in which yoga exerts a 
positive influence on the body's various systems. It highlights how yoga serves 
as a beneficial tool in addressing and counteracting the underlying factors 
associated with different diseases. By examining yoga's effects on these systems 
and its potential in combating illness, the paper sheds light on the 
comprehensive therapeutic benefits that yoga offers. Please cite this article

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to explore the experiences and 
viewpoints of professional family caregivers in the management of behavioural 
and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSDs) to identify the ecopsychosocial 
strategies applied by them.
DESIGN: Qualitative study.
SETTING: Kerman, Iran.
PARTICIPANTS: Stories were collected from 40 professional family caregivers of 
dementia patients.
MEASUREMENT: The guidelines of the National Consensus Project (NCP) of the USA 
served as the conceptual framework for the deductive thematic analysis of our 
qualitative data. A schematic of the entire process was performed in five steps.
RESULTS: 30 stories relevant to the aim of this study were included in the 
analysis from April to June 2021. A majority of the stories were written by 
female caregivers. We identified 19 ecopsychosocial interventions, which covered 
the NCP dimensions except 'Care of the patient nearing the end of life'. More 
than half of these interventions were classified into psychological/psychiatric 
and physical aspects of care (57.8%). In addition to the care/support provided 
by special care units or home care, some caregivers believe that support from 
the government, various care organisations, social media and even other family 
members/friends is necessary to better manage BPSDs.
CONCLUSION: Despite limitations, such as having a small sample size and 
analysing only one story from each caregiver, our results indicate that dementia 
caregivers need more educational and cultural support in their ecopsychosocial 
strategies. Government involvement would yield more positive outcomes in 
managing BPSDs.

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection have been closely associated with 
several extra-gastrointestinal disorders. Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), as 
lipid-membrane-bounded nanoparticles, are usually shed from Gram-negative both 
in vitro and in vivo. H. pylori is also capable of producing OMVs, which can 
enter the systemic circulation and be delivered to various cells, tissues or 
organs, eliciting a range of inflammatory and immune modulation responses. In 
this current review, we summarize the biogenesis and functions of H. pylori 
OMVs, describe the contribution of H. pylori OMVs to the generation and 
progression of extra-gastrointestinal diseases, such as neuronal damage, 
Alzheimer disease, hepatic fibrosis and atherosclerosis. We also explored the 
effect of H. pylori OMVs in inflammatory and immune modulation of diverse immune 
cells, including macrophages, mononuclear cells and dendritic cells. By 
elucidating the molecular mechanism of H. pylori OMVs-mediated 
extra-gastrointestinal diseases and immunomodulatory effect, it may promote the 
development of efficient treatments and vaccinations against H. pylori.

Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are 
more prevalent in males than females. Furthermore, they typically showed 
abnormally high delta (< 4 Hz) and low alpha (8-10 Hz) rhythms from 
resting-state electroencephalographic (rsEEG) activity. Here, we hypothesized 
that those abnormalities may depend on the patient's sex. An international 
database provided clinical-demographic-rsEEG datasets for cognitively unimpaired 
older (Healthy; N = 49; 24 females), PDD (N = 39; 13 females), and DLB (N = 38; 
15 females) participants. Each group was stratified into matched female and male 
subgroups. The rsEEG rhythms were investigated across the individual rsEEG 
delta, theta, and alpha frequency bands based on the individual alpha frequency 
peak. The eLORETA freeware was used to estimate cortical rsEEG sources. In the 
Healthy group, widespread rsEEG alpha source activities were greater in the 
females than in the males. In the PDD group, widespread rsEEG delta source 
activities were lower and widespread rsEEG alpha source activities were greater 
in the females than in the males. In the DLB group, central-parietal rsEEG delta 
source activities were lower, and posterior rsEEG alpha source activities were 
greater in the females than in the males. These results suggest sex-dependent 
hormonal modulation of neuroprotective-compensatory neurophysiological 
mechanisms in PDD and DLB patients underlying the generation of rsEEG delta and 
alpha rhythms, which should be considered in the treatment of vigilance 
dysregulation in those patients.

BACKGROUND: Neural autoantibodies are being increasingly detected in conjunction 
with neurodegenerative dementias such as Alzheimer's disease dementia (AD), yet 
their significance is not well clarified. In this case report, we report the 
previously unreported long-lasting persistence of potassium voltage-gated 
channel subfamily A member 2 (KCNA2) antibodies in biomarker-supported AD.
METHODS: We report on a 77-year-old, male patient evaluated in our outpatient 
memory clinic of the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University 
Medical Center Göttingen. Neuropsychological test results and autoantibody 
testing in serum over a period of 4-5 years is provided.
REPORT: Our patient exhibited mild dementia syndrome and was diagnosed with AD 
on the basis of a prototypical biomarker profile (reduced Aβ42/40 ratio and 
elevated p-tau181 protein in cerebrospinal fluid). Within a 5-year follow-up 
with regular visits to our memory clinic, we observed a nearly stable 
neuropsychological profile of mild, amnestic variant dementia that did not 
noticeably progress. KCNA2 autoantibodies were also detectable in serum over 4 
years with increasing titers over time. Combined anti-dementia therapy with 
donepezil, multimodal therapy including non-pharmacological cognitive therapy, 
and immunotherapy with intravenous methylprednisolone was carried out as an 
individual treatment approach.
CONCLUSIONS: KCNA2 autoantibody persistence in biomarker-supported AD does not 
necessarily trigger a poor outcome in the long-term, as cognitive impairment did 
not progress subsequently. At the same time, mild immunotherapy did not result 
in less immunoreactivity in conjunction with the detection of KCNA2 
autoantibodies. This detection of KCNA2 autoantibodies in AD could provide 
indices of a potentially benign long-term AD course that should be further 
evaluated in studies.

The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor family caspase 
recruitment domain containing 4 (NLRC4) inflammasome, a vital component of the 
innate immune system, is known for defending against bacterial infections. 
However, recent insights have revealed its significant impact on neurological 
disorders. This comprehensive review discussed the mechanisms underlying the 
activation and regulation of the NLRC4 inflammasome, highlighting the complexity 
of its response to cellular stress and damage signals. The biological functions 
of NLRC4 were explored, particularly its influence on cytokine production and 
the induction of pyroptosis, a form of inflammatory cell death. This review 
further emphasized the role of the NLRC4 inflammasome in brain injuries and 
neurodegenerative disorders. In the realm of brain injuries such as stroke and 
traumatic brain injury, as well as in neurodegenerative diseases including 
Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis, the NLRC4 inflammasome played a pivotal role in modulating 
neuroinflammatory responses, which was crucial for understanding the progression 
and potential therapeutic targeting of these conditions. The emerging role of 
NLRC4 in psychiatric disorders and its potential impact on glioma progression 
were also examined. Additionally, this review presented a thorough summary of 
the latest research on inhibitors that impeded the assembly and activation of 
the NLRC4 inflammasome, pointing to new therapeutic possibilities in 
neurological disorders. In conclusion, by integrating current knowledge on the 
activation and regulation of NLRC4 with its biological functions and clinical 
implications, this article underscored the importance of NLRC4 inflammasome in 
neurological pathologies, which opened new possibilities for the treatment of 
challenging neurological conditions.

BACKGROUND: We investigated whether plasma β-hydroxybutyrate levels, a genetic 
risk score for Alzheimer's disease, and their interaction are associated with 
incident Alzheimer's disease.
METHODS: Using data from the UK Biobank-a population-based cohort study of 
adults aged 40-69 years, we assessed associations between baseline plasma 
β-hydroxybutyrate level, genetic risk score for Alzheimer's disease, and 
incident Alzheimer's disease. Incident Alzheimer's disease data were collected 
through linked data from hospital admissions and death registries.
RESULTS: In total, 261,933 adults were included, 1978 of whom developed incident 
Alzheimer's disease. Plasma β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations were not 
independently associated with Alzheimer's disease incidence after adjusting for 
covariates, whereas a higher genetic predisposition was linked to increased 
Alzheimer's disease incidence. Interactions were observed between plasma 
β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations and genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease on 
Alzheimer's disease incidence (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Further studies are warranted to elucidate the impact of plasma 
β-hydroxybutyrate status on Alzheimer's disease incidence.
