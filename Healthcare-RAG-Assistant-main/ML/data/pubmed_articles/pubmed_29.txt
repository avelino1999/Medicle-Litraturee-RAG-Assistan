The abnormal aggregation of amyloid β-protein (Aβ) and resultant neuronal damage 
are central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Accumulating evidence 
suggests that neuronal cell membranes play a pivotal role in Aβ 
self-aggregation. We have shown that fibrils formed by Aβ-(1-40) and Aβ-(1-42) 
on GM1-containing model membranes (M-fibrils) as well as on neuronal cell 
membranes (C-fibrils) are more toxic compared with fibrils formed in water 
(W-fibrils), and that Aβ-(1-40) M-fibrils contain both in-register parallel and 
2-residue-shifted antiparallel β-sheets. However, structural information on 
C-fibrils is lacking. In this study, structural changes of Aβ fibrils on living 
neuronal cells were detected by Fourier-transform infrared attenuated total 
reflection spectroscopy. Early Aβ-(1-40) C-fibrils contained antiparallel 
β-sheet structures, which changed to parallel β-sheet structures similar to 
W-fibrils as the fibril deposition proceeded. Pulse-chase experiments using two 
fluorescent-labeled Aβs suggested that these structural transitions occurred 
continuously from the existing fibrils. Considering the fact that Aβ fibrils 
start to form on the cell surface and extend into the aqueous phase, such 
environmental changes around fibrils may be coupled with structural alterations. 
In contrast, Aβ-(1-42) C-fibrils retained their antiparallel β-sheet structures. 
For both Aβ-(1-40) and Aβ-(1-42), cell viability continued to decrease even 
during the structural alterations of Aβ-(1-40), indicating that the antiparallel 
β-sheet-containing fibrils attaching to the cell surface were responsible for 
the lasting cytotoxicity. Thus, the antiparallel β-sheet-containing early 
fibrils are a promising target for anti-Aβ therapy.

OBJECTIVES: Simple reminiscence has been used as a non-pharmacological strategy 
to improve emotional well-being and adaptation in older adults, particularly 
those with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease. This study 
examined the effects of a simple reminiscence-based intervention on different 
reminiscence functions in this population.
METHODS: 113 participants were randomly assigned to an experimental (n = 61) or 
control group (n = 52). The experimental group received 16 reminiscence sessions 
over eight weeks. Assessments occurred pre-, post-intervention, and at 
follow-up. The eight subscales of the Reminiscence Functions Scale served as the 
study's primary outcome variables. Intervention effects were analyzed using 
2 × 3 mixed ANOVAs (group × time).
RESULTS: The results showed significant improvements in adaptive reminiscence 
functions, including identity, problem-solving, and preparation for death, as 
well as in the prosocial functions of conversation and teaching/informing in the 
experimental group compared to the control group.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that simple reminiscence can be an effective 
strategy for preserving and enhancing adaptive reminiscence functions in older 
adults with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease. Clinical 
Implications: This intervention can be integrated into routine care for 
individuals with cognitive impairment, helping maintain emotional-cognitive 
functioning and improve quality of life.

Fluorescence Lifetime-Based FRET Biosensors for Monitoring N Terminal 
Domain-Dependent Interactions of TDP-43 in Living Cells: A Novel Approach for 
ALS and FTD Drug Discovery.

Pathological aggregates of TDP-43 are implicated in Alzheimer's disease, 
frontotemporal dementia, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. While therapeutic 
efforts have traditionally focused on mitigating end-stage TDP-43 aggregation, 
recent evidence highlights an upstream and potentially targetable event: the 
loss of functional nuclear TDP-43 multimers due to disrupted N-terminal domain 
(NTD) interactions. To address this, we developed fluorescence lifetime 
(FLT)-based FRET biosensors to monitor TDP-43 multimerization in living cells 
that couple a full-length TDP-43 FLT-FRET biosensor screen with an NTD-deletion 
counter screen, forming the foundation of a novel high-throughput screening 
(HTS) platform. Screening the 2682 compound FDA-approved Selleck library, we 
identified the small molecule ketoconazole, which stabilizes functional nuclear 
TDP-43 multimers in an NTD-dependent manner with low micromolar potency. 
Ketoconazole rescues TDP-43 mislocalization and aggregation, restores SREBP2 
mRNA levels under TDP-43 overexpression, improves neuronal health, and partially 
restores motor function in a TDP-43 C. elegans model. These findings establish 
both the biosensors and the HTS platform as innovative tools for TDP-43 drug 
discovery and support an exciting translational approach for targeting TDP-43 
proteinopathies.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents the most common manifestation of dementia. 
Cerebrovascular dysfunction constitutes one of the initial events in the 
pathogenic process of AD. Recently, our research group has reported that 
artemether, a first-line antimalarial drug approved by the FDA, exhibits a 
neuroprotective property. Nevertheless, the impact of artemether on 
cerebrovascular dysfunction, along with its underlying mechanisms, still awaits 
comprehensive elucidation. This study systematically investigated the 
neuroprotective effects of artemether against Aβ1-42-induced injury in brain 
microvascular endothelial cells and explored the underlying molecular 
mechanisms. Our findings demonstrate that artemether potently mitigates 
Aβ1-42-mediated cytotoxicity and endothelial barrier dysfunction in mouse brain 
microvascular endothelial cells. Moreover, artemether attenuated blood-brain 
barrier disruption by upregulating tight junction proteins OCLN, CLDN-5, and 
ZO-1. Further studies revealed that artemether treatment improved elevated ROS 
levels, the dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential, and the decrease of 
ATP content. Immunoblotting analysis demonstrated that artemether stimulated the 
CAMKK2-AMPK kinase and its downstream target PGC1α. In addition, the blockage of 
the CAMKK2/AMPK/PGC1α pathway by inhibitor STO-609, Compound C, or knocking down 
the expression level of PGC1α with sgRNA significantly attenuated the 
neuroprotective activity of artemether. These results indicate the essential 
role of the CAMKK2/AMPK/PGC1α pathway in the protective effect of artemether in 
mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells. Similar results were obtained in 
Aβ1-42-treated human brain microvascular endothelial cells. In the AD mice 
model, we found that artemether treatment increased the expression level of 
ZO-1, CLDN-5, and OCLN of the AD mice model. Collectively, these findings 
demonstrate that artemether exerts neuroprotection against Aβ1-42-induced injury 
in brain microvascular endothelial cells through activation of the 
CAMKK2/AMPK/PGC1α signaling axis, which supports the protective effect of 
artemether in the prevention and treatment of AD through improving 
cerebrovascular dysfunction.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterised by dementia and neuronal damage. AD is a multifactorial disease, 
and the established treatments provide symptomatic relief and fail to address 
the underlying causes. The prior reports suggested that quercetin possesses 
potent anti-amyloidogenic properties. Quercetin's therapeutic potential is 
limited by poor solubility, lower bioavailability, and restricted permeation 
into the brain. In the current investigation, quercetin-loaded nanostructured 
lipid carriers (QC-NLCs) were prepared using an emulsification method using 
lecithin, sunflower oil, and cremophor RH 80. The key parameters, such as 
particle size and zeta potential, which influence the neuronal cell uptake and 
brain target, were measured, and physicochemical properties were determined. The 
QC-NLCS exhibited a particle size of ~ 89.68 ± 5.16 nm, a polydispersity index 
(PDI) of ~ 0.313 ± 0.01, a zeta potential of - 29.5 ± 4.8 mV, and 91.4 ± 2.1% 
entrapment efficiency. FT-IR, DSC, XRD, and TEM analysis confirmed the 
successful formation of QC-NLCs. Further, in vitro studies demonstrated the 
efficacy of QC-NLCS on cellular uptake, inhibition of Aβ accumulation, and BBB 
permeability. The comparative results of pharmacodynamic analysis involved 
behavioural assessment, which suggested improved cognition and spatial learning 
by QC-NLCS on STZ-treated rats. In vivo studies revealed a significant 
augmentation in SOD, GSH, total antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory cytokine 
levels, along with significant declination in MDA, AChE, Aβ accumulation, and 
pro-inflammatory cytokine levels after treatment with QC-NLCs. From the 
observations of the present study, QC-NLCs may offer an alternative targeted 
drug delivery system for addressing the pathological hallmarks associated with 
AD.

Having osteoporosis significantly increases the risk of having dementia, 
particularly when combined with smoking and diabetes, but regular exercise can 
reduce this risk. Implementing a national health screening program is crucial 
for early detection of these modifiable risk factors and prevention of dementia 
in aging populations.
PURPOSE: To assess osteoporosis as a risk factor for dementia in the general 
population using nationwide dataset.
METHODS: This study included 261,343 women aged 66 years who participated in the 
National Screening Program for Transitional Ages for Koreans and underwent their 
first medical checkup between January 2013 and December 2016. Participants were 
categorized into three groups based on bone mineral density (BMD): normal BMD, 
osteopenia, and osteoporosis. We investigated participants' demographic 
characteristics and chronic comorbidities that could affect dementia incidence. 
The hazard ratios (HRs) for dementia in individuals with osteoporosis and 
osteopenia were calculated and adjusted based on several risk factors.
RESULTS: Despite adjusting for demographic characteristics and chronic 
comorbidities, the risk of dementia was 1.18-fold higher in the osteoporosis 
group than in the normal BMD group. Regarding Alzheimer's disease and vascular 
dementia, the risk was 1.18- and 1.25-fold higher in the osteoporosis group, 
respectively. Notably, participants with osteoporosis who smoked had a 1.82-fold 
higher HR than that of nonsmoking participants with normal BMD; participants 
with diabetes mellitus (DM) had a 1.92-fold higher HR than that of participants 
with normal BMD without DM. The HR for participants with osteoporosis who 
exercised regularly was 1.00, whereas it was 1.18 for those who did not 
exercise.
CONCLUSION: This population-based cohort study demonstrates that having 
osteoporosis significantly increases dementia risk, which is amplified by 
smoking and diabetes but reduced by regular exercise.

BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) lacks biomarkers for diagnosis, 
prognostic stratification, and evaluation of response to potential treatments. 
Previous research supported the role of serum osteopontin (OPN) levels as a 
potential biomarker in ALS. However, the associations of OPN serum levels with 
clinical features and their trend over the disease course have not been explored 
yet.
METHODS: We measured OPN serum levels in a retrospective cohort of 110 
well-characterized patients with ALS, using a commercial ELISA kit, and analyzed 
their association with demographic and clinical features, as well as with other 
serum biomarkers. For a subset of patients, longitudinal measurements were 
available.
RESULTS: OPN serum levels differed significantly between patients with ALS and a 
cohort of 45 age and sex-matched healthy controls. However, when considering 
potential differential diagnoses, elevated OPN serum levels were not specific 
for ALS. Patients with an advanced disease stage (King's stage 3 or 4) exhibited 
significantly higher OPN serum levels compared to patients at earlier disease 
stages, whereas we did not observe any correlation with ALSFRS-R and progression 
rate. We observed an inverse correlation between OPN serum levels and BMI at 
diagnosis. Higher OPN serum levels predicted a shorter survival time and a 
shorter time to King's stage 4. No significant association between serum OPN and 
serum neurofilament light or glial fibrillary acid protein levels was observed. 
OPN serum levels were substantially stable over a 9-month observation time.
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that serum OPN is an informative biomarker in 
ALS, providing valuable prognostic insights, potentially reflecting the extent 
of disease, and demonstrating potential applications in clinical trials.

Receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1)-mediated necroptosis, a newly 
identified mode of regulated cell death, represents a significant pathogenic 
mechanism in multiple neurodegenerative disorders. Substantial experimental 
evidence indicates that RIPK1 regulates necroptotic cell death pathways in both 
neuronal and glial cell populations through activation of the canonical 
RIPK3-MLKL signaling cascade, thereby exacerbating neuroinflammatory responses 
and accelerating neurodegenerative progression. The pathological relevance of 
this molecular pathway has been extensively validated across multiple major 
neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's 
disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and multiple sclerosis (MS). 
Pharmacological interventions targeting RIPK1 or its downstream 
effectors-particularly RIPK3 and MLKL-have demonstrated significant efficacy in 
mitigating disease-associated pathological manifestations. This highlights the 
RIPK1 signaling axis as a promising therapeutic target for neuroprotective 
strategies. Consequently, thorough investigation of RIPK1-mediated necroptosis 
in neurodegenerative settings holds considerable translational potential. Such 
inquiry deepens mechanistic understanding of disease pathogenesis while 
accelerating the advancement of innovative therapeutic approaches with direct 
clinical relevance.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to investigate possible sex 
predictors in the severity of NPS in a large cohort of patients with AD and to 
assess the role of severity in sex-related differences in NPS.
METHODS: Four hundred and twenty-four participants (295 women, mean age 
78.4 ± 8.3 years, mean disease duration 7.4 ± 8.5 years) were included with a 
diagnosis of AD according to NINCDS/ADRDA criteria. Clinical data and presence 
of NPS were collected from family interview, medical records, and patient 
interview and examination. Dementia severity was assessed using the Clinical 
Dementia Rating Scale (CDRS) extended version.
RESULTS: CDRS score was available for 407 participants (mean score 2.6 ± 1.1); 
407 (22.1%) patients had CRDS = 1, 104 (25.5%) had CRDS = 2, 127 (31.2%) had 
CRDS = 3, 64 (15.7%) had CDRS = 4 and 22 (15.4%) had CDRS = 5. Apathy (85.7%), 
agitation or restlessness (75.1%) and paranoia (59.4%) were the most common NPS. 
Higher CDRS scores were associated with several neuropsychiatric features, 
including apathy, wandering and physical aggression. In the sex-stratified 
analysis, NPS were associated with more severe AD only in men.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest relevant sex differences in NPS with 
increasing severity.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: A timely and targeted behavioral management could improve 
treatment outcome.

Organ-specific aging clocks have shown promise as predictors of disease risk and 
aging trajectories; however, the underlying biological mechanisms they reflect 
remain largely unexplored. Here, we use large-scale proteomic and imaging data 
to investigate the relationships among organ-specific and modality-specific 
aging clocks and to uncover the biological processes they represent. By 
estimating paired protein-based and imaging-based aging clocks across 8 major 
organs, we demonstrate that these omics and structural profiles exhibit distinct 
phenotypic and genetic signatures, each potentially quantifying different stages 
and playing complementary roles within a unified biological aging process. 
Furthermore, context-specific aging clocks from multiple organs often converge 
and jointly capture established biological and disease pathways. For example, 
65.7% of the KEGG Alzheimer's disease pathway is enriched by at least one of 11 
protein- and imaging-based aging clocks, with each clock representing different 
components of the pathway. These results underscore the importance of a 
pan-organ multi-modal perspective for quantifying the mechanisms underlying 
age-related diseases. Additionally, we identify modality-specific links between 
aging clocks and complex diseases and lifestyle factors. In summary, we uncover 
intricate relationships among molecular and structural aging clocks across human 
organs, providing novel insights into their context-specific roles in capturing 
consequences of aging biology and their implications for disease risk.

Alzheimer's disease is a multifaceted neurodegenerative disorder, with diverse 
underlying pathophysiological processes extending beyond amyloid-β and tau 
accumulation. The heterogeneity of Alzheimer's disease necessitates the 
identification of a broad array of biomarkers that capture the diverse 
mechanisms contributing to disease onset and progression. In this study, we 
systematically compiled and analysed cerebrospinal fluid proteomics data from 
omics studies utilizing mass spectrometry, Olink, or SomaScan platforms. 
Systematic literature searches for each platform revealed a total of 264 
studies. From this, a set of 18 studies were selected based on sample size, 
number of markers analysed, and open data availability. We found a total of 
1,448 differentially expressed proteins between Alzheimer's disease and amyloid 
negative controls across these datasets, with 635 being found in more than one 
study. A 'top' set of 61 differentially expressed proteins were consistently 
reported in at least six studies. Clustering and functional enrichment analysis 
of the top differentially expressed proteins indicated involvement in metabolic 
regulation, glutathione metabolism and proteins of the 14-3-3 family, reflecting 
importance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) response. Synaptic signalling 
processes were found to generally be downregulated. We further integrated the 
top differentially expressed proteins with results from a study on familial 
Alzheimer's disease cerebrospinal fluid to assess at which stage of disease 
progression these proteins change, highlighting markers shared between sporadic 
and familial Alzheimer's disease datasets. Lastly, we examine the overlap of the 
top differentially expressed proteins between cerebrospinal fluid and brain 
tissue using a publicly available database. This analysis provides a 
comprehensive overview of the Alzheimer's disease cerebrospinal fluid proteomic 
landscape, indicating changes in key pathways and cellular processes associated 
with Alzheimer's disease pathology. By integrating data from different 
platforms, we highlight reproducible protein changes that may serve as promising 
candidates for further biomarker research aimed at improving patient 
stratification, tracking disease progression, and assessing therapeutic 
interventions.

A traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) monomer is a bioactive compound extracted 
from Chinese herbal medicines possessing determined biological activity and 
pharmacological effects, and has gained much attention for treating neuronal 
diseases. However, the application of TCM monomers is limited by their low 
solubility and poor ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Exosomes are 
small extracellular vesicles (EVs) ranging in size from 30 to 150 nm in diameter 
and can be used as drug delivery carriers that directly target cells or tissues 
with unique advantages, including low toxicity, low immunogenicity, high 
stability in blood, and the ability to cross the BBB. This review discusses the 
biogenesis, components, stability, surface modification, isolation technology, 
advantages, and disadvantages of exosomes as drug carriers and compares exosomes 
and other similar drug delivery systems. Furthermore, exosome-encapsulated TCM 
monomers exert neuroprotective roles, such as anti-inflammation, anti-apoptosis, 
anti-mitophagy, and anti-oxidation, in various neuronal diseases, including 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and 
cerebral ischemia and reperfusion (CI/R) injury, as well as anti-drug 
resistance, anti-tumorigenesis, anti-angiogenesis, and promotion of apoptosis in 
brain tumors, providing more inspiration to promote the development of an 
exosome-based delivery tool in targeted therapy for neuronal diseases.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by cognitive decline and memory loss, significantly impacting the 
quality of life for affected individuals. This manuscript explores various 
innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at enhancing drug delivery to the brain, 
particularly through the use of nanotechnology. This paper discussed the 
application of Solid Lipid Nanoparticles (SLNs), dendrimers, and Polymeric 
Nanoparticles (PNPs) in targeting the Central Nervous System (CNS) to improve 
bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy. The findings indicate that these 
advanced delivery systems can enhance brain penetration, reduce Amyloid-Beta 
(Aβ) deposition, and improve cognitive functions in animal models of AD. 
Furthermore, the review highlights the challenges associated with these 
technologies, including limited scalability and potential toxicity, while 
suggesting future directions for research and development in the field of AD 
treatment.

and Gamma Secretases.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative neurological disease characterized by 
a loss of memory and cognitive ability. One of the main factors influencing the 
development of AD is the accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) plaque in the brain. The 
sequential production of Aβ is mediated by two enzymes: gamma-secretase and 
β-secretase (BACE1). The goal of beta-secretase inhibitors is to prevent the 
initial cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), which reduces the 
production of amyloid-β peptides by limiting the substrate available for 
gamma-secretase. Simultaneously, gamma-secretase modulators are engineered to 
specifically modify enzyme performance, reducing the synthesis of the harmful 
Aβ42 isoform while maintaining vital physiological processes. Targeting both 
secretases reduces amyloidogenic processing synergistically. Selective 
inhibitors, which have been recently developed, have also shown good clinical 
development. They can reduce Aβ levels effectively with minimal side effects. 
The therapeutic strategy also underlines the importance of early therapy 
intervention in the preclinical AD phase for an optimum effect. Although there 
are some problems in the optimization of drug delivery and the alleviation of 
side effects, targeting beta and gamma secretases remains a promising direction. 
However, all these strategies still need more research and clinical testing to 
improve existing treatments and develop new, efficient Alzheimer's disease 
therapies. This review seeks to examine the therapeutic promise of β- and 
γ-secretase inhibition in Alzheimer's disease and review recent progress, 
challenges, and new dual-inhibition approaches.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease is associated with dysfunction of the 
cholinergic system, making the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and 
butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) a promising therapeutic approach.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the neuroprotective effects and toxicity 
of essential oil (EO) and carlina oxide from Carthamus caeruleus in mice, 
assessing their potential for Alzheimer's disease treatment.
METHODS: The chemical composition of the essential oil extracted from the roots 
of Carthamus caeruleus was analyzed using gas chromatography (GC) and gas 
chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The main component, carlina oxide, was 
isolated via column chromatography. The inhibitory activities of AChE and BChE 
were evaluated in vitro for both the essential oil and carlina oxide. 
Additionally, in vivo, toxicity was assessed in laboratory mice.
RESULTS: Chemical analysis identified carlina oxide (81.6%) as the major 
constituent, along with minor compounds such as 13-methoxycarlin oxide and 
hexadecanoic acid. Both the essential oil and its main component, carlina oxide, 
exhibited significant inhibitory activity against AChE and BChE, enzymes 
associated with Alzheimer's disease. The essential oil demonstrated promising 
IC50 values, with stronger anti-BChE activity compared to the reference drug, 
galantamine. Toxicity tests in mice revealed no adverse effects at lower doses 
(0.2-0.5 g/kg). However, higher doses (1.0-2.0 g/kg) resulted in mild to 
significant toxicity, including weight loss and mortality.
DISCUSSION: The essential oil and carlina oxide demonstrated potent BChE 
inhibition, particularly relevant in advanced Alzheimer's disease. While 
effective at low doses, signs of toxicity were observed at higher 
concentrations, highlighting the importance of dose optimization. These findings 
suggest that C. caeruleus may serve as a natural source of cholinesterase 
inhibitors, pending further in vivo studies and clinical validation.
CONCLUSION: Carthamus caeruleus essential oil and carlina oxide show promising 
inhibitory effects on AChE and BChE, suggesting their potential as 
neuroprotective agents. However, their toxicity at higher doses highlights the 
need for cautious use and further investigation.

Exploring the Neuroprotective Potential of Polyphenolic Compounds in Mitigating 
Quinolinic Acid-Induced Neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's Disease.

Gandhi P(1), Panchal S(1).

Author information:
(1)Pharmacology Department, Institute of Pharmacy, Nirma University, Ahmedabad, 
India.

BACKGROUND: Quinolinic Acid (QA), a neurotoxic metabolite in the kynurenine 
pathway, contributes to neuronal damage, oxidative stress, and 
neuroinflammation, playing a key role in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathogenesis. 
This study investigates the neuroprotective potential of polyphenolic compounds, 
particularly lycopene and a Curcumin-Zinc (Cur-Zn) complex, using in- -silico 
and in-vitro approaches targeting the kynurenine pathway.
METHODOLOGY: This study evaluated the neuroprotective potential of lycopene and 
Cur-Zn complex using in-silico and in-vitro approaches. Molecular docking was 
performed to assess their binding affinities with the kynurenine pathway 
enzymes, and in-vitro neuroprotection assays on N2a cells measured their 
efficacy against QA-induced oxidative stress.
RESULTS: Docking analysis revealed strong binding affinities of Cur-Zn and 
lycopene to IDO1 and KMO, with fitness scores of 143.11 and 126.41, 
respectively, indicating their potential as enzyme- specific inhibitors. 
Lycopene exhibited the most potent neuroprotective effect (IC50 = 0.63 μM), 
followed by Cur-Zn (1.59 μM). Both compounds significantly reduced QA-induced 
ROS levels, as confirmed by DCFDA fluorescence imaging. Additionally, they 
upregulated KAT and QPRT enzymes, promoting neuroprotective metabolite 
production.
DISCUSSION: Lycopene and Cur-Zn effectively modulate key kynurenine pathway 
enzymes while mitigating oxidative stress, supporting their potential as 
neuroprotective agents. Although bisabolol and bromelain exhibited some 
efficacy, their effects were comparatively lower.
CONCLUSION: Lycopene and Cur-Zn are promising candidates for AD therapy, 
demonstrating not only anti-oxidant activity but also a capacity to minimise the 
neurotoxic effects of QA, offering a dual mechanism of action. Further, in-vivo 
studies are needed to validate their therapeutic potential in neurodegenerative 
diseases.

INTRODUCTION: Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with ligands for 
synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) has emerged as a promising methodology 
for measuring synaptic density in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We investigated 
associations between SV2A concentrations in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF).
METHODS: Twenty-one participants with early AD and 7 cognitively normal (CN) 
individuals underwent [11C]UCB-J PET. We used a novel enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to measure CSF SV2A. Other synaptic and axonal 
proteins were also measured in CSF.
RESULTS: CSF SV2A was lower in AD compared to CN participants. Within the AD 
group, CSF SV2A was highly correlated with SV2A PET. By contrast, other CSF 
proteins were generally higher in participants with AD and not associated with 
SV2A PET.
DISCUSSION: We report a novel CSF assay for SV2A that is strongly correlated 
with the PET measurement of SV2A. Our results suggest that CSF SV2A may serve as 
a biomarker for synaptic density in AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: Synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) measured by a novel 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was lower in 
participants with symptomatic Alzheimer's disease (AD). CSF SV2A was highly 
correlated with SV2A measured by positron emission tomography (PET) in 
participants with AD. Other CSF synaptic/axonal proteins were not significantly 
associated with SV2A PET. CSF SV2A may serve as a biomarker for synaptic density 
in AD.

The Secretion and Maturation Journey of Gingipains.

Multifunctional gingipains are trypsin-like enzymes secreted extracellularly by 
Porphyromonas gingivalis, which require delicate transit and processing to be 
activated in different mature forms. This review manages to reconstruct each 
processing step including the specific cleavage sites and relative proteins or 
helpers. Errors in any steps can lead to the accumulation of immature gingipains 
and weaken the virulence of P. gingivalis. Of special note, we emphasize the 
contribution of new studies to the refinement of the gingipain maturation 
process and factors that influence their pathogenicity. For example, it is 
proposed that glutamine cyclase, which is responsible for cyclizing exposed 
glutamine to pyroglutamic acid after the N-terminal signal peptide is removed, 
may be able to serve as a potential target for periodontitis treatment, as 
normal cyclization is key to maintaining the stability of gingipains. Further 
structural and functional unraveling of the type IX secretion system components, 
such as the identification of the structure of the PorV-associated shuttle 
complex, the determination of PorZ's role as the A-LPS deliverer, and the 
confirmation of the specific mechanism by which PorU promotes CTD removal and 
catalyzes the transpeptide reaction, has also contributed to a better 
understanding of gingipain processing. Meanwhile, as the successful activation 
of gingipains serves to fulfill their functions, this work also concentrates on 
gingipain pathogenicity, with a particular focus on how gingipains can induce or 
stimulate the development of systemic diseases, such as causing cardiovascular 
disorder through vascular damage or exacerbating inflammation in the brain in 
Alzheimer's disease after crossing the blood-brain barrier.

BACKGROUND: The growing prevalence of dementia emphasizes the need for effective 
prevention strategies. Although the partial efficacy of multidomain 
interventions for dementia prevention has been demonstrated, understanding the 
characteristics of individuals who benefit most from these interventions is 
crucial for optimizing resource allocation. This study investigated the 
association between participants' genetic backgrounds and the effectiveness of 
multidomain interventions for preventing dementia.
METHODS: This study utilized data from the Japan-Multimodal Intervention Trial 
for the Prevention of Dementia (J-MINT), where older adults with mild cognitive 
impairment underwent 18 months of multidomain intervention. The intervention 
included exercise, nutrition, cognitive stimulation, social participation, and 
vascular risk management. Participants who completed the J-MINT intervention and 
had genetic data, including whole-genome sequencing (WGS), were analyzed. Using 
Japanese polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for Alzheimer's disease, participants were 
stratified into high- and low-genetic-risk groups. Cognitive composite score 
(CPS) improvement rates at 6-, 12-, and 18-months were compared between 
intervention and control groups, with subgroup analyses performed by age (< 75 
and  ≥  75 years). Additionally, a comprehensive variant analysis using WGS was 
conducted to identify genetic signals potentially associated with the 
intervention's effectiveness.
RESULTS: Among 289 participants analyzed (168 aged < 75 years; 121 
aged ≥ 75 years), 99 were classified into the high-risk PRS group (56 
intervention, 43 control) and 190 into the low-risk PRS group (92 intervention, 
98 control). For participants aged ≥ 75 years, no statistically significant 
differences in CPS improvement rates were observed between the intervention and 
control groups, regardless of PRS classification. However, in participants 
aged < 75, those in the high-risk PRS group showed significant CPS improvement 
at the 6-month follow-up. Additionally, analysis of 9,978,605 genetic variants 
identified two loci, ID3 and LMO1 (rs2067053 and rs201082658), with suggestive 
associations (P < 1 × 10⁻4) to reduced intervention effectiveness.
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlighted the utility of PRS in predicting cognitive 
improvement following multidomain interventions and identified genetic variants 
that may influence the intervention's effectiveness. The findings provide a 
valuable foundation for personalized dementia prevention strategies.

Agitation is one of the most prevalent neuropsychiatric symptoms leading to 
institutionalization in individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. It 
is associated with poor outcomes, including reduced functional ability, reduced 
quality of life, accelerated disease progression, increased mortality, and 
significant economic burden. Following an initial report demonstrating the 
strong efficacy of a combination of dextromethorphan and the CYP2D6 inhibitor 
quinidine, several follow-up development efforts have explored this approach. 
Axsome Therapeutics has reported positive results in three out of four clinical 
trials evaluating AXS-05, a combination of dextromethorphan with another CYP2D6 
inhibitor, bupropion. In contrast, Otsuka's AVP-786, a combination of deuterated 
dextromethorphan and quinidine, has yielded predominantly negative results. It 
is widely believed that deuteration alters a molecule's pharmacokinetic 
properties without affecting its pharmacodynamics. However, in our patch-clamp 
experiments, deuteration resulted in a 16-fold increase in IC50 for dextrorphan 
and about two-fold increase for dextromethorphan at NMDA receptors containing 
the NR2D subunit. Thus, based on both clinical data and emerging pharmacological 
evidence, we hypothesize that AVP-786 failed to demonstrate efficacy in treating 
agitation in AD dementia due to the negative impact of deuteration on 
dextromethorphan's pharmacodynamic properties.

BACKGROUND: Dementia is an increasingly significant public health challenge 
worldwide, with Alzheimer’s disease being the most prevalent form of dementia. 
The objective of this study was burden of risk factors attributable to 
Alzheimer’s disease and other dementia and its relationship with the 
Socio-Demographic Index in Asian countries.
METHODS: The present study is a population-based study. The 2021 Global Burden 
of Disease Study dataset for countries in the Asian continent was used in this 
study. Age-standardized rate (ASR) for incidence, mortality, prevalence, 
Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALY), Years of Life Lost (YLL), Years Lived 
with Disability (YLD) and Annual Percentage Change (APC) were considered by 
gender and country. We assessed the trend for all index from 2010 to 2021. In 
addition, the association between socio-demographic index (SDI) and Alzheimer’s 
disease incidence and prevalnce was calculated using Pearson correlation 
analysis.
RESULTS: The results indicated that the number and ASR of four indicators 
(incidence, prevalence, mortality, DALY, YLL, and YLD) from 1990 to 2021 were 
higher for women than for men. Metabolic risks and high fasting plasma glucose 
emerged as the primary risk factors for all four indicators. The percentage 
change in the risk factor associated with smoking for all four indicators 
decreased from 1990 to 2021, while the most significant increase was observed in 
the percentage change related to high body mass index. Additionally, the results 
demonstrated a positive and significant correlation between the Sociodemographic 
Index (SDI) and Age-Standardized Incidence Rate (ASIR) (r = 0.284, p = 0.04) as 
well as Age-Standardized Prevalence Rate (ASPR) (r = 0.281, p = 0.01).
CONCLUSION: According to the reported results, the burden of disease remains 
high in most countries. To alleviate this burden, it is essential to prioritize 
women and the elderly, and to implement more effective prevention and treatment 
measures.

This study aimed to investigate the role of Sirt1 in the transition from 
depressive disorder (DD) to Alzheimer's disease (AD), focusing on the regulation 
of inflammatory factors and oxidative stress through modulation of acetylation 
substrates. Male C57BL/6 and APP/PS1 mice were used to establish a mouse model 
of chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). Depressive and anxiety behaviors, 
as well as cognitive function, were evaluated in model mice. A range of 
techniques, including immunohistochemistry, qRT-PCR, western blotting, and 
ELISA, was used to investigate the performance of the model mice. VENN analysis 
was used to identify hub genes and signaling pathways regulated by Sirt1. 
Finally, differential expression analysis between the AD + DD and DD groups was 
conducted using transcriptome sequencing, and data processing was conducted 
using DESeq2 software. Behavioral experiments revealed that, following CUMS 
stimulation, both APP/PS1 and C57BL/6 mice exhibited significantly reduced 
responsiveness, anhedonia, depression, despair, and impaired spatial exploration 
abilities. Performance analysis further demonstrated that CUMS treatment 
activated microglial cells, suppressed both the mRNA and protein expression of 
Sirt1, and promoted the expression of GM-CSF, IL-6, TNF-α, NO, MDA, and ROS. In 
addition, CUMS exposure inhibited the expression of SOD. Bioinformatic analysis 
and transcriptome sequencing of the Sirt1 receptor indicated that Sirt1 
regulates the RelA/NLRP3 signaling pathway, which might subsequently affect the 
expression and function of differentially expressed genes, thereby promoting the 
transition from DD to AD. CUMS stimulation induced depressive and anxious 
behaviors, cognitive impairments, activation of microglial cells, reduced 
expression of Sirt1, and increased levels of inflammatory factors and oxidative 
stress markers in AD mice. Bioinformatic analysis and transcriptome sequencing 
suggested that Sirt1 may influence the expression and function of differentially 
expressed genes by regulating the RelA/NLRP3 signaling pathway, thereby 
promoting the transition from DD to AD.

Genome-wide association studies have identified many gene polymorphisms 
associated with an increased risk of developing late-onset Alzheimer's disease 
(LOAD). Many of these LOAD risk-associated alleles alter disease pathogenesis by 
influencing innate immune responses and lipid metabolism of microglia (MG). Here 
we show that boosting the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), a 
genome-wide association study LOAD risk-associated gene product, specifically in 
MG, reduces amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque load, preserves vulnerable neurons and 
excitatory synapses, and significantly reduces learning and memory abnormalities 
in the 5xFAD amyloid mouse model of AD. ACE-expressing MG surround plaques more 
frequently and they have increased Aβ phagocytosis, endolysosomal trafficking 
and spleen tyrosine kinase activation downstream of the major Aβ receptors, 
triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (Trem2) and C-type lectin 
domain family 7 member A (Clec7a). These findings establish a role for ACE in 
enhancing microglial immune function and they identify a potential use for 
ACE-expressing MG as a cell-based therapy to augment endogenous microglial 
responses to Aβ in AD.

PURPOSE: The current study was conducted to develop and evaluate sialic acid 
grafted cationic myricetin (MY) fabricated nanostructured lipid carrier 
(Sia-Cat-MY-NLC) for Alzheimer's disease (AD) management.
METHODS: In-vitro amyloid beta aggregation inhibition and mitochondrial membrane 
potential of prepared NLCs were observed in SH-SY5Y cells. The transendothelial 
electrical resistance was measured through hCMEC/D3 cells. Pharmacokinetic and 
pharmacodynamic studies were conducted to evaluate neuropharmacokinetic 
parameters and levels of AD hallmarks in AD rats.
RESULTS: The optimized formulations showed particle sizes (142.26 ± 24.16 nm and 
236.3 ± 15.26 nm), zeta potentials (36.5 ± 2.43 mv and -2.4 ± 1.30 mv) 
respectively for Cat-MY-NLC and Sia-Cat-MY-NLC. Prepared NLCs treatments 
revealed significant neuroprotective effects in SH-SY5Y cells followed by the 
ability to cross the in-vitro BBB model. Results of pharmacokinetic studies 
showed 5.3 and 5.88 folds enhanced bioavailability with Cat-MY-NLC and 
Sia-Cat-MY-NLC administration respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of enzymatic analysis showed a significant (p < 0.05) 
restoration of AD hallmark levels in the brain after Sia-Cat-MY-NLC treatment 
than Cat-MY-NLC.

The development of drugs for nervous diseases poses distinctive difficulties 
owing to the incomplete understanding of the physiology and complex pathogenesis 
of the multifaceted central (CNS) and peripheral (PNS) nervous systems. 
Conventional animal tests and in vitro two-dimensional (2D) cell cultures fail 
to reproduce the sophisticated structure of natural human tissues, hindering the 
new drug discovery process. The emerging three-dimensional (3D) neural tissue 
models, including organoids, organ-on-chip and 3D-printed neural scaffolds, can 
provide an improved reproduction of the critical features, structural 
complexity, biological functions, dynamic circulation micro-environment and 
cell-matrix/cell interactions of the nervous systems. This review examines 
state-of-the-art 3D models for neural physiology/pathology, emphasizing their 
drug development applications. Fundamental advantages of various in vitro 3D 
neural models for investigating the mechanisms of nerve regeneration and 
disorders in both the CNS and PNS are compared in terms of the different 
modeling techniques. In addition, the applications of 3D neural models in drug 
development are summarized covering a range of areas such as disease modeling 
for basic research, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic testing for drug 
screening and drug safety evaluation. Furthermore, current challenges and future 
outlook of biomimetic models and the existing bottlenecks hindering their 
successful translation into clinical use are discussed. STATEMENT OF 
SIGNIFICANCE: This review highlights the groundbreaking potential of 3D neural 
models-organoids, organ-on-chip, and 3D-printed scaffolds-to revolutionize 
neurological research and drug development. Unlike conventional methods, these 
models replicate the intricate structure and function of the human nervous 
system, enabling precise study of diseases like Alzheimer's, spinal injuries, 
and brain tumors. By summarizing and discussing recent advancements, the review 
compares techniques, their applications in drug screening and personalized 
medicine, and addresses challenges in model accuracy and scalability. Bridging 
neuroscience, engineering, and pharmacology, this work provides a roadmap for 
researchers to innovate therapies. The insights presented are critical for 
accelerating drug discovery and improving treatment outcomes, making 3D neural 
models essential for scientists and clinicians tackling neurological disorders.

Patterns and determinants of statin prescribing and discontinuation in 
individuals aged 80 and older: A 10-year population-based cohort study.

Khelifi M, Simard M, Boiteau V, Gagnon ME, Dalleur O, Sirois C.

BACKGROUND: Considering the limited knowledge regarding the benefits and risks 
of statins in people ≥80 years, population use patterns can provide valuable 
insights.
OBJECTIVE: To describe prescribing and discontinuation patterns for statins, 
along with their determinants, in people ≥80 years in Québec, Canada.
METHODS: Using the Quebec Integrated Chronic Disease Surveillance System, we 
built a population-based cohort of community-dwelling adults aged ≥80 years on 
January 4, 2018. We assessed statin use in the 5 years before and after cohort 
entry to calculate the proportion of prevalent, incident, and discontinued 
statin users. We used multivariable Cox models to identify factors associated 
with initiation and discontinuation, using hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% 
confidence intervals.
RESULTS: A total of 317,027 individuals of mean age 85.2 years were included. At 
cohort entry, 51% were prevalent statin users. Within 5 years, 11% of nonusers 
initiated a statin. Among prevalent users, 22% discontinued their therapy during 
follow-up. Strongest factors associated with initiation included ages 80-84 (HRs 
ranging from 0.74 [95% confidence interval: 0.71-0.76] for 85-89 years to 0.26 
[0.22-0.30] for 95+), previous statin use (1.99 [1.93-2.07]), and male sex (1.44 
[1.39-1.49]). Older age (HRs ranging from 1.54 [1.51-1.58] for 85-89 years to 
3.65 [3.42-3.89] for 95+), and Alzheimer's disease (1.77 [1.71-1.82]) were the 
most common factors for discontinuation. Previous cardiovascular disease was 
associated with both initiation (1.26 [1.07-1.49]) and reduced likelihood of 
discontinuation (0.69 [0.64-0.74]).
CONCLUSION: Statin use remains prevalent among the ≥80 years. A thorough 
evaluation of the risk/benefit balance of such use is needed.

Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China.

BACKGROUND: The incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is gradually increasing in 
an aging society, imposing a heavy burden on society. Current studies have found 
that acupuncture therapy combined with donepezil has a good clinical effect in 
treating AD. We plan to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to 
evaluate the effectiveness of acupuncture combined with donepezil in AD 
patients.
METHODS: Eight databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) 
using acupuncture in combination with donepezil for the treatment of AD, from 
the establishment of the database to October 1st, 2023. The clinical efficacy 
rate, Mini-Mental State Examination, AD Assessment Scale for Cognitive Capacity, 
Skill Level on Activities of Daily Living, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, 
Behavioral Pathology in AD Rating Scale, and adverse events were mainly used to 
evaluate the outcomes. RevMan 5.4.1 software was used to evaluate the quality of 
the included studies and perform a meta-analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 12 RCTs were included. Meta-analysis showed that acupuncture 
combined with donepezil seemed to be more effective than donepezil monotherapy 
for treatment of AD in improving the clinical efficacy rate (relative 
risk = 1.35; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.17-1.56; Z = 4.10; P < .0001), the 
Mini-Mental State Examination score (mean difference [MD] = 3.28; 95% CI: 
1.81-4.75; Z = 4.37; P < .0001), and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment score 
(MD = 6.04; 95% CI: 4.76-7.32; Z = 9.23; P = .00001), while reducing the AD 
Assessment Scale for Cognitive Capacity score (MD = -3.57; 95% CI: -3.94 to 
-3.20; Z = 18.91; P < .00001), the Skill Level on Activities of Daily Living 
score (MD = -2.52; 95% CI: -4.05 to -0.99; Z = 3.23; P = .001), and the 
Behavioral Pathology in AD Rating Scale score (MD = -4.04; 95% CI: -4.58 to 
-3.50; Z = 14.64; P < .00001).
CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture combined with donepezil is an effective treatment which 
can improve cognitive ability and quality of life for AD patients. However, it 
is imperative to conduct more large-scale and high-quality RCTs in order to 
establish more definitive conclusions regarding this therapeutic approach in the 
future.

This study evaluates the efficacy, safety, and economics of galantamine in the 
treatment of Alzheimer disease (AD) patients, and to provide evidence-based 
reference for optimizing drug selection, dosing strategies, and reimbursement 
policies in clinical practice. We used galantamine, systematic review, cost, and 
their synonym as keywords. The PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, China 
National Knowledge Infrastructure, Weipu, Wanfang database, and Health 
Technology Assessment organization websites were searched to retrieve studies 
regarding galantamine for the treatment of AD from database creation to 
September 20, 2023. We extracted information and pooled the results of the 
studies for qualitative analyses instead of quantitative meta-analysis. This 
study incorporated 39 reports. Regarding effectiveness, galantamine 
significantly improved cognitive function, living capacity, mental behavior, and 
global functioning of the AD patients compared with the placebo. However, based 
on available data, it was not possible to infer whether galantamine was more 
effective than the other acetylcholinesterase inhibitor drugs. AD patients 
treated with galantamine showed a higher incidence of adverse gastrointestinal 
effects compared to those treated with placebo. Galantamine showed a higher 
incidence of adverse gastrointestinal effects than donepezil but a lower rate 
than rivastigmine. Regarding economics, compared with the placebo and 
non-pharmacological treatments, galantamine prolonged the duration of full-time 
care and in some cases even reduced the overall cost of galantamine use. 
Galantamine showed good efficacy, cost-effectiveness, and mild adverse effects 
in the treatment of patients with AD by prolonging the duration of full-time 
care and saving the cost compared with the placebo and non-pharmacological.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with a significant 
impact on global public health. The primary hallmarks of the disease included 
amyloid-beta peptide (Aβ) deposition, neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), and 
synaptic loss. Sirtuins, a group of NAD+-dependent deacetylase enzymes, are key 
regulators of AD pathogenesis. SIRT1, a member of sirtuins, has been identified 
to possess neuroprotective properties. Thus, its promising enhancers are 
included. Further, SIRT2 promising inhibitors are reviewed for therapeutic 
efficacy. The extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways of caspases are 
mediated by CD95 and DNA damage. The promising inhibitors Q-VD-OPh and 
minocycline are found to be specific for caspase-7 and caspase-3, respectively. 
Primarily, glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) is found to be involved in the 
generation of phosphorylated tau. The promising GSK-3 inhibitor included the 
COB-187 (IC50 = 370 nM) and maleimide-derivative (compound 33, IC50 = 0.09 μM). 
This review highlights the molecular mechanisms of sirtuin, caspase, and GSK-3 
in the pathophysiology of AD. Further, promising modulators specific to these 
targets are described.

Intracellular Trafficking of Cationic Bicelles and siRNA Cargo in an In Vitro 
Blood-Brain Barrier Model.

Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, United States.

Blood-brain barrier dysfunction (BBB), triggered by inflammatory changes in the 
periphery and the brain, is an early event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). Therapeutic strategies that restore BBB integrity and function by 
targeting inflammatory signaling hold great promise for halting the progression 
of AD. siRNA-based therapeutics offer a precise means of silencing 
proinflammatory targets, but the efficient and targeted delivery of siRNA to the 
brain endothelium remains a significant challenge. To address this, we 
formulated cationic bicelles (DPPC/DC7PC/DOTAP, molar ratio 63.8/25.0/11.2) to 
deliver siRNA to the BBB. In this study, we investigated the pathways of 
endocytic uptake and intracellular trafficking for siRNA-loaded bicelles in a 
human in vitro BBB model. Using pharmacological inhibitors and targeted siRNA 
knockdowns, we demonstrated that bicelles are internalized via multiple 
endocytic mechanisms, including clathrin-mediated, caveolin-mediated, 
dynamin-independent, and lipid raft-associated mechanisms. Using fluorescence 
microscopy, we showed that the bicelles and siRNA are internalized together and 
then trafficked into distinct intracellular compartments. Bicelles accumulated 
in the early and late endosomes while siRNA accumulated outside of the 
endolysosomal system. A three-compartmental model was used to quantitatively 
describe bicelle uptake and trafficking over the course of 12 h. These findings 
significantly advance our understanding of how the cationic bicelles deliver 
siRNA to the BBB endothelium and provide a mechanistic foundation for developing 
next-generation siRNA therapeutics aimed at restoring neurovascular health in 
Alzheimer's patients.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), a common neurodegenerative disease, is the leading 
cause of dementia in the elderly. Iron deposition is closely linked to the 
pathogenesis of AD. In the AD brain, elevated iron levels are strongly 
correlated with characteristic AD pathologies, including β-amyloid plaques, tau 
neurofibrillary tangles, and apoptosis. Increasing evidence suggests that 
oxidative stress, due to dysregulated iron metabolism, plays an important role 
in AD pathophysiology. Understanding the role of iron accumulation in the 
pathology of AD is, therefore, critical to treating AD. A comprehensive iron 
staining protocol is essential to detect iron expression and distribution in the 
brain. This protocol aims to describe a method to assess the quantity and 
distribution of iron deposition in the brain. We describe the processes involved 
in reagent preparation, mouse treatment, and preparation of brain sections. In 
addition, we present a detailed step-by-step protocol for histochemical iron 
detection in cerebral tissue sections, accompanied by a systematic analytical 
framework integrating both quantitative assessment and morphological evaluation 
to ensure a comprehensive interpretation of staining outcomes. This experimental 
protocol will help researchers understand iron depositions in the brain and 
support AD research.

INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer screening enables the use of earlier treatment 
options and contributes to decreased mortality, however, there are urban-rural 
screening differences that impact the survival of rural women. Within the 
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), rural-residing women veterans are 1 of the 
fastest growing groups to enroll in health care, but little is known about their 
access factors specific to screening mammography. The objective of this study 
was to examine mammography access factors among VA-enrolled rural women veterans 
overdue for breast cancer screening.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews (n = 16) with 
rural-residing women veterans who were overdue for breast cancer screening for 
at least 12 months and received primary care services at a central Oregon VA 
community-based outpatient clinic. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, 
and coded using a hybrid inductive-deductive approach to thematic analysis. 
Deductive coding was used to identify mammography access barriers and inductive 
coding was used to explore related aspects of veterans' clinical care 
experiences surrounding breast cancer screening.
RESULTS: Three themes were identified: (1) other health concerns interfere with 
screening; (2) screening avoidance because of a lack of geographically available 
gender-sensitive care tailored to women veterans; and (3) missed screening 
opportunities from gaps in communication and coordination processes.
CONCLUSIONS: Results illustrated mammography access barriers experienced by 
rural women veterans and underscored the importance of ensuring veterans' access 
to gender-sensitive and trauma-informed breast cancer screening.

Neurological disorders are the leading cause of global health loss and 
disability. However, the success rate of drug development in the nervous system 
is very low, mainly because of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In addition, 
gastrointestinal irritation, low stability, rapid metabolism, imprecise 
targeting, and organ toxicity of drugs are also important constraints in the 
development and application of neurological drugs. Emerging technologies, such 
as nano-delivery technology, offer a number of strategies to address these 
challenges drugs face entering the central nervous system. This review 
systematically introduces the various challenges of existing drug development in 
neurological disorders and summarizes BBB regulation strategies, drug delivery 
strategies, and modes of administration. It's summarized that the challenges of 
BBB can be addressed with the help of strategies including physical stimulation 
and modification of nanocarriers, and drug delivery in the nervous system can be 
achieved with the help of passive and active nanocarriers and self-assembly. 
Moreover, drug delivery strategies in major neurological disorders are discussed 
in detail. Finally, the limitations of some drug delivery strategies are 
summarized and the future development direction is prospected, which can provide 
new ideas and technologies for the optimization of drug delivery for 
neurological disorders.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a heterogeneous neurodegenerative 
disorder in which tau neurofibrillary tangles are a pathological hallmark 
closely associated with cognitive dysfunction and neurodegeneration. In this 
study, we used brain tau data to investigate AD heterogeneity by identifying and 
characterizing the subpopulations among patients. We included 615 cognitively 
normal and 159 AD brain 18F-flortaucipr PET scans, along with T1-weighted MRI 
from the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. A three 
dimensional-convolutional neural network model was employed for AD detection 
using standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) images. The model-derived saliency 
maps were generated and employed as informative image features for clustering AD 
participants. Among the identified subpopulations, statistical analysis of 
demographics, neuropsychological measures, and SUVR were compared. Correlations 
between neuropsychological measures and regional SUVRs were assessed. A 
generalized linear model was utilized to investigate the sex and APOE ε4 
interaction effect on regional SUVRs.
RESULTS: Two distinct subpopulations of AD patients were revealed, denoted as 
SHi and SLo. Compared to the SLo group, the SHi group exhibited a significantly 
higher global tau burden in the brain, but both groups showed similar cognition 
distribution levels. In the SHi group, the associations between the 
neuropsychological measurements and regional tau deposition were weakened. 
Moreover, a significant interaction effect of sex and APOE ε4 on tau deposition 
was observed in the SLo group, but no such effect was found in the SHi group.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that tau tangles, as shown by SUVR, continue to 
accumulate even when cognitive function plateaus in AD patients, highlighting 
the advantages of PET in later disease stages. The differing relationships 
between cognition and tau deposition, and between gender, APOE4, and tau 
deposition, provide potential for subtype-specific treatments. Targeting 
gender-specific and genetic factors influencing tau deposition, as well as 
interventions aimed at tau's impact on cognition, may be effective.

L-DOPA remains a cornerstone treatment for Parkinson's disease and is 
increasingly recognized for its role in various neurological and 
neurodegenerative disorders. As a direct precursor to dopamine, L-DOPA is 
synthesized from L-tyrosine through the action of tyrosine hydroxylase and is 
subsequently converted into dopamine via aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase. 
Its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) makes it a crucial 
therapeutic agent for restoring dopaminergic neurotransmission, thereby 
influencing motor function, cognition, and neuroprotection. Beyond Parkinson's, 
L-DOPA's therapeutic potential extends to neurodegenerative conditions such as 
Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis, Lewy body 
dementia, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, where dopamine modulation plays a 
critical role. Furthermore, L-DOPA has demonstrated efficacy in neurological 
disorders including epilepsy, peripheral neuropathy, cerebrovascular diseases, 
and traumatic brain injury, suggesting broader neurobiological applications. 
However, long-term use is associated with challenges such as motor fluctuations, 
dyskinesias, and loss of therapeutic efficacy due to progressive 
neurodegeneration and alterations in dopaminergic pathways. Recent advancements 
in drug delivery systems, combination therapies, and nanotechnology, including 
plant-derived carbon dots, offer promising strategies to enhance L-DOPA's 
effectiveness while mitigating its limitations. This comprehensive review 
explores L-DOPA's synthesis, pharmacokinetics, mechanism of action, and its 
evolving role in neurological diseases, while highlighting ongoing challenges 
and future directions for optimizing its clinical application.

The Caryocar brasiliense Camb. is a native Brazilian Cerrado species, considered 
the symbol of this biome. This tree produces a fruit known as pequi, which is 
much appreciated in Brazilian traditional culinary and is also used in popular 
medicine. However, there is still limited knowledge about the pharmaceutical 
potential of the fruit of C. brasiliense. In this study, we evaluated the 
bioactive compounds present in the lyophilized fruit pulp of C. brasiliense 
(CBFP) and investigated its antioxidant properties in vitro and in vivo, as well 
as its effects on models of Alzheimer's disease and longevity. As a main result, 
we revealed that CBFP presented phenolic and flavonoid constituents, lipophilic 
compounds, and ascorbic acid. The in vitro antioxidant activity was observed 
through free radical scavenging and DNA protection against oxidative damage. In 
the in vivo life quality assay, no signs of CBFP-induced toxicity were observed, 
and nematode viability and reproductive capacity remained unaltered. 
Furthermore, CBFP treatment delayed paralysis in the Alzheimer's disease mutant 
strain and improved locomotor capacity during aging in the wild-type strain. 
CBFP increased the lifespan of C. elegans and enhanced resistance to oxidative 
and heat stresses. Together, our findings demonstrate that CBFP exhibited 
beneficial effects on healthspan, attributed to its antioxidant properties and 
the regulation of oxidative stress.

Carnosine (β-alanyl-L-histidine) is an endogenous dipeptide known for its 
anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, making it a promising agent for 
neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD). Carnosine has shown 
protective effects against amyloid beta (Aβ)-induced oxidative stress and 
inflammation in murine microglial cells, yet its full immunomodulatory impact on 
these cells, particularly in terms of transcriptional regulation and cytokine 
interplay, remains underexplored. This study examined carnosine's effects on 
immune response markers in BV-2 cells exposed to Aβ oligomers. Specifically, 
gene expression changes in anti-inflammatory mediators (CXCL2 and IL-10) and 
phagocytic markers (CD11b, CD68, TNFα, IL-1β) were assessed. Notably, carnosine 
increased CXCL2 and IL-10 expression, promoting an anti-inflammatory response 
and enhancing microglial phagocytosis. Additionally, carnosine restored CX3CR1 
expression, a receptor implicated in Aβ- effects in murine macrophages, and 
upregulated TGF-β1 and its receptor, supporting its neuroprotective role. These 
results underscore carnosine's potential to modulate immune responses, enhance 
microglial activity, and provide neuroprotection in Aβ-induced conditions. The 
findings highlight carnosine's therapeutic promise for AD treatment, offering a 
pathway for future research on its use in neurodegenerative disease 
interventions.

INTRODUCTION: Brain-derived tau (BD-tau) measures tau specifically from 
brain-derived sources and can differentiate Alzheimer's disease (AD) from other 
diseases. This study investigated BD-tau as a potential biomarker of treatment 
effect.
METHODS: BD-tau and phosphorylated tau-217 (p-tau217) levels were measured after 
treatment with an anti-tau drug in AD and behavioral variant frontotemporal 
dementia (bvFTD) clinical trials, and the association with total tau (t-tau), 
p-tau181, and amyloid beta 42 (Aβ42) was examined.
RESULTS: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) BD-tau decreased after treatment in the AD 
cohort; however, no change was seen in bvFTD or p-tau217 in either cohort. CSF 
t-tau and p-tau181 correlated with BD-tau in AD (r = 0.9113 and 0.7746, 
p < 0.0001) and bvFTD (r = 1.0 and r = 0.79, p < 0.05). CSF BD-tau did not 
correlate with serum or plasma BD-tau in bvFTD.
DISCUSSION: CSF BD-tau shows potential as a biomarker of treatment effect in AD 
but not bvFTD. Further research is needed to investigate this effect in 
blood-based samples and in other neurodegenerative diseases. Trial registration: 
ACTRN12611001200976, ACTRN12617001218381.
HIGHLIGHTS: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) brain-derived tau (BD-tau) levels 
decreased with sodium selenate treatment in patients with Alzheimer's disease 
(AD).CSF BD-tau levels did not change with sodium selenate treatment in 
bvFTD.Baseline CSF BD-tau correlated with CSF total tau (t-tau) and 
phosphorylated tau-181 (p-tau181) in AD and behavioral variant frontotemporal 
dementia (bvFTD).Baseline serum and plasma BD-tau levels did not correlate with 
CSF BD-tau in bvFTD.CSF p-tau217 did not change with sodium selenate treatment 
in AD or bvFTD.

Alzheimer's disease, a significant health challenge predominantly affecting the 
elderly, currently lacks curative treatments, with existing therapies offering 
only symptomatic relief. This study aimed to identify herbal indole-based 
molecules with therapeutic potential against Alzheimer's disease. A 2D QSAR 
model was developed for virtual screening, identifying five promising herbal 
molecules with predicted biological activity. Molecular docking studies further 
narrowed the candidates to three molecules-Evodiamine, Hyrtinadine A, and 
Lyaloside-which exhibited superior docking scores compared to the standard drug 
Donepezil against Crystal Structure of Recombinant Human Acetylcholinesterase 
(PDB Id-4ey7). Molecular dynamics simulations validated the stability of these 
molecules' interactions with the target receptor. These findings suggest that 
Evodiamine, Hyrtinadine A, and Lyaloside hold potential as leads for developing 
effective treatments for Alzheimer's disease. Despite the encouraging insights 
obtained from the molecular docking and 2D-QSAR techniques, the study is 
constrained by the absence of in vitro and in vivo confirmation, requiring 
additional experimental assessments. To determine their therapeutic potential 
against Alzheimer's disease, future studies should concentrate on the 
pharmacokinetic profiles and preclinical evaluations of the identified lead 
compounds.

Substantial research has been conducted to identify an efficient treatment for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Existing treatments, including cholinesterase 
inhibitors and N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists, do not reverse 
or slow the disease course but only treat its manifestations. This limitation 
has brought attention to the need for treatments that modify the amyloid-beta 
(Aβ) and tau pathology of the disease. One recent advancement in AD treatment is 
donanemab, a monoclonal antibody intended to clear Aβ plaques in the brain. It 
targets pyroglutamyl(3)-Aβ protein (3-42) to remove Aβ deposits and alter the 
disease course. This review explores the timeline of donanemab use from 
discovery to clinical use. The pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of the drug 
are discussed along with typical and suboptimal preclinical and clinical trial 
results in terms of efficacy, safety, and tolerability. Thus, donanemab is more 
effective than donepezil and rivastigmine in removing plaques and improving 
cognition. At the same time, it is not devoid of safety concerns that are 
typical of the majority of amyloid-targeted medicines. The control to end the 
treatment after plaque cleaning is a unique selling point for some patients, 
making it more attractive. The innovation and development of donanemab from 
research to clinical practice are a clear representation of the role of the 
field of translational medicine in the practical application of new knowledge in 
the treatment of AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder among the 
elderly, and BuChE has emerged as a potential therapeutic target. In this study, 
we reported the development of compound 8e, a selective reversible BuChE 
inhibitor (eqBuChE IC50 = 0.049 μmol/L, huBuChE IC50 = 0.066 μmol/L), identified 
through extensive virtual screening and lead optimization. Compound 8e 
demonstrated favorable blood-brain barrier permeability, good drug-likeness 
property and pronounced neuroprotective efficacy. Additionally, 8e exhibited 
significant therapeutic effects in zebrafish AD models and scopolamine-induced 
cognitive impairments in mice. Further, 8e significantly improved cognitive 
function in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Proteomics analysis demonstrated that 8e 
markedly elevated the expression levels of very low-density lipoprotein receptor 
(VLDLR), offering valuable insights into its potential modulation of the 
Reelin-mediated signaling pathway. Thus, compound 8e emerges as a novel and 
potent BuChE inhibitor for the treatment of AD, with significant implications 
for further exploration into its mechanisms of action and therapeutic 
applications.

INTRODUCTION: Emerging evidence implicates gut microbiota dysbiosis as a key 
modulator for the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) via the gut-brain 
axis. To investigate the causal role of microbial communities in AD progression, 
we performed fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in APP/PS1 transgenic mice 
using donor microbiota from healthy wild-type mice or dextran sulfate sodium 
(DSS)-induced colitis mice.
METHODS: Cognitive function, amyloid-beta (Aβ) pathology, and pro-inflammatory 
cytokine levels were assessed in mice. 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing of gut 
microbiota and bioinformatic functional analyses were applied to identify the 
specific microbial communities potentially involved in AD progression.
RESULTS: FMT-WT mice (fecal microbiota transplantation from healthy wild-type 
mice) exhibited significant improvements in spatial memory (Morris Water Maze), 
exploratory behavior (Y-maze), and locomotor activity (Open Field Test), 
alongside reduced Aβ plaque burden and normalized expression of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α) in both gut and brain tissues. Conversely, 
FMT-DSS mice (fecal microbiota transplantation from DSS-treated donors) 
displayed exacerbated cognitive deficits, heightened Aβ deposition, and elevated 
pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. Microbial profiling revealed stark contrasts: 
FMT-WT mice harbored beneficial taxa (Bacteroides, Lachnospiraceae) linked to 
anti-inflammatory products like short-chain fatty acid, while FMT-DSS mice 
showed blooms of pathogenic genera (Erysipelatoclostridium, Enterobacteriaceae) 
associated with neurotoxic metabolites. Functional analyses predicted enrichment 
of neuroprotective pathways (e.g., lysine metabolism) in FMT-WT and 
pro-inflammatory pathways (e.g., carbon metabolism) in FMT-DSS. Crucially, 
neuroinflammation occurred independently of gut barrier disruption, implicating 
circulating microbial metabolites as key mediators.
DISCUSSION: Our findings demonstrate that gut microbiota composition 
bidirectionally influences AD progression, with FMT from healthy donors 
attenuating neuroinflammation and pathology, while colitis-associated dysbiosis 
exacerbates disease hallmarks. Our study positions microbiota-targeted therapies 
as a promising strategy to modulate AD progression through the gut-brain axis.

INTRODUCTION: Learning and memory deficits are clinical characteristics of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), often leading to diminished functionality. The 
neurotoxicant trimethyltin (TMT) is a valuable research tool for inducing 
cognitive impairment and hippocampal neurodegeneration and studying AD 
pathogenesis and treatment. Naringenin is a flavonoid with potential 
neuroprotective effects. This study sought to investigate the neuroprotective 
potential of naringenin against hippocampal neurodegeneration induced by TMT 
neurotoxicity and identify some underlying molecular mechanisms.
METHODS: Neurodegeneration was induced through an 8 mg/kg intraperitoneal 
injection of TMT, followed by oral administration of naringenin (25 and 100 
mg/kg) for 21 days. Behavioral assessments, including novel object 
discrimination (NOD), Y-maze, and passive avoidance tests, were carried out to 
evaluate cognitive functions. Biochemical assays for oxidative/nitrosative 
stress, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), inflammation, and 
acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme activity, as well as AD pathology-specific 
markers, were conducted. To further validate the results, histological 
assessments of the CA1 hippocampal region using Nissl staining and 
immunohistochemical identification of 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) were performed.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Naringenin exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of CA1 
neuronal loss and reversed TMT-induced cognitive deficits. It markedly decreased 
hippocampal levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), nitrite, tumor necrosis 
factor-alpha (TNFα), and AChE activity while enhancing catalase and superoxide 
dismutase (SOD) activities, 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) immunoreactivity, and MMP. 
Furthermore, findings demonstrated that naringenin mitigated the TMT-induced 
elevation in hippocampal levels of AD-specific proteins, including 
phosphorylated tau (p-tau), amyloid-beta (Aβ), and presenilin 1. Naringenin may 
be postulated as a promising therapeutic candidate for AD and related 
neurodegenerative conditions by mitigating oxidative and nitrosative stress, 
maintaining mitochondrial integrity, decreasing inflammation, and modulating 
pathways of neurodegeneration.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease 
characterized by progressive cognitive decline. Over 200 pathogenic mutations in 
amyloid-β precursor protein (APP), presenilin-1 (PSEN1), and presenilin-2 
(PSEN2), have been implicated in AD. Yet, many rare and common variants have not 
been completely classified as protective or benign, risk-modifiers, or 
pathogenic, which is important for research on the disease mechanisms and 
discovery of treatment methods. The majority of these variants are missense 
mutations, and there is an active need for computational approaches to 
accurately predict their molecular consequences. AlphaMissense (AM) is a novel 
technology that uses population frequency data along with structural and 
sequential contexts from AlphaFold to predict the pathogenicity of missense 
mutations. Herein, we sought to evaluate the capabilities of AM on 114 variants 
of unknown significance (VUS), including 56 missense variants of PSEN1, 25 of 
APP, and 33 of PSEN2 by benchmarking its prediction against their respective Aβ 
isoform levels in vitro, respectively. We found that the AM scores correlated 
moderately well with the critical Aβ42/Aβ40 biomarker and Aβ40 levels in the 
transmembrane proteins compared to weaker correlations in traditional 
approaches, including Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD) v1.7, 
evolutionary model of variant effect (EVE), and Evolutionary Scale Modeling-1b 
(ESM-1B). Yet, there were non-significant correlations identified with Aβ42 
levels in all models. Furthermore, we found that AM does not rely completely on 
structural contexts from AlphaFold2, as it accurately predicted the effects of 
known variants on residues with a low predicted local distance difference test 
(pLDDT) score. Additionally, based on the receiver operating characteristic-area 
under the curve analysis (ROC-AUC), we found that AM retained a high performance 
on 263 validated variants of these amyloidogenic genes, and performed the 
greatest compared to other models for the 114 VUS. We believe this is the first 
study to provide comprehensive characterization and validation of AM in 
comparison to the widely utilized pathogenicity scoring models for VUS involved 
in proteins implicated in AD.

The Flipons, Infections, and Amyloids that Foreshadow the Fading Memories of 
Alzheimer's Disease.

Herbert A(1).

Our memories are almost magical. We can experience an event for a short moment 
in time and quickly recall it decades later. This review explores the impact of 
some relatively new discoveries in the field of flipon biology that provide 
insight into diseases associated with impaired memory function. I examine how an 
ancient immune system based on Z-DNA and Z-RNA (collectively called ZNAs) 
regulates pathways that impact the memories modeled by synapses. The outcomes 
depend on intracellular defenses activated by endogenous retroelements (ERE) and 
virus, and on extracellular responses to ZNAs in bacterial biofilms. The 
bacterial amyloids and complement activation pathways further exacerbate the 
decline of cognitive and affective functions by inducing remodeling of synapses. 
In addition to immune EREs, a class of memory EREs potentially acts as 
ribotransmitters. These RNAs are transported across the synapse to program the 
connections between neurons that underlie the formation and remodeling of 
memories. Examples exist of ribotransmitters derived from ERE transcripts and 
assembled into capsids capable of transsynaptic transmission. In contrast, the 
immune EREs protect the nervous system by dismantling synapses to prevent 
viruses and retrotransposons from crossing them. The complexity of the 
interactions between memory and immune EREs likely give rise to the inverted 
U-shaped dose-response curves for the therapeutics currently available to treat 
cognitive decline. Other approaches for disease prevention are suggested, along 
with those that promote the regeneration and reprogramming of neuronal circuits.

Neuroinflammation is one of the key factors in the progression of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). Sustained overactivation of inflammation exacerbates neuronal 
damage, underscoring the need for targeted anti-inflammatory therapies. 
Biomaterials, including nanoparticles (NPs), hydrogels, implantable scaffolds, 
neural probe coatings, self-assembling biomaterials, nanofibers, and exosomes, 
offer novel approaches to modulate neuroinflammation by enabling the precise, 
localized delivery of therapeutic agents and supporting tissue repair. NPs allow 
targeted drug delivery across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), whereas hydrogels 
and scaffolds provide sustained drug release and structural support for neural 
regeneration. Emerging biomaterials, such as self-assembling peptides, 
nanofibers, and exosomes, have further enhanced the therapeutic potential of 
biomaterials. Despite promising preclinical results, translating these therapies 
to clinical settings remains challenging, particularly in terms of 
biocompatibility, stable BBB penetration, and adaptive responses to 
inflammation. This review summarizes recent advances in biomaterial-based 
therapies for neuroinflammation in neurological disorders and highlights the 
associated opportunities and challenges.

Two new glycosides, named 
3-methoxy-5-methylphenol-6-O-β-glucopyranosyl-(1→6)-β-glucopyranoside (compound 
1) and 1-O-feruloyl-α-arabinofuranosyl-(1→6)-β-glucopyranoside (compound 2), 
were isolated from Asiasarum root, together with eight known compounds. 
Asiasarum root (crude drug name in Latin: ASIASARI RADIX) is well known for its 
anti-inflammation and antitussive properties and is commonly found in Kampo 
formula in Japan. The structures of new compounds 1 and 2 were characterized 
using one- and two-dimensional (1D and 2D) NMR spectroscopy and MS. In addition, 
the anti-glycation activity of the isolates was evaluated. Glycation is 
particularly advanced in patients with diabetes and is suspected to be 
associated with diabetic complications such as nephropathy, osteoporosis, and 
Alzheimer's disease. The inhibition of this reaction is thought to be linked to 
the prevention and treatment of these diseases. Compounds 2 (79.4%), 4 (82.4%), 
5 (79.8%), 6 (86.5%), 7 (90.1%), 9 (61.4%), and 10 (82.2%) showed activities 
comparable to that of aminoguanidine (45.3%) used as a positive control.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease 
that represents the commonest movement disorder in the elderly population. PD 
neuropathology is due to the progressive deposition of mutant alpha synuclein 
(α-Syn) in the dopaminergic neurons (DNs) of the substantia nigra pars compacta 
(SNpc). Additionally, amyloid protein (Aβ) and tau protein, which are the 
hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), are also involved in PD and the 
development of PD-related dementia. Notably, α-Syn, Aβ, tau protein, and 
neuronal cholesterol metabolism are regulated by a transmembrane protein, 
low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), which is highly 
expressed in the SNpc and mediates the transmission and seeding of α-Syn in the 
brain. It has been reported that deletion of the LRP1 gene protects against the 
development and progression of PD. However, LRP1 has a neuroprotective effect 
against AD neuropathology by improving Aβ clearance across the blood-brain 
barrier (BBB) and enhancing tau protein proteolysis. Nevertheless, the exact 
role of LRP1 in PD neuropathology, mostly about α-Syn, is not completely 
explained. Therefore, this review aims to discuss and explain the role of LRP1 
in PD and how targeting neuronal LRP1 may be helpful in the management of PD. In 
this review, online databases were involved by searching Scopus, Web of Science, 
and other search engine to detect the relationship between the expression of 
LRP1 and the pathogenesis of PD.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Indian traditional medicine has long utilized 
medicinal plants for the management of chronic diseases such as Diabetes 
mellitus (DM) and related neurological complications, Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
The growing global burden of DM and its associated complications continues to 
rise; hence, it seems essential to explore effective, targeted therapies to 
mitigate their progression. Plant-based therapeutics have garnered significant 
attention for their safety, efficacy and ability to modulate multiple biological 
pathways. Indigenous medicinal plants, such as Sesbania grandiflora (L.) Poir., 
Moringa oleifera Lam., Centella asiatica (L.) Urb., Psidium guajava (L.), Aegle 
marmelos (L.) Corrêa, and Catharanthus roseus (L.) G. Don has been historically 
employed in ethnomedicine such as classical Ayurvedic texts, scientific 
literature and has a comprehensive and synergistic approach to address symptoms 
associated with DM and cognitive decline.
AIM OF THE STUDY: This review explores the interwined pathophysiological 
pathways between DM and AD, highlighting the potential of medicinal plants 
through (pre-clinical and clinical evidence), bridging the therapeutic gap. 
Additionally, we also discussed the currently used conventional antidiabetic 
drug that has been employed for managing AD.
RESULTS: In this study, six ayurvedic plants with dual activity against DM and 
AD are thoroughly reviewed with historical context, preclinical and clinical 
context. The plant's secondary metabolites have demonstrated significant 
antidiabetic and neuroprotective activities by regulating glucose metabolism, 
reducing oxidative stress, preventing amyloid-beta accumulation, etc. 
CONCLUSION: DM and AD share pathophysiology and multifaceted causes, requiring 
multi-targeted herbal remedies. The selected six Ayurveda medicinal plants 
showcase the dual benefits for both diseases. The obstacles, such as stability, 
pharmacokinetics, and safety, remain substantial barriers; addressing these 
challenges could constrain the clinical translation. This review demands further 
research to address the challenges to facilitate the effective integration of 
traditional medicinal knowledge with contemporary practice.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaque deposition and neurofibrillary 
tangles, which collectively drive neuroinflammation, synaptic dysfunction, and 
cognitive decline. Here, we investigated whether a peptide epitope vaccine 
targeting the Aβ1-10 sequence could mitigate Aβ-induced pathology in AD mouse 
model. Three Aβ1-10 peptides, i.e. Aβ1-10-N, Aβ1-10-D1H, and Aβ1-10-S8R were 
synthesized, and Aβ1-10-S8R was further conjugated to ovalbumin (OVA) or keyhole 
limpet hemocyanin (KLH) to enhance immunogenicity. Among seven treatment groups, 
Aβ1-10-D1H and Aβ1-10-S8R, particularly when conjugated to OVA or KLH, 
effectively suppressed Aβ, amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP), and 
beta-secretase 1 (BACE-1) expression, decreased inflammatory cytokine production 
by astrocytes and microglia, and increased the levels of key synaptic markers 
(synaptophysin, synaptosomal-associated protein 23 [SNAP-23], postsynaptic 
density protein 95 [PSD-95]). Carrier protein conjugation also elevated 
immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels in the spleen, indicative of a robust humoral 
response. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that Aβ1-10-based 
immunization, especially with OVA or KLH conjugation, reduces Aβ-driven 
neuroinflammation, synaptic dysfunction, and memory deficits, suggesting a 
promising immunotherapeutic strategy for AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia. Mitochondrial 
dysfunction is recognized among the earliest pathological events in AD, and is 
closely-linked with the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques which is a 
well-established hallmark of AD. The interplay between the two converges on the 
interaction of Aβ with the mitochondrial enzyme Aβ-binding alcohol dehydrogenase 
(ABAD), and the formation of Aβ-ABAD complex. This leads to the suppression of 
the normal function of ABAD, and elicits a number of detrimental events such as 
the excessive generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulting in apoptosis 
of neuronal cells. To intercept the Aβ-ABAD interaction, a decoy peptide (DP) 
was employed, and was loaded into polymeric chitosan nanoparticles (CSNPs) for 
efficient delivery across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In vivo studies on 
control and neuroinflammatory mouse models confirmed that NPs of the smaller 
size (SNPs; 59 ± 6 nm) accumulated in the brain with minimal off-target 
delivery. Unlike free DP, DP-loaded SNPs significantly improved cognitive 
functions as depicted by the modified Y-maze test. The DP also had protective 
effects on the mitochondria that were associated with a decrease in Aβ, an 
increase in ATP and a normalization in SOD activity. Additionally, the 
restoration of ABAD normal function was reflected by elevated estradiol levels. 
These findings indicate that the inhibition of Aβ-ABAD complex ameliorates 
Aβ-induced toxicity in AD, consequently enhancing both mitochondrial and 
cognitive functions.

The rapid separation and detection of neuronal-derived small extracellular 
vesicles (EVs) in plasma is essential for diagnosing and monitoring the 
progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we present a magnetic 
separation-assisted visual analysis strategy for detecting Aβ42-positive EVs 
(Aβ42+ EVs) using a nanozyme-catalyzed colorimetric sensor. EVs are first 
captured from plasma using Fe3O4@SiO2 core-shell nanoparticles functionalized 
with CD63 aptamers (Fe3O4@SiO2-AptCD63). Au@Pt nanozymes, modified with Aβ42 
aptamers (Au@Pt-AptAβ42), then bind to the Aβ42 protein on the EVs, forming a 
sandwich structure (Fe3O4@SiO2-EVs-Au@Pt NPs). This structure catalyzes the 
oxidation of the substrate 3,3',5,5'-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), generating 
visual signals. The sensor demonstrates high sensitivity, with a detection range 
of 1 × 105 to 1 × 109 particles/mL and a low detection limit of 7.2 × 104 
particles/mL. It was successfully used to detect Aβ42+ EVs in plasma samples 
from AD patients, showing significant promise for early AD diagnostics in 
clinical settings.

Asparagus racemosus Willd, an Ayurvedic medicine, is known for its antioxidant, 
antiviral, immune-boosting, and neuro-nutraceutical benefits, particularly in 
female health. However, its metabolites, mechanisms of action, and target 
proteins are yet to be fully understood. The present study aimed to identify the 
metabolite constitution and metabolite-associated proteins in neuroprotective 
mechanisms in neurodegenerative disease. Mass spectrometry-based untargeted 
metabolomics and network pharmacology approaches were used to identify 
metabolites in A. racemosus root extract. In vitro studies, including oxidative 
stress regulation, neuronal apoptosis, and western blot analysis, were conducted 
to assess the plant's impact on Alzheimer's disease (AD). We identified 44,014 
spectra in positive and negative modes, corresponding to 31,931 non-redundant 
metabolites at the MS1 level and 5,608 at the MS2 level, from A. racemosus root 
extract, which include metabolites belonging to phenols, lipids, flavonoids, 
isoprenoids, and fatty acyls. Novel and known compounds were identified, such as 
asparagine, sitosterol, arginine, muzanzagenin, pinene, flavone, and kaempferol. 
Network pharmacology predicted 44 potential human protein targets linked to 
Alzheimer's disease from these metabolites. These proteins belong to 
neuromodulator classes, including BACE1, CHRM3, APP, MAP2K1, GSK3B, and TNF, and 
some of the metabolites of A. racemosus including muzanzagenin interact with 
BACE1 protein. In vitro validation showed that A. racemosus regulates ROS 
levels, apoptosis pathways, and BACE1 expression in Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
highlighting its therapeutic potential. This study integrates network 
pharmacology and metabolomics, paving the way for clinical research into the 
neuropharmacological effects of A. racemosus on neurological disorders.

BACKGROUND: The age-standardized prevalence of Alzheimer's disease in Asia has 
increased rapidly in recent years. Disease-modifying treatments that can slow 
disease progression are now becoming available for patients with early-stage 
Alzheimer's disease, including those with mild cognitive impairment. However, 
challenges in diagnosis and assessment for these patients remain.
OBJECTIVES: This study characterized the care pathway for mild cognitive 
impairment due to Alzheimer's disease in Asia, including barriers to care, and 
considered the future treatment landscape, with the aim of making 
recommendations for optimizing the care pathway in readiness for the 
availability of new disease-modifying treatments.
DESIGN: Qualitative study based on semi-structured interviews.
SETTING: Interviews were conducted with physicians in general/tertiary hospitals 
in Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, 
Taiwan, and Thailand. Physicians from mainland China and Japan were not 
included.
PARTICIPANTS: Physicians managing patients with mild cognitive impairment.
MEASUREMENTS: Number and/or proportion of participants providing a given 
response, and numerical estimates provided by interview participants.
RESULTS: Forty-four physicians, primarily neurologists (n = 31; 70.5 %), were 
interviewed. Participants managed a median of 67.5 patients with mild cognitive 
impairment per month, of whom 24.0-87.5 % had mild cognitive impairment due to 
Alzheimer's disease. Clinical investigations routinely comprised brief 
neuropsychological assessments, such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (n = 
41), as well as neurological tests (n = 39) and magnetic resonance imaging (n = 
40). Except in Korea, comprehensive neuropsychological test batteries and 
amyloid positron emission tomography were seldom conducted in Asia. Most 
patients with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease were treated 
with nootropics and/or acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (Korea, 96 %; all other 
regions, 69 %), and almost all were recommended a non-pharmacological treatment 
(Korea, 93 %; all other regions, 100 %). Detection of mild cognitive impairment 
due to Alzheimer's disease was considered prompt in Korea but suboptimal in 
other regions (n = 16) owing to low disease awareness among patients. Barriers 
to assessment and diagnosis included delayed healthcare visits for initial 
assessment (n = 7), neuroimaging backlogs (n = 6), and insufficient 
neuropsychology resources (n = 13). Access to amyloid biomarker tests, including 
amyloid positron emission tomography, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and blood 
tests, was limited in regions other than Korea.
CONCLUSIONS: The survey findings showed that screening and diagnostic processes 
for mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease in Asia require further 
optimization. Efforts should also be made to educate patients and caregivers, 
improve the diagnostic capabilities of primary and secondary healthcare 
providers, and reinforce cognitive screening services. The provision and 
reimbursement of confirmatory tests of amyloid burden should be expanded across 
the region to facilitate access to innovative disease-modifying therapies.

BACKGROUND: Transcranial photobiomodulation (tPBM), as a novel non-invasive 
neurostimulation technique, has shown the compelling potential for improving 
cognitive function in aging population. However, the potential mechanism remains 
unclear. Neuroimaging studies have found that tPBM-induced physiological changes 
exist in both targeted and non-targeted brain areas, suggesting the necessity of 
understanding the modulation mechanism from the perspective of the whole brain 
level.
OBJECTIVE: This randomized, single-blind, sham-controlled crossover study aimed 
to investigate the hypothesis that tPBM improved working memory in healthy older 
adults through the mechanism of optimizing the properties of the resting-state 
functional brain networks.
METHODS: A total of 55 right-handed healthy older adults were randomly assigned 
to sham tPBM session group or active tPBM session group. After a washout 
interval, they were assigned to the opposite intervention session. Each session 
included the following: active or sham tPBM application with a 1064-nm laser to 
the left forehead; before and after, resting-state functional near-infrared 
spectroscopy (fNIRS) measurements; and the digital n-back task. Differences in 
accuracy and reaction time of the n-back task, and changes in functional 
connectivity and graph metrics of the brain networks were investigated and 
compared between the active and sham tPBM sessions. In addition, correlations 
between tPBM-induced changes in functional brain networks, and the n-back task 
were examined.
RESULTS: The results showed that compared with the sham tPBM session, the 
accuracy and reaction time during 3-back task significantly improved in the 
active tPBM session. In addition, the global efficiency, local efficiency, nodal 
efficiency, and functional connectivity significantly increased in the active 
tPBM session, particularly in the frontoparietal areas. Importantly, the altered 
3-back accuracy was positively correlated with the changes of functional 
connectivity and nodal efficiency mainly in left prefrontal cortex in those who 
had increased 3-back accuracy in the active tPBM session.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that tPBM may serve as an effective tool to 
improve working memory in older adults through the modulation of resting-state 
functional brain network properties. Investigations in large-scale samples are 
needed to further validate the findings of this study.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative 
disease characterized by muscle weakness and atrophy, with limited treatment 
options. The accumulation of misfolded proteins, such as misfolded superoxide 
dismutase 1 (mSOD1), contributes significantly to neuronal degeneration in ALS. 
Therapies targeting misfolded proteins represent a promising strategy. 
Baicalein, a flavonoid compound with neuroprotective properties, has shown 
efficacy in clearing misfolded proteins and improving behaviors in rodent models 
of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. However, its effects in ALS remain 
largely unexplored. This study demonstrated that baicalein treatment reduced 
total and misfolded SOD1 protein levels in both soluble and insoluble fractions 
of a motor neuron cell line overexpressing mutant SOD1. Baicalein also reduced 
intracellular SOD1 aggregates in cultured motor neurons transfected with 
SOD1/G93A, preserving neurite length. In an ALS mouse model expressing the 
SOD1/G93A transgene, baicalein treatment decreased mSOD1 aggregation, increased 
spinal motor neuron density, and reduced neuromuscular junction denervation. 
Furthermore, baicalein partially improved motor behaviors, as assessed by the 
rotarod test. These findings highlight baicalein's potential as a therapeutic 
agent for ALS, targeting intraneuronal misfolded proteins to ameliorate 
pathological changes and preserve motor function.

OBJECTIVES: Neurofilament light chain (NfL) conventionally reflects disability 
worsening in multiple sclerosis (MS), but does not necessarily imply MS-specific 
mechanisms and could be affected by biological or pathological aging, including 
Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology. We aim to evaluate clinical correlates of 
plasma NfL (pNfL) in elderly patients with MS, and its associations with AD 
plasma biomarkers.
METHODS: We recruited consecutive people with MS >65 years, and collected 
expanded disability status scale (EDSS), current disease modifying treatment 
(DMT) and years of exposure to DMTs. Cognitive function was assessed using the 
Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), the California Verbal Learning Test-II 
(CVLT-II), and the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised (BVMTR). Plasma 
biomarkers (Aβ40, Aβ42, p-Tau181, and pNfL) were measured using LUMIPULSE assay 
kits on the CLEIA analyser LUMIPULSE G600II.
RESULTS: We included 83 elderly adults (age 68.8 ± 3.1 years; females 65.8 %) 
with MS (EDSS 5.5 (2.0-8.0)). On linear regression models adjusted for age, sex, 
BMI, smoking status, and cardiovascular risk factors, there were no associations 
between pNfL and EDSS, type and duration of DMT exposure, SDMT, CVLT, and BVMRT. 
Higher pNfL was associated with lower plasma Aβ40 (Coeff = -0.40; 
95 %CI = -0.66, -0.14; p = 0.003), plasma Aβ42 (Coeff = -4.46; 95 %CI = -7.92, 
-1.00; p = 0.01), and Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio (Coeff = -2612.06; 95 %CI = -4114.76, 
-1109.36; p = 0.001). Also, lower Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio was associated with impaired 
CVLT (Coeff = -0.021; 95 %CI = -0.036, -0.006; p = 0.007).
INTERPRETATION: pNfL in elderly people with MS is associated with biomarkers of 
amyloid accumulation, which in turn are associated with cognitive impairments, 
suggesting overlapping pathologies between MS and AD.

The development of therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) has long been 
constrained by the limitations of single-target strategies. Based on the core 
pathological features of AD-the cascade amplification effects of β-amyloid (Aβ) 
transcellular transport and mitochondrial dysfunction-combined with recent 
breakthrough discoveries: ① In vivo observation of tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) 
formation in the cerebral cortex of mouse models, ② Aβ-induced TNTs formation, ③ 
TNTs-mediated intercellular propagation of Aβ pathology, ④ TNTs-driven 
compensatory transfer of functional mitochondria between cells, this review 
proposes an innovative dual-directional regulatory strategy that precisely 
targets the molecular mechanisms of TNTs to simultaneously suppress Aβ 
pathological propagation and enhance mitochondrial rescue in diseased cells. By 
systematically elucidating: ① The molecular mechanisms underlying TNTs-mediated 
specific transport of Aβ and functional mitochondria, ② The molecular basis for 
directional regulation of TNTs transport, this strategy aims to develop 
potential therapeutic agents for AD, offering a novel intervention paradigm to 
overcome the current therapeutic impasse in AD treatment.

Although the menopausal transition causes a panoply of unpleasant and disruptive 
symptoms, many women are reluctant to use estrogen-based treatments due to risks 
of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and stroke. As we learn more about how 
estrogens regulate the cellular and circuit mechanisms underlying menopausal 
symptoms such as hot flashes and brain fog, drug development that specifically 
targets these mechanisms could provide the therapeutic benefits of estrogens 
without adverse health effects. This review discusses the rationale for 
targeting estrogen receptor beta (ERß) with highly selective synthetic agonists 
to alleviate two common menopausal symptoms: memory dysfunction and hot flashes. 
We begin by reviewing the history of estrogen-based menopausal hormone therapy, 
including conjugated equine estrogens and related products. We then describe the 
neurobiological mechanisms underlying estrogenic regulation of memory and hot 
flashes, with a particular focus on the role of ERß. Finally, we discuss past 
and current clinical trials of ERß agonists and highlight pre-clinical data 
showing that a highly potent and selective synthetic ERß agonist can enhance 
object recognition and spatial memory, and reduce a drug-induced hot flash, in 
mouse models of ovarian hormone loss and Alzheimer's disease. Collectively, this 
work supports the targeted development of highly selective ERß agonists to 
relieve memory and vasomotor symptoms of menopause.

Neuroinflammation is caused by various factors, such as the activation of glial 
cells, the excessive release of chemokines and cytokines, and the accumulation 
of blood cells in the brain parenchyma. The inflammatory processes occur in 
acute and chronic phases, with traumatic brain injuries triggering the release 
of neurotoxins from CNS-specific glial cells. Furthermore, activation of 
microglia, astrocytes, and mast cells worsens the situation by producing 
pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and glia maturation factors. Chronic 
activation of astroglia and microglial cells promotes loss of neurons, memory, 
and impaired learning capacity, leading to neurodegenerative disorders such as 
Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis. These implications have led to a rational search for 
inflammatory druggable targets. Based on various preclinical and clinical 
studies, NSAIDs (aspirin, ibuprofen, diclofenac, and mefenamic acid), SSRIs 
(fluoxetine and sertraline), antipsychotics (risperidone), corticosteroids 
(dexamethasone), antidiabetics (metformin and rosiglitazone), and statins 
(simvastatin and atorvastatin) have exhibited promising results. These drugs 
have anti-inflammatory and neuromodulation activities that enhance 
neuroplasticity and effectively manage neurodegenerative symptoms. In addition, 
non-pharmacological interventions such as art creation and physical exercise 
have been linked with improving neural development and stimulating the 
production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, which can attenuate disease 
progression and promote synaptic plasticity. Hence, it is imperative to 
understand the complex interplay between glial cells, inflammatory signalling 
and neural pathways. We reviewed the interconnected pathways between 
neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Moreover, recommendations for 
pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions to address these issues 
are discussed herein.

Neuroprotective properties of silicon have been reported, particularly in 
mitigating dementia and Alzheimer's disease due to its ability to reduce 
aluminum bioavailability. However, its potential as a nutritional adjuvant in 
reducing brain damage associated with hypercholesterolemia and central insulin 
resistance (IR) in late-stage type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) remains 
unexplored. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of silicon-enriched meat 
(Si-RM) on the brain cortex of T2DM rats. Rat models of early-stage-T2DM (ED) 
(n = 8) and late-stage-T2DM (LD) (n = 16) were induced by high-saturated fat 
diet and high-saturated fat high-cholesterol diet plus 
streptozotocin/nicotinamide injection, respectively. A control meat (C-RM) was 
included in the diet of both ED and LD groups. Finally, after confirming 
hyperglycemia in LD rats, the C-RM was replaced by Si-RM in half of the animals 
for the last five weeks of the study, obtaining the LD-Si group (n = 8), while 
the other half continued eating C-RM. In LD rats pathological outcomes included: 
harmful oxysterol profile, decreased antioxidant defenses, neuroinflammation, 
brain IR, augmented glucose uptake and impaired cholinergic transmission. Si-RM 
consumption ameliorates these key outcomes by reducing brain levels of 
pro-oxidant oxysterols (25-OHC and 27-OHC) to levels of ED rats. Antioxidant 
defenses, including SOD and arylesterase activity, were enhanced, and 
inflammatory markers, such as GFAP, IL6, and TNFα, were reduced compared to LD 
and ED counterparts. Notably, silicon restored brain insulin signaling, 
normalized glucose uptake via GLUT3, and shifted to an acetylcholine-preserving 
profile, significantly mitigating neurodegenerative risks. This study 
demonstrates for the first time that silicon, provided as a functional dietary 
ingredient of meat-products, exhibited a capacity to partially counteract brain 
cortex metabolic damage caused by T2DM.

Early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is crucial for enabling 
timely intervention and improving patient outcomes. Recent advancements in 
molecular and imaging methodologies have significantly enhanced the detection of 
Alzheimer's disease at its early stages and have improved the quality of 
research in the field. Key molecular approaches include the identification of 
biomarkers such as amyloid-beta plaques and tau protein tangles, which are 
central to Alzheimer's disease pathology. These biomarkers can be detected 
through biofluid analysis or imaging methods, offering high sensitivity, however 
with disadvantages, which are discussed here. Despite the transition of some of 
these methods from research settings to clinical practice, several challenges 
persist, including the need for standardisation across diagnostic platforms and 
ensuring the accessibility of these advanced technologies within diverse 
healthcare systems. Additionally, the high cost and requirement for specialised 
expertise remain significant barriers. Here, we discuss the need to improve the 
effectiveness of early AD diagnosis, the ongoing research that is being 
conducted to refine biomarker detection, enhance imaging techniques and develop 
more cost-effective non-invasive diagnostic approaches. These advancements are 
essential to overcoming current limitations and ensuring a broader application 
in clinical settings.

As important immune cells in innate immunity, natural killer (NK) cells are 
closely associated with the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Hypoxia has 
been considered as a critical factor that influences AD development, but the 
regulating effects and underlying mechanisms of hypoxic NK cells in AD 
progression have not been studied. Herein, our study illustrated that hypoxic NK 
cells-derived exosomes ameliorated AD progression by delivering 
hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α). Specifically, AD models APP/PS1 mice and 
β-amyloid (Aβ)-treated HT22 cells were subjected to exosomes from NK cells 
cultured under normoxic (Nor-exo) or hypoxic (Hyp-exo) conditions. Compared to 
Nor-exo, Hyp-exo alleviated mice cognition damage, reduced the levels of p-Tau, 
P16, and P53, and senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal) to suppress 
cellular senescence, downregulated Bax and upregulated Bcl-2 to suppress 
apoptotic cell death, and decreased MDA levels and increased GSH/GSSG ratio to 
initiate anti-oxidant effects in both APP/PS1 mice brain tissues and Aβ-treated 
HT22 cells. Moreover, antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) obviously mitigated 
Aβ-triggered senescence and apoptosis in HT22 cells. Interestingly, our 
mechanical experiments confirmed that HIF-1α was especially enriched in Hyp-exo 
compared to Nor-exo, and the following rescue experiments verified that Hyp-exo 
exerted its protective effects in AD models by delivering HIF-1α. In conclusion, 
Hyp-exo HIF-1α-dependently suppressed oxidative stress-related neuronal cell 
senescence and apoptosis to mitigate pathogenesis of AD, and our study might 
provide new theoretical basis for developing treatment methods for AD.

This study investigates the therapeutic advantages of agomelatine in the context 
of Alzheimer's disease (AD) using a mouse model, with twenty healthy male SWR/J 
mice participating in the research. Many approaches were employed to evaluate 
the effectiveness of the treatments; these approaches included body weight 
analysis, evaluations of short-term memory, biomarker assessments, 
histopathological examinations, and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) 
spectroscopy. The results suggest that agomelatine treatment effectively 
countered the weight loss associated with AD. Importantly, agomelatine enhanced 
cognitive performance, as indicated by improved short-term memory in spatial 
recognition assessments; mice treated with agomelatine showed spontaneous 
alternation percentages comparable to controls, with statistically significant 
differences observed between AD and control groups (Dunn's post-hoc p = 0.0072). 
Analyses of biomarkers showed that agomelatine reduced the AD-induced elevation 
of acetylcholinesterase activity, interleukin-6 levels, and oxidative stress 
markers while increasing total antioxidant capacity. Histopathological 
assessments showed enhanced structural integrity in hippocampal regions. FTIR 
spectroscopy revealed agomelatine's protective effect on brain molecular 
structure, mainly through preserving lipid order in the CH stretching region and 
preventing protein oxidation in the C = O spectral range, both of which are 
typically altered by AD pathology. These results emphasize the efficacy of 
agomelatine and support its consideration in mitigating symptoms associated with 
AD etiology.

PURPOSE: Among visually Tau-PET-positive scans, large variation exists in the 
size of the visually tau-positive area. Here, we propose a metric quantifying 
the spatial extent of visual Tau-PET-positivity, termed "TAU-SPEX", and evaluate 
associations with visual read status, neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology at 
autopsy, and cognition.
METHODS: [18F]flortaucipir data from 1,645 participants (aged 71.9 ± 8.2 years, 
50.3% females) from four cohorts were visually read as positive or negative. 
TAU-SPEX was calculated as the percentage of gray matter voxels with 
suprathreshold Tau-PET uptake (using a threshold identical to that used for 
visual reading) in a spatially unconstrained whole-brain mask. We additionally 
computed Tau-PET SUVr in a whole-brain and temporal meta-region. We tested the 
performance of TAU-SPEX for distinguishing visually tau-negative from 
tau-positive participants and for distinguishing participants with and without 
NFT Braak-V/VI pathology at autopsy (n = 18), and tested associations of 
TAU-SPEX with concurrent and longitudinal cognition. The performance of TAU-SPEX 
was compared to SUVr.
RESULTS: TAU-SPEX demonstrated strong performance in distinguishing tau-negative 
from tau-positive participants (AUC: 0.97). Moreover, TAU-SPEX showed high 
accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative 
predictive value (all > 0.90) for identifying tau-positive participants, and 
showed high sensitivity (87.5%) and specificity (100.0%) for identifying 
participants with NFT Braak-V/VI pathology. TAU-SPEX was moderately associated 
with concurrent (β=-0.36 [-0.29, -0.43], p < 0.001) and longitudinal (β=-0.19 
[-0.15, -0.22], p < 0.001) cognition. Across analyses, TAU-SPEX generally 
outperformed SUVr.
CONCLUSION: TAU-SPEX was strongly associated with visual read, NFT Braak-V/VI 
pathology and cognition, and might be useful in clinical settings as a potential 
adjunct to [18F]flortaucipir visual interpretation.

Tauopathies are characterized by the aggregation and accumulation of 
hyperphosphorylated tau proteins that correlates with cognitive impairment in 
affected individuals. The presence of tauopathy follows a temporospatial 
spreading pattern in which certain neuronal cell types in specific brain regions 
are more vulnerable to tau accumulation and atrophy. However, the mechanisms 
underlying the selective vulnerability of these neurons and regions to 
pathological tau accumulation are not fully understood. Here, we characterized 
the presence of phosphorylated tau in excitatory and inhibitory neurons in 
post-mortem prefrontal cortex of tauopathy patients, including Alzheimer's 
disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, and 
frontotemporal lobar dementia due to a MAPT mutation. We observed that neuronal 
tau accumulation across these tauopathies occurs predominantly in excitatory 
neurons compared to inhibitory neurons. Next, we performed viral translating 
ribosome affinity purification (vTRAP) from vulnerable and resistant brain 
regions on vGLUT1CRE+ and GAD2CRE+ PS19 mice to understand molecular signatures 
of tau vulnerability. We observed that both vulnerable regions and 
vulnerable neurons are characterized by alterations in synaptic transmission and 
neuronal excitability. Transcription factor Mef2c (myocyte enhancer factor 2c) 
was identified as an upstream regulator affecting myelination and synaptic 
organization in vulnerable brain regions in PS19 mice. The relevance of these 
findings was validated in human tauopathies via coexpression network analysis. 
Concordantly, we observed tau-induced changes in spontaneous postsynaptic 
currents of excitatory neurons in mice especially in the prefrontal cortex. 
Taken together, we conclude that selective vulnerability to tau could arise from 
changes in neurotransmission and synaptic compositions, potentially due to an 
altered Mef2c transcriptional network.

Targeting together cholinesterases and serotonin reuptake against Alzheimer's 
disease.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by 
cognitive decline and memory loss, with limited therapeutic options. Traditional 
treatments primarily focus on acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs), which 
aim to increase acetylcholine levels in the brain, and selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which modulate serotonin levels. However, these 
treatments often provide only modest symptom relief. This review explores the 
potential benefits of combined targeting of cholinesterases and serotonin 
reuptake as a novel therapeutic strategy for AD. We discuss the 
pathophysiological role of acetylcholine and serotonin in AD, highlighting their 
impact on cognitive function, mood regulation, and neuroplasticity. By targeting 
both cholinergic and serotonergic systems, this dual approach may offer 
synergistic effects, improving cognitive function, reducing neuropsychiatric 
symptoms, and enhancing neuroprotective mechanisms. The review also examines 
preclinical and clinical studies investigating the efficacy of combination 
therapies and outlines the challenges and opportunities in their development. 
Ultimately, this combined targeting approach holds promise for providing more 
effective and comprehensive treatment options for AD, addressing both cognitive 
and behavioural symptoms associated with the disease.

BACKGROUND: Older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) 
are frequently hospitalized with ambulatory care-sensitive conditions (ACSCs). 
Disparities in ACSC hospitalizations have been documented, but the impact of the 
COVID-19 pandemic on ACSC hospitalizations and disparities of older adults with 
ADRD is unclear, particularly, across different racial, ethnic, and 
socioeconomic groups. This study examined changes in ACSC hospitalizations among 
community-dwelling older adults with ADRD before and during the pandemic and how 
these changes vary by race, ethnicity, and Medicare-Medicaid dual eligibility 
status.
METHODS: This observational study linked Medicare data with publicly available 
sources. The study sample included Medicare fee-for-service community-dwelling 
older adults aged 65 and older with ADRD in 2019 or 2021. The primary outcome 
was whether an individual had any ACSC hospitalizations in a given year (0/1). 
Secondary outcomes included any non-COVID-19-related hospitalizations and death 
(0/1). We used linear probability models with zip-code random effects, 
accounting for individual and community characteristics.
RESULTS: The study included 2.35 million beneficiaries in 2019 and 1.85 million 
in 2021. Non-COVID-19-related hospitalizations decreased from 24.0% in 2019 to 
20.4% in 2021, while ACSC hospitalizations fell from 23.0% to 19.0% among those 
who were hospitalized. In 2019, Black and Hispanic individuals had 2.0 and 1.6 
percentage points higher probabilities of ACSC hospitalization (p < 0.001), 
respectively, compared to White individuals, and dual-eligibles had a 2.8 
percentage-point higher probability than non-dual-eligibles (p < 0.001). During 
the pandemic, overall hospitalizations and ACSC hospitalizations decreased, with 
dual-eligibles experiencing an additional 2.1 percentage-point reduction in ACSC 
hospitalizations(p < 0.001). Meanwhile, dual-eligibles experienced a 1.5 
percentage-point increase in mortality rate in 2021 compared to 2019 
(p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Racial and ethnic minorities and the socioeconomically disadvantaged 
older adults with ADRD were more likely to experience ACSC hospitalizations 
compared to their counterparts before the pandemic.

Repetitive Head Impacts (RHI) in boxing may increase the risk for neuronal 
damage. We evaluated blood-based biomarkers for neurodegeneration and 
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathology, clinical features, and MRI biomarkers in 
former professional boxers compared to patients with AD or patients with 
subjective cognitive decline (SCD). Nine former boxers were compared to 
age-matched patients (without single TBI or RHI) with biomarker confirmed AD 
(N = 15) or SCD (N = 14). Plasma samples were analyzed for amyloid beta (Aβ)42, 
Aβ42/40 ratio, phosphorylated tau (p-tau)181, p-tau217, glial fibrillary acidic 
protein (GFAP) and neurofilament light (NfL) concentrations. Brain MRI images 
were processed through Freesurfer to compute disease-related regions-of-interest 
(ROIs) for AD, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), or chronic traumatic 
encephalopathy (CTE). Cognitive performance was assessed in memory and executive 
functioning (EF) domains. Five boxers had follow-up measurements after ~ 7 
years. Former boxers had higher plasma GFAP, p-tau181 and p-tau217 than patients 
with SCD, lower volumes in all pre-specified disease-related brain regions. No 
differences on neuropsychological test scores between boxers and those with SCD 
were observed. Longitudinal analysis in the boxer group demonstrated elevation 
of plasma NfL and p-tau181 over time. The current study suggests the presence of 
biological processes indicative for neurodegeneration in former boxers, without 
evident clinical decline. Plasma GFAP, p-tau181 and p-tau217 may be promising 
biomarkers for indicating risk for neuronal damage following RHI.

Neurodegenerative diseases and serious mental illnesses often exhibit 
overlapping characteristics, highlighting the potential for shared underlying 
mechanisms. To facilitate a deeper understanding of these diseases and pave the 
way for more effective treatments, we have generated a population-scale 
multi-omics dataset consisting of genotype and single-nucleus transcriptome data 
from the prefrontal cortex of frozen human brain specimens. Encompassing over 
6.3 million nuclei from 1,494 donors, our dataset represents a diverse range of 
neurodegenerative and serious mental illnesses, including Alzheimer's and 
Parkinson's diseases, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and diffuse Lewy body 
dementia, as well as neurotypical controls. Our dataset offers a unique 
opportunity to study disease interactions, as 21% of donors had comorbid 
diagnoses of two or more major brain disorders. Additionally, it includes 
detailed phenotypic information on neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as apathy and 
weight loss, which commonly accompany Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. 
We have performed stringent preprocessing and quality controls, ensuring the 
reliability and usability of the data. As a commitment to fostering 
collaborative research, we provide this valuable resource as an online 
repository, enabling widespread analyses across the scientific community.

Cerebral glucose hypometabolism has been consistently associated with 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). With extensive efforts to eliminate AD pathologies, 
including the removal of amyloid-β ​(Aβ) plaques and hyperphosphorylated Tau, 
strategies aimed at restoring glucose metabolism in the brain regions most 
affected by AD are believed to have significant clinical implications. In this 
study, we demonstrated that glucose hypometabolism preceded neuronal death in 
triple-transgenic AD (3xTg-AD) mice, likely attributable to reduced expression 
of glucose transporter type 1 (GLUT1) or glucose transporter type 3 (GLUT3). 
Furthermore, we observed aberrant activation of the integrated stress response 
(ISR) pathway in AD models, with Aβ and Tau phosphorylation contributing to the 
activation of the ISR and subsequent reduction in GLUT1/3 expression. Inhibiting 
ISR activation by utilizing the ISR inhibitor ISRIB can effectively restore 
GLUT1/3 expression in both in vitro and in vivo models. Importantly, ISRIB 
treatment improved cognitive function and brain glucose metabolism in 3xTg-AD 
mice. Our findings suggest that targeting the ISR pathway to restore GLUTs 
expression may be a potential therapeutic strategy for AD.

Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), traditionally known for regulating gonadal 
development, maturation, and estrogen secretion, has now been implicated in 
regulating fat and bone metabolism and cognition. Preclinical evidence from 
genetic and pharmacological studies in rodent models, combined with human data 
from population-based observations, genetic studies, and a limited number of 
interventional trials, supports the notion of independent effects of FSH on the 
skeleton, fat, and brain. This evolving understanding of the nonreproductive 
roles of FSH presents potential therapeutic opportunities to mitigate 
age-related health challenges, which include osteoporosis, obesity, 
cardiovascular risk, and dementia. This review summarizes the current knowledge 
on the interplay between pituitary-derived FSH and peripheral and central 
tissues, as well as recent progress in therapeutic development.

With the introduction of the new causal amyloid targeting therapies, the role of 
biomarker-assisted diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD) has received a further 
boost. In addition to the well-established gold standard, amyloid PET imaging, 
cerebrospinal fluid diagnostics are currently being suggested for therapy 
inclusion and patient selection. In addition, new types of blood-based 
biomarkers are being introduced, holding diagnostic potential together with 
potentially easy and broad accessibility in the future. In addition to the 
introduction of new biomarkers and new therapeutic approaches, the guidelines 
for biomarker-based classification of AD are also in flux, sometimes clustering 
biomarker classes and neglecting their individual characteristics, leading to 
divergent or controversial discussions. It is difficult to keep pace with these 
rapid developments, and the respective roles of the various AD biomarkers have 
not yet been clearly defined. Thus, in this paper, we attempt to discuss the 
strengths and weaknesses of the various imaging and fluid biomarkers of AD and 
classify what we consider to be their complementary, nonredundant value for 
various diagnostic questions. We propose an integrated biomarker algorithm for 
the purpose of reliable AD patient selection for amyloid targeting therapies.

Frontotemporal degeneration (FTD) is a group of neurodegenerative disorders 
affecting behaviour, language and executive functions. FTD is a common cause of 
early-onset dementia, but there are no FDA-approved treatments or established 
biomarkers for diagnosing and tracking these conditions, making early and 
accurate diagnosis challenging during life. Recent advances in retinal imaging, 
particularly through technologies like optical coherence tomography (OCT), have 
emerged as promising tools for identifying potential biomarkers for FTD and 
related neurodegenerative diseases. The retina, being an accessible extension of 
the central nervous system, has shown abnormalities that might serve as 
indicators of forms of FTD. Retinal imaging has revealed changes such as 
thinning of specific retinal layers that could correlate with molecular forms of 
FTD, Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. These advances 
highlight the potential of retinal imaging to not only aid in diagnosis but also 
differentiate between various neurodegenerative conditions. Emerging data on 
retinal tissue analysis with immunohistochemistry and other techniques further 
support the potential of retinal biomarkers, though further studies are required 
to validate and refine these findings. Future advancements in retinal imaging 
technologies, along with longitudinal and autopsy-validated studies, are crucial 
for enhancing diagnostic capabilities and understanding FTD-related pathologies 
within the retina.

Episodic memory deteriorates with age and in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). 
Interventions to enhance memory in these cohorts are limited and associated with 
disadvantages inherent in pharmaceuticals and in the cost/availability of formal 
cognitive enhancement programmes. Here we tested whether an autobiographical 
retrieval task could enhance performance in a separate word-list recognition 
task. The RESTED-AD Study (Remote Evaluation of Sleep To enhance understanding 
in Early Dementia) was a cohort study comprising individuals with AD MCI/early 
dementia and age-matched healthy controls (HC). Participants completed a word 
recognition task twice, with learning and test phases separated by sleep. On one 
occasion, participants wrote down 5 autobiographical events occurring in their 
day before bedtime (Autobiographical Condition). Episodic memory accuracy was 
compared in the Autobiographical vs Standard Condition. Sleep was recorded 
utilising a home-based EEG headband. Twenty-six participants (AD = 8, HC = 18, 5 
Female) had mean (SD) age of 70.0 (6.6), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment Score 
of 26.1 (2.4). Full cohort accuracy score increased in the Autobiographical 
Condition [% Mean (SD) Standard = 82.0 (11.0), Autobiographical = 86.4 (8.1), 
Cohen's D = 0.452, p = 0.024]. This relationship maintained after correction for 
confounding variables and task order. After False Discovery correction, no 
evidence was found to support sleep-mediated mechanisms. Autobiographical memory 
evocation was positively associated with recognition memory performance in older 
adults and individuals with AD. As an intervention with no foreseeable risks, 
replication of this finding and further work to establish underlying mechanisms 
is warranted.

In recent years, important progress has been made in the study of the 
pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, especially the role of protein 
misfolding and aberrant aggregation in the development of diseases has attracted 
much attention. As a class of zoonotic infectious neurodegenerative diseases 
caused by prion protein misfolding and aggregation, prion diseases, with their 
unique transmission characteristics, have provided important insights for the 
study of other neurodegenerative diseases. A growing body of research has shown 
that similar abnormal protein aggregation phenomena occur in common 
neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's 
disease (PD). These misfolded proteins exhibit striking similarities to prions 
in terms of seeding capacity, cytotoxicity, and propagation properties. Further 
investigation into the prion-like behavior of these aberrant proteins in 
neurodegenerative diseases can offer new directions for diagnosis and treatment. 
Recent studies have demonstrated that AD can be transmitted through medical 
routes, which warns us that neurodegenerative diseases are potentially 
infectious and deserve further attention and research. This article 
systematically reviews the pathological features and transmission mechanisms of 
abnormal proteins in prion diseases and other neurodegenerative disorders, 
aiming to provide a new perspective for the prevention and treatment of these 
diseases. Moreover, this research holds significant implications for public 
health and clinical practice. By revealing the potential transmissibility of 
neurodegenerative diseases, it can help improve medical protocols and reduce the 
risk of iatrogenic transmission.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a highly prevalent, chronic, irreversible, 
neurodegenerative disorder occurring mostly in the later stages of life. Due to 
the inadequacies of the currently existing treatments, newer targeting 
strategies are necessary for the early detection, prevention, and treatment of 
AD. Thioredoxin-interacting protein [TXNIP, also called Thioredoxin Binding 
protein 2 (TBP-2)] is a multifunctional protein that is involved in various 
signaling pathways like NLRP3/ROS, keap1-Nrf2 and NF-Κb -mediated inflammation 
and Aβ deposition, ER stress-apoptosis pathway, p38 MAPK-activation causing tau 
hyperphosphorylation and brain insulin signaling in AD. The present review 
discusses the role of TXNIP in the pathogenesis of AD and explores TXNIP as a 
potential therapeutic target for AD. Further, the significance of oxidative 
stress and inflammation in AD pathogenesis and their regulation by TXNIP in AD 
have been discussed.

The β-secretase β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is a major drug target for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Clinically tested BACE1 inhibitors induced unexpected 
cognitive side effects that may stem from their cross-inhibition of the 
homologous protease BACE2. Yet, little is known about BACE2 functions and 
substrates in vivo, and no biomarker is available to monitor the extent of BACE2 
inhibition in vivo, particularly in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). To identify a 
potential CSF biomarker for monitoring BACE2 activity, we analyzed the CSF 
proteome changes in non-human primates after treatment with a BACE1-selective 
inhibitor (a brain-targeted monoclonal antibody) in comparison to verubecestat, 
a clinically tested small-molecule drug inhibiting both BACE1 and BACE2. Acute 
treatment with either the antibody or verubecestat similarly reduced CSF 
abundance of the cleavage products of several known BACE1 substrates, including 
SEZ6, gp130, and CACHD1, demonstrating similar target engagement in vivo. One 
CSF protein, vascular cell adhesion protein 1 (VCAM-1), was only reduced upon 
inhibition with verubecestat, but not upon BACE1-selective inhibition with the 
antibody. We conclude that VCAM-1 is a promising biomarker candidate for 
monitoring BACE2 inhibition in CSF, which is instrumental for the development of 
BACE1-selective inhibitors for the prevention of AD.

Due to the existence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the complicated 
pathological mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease (AD), current therapeutic 
approaches for AD show limited efficacy. To overcome these challenges, a 
multi-strategy drug delivery system (SA-BP-MB/BBR NPs) was developed: 
photothermal conversion polydopamine nanoparticles (PDA NPs) were decorated with 
sialic acid-modified bovine serum albumin (SA-BSA) to prepare SA-modified and 
BSA-stabilized PDA NPs (SA-BP NPs) for targeting the BBB and co-loaded with 
photosensitizer methylene blue (MB) and berberine (BBR) to target multiple 
neuropathological factors, including Aβ aggregation and tau 
hyperphosphorylation. The prepared SA-BP-MB/BBR NPs had spherical morphology 
with a uniform particle size of 143.43 nm and PDI of 0.095. Drug loading 
capacities were 6.98 % for MB and 3.50 % for BBR. Our investigations 
demonstrated that the cellular uptake efficiency of biocompatible SA-BP-MB/BBR 
NPs increased by 1.74 times when combined with photothermal and photodynamic 
therapy, which effectively inhibited Aβ aggregation, Aβ fibril depolymerization, 
and tau hyperphosphorylation. Pharmacokinetics and in vivo biodistribution 
studies revealed a higher area under the curve (AUC0-t) of SA-BP-MB/BBR NPs 
(9.75 and 7.52 times higher) than free MB and BBR, and SA modification promoted 
brain accumulation. Overall, SA-BP-MB/BBR NPs have the potential to be an 
effective treatment for AD.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's Disease (ad) patients often experience clinically 
significant agitation, leading to distress, increased healthcare costs and 
earlier institutionalisation. Current treatments have limited efficacy and 
significant side effects. Cannabinoid-based therapies, such as the nabiximols 
oral spray (Sativex®; 1:1 delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol), offer 
potential alternatives. We aimed to explore the feasibility and safety of 
nabiximols as a potential treatment for agitation in ad.
METHODS: The 'Sativex® for Agitation & Aggression in Alzheimer's Dementia' 
(STAND) trial was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, feasibility 
study conducted in UK care homes. Participants with probable ad and predefined 
clinically significant agitation were randomised to receive placebo or 
nabiximols for 4 weeks on an up-titrated schedule, followed by a 4-week 
observation period. To be considered feasible, we prespecified the following 
thresholds that needed to be met: randomising 60 participants within 12 months, 
achieving a ≥ 75% follow-up rate at 4 weeks, maintaining ≥80% adherence to 
allocation and estimating a minimum effect size (Cohen's d ≥ 0.3) on the 
Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory. This trial is registered with ISRCTN 
7163562.
FINDINGS: Between October 2021 and June 2022, 53 candidates were assessed; 29 
met eligibility criteria and were randomised. No participants withdrew, and 
adherence was high (100%) and was generally feasible to deliver. The 
intervention was well tolerated (0 adverse reactions), with no safety concerns 
reported.
INTERPRETATION: Despite significant COVID-19 pandemic related challenges, 
administering nabiximols through oral mucosa to advanced ad patients with 
agitation demonstrated feasibility and safety. These findings support a larger 
confirmatory efficacy trial to evaluate the potential therapeutic efficacy of 
nabiximols for agitation in ad.

Impairment of Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle (TCA) Cycle in Alzheimer's Disease: 
Mechanisms, Implications, and Potential Therapies.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition defined by the gradual 
impairment of cognitive functions, synaptic disarray, and extensive neuronal 
loss. Emerging evidence suggests that metabolic impairment, specifically within 
tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, is instrumental in the AD pathophysiology. TCA 
cycle represents an indispensable pathway in metabolism that is responsible for 
energy production, and the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, particularly in 
neurons. Several in vitro, clinical, and in vivo studies reported that several 
TCA cycle enzymes disrupt during AD. Disruption in TCA cycle enzymes exhibits 
more pronounced impact on the brain owing to its high metabolic activity and 
continuous demand for energy, where any reduction in ATP production can severely 
impair neuronal function, synaptic plasticity, and overall cognitive processes. 
The current review explores the mechanisms underlying AD related impairment in 
TCA cycle, focussing on the molecular alterations of TCA enzymes. We also 
discussed potential activators and inhibitors of TCA cycle enzymes as a 
potential therapeutic intervention to restore AD related metabolic balance.

AIMS: Few longitudinal studies have explored Oral Glucose Tolerance Test markers 
(OGTT) and both cognitive and brain changes. We investigated OGTT and other 
glycaemia and insulin resistance markers, and cognitive and neuroimaging changes 
in the Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and 
Disability (FINGER).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: At-risk individuals aged 60-77 years without dementia 
(N = 1259) were randomly enrolled in a 2-year multidomain lifestyle intervention 
or regular health advice program. 1025 participants without previously diagnosed 
diabetes underwent OGTT. Brain MRI scans were available for 132 participants and 
amyloid (PiB)-PET and FDG-PET scans for 47. Cognition was assessed using the 
modified Neuropsychological Test Battery (mNTB).
RESULTS: Higher baseline dysglycaemia measures, particularly those from the 
OGTT, were connected to less favourable changes in multiple cognitive measures 
and hippocampal volume. Higher baseline triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index was 
associated with higher amyloid accumulation and decline in brain glucose 
metabolism. Higher baseline glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) was related to 
favourable changes in processing speed and cortical thickness. There were no 
significant intervention-control differences in the change in glycaemia markers. 
Baseline dysglycaemia and glycaemia-related markers did not modify the 
previously reported intervention benefits on cognition.
CONCLUSIONS: Higher baseline dysglycaemia measures are linked to more 
deleterious changes in cognition. Specifically, OGTT measures may be the most 
sensitive for detecting subtle glycaemic abnormalities associated with both 
unfavourable cognitive and neuroimaging changes. However, HbA1c shows mixed 
associations with cognition and neuroimaging in people at risk of dementia 
without previously diagnosed diabetes. This study emphasises the importance of 
more accurate glucose-related markers when investigating early stages of glucose 
metabolism abnormalities and their relationship to subtle cognitive impairment 
and its structural brain correlates.

This study aimed to investigate the mechanism of ginsenoside Rg1 in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) via miR-9-5p/SIRT1-mediated mitochondrial function. The cognitive 
function of AD mice was assessed by Morris water maze experiment. The 
histopathological changes in the CA1 region were observed by H&E staining. TUNEL 
staining combined with the neuronal marker NeuN was used to detect neuronal 
apoptosis in hippocampal tissues. Aβ1-42 induced HT-22 cells were used as AD in 
vitro models. MiR-9-5p expression was detected by qRT-PCR, and SIRT1 protein and 
autophagy-related proteins (LC3B II/I, Beclin-1) levels were measured by western 
blot. The binding of miR-9-5p with SIRT1 was predicted and validated. 
Ginsenoside Rg1 treatment in AD mice reduced miR-9-5p expression, increased 
SIRT1 level, attenuated mitochondrial dysfunction, and effectively improved AD 
symptoms in mice, while such effect can be either reversed by miR-9-5p agomir or 
SIRT1 inhibitor (EX527). In vitro, Aβ1-42-induced HT-22 cell activity was 
reduced, cell death was significantly increased, and mitochondrial dysfunction 
was progressed, but treatment of HT-22 cells with Aβ1-42 and ginsenoside Rg1 
attenuated mitochondrial dysfunction and improved Aβ1-42-induced HT-22 cell 
damage. Ginsenoside Rg1 ameliorated Aβ1-42-induced HT-22 cell damage by 
down-regulating miR-9-5p to regulate SIRT1-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction. 
miR-9-5p negatively regulates SIRT1. Inhibition of mitochondrial autophagy 
partially reversed the ameliorative effect of ginsenoside Rg1 on mitochondrial 
dysfunction and cellular damage in HT-22 cells. Ginsenoside Rg1 down-regulates 
miR-9-5p expression to modulate SIRT1-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction, hereby 
attenuating Aβ1-42 induced cell injury in HT-22 cells and alleviating AD in 
mice.

Current therapies for sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD) provide only 
symptomatic relief, underscoring the need for treatments targeting its 
underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Given the shared features between sAD 
and type 2 diabetes mellitus-particularly insulin resistance-repurposing 
antidiabetic agents like metformin has gained interest. Previous studies show 
that metformin rapidly reaches the brain following intranasal (i/n) 
administration and remains detectable for at least 2 h at a 3 mg/kg dose, 
supporting this delivery route for central nervous system targeting. I/n 
delivery of therapeutic agents bypasses the blood-brain barrier, enhances brain 
bioavailability, and minimizes peripheral side effects of such agents. In this 
preclinical study, we investigated whether low-dose i/n metformin (1 and 
3 mg/kg) administered for 28 days could halt sAD-type changes. Our results 
demonstrate that i/n metformin improved cognitive function, including social 
behavior, in an intracerebroventricular streptozotocin (3 mg/kg)-induced rat 
model of sAD. Metformin administered i/n also reduced hippocampal microgliosis 
and apoptosis and enhanced phosphorylation of Akt and adenosine 
monophosphate-activated protein kinase. Moreover, it decreased hippocampal 
glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta levels, suggesting modulation of insulin 
signaling pathways. Notably, these neuroprotective effects were achieved at 
doses much lower than those used with systemic administration, underscoring the 
advantages of i/n delivery. Our findings suggest that low-dose i/n metformin is 
a promising, non-invasive, and disease-modifying therapeutic strategy for sAD, 
warranting further investigation.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents a significant global health challenge due to 
its complex pathophysiology and limited therapeutic options. Traditional drug 
discovery methods have had limited success, highlighting the need for innovative 
strategies. This systematic review evaluates the role of molecular docking, 
virtual screening, and molecular dynamics simulations in the early stages of AD 
drug discovery. This study reviewed 100 studies published between 2000 and 2024, 
focusing on computational approaches to identify and optimize drug candidates 
targeting key AD-related proteins, including acetylcholinesterase (AChE), 
β-secretase (BACE1), and tau. Both natural and synthetic compounds were 
examined, emphasizing studies integrating in silico methods with in vitro and in 
vivo validations. AChE was the most frequently targeted protein (23 studies), 
followed by BACE1 and multi-target approaches. The compounds investigated 
varied, with 35 studies focusing on natural products (e.g., quercetin, huperzine 
A) and 54 on synthetic analogs (e.g., tacrine derivatives). Integrating 
computational and experimental methods enhanced the validation process, 
providing comprehensive insights into the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics 
of potential therapeutics. Computational approaches significantly expedite the 
identification and optimization of AD drug candidates by enabling the rapid 
screening of extensive compound libraries. These methods, when combined with 
experimental validations, offer deeper molecular-level insights into drug 
interactions and mechanisms. However, challenges such as predictive accuracy and 
data quality remain, necessitating further advancements in computational models 
and data integration to improve the predictability and effectiveness of AD 
therapeutics.

PURPOSE: We aimed to determine whether commonly recommended CVD risk equations 
would inform a risk-benefit discussion on the role for aspirin as a primary 
prevention strategy for CVD in older persons. We assessed aspirin's effect on 
CVD and major haemorrhage on the basis of baseline levels of CVD risk using risk 
scores pertaining to the older age groups.
METHODS: We used a) the Framingham (FRS), b) the Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular 
Disease (ASCVD), and c) the European SCORE2-OP equations to calculate 10-year 
predicted CVD risk. Participants were classified into predicted risk tertiles 
(T): lower (T1), intermediate (T2) and higher (T3) risk. We identified CVD and 
major haemorrhagic events utilising each risk equation's definition of CVD.
RESULTS: The CVD event rate increased from T1 to T3 using all risk equations. 
For participants with greatest CVD risk (T3) according to FRS and ASCVD, aspirin 
versus placebo was associated with a proportional 28% (95% CI: 54 to 95%) and 
25% (95% CI: 57 to 97%) reduction in CVD risk respectively. However, there was 
no significant effect of aspirin for individuals with low (T1) or moderate (T2) 
risk, nor according to the SCORE2-OP tertiles.Rates of major haemorrhagic events 
were highest in all T3 groups. Aspirin was associated with a significant 
increase in bleeding events versus placebo in all T1 groups and FRS and 
SCORE2-OP T2 groups. The reduction in CVD events in FRS and ASCVD T3 groups was 
offset by a 32% and 15% increased risk of bleeding respectively.
CONCLUSION: In older persons with no prior cardiovascular events, current CVD 
risk scores do not identify any subgroups with overall net clinical benefit from 
low dose aspirin.

Plain Language Summary: Current widely used CVD risk scores do not inform the 
risk-benefit discussion on aspirin treatment for primary prevention in older 
persons as whilst they can identify those at highest CVD risk they fail to 
identify any group in whom the net clinical benefit favours aspirin treatment.

Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) are considered a worldwide health concern that 
influences a large portion of the aging population. Recently, oxidative 
stress-mediated pyroptosis has emerged as an innovative therapeutic approach for 
many NDs including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, we aimed to examine the 
potential neuronal anti-pyroptotic activity of vanillin (VA) and to investigate 
the molecular mechanisms through which VA may ameliorate brain injury induced in 
rats including its effects on oxidative stress and pyroptosis, which play major 
roles in the pathogenesis of several NDs including AD. Neurotoxicity was induced 
in rats by two subcutaneous injections of isoproterenol (ISP) (100 mg kg-1). ISP 
intervention lasted only two days, where the interval between each injection was 
24 hours. After that, the rats were treated with VA (100 mg kg-1 day-1, orally 
via gavage) for four weeks. ISP provoked neuronal oxidative stress that was 
characterized by elevated brain contents of reactive oxygen species (ROS), 
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 4 (NOX4) and malonaldehyde 
(MDA) along with decreased brain contents of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), glutathione 
(GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Furthermore, ISP increased the brain mRNA 
levels of thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), nod-like receptor-pyrin 
domain-containing 3 (NLRP3), apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing 
a CARD (ASC), and caspase-1 in addition to the brain contents of TXNIP, NLRP3, 
ASC, cleaved caspase-1, gasdermin D-N terminal (GSDMD-N), interleukin-18 (IL-18) 
and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), resulting in pyroptosis. Treatment with VA 
ameliorated ISP-induced oxidative stress, pyroptosis and histopathological 
changes via SIRT1/NOX4/ROS/TXNIP/NLRP3 signaling. Our findings suggest a novel 
therapeutic value for VA in ameliorating neurotoxicity via targeting oxidative 
stress-mediated pyroptosis.

Retinal vasculopathy with cerebral leukoencephalopathy and systemic 
manifestations (RVCL-S) is an incurable microvascular disease caused by 
C-terminus truncation of the TREX1 exonuclease. There is a pressing need to 
understand disease mechanisms and identify therapeutic targets. We evaluated 
TREX1 sequencing data from 469 229 UK Biobank participants together with 
RVCL-S-related microvascular clinical and imaging outcomes. We show that 
mono-allelic truncating mutations in TREX1 require intact nuclease activity in 
order to cause endothelial disease. Differential proteomics identifies loss of 
interaction with endoplasmic reticulum insertion proteins such as Guided Entry 
of Tail-Anchored Proteins Factor 3 as a major consequence of pathogenic TREX1 
truncation, and this altered trafficking results in the unregulated presence of 
enzymatically active TREX1 in the nucleus. In endothelial cells with a patient 
mutation, mislocalized yet enzymatically active TREX1 causes accumulation of a 
spectrum of DNA damage. These pathological changes can be rescued by inhibiting 
exonuclease activity. In summary, our data implicate exonuclease-dependent DNA 
damage in endothelial cells as a key therapeutic target in the pathogenesis of 
RVCL-S.

INTRODUCTION: The extent to which Alzheimer's disease (AD) concerns relate to 
pathological changes in cognitively unimpaired populations is unclear.
METHODS: We analyzed screening data from the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in 
Asymptomatic Alzheimer's (A4) study to determine if AD concerns are associated 
with amyloid burden in cognitively unimpaired older adults, and how they relate 
to lifestyle. AD concerns were measured using the six-item Concerns about 
Alzheimer's Disease Questionnaire. Regression estimated the association of AD 
concerns with amyloid burden, adjusting for covariates.
RESULTS: Of 4460 individuals, AD concerns were elevated in women, people with a 
dementia family history, apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 carriers, and individuals 
who did not meet walking or sleep guidelines. AD concerns were associated with 
higher amyloid burden (β [95% CI] = 0.002 [0.001-0.003], p = 0.007), with 
stronger effects in APOE ε4 carriers.
DISCUSSION: AD concerns were associated with a core diagnostic AD biomarker. 
Assessing AD concerns could inform future recruitment strategies. Clinical 
Registration Trial:: ClinicalTrials.gov: ID NCT02008357.
HIGHLIGHTS: Alzheimer's disease (AD) concerns were associated with higher 
amyloid burden. AD concerns were associated with higher depressive symptoms in 
apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 carriers. Concerns were associated with a lower 
likelihood of meeting daily walking guidelines. Associations were stronger in 
APOE ε4 carriers compared to non-carriers.

INTRODUCTION: Plasma biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) represent accessible 
alternatives to positron emission tomography (PET) and cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF)-based biomarkers in well-characterized cohorts. It remains to be 
determined whether performance is maintained in outpatient clinics comprised of 
patients with multiple causes of cognitive impairment.
METHODS: Plasma phosphorylated tau217 (p-tau217) and amyloid beta (Aβ) 42/40 
were measured in 509 patients evaluated in a tertiary-care memory clinic. 
Biomarker performance was compared across diagnoses, referencing established 
cutpoints for positive and negative biomarkers.
RESULTS: Plasma p-tau217 distinguished patients with diagnoses of symptomatic AD 
with 95% sensitivity and 82% specificity. Integration of Aβ42 measurements 
(p-tau217/Aβ42) incrementally improved specificity (86%). Plasma p-tau217 and 
p-tau217/Aβ42 concentrations closely associated with established CSF biomarkers 
of AD (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.94 and 0.96, respectively). Reduced kidney 
function associated with elevated plasma p-tau217 and p-tau217/Aβ42 
concentrations in patients without AD (referencing CSF biomarkers).
DISCUSSION: Plasma p-tau217 and p-tau217/Aβ42 concentrations demonstrated robust 
diagnostic performance in a heterogeneous clinical cohort; interpretation 
requires consideration of kidney function.
HIGHLIGHTS: Plasma phosphorylated tau217 (p-tau217) reliably identified clinic 
patients with Alzheimer's disease. A two-cutpoint strategy yielded definitive 
results in 86% of patients. Integration of plasma amyloid beta (Aβ; 
p-tau217/Aβ42) minimally improved diagnostic performance. Plasma p-tau217 levels 
were increased in patients with kidney dysfunction.

Serum tyrosine and phenylalanine levels increase during aging and age-associated 
disorders. We previously showed that tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrRS/YARS1) is 
reduced in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) brains, and tyrosine and phenylalanine 
decrease TyrRS in neurons. Here, we found that tau is a negative regulator, 
whereas estrogen and leucine act as positive regulators of TyrRS. Young female 
mice exhibit increased TyrRS in the cortex compared to male mice. Notably, young 
Tau knockout male, but not female mice showed increased cortical TyrRS. Tau 
accumulation in middle-aged female mice did not decrease cortical TyrRS compared 
to males, suggesting that middle-aged females are resilient to tau-mediated 
TyrRS depletion. Tyrosine and phenylalanine treatment decreased tubulin 
tyrosination, activated DNA repair pathways, and protected against etoposide 
(ETO) and camptothecin (CPT)-induced toxicity, respectively, in neurons. While 
tyrosine facilitated topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) recruitment to chromatin and 
inhibited global transcription, in contrast, phenylalanine recruited 
topoisomerase 2 beta (TOP2β) to chromatin and stimulated global transcription. 
Furthermore, tyrosine decreased the presence of DNA fragments in a comet assay 
whereas phenylalanine increased them. Addition of cis-resveratrol (cis-RSV) 
protected against tyrosine-induced transcription inhibition by facilitating the 
recruitment of both TOP1 and TOP2β to chromatin and increasing tubulin 
tyrosination. Moreover, cis-RSV decreased both total and phosphorylated tau and 
protected neurons against amyloid beta (Aβ)-induced neurite degeneration and DNA 
damage. Gene expression profiling using human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived 
neurons demonstrated that cis-RSV is a broad-spectrum neuroprotective and 
anti-viral agent. In contrast, trans-RSV mimics phenylalanine-induced gene 
expression, including downregulation of long genes and induction of an AD-like 
gene expression signature. This work suggests that age and disease-associated 
increases in serum tyrosine and phenylalanine levels would activate neuronal DNA 
repair while inhibiting transcription and tubulin tyrosination. cis-RSV protects 
against their toxicity by restoring tubulin tyrosination, TOP1 and 
TOP2β-mediated transcription, and decreasing tau in primary neurons.

BACKGROUND: Dementia complicates care transitions, such as discharge from heart 
failure hospitalization to a skilled nursing facility (SNF) and then to home. 
Transitional care management (TCM), a bundled service that includes telephone 
communication within 2 business days and an office visit within 14 days, 
potentially addresses this problem.
METHODS: We analyzed trends in TCM among Medicare beneficiaries with dementia 
hospitalized for heart failure in 2013-2017, comparing hospital-home discharges 
to hospital-SNF-home discharges. We then used a retrospective cohort study to 
estimate the risk-adjusted association of TCM with successful discharge home.
RESULTS: TCM occurred in 45 (2.3%) of 1990 eligible hospital-SNF-home discharges 
in year 2013, increasing to 205 (9.8%) of 2095 eligible in year 2017. In a 
cohort of 11,376 hospital-SNF-home transitions, the relative risk (95% CI) of 
successful community discharge was 1.24 (1.11-1.40) with TCM compared with no 
office visit within 14 days of discharge or TCM.
CONCLUSIONS: Persons with dementia transitioning from heart failure 
hospitalization to SNF to home receive TCM less frequently than persons 
discharged directly home from the hospital. Nonetheless, TCM is associated with 
successful discharge in this vulnerable group of patients.

Inflammasomes, particularly the NLRP3 inflammasome, play a pivotal role in 
mediating neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), 
multiple sclerosis (MS), and Huntington's disease (HD). Recent findings indicate 
that the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in microglia and astrocytes 
triggers the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β and IL-18, 
which contribute to chronic inflammation and neuronal damage. This process 
accelerates neurodegeneration and exacerbates disease progression. Misfolded 
protein aggregates, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress are key 
factors in the pathological activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in these 
diseases. Recent studies have highlighted that targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome, 
either through direct inhibitors like MCC950 or natural compounds such as 
oridonin and β-hydroxybutyrate, shows promise in mitigating neuroinflammation 
and protecting neuronal integrity. These inhibitors have demonstrated 
neuroprotective effects in animal models of AD, PD, and MS, presenting a new 
therapeutic approach for halting disease progression. However, the complexity of 
NLRP3 regulation requires further investigation to balance its inflammatory and 
protective roles. This review examines the recent advancements in NLRP3 
inflammasome research and discusses potential strategies for modulating 
inflammasome activity to slow or prevent the progression of neurodegenerative 
diseases.

Estradiol treatment enhances neurovascular coupling independent of metabolic 
health status in a mouse model of menopause.

Plumley ZM, Calvo Iglesias J, Fernandez Ugidos I, Walker AB, Pires Dos Santos I, 
Taylor H, Mostany R.

The loss of ovarian estrogen during the menopause transition has been identified 
as a risk factor for increased cardiometabolic and neurovascular dysfunction, 
age-related cognitive decline, and Alzheimer's disease. A wealth of studies 
using rodent models of menopause have highlighted the cardio- and 
neuroprotective effects of 17β-estradiol (E2) treatment when administered within 
a critical period, though these have yet to be successfully translated to human 
populations in clinical trials of hormone therapy. A proposed explanation for 
this mismatch in results is the "healthy cell bias," where estrogen is only 
beneficial when initiated in physiologically intact systems. Our study 
investigates whether pre-existing metabolic dysfunction attenuates the effects 
of E2 on neurovascular coupling (NVC) in a rodent model of menopause. Female 
mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or control diet (CD) for 11 weeks to induce 
metabolic dysfunction, followed by ovariectomy (OVX) and subsequent E2 or 
vehicle (Veh) treatment. NVC was assessed in awake mice using two-photon laser 
scanning microscopy of penetrating arterioles (PAs) in the somatosensory cortex, 
barrel field. Mice developed glucose intolerance and increased adiposity yet 
displayed intact NVC following 11 weeks of HFD exposure. Following ovariectomy, 
E2 treatment enhanced NVC responses regardless of diet. Interestingly, in 
HFD-fed mice, E2 appeared to reduce basal PA diameter relative to Veh, 
suggesting health status-specific mechanisms of action. These results indicate 
that PAs retain functional sensitivity to estrogen treatment in the face of 
metabolic impairment, which has implications for the use of hormone therapy in 
women that arrive at the menopause transition with varied pre-existing 
cardiometabolic disorders.

There is little understanding of how aging serves as the strongest risk factor 
for several neurogenerative diseases. Specific neural cell types, such as 
microglia, undergo age-related maladaptive changes, including increased 
inflammation, impaired debris clearance, and cellular senescence, yet specific 
mediators that regulate these processes remain unclear. The aged brain is 
rejuvenated by youth-associated plasma factors, including tissue inhibitor of 
metalloproteinases 2 (TIMP2), which we have shown acts on the extracellular 
matrix (ECM) to regulate synaptic plasticity. Given emerging roles for microglia 
in these processes, we examined the impact of TIMP2 on microglial function. We 
show that TIMP2 deletion exacerbates microglial phenotypes associated with 
aging, including transcriptomic changes in cell activation, increased 
microgliosis, and increased levels of stress and inflammatory proteins measured 
in the brain extracellular space by in vivo microdialysis. Deleting specific 
cellular pools of TIMP2 in vivo increased microglial activation and altered 
myelin phagocytosis. Treating aged mice with TIMP2 reversed several phenotypes 
observed in our deletion models, resulting in decreased microglial activation, 
reduced proportions of proinflammatory microglia, and enhanced phagocytosis of 
physiological substrates. Our results identify TIMP2 as a key modulator of 
age-associated microglia dysfunction. Harnessing its activity may mitigate 
detrimental effects of age-associated insults on microglia function.

Physical activity and mobility are critical for healthy aging and predict 
diverse health outcomes. While wrist-worn accelerometers are widely used to 
monitor physical activity, estimating gait metrics from wrist data remains 
challenging. We extend ElderNet, a self-supervised deep-learning model 
previously validated for walking-bout detection, to estimate gait metrics from 
wrist accelerometry. Validation involved 819 older adults (Rush-Memory- 
and-Aging-Project) and 85 individuals with gait impairments (Mobilise-D), from 
six medical centers. In Mobilise-D, ElderNet achieved an absolute error of 8.82 
cm/s and an intra-class correlation of 0.87 for gait speed, outperforming 
state-of-the-art methods (p < 0.001) and models using a lower-back sensor. 
ElderNet outperformed (percentage error; p < 0.01) competing approaches in 
estimating cadence and stride length, and better (p < 0.01) classified mobility 
disability (AUC = 0.80) than conventional gait or physical activity metrics. 
These results render ElderNet a scalable tool for gait assessment using 
wrist-worn devices in aging and clinical populations.

The age-associated neurodegenerative disorder, Lewy body dementia (LBD), 
encompasses neuropsychiatric symptom-overlapping Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) 
and Parkinson's Disease with Dementia (PDD). We characterised how differential 
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) profiles contribute to neurotype-specific 
neurodegeneration and thereby clinicopathological heterogeneity, between LBD's 
syndromes. We further characterised key nuclear-encoding genes' recalibrations 
in response to such mtDNA changes. In post-mortem 'single-cell' acetylcholine- 
and noradrenaline-producing neurons, respectively of the pedunculopontine 
nucleus (PPN) and locus coeruleus (LC) from DLB, PDD and neurological-control 
brains, we quantified 'major arc'-locating mtDNA deletions (mtDels) and -copy 
number (mtCN), and measured mRNA levels of nuclear-encoding genes regulating 
mtDNA maintenance, -biogenesis and mitophagy. DLB cases' OXPHOS defect 
instigating mtDel burden was higher in both neurotypes than PDD. In DLB, mtCN 
was reduced for both neurotypes, but PDD cases revealed mtDNA depletion in 
LC-noradrenergic neurons only. DLB patients' shorter survival correlated with 
PPN-cholinergic neurons' mtDel levels, inversely with wild-type mtCN, implying 
that such neurons' inability to maintain sufficient wild-type mtDNA content 
drive DLBs' rapid psycho-cognitive manifestations. Contrastingly, PDD's longer 
disease duration allowed compensation against mtDels' clonal expansion in 
PPN-cholinergic neurons. Moreover, PDD induced mRNA depletion of a mitochondrial 
genome maintenance gene in PPN-cholinergic neurons, whilst LC-noradrenergic 
neurons displayed reduced expression of a mitophagy regulating gene. Here we 
identify mitochondrial genome maintenance and mitophagy pathway enrichment as 
therapeutic targets to offset defective mtDNA within pontine cholinergic and 
noradrenergic neurons of PDD patients. The pronounced LBD subtype-related 
mitochondria-nuclear genetic differences question the consensus that pathology 
converges at disease end-stage, calling for LBD subtype and neurotype-specific 
therapeutics.
