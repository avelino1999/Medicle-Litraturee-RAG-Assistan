Elucidating the genetic contributions to Parkinson's disease (PD) etiology 
across diverse ancestries is a critical priority for the development of targeted 
therapies in a global context. We conducted the largest sequencing 
characterization of potentially disease-causing, protein-altering and splicing 
mutations in 710 cases and 11,827 controls from genetically predicted African or 
African admixed ancestries. We explored copy number variants (CNVs) and runs of 
homozygosity (ROHs) in prioritized early onset and familial cases. Our study 
identified rare GBA1 coding variants to be the most frequent mutations among PD 
patients, with a frequency of 4% in our case cohort. Out of the 18 GBA1 variants 
identified, ten were previously classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic, 
four were novel, and four were reported as of uncertain clinical significance. 
The most common known disease-associated GBA1 variants in the Ashkenazi Jewish 
and European populations, p.Asn409Ser, p.Leu483Pro, p.Thr408Met, and 
p.Glu365Lys, were not identified among the screened PD cases of African and 
African admixed ancestry. Similarly, the European and Asian LRRK2 
disease-causing mutational spectrum, including LRRK2 p.Gly2019Ser and 
p.Gly2385Arg genetic risk factors, did not appear to play a major role in PD 
etiology among West African-ancestry populations. However, we found three 
heterozygous novel missense LRRK2 variants of uncertain significance 
overrepresented in cases, two of which-p.Glu268Ala and p.Arg1538Cys-had a higher 
prevalence in the African ancestry population reference datasets. Structural 
variant analyses revealed the presence of PRKN CNVs with a frequency of 0.7% in 
African and African admixed cases, with 66% of CNVs detected being compound 
heterozygous or homozygous in early-onset cases, providing further insights into 
the genetic underpinnings in early-onset juvenile PD in these populations. Short 
tandem repeat analysis also identified ATXN3 repeat expansions within the 
pathogenic range (CAGn > 45) in three PD patients of African ancestry. Novel 
genetic variation overrepresented in cases versus controls among screened genes 
warrants further replication and functional prioritization to unravel their 
pathogenic potential. Here, we created the most comprehensive genetic catalog of 
both known and novel coding and splicing variants potentially linked to PD 
etiology in an underserved population and further conducted global and local 
ancestry analyses to further explore population-specific effects. Our study has 
the potential to guide the development of targeted therapies in the emerging era 
of precision medicine. By expanding genetics research to involve 
underrepresented populations, we hope that future PD treatments are not only 
effective but also inclusive, addressing the needs of diverse ancestral groups.

INTRODUCTION: ABvac40 is an investigational active immunotherapy (vaccine) 
targeting Aβ40. This study assessed the safety and immunogenicity of ABvac40 in 
patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment or very mild Alzheimer's 
disease.
METHODS: AB1601 was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
phase 2 study. Patients (n = 124) received five monthly injections plus a 
10-month booster of ABvac40 or placebo, with 18-24 months of follow-up. Primary 
endpoints included safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity. Secondary endpoints 
assessed immune response, neuropsychological changes, and disease biomarkers.
RESULTS: Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and serious TEAEs were 
comparable between ABvac40 (90.6% and 26.6%) and placebo (93.3% and 26.7%). 
Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities-hemorrhage (ARIA-H) were similar (12.5% 
ABvac40; 15.0% placebo), with no ARIA-edema (ARIA-E) or 
meningoencephalomyelitis. ABvac40 induced a specific, sustained immune response 
in plasma, with detectable antibodies in CSF.
DISCUSSION: These findings support further investigation of ABvac40 as a 
potential disease-modifying therapy.
CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT03461276 (ClinicalTrials.gov) HIGHLIGHTS: 
ABvac40 was safe and well-tolerated in early-stage Alzheimer's disease patients. 
No amyloid-related imaging abnormalities-edema (ARIA-E) or encephalitis 
observed; ARIA-hemorrhage (ARIA-H) rates were similar across groups. Specific, 
sustained immune response to ABvac40 in plasma, with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
antibody penetration. Cognitive scales and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
volumetric data favored ABvac40 over placebo. Results support further 
development of ABvac40 as a disease-modifying therapy.

INTRODUCTION: We examined whether participant characteristics, including 
sociodemographics, APOE ε4 allele, lifestyle factors, and cardiovascular risk 
factors, modified the effect of the Mediterranean-Dietary Approach to Systolic 
Hypertension Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND).
METHODS: The MIND trial (NCT02817074) randomized adults 65 to 85 years who were 
overweight or obese to the MIND diet or control diet conditions. A linear 
mixed-effects model was used to examine whether participant characteristics 
modified the effect of MIND on the annual change in a global cognition score 
derived from a battery of 12 neurocognitive tests.
RESULTS: On average, participants (N = 604) were 70.4 years old, 65.5% female, 
and with a body mass index (BMI) of 33.9 kg/m2. In multivariable-adjusted 
models, BMI was the only significant modifier (p = 0.009); only among 
individuals with BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2 (n = 213) was the MIND diet group associated 
with higher cognitive scores by 0.040 (standard error = 0.017, p = 0.018) 
standardized units per year versus control.
DISCUSSION: The MIND diet may have cognitive benefits in people with obesity, 
particularly BMI ≥ 35.
CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT02817074 HIGHLIGHTS: This study examined 
potential effect modifiers of the MIND diet on cognition. BMI emerged as a 
significant effect modifier. In those with BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2, the MIND diet group 
had higher cognitive scores. The MIND diet may have cognitive benefits for 
people with obesity.

INTRODUCTION: To lower future dementia incidence, there is an urgent need to 
implement dementia risk reduction strategies in routine care. Yet, it remains 
unclear whether health professionals possess sufficient knowledge.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 368 current and 692 future 
(i.e., students) health professionals in the Netherlands, assessing awareness of 
dementia risk reduction, knowledge of dementia risk factors, and educational 
needs and barriers.
RESULTS: Most professionals (79.1%) and students (54.1%) were aware of dementia 
risk reduction. Across both groups, highly educated individuals demonstrated 
greater awareness and better recognition of risk factors. Knowledge gaps existed 
within both groups regarding the contribution of hearing impairment, obesity, 
poor sleep, and chronic kidney disease. Both groups expressed interest in 
professional education on brain health promotion.
DISCUSSION: These findings highlight the need for tailored educational modules 
to address knowledge gaps and equip professionals with the tools to discuss 
dementia risk reduction in routine care.
HIGHLIGHTS: Most professionals and students were aware of dementia risk 
reduction possibilities. Highly educated individuals demonstrated greater 
awareness and better recognition of dementia risk factors than those with lower 
education levels. Both professionals and students had knowledge gaps regarding 
specific dementia risk factors. Few students received comprehensive education on 
dementia risk reduction as part of their studies. The majority of professionals 
and students expressed interest in further (professional) education on improving 
brain health and dementia risk reduction.

BACKGROUND: Tauopathies share common features, including tau aggregation, which 
plays a central role in neurodegeneration. However, these disorders are highly 
heterogeneous, particularly in the spread of pathological tau species between 
cells. In Alzheimer's disease, intracellular tau aggregation is followed by a 
propagation between cells leading to a hierarchical pathway of 
neurodegeneration, whereas in other tauopathies, such as progressive 
supranuclear palsy (PSP), pathological tau remains largely confined within 
neurons and exhibits more limited spread. This variability raises the question 
of whether tailored treatments for each tauopathy might offer more therapeutic 
benefit. Hence, we designed two different immunological approaches using single 
domain antibody fragments, also called VHHs, to target intracellular and 
extracellular tau. This study aims to first evaluate the safety of these 
immunological tools on physiological tau and then their potential to slow 
disease progression.
METHODS: We selected the pro-aggregative tau hexapeptide PHF6 as a common target 
for the VHHs. These VHHs were cloned in viral vectors allowing to compare two 
different expression systems: 1) intracytosolic expression to prevent tau 
accumulation (intraVHH) and 2) secretion into the interstitial fluid, to prevent 
tau spreading (extraVHH). By stereotactic injection of viral vectors, these VHHs 
were expressed in the brain of transgenic or wild-type mice and three readouts 
were studied: behavior, brain imaging and tau lesions.
RESULTS: We validated the correct addressing of intra- and extraVHHs. These two 
constructs were not associated with adverse effects, even in the absence of tau 
overexpression, in wild-type mice. Their efficacy was demonstrated in transgenic 
mouse tau models, either chronic long-term or in acute seeding with injections 
of human brain homogenates from Alzheimer's disease patients. They both can slow 
down several pathological effects (i.e. cognitive deficits, cerebral atrophy and 
neuronal hyperphosphorylation of tau).
CONCLUSIONS: This study is a proof of concept demonstrating that VHHs can be 
engineered to reduce both intra- and extracellular tau pathologies without major 
adverse effects, making them of interest for therapeutic applications.

INTRODUCTION: Agents targeting metabolic/vascular disorders are promising 
candidates to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD) and enhance safety and efficacy of 
other therapies.
METHODS: In a 2×2 factorial double-blinded randomized trial, participants with 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI), early AD, or who were amyloid positive received 
intranasal insulin (INI; 40 IU q.i.d.), the sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 
inhibitor empagliflozin (10 mg q.d. oral tablet), both, or placebo for 4 weeks. 
The primary outcome was treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs). Secondary 
outcomes included the modified Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite-5 
(mPACC5), fluid biomarkers, cerebral blood flow (CBF), and fractional anisotropy 
(FA).
RESULTS: TRAEs were mild and similar for all groups. INI increased mPACC5, 
modulated FA and CBF, and reduced plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein. 
Empagliflozin lowered cerebrospinal fluid tau and modulated CBF. Both agents 
moderated immune/inflammatory/neurovascular markers.
DISCUSSION: INI and empagliflozin treatment was safe with promising effects on 
cognition, fluid, and imaging biomarkers. A longer and larger trial is needed to 
confirm these results.
CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT05081219 HIGHLIGHTS: Agents targeting metabolic 
or vascular disorders are promising candidates to prevent or treat Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). Intranasal insulin and empagliflozin were safe alone or in 
combination for mild cognitive impairment/AD. Insulin improved cognition and 
markers of inflammation and immune function. Empagliflozin reduced markers of 
vascular injury and neurodegeneration. A longer, larger trial is needed to 
validate these results.

Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3β) is a serine/threonine kinase implicated 
in various diseases such as Alzheimer's, diabetes, and cancer, making it a 
pivotal therapeutic target. This study uniquely integrates a curated 
phytochemical library with comprehensive ADMET filtering and 200 ns molecular 
dynamics (MD) simulations to identify stable GSK-3β inhibitors, offering deeper 
mechanistic and dynamic insights than previous docking-based studies. ADMET 
profiling shortlisted 49 compounds, with uzarigenin, jatrophone, chrysin, and 
podolide exhibiting superior binding affinities compared to Tideglusib 
(-8.53 kcal/mol). Among these, jatrophone displayed the highest binding affinity 
(9.00 kcal/mol), followed by uzarigenin (8.63 kcal/mol) and podolide 
(8.60 kcal/mol), indicating stronger interactions with GSK-3β. Molecular 
dynamics simulations confirmed stability for uzarigenin and podolide over 200 
nanoseconds, supported by RMSD, SASA, and Rg analyses. Principal component and 
covariance analyses revealed strong residue interactions in these complexes. 
KEGG pathway analysis highlighted the role of GSK-3β inhibitors in Alzheimer's 
disease, Wnt signaling, and cancer pathways. This study identifies 
phytochemicals with potential therapeutic applications for neurodegenerative, 
cancer, and metabolic diseases, warranting further experimental validation.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an environmental risk factor for dementia and 
long-term neurological deficits, posing a significant public health challenge. 
TBI-induced neuroinflammation involves both brain-resident microglia and 
peripheral monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). Previous research has shown that 
MDMs contribute to the development of long-term memory deficits, yet their 
long-term behavior following brain infiltration remains unclear. To address 
this, our study uses two complementary fate-mapping mouse lines, CCR2-creERT2 
and Ms4a3-cre, for precise and lasting tracking of MDMs in vivo. Here we show 
that MDMs persist in the brain for at least 8 months post-TBI in both male and 
female mice. MDMs retain phagocytic activity for at least 30 days post-TBI, 
remain transcriptionally distinct from microglia, and display a gene expression 
profile associated with aging and disease. Moreover, we identify a core 
transcriptomic signature of MDMs shared across various mouse models and brain 
perturbations, which is also enriched in the brain myeloid cells of male 
subjects with TBI and Alzheimer's disease patients. These findings enhance our 
understanding of MDMs' dynamics after TBI and inform future targeted 
myeloid-based therapies.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) may cause significant psychosocial distress 
not only in the patient but also their partner. However, long-term risks of 
major depression in partners of AD patients are largely unknown.
METHODS: A national cohort study was conducted of all 145 289 partners of people 
diagnosed with all-cause dementia, including 57 113 partners of people diagnosed 
with AD, in Sweden during 1998-2017, and 1 300 561 population-based controls. 
Cox regression was used to compute hazard ratios (HRs) for subsequent risk of 
major depression identified from nationwide outpatient and inpatient diagnoses 
through 2018, adjusting for sociodemographic factors and prior mental disorders.
RESULTS: The 10-year cumulative incidence of major depression was 5.4% in 
partners of people with AD, 5.6% in partners of people with all-cause dementia, 
and 3.9% in controls. The adjusted relative rate of major depression was 
increased ~1.5-fold in partners of people with AD (HR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.35-1.72) 
or all-cause dementia (1.45; 1.34-1.57), compared with controls. These risks 
were elevated among both women (AD: HR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.22-1.64; all-cause 
dementia: 1.36; 1.24-1.50) and men (AD: 1.81; 1.46-2.25; all-cause dementia: 
1.73; 1.48-2.01). Risks remained significantly elevated ≥3 years later in both 
women (1.3- to 1.5-fold) and men (1.5-fold). Risks were generally highest in 
partners aged ≥85 years.
CONCLUSIONS: In this large national cohort, partners of people diagnosed with AD 
or all-cause dementia had ~1.5-fold risks of major depression, which remained 
elevated several years later. Partners of people with dementia need psychosocial 
support and long-term follow-up for timely detection and treatment of 
depression.

Understanding the dynamic interaction between cardiovascular and cerebrovascular 
systems during exercise is essential to evaluate the mechanisms supporting brain 
perfusion. This study examined age- and sex-specific differences in 
cardiovascular and cerebrovascular dynamic response and used systems modeling to 
assess physiological coupling during moderate intensity exercise. We recruited 
adults to complete a single session of moderate intensity exercise on a 
recumbent stepper. Middle cerebral artery blood velocity (MCAv), mean arterial 
pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and end-tidal CO₂ (PETCO₂) were continuously 
recorded. In 164 participants, we analyzed the dynamic responses to exercise 
using mono-exponential modeling and functional data analysis. Granger causality 
within a subject-specific vector autoregression framework evaluated directional 
influence among physiological signals. Advancing age was associated with an 
attenuated dynamic response for MCAv, PETCO₂, and HR while MAP was elevated. 
Older adults exhibited significantly smaller MCAv amplitude and slower time 
constants than young and middle-aged groups. While sex did not influence overall 
MCAv, MAP, or HR kinetics, men had significantly higher PETCO₂ throughout 
exercise. Granger causality analysis revealed bidirectional coupling among MCAv, 
HR, MAP, and PETCO₂. Prior PETCO₂ levels significantly predicted MCAv while MAP 
had both short- and long-lag predictive effects on MCAv. MCAv also influenced 
subsequent changes in MAP and PETCO₂, indicating feedback regulation. PETCO₂ 
emerged as a dominant driver of MCAv, though systemic interactions reflect an 
integrated physiological network with multi-component feedback loops. This study 
advances understanding of cerebrovascular regulation and highlights the utility 
of systems modeling during exercise.

ABSTRACT: Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that 
primarily affects memory, cognition, and behavior, often leading to severe 
functional decline. A 55-year-old male patient came with complaints of confusion 
in daily activities, forgetting names, misplacing objects, frequent episodes of 
crying, and loss of communication skills for the past 1 year. He was clinically 
diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease. The patient was treated with an Ayurvedic 
treatment protocol, involving internal administration of Brahmi ghrit, 
Saraswatarishta with gold, Ashwagandha powder, and Rasona Ksheerpaka, along with 
Panchakarma therapies including Nasya with Panchendriya taila, Shirobasti, and 
Abhyanga with Balashwagandha taila. After the treatment, the patient showed 
marked improvements in memory retention, orientation, and mood stability. This 
case showed that Ayurvedic interventions aid in slowing cognitive decline and 
improving daily functioning in Alzheimer's patients, highlighting the need for 
integrative and individualized treatment approaches in neurodegenerative 
disorders.

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the AD structural hallmarks along with brain 
biomarkers and neurobehavioral alterations in a repeated intranasal Aβ1-42 
exposure mouse model. This model is a simple, non-invasive, and less stressful 
method and may allow direct access of Aβ to the brain. The results of this study 
showed a dose-dependent increase in the level of Aβ1-42 deposition, tau 
phosphorylation, neuroinflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers in brain 
tissue, along with learning and memory deficits in mice. This model may be 
suitable for evaluating the biochemical, structural, functional histological 
alterations, along with the neurobehavioral deficits mimicking AD.

Astaxanthin is a ketocarotenoid that exhibits a variety of bioactivities, 
including neuroprotection, but the detailed mechanisms by which astaxanthin 
exerts neuroprotection remain unclear. In the present study, the effects of 
astaxanthin on amyloid-beta (Abeta)-induced toxicity were investigated in a 
Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is 
demonstrated that astaxanthin treatment significantly alleviated the 
Abeta-induced paralytic phenotype in AD C. elegans while reducing the production 
of reactive oxygen species and restoring the level of glutathione. Further 
analyses revealed that astaxanthin treatment resulted in a decrease in Abeta 
accumulation in AD C. elegans. Moreover, astaxanthin restored the proteasomal 
activity in AD C. elegans by elevating the expression of genes encoding the 
central subunits of the 20S proteasome. Therefore, astaxanthin might reduce 
Abeta accumulation via promoting proteasomal function. In addition, astaxanthin 
treatment increased the expression of skinhead-1 (skn-1), while knockdown of 
skn-1 expression by RNA interference diminished the inhibition of astaxanthin on 
Abeta-induced toxicity in AD C. elegans. The elevation of the expression of 
proteasome subunit genes and the enhancement of proteasomal activity by 
astaxanthin were also dependent on SKN-1. Overall, these findings indicated that 
astaxanthin exerted its protection against Abeta-induced toxicity in AD C. 
elegans via maintaining redox balance and promoting SKN-1-mediated proteasomal 
activity.

BACKGROUND: Lighting, especially circadian lighting, significantly affects 
people with dementia, influencing sleep patterns, daytime alertness, and 
behavioral symptoms such as agitation. Since individuals experience and respond 
to light differently, measuring personal lighting exposure is essential for 
understanding its impact on health. Without individual data, the connection 
between lighting and health outcomes remains unclear. Wearable sensors provide a 
practical way to track personal light exposure, helping researchers better 
assess its effects on circadian rhythms and overall well-being.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop and validate both calibration and 
predictive models using wearable lighting sensors to assess individual circadian 
lighting exposure accurately. By leveraging machine learning techniques and 
empirical data, we seek to establish a reliable method for health care 
researchers and practitioners to investigate and optimize lighting conditions 
for improved circadian health in nursing homes, especially for residents with 
dementia.
METHODS: A combination of controlled laboratory experiments and on-site data 
collection was conducted using professional spectrophotometer measurements as 
ground truth. Calibration models were developed for photopic lux and correlated 
color temperature, while predictive models estimated circadian metrics such as 
circadian stimulus. The sensors and the developed models were implemented in a 
real-world health care research project about bright light therapy intervention 
at 2 assisted-living facilities.
RESULTS: The calibration models for photopic lux and correlated color 
temperature demonstrated strong accuracy, with an adjusted R² of 0.858 and 
0.982, respectively, ensuring reliable sensor measurements. Predictive models 
for circadian stimulus were developed using both simple regression and machine 
learning techniques. The random forest model outperformed linear regression, 
achieving an adjusted R² of 0.915 and a cross-validation R² of 0.857, 
demonstrating high generalization capability. Upon the implementation of these 
models, significant individual variations in circadian light exposure were found 
in the study, highlighting the significance of customized lighting evaluations. 
These results confirm the effectiveness of wearable sensors, combined with the 
developed calibration and predictive modeling, in accurately assessing personal 
circadian light exposure and supporting lighting-related health care research.
CONCLUSIONS: This study introduces an effective and scalable approach to 
circadian light assessment using wearable sensors and predictive modeling. By 
replacing labor-intensive and costly spectrometer measurements, the proposed 
methodology enables continuous, cost-effective monitoring in health care 
environments. However, challenges related to sensor wearability, durability, and 
user compliance were identified, underscoring the need for further sensor design 
refinements. Future research should focus on refining sensor integration, 
expanding case studies, and developing adaptive lighting interventions to 
enhance circadian health in vulnerable populations.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), the leading neurodegenerative disorder linked to 
aging, emerges within a paradoxical metabolic landscape. Despite rising cellular 
energy demands due to accumulated damage and stress, overall energy expenditure 
remains stable or declines with age. The brain, acting as the central regulator, 
responds to hypermetabolic signals from aged tissues by activating 
energy-conserving mechanisms. In this scenario, astrocytes, strategically 
located between blood vessels and neurons, play a pivotal role as energy 
sensors, adapting to systemic stress and modulating brain metabolism. This 
review explores how astrocytes undergo metabolic reprogramming in the early 
stages, potentially becoming maladaptive over time, fueling neuroinflammation, 
oxidative stress, and accelerating AD. By understanding astrocyte energetics, we 
uncover new avenues for biomarkers and therapies that could transform AD 
treatment.

Neurodegenerative diseases (NDD), a collection of disorders with different 
underlying causes and clinical presentations, are recognized as a major area of 
concern of our society today. The most common NDD are Parkinson's disease (PD), 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Huntington's 
disease, each one of them being characterized by the progressive degradation of 
nerve cells and accumulation of misfolded and aggregated proteins in the 
affected brain region. Diagnosing NDD is challenging, due to the heterogeneity 
of the disease and the overlap of symptoms. Yet, early detection and accurate 
diagnosis are crucial for effective NDD management. With the emergence of 
disease-modifying therapies for AD, monitoring disease progression and treatment 
success is becoming essential. The future of NND diagnostics is focusing on 
developing less invasive, cost-effective strategies that enable early NDD 
identification and detection with improved patient outcomes. The integration of 
biotechnology and nanotechnology is seen as crucial for advancing the analytical 
science aspect of NDD. The creation of these innovative tools and methodologies 
is on the verge of enabling new possibilities for clinical diagnostics, but is 
also faced with several hurdles that will be critically evaluated.

We previously demonstrated that the Tg2576 mouse model of Alzheimer's Disease 
(AD) exhibits degeneration of midbrain dopaminergic neurons, resulting in 
reduced dopamine (DA) outflow in the hippocampus. These impairments temporally 
coincide with synaptic plasticity deficits at CA3-CA1 synapses. Notably, 
systemic administration of dopaminergic agents/drugs rescues the hippocampal 
deficits in Tg2576 mice. However, whether direct stimulation of the remaining 
midbrain dopaminergic neurons can restore glutamatergic transmission and rescue 
plasticity dysfunctions in the context of AD remains unexplored. Here, using 
both 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) neurotoxic lesion and optogenetic stimulation in 
C57BL/6N and DATCre/Tg2576 mice, respectively, we demonstrate that midbrain DA 
is essential for hippocampal High-Frequency Stimulation-induced Long-Term 
Potentiation (HFS-LTP) in CA3-CA1 synapses. Indeed, lesioning midbrain DA 
neurons with 6-OHDA abolishes HFS-LTP and impairs novel object recognition 
memory. Conversely, optogenetic activation of the midbrain-hippocampal 
dopaminergic pathway in DATCre/Tg2576 mice enhances glutamatergic transmission 
and rescues plasticity deficits. Our results highlight the phase-specific role 
of DA in HFS-LTP, since 6-OHDA lesion affects the late but not the early phase, 
aligning with prior studies on D1/D5 receptor involvement in protein 
synthesis-dependent plasticity. Furthermore, we provide novel insights into 
midbrain DA neuron regulation, demonstrating that phasic, but not prolonged, 
optogenetic stimulation effectively engages DA neuron activity, restoring 
hippocampal function in Tg2576 mice. Notably, phasic DA release induces "DA-LTP" 
via D1/D5 receptors, and restores HFS-LTP in CA3-CA1 synapses of AD mice, 
underscoring a potential compensatory mechanism counteracting plasticity 
deficits induced by DA neuron degeneration in Tg2576 mice. These findings 
support targeting the dopaminergic midbrain as a promising strategy for AD 
treatment, complementing pharmacological and non-invasive neuromodulatory 
approaches.

Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), primarily expressed in microglia, is 
responsible for the modulation of innate immune responses and associated with 
various immunological disorders. Available evidence documents that though as the 
predominant etiological factor for familial Parkinson's disease, LRRK2 mutations 
rarely occur in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and that LRRK2 polymorphism is 
potentially associated with late-onset AD. However, the role of LRRK2 in AD 
immunopathogenesis remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the impact of 
LRRK2 deficiency on cognitive function, Aβ plaque accumulation, and 
plaque-associated neuropathology in AD mice. The results revealed that compared 
with the 5xFAD mice, the 8-month-old 5xFAD;LRRK2-/- mice reported improved 
learning and memory, reduced cerebral and hippocampal Aβ plaque burden, and 
decreased microglia and astrocytes within the central region of hippocampal Aβ 
plaques. The 5xFAD;LRRK2-/- mice also showed a decrease in several complement 
and proinflammatory cytokines in the brain, indicating an altered microglial 
phenotype. Furthermore, the absence of LRRK2 prevented synaptic loss and 
restored the disrupted equilibrium between excitatory and inhibitory synapses in 
the 5xFAD mice. These findings suggest that LRRK2 may play an essential role in 
Aβ plaque pathology, glial responses to plaques, and neuronal dysfunction in the 
brain of the 5xFAD mice and that a genomic transgene-blockade of LRRK2 may 
reprogram the microglial responsivity, thus mitigating the neuropathological and 
behavioral deficits in AD mice. The 5xFAD;LRRK2-/- mice reduced cognitive 
impairment in the Morris water maze test compared with the 5xFAD mice. The 
protective effect of LRRK2 inhibition is not dependent on the APP production 
process or Aβ degradation. Conversely, 5xFAD;LRRK2-/- mice enhanced microglial 
phagocytosis, reducing Aβ aggregation and glial activation. Additionally, 
compared with the 5xFAD, the 5xFAD;LRRK2-/- mice exhibited preserved synaptic 
structure, characterized by higher PSD95 expression, lower C1qa/C3 expression in 
both excitatory and inhibitory synapses, upregulated VGLUT1 expression, and 
downregulated VGAT expression.

The blood‒brain barrier (BBB) is a highly selective permeability barrier that 
safeguards the central nervous system (CNS) from potentially harmful substances 
while regulating the transport of essential molecules. Its dysfunction is 
increasingly recognized as a pivotal factor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), contributing to the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques. We 
present a novel therapeutic strategy that targets low-density lipoprotein 
receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) on the BBB. Our design leverages the 
multivalent nature and precise size of LRP1-targeted polymersomes to modulate 
receptor-mediated transport, biasing LRP1 trafficking toward transcytosis and 
thereby upregulating its expression to promote efficient Aβ removal. In AD model 
mice, this intervention significantly reduced brain Aβ levels by nearly 45% and 
increased plasma Aβ levels by 8-fold within 2 h, as measured by ELISA. Multiple 
imaging techniques confirmed the reduction in brain Aβ signals after treatment. 
Cognitive assessments revealed that treated AD mice exhibited significant 
improvements in spatial learning and memory, with performance levels comparable 
to those of wild-type mice. These cognitive benefits persisted for up to 6 
months post-treatment. This work pioneers a new paradigm in drug design, where 
function arises from the supramolecular nature of the nanomedicine, harnessing 
multivalency to elicit biological action at the membrane trafficking level. Our 
findings also reaffirm the critical role of the BBB in AD pathogenesis and 
demonstrate that targeting the BBB can make therapeutic interventions 
significantly more effective. We establish a compelling case for BBB modulation 
and LRP1-mediated Aβ clearance as a transformative foundation for future AD 
therapies.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) has traditionally been associated with amyloid-β 
plaques, but growing evidence underscores the role of neuroinflammation in 
disease progression. The autoinflammatory hypothesis of AD suggests chronic 
immune dysfunction contributes to neuronal damage, making immune modulation a 
promising therapeutic strategy.Cannabidiol (CBD), a phytocannabinoid with 
anti-inflammatory properties, may offer therapeutic potential. This study 
investigates how CBD independently influences two key neuroinflammatory 
regulators in AD: the Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) pathway and the cyclic 
GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) pathway. Though mechanistically distinct, both shape CNS 
immune responses. Targeting these immune-metabolic axes provides a mechanistic 
alternative to amyloid- or tau-based approaches by addressing upstream drivers 
of neuroinflammation and immune dysregulation. Using the male 5XFAD transgenic 
AD mouse model, we administered CBD via inhalation and assessed IDO and cGAS 
expression using flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, and gene expression 
analysis. We evaluated cytokine levels and used STRING-based bioinformatics to 
identify CBD-target interactions. CBD treatment significantly reduced IDO and 
cGAS expression, correlating with decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines, 
including TNF-α, IL-1β, and IFN-γ. Bioinformatics identified potential 
interactions between CBD and immune targets such as AKT1, TRPV1, and GPR55. 
These targets were prioritized based on their roles in neuroinflammatory 
signaling and high-confidence interactions with CBD. AKT1 regulates inflammatory 
signaling and cell survival, TRPV1 modulates nociception and neuroinflammation, 
and GPR55 influences immune cell activation. These findings support CBD as a 
potential monotherapy or adjunctive treatment for AD by targeting distinct 
neuroinflammatory pathways, including IDO and cGAS. Further studies are 
warranted to fully explore its therapeutic potential.Significance statement This 
study highlights the therapeutic potential of cannabidiol (CBD) in targeting 
neuroinflammation, a major driver of Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. By 
modulating the IDO and cGAS pathways-critical regulators of CNS immune 
responses-CBD reduces pro-inflammatory cytokines and ameliorates immune 
dysfunction. These findings support the emerging autoinflammatory hypothesis of 
AD, which posits that chronic inflammation underlies neuronal damage. The 
IDO/cGAS signaling axis, located at the intersection of innate immunity and 
metabolic regulation, remains underexplored in AD and represents a key 
intervention point to disrupt neuroinflammatory loops. This study positions CBD 
as a promising mono- or adjunctive therapy and reinforces the need to consider 
multi-targeted strategies that address upstream immune mechanisms in 
neurodegenerative disease.

BACKGROUND: Nutrition can have a profound impact on chronic disease outcomes can 
be profound, but without periodic assessment of treatment fidelity, one cannot 
know whether the outcomes are due to an effective intervention or other unknown 
factors. Repeated measurement of fidelity of all treatments and across all 
interventionists will ensure the likelihood that treatment differences are 
maintained for the duration of the trial. This paper summarizes our efforts to 
assess treatment fidelity throughout the ongoing Phase III dietary intervention 
trial known as Nutrition effects on Brain Outcomes and Recovery in Stroke after 
Hospitalization (NOURISH), which tests whether acute stroke survivors' adoption 
of the Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet 
will slow annual cognitive decline compared to those assigned to receive 
enhanced usual care.
METHODS: Templates and measures for treatment fidelity were developed according 
to five key components of treatment fidelity for the NOURISH trial: (1) 
intervention design and protocol, (2) training of interventionists, (3) 
treatment delivery (includes content and process), (4) treatment receipt, and 
(5) treatment enactment.
RESULTS: Through periodic assessments of such measures, investigators ensured 
that the interventionists were delivering the intervention consistently 
according to protocol and learning what the participant understood and was 
willing to adopt. Moreover, the intervention was further refined to make it more 
responsive to the needs of the diverse participants during their stroke 
recovery.
CONCLUSIONS: The future success of disseminating and implementing public health 
programming for stroke recovery relies on finding the right balance between 
maintaining intervention fidelity and allowing for adaptability. NCT04337255.

Microglia are the principal innate immune cells of the central nervous system, 
playing cardinal roles in regulating immunity and mediating neuroinflammation - 
a chronic inflammatory response occurring in the brain and spinal cord. 
Microglia exhibit a dual role in this process: they can suppress 
neuroinflammation through anti-inflammatory polarization or inhibition of 
proinflammatory intracellular signaling, or conversely, they can exacerbate 
neuroinflammation via activation of proinflammatory pathways and phenotypes. 
This seemingly binary behavior is further complicated by a network of internal 
and external molecular effectors that influence microglial polarization and 
function, guiding them toward either neuroprotection or neurotoxicity. In this 
narrative review, we aimed to elucidate the dual role of microglia in 
neuroinflammation, particularly in the context of neurodegenerative diseases and 
other brain pathologies. Special emphasis is placed on the most recent findings 
related to key proteins such as TREM2 (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid 
cells 2) and HMGB1 (high mobility group box 1 protein). By examining the 
molecular mechanisms and pathways involving these proteins, we highlight 
promising therapeutic targets for modulating neuroinflammation and advancing 
developing novel treatment strategies for neurodegenerative and other 
brain-related disorders.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe and progressive neurodegenerative disease 
of the brain that has so far been treated with symptomatic drug and non-drug 
therapies as standard treatment. Following the approval of the monoclonal 
anti-amyloid antibody by the FDA, AD therapy has changed, as this therapy has 
made it possible to attenuate the biological disease process of AD. Lecanemab 
has been recommended by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use 
(CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for approval in patients with 
early AD under two conditions. Firstly, homozygous ApoE4 carriers and secondly, 
patients receiving oral anticoagulants should not receive lecanemab. The 
following narrative review explains the mechanism of action, safety and side 
effects of lecanemab. Furthermore, risk factors for side effects are described. 
Finally, the first experiences with lecanemab are reported and the efficacy and 
financial aspects are discussed. Lecanemab leads to a temporary reduction in 
amyloid-ß deposits and to a benefit that can be reflected in everyday 
competence, cognition and quality of life and can be described as a breakthrough 
in AD's therapy due to its demonstrable biological and clinical efficacy.

Publisher: Die Alzheimer Krankheit (AD) ist eine schwere und fortschreitende 
neurodegenerative Erkrankung des Gehirns, die bislang mit primär nur 
symptomatisch wirksamen medikamentösen und nicht-medikamentösen Therapieformen 
als Standardtherapie behandelt wird. Nach der Zulassung des monoklonalen 
Anti-Amyloid Antikörper durch die FDA (Food and Drug Administration) hat sich 
die AD-Therapie gewandelt, da es durch diese Therapie möglich geworden ist, den 
biologischen Krankheitsprozess der AD zu verlangsamen. Lecanemab ist durch den 
Ausschuss für Humanarzneimittel (CHMP) der Europäischen Arzneimittel-Agentur 
(EMA) für die Zulassung bei Patienten mit früher AD unter zwei Bedingungen 
empfohlen worden. Erstens sollen homozygote ApoE4 Träger und zweitens Patienten, 
die eine orale Antikoagulantien erhalten, Lecanemab nicht erhalten. In der 
folgenden narrativen Übersicht werden der Wirkmechanismus, die Sicherheit sowie 
die Nebenwirkungen von Lecanemab erläutert. Ferner werden Risikofaktoren für 
Nebenwirkungen beschrieben. Schließlich werden die ersten Erfahrungen mit 
Lecanemab aus den Vereinigten Staaten berichtet sowie die Wirksamkeit und 
finanzielle Aspekte diskutiert. Lecanemab führt zu einer vorübergehenden 
Reduktion der Amyloid-ß Ablagerungen und zu einem Benefit, der sich in der 
Alltagskompetenz, Kognition und Lebensqualität abbilden lässt und durch seine 
nachweisbare biologisch-klinische nachweisbare Wirksamkeit als ein Durchbruch 
der AD-Therapie bezeichnet werden kann.

BACKGROUND: The health and economic burdens of Alzheimer disease and related 
dementias (ADRD) are exacerbated for people living in rural social contexts who 
experience geographic barriers to care. There are currently few resources 
specifically designed to support socioculturally diverse rural ADRD care dyads, 
including early detection of potential precursors to ADRD such as mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) and subjective cognitive decline (SCD).
OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of the Northern Arizona Memory Study (NAZMS) is 
to develop culturally informed and scalable resources to identify and support 
rural families at risk for ADRD. The purpose of this study is to introduce the 
NAZMS protocol and discuss its role in addressing dementia risk and promoting 
cognitive health in rural communities.
METHODS: This dyadic study will use a mixed methods, digital health approach. A 
sample of rural care dyads with MCI or SCD will be screened and recruited 
through partnerships with community centers across Northern Arizona. Consenting 
dyads will complete semistructured interviews to answer questions about 
technology preferences for monitoring symptoms and engaging in remotely 
delivered interventions. Next, care dyads will complete separate baseline 
questionnaires assessing dyadic (eg, experiences with caregiving or care 
receiving) and health factors. Participants with cognitive impairment will then 
complete a 14-day mobile protocol of brief end-of-day surveys and cognitive 
assessments delivered via study-provided smartphones.
RESULTS: Data from the qualitative interviews will provide dyad preferences for 
intervention development. Data from the quantitative protocol will specify for 
whom (ie, between-person) and on which days (ie, within-person) modifiable 
factors are related to better cognitive health in everyday life.
CONCLUSIONS: This study will take a mixed methods, digital health approach to 
supporting rural families at risk for ADRD by understanding intervention 
preferences and identifying the modifiable protective and risk factors that 
influence cognitive health in everyday life. The findings are expected to 
directly support rural Arizonans and respond to national priorities in ADRD 
research for the development of community-based disease education programs and 
the use of digital assessments of cognitive health and well-being.

OBJECTIVE: Late-onset epilepsy of unknown etiology (LOEU) carries an elevated 
risk of dementia, suggesting that it may represent an early manifestation of 
neurodegenerative or cerebrovascular disease. Direct comparisons between LOEU 
and acquired lesional late-onset epilepsy (LOE) may elucidate clinical features 
specific to LOEU.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of patients with LOE, with 
first documented seizure at age 55 or older, whose evaluation included an 
epilepsy-protocol brain MRI and/or inpatient video-EEG evaluation. Etiology was 
determined from neuroimaging lesions and medical history. Patients without an 
identified etiology were categorized as LOEU. Analyses were performed 
controlling for sex, age of onset, and epilepsy duration.
RESULTS: We identified 75 LOEU (mean onset: 64.9 years, 38.7% female) and 57 
acquired lesional LOE cases with etiologies including cortical stroke, 
hemorrhage, neoplasm, trauma, or infection (mean onset: 66.5 years, 36.8% 
female). LOEU was less likely to have a history of status epilepticus (6.7% vs. 
21.1%, aOR: 0.28, p < 0.03) or to have undergone inpatient video-EEG monitoring 
(13.3% vs. 24.6%, aOR: 0.34, p < 0.04). LOEU was prescribed fewer ASMs compared 
to acquired lesional LOE (aOR: 0.43, p < 0.02), and LOEU patients prescribed 
multiple ASMs had lower average 12-month seizure frequency than acquired 
lesional LOE (median: 0.2 vs. 1.0, p < 0.01). LOEU had lower rates of vascular 
comorbidities than acquired lesional LOE, though rates of subsequent dementia 
were not significantly different (5-year risk: 16.6% vs. 17.7%). An exploratory 
cluster analysis demonstrated an LOEU subgroup with older onset, higher 
prevalence of white matter hyperintensities, cerebral atrophy, epileptiform 
discharges, and greater epilepsy severity.
SIGNIFICANCE: LOEU was associated with fewer proxies for epilepsy severity, 
signifying that LOEU is more often treatment-responsive than acquired lesional 
LOE. LOEU has lower rates of comorbid vascular disease compared to acquired 
lesional LOE, suggesting that occult cerebrovascular disease is not 
overrepresented in LOEU relative to other forms of LOE.
PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: People who develop epilepsy after age 55 without a known 
cause usually respond well to treatment and need fewer antiseizure medications 
than people with epilepsy from a known brain injury. In this study, they had 
fewer hospital stays for seizure monitoring and fewer vascular problems. 
Dementia risk was high in patients with late-onset epilepsy, both when the cause 
was known and when it was unknown. Late-onset epilepsy without a known cause is 
often less severe but still needs regular monitoring for memory and thinking 
problems.

Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease are the most prevalent neurological 
diseases. Amyloid-β, tau, and α-synuclein proteins are known to be implicated in 
neurodegenerative disease (NDD). Elucidation of precise therapeutic targets 
remains a challenge. Therefore, the identification of interactomes of amyloid-β 
precursor protein (APP), microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT), and 
α-synuclein (SNCA) proteins is of great interest, aimed at unraveling novel 
targets. An integrated analysis was employed to identify direct interactors as 
therapeutic targets, considering protein-protein interactions and subsequent 
network analysis. Further, it was proposed to identify hub proteins, intended 
targets, regulatory factors, disease-gene associations, functional enrichment 
analyses of the protein interactors interfered with gene ontologies and 
disease-driving pathways. Protein interactome centered on APP, MAPT, and SNCA 
identified the top hundred high-confidence protein-protein interactions that 
revealed BACE1, PSEN1, SORL1, GSK3B, CDK5, SNCAIP, PRKN, and APOE as physical 
and functional protein interactors. The top ten hub proteins were ranked based 
on multiple centrality measures and topological algorithms. Further, the 
integrated network of all three protein interactomes contained distinct nodes 
with edges. Interestingly, regulatory mechanisms have revealed possible 
regulatory modules, including cleavage, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination. Top 
interacting proteins were enriched in several ontology terms, such as regulation 
of neuronal apoptotic processes, amyloid beta fibril formation, and tau protein 
binding. Pathway analysis mapped the pathways of neurodegeneration-multiple 
disease, with a significant level of interacting proteins. Finally, the most 
comprehensive interactome associated with NDD provides insights into protein 
interactors, regulating the mechanisms of key proteins that can serve as novel 
therapeutic targets.

Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) pose significant challenges in early detection 
and treatment due to their complex pathophysiology and heterogeneous clinical 
presentations. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene 
expression, have emerged as promising diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic 
targets in NDDs. Pathological examination of affected tissues reveals early 
synaptic dysfunction, protein misfolding, and neuroinflammation occur prior to 
overt clinical symptoms, highlighting the importance of sensitive diagnostics 
approaches in prodromal stages. This review summarizes for researchers on the 
role of miRNAs in NDDs by examining their diagnostic potential in biofluids such 
as blood and cerebrospinal fluid, and their therapeutic applicability through 
inhibition or replacement strategies. Literature from peer-reviewed databases 
was assessed with a focus on recent advances in molecular detection platforms, 
computational modeling of miRNA-mRNA interactions, and preclinical/clinical 
investigations.More than 2600 human miRNAs have been identified, collectively 
regulating over half of mammalian protein-coding genes. Quantitative 
methodologies, particularly reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), 
enable reliable miRNA profiling, facilitating early diagnosis and prognosis of 
NDDs. Therapeutic strategies, including antagomirs, mimics, sponges and viral or 
non-viral delivery systems, show promise in modulating disease pathways. 
However, significant challenges remain, including variability in miRNA 
extraction and quantification protocols, off-target effects, delivery barriers 
across the blood brain barrier and limited reproducibility across studies. 
MiRNAs represent a class of molecular tools with potential to transform 
diagnostics and therapeutics in NDDs. Future research should prioritize 
methodological standardization, validation in large multicenter cohorts, and 
improved computational approaches to elucidate miRNA-mediated regulatory 
networks in NDDs. Replication studies and translational research are essential 
harnessing the the full clinical utility of miRNAs in the management of 
Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease and other NDDs. Graphical Abstract.

Molecular Mechanisms of EDC-Induced Alzheimer's Disease and of Traditional 
Chinese Medicine Active Substances in Treating AD and Antagonizing EDC-Induced 
Effects.

AD, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, imposes an increasingly heavy 
burden on global public health, with its pathogenesis remaining incompletely 
understood. Meanwhile, EDCs-widely present in the environment, food, and 
consumer products-have emerged as a significant public health concern due to 
their diverse health risks, including potential contributions to 
neurodegenerative processes such as AD by disrupting neurohomeostasis. 
Furthermore, as natural compounds, ginsenosides and other AS have been the focus 
of numerous studies exploring their role in treating AD, thanks to their 
advantages of multi-target properties and low side effects. However, the 
specific molecular pathways through which EDCs induce AD, as well as the 
mechanisms by which AS may counteract EDC-induced toxicity and intervene in AD, 
remain unclear. Against this background, this study sought to: (1) explore the 
molecular pathways through which EDCs may induce AD by disrupting 
neurohomeostasis; (2) preliminarily investigate the potential of AS in treating 
AD and antagonizing EDC-induced AD at the molecular level. To achieve these 
goals, we integrated network toxicology, network pharmacology, and molecular 
docking to construct a multi-dimensional interaction network among EDCs, AD, and 
AS. By establishing intersecting target sets for EDCs-AD and AS-AD, core targets 
were identified via topology analysis of protein-protein interaction (PPI) 
networks. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses highlighted key pathways, including 
serotonergic synapse and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction. Molecular 
docking further explored interactions between EDCs/AS and core target proteins. 
The results suggest that EDCs may drive neurodegeneration in AD by impairing 
synaptic function, while AS may counteract these effects by enhancing synaptic 
activity, stabilizing membrane microenvironments, inhibiting Aβ aggregation, 
alleviating neuroinflammation, and restoring metabolic homeostasis. Further 
analysis indicated that AS exhibit stronger binding ability to core targets 
compared to EDCs, implying a potential antagonistic effect of AS against EDCs. 
This study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying 
EDC-induced AD and establishes a multi-target theoretical framework for 
AS-mediated antagonism of EDC toxicity, offering a reference for the prevention 
and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

BACKGROUND: Alpha-internexin (AINX) is a type IV intermediate filament alongside 
the neurofilament triplet proteins and periferin. Despite its homologies, the 
key difference is that AINX is central nervous system-specific. The purpose of 
this study was to develop an immunoassay for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AINX, 
quantify it in patients with neurodegenerative diseases, and compare its 
diagnostic performance with neurofilament light (NfL).
METHODS: Monoclonal antibodies were generated and characterized by 
immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry and ELISA, for specificity to 
the target analyte and cross-reactivity. Single molecule array (Simoa) 
technology was the selected platform for assay development. The assay was 
validated according to pre-established parameters and AINX performance as a 
biomarker was tested in two independent cohorts (Gothenburg and University 
College London).
RESULTS: Two highly specific antibodies were generated (B15 and Ina1) and used 
to develop a robust assay in all analytical validation parameters tested. The 
quantitative range of the assay was 0.137-140 pg/mL. In the Gothenburg cohort, 
AINX and NfL showed similar diagnostic performance, but the correlation between 
biomarkers was diagnosis dependent. In the University College London cohort, 
AINX and NfL showed similar trends across the different neurodegenerative 
diseases, with strong correlation between markers.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed a highly sensitive and specific immunoassay for AINX 
in CSF. AINX showed similar diagnostic performance and high correlation with CSF 
NfL. Further research should focus on describing its role in specific disorders, 
as well as evaluate its potential as a blood-based biomarker.

Epidemiological studies have linked uric acid (UA), the end product of purine 
metabolism in humans, with reduced Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk. Decreased 
serum UA levels are observed in AD patients versus age-matched controls, while 
upstream purine metabolites remained unchanged. In 5×FAD mice, two months of UA 
supplementation improved cognitive function and reduced amyloid plaque burden. 
Mechanistically, UA enhances microglial amyloid-β (Aβ) phagocytosis and induces 
transcriptional reprogramming in AD mouse microglia, characterized by 
upregulated phagocytic pathways and attenuated inflammatory responses. UA 
treatment restored the recycling of Aβ receptors CD36 and TREM2 in microglia, 
enhanced lysosomal biogenesis, and facilitated Aβ degradation. These findings 
identify UA as a critical endogenous modulator of microglial Aβ processing and 
suggest exploring UA supplementation as a therapeutic strategy for AD.

Neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders represent a significant 
global health burden, characterized by progressive neuronal dysfunction and 
loss. Both diseases, despite their diverse etiologies and mechanisms, share a 
complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and biological factors. 
Neurodegenerative diseases are caused by multiple factors, including aging, 
mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, inflammation, genetic mutations, 
and protein misfolding. In contrast, neurodevelopmental disorders are primarily 
influenced by epigenetic alterations, neurotransmitter imbalances, early brain 
damage, environmental factors, and genetic variations. Despite extensive 
research, effective treatments remain unavailable due to the complexity of their 
pathologies and the biochemical pathways involved. A deep understanding of the 
complexities and individual differences associated with these disorders is 
crucial for developing effective treatments. In this background, this review 
provides a comprehensive overview of neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental 
disorders, including their clinical symptoms, etiology, pathogenesis, underlying 
mechanisms, potential drug targets, reported drugs, advanced treatment options, 
and challenges in the drug discovery process. This comprehensive literature 
review was conducted using databases such as PubMed and Scopus, focusing on 
research published up to April 2025. By understanding the complexities of these 
disorders, researchers can develop novel therapeutic approaches, including 
potential drugs and advanced treatment methods, to mitigate their devastating 
impact.

Alzheimer disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that frequently results 
in progressive cognitive decline. Despite the extensive research conducted on 
AD, there is presently no solution available due to its increasing prevalence. 
Recent research has suggested cervical lymphaticovenular anastomosis (LVA) as a 
therapeutic strategy to improve lymphatic outflow and potentially reduce AD 
symptoms. We established an amended LVA protocol to mitigate the risk of venous 
reflux, a prevalent issue associated with the original LVA methodology. A 
64-year-old man of Chinese descent exhibited the typical signs and symptoms of 
AD. The absence of substantial progress with standard medical treatment led to 
the consideration of LVA. We used a lower limb vein graft for the LVA, 
anastomosing it to the cervical lymphatic vessels and external jugular vein. The 
cognitive function of the patient got better after LVA, as shown by higher Mini 
Mental State Examination and Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores. Fewer 
β-amyloid and tau protein deposits were observed on positron emission 
tomography/computed tomography scans. No adverse occurrences or issues were 
observed. The success in this case demonstrated the potential role of LVA in the 
management of AD. However, further thorough research is required to evaluate the 
efficacy of our technique.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a highly inheritable neurodegenerative disorder for 
which pathway-specific genetic profiling provides insights into its key 
biological mechanisms and potential treatment targets. Traditional 
disease-pathway analyses for AD have certain limitations, such as environmental 
interference and arbitrary sample division. We present a comprehensive framework 
that starts with genome data, avoiding these drawbacks and offering intrinsic 
pathway-specific genetic profiling for AD. Whole genome sequencing data from 173 
individuals were used to quantify transcriptomes in 14 brain regions, estimate 
individual-level pathway variant scores, and analyze AD risk for each patient. 
These results were combined to identify AD-related pathways and quantify their 
interactions. The predicted expression levels were consistent with previous 
findings, and the estimated AD risk showed a significant correlation with 
Braak/Thal scores. A total of 3798 pathways were identified as potentially 
associated with AD, with about 19.7 % previously reported. The pathways 
identified as AD risk related primarily address six core biological themes, 
including: Immunity and inflammation, Metabolism, Protein homeostasis, DNA/RNA 
and Epigenetics, Synapse and structure, Cell cycle. Specifically, key pathways, 
such as NF-κB signaling and GSK3β activation, were linked to AD pathogenesis. 
The interactions among pathways highlighted shared gene functions in AD. In 
summary, we provided an effective framework for disease-pathway analysis, 
revealing the interdependence or compensatory effects of pathways in AD.

BACKGROUND: Kaixin San Jiawei Granule (KSG) is a traditional Chinese medicine 
formulation derived from classical prescriptions. Although it has shown promise 
in treating Alzheimer's disease (AD), its precise mechanisms of action remain 
unclear. This study aimed to systematically investigate the molecular mechanisms 
underlying KSG's therapeutic effects on AD through an integrative approach 
combining network pharmacology with experimental validation.
METHODS: An in vivo AD model was established in male KM mice via intraperitoneal 
injection of scopolamine. Cognitive function was assessed using the Morris water 
maze, and hippocampal levels of acetylcholine (ACh), acetylcholinesterase 
(AChE), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were 
measured using ELISA. In vitro, PC12 cells were exposed to Aβ25-35 to induce 
apoptosis. Immunofluorescence staining, Western blotting, and qPCR were used to 
assess the expression of amyloid-beta (Aβ), apoptosis-related protein caspase-3, 
and inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β). Active components of KSG and their 
potential targets and pathways were identified using mass spectrometry and 
network pharmacology, while partial validation was performed using molecular 
docking and Western blotting.
RESULTS: In vivo, KSG significantly alleviated scopolamine-induced cognitive 
deficits in mice. Treatment increased hippocampal levels of ACh and GSH-Px while 
reducing AChE and ROS. In vitro, KSG mitigated Aβ25-35-induced cytotoxicity in 
PC12 cells, decreased Aβ accumulation, and downregulated the expression of TNF-α 
and IL-1β. However, KSG had no significant effect on telomerase activity, 
telomere length, or the expression of the telomere-associated protein POT1. Mass 
spectrometry and network pharmacology analyses identified genistein, quercetin, 
and apigenin as key active compounds with TP53, AKT1, PTGS2, and CNR2 identified 
as core targets. Molecular docking validation confirmed the favorable binding 
activity between them. The calcium signaling, PI3K-Akt, and MAPK pathways 
emerged as the primary enriched pathways.
CONCLUSION: KSG improves cognitive function and attenuates Aβ-induced neuronal 
damage in AD through multi-component, multi-target synergistic mechanisms. These 
effects appear to be mediated by modulation of the cholinergic system, 
inhibition of oxidative stress and inflammation, and suppression of neuronal 
apoptosis. These findings provide a theoretical basis and experimental support 
for developing novel AD therapies based on traditional Chinese medicine.

Prevalence and Determinants of Dementia Among Older Adults Attending Outpatient 
Clinics in a Tertiary Care Hospital in Thailand: A Secondary Data Analysis.

Hospital, Bangkok, THA.

BACKGROUND: Dementia is an increasing public health concern, particularly in 
aging societies. While most prevalence estimates in Thailand are derived from 
community-based studies, less is known about the burden and risk factors of 
dementia in tertiary care outpatients, who often present with multimorbidity.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study using secondary data 
from patients aged ≥60 years attending internal medicine, neurology, and 
geriatric outpatient clinics of Phramongkutklao Hospital, a tertiary hospital in 
Bangkok, Thailand, between January 1 and December 31, 2024. Dementia was 
identified using a hierarchical algorithm incorporating International 
Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnostic codes, 
prescriptions for anti-dementia medications, and cognitive test results, with 
sensitivity analyses using stricter definitions. Independent variables included 
demographic characteristics, vascular and non-vascular comorbidities, medication 
use, and laboratory results. Prevalence was calculated with 95% confidence 
intervals (CI). Poisson regression with robust variance estimation was used to 
calculate crude and adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) for associated factors.
RESULTS: Of 4,100 older adults, 512 had dementia (12.5%). Alzheimer's disease 
was the most frequent subtype, accounting for 278 cases (54.3% of dementia; 6.8% 
of the total sample). In univariable analysis, dementia was associated with age 
≥80 years, female sex, low education, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, 
stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA) history, depression, and an 
Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden (ACB) score ≥3. After adjustment, age ≥80 years 
remained the strongest determinant (aPR 2.41, 95% CI 1.92-3.01). Female sex (aPR 
1.28, 95% CI 1.07-1.53), education ≤6 years (aPR 1.64, 95% CI 1.33-2.01), 
hypertension (aPR 1.21, 95% CI 1.02-1.43), diabetes mellitus (aPR 1.27, 95% CI 
1.07-1.52), stroke/TIA (aPR 1.89, 95% CI 1.52-2.35), depression (aPR 1.48, 95% 
CI 1.16-1.90), and ACB score ≥3 (aPR 1.36, 95% CI 1.09-1.70) were all 
independently associated with dementia.
CONCLUSION: Dementia was common among tertiary care outpatients, with prevalence 
higher than community-based estimates. Advanced age, female sex, low education, 
vascular comorbidities, depression, and anticholinergic medication burden were 
significant correlates. These findings highlight the need for routine screening, 
aggressive vascular risk factor management, and medication review in tertiary 
care settings to mitigate the burden of dementia.

The inherent complexity of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and failed clinical trials 
have spiked the interest in multifunctional ligands that target at least two key 
disease-associated macromolecules in AD pathology. Here we present a focused 
series of pleiotropic N-carbamoylazole prodrugs with dual mechanism of action. 
Pseudo-irreversible inhibition of the first therapeutic target, human 
butyrylcholinesterase (hBChE), enhances cholinergic transmission, and thereby 
provides symptomatic treatment, same as the standard therapeutics in use for AD. 
Simultaneously, this step also functions as a metabolic activation that 
liberates a nanomolar selective α 2-adrenergic antagonist atipamezole, which 
blocks pathological amyloid β (Aβ)-induced and noradrenaline-dependent 
activation of GSK3β that ultimately leads to hyperphosphorylation of tau, thus 
achieving a disease-modifying effect. Lead compound 8 demonstrated long-term 
pseudo-irreversible hBChE inhibition, metabolic activation in human plasma, 
blood-brain barrier permeability, and p.o. bioavailability in mice. Multi-day in 
vivo treatment with 8 in an Aβ-induced AD murine model revealed a significant 
alleviation of cognitive deficit that was comparable to rivastigmine, the 
current drug of choice for AD therapy. Furthermore, decreased GSK3β activation 
and lowered tau phosphorylation were observed in APP/PS1 mice. This surpasses 
the symptomatic-only treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors, as it directly 
blocks an essential pathological cascade in AD. Therefore, these multifunctional 
α 2-adrenergic antagonists-butyrylcholinesterase inhibitors, exemplified by lead 
compound 8, present an innovative, small molecule-based, disease-modifying 
approach to treatment of AD.

The translation of genetic findings from genome-wide association studies into 
actionable therapeutics persists as a critical challenge in Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) research. Here, we present PI4AD, a computational medicine framework that 
integrates multi-omics data, systems biology, and artificial neural networks for 
therapeutic discovery. This framework leverages multi-omic and network evidence 
to deliver three core functionalities: clinical target prioritisation; 
self-organising prioritisation map construction, distinguishing AD-specific 
targets from those linked to neuropsychiatric disorders; and pathway 
crosstalk-informed therapeutic discovery. PI4AD successfully recovers clinically 
validated targets like APP and ESR1, confirming its prioritisation efficacy. Its 
artificial neural network component identifies disease-specific molecular 
signatures, while pathway crosstalk analysis reveals critical nodal genes (e.g., 
HRAS and MAPK1), drug repurposing candidates, and clinically relevant network 
modules. By validating targets, elucidating disease-specific therapeutic 
potentials, and exploring crosstalk mechanisms, PI4AD bridges genetic insights 
with pathway-level biology, establishing a systems genetics foundation for 
rational therapeutic development. Importantly, its emphasis on Ras-centred 
pathways-implicated in synaptic dysfunction and neuroinflammation-provides a 
strategy to disrupt AD progression, complementing conventional 
amyloid/tau-focused paradigms, with the future potential to redefine treatment 
strategies in conjunction with mRNA therapeutics and thereby advance 
translational medicine in neurodegeneration.

Delirium is a common cause and complication of hospitalization in the elderly 
and is associated with higher risk of future dementia and progression of 
existing dementia, of which 70% is Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD and delirium, 
which are known to be aggravated by one another, represent significant societal 
challenges, especially in light of the absence of effective treatments. The 
intricate biological mechanisms have led to numerous clinical trial setbacks and 
likely contribute to the limited efficacy of existing therapeutics. Artificial 
intelligence (AI) presents a promising avenue for overcoming these hurdles by 
deploying algorithms to uncover hidden patterns across diverse data types. This 
review explores the pivotal role of AI in revolutionizing drug discovery for AD 
and delirium from target identification to the development of small molecule and 
protein-based therapies. Recent advances in deep learning, particularly in 
accurate protein structure prediction, are facilitating novel approaches to drug 
design and expediting the discovery pipeline for biological and small molecule 
therapeutics. This review concludes with an appraisal of current achievements 
and limitations, and touches on prospects for the use of AI in advancing drug 
discovery in AD and delirium, emphasizing its transformative potential in 
addressing these two and possibly other neurodegenerative conditions.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by cognitive decline and memory loss, with few effective 
treatments currently available. The multifactorial nature of AD, shaped by 
genetic, environmental, and biological factors, complicates both research and 
clinical management. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and 
multi-omics technologies provide new opportunities to elucidate the molecular 
mechanisms of AD and identify early biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis. 
AI-driven approaches such as machine learning, deep learning, and network-based 
models have enabled the integration of large-scale genomic, transcriptomic, 
proteomic, metabolomic, and microbiomic datasets. These efforts have facilitated 
the discovery of novel molecular signatures and therapeutic targets. Methods 
including deep belief networks and joint deep semi-non-negative matrix 
factorization have contributed to improvements in disease classification and 
patient stratification. However, ongoing challenges remain. These include data 
heterogeneity, limited interpretability of complex models, a lack of large and 
diverse datasets, and insufficient clinical validation. The absence of 
standardized multi-omics data processing methods further restricts progress. 
This review systematically summarizes recent advances in AI-driven multi-omics 
research in AD, highlighting achievements in early diagnosis and biomarker 
discovery while discussing limitations and future directions needed to advance 
these approaches toward clinical application.

BACKGROUND: Deep cervical lymphaticovenular anastomosis (dcLVA) surgery is able 
to control aging-associated Alzheimer's disease in patients. However, the 
efficacy rate remains unknown.
OBJECTIVE: This study is designed to test the surgery efficacy in the treatment 
of mild-to-moderate AD patients.
METHODS: This is a single-center retrospective study of dcLVA treatment of 
mild-to-moderate AD for 3 months. A total of 41 patients received the surgery, 
in which lymph vessels and lymph nodes in the district III of cervical area were 
identified using indocyanine fluorescence dye. The afferent lymphatics of the 
obstructed lymph nodes were connected to the jugular vein to fix the lymphatic 
blockage under a fluorescent microscope. The efficacy rate was examined at 
3-month post-surgery by clinical scores and biomarkers.
RESULTS: Lymph flow obstruction was observed on both sides of cervical area in 
the AD patients. The obstruction was successfully resolved through the surgery, 
and AD progression was attenuated or even reversed in the patients according to 
improvement in the scales of MMSE, ADL, NPI, CDR-SB, and CGI-EI. The average 
effectiveness rate was 50% by the CDR-SB score improvement. The efficacy was 
higher with shorter disease duration but not influenced by age and APOE4 
genotype. Aβ42/40 ratio and p-tau181 were improved in more than 67% patients. 
There were 2 cases of mild adverse reactions that were controlled immediately by 
regular treatments.
CONCLUSIONS: The data demonstrate that dcLVA surgery is an effective and safe 
therapy for AD in mild-to-moderate patients with 50% efficacy rate as measured 
by improvement of the CDR-SB score.

BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests statins may influence cognition in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), but specific use patterns in AD patients remain unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To identify factors influencing statin use in AD and explore 
associations between statins, cholesterol, and cognition, evaluated with 
Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) at dementia diagnosis.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study using data from the Swedish Registry for 
Dementia and Cognitive Disorders (SveDem) and Stockholm Creatinine Measurements 
(SCREAM) from 2007 to 2018. Multivariable logistic regression examined 
associations between baseline characteristics and statin use, while linear 
regression analyzed relationships between statins, cholesterol levels, and MMSE 
scores.
RESULTS: We included 3074 AD patients (mean age 78.1 years; 59.4% women), of 
whom 1028 used statins (79.6% simvastatin, 20.4% atorvastatin). Patients with 
diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, or stroke had greater odds of 
receiving statins. Older patients had slightly lower odds of receiving any 
statin at baseline (simvastatin use OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.97-0.99). Simvastatin 
users had 0.53 points higher MMSE on average at baseline compared to non-users 
of statins (se 0.23, p = 0.021). Higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
(LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) 
levels were associated with higher MMSE in non-users of statins, but not in 
statin users.
CONCLUSIONS: Younger AD patients and those with cardiovascular disease were more 
likely to use statins. Simvastatin use was linked to higher cognitive scores at 
diagnosis. In non-users, higher LDL-C, TC, and HDL-C levels correlated with 
better baseline cognitive scores. Longitudinal studies are needed to investigate 
the effects of statins on cognitive decline in AD.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that causes 
a decline in cognitive functions, considerably affecting a patient's life. 
Recently, virtual reality (VR) technology has emerged as a new tool used in the 
cognitive training of patients with AD.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the safety, feasibility, and clinical 
efficacy of VR-based cognitive training for patients with mild to moderate AD.
METHODS: Thirteen participants diagnosed with mild to moderate AD underwent VR 
training sessions by using the MentiTree software. Each session was conducted 
for 30 min twice a week for 9 weeks (total of 540 min). Cognitive functions were 
assessed before and after the intervention.
RESULTS: Although 1 of the 13 participants experienced adverse effects, the 
9-week cognitive training was well tolerated and had a high feasibility of 
93%±24.65%. A tendency toward improvement was observed in the visual recognition 
memory of the participants (p = 0.034), but other domains did not significantly 
change.
CONCLUSIONS: VR-based cognitive training is safely accepted by patients with 
mild to moderate AD. The potential of VR in AD treatment should be further 
explored using a randomized control group.

Repetitive head impacts are associated with structural brain changes and an 
increased risk for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a progressive 
neurodegenerative disease that can only be diagnosed after death. Chronic 
traumatic encephalopathy is defined by the abnormal accumulation of 
phosphorylated tau protein, particularly at the depths of the superior frontal 
sulci, suggesting that sulcal morphology may serve as a relevant structural 
biomarker. Contact sport athletes, such as former football players, are at 
elevated risk due to their prolonged exposure to repetitive head impacts. 
Cortical atrophy linked to underlying tau accumulation may result in shallower 
and wider sulci, potentially making sulcal morphology an imaging marker for 
identifying individuals at risk for this disease. This study investigated sulcal 
morphological differences in former football players and examined associations 
with age, football-related exposure, clinical diagnosis of traumatic 
encephalopathy syndrome, levels of certainty for chronic traumatic 
encephalopathy pathology, neuropsychological performance, and positron emission 
tomography imaging using flortaucipir. We analysed structural magnetic resonance 
imaging data from 169 male former football players (mean age 57.2 (8.2) years, 
range 45-74) and 54 age-matched, unexposed asymptomatic male controls (mean age 
59.4 (8.5) years, range 45-74). Sulcal depth and width were quantified using the 
CalcSulc, focusing on two regions in each hemisphere commonly affected by 
chronic traumatic encephalopathy pathology: the superior frontal and 
occipitotemporal sulci. Generalized least squares models were used to assess 
group differences and interactions with age and football exposure variables, 
including age of first exposure, total years played, and cumulative head impact 
exposure. An analysis of covariance evaluated relationships between sulcal 
morphology, clinical measures, and flortaucipir uptake, adjusting for age, race, 
body mass index, education, imaging site, apolipoprotein E4 status, and total 
intracranial volume. Former football players demonstrated significantly 
shallower sulcal depth in the left superior frontal sulcus compared to unexposed 
controls. Earlier age of first exposure and longer football careers were 
associated with greater widening of the left occipitotemporal sulcus. Higher 
cumulative head impact exposure was linked to reduced sulcal depth in the left 
superior frontal region. However, sulcal morphology was not associated with 
clinical diagnosis, levels of certainty, neuropsychological test performance, or 
flortaucipir imaging. These findings suggest that sulcal morphology may reflect 
cumulative exposure to repetitive head impacts, particularly in brain regions 
vulnerable to chronic traumatic encephalopathy pathology. Future ante- and 
post-mortem validation studies are needed to determine whether sulcal morphology 
can serve as a reliable in vivo biomarker of risk.

Accurate differential diagnosis of dementia is essential for guiding timely 
treatment, particularly as anti-amyloid therapies become more widely available 
and require precise patient characterization. Here, we developed a 
radiomics-based machine learning (ML) approach to enhance neuroimaging 
assessments in distinguishing Alzheimer's disease (AD) from other 
imaging-evident dementias (OIED). We retrospectively analyzed 1041 individuals 
from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center with confirmed dementia 
diagnoses and at least one T1 or T2/FLAIR MRI scan. Using FastSurfer and a 
Lesion Prediction Algorithm, we extracted volumetric and lesion features, which 
were then used to train ML models. Model performance was compared to the 
independent evaluations of seven fellowship-trained neuroradiologists. The 
classifier achieved an AUROC of 0.79 ± 0.01 for AD and 0.66 ± 0.03 for OIED, 
performing comparably to expert assessments. Interpretation using SHAP values 
showed strong alignment with imaging features known to align with AD or OIED, 
respectively. These findings highlight the potential of radiomics to augment 
neuroimaging workflows.

Aging is the strongest risk factor for cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), yet the mechanisms underlying brain aging and their modulation by 
pharmacological interventions remain poorly defined. The hippocampus, essential 
for learning and memory, is particularly vulnerable to metabolic stress and 
inflammation. Canagliflozin (Cana), an FDA-approved sodium-glucose 
co-transporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) for type 2 diabetes, extends lifespan in 
male but not female mice, but its impact on brain aging is unknown. Here, we 
used a multi-omics strategy integrating transcriptomics, proteomics, and 
metabolomics to investigate how chronic Cana treatment reprograms brain aging in 
genetically diverse UM-HET3 mice. In males, Cana induced mitochondrial function, 
insulin and cGMP-PKG signaling, and suppressed neuroinflammatory networks across 
all molecular layers, resulting in improved hippocampal-dependent learning and 
memory. In females, transcriptional activation of neuroprotective pathways did 
not translate to protein or metabolite-level changes and failed to rescue 
cognition. In the 5xFAD AD model, Cana reduced amyloid plaque burden, 
microgliosis, and memory deficits in males only, despite comparable peripheral 
glucose improvements in both sexes. Our study reveals sex-specific remodeling of 
hippocampal aging by a clinically available SGLT2i, with implications for AD 
pathology and lifespan extension, and highlights Cana's potential to combat 
brain aging and AD through sex-specific mechanisms.

Increasing evidence indicates skeletal muscle function is associated with 
cognition. Muscle-secreted protease Cathepsin B (Ctsb) is linked to memory in 
animals and humans, but has an unclear role in neurodegenerative diseases. To 
address this question, we utilized an AAV-vector-mediated approach to express 
Ctsb in skeletal muscle of APP/PS1 Alzheimer's disease (AD) model mice. Mice 
were treated with Ctsb at 4 months of age, followed by behavioral analyses 
6 months thereafter. Here we show that muscle-targeted Ctsb treatment results in 
long-term improvements in motor coordination, memory function, and adult 
hippocampal neurogenesis, while plaque pathology and neuroinflammation remain 
unchanged. Additionally, in AD mice, Ctsb treatment normalizes hippocampal, 
muscle, and plasma proteomic profiles to resemble that of wildtype (WT) 
controls. In AD mice, Ctsb increases the abundance of hippocampal proteins 
involved in mRNA metabolism and protein synthesis, including those relevant to 
adult neurogenesis and memory function. Furthermore, Ctsb treatment enhances 
plasma metabolic and mitochondrial processes. In muscle, Ctsb treatment elevates 
protein translation in AD mice, whereas in WT mice mitochondrial proteins 
decrease. In WT mice, Ctsb treatment causes memory deficits and results in 
protein profiles across tissues that are comparable to AD control mice. Overall, 
the biological changes in the treatment groups are consistent with effects on 
memory function. Thus, skeletal muscle Ctsb application has potential as an AD 
therapeutic intervention.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a formidable and complex neurodegenerative disorder 
driven by multifactorial interactions, including amyloid-beta (Aβ) aggregation, 
neurofibrillary tangles, and neuroinflammation etc. Current therapies mainly 
consist of cholinesterase inhibitors and NMDA receptor antagonists, which can 
alleviate symptoms but fail to reverse disease progression. In recent years, 
emerging approaches such as immunotherapy and gene therapy have shown potential 
but remain in clinical exploration. Phthalocyanine (Pc) compounds, with their 
ability to inhibit Aβ fibril formation, favorable biocompatibility, and optical 
properties, have demonstrated potential in AD diagnosis and treatment. This 
review discusses the pathogenesis, therapeutic strategies, and research progress 
of Pc compounds in AD. Furthermore, the elucidation of their mechanisms of 
action, the optimization of blood-brain barrier penetration, and the promotion 
of clinical translation are needed to provide new directions for AD therapy.

[Precautions for Neurosurgeons in Administering Anti-Amyloid β Antibody 
Therapy].

[Article in Japanese]

Shichijo F(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Neurosurgery, Suzue Hospital.

In Japan, anti-amyloid β (Aβ) monoclonal antibodies, including lecanemab and 
donanemab, have recently been approved as disease-modifying therapies for 
early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD). These drugs, developed based on the 
amyloid cascade hypothesis, target toxic Aβ aggregates: lecanemab selectively 
binds to soluble protofibrils, while donanemab targets Aβ plaques. The Ministry 
of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) has issued Optimal Use Guidelines that 
specify criteria for administration: informed consent from both patients and 
caregivers; cognitive assessments (MMSE and CDR); confirmation of Aβ pathology 
via amyloid PET or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing; and MRI screening to 
assess the risk of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA). ARIA is a 
significant adverse event and requires regular MRI monitoring. Initial 
administration is limited to certified facilities staffed by experienced 
specialists and equipped with the necessary diagnostic infrastructure. After six 
months, treatment may be continued at collaborating institutions. The APOEε4 
genotype is a known risk factor for ARIA but is not covered by insurance. 
Caution is advised when co-administering anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents. 
The guidelines also require the use of official treatment cards to inform 
healthcare providers. This article summarizes the clinical precautions, 
diagnostic requirements, and facility standards necessary for implementing 
anti-Aβ antibody therapy in accordance with current MHLW Guidelines in Japan.

[Hydrocephalus and Dementia].

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH), also known as Hakim's disease, 
is a major cause of reversible dementia in adults. iNPH primarily affects 
frontal lobe-related cognitive functions, including attention, executive 
function, and working memory, even in early stages. Although memory impairment 
is also present, recognition memory is often preserved, distinguishing iNPH from 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia 
(BPSD), especially apathy, depression, and anxiety, are common in iNPH and are 
generally less active than those seen in AD. Neuropsychological assessments 
reveal significant impairments in frontal lobe tests such as the Frontal 
Assessment Battery and Trail Making Test-B. Shunt surgery leads to substantial 
improvement in attention and executive function, reflecting the reversible 
nature of iNPH. However, memory functions, particularly delayed recall, show 
limited recovery, indicating possible overlap with neurodegenerative mechanisms. 
Early surgical intervention is associated with better outcomes, while delayed 
treatment or advanced brain atrophy may reduce effectiveness. Comprehensive 
cognitive evaluation is essential for assessing treatment response, planning 
rehabilitation, and providing appropriate patient and family guidance.

[Pharmacological Interventions in Dementia].

[Article in Japanese]

Ota M(1), Arai T.

Author information:

Medicine, University of Tsukuba.

Pharmacological interventions for dementia include medications aimed at 
alleviating its core symptom: cognitive dysfunction. These medicines are known 
as anti-dementia drugs. As our understanding of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has 
advanced, the amyloid hypothesis stating that amyloid proteins are involved in 
the pathogenesis of AD has been proposed. To date, anti-dementia drugs such as 
cholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists have 
focused on symptomatic treatment. In recent years, based on the amyloid 
hypothesis, the development of medicines that target either (1) the enzyme that 
produces amyloid beta (Aβ) or (2) Aβ itself, has been promoted as a treatment 
strategy for AD. In 2021, the first drug targeting Aβ, aducanumab, was launched 
in the USA. In Japan, lecanemab and donanemab are now available as monoclonal 
antibodies targeting Aβ. Additionally, medications have been used to manage the 
behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), Parkinsonism, and 
rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder. Furthermore, dementia is a major 
risk factor for delirium, which often occurs during the course of dementia. In 
this study, we introduce pharmacotherapy with anti-dementia drugs, BPSD 
treatment, and delirium.

[Current Status and Future Perspectives of Biomarkers in Alzheimer's Disease 
Diagnosis].

[Article in Japanese]

Ishiguro T(1), Kasuga K.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, characterized by 
the pathological accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) and phosphorylated tau in the 
brain. Recent advances in biomarker technology have significantly improved AD 
diagnosis and treatment. Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers and amyloid positron 
emission tomography imaging are now available in clinical settings and serve as 
key tools in identifying early-stage AD, especially when considering anti-Aβ 
monoclonal antibody therapies. In 2024, the Alzheimer's Association proposed 
revised diagnostic criteria that integrate both biomarker-based and clinical 
staging systems. This framework introduces a classification of "core biomarkers" 
that reflect AD-specific pathology and defines biological and clinical symptom 
stages. Furthermore, blood-based biomarkers, such as plasma p-tau217 and 
MTBR-tau243, are gaining attention as minimally invasive tools for early 
diagnosis and disease staging. As these biomarkers become more accessible, 
proper interpretation within a clinical context remains essential. In Japan, 
biomarker testing is currently recommended only for symptomatic individuals, and 
its use requires careful judgment regarding indications and relevance to the 
clinical setting. This review outlines the evolution of diagnostic criteria, 
current and emerging biomarkers, and their implications for personalized AD care 
while emphasizing the need for expert clinical interpretation to ensure 
responsible and patient-centric use.

[Neuroimaging in Dementia Diagnosis:Up to Date].

[Article in Japanese]

Shiino A(1).

With the clinical application of monoclonal antibody therapy for Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), diagnostic techniques are shifting toward molecular-targeted 
imaging. The development of tracers for positron emission tomography (PET) 
targeting abnormal proteins associated with the disease, such as amyloid-beta 
and tau, has enabled the detection of neuropathological changes in AD in vivo. 
This study will contribute to the clinical diagnosis, staging, and monitoring of 
potential therapeutic approaches for AD. In general outpatient care, imaging 
modalities that employ widely available techniques such as magnetic resonance 
imaging or single-photon emission computed tomography remain necessary. This 
article provides a synopsis of the American College of Radiology recommendations 
concerning the clinical utility of neuroimaging techniques and reviews the 
temporal progression of in vivo pathologies derived from amyloid and tau PETs. 
We investigated the methods for distinguishing between the AD continuum and SNAP 
in patients with mild cognitive impairment using the ADNI database. Accurate 
assessment of the "cortical signature" is essential for the diagnosis of AD. 
Voxel-based morphometry is a useful tool because cortical atrophy is associated 
with the extension of tau PET lesions. Confirmation of cortical atrophy in 
conjunction with hippocampal atrophy offers diagnostic insights that facilitate 
the identification of AD.

Dementia is classified into various types with corresponding underlying 
pathologies, including Alzheimer's disease, dementia wiht Lewy bodies, and 
vascular dementia; final diagnosis is often possible only after a pathological 
examination during an autopsy. Furthermore, older adults often have comorbid 
pathologies that make clinical diagnosis even more difficult. While 
protein-targeted treatments are emerging, different dementia types have varying 
pathologies and prognoses, necessitating efforts to improve diagnostic accuracy 
while the patient is alive. To achieve this, autopsy diagnosis information must 
be correlated with clinical biomarker data.

BACKGROUND: Contact sports, including rugby union, are associated with higher 
rates of neurodegenerative dementia, due to various underlying pathologies such 
as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). New 
ultrasensitive multiplexed immunoassays may clarify disease mechanisms after 
repetitive head impacts (RHI) and traumatic brain injury, potentially aiding 
risk-stratification, early diagnosis and dementia treatment.
METHODS: Midlife participants in the ABHC cohort underwent plasma biomarker 
quantification (NULISA - NUcleic acid Linked Immuno-Sandwich Assay; n=124 
markers), 3T MRI, trauma exposure ascertainment and phenotyping. Regressions 
quantified exposure-specific protein expression, relationship to trauma 
(including position) and brain atrophy, using cluster analysis to test 
correlates of traumatic encephalopathy syndrome (TES).
RESULTS: 197 former elite rugby players and 33 controls were assessed. 24 
(12.2%) met criteria for TES but none had dementia. Ex-players returned reduced 
plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), kallikrein-6 (KLK6) and 
synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP25). Ex-forwards specifically showed 
reduced plasma beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), 
amyloid beta-38 (Aβ38), and increased phospho-tau181 (p-tau181). KLK6 was lower 
in ex-backs than controls. No biomarkers related to career duration, concussion 
load or regional brain volume, nor did clustering relate to TES.
CONCLUSIONS: Ex-players showed distinctive plasma biomarker changes, more 
prominently in ex-forwards, possibly reflecting greater RHI exposure. Plasma 
KLK6, an endothelial serine protease, was reduced across the ex-player group, 
with potential diagnostic or prognostic utility in future. Reduced GFAP and 
SNAP25 in ex-forwards has an uncertain basis, while elevated p-tau-181 more so 
than p-tau217 points towards non-AD tau pathology. Our findings motivate 
longitudinal characterisation, including comparison with other neurodegenerative 
diseases.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent form of dementia, leads to 
progressive cognitive decline due to pathological hallmarks including amyloid 
plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, synaptic loss, neuroinflammation, and neuronal 
cell death, highlighting the urgent need for multitarget therapeutic strategies. 
The p38α mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38α MAPK) pathway is a key regulator 
of neuroinflammation and has been implicated in AD pathogenesis. Additionally, 
dysregulation of p38α MAPK is associated with tumorigenesis, making it a 
promising target for both neurodegenerative and proliferative diseases. In this 
article, a series of benzoxazole derivatives is designed and synthesized to 
evaluate their dual inhibitory potential against p38α MAPK and 
acetylcholinesterase (AChE), aiming for a multifaceted therapeutic approach to 
AD. A total of 31 compounds are synthesized and assessed for their 
antiproliferative activity, p38α MAPK inhibition, and AChE inhibitory effects. 
In vitro assays demonstrate that several compounds exhibit potent dual 
inhibition of p38α MAPK and AChE, while molecular docking studies provide 
insights into their binding interactions within the active sites. These findings 
suggest that benzoxazole-based scaffolds offer a promising framework for the 
development of dual-acting inhibitors targeting both neuroinflammation and 
tumorigenesis. Further in vivo and mechanistic studies are warranted to explore 
their therapeutic potential.

To assess the influence of the nature of the anticholinesterase pharmacophore on 
the properties of potential multitarget Alzheimer's disease (AD) agents, new 
conjugates of tacrine (3a, b) and amiridine (5a, b) with 
ethyl-2-aminomethylidene-4,4,4-trifluoro-3-oxobutanoate linked by an alkylene 
spacer with n = 4,6 were synthesized. All conjugates are effective 
cholinesterase inhibitors with predominant inhibition of butyrylcholinesterase 
(BChE). The inhibitory activity of tacrine conjugates 3a, b toward 
acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and BChE increases with spacer elongation: IC50 AChE 
up to 0.185 µM, IC50 BChE up to 0.0806 µM. Amiridine conjugates 5a, b are less 
active as AChE inhibitors and their anti-AChE activity (IC50 up to 3.09 µM) 
remains virtually unchanged with spacer elongation, while anti-BChE activity 
increases significantly (n = 6, IC50 = 0.063 µM), which leads to increased 
selectivity toward BChE (up to 56). The effects are consistent with the results 
of kinetic studies and molecular docking of 3b and 5b. Both types of conjugates 
displace propidium from the AChE peripheral anionic site at the level of and 
above that of donepezil, and are capable of blocking self-aggregation of 
β-amyloid (up to 49.5%). The compounds demonstrate very weak antioxidant 
activity (tacrine conjugates) or its absence (amiridine). Thus, new conjugates 
are potential multitarget anti-AD agents with high selectivity toward BChE for 
amiridine derivative 5b.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder marked by 
gradual cognitive deterioration and distinct neuropathological characteristics. 
The abnormal accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) 
are the hallmarks of AD. In fact, synaptic loss and damage occur earlier than 
amyloid plaques and NFTs in the progression of AD and are most closely 
associated with the cognitive deficits exhibited by AD patients. In this review, 
we discuss the expression level, localization, posttranslational modification 
and interaction proteins of PSD-95, as well as their roles in synaptic 
plastisity. We also review the mechanisms through which PSD-95 contributes to 
synaptic dysfunction in AD. Moreover, the potential of PSD-95 as an early 
biomarker for AD is also discussed, along with the therapeutic approaches that 
target PSD-95 for patients afflicted with the disease. The objective of this 
review is to offer comprehensive insights into the early pathogenesis of 
Alzheimer's disease and to aid in the development of novel diagnostic and 
treatment methodologies grounded in this understanding.

The interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 2 (IFIT2) is a 
crucial member of the interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) family, widely 
acknowledged for its antiviral activity. IFIT2 functions primarily through 
AU-rich RNA binding, aiding in viral suppression by inhibiting protein 
translation and promoting apoptosis via mitochondrial pathways. While 
traditionally known for its role in antiviral defence, emerging research 
highlights its broader significance in cancer, bacterial and fungal infections, 
autoimmune diseases, neurological disorders, and metabolic and cardiovascular 
conditions. Notably, IFIT2 is the only IFIT family member with established 
tumour suppressor properties, demonstrating anti-proliferative effects in 
multiple cancers, including lung, renal, colorectal, breast, and gallbladder 
cancers. Beyond oncology, IFIT2 has been implicated in the host response to 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Plasmodium spp., Candida albicans, and Treponema 
pallidum, where it modulates immune responses and infection outcomes. It is 
upregulated in several autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, 
Sjögren's syndrome, and multiple sclerosis, suggesting its potential as a 
diagnostic and therapeutic biomarker. Furthermore, transcriptomic analyses have 
linked IFIT2 to disease progression and treatment response in conditions like 
diabetic ulcers, gestational diabetes, ischaemic cardiomyopathy, schizophrenia, 
and Alzheimer's disease. This review thoroughly examines the molecular 
structure, regulatory mechanisms, and diverse roles of IFIT2 in human diseases. 
It addresses its interaction with key immune pathways, its ability to modulate 
apoptosis and inflammation, and its potential as a prognostic marker and 
therapeutic target. Although its mechanistic functions in numerous diseases 
remain only partly understood, IFIT2 emerges as a versatile immune effector with 
considerable translational promise. Further investigation into its biological 
roles will be crucial for utilising its therapeutic potential across infectious, 
inflammatory, metabolic, and neoplastic diseases.

BACKGROUND: Astrocytes play a crucial role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
pathogenesis, contributing to inflammation, amyloid plaque formation, and 
disease progression, making them promising therapeutic targets. Despite 
extensive research, the mechanisms underlying astrocytic dysfunction in AD and 
their modulation by phytochemicals remain incompletely understood, representing 
a critical gap in current knowledge.
PURPOSE: This review aims to elucidate the pathological mechanisms involving 
astrocytes in AD and evaluate the therapeutic potential of phytochemicals in 
modulating astrocytic activity.
METHODS: We systematically analysed recent studies on astrocytic activation, 
target receptors, and signalling pathways in AD and their regulation by 
phytochemicals. The studies were identified through searches of databases 
including PubMed, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar.
RESULTS: Our findings reveal that abnormal activation of astrocytic receptors 
and downstream signaling pathways, such as RAGE/NF-κB, ERK/c-fos/NFATc1, 
AKT/Nrf2/NF-κB, and PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β, disrupt immune homeostasis in AD models. 
Phytochemicals, including tanshinone IIA, honokiol, aucubin, cornuside, 
luteolin, naringenin, daphnetin, and gelsemine, show promising effects in 
delaying AD progression. These effects are mediated through multiple mechanisms, 
such as inhibiting pro-inflammatory pathways, enhancing anti-inflammatory 
responses, promoting Aβ clearance, stimulating synaptogenesis, regulating 
neurotrophic factors, and reducing oxidative stress. These findings highlight 
the pivotal role of astrocytes in AD pathophysiology and the potential of 
phytochemicals to modulate astrocytic dysfunction.
CONCLUSIONS: By providing a comprehensive overview of astrocytic mechanisms and 
therapeutic interventions, this review offers a theoretical foundation for 
developing phytochemical-based strategies in AD therapy and underscores the need 
for further preclinical and clinical investigations to translate these findings 
into practical treatments.

Transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) has emerged as a potential 
neuromodulatory intervention for Alzheimer's disease (AD). This pilot 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluated TUS's safety and 
preliminary efficacy in patients with mild AD. Patients aged 50-90 years were 
enrolled and randomly assigned at a 2:1 ratio to receive TUS treatment for 30 
sessions (15 min/day, 5 days/week for 6 weeks) or a placebo procedure. Safety 
was monitored through magnetic resonance imaging, adverse event reporting, and 
laboratory assessments. Efficacy was assessed with the Alzheimer's Disease 
Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) and the Mini-Mental State 
Examination (MMSE). Nine of 30 patients screened were enrolled (six TUS, three 
placebo). All patients completed the study, and no serious clinical or 
radiographic adverse events related to TUS were observed. At 52 weeks, the 
change in ADAS-cog score from baseline remained relatively stable in the TUS 
group compared to worsening in the placebo group (0.5 ± 4.7 vs. 5.0 ± 4.0, 
p = 0.237), particularly in the memory domain. The change in MMSE score from 
baseline showed a significant benefit in the TUS group at 24 weeks compared to 
placebo (2.2 ± 2.2 vs. -3.0 ± 2.6, p < 0.05), and this improvement persisted to 
52 weeks. This study demonstrates the safety and feasibility of repeated TUS 
sessions in AD and suggests potential benefits in preserving cognitive function. 
Larger, adequately powered trials are required to validate these preliminary 
findings and further define the therapeutic potential of TUS in AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent cause of dementia, characterized 
by progressive cognitive decline and cerebral metabolic impairment. Yet, the 
therapeutic options for addressing the disease pathogenesis are limited. Here, 
we report an approach by targeting brain nucleoside homeostasis and energy 
metabolism to alleviate AD-associated cognitive deficits. A compound, J4, was 
designed to modulate nucleoside homeostasis by interacting with the 
equilibrative nucleoside transporter-1 (ENT1). The effects of J4 on brain 
nucleoside homeostasis and energy metabolism were examined in mice. Two AD 
animal models, THY-Tau22 and APP/PS1 mice, were used to evaluate the 
translational potential of J4 for the treatment of AD. Cognitive function and 
functional ability were assessed using the Morris water maze, Y-maze, and 
nesting behavior tests. The pharmacodynamic marker was explored, and the 
pharmacokinetic and safety properties of J4 were evaluated. As a result, being 
administered after disease onset, oral J4 administration rescued memory and 
cognitive dysfunction in both tau and amyloid AD mouse models. Metabolomic 
analysis showed that J4 increased brain nucleoside levels and facilitated brain 
primary metabolism, including glucose metabolism and the pentose phosphate 
pathway. The [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) 
imaging further demonstrated that glucose metabolism can be used as a 
pharmacodynamic biomarker for the target engagement of J4 on ENT1. The 
nonclinical studies also demonstrated the ideal pharmacokinetic and safety 
profiles of J4, supporting that targeting nucleoside homeostasis can improve 
brain energy metabolism and is a promising approach for AD treatment.

Muscarinic agonists represent a new class of treatments for psychosis with a 
mechanism distinct from typical and atypical antipsychotics. The muscarinic 
subtype M4 has been proposed as the primary mediator of efficacy but results 
from recent clinical trials with M4-selective compounds have drawn this 
hypothesis into question. Instead, activation of both M1 and M4 receptor 
subtypes may be required for robust treatment effects. Here, we characterize the 
clinical-stage muscarinic agonist ML-007 in preclinical models and explore its 
therapeutic potential for treating psychosis in schizophrenia and Alzheimer's 
disease. ML-007 is a potent brain-penetrant agonist at both M1 and M4 muscarinic 
receptors that has demonstrated compelling efficacy across a range of 
preclinical models of psychosis in schizophrenia including amphetamine-induced 
hyperlocomotion, PCP-induced hyperlocomotion, and conditioned avoidance 
response. Moreover, ML-007 is approximately ten-fold more potent than the 
comparator xanomeline in all animal models. Dose-response experiments in M1 and 
M4 knockout mice reveal that the efficacy of ML-007 is dependent on both M1 and 
M4 receptors. Taken together, our data suggest that both M1 and M4 receptors 
contribute to the potent efficacy of ML-007 in preclinical rodent models of 
psychosis.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized 
by the dysregulation of multiple molecular mechanisms. In recent years, 
transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43) has increasingly been 
recognized as a critical pathological protein and has become a prominent focus 
in AD research. TDP-43 is involved not only in physiological processes such as 
RNA metabolism, protein quality control, and mitochondrial regulation but also 
in AD pathology through abnormal aggregation, dysregulated nucleocytoplasmic 
transport, and aberrant posttranslational modifications, leading to 
neurotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, and disrupted protein homeostasis. 
Studies have shown that TDP-43 closely interacts with two core pathological 
hallmarks of AD, β-amyloid (Aβ) and tau. By promoting Aβ oligomerization and tau 
hyperphosphorylation, TDP-43 accelerates the pathological progression of this 
disease. Given the multifaceted role of TDP-43 in AD, therapeutic strategies 
targeting TDP-43 have shown great potential. Approaches such as modulating its 
RNA splicing activity, inhibiting pathological aggregation, restoring the 
balance of nucleocytoplasmic transport, and preventing its mitochondrial 
localization offer new avenues for AD treatment. This review systematically 
summarizes the pathological mechanisms of TDP-43 in AD and its interactions with 
Aβ and tau and discusses the feasibility of targeting TDP-43 as a therapeutic 
strategy. Future studies should further elucidate the role of TDP-43 in the 
early stages of AD and develop specific therapeutic agents that target TDP-43, 
with the aim of providing new insights for precision treatment of AD.

While progressive cognitive decline is the defining feature of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), many patients also develop prominent neuropsychiatric symptoms, 
including anxiety and depression. The circuit-level mechanisms underlying these 
distinct symptom domains remain poorly understood, and treatments that address 
both cognitive and noncognitive aspects of AD are limited. Here, we identify 
anatomically, molecularly, and functionally distinct subpopulations of 
supramammillary (SuM) neurons that project to either the dorsal or ventral 
dentate gyrus (dDG or vDG). These distinct SuM neurons and their SuM-DG 
subcircuits selectively regulate memory and emotion, respectively. In AD model 
mice, SuM neurons targeting dDG or vDG display aberrant activity during memory 
or emotional processing, and importantly, targeted optogenetic activation of 
SuM-dDG or SuM-vDG pathways selectively restores cognitive or affective 
function. These findings reveal SuM-DG subcircuits as parallel modulators of 
cognitive and emotional states and highlight their potential as therapeutic 
targets for addressing the multifaceted symptomatology of AD.

"Personalized" interventions based on patients' "biomarkers" may be valuable for 
treatments that benefit only subsets of patients. The NMDA antagonist, 
memantine, slows clinical progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD); this effect 
is heterogeneous in magnitude and duration. This study tested whether acute 
cognitive or neurophysiological responses to memantine challenge predicted 
sensitivity to memantine's therapeutic effects. Thirty individuals with 
mild-to-moderate severity AD (M:F = 13:17) and 24 comparably aged healthy 
subjects (HCS) (M:F = 12:12) were enrolled. Participants with AD were 
characterized on 9 experimental measures and their changes after acute memantine 
"challenge" (20 mg). We then assessed whether acute memantine effects on these 
measures predicted clinical change over a 24-week open-label trial of memantine. 
Baseline cognitive (Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological 
Status) and neurophysiological measures (prepulse inhibition, P3a latency and 
auditory steady state response power and coherence) were impaired in 
participants with AD (p's<0.05-0.0001); neurophysiological deficits were 
modestly reduced by acute memantine challenge. As a group, participants with AD 
showed no significant clinical changes across 24 weeks of memantine treatment; 
subgroups exhibited either small gains or deterioration. With one exception 
(mismatch negativity latency, p < 0.017), sensitivity of experimental measures 
to acute memantine challenge did not significantly predict clinical sensitivity 
to memantine. In summary, a challenge dose design identified neurophysiological 
measures sensitive to memantine in mild-to-moderate severity AD; acute memantine 
effects on one measure weakly predicted clinical outcomes over 24 weeks. 
Impairment in specific measures among participants with AD, and their opposition 
by memantine, might inform future efforts to identify treatment biomarkers in 
AD.

INTRODUCTION: Cognitive impairment (CI) spans a spectrum from mild CI to severe 
dementia, with Alzheimer's disease (AD) the most prevalent cause of CI and 
dementia. Although dementia burden and prevalence in Arab countries reflect 
general global trends, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) differs from Western 
countries both culturally and regarding management resources. Further guidance 
is therefore needed for the diagnosis and management of CI in the UAE.
METHODS: A task force of eight neurologists and two non-voting collaborators 
with special dementia expertise was convened to develop evidence-based position 
statements/recommendations to guide the diagnosis and management of AD, 
including the use of amyloid-targeting therapies (ATTs), in the UAE clinical 
setting. A modified Delphi survey method was chosen to obtain a consensus, 
ensuring that drafted expert statements reflected diverse perspectives and 
experiences. Discordance was predefined as > 25% of panelists rating an expert 
statement as ≤ 3 on the Likert scale. Consensus was predefined as a median 
rating ≥ 7 without discordance. Expert statements achieving consensus were 
adopted.
RESULTS: A seven-step framework for diagnosing and managing CI in the UAE was 
developed, with consensus achieved on all statements. Recommendations largely 
aligned with international guidelines on AD dementia management and treatment, 
combined with UAE-specific guidance. The framework spans the full patient 
journey from initial symptoms to diagnosis (including biomarker use), initial 
treatment (including ATTs where appropriate), and subsequent monitoring and 
management as the disease progresses.
CONCLUSIONS: Management of CI and dementia in UAE requires consideration of 
international guidelines in the context of regional and local cultural 
sensitivities and healthcare resources. A holistic approach is recommended, 
combining appropriate pharmacological treatment with lifestyle interventions, 
education, and support for patients and care partners. Patients require ongoing 
monitoring to ensure the approach is tailored to the disease stage and provides 
optimal quality of life and reduced burden for patients and care partners.

Modern nutrition is a core element of clinical treatment. Although some 
literature addresses neuro-nutrition's effects on Alzheimer's disease (AD), a 
systematic discussion of how the body's six essential nutrients impact AD is 
lacking. Moreover, neural glial cells directly participate in the pathological 
regulation of AD. A novel conceptual framework linking "essential nutrients - 
glial cells - AD" needs to be summarized. Therefore, this review examines the 
regulatory roles of glial cells (astrocytes, microglia, and their networks) in 
AD and explores how essential nutrients impact AD via glial cells. Specifically, 
vitamins (NR, NMN, etc.), minerals (copper, iron, selenium, etc.), proteins and 
amino acids (arginine, citrulline, methionine, etc.), lipids (fatty acids, 
phosphatidylinositol, etc.), and carbohydrates (trehalose, oligosaccharides, 
plant polysaccharides, etc.) can influence important functions such as brain 
energy metabolism remodeling, inflammatory factor secretion, and phagocytic 
clearance by regulating microglia and astrocytes. Moreover, a significant 
strength of this review is its clear exposition of nutrient alterations observed 
in AD patients, coupled with detailed recommendations for nutritional 
interventions targeting AD prevention and management. Furthermore, it also 
investigated beneficial dietary patterns for improving AD. In conclusion, this 
review explores the "essential nutrients -glial cell" molecular interactions, 
laying the foundation for precision nutrition-based AD strategies.

Plain Language Summary: This review elaborates on the dual role mechanism of 
glial cells in the pathological regulation of Alzheimer’s disease (AD).This 
review examines how macronutrients and micronutrients influence AD via glial 
cell modulation, exploring “nutrition-glial cell” interactions.The changes in 
nutrient profiles of AD patients are clearly presented, and targeted nutritional 
intervention suggestions are proposed.Dietary patterns that promote brain health 
are explored to develop personalized health intervention plans.

BACKGROUND: With the increasing prevalence of obesity and its negative 
consequences on health, weight management emerges as a priority for public 
health, especially in older adults, in whom obesity is linked to increased risks 
of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease. We performed a study 
investigating the association of intentional weight loss through dietary 
intervention on cardiometabolic health among older adults participating in the 
MIND trial.
METHODS: The MIND trial enrolled overweight individuals aged 65-84 who 
self-reported a suboptimal diet. Participants were randomized to the MIND or a 
control diet for 3 years; both diets promoted weight loss through mild caloric 
restriction (250 kcal). Of 604 individuals enrolled in the trial, 518 were 
included in the analysis. We calculated the percentage of weight loss based on 
measured weight at the baseline and year 3 and categorized individuals into four 
groups: no weight loss (e.g., weight gain), <5%, 5-10%, and >10% weight loss. 
Cardiometabolic health included traditional lipid biomarkers, biomarkers of 
inflammation, and glycosylated hemoglobin. Linear mixed-effect models were used 
to evaluate the associations of weight loss with cardiometabolic health.
RESULTS: At the baseline, mean age was 70 (SD = 4.1) years, 332 (65%) were 
women, and BMI was 33.8 (SD = 5.9) kg/m2. Compared to people who did not lose 
weight, those with >10% weight loss significantly improved their biomarkers of 
cardiometabolic health at the year 3 visit as follows: LDL cholesterol levels 
decreased by 8.3%, triglycerides by 28.2%, and HDL increased by 12.4%. As for 
biomarkers of inflammation, GlycA decreased by 7.5%, hs-IL6 by 33.0%, hs-CRP by 
59.4%, and adiponectin increased by 53.7%. These improvements in biomarkers of 
cardiometabolic health did not differ by dietary intervention.
CONCLUSION: Weight loss through dietary interventions with mild calorie 
restriction resulted in favorable changes in cardiometabolic risk factors among 
older adults with overweight and obesity.

Alzheimer's disease is a specific neurodegenerative disorder, distinct from 
normal aging, with a growing unmet medical need. It is characterized by the 
accumulation of amyloid plaques in the brain, primarily consisting of amyloid 
beta (Aβ) fibrils. Therapeutic antibodies can slow down the disease, but are 
associated with potential severe side effects, motivating the development of 
small molecules to halt disease progression. This study investigates the 
interaction between the clinical drug candidate small molecule anle138b and 
lipidic Aβ₄₀ fibrils of type 1 (L1). L1 fibrils were previously shown to closely 
resemble fibrils from Alzheimer's patients. Using high-resolution structural 
biology techniques, including cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), nuclear 
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy enhanced by dynamic nuclear polarization 
(DNP), and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we find that anle138b 
selectively binds to a cavity within the fibril. This structural insight 
provides a deeper understanding of a potential drug-binding mechanism at the 
atomic level and may inform the development of therapies and diagnostic 
approaches. In addition, anle138b reduces fibril formation in the presence of 
lipids by approximately 75%. This may suggest a mechanistic connection to its 
previously reported activity in animal models of Alzheimer's disease.

BACKGROUND: Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTRv) is more typically 
associated with earlier onset and neurological symptoms compared with wild-type 
ATTR, although a very early, very symptomatic disease presentation is rare.
CASE SUMMARY: A 21-year-old male with gastrointestinal distress and neuropathy 
underwent cardiac evaluation after gastrointestinal biopsies identified ATTR. 
Family history was notable for amyloidosis and premature deaths. Examination 
showed neurological deficits without clinical heart failure, and echocardiogram 
showed concentric left ventricular remodeling. TTR gene sequencing identified a 
rare pathogenic variant, p.Phe84Ser. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated 
diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement of the brain and spine. Treatment with 
vutrisiran and tafamidis was initiated.
DISCUSSION: The p.Phe84Ser variant is strongly associated with central nervous 
system and gastrointestinal involvement. This patient had an early phenotypic 
presentation with leptomeningeal amyloidosis, which is exceedingly rare.
TAKE-HOME MESSAGE: Understanding the phenotype associated with this ATTRv 
genotype, along with the patient's family history, guided targeted and timely 
evaluation and treatment.

INTRODUCTION: Women over 70 years of age with operable oestrogen receptor 
positive (ER positive) breast cancer have worse survival outcomes than younger 
women. Primary surgery is the optimal treatment with primary endocrine therapy 
reserved for patients who are unfit or who have multiple co-morbidities. 
Inferior outcomes in this patient population might be explained by underuse of 
surgery, the rates of which vary considerably between geographical regions in 
the UK. We determined the rates of surgery versus primary endocrine therapy in a 
cohort of women aged over 70 in England, with potentially curable ER positive 
breast cancer, according to the presence of pre-existing cardiovascular disease 
(CVD), comorbidities, social deprivation, and by geographical location.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 33,235 women aged 70 years or older with stage I to III 
ER positive breast cancer from the 20 regional NHS Cancers Alliances in England 
were identified from the cancer registry. Linked hospital records were used to 
identify patient demographics, tumour and treatment characteristics, resection 
rates, CVD prevalence and other co-morbidities.
RESULTS: 25,800 (77.6 %) patients underwent surgery, 6787 (20.4 %) patients 
received primary endocrine therapy alone, 648 (2 %) patients received no 
treatment. Both CVD and surgery prevalence varied by geographical location. 
After adjustment for case mix the differences between Cancer Alliances 
attenuated and no longer reached statistical significance.
CONCLUSIONS: We found regional differences in rates of surgery in patients with 
breast cancer across different centres. After adjustments, the variation is 
largely attributable to case mix. Under recording of endocrine therapy data in 
secondary care limits full interpretation.

BACKGROUND: Adaptive clinical trials enable modifications to the study design 
based on accumulating evidence. The Bayesian predictive probability approach 
offers a framework for estimating the likelihood of achieving a successful 
outcome in a future analysis, based on current interim data.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the predictive probability of success for binary outcomes 
in patients with Alzheimer's disease or Ataxia treated with NeuroEPO plus.
METHODS: A retrospective Bayesian analysis was conducted using data from 
exploratory phase II trials as prior information for confirmatory phase III 
trials in Alzheimer's disease. Predictive probabilities were calculated at 
interim points with sample sizes of 50, 100, 150, and 176 patients.
RESULTS: The analysis demonstrated that the trial could have been stopped early 
due to a high probability of success or failures before reaching the full 
planned sample size.
CONCLUSIONS: Bayesian predictive probability is a valuable tool for 
decision-making in rare diseases, particularly when alternative treatments are 
limited or ineffective, or when baseline heterogeneity affects outcomes 
unevenly. This approach enhances interim evaluations by incorporating historical 
or non-informative priors, allowing for more accurate and efficient trial 
designs.

BackgroundWith the accelerating global aging population, the incidence of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) continues to rise, while current pharmacological 
treatments remain limited in efficacy. Music intervention, as a safe and 
feasible non-pharmacological approach, has gained increasing clinical attention, 
though its mechanisms of action remain unclear.ObjectiveThis study aims to 
evaluate the effects of music intervention on cognitive function and brain 
network connectivity in people with mild AD, and to elucidate its neural 
mechanisms and provide evidence for clinical practice.MethodsA total number of 
50 AD patients with mild dementia participated in the study. Participants were 
randomized to music-based intervention group (music-based intervention, 20 min, 
3 times/week for 6 months) or control group (standard care). Assessments 
included Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment 
(MoCA), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), Word 
Fluency Test (WFT), World Health Organization-University of California, the Los 
Angeles Auditory Verbal Learning Test (WHO-UCLA-AVLT), and functional magnetic 
resonance imaging (fMRI). Data were analyzed using SPSS 20.0.Results47 
participants completed the study. The music-based intervention group showed 
significant improvements in MoCA, GDS, NPI, WFT, and WHO-UCLA-AVLT scores 
(p < 0.05), with no change in MMSE. fMRI revealed enhanced frontal-temporal 
connectivity and increased angular gyrus activity.ConclusionsMusic-based 
intervention improves cognitive and neuropsychiatric outcomes in people with 
mild AD, likely through enhanced brain connectivity. This approach is feasible, 
and it supports the optimization of music-based intervention in clinical 
practice.

Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are molecular chaperones that play important roles in 
protein homeostasis, with HSP70 linked to a role in neuroprotection. HSP70 is 
upregulated in response to various stressors, such as heat therapy (HT), which 
has been shown to increase brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) content. 
BDNF reduces the activity of β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 
(BACE1), the rate-limiting enzyme responsible for the generation of amyloid-β 
(Aβ) peptides that form the characteristic Aβ plaques observed in Alzheimer's 
disease brains. The current pilot study examined whether 4 weeks of HT can 
increase HSP70 and BDNF content (pro and mature forms) in the brain, as well as 
alter markers of amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing. Male mice had their 
core temperature maintained between 37.0-38.0° in Control (CON, n = 16) and 
40.5-41.5° in Heat Therapy (HT, n = 16) for 20-minutes every 72 hours over 
4-weeks. 72 hours after the last treatment, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and 
hippocampus (HIP) were collected. HT significantly increased HSP70 levels in 
both the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex compared to controls (p = 0.0007, PFC 
CON=1.001 [0.314], PFC HT=1.546 [0.948], HIP CON=1.000 [0.356], HIP HT=2.207 
[0.756]). In the HIP, proBDNF levels were also higher in the HT group relative 
to both the control group and the PFC (p < 0.05, PFC CON=1.000 [0.156], PFC HT = 
0.984 [0.607], HIP CON=1.001 [0.242], HIP HT=1.575 [0.482]. There were no 
differences in mature BDNF in either PFC or HIP regions (p>0.05, PFC CON=1.000 
[0.273], PFC HT=1.174 [0.266], HIP CON=0.999 [0.130], HIP HT=0.971 [0.207]), The 
findings from our pilot study suggest that HT enhances the expression of HSP70 
and BDNF, indicating the potential to modulate key neuroprotective proteins. 
Future studies in dedicated preclinical mouse models of Alzheimer's disease 
using heat therapy regimen are warranted.

BackgroundEvidence regarding efficacy of combined pharmaco- and 
non-pharmacotherapies and their comparative effectiveness for Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) is limited.ObjectiveTo estimate the comparative efficacy of 
pharmacotherapies, non-pharmacotherapies, and combined therapies for improving 
cognitive, behavioral, and functional outcomes in patients with 
AD.MethodsRelevant studies were identified from Medline via PubMed and Scopus 
databases (March 2021-December 2022). Randomized-controlled trials were eligible 
if they assessed the efficacy of pharmacotherapies, non-pharmacotherapies, or 
combined therapies in patients aged 60 years or older, and measuring cognitive, 
behavioral, or functional outcomes. A network meta-analysis was conducted to 
estimate relative treatment effects, and interventions were ranked using surface 
under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) curve. Confidence in the findings was 
evaluated using the Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis (CINeMA) 
framework.ResultsA total of 153 randomized-controlled trials were analyzed. 
Compared to placebo/usual care, donepezil plus cognitive therapy and 
rivastigmine plus cognitive rehabilitation significantly improved Mini-Mental 
State Examination scores. Behavioral outcomes were improved by rivastigmine plus 
cognitive stimulation, brain stimulation plus exercise, and occupational 
therapy. Functional status improved significantly with rivastigmine plus 
cognitive stimulation and exercise. Based on SUCRA ranking, rivastigmine plus 
cognitive rehabilitation ranked highest for cognitive improvement (92.8%), brain 
stimulation plus exercise ranked highest for the behavioral outcome (93.1%), and 
rivastigmine plus cognitive stimulation ranked highest for functional 
improvement (94.1%).ConclusionsDonepezil plus cognitive therapy and rivastigmine 
plus cognitive rehabilitation were the most effective treatments for improving 
cognitive outcomes. Rivastigmine plus cognitive stimulation ranked highest for 
both behavioral and functional outcomes, while exercise remains an important 
strategy for supporting daily functioning in patients with AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by 
progressive cognitive decline. Emerging evidence strongly suggests that protein 
glycosylation is strongly related to this disease. However, the extent and 
functional consequences of site-specific N-glycosylation alterations in AD 
remain to be further explored. Here, we employed a dendrimer boronic acid 
(DBA)-based enrichment strategy combined with multiplexed proteomics to 
systematically analyze protein N-glycosylation in post-mortem human brain 
tissues. We identified 3,105 N-glycosylation sites on 1,299 glycoproteins from 
nine AD cases and nine healthy controls, and performed a systematic and 
site-specific investigation of glycosylation alterations in AD. Glycoproteins 
involved in cholesterol efflux were upregulated, whereas those associated with 
chemical synaptic transmission and ion transport were significantly 
downregulated in AD compared to control brain samples. We observed widespread 
dysregulation of N-glycosylation across multiple protein domains, particularly 
in the ConA-like lectins/glucanases and Zn-dependent exopeptidases domains. 
Notably, we identified 161 N-glycosylation sites located within 
aggregation-prone regions (APRs), and reduced glycosylation at APRs on 
plaque-associated glycoproteins may be associated with protein aggregation and 
plaque formation. Additionally, downregulated N-glycosylation sites were 
enriched in synaptic membrane proteins, such as Ca2+ ion channels, GABA-gated 
chloride channels, and glutamate receptors, implicating glycosylation loss in 
synaptic dysfunction. Our findings suggest that the loss of N-glycosylation may 
contribute to the pathogenesis of AD through impairing synaptic transmission and 
promoting protein aggregation. This study provides novel insights into 
glycosylation-dependent mechanisms of neurodegeneration, highlighting 
N-glycosylation as a potential therapeutic target for AD treatment.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
pathologically characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) and 
neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau in the brain. 
Amyloid-targeting therapies (ATTs) are the first available disease-modifying 
treatments shown to slow cognitive and functional decline for patients with mild 
cognitive impairment owing to AD and early symptomatic AD. Currently two ATTs 
are commercially available, donanemab (Kisunla™) and lecanemab (Leqembi®). The 
main potential side effect and safety concern of ATT treatment is 
amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA). ARIA can be categorized into two 
types that can co-occur: ARIA-E (edema/sulcal effusion) and ARIA-H 
(hemorrhage/superficial siderosis). Although both are often asymptomatic and 
ARIA-E typically resolves radiographically over time, both forms can be 
radiologically and/or clinically serious. Treating clinicians should be equipped 
with a comprehensive understanding of ARIA. This review aims to provide advanced 
practice providers, who are pivotal to patient care in AD, with critical 
insights into ARIA to safely identify risk factors, understand treatment 
guidelines, and gain familiarity with appropriate management strategies. It 
emphasizes the importance of understanding APOE genotype and vascular factors in 
ARIA risk and recognizing the clinical and radiographic manifestations of ARIA. 
Practical recommendations are provided for monitoring and managing ARIA, 
including dose management strategies and education on symptom awareness. By 
fostering a comprehensive understanding of ARIA and its monitoring and 
management, this review aims to support the safe and effective implementation of 
ATTs, contributing to optimized patient care for those treated with ATTs.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), one of the most challenging neurodegenerative 
disorders, with high prevalence worldwide, is characterized by progressive 
cognitive decline and accumulation of amyloid-β plaques and neurofibrillary tau 
tangles. Despite significant research, the limited efficacy of current 
treatments underscores the critical need to identify novel pathogenic mechanisms 
and therapeutic targets. Necroptosis, a regulated and highly inflammatory form 
of programmed cell death, has emerged as one of the key contributors to AD 
pathogenesis. This systematic review comprises 25 high-quality in vivo, in 
vitro, and autopsy studies, published between 2015 and 2025, extracted from 
PubMed, Scopus, and Science Direct databases. The keywords include 
"necroptosis", "RIPK1", "RIPK3", "MLKL", "pMLKL", "necroptosis inhibitors", 
"Alzheimer's disease", and "neurodegeneration". The review summarizes the 
multiple molecular mechanisms, including TNF-α/TNFR1 signaling, TRIF-mediated 
RIPK3 activation, and RHIM-dependent MLKL phosphorylation, associated with 
necroptosis in the pathogenesis of AD. All the studies converge on necroptosis 
as a central pathogenic pathway linking key molecular and cellular abnormalities 
observed in AD. The accumulated evidence strongly supports prioritizing the 
development of brain-penetrant necroptosis inhibitors and clinical validation of 
associated biomarkers. These insights signal a significant shift in AD 
therapeutics, moving from symptomatic treatment to mechanistically targeted 
interventions that can alter disease progression.

INTRODUCTION: The literature suggests that the use of creative methods (e.g., 
art, theatre, and music) in the care of older people can promote interactions 
and positive experiences. However, there are no studies that have explored the 
perspectives of nursing programmes internationally regarding their inclusion in 
the curriculum. Therefore, to expand knowledge from a multinational perspective, 
this study explored (a) the views and perceptions and (b) the potential barriers 
to the inclusion of creative approaches in nursing education in the development 
of competences for the care of people with dementia.
METHODS: A qualitative descriptive study according to the Consolidated criteria 
for Reporting Qualitative research checklist. Semi-structured face-to-face and 
focus group interviews with a purposive sample of 79 participants in four 
countries (Finland, Greece, Italy, and the Netherlands). Participants were 
nursing students (n = 32), educators/professors (n = 17), healthcare 
professionals (n = 13), family members (n = 8), policy makers (n = 6), and 
people with dementia (n = 3). The interviews were transcribed verbatim and 
analyzed using thematic analysis.
RESULTS: Views, perceptions, and barriers/advantages related to creative 
approaches were summarised into four themes: (a) Being already familiar with 
creative approaches; (b) Perceiving their potentialities; (c) Bolstering the 
personalised approach in nursing education; and (d) Ensuring preparedness and 
support.
CONCLUSIONS: The inclusion of creative approaches in nursing education appears 
to be both mature and desired by stakeholders at the international level, given 
their diverse potentialities. These approaches are also seen as an excellent way 
to improve the teaching of personalised care. However, resources as well as a 
particular attitude and the ability of professors to act as role models are 
required.

different mechanisms in males and perimenopausal females.

Apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) genotype, hypertension, and biological sex are 
critical risk factors for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Yet, their 
combined impact on early cerebrovascular dysfunction, brain inflammation, and 
memory impairment remains poorly understood. We developed a translational mouse 
model incorporating human ApoE4, hypertension via angiotensin II infusion, and 
induced accelerated ovarian failure (AOF) to mimic perimenopause in females to 
investigate these interactions. Hypertensive ApoE4 mice of both sexes exhibited 
impaired spatial working memory, decreased cerebral blood flow, increased 
neuroinflammation, and decreased blood brain barrier integrity, recapitulating 
key early clinical features observed in human populations with these risk 
factors. Brain blood flow reduction was associated with an increased incidence 
of capillary stalling, with notable sex differences in the extent and cellular 
composition of stalls: in males, stalling was strongly elevated and mostly due 
to red blood cell arrest, while stalling was modestly elevated in peri-AOF 
females with most stalls including leukocytes. Treatment with prasugrel, a P2Y12 
receptor inhibitor, improved memory performance in both sexes but was correlated 
with different physiological effects - restored cerebral blood flow in males and 
reduced microglia motility and inflammation in peri-AOF females. Platelet 
depletion mimicked prasugrel's blood flow and cognitive benefits in males, while 
microglia depletion selectively rescued memory in females. Our work emphasizes 
the necessity of including translationally relevant female mouse models in 
neurodegenerative disease studies, and our findings highlight the importance of 
risk profile-specific interventions and demonstrate that early vascular 
dysfunction may be a key, sex-dependent driver of cognitive decline.

Background and Aim: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative 
disorder characterized by disrupted neural network dynamics and neuronal loss. 
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) may restore network function and abate cognitive 
deficits. In a transgenic rat model of AD, we investigated the dependence of 
hippocampal neuronal activity on a range of DBS parameters, aiming to identify 
stimulation conditions that transiently restore impaired network function. 
Material and Methods: We used 16-month-old TgF344-AD and NTg rats under light 
anesthesia and performed simultaneous DBS and high-resolution intracerebral 
recordings in the hippocampus using a linear multielectrode array. DBS was 
delivered in bipolar mode, at varying frequencies, amplitudes and duration, 
while monitoring local field potentials (LFP) and spiking activity. 
Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC), neuronal power, and firing rates were analyzed 
prior to and following DBS. Linear mixed effects models were used to evaluate 
the influence of genotype, sex, and stimulation parameters on the 
electrophysiological markers. Results: With increasing DBS frequency and 
amplitude, hippocampal power and PAC rose in all rats, particularly within the 
delta-theta range. When compared to NTgs, TgAD rats showed attenuated power but 
increased PAC responses to DBS. Low frequency DBS induced higher entrainment in 
the post- relative to during-DBS period in all animals. Compared to their 
non-transgenic littermates, TgAD rats showed reduced entrainment responses. 
Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that hippocampal responses to DBS have a 
parameter-dependent profile that is differentially modulated by AD pathology. 
Our study provides a foundation for tailoring DBS parameters to compensate for 
distinct neuronal deficits in established AD, supporting the use of 
electrophysiological biomarkers to guide individualized neuromodulation 
strategies.

The molecular pathways influencing the build-up of β-amyloid and tau pathology 
in Alzheimer's disease are unclear. To investigate how the involvement of 
different cell types influences β-amyloid and tau, we utilized single-cell 
RNA-seq data to derive cell-weighted polygenic risk scores. We included 
participants from the BioFINDER-1 study, including cognitively unimpaired (N = 
734) individuals and patients with mild cognitive impairment (N = 235), 
Alzheimer's diseasedementia (N = 97) or non-Alzheimer's disease 
neurodegenerative diseases (N = 227). We developed seven polygenic risk scores, 
including six cell-weighted (for astrocytes, excitatory neurons, inhibitory 
neurons, microglia, oligodendrocyte precursor cells and oligodendrocytes) and 
one full polygenic risk score without cell specificity. For each of the 
polygenic risk score models, we calculated seven scores (polygenic risk score 
1-7) based on different P-value thresholds (ranging from P-value < 0.05 to 
P-value < 5e-08) of variants from an independent large Alzheimer's disease 
genome-wide association study. We tested associations between the polygenic risk 
scores with β-amyloid [using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
β-amyloid1-42/β-amyloid1-40], tau (using CSF pTau217) and cognitive measures 
(Mini-Mental State Examination score and Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive 
Composite) using regression models adjusting for age, sex and the top genotype 
principal components. We also replicated the polygenic risk score association 
with β-amyloid (CSF β-amyloid1-42/β-amyloid1-40) and tau (CSF pTau217) in an 
independent cohort (BioFINDER-2), including cognitively unimpaired (N = 773) 
individuals and patients with mild cognitive impairment (N = 358), Alzheimer's 
disease dementia (N = 286) or non-Alzheimer's disease neurodegenerative diseases 
(N = 319). We observed differential cellular effects on β-amyloid, pTau217 and 
cognitive measures. There are substantial effects of neuronal-specific polygenic 
risk scores on β-amyloid, pTau217 and cognitive measures. The 
microglial-polygenic risk scores showed more significant effects on pTau217 than 
on β-amyloid. β-Amyloid positivity partly mediated the associations between 
polygenic risk scores and pTau217, with the lowest mediation effect observed for 
the microglial-polygenic risk scores (on average 33%). Cell-weighted gene 
expression has differential effects on pathological β-amyloid and tau 
metabolism, as well as cognitive decline. Cell-weighted gene expression related 
to microglia is preferentially relevant for the metabolism of soluble 
phosphorylated tau through partly β-amyloid-independent mechanisms. 
Cell-weighted gene expression related to neurons shows the strongest 
associations with cognition. These findings inform further studies that address 
specific cell types for various aspects of Alzheimer's disease, including the 
development of novel treatment strategies.

The molecular correlates of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are increasingly being 
defined by omics. Yet, the findings from different data types or cohorts are 
often difficult to reconcile. Collecting multiple omics from the same 
individuals allows a comprehensive view of disease-related molecular mechanisms, 
while addressing conflicting findings derived from single omics. Such 
same-sample multi-omics can reveal, for instance, when changes observed in the 
transcriptome share distinct but coordinated signals in epigenetics and 
proteomics, relationships otherwise unclear. Here, we apply a data-driven 
multi-omic framework to integrate epigenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, 
metabolomic, and cell-type-specific population data from up to 1,358 aged human 
brain samples from the Religious Orders Study (ROS) and Rush Memory and Aging 
Project (MAP). We demonstrate the existence of sprawling cross-omics 
cross-system biological factors that also relate to AD phenotypes. The strongest 
AD-associated factor (factor 8) involved elevated immune activity at the 
epigenetic level, decreased expression of heat shock genes in the transcriptome, 
and disrupted energy metabolism and cytoskeletal dynamics in the proteome. We 
also showed immune-related factors (factors 2 and 3) with discordant 
enrichments, reflecting reactive-like glial subpopulations and protective 
contributions from surveillance microglia. Both were negatively associated with 
AD pathology, suggesting potential immune resilience mechanisms. Finally, 
unsupervised clustering of participants revealed eleven molecular subtypes of 
the aging brain, including three clusters strongly associated with AD but 
displaying distinct molecular signatures and phenotypic characteristics. Our 
findings provide a comprehensive map of molecular mechanisms underlying AD 
heterogeneity, highlighting the complex role of neuroinflammatory processes, and 
yielding potential novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for precision 
medicine approaches to AD treatment.

BACKGROUND: As global populations age, the burden of dementia increases, raising 
challenges for healthcare systems. Care quality is key to supporting individuals 
with dementia, but few studies have assessed this at a global level. We aimed to 
assess the burden and care quality of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias 
(ADRDs) and cross-country inequalities between 1990 and 2021.
METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of the Global Burden of Diseases 
Study (GBD) 2021, focussing on disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and care 
quality (measured by a variational autoencoder-based Quality of Care Index 
(QCI-v), range = 1-100) of ADRDs. We assessed trends using average annual 
percentage changes (AAPCs) and measured cross-country inequalities using the 
slope index of inequality and concentration index.
RESULTS: The global age-standardised DALY rates of ADRDs per 100 000 population 
slightly increased from 1331.59 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 881.57, 1781.61) 
in 1990 to 1347.24 (95% CI = 906.36, 1788.12) in 2021, with an AAPC of 0.04% 
(95% CI = 0.02, 0.05). The global age-standardised QCI-v of ADRDs increased from 
51.56 (95% CI = 45.87, 57.26) to 54.27 (95% CI = 48.68, 59.86), with an AAPC of 
0.16% (95% CI = 0.12, 0.21). Regions with a low-middle or low sociodemographic 
index (SDI), as well as the African Region and the South-East Asia Region, 
experienced an increasing burden, but a decreasing care quality. In 2021, 
high-middle SDI regions and the Western Pacific Region had the highest burden, 
while care quality was notably low in low SDI region. The European Region showed 
the greatest inequality in terms of burden, while the Eastern Mediterranean 
showed marked disparities in care quality.
CONCLUSIONS: The disease burden and care quality of ADRDs both increased from 
1990 to 2021, accompanied by significant disparities between countries. Regions 
with low-middle or low SDI, particularly the African and South-East Asia 
Regions, faced rising burdens and declining care quality.

BACKGROUND: ADappt is a digital toolkit for both memory clinic professionals and 
patients to support communication on diagnosis and prognosis in memory clinics. 
We aimed to evaluate ADappt's usability and feasibility in clinical practice.
METHODS: In this mixed-methods study, we first assessed usability via 
think-aloud sessions with ten memory clinic professionals from eight memory 
clinics, six patients, and one care partner. Think-aloud comments were 
deductively categorized into: content, navigation, and design. Second, we 
conducted a feasibility study in four memory clinics. Eight memory clinic 
professionals recruited 21 patients and 21 care partners. Professionals were 
instructed to integrate the ADappt-toolkit in their routine. Before their visit, 
patients received information about the ADappt-patient tools: two 
video-animations and a question prompt list (QPL). Participants completed 
questionnaires on usability, satisfaction, and feasibility either after the 
first consultation (n = 14 patients; n = 15 care partners), after the disclosure 
consultation (n = 4 patients; n = 5 care partners), or after both consultations 
(n = 3 patients; n = 1 care partner). Interviews with professionals were 
conducted and analyzed using thematic content analysis. Third, together with 
Alzheimer Europe, we co-organized a patient and public involvement (PPI) session 
with citizens, patients, and care partners to further improve the patient tools.
RESULTS: Professionals found ADappt relevant, easy-to-navigate, and visually 
appealing. Most think-aloud comments focused on content and navigation, 
especially regarding the risk calculation tool. Patients indicated the patient 
tools to be helpful in preparing for consultations. After use in practice, 
professionals reported acceptable usability (68 ± 14, scale 0-100) and 
satisfaction (71 ± 10, scale 0-100) with ADappt. Professionals most often used 
the tool that provides an overview of diagnostic tests with pros and cons (in 
15/24(63%) consultations), which they also deemed most helpful (median(IQR): 
4(3.75-4), scale 1-5). About half to two-thirds of patients and care partners 
reported to have received the patient tools (video-animations: n = 23/46(50%)); 
QPL: n = 30/46(65%)), of whom a majority used (video-animations: 
n = 16/23(70%)); QPL: n = 21/30(70%)) and would recommend them 
(video-animations: n = 15/16(94%); QPL: n = 20/21(95%)). The tools helped to 
express themselves more effectively. The PPI session highlighted the importance 
of widespread dissemination of the patient tools and through multiple channels.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates the potential of digital tools to improve 
medical communication in memory clinics. Taking feedback into account, ADappt is 
further improved and steps towards implementation are being taken.

Hypertension increases risks for cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease 
(AD). In renal patients with both hypertension and cognitive decline, via 
rest-state fMRI, their cerebral cortical region showed maintained cerebral blood 
flow (CBF), but reduced signals of blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD). In mice, 
although CBF was unchanged, deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt treatment 
markedly reduced cerebrovascular reactivity, with altered transcriptomic pattern 
in cortical endothelial cells (ECs) and astrocytes, showing downregulated 
expression of glucose transport 1 (GluT1) but upregulated metabolic 
reprogramming. Lipidomic analysis using prefrontal cortex (PFC) further revealed 
enhanced catabolism of glycerophospholipids and accumulation of free fatty 
acids. In the PFC of hypertensive mice, neurodegenerative alterations were 
observed, including reduced number of neuronal dendritic spines and more 
expression of phosphorylated Tau (p-Tau). Via both morphological and molecular 
tests, we identified that DOCA-salt hypertension was associated with significant 
mitochondrial injury and upregulated lysine succinylation in the PFC neurons. 
Upregulated lysine succinylation was largely mitochondria-located, and they were 
functionally enriched in gluconeogenesis-related energy metabolic pathways, the 
tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, oxidative stress, and neurodegenerative 
diseases. In hypertensive mice, angiotensinogen (Agt) expression was markedly 
upregulated in most astrocytes, together with neuronal expression of Agtr1a. In 
cultured neuronal cells, angiotensin II (ang II) elevated mitochondrial membrane 
potential and ATP biosynthesis. In mice with neuronal AT1aR knockout (AT1N), 
DOCA-salt failed to induce cognitive impairment. Additionally, 
DOCA-salt-associated reduction of acetylcholine, accumulation of p-Tau, and 
upregulation of lysine succinylation were not observed in AT1N mice. Direct 
anti-hypertensive treatment did not abolish DOCA-salt-related pathological 
phenotypes, and enhanced lysine succinylation was not detected in hypertension 
models induced by norepinephrine or L-NAME. Our data provide evidence that 
hypertension induced metabolic rearrangement (enhanced energy metabolism from 
non-glucose source and upregulated mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation) in 
the neuro-vascular unit, due to downregulated glucose uptake in ECs. Increased 
neuronal energy consumption, via local ang II/AT1R signaling, further 
exacerbated mitochondrial stress and neurodegenerative alterations. Together, by 
multi-omics analysis, this study provided novel insights regarding how 
hypertension increases the risk for age-related cognitive impairment.

BACKGROUND: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) is a 
nuclear receptor known to play a critical role in regulating neuroinflammation 
and neurodegenerative processes, including Alzheimer's disease. Prior studies 
from our group demonstrated that rice bran extract (RBE) enhances cognitive 
function and increases PPARγ DNA-binding activity in the brain, effects that 
were abolished by PPARγ antagonism. These findings suggest that bioactive 
constituents within RBE may modulate PPARγ signaling. The current study aimed to 
provide additional evidence for the involvement of PPARγ activation in the 
neuroprotective effects of RBE and to identify key RBE-derived components that 
may contribute to these effects.
METHODS: A neuroinflammatory mouse model was treated orally for 21 consecutive 
days with RBE. The brain CD36 and amyloid-beta (Aβ) protein levels were 
measured. HPLC and GC were used to assess the levels of RBE components. To 
measure alterations in fatty acid content after treatment with RBE, brain levels 
of DHA, EPA and AA were assessed using UHPLC/MS-MS.
RESULTS: RBE treatment increased the brain levels of CD36, the direct PPARγ 
target, and decreased Aβ levels. A strong correlation was detected between the 
Aβ and CD36 protein levels. As RBE was found to be rich in linolenic acid (ALA), 
linoleic acid (LA) and oleic acid, their metabolites concentrations in mice 
brain were measured, and results indicated higher concentration of EPA and DHA 
after RBE treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: RBE exerts neuroprotective effects potentially through activation 
of the PPARγ pathway, as evidenced by CD36 upregulation and Aβ reduction. The 
enrichment of RBE in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), along with the 
observed increase in their brain-penetrant metabolites (EPA and DHA), suggests 
these lipids may contribute to the cognitive benefits of RBE.

OBJECTIVE: Chronic musculoskeletal pain negatively impacts gait performance, but 
the impact of neck pain on gait remains unclear. This study aimed to assess 
measures of gait (speed and variability) in individuals with chronic neck pain 
(CNP) compared to non-CNP controls across various walking conditions.
METHODS: Sixty participants with CNP and 41 controls were recruited. Pain, 
disability, general health, and gait were measured. Gait outcomes included gait 
speed, stride time variability (STV), and a multi-component gait variability 
index (GVI) across four different walking conditions: quiet walk, cognitive task 
(i.e., serial sevens test), horizontal head turning, and vertical head turning. 
Linear regression models were used to obtain adjusted group means, difference of 
means, and 95 % confidence intervals for gait outcomes. Exploratory analyses 
assessed the relationship between CNP intensity and gait across conditions. All 
models adjusted for age and sex.
RESULTS: The CNP group (median age: 36.5 y, 75 % female) reported more pain, 
disability, pain medication use, and multisite pain (p < 0.001) than controls 
(median age: 32 y, 61 % female). CNP participants exhibited slower gait speed 
(mean difference -7.0 cm/s; 95 % CI: -15.0-0.10), greater STV (mean difference 
0.43 %CV; 95 % CI: 0.05-0.89), and higher GVI (mean difference 4.16; 95 % CI: 
0.03-8.46). While the negative effects of pain were present across walking 
conditions, the magnitude varied depending on the task and outcome measure.
CONCLUSION: CNP was associated with reduced gait speed and increased variability 
of walking patterns. Slight variations under different dual-task conditions 
suggest potential relationships between pain, mobility, and cognitive-motor 
coordination.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) are common 
complications of antiamyloid immunotherapy for Alzheimer disease (AD). 
Identifying imaging biomarkers that predict ARIA risk may help guide treatment 
decisions. This study investigates the relationship between deep white matter 
hyperintensities (DWMH), perivascular spaces (PVS), and ARIA incidence in 
patients with AD treated with lecanemab.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 27 ARIA-positive 
patients identified between November 2023 and November 2024, and 27 age- and 
sex-matched ARIA-negative controls. Baseline MRI was assessed for DWMH burden 
(Fazekas score) and PVS grades in the basal ganglia and centrum semiovale. 
Simple logistic regression was performed to evaluate associations between 
imaging markers and ARIA risk.
RESULTS: ARIA-positive patients had significantly higher Fazekas scores compared 
with ARIA-negative patients (1.37 versus 1.0; P = .0262), indicating a greater 
DWMH burden. PVS grades in the basal ganglia were numerically higher in 
ARIA-positive patients (1.81 versus 1.56, P = .0733) but did not reach 
statistical significance. Simple logistic regression identified the Fazekas 
score as a significant predictor of ARIA (OR: 2.812; 95% CI, 1.076-8.438; P = 
.0343). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the model 
was 0.640 (95% CI, 0.492-0.788; P = .078).
CONCLUSIONS: Higher DWMH burden, as quantified by the Fazekas score, is 
significantly associated with ARIA risk in patients with AD treated with 
lecanemab. These findings suggest that DWMH may serve as a potential imaging 
biomarker for ARIA risk stratification. Larger studies incorporating additional 
vascular biomarkers, including cerebral amyloid angiopathy markers, are 
warranted to refine risk prediction models.

Chitosan (CS) has appeared as a promising candidate in brain disease (BD) (such 
as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Multiple sclerosis (MS)) therapy due to its 
anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and neuroprotective properties. CS's capacity 
to interact with the blood-brain barrier (BBB) enhances the central nervous 
system (CNS) drug permeability, offering new avenues for effective treatment 
strategies aimed at overcoming the limitations of conventional therapies. 
Furthermore, CS's role in regenerative medicine extends beyond drug delivery, as 
it fosters neural repair by providing a supportive microenvironment for 
oligodendrocyte proliferation and neuronal regeneration. Studies have shown that 
CS-based scaffolds, when combined with neurotrophic factors and stem cells, can 
enhance remyelination and neuroprotection in BD models. The immunomodulatory 
effects of CS further contribute to reducing neuroinflammation by shifting 
immune responses toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype, thereby mitigating the 
progression of BD-associated damage. This review provides a comprehensive 
analysis of the latest advancements in CS-based BD therapies, exploring its 
multifunctional applications in drug delivery, immune modulation, and tissue 
engineering. The discussion also addresses the current challenges in clinical 
translation, including variability in CS formulations, regulatory 
considerations, and potential safety concerns. Future research directions should 
focus on optimizing CS derivatives, improving its bioavailability, and 
integrating it with emerging therapeutic approaches such as gene therapy and 
biomimetic nanocarriers.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a significant neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by a progressive decline in cognitive functions. The pathogenesis 
of AD remains largely elusive, resulting in Western medications that often 
exhibit limited efficacy and frequent side effects. In contrast, traditional 
Chinese medicine (TCM) has been utilized for managing AD, recognized for its 
favorable safety profile and multi-target therapeutic potential. 
Polysaccharides, which are essential bioactive components found in TCM extracts, 
have attracted considerable interest due to their safety and ability to target 
multiple biological pathways. This article examines the pharmacological effects 
and mechanisms of TCM polysaccharides in the treatment of AD, focusing on 
research conducted over the past decade. Additionally, it explores the 
structure-activity relationships of these polysaccharides, providing a 
foundation for further investigation into polysaccharide-based interventions for 
AD and suggesting potential avenues for future studies aimed at structural 
enhancements.

Neurodegenerative diseases (ND) are a diverse group of disorders characterized 
by the progressive loss of neurons, leading to severe cognitive and physical 
impairments. Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and Huntington's diseases are among the 
most prominent examples, with their prevalence steadily increasing due to the 
aging global population. In 2009, approximately 50 million people worldwide were 
affected by ND, and current projections suggest this number will exceed 115 
million by 2050. The development of ND is complex and multifactorial, influenced 
by genetic predispositions, environmental factors, aging, and cellular 
dysfunction. A significant challenge in addressing these diseases lies in the 
absence of curative treatments; existing therapies are limited to symptom 
management and enhancing quality of life. We report the synthesis and biological 
evaluation of a series of 2,6,9-trisubstituted purine derivatives, some of which 
exhibited strong neuroprotective effects in cellular models of mitochondrial 
(3-nitropropionic acid-induced) and oxidative (glutamate-induced) stress. Also, 
several compounds functioned as selective butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) 
inhibitors and three of which showed CB2 receptor agonist activity, supporting 
their potential as multifunctional agents for neurodegenerative disorders. In 
vitro assays confirmed their protective effects across multiple cellular 
pathways, including reduction of apoptosis, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial 
permeability transition. Notably, compound 3e emerged as the most effective 
derivative, combining strong BChE inhibition, CB2 receptor activation, and 
cytoprotective effects. These findings identify 2,6,9-trisubstituted purines as 
promising scaffolds for the development of multi-target-directed ligands in 
neurodegenerative disease therapy.

AI is transforming neurology, providing powerful diagnostic and therapeutic 
tools, yet handling sensitive clinical data involves substantial privacy risks. 
Federated Learning addresses these issues by training models locally within 
hospitals and sharing only their weights or gradients for final training, 
achieving similar or superior performance compared to centralized models in 
Stroke, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia among older 
adults worldwide. Amidst several hypotheses to explain the pathobiology of the 
disease are biochemical indicators such as β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques; 
neurofibrillary tangles, caused by hyperphosphorylated tau protein; oxidative 
stress; metal dyshomeostasis; low levels of acetylcholine, and 
neuroinflammation. Considering the multifactorial nature of AD, there has been 
an increase in research for novel multitarget compounds, mainly utilizing 
molecular hybridization for drug design. In this review, we focus on the 
8-hydroxyquinoline moiety, a privileged metal-binding agent with Aβ 
antiaggregating properties, and its derivatives, aiming to have an effect on 
multiple molecular targets. Furthermore, the most prominent structure-activity 
relationships found on the analyzed compounds, along with the most promising 
strategies explored by researchers, are discussed. That way, we hope to provide 
a comprehensive perspective on the development of anti- Alzheimer agents based 
on the 8-hydroxyquinoline moiety in the last decade.

Cholesterol transport within the brain represents a highly regulated process 
essential for maintaining neuronal function and central nervous system (CNS) 
homeostasis. Unlike peripheral tissues, the brain relies on in situ cholesterol 
synthesis, primarily by astrocytes and other glial cells, which supply neurons 
via high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-like particles, identified in the human 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The major component of HDL-like lipoproteins is the 
apolipoprotein E (ApoE), whose E4 isoform represents the strongest genetic risk 
factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). Growing evidence suggests that 
impaired cholesterol transport contributes to the pathogenesis of various 
neurodegenerative disorders, particularly AD, a major public health concern due 
to increasing prevalence and the lack of effective treatments. Indeed, the 
unconvincing outcomes of the amyloid-targeting monoclonal antibodies underscore 
the urgency of identifying alternative therapeutic strategies. This review 
provides a comprehensive analysis of cholesterol transport mechanisms within the 
brain and their dysregulation in AD by examining the astrocyte-to-neuron 
cholesterol supply pathways, including endogenous biosynthesis, cholesterol 
efflux from astrocytes, neuronal uptake, and intracellular processing. Key 
molecular players involved in each step are discussed, focusing on their roles 
in AD pathophysiology and potential as therapeutic targets. Furthermore, the 
review critically evaluates recent preclinical studies exploring pharmacological 
interventions able to modulate cerebral cholesterol homeostasis. These emerging 
approaches offer promising alternatives to amyloid-based treatments and may open 
new perspectives for preventing or mitigating neurodegeneration in AD. By 
providing an integrated overview of cholesterol transport in the brain, this 
review highlights novel directions for research and drug development targeting 
CNS cholesterol metabolism.
