INTRODUCTION: Lewy body dementia (LBD) shares genetic risk factors with 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), including apolipoprotein E (APOE), but is 
distinguishable at the genome-wide level. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) may 
therefore improve diagnostic classification.
METHODS: We assessed diagnostic classification using AD-PRS excluding APOE 
(AD-PRSno APOE), APOE risk score (APOE-RS), and plasma phosphorylated tau 181 
(p-tau181), in 83 participants with LBD, 27 with positron emission tomography 
amyloid beta (Aβ)positive mild cognitive impairment or AD (MCI+/AD), and 57 
controls.
RESULTS: Together AD-PRSno APOE and APOE-RS performed similarly to p-tau181 in 
discriminating MCI+/AD from controls (area under the curve 76% vs. 79%) and LBD 
(71% vs. 72%). In LBD, Aβ positivity was significantly associated with APOE-RS, 
but not with AD-PRSno APOE, or p-tau181. Combining AD-PRSno APOE, APOE-RS, and 
p-tau181 improved the discrimination of MCI+/AD from controls (81%) and LBD 
(75%), and the detection of Aβ in LBD (82%).
DISCUSSION: Aβ deposition in LBD was associated with APOE, while MCI+/AD was 
also associated with AD-PRS beyond APOE. AD-PRS explains phenotypic variance not 
captured by APOE or p-tau181.
HIGHLIGHTS: We investigated Alzheimer's disease (AD) polygenic risk score (PRS), 
apolipoprotein E (APOE), and plasma phosphorylated tau 181 (p-tau181) to 
classify AD and Lewy body dementia (LBD). AD-PRS with APOE achieved similar 
classification accuracy to p-tau181. AD-PRS without APOE significantly 
contributed to discriminating AD from LBD. Amyloid beta positivity in LBD was 
associated with APOE but not AD-PRS without APOE or p-tau181. Combining AD-PRS, 
APOE, and p-tau181 improved diagnostic classification accuracy.

The coexistence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and chronic pain (CP) in the elderly 
population has been extensively documented, and a growing body of evidence 
supports the potential interconnections between these two conditions. This 
comprehensive review explores the mechanisms by which CP may contribute to the 
development and progression of AD, with a particular focus on neuroinflammatory 
pathways and the role of microglia, as well as the activation of the NLR family 
pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. The review proposes that 
prolonged pain processing in critical brain regions can dysregulate the activity 
of the NLRP3 inflammasome within microglia, leading to the overproduction of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines and excessive oxidative stress in these regions. This 
aberrant microglial response also results in localized neuroinflammation in 
brain areas crucial for cognitive function. Additionally, CP as a persistent 
physiological and psychological stressor may be associated with 
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction, systemic inflammation, 
disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and neuroinflammation. These 
pathophysiological changes can cause morphological and functional impairments in 
brain regions responsible for cognition, memory, and neurotransmitter 
production, potentially contributing to the development and progression of 
CP-associated AD. Resultant neuroinflammation can further promote amyloid-beta 
(Aβ) plaque deposition, a hallmark of AD pathology. Potential therapeutic 
interventions targeting these neuroinflammatory pathways, particularly through 
the regulation of microglial NLRP3 activation, hold promise for improving 
outcomes in individuals with comorbid CP and AD. However, further research is 
required to fully elucidate the complex interplay between these conditions and 
develop effective treatment strategies.

This paper reviews the scientific evidence on new anti-amyloid monoclonal 
antibodies for treating Alzheimer's disease as a case study for improving 
scientific evidence communication. We introduce five guidelines condensed from 
the biomedical evidence literature but adapted to the short format of science 
communication in e.g. journal opinion pieces and newspaper articles. Given the 
major importance and recent confusion regarding the discussed drugs, with 
certain disagreements seen e.g. between FDA and EMA, the suggested guidelines 
may be useful to clinicians discussing with their patients and to scientists 
communicating the evidence in balance. More generally, we hope that the 
guidelines may help us to improve communication of scientific evidence on 
complex topics in opinion pieces in the scientific literature, in advocacy, and 
in media appearances.

INTRODUCTION: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) lead 
to decline in performance in activities of daily living (ADLs). Multiple 
questionnaires assess this construct among older adults. The objective of this 
study was to review existing literature studying psychometric properties of 
questionnaires assessing performance in ADLs of older adults living with MCI and 
AD specifically.
METHODS: A systematic review was conducted across Medline, CINAHL and PsychINFO 
using a combination of keywords related to ADLs, psychometrics, MCI and AD. 
Studies were included if they met the following criteria: assessments of 
performance of ADLs for older adults living with AD or MCI, reporting a minimum 
of one measurement property (e.g. internal consistency), primary research 
articles, published before June 2023 in English or French. Data extraction and 
analysis were conducted by two researchers. The methodological quality of 
psychometric properties was assessed using the COSMIN checklist.
CONSUMER AND COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT: No consumer or community involvement 
occurred.
RESULTS: A total of 2539 articles were screened and filtered down to 50 articles 
including 24 questionnaires respecting inclusion criteria. Of these 
questionnaires, the three most validated were the Amsterdam Instrumental 
activities of daily living, the disability assessment for dementia (DAD), and 
the Bayer ADL scale. Overall, for these three questionnaires, internal 
consistency, reliability and structural validity were the most studied 
psychometric properties while criterion validity and hypothesis testing were the 
least.
CONCLUSION: This study reveals the Amsterdam IADLs as the most validated 
questionnaire across psychometric properties and the DAD as the most validated 
across languages. Considering the increasing prevalence of older adults with MCI 
or AD, questionnaires established on strong measurement properties are valuable 
tools to evaluate decline in ADL performance and plan suitable interventions. 
This review provides evidence for clinicians and researchers for the selection 
of questionnaires to evaluate this population.
PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Cognitive impairment affects memory and thinking. It 
makes tasks like dressing, bathing and eating harder. Health-care workers use 
questionnaires to find out where someone struggles. This helps them plan better 
care. We reviewed questionnaires for older adults with memory and thinking 
problems. We found good ones that give important information. Using these 
questionnaires helps health-care workers support people with daily tasks. This 
study suggests testing the questionnaires more to improve them.

Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), such as agitation, 
apathy, and psychosis, are highly prevalent and have a significant impact on 
patients and their care partners. The neurobiology of BPSD involves a complex 
interplay of structural brain changes and alterations in the neurotransmitter 
system. Various genetic and plasma biomarkers have also been studied. Research 
in BPSD has been limited by heterogeneity in the diagnostic criteria and 
assessment tools. As such, there have been ongoing efforts to develop a 
gold-standard assessment tool and diagnostic criteria. Current practice 
guidelines recommend nonpharmacological therapies as first-line treatments. 
Pharmacological options are often used when there is an insufficient response to 
nonpharmacological strategies, but there can be serious adverse effects with 
existing pharmacological agents. This has resulted in growing efforts to develop 
novel therapeutics with more favorable tolerability profiles, with some showing 
promising results. Other biological therapies, such as neurostimulation, have 
also demonstrated positive results. As our understanding of BPSD evolves, 
ongoing research efforts in treatment of BPSD are warranted in order to enhance 
the quality of life for patients and their care partners.

INTRODUCTION: The large-scale approval of anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies for 
treating Alzheimer's disease (AD) has raised concerns about their safety due to 
treatment-emergent amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA).
METHODS: We present two cases of patients diagnosed with mild cognitive 
impairment due to AD who were enrolled in the GRADUATE I clinical trial. They 
received subcutaneous gantenerumab every two weeks during the study period.
RESULTS: Both patients experienced recurrent ARIA-Effusion/Edema type (ARIA-E). 
One developed symptomatic and severe ARIA, leading to hospitalization and study 
withdrawal. We report a long follow-up post-randomization (65 and 54 months), 
during which the adverse events did not appear to have a negative impact on 
disease progression. Additionally, one patient had a negative amyloid-PET over a 
year after treatment cessation.
DISCUSSION: These cases suggest that recurrent ARIA-E do not inevitably lead to 
accelerated progression, instead, may relate to possible long-term benefits. The 
mechanisms underlying these findings warrant further real-life evidence.

This study introduces EpiAgePublic, a new method to estimate biological age 
using only three specific sites on the gene ELOVL2, known for its connection to 
aging. Unlike traditional methods that require complex and extensive data, our 
model uses a simpler approach that is well-suited for next-generation sequencing 
technology, which is a more advanced method of analyzing DNA methylation. This 
new model overcomes some of the common challenges found in older methods, such 
as errors due to sample quality and processing variations. We tested 
EpiAgePublic with a large and varied group of over 4,600 people to ensure its 
accuracy. It performed on par with, and sometimes better than, more complicated 
models that use much more data for age estimation. We examined its effectiveness 
in understanding how factors like HIV infection and stress affect aging, 
confirming its usefulness in real-world clinical settings. Our results prove 
that our simple yet effective model, EpiAgePublic, can capture the subtle signs 
of aging with high accuracy. We also used this model in a study involving 
patients with Alzheimer's Disease, demonstrating the practical benefits of 
next-generation sequencing in making precise age-related assessments. This study 
lays the groundwork for future research on aging mechanisms and assessing how 
different interventions might impact the aging process using this clock.

Neuroinflammation is a blanket term that describes the body's complex 
inflammatory response in the central nervous system (CNS). It encompasses a 
phenotype shift to a proinflammatory state, the release of cytokines, the 
recruitment of peripheral immune cells, and a wide variety of other processes. 
Neuroinflammation has been implicated in nearly every major CNS disease ranging 
from Alzheimer's disease to brain cancer. Understanding and modeling 
neuroinflammation is critical for the identification of novel therapeutic 
targets in the treatment of CNS diseases. Unfortunately, the translation of 
findings from non-human models has left much to be desired. This review 
systematically discusses the role of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived 
glia and supporting cells within the CNS, including astrocytes, microglia, 
oligodendrocyte precursor cells, pericytes, and endothelial cells, to describe 
the state of the field and hope for future discoveries. hPSC-derived cells offer 
an expanded potential to study the pathobiology of neuroinflammation and 
immunomodulatory cascades that impact disease progression. While much progress 
has been made in the development of models, there is much left to explore in the 
application of these models to understand the complex inflammatory response in 
the CNS.

Neuroinflammation is a complex and dynamic response of the central nervous 
system (CNS) to injury, infection, and disease. While acute neuroinflammation 
plays a protective role by facilitating pathogen clearance and tissue repair, 
chronic and dysregulated inflammation contributes significantly to the 
progression of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, 
Parkinson's disease, and Multiple Sclerosis. This review explores the cellular 
and molecular mechanisms underlying neuroinflammation, focusing on the roles of 
microglia, astrocytes, and peripheral immune cells. Key signaling pathways, 
including NF-κB, JAK-STAT, and the NLRP3 inflammasome, are discussed alongside 
emerging regulators such as non-coding RNAs, epigenetic modifications, and the 
gut-brain axis. The therapeutic landscape is evolving, with traditional 
anti-inflammatory drugs like NSAIDs and corticosteroids offering limited 
efficacy in chronic conditions. Immunomodulators, gene and RNA-based 
therapeutics, and stem cell methods have all shown promise for more specific and 
effective interventions. Additionally, the modulation of metabolic states and 
gut microbiota has emerged as a novel strategy to regulate neuroinflammation. 
Despite significant progress, challenges remain in translating these findings 
into clinically viable therapies. Future studies should concentrate on 
integrated, interdisciplinary methods to reduce chronic neuroinflammation and 
slowing the progression of neurodegenerative disorders, providing opportunities 
for revolutionary advances in CNS therapies.

Thyroid dysfunction is associated with a number of neuropsychiatric 
manifestations. Cognitive decline is a common feature of hypothyroidism and 
clinical or subclinical hyperthyroidism. In addition, there is a significant 
association between thyroid hormone (TH) levels and the degree of cognitive 
impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD). The pathophysiology of TH-related 
neurodegeneration include changes in the blood-brain barrier, increased cellular 
stress, altered processing of β-amyloid precursor protein and the effect of TH 
on neuronal cell viability. The neurotoxicity of TH is partially mediated by the 
thyroid hormone responsive protein (THRP). This protein is 83% homologous to 
mouse c-Abl-interacting protein-2 (Abi2), a c-Abl-modulating protein with tumor 
suppressor activity. In cell cultures, increasing THRP expression either with TH 
treatment or exogenously through transfecting neuronal or PC 12 cells causes 
cell necrosis. The expression of exogenous THRP in other cells such as the 
colonic epithelial cell line Caco-2 and the glial cell line U251 has no effect 
on cell viability. The effect of THRP on cell viability is not modulated by 
c-Abl tyrosine kinase. The causal relationship between specific biochemical 
perturbations in cerebral tissue and thyroid dysfunction remains to be 
elucidated.

Doxorubicin is a highly effective anticancer agent, but its clinical use is 
restricted by severe side effects, including atherosclerosis and cardiomyopathy. 
These complications are partly attributed to doxorubicin's ability to induce 
endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) in vascular endothelial cells, a 
critical process in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis and 
cardiomyopathy. GV1001, a multifunctional peptide with anti-inflammatory, 
anti-cancer, antioxidant, and anti-Alzheimer's properties, has demonstrated 
inhibition of EndMT. We investigated whether GV1001 could counteract 
doxorubicin-induced EndMT in endothelial cells and prevent atherosclerosis in a 
mouse model. The results revealed that GV1001 significantly suppressed EndMT 
induced by doxorubicin, likely through its protective effects on mitochondria. 
By mitigating mitochondrial damage, GV1001 reduced the accumulation of 
mitochondrial and cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), repressed the 
activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), and reduced the production of 
proinflammatory cytokines in endothelial cells. Additionally, GV1001 reduced 
systemic and vascular inflammation, lipid accumulation, and monocyte/macrophage 
infiltration within arterial walls in mice. In conclusion, GV1001 appears to 
prevent doxorubicin-induced atherosclerosis by safeguarding vascular endothelial 
cells from mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, and phenotypic changes. 
These findings suggest the potential of GV1001 as a therapeutic agent to 
mitigate the long-term cardiovascular side effects associated with doxorubicin 
treatment in humans.

Amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) is a critical cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is 
generated from amyloid precursor protein (APP) through cleavages by β-secretase 
and γ-secretase. γ-Secretase, which includes presenilin, is regulated by several 
stimuli. Tau protein has also been identified as a significant factor in AD. In 
particular, Tau phosphorylation is crucial for neuronal impairment, as 
phosphorylated Tau detaches from microtubules, leading to the formation of 
neurofibrillary tangles and the destabilization of the microtubule structure. 
This instability in microtubules damages axons and dendrites, resulting in 
neuronal impairment. Notably, Aβ is linked to Tau phosphorylation. Another 
crucial factor in AD is neuroinflammation, primarily occurring in the microglia. 
Microglia possess several receptors that bind with Aβ, triggering the expression 
and release of an inflammatory factor, although their main physiological 
function is to phagocytose debris and pathogens in the brain. NF-κB activation 
plays a major role in neuroinflammation. Additionally, the production of 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the microglia contributes to this 
neuroinflammation. In microglia, superoxide is produced through NADPH oxidase, 
specifically NOX2. Rho GTPases play an essential role in regulating various 
cellular processes, including cytoskeletal rearrangement, morphology changes, 
migration, and transcription. The typical function of Rho GTPases involves 
regulating actin filament formation. Neurons, with their complex processes and 
synapse connections, rely on cytoskeletal dynamics for structural support. Other 
brain cells, such as astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes, also depend on 
specific cytoskeletal structures to maintain their unique cellular 
architectures. Thus, the aberrant regulation of Rho GTPases activity can disrupt 
actin filaments, leading to altered cell morphology, including changes in 
neuronal processes and synapses, and potentially contributing to brain diseases 
such as AD.

Phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes regulate intracellular signaling pathways 
crucial for brain development and the pathophysiology of neurological disorders. 
Among the 11 PDE subtypes, PDE4 and PDE5 are particularly significant due to 
their regulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine 
monophosphate (cGMP) signaling, respectively, which are vital for learning, 
memory, and neuroprotection. This review synthesizes current evidence on the 
roles of PDE4 and PDE5 in neurological health and disease, focusing on their 
regulation of second messenger pathways and their implications for brain 
function. Elevated PDE4 activity impairs synaptic plasticity by reducing cAMP 
levels and protein kinase A (PKA) activity, contributing to cognitive decline, 
acute brain injuries, and neuropsychiatric conditions such as bipolar disorder 
and schizophrenia. Similarly, PDE5 dysregulation disrupts nitric oxide (NO) 
signaling and protein kinase G (PKG) pathways, which are involved in 
cerebrovascular homeostasis, recovery after ischemic events, and 
neurodegenerative processes in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's 
diseases. PDE4 and PDE5 are promising therapeutic targets for neurological 
disorders. Pharmacological modulation of these enzymes offers potential to 
enhance cognitive function and mitigate pathological mechanisms underlying brain 
injuries, neurodegenerative diseases, and psychiatric disorders. Further 
research into the regulation of PDE4 and PDE5 will advance therapeutic 
strategies for these conditions.

Targeting Soluble Amyloid Oligomers in Alzheimer's Disease: A Hypothetical Model 
Study Comparing Intrathecal Pseudodelivery of mAbs Against Intravenous 
Administration.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Neurotoxic soluble amyloid-β (Aβ) oligomers are key 
drivers of Alzheimer's pathology, with evidence suggesting that early targeting 
of these soluble forms may slow disease progression. Traditional intravenous 
(IV) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) face challenges, including limited brain 
penetration and risks such as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA). This 
hypothetical study aimed to model amyloid dynamics in early-to-moderate 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and compare the efficacy of IV mAn with intrathecal 
pseudodelivery, a novel method that confines mAbs in a subcutaneous reservoir 
for selective amyloid clearance in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) without systemic 
exposure.
METHODS: A mathematical framework was employed to simulate Aβ dynamics in 
patients with early-to-moderate AD. Two therapeutic approaches were compared: IV 
mAb and intrathecal pseudodelivery of mAb. The model incorporated amyloid 
kinetics, mAb affinity, protofibril size, and therapy-induced clearance rates to 
evaluate the impact of both methods on amyloid reduction, PET negativity 
timelines, and the risk of ARIA.
RESULTS: Intrathecal pseudodelivery significantly accelerated Aβ clearance 
compared to IV administration, achieving amyloid PET scan negativity by month 
132, as opposed to month 150 with IV mAb. This method demonstrated no ARIA risk 
and reduced amyloid reaccumulation. By targeting soluble Aβ species more 
effectively, intrathecal pseudodelivery emerged as a safer and more efficient 
strategy for early AD intervention.
CONCLUSIONS: Intrathecal pseudodelivery offers a promising alternative to IV 
mAbs, overcoming challenges associated with blood-brain barrier penetration and 
systemic side effects. Further research should focus on optimizing this approach 
and exploring combination therapies to enhance clinical outcomes in AD.

Background/Objectives: The study examined the relationships between specific 
Theory-of-Mind (ToM) dimensions, cognitive planning, and sleep duration in aging 
adults. Methods: The sample included 179 participants, comprising 46 cognitively 
healthy individuals, 75 diagnosed with amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment 
(aMCI), and 58 with non-amnestic (naMCI). The mean age of the participants was 
70.23 years (SD = 4.74), with a mean educational attainment of 12.35 years (SD = 
3.22) and gender distribution of 53 men and 126 women. ToM assessment included 
tasks measuring the understanding and interpretation of non-literal speech, 
proverbs and metaphors, as well as an emotion-recognition test. For cognitive 
planning, a Tower Test was utilized. Sleep duration was measured using 
actigraphy. Results: We identified significant differences in various ToM tasks' 
performance between the groups, particularly in non-literal speech tasks and 
third-order ToM stories. The HC group consistently outperformed both MCI groups 
in these tasks, with aMCI showing higher performance than naMCI. Mediation 
analysis applied to examine potential direct and indirect effects of sleep 
duration on ToM tasks indicated that total sleep time had significant indirect 
effects through cognitive planning-mainly as rule violation total score-on 
specific ToM aspects. Hence, besides the effects of MCI pathologies and 
especially of naMCI, sleep duration seems also to be associated with ToM 
performance in aging via specific executive functioning decrements. Conclusions: 
The findings underscore the social implications of ToM deficits due to MCI 
and/or sleep duration decrease, particularly in naMCI older adults, as they can 
seriously impair their social interactions. Targeted interventions could improve 
emotional understanding, communication, and overall quality of life.

The interaction between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and sleep deprivation has 
recently gained attention in the scientific literature, and recent advances 
suggest that AD epidemiology management should coincide with the management of 
sleeping disorders. This review focuses on the aspects of the mechanisms 
underlying the link between AD and insufficient sleep with progressing age. We 
also provide information which could serve as evidence for future treatments of 
AD from the early stages in connection with sleep disorder medication.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Cognitive functions are a crucial part of daily living, 
especially for adults with Down syndrome (DS) who have a high likelihood of 
developing Alzheimer's disease in adulthood. In addition, adults with DS move 
slower and are not meeting the standard aerobic activity guidelines each week. 
The aim of this study was to examine if Assisted Cycle Therapy (ACT) would 
improve cognitive planning as measured by the Tower of London (TOL), set 
switching as measured by the modified Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, and spatial 
memory as measured by the Corsi Block Test in adults with DS as compared to 
self-paced cycling.
METHODS: Twenty-four participants were randomly assigned to one of two 
interventions over eight weeks. (1) Thirteen older adults with DS completed the 
ACT intervention, which is stationary cycling with the assistance of a motor to 
maintain a cadence at least 35% greater than voluntary cycling. (2) Eleven older 
adults with DS completed voluntary cycling (VC).
RESULTS: Our results showed that cognitive planning as measured by total correct 
score in the TOL showed improvement for both ACT and VC after 8 weeks of 
exercise, F(1, 22) = 6.22, p = 0.021. There were no significant differences for 
spatial memory or set switching.
CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that cycling exercise has a positive impact on 
cognitive function, especially problem solving in older adults with DS. Our 
results are discussed with respect to upregulation of neurotrophic factors that 
increase functioning in the prefrontal cortex that accompanies exercise and 
leads to improvements in cognitive planning which is essential to many 
activities of daily living and quality of life for older adults with DS.

Alzheimer's disease, a progressively degenerative neurological disorder, is the 
most common cause of dementia in the elderly. While its precise etiology remains 
unclear, researchers have identified diverse pathological characteristics and 
molecular pathways associated with its progression. Advances in scientific 
research have increasingly highlighted the crucial role of non-coding RNAs in 
the progression of Alzheimer's disease. These non-coding RNAs regulate several 
biological processes critical to the advancement of the disease, offering 
promising potential as therapeutic targets and diagnostic biomarkers. Therefore, 
this review aims to investigate the underlying mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease 
onset, with a particular focus on microRNAs, long non-coding RNAs, and circular 
RNAs associated with the disease. The review elucidates the potential pathogenic 
processes of Alzheimer's disease and provides a detailed description of the 
synthesis mechanisms of the three aforementioned non-coding RNAs. It 
comprehensively summarizes the various non-coding RNAs that have been identified 
to play key regulatory roles in Alzheimer's disease, as well as how these 
non-coding RNAs influence the disease's progression by regulating gene 
expression and protein functions. For example, miR-9 targets the UBE4B gene, 
promoting autophagy-mediated degradation of Tau protein, thereby reducing Tau 
accumulation and delaying Alzheimer's disease progression. Conversely, the long 
non-coding RNA BACE1-AS stabilizes BACE1 mRNA, promoting the generation of 
amyloid-β and accelerating Alzheimer's disease development. Additionally, 
circular RNAs play significant roles in regulating neuroinflammatory responses. 
By integrating insights from these regulatory mechanisms, there is potential to 
discover new therapeutic targets and potential biomarkers for early detection 
and management of Alzheimer's disease. This review aims to enhance the 
understanding of the relationship between Alzheimer's disease and non-coding 
RNAs, potentially paving the way for early detection and novel treatment 
strategies.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a significant challenge in neurology, marked by 
progressive cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. Despite extensive research 
efforts, effective treatments are still lacking. Traditional drug discovery is 
often slow and costly, frequently resulting in limited success. Drug 
repurposing, which identifies new therapeutic uses for existing medications, has 
emerged as a promising approach to expedite AD treatment development. This 
review examines the potential of drug repurposing to transform AD therapy by 
utilizing the established safety profiles and known mechanisms of current drugs. 
We explore various repurposed drugs under investigation for AD, originally 
intended for cardiovascular, metabolic, and psychiatric conditions. Detailed 
discussions include how these drugs provide neuroprotective benefits by 
inhibiting amyloid-beta aggregation, reducing tau phosphorylation, and 
modulating neuroinflammation. Additionally, we emphasize the benefits of drug 
repurposing, such as shortened development timelines, lower costs, and increased 
chances of clinical success. By integrating current research findings, this 
review offers a thorough overview of the most promising repurposed drug 
candidates and their potential impact on AD treatment strategies. It stresses 
the importance of innovative approaches in AD research and calls for greater 
investment in drug repurposing initiatives. Through these strategies, we aim to 
accelerate the availability of effective treatments, providing renewed hope and 
a brighter future for those affected by this devastating disease.

Most natural products in nature have broad but not exceedingly good biological 
activities. The pyrazole structure has been introduced into natural products due 
to its suitability for various synthetic methods and its broad pharmacological 
activities. This article provides a detailed introduction to the 
anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, and anti-Alzheimer 
disease activities of pyrazole-modified natural product derivatives, 
particularly their anti-tumor activity. It is worth noting that compared to lead

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive cognitive decline due 
to neuronal damage and impaired neurogenesis. Preserving neuronal integrity and 
stimulating neurogenesis are promising therapeutic strategies to combat 
AD-related cognitive dysfunction. In this study, we synthesized metformin carbon 
dots (CMCDs) using a hydrothermal method with metformin hydrochloride and citric 
acid as precursors. Notably, we found that CMCDs were significantly more 
effective than metformin in promoting the differentiation of neural stem cells 
(NSCs) into functional neurons under amyloid-beta (Aβ) conditions. Moreover, 
CMCDs fostered NSCs proliferation, enhanced neurogenesis, reduced Aβ deposition, 
and inhibited glial cell activation. We also examined neuronal structure by 
assessing Map2/NF-H/PSD95/SYN expression in the hippocampus, finding that CMCDs 
robustly strengthened neuronal structure. These results suggest that CMCDs can 
cognitive dysfunction in AD and promote the proliferation and neurogenesis of 
NSCs, as well as ameliorate neuronal injury. Hence, CMCDs emerge as promising 
candidates for AD therapy, demonstrating superior efficacy compared to metformin 
alone, and offering novel insights into small molecule drug interventions for 
AD.

ABSTRACT: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are neurological 
conditions that primarily impact the elderly having distinctive traits and some 
similarities in terms of symptoms and progression. The multifactorial nature of 
AD and PD encourages exploring potentiality of multi-target therapy for 
addressing these conditions to conventional, the "one drug one target" strategy. 
This study highlights the searching of potential HDAC4 inhibitors through 
multiple screening approaches. In this context, structure-based pharmacophore 
model, ligand profiler mapping and MCDM approaches were performed for target 
prioritization. Similarly, ligand profiler, MCDM and Docking studies were 
performed to prioritize multi-targeted HDAC4 inhibitors. These comprehensive 
approaches unveiled 5 common targets and 5 multi-targeted prioritized compounds 
consensually. MD simulations, DFT and binding free energy calculations 
corroborated the stability and robustness of propitious compound 774 across 5 
prioritized targets. In conclusion, the screened compound 774 (ChEMBL 4063938) 
could be a promising multi-targeted therapy for managing AD and PD further 
rendering experimental validation.

α-Synucleinopathies constitute a spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders, 
including Parkinson's disease (PD), Lewy body dementia (LBD), Multiple System 
Atrophy (MSA), and Alzheimer's disease concurrent with LBD (AD-LBD). These 
disorders are unified by a pathological hallmark: aberrant misfolding and 
accumulation of α-synuclein (α-syn). This review delves into the pivotal role of 
α-syn, the key agent in α-synucleinopathy pathophysiology, and provides a survey 
of potential therapeutics that target cell-to-cell spread of pathologic α-syn. 
Recognizing the intricate complexity and multifactorial etiology of 
α-synucleinopathy, the review illuminates the potential of various membrane 
receptors, proteins, intercellular spreading pathways, and pathological agents 
for therapeutic interventions. While significant progress has been made in 
understanding α-synucleinopathy, the pursuit of efficacious treatments remains 
challenging. Several strategies involving decreasing α-syn production and 
aggregation, increasing α-syn degradation, lowering extracellular α-syn, and 
inhibiting cellular uptake of α-syn are presented. The paper underscores the 
necessity of meticulous and comprehensive investigations to advance our 
knowledge of α-synucleinopathy pathology and ultimately develop innovative 
therapeutic strategies for α-synucleinopathies.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative 
condition affecting around 50 million people worldwide. Bone marrow-derived 
mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) have emerged as a promising source for cellular 
therapy due to their ability to differentiate into multiple cell types and their 
paracrine effects. However, the direct injection of BMMSCs can lead to potential 
unpredictable impairments, prompting a renewed interest in their paracrine 
effects for AD treatment. The specific mechanism and central role of cytokines 
in this process have not been fully elucidated.
METHODS: Mouse BMMSCs were isolated, validated, and then transplanted 
intracerebrally into APP/PS1 female mice. The behavioral tests, including 
open-field test, novel object recognition test, and Morris water maze were 
performed, followed by β-amyloidosis plaque and neuron apoptosis analyses. Then 
the tissue RNA sequencing and mBMMSC cytokine analysis were performed. A 
cytokine antibody array for BMMSCs and the brain slice models were performed 
with AD model tissues were used to elucidate the molecular mechanisms. Finally, 
APP/PS1 mice were administrated with cytokine mixture for cognitive recovery.
RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that BMMSCs significantly improved cognitive 
function, reduced beta-amyloid plaque deposition, and decreased apoptotic 
neurons through the activation of the AKT signaling pathway. Using a cytokine 
antibody array, we identified three highly expressed AKT pathway regulated 
neuroprotective factors in BMMSCs: IGF1, VEGF, and Periostin2. These cytokines 
were found to upregulate inhibitors of apoptosis family proteins (IAPs) and 
suppress Caspase-3 activity in brain slices induced with beta amyloidosis (Aβ), 
okadaic acid (OA), and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). When injection of this cytokine 
mixture to APP/PS1 mice also resulted in a mitigation of cognitive impairment.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the secretory factors IGF1, VEGF, and 
Periostin2 derived from BMMSCs play a crucial role in neuroprotection by 
modulating the AKT/IAPs pathway to restore neuronal function. These cytokine 
sets could be a potential therapeutic strategy for AD and lay the groundwork for 
promising clinical applications.

OBJECTIVE: Despite the well-established increased risk of cardiovascular 
mortality in individuals with bipolar disorder (BD), prevention and treatment of 
cardiovascular risk factors and diseases have been largely overlooked in this 
population. This manuscript reviews the pathophysiological basis of the 
connection between BD and cardiovascular diseases, highlighting their shared 
mechanisms, reciprocal interactions, and relevant prevention and treatment 
strategies.
METHODS: For this narrative review, a search was carried out on PubMed using the 
keywords bipolar disorder, cardiovascular diseases, and cardiovascular risk 
factors.
RESULTS: The increased frequency of cardiovascular morbidity in BD can be 
attributed to overlapping biological and psychosocial mechanisms. These 
mechanisms are complex and involve both direct effects of BD and indirect 
effects mediated by lifestyle and pharmacological factors. Cardiovascular 
diseases also significantly exacerbate the clinical course of BD and increase 
morbidity and healthcare costs; thus, their effective management can improve 
psychiatric outcomes and vice versa. However, patients with BD frequently 
encounter healthcare barriers.
CONCLUSION: Awareness initiatives and research on integrated care are needed to 
determine the best strategies for improving cardiovascular and psychiatric 
outcomes in individuals with BD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a significant healthcare challenge, 
necessitating innovative therapeutic approaches to address its complex and 
multifactorial nature. Traditional drug discovery strategies targeting single 
molecular targets are not sufficient for the effective treatment of AD. In 
recent years, MTDLs have emerged as promising candidates for AD therapy, aiming 
to simultaneously modulate multiple pathological targets. Among the various 
strategies employed in MTDL design, pharmacophore hybridization offers a 
versatile approach to integrate diverse pharmacophoric features within a single 
molecular scaffold. This strategy provides access to a wide array of chemical 
space for the design and development of novel therapeutic agents. This review, 
therefore, provides a comprehensive overview of skeletal diversity exhibited by 
MTDLs designed recently for AD therapy based on pharmacophore hybridization 
approach. A diverse range of pharmacophoric elements and core scaffolds 
hybridized to construct MTDLs that has the potential to target multiple 
pathological features of AD including amyloid-beta aggregation, tau protein 
hyperphosphorylation, cholinergic dysfunction, oxidative stress, and 
neuroinflammation are discussed. Through the comprehensive analysis and 
integration of structural insights of key biomolecular targets, this review aims 
to enhance optimization efforts in MTDL design, ultimately striving towards a 
comprehensive cure for the multifaceted pathophysiology of the disease.

People with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) carry a considerable risk of 
developing dementia. Studies have shown that female sex hormones have 
long-lasting neuroprotective and anti-aging properties, and the increased risk 
of MCI and AD is associated with the lack of estrogen during menopause. Previous 
studies have shown that Tiao Geng Decoction (TGD) may have antioxidant and anti 
apoptotic properties, which may prevent neurodegenerative diseases. However, 
whether TGD is effective in improving mild cognitive impairment due to 
postmenopausal estrogen deficiency and its potential pharmacological mechanisms 
remain unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible 
pharmacological mechanisms of TGD in preventing postmenopausal MCI. We utilized 
RNA-seq technology to screen for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 
enrichment pathways in the hippocampal tissue of different groups of mice. 
Additionally, we adopted single-cell sequencing technology to study the cell 
types of Alzheimer's disease (AD) group and Normal Control (NC) group, the 
differential marker genes of each cell subgroup, and the GO enrichment analysis 
of each cell type. Both RNA sequencing and single-cell sequencing results showed 
a significant correlation between TGD and NF-κb pathway in improving mild 
cognitive impairment in postmenopausal women. The experimental verification 
results showed that the spatial learning and memory abilities of APP/PS1 model 
mice were weakened after ovariectomy, and the reproductive cycle on vaginal 
smears was in the interphase of diestrus. The levels of serum E2, and P-tau181 
in mice were significantly down regulated, while the levels of brain tissue 
homogenate A β 42, IL-1 β, and IL-18 were significantly up-regulated, indicating 
successful modeling. Combining Western blotting, RT-qPCR, and transmission 
electron microscopy analyses, it was found that the low estrogen environment 
induced by oophorectomy can activate the NF-κb signaling pathway, activate the 
expression of NLRP3 inflammasome and A β secretase BACE1, and induce 
neuroinflammatory damage in hippocampal astrocytes. These results conform to the 
modeling characteristics of MCI. After TGD intervention, the spatial learning 
and memory abilities of MCI mice were significantly improved. The 
pharmacological validation results indicated that high concentration doses of 
TGD had a more significant effect on MCI. Subsequently, we used high 
concentration TGD (0.32 g/ml) as the traditional Chinese medicine group for 
further validation, protein blotting and RT-qPCR results indicated that TGD can 
effectively stimulate the secretion of ER α and ER β, inhibit the NF-κb pathway, 
downregulate BACE1, and inhibit the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome related 
proteins. In addition, the immunofluorescence results of hippocampal astrocytes 
showed that TGD can effectively facilitate the expression of AQP1 and 
significantly lower the sedimentation of A β compared with the model group. Our 
research suggests that there is a high correlation between a low estrogen 
environment and the occurrence and development of MCI. TGD may regulate the 
ERs/NF - κ b/AQP1 signaling pathway, promote estrogen secretion, activate AQP1, 
reduce A β deposition, reverse MCI neuroinflammatory injury, improve mild 
cognitive impairment, and prevent the occurrence of AD. This study revealed for 
the first time that TGD may be a potential new alternative drug for preventing 
and improving menopausal MCI.

Dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), 
presents critical challenges for correctional systems, particularly as global 
populations age. AD, affecting 60-80% of dementia cases, primarily impairs 
memory and cognition in individuals over 65. In contrast, FTD, rarer than AD but 
not uncommon in those under 65, affects the frontal and temporal brain regions, 
leading to deficits in social behavior, language, and impulse control, often 
resulting in antisocial actions and legal consequences. Behavioral variant FTD 
is especially associated with socially inappropriate and impulsive behaviors due 
to frontal lobe degeneration. The prevalence of cognitive impairment in 
incarcerated populations is high, exacerbated by prison environments that 
compound distress and limited access to specialized healthcare. Studies indicate 
that up to 11% of United States state prison inmates over the age of 55 exhibit 
cognitive impairments, often undiagnosed, resulting in punitive rather than 
rehabilitative responses to symptoms like disinhibition and aggression. Ethical 
concerns around criminal responsibility for individuals with dementia are 
increasingly prominent, particularly regarding their ability to comprehend and 
engage in legal proceedings. The growing elderly prison population necessitates 
reform in correctional healthcare to include early cognitive assessment, 
targeted intervention, and tailored post-release programs. Addressing these 
needs is essential to ensure appropriate treatments, alleviate healthcare 
demands, and support reintegration for cognitively impaired inmates.

PURPOSE: This paper aims to develop a three-dimensional (3D) Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) prediction method, thereby bettering current predictive methods, 
which struggle to fully harness the potential of structural magnetic resonance 
imaging (sMRI) data.
METHODS: Traditional convolutional neural networks encounter pressing 
difficulties in accurately focusing on the AD lesion structure. To address this 
issue, a 3D decoupling, self-attention network for AD prediction is proposed. 
Firstly, a multi-scale decoupling block is designed to enhance the network's 
ability to extract fine-grained features by segregating convolutional channels. 
Subsequently, a self-attention block is constructed to extract and adaptively 
fuse features from three directions (sagittal, coronal and axial), so that more 
attention is geared towards brain lesion areas. Finally, a clustering loss 
function is introduced and combined with the cross-entropy loss to form a joint 
loss function for enhancing the network's ability to discriminate between 
different sample types.
RESULTS: The accuracy of our model is 0.985 for the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset and 0.963 for the Australian Imaging, 
Biomarker & Lifestyle (AIBL) dataset, both of which are higher than the 
classification accuracy of similar tasks in this category. This demonstrates 
that our model can accurately distinguish between normal control (NC) and 
Alzheimer's Disease (AD), as well as between stable mild cognitive impairment 
(sMCI) and progressive mild cognitive impairment (pMCI).
CONCLUSION: The proposed AD prediction network exhibits competitive performance 
when compared with state-of-the-art methods. The proposed model successfully 
addresses the challenges of dealing with 3D sMRI image data and the limitations 
stemming from inadequate information in 2D sections, advancing the utility of 
predictive methods for AD diagnosis and treatment.

INTRODUCTION: Freezing of gait (FOG) is a disabling symptom for people with 
Parkinson's disease (PwPD). Turning on the spot for one minute in alternating 
directions (360 turn) while performing a cognitive dual-task (DT) is a fast and 
sensitive way to provoke FOG. The FOG-index is a widely used wearable 
sensor-based algorithm to quantify FOG severity during turning. Despite that, 
the FOG-index's classification performance and criterion validity is not tested 
against the gold standard (i.e., video-rated time spent freezing). Therefore, 
this study aimed to evaluate the FOG-index's classification performance and 
criterion validity to assess FOG severity during 360 turn. Additionally, we 
investigated the FOG-index's optimal cutoff values to differentiate between PwPD 
with and without FOG.
METHODS: 164 PwPD self-reported the presence of FOG on the New Freezing of Gait 
Questionnaire (NFOGQ) and performed the DT 360 turn in the ON medication state 
while being videoed and wearing five wearable sensors. Two independent clinical 
experts rated FOG on video. ROC-AUC values assessed the FOG-index's 
classification accuracy against self-reported FOG and expert ratings. 
Spearman-rho was used to evaluate the correlation between expert and FOG-index 
ratings of FOG severity.
RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients self-reported FOG, while 104 were classified as a 
freezer by the experts. The FOG-index had limited classification agreement with 
the NFOGQ (AUC = 0.60, p = 0.115, sensitivity 46.4%, specificity 72.8%) and the 
experts (AUC = 0.65, p < 0.001, sensitivity 68.3%, specificity 61.7%). Only weak 
correlations were found between the algorithm outputs and expert ratings for FOG 
severity (rho = 0.13-0.38).
CONCLUSION: A surprisingly large discrepancy was found between self-reported and 
expert-rated FOG during the 360 turning task, indicating PwPD do not always 
notice FOG in daily life. The FOG-index achieved suboptimal classification 
performance and poor criterion validity to assess FOG severity. Regardless, 360 
turning proved a sensitive task to elicit FOG. Further development of the 
FOG-index is warranted, and long-term follow-up studies are needed to assess the 
predictive value of the 360 turning task for classifying FOG conversion.

Blood-based biomarkers have been revolutionizing the detection, diagnosis and 
screening of Alzheimer's disease. Specifically, phosphorylated-tau variants 
(p-tau181, p-tau217 and p-tau231) are promising biomarkers for identifying 
Alzheimer's disease pathology. Antibody-based assays such as single molecule 
arrays immunoassays are powerful tools to investigate pathological changes 
indicated by blood-based biomarkers and have been studied extensively in the 
Alzheimer's disease research field. A novel proteomic technology-NUcleic acid 
Linked Immuno-Sandwich Assay (NULISA)-was developed to improve the sensitivity 
of traditional proximity ligation assays and offer a comprehensive outlook for 
120 protein biomarkers in neurodegenerative diseases. Due to the relative 
novelty of the NULISA technology in quantifying Alzheimer's disease biomarkers, 
validation through comparisons with more established methods is required. The 
main objective of the current study was to determine the capability of p-tau 
variants quantified using NULISA for identifying abnormal amyloid-β and tau 
pathology. We assessed 397 participants [mean (standard deviation) age, 64.8 
(15.7) years; 244 females (61.5%) and 153 males (38.5%)] from the Translational 
Biomarkers in Aging and Dementia (TRIAD) cohort where participants had plasma 
measurements of p-tau181, p-tau217 and p-tau231 from NULISA and single molecule 
arrays immunoassays. Participants also underwent neuroimaging assessments, 
including structural MRI, amyloid-PET and tau-PET. Our findings suggest an 
excellent agreement between plasma p-tau variants quantified using NULISA and 
single molecule arrays immunoassays. Plasma p-tau217 measured with NULISA shows 
excellent discriminative accuracy for abnormal amyloid-PET (area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.918, 95% confidence interval = 0.883 
to 0.953, P < 0.0001) and tau-PET (area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve = 0.939; 95% confidence interval = 0.909 to 0.969, P < 
0.0001). It also presents the capability for differentiating tau-PET staging. 
Validation of the NULISA-measured plasma biomarkers adds to the current 
analytical methods for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, screening and staging and 
could potentially expedite the development of a blood-based biomarker panel.

Traumatic brain injury is widely viewed as a risk factor for dementia, but the 
biological mechanisms underlying this association are still unclear. In previous 
studies, traumatic brain injury has been associated with the hallmark 
pathologies of Alzheimer's disease, i.e. amyloid-β plaques and neurofibrillary 
tangles comprised of hyperphosphorylated tau. Depending on the type and location 
of trauma, traumatic brain injury can induce spatially heterogeneous brain 
lesions that may pre-dispose for the development of Alzheimer's disease 
pathology in aging. Therefore, we hypothesized that a history of traumatic brain 
injury may be related to spatially heterogeneous amyloid-β and tau pathology 
patterns that deviate from the stereotypical temporo-parietal patterns in 
Alzheimer's disease. To test this, we included 103 Vietnam War veterans of whom 
65 had experienced traumatic brain injury (n = 40, 38.8% mild; n = 25, 24.3% 
moderate/severe). Most individuals had a history of 1 (n = 35, 53.8%) or 2 (n = 
15, 23.1%) traumatic brain injury events. We included the group without a 
history of traumatic brain injury (n = 38, 36.9%) as controls. The majority was 
cognitively normal (n = 80, 77.7%), while a subset had mild cognitive impairment 
(n = 23, 22.3%). All participants underwent [18F]florbetapir/Amyvid amyloid-β 
PET and [18F]flortaucipir/Tauvid tau-PET 39.63 ± 18.39 years after their last 
traumatic brain injury event. We found no differences in global amyloid-β and 
tau-PET levels between groups, suggesting that a history of traumatic brain 
injury does not pre-dispose to accumulate amyloid-β or tau pathology in general. 
However, we found that traumatic brain injury was associated with altered 
spatial patterns of amyloid-β and tau, with relatively greater deposition in 
fronto-parietal brain regions. These regions are prone to damage in traumatic 
brain injury, while they are typically only affected in later stages of 
Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, in our traumatic brain injury groups, the 
association between amyloid-β and tau was reduced in Alzheimer-typical temporal 
regions but increased in frontal regions that are commonly associated with 
traumatic brain injury. Altogether, while acknowledging the relatively small 
sample size and generally low levels of Alzheimer's disease pathology in this 
sample, our findings suggest that traumatic brain injury induces spatial 
patterns of amyloid-β and tau that differ from patterns observed in typical 
Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, traumatic brain injury may be associated with 
a de-coupling of amyloid-β and tau in regions vulnerable in Alzheimer's disease. 
These findings indicate that focal brain damage in early/mid-life may change 
neurodegenerative trajectories in late-life.

BACKGROUND: The human gut mycobiome, a minor but integral component of the gut 
microbiome, has emerged as a significant player in host homeostasis and disease 
development. While bacteria have traditionally been the focus of gut microbiome 
studies, recent evidence suggests that fungal communities (mycobiota) may also 
play a crucial role in modulating health, particularly in neuropsychiatric 
disorders.
OBJECTIVE: This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of current 
knowledge on the relationship between the gut mycobiome and neuropsychiatric 
disorders, exploring the potential of targeting fungal communities as a novel 
therapeutic strategy.
METHODS: We summarized recent findings from metagenomic analyses that 
characterize the diversity and composition of gut mycobiota and discuss how 
these communities interact with the host and other microorganisms via the 
gut-brain axis. Key methodologies for studying mycobiota, such as 
high-throughout sequencing and bioinformatics approaches, were also reviewed to 
highlight advances in the field.
RESULTS: Emerging research links gut mycobiota dysbiosis to conditions such as 
schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, autism spectrum disorders, bipolar disorder, 
and depression. Studies indicate that specific fungal populations, such as 
Candida and Saccharomyces, may influence neuroinflammation, gut permeability and 
immune responses, thereby affecting mental health outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Understanding the gut mycobiome's role in neuropsychiatric disorders 
opens new avenues for therapeutic interventions, including antifungal 
treatments, probiotics, and dietary modifications. Future research should 
integrate multi-omics approaches to unravel the complex interkingdom 
interactions within the gut ecosystem, paving the way for personalized medicine 
in mental health care.

BACKGROUND: Studies have shown the clinical effects of repetitive transcranial 
magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on depression in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, 
the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. The measurement of brain 
activation links neurobiological and functional aspects but is challenging in 
patients with dementia. This study investigated the influence of rTMS on 
cortical activation in patients with AD and depressive symptoms, measured using 
functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) during a verbal fluency task.
METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind study, patients with AD and depression 
received either active rTMS (n = 17) or sham-rTMS (n = 16). Patients received 
4 weeks of bilateral standard rTMS (1 Hz rTMS delivered to the right 
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and 10-Hz rTMS delivered to the left 
DLPFC).
RESULTS: No significant changes were found in the Mini-Mental State Examination 
(MMSE) and Modified Barthel Index (MBI); however, significant changes were found 
for the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) and the depression 
score of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-depression; p < 0.05). The results 
showed a decrease in the concentration of oxygenated hemoglobin, as measured 
with fNIRS, from baseline to week 4 in CH41 (in right DLPFC; p = 0.0047, 
FDR-corrected). There was a negative correlation between the improvement in 
HAMD-17 severity in these patients and reduced oxygenated hemodynamic response 
of CH41 (r = - 0.504, p = 0.039).
CONCLUSION: The results indicated a positive effect of rTMS on depression in 
patients with AD. The underlying cortical changes were imaged using fNIRS. 
Prefrontal activation measured by fNIRS is a potential biomarker for monitoring 
the response of patients with depression in AD to rTMS treatment.

How close is autophagy-targeting therapy for Alzheimer's disease to clinical 
use? A summary of autophagy modulators in clinical studies.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder clinically 
characterized by progressive decline of memory and cognitive functions, and it 
is the leading cause of dementia accounting for 60%-80% of dementia patients. A 
pathological hallmark of AD is the accumulation of aberrant protein/peptide 
aggregates such as extracellular amyloid plaques containing amyloid-beta 
peptides and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles composed of 
hyperphosphorylated tau. These aggregates result from the failure of the 
proteostasis network, which encompasses protein synthesis, folding, and 
degradation processes. Autophagy is an intracellular self-digesting system 
responsible for the degradation of protein aggregates and damaged organelles. 
Impaired autophagy is observed in most neurodegenerative disorders, indicating 
the link between autophagy dysfunction and these diseases. A massive 
accumulation of autophagic vacuoles in neurons in Alzheimer's brains evidences 
autophagy impairment in AD. Modulating autophagy has been proposed as a 
therapeutic strategy for AD because of its potential to clear aggregated 
proteins. However, autophagy modulation therapy for AD is not yet clinically 
available. This mini-review aims to summarize clinical studies testing potential 
autophagy modulators for AD and to evaluate their proximity to clinical use. We 
accessed clinicaltrials.gov provided by the United States National Institutes of 
Health to identify completed and ongoing clinical trials. Additionally, we 
discuss the limitations and challenges of these therapies.

The utilization of quercetin nanoparticles as a novel therapeutic strategy has 
garnered significant attention in recent years. These nanoparticles offer a 
unique approach to enhancing delivery and effectiveness while overcoming the 
drawbacks of quercetin. By exploiting the advantages of nanotechnology, such as 
increased stability and improved bioavailability, quercetin nanoparticles hold 
significant potential for developing innovative treatments across various 
medical fields. Quercetin nanoparticles have emerged as an indispensable 
component in numerous pharmaceutical and medicinal formulations. They are 
recognized for their anticancer, antitumor, anti-inflammatory, and antidiabetic 
properties, making them valuable in addressing allergic reactions, metabolic 
disorders, inflammatory disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and arthritis. From 
a pharmacological perspective, quercetin nanoparticles have demonstrated 
beneficial effects against Alzheimer's disease, primarily through their 
inhibitory impact on acetylcholinesterase. Furthermore, these nanoparticles have 
been scientifically documented to possess antioxidant, anticarcinogenic, 
hepatoprotective, and cytotoxic activities. This comprehensive review aims to 
explore the pharmacokinetics and biological activities associated with quercetin 
nanoparticles. It also highlights their potential as therapeutic agents in 
treating a wide range of diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, cancer, and 
neurodegenerative disorders.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative 
disorder that is difficult to predict and is typically diagnosed only after 
symptoms manifest. Recently, CD4+ T cell-derived double-negative T (DNT) cells 
have shown strong immuno-regulatory properties in both in vitro and in vivo 
neuronal inflammation studies. However, the effectiveness of DNT cells in 
treating on AD are not yet fully understood.
OBJECTIVE: This study's aims were three-fold, to (1) evaluate the efficacy of 
CD4+ T cell-derived DNT cells treatment on AD mice, (2) understand how DNT 
treatment make changes in different cell types of 5FAD mice, (3) identify the 
side effects of DNT treatment.
METHODS: We performed tail vein injection of transformed and amplified CD4+ T 
cell-derived DNT cells into 5 × FAD mice, while using WT mice and saline 
injection 5FAD mice as controls. DNT suspensions or NaCl alone were administered 
to 5 × FAD mice at the 6 months of age. For intravenous injection (n = 10 for 
both DNT and control injections), 5 × FAD mice were injected with a total of 
5 × 106 DNT cells suspended in 200 μL of 0.9% NaCl or 0.9% NaCl alone via the 
lateral tail vein. Behavioral tests and pathology tests were carried out 30 days 
after cell transplantation.
RESULTS: Through qualitative analysis, we identified 6 main themes. DNT from 
young wild-type mice enhance the capability of spatial learning and memory in AD 
mice. DNT cell treatment rejuvenates the microglial function. DNT cell treatment 
improves the state of oligodendrocytes. DNT cell treatment finetunes the 
activation of the immune system. DNT cell treatment improves the synaptic 
plasticity and increases the complexity of neurons. DNT cell treatment reduces 
the density of amyloid Beta plaques deposition in the cortex and hippocampus of 
5 × FAD mice.
DISCUSSION: The findings from this study reveal that DNT treatment improved 
spatial memory and learning abilities, reduced Aβ deposition, and enhanced 
synaptic plasticity, contrasting with previous reports on thymus-derived DNT 
cells. Additionally, CD4+ T cell-derived DNT therapy exhibited anti-inflammatory 
effects and modulated microglial function, promoting a neuroprotective 
environment. Notably, DNT treatment also reduced tau pathology by decreasing 
levels of abnormally phosphorylated tau. These findings suggest that CD4+ T 
cell-derived DNT cells hold therapeutic potential for AD, effectively targeting 
both Aβ and tau pathologies.

BACKGROUND: Apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE4) is the strongest genetic risk factor for 
late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). A recent case report identified a rare 
variant in APOE, APOE3-R136S (Christchurch), proposed to confer resistance to 
autosomal dominant Alzheimer's Disease (AD). However, it remains unclear whether 
and how this variant exerts its protective effects.
METHODS: We introduced the R136S variant into mouse Apoe (ApoeCh) and 
investigated its effect on the development of AD-related pathology using the 
5xFAD model of amyloidosis and the PS19 model of tauopathy. We used 
immunohistochemical and biochemical analysis along with single-cell spatial 
omics and bulk proteomics to explore the impact of the ApoeCh variant on AD 
pathological development and the brain's response to plaques and tau.
RESULTS: In 5xFAD mice, ApoeCh enhances a Disease-Associated Microglia (DAM) 
phenotype in microglia surrounding plaques, and reduces plaque load, dystrophic 
neurites, and plasma neurofilament light chain. By contrast, in PS19 mice, 
ApoeCh suppresses the microglial and astrocytic responses to tau-laden neurons 
and does not reduce tau accumulation or phosphorylation, but partially rescues 
tau-induced synaptic and myelin loss. We compared how microglia responses differ 
between the two mouse models to elucidate the distinct DAM signatures induced by 
ApoeCh. We identified upregulation of antigen presentation-related genes in the 
DAM response in a PS19 compared to a 5xFAD background, suggesting a differential 
response to amyloid versus tau pathology that is modulated by the presence of 
ApoeCh. Bulk proteomics show upregulated mitochondrial protein abundance with 
ApoeCh in 5xFAD mice, but reductions in mitochondrial and translation associated 
proteins in PS19 mice.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the ability of the ApoeCh variant to 
modulate microglial responses based on the type of pathology, enhancing DAM 
reactivity in amyloid models and dampening neuroinflammation to promote 
protection in tau models. This suggests that the Christchurch variant's 
protective effects likely involve multiple mechanisms, including changes in 
receptor binding and microglial programming.

BACKGROUND: Patient engagement (PE) in clinical trials has gained importance yet 
remains uncommon, particularly in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 
a critical precursor to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cannabidiol (CBD) shows 
potential in slowing MCI progression due to its neuroprotective and 
anti-inflammatory properties. In CBD research, PE is underutilized too. To 
design a study on CBD for MCI, we administered an online survey to individuals 
with MCI to better understand their preferences for trial setup and outcomes.
METHODS: We asked 209 individuals with MCI to complete an online survey 
assessing (i) willingness to participate in a trial using CBD; (ii) importance 
of improvements in various domains; (iii) acceptance of adverse events (AEs); 
(iv) reasons for AE-related dropout; (v) willingness to undergo blood sampling 
and lumbar puncture to assess AD pathology; and (vi) willingness to participate 
in a trial with a 50% chance of receiving a placebo. Data were analyzed with 
descriptive statistics.
RESULTS: N = 118 agreed to participate and N = 88 completed the survey. 
Participants prioritized improvement in cognitive abilities (87.5%), followed by 
quality of life (63.6%), daily activities (55.7%), sleep (55.7%), pain (52.3%), 
mood (52.3%), behavior (48.9%), and anxiety (43.2%). Headache (55.7%) was the 
least accepted AE followed by nausea (46.6%), fatigue (35.2%), and diarrhea 
(35.2%). Persistent diarrhea (90.9%) and severe fatigue (84.1%) were the main 
reasons for potential dropout. While most would undergo blood sampling (67.0%), 
only a minority (21.6%) would accept lumbar puncture. One-third were ready to 
participate (34.1%), while 54.5% were interested pending details. Among those in 
favor of participation, 71.6% would participate even with a 50% chance of 
placebo.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified cognitive improvement as highly relevant for 
patients, indicating cognitive assessment tools as primary endpoints in MCI 
research. Given concerns about AEs, dose titration should be carefully 
considered to enhance acceptance and prevent AEs. Blood sampling seems 
well-accepted for AD biomarker assessment. Despite potential AEs, participation 
in a trial using CBD for MCI is seen as attractive, even under 
placebo-controlled conditions. This cross-sectional study emphasizes the 
importance of patient engagement in designing high-quality trials for using CBD 
to treat MCI.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects more than 
6.2 million Americans aged 65 and older, particularly women. Along with AD's 
main hallmarks (formation of β-amyloid plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles), 
there are vascular alterations that occurs in AD pathology. Adenosine A2 
receptor (A2AR) is one of the key factors of brain vascular autoregulation and 
is overexpressed in AD patients. Our previous findings suggest that protein 
arginine methyltransferase 4 (PRMT4) is overexpressed in AD, which leads to 
decrease in cerebral blood flow in aged female 3xTg mice. We aimed to 
investigate the mechanism behind A2AR signaling in the regulation of brain 
perfusion and blood-brain barrier integrity in age and sex-dependent 3xTg mice, 
and if it is related to PRMT4. Istradefylline, a highly selective A2AR 
antagonist, was used to modulate A2AR signaling. Aged female 3xTg and C57BL/6 J 
mice were evaluated for brain perfusion (via laser speckle) and cognitive 
function (via open field, T-maze and novel object recognition). Our results 
suggest that modulation of A2AR signaling in aged female 3xTg increased cerebral 
perfusion by decreasing PRMT4 expression, restored the levels of APP and tau, 
maintained blood-brain barrier integrity by maintaining the expression of tight 
junction proteins, and preserved functional learning/memory.

BACKGROUND: Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), including Alzheimer's disease, 
Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease, are complex and challenging due 
to their intricate pathophysiology and limited treatment options.
METHODS: This review systematically sourced articles related to 
neurodegenerative diseases, neurodegeneration, quercetin, and clinical studies 
from primary medical databases, including Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science.
RESULTS: Recent studies have included quercetin to impact the cellular and 
molecular pathways involved in neurodegeneration. Quercetin, a flavonoid 
abundant in vegetables and fruits, is gaining attention for its antioxidant, 
anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic properties. It regulates signaling pathways 
such as nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), sirtuins, and phosphatidylinositol 
3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt). These pathways are essential for cellular 
survival, inflammation regulation, and apoptosis. Preclinical and clinical 
studies have shown that quercetin improves symptoms and pathology in 
neurodegenerative models, indicating promising outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: The study explores the potential of incorporating laboratory 
research into practical medical treatment, focusing on quercetin's 
neuroprotective effects on NDs and its optimal dosage.

Tau is a well-known microtubule-associated protein and is located in the 
cytoplasm of neurons, which play a crucial role in Alzheimer's diseases. Due to 
its preferred binding to DNA sequences found in the nucleolus and 
pericentromeric heterochromatin, Tau has been found within the cell nucleus, 
where it may be a nucleic acid-associated protein. Tau has the ability to 
directly interact with nuclear pore complex nucleoporins, influencing both their 
structural and functional integrity. The interaction between Tau and NUPs 
highlights a potential mechanism underlying NPC dysfunction in AD pathogenesis. 
Pathological Tau hinders the import and export of nucleus through RAN mediated 
cascades. Nuclear Tau aggregates colocalize with membrane less organelles called 
nuclear speckles, which are involved in pre-mRNA splicing, and modify their 
dynamics, composition, and structure. Additionally, SRRM2 and other nuclear 
speckle proteins including MSUT2 and PABPN1 mislocalize to cytosolic Tau 
aggregates, and causes propagation of Tau aggregates. Research highlights, 
Extracellular Tau Oligomers induce significant nuclear invagination. They act as 
a key player in the transformation of healthy neurons into sick neurons in AD. 
The mechanism behind this phenomenon depends on intracellular Tau and is linked 
to changes in chromatin structure, nucleocytoplasmic transport, and gene 
transcription. This review highlights the vital roles of nuclear Tau protein in 
the context of nuclear pore complex functioning and, modulation of nuclear 
speckles in Alzheimer's diseases. Addressing these pathways is essential for 
formulating focused therapeutics intended to alleviate Tau-induced 
neurodegeneration.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, marked by 
progressive brain degeneration and cognitive decline. A major pathological 
feature of AD is the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) in the form 
of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which leads to neuronal death and 
neurodegeneration. P-tau also induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and 
activates the unfolded protein response, causing inflammation and apoptosis. 
Additionally, p-tau spreads in the brain through interactions with heparan 
sulfate (HS) proteoglycans, promoting aggregation and internalization. Targeting 
the tau-HS interaction offers a potential therapeutic strategy for AD. We 
present a novel HS mimetic with a lipophilic oleanolic acid linker and a 
sulfated trisaccharide, which shows strong cytoprotective effects against p-tau. 
Moreover, this compound alleviates p-tau-induced ER stress and inflammation. 
Molecular docking studies indicate that the conjugation of oleanolic acid 
enhances binding between the ligand and tau protofilament cores, facilitating 
protective interactions. These findings provide a foundation for the development 
of novel HS mimetics, enabling further investigation of tau-HS interactions in 
AD and other tauopathies.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), the leading cause of dementia, significantly impacts 
global public health, with cases expected to exceed 150 million by 2050. 
Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), predominantly influenced by the APOE-ε4 
allele, exhibits complex pathogenesis involving amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, 
neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), neuroinflammation, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) 
disruption. Proteomics has emerged as a pivotal technology in uncovering 
molecular mechanisms and identifying biomarkers for early diagnosis and 
intervention in AD. This paper reviews the genetic and molecular roles of 
APOE-ε4 in the pathology of AD, including its effects on Aβ aggregation, tau 
phosphorylation, neuroinflammation, and BBB integrity. Additionally, it 
highlights recent advances in serum proteomics, revealing APOE-ε4-dependent and 
independent protein signatures with potential as early biomarkers for AD. 
Despite technological progress, challenges such as population diversity, 
standardization, and distinguishing AD-specific biomarkers remain. Directions 
for future research emphasize multicenter longitudinal studies, multi-omics 
integration, and the clinical translation of proteomic findings to enable early 
detection of AD and personalized treatment strategies. Proteomics advances in AD 
research hold the promise of improving patient outcomes and reducing the global 
disease burden.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized as a neurodegenerative disorder that 
is caused by plaque formation by accumulating β-amyloid (Aβ), leading to 
neurocognitive function and impaired mental development. Thus, targeting Aβ 
represents a promising target for the development of therapeutics in AD 
management. Several functionalized sulfonic acid molecules have been reported, 
including tramiprosate prodrug, which is currently in clinical trial III and 
exhibits a good response in mild to moderate AD patients. Therefore, expanding 
upon this approach, we hypothesized that the sulfonic acid functionalized 
aromatic class molecule might demonstrate a good inhibitory effect against 
β-amyloid aggregation, leading to a decrease in the progression burden of AD. We 
used computational and in vitro approaches to establish effective compounds. As 
a result, three potent hit molecules were selected based on binding score as 
well as availability. In the case of safety profile of compounds, in vitro using 
human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells and in vivo using C. elegans was performed at 
doses up to 500 μM; no difference in viability was exhibited between control and 
treatment groups. However, H2O2-induced ROS stress was significantly reduced in 
neuroblastoma cells after treatment. The AFM and ThT-embedded β-amyloid1-42 
kinetic studies confirmed B-PEA-MBSA and H-HPA-NSA potency. H-HPA-NSA arrested 
elongation phase of Aβ aggregation in kinetic study at a lower concentration 
(10 μM), while B-PEA-MBSA reduced the intensity of stationary phase at a dose of 
100 μM. Thus, based on the outcomes, it can be suggested that B-PEA-MBSA and 
H-HPA-NSA can prevent β-amyloid aggregation with mild to moderate AD.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Peripartum mood and anxiety disorders constitute the 
most frequent form of maternal morbidity in the general population, but little 
is known about peripartum mental illness in mothers with multiple sclerosis 
(MS). We compared the incidence and prevalence of peripartum mental illness 
among mothers with MS, epilepsy, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and diabetes 
and women without these conditions.
METHODS: Using linked population-based administrative health data from ON, 
Canada, we conducted a cohort study of mothers with MS, epilepsy, IBD, and 
diabetes and without these diseases (comparators) who had a live birth with 
index dates, defined as 1 year before conception, between 2002 and 2017. Using 
validated definitions, we estimated the incidence and prevalence of mental 
illness (any, depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, psychosis, substance use, 
suicide attempt) during the prenatal (PN) period (from conception to birth) and 
3 years postpartum. We compared incidence and prevalence estimates between 
cohorts using simple incidence ratios (IRs) and prevalence ratios with 95% CIs 
and using Poisson regression models adjusting for confounders.
RESULTS: We included 894,852 mothers (1,745 with MS; 5,954 with epilepsy; 4,924 
with IBD; 13,002 with diabetes; 869,227 comparators). At conception, the mean 
(SD) maternal age was 28.6 (5.7) years. Any incident mental illness affected 
8.4% of mothers with MS prenatally and 14.2% during the first postpartum year; 
depression and anxiety were the most common incident disorders. The first 
postpartum year was a higher risk period than the PN period (any mental illness 
IR 1.27; 95% CI 1.08-1.50). After adjustment, mothers with MS had an increased 
incidence of any mental illness during the PN (IR 1.26; 95% CI 1.11-1.44) and 
postpartum (IR 1.33; 95% CI 1.20-1.47, first postpartum year) periods than 
comparator mothers. Similarly, mothers with MS had an increased incidence of all 
specific mental illnesses except suicide attempt during the PN period vs 
comparator mothers. Any prevalent mental illness affected 42% of mothers with MS 
prenatally and 50.3% in the first postpartum year.
DISCUSSION: Mothers with MS had an elevated incidence and prevalence of 
peripartum mental illness compared with comparator mothers, although residual 
confounding cannot be excluded. These findings emphasize the need for preventive 
interventions and early treatment of mental illness.

IMPORTANCE: Baseline cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) and APOE ε4 allele copy number 
are important risk factors for amyloid-related imaging abnormalities in patients 
with Alzheimer disease (AD) receiving therapies to lower amyloid-β plaque 
levels.
OBJECTIVE: To provide prevalence estimates of any, no more than 4, or fewer than 
2 CMBs in association with amyloid status, APOE ε4 copy number, and age.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study used data included 
in the Amyloid Biomarker Study data pooling initiative (January 1, 2012, to the 
present [data collection is ongoing]). Data from 15 research and memory clinic 
studies were pooled and harmonized. Participants included individuals for whom 
data on age, cognitive status, amyloid status, and presence of CMBs were 
available. Data were analyzed from October 22, 2023, to April 26, 2024.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcomes were age, cognitive status, 
amyloid status and presence, location, and number of CMBs. Presence of amyloid 
pathology was determined based on 42 amino acid-long form of amyloid-β peptide 
(Aβ42) levels in cerebrospinal fluid or on amyloid-positron emission tomography. 
Presence and, in a subset, location (lobar vs deep) and number of CMBs were 
determined on magnetic resonance imaging (locally with visual rating).
RESULTS: Among 4080 participants included in the analysis, the mean (SD) age was 
66.5 (8.9) years, and 2241 (54.9%) were female. A total of 2973 participants had 
no cognitive impairment (cognitive unimpairment [CU]), and 1107 had mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD dementia (ADD). One thousand five hundred and 
thirteen participants (37.1%) had amyloid pathology, 1368 of 3599 (38.0%) with 
data available were APOE ε4 carriers, and 648 (15.9%) had CMBs. In the CU group, 
amyloid pathology and APOE ε4 copy number were not associated with presence of 
any, no more than 4, or fewer than 2 CMBs but were associated with increased 
odds of lobar CMBs (odds ratio [OR] for amyloid, 1.42 [95% CI, 1.20-1.69], P < 
.001; OR for 2 vs 0 alleles, 1.81 [95% CI, 1.19-2.74], P = .006; OR for 1 vs 0 
alleles, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.83-1.46], P = .49; and OR for 2 vs 1 allele, 1.64 [95% 
CI, 0.90-2.97], P = .11; overall P = .02). In the MCI-ADD group, amyloid 
pathology was associated with presence of any CMBs (OR, 1.51 [95% CI, 
1.17-1.96], P = .002), no more than 4 CMBs (OR, 1.44 [95% CI, 1.18-1.82], P = 
.002), and fewer than 2 CMBs (OR 1.34 [95% CI, 1.03-1.74], P = .03) but not 
lobar CMBs. APOE ε4 copy number was associated with presence of any (OR for 2 vs 
0 alleles, 1.72 [95% CI, 0.88-3.35], P = .11; OR for 1 vs 0 alleles, 0.78 [95% 
CI, 0.59-1.04], P = .09; and OR for 2 vs 1 allele, 2.20 [95% CI, 1.32-3.67], 
P = .002; overall P < .001) and no more than 4 CMBs (OR for 2 vs 0 alleles, 1.31 
[95% CI, 0.64-2.68], P = .45; OR for 1 vs 0 alleles, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.54-1.04], 
P = .08; and OR for 2 vs 1 allele, 1.76 [95% CI, 0.97-3.19], P = .06; overall 
P = .03) but not with fewer than 2 or lobar CMBs. Prevalence estimates of CMBs 
ranged from 6% at 50 years of age in a non-APOE ε4 allele carrier with no 
amyloid pathology and no cognitive impairment to 52% at 90 years of age in an 
APOE ε4 homozygote carrier with amyloid pathology and cognitive impairment.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study of 4080 participants, 
prevalence estimates of CMBs were associated with amyloid status, APOE ε4 copy 
number, and age. CMB prevalence estimates may help inform safety evaluations for 
antiamyloid clinical trials.

IMPORTANCE: Depressive symptoms are associated with cognitive decline in older 
individuals. Uncertainty about underlying mechanisms hampers diagnostic and 
therapeutic efforts. This large-scale study aimed to elucidate the association 
between depressive symptoms and amyloid pathology.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between depressive symptoms and amyloid 
pathology and its dependency on age, sex, education, and APOE genotype in older 
individuals without dementia.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional analyses were performed using 
data from the Amyloid Biomarker Study data pooling initiative. Data from 49 
research, population-based, and memory clinic studies were pooled and 
harmonized. The Amyloid Biomarker Study has been collecting data since 2012 and 
data collection is ongoing. At the time of analysis, 95 centers were included in 
the Amyloid Biomarker Study. The study included 9746 individuals with normal 
cognition (NC) and 3023 participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) aged 
between 34 and 100 years for whom data on amyloid biomarkers, presence of 
depressive symptoms, and age were available. Data were analyzed from December 
2022 to February 2024.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Amyloid-β1-42 levels in cerebrospinal fluid or 
amyloid positron emission tomography scans were used to determine presence or 
absence of amyloid pathology. Presence of depressive symptoms was determined on 
the basis of validated depression rating scale scores, evidence of a current 
clinical diagnosis of depression, or self-reported depressive symptoms.
RESULTS: In individuals with NC (mean [SD] age, 68.6 [8.9] years; 5664 [58.2%] 
female; 3002 [34.0%] APOE ε4 carriers; 937 [9.6%] had depressive symptoms; 2648 
[27.2%] had amyloid pathology), the presence of depressive symptoms was not 
associated with amyloid pathology (odds ratio [OR], 1.13; 95% CI, 0.90-1.40; 
P = .29). In individuals with MCI (mean [SD] age, 70.2 [8.7] years; 1481 [49.0%] 
female; 1046 [44.8%] APOE ε4 carriers; 824 [27.3%] had depressive symptoms; 1668 
[55.8%] had amyloid pathology), the presence of depressive symptoms was 
associated with a lower likelihood of amyloid pathology (OR, 0.73; 95% CI 
0.61-0.89; P = .001). When considering subgroup effects, in individuals with NC, 
the presence of depressive symptoms was associated with a higher frequency of 
amyloid pathology in APOE ε4 noncarriers (mean difference, 5.0%; 95% CI 1.0-9.0; 
P = .02) but not in APOE ε4 carriers. This was not the case in individuals with 
MCI.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Depressive symptoms were not consistently associated 
with a higher frequency of amyloid pathology in participants with NC and were 
associated with a lower likelihood of amyloid pathology in participants with 
MCI. These findings were not influenced by age, sex, or education level. 
Mechanisms other than amyloid accumulation may commonly underlie depressive 
symptoms in late life.

Volatile oils (VOs), synonymously termed essential oils (EOs), are highly 
hydrophobic liquids obtained from aromatic plants, containing diverse organic 
compounds for example terpenes and terpenoids. These oils exhibit significant 
neuroprotective properties, containing antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, 
anti-apoptotic, glutamate activation, cholinesterase inhibitory action, and 
anti-protein aggregatory action, making them potential therapeutic agents in 
managing neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). VOs regulate glutamate activation, 
enhance synaptic plasticity, and inhibit oxidative stress through the 
stimulation of antioxidant enzymes. They also reduce inflammation by inhibiting 
key inflammatory mediators and enzymes. Furthermore, VOs prevent neuronal 
apoptosis by modulating apoptosis-related proteins and caspases. Their 
anti-protein aggregation potential helps mitigate the accumulation of misfolded 
proteins, a hallmark of neurodegenerative disorders. Additionally, VOs inhibit 
cholinesterase enzymes, increasing acetylcholine levels, and improving neuronal 
communication. In addition to their neuroprotective action, it also exerts some 
toxic effects, such as genotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, embryotoxicity, 
and hypersensitivity, which are most commonly caused by the presence of 
monoterpenes in the volatile oils. This review examines the diverse functions of 
vasoactive oxidants (VOs) in neuroprotection, underscoring their therapeutic 
promise for various neurological conditions, with a particular emphasis on 
Alzheimer's disease.

Apigenin, a dietary flavonoid with notable anti-cancer properties, has emerged 
as a promising candidate for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders, 
particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD). While extensively studied for its ability 
to modulate key molecular pathways in cancers, apigenin also exerts 
neuroprotective effects by reducing neuroinflammation, protecting neurons from 
oxidative stress, and enhancing neuronal survival and synaptic plasticity. This 
dual functionality makes apigenin an intriguing therapeutic option for diseases 
like AD, where kinase dysregulation plays a central role. In this study, we 
focus on Microtubule Affinity-Regulating Kinase 4 (MARK4), a key enzyme 
implicated in tauopathies associated with AD, as well as in cancer progression. 
Through in silico analysis, we explore the interaction between apigenin and 
MARK4, revealing significant structural changes within the kinase domain upon 
ligand binding. These computational findings were confirmed via experimental 
assays using purified recombinant MARK4, where apigenin demonstrated potent 
inhibition with an IC50 value of 2.39 µM. Fluorescence binding assays further 
confirmed a strong binding affinity (Ka = 108 M-1), indicating that apigenin 
efficiently occupies the MARK4 active site, thereby suppressing its enzymatic 
activity. These results position apigenin as a potent inhibitor of MARK4, 
offering a dual therapeutic advantage-both as an anti-cancer agent and as a 
neuroprotective compound for the potential treatment of AD. This study opens new 
avenues for the development of apigenin-based therapeutics targeting kinase 
dysregulation in cancer and neurodegeneration.

BACKGROUND: Background: This study investigates the effects of cognitive 
interventions on executive functions and attention in patients with moderate 
Alzheimer's, comparing traditional and technology-based methods with a control 
group.
METHOD: A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 112 participants, 
divided into three groups: traditional intervention, technology-based 
intervention, and control group. Sixteen sessions were carried out, assessed 
using standardized tests and applying hierarchical linear mixed models to adjust 
for confounding factors and random effects.
RESULTS: The interventions proved effective in improving executive functions. 
The model for backward digits and categorical fluency was optimized with MMSE 
scores, highlighting the benefits of good cognitive performance and the negative 
impacts of age on categorical fluency. The similarity-abstraction variable 
demonstrated the beneficial effects of education and cognitive performance.
CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive training is a valuable tool for improving executive 
functions and attention in moderate Alzheimer's, indicating significant 
practical benefits. Future research should focus on the mechanisms of skill 
transfer to optimize interventions and improve the quality of life for those 
affected.

INTRODUCTION: Mitochondrial dysfunction stands as a pivotal feature in 
neurodegenerative disorders, spurring the quest for targeted therapeutic 
interventions. This review examines Ubiquitin-Specific Protease 30 (USP30) as a 
master regulator of mitophagy with therapeutic promise in Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). USP30's orchestration of mitophagy pathways, 
encompassing PINK1-dependent and PINK1-independent mechanisms, forms the crux of 
this exploration.
METHOD: A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, and Web 
of Science, selecting studies that investigated USP's function, inhibitor 
design, or therapeutic efficacy in AD and PD. Inclusion criteria encompassed 
mechanistic and preclinical/clinical data, while irrelevant or duplicate 
references were excluded. Extracted findings were synthesized narratively.
RESULTS: USP30 modulates interactions with translocase of outer mitochondrial 
membrane (TOM) 20, mitochondrial E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1 (MUL1), and 
Parkin, thus harmonizing mitochondrial quality control. Emerging novel USP30 
inhibitors, racemic phenylalanine derivatives, N-cyano pyrrolidine, and notably, 
benzosulphonamide class compounds, restore mitophagy, and reduce 
neurodegenerative phenotypes across diverse models with minimal off-target 
effects. Modulation of other USPs also influences neurodegenerative disease 
pathways, offering additional therapeutic avenues.
CONCLUSIONS: In highlighting the nuanced regulation of mitophagy by USP30, this 
work heralds a shift toward more precise and effective treatments, paving the 
way for a new era in the clinical management of neurodegenerative disorders.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Recent advancements in molecular biomarkers and therapeutic 
options for Alzheimer's disease have brought into focus the need for greater 
progress in the second most common cause of dementia, vascular cognitive 
impairment and dementia (VCID). We examine how the study of monogenic causes of 
VCID has contributed to the understanding of its pathophysiology and potential 
biomarker and treatment research.
RECENT FINDINGS: It is widely accepted that conditions which disrupt the 
cerebral small vessels contribute to vascular pathologies including stroke and 
cerebral microbleeds, ultimately leading to vascular cognitive impairment and 
dementia. Among these conditions are a range of monogenic small vessel diseases 
(SVDs) such as CADASIL, CARASIL, Fabry disease and COL4A-related disorders.
SUMMARY: This review indicates the importance of furthering research into 
monogenic SVDs in order to gain insight into the pathomechanisms of VCID more 
broadly. Monogenic conditions are easier to model than sporadic VCID and can 
serve as a guide for identifying biomarkers for diagnosis, monitoring and 
intervention outcomes.

SCOPE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia, lack of 
effective therapeutic interventions. In this study, we investigate the impact of 
intermittent fasting (IF), an alternative strategy of calorie restriction, on 
cognitive functions and AD-like pathology in a transgenic mouse model of AD.
METHODS AND RESULTS: APP/PS1 mice at 6 months were randomly allocated to two 
dietary groups: one receiving ad libitum (AL) feeding and the other undergoing 
IF for 1 month. Y maze, Barnes maze, western blotting, and immunofluorescence 
were employed. Behavioral assessments revealed that the APP/PS1-IF group 
demonstrated notable improvements in cognitive function compared to the AL 
group. Further analysis showed that microglia in the APP/PS1-IF mice exhibited 
enhanced phagocytic activity, characterized by prominent enlargement of soma and 
reduced complexity of their processes. Importantly, IF significantly decreased 
the accumulation of lipid droplets (LDs) within microglia. These microglia with 
less LDs may contribute to enhanced β-amyloid (Aβ) phagocytosis, thereby 
ameliorating Aβ deposition in the brains of APP/PS1-IF mice.
CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that IF ameliorates amyloid deposition and 
cognitive deficits in the AD model mice, which is associated with the reduction 
of LDs within microglia, providing support for the use of the dietary 
intervention against AD pathology.

The growing prevalence of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an increasing public 
health concern that led to French recommendations for timely AD diagnosis and 
patient management as well as a territorial coverage of specialized structures 
[Memory Centers including Resources and Memory Research Centers (RMRC) and 
Memory Consultations (MC)]. In view of the potential availability of Disease 
Modifying Therapies (DMTs), this French observatory aimed to describe the 
current organization of the Memory Centers, and the care pathway of patients 
suffering from early AD. Overall, 12 of the 28 RMRC and 44 of the 250 MC 
solicited by the Federation of Memory Centers participated in this study. RMRC 
and MC differed in the practicing specialists (neurologists in 100 % and 41 % of 
the structures, respectively; geriatricians in 58 % and 95 %), and in the median 
yearly number of patients with early AD (192 and 99). The majority of patients 
were referred to RMRC and MC by a general practitioner (42 % and 51 %, 
respectively) or a private neurologist (19 % and 6 %). The time between referral 
and the first visit to the Memory Center was shorter in MC compared to RMRC 
(<3 months: 51 % versus 34 %). Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers were assessed in 
the majority of patients in 75 % of RMRC and 14 % of MC. A care plan was 
proposed for the majority of patients whatever the Memory Center was (RMRC: 
91 %, MC: 84 %) unlike psychological support (21 % and 29 %, respectively) and 
therapeutic education (14 % and 9 %). According to more than 2/3 of the RMRC the 
referral delays, the number of patients with early AD, and the monitoring 
schedule (including MRIs and clinical assessments) will be very impacted by the 
potential availability of DMTs. A similar impact was only perceived by around 
half of the MC. This study highlighted the key challenges raised by these new 
therapies.

BACKGROUND: Cardiometabolic disorders may accelerate the progression of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), potentially impacting ethnic-racial groups with a 
higher prevalence of diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease, though 
limited data exists on Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders (NHPI) 
populations.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the prevalence of diabetes and associated 
comorbidities among AD patients from different ethnic-racial groups - Asians, 
Whites, and NHPIs - in Hawaii, with a focus on identifying risk factors linked 
to AD.
METHOD: A retrospective review was conducted on AD patient records from a single 
center in Hawaii, spanning June 2018 to June 2024. Variables assessed included 
age at diagnosis, sex, race, insurance type, alcohol use, comorbidities, and 
Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. Statistical comparisons were 
conducted to identify group differences.
RESULTS: Among 540 patients (256 Asians, 89 NHPIs, 182 Whites, and 13 Others), 
NHPIs exhibited the highest rates of hypertension (66.3%), diabetes (31.5%), 
obesity (23.6%), congestive heart failure (13.5%), and coronary artery disease 
(6.7%). Whites exhibited a higher prevalence of anxiety (18.1%), cardiac 
arrhythmia (15.4%), and alcohol use (37.4%) compared to Asians and NHPIs. 
Females had lower mean MMSE scores compared to males (18.3 ± 7.4 vs. 21.0 ± 6.2, 
respectively), along with higher rates of anxiety (16.3%), hypertension (62.2%), 
hyperlipidemia (47.4%), and underweight body mass index (10.8%).
CONCLUSION: NHPI AD patients in Hawaii face a higher prevalence of diabetes and 
a greater burden of cardiometabolic disorders compared to other racial groups. 
White AD patients demonstrate higher rates of anxiety, alcohol consumption, and 
cardiac arrhythmia compared to Asians and NHPIs. Females with AD had worse 
cognitive function compared to males.

Atrial fibrillation and heart failure have both been suggested to increase 
stroke and dementia risk. However, in observational studies, reversed causation 
and unmeasured confounding may occur. To mitigate these issues, this study aims 
to investigate if higher genetic risk for atrial fibrillation and heart failure 
increases dementia and stroke risk. Data were obtained from the population-based 
Gothenburg H70 Birth Cohort Studies in Sweden. Participants (N = 984) were born 
in 1930 with baseline examinations at age 70, 75, 79 or 85 and follow-ups until 
age 88-89. Polygenic risk scores at the 5 × 10-8, 1 × 10-5, 1 × 10-3 and 1 × 
10-1 thresholds were generated for atrial fibrillation and heart failure. Stroke 
was diagnosed based on self-reports, close-informant interviews, and the 
National Patient Register. Dementia was diagnosed based on neuropsychiatric 
examinations, close-informant interviews, and the National Patient Register. Cox 
regression analyses were performed, adjusted for sex, age at baseline and the 
first five principal components to correct for population stratification. Those 
within the highest atrial fibrillation-polygenic risk score tertile had a 1.5 
(95% CI 1.09-2.03) increased risk of dementia (at the 1 × 10-5 threshold) and a 
1.5 (95% CI 1.07-2.03) increased risk of stroke (at the 1 × 10-3 threshold) 
compared to the lowest tertile. Those within the highest heart failure-polygenic 
risk score tertile had a 1.6 (95% CI 1.19-2.27) increased risk of dementia (at 
the 5 × 10-8 threshold), but no increased risk of stroke (HR 1.2; 95% CI 
0.83-1.60 at the 1 × 10-5 threshold), compared to the lowest tertile. When 
analysing the polygenic risk scores as a continuous variable, the associations 
were in the same direction, although weaker. This study, investigating genetic 
risk of atrial fibrillation and heart failure in relation to stroke and 
dementia, supports the increasing body of evidence suggesting that atrial 
fibrillation is associated with both stroke and dementia risk. Whether heart 
failure increases dementia risk is less established, but the present study found 
that genetic risk of heart failure increased dementia risk. The finding that 
genetic risk for heart failure did not increase stroke risk needs to be 
interpreted with caution, as it may be due to a lack of statistical power. There 
are guidelines on how to best treat atrial fibrillation to prevent stroke, but 
more knowledge is needed on how to treat atrial fibrillation and heart failure 
to prevent dementia.

INTRODUCTION: After Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration 
(FTLD) is the second most common form of early-onset dementia. Despite the heavy 
burden of care for FTLD, pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments with 
sufficient efficacy remain scarce. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility 
of a multimodal exercise program for FTLD and to examine preliminary changes in 
the clinical outcomes of the program in FTLD.
METHODS: This single-arm preliminary study was conducted from July 2017 to July 
2018 and recruited 4 male patients with FTLD aged 60-78 years. Patients 
exercised under the supervision of an exercise instructor once every 2 weeks for 
48 weeks. The multimodal exercise program comprised cognitive training, 
moderate-intensity continuous training, strength training, balance training, and 
flexibility and relaxation training. Feasibility was measured using dropout and 
attendance rates. Cognitive, psychological, physical, and behavioral function 
tests were conducted before and after the intervention.
RESULTS: All patients completed the intervention (100%) and attended well 
(93.6%). Positive changes in scores in the Stroop Color-Word Test (cognitive; 5 
out of 6 items), Mood Check List-short form 2 (psychological), movement 
subscales of the Stereotypy Rating Inventory (behavioral), and Timed Up and Go 
(TUG, physical) assessments demonstrated a medium-to-high effect size (open 
effect size: 0.52-0.97). While there were improvements in some domains, such as 
recovery self-efficacy and exercise efficacy, the MMSE-J scores showed an 
overall slight decline, especially in the semantic dementia case where a marked 
decrease was observed. Additionally, three physical function items showed no 
effect, except for a positive outcome in the TUG test. Functional near-infrared 
spectroscopy revealed increased activation in the frontal lobe, indicated by 
elevated oxygenated hemoglobin levels before and after the exercise 
intervention. This pattern of activation suggests that the intervention may have 
stimulated neural activity in the frontal lobe, potentially enhancing cognitive 
and behavioral functions, including executive function and attention.
CONCLUSION: The long-term multimodal exercise intervention may be feasible and 
positively change the cognitive, psychological, physical, and behavioral 
functions in older adults with FTLD. Although the intervention led to 
improvements in certain areas, there were also declines observed in various 
functions, which may not necessarily be due to the intervention itself but 
rather reflect the natural progression of the disease.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder, with 
amyloid-beta (Aβ) aggregation playing a key role in its pathogenesis. Aβ-induced 
oxidative stress leads to neuronal damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, and 
apoptosis, making antioxidative strategies promising for AD treatment. This 
study investigates the effects of hydrogen-rich water (HRW) in a zebrafish AD 
model. Zebrafish were exposed to aluminum chloride to induce AD-like pathology 
and then treated with HRW using a nanobubble device. Behavioral assays, ELISA, 
Hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) and 
neutrophil fluorescence labeling were employed to assess HRW's impact. 
Additionally, 16S rRNA sequencing analyzed HRW's effect on gut microbiota. HRW 
can significantly improve cognitive impairment and depression-like behavior in 
zebrafish AD model, reduce Aβ deposition (p < 0.0001), regulate liver Soluble 
epoxide hydrolase (sEH) levels (p < 0.05), reduce neuroinflammation, and reduce 
oxidative stress. Furthermore, HRW reduced the number of harmful bacteria linked 
to AD pathology by restoring the balance of microbiota in the gut. These 
findings suggest that HRW has potential as a therapeutic strategy for AD by 
targeting oxidative stress, inflammation, and gut-brain axis modulation.

Bipolar disorder (BD) is a prevalent mood disorder characterized by alternating 
episodes of depression and mania, often accompanied by varying degrees of 
cognitive impairment. Cognitive impairments often serve as indicators of a bleak 
prognosis or the likelihood of progressing to dementia. Additionally, some 
studies suggest that individuals diagnosed with BD may undergo a decline in 
hippocampal volume. However, the potential for reversibility of these changes, 
particularly in adolescents, remains unclear. We present an intriguing case 
involving an 18-year-old male student who experiences concurrent occurrences of 
both BD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), accompanied by a subtle reduction 
in hippocampal volume. Initially, the individual exhibited impaired general 
cognitive function, as indicated by an IQ score of 80 on the Standard Raven's 
Progressive Matrices test, and demonstrated slightly reduced bilateral 
hippocampal volume compared to the normative reference, as determined through 
quantitative structural magnetic resonance imaging (qsMRI). The deposition 
profiles of amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide in the brain were not identified with 
18F-AV45 PET/MRI. Following six months of combined psychopharmacological 
treatment and cognitive behavioral therapy, the individual's psychopathological 
symptoms improved significantly, leading to a restoration of his IQ score to 116 
and normalization of hippocampal volume. This case suggests that the hippocampal 
volume reduction and cognitive impairment seen in some adolescents with BD may 
demonstrate greater plasticity compared to neurodegenerative conditions such as 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). These findings highlight the potential importance of 
early intervention in young BD patients with cognitive impairments.

ABSTRACT: Recent clinical trials on slowing dementia progression have led to 
renewed focus on finding safer, more effective treatments. One approach to 
identify plausible candidates is to assess whether existing medications for 
other conditions may affect dementia risk. We conducted a systematic review to 
identify studies adopting a data-driven approach to investigate the association 
between a wide range of prescribed medications and dementia risk. We included 14 
studies using administrative or medical records data for more than 130 million 
individuals and 1 million dementia cases. Despite inconsistencies in identifying 
specific drugs that may modify Alzheimer's or dementia risk, some themes emerged 
for drug classes with biological plausibility. Antimicrobials, vaccinations, and 
anti-inflammatories were associated with reduced risk, while diabetes drugs, 
vitamins and supplements, and antipsychotics were associated with increased 
risk. We found conflicting evidence for antihypertensives and antidepressants. 
Drug repurposing for use in dementia is an urgent priority. Our findings offer a 
basis for prioritizing candidates and exploring underlying mechanisms.
HIGHLIGHTS: ·We present a systematic review of studies reporting association 
between drugs prescribed for other conditions and risk of dementia including 139 
million people and 1 million cases of dementia.·Our work supports some 
previously reported associations, for example, showing decreased risk of 
dementia with drugs to treat inflammatory disease and increased risk with 
antipsychotic treatment.·Antimicrobial treatment was perhaps more surprisingly 
associated with decreased risk, supportive of recent increased interest in this 
potential therapeutic avenue.·Our work should help prioritize drugs for entry 
into adaptive platform trials in Alzheimer's disease and will serve as a useful 
resource for those investigating drugs or classes of drugs and risk of dementia.

Perspective: Minimally clinically important "symptomatic" benefit associated 
with disease modification resulting from anti-amyloid immunotherapy.

Despite some skepticism regarding the amyloid hypothesis, there is growing 
evidence that clearing amyloid by targeting specific species of amyloid (plaque, 
oligomers, fibrils, and protofibrils) for removal has therapeutic benefits. 
Specifically, there is growing evidence that, in mild cognitive impairment and 
mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD), robust and aggressive removal of 
amyloid can slow cognitive decline as measured by global instruments, composite 
measures, and cognitive testing. Furthermore, clinical efficacy signals coupled 
with clear biomarker changes provide the first evidence of disease modification. 
This effect seems to be in addition to symptomatic treatments and opens 
speculation that the effect of anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies might be 
clinically meaningful through symptomatic amelioration that is a result of 
disease modification.
HIGHLIGHTS: Clearance of brain amyloid plaques may lead to a clinical benefit in 
patients with early AD.Aggregated Aβ may play a role in both disease expression

BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial dysfunction is increasingly recognized as a key factor 
in neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), underscoring the therapeutic potential of 
targeting mitochondria-related genes. This study aimed to identify novel 
biomarkers and drug targets for these diseases through a comprehensive analysis 
that integrated genome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) with genes associated 
with mitochondrial function.
METHODS: Using existing publicly available genome-wide association studies 
(GWAS) summary statistics and comprehensive data on 1136 mitochondria-related 
genes, we initially identified a subset of genes related to mitochondrial 
function that exhibited significant associations with NDDs. We then conducted 
colocalization and summary-data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) analyses 
using expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) to validate the causal role of 
these candidate genes. Additionally, we assessed the druggability of the encoded 
proteins to prioritize potential therapeutic targets for further exploration.
RESULTS: Genetically predicted levels of 10 genes were found to be significantly 
associated with the risk of NDDs. Elevated DMPK and LACTB2 levels were 
associated with increased Alzheimer's disease risk. Higher expression of 
NDUFAF2, BCKDK, and MALSU1, along with lower TTC19, raised Parkinson's disease 
risk. Higher ACLY levels were associated with both amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
and multiple sclerosis (MS) risks, while decreased MCL1, TOP3A, and VWA8 levels 
raised MS risk. These genes primarily impact mitochondrial function and energy 
metabolism. Notably, several druggable protein targets identified are being 
explored for potential NDDs treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: This data-driven MR study demonstrated the causal role of 
mitochondrial dysfunction in NDDs. Additionally, this study identified candidate 
genes that could serve as potential pharmacological targets for the prevention 
and treatment of NDDs. © 2025 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder

OBJECTIVES: Examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effects of 
the Telephone Acceptance and Commitment Therapy Intervention for Caregivers 
(TACTICs) on dementia caregivers' anxiety, depression, caregiver burden, 
suffering, and anticipatory grief.
METHOD: A 2-arm pilot randomized trial with dementia caregivers ≥ 21 years old 
with clinically elevated anxiety or anxiety-related functional interference. Two 
cohorts were recruited at the beginning and end of the first year of the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Intervention participants received 6 telephone sessions 
delivered by a non-licensed interventionist and control participants received 
readings and a list of dementia caregiver support groups in their area. Outcomes 
were measured at baseline, post-intervention, and at 3 and 6 months. Feasibility 
was measured by enrollment rates, completion rates, and adherence to TACTICs by 
interventionists. Acceptability was measured with participant satisfaction 
surveys.
RESULTS: TACTICs was feasible and acceptable with 96% enrollment, 98.6% 
adherence, 65.5% completion, and a mean satisfaction score of 9.35 out of 10 (SD 
0.91). The TACTICs group showed clinically relevant reductions in anxiety 
post-intervention (SRM 4.1, 95% CI [2.4,5.8]), however reductions were not 
significantly different from the control group (p = 0.98).
CONCLUSION: Implementation of TACTICs during the COVID-19 pandemic was feasible 
and acceptable. The preliminary outcomes were not as strong as expected. The 
results will inform the design of future trials with larger samples.

With population aging, dementia has become a significant global health issue. 
Most people with dementia live in the community, are cared for by family 
members, and face complex and multifaceted care challenges. In line with 
Taiwan's Long-Term Care 2.0 policy, the Integrated Dementia Care Centers now 
established in many hospitals and linked with dementia clinic systems at the 
local level provide home care consultations and referrals. However, the primary 
focus of these centers remains on basic health education and post-diagnosis 
resource referral services. Thus, they lack an interdisciplinary approach, 
making it difficult to offer tailored, integrated care for people with dementia 
and their families. Therefore, integrating care intervention strategies from 
various fields to provide tailored and continuous care services is important. 
This article explores existing domestic and international dementia care 
consultation modules, introduces the integrated "Dementia Interdisciplinary Care 
Consultation Module" developed by our team, and discusses the applicability of 
and offers recommendations regarding this module. The developed module is 
intended to serve as a reference resource for outpatient medical staff and 
dementia case managers during health education consultations, and may be adopted 
into the training materials used by dementia care professionals and referenced 
in future domestic dementia care policy formulation work. The overall goal is to 
enhance the efficiency of outpatient dementia care consultations by ameliorating 
/ resolving issues such as resource fragmentation, poor coordination, and 
service overlap, thereby improving the quality of family care provided to people 
with dementia.

BACKGROUND: Plasmalogens, the primary phospholipids in the brain, possess 
intrinsic antioxidant properties and are crucial components of the myelin sheath 
surrounding neuronal axons. While their neuroprotective effects have been 
demonstrated in Alzheimer's disease, their potential benefits in spinal cord 
injury remain unexplored. This study investigates the reparative effects of 
plasmalogens on spinal cord injury and the underlying mechanisms.
METHODS: In vitro, we developed dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and RAW 264.7 cell 
models under high-reactive oxygen species (ROS) conditions to assess ROS levels, 
neuronal damage, and inflammatory microenvironment changes before and after 
plasmalogen application. In vivo, we used a complete mouse spinal cord 
transection model to evaluate changes in ROS levels, neuronal demyelination, and 
apoptosis following plasmalogen treatment. Additionally, we assessed sensory and 
motor function recovery and investigated the regulatory effects of plasmalogens 
on the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.
RESULTS: In high-ROS cell models, plasmalogens protected DRG neurons (TUJ-1) 
from axonal damage and modulated the proinflammatory/anti-inflammatory balance 
in RAW 264.7 cells. In vivo, plasmalogens significantly reduced ROS levels, 
improved the immune microenvironment, decreased the proinflammatory 
(iNOS)/anti-inflammatory (ARG-1) ratio, lowered neuronal (TUJ-1) apoptosis 
(Caspase-3, BAX), and reduced axonal degeneration while promoting myelin (MBP) 
regeneration, indicating a neuroprotective effect. These findings are linked to 
the activation of the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.
CONCLUSION: Plasmalogens reduce ROS levels and regulate inflammation-induced 
damage, contributing to neuroprotection. This study reveals that plasmalogens 
promote remyelination, reduce axonal degeneration and neuronal apoptosis, 
and-used here for the first time in spinal cord injury repair- may protect 
neurons by reducing ROS levels and activating the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.

BACKGROUND: Neurodegenerative diseases are a group of disorders characterized by 
progressive neuronal degeneration and death, of which Alzheimer's disease and 
Parkinson's disease are the most common. These diseases are closely associated 
with increased expression of monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B), an important enzyme 
that regulates neurotransmitter concentration, and its overactivity leads to 
oxidative stress and neurotoxicity, accelerating the progression of 
neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, the development of effective MAO-B 
inhibitors is important for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to improve the prediction of the efficacy of novel 
6-hydroxybenzothiazole- 2-carboxamide compounds in inhibiting MAO-B by improving 
the quantitative constitutive effect relationship (QSAR) modeling and to provide 
a theoretical basis for the discovery of novel neuroprotective drugs.
METHODS: The study first optimized the structures of 36 compounds using the 
heuristic method (HM) in CODESSA software to construct linear QSAR models. 
Subsequently, key descriptors were screened by using the gene expression 
programming (GEP) technique to generate nonlinear QSAR models and validate them.
RESULTS: The R², F-value, and R²cv of the linear model were 0.5724, 10.3752, and 
0.4557, respectively, whereas the nonlinear model constructed by the GEP 
algorithm showed higher prediction accuracies by achieving R² values of 0.89 and 
0.82, and mean squared errors (MSE) of 0.0799 and 0.1215 for the training and 
test sets, respectively. In addition, molecular docking experiments confirmed 
that the novel compound 31 was tightly bound to the MAO-B active site with 
significant inhibitory activity.
CONCLUSION: In this study, we successfully improved the prediction ability of 
the efficacy of novel 6-hydroxybenzothiazole-2-carboxamide compounds to inhibit 
MAO-B by improving the QSAR model. This not only provides new drug candidates 
for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, but also provides important 
theoretical guidance for subsequent drug design and development, which can help 
accelerate the process of new drug discovery and reduce the disease burden of 
patients.

BACKGROUND: For clinical implementation of Alzheimer's disease (AD) blood-based 
biomarkers (BBMs), knowledge of short-term variability, is crucial to ensure 
safe and correct biomarker interpretation, i.e., to capture changes or treatment 
effects that lie beyond that of expected short-term variability and considered 
clinically relevant. In this study we investigated short-term intra- and 
inter-individual variability of AD biomarkers in the intended use population, 
memory clinic patients.
METHODS: In a consecutive sample of memory clinic patients (AD n = 27, non-AD 
n = 20), blood samples were collected on three separate days within a period of 
36 days and analysed for plasma Aβ40, Aβ42, p-tau181, p-tau217, p-tau231, T-tau, 
neurofilament light (NfL), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). We 
measured intra- and inter-individual variability and explored if the variability 
could be affected by confounding factors. Secondly, we established the minimum 
change required to detect a difference between two given blood samples that 
exceeds intra-individual variability and analytical variation (reference change 
value, RCV). Finally, we tested if classification accuracy varied across the 
three visits.
RESULTS: Intra-individual variability ranged from ~ 3% (Aβ42/40) to ~ 12% 
(T-tau). Inter-individual variability ranged from ~ 7% (Aβ40) to ~ 39% (NfL). 
Adjusting the models for time, eGFR, Hba1c, and BMI did not affect the 
variation. RCV was lowest for Aβ42/Aβ40 (- ~ 15%/ + ~ 17%) and highest in 
p-tau181 (- ~ 30/ + ~ 42%). No variation in classification accuracies was found 
across visits.
CONCLUSION: We found low intra-individual variability, robust to various 
factors, appropriate to capture individual changes in AD BBMs, while moderate 
inter-individual variability may give rise to caution in diagnostic contexts. 
High RCVs may pose challenges for AD BBMs with low fold changes and 
consequently, short-term variability is important to take into consideration 
when, e.g., estimating intervention effect and longitudinal changes of AD BBM 
levels.

BACKGROUND: Intracerebral amyloid β (Aβ) accumulation is considered the initial 
observable event in the pathological process of Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Efficient screening for amyloid pathology is critical for identifying patients 
for early treatment. This study developed machine learning models to classify 
positron emission tomography (PET) Aβ-positivity in participants with 
preclinical and prodromal AD using data accessible to primary care physicians.
METHODS: This retrospective observational study assessed the classification 
performance of combinations of demographic characteristics, routine blood test 
results, and cognitive test scores to classify PET Aβ-positivity using machine 
learning. Participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or normal cognitive 
function who visited Oita University Hospital or had participated in the USUKI 
study and met the study eligibility criteria were included. The primary endpoint 
was assessment of the classification performance of the presence or absence of 
intracerebral Aβ accumulation using five machine learning models (i.e., five 
combinations of variables), each constructed with three classification 
algorithms, resulting in a total of 15 patterns. L2-regularized logistic 
regression, and kernel Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Elastic Net algorithms 
were used to construct the classification models using 34 pre-selected variables 
(12 demographic characteristics, 11 blood test results, 11 cognitive test 
results).
RESULTS: Data from 262 records (260 unique participants) were analyzed. The mean 
(standard deviation [SD]) participant age was 73.8 (7.8) years. Using 
L2-regularized logistic regression, the mean receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) area under the curve (AUC) (SD) in Model 0 (basic demographic 
characteristics) was 0.67 (0.01). Classification performance was similar in 
Model 1 (basic demographic characteristics and Mini Mental State Examination 
[MMSE] subscores) and Model 2 (demographic characteristics and blood test 
results) with a cross-validated mean ROC AUC (SD) of 0.70 (0.01) for both. Model 
3 (demographic characteristics, blood test results, MMSE subscores) and Model 4 
(Model 3 and ApoE4 phenotype) showed improved performance with a mean ROC AUC 
(SD) of 0.73 (0.01) and 0.76 (0.01), respectively. In models using blood test 
results, thyroid-stimulating hormone and mean corpuscular volume tended to be 
the largest contributors to classification. Classification performances were 
similar using the SVM and Elastic Net algorithms.
CONCLUSIONS: The machine learning models used in this study were useful for 
classifying PET Aβ-positivity using data from routine physician visits.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
ranging from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD dementia. Abnormal cerebral 
perfusion alterations, influenced by amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulations, have been 
implicated in cognitive decline along this spectrum.
OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the relationship between cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) Aβ1-42 levels and regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes across the AD 
continuum using the Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) technique.
METHODS: We analyzed data from 229 participants extracted from the ADNI cohort, 
comprising of 50 cognitively normal (CN), 13 subjective memory complaints (SMC), 
83 early MCI (EMCI), 52 late MCI (LMCI), and 31 AD participants with complete 
ASL and CSF data. Correlations between Aβ1-42 levels and regional mean CBF 
values were assessed. Multiple linear regression models accounted for 
confounders, including age, gender, and education level.
RESULTS: Preliminary unadjusted analyses revealed strong positive correlations 
between Aβ1-42 levels and CBF in multiple regions, predominantly in the AD 
group. After adjusting for confounders, significant correlations in AD 
participants emerged in the left pars triangularis and left caudal middle 
frontal cortex. In the LMCI group, significant associations were identified in 
the right lateral occipital cortex, right inferior parietal cortex, and left 
amygdala.
CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the critical role of Aβ-driven CBF 
alterations in regions associated with higher cognitive functions and suggest 
that these patterns may serve as potential biomarkers for diagnosing and 
monitoring disease progression.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative 
diseases. Given the multifactorial pathophysiology of AD, monotargeted agents 
can only alleviate symptoms but not cure AD. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and 
Monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) are two key targets in the treatment of AD, 
molecules that inhibiting both targets are considered promising avenue to 
develop more effective AD therapies. In the present work, a dual inhibition 
dataset containing 449 molecules was established, based on which five machine 
learning algorithms (KNN, SVM, RF, GBDT, and LGBM) four fingerprints (MACCS, 
ECFP4, RDKitFP, PubChemFP) and DRAGON descriptors were combined to develop 25 
classification models in which GBDT paired with ECFP4 and RF paired with 
PubchemFP achieved the same best performance across multiple metrics 
(Accuracy = 0.92, F1 Score = 0.94, MCC = 0.81). Moreover, based on the curated 
bioactivity datasets of AChE and MAO-B, regression models were developed to 
predict pIC50 values. For the AChE inhibition task, GBDT demonstrated the best 
performance (RMSE = 0.683, MAE = 0.500, R2 = 0.721). The SVM algorithm emerged 
as the most effective for MAO-B inhibition (RMSE = 0.668, MAE = 0.507, 
R2 = 0.675). The SHAP algorithm was used to interpret the optimal models, 
identifying and analyzing the key substructures and properties for both 
dual-target and single-target inhibitors. Moreover, molecules docking process 
provided potential mechanism and Structure-Activity Relationships (SAR) of 
dual-target inhibition further.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Despite their limited benefits and serious adverse 
effects, psychotropics remain frequently prescribed for neuropsychiatric 
symptoms (NPS) of dementia. Psychotropic polypharmacy, the use of two or more 
concomitant psychotropic medications, is therefore not recommended for people 
with dementia. The objectives of this study were to investigate the prevalence 
of psychotropic polypharmacy in Australians living with dementia whose 
caregivers sought external NPS support from Dementia Support Australia (DSA; the 
national provider of NPS support) and the association of psychotropic 
polypharmacy with their demographics and NPS characteristics.
METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study of a subset of DSA referrals at 
baseline (i.e., yet to receive psychosocial intervention(s)) between 2016 and 
2020 was conducted. Referrals with and without psychotropic polypharmacy were 
compared on the basis of demographic characteristics (e.g., sex, dementia 
subtype), NPS type (e.g., agitation), NPS severity and associated caregiver 
distress as measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), using Pearson's 
chi-square test and Welch's t-test for categorical and continuous data, 
respectively. Logistic regression models were used to examine the relationship 
between individual NPI domains and exposure to psychotropic polypharmacy.
RESULTS: A total of 421 referrals (mean age 81.5 (standard deviation 8.5) years, 
52.3% males, 46.8% Alzheimer's disease) were analysed. Of those, over 90% (n = 
383) were prescribed at least one psychotropic, with 214 referrals (50.8%) 
prescribed psychotropic polypharmacy. The medication types most associated with 
psychotropic polypharmacy were antipsychotics (n = 162, 75.7%), opioids (n = 
104, 48.6%), anxiolytics (n = 93, 43.5%), sedative/hypnotics (n = 52, 24.3%) and 
antidepressants (n = 47, 22.0%). No relationship between psychotropic 
polypharmacy and any variable tested was identified, including age, sex, 
dementia subtype and NPI severity.
CONCLUSIONS: Psychotropic polypharmacy is highly prevalent in Australians living 
with dementia referred to external dementia-specific behaviour support programs, 
but no factors were associated with its presence in this cohort.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder primarily characterized 
by cognitive impairment, for which effective treatments remain lacking. Albumin 
(ALB) is an essential carrier protein found in various body fluids, playing 
crucial roles in anti-inflammatory processes, antioxidation, and signal 
transduction. Recent research indicates that ALB may play a significant role in 
the development and progression of AD, though its specific function is not yet 
fully understood. In this study, we observed a link between serum ALB levels and 
cognitive performance in the elderly. Administration of ALB intranasally was 
shown to enhance learning and memory in MAPT/P301S transgenic mice, markedly 
decreasing hyperphosphorylation of Tau protein and reducing neuronal apoptosis. 
In a neuronal cell model overexpressing Tau, ALB administration in vitro 
attenuated Tau-induced toxicity and reduced the production of phosphorylated 
Tau. Additionally, co-incubation of Tau with ALB significantly reduced the 
formation of neurofibrillary tangles. These results suggest that ALB improves 
AD-related cognitive function by preventing the pathological aggregation of Tau 
and reducing its abnormal phosphorylation. Furthermore, ALB's neuroprotective 
effect helps prevent neuronal apoptosis in the cortex and hippocampus, providing 
potential targets for AD prevention and treatment.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that 
primarily affects older adults. Selenium, an essential micronutrient for humans, 
plays a crucial role in the body's normal physiological and metabolic processes. 
A long-term deficiency in selenium intake can lead to various diseases and even 
contribute to the ageing process. This study aims to explore the ameliorative 
effect of selenium on cognitive impairment in 3 × Tg-AD mice and to determine if 
its effects are related to the BDNF/TrkB pathway.
METHODS: We employed the APP/PS1/tau 3 × Tg-AD mouse model for dietary selenium 
intervention. Behavioural experiments were conducted to assess learning and 
memory. Additionally, we measured selenium and GSH-Px levels in whole blood and 
brain tissue. Neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampus was observed using 
transmission electron microscopy. The expressions of Aβ, P-tau, BDNF, TrkB, and 
CREB were measured via RT-qPCR, while the expressions of Aβ, P-tau, BDNF, TrkB, 
p-CREB, and CREB were quantified using Western blot analysis.
RESULTS: Our findings indicate that selenium supplementation can improve spatial 
learning and memory deficiencies in 3 × Tg-AD mice. Selenium supplementation 
increased selenium and GSH-Px levels in the brain tissue of 3 × Tg-AD mice and 
significantly enhanced neuronal conditions. Furthermore, the expression levels 
of proteins related to the BDNF/TrkB pathway significantly increased following 
selenium supplementation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that selenium can ameliorate memory 
impairment in 3 × Tg-AD mice by activating the BDNF/TrkB pathway.

Associations between mental health, diet, and risk of Alzheimer's disease 
highlight the need to investigate whether dietary patterns moderate the 
relationship between symptoms of depression and anxiety, and 
neurodegeneration-related blood-based biomarkers. Cognitively unimpaired 
participants (n = 89) were included from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and 
Lifestyle study (mean age 75.37; 44 % male). Participants provided dietary, 
depressive and anxiety symptom data, and had measurement of blood-based 
biomarkers. Dietary pattern scores (Mediterranean diet (MeDi), Dietary 
Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet (DASH), and Western diet) were generated. 
Moderation and simple slope analyses were employed. In males with mean and below 
mean MeDi adherence, depressive symptoms were associated with higher 
neurofilament light (NfL) levels. In Apolipoprotein E ε4 non-carriers with lower 
than mean and mean MeDi adherence, depressive symptoms were associated with 
higher NfL and Aβ40 levels. No associations were observed between DASH and 
Western diets and neurodegeneration-related biomarkers. MeDi adherence is 
potentially a moderator of the relationship between depressive symptoms and 
neurodegeneration-related blood-based biomarkers, with sex- and 
genotype-specific approaches important to consider within this relationship.

Comprehensive Dementia Care Models: State of the Science and Future Directions.

Murali KP, Carpenter JG, Kolanowski A, Bykovskyi AG.

The rising prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease-related 
dementias has led to renewed public discourse and policy changes in response to 
the care needs of persons living with dementia and their care partners. 
Comprehensive dementia care models are central to many recent policy 
initiatives, most notably the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Guiding 
an Improved Dementia Experience model. Gerontological nursing research is 
uniquely positioned to design and lead research investigating the effectiveness 
of these initiatives, as well as the dissemination and scaling of existing 
comprehensive dementia care models. The current Annual State of the Science 
Review provides an overview of the current state of comprehensive dementia care 
models in the United States and relevant policies. Challenges and opportunities 
for nursing education, research, and implementation across the translational 
research continuum are also outlined. [Research in Gerontological Nursing, 
18(1), 7-16.].

People suffering from a neurodegenerative disease, at a stage still allowing 
physical activity, encounter more difficulties to access to re-education and 
rehabilitation care. A trial unit specialized in medical care and rehabilitation 
(SMR) was created to handle these patients, who suffered a morbid intercurrent 
event not related to the neurocognitive disorder. The trial unit was created 
thanks to a dedicated funding from the Brittany Health Regional Agency (ARS) 
following-up a call for projects in October 2021. A retrospective monocentric 
descriptive study focusing on the overall evolution of the patient. To describe 
the social and medical characteristics of admitted patients and access the 
benefits regarding the patients regain of independence. Results: One hundred 
forty-nine patients (55 men, 94 women) were included, average age 85 ± 6.5 
years. The average length of stay was 24 ± 11 days and the rehabilitative load 
was high (scores RR 275,2 ± 175,2). A significant improvement in the autonomy of 
patients was noted, of their physical dependence scores (p < 0,001) and 
cognitive dependence scores (p < 0,001), of their overall physical condition at 
SPPB (p<0,001) as well as a decrease in the use of psychotropic drugs (p 
< 0,001); their nutritional status was unchanged (p = 0.2). One in two patients 
went home. Our work seems to confirm the importance of specialized units in the

[Olfaction and Alzheimer's disease: from deficits to therapeutic hopes].

[Article in French]

Lopis D.

Odors are known to entertain a special link with memory: once the meaning of an 
odor has been learned, it naturally acts as a retrieval cue of the learning 
context, along with the emotions and behaviors associated with it. The existence 
of this link has for several years inspired the study of olfactory function in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), known for the memory disorders it causes. The aim of 
this review is to summarize the current scientific knowledge on the almost 
paradoxical dual role played by odors in the management of AD, as both screening 
and therapeutic tools. In fact, while the existence of a specific olfactory 
deficit is confirmed in AD - as is its ability to screen for the disease - its 
properties do not prevent from taking advantage of the link between odors and 
memory to stimulate cognition and behavior in these patients. Current scientific 
data, albeit limited and with sometimes inconsistent results, suggest that this 
idea seems relevant. However, interventions based on impaired processing in AD, 
such as the recognition and naming of olfactory stimuli, must be avoided.

INTRODUCTION: Genetic load influences the therapeutic response to conventional 
drugs in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Pharmacogenetics (PGx) is the best option to 
reduce drug-drug interactions and adverse drug reactions in patients undergoing 
polypharmacy regimens. However, there are important limitations that make it 
difficult to incorporate pharmacogenetics into routine clinical practice.
AREAS COVERED: This article analyzes the pharmacogenetic apparatus made up of 
pathogenic, mechanistic, metabolic, transporter, and pleiotropic genes 
responsible for the efficacy and safety of pharmacological treatment, the impact 
of genetic load on the outcome of multifactorial treatments, and practical 
aspects for the effective use of PGx.
EXPERT OPINION: Over 120 genes are closely associated with AD. There is an 
accumulation of cerebrovascular (CVn) and neurodegenerative (ADn) genes in AD. 
APOE-4 carriers accumulate more deleterious genetic load related to other CVn 
and ADn genes, develop the disease earlier, and are at a biological disadvantage 
compared to APOE-4 non-carriers. CYP2D6-PMs and APOE-4 carriers are the worst 
responders to anti-dementia drugs. Some limitations hinder the implementation of 
PGx in clinical practice, including lack of pharmacogenetic information for many 
drugs, low number of genes in PGx screening protocols, and educational 
deficiencies in the medical community regarding PGx and genomic medicine.

AIM: The aim of the current study was to explore nano-formulation for effective 
neuroprotection by auranofin.
BACKGROUND: Currently, the treatment options for various CNS disorders, 
particularly neurodegenerative disorders, are greatly constrained. A significant 
obstacle in this pursuit is the blood-brain barrier, a shielding covering that 
hinders the route of numerous biochemical treatments into the brain. To overcome 
this problem, nanoformulation- based approaches are gaining interest, increasing 
the compound's BBB penetrability.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate whether nanoparticles 
fabricated from poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) encapsulated with auranofin could 
oppose aluminium chloride-induced Alzheimer's disease.
METHODS: Auranofin-encapsulated PLGA nanoparticles were prepared, and their 
particle size, entrapment efficiency (EE), distribution of particles, 
morphological surface charge, and structural characteristics were characterized. 
During the in vivo study, rats were orally administered AlCl3 at 100 mg/kg for 
21 days. Meanwhile, auranofin and auranofin nanoparticles were orally 
administered at doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg and 2.5 and 5 mg/kg, respectively, 
within 2 weeks. After the course therapy, the rats were decapitated, and the 
hippocampus was collected for the estimated biochemical and neuroinflammatory 
markers.
RESULTS: The auranofin nanoparticles were characterized, revealing % entrapment 
efficiency (98%) and % loading dose (76%). The nanoparticles exhibited a 
morphological surface charge of 27.5 ± 5.10 mV, a polydispersity index of 0.438 
± 0.12, and a mean particle size of 101.5 ± 10.3 nm. In the in vivo study, 
administering a gold compound (auranofin) and formulation (auranofin 
nanoparticles) resulted in a significant improvement in cognitive deficits, 
changes in biochemical parameters, and markers of neuroinflammation triggered 
with aluminium chloride.
CONCLUSION: The results have suggested that auranofin nanoparticles demonstrate 
abilities to protect neurons compared to auranofin alone. The noticed 
therapeutic benefits of the auranofin-encapsulated PLGA nanoparticles can be 
attributed to modulation in particle size with antioxidative and 
anti-inflammatory impacts of auranofin. Consequently, the outcome of the 
research has revealed that gold compound nanoparticles hold the potential to be 
a promising option for altering the therapeutic course of Alzheimer's disease.

PURPOSE: Xixin Decoction (XXD) is a classical formula that has been used to 
effectively treat dementia for over 300 years. Modern clinical studies have 
demonstrated its significant therapeutic effects in treating Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) without notable adverse reactions. Nevertheless, the specific mechanisms 
underlying its efficacy remain to be elucidated. This investigation sought to 
elucidate XXD's impact on various aspects of AD pathology, including blood-brain 
barrier (BBB) impairment, neuroinflammatory processes, and amyloid-β (Aβ) 
deposition, as well as the molecular pathways involved in these effects.
METHODS: In vitro experiments were conducted using hCMEC/D3 and HBVP cell 
coculture to establish an in vitro blood-brain barrier (BBB) model. BBB damage 
was induced in this model by 24-h exposure to 1 μg/mL lipopolysaccharide (LPS). 
After 24, 48, and 72 h of treatment with 10% XXD-medicated serum, the effects of 
XXD were assessed through Western blotting, RT-PCR, and immunofluorescence 
techniques. In vivo, SAMP8 mice were administered various doses of XXD via 
gavage for 8 weeks, including high-dose XXD group (H-XXD) at 5.07 g kg-1·d-1, 
medium-dose XXD group (M-XXD) at 2.535 g kg-1·d-1, and low-dose XXD group 
(L-XXD) at 1.2675 g kg-1·d-1. Cognitive function was subsequently evaluated 
using the Morris water maze test. BBB integrity was evaluated using Evans blue 
staining, and protein expression levels were analyzed via ELISA, Western 
blotting, and immunofluorescence.
RESULTS: In vitro experiments revealed that XXD-containing serum, when cultured 
for 24, 48, and 72 h, could upregulate the expression of P-gp mRNA and protein, 
downregulate CB1 protein expression, and upregulate CB2 and Mfsd2a protein 
expression. In vivo studies demonstrated that XXD improved spatial learning and 
memory abilities in SAMP8 mice, reduced the amount of Evans blue extravasation 
in brain tissues, modulated the BBB-associated P-gp/ECS axis, RAGE/LRP1 receptor 
system, as well as MRP2 and Mfsd2a proteins, and decreased the accumulation of 
Aβ in the brains of SAMP8 mice. Additionally, XXD upregulated the expression of 
TREM2, downregulated IBA1, TLR1, TLR2, and CMPK2 expression, and reduced the 
levels of pro-inflammatory factors NLRP3, NF-κB p65, COX-2, TNF-α, and IL-1β in 
the hippocampal tissues.
CONCLUSION: XXD may exert its effects by regulating the P-gp/ECS axis, the 
RAGE/LRP1 receptor system, and the expression of MRP2 and Mfsd2a proteins, 
thereby modulating the transport function of the BBB to expedite the clearance 
of Aβ, reduce cerebral Aβ accumulation, and consequently inhibit the activation 
of microglia induced by Aβ aggregation. This process may suppress the activation 
of the CMPK2/NLRP3 and TLRs/NF-κB pathways, diminish the production of 
inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, alleviate neuroinflammation associated 
with microglia in the brain of AD, and ultimately improve AD pathology.

PURPOSE OF THE REPORT: Adults with Down Syndrome (DS) have a substantially 
increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to the triplicated 
amyloid-precursor-protein gene on chromosome 21, resulting in amyloid and tau 
accumulation. However, tau PET assessments are not sufficiently implemented in 
DS-AD research or clinical work-up, and second-generation tau tracers such as 
[18F]PI-2620 have not been thoroughly characterized in adults with DS. We aim at 
illustrating feasibility and potential diagnostic value of tau PET imaging with 
[18F]PI-2620 for the diagnosis of DS-AD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five adults with DS (40% female, aged 43-62) and 
cognitive decline underwent clinical assessments, neuropsychological testing, 
lumbar puncture and multimodal neuroimaging. All underwent [18F]PI-2620 tau PET. 
Visual read of tau PET scans was performed by three blinded raters, assessing 
increased tracer uptake in brain areas corresponding to the six Braak stage 
regions and basal ganglia.
RESULTS: Visual read of tau burden revealed three tau-positive individuals which 
corresponded to their clinical decline while two cognitively stable individuals 
were rated as negative. Rating showed high inter-rater reliability for all Braak 
stages.
CONCLUSION: Tau PET imaging is a feasible and important biomarker assessment in 
the differential diagnosis of cognitive decline in adults with DS at risk of 
developing AD.

BACKGROUND: Although sleep duration and sleep-related breathing disorders were 
associated with dementia previously, few studies examined the association 
between circadian rhythm association and cognitive status.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the association of rest and activity rhythm 
with cognitive performance in older people with cognitive complaints and less 
education.
METHODS: Activity rhythm was evaluated with wrist actigraphy in 109 
community-dwelling older people with cognitive complaints without diagnosed 
dementia. Each participant completed a neuropsychological battery and was 
classified as having cognitive impairment (MCI), dementia, or normal cognition. 
We used adjusted multinomial logistic regression and linear regression models to 
compare sleep and circadian non-parametric measures with cognitive groups and 
cognitive z-scores, respectively.
RESULTS: The mean age of the 109 participants was 79.3 ± 6.3 years old, 74% were 
women, 68% were white, and the mean education was 5.6 ± 5.2 years. Daytime 
activity intensity was associated with better language (β = 0.178; 95% 
CI = 0.022, 0.334; p = 0.03) and visuospatial performance (β = 0.158; 
95%CI = 0.008, 0.308; p = 0.04). Also, less fragmented rhythm was associated 
with better visuospatial (β = 0.172; 95%CI = 0.025, 0.320; p = 0.02) and global 
cognitive scores (β = 0.134; 95%CI = 0.005, 0.263; p = 0.04). More interdaily 
stability was associated with a lower risk of MCI and dementia (RR = 0.54; 
95%CI = 0.29-0.99; p = 0.04, and RR = 0.44; 95%CI = 0.21-0.94; p = 0.03, 
respectively). Moreover, more daytime activity (RR = 0.40; 95%CI = 0.18-0.89; 
p = 0.02) and less rhythm fragmentation (RR = 0.31; 95%CI = 0.14-0.73; 
p = 0.007) were associated with lower risk for dementia.
CONCLUSION: Daytime activity intensity and fragmented rhythm during the day and 
night may play an important role as markers for cognitive impairment in less 
educated populations. Future studies with larger samples should confirm these 
findings.

OBJECTIVES: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder 
that primarily affects elderly individuals. This study aimed to elucidate the 
intricate mechanisms underlying AD in elderly patients compared with healthy 
aged individuals using high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data and 
next-generation knowledge discovery methods (NGKD), with a focus on identifying 
potential therapeutic agents.
METHODS: High-throughput RNA-seq data were obtained from the Gene Expression 
Omnibus (GEO) database (accession number: GSE104704). These data were derived 
from healthy and diseased human brains (eight young healthy brains [young], 10 
aged healthy brains [Old], and 12 aged diseased brains [AD]). We used NGKD tools 
such as GEO RNA-seq Experiments Interactive Navigator (GREIN) to obtain 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by comparing the AD versus Old RNA-seq 
data and further filtered and normalized to obtain differentially regulated 
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Reactome and Panther pathways 
using ExpressAnalyst tool. Besides, WebGestalt was used to identify 
differentially regulated Gene Ontologies (GO) and the pre-ranked Gene Set 
Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed using GSEA software. The X2K web tool 
was used to infer upstream regulator networks and X2K Appyter tool for obtaining 
transcription factors (TFs) and kinase network information. LFW1000 and 
L1000CDS2 tools were used to identify specific drugs that reverse AD-associated 
gene signatures in elderly patients.
RESULTS: Our study revealed significant downregulation of pathways related to 
neuroactive receptor-ligand interaction, synaptic vesicle cycle, and neuronal 
system in elderly individuals with AD. GO analysis showed negative enrichment of 
functions related to cognition, potassium ion transport, receptor-ligand 
activity, SNARE binding, and primary lysosomes. The transcription factors SUZ12 
and REST, along with increased MAPK signaling, were identified as key regulators 
of downregulated genes. Several drugs and natural products, including 
dihydroergocristine, mepacrine, gedunin, amlodipine, and disulfiram have been 
identified as potential therapeutic agents for reversing AD-associated gene 
signatures.
CONCLUSIONS: This comprehensive analysis of AD in elderly individuals using 
RNA-seq data and NGKD tools revealed multiple differentially regulated pathways, 
gene signatures, and potential drugs for dementia treatment. These findings 
highlight the complex molecular mechanisms underlying AD and provide insights 
into potential therapeutic strategies. Further research is needed to validate 
these findings and to develop personalized treatment approaches for AD in 
elderly patients.

BackgroundOur previous studies have established that the broad-spectrum 
anti-epileptic drug lamotrigine (LTG) confers protection against cognitive 
impairments, synapse and nerve cell damage, as well as characteristic 
neuropathologies in APP/PS1 mice, a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
However, the precise molecular mechanisms responsible for this protective effect 
induced by LTG remain largely elusive.ObjectiveIn this study, we aimed to 
investigate the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of LTG against 
AD.MethodsFive-month-old APP/PS1 mice were treated with 30 mg/kg of LTG daily 
for three consecutive months. Subsequently, high-throughput ribosome profiling 
sequencing was conducted to identify differentially translated genes (DTGs) 
rescued by LTG in the brains of these mice. To gain further insights into the 
potential functions and pathways of these LTG-rescued DTGs, gene ontology 
enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway 
enrichment analysis were performed. RNA expression, protein levels, and 
translational efficiency were assessed to explore how LTG regulated gene 
expression processes in AD-related DTGs. Additionally, Aβ42 peptide-stimulated 
primary neurons were used to uncover the potential mechanisms and signaling 
pathway by which LTG mitigated oxidative stress under AD context.ResultsFor the 
first time, we reveal that LTG inactivates mitochondrial complexes in the brains 
of APP/PS1 mice by suppressing the translational efficiency of mitochondrial 
complexes-related genes. More importantly, we demonstrate that LTG mitigates 
mitochondrial-mediated oxidative stress in neurons within the context of AD by 
activation of SIRT6/PGC-1α pathway.ConclusionsThese findings provide further 
insights into the mechanisms underlying the protective effects of LTG against 
AD.

BACKGROUND: Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors is a novel 
category of medications for diabetes, exhibiting neuroprotective potential. 
However, evidence regarding whether the use of SGLT2 inhibitors effectively 
reduces the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: Our study employed Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to 
investigate potential causal relationships between SGLT2 inhibition, 
metabolites, and AD.
METHODS: In our research, we used a two-sample MR method to explore the link 
between SGLT2 inhibitor use and AD, addressing both its late-onset and 
early-onset forms. Furthermore, we executed a two-step MR analysis to explore 
how circulating metabolites, primarily endogenous in nature due to SGLT2 
inhibition, mediate the relationship between SGLT2 inhibition and AD. The 
genetic instruments for SGLT2 inhibition were pinpointed through their 
association with SLC5A2 gene expression and the decreased glycated hemoglobin 
(HbA1c) levels.
RESULTS: Genetic analysis indicated that SGLT2 inhibition, which effectively 
reduces HbA1c by enhancing renal glucose excretion and improving glycemic 
control, was associated with a lower likelihood of developing AD for every 1 SD 
decrease in HbA1c (OR = 0.48, [0.36, 0.63], p < 0.001). Our MR analysis revealed 
that SGLT2 inhibition significantly affected 27 of the 123 metabolites examined, 
adhering to a Bonferroni correction threshold (p < 4.06 × 10-4). Among these 27 
significant metabolites, citrate was also associated with AD, showing a 
significant association (0.81 [0.79, 0.83], p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The study provides strong evidence linking SGLT2 inhibition with a 
lower AD risk, highlighting citrate's potential mediating role for subsequent 
clinical research.

BACKGROUND: Some studies have suggested that glaucoma may be associated with 
neurodegeneration and a higher risk of dementia.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether exposure to different categories of topical 
glaucoma medications is associated with differential dementia risks in people 
with glaucoma.
METHODS: We used data from Adult Changes in Thought, a population-based, 
prospective cohort study that follows cognitively normal older adults from 
Kaiser Permanente Washington (KPWA) until Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related 
dementia development. We included participants with a diagnosis of glaucoma, 
KPWA pharmacy records of filling topical glaucoma medication (alpha-adrenergic 
agonists [AAA], beta-adrenergic antagonists, miotics, carbonic anhydrase 
inhibitors [CAI], and prostaglandins) and at least 10 years of pharmacy records. 
Eight-year sliding windows were derived for each medication class by computing 
days on each medication starting 10 years earlier and excluding the most recent 
2 years. Cox regression used all 5 classes of medication simultaneously to 
predict AD and all-cause dementia.
RESULTS: We included 521 participants (mean age 78 [range 65-96], 62% female) 
with APOE genotype data. Beta-adrenergic antagonists were the most frequently 
prescribed (n = 431) followed by prostaglandins (351), AAA (239), CAI (162), and 
miotics (142). Adjusting for time-varying exposure to other glaucoma 
medications, APOE, demographics, and smoking, each year of use of 
alpha-adrenergic agonists in an 8-year window was associated with a higher risk 
of developing dementia (HR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.03-1.72).
CONCLUSIONS: Among older adults with treated glaucoma, exposure to 
alpha-adrenergic agonists appears to be associated with risk for developing 
all-cause dementia.

OBJECTIVE: The long-recognized association of brain injury with increased risk 
of dementia has undergone significant refinement and more detailed study in 
recent decades. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a specific 
neurodegenerative tauopathy related to prior exposure to repetitive head impacts 
(RHI). We aim to contextualize CTE within a historical perspective and among 
emerging data which highlights the scientific and conceptual evolution of 
CTE-related research in parallel with the broader field of neurodegenerative 
disease and dementia.
METHODS: We provide a narrative state-of-the-science update on CTE 
neuropathology, clinical manifestations, biomarkers, different types and 
patterns of head impact exposure relevant for CTE, and the complicated influence 
of neurodegenerative co-pathology on symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: Now almost 20 years since the initial case report of CTE in a 
former American football player, the field of CTE continues evolving with 
increasing clarity but also several ongoing controversies. Our understanding of 
CTE neuropathology outpaces that of disease-specific clinical correlates or the 
development of in-vivo biomarkers. Diagnostic criteria for symptoms attributable 
to CTE are still being validated, but leveraging increasingly available 
biomarkers for other conditions like Alzheimer's disease may be helpful for 
informing the CTE differential diagnosis. As diagnostic refinement efforts 
advance, clinicians should provide care and/or referrals to providers best 
suited to treat an individual patient's clinical symptoms, many of which have 
evidence-based behavioral treatment options that are etiologically agnostic. 
Several ongoing research initiatives and the gradual accrual of gold standard 
clinico-pathological data will pay dividends for advancing the many existing 
gaps in the field of CTE.

BACKGROUND: Apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) is associated with an increased risk of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), depression, and anxiety, which were reported to 
improve after the administration of metformin. However, sex influence on the 
effect of ApoE4 and metformin on cognition and mental health is poorly 
understood.
METHODS: ApoE3-TR and apoE4-TR mice of both sexes were randomly assigned to the 
normal saline and metformin groups from 13 months to 18 months of age. Behavior 
tests (MWM, EPM, OFT, TST, FST) were conducted to assess cognition, anxiety, and 
depression-like behaviors. The mice's blood glucose was also recorded.
RESULTS: Male aged apoE4-TR mice are more vulnerable to cognitive decline than 
females. Metformin improves the spatial memory of female, but not male apoE3-TR 
mice and female apoE4-TR mice while aggravating the cognitive impairment of male 
apoE4-TR mice. The anxiety-like phenotypes in male apoE4-TR mice are more severe 
than in male apoE3-TR mice, while metformin ameliorates the anxiety-like 
behaviors in the male apoE4-TR mice but not in male apoE3-TR mice. In addition, 
metformin alleviates depression-like behaviors in male and female apoE4-TR mice. 
The hypoglycemic effect of metformin is insignificant in both male and female 
apoE4-TR mice.
CONCLUSIONS: Male sex exacerbates APOE4-related cognitive impairment and anxiety 
in aged mice and is insensitive to the cognition improvement effect of metformin 
in the aged apoE3 mice. Male sex with APOE4 may experience more severe cognitive 
impairment after treatment with metformin while sensitive to the anti-anxiety 
effects of metformin. These findings identify sex-specific effects on 
ApoE4-based dementia, anxiety prevention, and therapy, emphasizing the 
importance of further sex dimension analyses in vivo and clinical studies.

A new oleanane-type triterpenoid, 3β-acetyl-15α-hydroxy-oleanane-13β,28-olide 
(1), and a new clerodane furanoditerpenoid, cnidophyllin A (2), together with 11 
known compounds (3-13) were isolated and identified from the 95% ethanol extract 
of the leaves and twigs of Croton cnidophyllus. Except for compounds 3 and 7, 
all other compounds were isolated for the first time from C. cnidophyllus. The 
structures of the new compounds were ascertained through a comprehensive 
application of spectroscopic techniques, including both one- and two-dimensional 
nuclear magnetic resonance, infrared, and high-resolution electrospray 
ionization mass spectrometry, while their absolute configurations were validated 
either through single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis or via electronic 
circular dichroism calculations. Meanwhile, the single-crystal X-ray diffraction 
data of 8 has been reported for the first time. Additionally, the in vivo 
anti-Alzheimer's disease (AD) activities of compounds 3-13 were assessed using 
the Caenorhabditis elegans AD pathology model. Among all the isolated compounds, 
compounds 4 and 7-13 significantly delayed the paralysis of the worms with 
AD-like symptoms, which may be potential candidates for anti-AD drugs.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disease 
(ND). In recent years, multiple clinical and animal studies have shown that 
mitochondrial dysfunction may be involved in the pathogenesis of AD. In 
addition, short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) produced by intestinal microbiota 
metabolism have been considered to be important factors affecting central 
nervous system (CNS) homeostasis. Among the main mediators of host-microbe 
interactions, volatile fatty acids play a crucial role. Nevertheless, the 
influence and pathways of microorganisms and their metabolites on Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) remain uncertain.
RESULTS: In this study, we present distinctions in blood and fecal SCFA levels 
and microbiota composition between healthy individuals and those diagnosed with 
AD. We found that AD patients showed a decrease in the abundance of Akkermansia 
muciniphila and a decrease in propionic acid both in fecal and in blood. In 
order to further reveal the effects and the mechanisms of propionic acid on AD 
prevention, we systematically explored the effects of propionic acid 
administration on AD model mice and cultured hippocampal neuronal cells. Results 
showed that oral propionate supplementation ameliorated cognitive impairment in 
AD mice. Propionate downregulated mitochondrial fission protein (DRP1) via 
G-protein coupled receptor 41 (GPR41) and enhanced PINK1/PARKIN-mediated 
mitophagy via G-protein coupled receptor 43 (GPR43) in AD pathophysiology which 
contribute to maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis both in vivo and in vitro. 
Administered A. muciniphila to AD mice before disease onset showed improved 
cognition, mitochondrial division and mitophagy in AD mice.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results demonstrate that A. muciniphila and its 
metabolite propionate protect against AD-like pathological events in AD mouse 
models by targeting mitochondrial homeostasis, making them promising therapeutic 
candidates for the prevention and treatment of AD. Video Abstract.

This study investigates silibinin's capacity to mitigate Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) pathologies with a particular emphasis on its effects on apoptosis and 
synaptic dysfunction in AD models. Employing APP/PS1 transgenic mice and SH-SY5Y 
neuroblastoma cell lines, our research assessed the efficacy of silibinin in 
reducing amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition, neuroinflammation, and neuronal 
apoptosis. Our results demonstrate that silibinin significantly decreases Aβ 
accumulation and neuroinflammation and robustly inhibits apoptosis in neuronal 
cells. Additionally, silibinin enhances the expression of synaptic proteins, 
thereby supporting synaptic integrity. Through network pharmacology analysis, we 
identified potential targets of silibinin in Aβ metabolism and synaptic 
functions. Mechanistically, our findings suggest that silibinin promotes 
neuronal survival predominantly via the modulation of the Fyn/GluN2B/CaMKIIα 
signaling pathway, which protects against Aβ1-42-induced apoptosis. These 
insights highlight silibinin's potential as a therapeutic agent for AD, 
particularly its role in reducing neuronal apoptosis and maintaining synaptic 
function.

Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are increasingly being used 
to treat diabetes and obesity. However, their effectiveness and risks have not 
yet been systematically evaluated in a comprehensive set of possible health 
outcomes. Here, we used the US Department of Veterans Affairs databases to build 
a cohort of people with diabetes who initiated GLP-1RA (n = 215,970) and 
compared them to those who initiated sulfonylureas (n = 159,465), dipeptidyl 
peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors (n = 117,989) or sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 
(SGLT2) inhibitors (n = 258,614), a control group composed of an equal 
proportion of individuals initiating sulfonylureas, DPP4 inhibitors and SGLT2 
inhibitors (n = 536,068), and a control group of 1,203,097 individuals who 
continued use of non-GLP-1RA antihyperglycemics (usual care). We used a 
discovery approach to systematically map an atlas of the associations of GLP-1RA 
use versus each comparator with 175 health outcomes. Compared to usual care, 
GLP-1RA use was associated with a reduced risk of substance use and psychotic 
disorders, seizures, neurocognitive disorders (including Alzheimer's disease and 
dementia), coagulation disorders, cardiometabolic disorders, infectious 
illnesses and several respiratory conditions. There was an increased risk of 
gastrointestinal disorders, hypotension, syncope, arthritic disorders, 
nephrolithiasis, interstitial nephritis and drug-induced pancreatitis associated 
with GLP-1RA use compared to usual care. The results provide insights into the 
benefits and risks of GLP-1RAs and may be useful for informing clinical care and 
guiding research agendas.

Psychiatric disorders are multifactorial and effective treatments are lacking. 
Probable contributing factors to the challenges in therapeutic development 
include the complexity of the human brain and the high polygenicity of 
psychiatric disorders. Combining well-powered genome-wide and brain-wide 
genetics and transcriptomics analyses can deepen our understanding of the 
etiology of psychiatric disorders. Here, we leverage two landmark resources to 
infer the cell types involved in the etiology of schizophrenia, other 
psychiatric disorders and informative comparison of brain phenotypes. We found 
both cortical and subcortical neuronal associations for schizophrenia, bipolar 
disorder and depression. These cell types included somatostatin interneurons, 
excitatory neurons from the retrosplenial cortex and eccentric medium spiny-like 
neurons from the amygdala. In contrast we found T cell and B cell associations 
with multiple sclerosis and microglial associations with Alzheimer's disease. We 
provide a framework for a cell-type-based classification system that can lead to 
drug repurposing or development opportunities and personalized treatments. This 
work formalizes a data-driven, cellular and molecular model of complex brain 
disorders.

Cerebrolysin (CBL) is a combination of neurotrophic peptides and amino acids 
derived from pig brains. CBL can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and its 
biological effect is similar to the effect of endogenous neurotrophic effects. 
The mechanism of action of CBL is related to the induction of neurogenesis, 
neuroplasticity, neuroprotection, and neurotrophicity. Therefore, CBL may be 
effective against the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases 
such as Alzheimer disease (AD) and cerebrovascular disorders such as vascular 
dementia (VD). Moreover, many studies highlighted that CBL is effective in the 
improvement of cognitive impairment in patients with neurodegenerative diseases. 
However, the underlying neuroprotective effects of CBL against the VD 
neuropathology were not fully elucidated. Thus, this review aims to discuss the 
possible therapeutic efficacy of CBL in the management of VD. In conclusion, CBL 
could be effective therapeutic strategy in preventing and treating VD by 
targeting neuroinflammation, BBB injury, and chronic cerebral hypoperfusion.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative condition 
characterized by progressive cognitive decline with currently no effective 
treatment available. One of the most critical areas in AD research is the 
identification of reliable biomarkers, which are essential for accurate 
diagnosis, prognostic assessment, and the development of targeted therapies. In 
this study, we introduce two novel reactive EEG (rEEG) biomarkers aimed at 
enhancing the diagnosis of AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). These 
biomarkers, previously unexplored in the literature, offer new insights into 
differentiating between various cognitive states. The first biomarker 
demonstrates a significant ability to distinguish between AD patients and normal 
controls (NC), while also effectively distinguishing MCI patients from NC. The 
second biomarker is designed to identify a subset of AD patients exhibiting 
hyperconductivity or hyperactivity, characterized by distinctive neural 
electrical patterns. A cohort of 90 elderly participants (mean age 76.63 ± 6.08 
years) was recruited, including 30 AD patients, 30 individuals with MCI, and 30 
NC subjects. Psychiatric diagnoses of participants were made by qualified 
professionals at Daejeon St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, 
utilizing comprehensive neuropsychological assessments. Notably, the rEEG 
biomarkers achieved accuracies of 95%, 95%, and 98% in distinguishing between AD 
and NC, AD and MCI, and MCI and NC groups, respectively. These results 
underscore the potential of rEEG as a highly accurate and reliable diagnostic 
tool for cognitive impairments, including AD and MCI.

Scientific reports from various areas of the world indicate the potential role 
of tocopherols (vitamin E) in particular α-tocopherol in the prevention and 
therapy of Alzheimer's disease. The current phenomenon is related to the growing 
global awareness of eating habits and is also determined by the need to develop 
the prevention, management and therapy of Alzheimer's disease. This article is a 
review of current research on the action of the active form of vitamin 
E-α-tocopherol and its impact on the development and course of Alzheimer's 
disease. Additionally, to contrast this information, selected primary research 
on this topic was included. The aim of this article is to analyze and summarize 
the available scientific information on the effects of the active form of 
vitamin E, α-tocopherol, on the development and course of Alzheimer's disease. 
In the structure of the review, particular attention was paid to the analysis of 
the pathophysiological processes of the disease and the biochemical features of 
the action of α-tocopherol. To discuss the relationship between the effect of 
α-tocopherol and the occurrence of Alzheimer's disease, a literature review was 
conducted using the following databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, and Elsevier. 
During the search process, the following keywords were used: "tocopherols", 
"vitamin E", "α-tocopherol", "Alzheimer's disease" in various combinations. The 
process was conducted in accordance with the adopted search strategy taking into 
account the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the 
most common, irreversible neurodegenerative disease, so many scientists are 
actively looking for substances and/or strategies to prevent its development and 
to slow down its course in patients. Alpha-tocopherols (ATF) are a factor that 
inhibits the pathophysiological processes associated with the development of AD 
by reducing the formation of atherogenic amyloid B (AB). Additionally, this type 
of tocopherols has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and has a 
positive effect on the metabolic functioning of mitochondria. It has been shown 
that a higher intake of α-tocopherol (ATF) was associated with a reduced risk of 
developing dementia and the occurrence of mild types of cognitive impairment 
(MCI). Various sources indicate an insufficient supply of ATF in the diet. ATF 
supplementation may potentially help to slow down the course of Alzheimer's 
disease, which is why this substance may be popularized in the treatment of this 
disease in the future. However, there is a need for further research on this 
issue.
