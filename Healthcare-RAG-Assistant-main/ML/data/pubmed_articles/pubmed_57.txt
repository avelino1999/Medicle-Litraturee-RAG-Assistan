Substance use disorders (SUD) and HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) 
work synergistically as a significant cause of cognitive decline in adults and 
adolescents globally. Current therapies continue to be limited due to 
difficulties crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB) leading to limited precision 
and effectiveness, neurotoxicity, and lack of co-treatment options for both HAND 
and SUD. Nanoparticle-based therapeutics have several advantages over 
conventional therapies including more precise targeting, the ability to cross 
the BBB, and high biocompatibility which decreases toxicity and optimizes 
sustainability. These advantages extend to other neurological disorders such as 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This review 
summarizes recent advances in nanotechnology for application to HAND, SUD, and 
co-treatment, as well as other neurological disorders. This review also 
highlights the potential challenges these therapies face in clinical translation 
and long-term safety.

Ketamine has received growing attention for its effects on neuroplasticity and 
neuroinflammation, and as a treatment for depression and other mental health 
disorders. Recent evidence suggests that early sensory and behavioral deficits 
in Alzheimer's disease could be caused by synaptic disruption that occurs before 
irreversible neuropathology. This raises the possibility that ketamine could 
slow down or prevent network disruption and the ensuing sensory and behavioral 
deficits in Alzheimer's. Here we tested this idea in the 5XFAD mouse model of 
Alzheimer's, using either an acute single injection of ketamine, or chronic 
daily injections over 15 weeks. We tested the effects of ketamine on both 
amyloid plaque load and on a behavioral auditory gap detection task that is an 
early Alzheimer's biomarker in both mice and humans. We found that ketamine had 
no effect on plaque load, nor any effect on gap detection, for either acute or 
chronic dosing. Chronic ketamine facilitated startle responses specifically in 
5XFAD mice, but this could simply be related to experience-dependent effects on 
stress or habituation rather than any rescue effect of ketamine on 
Alzheimer's-related deficits. We did find robust correlations between gap 
detection deficits and plaque load in auditory cortex and in the caudal pontine 
reticular nucleus, demonstrating that the behavioral deficits seen in 5XFAD mice 
are directly related to amyloid accumulation in these brain regions, and 
confirming the validity of gap detection as an early biomarker of Alzheimer's. 
Ketamine, however, had no effect on the strength of these correlations. We 
conclude that ketamine has no beneficial effect on the development of behavioral 
gap detection deficits or plaque load in the 5XFAD Alzheimer's mouse model, 
following either an acute single dose or a chronic daily dose regimen.

Neurodegenerative diseases, characterized by progressive neuronal loss and 
cognitive impairments, pose a significant global health challenge. This study 
explores the potential of nanotherapeutics as a promising approach to enhance 
drug delivery across physiological barriers, particularly the blood-brain 
barrier (BBB) and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (B-CSFB). By employing 
nanoparticles, this research aims to address critical challenges in the 
diagnosis and treatment of conditions such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and 
Huntington's diseases. The multifactorial nature of these disorders necessitates 
innovative solutions that leverage nanomedicine to improve drug solubility, 
circulation time, and targeted delivery while minimizing off-target effects. The 
findings underscore the importance of advancing nanomedicine applications to 
develop effective therapeutic strategies that can alleviate the burden of 
neurodegenerative diseases on individuals and healthcare systems.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Gastrodin, an active compound derived from the traditional 
Chinese herbal medicine Gastrodia, demonstrates a variety of pharmacological 
effects, particularly in the enhancement of neural functions. Thus, the aim of 
this study is to explore the therapeutic effects of gastrodin on Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) and its underlying molecular mechanisms.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE: Cognitive function was assessed via Morris water maze 
and Y-maze tests. Tau pathology, neuroinflammation, and BBB dysfunction were 
analyzed using various techniques, including Western blot, immunohistochemistry, 
and ELISA. ADRA1 overexpression was induced by lentiviral infection, and 
gastrodin's impact on NF-κB p65, NLRP3, IL-1β, and IL-18 levels was evaluated.
KEY RESULTS: In the in vivo experiment, gastrodin enhanced learning and spatial 
memory in 3xTg-AD mice, as well as reducing p-Tau protein expression in the 
hippocampus and cortex. Gastrodin inhibited the ADRA1/NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway, which 
decreased glial cell activation and inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18, 
improving neuron and BBB function. In the in vitro experiment, gastrodin 
inhibited the activation of the NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway due to ADRA1 overexpression 
and prevented the Aβ42-induced increase in ADRA1/NF-κB/NLRP3 protein expression 
in SH-SY5Y cells. It also reduced IL-1β and IL-18 cytokine release, restoring 
tight junction protein expression in bEnd.3 cells.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: gastrodin ameliorates learning and memory 
abilities by alleviating neuroinflammation and tau pathology, restoring the 
structure and function of neurons and BBB, suggesting that gastrodin may serve 
as an effective drug for the treatment of AD.

BackgroundAlzheimer's disease (AD) and its monoclonal antibody therapies are 
associated with brain vasculitis and amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. The 
naturally-formed epoxides (EpFAs) of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), such 
as 11,12-epoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (EEQ), are anti-inflammatory and 
pro-resolution mediators, which are increased by dietary supplementation with 
ω-3 PUFAs. EpFAs are, however, enzymatically hydrolyzed by soluble epoxide 
hydrolase (sEH) in AD patients' macrophages in vivo and in vitro.ObjectiveTo 
repair amyloid-β 1-42 (Aβ) degradation by AD macrophages using the inhibitors of 
a) soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEHIs), termed TPPU and EC5026, together with 
EpFAs, or b) STING pathway termed H-151.MethodsImmunobiology, immunochemistry, 
RNA sequencing, and confocal microscopy were used.ResultsIn AD brain (examined 
postmortem), monocyte/macrophages upload Aβ in plaques and transfer it without 
degradation into brain microvessels, suffer apoptotis, and release Aβ, inducing 
vasculitis. The EpFAs of epoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (EEQ), along with the 
inhibitors TPPU and H-151, decrease inflammatory cytokines and regulate 
macrophage unfolded protein response to endoplasmic reticulum stress. Treatment 
of AD macrophages by TPPU with EEQ or by STING inhibitor H-151 increased 
uploading of Aβ after 2 hours and increased degradation of Aβ after 
24 hours.ConclusionsThe sEHI inhibitor EC5026 and the STING inhibitor H-151 
increased macrophage uptake and degradation of Aβ. EC5026 administration was 
safe in normal volunteers. EC5026 together with ω-3 PUFA supplementation are 
indicated for in a clinical trial in patients with mild cognitive impairment.

BackgroundCortico-basal degeneration (CBD) is a neurodegenerative disease 
typically responsible for cortico-basal syndrome (CBS) or progressive limb 
apraxia. Half of CBD patients, however, present atypical symptoms, making the 
diagnosis difficult.ObjectiveWe reported the case of a woman in her late sixties 
(BM208), an unusual case of autopsy-proven CBD, showing early signs of Benson's 
syndrome or posterior cortical atrophy. In addition, we compared cognitive 
performance and atrophy in different brain regions of BM208 with other 
neurodegenerative diseases patients to highlight clinical signs that could have 
guided the diagnosis earlier.MethodsWe retrospectively compared BM208 to 
patients with typical amnestic Alzheimer's disease (AD) (n = 18, Mini-Mental 
State Exam (MMSE) scores between 18 and 24), Benson's syndrome due to AD 
(n = 3), CBS/progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) syndrome (n = 5), and Lewy 
body dementia (LBD) patients (n = 3) and a control group (n = 24). All these 
participants underwent an MMSE, a complete neuropsychological examination and 
3DT1 MRI.ResultsAlthough BM208 was more severely cognitively impaired overall, 
her cognitive performance was more similar to Benson's syndrome patients' 
cognitive profile compared to CBS patients or any other degenerative pathology 
(typical AD/LBD). Consistently, although BM208 was more atrophic than all other 
groups, she showed cortical atrophy that matched a Benson's syndrome pattern 
more than typical AD or CBS. However, the analysis of subcortical atrophy 
revealed atrophy of the basal ganglia corresponding CBS cases. Furthermore, 
visual analyses on sagittal T1 images showed atrophy of the midbrain, 
characteristic of CBS/PSP syndrome.ConclusionsThese results highlight the 
additive value of fine-grained MRI subcortical quantification to diagnose non-AD 
rare neurodegenerative disorders.

BACKGROUND: Apathy worsens with age and cognitive decline, particularly in 
Alzheimer's, leading to functional and cognitive deterioration. Comprehending 
its broad impact is vital for customized, preventive treatments.
METHODS: The study examined 214 adults divided in three groups-Mild Cognitive 
Impairment, mild Alzheimer's, and controls-using neuropsychological tests and 
questionnaires, with statistical and network analysis to explore apathy's links 
with other group variables related to demographics and treatment.
RESULTS: Notable differences were observed among the groups' performance of 
administered tests. While inferential statistics failed to return a predictive 
model of apathy in mild Alzheimer's, networks and cluster analyses indicate that 
the demographic variables analysed have different importance at different times 
of disease progression and that cognitive apathy is particularly prominent in 
AD-related decline.
CONCLUSIONS: Network analysis revealed insights into dementia risk 
differentiation, notably the impact of sex and demographic factors, beyond the 
scope of traditional statistics. It highlighted cognitive apathy as a key area 
for personalized intervention strategies more than behavioural and emotional, 
emphasizing the importance of short-term goals and not taking away the person's 
autonomy when not strictly necessary.

Computational drug repositioning approaches should be investigated for the 
identification of new treatments for Alzheimer's patients as a huge amount of 
omics data has been produced during pre-clinical and clinical studies. Here, we 
investigated a gene network in Alzheimer's patients to detect a proper 
therapeutic target. We screened the targets of different drugs (34,006 
compounds) using data available in the Connectivity Map database. Then, we 
analyzed transcriptome profiles of Alzheimer's patients to discover a network of 
gene-drugs based on mutual information, representing an index of dependence 
among genes. This study identified a network consisting of 25 genes and 
compounds and interconnected biological processes using computational 
approaches. The results also highlight the diagnostic role of the 25 genes since 
we obtained good classification performances using a neural network model. We 
also suggest 12 repurposable drugs (like KU-60019, AM-630, CP55940, enflurane, 
ginkgolide B, linopirdine, apremilast, ibudilast, pentoxifylline, roflumilast, 
acitretin, and tamibarotene) interacting with 6 genes (ATM, CNR1, GLRB, KCNQ2, 
PDE4B, and RARA), that we linked to retrograde endocannabinoid signaling, 
synaptic vesicle cycle, morphine addiction, and homologous recombination.

Neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's are a global health 
challenge due to their progressive degeneration, leading to cognitive decline 
and motor dysfunction. Monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) enzyme is implicated in 
neurodegeneration, and developing inhibitors could be a promising therapeutic 
strategy. This review explores MAO-B activity molecular pathways, evaluates 
MAO-B inhibitors in neurodegenerative therapy, identifies challenges, and 
suggests future research directions. This review synthesizes findings from a 
range of scientific literature, including experimental studies, clinical trials, 
and biochemical analyses that focus on the role of MAO-B in neurodegeneration. 
Information was gathered from databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and Web of 
Science, ensuring a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in MAO-B 
inhibition strategies. The review reveals several promising MAO-B inhibitors 
that have demonstrated efficacy in preclinical models, as well as some that have 
progressed to clinical trials. Compounds such as rasagiline and selegiline have 
shown neuroprotective effects and benefits in symptom management in patients 
with Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, the review discusses novel inhibitors 
that target specific molecular pathways, enhancing the potential for improved 
therapeutic outcomes. However, several inhibitors also present challenges 
regarding their selectivity, side effects, and long-term efficacy. Research on 
MAO-B inhibitors for neurodegenerative diseases is crucial, with ongoing studies 
aiming for selective, potent molecules with fewer side effects and multimodal 
therapies.

OBJECTIVES: To observe the effects of electroacupuncture (EA) on anxiety-like 
behavior, learning and memory ability and expressions of myelin-related proteins 
in the hippocampus of senescence accelerated mice prone 8 (SAMP8), so as to 
explore the mechanism of EA in improving Alzheimer's disease (AD) from the 
perspective of myelin sheath injury and regeneration.
METHODS: Twenty-four male SAMP8 mice were randomly and equally divided into 
model group and EA group. Twelve male SAMR1 mice of the same age as SAMP8 mice 
were used as the control group. The rats in the EA group received acupuncture at 
"Baihui" (GV20), "Dazhui" (GV14) and "Shenshu" (BL23), among which GV14 and BL23 
received EA intervention (1.5-2 mA, 2 Hz), the intervention lasted for 20 min 
once daily for a total of 3 courses, with every 8 d as a course and an interval 
of 2 d between each 2 courses. The anxiety-like behavior of mice was observed by 
open field test. The learning and memory ability of mice was observed by Morris 
water maze test. The neuronal demyelination in the hippocampus of mice was 
observed after luxol fast blue(LFB) staining. The positive expressions of myelin 
basic protein (MBP) and myelin protein lipid protein (PLP) in hippocampal CA1 
region were detected by immunofluorescence. The mRNA expression levels of MBP, 
chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (NG2) and PLP, and the protein expression 
levels of myelin-associated proteins MBP, NG2, PLP, myelin-associated 
glycoprotein (MAG) and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) in the 
hippocampus were detected by qPCR and Western blot, respevtively.
RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the activity distance and activity 
time in the central region in open field test of the model group were 
significantly shortened (P<0.01), the escape latency of the Morris water maze 
test was prolonged (P<0.01), the number of crossing the original platform and 
the residence time in the original platform quadrant were decreased (P<0.01). 
The LFB staining in the hippocampus was shallow, the myelin fibers were sparse, 
the positive expressions of MBP and PLP in the hippocampal CA1 region, and the 
mRNA expression levels of MBP, NG2 and PLP, as well as the protein expression 
levels of MBP, NG2, PLP, MAG and MOG in the hippocampus were significantly 
decreased (P<0.01) in the model group than those of the control group. After the 
acupuncture or EA interventions, the activity distance and activity time in the 
central region in open field test of the mice in the EA group were significantly 
prolonged (P<0.01) , the escape latency of the Morris water maze test was 
shortened (P<0.01) , the number of crossing the original platform and the 
residence time in the original platform quadrant were increased (P<0.01) , the 
LFB staining in the hippocampus was deepened, the myelin fibers were arranged 
more densely, the positive expression levels of MBP and PLP in the hippocampal 
CA1 region, and the mRNA expression levels of MBP, NG2 and PLP in the 
hippocampus, and the protein expression levels of MBP, NG2, PLP, MAG and MOG in 
the hippocampus were all increased (P<0.01, P<0.05) in the EA group relative to 
the model group.
CONCLUSIONS: EA can improve the anxiety-like behavior and learning and memory 
ability of SAMP8 mice, which may be related to its effects in improving myelin 
regeneration via up-regulating myelin-related proteins expressions in the 
hippocampus.

(1)Global Pharma Segment, Phillips Medisize, Cambridge, UK.

This Industry Update covers the period from 1st October through to 31 October 
2024 and is based on information sourced from company press releases, scientific 
literature, patents, and various news websites. This month saw two biotech 
company acquisitions being made by larger biopharma companies with Modifi 
Biosciences, a company focussing on the development of novel small molecule 
anticancer therapeutics, being acquired Merck, and AbbVie acquiring Aliada 
Therapeutics, which focuses on the treatment of central nervous system 
disorders. Elektrofi and Archon Biosciences both announced new investments, 
respectively, to support the development of novel high concentration 
subcutaneous drug delivery technology and for the development Antibody cages for 
therapeutic applications. GSK and Cambridge University announced a new five-year 
collaboration focusing on kidney and respiratory disease, and Aeropump and 
Resyca announced the launch of a new soft mist nasal delivery system that they 
have been jointly developing. UCB gained FDA approval for a higher dose of its 
injectable drug, BIMZELX for the treatment of autoimmune disorders, and AbbVie 
FDA approval for a continuous infusion treatment for Parkinson's Disease. Eisai 
announced it has completed its submission to the FDA for a subcutaneous version 
of its already approved therapy for Alzheimer's Disease. Clinical research 
updates included Johnson and Johnson announcing termination of a Phase III trial 
evaluating an implanted combination device for the treatment of bladder cancer, 
and Lilly announced positive results for modified dosing regimen for its 
approved Alzheimer's drug, Kisunla (donanemab).In October, the PDA held its 
annual Universe of Prefilled Syringes conference at which several updates on 
developments in injectable drug delivery were made. Scientific updates relating 
to therapeutic delivery included: a controlled drug delivery technology that 
enables a complete course of antibiotics to be delivered; a new lipid-based 
delivery system that improves the safety and efficacy of gene therapies; and the 
use of tiny controllable robots to enable targeted drug delivery of multiple 
therapeutics.

BACKGROUND: Our knowledge of the importance of flavonoid-rich foods in 
preventing unhealthy aging across its different domains is limited.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to examine prospective associations between 
flavonoid-rich food and flavonoid intakes and indicators of unhealthy aging, 
namely frailty, impaired physical function, and poor mental health.
METHODS: We followed up 62,743 females and 23,687 males, all aged ≥60 y, from 
the Nurses' Health Study (1990-2014) and Health Professionals Follow-up Study 
(2006-2018), respectively. Both time-updated and change in intakes of a 
flavodiet score (an aggregate of intakes of major flavonoid-rich foods and 
beverages) and individual flavonoid-rich foods and beverages and time-updated 
intakes of total flavonoids and flavonoid subclasses were calculated from food 
frequency questionnaires collected at baseline and every subsequent 4 y. 
Associations with incident frailty, impaired physical function, and poor mental 
health, assessed from self-reported questionnaire responses, were examined with 
multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models.
RESULTS: In the Nurses' Health Study, participants with the highest flavodiet 
scores, compared with the lowest, had a 15% lower risk of frailty (HRQ5vsQ1: 
0.85; 95%CI: 0.80, 0.90), a 12% lower risk of impaired physical function 
(HRQ5vsQ1: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.84, 0.91), and a 12% lower risk of poor mental health 
(HRQ5vsQ1: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.82, 0.94). Increases in flavodiet scores and both 
higher intakes and increases in intakes of tea, red wine, apples, blueberries, 
and oranges tended to be associated with lower risks of all outcomes. Higher 
intakes of total flavonoids and all flavonoid subclasses tended to be associated 
with a lower risk of each outcome. Although fewer associations were observed 
among males in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, those with the highest 
flavodiet scores had a lower risk of poor mental health.
CONCLUSIONS: High intakes of flavonoid-rich foods may support healthy aging. 
Further research is needed, including examining sex-specific associations, as 
incorporating flavonoid-rich foods in the diet may be a simple strategy to 
support healthy aging.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to identify best practices for 
nursing home (NH) virtual care conferences using Me & My Wishes-videos that 
document care preferences of residents, including those living with Alzheimer's 
disease and related dementias. Videos are shared during care conferences with 
care partners and staff to ensure that the care provided aligns with the 
resident's wishes, especially as they approach the end of life.
DESIGN: A qualitative descriptive design involving focus groups providing the 
perspective of 3 groups (people living with dementia, NH staff, and care 
partners) was used to determine what makes a successful care conference when the 
care conference is conducted virtually.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Convenience sampling was used to recruit focus group 
participants (ie, community advisors) from various geographic locations. 
Recruitment was facilitated through established relationships with community 
partner groups. Advisors included NH leaders, community-dwelling older adults, 
and care partners.
METHODS: Six virtual focus group sessions were conducted from February to June 
2023. A semistructured guide was used to identify key factors of successful 
virtual care conferences when using the Me & My Wishes intervention. Sessions 
were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using content analysis.
RESULTS: Three domains for successful virtual care conferences were identified. 
They are resident-driven, engaging, and structured. They include 
interdisciplinary care team members most familiar with the resident, prioritize 
the needs and preferences of residents to ensure they are central to the 
discussion, and encourage active participation of residents and care partners. 
Finally, care conferences are led by trained facilitators, with the entire 
interdisciplinary care team receiving training on conducting and participating 
in care conferences, including providing technology support to maximize resident 
and care partner engagement.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Successful care conferences, whether in-person or 
virtual, require structured approaches that prioritize resident involvement and 
include people who know the resident best.

Art-based interventions for people living with dementia have been successful in 
improving diverse areas of quality of life and care. Within the spectrum of 
art-based interventions, poetry has shown an impact on communication, 
socialization, and the regulation of behavioral outcomes. This scoping review 
aims to identifying and analyzing how and in what contexts poetry has been used 
as a form of therapy for people living with dementia and their caregivers. It 
also looks at the methodology, design, and outcomes. After screening 1106 
articles across multiple databases, 23 underwent full-text review, and six were 
included in the final extraction. Inclusion criteria focused on people living 
with dementia aged 50+ and/or their family caregivers, encompassing any form of 
language-based poetry intervention (e.g., written, spoken word). Both completed 
and ongoing original research reporting intervention outcomes in peer-reviewed 
articles or certain types of grey literature were considered. The review covers 
literature published between 1993 and 2023. Additional details on the poetry 
interventions including collaboration, facilitation, duration, and underlying 
theory, were also extracted. The findings highlight the effectiveness of poetry 
interventions for people living with dementia and their caregivers as 
person-centered activities fostering personhood and social connectedness. 
Particularly spoken-word poetry-based programs showed positive impacts on 
participants' self-expression, personhood, and agency. Two main barriers for 
wider dissemination were identified. First, methodology and outcome reporting 
conventions in some extracted studies diverge from broader biomedical/health and 
social science norms. Second, study design and data analysis are not reported in 
ways that evidence of programs' impact can be assessed and supported. 
Additionally, there is a lack of literature focused on the development and 
implementation of poetry-based intervention programs aimed at serving 
under-represented and minority populations. Recommendations for future projects 
include multidisciplinary collaborations, diversifying methodological 
approaches, and attention to cross-cultural approaches to program development 
and implementation.

By exposing genes associated with disease, genomic studies provide hundreds of 
starting points that should lead to druggable processes. However, our ability to 
systematically translate these genomic findings into biological pathways remains 
limited. Here, we combine rapid loss-of-function mutagenesis of Alzheimer's risk 
genes and behavioural pharmacology in zebrafish to predict disrupted processes 
and candidate therapeutics. FramebyFrame, our expanded package for the analysis 
of larval behaviours, revealed that decreased night-time sleep was common to F0 
knockouts of all four late-onset Alzheimer's risk genes tested. We developed an 
online tool, ZOLTAR, which compares any behavioural fingerprint to a library of 
fingerprints from larvae treated with 3677 compounds. ZOLTAR successfully 
predicted that sorl1 mutants have disrupted serotonin signalling and identified 
betamethasone as a drug which normalises the excessive day-time sleep of 
presenilin-2 knockout larvae with minimal side effects. Predictive behavioural 
pharmacology offers a general framework to rapidly link disease-associated genes 
to druggable pathways.

Tauopathies are a heterogeneous mixture of neurodegenerative disorders, 
including Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), characterised 
by the accumulation of tau filaments in brain tissue. Tau protein aggregation is 
inhibited by hydromethylthionine (HMT), an effect that appeared to be prevented 
in clinical trials for subjects already receiving acetylcholinesterase 
inhibitors or memantine. Since neuroinflammatory responses are associated with 
tauopathies, we investigated the effect of HMT on the brain immune response and 
inflammatory status in line 66 (L66) mice, an FTD-like model overexpressing 
human tau, in the presence of memantine. We determined whether HMT (5 and 
15 mg·kg-1), either singly or combined with memantine (20 mg·kg-1), would have a 
sustained impact on neuroinflammation following the cessation of drug 
administration. The levels of core tau fragments in L66+/- mice 
(P301S/G335D-hTau) were decreased in a dose-dependent manner 12 weeks after the 
last administration of HMT, an effect that was not affected by memantine. HMT 
lowered the levels of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), thus favouring an 
environment conducive to neuronal protection and repair. HMT sustained increased 
microglial reactivity after its discontinuation, which may assist in the removal 
of tau aggregates, but co-administration with memantine prevented the 
HMT-sustained activation of microglia. These findings indicate that HMT has a 
beneficial effect in reducing neuroinflammation that accompanies a decrease in 
the accumulation of truncated tau species and that these benefits are not 
susceptible to interference by memantine. In turn, the nature of drug 
interference between HMT and memantine seems to be independent of tau and 
related to microglia reactivity.

IMPORTANCE: Understanding the characteristics of discordance between plasma 
biomarkers and positron emission tomography (PET) results in Alzheimer disease 
(AD) is crucial for accurate interpretation of the findings.
OBJECTIVE: To compare (1) medical comorbidities affecting plasma biomarker 
concentrations, (2) imaging and clinical features, and (3) cognitive changes 
between plasma biomarker and PET discordant and concordant cases.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multicenter cohort study, conducted 
between 2016 and 2023, included individuals with unimpaired cognition, mild 
cognitive impairment, or Alzheimer-type dementia, who had both amyloid β (Aβ) 
PET imaging and plasma biomarkers. A subset of participants also underwent tau 
PET imaging.
EXPOSURES: Participants were categorized into 4 groups based on their plasma and 
PET biomarker results: plasma-/PET-, plasma+/PET-, plasma-/PET+, and 
plasma+/PET+.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Clinical characteristics were compared between the 4 
groups, focusing on the discordant groups.
RESULTS: A total of 2611 participants (mean [SD] age was 71.2 [8.7] years; 1656 
female [63.4%]), of whom 124 additionally underwent tau PET, were included. 
Among the plasma biomarkers, phosphorylated tau (p-tau) 217 exhibited the 
highest concordance rate with Aβ (2326 of 2571 [90.5%]) and tau (100 of 120 
[83.3%]) PET. The p-tau217+/Aβ PET- group was older (mean [SD] age, 75.8 [7.2] 
years vs 70.0 [8.8] years; P < .001) with a higher prevalence of hypertension 
(56 of 152 [36.8%] vs 266 of 1073 [25.0%]), diabetes (40 of 152 [26.3%] vs 156 
of 1059 [14.7%]), and chronic kidney disease (17 of 152 [11.2%] vs 21 of 1073 
[2.0%]) compared with the p-tau217-/Aβ PET- group (P < .001 for all). Body mass 
index was higher in p-tau217-/Aβ PET+ than in p-tau217+/Aβ PET+ (mean [SD], 
24.1 [2.8] vs 23.1 [3.1], respectively; P = .001; calculated as weight in 
kilograms divided by height in meters squared). The p-tau217+/Aβ PET- group had 
lower hippocampal volume (mean [SD], 2555.4 [576.9] vs 2979.1 [545.8]; P < .001) 
and worse clinical trajectory compared with p-tau217-/Aβ PET- (β = -0.53; 
P < .001). In contrast, tau PET discordant cases did not show significant 
differences in medical comorbidities or clinical outcomes compared with the 
p-tau217-/tau PET- group. Only the p-tau 217+/tau PET+ group demonstrated faster 
cognitive deterioration compared with the p-tau 217-/tau PET- group (β = -1.66; 
P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Results of this cohort study suggest that the 
mechanisms underlying the discordance between plasma biomarkers and PET findings 
may be multifaceted, underscoring the need to consider the temporal dynamics and 
biological variability of plasma biomarkers.

IMPORTANCE: The etiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a fatal 
neurodegenerative disease, is unknown. However, neuroinflammation and complement 
activation may play a role in disease progression.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of zilucoplan, an inhibitor of complement 
C5, in individuals with ALS.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Zilucoplan was tested as regimen A of the 
HEALEY ALS Platform Trial, a phase 2 to 3 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled perpetual platform clinical trial with sharing of trial 
infrastructure and placebo data across multiple regimens. Regimen A was 
conducted from August 17, 2020, to May 4, 2022. A total of 162 participants were 
randomized to receive zilucoplan (122 [75.3%]) or regimen-specific placebo (40 
[24.7%]). An additional 124 concurrently randomized participants were randomized 
to receive placebo in other regimens.
INTERVENTIONS: Eligible participants were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive 
zilucoplan or matching placebo within strata of edaravone and/or riluzole use 
for a planned duration of 24 weeks. Active drug (zilucoplan, 0.3 mg/kg) and 
placebo were provided for daily subcutaneous dosing.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was change in disease severity 
from baseline through 24 weeks as measured by the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis 
Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) total score and survival, analyzed 
using a bayesian shared-parameter model and reported as disease rate ratio (DRR; 
<1 indicating treatment benefit). The study included prespecified rules for 
early stopping for futility. Outcome analyses were performed in the full 
analysis set comparing the zilucoplan group with the total shared placebo group 
(n = 164).
RESULTS: Among the 162 participants who were randomized (mean [SD] age, 59.6 
[11.3]; 99 [61.1%] male), 115 (71.0%) completed the trial. The estimated DRR 
common to ALSFRS-R and survival was 1.08 (95% credible interval, 0.87-1.31; 
posterior probability of superiority, 0.24). The trial was stopped early for 
futility. No unexpected treatment-related risks were identified.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial of zilucoplan in 
ALS, treatment did not alter disease progression. The adaptive platform design 
of the HEALEY ALS Platform Trial made it possible to test a new investigational 
product with efficient use of time and resources.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04297683.

Both iron metabolism and ferroptosis (an iron-dependent form of programmed cell 
death) have been connected to the development and progression of many currently 
incurable non-communicable diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's 
disease, multiple sclerosis, Huntington's disease, metabolic 
dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, heart failure, and both 
treatment-relapsed and refractory cancers, such as pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinoma and triple-negative breast cancer. Thus, understanding the 
relationship between iron and these diseases can pave the way for the 
development of novel therapeutic strategies. Here, we summarize the latest 
evidence supporting the pathological roles of dysregulated iron metabolism and 
ferroptosis in a wide range of preclinical animal models of these currently 
incurable non-communicable diseases. We also summarize the feasibility of 
targeting iron metabolism and ferroptosis for the prevention and treatment of 
iron- and ferroptosis-related diseases that currently have limited treatment 
options. In addition, we provide our perspectives on the challenges and promises 
regarding the translational potential of targeting dysregulated iron metabolism 
and ferroptosis to treat diseases, highlighting the future roadmap for 
developing iron- and ferroptosis-targeted therapeutics.

Human MutT homolog 1 (MTH1) plays a crucial role in sanitizing oxidized DNA 
precursors by enzymatically hydrolyzing oxidized nucleotides. The absence of 
MTH1 activity in the cells results in the accumulation of oxidized nucleotides 
within the nucleus and mitochondria, leading to mutations, abnormal proteins, 
and neurodegeneration (in the central nervous system). It has garnered interest 
as a potential target for anticancer treatment through targeted inhibitor 
molecules but remains largely understudied in other neurological disorders. This 
review explores the understanding of MTH1 expression in glioma and its potential 
role in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's 
disease, and Huntington's disease concerning disease mechanism and prognosis. 
Neurodegeneration, activation of glial cells, and mitochondrial dysfunction are 
common mechanisms involved in the progression of these diseases. This review 
also tries to identify the unexplored associations and research gaps that can 
reveal novel applications of the enzyme in epilepsy, in which MTH1 is studied 
less. The influence of the ROS environment and cell type on MTH1 expression and 
function is crucial to be studied for elucidating its role in a multitude of CNS 
pathologies. The involvement of microglial cell-mediated inflammatory responses 
through ROS production in epileptogenesis in mouse models highlights the 
interplay between oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in epilepsy. The 
possible existence of a similar association between MTH1 expression and 
pathogenesis of the discussed neurological disorders in vivo demands further 
exploration preclinically and in patient samples.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major neurodegenerative disorder characterized by 
progressive cognitive decline. Among various experimental models, 
scopolamine-induced amnesia is widely used to mimic memory dysfunction. 
Pioglitazone (PG), a thiazolidinedione derivative, has recently demonstrated 
neuroprotective potential in neurodegenerative conditions. This study aimed to 
evaluate the potential benefits of PG in mitigating scopolamine-induced 
cholinergic dysfunction and the associated memory and learning deficits in male 
Wistar rats. Fifty male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to five groups: (1) 
Control, (2) Scopolamine, and (3-5) three treatment groups receiving daily 
injections of PG at doses of 20, 40, or 60 mg/kg for three weeks in addition to 
scopolamine administration. Cognitive impairment was induced using scopolamine 
in all groups except the control. Cognitive function was assessed using the 
Morris water maze (MWM) and passive avoidance (PA) tests. Biochemical analyses 
were conducted to measure malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), 
total thiol levels, and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in the cortex and 
hippocampus. Additionally, mRNA expression levels of inflammatory markers 
(TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) were evaluated in the hippocampus. Scopolamine induced 
cognitive impairment, increased MDA levels and AChE activity, decreased SOD 
activity and thiol levels, and elevated mRNA expression of inflammatory 
cytokines. PG significantly reversed these effects by enhancing performance in 
the MWM and PA tests, reducing MDA levels and AChE activity, and increasing SOD 
activity and total thiol concentration. Additionally, PG downregulated TNF-α, 
IL-1β, and IL-6 expression in brain tissue. The present behavioral and 
neurochemical findings suggest that PG ameliorates scopolamine-induced memory 
impairment by reducing oxidative stress and neuroinflammation while enhancing 
cholinergic function.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder 
characterised by several factors, such as impaired glutamate neurotransmission 
affecting crucial functions. Neural stem cells (NSCs) are present in the adult 
brains of all mammalian species and contribute to the continuous generation of 
neural cells throughout life. The disruption of glutamate levels during the 
development of AD could impact NSCs' functionality, influencing their response 
to the microenvironment. In this work, we isolated adult neural stem cells from 
both triple transgenic (3xTg)-AD mice and age-matched wild type (WT) mice in 
order to gather information on any differences between them, particularly 
concerning the potential mechanisms involved in the internalisation of glutamate 
and its utilisation for energy production. The 3xTg model offers the ability to 
recapitulate human pathology with both plaque and tangle hallmarks that are 
involved in the process of glutamate release. In vitro culture 3xTg NSCs showed 
a slight morphological difference compared to WT cells and a massive reduction 
of proliferation and viability. Furthermore, 3xTg NSCs displayed an increase in 
the expression of glutamate transporters and glutamine synthetase, while 
glutamate dehydrogenase did not show any reduction, which is typical in AD 
brains. Data obtained from this basic research study suggest a possible 
involvement of glutamate in the cellular energy balance, indicating an attempted 
response of NSCs to the cytotoxic microenvironment in the early stage of AD 
pathology. This finding is of great interest, as it corroborates the hypothesis 
that targeting the glutamatergic system could be an extremely promising strategy 
for new therapeutics in AD.

OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether the use of antihypertensive medication (AHM) 
is associated with in vivo Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathologies in older adults 
with hypertension and examined if the effect differs by drug-class and 
blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability of the drug.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study recruited participants from the Korean Brain 
Aging Study for the Early Diagnosis and Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease. 
Participants comprised both cognitively normal and impaired older adults 
diagnosed with hypertension (n = 408). All participants underwent comprehensive 
clinical assessment and [11C] Pittsburgh Compound B positron emission tomography 
(PET) for measurement of cerebral β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition. Additionally, a 
subset of participants (n = 120) was subjected to [18F] AV-1451 PET to assess 
tau deposition.
RESULTS: The AHM group (n = 227) exhibited significantly lower Aβ deposition (B 
[SE] = -0.104 [0.037], p = 0.006) compared to the non-AHM group (n = 181), even 
after controlling for age, sex, apolipoprotein E ε4-positivity, vascular risk 
factors, and mean arterial blood pressure. Further analysis by AHM class showed 
an association between the use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASi) and 
less Aβ deposition (B [SE] = -0.143[0.049], p = 0.004). No significant 
relationships were observed between the use of BBB-permeable AHM and Aβ 
deposition. Additionally, associations between AHM use and tau deposition did 
not reach statistical significance.
INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that AHM use may be associated with lower 
Aβ burden in older adults with hypertension. Further studies exploring the 
underlying mechanism, particularly related to RASi, may provide insights into 
new therapeutic targets for AD. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:1051-1061.

Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) consist of progressive 
illnesses of central nervous system that primarily affect the elderly and are 
characterized by movement symptoms, memory decline, and cognitive impairment. A 
number of variables, including the lack of a novel treatment, a steady rise in 
the patient population, and the high expense of care and treatment, have 
contributed to the growing significance of these diseases. In recent decades, we 
have gained a better understanding of the causes of diseases, but complex 
mechanisms of neuronal loss, combined with physiological factors that are 
incompatible, pose challenges in describing the pathogenic processes and 
devising effective treatments. Currently, there are no known treatments for most 
of these diseases, rendering them incurable. Therefore, there is a pressing need 
for therapeutic interventions that have the potential to effectively treat 
neurodegeneration. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the ayurvedic 
herb Bacopa monnieri bioactive components against the therapeutic targets HTR1A, 
HTR1B, HTR2A, HTR2C, HTR7, alpha-synuclein, amyloid beta, and tau protein of 
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's illnesses. The docking analysis revealed the 
promising binding affinity with Quercetin, Apigenin, and Luteolin and Molecular 
mechanics/generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) further confirmed the 
stability of the complexes. In vitro investigation indicated that Quercetin is 
the most effective for treating AD and PD due to its considerable inhibition of 
alpha-synuclein production, whereas Luteolin is the favorable one for preventing 
both diseases by mitigating effects during Rotenone treatment. The future 
implications and constraints of the current study suggest that further 
validation in Invivo models of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases is necessary 
to investigate the effects of Quercetin and Apigenin in the treatment of these 
conditions, as well as Luteolin and Quercetin for their prevention.

Amylin is an amyloidogenic neuroendocrine hormone co-synthesized and co-secreted 
with insulin from the pancreas. It readily crosses the blood-brain barrier and 
synergistically forms mixed amyloid plaques with β-amyloid (Aβ) in brain 
parenchyma. Parenchymal amylin-Aβ plaques are found in both sporadic and 
early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet their (patho)physiological 
role remains elusive, particularly due to a lack of detection modalities for 
these mixed plaques. Previously, we developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay (ELISA) capable of detecting amylin-Aβ hetero-oligomers in brain lysate 
and blood using a polyclonal anti-amylin antibody to capture hetero-oligomers 
and a monoclonal anti-Aβ mid-domain detection antibody combination. This 
combination allows for the recognition of distinct amylin epitopes, which remain 
accessible after amylin-Aβ oligomerization has begun, and precise detection of 
Aβ epitopes available after oligomer formation. The utility of this assay is 
evidenced in our previous report, wherein differences in hetero-oligomer content 
in brain tissue from patients with and without AD and patients with and without 
diabetes were distinguished. Additionally, using AD model rats, we provided 
evidence that our assay can be employed for the detection of amylin-Aβ in blood. 
This assay and protocol are important innovations in the field of AD research 
because they meet an unmet need to detect mixed amyloid plaques that, if 
targeted therapeutically, could reduce AD progression and severity. Key features 
• Detects amylin-Aβ hetero-oligomers in blood from patients with Alzheimer's 
disease. • Enables simultaneous, high-throughput analysis of hetero-oligomer 
content of brain and blood tissue. • Allows exploration into the amylin-Aβ 
interaction during AD pathogenesis, potentially leading to novel treatment 
mechanisms by controlling the amylin-Aβ interaction.

BACKGROUND: Danggui-Shaoyao-San (DSS) is a traditional Chinese medicine 
prescription with a history of nearly 2000 years, originally widely used for 
gynecological diseases, and in recent years research has found that DSS also has 
a good therapeutic effect on Alzheimer's disease (AD).
PURPOSE: The objective is to investigate the metabolic components of the DSS in 
the blood and the potential mechanisms for AD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Liquid chromatography‒mass spectrometry (LC-MS) combined 
with gas chromatography‒mass spectrometry (GC-MS) based non-targeted 
metabolomics were used to conduct in-depth research. Serum Pharmacology was used 
to analyze potential mechanisms of DSS for AD. C57BL/6J mice and Hippocampal 
neuronal cell line (HT-22) were used to prepare the AD model. Enzyme linked 
immunosorbent assay (Elisa), quantitative polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR), 
Morris water maze,Western blot (WB), Immunohistochemical and Immunofluorescence 
were used to study the effect of DSS on AD. Flow cytometry and Cell Counting 
Kit-8 (CCK-8) reveal the effect of DSS serum on HT-22 proliferation and 
apoptosis.
RESULTS: A total of 57 metabolic components were screened in DSS serum. Serum 
Pharmacology revealed that the calcium signaling pathway and cAMP/PKA/CREB 
pathway may be a potential mechanism through which DSS treated AD. DSS can 
reduce aberrant phosphorylation of Tau and modulates cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway to 
improve cognition and apoptosis in AD mice. DSS serum can increase the cell 
viability of HT-22 and reduce apoptosis mainly by alleviating mitochondrial 
calcium overloading.
CONCLUSION: DSS can modulate the calcium signaling pathway and enhance the 
cAMP/PKA/CREB signaling pathway to ameliorate Tau aberrant phosphorylation, 
cognitive deficits and neuronal apoptosis after AD.

1,2,4-Oxadiazoles are well recognized for their exceptional physical, chemical, 
and pharmacokinetic properties, making them promising candidates for various 
therapeutic applications. These include treatments for cystic fibrosis, Duchenne 
muscular dystrophy, Alzheimer's disease, and a broad spectrum of other 
therapeutic interventions such as antituberculosis, anticancer, antibiotic, 
anti-inflammatory, and anticonvulsant activities. In this study, single crystals 
of a novel 1,2,4-oxadiazole derivative, 
methyl-4-(5-(4-(octyloxy)phenyl)-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)benzoate, were grown by a 
slow evaporation technique. The structural elucidation was performed using X-ray 
diffraction analysis, confirming the compound's crystalline structure in the 
triclinic system. The analysis revealed a linear conformation with bond lengths 
closely aligned with Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) averages, signifying 
high precision in the molecular structure. A detailed CSD study identified nine 
principal configurations of the phenyl octyloxy moiety, underscoring the 
structural diversity of the compound. Hirshfeld surface analysis highlighted the 
predominance of C-H···O and C-H···π interactions, with dispersion energy playing 
a critical role in stabilizing the crystal lattice. Docking studies against key 
microbial targets, particularly E. coli FabH, demonstrated superior binding 
energies, suggesting significant antimicrobial potential. The comprehensive 
suite of structural and computational analyses underscores the potential of the 
synthesized 1,2,4-oxadiazole derivative, which may be one of the promising 
candidates for antimicrobial drug development. Future in vitro, in vivo studies 
will be supportive in optimizing the derivative for enhanced efficacy and 
further elucidating its pharmacological mechanisms, paving the way for potential 
clinical applications. This study not only provides insights into the structural 
and functional properties of a novel 1,2,4-oxadiazole derivative but also 
highlights its promising role in antimicrobial drug discovery.

Lecanemab and donanemab have received full U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) approval, and subsequently, lecanemab has been approved by the Korean FDA 
and it has recently entered commercial use in Korea. This has increased interest 
in anti-amyloid immunotherapy for Alzheimer's disease. Anti-amyloid 
immunotherapy has shown potential to modify the progression of the disease by 
specifically binding to amyloid β, a key pathological product in Alzheimer's 
disease, and eliminating accumulated amyloid plaques in the brain. However, this 
treatment can be accompanied by a side-effect, amyloid-related imaging 
abnormalities (ARIA), which requires periodic monitoring by MRI. It is crucial 
to detect ARIA and accurately assess the severity by radiology. The role of the 
radiologist is important in this context, requiring proficiency in basic 
knowledge of ARIA, and in diagnosing/evaluating ARIA. This review aims to 
comprehensively cover aspects of ARIA, including its definition, 
pathophysiology, incidence, risk factors, assessment of severity by radiology, 
differential diagnosis, and management.

있다. ARIA의 영상적 중등도는 ARIA의 유형, 병변의 크기와 개수에 따라 경도, 중등도, 중증으로 구분하며, 동반된 증상과 종합하여 치료 
방향을 정한다. 따라서 치료 중 시행되는 MRI 검사에서 ARIA를 조기에 진단하고, 정확한 영상적 중증도 평가가 중요하다. 이에 ARIA에 
대한 기본 지식을 숙지하고, ARIA 고위험군을 선별하고, 치료 중 모니터링에서 ARIA를 정확하게 진단 및 평가할 수 있어야 한다. 본 종설은

[Diagnosis and Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease: Current Update].

[Article in Korean]

Yim Y, Moon WJ.

Alzheimer's disease, one of the most common causes of dementia, places a 
significant socioeconomic burden on aging societies. Encouragingly, extensive 
research on this neurocognitive disorder has finally uncovered the underpinnings 
of its pathophysiology, igniting a new era of treatment possibilities. 
Furthermore, the advent of amyloid PET imaging has allowed diagnosis of the 
amyloid pathology, the underlying cause of Alzheimer's disease. Notwithstanding 
the initial setback with aducanumab, the subsequent full FDA approval of two 
anti-amyloid antibody drugs (Lecanemab and Donanemab) has revolutionized the 
treatment landscape. These disease-modifying drugs are designed to target and 
remove beta-amyloid. This review covers the updated diagnostic criteria for 
Alzheimer's disease and discusses recent developments in treatment strategies, 
including these new disease-modifying drugs.

알츠하이머병(Alzheimer’s disease)은 치매의 가장 흔한 원인 중 하나이며, 고령화 사회에 상당한 사회경제적 부담을 지우는 치명적인 
질환이다. 최근 알츠하이머병에 대한 광범위한 연구를 통해 마침내 병태생리학적 원인이 밝혀지고, 새로운 치료의 시대가 열리고 있다. 더욱이, 
아밀로이드 PET 영상의 등장으로 알츠하이머병의 근본 원인인 아밀로이드 병리를 진단하는 것이 가능해졌다. 아두카누밥의 초기 실패에도 불구하고, 
이후 두 가지 항 아밀로이드 항체 약물(레카네맙과 도나네맙)이 FDA의 완전한 승인을 받으면서 알츠하이머 치료 환경이 극적으로 변화하였다. 
이러한 질병 조절 치료제(disease-modifying drug)는 베타 아밀로이드를 표적으로 하여 제거하도록 설계되었다. 본 종설에서는 최근 
개정된 알츠하이머 진단 기준을 다루고, 새로운 질병 조절 치료제를 포함한 치료 전략의 발전 동향에 대해 논의하고자 한다.

Therapy for Alzheimer's Disease: Expert Recommendation for Standard MRI 
Protocol].

Moon WJ; KSNR Aging and NeuroDegeneration Imaging (ANDI) Study Group.

The introduction of anti-amyloid therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD), such as 
lecanemab (Lequembi®), which was recently approved in Korea, necessitates 
careful monitoring for amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) using brain 
MRI. To optimize ARIA monitoring in Korean clinical settings, the Korean Society 
of Neuroradiology (KSNR) and the Age and Neurodegeneration Imaging (ANDI) Study 
Group proposed MRI protocol recommendations on essential MR sequences, MRI 
acquisition parameters, timing and condition of MRI examinations, and essential 
details to provide a scientific basis for maximizing the safety and efficacy of 
AD treatment. A customized, standardized MRI protocol focusing on Korea's 
healthcare environment can improve ARIA management and ensure patient safety 
through early detection of potential anti-amyloid therapy side effects, thereby 
enhancing treatment quality.

알츠하이머병(Alzheimer’s disease; 이하 AD)의 항아밀로이드 치료제 도입으로 뇌 자기공명영상(이하 MRI)을 기반으로 한 
아밀로이드 관련 영상 이상(amyloid-related imaging abnormalities; 이하 ARIA)에 대한 모니터링의 중요성이 
커졌다. 특히, 우리나라에서도 항아밀로이드 치료제 중 하나인 레카네맙(lecanemab, 상품명 Lequembi® 레켐비)이AD 치료에 도입됨에 
따라, 대한신경두경부영상의학회와 퇴행성신경질환영상연구회가 국내 실정에 적합한 ARIA 모니터링을 위한 MRI 프로토콜 전문가 권고안을 개발하여 
제시하고자 한다. 필수적인 MRI 시퀀스, MRI 촬영 변수, MRI 검사 시기 및 조건, 그리고 MRI 판독 시 필수 사항에 대한 권고안은 
AD 치료의 안전성과 효과성을 극대화하기 위한 과학적 근거를 제공할 것이다. 한국의 의료 환경을 반영한 맞춤형 표준화 MRI 프로토콜을 통해 
ARIA 관리 방안을 개선하고, 항아밀로이드 치료제의 잠재적 부작용을 조기에 감지하여 환자 안전을 보장하고 치료의 질을 향상시킬 수 있을 
것이다.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by excess androgens, ovulatory 
disorders and a higher prevalence of obesity and metabolic disturbances 
including Type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidaemia and hypertension, some of which are 
risk factors for neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and 
brain atrophy. However, it is unclear whether brain ageing occurs more rapidly 
in women with PCOS compared with those without PCOS. Except for the 
hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis involved in the conventional ovulatory 
process, little is known regarding the role of the grey matter in the 
pathogenesis of PCOS, and limited existing studies examining brain structures in 
PCOS have shown inconsistent results. This case-control study aimed to 
investigate the age-related differences in total and regional brain grey matter 
volume and average cortical thickness in young women with and without PCOS by 
using brain magnetic resonance imaging to understand whether women with PCOS 
exhibit distinctive patterns of brain ageing, and their association with factors 
including obesity, hyperandrogenism and metabolic disturbances. Seventy-six 
women diagnosed with PCOS and 68 age-matched women without PCOS (aged 20-35 
years) underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging to measure grey matter volume 
and cortical thickness. Anthropometric, hormonal and metabolic measurements were 
conducted to assess their associations with the investigated brain structures. 
In women without PCOS, increasing age was significantly correlated with a 
decrease in global grey matter volume (r = -0.5598, P < 0.0001), while this 
association was not significant in women with PCOS (r = -0.1475, P = 0.204). The 
decline in grey matter volume with age differed significantly between the two 
groups regardless of obesity (body mass index exceeding 25 kg/m2), especially in 
the frontal, parietal, occipital and temporal regions. After adjusting for 
dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS) levels, the negative association between 
age and global grey matter volume became statistically significant in women with 
PCOS. Increasing age was also significantly associated with a decrease in global 
cortical thickness in women without PCOS, but not in women with PCOS. Such 
negative association between global cortical thickness and age was particularly 
stronger in women with obesity compared with those without. The negative 
association between age and global cortical thickness in women with PCOS became 
pronounced after adjusting for DHEAS levels. Women with PCOS experience a milder 
grey matter loss with age compared with women without PCOS. The neuroprotective 
effect of high DHEAS levels in women with PCOS may be implicated in this 
relationship.

Asthma remains a significant health concern, with increasing incidence rates and 
a notable annual mortality rate. Although the pathophysiology of asthma and its 
impact on the respiratory system are well understood, leading to effective 
symptom control, the broader effects of chronic localized airway inflammation on 
the rest of the body remain less clear. One potential consequence of this 
persistent state is an elevated risk of developing dementia across various 
etiologies, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). This systematic review aims to 
elucidate the underlying mechanisms driving this association, with a particular 
focus on identifying neurodegeneration markers detectable through laboratory and 
imaging studies. Additionally, it examines the impact of asthma treatments on 
this potential risk, exploring their possible contributory role in the 
pathogenesis of dementia. Such insights should inform the development of 
personalized treatment strategies for asthma patients, aimed at preventing or 
delaying the onset of dementia. However, further research is necessary to 
understand the underlying mechanisms of the connection fully and crucial to 
integrate it with routine clinical practice.

Neurological disorders pose significant global public health challenges, with a 
rising prevalence and complex pathophysiological mechanisms that impose 
substantial social and economic burdens. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), 
with its holistic approach and multi-target effects, has gained increasing 
attention in the treatment of neurological diseases. This review explores 
bioactive compounds derived from Chinese herbal plants, focusing on their 
mechanisms of action, underlying pathways, and potential applications in 
functional food development. The review highlights the neuroprotective 
properties of flavonoids, alkaloids, polysaccharides, and polyphenols found in 
key TCM herbs such as Scutellaria baicalensis, Salvia miltiorrhiza, Ligusticum 
chuanxiong, and Gastrodia elata. These compounds have demonstrated significant 
anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neurogenic effects, making them promising 
candidates for the prevention and treatment of neurological conditions, 
including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and depression. 
Furthermore, the synergistic effects of TCM formulations targeting multiple 
signaling pathways offer advantages over single-target therapies, especially in 
combating neurodegenerative diseases. The review also discusses the challenges 
and future directions for integrating these bioactive compounds into functional 
foods and dietary supplements, aiming to improve neurological health and enhance 
clinical outcomes. Ultimately, this work aims to provide valuable insights into 
the potential of TCM-based interventions for promoting neurological well-being 
and addressing the global burden of neurological disorders.

OBJECTIVE: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) orexin-A has been suggested to be a 
biomarker of Alzheimer disease (AD). In both cognitively unimpaired healthy 
older adults and individuals with symptomatic AD, CSF orexin-A is positively 
associated with CSF Aβ42, p-tau181, and total tau (t-tau) concentrations. 
However, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis did not support 
differences in orexin-A between AD and controls. In this study, we tested the 
association between CSF orexin-A concentrations, AD biomarkers, and cognitive 
performance in older adults with and without symptomatic AD.
METHODS: Two hundred and seventy community-dwelling older adults underwent 
standardized cognitive assessments, sleep monitoring with a single-channel 
electroencephalography test, one night of home sleep apnea testing, biofluid and 
imaging AD biomarker measurement within 1 year of sleep monitoring, and APOE 
genotyping. Plasma and CSF AD biomarkers were measured by immunoassay or mass 
spectrometry. CSF orexin-A was measured by radioimmunoassay.
RESULTS: CSF orexin-A levels did not differ by amyloid positivity, cognitive 
status, or AD stage. However, CSF AD biomarkers (Aβ40, Aβ42, and t-tau) were 
positively associated with CSF orexin-A levels even after correction for 
multiple comparisons. CSF orexin-A was not associated with any measure of 
cognitive performance.
INTERPRETATION: This study showed that CSF orexin-A is associated with multiple 
CSF AD biomarkers, but not with AD pathology or cognitive performance. We 
hypothesize that this is due to similar mechanisms of production/release of 
these proteins with sleep-wake activity. Future studies measuring other forms of 
orexin peptides, such as orexin-B, may provide evidence for orexin as a marker 
for AD.

BACKGROUND: A growing body of evidence suggests a link between the gut 
microbiota and Alzheimer's disease (AD), although the underlying mechanisms 
remain elusive. This study aimed to investigate the impact of fecal microbiota 
transplantation (FMT) on cognitive function in a mouse model of AD.
METHODS: Four-month-old 5 × FAD (familial Alzheimer's disease) mice underwent 
antibiotic treatment to deplete their native gut microbiota. Subsequently, they 
received FMT either weekly or every other day. After 8 weeks, cognitive function 
and β-amyloid (Aβ) load were assessed through behavioral testing and 
pathological analysis, respectively. The composition of the gut microbiota was 
analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing.
RESULTS: Initial weekly FMT failed to alleviate memory deficits or reduce brain 
Aβ pathology in 5 × FAD mice. In contrast, FMT administered every other day 
effectively restored gut dysbiosis in 5 × FAD mice and decreased Aβ pathology 
and lipopolysaccharide levels in the colon and hippocampus. Mechanistically, FMT 
reduced the expression of amyloid β precursor protein, β-site APP cleaving 
enzyme 1, and presenilin-1, potentially by inhibiting the Toll-like receptor 
4/inhibitor of kappa B kinase β/nuclear factor kappa-B signaling pathway. 
However, the cognitive benefits of FMT on 5 × FAD mice diminished over time.
CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate the dose- and time-dependent efficacy of 
FMT in mitigating AD-like pathology, underscoring the potential of targeting the 
gut microbiota for AD treatment.

diagnostic criteria known as the MDS-PSP classification. However, little is 
known about the prognostic value of this classification in order to better 
stratify patients for the clinical trials.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of the different clinical phenotypes according 
to the MDS-PSP classification on prognosis using the clinical milestones of 
death, severe dysphagia, institutionalization, and need for walking aid.
METHODS: A prospective cohort of 205 PSP patients from Lille University Hospital 
was analyzed retrospectively. Patients were classified into different MSD-PSP 
phenotypes according to their clinical presentation after 3 years of follow-up. 
The milestones of death, severe dysphagia, institutionalization, and need for 
walking aid were recorded, and a survival analysis was performed to describe the 
prognosis of each disease presentation.
RESULTS: Median survival time was 6.4 (interquartile range (IQR): 4.8-8.6) years 
and mean diagnostic delay from symptom onset was 38.1 ± 22.5 months. PSP 
Richardson Syndrome (PSP-RS) had a poorer survival rate and a higher occurrence 
of severe dysphagia and need for walking aid compared to PSP variants such as 
PSP Parkinsonism (PSP-P), PSP postural instability without ocular motor 
dysfunction (PSP-PI), and other rare phenotypes.
CONCLUSIONS: PSP-RS has a less favorable prognosis compared to PSP variants 
stratified according to the MDS-PSP classification. This classification could 
assist in selecting patients for clinical trials and help design outcomes that 
account for the disease heterogeneity.

Plain Language Summary: Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a rare and 
debilitating neurodegenerative disease marked by diverse combination of motor 
and cognitive symptoms. No treatment is currently available to slow down disease 
progression. The multiple clinical presentations of PSP compromise clinical 
trials. Thus, we aimed to study the differential prognosis of the different 
forms of the disease. We showed that PSP-Richardson Syndrome (PSP-RS), which is 
the most frequent presentation, seems to have a poorer prognosis than other 
variants on survival and other disability criteria such as severe dysphagia 
occurrence. This study suggests that these differences should account to improve 
the design of future clinical trials.

Ginseng is a well-established functional food for brain health. However, its 
active ingredients have not yet been identified. Gintonin is a promising 
compound isolated from white/red ginseng. Its lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is an 
exogenous G protein-coupled LPA receptor (LPAR) agonist. Korean red ginseng marc 
(KRGM) is a by-product after KRG extractions. In a previous study, we 
demonstrated that KRGM-derived gintonin (KRGM-G) contains LPA C[Formula: see 
text], a major functional component of both white and red ginseng. [Formula: see 
text] transgenic mice and SH-SY5Y cells were used to determine molecular 
mechanisms involved in KRGM-G-mediated anti-Alzheimer's disease (AD) effects. 
KRGM-G improved cognition impairment associated with alleviation of amyloid-β 
accumulation in the brain (hippocampus and cortex) in [Formula: see text] mice. 
KRGM-G inhibited activation of inflammatory cells (Iba-1-positive microglia and 
GFAP-positive astrocyte) and expression of pro-inflammatory mediators (IL-1β, 
IL-6, iNOS, or NO) in the brains of [Formula: see text] mice, increased the 
viability of H2O2-induced SH-SY5Y cells, and down-regulated the p38 MAPK, NF-κB 
p65, and STAT3 signaling pathways. KRGM-G also prevented the formation of 
reactive oxygen species and stimulated the Nrf2-HO-1/4-HNE signaling pathway in 
the brains of [Formula: see text] mice and SH-SY5Y cells. Interestingly, these 
positive effects of KRGM-G on AD-related symptoms and immunopathology were 
associated with up-regulation of LPAR1 in the brains of [Formula: see text] 
mice. These results suggest that KRGM-G might improve AD-related cognitive 
dysfunction by stimulating the anti-oxidant pathway (Nrf2) and inhibiting 
inflammatory pathways (p38/NF-κB/STAT3) through LPAR1.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disease that alters 
learning and memory processes. Kalanchoe crenata (Crassulaceae) has long been 
used in Cameroonian traditional medicine to treat hypertension, malaria, and 
dementia. The present study aims to evaluate the anti-amnesic effect of an 
aqueous extract of K. crenata in D-galactose-treated rats and possible 
mechanisms of action.
METHODS: Memory impairment was induced in rats by subcutaneous injection of 
D-galactose (350 mg/kg) once daily for 30 days. At the end of the procedure, the 
animals were assessed for memory impairment using Morris water maze and object 
recognition tasks. Animals with memory impairment were divided into six groups 
of eight rats each and treated once daily for 24 days as follows: the negative 
control group received per os distilled water (10 mL/kg); the positive control 
group received donepezil (2 mg/kg, p.o.); and three test groups received the 
extract of K. crenata (62, 124, and 248 mg/kg, p.o.). A group of eight rats was 
added and served as a control group. After completion of the procedure, the 
memory deficit in rats was reassessed by the object recognition test on Day 15 
of the treatment, the Morris water maze test on Day 18, and the open-field test 
on Day 24. At the end of behavioral experiments, the animals were sacrificed and 
some biochemical parameters in the hippocampus were estimated. In addition, 
histological analysis of the hippocampus was performed.
RESULTS: K. crenata significantly decreased the time to reach the platform and 
increased the time spent in the target quadrant of the Morris water maze. It 
also increased the discrimination index during the object recognition test. The 
extract significantly reversed D-galactose-induced oxidative stress and 
inflammation. This was confirmed by the attenuation of neuronal loss.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that K. crenata extract possesses an 
anti-amnesic-like effect probably mediated by antioxidant and anti-inflammatory 
mechanisms.

BackgroundThe association between androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and 
dementia risk is controversial, and the dose-response relationship between them 
remains unclear.ObjectiveWe aim to further clarify the relationship between ADT 
and dementia risk.MethodsPubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library 
databases were systematically searched up to September 2024 to identify relevant 
studies. A meta-analysis was conducted using hazard ratios (HR) and 95% 
confidence intervals (CI) as pooled indicators. The robust error meta-regression 
(REMR) approach was performed to explore the dose-response relationship. 
Heterogeneity was assessed using I² statistics, and subgroup analysis, 
sensitivity analysis, and meta-regressions were conducted. Publication bias was 
evaluated with a funnel plot and Egger's test.ResultsOur meta-analysis of 21 
studies involving 2,278,835 patients revealed that ADT significantly increased 
the risk of overall dementia (HR = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.06-1.20) and Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) (HR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.06-1.23), but not non-AD dementia (HR = 1.01, 
95% CI: 0.89-1.16). For ADT subtypes, anti-androgens increased the risk of 
overall dementia (HR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.09-1.49), particularly for AD (HR = 1.53, 
95% CI: 1.19-1.97), while Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone therapy and 
bilateral orchiectomy were not linked to the risk of any dementia subtype. A 
bell-shaped non-linear relationship between ADT duration and dementia risk was 
observed, with the highest risk observed at 15.5 to 21.5 months (HR = 1.25), 
which was confirmed by subgroup analysis for AD.ConclusionsThe risk of overall 
dementia and AD were found to be significantly associated with ADT in a 
bell-shaped dose-response effect.

BackgroundThe head turning sign (HTS) consists in the patient turning his/her 
head towards the accompanying person in search for support when being asked 
questions. Although the HTS is known to be associated with cognitive impairment, 
previous investigations were biased towards Alzheimer's disease (AD) or did not 
differentiate between diverse dementia etiologies; moreover, little is known 
about the specific cognitive correlates of the HTS.ObjectiveTo assess the 
prevalence and clinical correlates of the HTS in patients with mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) and dementia of various etiologies.MethodsThe HTS was recorded 
during the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) in 232 MCI/dementia patients 
with the following etiological classification: AD (N = 121); frontotemporal 
lobar degeneration (FTLD; N = 24); Lewy body disease (LBD; N = 11); vascular 
(N = 29); mixed (N = 47).ResultsThe overall prevalence of the HTS in the whole 
cohort was 27.6%. Albeit being descriptively higher in dementia (29.9%) versus 
MCI (22.7%), as well as descriptively lower in FTLD and LBD than in remaining 
subgroups, no significant association was detected between the HTS and either 
MCI/dementia status or etiology. HTS + patients were older and more frequently 
females, also reporting lower MMSE scores and differing from HTS- ones on 
Temporal and Spatial Orientation and Constructional Praxis sub-scores. An 
association between the HTS and lower MMSE scores was found in patients with MCI 
but not in those with dementia.ConclusionsIn patients with cognitive impairment 
due to diverse causes, the HTS might occur regardless of MCI versus dementia 
status and across different etiologies. MCI patients displaying the HTS might 
have more severe cognitive deficits.

We argue that the provision of substantial dietary modifications to individuals 
who wish to maximize their brain health is ethically permitted, despite evidence 
for such an intervention being not yet fully conclusive. However, we argue that 
for a burdensome therapy with weak evidence and potential harms, balanced 
communication, informed consent and follow-up are necessary components of the 
ethical provision of such lifestyle changes. Moreover, health should be 
discussed as a value with individuals alongside non-health priorities to achieve 
balance and avoid brain healthism.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) has become common as the number of aged 
people increases making it as a socioeconomic problem lately. To date, no 
success is recorded for disease-modifying therapies for AD but only drugs for 
symptomatic relief exist. Research has been centered on the role of amyloid-β on 
the pathogenesis of AD, which has led to the development of drugs that target Aβ 
(β- and γ-secretase inhibitors) to reduce the amount of Aβ formed. However, the 
existing β and γ-secretase inhibitors were associated with harmful side effects, 
low efficacy, and inability to cross the blood-brain barrier.
OBJECTIVE: This study therefore used in silico approach to predict the 
inhibitory properties of alkaloids as potential drug targets against AD.
METHODS: Thus, in this current study, 54 alkaloids from the PhytoHub server 
(phytohub.eu), and two approved drugs were docked against β-secretases. 
Additionally, galantamine and 5 alkaloids with the utmost binding potential with 
β-secretase were subjected to pharmacokinetics evaluation and docked against 
γ-secretase.
RESULTS: From the result, 5 compounds displayed for both docking periods, with 
demissidine, solasodine, tomatidine, and solanidine having better BE than the 
control drugs. Based on the pharmacokinetics evaluation, 4 compounds possessed 
good pharmacokinetic evaluation and biological activities than galantamine.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that demissidine, solasodine, tomatidine, and 
solanidine are promising dual inhibitors against β- and γ-secretase proteins in 
silico. However, there is an urgent need to carry out in vitro and in vivo 
experiments on these new leads to validate the findings of this study.

Medicinal plants and their phytochemicals have been extensively employed 
worldwide for centuries to address a diverse range of ailments, boasting a 
history that spans several decades. These plants are considered the source of 
numerous medicinal compounds. For instance, silymarin is a polyphenolic 
flavonoid extract obtained from the milk thistle plant or Silybum marianum which 
has been shown to have significant neuroprotective effects and great therapeutic 
benefits. Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) are a class of neurological diseases 
that have become more prevalent in recent years, and although treatment is 
available, there is no complete cure developed yet. Silymarin utilizes a range 
of molecular mechanisms, including modulation of MAPK, AMPK, NF-κB, mTOR, and 
PI3K/Akt pathways, along with various receptors, enzymes, and growth factors. 
These mechanisms collectively contribute to its protective effects against NDs 
such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and depression. Despite its 
safety and efficacy, silymarin faces challenges related to bioavailability and 
aqueous solubility, hindering its development as a clinical drug. This review 
highlights the molecular mechanisms underlying silymarin's neuroprotective 
effects, suggesting its potential as a promising therapeutic strategy for NDs.

The chromosome 5p15.33 region, which encodes telomerase reverse transcriptase 
(TERT), harbors multiple germline variants identified by genome-wide association 
studies (GWAS) as risk for some cancers but protective for others. Here, we 
characterize a variable number tandem repeat within TERT intron 6, VNTR6-1 
(38-bp repeat unit), and detect a strong link between VNTR6-1 alleles (Short: 
24-27 repeats, Long: 40.5-66.5 repeats) and GWAS signals rs2242652 and 
rs10069690 within TERT intron 4. Bioinformatics analyses reveal that 
rs10069690-T allele increases intron 4 retention while VNTR6-1-Long allele 
expands a polymorphic G-quadruplex (G4, 35-113 copies) within intron 6, with 
both variants contributing to variable TERT expression through alternative 
splicing and nonsense-mediated decay. In two cell lines, CRISPR/Cas9 deletion of 
VNTR6-1 increases the ratio of TERT-full-length (FL) to the alternative TERT-β 
isoform, promoting apoptosis and reducing cell proliferation. In contrast, 
treatment with G4-stabilizing ligands shifts splicing from TERT-FL to TERT-β 
isoform, implicating VNTR6-1 as a splicing switch. We associate the functional 
variants VNTR6-1, rs10069690, and their haplotypes with multi-cancer risk and 
age-related telomere shortening. By regulating TERT splicing, these variants may 
contribute to fine-tuning cellular longevity and replicative potential in the 
context of stress due to tissue-specific endogenous and exogenous exposures, 
thereby influencing the cancer risk conferred by this locus.

BACKGROUND: As literature suggests that Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease (EOAD) 
and late-onset AD may differ in important ways, need exists for randomized 
clinical trials for treatments tailored to EOAD. Accurately measuring reliable 
cognitive change in individual patients with EOAD will have great value for 
these trials.
OBJECTIVES: The current study sought to characterize and validate 12-month 
reliable change from the Longitudinal Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease Study 
(LEADS) neuropsychological battery.
DESIGN: Standardized regression-based (SRB) prediction equations were developed 
from age-matched cognitively intact participants within LEADS, and applied to 
clinically impaired participants from LEADS.
SETTING: Participants were recruited from outpatient academic medical centers.
PARTICIPANTS: Participants were enrolled in LEADS and diagnosed with 
amyloid-positive EOAD (n = 189) and amyloid-negative early-onset cognitive 
impairment not related to AD (EOnonAD; n = 43).
MEASUREMENT: 12-month reliable change (Z-scores) was compared between groups 
across cognitive domain composites, and distributions of individual participant 
trajectories were examined. Prediction of Z-scores by common AD biomarkers was 
also considered.
RESULTS: Both EOAD and EOnonAD displayed significantly lower 12-month follow-up 
scores than were predicted based on SRB equations, with declines more pronounced 
for EOAD across several domains. AD biomarkers of cerebral β-amyloid, tau, and 
EOAD-specific atrophy were predictive of 12-month change scores.
CONCLUSIONS: The current results support including EOAD patients in longitudinal 
clinical trials, and generate evidence of validation for using 12-month reliable 
cognitive change as a clinical outcome metric in clinical trials in EOAD cohorts 
like LEADS. Doing so will enhance the success of EOAD trials and permit a better 
understanding of individual responses to treatment.

INTRODUCTION: Unpaid caregivers of people living with dementia often experience 
lower levels of perceived life satisfaction and higher rates of depression and 
anxiety compared with those caring for individuals without Alzheimer's disease 
or related dementias. While research on unpaid caregiver well-being and 
satisfaction has primarily focused on the characteristics of people living with 
dementia and their dyadic relationships, it has not adequately explored the role 
of social networks in supporting unpaid caregiver well-being. In this study, we 
aim to fill this gap by taking an egocentric social network approach to 
understand the multiple dimensions of social relations among unpaid caregivers 
of people living with Alzheimer's disease or related dementia.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct a mixed-method, 2-year exploratory study 
that involves a structured survey-based telephone interview in year 1 and 
semistructured interviews in year 2 with caregivers of PLWD recruited through 
community and healthcare partners. Participants will participate in 1 60-min 
interview in year 1 (n=100) and a 45-60 min semistructured interview in year 2 
(n=75). Eligibility for caregivers includes being an unpaid caregiver, aged 40 
years or older, residing and providing care in Arizona or Nevada. The survey 
consists of questions about caregiver and care recipient demographics, caregiver 
background, caregiver stress, resilience, well-being and egocentric social 
network data. Network composition attributes, such as tie strength, the function 
of the relationship and reliance on network members, will also be assessed. In 
year 2, qualitative semistructured interviews will supplement these quantitative 
measures to understand network selection, perceived network changes over time 
and network strength.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Arizona State Institutional Review Board 
(00018191) approved this study. All participants will receive electronic 
informed consent documents to review and sign. During the initial interview, 
participants will be asked if they have any questions about the informed consent 
documents. We will confirm that participants have completed the required consent 
form before the start of any research activity. The findings of this study will 
be disseminated through peer-reviewed journal articles, academic and community 
presentations, and community-focused publications targeting caregivers.

Aging is a major risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases. With aging of the 
global population, the prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases, such as 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), has increased worldwide. 
Unfortunately, the available therapeutic options for these neurodegenerative 
diseases are limited, most of which only provide symptomatic relief and have 
potentially serious side effects. Epidemiological studies have shown that green 
tea consumption is associated with a lower prevalence of cognitive decline and 
decreased risk of AD and PD, providing an attractive preventive and therapeutic 
option. Polyphenols are major bioactive components in green tea, which 
contribute to the beneficial effects of green tea. Accumulating data suggest 
that green tea polyphenols (GTPs) have neuroprotective properties that inhibit 
the pathological development of neurodegenerative diseases; however, the 
underlying mechanisms are not yet completely understood. This paper reviews both 
in vitro and in vivo evidence that demonstrates the neuroprotective effects of 
GTPs against neurodegenerative diseases, with the main focus on AD and PD, and 
summarizes the possible molecular mechanisms by which GTPs impede the 
progression of neurodegeneration. In particular, this review highlights the 
modulation of GTPs on the common mechanisms involved in pathogenesis of 
neurodegenerative diseases, including oxidative stress-mediated neuronal 
toxicity, impaired proteostasis, and metal ion dyshomeostasis. The potential of 
using GTPs in the intervention of neurodegenerative diseases is also discussed, 
hopefully, providing useful insights into novel preventive and therapeutic 
strategies for these diseases.

The interplay between immune cell dysfunction and associated neuroinflammation 
plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. 
Neuroinflammation, orchestrated by microglia and peripheral immune cells, 
exacerbates synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration in AD. Emerging evidence 
suggests a systemic immune response in AD, challenging traditional views of 
neurocentric pathology. Therapeutic strategies targeting neuroinflammation hold 
promise, yet translating preclinical findings into clinical success remains 
elusive. This article presents recent advances in AD scientific studies, 
highlighting the pivotal role of immune cell dysfunction and signaling pathways 
in disease progression. We also discussed therapeutic studies targeting immune 
cell dysregulation, as treatment methods. This advocates for a paradigm shift 
towards holistic approaches that integrate peripheral and central immune 
responses, fostering a comprehensive understanding of AD pathophysiology and 
paving the way for transformative interventions.

Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia are almost ubiquitous in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) but current therapies are not fully effective and safe. 
In this study, we aim to evaluate the role played by the interplay among 
striatal D2, adenosine A2A (A2AR) and cannabinoid CB1 (CB1R) receptors in some 
of these non-cognitive impairments in a well-established animal model of AD, the 
double transgenic APP/PS1 mice. Our results reveal that the alterations existing 
in the ratios between these three receptors significantly correlate with the 
sensorimotor gating and the social interaction impairments occurring in APP/PS1 
mice at 12 months of age. Moreover, the pharmacological stimulation of A2AR and 
CB1R blunted the sensorimotor gating deficiencies in APP/PS1 mice. To note, we 
observed some age-dependent differences among male and female mice. In 
conclusion, the present study provides evidence for the contribution of an 
altered interplay between dopaminergic, adenosinergic and endocannabinoid 
systems in the sensorimotor gating deficits and social withdrawal occurring in 
AD and points to A2AR and CB1R as a potential target to reverse these 
non-cognitive symptoms in AD patients.

BACKGROUND: Neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), are 
characterized by a progressive decline in cognitive function. Modulating 
microglial metabolic reprogramming presents a promising therapeutic avenue for 
AD. Previous studies have shown that Zexie Tang (ZXT) possesses neuroprotective 
properties and can ameliorate cognitive impairment, but the underlying 
mechanisms remain unclear.
PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of ZXT in improving 
cognitive function in AD mice using a multi-omics approach and to explore its 
potential role in modulating microglial metabolic reprogramming.
METHODS: Behavioral assessments were conducted to evaluate the effects of ZXT on 
cognitive function in APP/PS1 mice. H&E, Nissl, and Thioflavin S staining were 
performed to assess the impact of ZXT on brain pathology. A multi-omics 
approach, including transcriptomics, gut microbiota analysis, and metabolomics, 
was employed to elucidate the mechanisms of action of ZXT. RT-qPCR, 
immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence were used to validate the effects of ZXT 
on glycolipid metabolism, neuroinflammation, and the AMPK-mTOR-HIF1α pathway.
RESULTS: ZXT effectively protected against cognitive deficits, reduced 
hippocampal neuronal apoptosis, and decreased Aβ plaque deposition. 
Transcriptomics analysis revealed that ZXT was involved in immune system 
processes and metabolic processes and had a specific cellular response with 
microglia. Additionally, ZXT regulated the composition and functions of brain 
metabolites and gut microbiota. Our study demonstrated that ZXT positively 
influenced glucolipid metabolism and attenuated neuroinflammation, which were 
linked to the AMPK-mTOR-HIF1α pathway in the brain.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggested that ZXT may mitigate cognitive deficits in 
APP/PS1 mice by modulating gut microbiota and enhancing brain energy metabolism. 
ZXT regulated glucolipid metabolism and neuroinflammation by modulating 
microglial metabolic reprogramming involving the AMPK-mTOR-HIF1α pathway.

Amyloid fibrils cause organ and tissue dysfunction in numerous severe diseases. 
Despite the prevalence and severity of amyloidoses, there is still no effective 
and safe anti-amyloid therapy. This study investigates the impact of cysteine 
protease cathepsin B (CTSB) on amyloids associated with Alzheimer's and 
Parkinson's diseases, hemodialysis, and lysozyme amyloidosis. We analyzed the 
effect of CTSB on the size, structure, and proteotoxicity of amyloid fibrils 
formed from alpha-synuclein, abeta peptide (1-42), insulin, and lysozyme using a 
combination of spectroscopic, microscopic, electrophoretic, and colorimetric 
methods. Our comprehensive research revealed a dual effect of CTSB on amyloid 
fibrils. Firstly, CTSB induced amyloid fragmentation while preserving their 
ordered morphology, and, secondly, it "loosened" the tertiary structure of 
amyloids and reduced the regularity of the secondary structure. This dual 
mechanism of action was universal across fibrils associated with different 
pathologies, although the disruption efficacy and predominant type of 
degradation products depended on the amyloids' structure, size, and clustering. 
Notably, CTSB-induced irreversible degradation significantly reduced the 
toxicity for immortalized and primary cell lines of low-clustered fibrils, such 
as alpha-synuclein amyloids associated with Parkinson's disease. These findings 
enhance our understanding of how endogenous CTSB may regulate amyloid content at 
the molecular level in different neuropathologies. In addition, our results 
suggest the potential of CTSB as a component of anti-amyloid drugs in 
combination with agents that enhance the accessibility of proteolytic sites 
within amyloid clots and reduce these clusters stability.

Meibomian glands secrete lipid-rich meibum, which prevents tear evaporation. 
Aging-related Meibomian gland shrinkage may result in part from stem cell 
exhaustion and is associated with evaporative dry eye disease, a common 
condition lacking effective treatment. The identities and niche of Meibomian 
gland stem cells and the signals controlling their activity are poorly defined. 
Using snRNA-seq, in vivo lineage tracing, ex vivo live imaging, and genetic 
studies in mice, we identify markers for stem cell populations that maintain 
distinct regions of the gland and uncover Hedgehog (Hh) signaling as a key 
regulator of stem cell proliferation. Consistent with this, we show that human 
Meibomian gland carcinoma exhibits increased Hh signaling. Aged glands display 
decreased Hh and EGF signaling, deficient innervation, and loss of collagen I in 
niche fibroblasts, indicating that alterations in both glandular epithelial 
cells and their surrounding microenvironment contribute to age-related 
degeneration. These findings suggest new approaches to treat aging-associated 
Meibomian gland loss.

OBJECTIVE: Sabirnetug (ACU193) is a humanized monoclonal antibody selective for 
soluble amyloid beta oligomers (AβOs), synaptotoxins that are early and 
persistent triggers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Sabirnetug pharmacodynamics 
were examined in the INTERCEPT-AD phase 1 study in mild cognitive impairment and 
mild dementia due to AD (NCT04931459) using biofluid biomarkers associated with 
Aβ and tau pathology, synaptic dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and 
neurodegeneration.
METHODS: INTERCEPT-AD was a randomized, first-in-human study of sabirnetug 
versus placebo administered as a single (SAD; 2, 10, 25, 60 mg/kg) or multiple 
(MAD; three doses of 10 or 60 mg/kg every 4 weeks [Q4W] or 25 mg/kg Q2W) 
ascending doses. Biomarkers were measured pre-/post-dose in CSF and EDTA-plasma. 
Correlations of biomarker changes versus dose, exposure duration, and target 
engagement were determined.
RESULTS: In MAD cohorts, CSF pTau181 decreased significantly (60 mg/kg Q4W, p = 
0.049). VAMP2 decreased significantly at all doses (p ≤ 0.041); neurogranin 
decreased significantly at 60 mg/kg Q4W (p = 0.037). Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 trended 
upward with sabirnetug dose. Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 and neurogranin changes correlated 
with sabirnetug-AβO target engagement (p ≤ 0.01). Decreases in tTau, VAMP2, and 
neurogranin correlated with exposure duration (p ≤ 0.007). Plasma pTau181, 
pTau217, GFAP, and NfL trended lower.
DISCUSSION: Following three sabirnetug doses, changes in CSF and plasma 
biomarkers were observed. The CSF biomarker response increased with increasing 
dose and exposure duration, consistent with previous reports that sabirnetug 
reaches the central compartment and engages its AβO target. The ongoing phase 2 
ALTITUDE-AD study (NCT06335173) will test whether sabirnetug's pharmacodynamic 
effects can be substantiated with a larger sample size and longer treatment 
duration.

Amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregation is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
characterized by cognitive impairment, and there remains a lack of effective 
functional compound with Aβ clearance activity. To elucidate the effect of 
exopolysaccharide (EPS) extracted from Agaricus sinodeliciosus var. Chaidam on 
Aβ1-42- induced AD rat and uncover the underlying mechanism, the neuroprotective 
activity of EPS was evaluated using immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, 
western blot, RT-qPCR, microbiomics and metabolomics. The results demonstrated 
that EPS exhibited significant anti-AD efficacy, as evidenced by improved 
cognitive function and spatial memory, balanced brain redox status, suppressed 
neuroinflammatory responses. EPS substantially reduced Aβ1-42 accumulation in 
the hippocampus by activating Aβ-phagocytic microglia through the mTOR-HIF-1α 
pathway. Importantly, EPS reconstructed gut microbiota composition by increasing 
the relative abundance of Ruminococcaceae and reduced Erysipelotrichaceae. The 
reshaped gut microbiome and the formation of the metabolite serotonin were 
associated with behavioral alterations, neuroinflammation, and brain oxidative 
status. Thus, EPS significantly alleviated cognitive deficit and 
neuroinflammation in Aβ1-42-induced AD rats, potentially by enhancing microglial 
phagocytosis of Aβ1-42 and modulating the gut microbiome and serotonin 
production. Collectively, EPS from A. sinodeliciosus var. Chaidam polysaccharide 
may serve as a novel Aβ1-42-targeted approach for anti-AD therapy.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the primary cause of dementia in older adults. 
Amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau protein neurofibrillary tangles accumulate in the 
brain, leading to a progressive decline in memory, thinking, and behavior. 
Neuroinflammation and oxidative stress play a significant role in the 
development and progression of AD. Research has suggested that α-mangostin 
(α-MG), a compound found in mangosteen peels, may have anti-inflammatory, 
antioxidant, and neuroprotective properties, which could be beneficial in the 
context of AD. Further research is required to fully comprehend the therapeutic 
mechanisms of α-MG on AD and determine its potential as a treatment option. α-MG 
treatment significantly improves the viability of hNSCs exposed to Aβ and 
reduces caspase activity. Furthermore, this treatment is associated with a 
notable decrease in the expression of TNF-α and IL-1β. The treatment effectively 
restores alterations in the expression of IKK and NF-κB (p65) induced by Aβ, 
which are critical factors in the inflammatory response. Moreover, α-MG 
effectively reduces iNOS and COX-2 levels in Aβ-treated hNSCs, showcasing its 
potential therapeutic benefits. Treatment with α-MG protects hNSCs against 
Aβ-induced oxidative stress and effectively prevents the decrease in Nrf2 levels 
caused by Aβ. The treatment significantly enhances the activity and mRNA 
expression of Nrf2 downstream antioxidant target genes, including SOD-1, SOD-2, 
Gpx1, GSH, catalase, and HO-1, compared to Aβ-treated controls. α-MG 
significantly reduces tau and ubiquitin (Ub) aggregates, enhances proteasome 
activity, and increases the mRNA expression of HSF1, HSP27, HSP70, and HSP90 in 
Tau-GFP-expressed hNSCs. This study significantly improves our comprehension of 
the anti-inflammatory, antioxidative stress, and anti-aggregated effects of 
α-MG. These findings have potential therapeutic implications for developing 
treatments that could delay AD progression and promote healthy aging.

BACKGROUND: Pyroptosis and mitophagy have gained significant attention in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment. Curcumae Radix (CR), the dried radix of 
Curcuma wenyujin Y. H. Chen et C. Ling, is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) 
extensively utilized for neurological disorders. Yet, its impact and mechanistic 
role in AD remain unclear.
PURPOSE: This study aims to explore the active fraction of CR in AD treatment 
and its potential mechanisms.
METHODS: CR extracts were qualitatively analyzed using UHPLC-Triple-TOF/MS. 
Aβ1-42-induced mice received daily intragastric drug treatments for three weeks. 
Cognitive abilities of AD model mice were assessed through Y maze, novel object 
recognition, and eight-arm maze tests. Therapeutic targets of CR extracts were 
identified using quantitative proteomics. In both in vivo and in vitro settings, 
effects on pyroptosis and mitophagy were examined by Western blot (WB), 
immunofluorescence (IF) staining, and ELISA assays.
RESULTS: The ethyl acetate (EAC) fraction of CR extract exhibited optimal 
anti-AD effects. CR extracts enhanced memory and cognition in Aβ1-42-induced 
mice, improved neuronal morphology, and reduced Aβ accumulation in the brain. 
Proteomics analysis suggested the anti-AD properties of CR might involve 
inflammation reduction, cell survival enhancement, and mitophagy modulation. CR 
treatments in both AD mice and Aβ-induced SH-SY5Y cells resulted in reduced 
pyroptosis, increased LC3 and Beclin1 levels, and activation of the PINK1/Parkin 
pathway.
CONCLUSION: The EAC fraction of CR is effective in AD treatment by mitigating 
pyroptosis, reducing neuroinflammation, and promoting mitophagy, actions 
facilitated through the PINK1/Parkin pathway.

BACE-1 is a prime therapeutic target for treatment of Alzheimer disease as it 
cleaves the β-site of APP leading to formation of amyloid plaques. A dataset of 
229 benzo-fused heterocyclic compounds reported as BACE-1 inhibitors was 
utilized to develop various QSAR models (regression and classification) 
utilizing Monte Carlo algorithm. The dataset was randomly split into different 
sets for generation of models. The IIC and CCC were calculated to increase the 
predictive ability of generated models. Among various models, split-1 of Model-1 
demonstrated the highest robustness and predictive accuracy for pIC50 values. 
Internal and external validation was performed which further confirmed the 
reliability of this model. Structural features responsible for enhancing or 
reducing pIC50 values were identified and were utilized to design library of 255 
compounds. Compounds having pIC50> 5.0 were further screened on the basis of BBB 
permeability predicted via ADMET lab 3.0. Total nineteen compounds were found to 
be BBB permeable which were then docked into PDB: 2WJO. Finally, four compounds 
with high docking scores were identified and compared with existing BACE-1 
inhibitor. MD simulations and MMGBSA analysis were performed and results 
demonstrated minimal fluctuations throughout the simulation of 100 ns with good 
binding affinity. This study highlights development of robust QSAR model which 
assists to design new compounds and predicts them for anti β-secretase activity. 
Design of novel four molecules were proposed which exhibits good potency, BBB 
permeability, excellent binding affinity and stable conformations with BACE-1 
making them promising candidates for further development.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder among the 
elderly, and there are currently no effective treatment options available. 
Selective inhibition of butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) has emerged as a promising 
strategy for AD therapeutics. In this study, we identified compound 6a as a lead 
candidate derived from the structural modification of rivastigmine. Our findings 
indicated that 6a acts as a potent selective BuChE inhibitor, demonstrating an 
IC50 value of 0.33 μM (SI > 151.5). Furthermore, compound 6a displayed favorable 
neuroprotective properties, along with excellent blood-brain barrier (BBB) 
permeability and drug-like characteristics. In vivo investigations utilizing an 
AlCl3-induced zebrafish model of AD revealed that compound 6a significantly 
improved cognitive function, which was further supported by its ability to 
mitigate memory impairment induced by scopolamine. Overall, these results 
highlight compound 6a as a promising selective BuChE inhibitor with potential 
therapeutic implications for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

We examined whether total joint arthroplasty (TJA) is associated with increased 
metal accumulation in the brain and histopathologic changes of Alzheimer's 
disease. We measured ultra-trace metal concentrations (aluminum, chromium, 
cobalt, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, titanium, and vanadium) on postmortem 
frozen tissues of the occipital lobe of 177 subjects (89 non-TJA and 88 TJA) 
using a triple-quadrupole inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and 
correlated elemental concentrations to the degree of Alzheimer's disease 
neuropathic change (ADNC). To effectively assess the relationship between TJA 
and brain metal concentrations, subjects with and without TJA were matched for 
baseline clinical characteristics and showed no difference in postmortem 
Alzheimer's disease neuropathic change. TJA subjects had increased 
concentrations of cobalt and titanium and both metals were associated with 
increased amyloid plaques. In both the TJA and non-TJA subjects, increased 
concentrations of cobalt, titanium, manganese, and molybdenum were associated 
with increased odds of neuritic and diffuse plaques. Lastly, the brain's 
inter-metal correlations were altered in the presence of increased neuritic 
plaques and/or implantable artificial joints. These findings suggest that metal 
concentrations and homeostasis vary in presence of TJA.

neuroprotective effects in vitro as well as in vivo, combined with negligible 
toxicity and can therefore be considered novel treatment options for 
neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. However, their 
subcellular locations responsible for neuroprotection and exact modes of action 
still remain unclear. Here, we present chemical probes based on both flavonoids 
sterubin and fisetin that were utilized in fluorescence microscopy and 
click-correlative light and electron microscopy to detect and visualize the 
localization of specific intracellular targets. We successfully adapted the 
workflow of correlative light and electron microscopy to a click-chemistry-based 
approach in a murine hippocampal cell line (HT22) on ultrathin resin sections 
making visualization of a small molecule for the first time possible in this 
setup. Utilizing this newly adapted technique, we could demonstrate that 
sterubin and fisetin show specific enrichment in the endoplasmic reticulum.

Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), a keystone pathogen in chronic periodontitis, has 
been identified as an emerging risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Pg can 
promote the accumulation of amyloid β protein (Aβ), a characteristic feature of 
AD pathology. However, the underlying mechanism, particularly in Aβ clearance, 
remains poorly understood. Here, by using 3 different strains of Pg, ATCC33277, 
W50, and W83, we discovered that APP/PS1 mice infected with all 3 Pg strains 
showed decreased microglial Aβ internalization, increased Aβ deposition in the 
brain, and impaired cognitive function. Using in vitro experiments, we further 
demonstrated that all 3 Pg strains inhibited microglial Aβ clearance, where 
gingipains, a group of toxic proteases derived from Pg, were involved. 
Gingipains were shown to hydrolyze CD14, subsequently impeding the CD14-mediated 
Vav-Rac/Cdc42 signaling cascade, which ultimately suppressed phagocytosis. 
Gingipain inhibitor could effectively restore microglial Aβ clearance and 
diminish Aβ deposition, leading to improved cognitive function in Pg-infected 
APP/PS1 mice. These findings may provide new insights into the mechanism through 
which Pg impairs microglial Aβ clearance to aggravate AD phenotypes, suggesting 
that gingipain inhibitors could be potential therapeutics for treating 
Pg-associated AD.

BACKGROUND: Abnormal microglial polarization phenotypes contribute to the 
pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have garnered 
increasing attention due to their significant roles in human diseases. Although 
research has demonstrated differential expression of circRNAs in AD, their 
specific functions in AD pathogenesis remain largely unexplored.
METHODS: CircRNA microarray was performed to identify differentially expressed 
circRNAs in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 and WT mice. The stability of circAPP was 
assessed via RNase R treatment assay. CircAPP downstream targets miR-1906 and 
chloride intracellular channel 1 (CLIC1) were identified using bioinformatics 
and proteomics, respectively. RT-PCR assay was conducted to detect the 
expression of circAPP, miR-1906 and CLIC1. Morris water maze (MWM) test, passive 
avoidance test and novel object recognition task were used to detect cognitive 
function of APP/PS1 mice. Microglial M1/M2 polarization and AD pathology were 
assessed using Western blot, flow cytometry and Golgi staining assays. CLIC1 
expression and channel activity were evaluated using Western blot and functional 
chloride channel assays, respectively. The subcellular location of circAPP was 
assessed via FISH and RT-PCR assays. RNA pull-down assay was performed to detect 
the interaction of miR-1906 with circAPP and 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of 
CLIC1 mRNA.
RESULTS: In this study, we identified a novel circRNA, named circAPP, that is 
encoded by amyloid precursor protein (APP) and is implicated in AD. CircAPP is a 
stable circRNA that was upregulated in Aβ-treated microglial cells and the 
hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. Downregulation of circAPP or CLIC1, or 
overexpression of miR-1906 in microglia modulated microglial M1/M2 polarization 
in Aβ-treated microglial cells and the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice, and improved 
AD pathology and the cognitive function of APP/PS1 mice. Further results 
revealed that circAPP was mainly distributed in the cytoplasm, and circAPP could 
regulate CLIC1 expression and channel activity by interacting with miR-1906 and 
affecting miR-1906 expression, thereby regulating microglial polarization in AD.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our study elucidates the regulatory role of circAPP 
in AD microglial polarization via miR-1906/CLIC1 axis, and suggests that circAPP 
may act as a critical player in AD pathogenesis and represent a promising 
therapeutic target for AD.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, 
characterized by a complex pathogenesis that complicates the development of 
effective treatments. Natural products are promising multitarget agents because 
of their ability to interact with multiple molecular targets. Network-based 
medicine presents a robust strategy for discovering such agents, which can 
address the intricate mechanisms underlying AD.
METHODS: In this study, we constructed an AD-related pathway-gene network via 
text mining and pathway database construction. This network facilitated the 
identification of natural products that target multiple pathways and genes 
associated with AD. We evaluated the safety profiles of two selected natural 
products in C57BL/6J mice through assessments of general behavior, body weight 
changes, vital organ weight and morphology, and hematological and biochemical 
parameters. APP/PS1 transgenic mice were subsequently treated with these natural 
products-either individually or in combination-to assess their therapeutic 
effects. Cognitive function was evaluated via behavioral tests, such as novel 
object recognition, Y-maze, and Morris water maze tests. Additionally, 
immunohistochemical staining and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were 
performed to examine Aβ-associated pathological changes. Transcriptomic analysis 
and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) were employed to 
elucidate the mechanisms underlying the effects of the natural products.
RESULTS: The constructed AD-related pathway-gene network encompassed three 
perspectives: (i) Most Studied Pathways (21 pathways with 5325 genes), (ii) 
Gene-Associated Pathways (26 pathways with 2557 genes), and (iii) Popular 
Pathways (24 pathways with 3435 genes). Two natural products, (-)-Vestitol and 
Salviolone, were selected for further validation. Their safety was confirmed in 
C57BL/6J mice. Notably, the combination of (-)-Vestitol and Salviolone 
synergistically affected cognitive function in APP/PS1 transgenic mice by 
reducing Aβ deposition and lowering toxic soluble Aβ levels in the brain. 
Transcriptomic analysis and qRT-PCR experiments revealed that their combination 
regulated AD-related pathways and genes more comprehensively, particularly 
affecting the Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction and Calcium signaling 
pathway.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that screening potential natural products 
through an AD-related pathway-gene network is a promising strategy for 
discovering novel therapeutics for AD. The therapeutic potential of (-)-Vestitol 
and Salviolone as novel candidates for AD treatment is underscored by their 
synergistic effects, attributed to their comprehensive regulation of 
AD-associated pathways and genes.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) has a significant impact on an individual's 
health and places a heavy burden on society. Studies have emphasized the 
importance of microglia in the progression and development of AD. Interferon 
responses and Interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) significantly function in 
neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases involving AD. Therefore, 
further exploration of the relationship among microglia, ISGs, and 
neuroinflammation in AD is warranted.
METHODS: Microglia datasets from the GEO database were retrieved, along with 
additional microglia RNA-seq data from laboratory mice. Weighted Correlation 
Network Analysis was used on the training dataset to identify gene co-expression 
networks. Genes from the black module were intersected with 
interferon-stimulated genes, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were 
identified. Machine learning algorithms were applied to DEGs, and genes selected 
by both methods were identified as hub genes, with ROC curves used to evaluate 
their diagnostic accuracy. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis was performed to reveal 
functional pathways closely relating to hub genes. Microglia cells were 
transfected with siRNAs targeting Oas1g and STAT1. Total RNA from microglia 
cells and mouse brain tissues was extracted, reverse-transcribed, and analyzed 
via qRT-PCR. Proteins were extracted from cells, quantified, separated by 
SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes, and probed with antibodies. Microglia 
cells were fixed, permeabilized, blocked, and stained with antibodies for STAT1, 
then visualized and photographed.
RESULTS: Bioinformatics and machine learning algorithms revealed that Oas1g was 
identified as a hub gene, with an AUC of 0.812. Enrichment Analysis revealed 
that Oas1g is closely associated with interferon-related pathways. Expression of 
Oas1g was validated in AD mouse models, where it was significantly upregulated 
after microglial activation. Knockdown experiments suggested siOas1g attenuated 
the effect of siSTAT1, and the expressions of STAT1 and p-STAT1 were elevated. 
siOas1g could reverse the effect of siSTAT1, indicating that Oas1g potentially 
regulates the ISGs through the STAT1 pathway.
CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that Oas1g was identified as a hub ISG in AD and can 
downregulate the activation of IFN-β and STAT1, reducing the expression of ISGs 
in neuroinflammation. Oas1g might potentially be a beneficial candidate for both 
prevention and treatment of AD.

Research links gait impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD) to cognitive 
abnormalities, brain atrophy, or amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition, with the exact cause 
unclear. This study investigated the relationship between gait, neuroimaging 
biomarkers, and cognition across the AD spectrum. We recruited 48 AD dementia 
patients, 27 with prodromal AD, and 41 cognitively unimpaired individuals, 
analyzing associations among gait parameters, cognitive scores, Aβ deposition, 
and cortical atrophy. Path and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses 
evaluated gait impairment's interdependent interactions and diagnostic 
potential. Prodromal AD and AD dementia patients showed significantly slower 
gait pace than CU (p = 0.014 [velocity], p = 0.003 [step length]), linked to 
attention and executive functions, widespread Aβ deposition, and cortical 
atrophy, in the inferior parietal lobule, middle temporal gyrus, precuneus, and 
insula. Compared to CU, AD dementia patients exhibited greater gait variability 
and phase (p = 0.017 [step length standard deviation], p = 0.001 [double support 
percentage]), significantly correlated with cognition and Aβ deposition. Path 
analysis revealed a combined influence of Aβ deposition, cognitive impairment, 
and cortical atrophy on gait impairment, with > 80% observed gait impairments 
directly affected by Aβ deposition. ROC curves for diagnosing AD stages showed 
significant areas under the curve, suggesting gait characteristics as 
noninvasive biomarkers for early AD diagnosis and progression monitoring.

We continue to lack a clear understanding on how the biological and clinical 
complexity of Parkinson's disease emerges from molecular to macroscopic brain 
interactions. Here, we use personalized multiscale spatiotemporal computational 
brain models to characterize for the first time the synergistic links between 
genes, several multimodal neuroimaging-derived biological factors, clinical 
profiles, and therapeutic needs in PD. We identified genes modulating PD-caused 
brain reorganization in dopamine transporter level, neuronal activity integrity, 
microstructure, dendrite density and tissue atrophy. Inter-individual 
heterogeneity in the identified gene-mediated biological mechanisms was 
associated with five distinct configurations of PD motor and non-motor symptoms. 
Notably, the protein-protein interaction networks underlying both brain 
phenotypic and symptom configurations in PD revealed distinct hub genes 
including MYC, CCNA2, CCDK1, SRC, STAT3 and PSMD4. We also studied the 
biological mechanisms associated with physical activities performance, observing 
that leisure and work activities are strongly related to neurotypical 
cholesterol homeostasis and inflammatory response processes, respectively. 
Finally, patient-tailored in silico gene perturbations revealed a set of 
putative disease-modifying drugs with potential to effectively treat PD across 
different biological levels, most of which are associated with dopamine reuptake 
and anti-inflammation. Our study constitutes the first self-contained multiscale 
spatiotemporal computational approach providing comprehensive insights into the 
complex multifactorial pathogenesis of PD, unraveling key biological modulators 
of physical and clinical deterioration, and serving as a blueprint for optimum 
drug selection at personalized level.

Sciences, Sesto Fiorentino, Florence, Italy. Electronic address:

Eight genetically distinct families of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA, EC 
4.2.1.1) have been described in organisms overall in the phylogenetic tree. They 
catalyze the hydration of CO2 to bicarbonate and protons and are involved in pH 
regulation, chemosensing, and metabolism. The 15 α-CA isoforms present in humans 
are pharmacological drug targets known for decades, their inhibitors being used 
as diuretics, antiglaucoma, antiepileptic, or antiobesity drugs, as well as for 
the management of acute mountain sickness, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, 
and recently, as antitumor theragnostic agents. Other potential applications 
include the use of CA inhibitors (CAIs) in inflammatory conditions, cerebral 
ischemia, neuropathic pain, or Alzheimer/Parkinson disease management. CAs from 
pathogenic bacteria, fungi, protozoans, and nematodes have started to be 
considered as drug targets in recent years, with notable advances being 
registered. CAIs have a complex multipharmacology probably unique to this 
enzyme, which has been exploited intensely but may lead to other relevant 
applications in the future due to the emergence of drug design approaches that 
afforded highly isoform-selective compounds for most α-CAs known to date. They 
belong to a multitude of chemical classes (sulfonamides and isosteres, 
[iso]coumarins and related compounds, mono- and dithiocarbamates, selenols, 
ninhydrines, boronic acids, benzoxaboroles, etc). The polypharmacology of CAIs 
will also be discussed because drugs originally discovered for the treatment of 
non-CA related conditions (topiramate, zonisamide, celecoxib, pazopanib, 
thiazide, and high-ceiling diuretics) show effective inhibition against many 
CAs, which led to their repurposing for diverse pharmacological applications. 
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: CAIs have multiple pharmacologic applications, such as 
diuretics, antiglaucoma, antiepileptic, antiobesity, antiacute mountain 
sickness, anti-idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and antitumor drugs. Their 
use in inflammatory conditions, cerebral ischemia, neuropathic pain, or 
neurodegenerations has started to be investigated recently. Parasite carbonic 
anhydrases are also drug targets for anti-infectives with novel mechanisms of 
action that can bypass drug resistance to commonly used agents. Drugs discovered 
for the management of other conditions that effectively inhibit these enzymes 
exert interesting polypharmacologic effects.

OBJECTIVE: Drug repurposing accelerates therapeutic development by finding new 
indications for approved drugs. However, accounting for individual patient 
differences is challenging. This study introduces a Precision Drug Repurposing 
(PDR) framework at single-patient resolution, integrating individual-level data 
with a foundational biomedical knowledge graph to enable personalized drug 
discovery.
METHODS: We developed a framework integrating patient-specific data from the UK 
Biobank (Polygenic Risk Scores, biomarker expressions, and medical history) with 
a comprehensive biomedical knowledge graph (61,146 entities, 1,246,726 
relations). Using Alzheimer's Disease as a case study, we compared three diverse 
patient-specific models with a foundational model through standard link 
prediction metrics. We evaluated top predicted candidate drugs using patient 
medication history and literature review.
RESULTS: Our framework maintained the robust prediction capabilities of the 
foundational model. The integration of patient data, particularly Polygenic Risk 
Scores (PRS), significantly influenced drug prioritization (Cohen's d = 1.05 for 
scoring differences). Ablation studies demonstrated PRS's crucial role, with 
effect size decreasing to 0.77 upon removal. Each patient model identified novel 
drug candidates that were missed by the foundational model but showed 
therapeutic relevance when evaluated using patient's own medication history. 
These candidates were further supported by aligned literature evidence with the 
patient-level genetic risk profiles based on PRS.
CONCLUSION: This exploratory study demonstrates a promising approach to 
precision drug repurposing by integrating patient-specific data with a 
foundational knowledge graph.

BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with an elevated risk 
of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD). 
While sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and glucagon-like 
peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists have shown neuroprotective potential, 
comparative data on their efficacy in dementia prevention remain scarce.
METHODS: - We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the TriNetX database, 
including 307,103 SGLT2 inhibitor users and 348,686 GLP-1 receptor agonist users 
with T2DM. Propensity score matching yielded 221,883 pairs with balanced 
baseline characteristics. The primary outcome was overall dementia incidence, 
with secondary outcomes including AD, VaD, and all-cause mortality. Hazard 
ratios (HRs) were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models.
RESULTS: SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with a significantly lower incidence 
of overall dementia compared to GLP-1 receptor agonists (2.7 % vs. 3.6 %; HR, 
0.92; 95 % CI, 0.89-0.95). The risk of VaD (HR, 0.89; 95 % CI, 0.84-0.95) and AD 
(HR, 0.90; 95 % CI, 0.86-0.94) was also reduced with SGLT2 inhibitors. All-cause 
mortality was lower in the SGLT2 group (3.6 % vs. 4.6 %; HR, 0.95; 95 % CI, 
0.92-0.98). No significant difference was observed in other dementia subtypes 
(HR, 0.96; 95 % CI, 0.91-1.01).
CONCLUSIONS: In this large, real-world cohort, SGLT2 inhibitors demonstrated 
superior efficacy over GLP-1 receptor agonists in reducing the risks of overall 
dementia, VaD, and AD among patients with T2DM. These findings support the 
preferential use of SGLT2 inhibitors in mitigating dementia risk in this 
population, though randomized controlled trials are warranted for confirmation.

Aging is an extremely significant risk associated with neurodegeneration. The 
most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders (NDs), such as Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) are distinguished by the prevalence of proteinopathy, aberrant glial cell 
activation, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, defective autophagy, cellular 
senescence, mitochondrial dysfunction, epigenetic changes, neurogenesis 
suppression, increased blood-brain barrier permeability, and intestinal 
dysbiosis that is excessive for the patient's age. Substantial body studies have 
documented a close relationship between gut microbiota and AD, and restoring a 
healthy gut microbiota may reduce or even ameliorate AD symptoms and 
progression. Thus, control of the microbiota in the gut has become an innovative 
model for clinical management of AD, and rising emphasis is focused on finding 
new techniques for preventing and/or managing the disease. The etiopathogenesis 
of gut microbiota in driving AD progression and supplementing postbiotics as a 
preventive and therapeutic treatment for AD is discussed. The review 
additionally discusses the use of postbiotics in AD prophylaxis and therapy, 
portraying them as substances that address senescence-triggered dysfunctions and 
are worthy of translating from bench to biopharmaceutical market in response to 
"silver consumers" needs. The current review examines and evaluates the impact 
of postbiotics as whole and specific metabolites, such as short-chain fatty 
acids (SCFAs), lactate, polyamines, polyphenols, tryptophan metabolites, 
exopolysaccharides, and bacterial extracellular vesicles, on the 
aging-associated processes that reinforce AD. Moreover, it provides an overview 
of the most recent data from both clinical and preclinical research involving 
the use of postbiotics in AD.

Objective: Carers of people with young-onset dementia can be challenged by the 
care they provide. Little is known about the types of telephone and online 
support programs and assistive technologies that may help to assist them with 
caregiving. This review aimed to identify telephone and online support programs 
and assistive technologies that informal carers find useful for caring for 
people with young-onset dementia. Design: A systematic review followed Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. An 
electronic search of the following five English databases was conducted: PubMed, 
PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Embase. In addition, the reference lists 
of eligible studies were manually searched to identify further studies. 
Databases were searched using synonyms and derivates for "dementia," 
"Alzheimer's disease," "young onset", "early onset", "caregiver", "online" and 
"technology". Results: We found 12 manuscripts that meet the study inclusion 
criteria. The dominant technologies were telephone and online support programs. 
Other assistive technologies included safety and monitoring support, telehealth, 
and a simple TV remote control. While carers reported positive effects of the 
telephone and online support programs, and technologies, such as improved 
self-efficacy, satisfaction, knowledge, well-being, and reduced burden, stress, 
depression, and anxiety, the studies were scarce, and a limited number of 
assistive technologies were explored. Conclusion: Given the increasing number of 
telephone and online programs and assistive technologies, it is disappointing to 
find a paucity of available manuscripts and the limited number of technologies 
explored for this population. Technologies to assist this population need to be 
developed and evaluated.

This research endeavor seeks to delve into the potential mechanisms by which 
pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs), recognized as emerging 
pollutants, could contribute to the human metabolic disorders and then trigger 
metabolic diseases. Therefore, we have selected lipid and atherosclerosis, 
Alzheimer's disease, and type Ⅱ diabetes mellitus as representative metabolic 
diseases, aiming to systematically explore the critical molecular pathways that 
may be disrupted by PPCPs for the metabolic disease development. By employing 
advanced network toxicology and molecular docking techniques, we have 
successfully elucidated the molecular mechanisms that trigger the three 
diseases. We pinpointed the potential targets associated with the disease by 
leveraging databases including PubChem, ADEMTlab2.0, SwissADME, and GeneCards. 
We further employed STRING analysis and Cytoscape software to pinpoint the core 
targets that were most significantly associated with these metabolic diseases. 
In addition, enrichment analysis of these core targets was conducted using Gene 
Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways within 
the David database. To obtain the structural aspects of the target proteins, we 
also employed AlphaFold 3 for protein structure prediction. Finally, we 
validated the binding affinity of PPCPs to these target proteins using molecular 
docking with AutoDock Vina. Our findings suggested that PPCPs could potentially 
trigger metabolic diseases by modulating the expression of microRNAs, 
influencing cellular apoptosis and proliferation, and affecting signal 
transduction pathways. Interestingly, we also found the correlations among lipid 
and atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and type Ⅱ diabetes mellitus. Taken 
together, our study provides innovative insights into both the mechanisms of how 
environmental pollutants trigger human diseases and revealing the correlations 
among different diseases, thereby laying a theoretical foundation for disease 
prevention and treatment.

BACKGROUND: The emergence of disease-modifying treatment options for Alzheimer 
disease is creating a paradigm shift in strategies to identify patients with 
mild symptoms in primary care settings. Systematic reviews on digital cognitive 
tests reported that most showed diagnostic performance comparable with that of 
paper-and-pencil tests for mild cognitive impairment and dementia. However, most 
studies have small sample sizes, with fewer than 100 individuals, and are based 
on case-control or cross-sectional designs.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the predictive validity of the Japanese 
Cognitive Function Test (J-Cog), a new computerized cognitive battery test, for 
dementia development.
METHODS: We randomly assigned 2520 older adults (average age 72.7, SD 6.7 years) 
to derivation and validation groups to determine and validate cutoff points for 
the onset of dementia. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was used for 
comparison purposes. The J-Cog consists of 12 tasks that assess orientation, 
designation, attention and calculation, mental rotation, verbal fluency, 
sentence completion, working memory, logical reasoning, attention, common 
knowledge, word memory recall, and episodic memory recall. The onset of dementia 
was monitored for 60 months. In the derivation group, receiver operating 
characteristic curves were plotted to determine the MMSE and J-Cog cutoff points 
that best discriminated between the groups with and without dementia. In the 
validation group, Cox proportional regression models were developed to predict 
the associations of the group classified using the cutoff points of the J-Cog or 
MMSE with dementia incidence. Harrell C-statistic was estimated to summarize how 
well a predicted risk score described an observed sequence of events. The Akaike 
information criterion was calculated for relative goodness of fit, where lower 
absolute values indicate a better model fit.
RESULTS: Significant hazard ratios (HRs) for dementia incidence were found using 
the MMSE cutoff between 23 and 24 point (HR 1.93, 95% CI 1.13-3.27) and the 
J-Cog cutoff between 43 and 44 points (HR 2.42, 95% CI 1.50-3.93). In the total 
validation group, the C-statistic was above 0.8 for all cutoff points. Akaike 
information criterion with MMSE cutoff between 23 and 24 points as a reference 
showed a poor fit for MMSE cutoff between 28 and 29 points, and a good fit for 
the J-Cog cutoff between 43 and 44 points.
CONCLUSIONS: The J-Cog has higher accuracy in predicting the development of 
dementia than the MMSE and has advantages for use in the community as a test of 
cognitive function, which can be administered by nonprofessionals.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is a 
reversible neurologic disorder that remains poorly understood. Accurate 
differential diagnosis of iNPH and Alzheimer disease (AD) is complicated by 
overlapping clinical manifestations. Beyond neuroimaging, there are currently no 
biomarkers available for iNPH leading to frequent misdiagnosis, and proteomic 
studies into iNPH have been limited by low sample sizes and inadequate 
analytical depth. In this study, we report the results of a large-scale 
proteomic analysis of CSF from patients with iNPH to elucidate pathogenesis and 
identify potential disease biomarkers.
METHODS: CSF samples were collected through lumbar puncture during diagnostic 
visits to the Mass General Brigham neurology clinic. Samples were analyzed using 
mass spectrometry. Differential expression of proteins was studied using linear 
regression models. Results were integrated with publicly available 
single-nucleus transcriptomic data to explore potential cellular origins. 
Biological process enrichment was analyzed using gene-set enrichment analyses. 
To identify potential diagnostic biomarkers, decision tree-based machine 
learning algorithms were applied.
RESULTS: Participants were classified as cognitively unimpaired (N = 53, mean 
age: 66.5 years, 58.5% female), AD (N = 124, mean age: 71.2 years, 46.0% 
female), or iNPH (N = 44, mean age: 74.6 years, 34.1% female) based on clinical 
diagnosis and AD biomarker status. Gene Ontology analyses indicated upregulation 
of the immune system and coagulation processes and downregulation of neuronal 
signaling processes in iNPH. Differential expression analysis showed a general 
downregulation of proteins in iNPH. Integration of differentially expressed 
proteins with transcriptomic data indicated that changes likely originated from 
neuronal, endothelial, and glial origins. Using machine learning algorithms, a 
panel of 12 markers with high diagnostic potential for iNPH were identified, 
which were not all detected using univariate linear regression models. These 
markers spanned the various molecular processes found to be affected in iNPH, 
such as LTBP2, neuronal pentraxin receptor (NPTXR), and coagulation factor 5.
DISCUSSION: Leveraging the etiologic insights from a typical neurologic clinical 
cohort, our results indicate that processes of immune response, coagulation, and 
neuronal signaling are affected in iNPH. We highlight specific markers of 
potential diagnostic interest. Together, our findings provide novel insights 
into the pathophysiology of iNPH and may facilitate improved diagnosis of this 
poorly understood disorder.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of disability worldwide. Early 
detection is critical for preventing progression and formulating effective 
treatment plans. This study aims to develop a novel deep learning (DL) model, 
Hybrid-RViT, to enhance the detection of AD. The proposed Hybrid-RViT model 
integrates the pre-trained convolutional neural network (ResNet-50) with the 
Vision Transformer (ViT) to classify brain MRI images across different stages of 
AD. The ResNet-50 adopted for transfer learning, facilitates inductive bias and 
feature extraction. Concurrently, ViT processes sequences of image patches to 
capture long-distance relationships via a self-attention mechanism, thereby 
functioning as a joint local-global feature extractor. The Hybrid-RViT model 
achieved a training accuracy of 97% and a testing accuracy of 95%, outperforming 
previous models. This demonstrates its potential efficacy in accurately 
identifying and classifying AD stages from brain MRI data. The Hybrid-RViT 
model, combining ResNet-50 and ViT, shows superior performance in AD detection, 
highlighting its potential as a valuable tool for medical professionals in 
interpreting and analyzing brain MRI images. This model could significantly 
improve early diagnosis and intervention strategies for AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and irreversible brain disorder with 
extensive neuronal loss in the neocortex and hippocampus. Current therapeutic 
interventions focus on the early stage of AD but lack effective treatment for 
the late stage of AD, largely due to the inability to replenish the lost neurons 
and repair the broken neural circuits. In this study, by using engineered 
adeno-associated virus vectors that efficiently cross the blood-brain-barrier in 
the mouse brain, a brain-wide neuroregenerative gene therapy is developed to 
directly convert endogenous astrocytes into functional neurons in a mouse model 
of AD. It is found that ≈500 000 new neurons are regenerated and widely 
distributed in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Importantly, it is 
demonstrated that the converted neurons can integrate into pre-existing neural 
networks and improve various cognitive performances in AD mice. Chemogenetic 
inhibition of the converted neurons abolishes memory enhancement in AD mice, 
suggesting a pivotal role for the newly converted neurons in cognitive 
restoration. Together, brain-wide neuroregenerative gene therapy may provide a 
viable strategy for the treatment of AD and other brain disorders associated

Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors have gained interest as a potential 
treatment for dementia. However, current evidence is limited to observational 
and pre-clinical studies. We conducted a drug-target Mendelian randomization 
(MR) analysis to investigate the on-target effects of pharmacological PDE5 
inhibition on dementia subtypes and related phenotypes. We selected variants 
from around the PDE5A locus associated with diastolic and systolic blood 
pressure, as well as circulating PDE5A levels, to create three instruments for 
genetically proxied PDE5A inhibition. Using two-sample MR, we validated the 
instruments against erectile dysfunction and pulmonary arterial hypertension 
before assessing their associations with dementia subtypes, dementia-related 
proteins, and neuroimaging traits. After correcting for multiple comparisons, 
genetically proxied PDE5 inhibition, per one SD lower in diastolic blood 
pressure, was associated with higher odds of Alzheimer's disease (OR 1.09, 95% 
CI 1.07-1.11) and Lewy body dementia (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.23-1.41), but a trend 
towards lower odds of vascular dementia across all instruments. Genetically 
proxied PDE5 inhibition was associated with both beneficial and adverse effects 
on brain MRI traits. This included lower volumes of white matter 
hyperintensities (SD change - 0.035, 95% CI - 0.025, - 0.045), indicating 
potential benefits, but also reduced volumes of other structures, including the 
thalamus, suggesting potential adverse effects. PDE5 inhibition was associated 
with the concentrations of several proteins implicated in dementia 
pathophysiology. Our findings suggest that while PDE5 inhibition may be 
associated with a lower risk of vascular dementia, possibly by preventing white 
matter hyperintensities, it may increase risk of Alzheimer's disease and Lewy 
body dementia, warranting further investigation before clinical trials.

The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor pyrin 
domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, discovered 20 years ago, is crucial in 
controlling innate immune reactions in Alzheimer's disease (AD). By initiating 
the release of inflammatory molecules (including caspases, IL-1β, and IL-18), 
the excessively activated inflammasome complex in microglia leads to chronic 
inflammation and neuronal death, resulting in the progression of cognitive 
deficiencies. Even though the involvement of NLRP3 has been implicated in 
neuroinflammation and widely explored in several studies, there are plenty of 
controversies regarding its precise roles and activation mechanisms in AD. 
Another prominent feature of AD is impairment in microglial autophagy, which can 
be either the cause or the consequence of NLRP3 activation and contributes to 
the aggregation of misfolded proteins and aberrant chronic inflammatory state 
seen in the disease course. Studies also demonstrate that intracellular buildup 
of dysfunctional and damaged mitochondria due to defective mitophagy enhances 
inflammasome activation, further suggesting that restoration of impaired 
autophagy and mitophagy can effectively suppress it, thereby reducing 
inflammation and protecting microglia and neurons. This review is primarily 
focused on the role of NLRP3 inflammasome in the etiopathology of AD, its 
interactions with microglial autophagy/mitophagy, and the latest developments in 
NLRP3 inflammasome-targeted therapeutic interventions being implicated for AD 
treatment.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. The 
combination of Donepezil and Memantine is the only FDA-approved therapy for AD, 
but its adverse drug reactions (ADRs) lack systematic analysis. This study 
carried out drug combination analysis for AD population to provide evidence 
support for clinical safety of drug use.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using FAERS database reports (January 2004-January 
2024) with Donepezil and Memantine as primary suspected drugs, four 
disproportionality analysis methods - ROR, PRR, BCPNN, and EBGM - were applied 
to identify positive ADR signals. Subgroup analyses were conducted by age and 
gender.
RESULTS: A total of 712 reports were analyzed (54.6% female, 55.1% aged 65-85). 
Across the AD population, 42 ADRs were identified, including hypertensive 
crisis, hyperglycemia, hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome, proteinuria, and 
hydronephrosis, many of which were newly reported. Subgroup analysis revealed 
prostate hypertrophy, acute kidney injury, and cerebral infarction in males, 
while females experienced more severe cardiovascular events, such as complete AV 
block and ventricular extrasystole. Additional ADRs included hyperkalemia, sinus 
bradycardia, and extrapyramidal disorders.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite partial consistency of combined ADRs for Donepezil and 
Memantine with instructions, new ADR signals emerged, with significant 
differences in AD subgroups.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major neurodegenerative disorder more common in 
older adults. One of the leading AD hypotheses involves the amyloid beta (A) 
production, it is associated to oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and 
neurovascular damage. The interaction of A with the blood vessel wall 
contributes to the disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), allowing 
neutrophil infiltration containing the myeloperoxidase enzyme (MPO), which 
produces hypochlorous acid (HOCl) a potent oxidant. Also, MPO could be released 
from the microglia cells and interact with the amyloid beta plaques. This review 
aims to study the role of MPO in the progression of AD, in particular its 
contribution to oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Furthermore, to explore 
the MPO-potential as AD-biomarker to evaluate the therapeutic potential of its 
inhibitors to mitigate the neurotoxicity. Finally, revise MPO inhibitors that 
could act as dual inhibitors acting on MPO and acetylcholinesterase and or 
another target involved in AD.

Misfolding and aggregation of microtubule-associated tau protein is implicated 
in a variety of neurodegenerative disorders (named tauopathies), including 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). AD is the 
most common type of dementia associated with aging, and CTE is a special 
tauopathy that mostly affects contact sports athletes (such as those active in 
American football and boxing). Experimental studies have found that tau 
acetylated on residue K353 exhibited a declined aggregation propensity; however, 
the underlying molecular mechanism remains elusive. In this study, we performed 
replica exchange and conventional molecular dynamics simulations of acetylated 
and unacetylated tau protein models in an explicit solvent. Our results revealed 
that the acetylated R4 (the fourth microtubule-binding repeat domain) dimer 
showed less β structure and more disordered conformations than the unacetylated 
one. K353 acetylation weakened peptide-peptide interactions and interrupted the 
salt-bridge network, thus inhibiting R4 dimerization. Besides, K353 acetylation 
reduced the β-sheet structure probability and induced loosely packed 
conformations of R3-R4 (the third and fourth microtubule-binding repeat regions) 
protofibrils. The replacement of the charged group by acyl on K353 resulted in 
the loss of K353-D358 salt bridges, leading to the enlargement of the β6-β7 
angle and the distance between the carboxyl-terminal and β-turn region, finally 
eliciting an opened "H" configuration. Our work provided a clear picture of the 
inhibitory mechanisms of K353 acetylation on tau at the microscopic level, which 
may be helpful in the development of new therapeutics against tauopathies from 
the perspective of post-translational modification (PTMs).

Neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease are 
severe disorders characterized by progressive neuron degeneration, leading to 
cognitive decline, motor dysfunction, and other neurological issues, 
significantly impairing daily life and the quality of life. Despite advancements 
in understanding these mechanisms, many aspects remain unclear, and current 
treatments primarily manage symptoms without halting disease progression. 
Multiple biological pathways are implicated in neurodegeneration, including 
oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and aberrant 
protein folding. Given the multifactorial nature of neurodegenerative diseases, 
a neuroprotective approach targeting various mechanisms holds significant 
promise for prevention. Natural products derived from plants, animals, and 
fungi, known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, show 
substantial potential in the prevention of neurodegeneration. Unlike synthetic 
compounds, bioactive compounds from these natural sources offer diverse targets 
due to their varied structures and biological activities. This review focuses on 
the potential of bioactive compounds from plants with sedative and 
mood-modulating effects in preventing and/or slowing down neurodegeneration.

Epigenetics mechanisms play a crucial role in regulating gene expression and 
cellular function in the development and progression of neurological disorders. 
Emerging evidence suggests that dysregulation of these epigenetic processes 
contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of various neurological disorders, 
including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and epilepsy. Epigenetic 
mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding 
RNAs, significantly impact neural plasticity. The use of epigenetic modulators, 
including DNA methyltransferase and histone deacetylase inhibitors, offers a 
promising strategy to correct and modify aberrant epigenetic marks, potentially 
restoring neurological homeostasis. This review highlights recent research 
findings from ongoing clinical trials and the potential benefits and challenges 
of epigenetic therapies for neurological disorders. We discuss the capacity of 
these interventions to potentially halt or reverse disease progression, their 
targeted nature, and their neuroprotective effects. Additionally, we address the 
hurdles facing the field, including issues of specificity, delivery, and 
long-term efficacy.

Diseases of the nervous system are recognized as the second leading cause of 
death worldwide. The global prevalence of neurological diseases, such as 
Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease has seen a 
significant rise due to the increasing proportion of the aging population. The 
discovery of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats 
(CRISPR) genome editing technique has paved way for universal neurological 
diseases treatment. However, finding a safe and effective method to deliver 
CRISPR gene-editing tools remains a main challenge for genome editing therapies 
in vivo. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is currently one of the most commonly used 
vector systems, but some issues remain unresolved, including capsid 
immunogenicity, off-target mutations, and potential genotoxicity. To address 
these concerns, researchers are actively encouraging the development of new 
delivery systems, like virus-like particles and nanoparticles. These novel 
systems have the potential to enhance targeting efficiency, thereby offering 
possible solutions to the current challenges. This article reviews CRISPR 
delivery vectors for neurological disorders treatment and explores potential 
solutions to overcome limitations in vector systems. Additionally, the delivery 
strategies of CRISPR systems are highlighted as valuable tools for studying 
neurological diseases, and the challenges and opportunities that these vectors 
present.

Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous 
system (CNS). Given the increasing age of the general population, PD has emerged 
as a significant public health and societal concern, impacting both individual 
well-being and socioeconomic progress. The present interventions have proven 
insufficient in impeding the progressive nature of PD. Consequently, it is 
imperative to promptly identify efficacious strategies for the prevention and 
treatment of PD. Icaritin (ICT) is a flavonoid extracted from Epimedium 
Brevicornu Maxim that is a phytoestrogen with antitumour, anti-inflammatory, 
antioxidant, antiaging, and neuroprotective properties. This paper reviews the 
protective effect of ICT on dopaminergic neurons through anti-oxidative stress, 
improving mitochondrial function, inhibiting neuroinflammatory responses, 
reducing Lewy body formation, and decreasing apoptosis. The primary objective of 
this article is to provide valuable insights and serve as a reference for the 
potential use of ICT in the prevention and treatment of PD.

China, Chengdu, China.

OBJECTIVE: Exploring the effects of combination of nostalgic activity-based 
therapies, including music therapy on cognitive function, negative emotions, and 
sleep quality in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.
METHODS: A total of 63 patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease who 
were treated at the Sichuan Provincial Psychiatric Center of the People's 
Hospital of Sichuan Province from January to June 2023 were selected as the 
research subjects. They were randomly divided into a study group (n = 31) and a 
control group (n = 32) using a random number table method. The control group 
received routine treatment and nursing care, while the study group received 
nostalgic music therapy intervention on the basis of the control group. The Mini 
Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MOCA), 
Self Rating Anxiety and Depression Scale (SAS, SDS), and Pittsburgh Sleep 
Quality Index (PSQI) of the two groups were compared.
RESULTS: A total of 30 cases from each group completed the study. After 12 weeks 
of intervention, the MMSE and MOCA scores of both groups of patients increased, 
and the treatment group was higher than the control group (P < 0.05); SAS, SDS 
and PSQI scores decreased compared with those before intervention, and the 
treatment group was lower than the control group (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Nostalgic music therapy can improve cognitive function, alleviate 
negative emotions, and improve sleep quality in patients with mild to moderate 
Alzheimer's disease.

INTRODUCTION: For many patients and caregivers, a major goal of 
disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) for Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia is to 
extend independence in instrumental and basic activities of daily living (IADLs 
and BADLs). The goal of this study was to estimate the effect of treatments on 
the time remaining independent in IADLs and BADLs.
METHODS: Participants at the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center (Knight 
ADRC) who met eligibility criteria for recent DMT trials were studied: age ≥60 
years at baseline, clinical diagnosis of very mild or mild AD dementia (global 
Clinical Dementia Rating [CDR] score 0.5 or 1), biomarker confirmation of 
amyloid pathology, and at least one follow-up CDR assessment within 5 years. For 
IADLs, a subset of the Functional Assessment Questionnaire (FAQ) was examined 
that rated the degree of independence in the following: paying bills, driving, 
remembering medications and appointments, and preparing meals. For BADLs, the 
Personal Care domain of the CDR was used. Mixed-effects logistic and ordinal 
regression models were used to examine the relationship between CDR Sum of Boxes 
(CDR-SB) and the individual functional outcomes and their components. The change 
in CDR-SB over time was estimated with linear mixed-effects models.
RESULTS: A total of 282 participants were followed for an average of 2.9 years 
(standard deviation [SD] 1.3 years). For 50% of individuals, loss of 
independence in IADLs occurred at CDR-SB >4.5 and in BADLs at CDR-SB >11.5. For 
individuals with a baseline CDR-SB = 2, treatment with lecanemab would extend 
independence in IADLs for 10 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 4-18 months) 
and treatment with donanemab in the low/medium tau group would extend 
independence in IADLs by 13 months (95% CI 6-24 months).
DISCUSSION: Independence in ADLs can be related to CDR-SB and used to 
demonstrate the effect of AD treatments in extending the time of independent 
function, a meaningful outcome for patients and their families.
HIGHLIGHTS: We estimated time to loss of independence for people with AD 
dementiaEstimating time to loss of independence can help with clinical 
decision-makingDisease-modifying treatments for AD dementia can extend 
independence.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder with 
multifaceted pathogenesis, which has been extensively investigated, yet 
effective treatments remain lacking. Splicing factor proline and glutamine rich 
(SFPQ) is known to play a crucial role in neurodegenerative diseases, including 
antioxidant-related functions and regulating gene expression within brain 
neurons. However, the specific role of SFPQ in AD pathology is not well 
understood. In this study, an AD mouse model was established through lateral 
ventricular injection of amyloid-beta1-42 (Aβ 1-42). Subsequently, 
adeno-associated virus was administered to overexpress SFPQ in the hippocampus 
of AD mice. The results demonstrate that SFPQ overexpression improves 
recognition and memory in AD mice, while reducing AD-related marker proteins 
such as amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Tau. Additionally, synaptic and 
memory-associated proteins, as well as antioxidant proteins like glutathione 
S-transferase (GST) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), were upregulated. The ratio of 
antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 to proapoptotic protein Bax also increased. 
Furthermore, phosphorylated phosphoinositide 3-kinase (p-PI3K)/PI3K and 
phosphorylated protein kinase B (p-AKT)/AKT ratios were elevated, indicating 
activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. These findings suggest that SFPQ 
may serve as a promising molecular target for the prevention and treatment of 
AD.

Background: Abnormal elevation of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) has 
been observed among Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. This may be due to 
microglia-mediated release of proinflammatory cytokines, which promote 
neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis. Silencing of TGFBR1, a gene encoding 
TGF-β receptor type I (TGF-βR1), has resulted in neuronal survival from 
amyloid-beta (Aβ)-induced neurotoxicity. Therefore, the present study 
investigated the neuroprotective effect of TGF-βR1 inhibitors (RepSox, 
Galunisertib, and Vactosertib) against Aβ-induced direct neurotoxicity and 
microglia-mediated neuroinflammation. Methods: The neuroprotective effect of 
TGF-βR1 inhibitors against Aβ-induced direct neurotoxicity and 
microglia-mediated neuroinflammation were investigated using the RealTime-Glo™ 
MT Cell Viability Assay. The inhibitory effect of TGF-βR1 inhibitors on 
Aβ-induced microglia-mediated production of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and 
IL-1β) was determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: 
TGF-βR1 inhibitors (RepSox, Galunisertib, and Vactosertib) at the tested 
concentrations (6.25-150 nM) showed no significant cytotoxicity effects on 
SH-SY5Y and BV-2 cells. Moreover, treatments with these inhibitors exhibited 
neuroprotection on SH-SY5Y cells against Aβ-induced direct neurotoxicity. The 
trend of cell viability after 24 h treatment also supports the microscopic 
images of the cells' morphology. Furthermore, pretreatment with these inhibitors 
conferred indirect neuroprotective effect against Aβ-induced microglia-mediated 
neuroinflammation by attenuating the production of proinflammatory cytokines 
(TNF-α and IL-1β). Conclusion: The inhibition of the TGF-β signaling pathway in 
neuronal and microglia cells by TGF-βR1 inhibitors resulted in neuroprotection 
against Aβ-induced direct neurotoxicity and microglia-mediated 
neuroinflammation. Hence, targeting the TGF-β signaling pathway in both neuronal 
and microglia cells could provide a promising therapeutic strategy in AD.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of Brief 
Behavioral Activation Therapy (BBAT) on apathy symptoms in older adults with 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) in a medical center facility.
METHOD: In an experimental design, 90 older adults with AD were replaced into 
three groups including two experimental groups (mild AD group (n = 30), moderate 
AD group (n = 30)) and a control group (15 participants with mild AD and 15 
participants with moderate AD). All participants completed the Dimensional 
Apathy Scale (DAS) before and after an eight-session BBAT intervention, with 
follow-up conducted two months post-treatment. A 3 x 3 mixed ANOVA was performed 
to analyze differences in apathy levels across groups over time, using SPSS 
version 26.
RESULTS: The mixed ANOVA revealed significant differences in all apathy 
dimensions (executive, emotional and initial symptoms) among the groups. 
Specifically, significant between-subject and within-subject differences, 
respectively for group main effect and time main effect, along with a 
significant interaction between group and time. These findings indicated that 
apathy symptoms in patients with mild AD significantly decreased from pretest to 
post- intervention, but there wasn't significant change in moderate AD and 
control group.
CONCLUSION: The findings suggested that BBAT is effective in reducing apathy 
symptoms in patients with mild AD. Early evaluation, diagnosis and treatment of 
apathy in the mild stages of AD are crucial for improving patient outcomes.

Tetrahydroxy stilbene glycoside (TSG), which is the primary active substance of 
Chinese herbal medicine called Polygonum multiflorum, has been acknowledged to 
alleviate Alzheimer's disease (AD)-induced learning disorder in the transgene 
mice. Because the microglia activation is really important during the AD 
progression, herein, we determined the effects of TSG on AD neuropathology, 
microglia polarization and its underlying mechanism. We used APP/PS1 mice along 
with immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence techniques to evaluate the 
function of TSG as 60, 120 and 180 mg/kg on Aβ deposition, neuronal loss and 
microglia polarization induced by AD. Additionally, we assessed the effects of 
TSG on TREM2 signalling using both molecular docking and Western blot analysis. 
TSG was found to promote neuronal survival and decrease Aβ deposition in APP/PS1 
mice. Moreover, TSG reduced microglia M1 polarization and modulated the 
TREM2/PI3K/AKT signalling pathways. TSG could reduce neuronal impairment by 
mediating the microglia polarization by TREM2/PI3K/AKT signalling pathway in 
APP/PS1 mice and is a latent pharmacological research direction for the therapy 
in the patients with AD.

INTRODUCTION: BACE1 (beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1) 
inhibitors have shown promise in treating Alzheimer's disease (AD) by reducing 
amyloid-beta (Aβ) production. However, clinical trials of inhibitors such as 
atabecestat, verubecestat, and lanabecestat have faced challenges, including 
limited efficacy and significant adverse effects.
AREAS COVERED: This narrative review discusses randomized-controlled trials of 
BACE1 inhibitors. Literature searches were conducted using PubMed and Web of 
Science for studies from 2010 to 2024. Association with BACE1's widespread 
expression beyond the brain shows adverse effects such as anxiety, depressive 
symptoms, and hepatotoxicity.
EXPERT OPINION: The trial results underscore the need for CNS-specific BACE1 
inhibitors to reduce adverse effects. Future research should focus on optimizing 
drug design and identifying additional therapeutic avenues, such as prostate 
cancer and insulin resistance.

Mitochondrial respiratory complexes are organized into supercomplexes (SC) to 
regulate electron flow and mitigate oxidative stress. Alterations in SC 
organization in the brain may affect energy expenditure, oxidative stress, and 
neuronal survival. In this report, we investigated the amount, activity and 
organization of mitochondrial complex I (CI) in the hippocampus of 12-month-old 
McGill-R-Thy1-APP transgenic (Tg) rats, an animal model of Alzheimer's-like 
cerebral amyloidosis. By means of BN-PAGE, we found that the organization of SC 
did not differ between genotypes, but a lower abundance of SC was detected in Tg 
compared to wild-type (WT) rats. Using a more sensitive technique (2-D 
electrophoresis followed by Western blot), higher levels of free CI and a 
decrease in the relative abundance of assembled CI in SC (I-III2 and I-III2-IV) 
were observed in Tg rats. In-gel activity assays showed that the total activity 
of CI (CI + SC-CI) is lower in Tg compared to WT, while Tg samples show a 
significant decrease in SC-CI-associated activity. This alteration in CI 
assembly was associated with nitro-oxidative stress and changes in mitochondrial 
fusion-fission parameters. To assess CI composition, we applied LC-MS/MS to the 
isolated CI from BN-PAGE and found that 11 of 45 subunits described in mammals 
were found to be less abundant in Tg. We examined the levels of the 
nuclear-derived NDUFA9 subunit, which is critical for CI assembly, and found 
higher levels in the cytoplasmic fraction and lower levels in the mitochondrial 
fraction in Tg, suggesting that brain amyloidosis affects the import of CI 
subunits from the cytosol to the mitochondria, destabilizing the SC. This is the 
first report to characterize the types, abundance and activity of SC in the 
hippocampus of an animal model of cerebral amyloidosis, providing additional 
experimental evidence for the molecular mechanisms underlying the brain 
bioenergetic deficit characteristic of Alzheimer's disease.

BACKGROUND: Blood-based assays are expected to be integrated into clinical 
routines across various contexts, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Vascular 
dementia (VaD), which is the second most common cause leading to dementia after 
AD, could also significantly benefit from this advancement. However, no 
informative fluid biomarker has been identified for VaD. Given the disruption of 
iron homeostasis in both AD and VaD, this study aims to characterize the 
potential of the iron-related hormone Hepcidin as a biomarker for these two 
conditions. We will compare its added value to established AT(N) blood 
biomarkers.
METHODS: Blood biomarkers (amyloid-composite, p-Tau181, Neurofilament Light 
Chain [NfL] and Hepcidin) levels in blood were analyzed in two independent 
cohorts and compared between AD patients and non-AD individuals. Additionally, 
blood Hepcidin and NfL were evaluated in the contexts of VaD and CADASIL, with 
their relative diagnostic value assessed.
RESULTS: Blood Hepcidin and NfL do not significantly increase the AUC obtained 
with both p-Tau181 and amyloid composite in the context of AD. In contrast, AUC 
for VaD diagnosis is significantly higher when combining these two blood 
biomarkers compared to NfL alone. Hepcidin was not significantly modified in 
CADASIL patients compared to control subjects.
CONCLUSION: Blood Hepcidin and NfL have limited interest in the clinical context 
of AD but determination of these biomarkers shows to be highly informative for 
the diagnosis of VaD. This result could have important implications for 
diagnosis and implementation of clinical trials.

BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis and accurate prognosis of cognitive decline in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is important to timely assignment to optimal treatment 
modes. We aimed to develop a deep learning model to predict cognitive conversion 
to guide re-assignment decisions to more intensive therapies where needed.
METHODS: Longitudinal data including five variable sets, i.e. demographics, 
medical history, neuropsychological outcomes, laboratory and neuroimaging 
results, from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort were 
analyzed. We first developed a deep learning model to predicted cognitive 
conversion using all five variable sets. We then gradually removed variable sets 
to obtained parsimonious models for four different years of forecasting after 
baseline within acceptable frames of reduction in overall model fit (AUC 
remaining > 0.8).
RESULTS: A total of 607 individuals were included at baseline, of whom 538 
participants were followed up at 12 months, 482 at 24 months, 268 at 36 months 
and 280 at 48 months. Predictive performance was excellent with AUCs ranging 
from 0.87 to 0.92 when all variable sets were considered. Parsimonious 
prediction models that still had a good performance with AUC 0.80-0.84 were 
established, each only including two variable sets. Neuropsychological outcomes 
were included in all parsimonious models. In addition, biomarker was included at 
year 1 and year 2, imaging data at year 3 and demographics at year 4. Under our 
pre-set threshold, the rate of upgrade to more intensive therapies according to 
predicted cognitive conversion was always higher than according to actual 
cognitive conversion so as to decrease the false positive rate, indicating the 
proportion of patients who would have missed upgraded treatment based on 
prognostic models although they actually needed it.
CONCLUSIONS: Neurophysiological tests combined with other indicator sets that 
vary along the AD continuum can improve can provide aid for clinical treatment 
decisions leading to improved management of the disease.

BACKGROUND: Among the available evidence-based interventions targeting dementia 
family caregivers, there is limited evidence on implementation processes that 
produce desired outcomes (i.e., reductions in depression and burden) for 
caregivers, people living with dementia (PLWD), and community-based programs 
themselves. In a national multi-site hybrid effectiveness trial, we investigated 
the implementation success and challenges of embedding an evidence-based 
intervention (ADS Plus) targeting dementia family caregivers whose PLWD was 
enrolled in an adult day service (ADS).
METHODS: Informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, we 
conducted a directed qualitative content analysis to understand caregiver 
(n = 15) and staff (n = 14) perceptions of facilitators of and potential 
barriers to implementation of ADS Plus in nine ADS programs to guide future 
dissemination efforts.
RESULTS: Results demonstrated that successful delivery of ADS Plus was achieved 
through intervention adaptability, personalization, and structure (innovation); 
responsiveness of ADS Plus to external changes and intervention marketability 
(outer domain); presence of aligned goals and familiarity (inner setting); 
involvement of research staff, connections among practitioners, and meeting 
caregiver needs (individual domain); and understanding caregivers' needs and 
addressing staff capacity to take action (implementation process). This 
adaptability reassures us of the potential to implement ADS Plus in 
heterogeneous programmatic settings.
CONCLUSION: Globally, our results demonstrate that ADS Plus offers a viable 
community-based solution for supporting dementia family caregivers with high 
implementation potential for diverse ADS settings.

BACKGROUND: Generalized propensity score (GPS) methods have become popular for 
estimating causal relationships between a continuous treatment and an outcome in 
observational studies with rich covariate information. The presence of rich 
covariates enhances the plausibility of the unconfoundedness assumption. 
Nonetheless, it is also crucial to ensure the correct specification of both 
marginal and conditional treatment distributions, beyond the assumption of 
unconfoundedness.
METHOD: We address limitations in existing GPS methods by extending 
balance-based approaches to high dimensions and introducing the Generalized 
Outcome-Adaptive LASSO and Doubly Robust Estimate (GOALDeR). This novel approach 
integrates a balance-based method that is robust to the misspecification of 
distributions required for GPS methods, a doubly robust estimator that is robust 
to the misspecification of models, and a variable selection technique for causal 
inference that ensures an unbiased and statistically efficient estimation.
RESULTS: Simulation studies showed that GOALDeR was able to generate nearly 
unbiased estimates when either the GPS model or the outcome model was correctly 
specified. Notably, GOALDeR demonstrated greater precision and accuracy compared 
to existing methods and was slightly affected by the covariate correlation 
structure and ratio of sample size to covariate dimension. Real data analysis 
revealed no statistically significant dose-response relationship between 
epigenetic age acceleration and Alzheimer's disease.
CONCLUSION: In this study, we proposed GOALDeR as an advanced GPS method for 
causal inference in high dimensions, and empirically demonstrated that GOALDeR 
is doubly robust, with improved accuracy and precision compared to existing 
methods. The R package is available at https://github.com/QianGao-SXMU/GOALDeR .

Implementing multi-site behavioral intervention trials to study Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) has many unique challenges, leading to substantial variations in 
delivered intervention doses and cognitive findings. These issues can be 
addressed by the IMplementation Framework fOr Behavioral and LIfestyLe 
Interventions In AlZheimer's DiseasE (MOBILIZE), which was developed to guide 
the design and implementation of behavioral interventions in AD. Building on the 
person-centered principle, MOBILIZE includes three implementation outcomes with 
corresponding team processes: (1) screening (processes), (2) intervention 
adherence (processes), and (3) safety (processes). This study systematically 
evaluated MOBILIZE implementation outcomes of the 3-site aerobic exercise and 
cognitive training (ACT) Trial (recruitment started on 4/1/2018 and last 
follow-up on 7/17/2024). Outcomes included time in screening phases, 
intervention adherence (attendance and intervention dose adherence, and safety 
[adverse events]). Sample (n = 146) was 73.8 ± 5.7 years in age and 23.4 ± 2.1 
on Montreal Cognitive Assessment score, with 48.0% female and 91.8% White. The 
median days of screening-to-enrollment averaged 98 days. Attendance was 
76.7 ± 28.6%. Adherence to 100% exercise session dose and 100% cognitive session 
dose was 71.7 ± 30.8% and 51.5 ± 26.2%, respectively. There were 10 
study-related adverse events. MOBILIZE helped the ACT Trial achieve high 
intervention attendance and safety and may be important for early-stage trials 
in AD.Trial registration The ACT Trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov 
(NCT03313895). Registered 15 July 2017,

Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition resulting 
from a CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene (HTT). Recent advancements in 
understanding HD's cellular and molecular pathways have paved the way for 
identifying various effective small-molecule candidates to treat the disorder. 
Two small molecules, Tetrabenazine and Deutetrabenazine, are approved for 
managing chorea associated with HD, and several others are under clinical 
trials. Notably, the field of small-molecule therapeutics targeting HD is 
rapidly progressing, and there is anticipation of their approval in the 
foreseeable future. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the 
emergence of small-molecule therapeutics in various stages of clinical 
development for HD therapy. The emphasis is placed on detailing their structural 
design, therapeutic effects, and specific mechanisms of action. Additionally, 
exploring key drivers implicated in HD pathogenesis offers valuable insights, as 
a foundational principle for designing prospective anti-HD therapeutic leads.
