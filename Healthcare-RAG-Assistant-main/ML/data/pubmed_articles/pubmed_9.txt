INTRODUCTION: Much of Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk is explained by age, 
apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, and sex. We sought to identify genetic 
modifiers of age at onset (AAO) of AD while probing the influence of sex and 
APOE among those with diverse ancestry.
METHODS: We performed genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of AAO in two 
diverse samples followed by meta-analysis, contrasting results with and without 
adjustment for sex and APOE. Genome-wide significance was set to p < 5×10-8.
RESULTS: GWASs adjusting for sex, APOE, population structure, and relatedness 
revealed 17 significant loci including independent associations at AD risk loci 
and four novel signals. APOE adjustment influenced GWAS effect sizes across the 
genome while sex adjustment had minimal effect.
DISCUSSION: We identified association signals within a diverse but relatively 
small sample, replicating loci recently discovered in large European 
ancestry-only GWASs, and illustrated the power of using a quantitative trait 
like AAO over a binary diagnosis trait.
HIGHLIGHTS: Survival analysis approach identified known and novel genetic 
modifiers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Multi-ancestry analyses revealed 
independent signals at known AD loci. Apolipoprotein E adjustment influenced 
variant effects across the genome.

BACKGROUND: In China, the "8+2" stroke risk score has been widely used to 
identify individuals at high risk of stroke, despite insufficient evidence 
confirming its predictive ability for stroke events.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to validate the risk score's ability to predict the risk of 
stroke within a 10-year timeframe in community cohort populations and to 
optimize the scoring method to improve its predictive accuracy.
METHODS: By reviewing previous literature to obtain the parameters for 
constructing the logistic regression model and the Rothman-Keller model, the 
risk threshold points of the models were determined using a sample of 100,000 
participants. For this population-based cohort study, 22,259 community residents 
were recruited in 2013 from one urban and rural monitoring site in Ningxia, 
China. The occurrence of stroke was established by a combination of 
self-reporting and review of hospitalization electronic records (the 
International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 
10th Revision: I60-63). A logistic regression model and a Rothman-Keller model 
were used to refine the 8-factor stroke risk score to predict the 10-year stroke 
risk. The performance of the model was assessed by the area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve and net reclassification improvement.
RESULTS: The threshold points for low and medium risk in the logistic regression 
model and the Rothman-Keller model are risk scores of 0.062 and 0.002, 
respectively. The threshold points for medium and high risk are risk scores of 
0.165 and 0.005, respectively. A total of 11,692 community residents aged 40 
years or older who met the inclusion criteria completed the 10-year follow-up. 
According to the "8+2" stroke risk score, the stroke incidence in the low-risk 
(n=8908), medium-risk (n=1074), and high-risk groups (n=1710) was 4.5%, 14.7%, 
and 12.3%, respectively. The logistic regression model and the Rothman-Keller 
model demonstrated significant differences in area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve values when compared to the "8+2" stroke risk score 
(Z=2.60, P=.001; Z=3.47, P=.009, respectively). However, no significant 
difference was observed between the logistic regression model and the 
Rothman-Keller model (Z=0.688, P=.49). Relative to the risk score, the absolute 
net reclassification improvement of the Rothman-Keller model was 0.051 (P=.01) 
and of the logistic regression model was 0.010 (P=.62).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirmed that the "8+2" stroke risk score does not 
effectively predict stroke events. But the Rothman-Keller model may enhance the 
ability to identify individuals at high risk for stroke. Future research should 
incorporate more specific biomarkers and multimodal imaging features to develop 
more accurate risk prediction models.

INTRODUCTION: Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with ligands for 
synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) has emerged as a promising methodology 
for measuring synaptic density in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We investigated the 
relationship between SV2A PET and CSF synaptic protein changes of AD patients.
METHOD: Twenty-one participants with early AD and seven cognitively normal (CN) 
individuals underwent [11C]UCB-J PET. We used mass spectrometry to measure a 
panel of synaptic proteins in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
RESULTS: In the AD group, higher levels of syntaxin-7 and PEBP-1 were associated 
with lower global synaptic density. In the total sample, lower global synaptic 
density was associated with higher levels of AP2B1, neurogranin, γ-synuclein, 
GDI-1, PEBP-1, syntaxin-1B, and syntaxin-7 but not with the levels of the 
neuronal pentraxins or 14-3-3 zeta/delta.
CONCLUSION: Reductions of synaptic density found in AD compared to CN 
participants using [11C]UCB-J PET were observed to be associated with CSF 
biomarker levels of synaptic proteins.
HIGHLIGHTS: A panel of synaptic proteins was quantified in the CSF using mass 
spectrometry. SV2A ([11C]UCB-J) PET was used to quantify synaptic density. 
Reductions of synaptic density were associated with CSF synaptic biomarker 
levels.

The response to a request to walk involves a motor planning phase followed by an 
execution phase. The initial phase of gait initiation, specifically the time to 
anticipatory postural adjustment (APA), can be viewed as a form of reaction 
time. However, it is not clear how to characterize the cognitive processes 
involved in this stage. To address this question, time-to-APA, simple and 
complex upper limb visuomotor reaction time (SRT, CRT), cognitive, and motor 
performance were evaluated in 27 people with Parkinson's disease (PD), 31 older 
adults (OA), and 34 young adults (YA). Our results showed that time-to-APA was 
significantly longer than SRT in all three groups (p < 0.001), indicating a more 
complex cognitive process. In YA, time-to-APA was significantly shorter than CRT 
(p < 0.001). In the OA and PD, time-to-APA was not significantly different from 
CRT. Mixed-effects analysis showed significant time (p < 0.001), group 
(p = 0.037), and group × time interaction effects (p = 0.002). Among all 
subjects, time-to-APA, but not APA duration, was associated with the 
Color-Trails Test (part B: rs = 0.406, p < 0.001). In PD, APA duration was 
correlated with MDS-UPDRS-part 3 (motor) scores (rs = 0.535, p = 0.004), but 
time-to-APA was not (p = 0.892). These findings suggest that time-to-APA is a 
cognitive process that is more complex than an SRT task and shares properties of 
a CRT task, especially among older adults and people with PD. In PD, this 
initial movement planning stage is not related to motor impairment, in contrast 
to APA duration. Further research is necessary to identify the factors 
underlying this initial stage of gait initiation.

INTRODUCTION: The α-synuclein (αSyn) seed amplification assay (αSyn-SAA) is an 
accurate tool to detect αSyn seeds in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). 
However, a minority of clinically diagnosed PD patients are negative for αSyn.
METHODS: The αSyn-SAA was performed in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of individuals 
with PD (n = 93), multiple system atrophy (MSA, n = 26), progressive 
supranuclear palsy (PSP, n = 18), corticobasal syndrome (n = 3), and healthy 
controls (n = 29).
RESULTS: The αSyn-SAA detected αSyn in 90% of PD and 81% of MSA patients, while 
exhibiting high specificity (97%). SAA- PD patients had a distinct phenotype 
compared to SAA+ PD, including a marked postural instability/gait disorder 
(P = 0.002), impaired episodic memory, and lower CSF amyloid beta42 (P = 0.03). 
SAA+ PSP also displayed distinctive traits.
DISCUSSION: A negative αSyn-SAA in PD is associated with a distinct phenotype 
and pathological findings suggesting that these patients may have a motor 
subtype of Alzheimer's disease. This could influence future clinical trials.
HIGHLIGHTS: The α-synuclein seed amplification assay (αSyn-SAA) is a robust 
assay. αSyn-SAA-negative Parkinson's disease shows a distinct motor-cognitive 
phenotype. Autopsy showed Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology in parkinsonian 
diseases. AD stands as a major clinical confounder for the diagnosis of movement 
disorders.

Down syndrome (DS), stemming from the triplication of human chromosome 21, 
results in intellectual disability, with early mid-life onset of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) pathology. Early interventions to reduce cognitive impairments and 
neuropathology are lacking. One modality, maternal choline supplementation 
(MCS), has shown beneficial effects on behavior and gene expression in 
neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, including trisomic mice. 
Loss of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs) and other DS/AD relevant 
hallmarks were observed in a well-established trisomic model (Ts65Dn, Ts). MCS 
attenuates these endophenotypes with beneficial behavioral effects in trisomic 
offspring. We postulate MCS ameliorates dysregulated cellular mechanisms within 
vulnerable BFCNs, with attenuation driven by novel gene expression. Here, 
choline acetyltransferase immunohistochemical labeling identified BFCNs in the 
medial septal/ventral diagonal band nuclei of the basal forebrain in Ts and 
normal disomic (2N) offspring at ~11 months of age from dams exposed to MCS or 
normal choline during the perinatal period. BFCNs (~500 per mouse) were 
microisolated and processed for RNA-sequencing. Bioinformatic assessment 
elucidated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and pathway alterations in the 
context of genotype (Ts, 2N) and maternal diet (MCS, normal choline). MCS 
attenuated select dysregulated DEGs and relevant pathways in aged BFCNs. 
Trisomic MCS-responsive improvements included pathways such as cognitive 
impairment and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide signaling, among others, 
indicative of increased behavioral and bioenergetic fitness. Although MCS does 
not eliminate the DS/AD phenotype, early choline delivery provides long-lasting 
benefits to aged trisomic BFCNs, indicating that MCS prolongs neuronal health in 
the context of DS/AD.

BACKGROUND: Agitation is a common and distressing neuropsychiatric symptom in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), affecting up to half of patients and contributing to 
faster cognitive decline and caregiver burden. Brexpiprazole, a 
serotonin-dopamine modulator, has been evaluated for this indication, but 
uncertainties remain regarding its efficacy, safety, and appropriate use in 
older adults.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of brexpiprazole for the 
treatment of agitation in older adults with AD through a systematic review and 
meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
METHODS: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and 
Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines and the Cochrane Handbook, we included 
RCTs comparing brexpiprazole (0.5-3 mg/day) with placebo in older adults with a 
clinical diagnosis of AD. Primary outcomes were agitation severity (measured 
using the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory [CMAI]), clinical impression 
(clinical global impression-severity scale [CGI-S]), neuropsychiatric symptoms 
(Neuropsychiatric Inventory [NPI]), and adverse events. Risk ratios (RR) and 
mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were pooled using a 
random-effects model. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed using 
frequentist and Bayesian models in R (version 4.3.0).
RESULTS: A total of five RCTs (N = 1770) met the inclusion criteria. 
Brexpiprazole was associated with a modest reduction in agitation CMAI (MD 
- 5.79; 95% CI - 9.55 to - 2.04; prediction interval: - 14.07 to 2.49) and 
improved CGI-S scores (MD - 0.23; 95% CI - 0.32 to - 0.13; prediction interval: 
- 0.39 to - 0.06). No significant differences were found in NPI scores. Adverse 
events such as extrapyramidal symptoms and daytime somnolence occurred more 
frequently with brexpiprazole but with wide and nonsignificant intervals. 
Meta-regression did not identify dose or duration as effect modifiers.
CONCLUSIONS: Brexpiprazole may offer modest short-term benefits for agitation in 
AD without cognitive worsening, but safety signals remain imprecise. However, 
prediction intervals indicate considerable uncertainty, and its use should be 
individualized and closely monitored. Future trials should prioritize long-term 
outcomes and patient-centered measures.

BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic metabolic disorder associated 
with an elevated risk of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), notably Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). The insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) plays a key role 
in both T2D and ND pathogenesis by regulating neuroinflammation and neuronal 
survival. However, the precise molecular mechanisms linking T2D to NDs remain 
unclear.
OBJECTIVES: This study investigates how IGF1R-mediated immunomodulatory pathways 
could be leveraged for therapeutic purposes in T2D-related neurodegeneration. It 
further explores the combined effects of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and 
structured exercise on IGF1R signaling and their potential to mitigate 
T2D-induced neurodegenerative changes.
METHODS: Bioinformatics analyses and in vitro experiments were conducted using 
SH-SY5Y neuronal cells and primary mouse cortical neurons exposed to 
amyloid-beta (Aβ) toxicity. IGF1R was overexpressed, and cells were treated with 
CS at varying concentrations. Cell viability, apoptosis, inflammatory cytokines, 
oxidative stress markers, and macrophage polarization were assessed using CCK-8, 
flow cytometry, ELISA, fluorescence microscopy, and related methods.
RESULTS: Elevated IGF1R expression reduced Aβ-induced neuronal death and 
inflammation. CS administration increased IL-10 levels, suppressing 
pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α), and promoted M2-like macrophage 
polarization, enhancing neurotrophic factors, such as brain-derived neurotrophic 
factor (BDNF) and anti-inflammatory responses.
CONCLUSIONS: IGF1R is pivotal in regulating neuroinflammation and neuronal 
apoptosis in T2D-associated neurodegeneration. Combined TCM and structured 
exercise may beneficially modulate IGF1R-dependent signaling and protect 
neurons. Further clinical studies are needed to validate these findings and 
assess their therapeutic potential.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Scutellaria litwinowii Bornm. & Sint., native to 
Iran, belongs to the Lamiaceae family, Scutellaria species are widely used in 
traditional medicine for treating inflammation, infections, and Neurological 
diseases.
AIM OF THE STUDY: This research aimed to assess the neuroprotective effects of 
S. litwinowii fractions, focusing on anti-acetylcholinesterase (anti-AChE), 
antioxidant, and anti-apoptotic activities.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Oxidative stress and apoptosis were created utilizing 
aluminum chloride (AlCl3) in PC12 cells. The neuroprotective effect was assessed 
using resazurin assays, while reactive oxygen species (ROS), AChE and 
glutathione (GSH) were assessed using DCF-DA and Ellman's Reagent, respectively. 
Apoptotic cells, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release were also evaluated. 
Western blot analysis detected the expression of β-Catenin, Survivin, and 
phosphorylated SAPK JNK/SAPKJNK. A dichloromethane (DCM) root fraction underwent 
HPLC and LC-ESI-MS profiling to identify active anti-AChE compounds.
RESULTS: 48 h treatment with 5 mM AlCl3 decreased cell viability by 27 %. 
Pretreatment with the DCM fraction at 6.25 and 12.5 μg/ml significantly improved 
viability, reduced ROS and LDH release, and prevented GSH depletion, comparable 
to the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (p < 0.001). At a 12.5 μg/ml, the DCM 
fraction inhibited AChE activity by 63.61 %, while 12.5 μM baicalein showed 
59.11 % inhibition. The DCM fraction and baicalein significantly reduced 
AlCl3-induced apoptosis (p < 0.001), increased of β-Catenin, Survivin expression 
and decreased p-JNK/JNK ratio (p < 0.001). In the active time window, baicalein 
and wogonin were detected.
CONCLUSION: This research suggests that S. litwinowii and baicalein may serve as 
protective agents against oxidative stress and apoptosis-related cell damage.

Age-related hearing loss (ARHL) has emerged as a significant and potentially 
modifiable risk factor for neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's 
disease. A growing body of evidence links ARHL to structural and functional 
changes in the brain, with implications for cognitive decline and dementia 
onset. However, both ARHL and dementia are multifactorial conditions shaped not 
only by biological mechanisms but also by broader social determinants of health. 
Inequities in access to hearing care, underrepresentation of marginalised 
populations in research, and variability in intervention outcomes emphasise the 
need for a more inclusive and integrated approach to prevention. This review 
synthesises current evidence on the neurocognitive consequences of ARHL, the 
potential mechanistic pathways linking hearing loss to dementia, and the role of 
inequity. It includes a novel perspective by highlighting the need for 
cross-cultural, population neuroscience approaches incorporating exposome and 
equity frameworks that capture phenotypic variability across diverse 
populations. This review outlines key priorities for advancing neurocognitive 
and translational research on hearing loss, neurodegeneration, and global health 
equity. Addressing these gaps is essential to developing equitable strategies 
for dementia prevention and optimising cognitive health across the lifespan.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that leads 
to cognitive decline, memory loss, and impairment in daily functioning, making 
up nearly 60 % of all dementia cases. Current treatments primarily manage 
symptoms rather than address the disease itself, underscoring the need for more 
effective solutions. Therapeutic peptides have emerged as promising candidates, 
targeting critical pathological processes in AD. Additionally, intranasal 
delivery offers significant advantages, including non-invasiveness, enhanced 
stability, rapid absorption, and the ability to bypass the blood-brain barrier. 
This review explores the potential of intranasal peptide delivery for AD 
treatment, beginning with an overview of the disease's mechanisms and existing 
therapies. We discuss the challenges of targeting the brain, examine 
nose-to-brain delivery pathways, and highlight recent advancements in delivery 
techniques, including the role of nanoparticles in improving efficacy. Our goal 
is to encourage further research into these innovative delivery strategies that 
could improve patient compliance and treatment outcomes. While preclinical 
studies indicate substantial promise, advancing these findings into clinical 
applications remains crucial to overcoming drug delivery challenges and ensuring 
long-term safety.

Monitoring beta-amyloid1-42 (Aβ42) is vital and challenging, which is a typical 
biomarker of Alzheimer's disease. Here, a novel electrochemical microbiosensor 
is developed to detect Aβ42 on an acupuncture needle. Hemin is well known for 
its characteristics, including its ability to self-assemble on single-walled 
carbon nanotube (SWCNT), the molecular interaction with Aβ42, and the intrinsic 
electroactive signal. These properties are exploited to anchor and respond to 
Aβ42 after integrating a molecularly imprinted surface polymer (SMIP). The SMIP 
layer of polydopamine/poly (ionic liquid) can be prepared by 
electropolymerization on an acupuncture needle microelectrode (ANME), which 
undergoes growth and formation of a polymeric structure around the anchored 
Aβ42. Interestingly, the imprinted cavities express a fluent signal of built-in 
hemin after eluting the templates, and show a highly selective and sensitive 
hindrance response for the recombined Aβ42. Under optimized conditions, the 
microbiosensor displays a linear range of 100 to 1 × 1010 fM with a limit of 
detection of 0.05 fM. There are development and advances for the discipline of 
electroanalysis after comparing the technique and important indicators with the 
electrochemical biosensors reported of Aβ42. The microbiosensor also exhibited 
excellent selectivity, good stability, and reproducibility, which was 
effectively used to detect Aβ42 in real spiked samples. The improved behavior of 
the developed microbiosensor can be attributed to its superficial highly matched 
imprinted cavities, built-in hemin label, and electronic barrier without signal 
of the nonimprinted surface to outside molecules. This microbiosensor has a 
scientific and reference value for directly sensing non-electroactive 
biomarkers, functionalizing microelectrodes, and electron transport cavities. It 
would also be amazing if this new microbiosensor could combine with the unclear 
and magical property of acupuncture in the treatment of neurological disorders.

Recently, butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) has emerged as a potential therapeutic 
target for advanced Alzheimer's disease (AD). Herein, 20 novel carbamate-based 
N-benzoyl tryptamine derivatives were designed and synthesized by integrating a 
BChE-targeting fragment with the original carrier scaffold, which possesses good 
anti-neuroinflammatory activity. Among them, N14 was proved to be the most 
potent and highly selective BChE inhibitor [eqBChE IC50 = 18.00 ± 0.485 pM, 
selectivity index (SI) = 84,7252, hBChE IC50 = 1.50 ± 0.155 nM], which is 388 
times greater than the BChE inhibitor previously identified by our research 
group. Additionally, N14 showed superior neuroprotective effects against 
Aβ1-42-induced injury model and inhibitory effects on Aβ1-42 self-aggregation 
compared to rivastigmine. Moreover, N14 could significantly ameliorate 
scopolamine-induced cognition impairment. Notably, N14 exhibited a superior 
capacity in the regulation of BChE and acetylcholine levels in the mouse 
hippocampus compared to rivastigmine, indicating that a highly selective BChE 
inhibitor possesses more pronounced efficacy to rectify cholinergic system 
dysfunction. Furthermore, N14 demonstrated a high safety profile, good 
pharmacokinetic properties and favorable BBB permeability in vivo. Especially, 
N14 had a 3-fold longer half-life T1/2 than the BChE inhibitor developed by our 
group. Therefore, the highly selective BChE inhibitor N14 is a promising 
multifunctional lead compound for treating AD.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Previous studies have identified Chuanxiong Renshen 
decoction as a promising anti-Alzheimer's disease (AD) agent, with its 
brain-penetrating components characterized via UHPLC-MS/MS. This study further 
elucidates the anti-neuroinflammatory mechanisms of Chuanxiong-Renshen medicine 
pair (CRM) in AD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 3 × Tg-AD mice were administered CRM for two months, and 
cognitive function was evaluated using novel object recognition (NOR) and Morris 
water maze (MWM) tests. Neuroinflammation and pathological markers were assessed 
via multiplex immunofluorescence (targeting Iba-1, CD86+, P-Tau, and APP), 
hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, and network pharmacology. Serum metabolomics 
(UHPLC-MS/MS) and 16S rRNA sequencing were employed to analyze metabolic and gut 
microbiota alterations. In vitro, LPS-stimulated BV-2 microglia were treated 
with CRM-containing serum, followed by evaluation of CD86+ expression (flow 
cytometry), pro-inflammatory cytokines, and PKC-α/NF-κB pathway proteins. 
Pathway specificity was further validated using the PKC-α inhibitor Gö6976.
RESULTS: CRM significantly ameliorated cognitive deficits and reduced Iba-1, 
CD86+, P-Tau, and APP expression in 3 × Tg-AD mice. Mechanistically, CRM 
suppressed PKC-α/NF-κB signaling, down-regulating iNOS, COX-2, and p-NF-κB p65 
in microglia, with synergistic effects observed upon PKC-α inhibition. 
Additionally, CRM modulated gut microbiota composition, notably reducing 
Proteobacteria abundance, which correlated with hippocampal Iba-1 and APP 
levels.
CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that CRM exerts neuroprotective effects 
in AD through dual mechanisms: inhibition of PKC-α/NF-κB-mediated 
neuroinflammation and restoration of gut microbiota homeostasis. Thus, CRM 
represents a promising multi-target therapeutic strategy for AD.

To define how Aβ pathology alters microglia function in Alzheimer’s disease, we 
profiled the microglia surfaceome following treatment with Aβ fibrils. Our 
findings reveal that Aβ-associated human microglia upregulate Glypican 4 (GPC4), 
a GPI-anchored heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG). Glial GPC4 expression 
exacerbates motor deficits and reduces lifespan in a Drosophila amyloidosis 
model, implicating GPC4 in a toxic neurodegenerative program. In cell culture, 
GPC4 enhances microglia phagocytosis of tau aggregates, and shed GPC4 can act in 
trans to facilitate tau aggregate uptake and seeding in neurons. Additionally, 
our data demonstrate that GPC4-mediated effects are amplified in the presence of 
APOE. In human Alzheimer’s disease brain, microglial GPC4 expression surrounding 
Aβ plaques correlates with neuritic tau pathology, supporting a pathological 
link between amyloid, GPC4, and tau. These studies define a mechanistic pathway 
by which Aβ primes microglia to promote tau pathology via HSPGs and APOE.

The study aimed to identify the potential acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors 
for effective Alzheimer's treatment from existing FDA-approved drugs through a 
drug repurposing technique via computational tools. Further, to evaluate the 
anti-Alzheimer's potency of the identified drug with the help of a suitable drug 
delivery system through in vivo pharmacological studies. The molecular docking 
and dynamics simulation studies indicated that letrozole has a significant 
binding affinity of -9.6 kcal/mol and a better interaction with AChE. The 
physicochemical properties of letrozole-encapsulated solid lipid nanoparticles 
(L-SLNs) were characterized and confirmed. Initially, acute toxicity tests of 
L-SLNs were performed according to OECD 423 guidelines. Biochemical studies 
revealed that L-SLNs significantly decreased brain Acetylcholine esterase 
activity induced by scopolamine, but L-SLNs significantly increased AChE 
activity compared to the Shaam control group. Histopathological evaluation of 
brain regions revealed significant insights into the neuroprotective potential 
of L-SLNs in an Alzheimer's disease (AD) rat model. Treatment with L-SLNs 
demonstrated dose-dependent neuroprotection across all studied brain regions. At 
a low dose of L-SLNs (2.5 mg/kg), neuronal and glial cells in the cortical and 
hippocampal regions showed improved regularity, although some disorganization 
persisted. At a mid-dose of L-SLNs (5 mg/kg), the histopathological architecture 
further normalized, with neurons and glial cells exhibiting regular arrangement 
and morphology akin to normal cells. The high dose of L-SLNs (10 mg/kg) provided 
the most significant protection, with neuronal and glial cells displaying 
near-normal arrangement and morphology in the cortical, hippocampal, and 
Substantia Nigra regions. This study highlights the importance of SLNs-based 
drug delivery systems in improving the efficacy of existing therapeutic agents 
in neurodegenerative conditions.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) total tau (t-tau) is considered a biomarker of 
neuronal degeneration alongside brain atrophy and fluid neurofilament light 
chain protein (NfL) in biomarker models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, 
previous studies show that CSF t-tau correlates strongly with synaptic 
dysfunction/degeneration biomarkers like neurogranin (Ng) and 
synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP25). Here, we compare the association 
between CSF t-tau and synaptic degeneration and axonal/neuronal degeneration 
biomarkers in cognitively unimpaired and impaired groups from two independent 
cohorts. We observe a stronger correlation between CSF t-tau and synaptic 
biomarkers than neurodegeneration biomarkers in both groups. Synaptic biomarkers 
explain a greater proportion of variance in CSF t-tau levels compared to 
neurodegeneration biomarkers. Notably, CSF t-tau levels are elevated in 
individuals with abnormalities only in synaptic biomarkers, but not in 
individuals with abnormalities only in neurodegeneration biomarkers. Our 
findings suggest that CSF t-tau is a closer proxy for synaptic degeneration than 
for axonal/neuronal degeneration.

Masticatory dysfunction is a risk factor for Alzheimer 's disease (AD), likely 
due to the trigeminal influences on the Locus Coeruleus (LC), a structure 
implicated in neurodegenerative processes and whose activity level is reflected 
by pupil size. Chewing activity acutely stimulates cognitive performance by 
increasing LC activation during task, as reflected by an increased pupil 
dilatation (mydriasis). The presence of a trigeminal sensorimotor imbalance is 
associated to an asymmetry in LC activity (reflected by an asymmetry in pupil 
size) and is detrimental for performance. These observations prompt for 
developing testing procedure, in normal elders and in patients affected by AD, 
aimed to: 1) study the presence of trigeminal asymmetries and to assess the 
possible contribution of occlusal correction in improving the subject's 
condition and in preventing/delaying the AD development; 2) verify the 
stimulating effect of chewing on cognitive performance and task-related 
mydriasis as an estimate of the LC excitability for determining the subject 
condition and its susceptibility to undergo AD development. Procedures 
appropriate for achieving these goals are proposed.

The prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD) 
and Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the U.S. is expected to increase as the 
population ages. Despite significant advancements in neurodegenerative research, 
the initiating events remain unclear, and no treatments currently exist to stop 
or reverse disease pathogenesis. Emerging studies highlight the importance of 
the gut microbiome and gut-brain-axis in the pathogenesis of many human 
diseases. This narrative review aims to integrate current research investigating 
how gut microbial dysbiosis may influence the development and progression of AD 
and PD. First, we provide an overview of the pathological features and disease 
mechanisms characteristic of AD and PD. Next, we summarize existing research on 
the microbiome-gut-brain axis and how alterations in gut microbiota composition 
may influence these neurological diseases. We then focus on specific bacterial 
taxa identified in fecal samples from AD and PD patients, highlighting 
differences from healthy controls and emphasizing taxa known to produce 
immunologically relevant metabolites and antigens. Specifically, we examine 
reductions in short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria and increases in 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-expressing bacteria that may drive neuroinflammation 
and contribute to protein misfolding. Finally, this review presents hypothesized 
mechanisms by which microbial products such as SCFAs and LPS may interact with 
host physiology to modulate disease pathogenesis. These include pathways 
involving systemic inflammation, blood-brain barrier permeability, and neural 
propagation via the vagus nerve or olfactory bulb. Further research is necessary 
to determine the causes and effects of bacterial level shifts, but understanding 
the mechanistic roles of these bacterial products in AD or PD pathogenesis could 
allow for personalized targeted therapies to either slow or potentially reverse 
the disease process.

IMPORTANCE: The success of recent randomized clinical trials (RCTs) for 
Alzheimer disease (AD), particularly those focusing on anti-amyloid therapies, 
has been discussed at length. However, the evolution of RCT design features for 
AD that preceded this success remain underexplored.
OBJECTIVE: To describe temporal changes in the features of RCT design for 
interventions in AD.
EVIDENCE REVIEW: PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched in 
January 2025 for phase 2 and 3 AD RCTs published between January 1992 and 
December 2024. RCTs that investigated an intervention for AD, with a placebo or 
standard-of-care control group, were included. Four assessors independently 
reviewed full-text articles to capture study characteristics.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The number of participants and the duration of RCTs 
as well as the target population, outcomes, and funding were extracted from 
published reports. These features were analyzed with respect to time using 
linear regression and χ2 analyses.
RESULTS: The study included 203 RCTs with 79 589 participants testing 
interventions in AD. From 1992 to 2024, the mean sample size increased by 464% 
for phase 2 RCTs (from 42 to 237), and 50% for phase 3 RCTs (from 632 to 951), 
while the mean trial duration increased by 188% (from 16 to 46 weeks) for phase 
2, and 256% (from 20 to 71 weeks) for phase 3 RCTs. This longer duration of RCTs 
may be partially attributed by a greater share of disease-modifying rather than 
symptomatic treatments. Similarly, more recent trials required AD biomarker 
evidence for enrollment (from 1 of 36 [2.7%] before 2006 to 40 of 76 [52.6%] 
since 2019). A substantial difference in the type of therapeutics researched was 
observed, with anti-amyloid and anti-tau RCTs being more likely to be funded by 
the pharmaceutical industry compared with neurotransmitter or other RCTs 
(anti-amyloid or anti-tau, 68 of 71 [95.8%]; neurotransmitter, 52 of 69 [77.6%]; 
other, 33 of 52 [63.5%]). RCT transparency improved, with more frequent data 
accessibility statements, registered reports, and better reporting on race and 
ethnicity.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This methodology research of AD RCTs highlights 
substantial changes in key features of AD clinical trials from 1992 to 2024. AD 
RCTs have become larger and longer, such that they are powered to detect smaller 
clinical differences. The increased sample sizes and duration should enable the 
detection of smaller and more slowly occurring outcomes, which may lead to 
successful RCTs of therapies with slower and more subtle efficacy.

Cognitive decline is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cannabidiol (CBD), 
a non-intoxicating phytocannabinoid with immunomodulatory properties, shows 
promise in alleviating AD symptoms. This study examined the effects of chronic 
CBD treatment in a male rat model of sporadic AD induced by 
intracerebroventricular streptozotocin (ICV-STZ) and explored its impact on 
neuroinflammatory genes and cannabinoid signaling. STZ rats showed impaired 
performance in object location and recognition tasks, along with reduced social 
behavior. STZ exposure also affected AD-related hippocampal markers, leading to 
increased levels of amyloid β-protein (Aβ) and tau phosphorylation (p-Tau) and 
elevated mRNA levels of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) 
and apolipoprotein E4 (APOEε4). Additionally, STZ increased hippocampal 
neuroinflammatory markers, including mRNA levels of Tumor Necrosis Factor α 
(TNF-α), nuclear factor kappa B subunit 1 (NF-κB1), and interleukin (IL)-1β. It 
also altered cannabinoid receptor expression, with cannabinoid receptor 1 (cnr1) 
and 2 (cnr2) genes upregulated in the dentate gyrus (DG), whereas in the CA1, 
cnr2 was upregulated and cnr1 downregulated. Chronic CBD treatment restored the 
STZ-induced behavioral deficits, reduced neuroinflammatory marker expression, 
and mitigated AD-associated changes. Importantly, the CB1 receptor antagonist 
AM251, but not CB2 antagonist AM630, blocked the beneficial effects of CBD on 
performance in object location and social tasks in STZ-treated rats, 
highlighting CB1 receptor activation as a key mechanism. These findings suggest 
that CBD holds promise as a therapeutic agent for inflammation-induced AD, with 
the potential to ameliorate cognitive deficits and prevent disease onset through 
mechanisms involving CB1 receptor activation and modulation of 
neuroinflammation.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, 
characterized by cognitive decline and neuronal degeneration. The formation of 
amyloid β plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are key morphological features of 
AD pathology. However, the specific molecules responsible for the cell 
destruction triggered by amyloid β and tau proteinopathies in AD has not yet 
been identified. Here we use the 5xFAD mouse model of AD to investigate the role 
of a recently discovered death signaling complex which consists of the 
extrasynaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) and the transient receptor 
potential cation channel subfamily M member 4 (TRPM4). The NMDAR/TRPM4 death 
complex is responsible for toxic signaling of glutamate, which has been 
implicated in AD pathogenesis. We detected an increase in NMDAR/TRPM4 death 
complex formation in the brains of 5xFAD mice. This increase was blocked by the 
oral application of FP802, a small molecule TwinF interface inhibitor that can 
disrupt and thereby detoxify the NMDAR/TRPM4 death complex. FP802 treatment 
prevented the cognitive decline of 5xFAD mice assessed using a series of memory 
tasks. It also preserved the structural complexity of dendrites, prevented the 
loss of synapses, reduced amyloid β plaque formation, and protected against 
pathological alterations of mitochondria. These results identify the NMDAR/TRPM4 
death complex as a major promoter of AD disease progression, amplifying 
potentially self-perpetuating pathological processes initiated by amyloid β. 
TwinF interface inhibitors offer a novel therapeutic avenue, serving as an 
alternative or complementary treatment to antibody-mediated clearing of amyloid 
β from AD brains.

BACKGROUND: Positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of muscarinic receptors (M) 
have been shown to effectively prevent cognitive dysfunctions associated with 
dementias, but little is known about their impact on NO֗-dependent pathways, in 
particular eNOS expression, L-arginine metabolism and its derivatives 
(ADMA/SDMA/NMMA) production.
METHODS: Biochemical studies were performed in frontal cortices, hippocampi and 
plasma samples from mice that were administered with MK-801 
(schizophrenia-related dementa) or scopolamine (Alzheimer's disease model) for 
14 days alone or together with muscarinic receptors modulators: VU0357017 (M1) 
and VU0152100 (M4). Western blot was used to measure eNOS, DDAH1 and PRMT5, 
while mass spectrometry was used to measure the levels of L-arginine 
derivatives. Behavioral studies aimed to investigate the procognitive effects of 
the combined administration of PAMs with NO• releasers, spermineNONOate or 
DETANONOate were performed in novel object recognition (NOR) test, in 
scopolamine- or MK-801- induced amnesia.
RESULTS: Our results indicate that MK-801 or scopolamine disturb eNOS, DDAH1, 
PRMT5 expression, and L-arginine bioavailability. VU0357017 or VU0152100 
prevented scopolamine or MK-801-induced eNOS dysfunction, but L-arginine 
derivatives synthesis was inhibited only in MK-801 model. Synergistic effect 
with NO֗ releasers was observed in NOR.
CONCLUSIONS: eNOS expression and L-arginine bioavailability may contribute to 
antipsychotic action of VU0357017 or VU0152100. The antialzheimer's effect to a 
lesser extend involves normalization of L-arginine metabolism. The joint 
administration of the compounds with NO֗ releaser could be proposed as 
synergistic treatment for both schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) currently lacks effective therapeutics, but 
blood-brain-barrier-penetrating flavonoids show promising therapeutic potential. 
To address this critical need, we employed a novel network medicine framework to 
systematically identify flavonoid compounds for AD therapy by quantifying their 
network proximity to AD targets. Our systematic screening identified 48 
potential anti-AD flavonoids, of which luteolin, quercetin, apigenin (API), and 
baicalein demonstrated significant neuroprotective effects in A[Formula: see 
text]25-35-induced rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cell models. Of these, API 
emerged as the most promising candidate. A network pharmacological analysis 
revealed that API likely exerts its anti-AD effects through modulating apoptosis 
and inflammatory response, and AKT1 and NFKBIA were identified as key 
therapeutic targets. Experimental validation demonstrated that API treatment 
impeded the H2O2-induced decline in the mitochondrial membrane potential of PC12 
cells, suppressed apoptosis, and mitigated neuronal damage. Furthermore, API 
downregulated the AKT/NF-[Formula: see text]B signal pathway, promoted 
microglial M2 polarization, and attenuated LPS-induced neuroinflammation in BV2 
cells. API also alleviated the toxic effects of M1 microglia on neurons. This 
network-based screening strategy provides an innovative approach for developing 
new AD therapeutics.

BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury is an environmental risk factor that may 
accelerate the progression of Alzheimer's disease and behavioral and 
psychological symptoms of dementia in patients with mild cognitive impairment.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether traumatic brain injury in patients with mild 
cognitive impairment is associated with an increased risk of progression to 
Alzheimer's disease dementia and behavioral and psychological symptoms of 
dementia.
DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study using the Korean National Health Insurance 
Service database.
SETTING: National-level health data covering healthcare utilization, diagnoses, 
prescriptions, and procedures in South Korea from January 2012 to December 2021.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment between January 
1, 2013, and December 31, 2016, were followed until Alzheimer's disease dementia 
diagnosis, behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia occurrence, death, 
or December 31, 2021. These patients were classified into two groups according 
to the presence of traumatic brain injury during the follow-up period.
MEASUREMENTS: Age at the time of mild cognitive impairment diagnosis, sex, 
income level, the presence of several chronic conditions, presence of traumatic 
brain injury, progression of Alzheimer's disease dementia, and behavioral and 
psychological symptoms of dementia RESULTS: We assessed 452,718 patients (mean 
age: 67.16 years). Traumatic brain injury was significantly associated with an 
increased risk of Alzheimer's disease dementia progression (hazard ratio = 
1.252, 95 % confidence interval: 1.206-1.301), particularly among patients aged 
<65 years (hazard ratio = 1.560, 95 % confidence interval: 1.391-1.749), and was 
linked to a higher risk of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia 
following Alzheimer's disease dementia diagnosis (hazard ratio = 1.300, 95 % 
confidence interval: 1.181-1.431).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results underscore the importance of traumatic brain injury 
prevention in patients with mild cognitive impairment for mitigating the 
progression and neuropsychiatric complications of Alzheimer's disease.

BACKGROUND: Tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease, are characterized by 
progressive neurodegeneration manifesting as motor and cognitive impairments. 
This study evaluated the therapeutic potential of semaglutide, a clinically 
approved glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, in the rTg4510 mouse model of 
tauopathy.
METHODS: Starting at three months of age, rTg4510 mice and wild-type littermates 
received semaglutide (0.10 mg kg-1, intraperitoneal) or vehicle (PBS) every 
other day for 16 weeks. Motor coordination, anxiety-like behavior, spatial 
working memory, and associative fear memory were assessed using behavioral 
paradigms. Tau accumulation was monitored via 18F-PM-PBB3 micro-PET/CT imaging. 
Immunohistochemistry and immunoblot analyses quantified tau pathology, neuronal 
integrity, and glial activation.
RESULTS: Semaglutide significantly improved motor coordination in rTg4510 mice 
on the pole test, though not rotarod endurance. While spontaneous locomotion, 
anxiety-like behaviors, and Y-maze spatial working memory remained unchanged, 
semaglutide significantly enhanced cue-dependent freezing in fear conditioning, 
indicating improved associative memory. 18F-PM-PBB3 PET imaging revealed a 
pronounced reduction in cortical and hippocampal tracer uptake, indicative of 
reduced tau burden. Immunohistochemistry and Western blotting confirmed 
significantly decreased cortical phosphorylated tau (AT8) levels. Semaglutide 
preserved cortical neuronal integrity; however, no hippocampal changes were 
detected, likely due to minimal baseline neuron loss at this age. Astrocytic 
(GFAP) and microglial (Iba1) activation remained unaffected.
CONCLUSION: Semaglutide ameliorated domain-specific motor impairments, enhanced 
associative fear memory, and attenuated cortical tau pathology in rTg4510 mice. 
These findings highlight therapeutic promise of semaglutide as a 
disease-modifying agent for tauopathies, justifying further dose-response, 
mechanistic, and translational studies.

Recently, Transformer has been widely used in medical imaging analysis for its 
competitive potential when given enough data. However, Transformer conducts 
attention on a global scale by utilizing self-attention mechanisms across all 
input patches, thereby requiring substantial computational power and memory, 
especially when dealing with large 3D images such as MRI images. In this study, 
we proposed Residual Global Scoring Network (ResGSNet), a novel architecture 
combining ResNet with Global Scoring Module (GSM), achieving high computational 
efficiency while incorporating both local and global features. First, our 
proposed GSM utilized local attention to conduct information exchange within 
local brain regions, subsequently assigning global scores to each of these local 
regions, demonstrating the capability to encapsulate local and global 
information with reduced computational burden and superior performance compared 
to existing methods. Second, we utilized Grad-CAM＋＋ and the Attention Map to 
interpret model predictions, uncovering brain regions related to Alzheimer's 
Disease (AD) Detection. Third, our extensive experiments on the ADNI dataset 
show that our proposed ResGSNet achieved satisfactory performance with 95.1% 
accuracy in predicting AD, a 1.3% increase compared to state-of-the-art methods, 
and 93.4% accuracy for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Our model for detecting 
MCI can potentially serve as a screening tool for identifying individuals at 
high risk of developing AD and allow for early intervention. Furthermore, the 
Grad-CAM＋＋ and Attention Map not only identified brain regions commonly 
associated with AD and MCI but also revealed previously undiscovered regions, 
including putamen, cerebellum cortex, and caudate nucleus, holding promise for 
further research into the etiology of AD.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify the optimal dose range of physical 
exercise for improving executive function in individuals with Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) and to compare the dose-dependent cognitive response profiles 
across different exercise modalities.
METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted across five 
databases-PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science-up 
to June 20, 2025, with no language restrictions. All analyses were performed in 
R (version 4.4.2). A Bayesian framework was used to model continuous 
dose-response curves and to evaluate the relative effects of aerobic training, 
integrated physical training, and resistance exercise within a network 
structure.
RESULTS: Exercise interventions demonstrated a nonlinear relationship with 
executive function, with the strongest effect observed at approximately 1000 
MET-min/week. Among exercise types, continuous aerobic training showed 
significant improvement at 670 MET-min/week, indicating a relatively low-dose 
threshold for benefit. In contrast, integrated physical training programs 
required higher doses (around 1200 MET-min/week) to reach peak effect, 
suggesting greater intensity dependence. Resistance training did not yield 
consistent or statistically significant outcomes across the tested dose levels.
CONCLUSION: This study establishes a quantitative framework that integrates dose 
modeling with intervention structure to guide exercise-based cognitive 
strategies for AD. The findings emphasize the need to match exercise volume to 
modality demands and individual capacity, supporting the development of 
precision-oriented, non-pharmacological interventions. The identified optimal 
range (670-1200 MET-min/week) aligns with WHO recommendations for older adults, 
reinforcing both feasibility and translational potential.

Inhibition of amyloidogenic-protein oligomerization and aggregation is a 
promising therapy-development strategy for proteinopathies, such as Alzheimer's 
and Parkinson's diseases, in which proteins self-associate into a variety of 
abnormal, toxic assemblies. Despite discovery of numerous compounds modulating 
the self-assembly process in vitro, few have reached advanced clinical trials, 
and none have translated into effective therapy to date. A potential reason is a 
lack of clear mechanistic understanding of the interaction between the 
inhibitors/modulators and the target metastable protein assemblies. A unique 
class of compounds targets specifically Lys residues, which have been shown to 
be important mediators of many amyloidogenic-protein aberrant self-assembly 
processes due to their participation in both electrostatic and hydrophobic 
interactions. Although seemingly paradoxical, as these compounds do not target a 
specific protein, compounds targeting Lys show a remarkable ability to 
selectively disrupt the interactions mediating abnormal protein self-assembly. 
Such compounds include covalent and noncovalent Lys-binding small molecules, as 
well as agents controlling Lys-post-translational modification (PTM). Recent 
advances in this area show that the application of Lys-targeting inhibitors in 
antiamyloid drug discovery campaigns and Lys-reactive rational-design approaches 
have led to intriguing results in multiple systems, including animal models of 
various proteinopathies. As this strategy is applicable and promising for 
targeting most of the proteins involved in proteinopathies, including amyloid 
β-protein, tau, and α-synuclein, here we highlight Lys-binding inhibitors of 
abnormal protein self-assembly leading to preclinical therapeutic applications 
for the central nervous system.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia. 
Genetic polymorphisms are associated with altered risks of AD onset, pointing to 
biological processes and potential targets for interventions. Consistent with 
the important roles of microglia in AD development, genetic mutations of several 
genes expressed on microglia have been identified as risks for AD. Emerging 
evidences indicate that the expression of a microglia-specific gene MS4A6A is 
thought to be associated with AD, since AD patients show upregulation of MS4A6A, 
and its levels correlate with the severity of clinical neuropathology. However, 
the mechanism linking MS4A6A and AD has not been experimentally studied.
METHODS: We performed a meta genome-wide association analysis with 734,121 
subjects to examine the associations between polymorphisms of MS4A6A with AD 
risks. In addition, we analyzed the correlation between MS4A6A and AD-related 
cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers from our own cohort. Furthermore, we for the 
first time generated a Ms4a6d deficient APP/PS1 model, and systematically 
examined pathological changes using high-resolution microscopy, biochemistry, 
and behavioral analysis.
RESULTS: We identified several new mutations of MS4A6A with altered AD risks, 
and discovered specific correlation for some of them with the amount of 
β-amyloid in cerebrospinal fluid. Protective variant of MS4A6A is associated 
with elevated expression of the gene. Deficient Ms4a6d led to reduced amyloid 
clearance in the brain. Immunostaining from postmortem AD patients brain 
revealed selective expression of MS4A6A in microglia. In APP/PS1 mice lacking 
Ms4a6d, microglia showed markedly diminished envelopment and phagocytosis of 
amyloid, leading to increased plaque burden, less compact structure, and more 
severe synaptic damage. Importantly, Ms4a6d deficiency markedly exacerbated 
inflammatory responses in both microglia and astrocytes by disinhibiting NF-κB 
signaling. Overexpressing MS4A6A in human microglia cell line promoted gene 
expression related to plaque-associated responses and diminished inflammation 
signatures.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal that Ms4a6d deficiency suppresses 
neuroprotection and worsens neuroinflammation. Sufficient Ms4a6d maybe 
beneficial for boosting amyloid-related responses and suppressing inflammation 
in microglia, making it superior than previously reported candidates for 
microglia modulation. Thus, the elevated MS4A6A levels in AD are likely 
compensatory and boosting MS4A6A could be an effective treatment.

Prediction-powered inference (PPI) (Angelopoulos et al., Science 
382(6671):669-674, 2023) and its subsequent development called PPI++ 
(Angelopoulos et al., 2023) provide a novel approach to standard statistical 
estimation, leveraging machine learning systems, to enhance unlabeled data with 
predictions. We use this paradigm in clinical trials. The predictions are 
provided by disease progression models, providing prognostic scores for all the 
participants as a function of baseline covariates. The proposed method would 
empower clinical trials by providing untreated digital twins of the treated 
patients while remaining statistically valid. The potential implications of this 
new estimator of the treatment effect in a two-arm randomized clinical trial 
(RCT) are manifold. First, it leads to an overall reduction of the sample size 
required to reach the same power as a standard RCT. Secondly, it advocates for 
an imbalance of controls and treated patients, requiring fewer controls to 
achieve the same power. Finally, this technique directly transfers any disease 
prediction model trained on large cohorts to practical and scientifically valid 
use. In this paper, we demonstrate the theoretical properties of this estimator 
and illustrate them through simulations. We show that it is asymptotically 
unbiased for the Average Treatment Effect and derive an explicit formula for its 
variance. We then compare this estimator to a regression-based linear covariate 
adjustment method. An application to an Alzheimer's disease clinical trial 
showcases the potential to reduce the sample size.

BACKGROUND: Patients and providers experience barriers to early detection of 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. We developed a new primary 
care-based role, the Brain Health Navigator (BHN), who is trained to assess 
patients for cognitive impairment, identify addressable causes, suggest 
appropriate diagnostic testing, connect patients to resources, and assist 
patients in accessing disease-modifying treatments and dementia care management. 
This study describes the BHN role, the feasibility of implementing the BHN in 
Primary Care (PC) clinics, and the initial patients' outcomes for those who saw 
the BHN.
METHODS: Patients ≥65 years were screened with a Digital Cognitive Assessment 
(DCA) in seven PC clinics from June 1, 2022, to May 31, 2023. Patients who 
scored likely cognitively impaired or borderline for impairment were eligible 
for referral to the BHN. Clinics and providers could determine if referrals were 
automatic or on a patient-by-patient basis. The BHN encounter included a 
comprehensive assessment of standardized tools and suggested laboratory and 
imaging studies to facilitate the diagnostic process and connect patients to 
resources, care and treatment, and research opportunities.
RESULTS: 466 of 861 patients with likely impaired or borderline impaired DCA 
results were referred to the BHN.More patients with likely impaired scores 
(62.7%) were referred to the BHN compared to those with borderline scores 
(47.6%). Of the 466 referred patients, 28.9% with likely impaired scores and 
23.5% with borderline scores completed a BHN visit. Patients who were seen by 
the BHN had a significantly higher likelihood of receiving a new diagnosis of 
MCI than patients who did not see the BHN and were more likely to have orders 
for diagnostic tests, such as vitamin B12 thyroid function and Magnetic 
Resonance Imaging of the head and neck. Referrals to both neurology and 
neuropsychology were significantly more common among patients who completed the 
BHN visit.
CONCLUSIONS: A BHN enhances follow-up care and monitoring for patients with 
abnormal cognitive screening tests. A BHN visit increases the rate of 
evidence-based diagnostic evaluation for MCI and dementia in PC.

INTRODUCTION: Subjects with dementia might exhibit criminal risk behavior (CB), 
even in early disease stages.
METHODS: This systematic review and quantitative meta-analysis investigated CB 
prevalence across all neurodegenerative syndromes according to PRISMA criteria 
and preregistered in PROSPERO. Mean frequencies and odds ratios were calculated 
and compared.
RESULTS: Finally, the meta-analysis included 14 studies with 236,360 persons. 
Studies originated from different countries, with largest contributing country 
being the U.S.A., followed by Scandinavian countries, i.e., Sweden and Finland, 
and additionally Germany and Japan. All quantitative analyses revealed a very 
consistent picture: CB prevalence was highest in behavioral variant 
frontotemporal dementia ( >50%), followed by semantic variant primary 
progressive aphasia (40%), but rather low in vascular dementia and Huntington's 
disease (15%), Alzheimer's disease (10%), lowest in Parkinsonian syndromes 
( <10%). The systematic literature review revealed that CB prevalence is more 
frequent in early disease course than in the general population, but declines 
thereafter below population levels. Men are overrepresented.
DISCUSSION: CB is a common symptom in dementia, most pronounced in 
frontotemporal dementia. CB committed for the first time at mid-age could be an 
indicator of incident dementia, requiring earliest diagnosis and therapy. As 
present studies show a wide variability in assessment methods and cohorts 
investigated, and had been conducted in a minority of countries world-wide, 
large prospective international studies are warranted that systematically apply 
homogeneous methods and standardized questionnaires in assessing criminal risk 
behavior in different dementia syndromes.

Many recent progresses in the overall quality of life have allowed for an 
increase in life expectancy, both in humans and in dogs. In addition, long-lived 
individuals may develop neurodegenerative disorders, and one of the most 
important in human medicine is Alzheimer's disease (AD). In veterinary medicine, 
the AD counterpart is Canine Cognitive Dysfunction Syndrome (CCDS), which, 
generally, affects elderly dogs from 8 years of age. These cognitive disorders 
are becoming frequently encountered conditions and, despite researchers' 
attention towards pathogenesis, treatment and diagnosis, more efforts are 
required to outline which clinical and laboratory evaluations must be carried 
out to reach a presumptive antemortem diagnosis of CCDS. The biggest need is the 
establishment of standardized protocols and guidelines for a correct clinical 
and diagnostic approach towards dogs with clinical signs referrable to CCDS. In 
this narrative review, we examined the up-to-date scientific literature on the 
topic, focusing our attention on sensitive and reliable markers for clinical 
antemortem CCDS diagnosis. Even if some parameters analyzed are interesting and 
promising, more investigations are needed to confirm the results obtained so 
far. This is crucial because a correct diagnosis is fundamental to determine the 
best treatment and, thus, to guarantee animals' health and welfare.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common chronic neurodegenerative 
disorders worldwide. It is characterized by progressive memory loss and 
cognitive decline, leading to dementia. The pathogenesis of the disease is 
primarily attributed to two pathological protein structures: amyloid-beta (Aβ) 
plaques and tau protein neurofibrils. The current treatment strategies for AD 
are mainly symptomatic, highlighting the urgent need for the development of new, 
more effective therapies for the disease. The purpose of this paper is to 
provide a comprehensive and scientific review of the latest research regarding 
novel therapeutic options in the treatment of AD. In recent years, research has 
focused on more advanced and diversified strategies, including immunotherapy, 
gene therapy, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, therapies targeting mitochondrial 
function, and neurogenesis-related process modulation. One of the most promising 
treatment strategies for AD is immunotherapy. Intensive research is currently 
underway on both passive immunization, which involves the administration of 
monoclonal antibodies, and active immunization through vaccinations that 
stimulate the body to produce specific antibodies. Further research into novel 
therapeutic directions is essential, particularly concerning the role of the 
immune system in the pathogenesis of AD. Immunization appears to be a highly 
promising approach to developing effective methods for preventing AD or delaying 
the progression of this disease.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is one of the most prevalent 
neurodegenerative disorders and the most common form of dementia. Although 
current treatments examine disease progression, many have side effects and 
primarily target symptomatic relief as opposed to halting further 
neurodegeneration.
OBJECTIVE: The current study aims to determine the neuroprotective effects of 
water-soluble coenzyme Q10 (Ubisol-Q10) and an ethanolic Ashwagandha extract 
(E-ASH) on a transgenic mouse model of AD.
METHODS: A variety of immunofluorescence staining of biomarkers was conducted to 
assess mechanisms commonly implicated in the disease. Additionally, spatial and 
non-spatial memory tests evaluated cognitive functions at two timepoints 
throughout the progression of the disease.
RESULTS: A substantial reduction in microglial activation and amyloid-β (Aβ) 
plaques when treated with a combination of natural health products (NHPs), 
Ubisol-Q10 and E-ASH. Moreover, activation of autophagy was upregulated in both 
the Ubisol-Q10 and combination (Ubisol-Q10+E-ASH given as a combined "Tonic" 
solution) groups. Oxidative stress was decreased across treated groups, while 
astrocyte activation was elevated in both the E-ASH and Tonic group. The Tonic 
group expressed an elevation in the fluorescent intensity of neuronal nuclei 
(NeuN) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels. Interestingly, 
treatment with E-ASH and Ubisol-Q10 enhanced synaptic vesicle formation compared 
to controls. Pre-mortem memory tests revealed the treatments to be effective at 
preserving cognitive abilities.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on these findings, the combination of E-ASH and Ubisol-Q10 
may effectively mitigate the various mechanisms implicated in AD and ultimately 
prevent further disease progression.

Background: Obesity is clinically known to be associated with an increased risk 
and aggravated pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A high-fat diet (HFD), the 
major contributor to obesity, induces neuroinflammation and central insulin 
resistance, both of which are linked to synaptic dysfunction. Our previous 
studies demonstrated that avenanthramide-C (Avn-C), a natural oat-derived 
phenolic compound, exerts anti-inflammatory effects and alleviates synaptic 
dysfunction in conventional AD models. The present study aimed to elucidate the 
underlying mechanisms of Avn-C in obesity-accelerated AD. Methods: Two-month-old 
male 5×FAD mice were fed an HFD to induce obesity and then treated with Avn-C. 
Cognitive performance, synaptic function, and structure were assessed via 
behavioral tests, electrophysiological recordings, and Golgi-Cox staining, 
respectively. Cytokine levels were quantified using ELISA and Western blotting. 
To explore the underlying mechanism, the NOD1 agonist C12-iE-DAP was 
administered to evaluate its effect on Avn-C-mediated neuroprotection. Results: 
Avn-C reduced Aβ deposition, enhanced the expression of synapse proteins, and 
restored synaptic plasticity, thereby improving both spatial and recognition 
memory in obese 5×FAD mice. Furthermore, Avn-C reduced neuroinflammation by 
inhibiting the NOD1/RIP2/NF-κB signaling pathway. Co-treatment with C12-iE-DAP 
abolished the beneficial effects of Avn-C on neuroinflammation, Aβ pathology, 
and cognitive function. Conclusions: These results suggest that Avn-C mitigates 
obesity-exacerbated AD-like pathological features by suppressing 
NOD1/RIP2/NF-κB-mediated neuroinflammation and could be a new potential 
therapeutic strategy for obesity-associated AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia and a major 
global health challenge, characterized by progressive cognitive decline and 
neurodegeneration. Despite decades of research, there is currently no cure, and 
available treatments provide only limited symptomatic relief without halting 
disease progression. In this context, natural compounds with multi-targeted 
biological activities are being explored as potential complementary therapeutic 
strategies. Honey, a complex natural substance rich in bioactive phytochemicals, 
has emerged as a promising candidate due to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, 
anti-apoptotic, and enzyme-inhibitory properties. This review summarizes the 
molecular mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of honey in the 
context of AD, with a particular focus on its ability to modulate oxidative 
stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, apoptosis, β-amyloid 
accumulation, tau hyperphosphorylation, and neurotransmission-related enzymes. 
Notably, the botanical origin of honey significantly influences its composition 
and biological activity, as evidenced by studies on avocado, manuka, acacia, 
kelulut, chestnut, coffee, or tualang honeys. While preclinical findings are 
encouraging, especially in vitro and in invertebrate and rodent models, clinical 
validation is still lacking. Therefore, further research, including 
well-designed in vivo and human studies, is needed to clarify the therapeutic 
relevance of honey in AD. Overall, honey may represent a promising natural 
adjunct in the prevention or management of AD, but current evidence remains 
preliminary.

BACKGROUND: It has been shown previously that thienobenzo-1,2,3-triazoles 
exhibit very good selective inhibition toward butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), 
while the same derivatives converted into salts also display inhibitory activity 
against acetylcholinesterase (AChE), enzymes relevant to Alzheimer's disease 
therapy. They show even better BChE inhibition potential than neutral analogs.
METHODS: This study presents the synthesis and biological evaluation of a novel 
series of charged thienobenzo-1,2,3-triazolinium salts (1-17) as inhibitors of 
AChE and BChE. The basic skeleton of the targeted compounds was synthesized via 
a photochemical method and subsequently converted into corresponding bromide 
salts. Their structures were confirmed using NMR and HRMS analyses.
RESULTS: In vitro testing showed that all synthesized compounds exhibit moderate 
to strong BChE inhibition and, to a lesser extent, AChE inhibition. Compounds 8 
and 11 emerged as the most potent AChE inhibitors (IC50 ~ 2.6-3.2 µM), while 
compounds 1, 2, and 8 demonstrated excellent and selective BChE inhibition (IC50 
~ 0.3-0.4 µM), outperforming the reference drug galantamine. Anti-inflammatory 
evaluation revealed limited activity, with compound 17 slightly reducing 
LPS-induced TNF-α production at the highest tested concentration.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the role of the electric charge and 
substituent type in modulating biological activity and confirm the therapeutic 
potential of these molecules as dual cholinesterase inhibitors for further 
development in neurodegenerative disease treatment.

Oxidative stress, driven by excess reactive oxygen species (ROS), is a key 
factor in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). In this context, copper dysregulation can also contribute to this 
imbalance, being responsible for enhanced ROS production, so that copper 
scavenging has been investigated as a possible therapeutic strategy. This study 
investigates the behavior of two isostructural ligands, featuring an N3O donor 
set, that effectively chelate Cu(II) in aqueous solution. Interestingly, their 
resulting mono- or dinuclear copper complexes feature a coordination environment 
suitable to foster antioxidant activity. By transforming copper's oxidant 
potential into antioxidant action, these systems may reduce copper-induced 
oxidative damage. The work examines the pH-dependent metal-binding behavior of 
the ligands, the catalytic properties of the resulting complexes under 
physiological conditions, and their ability to inhibit β-amyloid peptide 
aggregation.

The increasing global health crisis of neurodegenerative diseases such as 
Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington's 
disease is worsening because of a rapidly increasing aging population. 
Disease-modifying therapies continue to face development challenges due to the 
blood-brain barrier (BBB), which prevents more than 98% of small molecules and 
all biologics from entering the central nervous system. The therapeutic 
landscape for neurodegenerative diseases has recently undergone transformation 
through advances in targeted drug delivery that include ligand-decorated 
nanoparticles, bispecific antibody shuttles, focused ultrasound-mediated BBB 
modulation, intranasal exosomes, and mRNA lipid nanoparticles. This review 
provides an analysis of the molecular pathways that cause major 
neurodegenerative diseases, discusses the physiological and physicochemical 
barriers to drug delivery to the brain, and reviews the most recent drug 
targeting strategies including receptor-mediated transcytosis, cell-based 
"Trojan horse" approaches, gene-editing vectors, and spatiotemporally controlled 
physical methods. The review also critically evaluates the limitations such as 
immunogenicity, scalability, and clinical translation challenges, proposing 
potential solutions to enhance therapeutic efficacy. The recent clinical trials 
are assessed in detail, and current and future trends are discussed, including 
artificial intelligence (AI)-based carrier engineering, combination therapy, and 
precision neuro-nanomedicine. The successful translation of these innovations 
into effective treatments for patients with neurodegenerative diseases will 
require essential interdisciplinary collaboration between neuroscientists, 
pharmaceutics experts, clinicians, and regulators.

Background/Objectives: Solanezumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody designed 
to bind soluble amyloid-beta (Aβ) and facilitate its clearance from the brain, 
aiming to slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methods: A 
systematic search was applied in four medical databases through October 2024 to 
identify phase 2 or 3 randomized controlled trials evaluating solanezumab in 
patients aged ≥50 years with mild AD or in preclinical stages. The primary 
outcomes were changes in cognitive and functional scales, including ADAS-cog14, 
MMSE, ADCS-ADL, and CDR-SB. Data were pooled using a random-effects model, and 
certainty of evidence was assessed using GRADE. Results: Seven trials involving 
4181 participants were included. Solanezumab did not significantly reduce 
cognitive decline based on ADAS-cog14 (MD = -0.75; 95% CI: -2.65 to 1.15; very 
low certainty) or improve functional scores on ADCS-ADL (MD = 0.85; 95% CI: 
-1.86 to 3.56; very low certainty) and CDR-SB (MD = -0.15; 95% CI: -0.89 to 
0.60; very low certainty). A modest but statistically significant improvement 
was observed in MMSE scores (MD = 0.59; 95% CI: 0.33 to 0.86; moderate 
certainty). Conclusions: While solanezumab may offer slight benefits in general 
cognitive performance, its overall impact on clinically meaningful outcomes 
remains limited. The results do not support its use as a disease-modifying 
therapy for Alzheimer's disease in either preclinical or symptomatic stages.

Background and Objectives: Over the past few years, there has been a significant 
shift in focus from developing better diagnostic tools to detecting Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) earlier and initiating treatment interventions. This review will 
explore four main objectives: (a) the role of biomarkers in enhancing the 
diagnostic accuracy of AD, highlighting the major strides that have been made in 
recent years; (b) the role of neuropsychological testing in identifying 
biomarkers of AD, including the relationship between cognitive performance and 
neuroimaging biomarkers; (c) the amyloid hypothesis and possible molecular 
mechanisms of AD; and (d) the innovative AD therapeutics and the challenges and 
limitations of AD research. Materials and Methods: We have searched PubMed and 
Scopus databases for peer-reviewed research articles published in English 
(preclinical and clinical studies as well as relevant reviews and meta-analyses) 
investigating the molecular mechanisms, biomarkers, and treatments of AD. 
Results: Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) discovered 37 loci associated 
with AD risk. Core 1 biomarkers (α-amyloid Aβ42, phosphorylated tau, and amyloid 
PET) detect early AD phases, identifying both symptomatic and asymptomatic 
individuals, while core 2 biomarkers inform the short-term progression risk in 
individuals without symptoms. The recurrent failures of Aβ-targeted clinical 
studies undermine the amyloid cascade hypothesis and the objectives of AD 
medication development. The molecular mechanisms of AD include the accumulation 
of amyloid plaques and tau protein, vascular dysfunction, neuroinflammation, 
oxidative stress, and lipid metabolism dysregulation. Significant advancements 
in drug delivery technologies, such as focused Low-Ultrasound Stem, T cells, 
exosomes, nanoparticles, transferin, nicotinic and acetylcholine receptors, and 
glutathione transporters, are aimed at overcoming the BBB to enhance treatment 
efficacy for AD. Aducanumab and Lecanemab are IgG1 monoclonal antibodies that 
retard the progression of AD. BACE inhibitors have been explored as a 
therapeutic strategy for AD. Gene therapies targeting APOE using the CRISPR/Cas9 
genome-editing system are another therapeutic avenue. Conclusions: Classic 
neurodegenerative biomarkers have emerged as powerful tools for enhancing the 
diagnostic accuracy of AD. Despite the supporting evidence, the amyloid 
hypothesis has several unresolved issues. Novel monoclonal antibodies may halt 
the AD course. Advances in delivery systems across the BBB are promising for the 
efficacy of AD treatments.

Background and Objectives: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex 
neurodegenerative disorder marked by cholinergic deficits, oxidative stress, 
amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregation, and tau hyperphosphorylation. Caffeic acid (CA), a 
naturally occurring hydroxycinnamic acid, has emerged as a promising 
neuroprotective candidate due to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and 
enzyme-inhibitory properties. This review systematically evaluates recent in 
vitro and in vivo evidence regarding the therapeutic potential of CA in AD 
models and examines the impact of delivery systems and derivatives on its 
efficacy and bioavailability. Materials and Methods: A systematic literature 
search was conducted in the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases, 
adhering to the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Studies published between January 2021 
and April 2025 were included in this review. Eligible studies investigated the 
effects of CA or CA-enriched extracts on AD-relevant mechanisms using in vitro, 
in vivo, and in silico models. After screening 101 articles, 44 met the 
inclusion criteria and were included in the final qualitative synthesis of the 
study. Results: In vitro studies have confirmed that CA modulates cholinergic 
activity by inhibiting AChE and BChE and exerting antioxidant and 
anti-amyloidogenic effects. In vivo studies using pharmacological, genetic, and 
metabolic AD models have demonstrated improvements in cognitive function, 
reduction in oxidative stress, inflammation, and Aβ and tau pathologies 
following CA administration. Advanced delivery platforms, such as solid lipid 
nanoparticles, transferrin-functionalized liposomes, and carbon dot systems, 
have significantly enhanced CA's brain bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy. 
CA derivatives, including caffeic acid phenethyl ester and nitro-substituted 
analogs, exhibit improved pharmacokinetic and neuroprotective profiles. 
Conclusions: This review provides evidence supporting the use of CA as a 
promising multitarget agent against AD pathology. Its therapeutic potential is 
further enhanced by nanotechnology-based delivery systems and chemical 
modifications that overcome the limitations of bioavailability. Continued 
preclinical evaluation and translational studies are warranted to support its 
clinical development as an AD intervention.

Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) pose a major challenge to global healthcare 
systems owing to their devastating effects and limited treatment options. These 
disorders are characterized by progressive loss of neuronal structure and 
function, resulting in cognitive and motor impairments. Current therapies 
primarily focus on symptom management rather than on targeting the underlying 
causes. However, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat 
(CRISPR) technology offers a promising alternative by enabling precise genetic 
modifications that could halt or even reverse ND progression. CRISPR-Cas9, the 
most widely used CRISPR system, acts as a molecular scissor targeting specific 
DNA sequences for editing. By designing guide RNAs (gRNAs) to match sequences in 
genes associated with NDs, researchers can leverage CRISPR to knockout harmful 
genes, correct mutations, or insert protective genes. This review explores the 
potential of CRISPR-based therapies in comparison with traditional treatments 
for NDs. As research advances, CRISPR has the potential to revolutionize ND 
treatment by addressing its genetic underpinnings. Ongoing clinical trials and 
preclinical studies continue to expand our understanding and application of this 
powerful tool to fight debilitating conditions.

BACKGROUND: Physical exercise has been linked to improvements in motor and 
cognitive functions as well as to the modulation of neurotrophic and 
inflammatory factors, particularly in older adults. This aim of this study was 
to investigate the effects of a 12-week multimodal exercise program on cognitive 
function, motor performance, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotrophic 
factor (BDNF) and cytokines in elderly individuals with Alzheimer's disease 
(AD).
METHODS: A non-randomized controlled trial design was employed, involving 23 
participants aged 62 to 85 years diagnosed with mild to moderate AD. The 
intervention group (n = 7) attended 60-minute sessions three times per week, 
incorporating aerobic, strength, flexibility, and motor coordination exercises, 
while the control group (n = 8) maintained usual activities.
METHODS: A non-randomized controlled trial design was used, involving 23 
participants aged 62 to 85 years. Of these, 15 had a clinical diagnosis of mild 
to moderate AD and were allocated to either an intervention group (n = 7) or and 
AD control group (n = 8). The remaining eight participants were cognitively 
healthy and formed a control group matched for age and sex, used exclusively for 
baseline comparisons. The intervention group participated in 60-minute sessions 
three times per week, including aerobic, strength, flexibility, and motor 
coordination exercises. The AD control group (n = 8) maintained their usual 
daily routines.
RESULTS: Compared to baseline, the intervention group demonstrated significant 
improvements in executive and attentional functions, as measured by the Frontal 
Assessment Battery (FAB) and Clock Drawing Test (CDT); mobility, balance, gait 
speed, and lower limb strength also improved (p < 0.05). Additionally, plasma 
BDNF levels increased significantly, and interleukin-2 (IL-2) levels decreased.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the multimodal exercise program resulted in 
cognitive and motor benefits and positively modulated biomarkers related to 
neuroplasticity and inflammation, supporting its potential as a complementary 
intervention in elderly individuals with AD.

Lactate is not only the end product of glycolysis but also plays a key role in 
epigenetic regulation. Recently, lactate-derived histone lactylation has been 
identified as a novel epigenetic modification that can directly influence gene 
transcription. Histone lactylation has been associated with various pathological 
conditions and shows significant therapeutic potential. However, studies on 
histone lactylation in central nervous system diseases are still quite limited. 
In this review, we summarize the latest research progress on histone 
lactylation, detailing the specific mechanisms and sites of histone lactylation, 
including lactylation and delactylation. We also discuss the role of histone 
lactylation in Alzheimer's disease (glycolysis/H4K12la/PKM2 feedback loop), 
depression (neuronal excitation), neuroinflammation 
(anti-inflammatory/pro-inflammatory balance of microglia), aging, stroke 
(infarct volume), and glioblastoma (activation of oncogenes), pointing out the 
research directions for the future. This may provide new ideas for the diagnosis 
and treatment of neurological diseases.

Apolipoprotein A (ApoA) proteins, ApoA-I, ApoA-II, ApoA-IV, and ApoA-V, play 
critical roles in lipid metabolism, neuroinflammation, and blood-brain barrier 
integrity, making them pivotal in neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), stroke, Parkinson's disease (PD), and multiple sclerosis (MS). 
This review synthesizes current evidence on their structural and functional 
contributions to neuroprotection, highlighting their dual roles as biomarkers 
and therapeutic targets. ApoA-I, the most extensively studied, exhibits 
anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and amyloid-clearing properties, with reduced 
levels associated with AD progression and cognitive decline. ApoA-II modulates 
HDL metabolism and stroke risk, while ApoA-IV influences neuroinflammation and 
amyloid processing. ApoA-V, although less explored, is implicated in stroke 
susceptibility through its regulation of triglycerides. Genetic polymorphisms 
(e.g., APOA1 rs670, APOA5 rs662799) further complicate disease risk, showing 
population-specific associations with stroke and neurodegeneration. Therapeutic 
strategies targeting ApoA proteins, including reconstituted HDL, mimetic 
peptides, and gene-based approaches, show promise in preclinical models but face 
translational challenges in human trials. Clinical trials, such as those with 
CSL112, highlight the need for neuro-specific optimization. Further research 
should prioritize human-relevant models, advanced neuroimaging techniques, and 
functional assays to elucidate ApoA mechanisms inside the central nervous 
system. The integration of genetic, lipidomic, and clinical data offers 
potential for enhancing precision medicine in neurological illnesses by 
facilitating the generation of ApoA-targeted treatments and bridging current 
deficiencies in disease comprehension and therapy.

Cathepsins, a family of lysosomal proteases, play critical roles in maintaining 
cellular homeostasis through protein degradation and modulation of immune 
responses. In the central nervous system (CNS), their functions extend beyond 
classical proteolysis, influencing neuroinflammation, synaptic remodeling, and 
neurodegeneration. Emerging evidence underscores the crucial role of microglial 
cathepsins in the pathophysiology of several neurological disorders. This review 
synthesizes current knowledge on the involvement of cathepsins in a spectrum of 
CNS diseases, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple 
sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, epilepsy, Huntington's disease, and 
ischemic stroke. We highlight how specific cathepsins contribute to disease 
progression by modulating key pathological processes such as α-synuclein and 
amyloid-β clearance, tau degradation, lysosomal dysfunction, neuroinflammation, 
and demyelination. Notably, several cathepsins demonstrate both neuroprotective 
and pathogenic roles depending on disease context and expression levels. 
Additionally, the balance between cathepsins and their endogenous inhibitors, 
such as cystatins, emerges as a critical factor in CNS pathology. While 
cathepsins represent promising biomarkers and therapeutic targets, significant 
gaps remain in our understanding of their mechanistic roles across diseases. 
Future studies focusing on their regulation, substrate specificity, and 
interplay with genetic and epigenetic factors may yield novel strategies for 
early diagnosis and disease-modifying treatments in neurology.

The three pathological hallmarks of multiple sclerosis (MS) are inflammation, 
demyelination, and progressive neurodegeneration. None of the approved 
disease-modifying therapies for MS counters all three pathologies, and, more 
specifically, none is approved for neuroprotection. Axonal loss is the most 
significant contributor to chronic and irreversible disability in MS. A 
tantalizing molecular target has emerged to uniquely counter all three MS 
pathologies: tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2). Agonism or activation of 
TNFR2 has been shown in MS models to induce immunosuppression, oligodendrocyte 
precursor differentiation, and neuroprotection. Further, in basic science 
studies stemming from the past 15 years, TNFR2 agonism is known to be a strong 
inducer of T-regulatory cells (Tregs). Treg cells, and especially those 
expressing TNFR2, are known to confer the strongest suppression per cell type. 
TNFR2 is even more attractive as a therapeutic target because of its restricted 
expression by only a handful of CNS and immune cell subsets, thereby minimizing 
the likelihood of systemic and other adverse effects. Recent antibody design 
work suggests many of the hurdles of Treg agonism may have been overcome. This 
review covers the current treatment landscape for MS, the basic science of 
TNFR2, the rationale for and evidence behind TNFR2 agonism to treat multiple 
sclerosis, the design of potent TNFR2 agonist antibodies, and the treatment 
applications for other neurological, autoimmune, or inflammatory diseases.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disease of the 
central nervous system, responsible for 60-80% of dementia. Its pathogenesis is 
mainly based on the accumulation of beta-amyloid and tau proteins. Current 
pharmacological treatment includes acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, NMDA 
receptor antagonists, and monoclonal antibodies. However, their effect is 
limited by the blood-brain barrier (BBB). A new and promising way for different 
drugs to cross the BBB is the use of nanoparticles such as liposomes, micelles, 
solid lipid nanocarriers, polymeric nanoparticles, dendrimers, nanoemulsions, 
and inorganic nanoparticles as their carriers. Additionally, some nanoparticles 
present anti-inflammatory or neuroprotective effects. Some of them can also be 
used to treat cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) by aiming at amyloid deposits in 
brain arterioles. All the properties of nanoparticles listed and discussed in 
the article allow us to hope that there will be more effective treatment in the 
future, which is extremely important as the number of patients with AD is still 
growing.

The genera Allium (Liliaceae) and Anchusa (Boraginaceae) are flowering plant 
genera with a rich diversity, also including the Allium kharputense Freyn & 
Sint. and Anchusa azurea Mill. var. azurea species. The antioxidant, 
anti-Alzheimer's disease (AD), antidiabetic, and antiglaucoma effects of the 
Allium kharputense Freyn & Sint. and Anchusa azurea Mill. var. azurea species, 
which are commonly eaten foods in the Southeast of Türkiye in the treatment of 
several diseases, were studied. To interpret the antioxidant capacities of 
ethanol extract of two plant species, aerial parts were analyzed by ABTS and 
DPPH assays. The IC50 values of A. kharputense and A. azurea ethanol and water 
extracts for ABTS•+ activities were recorded in the range of 30.93 to 33.94 
µg/mL and 33.45 to 33.78 µg/mL, respectively. Also, DPPH• activities were 
measured at 30.78 to 36.87 µg/mL and 31.67 to 32.45 µg/mL, respectively. The 
best of the IC50 values was measured in the ethanol extract of A. kharputense as 
30.78 µg/mL for DPPH scavenging activity. The total phenolic and flavonoid 
quantities in A. kharputense and A. azurea plants were measured. The highest 
phenolic and flavonoid contents of A. kharputense and A. azurea species were 
recorded in amounts of 445.52 and 327.35 mg GAE/g in ethanol extracts, 
respectively, and 332.88 and 234.03 mg QE/g in ethanol extracts, respectively. 
The effects of A. kharputense and A. azurea on diabetes, AD, and glaucoma were 
studied on the target enzymes of diseases. The most efficient IC50 values were 
recorded at 10.72 μg/mL against α-glycosidase, 35.01 μg/mL against AChE, 38.05 
μg/mL against BChE, 9.21 μg/mL towards hCA I, and 81.02 μg/mL towards hCA II 
isoenzymes. The kinds and amounts of phenolic compounds in A. kharputense and A. 
azurea were determined using LC-MS/MS against 53 standards. A. kharputense and 
A. azurea plants have prospective use in enhancing glaucoma, diabetes, AD, 
Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, and cancerous disorders.

Alzheimer's disease is the most widespread neurodegenerative disease in the 
world. Galantamine hydrobromide (GH) is one of the drugs used to treat mild to 
moderate dementia of the Alzheimer type. Due to the fact that the specificity of 
the disease requires maximally facilitated intake, orodispersible films present 
such an opportunity. In the present study orodispersible films based on 
poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline) as well as partially hydrolyzed 
poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline) were prepared and studied as delivery systems for GH. 
Two samples of partially hydrolyzed PEtOx were synthesized-one of relatively low 
degree of hydrolysis and another one of relatively high degree of hydrolysis, 
and studied by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). Cytotoxicity assay was 
performed that validated the low hydrolyzed derivative as biocompatible polymer 
that maintained desirable physicochemical characteristics without compromising 
the safety, thereby it was selected for further research. The films were 
prepared by the solution casting method and characterized by different methods. 
FTIR was used to determine the potential interactions between the galantamine 
molecule and the film components. Based on the Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) 
conducted, it was concluded that all films were sufficiently thermally stable, 
as the component decomposition stage (after initial solvent removal) began above 
180 °C. The polymer films were further characterized with the determination of 
Shore hardness and the results showed that the films containing glycerol as a 
plasticizer exhibited higher hardness compared to those with PEG as a 
plasticizer. The disintegration time of the films was determined visually using 
Petri dishes and it was found that the films disintegrated within the range of 
0.52 to 1.58 min, fully meeting the pharmacopoeial requirements. GH release 
profiles in PBS at 37 °C were obtained, and it was found that by the second 
minute, 80-90% of the drug were released from the different films, and the 
release followed an anomalous diffusion mechanism (Case II).

Exploring the Impact of Bioactive Compounds Found in Extra Virgin Olive Oil on 
NRF2 Modulation in Alzheimer's Disease.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder marked by 
amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, blood-brain barrier 
dysfunction, oxidative stress (OS), and neuroinflammation. Current treatments 
provide symptomatic relief, but do not halt the disease's progression. OS plays 
a crucial role in AD pathogenesis by promoting Aβ accumulation. Nuclear factor 
erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) is a key regulator of the antioxidant 
response, influencing genes involved in OS mitigation, mitochondrial function, 
and inflammation. Dysregulation of NRF2 is implicated in AD, making it a 
promising therapeutic target. Emerging evidence suggests that adherence to a 
Mediterranean diet (MD), which is particularly rich in polyphenols from extra 
virgin olive oil (EVOO), is associated with improved cognitive function and a 
reduced risk of mild cognitive impairment. Polyphenols can activate NRF2, 
enhancing endogenous antioxidant defenses. This study employs a computational 
approach to explore the potential of bioactive compounds in EVOO to modulate 
NRF2-related pathways in AD. We analyzed transcriptomic data from AD and 
EVOO-treated samples to identify NRF2-associated genes, and used chemical 
structure-based analysis to compare EVOO's bioactive compounds with known NRF2 
activators. Enrichment analysis was performed to identify common biological 
functions between NRF2-, EVOO-, and AD-related pathways. Our findings highlight 
important factors and biological functions that provide new insight into the 
molecular mechanisms through which EVOO consumption might influence cellular 
pathways associated with AD via modulation of the NRF2 pathway. The presented 
approach provides a different perspective in the discovery of compounds that may 
contribute to neuroprotective mechanisms in the context of AD.

A series of rivastigmine hybrids, incorporating rivastigmine fragments (RIV) and 
a set of different antioxidant scaffolds, were designed, synthesized, and 
evaluated as multifunctional agents for the potential therapy of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). In vitro bioactivity assays indicated that some compounds have 
very good antioxidant (radical-scavenging) activity. The compounds also 
displayed good inhibitory activity against cholinesterases, though the 
bigger-sized hybrids showed higher inhibitory ability for butyrylcholinesterase 
(BChE) than for acetylcholinesterase (AChE), due to the larger active site 
cavity of BChE. All the hybrids exhibited an inhibition capacity for 
self-induced amyloid-β (Aβ1-42) aggregation. Furthermore, cell assays 
demonstrated that some compounds showed capacity for rescuing neuroblastoma 
cells from toxicity induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Among these RIV 
hybrids, the best in vitro multifunctional capacity was found for the caffeic 
acid derivatives enclosing catechol moieties (4AY5, 4AY6), though the Trolox 
derivatives (4AY2, 4BY2) presented the best cell neuroprotective activity 
against oxidative damage. Molecular-docking studies provided structural insights 
into the binding modes of RIV-based hybrids to the cholinesterases, revealing 
key interaction patterns despite some lack of correlation with inhibitory 
potency. Overall, the balanced multifunctional profiles of these hybrids render 
them potentially promising candidates for treating AD, thus deserving further 
investigation.

Apelin-13, a neuropeptide, has been recognized for its neuroprotective 
properties. Our previous study found apelin-13 improves cognitive function in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) rats by inhibiting neuroinflammation through 
upregulation of BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway. However, the precise mechanism by 
which apelin-13 modulates BDNF remains unclear. Thus, this study aimed to 
unravel the specific regulatory mechanism by which apelin-13 regulates BDNF. 
Bilaterally intracerebroventricular injection with Aβ25-35 was used to establish 
an in vivo model of AD. For the generation of METTL3 KO rats, the Crispr/Cas9 
method was applied. PC12 cells were treated with Aβ25-35 to establish an in 
vitro model of AD. The cognitive function of the rats was evaluated with the 
Morris water maze and the novel object recognition test. Hippocampal damage and 
neuron loss were detected through H&E and immunofluorescent staining. METTL3, 
BDNF, TrkB, and p-TrkB were examined by Western blotting. Inflammation-related 
cytokines, IBA1, GFAP, IL-1β, and TNF-α were detected by Western blotting, 
immunofluorescent staining, ELISA, and qRT-PCR. m6A modification level was 
evaluated through MeRIP. A flow cytometer was applied to evaluate cell 
apoptosis. Cell proliferation was examined using MTT. m6A methylation inhibitor 
DAA reverses the improvement effect of apelin-13 on cognitive function, 
hippocampal nerve damage, neuron loss, and neuroinflammation in Aβ25-35-treated 
rats. Further results showed that apelin-13 upregulated METTL3, BDNF-AS m6A 
methylation, inhibited BDNF-AS expression, and subsequently upregulated 
BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway and reduced neuroinflammation in in vivo and in 
vitro AD models in a dose-dependent manner. Knockdown of METTL3 abolished 
apelin-13's improvement effect in AD rats. Apelin-13-mediated upregulation of 
METTL3 enhances neuroinflammation inhibition and BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway via 
m6A-dependent downregulation of lncRNA BDNF-AS, thus ameliorating AD. Our study 
offers novel insights into the pathogenesis of AD and identifies potential drug 
targets for its treatment.

The complement system is a vital component of innate immunity. Besides its roles 
in pathogen defense, its significance in neurodevelopment, neurodegeneration, 
and cancer progression is beginning to be recognized. We performed a 
comprehensive literature review to summarize the involvement and dysregulation 
of the complement system in three main CNS-associated conditions: Alzheimer's 
disease, schizophrenia, and glioma. In Alzheimer's disease, activation of the 
complement system contributes to neuroinflammation, synaptic loss, and neuronal 
death. In glioblastoma, complement promotes tumor growth, immune evasion, and 
therapy resistance. In schizophrenia, genetic variations in complement 
components, particularly C4A, are associated with synaptic pruning abnormalities 
and disease susceptibility. We conclude that the complement system has a dual 
role of protector and pathogenic mediator in the central nervous system. While 
it is critical in neurodegenerative, oncological, and psychiatric disorders, its 
role is not understood well enough. For therapeutic purposes, targeting the 
complement system may open new frontiers for therapeutic interventions without 
disrupting important physiological processes. More research is needed to 
elucidate the exact roles of the complement and help translate these findings 
into clinical settings.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, affecting over 50 
million people globally. Since 1906, efforts to understand this 
neurodegenerative disease and to develop effective treatments have continued to 
this day. Recognizing docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) as a safe, inexpensive 
and vital nutrient for brain health and cognitive protection due to its key role 
in brain development and function, this study explores novel, sustainable 
non-fish sources as potential dietary supplements to prevent or mitigate AD, 
within a blue biotechnology framework. Forty 5×FAD male mice, five weeks old, 
were allocated to five body weight-matched dietary groups (n = 8) and fed 
isocaloric diets based on AIN-93M standard chow for 6 months. Each diet, except 
the control feed (non-supplemented group), enclosed a modified lipid fraction 
supplemented with 2% of the following: (1) linseed oil (LSO, rich in 
alpha-linolenic acid (ALA,18:3n-3)); (2) cod liver oil (fish oil, FO, rich in 
both DHA and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n-3)); (3) Schizochytrium sp. 
microalga oil (Schizo) with 40% of DHA; and (4) commercial DHASCO oil (DHASCO) 
with 70% of DHA. The different diets did not affect (p > 0.05) growth 
performance criteria (e.g., final body weight, daily feed intake, and body 
weight gain) suggesting no effect on the overall caloric balance or mice growth, 
but n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated-fatty acid (n-3 LCPUFA) supplementation 
significantly reduced total cholesterol (p < 0.001) and total lipids (p < 
0.001). No systemic inflammation was detected in 5×FAD mice. In parallel, a 
beneficial modulation of lipid metabolism by DHA-enriched diets was observed, 
with polyunsaturated fatty acid incorporation, particularly DHA, across key 
metabolic tissues, such as the liver (p < 0.001) and the brain (p < 0.001). No 
behavioural variations were detected using an open-field test after 6 months of 
diet (p > 0.05). While mice fed a standard diet or LSO diet showed cognitive 
deficit, the incorporation of FO, Schizo or DHASCO oils into dietary routine 
showed promising protective effects on the working memory (p < 0.05) and the 
last two diets also on the recognition memory (p < 0.05) Increased neuronal 
count (p < 0.05), reflecting neuronal survival, was clearly observed with the 
fish oil diet. In turn, the number of TAU-positive cells (p < 0.05) was reduced 
in the Schizo diet, while β-amyloid deposition (p < 0.01) and the 
neuroinflammatory marker, IBA1 (p < 0.05), were decreased across all 
DHA-enriched diets. These promising findings open new avenues for further 
studies focused on the protective effects of DHA derived from sustainable and 
underexploited Schizochytrium sp. microalga in the prevention of AD.

In this paper, we aimed to evaluate whether simple, low molecular mass 
benzoquinone derivatives, featuring different substituents in para- and 
meta-position relative to the tert-butyl group, possess biological activities 
against major targets associated with Alzheimer's disease. The 1,4-benzoquinone 
derivatives studied herein inhibited both cholinesterases in the micromolar 
concentration range, generally showing a preference for butyrylcholinesterase 
over acetylcholinesterase; formed complexes with biometal ions Fe2+, Cu2+ and 
Zn2+; and displayed a certain BACE1 inhibition. Moreover, the tested compounds 
displayed certain antioxidant activity via either electron transfer or hydrogen 
atom transfer mechanisms. The antioxidant capacity of the unsubstituted 
tert-butyl-1,4-benzoquinone (compound 1) was three times lower than that of the 
standard antioxidant BHT, while 2,6-disubstituted derivatives (compounds 15 and 
7) exhibited peroxyl radical scavenging activity comparable to that of Trolox. 
Taken together with in silico-predicted low toxicity, good intestinal absorption 
and favorable oral bioavailability, the presented 1,4-benzoquinone derivatives 
are promising scaffolds for the design of more complex molecules with enhanced 
cholinesterase and BACE1 inhibitory activity. Furthermore, they could serve as 
functional substituents in other structural scaffolds to combine and enhance 
their biological activities.

BACKGROUND: Inflammasomes regulate the activation of caspases resulting in 
inflammation; inflammasome activation is dysregulated in Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) and plays a role in the pathogenesis of this condition. Glibenclamide, an 
anti-inflammatory drug, could be an interesting way to down-modulate 
neuroinflammation.
METHODS: In this pilot study we verified with ex vivo experiments whether a 
glibenclamide-loaded nanovector (GNV) could reduce the NLRP3-inflammasome 
cascade in cells of AD patients. Monocytes isolated from healthy controls (HC) 
and AD patients were cultured in medium, alone or stimulated with LPS + 
nigericin in presence/absence of GNV. ASC-speck positive cells and 
inflammasome-related genes, proteins, and miRNAs expressions were measured. The 
polymorphisms of ApoE (Apolipoprotein E), specifically rs7412 and rs429358, as 
well as those of NLRP3, namely rs35829419, rs10733113, and rs4925663, were also 
investigated.
RESULTS: Results showed that ASC-speck+ cells and Caspase-1, IL-1β, and IL-18 
production was significantly reduced (p < 0.005 in all cases) by GNV in LPS + 
nigericin-stimulated cells of both AD and HC. Notably, the NLRP3 rs10733113 AG 
genotype was associated with excessive inflammasome-related gene and protein 
expression. GNV significantly down-regulates inflammasome activation in primary 
monocytes, at least at protein levels, and its efficacy seems to partially 
depend on the presence of the NLRP3 rs10733113 genotype.
CONCLUSIONS: All together, these results showed that GNV is able to dampen 
inflammation and NLRP-3 inflammasome activation in an ex vivo monocyte model, 
suggesting a possible role for GNV in controlling AD-associated 
neuroinflammation.

A process evaluation was embedded in the multinational Music Interventions for 
Dementia and Depression in ELderly care (MIDDEL) trial to better understand 
barriers and facilitators for implementing music-based interventions (MBIs). 
Stakeholders from 66 care home units across 5 countries completed a survey at 
baseline (n = 229) and after a six-month intervention period (n = 101), 
comparing expectations and experiences between countries, intervention groups, 
and stakeholders. MBIs were evaluated and found to be relevant and feasible. 
Barriers include a lack of support, turnover among employees, and a lack of 
motivation. Facilitators include individual stakeholders who proactively 
facilitate and stimulate implementation, as well as the presence of stable, 
well-functioning teams, clear communication, and adhering to project plans. 
Fewer barriers than expected related to care staff workload and the time needed 
for implementing new MBIs in care homes. MBIs can be beneficial for people with 
dementia, yet implementation in care homes can be challenging due to contextual 
factors. Involving stakeholders in key positions is essential: care home 
managers are pivotal for policy-making and the sustainable adoption of MBIs, 
whereas the commitment and the involvement of care staff are needed for 
day-to-day implementation. Insight into these barriers to and facilitators of 
implementation can contribute to the interpretation of trial results.

The Evidence That Brain Cancers Could Be Effectively Treated with In-Home 
Radiofrequency Waves.

There is currently no effective therapeutic capable of arresting or inducing 
regression of primary or metastatic brain cancers. This article presents both 
pre-clinical and clinical studies supportive that a new bioengineered technology 
could induce regression and/or elimination of primary and metastatic brain 
cancers through three disease-modifying mechanisms. Transcranial Radiofrequency 
Wave Treatment (TRFT) is non-thermal, non-invasive and self-administered in-home 
to safely provide radiofrequency waves to the entire human brain. Since TRFT has 
already been shown to stop and reverse the cognitive decline of Alzheimer's 
Disease in small studies, evidence is provided that three key mechanisms of TRFT 
action, alone or in synergy, could effectively treat brain cancers: (1) 
enhancement of brain meningeal lymph flow to increase immune trafficking between 
the brain cancer and cervical lymph nodes, resulting in a robust immune attack 
on the brain cancer; (2) rebalancing of the immune system's cytokines within the 
brain or brain cancer environment to decrease inflammation therein and thus make 
for an inhospitable environment for brain cancer growth; (3) direct 
anti-proliferation/antigrowth affects within the brain tumor microenvironment. 
Importantly, these mechanisms of TRFT action could be effective against both 
visualized brain tumors and those that are yet too small to be identified 
through brain imaging. The existing animal and human clinical evidence presented 
in this perspective article justifies TRFT to be clinically tested immediately 
against both primary and metastatic brain cancers as monotherapy or possibly in 
combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors.

Introduction: It has been recently demonstrated that some cerebral microbleeds 
(CMBs) are connected to cerebral veins in patients with cerebral small vessel 
disease (CSVD) including cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). We sought to 
demonstrate the presence of CMB at 3 Tesla using susceptibility-weighted imaging 
and speculated that it was more prevalent in persons with Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), another amyloid-related disease, than in healthy ageing controls. Material 
and Methods: We included persons from the publicly available OASIS3-database. 
Persons were included if they had a structural MRI including a 
susceptibility-weighted sequence (SWI) and relevant clinical data. Two raters 
assessed the presence and location of CMBs and CMBs with a venous connection 
(CMBven). Results: A total of 571 persons (AD, n = 140, healthy controls, n = 
431) were included. In total, 367 CMBs were detected, encompassing 26/571 
persons (4.5%) who had a total of 40/367 (10.9%) CMBs with a CMBven, though 
there was no difference between persons with AD and healthy controls (AD 6.6%, 
healthy controls 7.4%, p = 0.773). Persons with CMBven had a higher total CMB 
load, were more likely female, displayed an APOE ε2/2 genotype and had 
antithrombotic treatment more often. Logistic regression revealed a higher 
number of CMB (OR (95% CI) = 1.351 (1.161-1.688), p < 0.0014) and a lower MoCA 
score (OR (95% CI) = 0.862 (0.762-0.982), p = 0.018), indicating a statistically 
significant association with the presence of CMBven. Discussion: CMBven are not 
an uncommon finding in persons with AD and healthy ageing controls. Our results 
highlight the potential venous contribution to CSVD. Histopathological studies 
will be needed to assess these further.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Neuromodulation is under investigation as a possibly 
effective add-on therapy in Alzheimer's disease (AD). While transcranial pulse 
stimulation (TPS) has shown positive short-term effects, long-term effects have 
not yet been fully explored. This study aims to evaluate the long-term 
feasibility, safety, and potential cognitive benefits of TPS over one year in 
patients with Alzheimer's disease, focusing on domains such as memory, speech, 
orientation, visuo-construction, and depressive symptoms.
METHODS: We analyzed preliminary data from the first ten out of thirty-five 
patients enrolled in a prospective TPS study who completed one year of follow-up 
and were included in a dedicated long-term database. The protocol consisted of 
six initial TPS sessions over two weeks, followed by monthly booster sessions 
delivering 6000 pulses each for twelve months. Patients underwent regular 
neuropsychological assessments using the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale 
(ADAS), Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment 
(MoCA), and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II). All adverse events (AEs) were 
documented and monitored throughout the study.
RESULTS: Adverse events occurred in less than 1% of stimulation sessions and 
mainly included mild focal pain or transient unpleasant sensations, as well as 
some systemic behavioral or vigilance changes, particularly in patients with 
underlying medical conditions, with some potentially related to the device's 
stimulation as adverse device reactions (ADRs). Cognitive test results showed 
significant improvement after the initial stimulation cycle (ADAS total improved 
significantly after the first stimulation cycle (M_pre = 28.44, M_post = 18.56; 
p = 0.001, d = 0.80, 95% CI (0.36, 1.25)), with stable scores across all domains 
over one year. Improvements were most notable in memory, speech, and mood.
CONCLUSIONS: TPS appears to be a generally safe and feasible add-on treatment 
for AD, although careful patient selection and monitoring are advised. While a 
considerable number of participants were lost to follow-up for various reasons, 
adverse events and lack of treatment effect were unlikely primary causes. A 
multifocal stimulation approach (F-TOP2) is proposed to enhance effects across 
more cognitive domains.

Gender Differences in the Effects of Exercise Interventions on Alzheimer's 
Disease.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder primarily 
characterized by memory loss, cognitive decline, and structural brain atrophy. 
Substantial sex differences have been observed in its incidence, clinical 
trajectory, and response to treatment. Women are disproportionately affected, 
exhibiting faster progression and more severe cognitive impairment. Exercise has 
emerged as a promising non-pharmacological intervention to mitigate AD-related 
decline, yet growing evidence reveals that its benefits vary by sex. This review 
synthesizes current findings from human and animal studies, focusing on how 
exercise impacts AD differently in males and females. In women, exercise is more 
strongly associated with improvements in cognitive function, neurotrophic 
support, and emotional regulation. In men, benefits tend to involve structural 
preservation and oxidative adaptations. Underlying mechanisms include 
differential hormonal profiles, inflammatory responses, and neuroplastic 
signaling pathways. These findings underscore the need to consider sex as a 
biological variable in AD research. Developing sex-specific exercise strategies 
may enhance therapeutic outcomes and support more individualized approaches in 
AD prevention and care.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder 
lacking a definitive cure, spurring global efforts to develop effective 
therapeutic agents. Patent data can provide critical insights into research 
investments, innovation trends, and market dynamics.
OBJECTIVE: This study offers a comprehensive ten-year overview (2014-2023) of 
granted AD drug patents, focusing on patent families (A 'patent family' refers 
to a set of patents or patent applications in different jurisdictions claiming 
priority to the same original invention. In contrast, a 'patent' typically 
denotes a single jurisdiction-specific grant. When we aggregate data by 
families, we seek to avoid double-counting the same invention filed in multiple 
regions and to measure an invention's overall global protection strategy.) to 
consolidate international filings for the same invention. By highlighting top 
assignees, citation impact, and molecular targets, we aim to clarify current R&D 
directions and identify emerging opportunities in AD drug development.
METHODS: We extracted 2,088 AD drug patent families from the IncoPat database 
using International Patent Classification (IPC) codes (A61K, A61P) and keyword 
searches ("Alzheimer" or "Alzheimer's disease"). We excluded irrelevant items 
(e.g., test reagents) and concentrated on legally granted patents to ensure 
reliable and enforceable innovations. Geographic layouts, applicant rankings, 
and citation analyses were conducted to reveal innovation hotspots and 
high-impact patents.
RESULT: Annual granted patent volumes remained stable until a slight decline 
after 2021. While large pharmaceutical companies (e.g., Hoffmann-La Roche) 
dominated in terms of total patent families, several highly cited patents 
originated from smaller or less prolific applicants, reflecting unique or 
foundational breakthroughs. The United States led in patent counts, yet notable 
growth was seen in China and other emerging markets. Small-molecule compounds 
(including isoindoline derivatives) and monoclonal antibodies were predominant 
targets, though gene therapy and neuroinflammation-focused patents also gained 
traction.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight how AD patent landscapes integrate multiple 
scientific pathways and commercial strategies. The discrepancy between top 
patentees and top-cited inventions underscores the multifaceted nature of 
innovation in AD therapeutics. These insights, combined with broader scientific 
context, may guide policy decisions, R&D collaborations, and future research 
priorities in tackling this urgent healthcare challenge.

BCG Impact on PD-1/PD-L1 Expression in Peripheral Immunocytes of Cancer 
Patients-A Potential Explanation for Its Activity in Preventing Alzheimer's 
Disease.

We found, retrospectively, that BCG therapy in non-muscle invasive bladder 
cancer (NMIBC) reduces the rate of Alzheimer's disease. Blockade of the ligand 
PD-L1 or its checkpoint receptor PD-1 has been shown to improve cognitive 
function and reduce brain pathology features in a mouse model of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). Given that peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are involved 
in aging brain pathology and thus represent a potential AD therapeutic target, 
we analyzed the impact of BCG on the expression of PD-1, PD-L1, and inflammation 
modulators in PBMCs. Cryopreserved PBMCs pre- and post-BCG-treated six melanoma 
and six NMIBC patients were repurposed for immunoelectrophoretic analysis of 
PBMC-extracted proteins. PBMCs, post-BCG treatment in melanoma patients, were 
harvested only 4 months after the start of treatment (short BCG period), whereas 
the PBMCs of NMIBC patients were harvested 24 to 52 months after starting the 
BCG treatment. In melanoma PBMCs, BCG upregulated PD-L1 (p = 0.052) while 
downregulating PD-1 (insignificantly, p = 0.16). In contrast, in NMIBC patients, 
BCG downregulated PD-L1 (insignificantly, p = 0.67), while upregulating PD-1 (p 
= 0.0082). PD-L1 positive correlation with p-IkB (r = 0.7228) under BCG is 
inverted to that of PD-L1 against IkB (p = -0.9491). The difference between 
these opposite correlations is significant (p = 0.011), indicating that PD-L1 is 
upregulated early after BCG treatment, in association with p-IKB, which enables 
inflammation. This association subsided later, and for PD-1, did not occur at 
the short or long BCG periods. Experiments with a larger number of patients may 
substantiate the hypothesis that an increase in PD-1 by BCG relative to PD-L1 
may protect against AD.

Dementia is a broad category of neurodegenerative pathologies characterized by a 
progressive decline in two or more cognitive domains, including memory, 
language, executive and visuospatial functions, personality, and behavior, 
resulting in the loss of the ability to perform instrumental and/or basic daily 
activities. One of the most common types of dementia is Alzheimer's disease. 
Current approved treatments for Alzheimer's disease are mainly limited to 
alleviating cognitive, behavioral, and psychological deficits. To date, four 
drugs belonging to two families have been approved for the treatment of 
Alzheimer's disease: acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine, 
rivastigmine) and antiglutamatergic drugs (memantine). Drugs delay the 
progression of the disease, but they cause a number of side effects. Many 
scientific studies have focused on finding natural products with potential 
neuroprotective properties and no or minimal cytotoxicity that can support 
current drug therapy. The main objective of this review is to analyze and 
describe the neuroprotective potential of selected groups of natural substances 
(polyphenols, alkaloids, terpenoids) in one of the commonly performed in vivo 
studies, the scopolamine-induced animal model of Alzheimer's disease. The 
article is a review of literature reports from the last 5 years, and the 
information collected indicates that the neuroprotective activity of natural 
compounds may prove to be a potential alternative or add-on for Alzheimer's 
disease therapy.

Medical University, Nanjing, China.

OBJECTIVE: To identify potential druggable targets for Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
by analyzing circulating inflammatory proteins using Mendelian randomization 
(MR).
METHODS: Two-sample MR analysis was employed to investigate the causal 
relationships between 91 circulating inflammatory proteins and AD. The primary 
MR method utilized was the inverse variance weighted (IVW) model, while the 
weighted median (WM) and MR-Egger models were applied for sensitivity analysis. 
To assess the heterogeneity of instrumental variables (IVs), Cochran's Q-test 
and I2 statistics were utilized. Additionally, ChEMBL and DGIdb databases with 
Bayesian colocalization analysis were consulted to identify potential druggable 
proteins.
RESULTS: MR analysis identified eight inflammatory proteins significantly 
associated with AD risk. Among these proteins, TNFB [odds ratio (OR): 1.06, 95% 
Confidence Interval (CI): 1.02-1.11, p = 8.77×10- 3], TSLP (OR: 1.10, 95% CI: 
1.01-1.19, p = 0.028), S100A12 (OR: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.01-1.18, p = 0.03), CD244 
(OR: 1.07, 95% CI: 1.00-1.13, p = 0.036), and IL33 (OR: 1.08, 95% CI: 1.00 
-1.17, p = 0.048) were identified as proteins associated with elevated AD risk. 
Conversely, three inflammatory proteins exhibited a protective effect against 
AD, including NRTN (OR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.85-0.99; p = 0.019), CCL4 (OR: 0.95, 95% 
CI: 0.91-1.00, p = 0.029), and MMP1 (OR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.87-1.00, p = 0.049). 
Notably, according to the gene-drug analysis, TSLP, S100A12, CD244, CCL4, and 
MMP1 were identified as druggable. Additionally, MMP1 (PP4 = 0.92) and CCL4 (PP4 
= 0.87) in the prefrontal cortex had the strongest colocalization evidence (PP4 
> 0.85), suggesting they could potentially serve as novel therapeutic targets 
for AD.
CONCLUSIONS: Integrative genetic analyses indicate that genetically determined 
circulating levels of TSLP, S100A12, CD244, CCL4, and MMP1 exert causal effects 
on AD risk. These findings nominate all five proteins as potential therapeutic 
targets, with MMP1 and CCL4 representing priority candidates warranting further 
mechanistic investigation and clinical validation.

neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. We provide updates on 
previously proposed mechanisms and identify new mechanisms particularly 
concerning how sleep disturbances affect memory-related neural circuits.
RECENT FINDINGS: In this review, we focus on the multiple mechanisms that 
potentially mediate the relationship between sleep and Alzheimer's disease. We 
present updates for previously hypothesized mechanisms such as sleep-related 
changes in production/release and clearance of amyloid-β and tau proteins as 
well as more recently proposed mechanisms relating to tau phosphorylation, the 
orexin system, astrocytes, and microglia. We also highlight how disruptions in 
sleep EEG oscillations that underlie memory-related neural circuits, such as 
slow wave activity, theta bursts, sleep spindles, and gamma ripples, change in 
Alzheimer's disease.
SUMMARY: Disturbed sleep increases Alzheimer's disease risk via multiple 
potential mechanisms that suggest multiple targets to test approved and 
effective treatments of sleep disorders to prevent or delay Alzheimer's disease.

BACKGROUND: Short telomere length (TL), a hallmark of biological ageing, has 
been associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but its 
pathophysiological role remains unclear. This study explored the relationship 
between blood leukocyte TL (LTL), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers 
changes, and brain structure across early stages of the AD continuum.
METHODS: We included 346 cognitively unimpaired participants (aged 49-71) from 
the ALFA cohort, enriched for AD risk (53.2% APOE-ε4 carriers; 34% 
amyloid-positive). LTL was measured at baseline (visit 0) using quantitative 
PCR. Associations were assessed between baseline LTL and CSF biomarkers at visit 
1 (mean follow-up from baseline = 3.98 years, SD = 1.02), and with changes in 
CSF biomarkers between visits 1 and 2 (mean interval = 3.45 years, SD = 0.58). 
Cortical thickness in ageing- and AD-vulnerable brain regions was evaluated by 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at visit 1. Analyses were stratified by APOE-ε4 
status and amyloid-tau (AT) profiles. Mediation models tested whether CSF 
biomarkers mediated LTL-cortical thickness associations.
FINDINGS: Shorter LTL was associated with higher astrocytic reactivity at visit 
1 and with increased synaptic dysfunction over time. Among APOE-ε4 carriers and 
AT-positive individuals, shorter LTL was associated with higher p-tau181 and 
neurodegeneration markers. Shorter LTL was associated with greater cortical 
thickness in ageing- and AD-vulnerable regions, partially mediated by astrocytic 
reactivity biomarkers.
INTERPRETATION: These findings suggest that shorter telomeres are associated 
with early AD-related biological changes, potentially via mechanisms involving 
astrocytic reactivity and brain structural alterations. LTL may serve as an 
early marker of vulnerability to neurodegenerative processes in at-risk 
populations.

The lack of therapeutics that can fully halt the progression of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) has prompted us to design and synthesize a series of 
tetralone/thiochromanone-based benzyl pyridinium salts (4a-4s) aimed at 
modulating multiple pathological targets associated with AD. Preliminary 
screening for cholinesterase and monoamine oxidase inhibition identified 
compounds 4e and 4g as the most potent inhibitors (AChE IC₅₀: 2.17 ± 0.13 μM and 
2.29 ± 0.15 μM; MAO-B IC₅₀: 0.89 ± 0.07 μM and 0.92 ± 0.16 μM, respectively). 
Both compounds also demonstrated anti-neuroinflammatory activity by reducing 
pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) and downregulating COX-2 and NF-κB 
signalling pathways. Additionally, 4e exhibited significant ROS scavenging 
ability by mitigating oxidative stress and conferred neuroprotection in SH-SY5Y 
cells by attenuating Aβ₁-₄₂-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis. 
Collectively, these findings position compound 4e as a promising 
multi-target-directed ligand (MTDL) for the treatment of AD.

Galanthamine, an alkaloid derived from the Amaryllidaceae family, serves as an 
acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. Due to its central cholinergic properties, this 
compound is being actively studied as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's 
disease. However, the broader scope of its biological effects remains poorly 
understood. In this study, we explored the therapeutic potential of galanthamine 
in promoting neuronal differentiation and enhancing neurite outgrowth in neural 
stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs). Our detailed analysis demonstrated notable 
changes in neuronal morphology and complexity during maturation following 
galanthamine exposure. Notably, the compound significantly increased the 
proportion of neurons with multiple neurites, indicating its ability to 
stimulate neurite formation and foster the development of complex neuronal 
networks. Furthermore, galanthamine treatment led to a marked rise in the number 
of mature-appearing neurons, distinguished by elongated and intricate dendrites, 
highlighting its potential to enhance neural plasticity and repair mechanisms. 
Importantly, we also identified that galanthamine facilitates neuronal 
differentiation in NSPCs by up-regulating the insulin-like growth factor 2 
signaling pathway. Collectively, these findings provide valuable insights into 
galanthamine's role in Alzheimer's disease and emphasize its promise as a 
therapeutic agent for this neurodegenerative disorder.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) manifests as progressive cognitive deterioration with 
significant impact on patient independence and quality of life. While 
conventional treatments offer limited efficacy, Traditional Chinese Medicine 
(TCM) rehabilitation nursing presents a complementary approach deserving 
systematic evaluation. To synthesize existing evidence on the efficacy of TCM 
rehabilitation nursing for cognitive enhancement in AD through comprehensive 
meta-analysis. We conducted systematic searches across multiple electronic 
databases (PubMed, Embase, CNKI, Wanfang, and VIP) for controlled studies 
published from 2010 to present examining TCM rehabilitation nursing 
interventions for AD patients. Methodological quality was assessed using the 
Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool. Primary outcomes included Mini-Mental State 
Examination (MMSE), Activities of Daily Living (ADL), and treatment efficacy 
rates. Statistical synthesis employed RevMan 5.3 with random or fixed effects 
models based on heterogeneity assessment. Nine eligible studies encompassing 864 
participants (432 intervention, 432 control) met inclusion criteria. 
Meta-analysis revealed significantly improved cognitive function in the TCM 
rehabilitation nursing group compared to conventional care, with MMSE scores 
showing substantial enhancement (mean difference = 4.63, 95% confidence 
interval: 3.74-5.53, P<0.00001). Treatment response analysis demonstrated higher 
rates of marked clinical improvement (risk ratio = 2.78, 95% CI: 1.65-4.70, 
P=0.0001) and substantially reduced treatment failure rates (85% reduction, 
P<0.00001). Though ADL scores showed positive trends, these did not reach 
statistical significance (P=0.07). TCM rehabilitation nursing demonstrates 
significant efficacy in enhancing cognitive function and treatment outcomes in 
AD patients. These findings support its integration into comprehensive care 
strategies, though additional research with standardized protocols is warranted 
for optimal implementation.

The mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNAcn) plays a vital role in cellular 
energy metabolism and mitochondrial health. As mitochondria are responsible for 
adenosine triphosphate production through oxidative phosphorylation, maintaining 
an appropriate mtDNAcn level is vital for the overall cellular function. 
Alterations in mtDNAcn have been linked to various diseases, including 
neurodegenerative disorders, metabolic conditions, and cancers, making it an 
important biomarker for understanding the disease pathogenesis. The accurate 
estimation of mtDNAcn is essential for clinical applications. Quantitative 
polymerase chain reaction and next-generation sequencing are commonly employed 
techniques with distinct advantages and limitations. Clinically, mtDNAcn serves 
as a valuable indicator for early diagnosis, disease progression, and treatment 
response. For instance, in oncology, elevated mtDNAcn levels in blood samples 
are associated with tumor aggressiveness and can aid in monitoring treatment 
efficacy. In neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, 
altered mtDNAcn patterns provide insights into disease mechanisms and 
progression. Understanding and estimating mtDNAcn are critical for advancing 
diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in various medical fields. As research 
continues to uncover the implications of mtDNAcn alterations, its potential as a 
clinical biomarker is likely to expand, thereby enhancing our ability to 
diagnose and manage complex diseases.

The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a critical structure that maintains the brain's 
homeostasis by regulating the transport of molecules and protecting it from 
harmful substances. However, in neurological diseases such as ischemic stroke, 
Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis, the integrity 
and function of the BBB can be significantly compromised. In these conditions, 
BBB disruption leads to increased permeability, which facilitates 
neuroinflammation, exacerbates neuronal damage, and accelerates disease 
progression. Recent research has highlighted the potential of lipid-based 
carriers, including liposomes and lipid droplets (LDs), in modulating the BBB's 
integrity and function in various neurological diseases. Liposomes, with their 
ability to cross the BBB via mechanisms such as receptor-mediated transcytosis 
and carrier-mediated transport, are emerging as promising vehicles for the 
targeted delivery of therapeutic agents to the brain. These properties allow 
liposomes to effectively reduce infarct size and promote neuroprotection in 
ischemic stroke, as well as deliver drugs in the treatment of neurodegenerative 
diseases. Furthermore, LDs-dynamic regulators of lipid metabolism and cellular 
energy-play an essential role in maintaining cellular homeostasis, particularly 
during periods of stress when BBB function is compromised. These LDs help 
sustain cellular energy needs and modulate inflammatory responses, which are key 
factors in maintaining BBB integrity. Surface modifications of liposomes can 
further enhance their targeting efficiency, enabling them to selectively bind to 
specific brain cell types, including neurons, astrocytes, and microglia. This 
customization improves the precision of therapeutic delivery and supports the 
development of more tailored treatments. However, challenges such as immune 
responses, rapid clearance, and complement activation-related toxicity continue 
to hinder the broader application of liposomes and LDs in clinical settings. 
This review will focus on the roles of liposomes and LDs in regulating BBB 
integrity across a range of neurological diseases, discussing their potential 
for targeted drug delivery, neuroprotection, and the modulation of 
neuroinflammation. Additionally, we will explore the strategies being developed 
to address the limitations that currently restrict their clinical use.

Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has reduced the incidence of 
HIV-related mortality, leading to a growing population of older virally 
suppressed people with HIV (PWH). cART has also decreased the prevalence of 
HIV-associated dementia; however, many virally suppressed PWH still experience 
milder forms of cognitive impairment. It remains unclear whether aging virally 
suppressed PWH demonstrate distinct risks or patterns of neurodegenerative 
pathology. We examined brain tissue of 13 virally suppressed PWH and 13 matched 
HIV-negative controls from a community-based cohort and characterized β-amyloid 
(Aβ), tau, α-synuclein, and TDP-43 pathology. Both groups had similar 
demographics, medical comorbidities, and routine histologic brain findings. PWH 
demonstrated trends toward an increased prevalence of both Alzheimer disease 
(AD) and non-AD neurodegenerative pathologies, including Aβ pathology, higher 
stage tau pathology, aging-related tau astrogliopathy, and α-synuclein 
pathology. They showed similar trends toward increased severity of Aβ and tau 
pathology. We also identified a negative correlation between the burden of 
entorhinal cortical neurofibrillary tangles and end-of-life body mass index in 
PWH. Thus, PWH may have a greater burden of neurodegenerative pathology, 
including both AD and non-AD neurodegenerative pathologies; there is a need for 
the assessment of neurodegenerative pathology in community-based cohort studies 
to understand mechanisms of HIV-associated neuropathology and cognitive 
impairment in aging virally suppressed PWH.

INTRODUCTION: Neurodegenerative disorders (NDs) are characterized by progressive 
loss of function and destruction of the central and peripheral nervous systems. 
These disorders result in devastating irreversible cognitive decline and affect 
millions of people worldwide. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common cause of 
dementia that increases in incidence with increasing age. Limbic-predominant 
amnestic neurodegenerative syndrome (LANS) is another common etiology of 
amnestic symptoms and often affects the "oldest-old" of the population. The two 
disorders share many similarities yet are clearly pathologically distinct. 
Establishing robust classifications to distinguish these two disorders is key to 
future management and care of an aging population. The present investigation 
explored the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders (NDs), specifically 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), limbic-predominant amnestic neurodegenerative syndrome 
(LANS), and limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE).
METHODS: We performed a comprehensive narrative review of the literature, 
covering studies from database inception through November 2024. We searched 
PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar for 
relevant publications. We also reviewed reference lists of key articles. Two 
authors independently screened titles/abstracts for relevance and extracted data 
on study design, patient population, neuropathologic findings, imaging/biomarker 
methods, and clinical features. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion. This 
review synthesized findings on the need for LANS criteria and compared LANS to 
AD and LATE across clinical, imaging, pathologic, and biomarker domains.
RESULTS: A comprehensive analysis of the key pathologic features and 
distinctions among selected neurodegenerative syndromes was carried out using 
peer-reviewed literature.
CONCLUSIONS: Recently proposed clinical criteria for LANS are a milestone in the 
characterization and further treatment of neurodegenerative disease. 
Understanding the minute differences in pathophysiology among various NDs allows 
for pioneering more targeted disease-modifying treatments. This narrative review 
provides concise reflection between AD and other NDs involving LATE-NC changes.

As a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive cognitive decline, 
the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still poorly understood, and 
there is no effective cure currently available. Traditional Chinese medicine 
(TCM) prescription Yangming-Kaixin-Yizhi formula (YKY) has been clinically 
applied for the treatment of memory loss related disorders for more than 300 
years with remarkable efficacy, but its pharmacological mechanism remains 
unclear. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects of YKY on AD 
and its molecular mechanisms. We evaluated YKY's ameliorative effects on the AD 
phenotype in 3xTg-AD mice using the Morris water maze, histopathological 
staining, and immunofluorescence assays. The major chemical components of YKY 
were identified by UPLC-QTOF-MS/MS. Network pharmacology was employed to analyze 
the molecular mechanisms of YKY in treating AD, followed by validation of its 
regulatory effects on key pathways through immunofluorescence experiments and 
molecular docking. The results showed that YKY could significantly improve 
learning and memory ability, neuronal loss, β-amyloid deposition and glial cell 
activation in 3xTg-AD mice. 48 chemical components were identified from YKY, and 
network pharmacology analysis of them showed that YKY may improve AD by 
regulating apoptosis, PI3K/Akt and MAPK pathways. Immunofluorescence and 
molecular docking results also confirmed the regulatory effect of YKY on key 
targets of apoptosis, PI3K/Akt and p38 MAPK pathways. In conclusion, by 
integrating animal experiments and network pharmacology, the present study 
revealed the mechanism of YKY in inhibiting neuronal apoptosis by regulating 
PI3K/Akt and p38 MAPK pathways, which providing modern scientific evidence for 
the traditional clinical application of YKY.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative condition characterized 
by memory deficits and cognitive decline. Ivermectin, an antiparasitic agent, 
has shown neuroprotective effects. The present study was conducted to determine 
the protective effects of ivermectin in a streptozocin-induced Alzheimer's model 
in rats.
METHODS: Alzheimer's model was induced by bilateral intracerebroventricular 
injection of streptozocin (3 mg/kg BW, 2 doses). Ivermectin was administered 
intraperitoneally at a dose of 2 mg/kg. On day 19, after behavioral memory and 
learning tests, the samples were collected for histological and enzymatic 
studies.
RESULTS: Ivermectin reduced the histopathological changes, including pyknotic 
and dead neurons and the accumulation of Aβ plaques. Ivermectin administration 
also reduced serum (p < 0.0001) and brain tissue (p < 0.01) acetylcholinesterase 
activity as well as improved learning (p < 0.05) and spatial memory 
(p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Ivermectin demonstrates protective effects in the STZ-induced 
Alzheimer's model by reducing pathological changes and Aβ plaques, 
acetylcholinesterase activity, as well as improving memory and learning.

Plain Language Summary: Alzheimer’s disease is a neurological disease and the 
most common cause of dementia in the elderly. Despite progress in Alzheimer’s 
research, there is no definitive cure for this disease, and therefore, more 
research is needed to find new drugs to treat this disease. Our previous study 
showed the neuroprotective effects of ivermectin in ischemic stroke. Hence, our 
aim in the present study was to investigate the possible beneficial and 
therapeutic effects of ivermectin in Alzheimer’s disease. For this purpose, we 
first induced Alzheimer’s in rats and then treated them with ivermectin at a 
dose of 2 mg/kg for three days. The results we obtained showed that 
administration of ivermectin can reduce brain tissue damage and improve memory 
and learning. Ivermectin also caused a decrease in the activity of the 
acetylcholinesterase enzyme. This enzyme breaks down acetylcholine, a 
neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in memory and learning. Therefore, a 
decrease in the activity of this enzyme reduces the loss of acetylcholine. This 
study concludes that ivermectin could be considered as a potential treatment for 
Alzheimer’s disease. It should be noted that this study was conducted on 
laboratory animals and further studies are needed to confirm its use in humans.

One of the traditional treatments in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is administration 
of memantine, the NMDA receptor antagonist. However, the molecular mechanism of 
the complex memantine action and the impact on the hippocampal proteome in 
humans is unknown. In this study, hippocampal proteins extracted from 
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded post mortem tissues obtained from healthy 
donors (n = 15), AD patients not treated with memantine (n = 11), and AD 
patients treated with memantine (n = 8) were investigated using tandem mass tag 
(TMT)-based quantitative proteomics. Memantine medication induced subtle but 
distinct changes in the hippocampal proteome in AD patients. Although it did not 
prevent the metabolic and physiologic decline associated with AD pathology, 
memantine administration upregulated several mitochondrially encoded proteins 
and mitigated the proteomic pattern of activated phagocytes. Furthermore, 
memantine specifically enhanced the expression of postsynaptic glutamatergic and 
GABAergic receptors and components of the respective pathways without affecting 
presynaptic proteome. This suggests that memantine treatment in AD patients not 
only alleviates excitotoxic stress by inhibiting NMDA receptor activity, but 
also triggers broader adaptations in the synaptic signaling and plasticity.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder that poses 
significant therapeutic challenges. Currently available treatments offer 
symptomatic relief but often yield suboptimal outcomes due to inter-individual 
variability in drug metabolism. Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes, particularly 
those exhibiting genetic polymorphisms, play a central role in the hepatic 
metabolism of many AD medications. This review focuses on the influence of 
CYP450 polymorphisms-specifically in CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and 
CYP3A4-on the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of approved anti-AD drugs. 
We discuss how variability in CYP450 expression and activity affects drug 
response, and examine the implications for adverse drug reactions, therapeutic 
failure, and dosage optimization. In addition, we evaluate current evidence for 
CYP450-mediated interactions with traditional Chinese medicines, which are 
increasingly used in complementary AD therapy. The potential for CYP450 
genotyping and phenotyping to guide personalized treatment strategies is 
critically assessed. We argue that integrating pharmacogenomics into clinical 
practice may enhance therapeutic precision, reduce adverse outcomes, and improve 
quality of life in patients with AD. This review provides updated insight into 
the clinical significance of CYP450 polymorphisms in AD therapy and outlines 
future directions for personalized medicine approaches.

BackgroundCapacity to deliver intravenous Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatments 
could constitute an obstacle to access in addition to AD specialist and PET scan 
capacity.ObjectiveWe aim to estimate the overall capacity for AD treatment 
infusions compared to expected demand in the United States.MethodsWe used 
published data and a survey of infusion sites to estimate the capacity to 
deliver AD treatments in physician offices, hospitals, standalone centers and at 
patients' homes from 2024 to 2033 relative to demand.ResultsCapacity for 
intravenous AD treatments is predicted to increase from 370,000 in 2024 to 5.2 
million infusions in 2033. Nevertheless, a significant shortfall of over 13 
million infusions remains in 2033, which would imply delayed access for 2.2 
million patients.ConclusionsLimited infusion capacity could impede AD treatment 
access and result in avoidable disability progression. Expansion of capacity is 
needed in the short run until treatments with alternative routes of 
administration become available.

BackgroundVirtual reality (VR) is a novel technology that can facilitate 
reminiscence in people with dementia. However, few studies have explored the 
role of VR's immersiveness in enhancing therapeutic outcomes.ObjectiveThis study 
aimed to analyze the effects of an immersive VR reminiscence session compared to 
a non-immersive session, focusing on engagement, behavioral and psychological 
symptoms (BPSD), and well-being, using behavioral observation and physiological 
metrics.MethodsA randomized crossover trial with a seven-day washout period was 
conducted. Engagement, BPSD and well-being were assessed before, during and 
after each intervention using both observational scales and heart rate 
variability analysis.Results20 participants (average age 80.55 years, 90% women) 
were recruited. Significant pre-post differences were found in behavioral 
engagement (z = -2.67, p = 0.008) and facial expression of apathy (z = -2.12, 
p = 0.034) during the immersive intervention. Additionally, lower apathy in 
terms of purposeful activity was observed during the immersive intervention 
(z = -2.24, p = 0.025). These results are particularly noteworthy given the 
sample size, which, although small, highlights a clear trend of behavioral and 
apathy change.ConclusionsThe results suggest that VR's immersiveness can enhance 
engagement in dementia intervention programs. As VR technology becomes more 
accessible and safer, continued research is needed to explore its therapeutic 
potential.

Corticobasal syndrome (CBS) is a combination of extrapyramidal disorders 
(asymmetric parkinsonism, dystonia, myoclonia) and cortical disorders (apraxia, 
disorders of complex types of sensitivity, the alien limb phenomenon). Most 
often, CBS is associated with corticobasal degeneration (CBD) or Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). In some cases, differential diagnosis between these diseases based 
only on clinical and neuroimaging data is challenging. Biological markers for AD 
may prove crucial in establishing an accurate diagnosis. Two cases of patients 
with CBS and Alzheimer-type memory disorders are presented. Asymmetric cortical 
atrophy was detected by brain MRI. In the presented cases, patients showed a 
significant decrease in the Aβ42 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid, which helped 
to establish the diagnosis of AD. The issues of differential diagnosis of BSC 
associated with CBS and AD are discussed. The use of biomarkers for atypical 
clinical manifestations of AD may help to make a diagnosis early. Accurate 
diagnosis of AD is necessary both for the timely administration of available

anti-amyloid therapy.

Publisher: Кортикобазальный синдром (КБС) представляет собой совокупность 
экстрапирамидных расстройств (асимметричный паркинсонизм, дистония, миоклония) и 
корковых нарушений (апраксия, нарушения сложных видов чувствительности, феномен 
чужой конечности). Наиболее часто в основе КБС лежит патология кортикобазальной 
дегенерации (КБД) или болезни Альцгеймера (БА). Провести дифференциальный 
диагноз между этими заболеваниями на основании только клинических и 
нейровизуализационных данных в ряде случаев затруднительно. Использование 
биологических маркеров БА может оказаться решающим для установления точного 
диагноза. Представлены наблюдения 2 пациентов с КБС и мнестическими нарушениями 
альцгеймеровского типа. По данным МРТ головного мозга была выявлена 
асимметричная атрофия коры. В наблюдаемых случаях у пациентов выявлено 
значительное снижение содержания Aβ42 в цереброспинальной жидкости, что 
позволило установить диагноз БА. Обсуждаются вопросы дифференциальной 
диагностики КБС, связанного с КБД и БА. Использование биомаркеров при атипичных 
клинических проявлениях БА может позволить установить диагноз на ранних стадиях 
заболевания. Точная диагностика БА необходима как для своевременного назначения 
доступных симптоматических препаратов, так и для определения показаний к 
патогенетической антиамилоидной терапии.

INTRODUCTION/AIMS: Giant axonal neuropathy (GAN) is a hereditary 
neurodegenerative disease due to the absence or loss of function of the 
gigaxonin gene. Pathologic findings in GAN are those of "dying-back" axonal 
degeneration, in which the distal axon degenerates but the more proximal axon 
and neuronal cell body remain intact. Aims of this study were to (1) document 
imaging abnormalities that may occur in the spinal cords of GAN patients; and 
(2) assess histologically the spinal cords of GAN rodent models.
METHODS: A clinical trial of intrathecal (IT) scAAV9/JeT-GAN gene transfer 
provided a cohort of GAN patients for study. We examined spinal magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) studies from a subset of pretreatment GAN patients ages 
6-14 years. For radiologic-pathologic correlation, we examined histologically 
spinal cords from GAN rodent models with pathological features of human GAN.
RESULTS: Of 10 GAN-patient spinal MRIs, 7 showed cervical or diffuse cord 
atrophy. Five MRIs additionally showed hyperintense, T2-signal abnormalities 
bilaterally in the cervical gracile tracts. Microscopy of GAN-rodent spinal 
cords revealed many actively degenerating axons in the cervical gracile tracts 
but few degenerating axons elsewhere in the cord.
DISCUSSION: The localization of spinal T-2 signal abnormalities to the cervical 
gracile tracts in GAN patients mirrors the localization of active dying-back 
axonal degeneration in GAN rodent models and suggests that these T2-signal 
abnormalities may be used as a surrogate marker of active axonal degeneration in 
the long tracts of the spinal cord in GAN and possibly other dying-back 
neurodegenerative diseases involving the spinal cord.

The discovery of the glymphatic system and the later rediscovery of the 
meningeal lymphatic network have significantly changed our understanding of 
central nervous system (CNS) waste clearance. Aging is linked to a gradual 
decline in these clearance pathways, resulting in waste buildup. As a result, 
therapeutic strategies targeting cerebral lymphatic function have garnered 
growing interest, with lymphatic surgery emerging as a promising option. We 
conducted a review until July 2025, providing an overview of the potential of 
lymphatic surgical techniques to enhance CNS metabolic waste clearance pathways 
as a therapeutic approach for brain lymphatic system disorders. Currently 
available data are limited, nine publications addressing this approach. These 
studies explore an innovative technique involving lymphatico-venous anastomoses 
(LVA) targeting deep cervical lymphatic vessels to promote clearance for the 
treatment of Alzheimer's or Parkinson's diseases. Cerebral lymphatic drainage is 
critical for effective brain waste elimination such as amyloid-β, phosphorylated 
tau, and α-synuclein, which are linked to neurodegenerative diseases. Viewing 
these lymphatic dysfunctions as a form of "cerebral lymphedema," LVA, already 
used in treating peripheral lymphedema, shows potential as a therapeutic 
approach. Although clinical evidence is still limited, lymphatic 
supermicrosurgery presents promising therapeutic possibilities for 
neurodegenerative diseases and other conditions related to impaired CNS 
lymphatic outflow.

Recent discoveries reveal that post-translational modifications (PTMs) do more 
than regulate protein activity - they encode conformational states that 
transform chaperones into epichaperomes: multimeric scaffolds that rewire 
protein-protein interaction networks. This emerging paradigm expands the 
framework of chaperone biology in disease and provides a structural basis for 
systems-level dysfunction in disorders such as cancer and Alzheimer's disease. 
This review explores how PTMs within intrinsically disordered regions drive 
epichaperome formation, how these scaffolds selectively regulate 
disease-enabling functions, and why their disruption normalizes pathological 
networks. By highlighting PTMs as molecular encoders of supramolecular 
assemblies, we propose a shift from targeting proteins to targeting network 
architectures that sustain and perpetuate disease - a concept with broad 
implications for cell biology, disease propagation, and therapeutic design.

INTRODUCTION: Dementia caregiving is typically provided through a network of 
multiple individuals, particularly in diverse populations. Although family 
members of people living with Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's 
disease-related dementias, especially spouses and adult children, often assume 
the role of informal care partner, there is a growing number of non-traditional 
informal care partners (ie, non-spousal, non-biological child) given societal 
changes in family structure. The proposed study aims to systematically review 
the caregiver literature to better understand how caregivers are defined, the 
approaches and tools commonly used to evaluate the caregiver network and common 
caregiver outcome assessments that are used in clinical and research settings.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The following protocol will be conducted according to 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. 
Searches will be developed by health science library informationists for Medline 
(Ovid), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature Complete 
(EBSCOhost), AgeLine (EBSCOhost) and APA PsycInfo (EBSCOhost) databases to 
identify tools, measures or approaches to the characterisation of complex 
caregiver networks that include non-traditional care partners (ie, step-family 
and non-marital romantic partners, blended families, families of origin, 
families of choice and family friends). In addition, we will also consider data 
elements from large-scale cohorts that include caregiver respondents (eg, 
National Health and Ageing Trends Study; National Study of Caregiving). There 
will be no limits set on article language, geography or publication date. 
Articles that are identified in languages other than English will be included if 
there is an English translation available. Search results will be reviewed by 
two independent raters for inclusion; in cases where there are discrepancies in 
inclusion/exclusion recommendations, the two reviewers will meet to establish 
consensus; a third reviewer will adjudicate when necessary. An 
artificial-intelligence-based software will be used to aid in extraction; these 
results will be double-checked by a human, and instances of discrepancies will 
be reviewed by a second independent rater. A narrative synthesis approach will 
be used to analyse the data.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Information from this review will be published in 
peer-reviewed journals and presented at scientific conferences, with the goal of 
providing future recommendations for how to define a non-traditional caregiver, 
the systematic assessment of caregiver networks and a summary of the most 
commonly used outcome measures in the caregiver literature. Given that scoping 
reviews of published articles are not regulated under federal regulations 
governing human subject research (45 CFR 46 or 21 CFR 50/56), institutional 
review board approval is not required.

Dysbiosis is the imbalance in the composition and function of the microbial 
community in the human body that leads to various multifactorial diseases, 
including autoimmune diseases, Alzheimer's disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. To 
address this problem, numerous research has demonstrated the potential of 
bacteriophages as therapeutic agents to regulate dysbiosis in the human body. 
Furthermore, phage-based products such as endolysins, proteins, and peptides 
have also been demonstrated to influence the regulation of dysbiosis. 
Elucidation of quorum sensing (QS) mechanisms and the development of phage-based 
therapies incorporating CRISPR-Cas systems have emerged as a promising strategy 
for the management of dysbiosis and other prevalent diseases. Collectively, 
phage-based therapeutics and their derivatives demonstrate significant potential 
for the modulation of dysbiotic states within the human host. Hence, an 
exploration of phage-mediated mechanisms and the potential of phage-derived 
molecules was conducted to elucidate their therapeutic efficacy in dysbiosis and 
inform future translational research.

Neuroinflammation plays a pivotal role in the onset and progression of epilepsy. 
In this review, we critically examine: (1) the dual roles of astrocytes and 
microglia in maintaining a chronic inflammation and its contribution to 
epileptogenesis and seizures; (2) the crosstalk between the histamine released 
by mast cells and the brain histaminergic neurotransmission, an underexplored 
mechanism for seizures; (3) the potential of inflammatory mediators as 
biomarkers for predicting prognosis and risk stratification; (4) the shared 
inflammatory pathways linking epilepsy and Alzheimer's disease, with special 
attention to reactive astrocyte and ferroptosis markers in identifying 
individuals at risk; (5) emerging therapeutic strategies, including conventional 
anti-inflammatory drugs and traditional medicine, for seizure control through 
modulation of neuroinflammation. With these carefully chosen topics, we 
introduce new molecular findings reinforcing the crucial role of 
neuroinflammation in epilepsy and as a marker for epileptogenesis, a topic of 
special interest for the acquired epilepsies such as hippocampal sclerosis. 
Moreover, we explored other mechanisms that received far less attention, 
especially those linking epilepsy with Alzheimer's disease, and the potential 
role of mast cells in seizures.

BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and its specific 
underlying neuropathologies (frontotemporal lobar degeneration; FTLD-Tau and 
FTLD-TDP) are challenging, and thus, fluid biomarkers are needed to improve 
diagnostic accuracy.
METHODS: We used proximity extension assays to analyze 665 proteins in 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from a multicenter cohort, which included 
patients with FTD (n = 189), Alzheimer’s Disease dementia (AD; n = 232), and 
cognitively unimpaired individuals (n = 196). In a subset, FTLD neuropathology 
was determined based on phenotype or genotype (FTLD-Tau = 87 and FTLD-TDP = 67). 
Differences in protein expression profiles were analyzed using nested linear 
models. Penalized generalized linear modeling was used to identify 
classification protein panels, which were translated to custom multiplex assays 
and validated in two clinical cohorts (cohort 1: n = 161; cohort 2: n = 162), 
one autopsy-confirmed cohort (n = 100), and one genetic cohort (n = 55).
RESULTS: Forty-three proteins were differentially regulated in FTD compared to 
controls and AD, reflecting axon development, regulation of synapse assembly, 
and cell-cell adhesion mediator activity pathways. Classification analysis 
identified a 14- and 13-CSF protein panel that discriminated FTD from controls 
(FTD diagnostic panel, AUC: 0.96) or AD (FTD differential diagnostic panel, AUC: 
0.91). Custom multiplex panels confirmed the strong discriminative performancen 
between FTD and controls (AUCs > 0.96) and between FTD and AD (AUCs > 0.88) 
across three validation cohorts, including one with autopsy confirmation 
(AUCs > 0.90). Validation in genetic FTD (including C9orf72, GRN, and MAPT 
mutation carriers) revealed high accuracy of the FTD diagnostic panel in 
identifying both the presymptomatic (AUCs > 0.95) and symptomatic (AUC: 1) 
stages. Six proteins were differentially regulated between FTLD-TDP and 
FTLD-Tau. However, a reproducible classification model could not be generated 
(AUC: 0.80).
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this study introduces novel FTD-specific biomarker panels 
with potential use in diagnostic settings.

BACKGROUND: Cognitive training represents an important potential therapeutic 
strategy for mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In our recently completed trial, 
crossword puzzles were superior to computerized cognitive training on 
Alzheimer's disease assessment scale-cognitive subscale-11 (ADAS-Cog11) and 
function, correlating with decreased brain atrophy over 78 weeks.
METHODS: COGIT-2 is a 78-week, multicenter, clinical trial comparing home-based, 
high-dose crosswords (4 puzzles per week) to low-dose crosswords (1 puzzle per 
week) and a health education control group in 240 MCI subjects. Crossword 
puzzles, administered by the CogniFit research platform, have been designed to 
have a moderate level of difficulty.
RESULTS: The primary outcome is change in ADAS-Cog14 and the main secondary 
outcome is change in informant reported daily functioning. Additional outcomes 
include changes in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) hippocampal volume and 
cortical thickness as well as changes in plasma neurofilament light and plasma 
pTau217.
CONCLUSIONS: If the efficacy of computerized crossword puzzle training is 
confirmed in COGIT-2, crosswords training could become a low-cost, home-based, 
scalable, cognitive enhancement tool for people at risk for Alzheimer's disease. 
The dose comparison will provide useful information on the preferred frequency 
of crossword puzzle training.

Mitochondria: Key Mediator for Environmental Toxicant-Induced Neurodegeneration.

Ahmedabad, India.

Compiling evidence strongly suggests the involvement of environmental toxicants, 
including heavy metals (aluminum, arsenic, lead, copper, cadmium, mercury, and 
manganese), pesticides, and solvents, as the prime culprits of neurodegenerative 
disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. The 
pathogenesis of environmental toxicant-induced neurodegenerative disease remains 
elusive. Studies carried out in the last decade suggest that dysfunctional 
mitochondria are increasingly recognized as a key factor in the progression of 
neurodegenerative diseases. Mitochondria, the essential organelles that regulate 
cellular energy production, are particularly vital in neurons, which have high 
energy demands and depend on proper mitochondrial function for survival. 
Environmental toxicants have been shown to impair mitochondrial membranes, 
disrupt the electron transport chain, increase oxidative stress, and damage 
mitochondrial DNA, leading to progressive neurodegeneration, with mitochondrial 
fragmentation and oxidative stress that worsens neurodegeneration. There are 
currently no disease-modifying treatments available for most neurodegenerative 
disorders, largely due to the lack of suitable molecular targets. Targeting 
mitochondria presents a rational strategy for neuroprotective therapy, with the 
potential to slow or halt disease progression. In view of this, this review 
highlights the central role of mitochondria in environmental toxicant-induced 
neurodegeneration, emphasizing how environmental exposures drive mitochondrial 
dysfunction and accelerate disease progression. Understanding these mechanisms 
is crucial for identifying environmental risk factors and developing targeted 
interventions. This will provide a foundation for future research targeting 
mitochondria and developing suitable therapeutic interventions for 
neurodegenerative diseases.

BackgroundThere are currently no relevant clinical research reports on the 
application of human umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells (hUCBMCs) treatment 
for Alzheimer's disease (AD) in humans.ObjectiveTo observe the clinical efficacy 
of intravenous transplantation of hUCBMCs in patients with AD.MethodsEleven AD 
patients with Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scores of 1 (mild) or 2 (moderate) 
were selected. Patients continued standard AD medication and received three 
intravenous infusions of UCBMCs, spaced seven days apart. Neurological and 
psychological assessments, including MMSE, ADAS-Cog, ADL, and PSQI scores, were 
conducted by neurologists at baseline and 1, 3, and 6 months post-treatment. The 
impact of UCBMCs on cognitive function, daily living activities, sleep 
disorders, and any adverse reactions were monitored. Repeated measures ANOVA and 
LSD-t post-hoc tests were used to analyze score changes.ResultsRepeated measures 
ANOVA revealed differences in MMSE, ADAS-Cog, ADL, and PSQI scores across the 
evaluated time points. Pairwise comparisons indicated substantial improvements, 
with MMSE scores increasing at 1, 3, and 6 months post-treatment, while ADAS-Cog 
scores decreased. ADL scores showed improvement at 1 and 3 months, and PSQI 
scores decreased consistently at all post-treatment intervals. Notably, MMSE and 
ADL scores peaked at 3 months before gradually declining, ADAS-Cog scores 
reached their lowest point at 3 months before increasing, and PSQI scores were 
lowest at 1 month, followed by a gradual rise.ConclusionsIntravenous infusion of 
UCBMCs can temporarily improve cognitive function, enhance daily living 
activities, and alleviate sleep disorders in AD patients, with a high safety 
profile.

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide, 
particularly in older adults. While the Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation 
2-Older Persons (SCORE2-OP) model estimates 10-year cardiovascular risk in this 
population, its validation in general European cohorts remains limited. Given 
growing relationships between sleep disturbances and cardiovascular risk, we 
aimed to validate SCORE2-OP in a French cohort and assess the incremental value 
of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS).
METHODS: We included 4626 participants aged 70+ from the Three-City cohort, 
without cardiovascular disease and dementia at baseline. The SCORE2-OP model 
calibrated for low-cardiovascular risk regions was used to estimate 10-year 
cardiovascular risk. Calibration was assessed using observed-to-expected 
cumulative incidence ratios and calibration curves; discrimination using the 
area under the curve (AUC). Cox proportional hazards models examined 
associations between sleep symptoms (poor sleep quality, EDS, insomnia symptoms, 
sleep apnea [proxy]) and cardiovascular events. Incremental predictive value of 
significant symptoms was quantified by ΔAUC and net reclassification improvement 
(NRI).
RESULTS: Over 10 years, the observed cumulative incidence of fatal and non-fatal 
coronary heart disease or stroke was 10.55%; 95% confidence intervals 
(CI) = (9.62; 11.48), while the SCORE2-OP predicted risk was 14.04%; 95% 
CI = (13.85; 14.24), yielding an observed-to-expected ratio of 0.75; 95% CI = 
(0.69; 0.80). Discrimination was moderate (AUC = 61.71%, 95% CI = [58.64; 
64.78]). EDS was the only sleep symptom independently associated with 
cardiovascular events (adjusted hazard-ratio = 1.32, 95% CI = [1.05; 1.65]). 
Adding EDS to SCORE2-OP did not improve overall discrimination (ΔAUC = +0.72%, 
95% CI = [-0.05; 1.50]) or reclassification (NRI = +1.33%, 95% CI = [-3.27; 
5.93]). Sex-stratified analyses showed significant improvement in discrimination 
in men (ΔAUC = +2.27%, 95% CI = [0.54; 4.00]), but not in women. Moreover, EDS 
improved reclassification in low (< 7.5%) and intermediate (7.5%-15%) 
cardiovascular risk groups (NRI = +12%, 95% CI = [3.56; 20.43] and 
NRI = +12.44%, 95% CI = [7.23; 17.65], respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: In this French cohort, SCORE2-OP overestimated cardiovascular risk 
and showed moderate discrimination. EDS improved SCORE2-OP performance in 
intermediate cardiovascular risk groups where treatments are uncertain, 
highlighting its clinical relevance; although implications for prevention 
strategies require further study.

INTRODUCTION: Anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) slow cognitive decline 
in Alzheimer's disease but may cause amyloid-related imaging abnormalities 
(ARIA), which can rarely be disabling or fatal. This qualitative study 
investigates how clinicians communicate the benefits and risks of mAbs to 
patients and caregivers.
METHODS: Semi-structured interviews with clinicians who prescribe mAbs at seven 
academic medical centers. Hybrid inductive-deductive thematic analysis by 
interdisciplinary researchers.
RESULTS: In 27 clinician interviews (women [n = 17], White individuals [n = 19], 
neurologists [n = 17]), three themes emerged. First, clinicians varied in 
techniques used and concepts emphasized, including using analogies, discussing 
statistics, and emphasizing versus de-emphasizing risks. Second, patient 
contextual factors (e.g., comorbidities), hopes, and fears shaped communication. 
Third, clinician communication varied by training, personal style, and 
ambivalence. While clinicians honor patients' choices to pursue treatment, many 
do not "recommend" it (but may recommend against it).
DISCUSSION: Preliminary insights about how clinicians communicate tradeoffs can 
guide future shared decision-making interventions for mAbs.
HIGHLIGHTS: This qualitative study among 27 clinicians across seven academic 
medical centers examined how clinicians communicate with people with Alzheimer's 
disease about risks and benefits of anti-amyloid therapy, which can influence 
treatment decisions.Clinicians varied in what techniques they employed and how 
they portrayed risks and benefits, and whether they incorporated patients' 
values.They cited comorbidities, eligibility criteria fit, and degree of social 
support or family involvement in decisions as factors used in framing 
discussions, while fewer used patients' goals to guide discussion.The 
professional training, individual practice style, and personal sense of 
ambivalence of clinicians shaped conversations.These findings can guide future 
interventions to improve communication and shared decision-making.

Amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition was an important pathomechanisms of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). Aβ generation was highly regulated by beta-site amyloid precursor 
protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), which is a prime drug target for AD therapy. 
The silence of BACE1 function to slow down Aβ production was accepted as an 
effective strategy for combating AD. Herein, BACE1 interfering RNA, 
metallothionein (MT) and ruthenium complexes ([Ru(bpy)2dppz]2+) were all loaded 
in Prussian blue nanoparticles (PRM-siRNA). PRM-siRNA under near-infrared light 
irradiation showed good photothermal effect and triggered instantaneous opening 
of blood-brain barrier (BBB) for enhanced drug delivery. BACE1 siRNA slowed down 
Aβ production and Cu2+ chelation by metallothionein (MT) synergistically 
inhibited Aβ aggregation. Ruthenium (Ru) could real-timely track Aβ degradation 
and aggregation. The results indicated that PRM-siRNA significantly blocked Aβ 
aggregation and attenuated Aβ-induced neurotoxicity and apoptosis in vitro by 
inhibiting ROS-mediated oxidative damage and mitochondrial dysfunction through 
regulating the Bcl-2 family. PRM-siRNA in vivo effectively improved APP/PS1 mice 
learning and memory by alleviating neural loss, neurofibrillary tangles and 
activation of astrocytes and microglial cells in APP/PS1 mice by inhibiting 
BACE1, oxidative damage and tau phosphorylation. Taken together, our findings 
validated that BACE1 siRNA-loaded Prussian blue nanocomplexes showed enhanced 
BBB penetrability and AD synergy therapy.

Numerous therapeutic and culinary species produce scopoletin, a coumarin that is 
essential for treating a wide range of illnesses as a curative and 
chemopreventive agent. Globally, chronic illnesses are regarded as a major 
public health concern. Atypical regulation of various signalling pathways is the 
primary cause of most of these illnesses, which include cancer, as well as 
cardiovascular, metabolic, and neurological disorders. In Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), amyloid β (Aβ) peptide aggregates are deposited in the CNS, forming 
plaques. The investigation assessed the capacity of scopoletin to modify the 
disease to several AD-related factors. It activated the release of insulin in 
the β cell of the pancreas. Additionally, it has been noted that most currently 
approved treatments for these illnesses are mono-targeted and related to the 
development of chemoresistance, which limits their utility and prevents them 
from demonstrating prolonged efficacy. Conversely, the molecules originating 
from plants exhibit a multi-targeted nature, which has led to widespread 
interest in these phytochemicals due to their few adverse effects. The purpose 
of this review is to summarise the possible consequences of scopoletin. An 
outline of scopoletin pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity is given in 
this review. In addition, this chemical is non-toxic and has good 
pharmacokinetic properties, so more research in clinical settings is necessary 
to develop it as a possible medication. The findings from the investigation 
could aid in the prevention and management of illnesses as well as the 
understanding of the benefits of plants containing scopoletin.
