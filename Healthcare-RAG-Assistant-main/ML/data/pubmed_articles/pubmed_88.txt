Alzheimer's disease (AD), as the most common form of dementia and leading cause 
for disability and death in old age, represents a major burden to healthcare 
systems worldwide. For the development of disease-modifying interventions and 
treatments, the detection of cognitive changes at the earliest disease stages is 
crucial. Recent advancements in mobile consumer technologies provide new 
opportunities to collect multi-dimensional data in real-life settings to 
identify and monitor at-risk individuals. Based on evidence showing that 
deficits in spatial navigation are a common hallmark of dementia, we assessed 
whether a memory clinic sample of patients with subjective cognitive decline 
(SCD) who still scored normally on neuropsychological assessments show 
differences in smartphone-assisted wayfinding behavior compared with cognitively 
healthy older and younger adults. Guided by a mobile application, participants 
had to find locations along a short route on the medical campus of the Magdeburg 
university. We show that performance measures that were extracted from GPS and 
user input data distinguish between the groups. In particular, the number of 
orientation stops was predictive of the SCD status in older participants. Our 
data suggest that subtle cognitive changes in patients with SCD, whose risk to 
develop dementia in the future is elevated, can be inferred from smartphone 
data, collected during a brief wayfinding task in the real world.

The genetic basis of severe COVID-19 has been thoroughly studied, and many 
genetic risk factors shared between populations have been identified. However, 
reduced sample sizes from non-European groups have limited the discovery of 
population-specific common risk loci. In this second study nested in the SCOURGE 
consortium, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for COVID-19 
hospitalization in admixed Americans, comprising a total of 4702 hospitalized 
cases recruited by SCOURGE and seven other participating studies in the COVID-19 
Host Genetic Initiative. We identified four genome-wide significant 
associations, two of which constitute novel loci and were first discovered in 
Latin American populations (BAZ2B and DDIAS). A trans-ethnic meta-analysis 
revealed another novel cross-population risk locus in CREBBP. Finally, we 
assessed the performance of a cross-ancestry polygenic risk score in the SCOURGE 
admixed American cohort. This study constitutes the largest GWAS for COVID-19 
hospitalization in admixed Latin Americans conducted to date. This allowed to 
reveal novel risk loci and emphasize the need of considering the diversity of 
populations in genomic research.

BACKGROUND: Pressure injury (PI) is a significant health concern among older 
inpatients, particularly in regions with diverse ethnic populations. 
Understanding the epidemiological characteristics and preventive measures is 
crucial for improving patient outcomes.
PURPOSE: To analyze the epidemiological characteristics, prevention status, and 
influencing factors of pressure injury (PI) in older inpatients of Zhuang and 
Han nationality in Guangxi, China.
METHODS: A total of 2206 inpatients age 60 years or older in 2 class III grade A 
general hospitals in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region between April 1, 2021, 
and May 27, 2021, were included in this cross-sectional study. Epidemiological 
characteristics-including age, sex, educational background, race, ethnicity, and 
hospitalization information-were collected using a general information 
questionnaire designed by the researchers. The PI risk factors were evaluated 
using the Braden Scale. Prevention status was assessed using the Epidemiology 
and Prevention Skin Injuries in the Elderly Scale and Skin Injury Survey Scale.
RESULTS: Of the total 2206 patients included in the study, 555 (25.16%) were of 
Zhuang nationality and 1651 (74.84%) were of Han nationality. The overall PI 
incidence was 2.58%, with PI prevalence of 1.80% and 2.85% in Zhuang and Han 
patients, respectively. The main influencing factor for PI in Zhuang patients 
was caregivers (P < .05), whereas in Han patients the main influencing factors 
were urinary conditions, Alzheimer disease, sedatives, and antihypertensive 
drugs (P < .05).
CONCLUSION: The PI prevalence rates were similar in both ethnic groups. Health 
care staff in high-risk departments for PI must remain vigilant and take 
appropriate action.

INTRODUCTION: As aggregation underpins Tau toxicity, aggregation inhibitor 
peptides may have disease-modifying potential. They are therefore currently 
being designed and target either the 306VQIVYK311 aggregation-promoting hotspot 
found in all Tau isoforms or the 275VQIINK280 aggregation-promoting hotspot 
found in 4R isoforms. However, for any Tau aggregation inhibitor to potentially 
be clinically relevant for other tauopathies, it should target both hotspots to 
suppress aggregation of Tau isoforms, be stable, cross the blood-brain barrier, 
and rescue aggregation-dependent Tau phenotypes in vivo.
METHODS: We developed a retro-inverso, stable D-amino peptide, RI-AG03 
[Ac-rrrrrrrrGpkyk(ac)iqvGr-NH2], based on the 306VQIVYK311 hotspots which 
exhibit these disease-relevant attributes.
RESULTS: Unlike other aggregation inhibitors, RI-AG03 effectively suppresses 
aggregation of multiple Tau species containing both hotspots in vitro and in 
vivo, is non-toxic, and suppresses aggregation-dependent neurodegenerative and 
behavioral phenotypes.
DISCUSSION: RI-AG03 therefore meets many clinically relevant requirements for an 
anti-aggregation Tau therapeutic and should be explored further for its 
disease-modifying potential for Tauopathies.
HIGHLIGHTS: Our manuscript describes the development of a novel peptide 
inhibitor of Tau aggregation, a retro-inverso, stable D-amino peptide called 
RI-AG03 that displays many clinically relevant attributes. We show its efficacy 
in preventing Tau aggregation in both in vitro and in vivo experimental models 
while being non-toxic to cells. RI-AG03 also rescues a biosensor cell line that 
stably expresses Tau repeat domains with the P301S mutation fused to Cer/Clo and 
rescues aggregation-dependent phenotypes in vivo, suppressing neurodegeneration 
and extending lifespan. Collectively our data describe several properties and 
attributes of RI-AG03 that make it a promising disease-modifying candidate to 
explore for reducing pathogenic Tau aggregation in Tauopathies such as 
Alzheimer's disease. Given the real interest in reducing Tau aggregation and the 
potential clinical benefit of using such agents in clinical practice, RI-AG03 
should be investigated further for the treatment of Tauopathies after validation 
in mammalian models. Tau aggregation inhibitors are the obvious first choice as 
Tau-based therapies as much of Tau-mediated toxicity is aggregation dependent. 
Indeed, there are many research efforts focusing on this therapeutic strategy 
with aggregation inhibitors being designed against one of the two 
aggregation-promoting hotspots of the Tau protein. To our knowledge, RI-AG03 is 
the only peptide aggregation inhibitor that inhibits aggregation of Tau by 
targeting both aggregation-promoting hotspot motifs simultaneously. As such, we 
believe that our study will have a significant impact on drug discovery efforts 
in this arena.

The blood-brain barrier (BBB) poses an important obstacle to treating 
neurological disorders because it limits the entry of therapeutic agents into 
the central nervous system (CNS). Surmounting this barrier is crucial for 
delivering drugs effectively and targeting precise areas of the brain affected 
by conditions like Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and brain tumors. 
This review examines the diverse strategies employed to enhance brain targeting, 
including nanotechnology, viral vectors, and biological therapies. 
Nanoparticles, liposomes, and dendrimers offer promising approaches for 
encapsulating drugs and facilitating their transport across the BBB. Viral 
vectors, such as adeno-associated viruses, demonstrate high transfection 
efficiency for gene therapy applications in CNS diseases. Biological therapies, 
including stem cell transplantation and neuromodulation techniques, can 
potentially restore normal cellular function and treat genetic disorders. 
Challenges such as BBB permeability, safety concerns, and regulatory 
considerations are discussed, along with future perspectives on precision 
medicine, noninvasive delivery methods, and biomarker discovery. By addressing 
these challenges and embracing innovative approaches, the field of brain drug 
targeting aims to transfer the way that neurological illness is treated and 
improve patient outcomes.

Targeting acetylcholinesterase is one of the most important strategies for 
developing therapeutics against Alzheimer's disease. In this work, we have 
employed a new approach that combines machine learning models, a multi-step 
similarity search of the PubChem library and molecular dynamics simulations to 
investigate potential inhibitors for acetylcholinesterase. Our search strategy 
has been shown to significantly enrich the set of compounds with strong 
predicted binding affinity to acetylcholinesterase. Both machine learning 
prediction and binding free energy calculation, based on linear interaction 
energy, suggest that the compound CID54414454 would bind strongly to 
acetylcholinesterase and hence is a promising inhibitor.

Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) pose substantial 
challenges to patients and health-care systems, particularly in countries with 
aging populations. Immunotherapies, including the marketed antibodies lecanemab 
(Leqembi®) and donanemab (KisunlaTM), offer promise but face hurdles due to 
limited delivery across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This limitation 
necessitates high doses, resulting in increased costs and a higher risk of side 
effects. This study explores transferrin receptor (TfR)-binding camelid 
single-domain antibodies (VHHs) for facilitated brain delivery. We developed and 
evaluated fusion proteins (FPs) combining VHHs with human IgG Fc domains or 
single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) of the anti-amyloid-beta (Aβ) antibody 
3D6. In vitro assessments showed varying affinities of the FPs for TfR. In vivo 
evaluations indicated that specific VHH-Fc and VHH-scFv fusions reached 
significant brain concentrations, emphasizing the importance of optimal TfR 
binding affinities. The VHH-scFv fusions were further investigated in mouse 
models with Aβ pathology, showing higher retention compared to wild-type mice 
without Aβ pathology. Our findings suggest that these novel VHH-based FPs hold 
potential for therapeutic and diagnostic applications in AD, providing a 
strategy to overcome BBB limitations and enhance brain targeting of 
antibody-based treatments. Furthermore, our results suggest that a given 
bispecific TfR-binding fusion format has a window of "optimal" affinity where 
parenchymal delivery is adequate, while blood pharmacokinetics aligns with the 
desired application of the fusion protein.

BACKGROUND: Recent advances in blood-based biomarker discovery are paving the 
way for simpler, more accessible diagnostic tools that can detect early signs of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent successes in the development of 
amyloid-targeting immunotherapy approaches mark an important advancement in 
providing new options for the treatment of AD. We have developed a set of 
high-affinity monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to tau protein that have the 
potential as tools for diagnosis and treatment of AD.
METHODS: Sheep were immunised with either full-length tau (1-441) or truncated 
paired helical filament (PHF)-core tau (297-391). A stringent bio-panning and 
epitope selection strategy, with a particular focus directed to epitopes within 
the disease-relevant PHF-core tau, was used to identify single-chain antibodies 
(scAbs). These scAbs were ranked by affinity for each epitope class, with leads 
converted to high-affinity mAbs. These antibodies and their potential utility 
were assessed by their performance in tau immunoassays, as well as their ability 
to prevent tau aggregation and propagation. Further characterisation of these 
antibodies was performed by immunohistochemical staining of brain sections and 
immuno-gold electronmicroscopy of isolated PHFs.
RESULTS: Our work resulted in a set of high-affinity antibodies reacting with 
multiple epitopes spanning the entire tau protein molecule. The tau antibodies 
directed against the core tau unit of the PHF inhibited pathological aggregation 
and seeding using several biochemical and cell assay systems. Through staining 
of brain sections and PHFs, the panel of antibodies revealed which tau epitopes 
were available, truncated, or occluded. In addition, highly sensitive 
immunoassays were developed with the ability to distinguish between and quantify 
various tau fragments.
CONCLUSION: This article introduces an alternative immunodiagnostic approach 
based on the concept of a "tauosome" - the diverse set of tau fragments present 
within biological fluids. The development of an antibody panel that can 
distinguish a range of different tau fragments provides the basis for a novel 
approach to potential diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression. Our 
results further support the notion that tau immunotherapy targeting the PHF-core 
needs to combine appropriate selection of both the target epitope and antibody 
affinity to optimise therapeutic potential.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder with a 
global impact, yet its pathogenesis remains poorly understood. While age, 
metabolic abnormalities, and accumulation of neurotoxic substances are potential 
risk factors for AD, their effects are confounded by other factors. To address 
this challenge, we first utilized multi-omics data from 87 well phenotyped AD 
patients and generated plasma proteomics and metabolomics data, as well as gut 
and saliva metagenomics data to investigate the molecular-level alterations 
accounting the host-microbiome interactions. Second, we analyzed individual 
omics data and identified the key parameters involved in the severity of the 
dementia in AD patients. Next, we employed Artificial Intelligence (AI) based 
models to predict AD severity based on the significantly altered features 
identified in each omics analysis. Based on our integrative analysis, we found 
the clinical relevance of plasma proteins, including SKAP1 and NEFL, plasma 
metabolites including homovanillate and glutamate, and Paraprevotella clara in 
gut microbiome in predicting the AD severity. Finally, we validated the 
predictive power of our AI based models by generating additional multi-omics 
data from the same group of AD patients by following up for 3 months. Hence, we 
observed that these results may have important implications for the development 
of potential diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for AD patients.

BACKGROUND: Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists are a viable option for 
the prevention of Alzheimer's disease (AD) but the mechanisms of this potential 
disease modifying action are unclear. We investigated the effects of once-weekly 
exenatide (EQW) on AD associated proteomic clusters.
METHODS: The Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering study compared the 
cardiovascular effects of EQW 2 mg with placebo in 13,752 people with type 2 
diabetes mellitus. 4,979 proteins were measured (Somascan V0.4) on baseline and 
1-year plasma samples of 3,973 participants. C-reactive protein (CRP), ficolin-2 
(FCN2), plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), soluble vascular cell 
adhesion protein 1 (sVCAM1) and 4 protein clusters were tested in multivariable 
mixed models.
RESULTS: EQW affected FCN2 (Cohen's d -0.019), PAI-1 (Cohen's d -0.033), sVCAM-1 
(Cohen's d 0.035) and a cytokine-cytokine cluster (Cohen's d 0.037) 
significantly compared with placebo. These effects were sustained in individuals 
over the age of 65 but not in those under 65.
CONCLUSIONS: EQW treatment was associated with significant change in 
inflammatory proteins associated with AD.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: EXSCEL is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01144338 on

BACKGROUND: The approval of lecanemab, an anti-amyloid therapy for Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), necessitates addressing healthcare preparedness for 
disease-modifying treatment (DMT) to ensure appropriate, safe, and sustainable 
drug administration. Understanding public perceptions on this matter is crucial. 
We aimed to assess discrepancies and similarities in the perceptions of Japanese 
trial-ready cohort study ('J-TRC webstudy') participants and clinical 
specialists in the fields of dementia treatment and radiology, concerning 
affairs related to challenges in DMT preparedness.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional prospective observational study conducted in 
November-December 2023. The J-TRC webstudy participants were invited to 
participate in an online survey using Google Forms, and clinical specialists 
were invited to complete a mail-based survey. Main questionnaire items had been 
designed to be common in both surveys, and their responses were analyzed for 
participant attributes, interests, attitudes, expectations, and concerns about 
DMTs without specifying lecanemab.
RESULTS: Responses were obtained from n = 2,050 J-TRC webstudy participants and 
n = 1,518 clinical specialists. Compared to specialists, more J-TRC respondents 
perceived the eligible proportion for DMT as smaller (59.1% versus 30.7%), 
perceived the eligible severity for DMT as more limited (58.0% versus 24.5%), 
and perceived the efficacy of DMT as slightly more encouraging (29.3% versus 
34.8%). In terms of treatment prioritization, both J-TRC respondents and 
specialist respondents exhibited similar levels of acceptance for prioritizing 
patients to treat: e.g., approximately two-thirds endorsed patient 
prioritization under hypothetical resource constraints or other reasons. A 
medical rationale emerged as the most compelling reason for acceptance of 
patient prioritization across the surveys. In contrast, the need to address 
vulnerable populations was the reason that led to the least acceptance of 
prioritization, followed by economic considerations.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings offer valuable insights into the discrepancies in 
knowledge and perception between patients and healthcare providers. This could 
enhance the delivery of patient information in clinical settings and inform the 
discussion surrounding patient prioritization strategies.

Spastic paraplegia 47 (SPG47) is a neurological disorder caused by mutations in 
the adaptor protein complex 4 β1 subunit (AP4B1) gene leading to AP-4 complex 
deficiency. SPG47 is characterised by progressive spastic paraplegia, global 
developmental delay, intellectual disability and epilepsy. Gene therapy aimed at 
restoring functional AP4B1 protein levels is a rational therapeutic strategy to 
ameliorate the disease phenotype. Here we report that a single delivery of 
adeno-associated virus serotype 9 expressing hAP4B1 (AAV9/hAP4B1) into the 
cisterna magna leads to widespread gene transfer and restoration of various 
hallmarks of disease, including AP-4 cargo (ATG9A) mislocalisation, 
calbindin-positive spheroids in the deep cerebellar nuclei, anatomical brain 
defects and motor dysfunction, in an SPG47 mouse model. Furthermore, 
AAV9/hAP4B1-based gene therapy demonstrated a restoration of plasma 
neurofilament light (NfL) levels of treated mice. Encouraged by these 
preclinical proof-of-concept data, we conducted IND-enabling studies, including 
immunogenicity and GLP non-human primate (NHP) toxicology studies. Importantly, 
NHP safety and biodistribution study revealed no significant adverse events 
associated with the therapeutic intervention. These findings provide evidence of 
both therapeutic efficacy and safety, establishing a robust basis for the 
pursuit of an IND application for clinical trials targeting SPG47 patients.

BACKGROUND: The tauopathy inhibitor, davunetide shows sex-dependent efficacy in 
women suffering from progressive supranuclear palsy. Extending these findings to 
prodromal Alzheimer's disease, we submitted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
12 weeks/16 weeks follow-up, davunetide clinical trial results in amnestic mild 
cognitive impairment (ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT00422981), to a sex-dependent 
analysis.
METHODS: One hundred forty-four individuals, separated into eight groups (1:2 
placebo-and 2 doses, 5 mg davunetide/daily or 15 mg davunetide/twice-daily, with 
matching placebo intranasal volumes), were evaluated.
RESULTS: Significant dose-dependent cognitive increases were observed in men 
compared to women with a test of delayed (12 ss) visual matching to the sample. 
In a test of semantic working memory and attention (digit span), women showed a 
significant low-dose placebo effect, ensuing in a high dose significant 
davunetide improvement, over the matched placebo. Correlating anxiety with 
cognition showed sex-opposing results, with women depicting significant anxiety 
correlations with delayed matching to sample.
DISCUSSION: In conclusion, sex-specific prodromal Alzheimer's drug development 
is encouraged, with davunetide playing a lead initiative role.

Individuals at clinical high-risk (CHR) of developing psychosis, as well as 
patients with recent psychosis onset (RO), experience significant negative 
symptoms that detrimentally impact daily-life functioning and are associated 
with poor outcomes, even in those who do not convert to psychosis. Targeting 
negative symptoms may thus hold promise for the treatment of CHR and RO 
patients. Building from previous findings we examined whether the 
catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) Val158Met functional polymorphism and 
fasting peripheral proline concentration predicts the severity of negative 
symptoms experienced by adolescents and young adults at CHR or those with RO. As 
hypothesized, the interaction between fasting plasma proline and COMT predicted 
negative symptoms, as measured via the Scale for the Assessment of Negative 
Symptoms (SANS) total (n = 50, β = 0.066, adjusted p = 0.007) and global 
severity scores (n = 50, coefficient = 0.026, adjusted p = 0.003): Higher 
proline was beneficial for Val/Val subjects, but detrimental to those with the 
Met allele. In a secondary analysis, the COMT x proline interaction also 
predicted symptoms measured via the Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative 
Symptoms (CAINS) total scores (n = 50, β-coefficient = 0.035, adjusted 
p = 0.044), although this result did not reach the Benjamini-Hochberg's 
threshold for significance. Further, there was a trend towards significance for 
an association with social and interpersonal function (Global 
Functioning-Social, coefficient = -0.005, adjusted p = 0.055). Negative symptoms 
are intractable and largely unaddressed by current medications. This study 
further supports a relationship between peripheral proline and COMT influencing 
negative symptoms such as anhedonia, in young CHR individuals and those with RO. 
That higher proline has converse effects on symptoms by COMT may have 
implications for the development of therapeutics to intervene early and 
specifically target the interaction pathway.

Depression is a common and complex psychiatric illness with multiple clinical 
symptoms, even leading to the disability and suicide. Owing to the partial 
understanding of the pathogenesis of depressive-like disorders, available 
pharmacotherapeutic strategies are developed mainly based on the "monoamine 
hypothesis", resulting in a limited effectiveness and a number of adverse 
effects in the clinical practice. The concept of multiple pathogenic factors be 
helpful for clarifying the etiology of depression and developing the 
antidepressants. It is well documented that K+ channels serve crucial roles in 
modulating the neuronal excitability and neurotransmitter release in the brain, 
and abnormality of these channels participated in the pathogenic process of 
diverse central nervous system (CNS) pathologies, such as seizure and 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). The clinical and preclinical evidence also delineates 
that the involvement of several types of K+ channels in depressive-like 
behaviors appear to be evident, suggesting these channels being one of the 
multiple factors in the etiology of this debilitating disorder. Emerging data 
manifest that diverse antidepressants impact distinct K+ channels, such as Kv, 
Kir and K2P, meaning the functioning of these drug via a "multi-target" manner. 
On the other hand, the scenario of antidepressants impinging K+ channels could 
render an alternative interpretation for the pharmacological effectiveness and 
numerous side effects in clinical trials. Furthermore, these channels serve to 
be considered as a "druggable target" to develop novel therapeutic compound to 
antagonize this psychiatry.

Reciprocal communication between the brain and the immune system is essential 
for maintaining lifelong brain function. This interaction is mediated, at least 
in part, by immune cells recruited from both the circulation and niches at the 
borders of the brain. Here, we describe how immune exhaustion and senescence, 
even if not primary causative factors, can accelerate neurodegenerative 
diseases. We emphasize the role of a compromised peripheral immune system in 
driving neurodegeneration and discuss strategies for harnessing peripheral 
immunity to effectively treat neurodegenerative diseases, including the 
underlying mechanisms and opportunities for clinical translation. Specifically, 
we highlight the potential of boosting the immune system by blocking inhibitory 
checkpoint molecules to harness reparative immune cells in helping the brain to 
fight against neurodegeneration.

Homocysteine (Hcy) is produced through methionine transmethylation. Elevated Hcy 
levels are termed Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) and represent a risk factor for 
neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. This study aimed to 
explore the impact of mild HHcy and the neuroprotective effects of ibuprofen and 
rivastigmine via immunohistochemical analysis of glial markers (Iba-1 and GFAP). 
Additionally, we assessed levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), 
epidermal growth factor (EGF), chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5/RANTES), CX3C chemokine 
ligand 1 (CX3CL1), and the NGF/p75NTR/tropomyosin kinase B (TrkB) pathway in the 
hippocampus of adult rats. Mild chronic HHcy was induced chemically in Wistar 
rats by subcutaneous administration of Hcy (4 mg/kg body weight) twice daily for 
30 days. Rivastigmine (0.5 mg/kg) and ibuprofen (40 mg/kg) were administered 
intraperitoneally once daily. Results revealed elevated levels of CCL5/RANTES 
and reduced levels of VEGF, EGF, and TrkB in the hippocampus of HHcy-exposed 
rats. Rivastigmine mitigated the neurotoxic effects of HHcy by increasing TrkB 
and VEGF levels. Conversely, ibuprofen attenuated CCL5/RANTES levels against the 
neurotoxicity of HHcy, significantly reducing this chemokine's levels. 
HHcy-induced neurochemical impairment in the hippocampus may jeopardize 
neurogenesis, synapse formation, axonal transport, and inflammatory balance, 
leading to neurodegeneration. Treatments with rivastigmine and ibuprofen 
alleviated some of these detrimental effects. Reversing HHcy-induced damage 
through these compounds could serve as a potential neuroprotective strategy 
against brain damage.

The incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has increased in our society in 
recent decades as the population ages, and this trend is not expected to revert. 
This is the same for the incidence of the main neurodegenerative disorders, 
including the two most common ones, which are, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's 
disease. Currently, no pharmacological therapies have been developed to revert 
or cure any of these pathologies. Interestingly, in recent years, an increased 
number of studies have shown a high co-morbidity between T2DM and 
neurodegeneration, as well as some common molecular pathways that are affected 
in both types of diseases. For example, while the etiopathology of T2DM and 
neurodegenerative disorders is highly complex, mitochondrial dysfunction has 
been broadly described in the early steps of both diseases; accordingly, this 
dysfunction has emerged as a plausible molecular link between them. In fact, the 
prominent role played by mitochondria in the mammalian metabolism of glucose 
places the physiology of the organelle in a central position to regulate many 
cellular processes that are affected in both T2DM and neurodegenerative 
disorders. In this collaborative review, we critically describe the relationship 
between T2DM and neurodegeneration; making a special emphasis on the 
mitochondrial mechanisms that could link these diseases. A better understanding 
of the role of mitochondria on the etiopathology of T2DM and neurodegeneration 
could pave the way for the development of new pharmacological therapies focused 
on the regulation of the physiology of the organelle. These therapies could, 
ultimately, contribute to increase healthspan.

OBJECTIVE: Complex diseases exhibit heterogeneous progression patterns, 
necessitating effective capture and clustering of longitudinal changes to 
identify disease subtypes for personalized treatments. However, existing studies 
often fail to design clustering-specific representations or neglect clinical 
outcomes, thereby limiting the interpretability and clinical utility.
METHOD: We design a unified framework for subtyping longitudinal progressive 
diseases. We focus on effectively integrating all data from disease progressions 
and improving patient representation for downstream clustering. Specifically, we 
propose a clinical Outcome-Guided Deep Temporal Clustering (OG-DTC) that 
generates representations informed by clustering and clinical outcomes. A 
GRU-based seq2seq architecture captures the temporal dynamics, and the model 
integrates k-means clustering and outcome regression to facilitate the formation 
of clustering structures and the integration of clinical outcomes. The learned 
representations are clustered using a Gaussian mixture model to identify 
distinct subtypes. The clustering results are extensively validated through 
reproducibility, stability, and significance tests.
RESULTS: We demonstrated the efficacy of our framework by applying it to three 
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) clinical trials. Through the AD case study, we 
identified three distinct subtypes with unique patterns associated with 
differentiated clinical declines across multiple measures. The ablation study 
revealed the contributions of each component in the model and showed that 
jointly optimizing the full model improved patient representations for 
clustering. Extensive validations showed that the derived clustering is 
reproducible, stable, and significant.
CONCLUSION: Our temporal clustering framework can derive robust clustering 
applicable for subtyping longitudinal progressive diseases and has the potential 
to account for subtype variability in clinical outcomes.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Growing evidence suggests nutritional intervention may 
influence the development and progression of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Choline, 
an essential dietary nutrient plays a critical role in neurological development 
and brain function, however, its effects on AD in humans is unclear. The 
research aims to investigate mechanistic links between dietary choline intake 
and cognitive functioning, focusing on the role of phosphatidylcholine (PC) in 
neuroplasticity and its interaction with amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides in neuron 
membranes. Additionally, human evidence on the potential benefits of PC 
interventions on AD, cognition, and proposed mechanisms are evaluated.
METHODS: A reproducible systematic literature search was performed using a 
three-tranche strategy, consisting of a review, mechanism, and intervention 
search. Using PubMed as the main database, 1254 titles and abstracts were 
screened, 149 papers were read in full and 65 peer-reviewed papers were 
accepted, critically appraised, and analysed in a narrative review.
RESULTS: Predominantly preclinical evidence demonstrated that PC enhances 
neuroplasticity, a key biological substrate for cognition, by activating 
intracellular neuronal signalling pathways or through neuron membrane function. 
Molecular dynamic simulation methods provided a mechanistic understanding of the 
interconnection between neuronal PC content and the potential behaviour and 
trajectory of Aβ peptide aggregation. The results indicate that the neuronal 
membrane composition of PC is critical to inhibiting Aβ aggregation and neuronal 
damage, protecting the neuron from Aβ toxicity. This might provide a foundation 
for optimising cellular PC which may prove beneficial in the treatment or 
prevention of neurodegenerative disease. Altered PC metabolism in AD was 
evidenced in observational studies; however, whether this relationship 
represents a cause or consequence of AD remains to be determined. Human 
intervention studies did not produce conclusive evidence supporting its 
effectiveness in enhancing cognitive function. This lack of consistency 
primarily stems from methodological constraints within the conducted studies. 
Human observational research provided the most compelling evidence linking a 
higher dietary PC intake to a reduced risk of dementia and significant 
improvements in cognitive testing.
CONCLUSION: Despite the lack of randomised control trials (RCTs) assessing the 
efficacy of lecithin/PC to improve cognition in AD patients, there exists 
promising evidence supporting its neuroprotective and neurotrophic role. This 
review establishes an evidence-based framework through chains of mechanistic 
evidence, that may provide potential strategies for enhanced neuroprotection and 
reduced neurodegeneration caused by AD. Considering the escalating global burden 
of AD and the current shortcomings in effective treatments, this review together 
with the limitations and gaps identified in the existing research presents 
valuable insights that emphasise the urgency of more comprehensive research into 
the relationship between PC and AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex disorder that is influenced by a number of 
variables, such as age, gender, environmental factors, disease, lifestyle, 
infections, and many more. The main characteristic of AD is the formation of 
amyloid plaque and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), which are caused by various 
reasons such as inflammation, impairment of neurotransmitters, 
hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, generation of toxic amyloid beta (Aβ) 
40/42, oxidative stress, etc. Protein kinases located in chromosome 21, namely 
dual-specific tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A), play an 
essential role in the pathogenesis of AD. DYRK1A stimulates the Aβ peptide 
aggregation and phosphorylation of tau protein to generate the NFT formation 
that causes neurodegeneration. Thus, DYRK1A is associated with AD, and 
inhibition of DYRK1A has the potential to treat AD. In this review, we discussed 
the pathophysiology of AD, various factors responsible for AD, and the role of 
DYRK1A in AD. We have also discussed the latest therapeutic potential of DYRK1A 
inhibitors for neurogenerative disease, along with their structure-activity 
relationship (SAR) studies. This article provides valuable information for 
guiding the future discovery of novel and target-specific DYRK1A inhibitors over

Alzheimer's disease is a complex neurodegenerative condition characterized by 
the accumulation of amyloid beta plaques, leading to memory loss, cognitive 
decline, and impaired autonomous behavior. Despite extensive research, an 
effective treatment remains elusive. The buildup of amyloid beta plaques (Aβ42) 
in the brain causes oxidative stress and disrupts normal molecular signaling, 
adversely affecting neuron function. Previous research has identified factors 
that can either exacerbate or mitigate neurodegenerative diseases. Our study 
aimed to uncover new factors involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's 
disease. Using Drosophila as a model organism, we employed the Gal4/UAS system 
to express human Aβ42 in the flies' retinal neurons which led to 
neurodegenerative changes in their compound eyes. To identify genetic modifiers, 
we conducted a screen by co-expressing microRNAs and found that miR-282 acts as 
a suppressor. Overexpressing miR-282 in the GMR > Aβ42 background reduced 
Aβ42-induced neurodegeneration. Further analysis using prediction tools and RNA 
interference experiments identified three potential downstream targets of 
miR-282: calpain-B, knot, and scabrous. Downregulating these genes via RNA 
interference in the GMR > Aβ42 background mitigated neurodegeneration. Our 
research highlights miR-282 as a novel molecule that may influence the 
progression of Alzheimer's disease, offering potential avenues for future 
therapeutic or diagnostic developments.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) represents one of the most significant 
neurodegenerative challenges of our time, with its increasing prevalence and the 
lack of curative treatments underscoring an urgent need for innovative 
therapeutic strategies. Stem cells (SCs) therapy emerges as a promising 
frontier, offering potential mechanisms for neuroregeneration, neuroprotection, 
and disease modification in AD. This article provides a comprehensive overview 
of the current landscape and future directions of stem cell therapy in AD 
treatment, addressing key aspects such as stem cell migration, differentiation, 
paracrine effects, and mitochondrial translocation. Despite the promising 
therapeutic mechanisms of SCs, translating these findings into clinical 
applications faces substantial hurdles, including production scalability, 
quality control, ethical concerns, immunogenicity, and regulatory challenges. 
Furthermore, we delve into emerging trends in stem cell modification and 
application, highlighting the roles of genetic engineering, biomaterials, and 
advanced delivery systems. Potential solutions to overcome translational 
barriers are discussed, emphasizing the importance of interdisciplinary 
collaboration, regulatory harmonization, and adaptive clinical trial designs. 
The article concludes with reflections on the future of stem cell therapy in AD, 
balancing optimism with a pragmatic recognition of the challenges ahead. As we 
navigate these complexities, the ultimate goal remains to translate stem cell 
research into safe, effective, and accessible treatments for AD, heralding a new 
era in the fight against this devastating disease.

Corticobasal degeneration (CBD) is a major four-repeat tauopathy along with 
progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Although detergent-insoluble 37-40-kDa 
carboxyl-terminal tau fragments (CTFs) are hallmarks of CBD pathology, the 
process of their formation is unknown. This study monitored the formation of 
CBD-type fibrils that exhibit astrocytic plaques, a characteristic CBD 
pathology, using its biochemical properties different from those of Alzheimer's 
disease/PSP-type fibrils. Tau fibrils from patients with CBD were amplified in 
non-astrocytic cultured cells, which maintained CBD-specific biochemical 
properties. We found that the lysosomal protease Legumain (LGMN) was involved in 
the generation of CBD-specific 37-40-kDa CTFs. While LGMN cleaved tau fibrils at 
Asn167 and Asn368 in the brain tissues of patients with Alzheimer's disease and 
PSP, tau fibrils from patients with CBD were predominantly resistant to cleavage 
at Asn368 by LGMN, resulting in the generation of CBD-specific CTFs. LGMN 
preference in tau fibrils was lost upon unraveling the tau fibril fold, 
suggesting that the CBD-specific tau fibril fold contributes to CBD-specific CTF 
production. From these findings, we found a way to differentiate astrocytic 
plaque from tufted astrocyte using the anti-Asn368 LGMN cleavage site-specific 
antibody. Inoculation of tau fibrils amplified in non-astrocytic cells into the 
mouse brain reproduced LGMN-resistant tau fibrils and recapitulated 
anti-Asn368-negative astrocytic plaques, which are characteristic of CBD 
pathology. This study supports the existence of disease-specific tau fibrils and 
contribute to further understanding of the tauopathy diagnosis. Our tau 
propagation mouse model using cellular tau seeds may contribute to uncovering 
disease mechanisms and screening for potential therapeutic compounds.

Abnormal accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau (pTau) is a major cause of 
neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related tauopathies. 
Therefore, reducing pTau holds therapeutic promise for these diseases. Here, we 
developed a chimeric peptide, named D20, for selective facilitation of tau 
dephosphorylation by recruiting protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) to tau. PP1 is one 
of the active phosphatases that dephosphorylates tau. In both cultured primary 
hippocampal neurons and mouse models for AD or related tauopathies, we 
demonstrated that single-dose D20 treatment significantly reduced pTau by 
dephosphorylation at multiple AD-related sites and total tau (tTau) levels were 
also decreased. Multiple-dose administration of D20 through tail vein injection 
in 3xTg AD mice effectively ameliorated tau-associated pathologies with improved 
cognitive functions. Importantly, at therapeutic doses, D20 did not cause 
detectable toxicity in cultured neurons, neural cells, or peripheral organs in 
mice. These results suggest that D20 is a promising drug candidate for AD and 
related tauopathies.

The strongest risk factors for late-onset sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
include the ε4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE), the R47H variant of triggering 
receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), and female sex. Here, we combine 
APOE4 and TREM2R47H (R47H) in female P301S tauopathy mice to identify the 
pathways activated when AD risk is the strongest, thereby highlighting 
detrimental disease mechanisms. We find that R47H induces neurodegeneration in 
9- to 10-month-old female APOE4 tauopathy mice. The combination of APOE4 and 
R47H (APOE4-R47H) worsened hyperphosphorylated tau pathology in the frontal 
cortex and amplified tauopathy-induced microglial cyclic guanosine monophosphate 
(GMP)-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling and 
downstream interferon response. APOE4-R47H microglia displayed cGAS- and 
BAX-dependent upregulation of senescence, showing association between neurotoxic 
signatures and implicating mitochondrial permeabilization in pathogenesis. By 
uncovering pathways enhanced by the strongest AD risk factors, our study points 
to cGAS-STING signaling and associated microglial senescence as potential 
drivers of AD risk.

It has been suggested that the diagnostic landscape of Alzheimer disease (AD) is 
undergoing a profound transformation, marked by a shift toward a biomarker-based 
approach, as proposed by the Revised Criteria for Diagnosis and Staging of 
Alzheimer's Disease. These criteria advocate for diagnosing AD solely on 
biomarkers, without requiring clinical symptoms. This article explores the 
drivers behind this transition, primarily influenced by the Food and Drug 
Administration's approval of amyloid-lowering treatments. We evaluate the 
proposed criteria, which allow for an AD diagnosis based on amyloid "A" or 
phosphorylated tau "T1" positivity through surrogate amyloid PET imaging, CSF, 
or plasma biomarkers, and consider the arguments for and against their use. The 
merits of the new criteria include a clearer definition of AD, which is 
currently used interchangeably to refer to both the presence of neuropathology 
and the clinical syndrome. We argue that a purely biological definition risks a 
category error and emphasize the need for longitudinal data to establish the 
lifetime risk of dementia in amyloid-positive and tau-positive individuals. We 
also caution against limiting the scope of biomarker-based AD diagnosis to 
amyloid and tau alone. In conclusion, we recommend that the criteria remain 
within the research domain for the present while advocating for the considered 
adoption of plasma biomarkers in clinical practice.

The accumulation of abnormal protein deposits known as amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques 
contributes to the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease. 
Aggregated Aβ exacerbates oxidative stress by stimulating the production of 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a detrimental feedback loop. 8-Hydroxyquinoline 
(8-HQ) is recognized for its ability to inhibit or reverse Aβ aggregation and 
reduce neurotoxicity. Here, an 8-HQ-based polymer, DHQ, was developed to combat 
Aβ-mediated neurotoxicity by delivering an antioxidant enzyme. DHQ efficiently 
delivers superoxide dismutase into targeted cells, thereby downregulating the 
intracellular ROS level. Additionally, the polymer effectively inhibits the 
fibrillization of three proteins involved in fibrosis, β-lactoglobulin (BLG), 
insulin, and Aβ1-40, at nanomolar concentrations. Cell culture models 
demonstrated that DHQ reduces ROS levels induced by Aβ1-40 aggregation, rescuing 
cell viability and preventing apoptosis. Intracellular delivery of SOD further 
enhanced the ability to maintain the ROS homeostasis. This polymer offers a 
multifaceted approach to treating diseases associated with amyloidosis.

guideline for the management of adult overweight and obesity. The target 
audiences are interdisciplinary healthcare professionals across healthcare 
systems who are the first point of contact for patients with obesity in Mexico, 
patients, and health system decision makers.
RECENT FINDINGS: A review of recent international obesity clinical practice 
guidelines and an expert consensus process identified: i) common recommendations 
appropriate for implementation in Mexico and ii) knowledge gaps requiring the 
formulation of new recommendations. In all, 20 new recommendations and 20 good 
practice statements were developed using the GRADE Evidence-to-Decision 
Framework and expert consensus. Overweight and obesity negatively impact the 
health and well-being of individuals and populations in Mexico. This guideline 
aims to establish a new evidence-based, patient-centered, non-stigmatizing, and 
practical treatment and management framework, based on the fundamental 
principles of chronic disease prevention and management.

INTRODUCTION: Transposable element (TE) dysregulation is associated with 
neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains. Yet, TE quantitative trait 
loci (teQTL) have not been well characterized in human aged brains with AD.
METHODS: We leveraged large-scale bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing, 
whole-genome sequencing (WGS), and xQTL from three human AD brain biobanks to 
characterize TE expression dysregulation and experimentally validate 
AD-associated TEs using CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) assays in human induced 
pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons.
RESULTS: We identified 26,188 genome-wide significant TE expression QTLs 
(teQTLs) in human aged brains. Subsequent colocalization analysis of teQTLs with 
AD genetic loci identified AD-associated teQTLs and linked locus TEs. Using 
CRISPRi assays, we pinpointed a neuron-specific suppressive role of the 
activated short interspersed nuclear element (SINE; chr11:47608036-47608220) on 
expression of C1QTNF4 via reducing neuroinflammation in human iPSC-derived 
neurons.
DISCUSSION: We identified widespread TE dysregulation in human AD brains and 
teQTLs offer a complementary analytic approach to identify likely AD risk genes.
HIGHLIGHTS: Widespread transposable element (TE) dysregulations are observed in 
human aging brains with degrees of neuropathology, apolipoprotein E (APOE) 
genotypes, and neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease (AD). A catalog of TE 
quantitative trait loci (teQTLs) in human aging brains was created using matched 
RNA sequencing and whole-genome sequencing data. CRISPR interference assays 
reveal that an upregulated intergenic TE from the MIR family (chr11: 
47608036-47608220) suppresses expression of its nearest anti-inflammatory gene 
C1QTNF4 in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease 
characterized by progressive decline in cognitive function, which significantly 
increases pain and social burden. However, few therapeutic interventions are 
effective in preventing or mitigating the progression of AD. An increasing 
number of recent studies support the hypothesis that the gut microbiome and its 
metabolites may be associated with upstream regulators of AD pathology.
METHODS: In this review, we comprehensively explore the potential mechanisms and 
currently available interventions targeting the microbiome for the improvement 
of AD. Our discussion is structured around modern research advancements in AD, 
the bidirectional communication between the gut and brain, the multi-target 
regulatory effects of microbial metabolites on AD, and therapeutic strategies 
aimed at modulating gut microbiota to manage AD.
RESULTS: The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of AD 
through continuous bidirectional communication via the microbiota-gut-brain 
axis. Among these, microbial metabolites such as lipids, amino acids, bile acids 
and neurotransmitters, especially sphingolipids and phospholipids, may serve as 
central components of the gut-brain axis, regulating AD-related pathogenic 
mechanisms including β-amyloid metabolism, Tau protein phosphorylation, and 
neuroinflammation. Additionally, interventions such as probiotic administration, 
fecal microbiota transplantation, and antibiotic use have also provided evidence 
supporting the association between gut microbiota and AD. At the same time, we 
propose an innovative strategy for treating AD: a healthy lifestyle combined 
with targeted probiotics and other potential therapeutic interventions, aiming 
to restore intestinal ecology and microbiota balance.
CONCLUSION: Despite previous efforts, the molecular mechanisms by which gut 
microbes act on AD have yet to be fully described. However, intestinal 
microorganisms may become an essential target for connecting the gut-brain axis 
and improving the symptoms of AD. At the same time, it requires joint 
exploration by multiple centers and multiple disciplines.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative condition, stands as 
the most prevalent form of dementia. Its complex pathological mechanisms and the 
formidable blood-brain barrier (BBB) pose significant challenges to current 
treatment approaches. Oxidative stress is recognized as a central factor in AD, 
underscoring the importance of antioxidative strategies in its treatment. In 
this study, we developed a novel brain-targeted nanoparticle, Ce/Zr-MOF@Cur-Lf, 
for AD therapy.
METHODS: Layer-by-layer self-assembly technology was used to prepare 
Ce/Zr-MOF@Cur-Lf. In addition, the effect on the intracellular reactive oxygen 
species level, the uptake effect by PC12 and bEnd.3 cells and the in vitro BBB 
permeation effect were investigated. Finally, the mouse AD model was established 
by intrahippocampal injection of Aβ1-42, and the in vivo biodistribution, AD 
therapeutic effect and biosafety of the nanoparticles were researched at the 
animal level.
RESULTS: As anticipated, Ce/Zr-MOF@Cur-Lf demonstrated efficient BBB penetration 
and uptake by PC12 cells, leading to attenuation of H2O2-induced oxidative 
damage. Moreover, intravenous administration of Ce/Zr-MOF@Cur-Lf resulted in 
rapid brain access and improvement of various pathological features of AD, 
including neuronal damage, amyloid-β deposition, dysregulated central 
cholinergic system, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation.
CONCLUSION: Overall, Ce/Zr-MOF@Cur-Lf represents a promising approach for 
precise brain targeting and multi-target mechanisms in AD therapy, potentially 
serving as a viable option for future clinical treatment.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
pathologically characterized by the deposition of amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques and 
neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the brain. The accumulation of these 
aggregated proteins causes memory and synaptic dysfunction, neuroinflammation, 
and oxidative stress. This research study is significant as it aims to assess 
the neuroprotective properties of vitamin E (VE) analog Trolox in an Aβ1 - 
42-induced AD mouse model. Aβ1 - 42 5μL/5min/mouse was injected 
intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) into wild-type adult mice brain to induce 
AD-like neurotoxicity. For biochemical analysis, Western blotting and confocal 
microscopy were performed. Remarkably, intraperitoneal (i.p.) treatment of 
Trolox (30 mg/kg/mouse for 2 weeks) reduced the AD pathology by reducing the 
expression of Aβ, phosphorylated tau (p-tau), and β-site amyloid precursor 
protein cleaving enzyme1 (BACE1) in both cortex and hippocampus regions of mice 
brain. Furthermore, Trolox-treatment decreased neuroinflammation by inhibiting 
Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), phosphorylated nuclear factor-κB (pNF-κB) and 
interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and other inflammatory biomarkers of glial cells 
[ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) and glial fibrillary acidic 
protein (GFAP)]. Moreover, Trolox reduced oxidative stress by enhancing the 
expression of nuclear factor erythroid-related factor 2 (NRF2) and heme 
oxygenase 1 (HO1). Similarly, Trolox-induced synaptic markers, including 
synaptosomal associated protein 23 (SNAP23), synaptophysin (SYN), and 
post-synaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95), and memory functions in AD mice. Our 
findings could provide a useful and novel strategy for investigating new 
medications to treat AD-associated neurodegenerative diseases.

Recent advancements in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research have led to the 
approval of lecanemab and donanemab, highlighting the effectiveness of 
amyloid-beta (Aβ) degradation as a treatment for AD. The prospect of small 
molecule Aβ degraders as a potential treatment, which utilizes emerging targeted 
protein degradation technology, is exciting, given their ability to address some 
of the limitations of current therapies and their promising future in AD 
treatment. Despite facing challenges, these degraders are poised to become a 
future treatment option, harnessing scientific breakthroughs for more targeted 
and effective AD therapy.

Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) have increased prevalence of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) at an earlier age than the general population. Diagnostic tools 
that can improve diagnosis and treatment of dementia in DS and differentiate 
between dementia and intellectual disabilities include cognitive batteries, 
sensitive plasma assays, and PET imaging for amyloid and tau. Adults with DS 
should be included in memory clinic assessments and offered appropriate 
medications available to the general population with dementia. The Swedish 
dementia registry, SveDem, has added the diagnosis AD due to the genetic 
overload in DS, providing a national diagnostic registry for those with DS.

BACKGROUND: Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotypes have been suggested to influence 
cognitive impairment and clinical onset in presenilin-1 (PSEN1) E280A carriers 
for autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (ADAD). Less is known about their 
impact on the trajectory of biomarker changes. Neurofilament light chain (NfL), 
a marker of neurodegeneration, begins to accumulate in plasma about 20 years 
prior to the clinical onset of ADAD. In this study we investigated the impact of 
APOE ε4 and ε2 variants on age-related plasma NfL increases and cognition in 
PSEN1 E280A mutation carriers.
METHODS: We analyzed cross-sectional data from PSEN1 E280A mutation carriers and 
non-carriers recruited from the Alzheimer's Prevention Initiative Registry of 
ADAD. All participants over 18 years with available APOE genotype, plasma NfL, 
and neuropsychological evaluation were included in this study. APOE genotypes 
and plasma NfL concentrations were characterized for each participant. Cubic 
spline models using a Hamiltonian Markov chain Monte Carlo method were used to 
characterize the respective impact of at least one APOE ε4 or ε2 allele on 
age-related log-transformed plasma NfL increases. Linear regression models were 
estimated to explore the impact of APOE ε4 and ε2 variants and plasma NfL on a 
composite cognitive test score in the ADAD mutation carrier and non-carrier 
groups.
RESULTS: Analyses included 788 PSEN1 E280A mutation carriers (169 APOE ε4 + , 
114 ε2 +) and 650 mutation non-carriers (165 APOE ε4 + , 80 ε2 +), aged 
18-75 years. APOE ε4 allele carriers were distinguished from ε4 non-carriers by 
greater age-related NfL elevations in the ADAD mutation carrier group, beginning 
about three years after the mutation carriers' estimated median age at mild 
cognitive impairment onset. APOE ε2 allele carriers had lower plasma NfL 
concentrations than ε2 non-carriers in both the ADAD mutation carrier and 
non-carrier groups, unrelated to age, and an attenuated relationship between 
higher NfL levels on cognitive decline in the ADAD mutation carrier group.
CONCLUSIONS: APOE ε4 accelerates age-related plasma NfL increases and APOE ε2 
attenuates the relationship between higher plasma NfL levels and cognitive 
decline in ADAD. NfL may be a useful biomarker to assess clinical efficacy of 
APOE-modifying drugs with the potential to help in the treatment and prevention 
of ADAD.

This study explored how adherence to the DASH diet relates to 
electrophysiological measures in individuals at varying Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
risk due to family history (FH). There were 179 dementia-free subjects. DASH 
index was calculated, and participants were classified into different DASH 
adherence groups. Tertiles of relative alpha power in default mode network (DMN) 
regions were calculated. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to 
examine the association. Lower DASH adherence was associated with decreased odds 
of higher relative alpha power in the DMN, observed across the entire sample and 
specifically among those without a FH of AD. Logistic regression models 
indicated that participants with poorer DASH adherence had a reduced likelihood 
of elevated DMN alpha power, potentially influenced by vascular and amyloid-beta 
mechanisms. These findings underscore the dietary pattern's potential role in 
neural activity modulation, particularly in individuals not genetically 
predisposed to AD.

Ion channels are integral components of the nervous system, playing a pivotal 
role in shaping membrane potential, neuronal excitability, synaptic transmission 
and plasticity. Dysfunction in these channels, such as improper expression or 
localization, can lead to irregular neuronal excitability and synaptic 
communication, which may manifest as various behavioral abnormalities, including 
disrupted rest-activity cycles. Research has highlighted the significant impact 
of voltage gated ion channels on sleep parameters, influencing sleep latency, 
duration and waveforms. Furthermore, these ion channels have been implicated in 
the vulnerability to, and the pathogenesis of, several neurological and 
psychiatric disorders, including epilepsy, autism, schizophrenia, and 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this comprehensive review, we aim to provide a 
summary of the regulatory role of three predominant types of voltage-gated ion 
channels-calcium (Ca2+), sodium (Na+), and potassium (K+)-in sleep across 
species, from flies to mammals. We will also discuss the association of sleep 
disorders with various human diseases that may arise from the dysfunction of 
these ion channels, thereby underscoring the potential therapeutic benefits of 
targeting specific ion channel subtypes for sleep disturbance treatment.

Positron Emission Tomography (PET) ligands have advanced Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) diagnosis and treatment. Using autoradiography and cryo-EM, we identify AD 
brain tissue with elevated tau burden, purify filaments, and determine the 
structure of second-generation high avidity PET ligand MK-6240 at 2.31 Å 
resolution, which bound at a 1:1 ratio within the cleft of tau paired-helical 
filament (PHF), engaging with glutamine 351, lysine 353, and isoleucine 360. 
This information elucidates the basis of MK-6240 PET in quantifying PHF deposits 
in AD and may facilitate the structure-based design of superior ligands against 
tau amyloids.

Inflammaging, a state of chronic, progressive low-grade inflammation during 
aging, is associated with several adverse clinical outcomes, including frailty, 
disability, and death. Chronic inflammation is a hallmark of aging and is linked 
to the pathogenesis of many aging-related diseases. Anti-inflammatory therapies 
are also increasingly being studied as potential anti-aging treatments, and 
clinical trials have shown benefits in selected aging-related diseases. Despite 
promising advances, significant gaps remain in defining, measuring, treating, 
and integrating inflammaging into clinical geroscience research. The Clin-STAR 
Inflammation Research Interest Group was formed by a group of transdisciplinary 
clinician-scientists with the goal of advancing inflammaging-related clinical 
research and improving patient-centered care for older adults. Here, we 
integrate insights from nine medical subspecialties to illustrate the widespread 
impact of inflammaging on diseases linked to aging, highlighting the extensive 
opportunities for targeted interventions. We then propose a transdisciplinary 
approach to enhance understanding and treatment of inflammaging that aims to 
improve comprehensive care for our aging patients.

BACKGROUND: Compared to intensive care unit patients with SARS-CoV-2 negative 
acute respiratory tract infections, patients with SARS-CoV-2 are supposed to 
develop more frequently and more severely neurologic sequelae. Delirium and 
subsequent neurocognitive deficits (NCD) have implications for patients' 
morbidity and mortality. However, the extent of brain injury during acute 
COVID-19 and subsequent NCD still remain largely unexplored. Body-fluid 
biomarkers may offer valuable insights into the quantification of acute 
delirium, brain injury and may help to predict subsequent NCD following 
COVID-19.
METHODS: In a multicenter, observational case-control study, conducted across 
four German University Hospitals, hospitalized adult and pediatric patients with 
an acute COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 negative controls presenting with acute 
respiratory tract infections were included. Study procedures comprised the 
assessment of pre-existing neurocognitive function, daily screening for 
delirium, neurological examination and blood sampling. Fourteen biomarkers 
indicative of neuroaxonal, glial, neurovascular injury and inflammation were 
analyzed. Neurocognitive functions were re-evaluated after three months.
RESULTS: We enrolled 118 participants (90 adults, 28 children). The incidence of 
delirium [85 out of 90 patients (94.4%) were assessable for delirium) was 
comparable between patients with COVID-19 [16 out of 61 patients (26.2%)] and 
SARS-CoV-2 negative controls [8 out of 24 patients (33.3%); p > 0.05] across 
adults and children. No differences in outcomes as measured by the modified 
Rankin Scale, the Short-Blessed Test, the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive 
Decline in the Elderly, and the pediatrics cerebral performance category scale 
were observed after three months. Levels of body-fluid biomarkers were generally 
elevated in both adult and pediatric cohorts, without significant differences 
between SARS-CoV-2 negative controls and COVID-19. In COVID-19 patients 
experiencing delirium, levels of GFAP and MMP-9 were significantly higher 
compared to those without delirium.
CONCLUSIONS: Delirium and subsequent NCD are not more frequent in COVID-19 as 
compared to SARS-CoV-2 negative patients with acute respiratory tract 
infections. Consistently, biomarker levels of brain injury indicated no 
differences between COVID-19 cases and SARS-CoV-2 negative controls. Our data 
suggest that delirium in COVID-19 does not distinctly trigger substantial and 
persistent subsequent NCD compared to patients with other acute respiratory 
tract infections.

Alzheimer's disease is associated with the misfolding and aggregation of two 
distinct proteins, beta-amyloid and tau. Previously, it has been shown that 
activation of the cytoprotective heat shock response (HSR) pathway reduces 
beta-amyloid toxicity. Here, we show that activation of the HSR is also 
protective against tau toxicity in a cell-autonomous manner. Overexpression of 
HSF-1, the master regulator of the HSR, ameliorates the motility defect and 
increases the lifespan of transgenic C. elegans expressing human tau. By 
contrast, RNA interference of HSF-1 exacerbates the motility defect and shortens 
lifespan. Targeting regulators of the HSR also affects tau toxicity. 
Additionally, two small-molecule activators of the HSR, Geranylgeranylacetone 
(GGA) and Arimoclomol (AC), have substantial beneficial effects. Taken together, 
this research expands the therapeutic potential of HSR manipulation to 
tauopathies and reveals that the HSR can impact both beta-amyloid and tau 
proteotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease.

Numerous small molecules have been studied for their ability to counteract 
oxidative stress, a key contributor to neurodegenerative diseases such as 
Alzheimer's. Despite these efforts, the pharmacological properties and 
structure-activity relationships of these compounds remain insufficiently 
understood, yet they are critical in evaluating a drug molecule's therapeutic 
potential. A modified tetra-aza macrocycle has demonstrated strong antioxidant 
activity through various mechanisms; however, its limited permeability presents 
challenges for advanced formulation studies. To enhance permeability while 
preserving the beneficial reactivity of the parent molecule, two synthetic 
modifications involving indole functionality were explored and compared to 
modifications using methyl groups alone. New synthetic strategies were developed 
to produce the indole-containing molecules, which were characterized by 1D/2D 
NMR techniques. Isoelectric points, metal binding, and radical scavenging 
activity were determined to validate that the reactivity of the parent molecules 
was retained. The permeability of all molecules explored was improved. 
Protection against oxidative stress through activation of the Nrf2 pathway was 
demonstrated for molecules containing indoles in cellular models by measuring 
ROS levels upon treatment and mRNA levels of HO-1 and Nrf2. In contrast, no 
protection or Nrf2 activation was observed with the methylation of the O- or N 
atom. These results suggest that while alkylation improves permeability overall, 
concomitant antioxidant protection and positive permeability are achieved with 
the indole congeners alone.

INTRODUCTION: Biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change (ADNC) 
have been instrumental in developing effective disease-modifying therapeutics. 
However, to prevent/treat dementia effectively, we require biomarkers for non-AD 
neuropathologies; for this, neuropathologic examinations and annotated tissue 
samples are essential.
METHODS: We conducted clinicopathologic correlation for the first 100 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) Neuropathology Core (NPC) 
cases.
RESULTS: Clinical syndromes in this cohort showed 95% sensitivity and 79% 
specificity for predicting high/intermediate ADNC, a 21% false positive rate, 
and a ∼44% false negative rate. In addition, 60% with high/intermediate ADNC 
harbored additional potentially dementing co-pathologies.
DISCUSSION: These results suggest that clinical presentation imperfectly 
predicts ADNC and that accurate prediction of high/intermediate ADNC does not 
exclude co-pathology that may modify presentation, biomarkers, and therapeutic 
responses. Therefore, new biomarkers are needed for non-AD neuropathologies. The 
ADNI NPC supports this mission with well-characterized tissue samples (available 
through ADNI and the National Institute on Aging) and "gold-standard" diagnostic 
information (soon to include digital histology).
HIGHLIGHTS: The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
Neuropathology Core (NPC) brain donation cohort now exceeds 200 cases. ADNI NPC 
data in National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center format are available through 
the Laboratory of Neuro Imaging. Digitized slide files from the ADNI NPC will be 
available in 2025. Requests for ADNI brain tissue samples can be submitted 
online for ADNI/National Institute on Aging evaluation. Clinical diagnoses of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD)/AD and related dementias (ADRD) do not always predict 
post mortem neuropathology. Neuropathology is essential for the development of 
novel AD/ADRD biomarkers.

INTRODUCTION: Blood-based biomarkers offer a promising approach for the 
detection of neuropathologies from repetitive head impacts (RHI). We evaluated 
plasma biomarkers of amyloid, tau, neurodegeneration, and inflammation in former 
football players.
METHODS: The sample included 180 former football players and 60 asymptomatic, 
unexposed male participants (aged 45-74). Plasma assays were conducted for 
beta-amyloid (Aβ) 40, Aβ42, hyper-phosphorylated tau (p-tau) 181+231, total tau 
(t-tau), neurofilament light (NfL), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), 
interleukin-6 (IL-6), Aβ42/p-tau181 and Aβ42/Aβ40 ratios. We evaluated their 
ability to differentiate the groups and associations with RHI proxies and 
traumatic encephalopathy syndrome (TES).
RESULTS: P-tau181 and p-tau231(padj = 0.016) were higher and Aβ42/p-tau181 was 
lower(padj = 0.004) in football players compared to controls. Discrimination 
accuracy for p-tau was modest (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.742). Effects were 
not attributable to AD-related pathology. Younger age of first exposure (AFE) 
correlated with higher NfL (padj = 0.03) and GFAP (padj = 0.033). Plasma GFAP 
was higher in TES-chronic traumatic encephalopathy (TES-CTE) Possible/Probable 
(padj = 0.008).
DISCUSSION: Plasma p-tau181 and p-tau231, GFAP, and NfL may offer some 
usefulness for the characterization of RHI-related neuropathologies.
HIGHLIGHTS: Former football players had higher plasma p-tau181 and p-tau231 and 
lower Aβ42/ptau-181 compared to asymptomatic, unexposed men. Younger age of 
first exposure was associated with increased plasma NfL and GFAP in older but 
not younger participants. Plasma GFAP was higher in participants with TES-CTE 
possible/probable compared to TES-CTE no/suggestive.

Blood-based biomarkers (BBM) for Alzheimer's disease (AD) are being increasingly 
used in clinical practice to support an AD diagnosis. In contrast to traditional 
diagnostic modalities, such as amyloid positron emission tomography and 
cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, BBMs offer a more accessible and lower cost 
alternative for AD biomarker testing. Their unique scalability addresses the 
anticipated surge in demand for biomarker testing with the emergence of 
disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) that require confirmation of amyloid 
pathology. To facilitate the uptake of BBMs in clinical practice, The Global CEO 
Initiative on Alzheimer's Disease convened a BBM Workgroup to provide 
recommendations for two clinical implementational pathways for BBMs: one for 
current use for triaging and another for future use to confirm amyloid 
pathology. These pathways provide a standardized diagnostic approach with 
guidance on interpreting BBM test results. Integrating BBMs into clinical 
practice will simplify the diagnostic process and facilitate timely access to 
DMTs for eligible patients.

OBJECTIVES: Using nationally representative data sets, this study examined 
differences in healthcare expenditures between U.S.-born and foreign-born 
individuals aged 65 and above by the presence of Alzheimer's disease and related 
dementias (ADRD) and cognitive limitations (CL). This study further examined 
whether healthcare expenditures among foreign-born individuals vary by their 
duration of residence in the United States.
METHODS: The study used the 2007-2020 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and 
employed generalized linear regression models to estimate differences in 
healthcare expenditures between U.S.-born and foreign-born older adults with 
ADRD, CL, and without ADRD or CL. Survey weights were applied to all estimates.
RESULTS: Our study identified significant differences in healthcare expenditures 
among older adults by the presence of ADRD/CL and immigrant status. Having 
ADRD/CL had a more pronounced impact on high healthcare expenditures among 
foreign-born older adults than U.S.-born adults with ADRD/CL, thereby 
diminishing the difference in healthcare expenditures by U.S. nativity status 
for the older adults with ADRD or CL. In the analysis further distinguishing 
immigrants by their duration of residence, lower healthcare expenditures were 
primarily observed among foreign-born individuals with ADRD or CL who had lived 
in the United States for less than 10 years.
DISCUSSION: Our results suggest potential shifts in costs resulting from delayed 
access to, and diagnosis or treatment of ADRD at a younger age, leading to 
increased healthcare needs and expenses among U.S. foreign-born older adults.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease without any 
effective preventive or therapeutic drugs. Natural products with stable 
structures and pharmacological characteristics are valuable sources for the 
development of novel drugs for many complex diseases. This study aimed to 
discover potential natural compounds for the treatment of AD using new 
technologies and methods and explore the efficacy and mechanism of candidate 
compounds. AD-related large-scale genetic datasets were collated to construct 
disease-PPIs and natural products were collected from six databases to construct 
compound-protein interactions (CPIs). Potential relationships between natural 
compounds and AD were predicted via network proximity and gene enrichment 
analyses. Then, five AD-related cell models and d-galactose-induced aging rat 
model were established to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of candidate 
compounds in vitro and in vivo. We identified that 267 natural compounds were 
predicted to have close connections with AD and 19 compounds could exert 
protective effect in at least one cell model. Notably, purpurin exerted 
protective effect in three cell models and significantly improved the cognitive 
learning and memory functions, reduced the oxidative stress injuries and 
neuroinflammation, and enhanced the synaptic plasticity and neurotrophic effect 
in the brain of d-galactose-treated rats. In this study, AD-related natural 
compounds were identified via network proximity and gene enrichment analyses. In 
vivo and in vitro experiments revealed the therapeutic potential of purpurin for 
AD treatment, laying the foundation for further in-depth research and providing 
valuable information for the development of novel anti-AD drugs.

Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) is a peptide belonging to the transforming growth 
factor beta superfamily and acts exclusively through its receptor type 2 
(AMHR2). From the 8th week of pregnancy, AMH is produced by Sertoli cells, and 
from the 23rd week of gestation, it is produced by granulosa cells of the ovary. 
AMH plays a critical role in regulating gonadotropin secretion, ovarian tissue 
responsiveness to pituitary hormones, and the pathogenesis of polycystic ovarian 
syndrome. It inhibits the transition from primordial to primary follicles and is 
considered the best marker of ovarian reserve. Therefore, measuring AMH 
concentration of the hormone is valuable in managing assisted reproductive 
technologies. AMH was initially discovered through its role in the degeneration 
of Müllerian ducts in male fetuses. However, due to its ability to inhibit the 
cell cycle and induce apoptosis, it has also garnered interest in oncology. For 
example, antibodies targeting AMHR2 are being investigated for their potential 
in diagnosing and treating various cancers. Additionally, AMH is present in 
motor neurons and functions as a protective and growth factor. Consequently, it 
is involved in learning and memory processes and may support the treatment of 
Alzheimer's disease. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the 
biology of AMH and its role in both endocrinology and oncology.

Alzheimer's disease is associated with a loss of plasticity and cognitive 
functioning. Previous research has shown that repetitive transcranial magnetic 
stimulation (rTMS) boosts cortical neurotrophic factors, potentially addressing 
this loss. The current study aimed to expand these findings by measuring 
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), its downstream hippocampal signaling 
molecules, and behavioral effects of rTMS on the 3xTg-AD mouse line. 3xTg-AD (n 
= 24) and B6 wild-type controls (n = 26), aged 12 months, were given 14 days of 
consecutive rTMS at 10 Hz for 10 min. Following treatment, mice underwent a 
battery of behavioral tests and biochemical analysis of BDNF and its downstream 
cascades were evaluated via Western blot and ELISA. Results showed that brain 
stimulation did improve performance on the Object Place Task and increased 
hippocampal TrkB, ERK, and PLCγ in 3xTg-AD mice with minimal effects on 
wild-type mice. There was no significant difference in the levels of AKT and 
Truncated TrkB (TrkB.T1) between treatment and sham. Thus, rTMS has the 
potential to provide an efficacious non-invasive therapy for the treatment of 
Alzheimer's disease through activation of neurotrophic factor signaling.

The Religious Order Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) is an initiative 
that integrates two longitudinal cohort studies, which have been collecting 
clinicopathological and molecular data since the early 1990s. This extensive 
dataset includes a wide array of omic data, revealing the complex interactions 
between molecular levels in neurodegenerative diseases (ND) and aging. 
Neurodegenerative diseases (ND) are frequently associated with morbidity and 
cognitive decline in older adults. Omics research, in conjunction with clinical 
variables, is crucial for advancing our understanding of the diagnosis and 
treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. This summary reviews the extensive 
omics research-encompassing genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, 
epigenomics, and multiomics-conducted through the ROSMAP study. It highlights 
the significant advancements in understanding the mechanisms underlying 
neurodegenerative diseases, with a particular focus on Alzheimer's disease.

This editorial takes a deeper look at the insights provided by Soresi and 
Giannitrapani, which examined the therapeutic potential of glucagon-like 
peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) for metabolic dysfunction-associated 
fatty liver disease. We provide supplementary insights to their research, 
highlighting the broader systemic implications of GLP-1RAs, synthesizing the 
current understanding of their mechanisms and the trajectory of research in this 
field. GLP-1RAs are revolutionizing the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus 
and beyond. Beyond glycemic control, GLP-1RAs demonstrate cardiovascular and 
renal protective effects, offering potential in managing diabetic kidney disease 
al-ongside renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors. Their role in bone 
metabolism hints at benefits for diabetic osteoporosis, while the 
neuroprotective properties of GLP-1RAs show promise in Alzheimer's disease 
treatment by modulating neuronal insulin signaling. Additionally, they improve 
hormonal and metabolic profiles in polycystic ovary syndrome. This editorial 
highlights the multifaceted mechanisms of GLP-1RAs, emphasizing the need for 
ongoing research to fully realize their therapeutic potential across a range of 
multisystemic diseases.

Following the legalization of recreational Cannabis in Canada in 2018, the 
associated waste, including Cannabis roots, has significantly increased. 
Cannabis roots, comprising 30%-50% of the total plant, are often discarded 
despite their historical use in Ayurvedic medicine for treating inflammatory and 
infectious disorders. This study evaluates the phytochemical and therapeutic 
properties of Cannabis root extracts from a high tetrahydrocannabinolic acid, 
low cannabidiolic acid cultivar (variety Alien Gorilla Glue). We performed ultra 
high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry 
(UPLC-QTOF-MS) to identify the chemical components of the Cannabis roots. 
Extracts using water, ethanol and acid-base solvents were tested for antioxidant 
activity through free radical scavenging, metal chelation, and lipoperoxidation 
inhibition assays. Mitochondrial membrane protection was assessed using flow 
cytometry with the MitoPerOx probe in THP-1 monocytic leukemia cells. 
Anti-inflammatory potential was evaluated by measuring interleukin-6 levels in 
lipopolysaccharide-stimulated THP-1 cells. Bactericidal/fungicidal efficacy 
against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans was 
determined using the p-iodonitrophenyltetrazolium assay. Additionally, we 
investigated the anticholinesterase activity of Cannabis root extracts, given 
the potential role of plant alkaloids in inhibiting cholinesterase, an enzyme 
targeted in Alzheimer's disease treatments. UPLC-QTOF-MS analysis suggested the 
presence of several phenolic compounds, cannabinoids, terpenoids, amino acids, 
and nitrogen-containing compounds. Our results indicated significant 
antioxidant, bactericidal, and anticholinesterase properties of Cannabis root 
extracts from both soil and hydroponic cultivation. Extracts showed strong 
antioxidant activity across multiple assays, protected mitochondrial membrane in 
THP-1 cells, and exhibited anti-inflammatory and bactericidal/fungicidal 
efficacy. Notably, soil-cultivated roots displayed superior anti-inflammatory 
effects. These findings demonstrate the remarkable antioxidant, 
anti-inflammatory, and anti-microbial activities of Cannabis roots, supporting 
their traditional uses and challenging their perception as mere waste. This 
study highlights the therapeutic potential of Cannabis roots extracts and 
suggests avenues for further research and application.

OBJECTIVE: White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are the most common neuroimaging 
manifestation of cerebral small vessel disease, and is frequently observed in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aimed to investigate the relationship 
between WMH and cognition and to verify the mediation of grey matter atrophy in 
this relationship.
METHODS: The diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) technique analyses white matter 
fiber tract to assess white matter integrity. Voxel-based morphometry was 
applied to measure the grey matter volume (GMV). A linear regression model was 
applied to examine the associations between WMH and GMV, and mediation analyses 
was performed to determine the mediating role of regional GMV in the effect of 
WMH on cognitive function.
RESULTS: Compared to the HC group, AD group have 8 fiber tract fractional 
anisotropy (FA) decreased and 16 fiber tract mean diffusivity (MD) increased. 
Compared to AD without WMH, AD with high WMH had 9 fiber tracts FA decreased and 
13 fiber tracts MD increased. High WMH volume was negatively correlated with GMV 
in the frontal-parietal region. Low WMH volume was also negatively correlated 
with GMV except for the three regions (right angular gyrus, right superior 
frontal gyrus and right middle/inferior parietal gyrus), where GMV was 
positively correlated. Mediation analysis showed that the association between 
WMH and executive function or episodic memory were mediated by GMV in the 
frontal-parietal region.
CONCLUSION: Damage to white matter integrity was more severe in AD with WMH. 
Differential changes in DTI metrics may be caused by progressive myelin and 
axonal damage. There was a negative correlation between WMH and grey matter 
atrophy in frontal-parietal regions in a volume-dependent manner. This study 
indicates the correspondence between WMH volume and GMV in cognition, and GMV 
being a key modulator between WMH and cognition in AD. This result will 
contribute to understanding the progression of the disease process and applying 
targeted therapeutic intervention in the earlier stage to delay 
neurodegenerative changes in frontal-parietal regions to achieve better 
treatment outcomes and affordability.

OBJECTIVES: Tilia viridis (Bayer) Simonk. (Malvaceae) is widely distributed in 
Argentina and employed for its tranquilizing properties. Other species of the 
genus (Tilia europaea L., Tilia cordata Mill., Tilia platyphyllos Scop.) have 
been traditionally used for the treatment of epilepsy. Epilepsy affects 
approximately 65 million people worldwide and is characterized by an imbalance 
between excitatory and inhibitory processes in the brain, leading to 
unpredictable, unprovoked, recurrent seizures. Current pharmacological 
interventions often present mild to moderately severe side effects. Epilepsy has 
been associated with oxidative and nitrative stress as well as 
neuroinflammation. Herbal medicine therapies may offer new treatment options 
with multi-target antioxidant and anticonvulsant effects for patients whose 
seizures remain uncontrolled, potentially providing cost-effective solutions for 
individuals worldwide suffering from uncontrolled epilepsy.The aim of this study 
was to demonstrate the anticonvulsant activity of a standardized T. viridis 
aqueous extract (TE).
METHODS: Study of the constituents of TE, TE's antioxidant and anticonvulsant 
activities and toxicity, and analysis of the possible relation between the 
potential activities and the compounds present in the extract. In order to 
demonstrate TE's anticonvulsant activity a zebrafish model was used. The study 
also assessed TE's toxicity and antioxidant activity. To standardize the 
extract, total polyphenols and flavonoids were quantified and specific 
flavonoids were identified and quantified using HPLC-MS/MS and HPLC-UV.
RESULTS: TE exhibited anticonvulsant activity at low concentrations and 
demonstrated antioxidant effects by scavenging free radicals, exhibiting 
superoxide dismutase and peroxidase-like activities, as well as inhibiting 
lipoperoxidation. These actions can be attributed to the presence of 
polyphenols, particularly flavonoids.
CONCLUSION: TE holds promise as a complementary herbal medicine in the treatment 
of epilepsy and may also offer benefits for other neuropathies associated with 
oxidative stress, such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.

BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that up to 40% of dementia cases worldwide are 
associated with modifiable risk factors; however, these estimates are not known 
in Canada. Furthermore, sleep disturbances, an emerging factor, has not been 
incorporated into the life-course model of dementia prevention.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the population impact of 12 modifiable risk factors in 
Canadian adults including sleep disturbances, by sex and age groups, and to 
compare with other countries.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging 
baseline data.
SETTING: Community.
PARTICIPANTS: 30,097 adults aged 45 years and older.
MEASUREMMENTS: Prevalence and Population Attributable Fractions (PAFs) 
associated with less education, hearing loss, traumatic brain injury, 
hypertension, excessive alcohol, obesity, smoking, depression, social isolation, 
physical inactivity, diabetes, and sleep disturbances.
RESULTS: The risk factors with the largest PAF were later life physical 
inactivity (10.2%; 95% CI, 6.8% to 13%), midlife hearing loss (6.5%; 3.7% to 
9.3%), midlife obesity (6.4%; 4.1% to 7.7%), and midlife hypertension (6.2%; 
2.7% to 9.3%). The PAF of later life sleep disturbances was 3.0% (95% CI, 1.8% 
to 3.8%). The 12 risk factors accounted for 51.9% (32.2% to 68.0%) of dementia 
among men and 52.4% (32.5% to 68.7%) among women. Overall, the combined PAF of 
all risk factors was 49.2% (31.1% to 64.9%), and it increased with age.
CONCLUSION: Nearly up to 50% of dementia cases in Canada are attributable to 12 
modifiable risk factors across the lifespan. Canadian risk reduction strategies 
should prioritize targeting physical inactivity, hearing loss, obesity, and 
hypertension.

BACKGROUND: Since the beginning of Alzheimer's disease research, the hypothesis 
that infections are to some extent associated with neurodegenerative processes 
has been tested repeatedly. Epidemiological studies on the associations between 
infections and dementia have reported conflicting results.
OBJECTIVES: This study analyses common hospital-treated infections (herpes, 
influenza, intestinal infections, pneumonia, sepsis, urinary tract infections) 
and their association with subsequent dementia and time until dementia onset.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: For this nationwide population-based 
case-control study, the dataset of the Austrian National Health Insurance 
Association was used, including dementia patients (dementia cohort) and age- and 
gender-matched non-demented individuals (control cohort). Only subjects with 
data availability of at least 10 years prior to the index date (date of dementia 
diagnosis or date of censoring) were included.
MEASUREMENTS: The incidence of six common infections in older adults (herpes, 
influenza, intestinal infections, pneumonia, sepsis, and urinary tract 
infections) was analyzed over a period of 10 years before the censoring date.
RESULTS: The study population consists of 58208 subjects (29104 per study 
cohort), mean age: 81 years, 54% females. Patients of the dementia cohort had 
suffered from infections significantly more often than patients of the control 
cohort (6002, 20.6% vs. 4826, 16.6%; p < 0.001). Influenza, urinary tract 
infections, intestinal infections, and sepsis showed independent positive 
associations with subsequent dementia diagnosis, irrespective of other 
comorbidities (odds ratios: 1.26 (95% CI: 1.06-1.49), 1.23 (95% CI: 1.16-1.30), 
1.16 (95% CI: 1.07-1.27), 1.17 (95% CI: 1.01-1.37), respectively). Time from 
infection to dementia diagnosis was shorter after influenza compared to all 
other infections (median: 3.4 years (95% CI: 3.1-3.7) vs. 6.6 years (95% CI: 
6.4-6.8); p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: This is the first study to assess the association between infections 
and dementia over such a long minimum reporting period. These results, supported 
by consistent data from other epidemiological studies, emphasize the critical 
importance of infection prevention measures, especially for older adults. 
Further research is crucial to better understand the nature of the relationship 
between infections and dementia.

BACKGROUND: Advances in plasma biomarkers to detect Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
biology allows researchers to improve the efficiency of participant recruitment 
into preclinical trials. Recently, protein levels of plasma amyloid-beta and tau 
proteins have been shown to be predictive of elevated amyloid in brain. Online 
registries, such as the Alzheimer's Prevention Trials (APT) Webstudy, include 
and follow participants using remote assessments to facilitate efficient 
screening and enrollment of large numbers of individuals who may be at higher 
risk for AD.
OBJECTIVES: The AlzMatch Pilot Study investigated the feasibility of recruiting 
individuals from an online registry for blood sample collection at 
community-based phlebotomy centers and plasma biomarker quantification to assess 
an individual's eligibility for AD preclinical trials.
DESIGN: Pilot feasibility study with co-primary outcomes.
SETTING: This pilot feasibility study included participants from the APT 
Webstudy, the remote assessment arm of the Trial-ready cohort for Preclinical 
and Prodromal AD (TRC-PAD) Platform. Novel design included collection of 
electronic consent, use of community laboratories for plasma collection, mass 
spectrometry-based biomarker assay, and telephone communication of plasma 
biomarker screening eligibility.
PARTICIPANTS: Participants invited to the AlzMatch pilot feasibility study were 
active in the APT Webstudy, 50 years of age or older, resided within 50 miles of 
both a Quest Diagnostics Patient Services Center (a national diagnostic 
laboratory with convenient locations for sample collection and processing) and 
one of six TRC-PAD vanguard clinical trial sites, had no self-reported dementia 
diagnosis, were able to communicate in English and engaged with the APT Webstudy 
within the prior 6 months.
MEASUREMENTS: Primary feasibility outcomes were completion of electronic consent 
(e-consent) for invited participants and collection of usable blood samples. 
Additional feasibility outcomes included invitation response rate, plasma 
biomarker eligibility status (based on amyloid beta-42/40 [Aβ42/40] 
concentration ratio), ApoE proteotype, and trial inclusion criterion), and 
completion of telephone contact to learn eligibility to screen for a study.
RESULTS: 300 APT Webstudy participants were invited to consent to the AlzMatch 
study. The AlzMatch e-consent rate was 39% (n=117) (95% CI of 33.5%-44.5%) 
overall, which was higher than the expected rate of 25%. Similar consent rates 
were observed across participants based on self-defined sex (41% Female (n=75), 
37% Male (n=42)) and race and ethnicity (37% from underrepresented groups (URG) 
(n=36), 40% not from URG (n=79)). Among those that consented (n=117), plasma was 
successfully collected from 74% (n=87) (95% CI of 66%-82%), with similar rates 
across sex (76% Female (n=57), 71% Male (n=30)) and race and ethnicity (75% URG 
(n=27) and 75% not from URG (n=59)). 60% (n=51) of participants with plasma 
biomarker results were eligible to screen for future preclinical AD trials.
CONCLUSION: Electronic consent of participants through an online registry, blood 
sample collection at community-based centers, plasma biomarker quantification 
and reporting, and biomarker assessments for study eligibility were all feasible 
with similar engagement rates across demographic groups. Although this pilot was 
a small and selective sample, participants engaged and consented at higher than 
expected rates. We conclude that collecting blood at community laboratories for 
biomarker analyses may improve accessibility beyond research, and may facilitate 
broader access for clinical use of AD plasma biomarkers. Based on our results, 
an expanded version of the AlzMatch study is underway, which involves expanding 
invitations to additional APT Webstudy participants and clinical trial sites.

INTRODUCTION: Metrics of a participant's socioeconomic status (SES) are not 
routinely collected or standardized in clinical trials. This omission limits the 
ability to evaluate the generalizability of trial results and restricts 
clinicians from confidently interpreting the efficacy of new treatments across 
important sub-populations.
METHODS: We adapted an SES measure of social disparity; the Hollingshead Two 
Factor Index of Social Position, which combines education and occupation into a 
single metric. We modernized the 1965 occupations to reflect the 2017 careers 
tabulated by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. We currently use this adapted 
measure in Alzheimer's Clinical Trials Consortium studies.
RESULTS: We present the revised table of occupations. We found that the 
collection of SES data using the modified Hollingshead was feasible in a 
multi-site clinical trial and scores were distributed across all SES strata.
DISCUSSION: The modified Hollingshead provides a standardized method for 
collecting SES information, enabling data aggregation, monitoring, and 
reporting.

Research Professor of Economics, USC Dornsife, 635 Downey Way, #505N, Los 
Angeles, CA 90089, Mobile: +1 202 468 5797, mattke@usc.edu.

BACKGROUND: Multiple disease modifying treatment for Alzheimer's disease are 
currently in clinical development or have been recently approved for use. They 
have vastly different treatment properties but so far, little work has been done 
to quantify the impact of treatment properties on the treatment's value in terms 
of medical and social care costs and caregiver burden.
OBJECTIVES: This study aims to analyze how the mode of treatment administration, 
treatment frequency and duration, and monitoring requirements affect the value 
of disease modifying treatments. In order to isolate these effects, we compare 
five hypothetical disease modifying treatments with equal efficacy and safety: 
(1) chronic bi-weekly intravenous infusion, (2) chronic four-weekly intravenous 
infusion, (3) 52 weeks fixed duration four-weekly intravenous infusion, (4) 
chronic subcutaneous injections, and (5) chronic oral prescription on their 
direct medical costs, caregiver burden, and preservation of treatment value.
DESIGN: Survey of Alzheimer's disease treatment clinics and retrospective data 
analysis.
SETTING: United States.
MEASUREMENTS: Direct medical cost and caregiver burden of treatment 
administration and monitoring compared to gross treatment benefit.
RESULTS: Chronic bi-weekly infusion treatment had the highest direct medical 
cost ($45,208) and caregiver burden ($6,095), reducing the treatment value by 
44%, while oral treatment with the lowest direct medical cost ($1,983) and 
caregiver burden ($457) reduced the treatment value by only 2%. Substantial 
caregiver burden was reported from the survey, with a reported average of 2.3 
hours for an office visit and infusion, 44 minutes of round-trip travel time, 
and 78% of patients being accompanied by a caregiver for treatment.
CONCLUSION: Burden of chronic intravenous treatments exceed the gross medical 
and social care cost savings and value of caregiver benefit. The results suggest 
the need for less complex treatments that require fewer clinic visits to 
preserve the economic value of disease modifying treatments.

konstantinos.avgerinos@wayne.edu.

BACKGROUND: The BCG vaccine has been traditionally administered to prevent TB. 
It has been additionally used in bladder cancer patients as a therapy with 
success. Some observational studies found that bladder cancer patients receiving 
BCG may have reduced dementia risk, however, the evidence is not conclusive.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of BCG vaccine on dementia risk in bladder 
cancer patients.
METHODS: Six databases were searched from inception to January 13, 2024, for 
published and unpublished studies that examine the association between BCG and 
dementia risk in bladder cancer patients. We conducted meta-analyses using a 
random-effects model.
RESULTS: Eight retrospective cohort studies were included in the systematic 
review and seven in the meta-analyses. Because there were studies with 
overlapping populations, two separate main analyses were performed reassuring 
the avoidance of overlap. The first analysis showed that compared to controls, 
BCG did not reduce dementia risk [5 studies pooled, n=88,852, HR = 0.65, 95% CI 
(0.40, 1.06), I2 = 85%] whereas there was a marginally significant risk 
reduction in the second analysis [6 studies pooled, n=70,025, HR = 0.63, 95% CI 
(0.40, 0.97), I2 = 83%]. Sensitivity analysis excluding the unpublished studies 
did not affect the outcome importantly. Additional meta-analysis showed that BCG 
did not reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease.
CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis of observational studies found that BCG 
administration in bladder cancer patients has likely a minimally positive impact 
on dementia risk if any. To better understand the effect of BCG on dementia, 
randomized controlled trials are needed.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder featured by 
progressive cognitive decline, which manifests in severe impairment of memory, 
attention, emotional processing and daily activities, leading to significant 
disability and social burden. Investigation on Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), 
the prodromal and transitional stage between normal aging and AD, serves as a 
key in diagnosing and slowing down the progression of AD. Numerous effects have 
been made up to date, however, the attentional mechanisms under different 
external emotion stimuli in MCI and AD are still unexplored in deep.
OBJECTIVE: To further explore the attentional mechanisms under different 
external emotion stimuli in both MCI and AD patients.
DESIGN/SETTING/PARTICIPANTS/MEASUREMENTS: In 51 healthy volunteers (Controls, 24 
males and 27 females), 52 MCI (19 males and 33 females), and 47 AD (15 males and 
32 females) patients, we administered the visual oddball event-related 
potentials (ERPs) under three types of external emotional stimuli: Neutral, 
Happiness and Sadness, in which the components N1, P2, N2 and P3 as well as the 
abnormal cortical activations corresponding to the significant ERP differences 
in the three groups were observed.
RESULTS: Under all three external emotions, in AD patients, N2 and P3 latencies 
were significantly prolonged compared to both Controls and MCI. In addition, 
under Happiness, in MCI, P3 latencies were significantly delayed compared to 
Controls. Meanwhile, under both Happiness and Sadness, in AD patients, P3 
amplitudes were significantly decreased compared to Controls and MCI, 
respectively. During N2 time window, under Neutral emotion, significant 
hypoactivation in the right superior temporal gyrus was found in AD patients 
compared to Controls, and under Happiness, the activation of the right inferior 
frontal gyrus was significantly attenuated in MCI compared to Controls. Under 
Sadness, in AD patients, the activation of the right superior frontal gyrus was 
significantly decreased compared to MCI. During P3 time window, under both 
Happiness and Sadness, when AD patients compared to MCI, the significantly 
attenuated activations were located in the right fusiform gyrus and the right 
middle occipital gyrus, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated visual attentional deficits under external 
emotional stimuli in both MCI and AD patients, highlighting the function of 
Happiness for early detecting MCI, in which the P3 latency and the 
hypoactivation of right inferior frontal gyrus during N2 time window can be 
early signs. The current study sheds further light of attentional mechanisms in 
MCI and AD patients, and indicates the value of emotional processing in the 
early detection of cognitive dysfunction.

BACKGROUND: Fruits are an important source of flavonoids, and greater intake of 
dietary flavonoids in older adults has been shown to be associated with 
decreased risk of dementia. It is unclear whether this relationship is similar 
or different between younger adults and older adults.
OBJECTIVES: We examined for associations between midlife and late-life intake of 
flavonoid-rich fruits and incident dementia. We hypothesized that greater total 
cumulative intake of flavonoid-rich fruits in midlife and late-life adults would 
be associated with reduced risk of all-cause dementia.
DESIGN: Longitudinal, cohort study design.
SETTING: Framingham Heart Study, which is a longitudinal, multi-generational 
community-based cohort based in Framingham, Massachusetts, USA.
PARTICIPANTS: Participants from the Framingham Heart Study Offspring cohort were 
included (n = 2,790) who attended the fifth core exam between 1991 to 1995, and 
were dementia-free and at least 45 years of age at that time, as well as had 
valid food frequency questionnaires from the fifth to ninth core exams.
MEASUREMENTS: Consumption of fruits with high flavonoid content or are important 
contributors to overall flavonoid intake was collected via food frequency 
questionnaire. Flavonoid-rich fruits from the food frequency questionnaire 
included raisins or grapes, prunes, bananas, fresh apples or pears, apple juice 
or cider, oranges, orange juice, grapefruit, grapefruit juice, strawberries, 
blueberries, and peaches, apricots, or plums. Dementia ascertainment was based 
on a multidisciplinary consensus committee, and included all-cause dementia and 
Alzheimer's disease dementia diagnoses based on research criteria. Cox models 
were used to examine associations between cumulative fruit intake and incident 
dementia, stratified by midlife (45-59 years; n = 1,642) and late-life (60-82 
years; n = 1,148).
RESULTS: Greater cumulative total fruit intake in midlife, but not late-life, 
was significantly associated with a 44% decreased risk of all-cause dementia (HR 
= 0.56; 95% CI = 0.32 - 0.98; p = 0.044). Decreased risk of all-cause dementia 
was also associated with higher intake of apples or pears in midlife and 
late-life, as well as higher intake of raisins or grapes in midlife only, and 
higher intake of oranges, grapefruit, blueberries, and peaches, apricots, or 
plums in late-life only.
CONCLUSIONS: Among participants from the Framingham Heart Study, greater overall 
consumption of flavonoid-rich fruits in midlife was associated with reduced risk 
of dementia, though intake of specific fruits in midlife and late-life may have 
a protective role against developing dementia. These findings may help to inform 
future recommendations on when dietary interventions may be most beneficial to 
healthy brain aging across the life course.

BACKGROUND: Global prevalence and incidence of dementia continue to rise at a 
rapid rate. There is a need for new Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatments 
globally. Aducanumab is a human monoclonal antibody that selectively targets 
aggregated soluble amyloid beta oligomers and insoluble amyloid beta fibrils. In 
June 2021, aducanumab was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for 
the treatment of AD under the accelerated approval pathway.
OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the efficacy, safety, biomarker and pharmacokinetics 
(PK) of aducanumab in Japanese subgroups in EMERGE and ENGAGE studies.
DESIGN: EMERGE and ENGAGE were two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
global, phase 3 studies of aducanumab in patients with early AD (mild cognitive 
impairment due to AD or mild AD dementia).
SETTING: These studies involved 348 sites in 20 countries.
PARTICIPANTS: Participants enrolled in Japan included 121 (7.4% of total 1638 in 
EMERGE) and 100 (6.1% of total 1647 in ENGAGE) patients (aged 50-85 years with 
confirmed amyloid pathology) who met clinical criteria for mild cognitive 
impairment due to AD or mild AD dementia.
INTERVENTION: Participants were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to receive aducanumab 
low dose (3 or 6 mg/kg target dose), high dose (6 or 10 mg/kg target dose) or 
placebo via IV infusion once every 4 weeks over 76 weeks.
MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome measure was change from baseline to Week 78 on 
the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), an integrated scale that 
assesses both function and cognition. Other measures included safety 
assessments; secondary and tertiary clinical outcomes that assessed cognition, 
function, and behavior; biomarker endpoints (amyloid PET and plasma p-tau181); 
serum PK profiles and immunogenicity.
RESULTS: Results from the Japanese subgroup analyses were generally consistent 
with those of the overall study population across endpoints, while a lower mean 
body weight (kg) and a smaller proportion of ApoE ε4 carriers were observed in 
the Japanese subgroup population. A treatment effect was observed in favor of 
aducanumab on the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints at Week 78 in EMERGE, 
but not ENGAGE. The incidence and type of adverse events in the Japanese 
subgroups were generally comparable to those observed in the overall study 
population; amyloid related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) were common 
treatment-related adverse events that appeared to be related to the aducanumab 
dose. ARIA incidence was generally lower in the Japanese subgroup compared with 
the overall population. Consistent with the overall data set, a robust 
dose-dependent decrease in amyloid beta levels as assessed with amyloid-PET and 
plasma p-tau181 was observed. Serum PK profiles and immunogenicity of aducanumab 
in Japanese population were consistent with the non-Japanese population.
CONCLUSION: Efficacy, safety, biomarker, and PK profiles of aducanumab were 
consistent between the Japanese subgroup and the overall population. A positive 
treatment effect of aducanumab on efficacy endpoints was observed in EMERGE, but 
not in ENGAGE.

BACKGROUND: Linking data from clinical trials and real-world claims may improve 
the robustness of trial data and provide information on the health, economic, 
and societal impacts of a disease.
OBJECTIVE: To report on the feasibility of linking trial data to Medicare claims 
data in early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the US.
DESIGN AND SETTING: Alzheimer's Disease Linkage to Real-World Evidence (AD-LINE) 
was a noninterventional cohort study that included participants recruited from 
the GRADUATE program whose trial data were linked to their Medicare claims.
PARTICIPANTS: AD-LINE participants were 66 years and older with early 
symptomatic AD (ie, mild cognitive impairment [MCI] due to AD or mild AD 
dementia) and were enrolled in the GRADUATE program and a Medicare 
fee-for-service or Medicare Advantage plan.
MEASUREMENTS: The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services linked 
participants' clinical trial identifiers to their Medicare beneficiary 
identifiers using a deterministic, exact matching process. Demographics and 
clinical characteristics of the AD-LINE cohort at baseline were collected. 
Outcomes measured in this study included healthcare resource utilization derived 
from Medicare claims data.
RESULTS: In total, 147 participants across 21 US sites were invited to 
participate and 111 provided informed consent. Of those, 61 patients had 
linkable data (ie, Medicare beneficiary identifier), Medicare Parts A/B 
enrollment, and no health maintenance organization (HMO) enrollment in the year 
before trial entry. Of the 61 participants whose data were analyzed in this 
study, 30 had MCI due to AD and 31 had mild AD dementia. Participants in the MCI 
due to AD group had more healthcare resource utilization on average in the 
baseline period than those in the mild AD dementia group (29.9 [SD, 20.9] vs 
24.5 claims [SD, 12.3]). In an ad hoc analysis, a relatively high concordance 
(85.3%) was seen between the rates of clinically confirmed AD diagnosis and 
evidence of AD diagnosis in claims data.
CONCLUSION: This linkage process may serve as a proof of concept for researchers 
interested in linking clinical trial and real-world claims data. The lessons 
learned from AD-LINE and innovation of data linkage approaches may encourage key 
stakeholders to link data in the future.

BACKGROUND: Semorinemab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the N-terminal 
domain of the tau protein that is in clinical development for the treatment of 
Alzheimer's disease.
OBJECTIVES: To perform model-based evaluations of the observed pharmacokinetics 
in serum and the total plasma tau target-engagement dynamics from clinical 
studies evaluating semorinemab.
DESIGN: The observed semorinemab pharmacokinetics and plasma tau target 
engagement from phase 1 and 2 clinical studies were modeled using a non-linear 
mixed effect target-mediated drug disposition model. The model was simulated to 
understand target engagement at clinical dose levels.
SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: The clinical studies testing semorinemab were 
evaluated in healthy volunteers, subjects with prodromal-to-mild Alzheimer's 
disease, and subjects with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. The data 
included a total of 8430 semorinemab serum concentrations and 4772 total tau 
protein plasma concentrations from 463 subjects treated with a range of single 
and multiple doses of semorinemab.
MEASUREMENTS: Serum concentrations of semorinemab and the total plasma tau 
concentrations were measured after administration of a range of doses of 
semorinemab to subjects with Alzheimer's disease. A sensitivity analysis was 
performed wherein key target-mediated drug disposition model parameters were 
estimated separately between healthy volunteers, subjects with prodromal-to-mild 
Alzheimer's disease, and subjects with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease.
RESULTS: Serum concentrations of semorinemab were consistent across studies and 
showed a dose-proportional increase across the evaluated dose range. The 
pharmacokinetic profile was comparable between healthy volunteers and subjects 
with Alzheimer's disease. Total plasma tau concentrations increased in a 
dose-dependent non-linear manner upon semorinemab administration. The 
target-mediated drug disposition model adequately described the serum 
pharmacokinetics and protein dynamics with an estimated antibody-ligand binding 
strength, Kss, of 42.7 nM. The estimated values of clearance and central volume 
of distribution were 0.109 L/day/70 kg and 2.95 L/70 kg, respectively, and were 
consistent with typical values for IgG mAbs. In the sensitivity analysis, Kss 
(32 nM) and baseline tau protein (0.30 µM) were estimated to be lower for 
healthy volunteers compared to subjects with Alzheimer's disease but were 
comparable between subjects with Alzheimer's disease of different severities 
(Kss: 52-57 nM, baseline tau: 0.44-0.47 µM). The models suggested that 
peripheral target engagement was over 90% at the clinical doses in each of the 
diagnostic subgroups.
CONCLUSION: Our target-mediated drug disposition model adequately described the 
serum pharmacokinetics and the peripheral non-linear increase with dose of the 
total tau. The model confirmed that these dose-response relationships were 
consistent across populations of healthy volunteers and subjects with different 
severities of Alzheimer's disease.

Changes in biomarker levels of Alzheimer's disease (AD) reflect underlying 
pathophysiological changes in the brain and can provide evidence of direct and 
downstream treatment effects linked to disease modification. Recent results from 
clinical trials of anti-amyloid β (Aβ) treatments have raised the question of 
how to best characterize the relationship between AD biomarkers and clinical 
endpoints. Consensus methodology for assessing such relationships is lacking, 
leading to inconsistent evaluation and reporting. In this review, we provide a 
statistical framework for reporting treatment effects on early and late 
accelerating AD biomarkers and assessing their relationship with clinical 
endpoints at the subject and group levels. Amyloid positron emission tomography 
(PET), plasma p-tau, and tau PET follow specific trajectories during AD and are 
used as exemplar cases to contrast biomarkers with early and late progression. 
Subject-level correlation was assessed using change from baseline in biomarkers 
versus change from baseline in clinical endpoints, and interpretation of the 
correlation is dependent on the biomarker and disease stage. Group-level 
correlation was assessed using the placebo-adjusted treatment effects on 
biomarkers versus those on clinical endpoints in each trial. This correlation 
leverages the fundamental advantages of randomized placebo-controlled trials and 
assesses the predictivity of a treatment effect on a biomarker or clinical 
benefit. Harmonization in the assessment of treatment effects on biomarkers and 
their relationship to clinical endpoints will provide a wealth of comparable 
data across clinical trials and may yield new insights for the treatment of AD.

Recent positive results of three phase III anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody 
trials are transforming the landscape of disease-modifying therapeutics for 
Alzheimer's disease, following several decades of failures. Indeed, all three 
trials have met their primary endpoints. However, the absolute size of the 
benefit measured in these trials has generated a debate on whether the change 
scores observed on clinical outcome assessments represent a clinically 
meaningful benefit to patients. An evidence-based conclusion is urgently 
required to inform decision-making related to the approval, reimbursement, and 
ultimately, the management of emerging therapies in clinical practice. The EU-US 
CTAD Task Force met in Boston to address this important question. The current 
state-of-the-art knowledge for interpreting clinical meaningfulness of AD 
clinical trial results, including the point of view of patients and study 
partners on what is clinically meaningful, was discussed and is summarized here. 
A combination of methodologies to address the challenges emerged. There remain 
gaps in the understanding of clinical meaningfulness that only long-term 
longitudinal studies will be able to address.

β-amyloid-targeting antibodies represent the first generation of effective 
causal treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and can be considered historical 
research milestones. Their effect sizes, side effects, implementation challenges 
and costs, however, have stimulated debates about their overall value. In this 
position statement academic clinicians of the European Alzheimer's Disease 
Consortium (EADC) discuss the critical relevance of introducing these new 
treatments in clinical care now. Given the complexity of AD it is unlikely that 
molecular single-target treatments will achieve substantially larger effects 
than those seen with current β-amyloid-targeting antibodies. Larger effects will 
most likely only be achieved incrementally by continuous optimization of 
molecular approaches, patient selection and combinations therapies. To be 
successful in this regard, drug development must be informed by the use of 
innovative treatments in real world practice, because full understanding of all 
facets of novel treatments requires experience and data of real-world care 
beyond those of clinical trials. Regarding the antibodies under discussion we 
consider their effects meaningful and potential side effects manageable. We 
assume that the number of eventually treated patient will only be a fraction of 
all early AD patients due to narrow eligibility criteria and barriers of access. 
We strongly endorse the use of these new compound in clinical practice in 
selected patients with treatment documentation in registries. We understand this 
as a critical step in advancing the field of AD treatment, and in shaping the 
health care systems for the new area of molecular-targeted treatment of 
neurodegenerative diseases.

BACKGROUND: Recently, two monoclonal antibodies that lower amyloid plaques have 
shown promising results for the treatment of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and 
mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). These treatments require the 
identification of cognitively impaired older adults with biomarker evidence of 
AD pathology using CSF biomarkers or amyloid-PET. Previous studies showed plasma 
biomarkers (plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 and p-tau181) and hippocampal volume from 
structural MRI correlated with brain amyloid pathology. We hypothesized plasma 
biomarkers with hippocampal volume would identify patients who are suitable 
candidates for disease-modifying therapy.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the performance of plasma AD biomarkers and hippocampal 
atrophy to detect MCI or AD with amyloid pathology confirmed by amyloid-PET or 
CSF biomarkers in ADNI.
DESIGN: A cross-sectional and longitudinal study.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Data were from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative. Participants were aged 55-90 years old with plasma biomarker and 
structural MRI brain data.
MEASUREMENTS: The optimum cut-off point for plasma Aβ42/Aβ40, p-tau181, and NFL 
and the performance of combined biomarkers and hippocampal atrophy for detecting 
cognitive impairment with brain amyloid pathology were evaluated. The 
association between baseline plasma biomarkers and clinical progression, defined 
by CDR-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) and diagnostic conversion over two years, was 
evaluated using a Weibull time-to-event analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 428 participants were included; 167 had normal cognition, 
245 had MCI, and 16 had mild AD. Among MCI and AD, 140 participants had elevated 
amyloid levels by PET or CSF. Plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 provided the best accuracy 
(sensitivity 79%, specificity 66%, AUC 0.73, 95% CI 0.68-0.77) to detect drug 
candidate participants at baseline. Combined plasma Aβ42/40, p-tau181, and 
hippocampal atrophy increased the specificity for diagnosis (96%), but had lower 
sensitivity (34%), and AUC (0.65). Hippocampal atrophy combined with the 
abnormal plasma p-tau181 or hippocampal atrophy alone showed high sensitivity to 
detect clinical progression (by CDR-SB worsening) of the drug-candidate 
participants within the next 2 years (sensitivity 93% and 89%, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Plasma biomarkers and structural MRI can help identify patients who 
are currently eligible for anti-amyloid treatment and are likely to progress 
clinically, in cases where amyloid-PET or CSF biomarkers are not available.

BACKGROUND: Updated prevalence estimates along the continuum of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) can foster a more nuanced and effective approach to managing AD 
within the current healthcare landscape.
OBJECTIVES: This study aims to estimate the prevalence and severity distribution 
of dementia/AD (including mild, moderate, and severe stages) and all-cause mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) in the United States using data from the Health and 
Retirement Study (HRS).
DESIGN: Retrospective study.
SETTING: Data from the bi-annual HRS surveys involving in-depth interviews of a 
representative sample of Americans aged >50 years.
PARTICIPANTS: Dementia/AD and all-cause MCI patients from the 4 most recent HRS 
surveys (2014, 2016, 2018 and 2020).
MEASUREMENTS: AD was identified based on diagnosis (self-report). Cognitive 
performance (modified Telephone Interview of Cognitive Status [TICS-m]) scores 
in the dementia/AD range were also captured; all-cause MCI was similarly 
identified using the TICS-m. Dementia/AD and MCI prevalence, as well as the 
distribution by dementia/AD stage (mild, moderate, or severe), were estimated. 
Sampling weights developed by HRS were applied to ensure the sample's 
representativeness of the target population and unbiased estimates for 
population parameters.
RESULTS: Across the four HRS surveys, the total number of HRS respondents ranged 
from 15,000 to 21,000 (unweighted); 7,000 to 14,000 had TICS-m scores. The 
estimated prevalence of AD (all severity categories combined) in the 2014, 2016, 
2018, and 2020 HRS surveys was 1.2%, 1.2%, 1.3% and 1.0%, respectively using the 
diagnosis-based approach; using the cognitive performance-based approach, 23-27% 
patients had scores in the dementia/AD ranges across the 4 surveys. The 
estimated prevalence of all-cause MCI was consistently 23% in each survey. In 
the 2020 survey, the distribution of mild, moderate, and severe disease stages 
was 34%, 45%, and 21%, respectively, in patients self-reporting an AD diagnosis, 
and 55%, 40%, and 5%, respectively in all patients meeting TICS-m threshold for 
dementia/AD.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of AD diagnosis based on self-report was 
approximately 1% across the 4 most recent HRS surveys and may reflect the 
proportion of patients who have actively sought healthcare for AD. Among HRS 
survey respondents with cognitive scores available, over 20% were in the 
dementia/AD range. The distribution of disease by stage differed for 
self-reported AD diagnosis vs dementia/AD based on cognitive scores. Discordance 
in estimates of dementia/AD and stage distributions underscores a need for 
better understanding of clinical practice patterns in AD diagnosis, use of 
clinical assessment tools, and severity classification in the United States. 
Accurate patient identification is needed, especially early in the AD disease 
continuum, to allow for timely and appropriate initiation of new anti-amyloid 
treatments.

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a diverse group of proteases involved in 
various physiological and pathological processes through modulation of 
extracellular matrix (ECM) components, cytokines, and growth factors. In the 
central nervous system (CNS), MMPs play a major role in CNS development, 
plasticity, repair, and reorganisation contributing to learning, memory, and 
neuroimmune response to injury. MMPs are also linked to various neurological 
disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, cerebral aneurysm, 
stroke, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, and brain cancer suggesting these 
proteases as key regulatory factors in the nervous system. Moreover, MMPs have 
been involved in the pathogenesis of neurotropic viral infections via 
dysregulation of various cellular processes, which may highlight these factors 
as potential targets for the treatment and control of neurological complications 
associated with viral pathogens. This review provides an overview of the roles 
of MMPs in various physiological processes of the CNS and their interactions 
with neurotropic viral pathogens.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a significant cause of disability in adults 
worldwide. However, the underlying causes and mechanisms of MDD are not fully 
understood, and many patients are refractory to available therapeutic options. 
Impaired control of brain mRNA translation underlies several neurodevelopmental 
and neurodegenerative conditions, including autism spectrum disorders and 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nonetheless, a potential role for mechanisms 
associated with impaired translational control in depressive-like behavior 
remains elusive. A key pathway controlling translation initiation relies on the 
phosphorylation of the α subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2α-P) 
which, in turn, blocks the guanine exchange factor activity of eIF2B, thereby 
reducing global translation rates. Here we report that the expression of EIF2B5 
(which codes for eIF2Bε, the catalytic subunit of eIF2B) is reduced in 
postmortem MDD prefrontal cortex from two distinct human cohorts and in the 
frontal cortex of social isolation-induced depressive-like behavior model mice. 
Further, pharmacological treatment with anisomycin or with salubrinal, an 
inhibitor of the eIF2α phosphatase GADD34, induces depressive-like behavior in 
adult C57BL/6J mice. Salubrinal-induced depressive-like behavior is blocked by 
ISRIB, a compound that directly activates eIF2B regardless of the 
phosphorylation status of eIF2α, suggesting that increased eIF2α-P promotes 
depressive-like states. Taken together, our results suggest that impaired 
eIF2-associated translational control may participate in the pathophysiology of 
MDD, and underscore eIF2-eIF2B translational axis as a potential target for the 
development of novel approaches for MDD and related mood disorders.

Alzheimer's disease, a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder in the elderly, is 
characterized by the accumulation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, 
triggering oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and neuronal apoptosis. Current 
therapies focus on symptomatic treatment rather than targeting the underlying 
disease-modifying molecular mechanisms and are often associated with significant 
side effects. Bacopa monnieri, a traditional Indian herb with nootropic 
properties, has shown promise in neurological disorder treatment from ancient 
times. However, its mechanisms of action in Alzheimer's disease remain elusive. 
In this study, a cellular model for Alzheimer's disease was created by treating 
differentiated IMR-32 cells with beta-amyloid, 1-42 peptide (Aβ42). 
Additionally, a recovery model was established through co-treatment with Bacopa 
monnieri to explore its protective mechanism. Co-treatment with Bacopa monnieri 
extract recovered Aβ42 induced damage as evidenced by the decreased apoptosis 
and reduced reactive oxygen species production. Mass spectrometry-based 
quantitative proteomic analysis identified 21,674 peptides, corresponding to 
3626 proteins from the Alzheimer's disease model. The proteins dysregulated by 
Aβ42 were implicated in cellular functions, such as negative regulation of cell 
proliferation and microtubule cytoskeleton organization. The enriched pathways 
include extracellular matrix organization and interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 
signaling. Bacopa monnieri co-treatment showed remarkable restoration of Aβ42 
altered proteins, including FOSL1, and TDO2. The protein-protein interaction 
network analysis of Bacopa monnieri restored proteins identified the hub gene 
involved in Alzheimer's disease. The findings from this study may open up new 
avenues for creating innovative therapeutic approaches for Alzheimer's disease.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease of age with 
no effective preventative or treatment approaches. Deeper understanding of the 
mechanisms underlying the accumulation of toxic β-amyloid oligopeptides and the 
formation of amyloid plaque in AD has the potential to identify new therapeutic 
targets. Prior research links the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system to 
pathologic mechanisms underlying AD. Suppression of local IGF-I receptor (IGFIR) 
signaling in AD mice has been shown to reduce plaque formation in the brain and 
delay neurodegeneration and behavioral changes. However, direct inhibitors of 
IGFIR signaling are not a viable treatment option for AD due to the essentiality 
of the IGFIR in physiological growth and metabolism. We have previously 
demonstrated a more selective means to reduce local IGFIR signaling through 
inhibition of PAPP-A, a novel zinc metalloprotease that regulates local IGF-I 
bioavailability through cleavage of inhibitory IGF binding proteins. Here we 
tested if deletion of PAPP-A in a mouse model of AD provides protection against 
pathology and behavioral changes. We show that compared to AD mice, AD/PAPP-A KO 
mice had significantly less plaque burden, reduced astrocytic activation, 
decreased IGF-IR activity, and improved cognition. Human senile AD plaques 
showed specific immunostaining for PAPP-A. Thus, inhibition of PAPP-A expression 
or activity may represent a novel treatment strategy for AD.

Recent studies have explored the impact of lifestyle, particularly diet, on 
cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk. The Mediterranean diet has 
emerged as a potential safeguard, with observational studies indicating it might 
help defend against cognitive disorders. High adherence is linked with lower 
cognitive impairment risk, while low adherence elevates the risk for AD. Though 
these studies suggest connections between the Mediterranean diet and reduced 
cognitive decline or AD, they do not establish causality. Potential mechanisms 
might involve vascular factors, glucose/lipid metabolism, and anti-inflammatory 
effects. Specific Mediterranean diet components like vegetables, fruits, 
legumes, cereals, fish, and monounsaturated fats might contribute to cognitive 
benefits. Large-scale randomized controlled trials are needed to ascertain the 
diet's influence on AD and cognitive health. Currently, the Mediterranean diet 
cannot be definitively named as a preventive strategy for AD due to insufficient 
evidence. More research is essential to identify key ingredients and processes 
that might have preventive effects on AD. In summary, while the Mediterranean 
diet shows promise against cognitive decline and AD, further research is needed.

The amyloid β peptide (Aβ), starting with pyroglutamate (pE) at position 3 and 
ending at position 42 (Aβ3pE-42), predominantly accumulates in the brains of 
Alzheimer's disease. Consistently, donanemab, a therapeutic antibody raised 
against Aβ3pE-42, has been shown to be effective in recent clinical trials. 
Although the primary Aβ produced physiologically is Aβ1-40/42, an explanation 
for how and why this physiological Aβ is converted to the pathological form 
remains elusive. Here, we present experimental evidence that accounts for the 
aging-associated Aβ3pE-42 deposition: Aβ3pE-42 was metabolically more stable 
than other Aβx-42 variants; deficiency of neprilysin, the major Aβ-degrading 
enzyme, induced a relatively selective deposition of Aβ3pE-42 in both APP 
transgenic and App knock-in mouse brains; Aβ3pE-42 deposition always colocalized 
with Pittsburgh compound B-positive cored plaques in APP transgenic mouse 
brains; and under aberrant conditions, such as a significant reduction in 
neprilysin activity, aminopeptidases, dipeptidyl peptidases, and 
glutaminyl-peptide cyclotransferase-like were up-regulated in the progression of 
aging, and a proportion of Aβ1-42 may be processed to Aβ3pE-42. Our findings 
suggest that anti-Aβ therapies are more effective if given before Aβ3pE-42 
deposition.

Photopharmacology is an emerging method in medicinal chemistry to achieve 
light-controlled drug activity. Azobenzene-based photoswitchable ligands have 
found widespread application as chemical tools in photopharmacological studies. 
This study pioneers the design and synthesis of a novel series of 
photoswitchabled butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibitors, achieved by 
strategically integrating an azo moiety into an N-benzyl benzamide scaffold. 
Through a meticulous investigation of the structure-activity relationship (SAR), 
we discovered that the lead compound, Azo-9, exhibits dynamic cis/trans 
conformational shifts, dynamically modulating its BChE-binding efficacy. This 
unique property translates into potential therapeutic benefits, including 
neuroprotection and cognitive enhancement. Complementary molecular docking 
simulations underscored the preferential binding of the cis-isomer of Azo-9 to 
BChE, which was subsequently validated in a glutamate-mediated neuronal injury 
model. Collectively, Azo-9 emerges as a promising precision tool for Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) therapy, while also facilitating deeper insights into the disease's 
underlying mechanisms.

Hippocampal neurons can be the first to be impaired with neurodegenerative 
disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Most drug candidates for causal 
therapy of AD cannot either enter the brain or accumulate around hippocampal 
neurons. Here, we genetically engineered insulin-fusion proteins, called 
hippocampal neuron-targeting (Ht) proteins, for targeting protein drugs to 
hippocampal neurons because insulin tends to accumulate in the neuronal cell 
layers of the hippocampus. In vitro examinations clarified that insulin and Ht 
proteins were internalized into the cultured hippocampal neurons through insulin 
receptor-mediated macropinocytosis. Cysteines were key determinants of the 
delivery of Ht proteins to hippocampal neurons, and insulin B chain mutant was 
most potent in delivering cargo proteins. In vivo accumulation of Ht proteins to 
hippocampal neuronal layers occurred after intracerebroventricular 
administration. Thus, hippocampal neuron-targeting technology can provide great 
help for developing protein drugs against neurodegenerative disorders.

Neuroprotection, defined as safeguarding neurons from damage and death by 
inhibiting diverse pathological mechanisms, continues to be a promising approach 
for managing a range of central nervous system (CNS) disorders, including acute 
conditions such as ischemic stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI) and chronic 
neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), and multiple sclerosis (MS). These pathophysiological conditions involve 
excessive glutamatergic (Glu) transmission activity, which can lead to 
excitotoxicity. Inhibiting this excessive Glu transmission has been proposed as 
a potential therapeutic strategy for treating the CNS disorders mentioned. In 
particular, ligands of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), including 
metabotropic glutamatergic receptors (mGluRs), have been recognized as promising 
options for inhibiting excessive Glu transmission. This review discusses the 
complex interactions of mGlu receptors with their subtypes, including the 
formation of homo- and heterodimers, which may vary in function and pharmacology 
depending on their protomer composition. Understanding these intricate details 
of mGlu receptor structure and function enhances researchers' ability to develop 
targeted pharmacological interventions, potentially offering new therapeutic 
avenues for neurological and psychiatric disorders. This review also summarizes 
the current knowledge of the neuroprotective potential of ligands targeting 
group III mGluRs in preclinical cellular (in vitro) and animal (in vivo) models 
of ischemic stroke, TBI, PD, AD, and MS. In recent years, experiments have shown 
that compounds, especially those activating mGlu4 or mGlu7 receptors, exhibit 
protective effects in experimental ischemia models. The discovery of allosteric 
ligands for specific mGluR subtypes has led to reports suggesting that group III 
mGluRs may be promising targets for neuroprotective therapy in PD (mGlu4R), TBI 
(mGlu7R), and MS (mGlu8R).

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common forms of neurodegenerative 
dementia. The etiology of AD is multifactorial, and its complex pathophysiology 
involves tau and amyloid-β deposition, increased oxidative stress, 
neuroinflammation, metabolic disorders, and massive neuronal loss. Due to its 
complex pathology, no effective cure for AD has been found to date. Therefore, 
there is an unmet clinical need for the development of new drugs against AD. 
Natural products are known to be good sources of compounds with pharmacological 
activity and have potential for the development of new therapeutic agents. 
Naringin, a naturally occurring flavanone glycoside, is predominantly found in 
citrus fruits and Chinese medicinal herbs. Mounting evidence shows that naringin 
and its aglycone, naringenin, have direct neuroprotective effects on AD, such as 
anti-amyloidogenic, antioxidant, anti-acetylcholinesterase, and 
anti-neuroinflammatory effects, as well as metal chelation. Furthermore, they 
are known to improve disordered glucose/lipid metabolism, which is a high risk 
factor for AD. In this review, we summarize the latest data on the impact of 
naringin and naringenin on the molecular mechanisms involved in AD 
pathophysiology. Additionally, we provide an overview of the current clinical 
applications of naringin and naringenin. The novel delivery systems for naringin 
and naringenin, which can address their widespread pharmacokinetic limitations, 
are also discussed. The literature indicates that naringin and naringenin could 
be multilevel, multitargeted, and multifaceted for preventing and treating AD.

Neurofilaments are structural proteins found in the cytoplasm of neurons, 
particularly in axons, providing structural support and stability to the axon. 
They consist of multiple subunits, including NF-H, NF-M, and NF-L, which form 
long filaments along the axon's length. Neurofilaments are crucial for 
maintaining the shape and integrity of neurons, promoting axonal transport, and 
regulating neuronal function. They are part of the intermediate filament (IF) 
family, which has approximately 70 tissue-specific genes. This diversity allows 
for a customizable cytoplasmic meshwork, adapting to the unique structural 
demands of different tissues and cell types. Neurofilament proteins show 
increased levels in both cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood after neuroaxonal 
damage, indicating injury regardless of the underlying etiology. Precise 
measurement and long-term monitoring of damage are necessary for determining 
prognosis, assessing disease activity, tracking therapeutic responses, and 
creating treatments. These investigations contribute to our understanding of the 
importance of proper NF composition in fundamental neuronal processes and have 
implications for neurological disorders associated with NF abnormalities along 
with its alteration in different animal and human models. Here in this review, 
we have highlighted various neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's, 
Parkinson's, Huntington's, Dementia, and paved the way to use neurofilament as a 
marker in managing neurological disorders.

The blood-brain barrier (BBB) presents a significant challenge in treating 
Alzheimer's disease, as it restricts the delivery of therapeutic medications to 
brain tissue. Reversible breaking of the BBB using low-intensity focused 
ultrasound guided by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may benefit patients with 
Alzheimer's disease and other neurological illnesses, such as brain tumors, 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease. This systematic study 
and meta-analysis aimed to assess aducanumab and the ultrasonography of BBB 
opening in Alzheimer's patients. According to Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), the study was conducted by 
searching six digital repositories for relevant scholarly literature, focusing 
on English papers published between 2015 and 2024; the data was extracted using 
an Excel sheet, and data was analyzed using Revman 5.4.1 software. The study's 
findings indicate that the groups receiving ultrasound and aducanumab treatment 
benefited from it; however, overall, the effect was not statistically 
significant (P=0.29) at 95% CI 0.86 (0.75, 1.00). With regard to side effects, 
the results indicate that the treatment had fewer side effects compared to the 
control group; however, the difference was not statistically significant 
(p=0.94) at 95% CI 0.93 (0.70, 1.22). The study found a positive effect of 
ultrasound and aducanumab on the treatment groups, but it was not statistically 
significant. The control group had less side effects than the treatment group. 
Therefore, future studies should focus on the quantity or combination of the 
drug that yields more effective results.

Effects of obesogenic diet and 17β-estradiol in female mice with APOE 3/3, 3/4, 
and 4/4 genotypes.

The main genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the apolipoprotein 
E ε4 allele (APOE4). AD risk associated with APOE4 disproportionately affects 
women. Furthermore, human and rodent studies indicate that the cognitive 
deficits associated with APOE4 are greater in females. One modifiable AD risk 
factor is obesity during middle age. Given that approximately two-thirds of US 
adults are overweight, it is important to understand how obesity affects AD 
risk, how it interacts with APOE4, and the extent to which its detrimental 
effects can be mitigated with therapeutics. One intervention study for women is 
estrogen-based hormone therapy, which can exert numerous health benefits when 
administered in early middle age. No experimental studies have examined the 
interactions among APOE4, obesity, and hormone therapy in aging females. To 
begin to explore these issues, we considered how obesity outcomes are affected 
by treatment with estradiol at the onset of middle age in female mice with human 
APOE3 and APOE4. Furthermore, to explore how gene dosage affects outcomes, we 
compared mice homozygous for APOE3 (3/3) and homozygous (4/4) or hemizygous 
(3/4) for APOE4. Mice were examined over a 4-month period that spans the 
transition into reproductive senescence, a normal age-related change that models 
many aspects of human perimenopause. Beginning at 5 months of age, mice were 
maintained on a control diet (10% fat) or high-fat diet (HFD; 60% fat). After 
8 weeks, by which time obesity was present in all HFD groups, mice were 
implanted with an estradiol or vehicle capsule that was maintained for the final 
8 weeks. Animals were assessed on a range of metabolic and neural measures. 
Overall, APOE4 was associated with poorer metabolic function and cognitive 
performance. However, an obesogenic diet induced relatively greater impairments 
in metabolic function and cognitive performance in APOE3/3 mice. Estradiol 
treatment improved metabolic and cognitive outcomes across all HFD groups, with 
APOE4/4 generally exhibiting the greatest benefit. APOE3/4 mice were 
intermediate to the homozygous genotypes on many measures but also exhibited 
unique profiles. Together, these findings highlight the importance of the APOE 
genotype as a modulator of the risks associated with obesity and the beneficial 
outcomes of estradiol.

Amyloid-β (Aβ) is a pivotal biomarker in Alzheimer's disease (AD), attracting 
considerable attention from numerous researchers. There is uncertainty regarding 
whether clearing Aβ is beneficial or harmful to cognitive function. This 
question has been a central topic of research, especially given the lack of 
success in developing Aβ-targeted drugs for AD. However, with the Food and Drug 
Administration's approval of Lecanemab as the first anti-Aβ medication in July 
2023, there is a significant shift in perspective on the potential of Aβ as a 
therapeutic target for AD. In light of this advancement, this review aims to 
illustrate and consolidate the molecular structural attributes and pathological 
ramifications of Aβ. Furthermore, it elucidates the determinants influencing its 
expression levels while delineating the gamut of extant Aβ-targeted 
pharmacotherapies that have been subjected to clinical or preclinical 
evaluation. Subsequently, a comprehensive analysis is presented, dissecting the 
research landscape of Aβ across the domains above, culminating in the 
presentation of informed perspectives. Concluding reflections contemplate the 
supplementary advantages conferred by nanoparticle constructs, conceptualized 
within the framework of multivalent theory, within the milieu of AD diagnosis 
and therapeutic intervention, supplementing conventional modalities.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Frontotemporal Dementia 
(FTD), and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are complex and fatal 
neurodegenerative diseases. While current treatments for these diseases do 
alleviate some symptoms, there is an imperative need for novel treatments able 
to stop their progression. For all of these ailments, most cases occur 
sporadically and have no known genetic cause. Only a small percentage of 
patients bear known mutations which occur in a multitude of genes. Hence, it is 
clear that genetic factors alone do not explain disease occurrence. Chromatin, a 
DNA-histone complex whose basic unit is the nucleosome, is divided into 
euchromatin, an open form accessible to the transcriptional machinery, and 
heterochromatin, which is closed and transcriptionally inactive. Protruding out 
of the nucleosome, histone tails undergo post-translational modifications (PTMs) 
including methylation, acetylation, and phosphorylation which occur at specific 
residues and are connected to different chromatin structural states and regulate 
access to transcriptional machinery. Epigenetic mechanisms, including histone 
PTMs and changes in chromatin structure, could help explain neurodegenerative 
disease processes and illuminate novel treatment targets. Recent research has 
revealed that changes in histone PTMs and heterochromatin loss or gain are 
connected to neurodegeneration. Here, we review evidence for epigenetic changes 
occurring in AD, PD, and FTD/ALS. We focus specifically on alterations in the 
histone PTMs landscape, changes in the expression of histone modifying enzymes 
and chromatin remodelers as well as the consequences of these changes in 
heterochromatin structure. We also highlight the potential for epigenetic 
therapies in neurodegenerative disease treatment. Given their reversibility and 
pharmacological accessibility, epigenetic mechanisms provide a promising avenue 
for novel treatments. Altogether, these findings underscore the need for 
thorough characterization of epigenetic mechanisms and chromatin structure in 
neurodegeneration.

An Autopsy Case of Renal-Limited Granulomatosis With Polyangiitis Presenting 
With Acute Renal Failure and Initial Delirium.

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) has three clinicopathological features, 
namely, necrotizing granulomatosis of the upper respiratory tract and lungs, 
focal segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis of the kidney, and necrotizing 
vasculitis of small vessels throughout the body. A 92-year-old man with 
clinically diagnosed probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) exhibited subacute 
deterioration in cognitive function. On admission, he was diagnosed with acute 
renal failure with an elevated creatinine level (5.48 mg/dL) as well as severe 
disturbance of consciousness. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) 
directed against proteinase 3 (PR3-ANCA) were highly positive with ≥ 350 U/mL. 
The patient was diagnosed with GPA and was managed with steroid pulse therapy. 
However, he died without any improvement in renal function. As a result of the 
autopsy, the patient was diagnosed with definite AD, and his impaired 
consciousness was found not to be caused by central nervous system involvement 
due to GPA. As necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis was observed, the cause 
of the acute progressive renal failure was found to be PR3-ANCA-positive GPA. 
The autopsy revealed no GPA-related lesions in other parts of the body aside 
from the kidneys. It is rare to encounter cases of PR3-ANCA-positive GPA with 
renal-limited vasculitis and acute renal failure as the initial manifestation, 
as in the present case. Making an accurate clinical diagnosis of older patients 
suffering from various diseases in multiple organs is challenging. Although 
autopsy has the limitation of a terminal image, it is extremely useful in 
elucidating the pathophysiology of the older patient in this case.

Measuring Cognition in Clinical Trials in Parkinson's Disease, Dementia with 
Lewy Bodies, and Related Disorders: Roundtable Proceedings and Roadmap for 
Research.

Emerging research suggests that Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy 
bodies (DLB) share underlying pathology and may represent a single, biologically 
defined disease spectrum. Cognitive changes are among the most worrisome 
symptoms for patients with PD, and are the core feature of DLB. While the 
cognitive changes experienced by individuals with PD and mild cognitive 
impairment share some clinical characteristics with patients who have 
undiagnosed or prodromal DLB, these changes are distinct from other types of 
dementias, such as Alzheimer's disease. To spur the adaptation of existing 
cognition-focused measures and the development of new ones to underlie clinical 
trial endpoints in PD and DLB, the PD/DLB Cognition Roundtable was held on 
January 10 and 11, 2024, in Washington, D.C. The roundtable brought together 
representatives from academia and industry, as well as with representatives of 
regulatory agencies, community partners, patient advocates, and research 
funders, to build consensus and collaborate on the outcome assessment and trial 
design methods that will support the development of new treatments for early or 
mild cognitive changes in disorders on the PD/DLB spectrum. The authors of this 
document summarize the roundtable, discussing the state of the field for 
clinical trial design and cognition measures in PD and DLB, promising avenues of 
research, and perspectives of regulatory agencies.

Evodiamine (EVO) is a tryptamine indole alkaloid and the main active ingredient 
in Evodia rutaecarpa. In recent years, the antitumor, cardioprotective, 
anti-inflammatory, and anti-Alzheimer's disease effects of EVO have been 
reported. EVO exerts antitumor effects by inhibiting tumor cell activity and 
proliferation, blocking the cell cycle, promoting apoptosis and autophagy, and 
inhibiting the formation of the tumor microvasculature. However, EVO has poor 
solubility and low bioavailability. Several derivatives with high antitumor 
activity have been discovered through the structural optimization of EVO, and 
new drug delivery systems have been developed to improve the solubility and 
bioavailability of EVO. Current research found that EVO could have toxic 
effects, such as hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and cardiac toxicity. This 
article reviews the pharmacological activity, derivatives, drug delivery 
systems, toxicity, and pharmacokinetics of EVO and provides research ideas and 
references for its further in-depth development and clinical applications.

University, Seoul, 06974 Republic of Korea.

This study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of cerebroprotein 
hydrolysate (CPH) against oxidative stress-induced HT22 cell death. 
Additionally, the effect of antioxidants such as quercetin (QC) and 
N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) on the neuroprotective activity of CPH was evaluated. 
The mouse-derived hippocampal neuronal cell line HT22 was pretreated with CPH or 
a mixture of CPH and QC or NAC. HT22 cell death was induced by either 10 mM 
glutamate, 2.5 μM amyloid-β (Aβ)25-35, and 300 μM cobalt chloride (CoCl2). As 
results, CPH effectively alleviated HT22 cell death induced by glutamate, 
Aβ25-35, and CoCl2. In addition, CPH combination with QC augmented cell 
viability in both glutamate- and Aβ25-35-stressed conditions but had no synergic 
effect on the CoCl2-stressed condition. The synergic effect of CPH and NAC 
combination was observed under all cell death conditions. The neuroprotective 
actions of CPH and its combinations with QC or NAC against various oxidative 
stress-induced HT22 cell deaths were demonstrated, providing a promising 
strategy for developing CPH preparations for the prevention and/or treatment of 
neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease 
(AD) and has no treatment that can cure or halt the disease progression. This 
study explored the therapeutic potential of lithium salt dissolved in Ryanodex 
formulation vehicle (RFV) and delivered to the brain by intranasal application. 
We first compared lithium concentrations in the brain and blood of wild-type 
mice following intranasal or oral administration of lithium chloride (LiCl) 
dissolved in either RFV or water. The beneficial and side effects of intranasal 
versus oral LiCl in RFV in these mice were assessed and potential mechanisms 
underlying the efficacy of anti-inflammation and anti-pyroptosis in the brains 
were also investigated in both wild-type (WT) and 5XFAD Alzheimer's Disease (AD) 
mice brains.
METHODS: For the study of brain versus blood lithium concentrations, WT 
B6SJLF1/J mice at 2 months of age were treated with intranasal or oral LiCl (3 
mmol/kg) dissolved in RFV or in water. Brain and blood lithium concentrations 
were measured at various times after drugs administration. Brain/blood lithium 
concentration ratios were then determined. For studying therapeutic efficacy 
versus side effects and their underlying mechanisms, 5XFAD and WT B6SJLF1/J mice 
were treated with intranasal LiCl (3 mmol/kg) daily, Monday to Friday each week, 
in RFV beginning at 2 or 9 months of age with a 12-week treatment duration. 
Animal behaviors were assessed for depression (tail suspension), cognition (fear 
conditioning and Y maze), olfaction (buried food test), and motor functions 
(rotarod) at the age of 5 and 12 months. Blood and brain tissue were harvested 
from these mice at 13 months. Blood biomarkers for the functions of thyroid 
(thyroid stimulating hormone, TSH) and kidney (creatinine) were measured using 
ELISA. Changes in protein expression levels of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ 
release channels type 1 InsP3 receptors (InsP3R-1), malondialdehyde 
(MDA)-modified proteins and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE), pyroptosis regulatory 
proteins (NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), cleaved caspase-1, 
N-terminal of Gasdermin D (GSDMD)), cytotoxic (IL-1β, IL-18, IL-6, TNF-α) and 
cytoprotective (IL-10) cytokines and synapse proteins (PSD-95, synapsin-1) were 
determined using immunoblotting. Mouse body weights were monitored regularly.
RESULTS: Compared to oral LiCl in RFV nanoparticles, intranasal treatment of WT 
mice with LiCl in RFV markedly decreased blood concentrations at the time frame 
of 30-120 minutes. The ratio of brain/blood lithium concentration after 
Intranasal lithium chloride in RFV significantly increased, in comparison to 
those after oral administration lithium chloride in RFV or intranasal 
administration of lithium chloride in water. Intranasal lithium chloride in RFV 
inhibited both memory loss and depressive behavior in adult and aged 5XFAD mice. 
Additionally intranasal treatment of aged 5XFAD mice with LiCl in RFV 
effectively suppressed the increases in InsP3R-1, intracellular oxidative stress 
markers (4-HNE-bound and MDA-modified proteins), pyroptosis activation proteins 
(NLRP3, cleaved caspase-1, N-terminal GSDMD) and cytotoxic cytokines (IL-1β, 
IL-6, TNF-α), but reversed the down-regulation of cytoprotective cytokine IL-10. 
Intranasal LiCl in RFV also alleviated the loss of the postsynaptic synapse 
protein PSD-95, but not synapsin-1, in aged 5XFAD mice. Blood level of the 
kidney function marker creatinine was significantly increased in 5XFAD than in 
WT mice in an age-dependent manner and this elevation was abolished by 
intranasal delivery of LiCl in RFV. Intranasal LiCl in RFV for 12 weeks in both 
WT or 5XFAD mice did not affect blood biomarkers for thyroid function, nor did 
it affect smell or muscle function or body weight.
CONCLUSION: Intranasal administration of LiCl in RFV significantly decreased 
lithium blood concentrations and increased brain/blood lithium concentration 
ratio, in comparison to its oral administration. Intranasal administration of 
LiCl in RFV robustly protected against both memory loss and depressive-like 
behavior, while had no side effects concerning thyroid and kidney toxicity in 
5XFAD mice. These lithium-induced beneficial effects were strongly associated 
with lithium's suppression of InsP3R-1 Ca2+ channel receptor increase, 
pathological neuroinflammation and activation of the pyroptosis pathway, as well 
as the loss of some synaptic proteins. Intranasal delivery of lithium salt in 
RFV could become an effective and potent inhibitor of pathological 
inflammation/pyroptosis in the CNS and serve as a new treatment for both 
AD-associated dementia and depression with minimal unwanted side effects 
including peripheral organ toxicity.

Medin Induces Pro-Inflammatory Activation of Human Brain Vascular Smooth Muscle 
Cells.

Karamanova N, Morrow KT, Maerivoet A, Madine J, Li M, Migrino RQ.

Update in
    Physiol Rep. 2025 Jun;13(11):e70418. doi: 10.14814/phy2.70418.

BACKGROUND: Medin is one of the most common amyloidogenic proteins and 
accumulates in the vasculature with aging. Vascular medin accumulation is 
associated with Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia and aortic aneurysms. 
Medin impairs smooth muscle-dependent vasodilation in isolated human brain 
cerebral arteries. The role of medin in vascular smooth muscle (VSMC) activation 
is unknown. We aim to evaluate the effects of medin on human brain VSMC 
activation.
METHODS: VSMCs were exposed to physiologic doses of medin (0.5, 1 and 5 µM) 
without or with small molecule nuclear factor-κB (NFκB) inhibitor RO106-9920 (10 
µM) for 20 hours. Polymerase chain reaction, Western blot/enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay were used to quantify gene and protein 
expressions/secretions, respectively, of pro-inflammatory factors (interleukin 
(IL)-6, IL-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1) and structural and 
enzyme proteins associated with VSMC phenotypic transformation (smooth muscle 
actin alpha 2 (ACTA2), myosin heavy chain 11 (MYH11) and NADPH oxidase 4 
(NOX4)).
RESULTS: Medin exposure increased VSMC gene expression and protein secretion of 
IL-6, IL-8 and MCP-1 (protein secretion 46.0±12.8x, 20.2±4.1x and 8.7±3.1x, 
respectively, medin 5 µM versus vehicle, all p<0.05). There was no change in 
gene or protein expressions of ACTA2, MYH11 and NOX4. Co-treatment with 
RO106-9920 reduced medin-induced increases in IL-6 and IL-8 and a trend towards 
reduced MCP-1 secretion.
CONCLUSIONS: Medin induced pro-inflammatory activation of human brain VSMCs that 
is mediated, at least in part, by NFκB. Acute medin treatment did not alter 
structural proteins involved in VSMC phenotypic transformation. The findings 
support medin as a potential novel mediator of and therapeutic target for 
vascular aging pathology.

Acute increase of protein O-GlcNAcylation in mice leads to transcriptome changes 
in the brain opposite to what is observed in Alzheimer's Disease.

Bell M, Kane MS, Ouyang X, Young ME, Jegga AG, Chatham JC, Darley-Usmar V, Zhang 
J.

Enhancing protein O-GlcNAcylation by pharmacological inhibition of the enzyme 
O-GlcNAcase (OGA) is explored as a strategy to decrease tau and amyloid-beta 
phosphorylation, aggregation, and pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD). There 
is still more to be learned about the impact of enhancing global protein 
O-GlcNAcylation, which is important for understanding the mechanistic path of 
using OGA inhibition to treat AD. In this study, we investigated the acute 
effect of pharmacologically increasing O-GlcNAc levels, using OGA inhibitor 
Thiamet G (TG), on normal mouse brains. We hypothesized that the transcritome 
signature in respones to TG treatment provides a comprehensive view of the 
effect of OGA inhibition. We sacrificed the mice and dissected their brains 
after 3 hours of saline or 50 mg/kg TG treatment, and then performed mRNA 
sequencing using NovaSeq PE 150 (n=5 each group). We identified 1,234 
significant differentially expressed genes with TG versus saline treatment. 
Functional enrichment analysis of the upregulated genes identified several 
upregulated pathways, including genes normally down in AD. Among the 
downregulated pathways were the cell adhesion pathway as well as genes normally 
up in AD and aging. When comparing acute to chronic TG treatment, protein 
autophosphorylation and kinase activity pathways were upregulated, whereas cell 
adhesion and astrocyte markers were downregulated in both datasets. 
Interestingly, mitochondrial genes and genes normally down in AD were up in 
acute treatment and down in chronic treatment. Data from this analysis will 
enable the evaluation of the mechanisms underlying the potential benefits of OGA 
inhibition in the treatment of AD. In particular, although OGA inhibitors are 
promising to treat AD, their downstream chronic effects related to bioenergetics 
may be a limiting factor.

Transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) channels are widely expressed in 
the brain; however, their precise roles in neurodegeneration, such as 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain elusive. Bioinformatic analysis of the published 
single-cell RNA-seq data collected from AD patient cohorts indicates that the 
Trpc3 gene is uniquely upregulated in excitatory neurons. TRPC3 expression is 
also upregulated in post-mortem AD brains, and in both acute and chronic mouse 
models of AD. Functional screening of TRPC3 antagonists resulted in a lead 
inhibitor JW-65, which completely rescued Aβ-induced neurotoxicity, impaired 
synaptic plasticity (e.g., LTP), and learning memory in acute and chronic 
experimental AD models. In cultured rat hippocampal neurons, we found that 
treatment with soluble β-amyloid oligomers (AβOs) induces rapid and sustained 
upregulation of the TRPC3 expression selectively in excitatory neurons. This 
aberrantly upregulated TRPC3 contributes to AβOs-induced Ca2+ overload through 
the calcium entry and store-release mechanisms. The neuroprotective action of 
JW-65 is primarily mediated via restoring AβOs-impaired Ca2+/calmodulin-mediated 
signaling pathways, including calmodulin kinases CaMKII/IV and calcineurin 
(CaN). The synaptic protective mechanism via TRPC3 inhibition was further 
supported by hippocampal RNA-seq data from the symptomatic 5xFAD mice after 
chronic treatment with JW-65. Overall, these findings not only validate TRPC3 as 
a novel therapeutic target for treating synaptic dysfunction of AD but most 
importantly, disclose a distinct role of upregulated TRPC3 in AD pathogenesis in 
mediating Ca2+ dyshomeostasis.

INTRODUCTION: Rare variants in ABCA1 increase the risk of developing Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). ABCA1 facilitates the lipidation of apolipoprotein E (apoE). This 
study investigated whether microRNA-33 (miR-33)-mediated regulation of this 
ABCA1-APOE pathway affects phenotypes of an amyloid mouse model.
METHODS: We generated mir-33+/+;APP/PS1 and mir-33-/-;APP/PS1 mice to determine 
changes in amyloid pathology using biochemical and histological analyses. We 
used RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry to identify the transcriptomic and 
proteomic changes between our genotypes. We also performed mechanistic 
experiments by determining the role of miR-33 in microglial migration and 
amyloid beta (Aβ) phagocytosis.
RESULTS: Mir-33 deletion increases ABCA1 levels and reduces Aβ accumulation and 
glial activation. Multi-omics studies suggested miR-33 regulates the activation 
and migration of microglia. We confirm that the inhibition of miR-33 
significantly increases microglial migration and Aβ phagocytosis.
DISCUSSION: These results suggest that miR-33 might be a potential drug target 
by modulating ABCA1 level, apoE lipidation, Aβ level, and microglial function.
HIGHLIGHTS: Loss of microRNA-33 (miR-33) increased ABCA1 protein levels and the 
lipidation of apolipoprotein E. Loss of miR-33 reduced amyloid beta (Aβ) levels, 
plaque deposition, and gliosis. mRNAs and proteins dysregulated by miR-33 loss 
relate to microglia and Alzheimer's disease. Inhibition of miR-33 increased 
microglial migration and Aβ phagocytosis in vitro.

Significance: Reduction-oxidation (redox) regulation is an important biological 
phenomenon that provides a balance between antioxidants and the generation of 
reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species under pathophysiological 
conditions. Structural and functional changes in glycans are also important as 
post-translational modifications of proteins. The integration of glycobiology 
and redox biology, called glyco-redox has provided new insights into the 
mechanisms of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)/mesenchymal-epithelial 
transition (MET), cancer, and various diseases including Alzheimer's disease, 
chronic obstructive lung disease, type 2 diabetes, interstitial pneumonitis, and 
ulcerative colitis. Recent Advances: Glycans are biosynthesized by specific 
glycosyltransferases and each glycosyltransferase is either directly or 
indirectly regulated by oxidative stress and redox regulation. A typical example 
of glyco-redox is the role of N-glycan referred to as core fucose in superoxide 
dismutase 3. This glycan was found to be involved in the growth inhibition of 
cancer cell lines. Critical Issues: The significance of glyco-redox in EMT/MET, 
cancer, and various diseases was found in major N-glycan branching 
glycosyltransferases β1,4N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III, 
β1,4N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase IV, β1,6N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V, 
β1,4-acetylglucosaminyltransfearfse VI, β1,6-acetylglucosaminyltransferase IX, 
α-1,6 fucosyltransferase, and β-galactoside α-2,6-sialyltransferase 1. Herein, 
we summarize previous reports on target proteins and how this relates to 
oxidative stress. We also discuss the products of these processes and their 
significance to cancer and various diseases. Future Direction: A clear-cut 
understanding of the significance of glyco-redox in relation to prevention, 
diagnosis, and therapeutics is required. These studies will open a new road 
toward glycobiology and redox biology. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 41, 910-926.
