OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to assess the impact of the pandemic 
on the health, well-being, and access to services of paid staff and unpaid 
caregivers of persons living with dementia.
DESIGN: Questionnaires were developed to capture the experiences of paid staff 
and unpaid caregivers throughout the pandemic, leveraging a pre-existing 
clinical trial collaborative.
SETTING: Community and long-term care locations in Miami, Florida, Boston, 
Massachusetts, and the greater Baltimore, Maryland, and D.C. areas.
PARTICIPANTS: Paid staff from Miami Jewish and Benchmark who worked with 
patients with dementia during the first two years of the pandemic. Unpaid 
caregivers who lived within the catchment area of the study sites and provided 
care for community-based persons with dementia.
MEASUREMENTS: Measures included the Coronavirus Impact Scale, the Herth Hope 
Index, NPI-Q, the Modified Caregiver Strain Index, PHQ-8, items about workplace 
changes, caregiving relationship, and changes to caregiver support.
RESULTS: Paid staff were statistically more likely to have been exposed to, 
tested for, hospitalized, or seriously ill with COVID-19 and indicated moderate 
to severe impacts to medical and mental health services compared to unpaid 
caregivers. Unpaid caregivers exhibited significantly higher rates of depressive 
symptom severity and overall lower scores on the Herth Hope Scale compared to 
paid staff.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the pandemic had significant impacts on 
the mental health and general well-being of unpaid caregivers. While notable 
that paid staff suffered from increased exposure and decreased access to 
services, policies supporting both workforces should respond to the unique 
outcomes that each faced, post-pandemic.

Accurate and early disease detection is crucial for improving patient care, but 
traditional diagnostic methods often fail to identify diseases in their early 
stages, leading to delayed treatment outcomes. Early diagnosis using blood 
derivatives as a source for biomarkers is particularly important for managing 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study introduces a novel approach for the precise 
and ultrasensitive detection of multiple core AD biomarkers (Aβ40, Aβ42, p-tau, 
and t-tau) using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) combined with 
machine-learning algorithms. Our method employs an antibody-immobilized aluminum 
SERS substrate, which offers high precision, sensitivity, and accuracy. The 
platform achieves an impressive detection limit in the attomolar (aM) range and 
spans a wide dynamic range from aM to micromolar (μM) concentrations. This 
ultrasensitive and specific SERS immunoassay platform shows promise for 
identifying mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a potential precursor to AD, from 
blood plasma. Machine-learning algorithms applied to the spectral data enhance 
the differentiation of MCI from AD and healthy controls, yielding excellent 
sensitivity and specificity. Our integrated SERS-machine-learning approach, with 
its interpretability, advances AD research and underscores the effectiveness of 
a cost-efficient, easy-to-prepare Al-SERS substrate for clinical AD detection.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with amyloid production and buildup in 
the brain, leading to neurodegeneration. In this study, we used a 
solvent-thermal technique to produce light-sensitive carbon nanodots (L-CNDs). 
L-CNDs exhibit outstanding photocatalytic properties, producing singlet oxygen 
(1O2) under 630 nm irradiation. L-CNDs have a high photothermal conversion 
efficiency of 68.25 % under 808 nm irradiation, allowing for localized heating 
and regulation of Aβ aggregation. L-CNDs bind Aβ through hydrophobic interaction 
and π-π stacking. L-CNDs inhibit Aβ aggregation with efficiencies of 61.08 %, 
75.09 %, and 91.72 % at 10 μg·mL-1 in photothermal therapy (PTT), photodynamic 
therapy (PDT), and PTT/PDT synergistic therapy, respectively. L-CNDs efficiently 
suppress Aβ misfolding, inhibit fibrillation, and promote disaggregation of 
mature fibrils. L-CNDs mitigate Aβ-induced cytotoxicity in PC12 and HT22 cells. 
Interestingly, the data showed that 84.6 % of the L-CNDs could penetrate bEnd.3 
cells after 8 h of treatment, demonstrating that they have the capacity to cross 
the blood-brain barrier (BBB) because of their small size. In vitro 
investigations have shown that L-CNDs can pass through the BBB. Collectively, 
our findings reveal a unique technique for treating amyloid disorders using 
carbon nanodots with significant potential for future studies in this area.

The presence of aggregated Tau in the brain is a dominant pathological hallmark 
of Tauopathies, particularly in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, developing 
ligands that can specifically and sensitively bind to Tau aggregates is 
essential for diagnosing and monitoring therapeutic interventions. In this 
study, we further investigated the structural optimization of the diarylamine 
skeleton, which exhibited promising binding characteristics and biological 
properties. We supplementarily explored the effects of the number and position 
of nitrogen atoms, types of heteroatoms and aromatic moieties, and radioactive 
positions on affinity for Tau. Through a structure-activity relationship (SAR) 
analysis based on 125I-labeled diarylamine derivatives, [125I]A6 was identified 
as a lead compound due to its desirable binding properties and ability to 
penetrate the brain, making it suitable for conversion into a18F-labeled PET 
tracer. Satisfactorily, [18F]FA1 fulfilled critical requirements as a Tau 
radiotracer, demonstrating high specificity and selectivity for Tau, a clean 
off-target profile against Aβ plaques and monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B), and 
favorable in vivo brain kinetics, as confirmed by dynamic PET studies in rodents 
and non-human primates.

As a traditional drug-food homologous plant, Dendrobium officinale is widely 
recognized for its nutritional and medicinal value. Specifically, D. officinale 
polysaccharide (DOP) has garnered attention as a potential prebiotic for its 
protective effects on gut microbiota and the nervous system. However, the 
underlying mechanism by which DOP improves cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) remains unclear. This study intends to elucidate the beneficial 
effects of DOP on AD mice from the perspectives of metabolomics and the 
intestinal microbiome. The results showed that DOP significantly ameliorated 
cognitive dysfunction, attenuated hippocampal neuronal damage and Aβ plaque 
deposition, and restored intestinal barrier integrity in AD mice. The 
antibiotic-cocktail-induced germ-free mouse model confirmed that the 
neuroprotective effect of DOP was dependent on gut microbiota. Further 
investigations demonstrated that DOP influenced the composition of gut 
microbiota and restored its diversity. Additionally, DOP reshaped metabolic 
profile disorders in AD mice and increased the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) 
content. Correlation analysis further highlighted that specific gut microbiota 
was associated with the metabolism of AD mice. In conclusion, this study sheds 
light on the positive impact of DOP in reshaping the gut microbiota and 
enhancing cognitive function, offering important perspectives for the possible 
advancement and utilization of DOP.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by cognitive decline and memory loss, 
involving mechanisms such as tau hyperphosphorylation and mitochondrial 
dysfunction. Increasing evidence suggests that age-related alterations in 
metabolite levels are crucial for the pathogenesis of AD. Here, we analyzed 
serum metabolites from mice of various ages (2, 4, 14, and 21 months old) using 
mass spectrometry. We identified palmitoyl-L-carnitine as a key metabolite with 
significantly increased levels in aged mice. In vitro experiments with SH-SY5Y 
neuronal cells demonstrated that palmitoyl-L-carnitine treatment enhanced tau 
phosphorylation, increased mitochondrial fission, and elevated intracellular 
calcium levels. Furthermore, the increased levels of tau phosphorylation were 
significantly reduced by the inhibition of GSK-3β, CDK5, and calpain, indicating 
that tau kinases activated by calcium overload are directly involved in the 
increase of tau phosphorylation. Considering that mitochondrial fission is 
related to mitochondrial dysfunction, we propose that the elevated level of 
serum palmitoyl-L-carnitine during aging contributes to AD pathology through 
these pathways. These findings highlight the significant role of lipid 
metabolism in neurodegeneration and offer potential therapeutic targets for 
age-related diseases, including AD.

BACKGROUND: Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias are more 
frequently exposed to polymedication, mainly due to the presence of 
comorbidities, are particularly vulnerable to drug-related problems, and present 
greater risk of adverse effects due to drug-drug interactions (DDIs).
PURPOSE: To assess the prevalence of clinically relevant interactions in 
dementia patients using a routine database, we describe the most frequent 
interactions and risk factors associated with them to facilitate specific 
interventions and programs to prevent and minimize them.
METHODS: An observational, descriptive, and cross-sectional study that included 
patients with AD and other types of dementia (n = 100, 64% female) was conducted 
to identify potential DDI in their treatment using the Lexi-Interact/Lexicomp® 
database.
RESULTS: A total of 769 drugs were prescribed, involving 190 different active 
ingredients; 83% of the treatments included five or more drugs. DDI occurred in 
87% of the patients, of which 63.2% were female. A total of 689 DDIs were found, 
grouped in 448 drug pairs, with a mean of 6.9 ± 7.1 (range, 0-31) DDIs per 
patient, and 680 DDIs were considered clinically relevant. It was observed that 
89.8% of the DDIs had a moderate level of severity, 23.5% had a good level of 
relevance, and pharmacodynamic-based DDIs accounted for 89.5%. The drugs most 
frequently involved in DDIs were quetiapine (24.5%) and acetylsalicylic acid 
(10%). A total of 97 DDIs were detected between the acetylcholinesterase 
inhibitors (AChEIs), and the remaining drugs were administered concomitantly. 
One of the most frequent DDIs was between AChEIs and beta-blocking agents (n = 
29, 4.3%). The most important factors that showed the strongest association with 
the presence of drug interactions were the use of AChEIs (p = 0.01) and the 
total number of drugs (p = 0.014) taken by the patient.
CONCLUSION: Patients with dementia present increased risk of DDIs. Among the 
most common drugs are psychotropic drugs, which are involved in pharmacodynamic 
interactions caused by the concomitant use of CNS-targeted drugs. The results 
highlight the difficulty to evaluate DDIs in clinical practice due to 
polymedication and variety of comorbidities. Therefore, it is important to 
review their treatment and consider metabolism inhibition or induction, and 
potentially P450 substrate overlapping.

Dementia encompasses a spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders significantly 
impacting global health, with environmental factors increasingly recognized as 
crucial in their etiology. Among these, ozone, has been identified as a 
potential exacerbator of neurodegenerative processes, particularly in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Ozone exposure induces the production of reactive 
oxygen species (ROS), which penetrate the BBB, leading to oxidative damage in 
neuronal cells. This oxidative stress is closely linked with mitochondrial 
dysfunction and lipid peroxidation, processes that are foundational to the 
pathology observed in dementia, such as neuronal death and protein aggregation. 
Furthermore, ozone triggers chronic neuroinflammation, exacerbating these 
neurodegenerative processes and perpetuating a cycle of CNS damage. Recent 
studies highlight the role of peripheral biomarkers like High Mobility Group Box 
1 (HMGB1) and Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) in 
mediating ozone's effects. Disruption of these and other identified proteins by 
ozone exposure impairs microglial function and response to amyloid plaques, 
suggesting a novel pathway through which ozone may influence AD pathology via 
immune dysregulation. This review discusses the concept of a bidirectional 
lung-brain axis, illustrating that systemic responses to air pollutants like 
ozone may reflect and contribute to neurodegenerative processes in the CNS. By 
delineating these mechanisms, we emphasize the critical need for integrating 
environmental health management into strategies for the prevention and treatment 
of dementia.

The major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), APOE4, accelerates 
beta-amyloid (Aβ) plaque formation, but whether this is caused by APOE expressed 
in microglia or astrocytes is debated. We express here the human APOE isoforms 
in astrocytes in an Apoe-deficient AD mouse model. This is not only sufficient 
to restore the amyloid plaque pathology but also induces the characteristic 
transcriptional pathological responses in Apoe-deficient microglia surrounding 
the plaques. We find that both APOE4 and the protective APOE2 from astrocytes 
increase fibrillar plaque deposition, but differentially affect soluble Aβ 
aggregates. Microglia and astrocytes show specific alterations in function of 
APOE genotype expressed in astrocytes. Our experiments indicate a central role 
of the astrocytes in APOE mediated amyloid plaque pathology and in the induction 
of associated microglia responses.

The therapeutic options for Alzheimer's disease (AD) are limited, underscoring 
the critical need for finding an effective regulator of Aβ42 production. In this 
study, with 489 human postmortem brains, we revealed that homotrimer G protein 
subunit gamma 5 (GNG5) expression is upregulated in the hippocampal-entorhinal 
region of pathological AD compared with normal controls, and is positively 
correlated with Aβ pathology. In vivo and in vitro experiments confirm that 
increased GNG5 significantly promotes Aβ pathology and Aβ42 production. 
Mechanically, GNG5 regulates the cleavage preference of γ-secretase towards Aβ42 
by directly interacting with the γ-secretase catalytic subunit presenilin 1 
(PS1). Moreover, excessive GNG5 increases the protein levels and the activation 
of Rab5, leading to the increased number of early endosomes, the major cellular 
organelle for production of Aβ42. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation and 
immunofluorescence revealed co-interaction of Aβ42 with GPCR family CXCR2, which 
is known as the receptor for IL-8, thus facilitating the dissociation of 
G-proteins βγ from α subunits. Treatment of Aβ42 in neurons combined with 
structure prediction indicated Aβ42 oligomers as a new ligand of CXCR2, 
upregulating γ subunit GNG5 protein levels. The co-localizations of GNG5 and 
PS1, CXCR2 and Aβ42 were verified in eight human brain regions. Besides, GNG5 is 
significantly reduced in extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from cerebral 
cortex or serum of AD patients compared with healthy cognition controls. In 
brief, GNG5 is a novel regulator of Aβ42 production, suggesting its clinical 
potential as a diagnosis biomarker and the therapeutic target for AD. The GNG5 
content in EVs derived from serum and brain tissue of patients with AD 
significantly reduced. The GNG5 expression in the hippocampal-entorhinal neurons 
of donors with pathological AD significantly increased, and can exist in 
homotrimer subtypes. GNG5 expression positively correlates with Aβ pathology and 
Aβ42 production. Homotrimer-GNG5 binds to the γ-secretase catalytic subunit PS1 
and preferentially generates Aβ42 in early endosome. GNG5 leads to enhanced Rab5 
protein and activation levels, increased number of early endosome, promoting 
Aβ42 production. Further, Aβ42 binds to CXCR2 to upregulate GNG5 levels in a 
feedback loop.

Neurodegenerative diseases, as common diseases in the elderly, tend to become 
younger due to environmental changes, social development and other factors. They 
are mainly characterized by progressive loss or dysfunction of neurons in the 
central or peripheral nervous system, and common diseases include Parkinson's 
disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease and so on. Mitochondria are 
important organelles for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production in the brain. 
In recent years, a large amount of evidence has shown that mitochondrial 
dysfunction plays a direct role in neurodegenerative diseases, which is expected 
to provide new ideas for the treatment of related diseases. This review will 
summarize the main mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction in neurodegenerative 
diseases, as well as collating recent advances in the study of mitochondrial 
disorders and new therapies.

potential as potent foreseeable biomarkers for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's 
disease: A systematic review.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's Disease is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by 
accumulation of phosphorylated tau and amyloid deposits within the brain tissues 
in the elderly population. Numerous studies established that amassment of these 
toxic accretions within the brain tissues initiates neuronal demise and synaptic 
impairment which becomes the underlying basis for memory loss and cognitive 
abnormalities in these patients.
HYPOTHESIS: Hypoxia, oxidative stress, and inflammation are commonly encountered 
perils in the neuronal milieu that derail the neuron-synapse interactions and 
maneuver them to undergo apoptosis. A spinoff from neuronal desecration is 
microglial activation which forms a cardinal role in mounting innate immune 
defenses for warding off and reversing off toxic stimulus encountered.
RESULTS: A potential ramification of microglial activation in this context is 
assembly, processing and exuding of micro-vesicles into the extracellular space. 
These micro-vesicles will be packaged with amyloid and tau deposits which 
accumulate intracellularly within microglial cells secondary to their 
professional scavenging function. These microglial MVs are prone to seed tau and 
amyloid beta into the surrounding neuron-synapse framework, thus are implicated 
in spreading the disease pathology in AD.
CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, these MVs can be considered as an omen for disease 
initiation, progression, monitoring as well gauging the treatment response in 
the clinical AD cohorts. We speculate future research studies to unmask the 
dormant potential of these microglial MVs as reliable markers for diagnosis, 
evaluating the disease progression as well as treatment in AD. This will open 
the door for early diagnosis of AD so as to prioritize management and optimize 
clinical outcomes..

The aggregation of Amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides is associated with neurodegeneration 
in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We previously identified novel naphtalene 
derivatives, including the lead compound Amylovis-201, able to form 
thermodynamically stable complexes with Aβ species, peptides and fibrils. As the 
drug showed a chemical scaffold coherent for an effective interaction with the σ 
1 receptor chaperone and as σ 1 agonists are currently developed as potent 
neuroprotectants in AD, we investigated the pharmacological action of 
Amylovis-201 on the σ 1 receptor. We report that Amylovis-201 is a potent σ 1 
agonist by several in silico, in vitro and in vivo assays and that its 
anti-amnesic and neuroprotective effects involve a pharmacological action at σ 1 
receptors. Furthermore, we show for the first time that classical σ 1 receptor 
agonist (PRE-084), and antagonist (NE-100) are able to interact and disaggregate 
Aβ 25-35 fibrils. Interestingly, Amylovis-201 was the only compound inhibiting 
Aβ 25-35 aggregates formation. Our results therefore highlight a dual action of 
Amylovis-201 as anti-aggregating agent and σ 1 receptor agonist that could be 
highly effective in long-term treatment against neurodegeneration in AD.

Drug repurposing, also known as drug repositioning, involves identifying new 
applications for drugs whose effects in a disease are already established. 
Doxycycline, a broad-spectrum antibiotic belonging to the tetracycline class, 
has demonstrated potential activity against neurodegenerative diseases like 
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. However, despite its promise, the repurposed use of 
doxycycline encounters challenges in reaching the brain in adequate 
concentrations to exert its effects. To address this issue, nanostructured 
systems offer an innovative approach that can enhance brain targeting and the 
desired therapeutic outcomes. This review discusses the advances in doxycycline 
repurposing for Alzheimer's disease, presenting physicochemical and biological 
aspects that permeate doxycycline's repositioning and its application in 
nano-based delivery systems.

Neurodegenerative diseases are central or peripheral nervous system disorders 
associated with progressive brain cell degeneration. Common neurodegenerative 
diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, 
and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis have been widely studied. However, current 
therapeutics only reduce the symptoms and do not ameliorate the pathogenesis of 
these diseases. Recent studies suggested the roles of neuroinflammation, 
apoptosis, and oxidative stress in neurodegenerative diseases. Mesenchymal stem 
cells (MSCs) exert anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidative effects. 
Therefore, investigating the effects of MSCs and their applications may lead to 
the discovery of more effective therapies for neurodegenerative diseases. In 
this study, we review different approaches used to identify therapies for 
neurodegenerative diseases using MSCs.

BACKGROUND: In the landscape of HIV treatment, combined antiretroviral therapy 
(cART) is a cornerstone in managing viral loads and boosting CD4+ T-cell counts. 
Nevertheless, disparities in treatment outcomes remain persistent, and a subset 
of children fail to achieve adequate immunologic reconstitution (IR). This study 
aims to investigate the demographic and clinical factors associated with 
inadequate IR in HIV-infected children in Eritrea.
METHODOLOGY: A retrospective observational study was conducted on 822 children 
followed at Orotta National Pediatric Referral Hospital between 2005 and 2020. 
Two distinct analyses were performed, with univariate and multivariate logistic 
regression models employed to investigate risk factors contributing to 
inadequate immunologic reconstitution (IR) at the study endpoints of 6- and 
12-months post-cART initiation.
RESULTS: From the initial cohort of 822 patients [53.4% were males, cohort 
median age at cART initiation was 78 (IQR: 48-101) months and median absolute 
CD4 count 270 (151-441) cells/µL]. Two separate analyses were conducted on two 
cohort subsets with complete data, including 456 children at the 6-month mark 
and 495 children at 12 months of follow-up. Following 6 months on cART, 
Immunologic reconstitution was achieved in 87.8% (95% CI: 84.3-91.2) and 
increased to 90.4% (95% CI: 87.3-93.5) after 12 months of treatment. Independent 
predictors of inadequate IR after 6 months of cART were higher baseline absolute 
CD4 counts (aOR = 1.003, (95% CI: 1.002-1.005); p-value <0.001) and NNRTI (EFV: 
aOR = 3.9, (95% CI: 1.3-11.9); p-value = 0.01). Meanwhile, gender (females: aOR 
= 0.3, (95% CI: 0.1-0.9, p-value = 0.03) and higher baseline absolute CD4 counts 
(aOR = 1.003, (95% CI: 1.002-1.005); p-value < 0.001) were independent risk 
factors of inadequate IR after 12 months of treatment.
CONCLUSION: The study underscores the interplay of baseline CD4 count, gender, 
and regimen choice in shaping the effectiveness of cART in children. Lower 
baseline absolute CD4 count was associated with IR after starting cART. Notably, 
children on EFV had a higher likelihood of inadequate IR after 6 months, and 
male children were more prone to insufficient IR at 12 months. Targeting these 
population-specific factors may be pivotal in advancing gender-responsive 
therapeutic strategies and improving health outcomes for HIV-infected children 
in sub-optimal clinical settings and resource-constrained environments.

Blood-based biomarkers continue to be explored for disease detection, monitoring 
of progression, and therapeutic outcomes as the diagnostic determination of 
Alzheimer's Disease in Down Syndrome (DS-AD) remains challenging in clinical 
settings. This perspective highlights the current status of this effort. 
Overall, amyloid (A), tau (T), and neurodegeneration (AT[N]) blood-based 
biomarkers have been shown to increase with disease pathology for individuals 
with DS. Phosphorylated tau biomarkers (p-tau217, p-tau181) have been 
consistently shown to track disease progression for DS-AD and are likely good 
candidates for use in clinical settings. Biomarkers of inflammation (glial 
fibrillary acidic protein) also show promise; however, additional work is 
needed. Findings from stability work of blood-based biomarkers conducted among 
non-DS also support the potential longitudinal utility of biomarkers such as 
neurofilament light chain and p-tau181 in DS. Gaps in our knowledge are 
highlighted, and a potential role for sex differences in biomarker outcomes is 
noted, along with recommendations for determining the appropriate context of use 
when translating biomarkers into clinical applications. HIGHLIGHTS: An overview 
of blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) was provided for 
consideration of their utility among individuals with Down syndrome when looking 
toward potential clinical applications. Longitudinal stability of many blood 
biomarkers and improvement in detection sensitivity make blood such as plasma a 
viable source for exploring AD pathology. Variability in reviewed findings 
regarding the application of blood biomarkers highlights the importance of 
understanding and defining the appropriate context of use, particularly when 
translating them into clinical practice.

INTRODUCTION: Pathological and neuroimaging alterations in the cerebellum of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients have been documented. However, the role of 
cerebellum-derived radiomic and structural connectome modeling in the prediction 
of AD progression remains unclear.
METHODS: Radiomic features were extracted from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset (n = 1319) and 
an in-house dataset (n = 308). Integrated machine learning models were developed 
to predict the conversion risk of normal cognition (NC) to mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) over a 6-year follow-up.
RESULTS: The cerebellar models outperformed hippocampal models in distinguishing 
MCI from NC and in predicting transitions from NC to MCI across both cohorts. 
Key predictors included textural features in the right III and left I and II 
lobules, and network properties in Vermis I and II, which were associated with 
cognitive decline in AD.
DISCUSSION: Cerebellum-derived radiomic-network modeling shows promise as a tool 
for early identification and prediction of disease progression during the 
preclinical stage of AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: Altered cerebellar radiomic features and topological networks were 
identified in the subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The cerebellar 
radiomic-network integrated models outperformed hippocampal models in 
distinguishing MCI from normal cognition. The cerebellar radiomic model 
effectively predicts MCI risk and can stratify individuals into distinct risk 
categories. Specific cerebellar radiomic features are associated with cognitive 
impairment across various stages of amyloid beta and tau pathology.

INTRODUCTION: We aimed to investigate which factors affect plasma biomarker 
levels via amyloid beta (Aβ)-independent or Aβ-dependent effects and improve the 
predictive performance of these biomarkers for Aβ positivity on positron 
emission tomography (PET).
METHODS: A total of 2935 participants underwent blood sampling for measurements 
of plasma Aβ42/40 ratio, phosphorylated tau 217 (p-tau217; ALZpath), glial 
fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels 
using single-molecule array and Aβ PET. Laboratory findings were collected using 
a routine blood test battery.
RESULTS: Aβ-independent factors included hemoglobin and estimated glomerular 
filtration rate (eGFR) for p-tau217 and hemoglobin, eGFR, and triiodothyronine 
(T3) for GFAP and NfL. Aβ-dependent factors included apolipoprotein E genotypes, 
body mass index status for Aβ42/40, p-tau217, GFAP, and NfL. However, these 
factors exhibited negligible or modest effects on Aβ positivity on PET.
DISCUSSION: Our findings highlight the importance of accurately interpreting 
plasma biomarkers for predicting Aβ uptake in real-world settings.
HIGHLIGHTS: We investigated factor-Alzheimer's disease plasma biomarker 
associations in a large Korean cohort. Hemoglobin and estimated glomerular 
filtration rate affect the biomarkers independently of brain amyloid beta (Aβ). 
Apolipoprotein E genotypes and body mass index status affect the biomarkers 
dependent on brain Aβ. Addition of Aβ-independent factors shows negligible 
effect in predicting Aβ positivity. Adjusting for Aβ-dependent factors shows 
a modest effect in predicting Aβ positivity.

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is one of the leading causes of young-onset 
dementia before age 65, typically manifesting as abnormal behavior (in 
behavioral variant FTD) or language impairment (in primary progressive aphasia). 
Although FTD affects all populations across the globe, knowledge regarding the 
pathophysiology and genetics derives primarily from studies conducted in North 
America and Western Europe. Globally, biomedical research for FTD is hindered by 
variable access to diagnosis, discussed in this group's earlier article, and by 
reduced access to expertise, funding, and infrastructure. This perspective paper 
was produced by two professional interest areas of the Alzheimer's Association 
International Society to Advance Alzheimer's Research and Treatment (ISTAART) 
and discusses the field's current status on the cross-cultural aspects of basic 
and translational research in FTD (including that focused on epidemiology, 
genetics, biomarkers, and treatment). It subsequently provides a summary of gaps 
and needs to address the disparities and advance global FTD biomedical research.

The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) Administrative Core 
oversees and coordinates all ADNI activities, to ensure the success and maximize 
the impact of ADNI in advancing Alzheimer's disease (AD) research and clinical 
trials. It manages finances and develops policies for data sharing, publications 
using ADNI data, and access to ADNI biospecimens. The Core develops and executes 
pilot projects to guide future ADNI activities and identifies key innovative 
methods for inclusion in ADNI. For ADNI4, the Administrative Core collaborates 
with the Engagement, Clinical, and Biomarker Cores to develop and evaluate 
novel, digital methods and infrastructure for participant recruitment, 
screening, and assessment of participants. The goal of these efforts is to 
enroll 500 participants, including > 50% from underrepresented populations, 40% 
with mild cognitive impairment, and 80% with elevated AD biomarkers. This new 
approach also provides a unique opportunity to validate novel methods. 
HIGHLIGHTS: The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
Administrative Core oversees and coordinates all ADNI activities. The overall 
goal is to ensure ADNI's success and help design future Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
clinical trials. A key innovation is data sharing without embargo to maximize 
scientific impact. For ADNI4, novel, digital methods for recruitment and 
assessment were developed. New methods are designed to improve the participation 
of underrepresented populations.

INTRODUCTION: The pathogenesis of two major pathogenic characters-amyloid beta 
(Aβ) accumulation and hyperphosphorylated tau protein-in the brains of patients 
with Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unclear.
METHODS: Western blot and immunofluorescence staining were performed to detect 
the proteins in the brains of Thorase conditional knockout/transgenic mice and 
their littermates. A co-immunoprecipitation assay was applied to examine the 
Thorase-interacting proteins.
RESULTS: Genetic deletion of Thorase resulted in tau hyperphosphorylation and 
promoted Aβ accumulation in the mouse brain. Conversely, Thorase overexpression 
alleviated the pathogenesis of AD. Thorase regulated the phosphorylation of tau 
by targeting specific kinases and theprotein phosphatase 2B (PP2B). Thorase 
deficiency also impaired microglial phagocytosis and induced neuroinflammation 
by the activation of the NOD-like receptor thermal protein domain associated 
protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasomes in microglia.
DISCUSSION: Thorase may be a potential druggable target for developing 
therapeutic approaches to treat AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.
HIGHLIGHTS: Thorase deletion leads to elevated amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition and 
hyperphosphorylated tau accumulation in the brain. Thorase regulates the 
phosphorylation of tau protein via PP2B. Thorase deficiency impairs microglial 
phagocytosis and promotesNLRP3-mediated neuroinflammation. Overexpression of 
Thorase alleviates Aβ deposition and tau phosphorylation in the AD mouse model.

INTRODUCTION: Interventions to treat speech-language difficulties in primary 
progressive aphasia (PPA) often use word accuracy as a highly comparable 
outcome. However, there are more constructs of importance to people with PPA 
that have received less attention.
METHODS: Following Core Outcome Set Standards for Development Recommendations 
(COSSTAD), this study comprised: Stage 1 - systematic review to identify 
measures; Stage 2 - consensus groups to identify important outcome constructs 
for people with PPA (n = 82) and care partners (n = 91); Stage 3 - e-Delphi 
consensus with 57 researchers.
RESULTS: The systematic review identified 84 Outcome Measurement Instruments. 
Core outcome constructs identified included: (1) Participate in conversations 
with family and friends, (2) get words out, (3) be more fluent, (4) convey a 
message by any means, and (5) understand what others are saying. Researchers 
were unable to reach a consensus on measurement instruments.
DISCUSSION: Further work is required to develop appropriate measurement 
instruments that address all core outcome constructs important to key 
stakeholders.
HIGHLIGHTS: We introduce new symptom-led perspectives on primary progressive 
aphasia (PPA). The focus is on non-fluent/agrammatic (nfvPPA) and semantic 
(svPPA) variants. Foregrounding of early and non-verbal features of PPA and 
clinical trajectories is featured. We introduce a symptom-led staging scheme for 
PPA. We propose a prototype for a functional impairment scale, the PPA 
Progression Planning Aid.

Decades of research have provided evidence that Alzheimer's disease (AD) is 
caused in part by cerebral accumulation of amyloid beta-protein (Aβ). In 2023, 
the US Food and Drug Administration gave full regulatory approval to a 
disease-modifying Aβ antibody for early AD. Secondary prevention trials with Aβ 
antibodies are underway. We summarize peer-reviewed evidence for targeting Aβ 
and argue that regulators should consider approving new agents working by 
similar mechanisms (Aβ antibodies and vaccines) based on robust amyloid lowering 
and reasonable safety. The urgent need to provide treatments to millions of 
mildly symptomatic patients suggests that AD should join other diseases for 
which standard approval is based on significant changes in mechanistically 
meaningful biomarkers coupled with safety. Robust amyloid lowering in secondary 
prevention trials of people who have amyloid plaques but are asymptomatic could 
also provide evidence of a change in the pathophysiological progression of AD as 
a basis for regulatory approval. HIGHLIGHTS: Thirteen key findings support 
amyloid beta as a cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Three immunotherapies lower 
amyloid and slow decline, allowing regulatory approval. New such agents could be 
considered for approval due to amyloid lowering and safety. Urgency suggests AD 
may join diseases with approval due to a key biomarker + safety.

Elucidating the molecular mechanism of noncompetitive inhibition of 
acetylcholinesterase by an antidiabetic drug chlorpropamide: identification of 
new allosteric sites.

Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) has emerged as an important drug target for the 
treatment of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Recent experimental studies indicate that certain antidiabetic drugs can be 
repurposed as potent AChE inhibitors. Enzymatic kinetic assays suggest that the 
antidiabetic drug chlorpropamide (CPM) acts as a noncompetitive inhibitor, but 
the mechanism of action and the binding site(s) of interaction with AChE are not 
known. In this work, we have carried out molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to 
discover a new allosteric site in addition to the known peripheral anionic site 
(PAS) as a potential binding site of this noncompetitive inhibitor. We show that 
the conformational ensemble of the catalytic triad, particularly the HIS447, 
undergoes a significant population shift on ligand binding that is responsible 
for deactivation of the enzyme. We also elucidate the pathway of the allosteric 
signaling in terms of locally correlated domains of the inter-residue 
interaction network. Thus, our work identifies a new allosteric site for AChE 
inhibition and eludiates the underlying mechanistic principles. These results 
would be useful for the rational design of new noncompetitive inhibitors for 
AChE.

BACKGROUND: A 12-week randomized controlled trial demonstrated that 
brexpiprazole is efficacious for treating agitation in patients with dementia 
due to Alzheimer's disease.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term safety and tolerability of brexpiprazole for 
the treatment of agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease.
METHODS: This 12-week, active-treatment (oral brexpiprazole 2 or 3 mg/day) 
extension trial ran from October 2018-September 2022 at 66 sites in Europe/US. 
Patients with agitation in dementia due to Alzheimer's disease in a care 
facility/community-based setting who completed the randomized trial were 
eligible (N = 259 enrolled/analyzed for safety; 88.4% completed). Stable 
Alzheimer's disease medications were permitted. The primary safety endpoint was 
the frequency and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Change 
in Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) total score was an exploratory 
efficacy endpoint.
RESULTS: Mean (SD) age was 74.3 (7.6) years, 145 patients (56.0%) were female, 
and 248 (95.8%) were White. TEAEs were reported by 67 patients (25.9%), most 
commonly headache (3.5%) and fall (2.3%). Most TEAEs were mild or moderate in 
severity; 5 patients (1.9%) reported a severe TEAE, including 3 severe falls 
attributed to tripping, misjudging sitting, or dehydration. Twelve patients 
(4.6%) discontinued due to TEAEs. No patients died. Mean CMAI total score 
improved by 9.1 points over 12 weeks.
CONCLUSIONS: Considering the randomized and extension trials together, 
brexpiprazole 2 or 3 mg was generally well tolerated for up to 24 weeks in 
elderly patients with agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's 
disease. Patients showed continued improvement in agitation.

In recent years, the diagnostic accuracy of Alzheimer's disease has been 
enhanced by the development of different types of biomarkers that indicate the 
presence of neuropathological processes. In addition to improving patient 
selection for clinical trials, biomarkers can assess the effects of new 
treatments on pathological processes. However, there is concern about the 
indiscriminate and poorly supported use of biomarkers, especially in 
asymptomatic individuals or those with subjective cognitive decline. 
Difficulties interpreting these tests, high costs, and unequal access make this 
scenario even more challenging in healthcare. This article presents the 
recommendations from the Scientific Department of Cognitive Neurology and Aging 
of the Brazilian Academy of Neurology (Departamento Científico de Neurologia 
Cognitiva e Envelhecimento da Academia Brasileira de Neurologia) regarding the 
rational use and interpretation of Alzheimer's disease biomarkers in clinical 
practice. The clinical diagnosis of cognitive-behavioral syndrome is recommended 
as the initial step to guide the request for biomarkers.

Publisher: Nos últimos anos, a precisão diagnóstica da doença de Alzheimer tem 
sido aprimorada pelo desenvolvimento de diferentes tipos de biomarcadores que 
indicam a presença dos processos neuropatológicos. Além de melhorar a seleção de 
pacientes para ensaios clínicos, os biomarcadores podem avaliar os efeitos de 
novos tratamentos nos processos patológicos. No entanto, há preocupação com o 
uso indiscriminado e mal fundamentado de biomarcadores, especialmente em 
indivíduos assintomáticos ou com declínio cognitivo subjetivo. As dificuldades 
na interpretação desses testes, os altos custos e o acesso desigual tornam esse 
cenário ainda mais desafiador no cuidado assistencial. Neste artigo, são 
apresentadas as recomendações do Departamento Científico de Neurologia Cognitiva 
e Envelhecimento da Academia Brasileira de Neurologia quanto ao uso racional e 
interpretação de biomarcadores da doença de Alzheimer na prática clínica. O 
diagnóstico clínico da síndrome cognitivo-comportamental é recomendado como o 
passo inicial para orientar a solicitação de biomarcadores.

Novel therapies for Alzheimer's disease, particularly anti-amyloid drugs like 
lecanemab and donanemab, have shown modest clinical benefits but also 
significant risks. The present paper highlights the challenges of access to 
diagnosis, cost-effectiveness, safety, and the need for more representation of 
diverse populations in clinical trials. Recommendations include careful patient 
selection, risk-benefit analysis, and the importance of proven amyloid pathology 
for treatment. Future work involves further research on anti-amyloid therapies 
in Brazil and the development of more effective treatments for Alzheimer's 
disease.

Ambroxol Improves Amyloidogenic, NF-κB, and Nrf2 Pathways in a 
Scopolamine-Induced Cognitive Impairment Rat Model of Alzheimer's Disease.

Ambroxol (ABX) is used to manage excessive production of mucus in the 
respiratory system. The present study sought to assess the neuroprotective 
potential of ambroxol by influencing the amyloidogenic, nuclear factor 
kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), and nuclear factor 
erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathways in a rat model of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) induced by scopolamine. The AD pathology was induced by chronic 
administration of scopolamine. The rats were given scopolamine at a dose of 
2 mg/kg via intraperitoneal injection daily for 14 days, followed by treatment 
(ABX 121.5, 135, and 180 mg/kg orally and 5 mg/kg orally of donepezil) for the 
next 28 days while continuing to receive daily scopolamine injection. The 
behavior of the rats was evaluated using Modified Y-Maze and Novel object 
recognition tasks. Analyses were carried out on AD pathological markers [Amyloid 
beta peptide 1-40, Amyloid beta peptide 1-42, acetylcholinesterase, 
beta-secretase 1 (BACE1), total tau, and p-tau], inflammatory markers [NF-κB, 
tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and interferon γ], 
antioxidant markers (Nrf2 and heme Oxygenase 1 (HO-1)], along with synaptophysin 
and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunohistochemistry and 
histopathological assessment of the hippocampus. Our findings indicated that ABX 
reduced impairment in behavior. Levels of Acetylcholinesterase, BACE1, amyloid 
beta 1-40, amyloid beta 1-42, total tau, p-tau, NF-κB, IFN-γ, IL-6, and TNF-α 
decreased significantly. There was a significant increase in the levels of HO-1 
and Nrf2. It stopped the neuronal degeneration, raised synaptophysin 
immunoreactivity, and lowered GFAP immunoreactivity. The current research 
indicates that ambroxol may possess senomorphic properties by impacting the 
transcription factors NF-κB and senescence-associated secretory phenotype 
(SASP). Consequently, it could provide neuroprotection through alterations in 
the Nrf2 and NF-κB signaling pathways in AD.

The phospho-tau cascade, basal forebrain neurodegeneration, and dementia in 
Alzheimer's disease: Anti-neurodegenerative benefits of acetylcholinesterase 
inhibitors.

A conundrum in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is why the long-term use of 
acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors, intended for treatment of dementia, 
results in slowing neurodegeneration in the cholinergic basal forebrain, 
hippocampus, and cortex. The phospho-tau cascade hypothesis presented here 
attempts to answer that question by unifying three hallmark features of AD into 
a specific sequence of events. It is proposed that the hyperphosphorylation of 
tau protein leads to the AD-associated deficit of nerve growth factor (NGF), 
then to atrophy of the cholinergic basal forebrain and dementia. Because the 
release of pro-nerve growth factor (pro-NGF) is activity-dependent and is 
controlled by basal forebrain projections to the hippocampus and cortex, our 
hypothesis is that AChE inhibitors act by increasing acetylcholine-dependent 
pro-NGF release and, thus, augmenting the availability of mature NGF and 
improving basal forebrain survival. If correct, improved central nervous 
system-selective AChE inhibitor therapy started prophylactically, before 
AD-associated basal forebrain atrophy and cognitive impairment onset, has the 
potential to delay not only the onset of dementia but also its rate of 
advancement. The phospho-tau hypothesis thus suggests that preventing 
hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, early should be a high priority as a 
strategy to help reduce dementia and its associated widespread social and 
economic suffering.

Recently approved anti-amyloid immunotherapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
require evidence of amyloid-β pathology from positron emission tomography (PET) 
or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) before initiating treatment. Blood-based biomarkers 
promise to reduce the need for PET or CSF testing; however, their interpretation 
at the individual level and the circumstances requiring confirmatory testing are 
poorly understood. Individual-level interpretation of diagnostic test results 
requires knowledge of disease prevalence in relation to clinical presentation 
(clinical pretest probability). Here, in a study of 6,896 individuals evaluated 
from 11 cohort studies from six countries, we determined the positive and 
negative predictive value of five plasma biomarkers for amyloid-β pathology in 
cognitively impaired individuals in relation to clinical pretest probability. We 
observed that p-tau217 could rule in amyloid-β pathology in individuals with 
probable AD dementia (positive predictive value above 95%). In mild cognitive 
impairment, p-tau217 interpretation depended on patient age. Negative p-tau217 
results could rule out amyloid-β pathology in individuals with non-AD dementia 
syndromes (negative predictive value between 90% and 99%). Our findings provide 
a framework for the individual-level interpretation of plasma biomarkers, 
suggesting that p-tau217 combined with clinical phenotyping can identify 
patients where amyloid-β pathology can be ruled in or out without the need for 
PET or CSF confirmatory testing.

Early detection and accurate diagnosis of brain morphological abnormalities are 
essential for the effective management and treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
is a powerful support tool to aid in disease diagnosis and prediction. In this 
research study, we present an innovative approach to predict Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using MRI data, which integrates 
regional interest (ROI)-based methodology and deep learning within a 
comprehensible framework. The proposed method involves dividing the brain into 
138 predetermined sections based on anatomical information. Next, we apply 
three-dimensional vision transformers (3D-ViTs) to each ROI individually, 
harnessing the power of deep learning. To improve prediction accuracy, we employ 
a deep belief network (DBN) as an ensemble learning model. Evaluating our 
approach on the baseline structural MRI dataset obtained from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort, and comparing it against five 
other competing models, we demonstrate its performance across four binary 
classification tasks and a three-class classification test (AD vs MCI vs CN 
(Cognitively Normal)). The proposed system outperforms existing models and 
provides interpretable insights into the brain regions that significantly 
contribute to solving each classification problem. Our findings align with the 
existing body of literature and hold promise for guiding future research 
directions in this domain.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), the leading cause of dementia, affects over 55 million 
people worldwide and is often accompanied by depression and anxiety. Both 
significantly impact patients' quality of life and impose substantial societal 
and economic burdens on healthcare systems. Identifying the complex regulatory 
mechanisms that contribute to the psychological and emotional deficits in AD 
will provide promising therapeutic targets. Biosynthesis of omega-3 (ω3) and 
omega-6 fatty acids (ω6-FA) through long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases (ACSL) is 
crucial for cell function and survival. This is due to ω3/6-FA's imperative role 
in modulating the plasma membrane, energy production, and inflammation. While 
ACSL dysfunction is known to cause heart, liver, and kidney diseases, the role 
of ACSL in pathological conditions in the central nervous system (e.g., 
depression and anxiety) remains largely unexplored. The impact of ACSLs on 
AD-related depression and anxiety was investigated in a mouse model of 
Alzheimer's disease (3xTg-AD). ACSL3 levels were significantly reduced in the 
hippocampus of aged 3xTg-AD mice (via capillary-based immunoassay). This 
reduction in ACAL3 was closely associated with increased depression and 
anxiety-like behavior (via forced swim, tail suspension, elevated plus maze, and 
sucrose preference test). Upregulation of ACSL3 via adenovirus in aged 3xTg-AD 
mice led to increased protein levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) 
and vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C) (via brain histology, 
capillary-based immunoassay), resulting in alleviation of depression and anxiety 
symptoms. The present study highlights a novel neuroprotective role of ACSL3 in 
the brain. Targeting ACSL3 will offer an innovative approach for treating 
AD-related depression and anxiety.

It has been some time since the Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Technology has 
published an article on best practices in amyloid imaging. In light of the 
recent Food and Drug Administration approval of new antiamyloid therapies (AATs) 
to decrease amyloid plaques in the brain and slow progression of mild cognitive 
impairment, and the potential increase in the number of amyloid PET scans being 
acquired to document amyloid plaques, the Journal of Nuclear Medicine and 
Technology felt it was a perfect time to publish a refresher on best practices. 
AATs are administered to help slow progression of mild cognitive impairment, 
allowing patients to live independently a little longer before having to give up 
their independence and move in with family or into an assisted living facility. 
Neurologists prescribing AATs must first document that the patient has amyloid 
plaques. To do this, amyloid PET can be performed, or a lumbar puncture can be 
used to look for amyloid plaques in the cerebrospinal fluid. Although the latter 
is more cost-effective and has no associated radiation exposure, it is highly 
invasive compared with amyloid PET. High-quality amyloid PET scans interpretated 
by a trained nuclear medicine physician are the first step and key to providing 
the dementia expert and patient with accurate information on amyloid status, 
allowing for the best decisions on patient management.

Alzheimer disease (AD) is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States 
and is projected to affect over 13 million people by the year 2060. Although 
there is currently no cure for AD, disease-modifying treatments that target 
amyloid plaques have recently been approved for use. The advent of PET tracers 
that can reliably detect the presence of cortical amyloid plaques and tau 
pathologies has allowed researchers and clinicians to identify individuals who 
have pathologic markers of AD before the onset of cognitive decline. Although 
these tracers have been widely used in research settings for some time, they are 
now on the verge of being used to aid clinicians in the differential diagnosis 
of AD. As the use of these tracers increases, technologists will need to be 
educated on the best practices and potential problems they may encounter in 
their clinical populations. This article will review the available tracers for 
amyloid and tau PET scans and educate technologists about the most important 
practices and procedures that can be implemented to ensure patient safety and 
the capture of high-quality scans.

Elevated levels of butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) have the potential to be 
predictive in the timely detection and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). By 
inhibiting of BuChE activity can raise acetylcholine levels and intervene AD 
processes. Therefore, BuChE as an important factor in treatment AD has been 
given more and more attention in clinical studies. Given the facts above, in 
this study, for precise monitoring of BuChE level changes and screening for 
possible butyrylcholinesterase inhibitor (BuChEI) for AD diagnosis and therapy, 
a near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence probe (NFP-BuChE) was created. The probe 
exhibits excellent sensitivity and selectivity for BuChE. NFP-BuChE has been 
successfully applied to the detection of endogenous BuChE levels in live cells, 
and we successfully constructed a screening system for BuChEI on cells and a 
novel natural efficient BuChEI (matrine) was discovered and identified, which 
significantly reduced BuChE activity and thus alleviated AD symptoms. Most 
importantly, for the first time, we measured the changes of BuChE levels in 
zebrafish (0-4 days) after fertilization, various organs of zebrafish, and AD 
zebrafish modeled by different concentrations of AlCl3 by NFP-BuChE, and at the 
same time, we also validated the inhibitory effect of matrine on BuChE by 
NFP-BuChE in zebrafish. In addition, NFP-BuChE has also been successfully used 
to measure the changes of BuChE levels in the brains of AD mice. These findings 
imply that NFP-BuChE is a potentially useful molecular tool for screening 
possible natural BuChEI quickly and for monitoring changes in BuChE activity, 
and it is expected that more value will be explored in mice. In addition, 
matrine and its derivatives are promising options for future Alzheimer's disease 
treatments.

Excitatory neurotransmitter-induced neuronal ferroptosis has been implicated in 
multiple neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's 
disease. Although there are several reports pertaining to the pharmacological 
activities of biochanin A, the effects of this isoflavone on 
excitotoxicity-triggered neuronal ferroptosis remain unclear. In this study, we 
demonstrate that biochanin A inhibits ferroptosis of mouse hippocampal neurons 
induced by glutamate or the glutamate analog, kainic acid. Biochanin A 
significantly inhibited accumulation of intracellular iron and lipid 
peroxidation in glutamate- or kainic acid-treated mouse hippocampal neurons. 
Furthermore, biochanin A regulated the level of glutathione peroxidase 4, a 
master regulator of ferroptosis, by modulating its autophagy-dependent 
degradation. We observed that biochanin A reduced the glutamate-induced 
accumulation of intracellular iron by regulating expression of iron 
metabolism-related proteins including ferroportin-1, divalent metal transferase 
1, and transferrin receptor 1. Taken together, these results indicate that 
biochanin A effectively inhibits hippocampal neuronal death triggered by 
glutamate or kainic acid. Our study is the first to report that biochanin A has 
therapeutic potential for the treatment of diseases associated with hippocampal 
neuronal death, particularly ferroptosis induced by excitatory neurotransmitter.

Recent advances in the development of 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 
inhibitors.

The family of 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (17β-HSDs) occupies a prominent 
place due to its number of isoforms, which carry out a bidirectional 
transformation (reduction of a steroid carbonyl to alcohol and oxidation of a 
steroid alcohol to ketone) depending on the nature of the cofactor present. 
Involved in the activation or inactivation of key estrogens and androgens, 
17β-HSDs are therefore therapeutic targets whose selective inhibition would make 
it possible to be considered for the treatment of several diseases, such as 
breast cancer, prostate cancer, endometriosis, Alzheimer's disease and 
osteoporosis. This review article is a continuation of those having reported the 
great diversity of inhibitors developed over the last years but focusses on 
inhibitors recently developed. Work to obtain more effective inhibitors that 
target the first known isoforms (types 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7) has continued, among 
others, but new inhibitors that target the isoforms more recently reported in 
the literature (types 10, 12, 13 and 14) are now being reported. Dual inhibitors 
of two enzymes (17β-HSD1 and steroid sulfatase) were also reported. These 
inhibitors were grouped according to the 17β-HSD type inhibited and their 
backbone (steroidal or non-steroidal) when necessary. They were also reported in 
chronological order and according to the research group.

While apolipoprotein E (APOE) is the strongest genetic modifier for late-onset 
Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), the molecular mechanisms underlying 
isoform-dependent risk and the relevance of ApoE-associated lipids remain 
elusive. Here, we report that impaired low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor 
(LDLR) binding of lipidated ApoE2 (lipApoE2) avoids LDLR recycling defects 
observed with lipApoE3/E4 and decreases the uptake of cholesteryl esters (CEs), 
which are lipids linked to neurodegeneration. In human neurons, the addition of 
ApoE carrying polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)-CE revealed an allelic series 
(ApoE4 > ApoE3 > ApoE2) associated with lipofuscinosis, an age-related lysosomal 
pathology resulting from lipid peroxidation. Lipofuscin increased lysosomal 
accumulation of tau fibrils and was elevated in the APOE4 mouse brain with 
exacerbation by tau pathology. Intrahippocampal injection of PUFA-CE-lipApoE4 
was sufficient to induce lipofuscinosis in wild-type mice. Finally, the 
protective Christchurch mutation also reduced LDLR binding and phenocopied 
ApoE2. Collectively, our data strongly suggest decreased lipApoE-LDLR 
interactions minimize LOAD risk by reducing the deleterious effects of 
endolysosomal targeting of ApoE and associated pathogenic lipids.

Elaeagnus glabra f. oxyphylla (EGFO), a member of the Elaeagnaceae family, is an 
evergreen plant distinct from other species in its genus. We previously reported 
that ethanol extract from EGFO has memory improvement effects in a short-term 
memory deficit mouse model and anti-inflammatory effects in a microglial cell 
line. However, little is known about the pharmacological effects of EGFO. In the 
present study, we further explored the effect of EGFO on cognitive impairment 
using amyloid-beta-induced Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like mice. EGFO extract 
significantly enhanced cognitive functions in the passive avoidance task and 
Morris water maze test. EGFO treatment led to a significant increase in neuronal 
nuclei expression in mouse hippocampal tissues and inhibited hydrogen 
peroxide-induced cell death in HT22 hippocampal cells, indicating the 
neuroprotective effects of EGFO. Antibody microarray analysis was performed to 
determine the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of EGFO on cognitive 
improvement and neuroprotection. The data revealed that EGFO decreased the 
phosphorylation of protein kinase C delta and increased the phosphorylation of 
myosin regulatory light chain 2 and tyrosine kinase Fer. These findings were 
validated using immunoblotting both in in vitro and in vivo AD models. Overall, 
our findings suggest that EGFO could be a candidate therapeutic agent for AD or 
AD-like diseases due to its potential for cognitive improvement and 
neuroprotection.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate neuroinflammation in Parkinson's disease (PD) with 
[11C]PBR28 positron emission tomography (PET) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
biomarkers, and the relationship to dopaminergic functioning measured with 
6-[18F]-fluoro-L-dopa ([18F]FDOPA) PET.
METHODS: The clinical cohort consisted of 20 subjects with PD and 51 healthy 
controls (HC). All HC and 15 PD participants underwent [11C]PBR28 High 
Resolution Research Tomograph (HRRT) PET for the quantitative assessment of 
cerebral binding to the translocator protein (TSPO), a neuroinflammation marker. 
CSF samples were available from 17 subjects with PD and 21 HC and were examined 
for soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2), chitinase 
3-like 1 protein (YKL-40), neurogranin (NG), alpha-synuclein (aSyn) and 
oligo-alpha-synuclein. All subjects with PD underwent [18F]FDOPA HRRT PET.
RESULTS: While the subjects with PD and HC did not differ in the total volume of 
distribution (VT) of [11C]PBR28 in any studied brain regions, higher levels of 
neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration CSF biomarkers sTREM2 and NG, 
respectively were associated with more severe motor symptoms evaluated by The 
Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor part (UPDRS-III) (r = 0.52, 
p = 0.041 and r = 0.59, p = 0.016 respectively). Additionally, in the PD group 
increased [11C]PBR28 VT in the basal ganglia and substantia nigra (SN) was 
related to higher levels of neuroinflammation biomarker YKL-40 (p < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Associations between CSF biomarkers, motor disability and [11C]PBR28 
VT in the striatum and SN may support a role for neuroinflammation in PD.

BACKGROUND: Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are a diverse group of 
neurological disorders with progressive neuronal loss at specific brain regions, 
leading to impaired cognitive functioning, loss of neuroplasticity, severe 
neurological impairment, and dementia. The incidence of neurodegenerative 
diseases is increasing at an alarming rate with current treatments struggling to 
barely prolong the inevitable. The desperation to discover a therapeutic agent 
to treat neurodegenerative diseases and to aid in the process of healthy 
recovery has opened a gateway into natural pigments.
HYPOTHESIS: The xanthophyll pigment lutein may bear the potential as a 
therapeutic agent against NDDs.
RESULTS: Lutein plays an important role in brain development, cognitive 
functioning, and improving neuroplasticity. In vitro and in vivo studies 
revealed the neuroprotective properties of lutein against NDDs such as 
Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and cerebral 
ischemia. The neuroprotective effect of lutein is evidenced by the reduction of 
free radicals and the simultaneous strengthening of the endogenous antioxidant 
systems by activating the NRF-2/ERK/AKT pathway. Further, it effectively 
suppressed mitochondrial aberrations, excitotoxicity, overaccumulation of 
metals, and its resultant complications. The immunomodulatory activity of lutein 
prevents neuroinflammation by hindering NF-κB nuclear translocation, regulation 
of NIK/IKK, PI3K/AKT, MAPK/ERK, JNK pathways, and ICAM-1 downregulation. Lutein 
also rescued the dysregulated cholinergic system and resolved memory defects. 
Along with its neuroprotective properties, lutein also improved neuroplasticity 
by enabling neurogenesis through increased GAP-43, NCAM, and BDNF levels.
CONCLUSION: Lutein exhibits strong neuroprotective activities against various 
NDDs. Though the investigations are in the exploratory phase, this review 
presents the consolidation of scattered evidence of the neuroprotective 
properties of lutein and urges its further exploration in clinical studies.

Inhibition of cholinesterases, combined with antioxidant activity, 
metal-chelating capacity, and neuroprotection, is recognized as an effective 
multitarget therapy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Based on our 
in-house thiosemicarbazone-acridine compounds, this study recognized these 
derivatives as possible multi-target-directed ligand (MTDL). Initial screening 
against cholinesterases identified CL-01, which exhibited a promising IC50 value 
of 0.71 μM against butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). Twelve new derivatives were 
designed based on CL-01 aiming to retain the BChE inhibitory activity while 
incorporating a MTDL profile, including antioxidant properties and 
metal-complexing abilities. Among the new derivatives, CL-13 maintained a good 
BChE inhibition (IC50 = 1.15 μM) with improved selective index against 
acetylcholinesterase (SI = 9.2). The acridine nucleus was important for the 
activity, as its saturated tetrahydroacridine analogue (TA-01) showed a decrease 
in cholinesterases inhibition potencies and altered the mode of inhibition, 
revealing for the first time distinct functional roles for the two nuclei. 
Moreover, CL-13 emerged as a promising lead compound, demonstrating interesting 
antioxidant activity (DPPH EC50 = 47.01 μM), chelating capacity of biometals 
involved in Aβ aggregation and/or oxidative stress, and a lack of neurotoxicity 
at 50 μM in SH-SY5Y cells. It also exhibited neuroprotective effects in an in 
vitro oxidative stress model induced by H2O2. Finally, in vivo experiments 
confirmed that CL-13 effectively reversed scopolamine-induced cognitive 
impairment, without affecting locomotor activity in the mice.

Neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) are age-related and 
are fatal in advanced cases. There is a limited efficacy of drugs used for the 
management of these diseases. Herein, the neurotherapeutic efficacy of a 
benzofuran-derivative-7 (BF-7) was investigated. Aluminum chloride (AlCl3) was 
employed to induce AD-like brain toxicity in rats. The rats were divided into 
four groups: Negative control, AlCl3-induced AD rats (100 mg/kg body weight, 
orally), AlCl3-AD induced rats treated with BF-7 (10 mg/kg body weight, orally), 
AlCl3-AD-induced rats treated with the standard drug "Donepezil" (10 mg/kg body 
weight, orally). The behavioral performance was tested using a beam-balance 
test. Brain and serum acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities and the brain 
levels of norepinephrine, dopamine (DA), and serotonin (5-HT) were measured. The 
genetic expression of Bcl-2, Bax, caspase-3, and insulin 1 were assayed. The 
histopathological imaging and the immunohistochemical evaluation of Glial 
Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) were investigated in the cerebral cortex. 
Treatment of AD-rats with BF-7 mitigated AlCl3-induced neurotoxicity by 
improving motor functions, counteracting apoptosis, and exerting cholinergic 
functions. In addition, the genetic expression of Insulin 1 was upregulated 
significantly in AD-induced rats treated with BF-7. This compound could be used 
as a promising candidate for neurotherapeutic drug discovery against AD or any 
other toxic brain disorders.

BACKGROUND: The incidence and clinical relevance of asymptomatic cerebrospinal 
fluid escape (CSFE) during antiretroviral therapy (ART) is uncertain. We 
examined the impact and incidence of asymptomatic CSFE in a Swedish HIV cohort.
METHODS: Neuroasymptomatic people with HIV (PWH) who have been on ART for at 
least 6 months with suppressed plasma viral load were followed longitudinally. 
CSFE was defined as either increased CSF HIV-1 RNA with concurrent plasma 
suppression or CSF HIV-1 RNA exceeding that in plasma when both were 
quantifiable. Paired CSF and plasma were analyzed for HIV-1 RNA, neopterin, 
neurofilament light protein (NfL), white blood cell (WBC) count, and albumin 
ratio.
RESULTS: Asymptomatic CSFE (cutoff 50 copies/mL) was found in 4 of 173 PWH (2%) 
and 5 of 449 samples (1%). The corresponding proportions were 8% of PWH and 4% 
for samples using a 20 copies/mL cutoff for CSF HIV-1 RNA. CSFE samples (cutoff 
20 copies/mL) had a 25% higher geometric mean of CSF neopterin (P = .01) and 8% 
higher albumin ratio (P = .04) compared to samples without CSFE. No differences 
were observed in CSF NfL levels (P = .8). The odds ratio for increased CSF WBC 
(≥ 3 cells/μL) in samples with CSFE was 3.9 (P = .004), compared to samples 
without elevated CSF viral load.
CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic CSFE was identified in only 4 (2%) PWH, with no cases 
of continuous CSFE observed. Increased CSF HIV-1 RNA was associated with 
biomarkers of CNS immune activation and blood-brain barrier impairment, but not 
with biomarkers of neuronal injury.

Progress in understanding the causes of physiological and behavioral changes in 
post-menopausal women is hampered by the paucity of animal models that 
accurately recapitulate these age-associated changes. Here we evaluate the 
translational potential of female rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). Like women, 
these long-lived diurnal primates show marked neuroendocrine changes during 
aging, as well as perturbed sleep-wake cycles and cognitive decline. 
Furthermore, the brains of old rhesus macaques show some of the same 
pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease as do humans, including 
amyloidosis and tauopathology. Importantly, unlike humans, rhesus macaques can 
be maintained under tightly controlled environmental conditions, such as 
photoperiod, temperature and diet, and tissues can be collected with zero 
postmortem interval; this makes them especially suitable for studies aimed at 
elucidating underlying molecular mechanisms. Recent findings from female 
macaques are helping to elucidate how sex-steroids influence gene expression 
within the brain and contribute to the maintenance of cognitive function and 
amelioration of age-associated pathologies. Taken together, these findings 
emphasize the translational value of female rhesus macaques as a model for 
elucidating causal mechanisms that underlie normative and pathological changes 
in post-menopausal women. They also provide a pragmatic platform upon which to 
develop safe and effective therapies.

OBJECTIVE: The primary cause of memory loss is Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent 
studies have shown that natural compounds like apple cider vinegar (ACV) have 
anti-Alzheimer's capabilities. Essential components of ACV, such as gallic acid 
and chlorogenic acid, may be in charge of the drug's pharmacological effects.
METHODS: Using molecular docking and dynamics (MD), the current work looks at 
the aspect of ACV that protects against AD. To study the conformational 
relationships and interaction mechanisms between two biological molecules (such 
as interactions between proteins and drugs or between proteins), MD simulation 
is frequently used. MD can help understand molecular structural differences 
between proteins and small compounds. We used acetylcholinesterase (AChE, PDB 
ID: 1UT6) to MD chlorogenic and gallic acids, as well as the currently 
prescribed medication rivastigmine (Standard medication). Furthermore, we 
determine the binding affinity, which may be responsible for AChE inhibition. MD 
simulations were performed on docked complexes of chlorogenic acid, gallic acid, 
and rivastigmine with receptor 1UT6 for a 300 ns trajectory to ensure the 
stability of docked ligand-protein complexes.
RESULTS: The results showed that chlorogenic acid has the highest binding 
affinity and stability for AChE inhibition. In the docking and dynamics 
analysis, both techniques have predicted chlorogenic acid to be a potential 
constituent of ACV which shows a similar activity when compared to rivastigmine 
by virtue of binding affinity.
CONCLUSION: These findings identify chlorogenic acid as the key component of ACV 
that protects against AD-related cognitive and behavioral impairments. This 
finding will be critical in the development of ACV-based drugs for Alzheimer's 
disease treatment.

OBJECTIVES: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of morbidity and 
mortality among the elderly. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) 
applies low-intensity currents to the brain, resulting in short-term 
neurocognitive effects and long-term neuroplasticity enhancement. Limited 
research reported on the impact of tDCS on cognitive functions in dementia due 
to AD. This study aims to compare changes in verbal fluency and working memory 
following a single tDCS application to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex 
(DLPFC) in AD patients.
METHODS: Patients with mild dementia due to AD underwent cognitive assessment 
using the Standardized Mini-Mental Test, Clock Drawing Test, Rey Auditory Verbal 
Learning Test, Functional Activities Questionnaire, Informant Questionnaire on 
Cognitive Decline in the Elderly, and Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale. A 
single-session tDCS was administered by applying anodal tDCS to the left DLPFC 
for a duration of 30 minutes. Verbal fluency and working memory were evaluated 
before and after tDCS using the WAIS-R Digit Span Test forward and backward 
subscales, Trail Making Test (TMT) A and B, and Verbal Fluency Test.
RESULTS: Regarding cognitive test scores before and after tDCS application, 
there were statistically significant reductions in the durations of TMT-A and 
TMT-B. However, there were no significant differences observed for TMT B-A, VFT, 
DST-forward, and DST-backward performances.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that a single anodal tDCS targeting the left 
DLPFC enhances attention and processing speed in AD patients but has no effect 
on working memory or verbal fluency.

Alzheimer's disease causes gradual, persistent deterioration of cognitive 
function in the elderly, causing social and economic damage to society. Over the 
past decades, mankind has made significant progress in the study of Alzheimer's 
disease, but there are no methods to fully control the disease. The lack of 
effectiveness of existing treatment methods emphasizes the need to search for 
new approaches. The present review is devoted to the study of the latest data 
regarding the role of microbiota in the mechanisms of formation and progression 
of Alzheimer's disease, possible therapeutic ways to influence the processes of 
neurodegeneration through microbiota and taking into account identified 
relationships. The article considers the axis «gut microbiota-brain» as a link 
in the pathogenesis of neuroinflammation. New data on the influence of gut 
microbiota on neurodegenerative processes through metabolic, nervous, and immune 
mechanisms is analyzed. New data reveals correlations between microbiota 
specifics and the origin and/or progression of Alzheimer's disease, expanding 
the understanding of disease pathogenesis. The role of the oral microbiota in 
neurodegeneration processes is mentioned, emphasizing the diverse mechanisms of 
this disease. Available therapies for Alzheimer's disease are discussed, 
including probiotics and prebiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation, and 
dietary correction.

B cell-directed CAR T cell therapy has fundamentally changed the treatment of 
haematological malignancies, and its scope of application is rapidly expanding 
to include other diseases such as solid tumours or autoimmune disorders. 
Therapy-refractoriness remains an important challenge in various inflammatory 
and non-inflammatory disorders of the CNS. The reasons for therapy failure are 
diverse and include the limited access current therapies have to the CNS, as 
well as enormous inter- and intra-individual disease heterogeneity. The 
tissue-penetrating properties of CAR T cells make them a promising option for 
overcoming this problem and tackling pathologies directly within the CNS. First 
application of B cell-directed CAR T cells in neuromyelitis optica spectrum 
disorder and multiple sclerosis patients has recently revealed promising 
outcomes, expanding the potential of CAR T cell therapy to encompass CNS 
diseases. Additionally, the optimization of CAR T cells for the therapy of 
gliomas is a growing field. As a further prospect, preclinical data reveal the 
potential benefits of CAR T cell therapy in the treatment of primary 
neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Considering the 
biotechnological optimizations in the field of T cell engineering, such as 
extension to target different antigens or variation of the modified T cell 
subtype, new and promising fields of CAR T cell application are rapidly opening 
up. These innovations offer the potential to address the complex 
pathophysiological properties of CNS diseases. To use CAR T cell therapy 
optimally to treat CNS diseases in the future while minimizing therapy risks, 
further mechanistic research and prospective controlled trials are needed to 
assess seriously the disease and patient-specific risk-benefit ratio.

BACKGROUND: Chronic inflammation is a key factor in type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(T2DM) development. The cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP) reduces 
inflammation by activating α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α7nAChRs) on 
macrophages, suppressing proinflammatory cytokines. Acetylcholinesterase 
inhibitors (AChEis), primarily used for Alzheimer's disease (AD), may exert 
anti-inflammatory effects through the CAP. One AChEi, galantamine, also directly 
agonizes α7nAChRs, potentially enhancing its anti-inflammatory properties.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the association between AChEi use, 
particularly galantamine, and T2DM risk in AD patients.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of Veterans Health Administration 
(VA) data, examining early- and late-onset AD patients receiving galantamine or 
other AD medications. Propensity score matching was used to balance groups and 
minimize confounding. Cox proportional hazard models assessed T2DM risk for 
galantamine, other AChEis and memantine.
RESULTS: A total of 40 065 AD patients were included in the study. Among 
early-onset AD patients, galantamine use significantly reduced T2DM risk (hazard 
ratio [HR] = 0.80, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.66-0.98). Memantine also 
showed a protective effect (HR = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.69-1) in this group. Neither 
galantamine nor memantine influenced T2DM risk in late-onset AD. Other AD 
medications showed no association with T2DM risk.
CONCLUSION: Galantamine use was associated with a lower risk of T2DM in 
early-onset AD patients, potentially due to enhanced anti-inflammatory effects 
through both AChE inhibition and direct α7nAChR agonism. Memantine also 
demonstrated a protective effect. These findings suggest potential new 
applications for existing AD medications in T2DM prevention, particularly in 
early-onset AD patients. Further research, including randomized controlled 
trials with diverse populations, is needed to confirm these results and the 
underlying mechanisms.

BACKGROUND: Klotho, encoded by the KLOTHO gene, is an anti-aging and 
neuroprotective protein. KLOTHO KL-VS heterozygosity (KL-VSHET) is hypothesized 
to be protective against the accumulation of Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
neuropathological hallmarks (amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau).
OBJECTIVE: We examine whether being positive for Aβ (A+) or tau (T+), or A/T 
joint status [positive for Aβ (A + T-), tau (A-T+), both (A + T+) or neither 
(A-T-)] vary by KL-VS and whether serum klotho protein levels vary based on A+, 
T+, or A/T status in a cohort enriched for AD risk.
METHODS: The sample consisted of 704 cognitively unimpaired, late middle-aged, 
and older adults; MeanAge(SD) = 64.9(8.3). Serum klotho was available for a 
sub-sample of 396 participants; MeanAge(SD) = 66.8(7.4). Covariate-adjusted 
logistic regression examined whether A + or T+, and multinomial regression 
examined whether A/T status, vary by KL-VS genotype. Covariate-adjusted linear 
regression examined whether serum klotho levels differ based on A+, T+, or A/T 
status.
RESULTS: A+ prevalence was lower in KL-VSHET (p = 0.05), with no differences in 
T + prevalence (p = 0.52). KL-VSHET also had marginally lower odds of being 
A + T- (p = 0.07). Serum klotho levels did not differ based on A+, T+, or A/T 
status (all ps ≥ 0.40).
CONCLUSIONS: KL-VSHET is associated with lower odds of being positive for Aβ, 
regardless of whether one is also positive for tau. Conversely, the likelihood 
of being tau positive did not differ based on KL-VS genotype. Our findings add 
to the growing KLOTHO literature and suggests the need for further research 
focused on understanding the mechanisms underlying KL-VS-related putative 
resilience to AD.

Alzheimer's disease: part 2 - the present.

Based on my work as a clinical neurologist with more than 50 years of experience 
in caring for patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), I focus, in this review 
article, on the disease's two fundamental aspects for the doctor: diagnosis and 
treatment. The 1984 diagnostic criteria had been stable for more than a quarter 
of a century when it was replaced in 2011. Since then, there have been many 
discoveries, especially of biomarkers that have a heavy impact on the diagnosis 
of AD. Recently, AD biomarkers have become available in plasma, which certainly 
will cause a major change in the diagnosis of biological AD, a term that still 
needs care and information to society before being used in clinical practice. 
Three monoclonal antibodies against β-amyloid peptide have also been recently 
approved, and two of these have shown a small but statistically significant 
effect on clinical outcome. These monoclonal antibodies have had a greater 
effect on the reduction of amyloid plaques in the brain assessed by positron 
emission tomography (PET), and on the concentration of biomarkers in the 
cerebrospinal fluid (β-amyloid peptide with 42 amino acids and 
hyperphosphorylated tau protein) than in the neuropsychological and functional 
assessments. Even this small clinical effect will be encouraging for the 
development of new research, particularly helped by the greater ease of 
diagnosis and monitoring of the evolution of AD pathophysiology with plasma 
biomarkers. Recently, new diagnostic criteria for AD were presented by the 
Alzheimer's Association, causing controversy about their use in clinical 
practice.

Publisher: Com base na minha atividade de neurologista clínico com mais de 50 
anos de experiência no atendimento de pacientes com doença de Alzheimer (DA), 
foco neste artigo de revisão nos dois aspectos fundamentais da doença para o 
médico: o diagnóstico e o tratamento. Os critérios diagnósticos de 1984 
permaneceram estáveis por mais de um quarto de século quando foram substituídos 
em 2011. Desde então, muitas descobertas foram feitas, especialmente de 
biomarcadores que têm grande impacto no diagnóstico da DA. Recentemente, 
biomarcadores de DA tornaram-se disponíveis no plasma, o que certamente causará 
uma grande mudança no diagnóstico da DA biológica, termo que ainda necessita de 
cuidados e informações para a sociedade antes de ser utilizado na prática 
clínica. Três anticorpos monoclonais contra o peptídeo β-amiloide também foram 
aprovados recentemente e dois deles mostraram efeito pequeno, mas 
estatisticamente significativo, no resultado clínico. Esses anticorpos 
monoclonais tiveram maior efeito na redução de placas amiloides no cérebro 
avaliadas por tomografia por emissão de pósitrons (positron emission tomography, 
PET, em inglês) e na concentração de biomarcadores no líquido cefalorraquidiano 
(peptídeo β-amiloide com 42 aminoácidos e proteína tau hiperfosforilada) do que 
nas avaliações neuropsicológicas e funcionais. Mesmo este pequeno efeito clínico 
poderá ser encorajador para o desenvolvimento de novas pesquisas, 
particularmente auxiliado pela maior facilidade de diagnóstico e monitoramento 
da evolução da fisiopatologia da DA com biomarcadores plasmáticos eficientes 
para diagnóstico ou controle evolutivo. Recentemente, novos critérios 
diagnósticos para a DA foram apresentados pela Alzheimer's Association causando 
controvérsia quanto ao seu emprego na prática clínica.

BACKGROUND: Hearing impairment is a known risk factor for Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), although less is known about vision impairment or dual sensory impairment 
(DSI) as risk factors for AD. We studied the association between diagnosed 
hearing impairment, visual impairment, or DSI, and the risk of AD.
METHOD: The Medication use and Alzheimer's disease study (MEDALZ) is a 
register-based nested case-control study including 70,718 community-dwelling 
persons diagnosed with incident AD in 2005-2011 in Finland and their 282,845 
matched controls. Sensory impairment diagnoses (limited to those that cause 
irreversible sensory loss designated by medical specialists) at least five years 
prior to AD diagnosis (or matching date) were obtained from national healthcare 
registers, including specialized outpatient visits. Associations were studied 
with cofounder-adjusted conditional logistic regression.
RESULTS: Hearing impairment was associated with an increased risk of AD compared 
to people without a diagnosed sensory impairment (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 
1.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.11-1.19), while no association was found in 
people with visual (aOR 1.02, 95% CI 0.99-1.05) or dual sensory impairment (aOR 
1.05 (95% CI 0.95-1.15).
CONCLUSIONS: Hearing impairment can be a modifiable risk factor for AD, and thus 
its treatment in the aging population is important. Although we did not observe 
an association between visual impairment and AD, all sensory impairments 
decrease functioning and quality of life among older adults. Therefore, they 
should be treated, also among persons with cognitive decline or cognitive 
disorder.

The integration of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) with disease genome-wide 
association studies (GWASs) has proven successful in prioritizing candidate 
genes at disease-associated loci. QTL mapping has been focused on multi-tissue 
expression QTLs or plasma protein QTLs (pQTLs). We generated a cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) pQTL atlas by measuring 6,361 proteins in 3,506 samples. We 
identified 3,885 associations for 1,883 proteins, including 2,885 new pQTLs, 
demonstrating unique genetic regulation in CSF. We identified CSF-enriched 
pleiotropic regions on chromosome (chr)3q28 near OSTN and chr19q13.32 near APOE 
that were enriched for neuron specificity and neurological development. We 
integrated our associations with Alzheimer's disease (AD) through proteome-wide 
association study (PWAS), colocalization and Mendelian randomization and 
identified 38 putative causal proteins, 15 of which have drugs available. 
Finally, we developed a proteomics-based AD prediction model that outperforms 
genetics-based models. These findings will be instrumental to further understand 
the biology and identify causal and druggable proteins for brain and 
neurological traits.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus and Alzheimer's disease, are two closely related 
pathological situations that are connected at the molecular level. In recent 
years, amylin, which is co-secreted with insulin, has been proposed for being a 
main actor in this context due to its capacity to form aggregates in a 
β-sheet-like structure. In a diabetic milieu, there is an increase in the 
production and secretion of insulin and amylin. We have analysed the role of 
resveratrol on aggregate formation and in the production of extracellular 
vesicles with amylin in its interior and in pancreatic β cells overexpressing 
human amylin (INS1E-hIAPP). Furthermore, we have explored the consequences of 
the exposition of the conditioned medium derived from INS1E-hIAPP in the 
hippocampal cell line HT-22 and the role of resveratrol in this cell line. 
Hippocampal cells were exposed to conditioned media obtained from rat insulinoma 
1E overexpressing human amylin in the presence or in the absence of resveratrol. 
When we exposed HT-22 cells to the conditioned media of INS1E-hIAPP we observed 
amylin-aggregates inside HT-22 cells. Resveratrol was able to alleviate this 
effect not only in HT-22 but also in pancreatic β cells. Furthermore, 
resveratrol decreased the average exosome size produced by the INS1E-hIAPP 
stimulated with high glucose, diminishing the toxic effect of these exosomes in 
HT-22 cells. We have uncovered that resveratrol inhibits the aggregation 
capacity of amylin and it can diminish the deleterious spreading of the toxic 
protein, to other cell types such as the hippocampal neuron cells, HT-22.

Alzheimer's disease is one of at least 26 diseases characterized by tau-positive 
accumulation in neurons, glia or both. However, it is still unclear what 
modifications cause soluble tau to transform into insoluble aggregates. We 
previously performed genetic screens that identified tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) as 
a candidate regulator of tau levels. Here we verified this finding and found 
that TYK2 phosphorylates tau at tyrosine 29 (Tyr29) leading to its stabilization 
and promoting its aggregation in human cells. We discovered that TYK2-mediated 
Tyr29 phosphorylation interferes with autophagic clearance of tau. We also show 
that TYK2-mediated phosphorylation of Tyr29 facilitates pathological tau 
accumulation in P301S tau-transgenic mice. Furthermore, knockdown of Tyk2 
reduced total tau and pathogenic tau levels and rescued gliosis in a tauopathy 
mouse model. Collectively, these data suggest that partial inhibition of TYK2 
could thus be a strategy to reduce tau levels and toxicity.

Marinobacter nauticus strain GH3 was isolated from the Red Sea, Sharm Elshiekh, 
and classified according to cultural attributes, biochemical properties, and the 
analysis of genetic relationships using 16 S rRNA sequences. A substantial 
proportion of exopolysaccharides (EPS) in GH3-EPS contained a sulfate content of 
25.4%, uronic acid (12.18%), and N-acetylglucosamine (13.6%). The composition of 
monosaccharides in this fraction consists of glucose, glucoronic acid, 
arabinose, and xylose by 2:4:3:3, respectively. SEM showed a flower-like shape 
with white bundles on the GH3-EPS surface. GH3-EPS enhancement of the RAW264.7

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Previous study has demonstrated lancao decoction 
(LC), a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) fomula and recorded in 
"Huangdineijing", has a therapeutic effect on cognitive impairment (early 
clinical manifestations of alzheimer's disease (AD), which suggests that LC may 
have potential therapeutic advantages for AD. Whether LC has the therapeutic 
effect on AD and its potential mechanisms were still further indicated.
AIM OF THE STUDY: In this study, we aimed to uncover the potential advantage and 
neuronal mechanisms of LC in the treatment of AD in APP/PS1 mice in the 
hippocampus.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: We chose APP/PS1 mice to combing with behavioral tests 
including morris water maze (MWM) or y-maze to determine the role of LC in the 
therapeutic actions of AD. Network pharmacology was used to screen potential 
targets and pathways involving in LC's treatments of AD. Western blot was used 
to detect the phosphorylated expressions of proteins in hippocampus in APP/PS1 
mice in the hippocampus. Pharmacological interventions were used to elucidate 
the relationship between the role of LC in the treatment of AD and the pathway, 
as well as the upstream and downstream interactions with neuronal activities.
RESULTS: According to our previous LC effective dose (2.5 g/kg), the dose was 
also able to significantly reduce the latency to the platform, and significantly 
increase the number of crossing times and time spend in the target quadrant in 
APP/PS1 mice in MWM, which was consistent with donepezil (DON) after 14 days 
chronic treatments. Network pharmacology showed that PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways 
were closely associated with LC's treatments of AD, and protein 
autophosphorylation played a role in this process. The phosphorylated 
expressions of PI3K and AKT were obviously reduced in APP/PS1 mice in the 
hippocampus, which were both reversed by LC or DON. The phosphorylated 
expressions of MAPK including P38, JNK and ERK were also significantly reduced 
in APP/PS1 mice hippocampus, but only the phosphorylated expression of ERK was 
reversed by LC or DON. Inhibiting the activities of PI3K/AKT pathway by LY294002 
blocked LC's improvement of behavioral deficits in APP/PS1 mice, including 
reducing latency to platform and increasing the number of crossings time in MWM 
in APP/PS1 mice, which also blunted LC's up-regulated phosphorylated expressions 
of PI3K, AKT and ERK in the hippocampus. Moreover, suppressing the activities of 
ERK by PD98059 also blocked LC's improvement of AD-related behavioral deficits 
including decreasing latency to new arm and increasing time in new arm in y-maze 
test, which also inhibited LC's enhancement of synaptic proteins (PSD95 and 
synapsin1) in the hippocampus and the number of EGR1-positive cells in the 
hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG).
CONCLUSIONS: Take together, our study revealed that LC had the therapeutic 
effects on AD by activating the PI3K/AKT pathway to enhance ERK activity and 
further strengthened neuronal activities in the hippocampus.

The therapeutic interest of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) drugs for the 
treatment of neuroinflammation has been recently acknowledged. Nevertheless, 
most of them display limited passage across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). 
Therefore, this study investigated the potential of intranasal (IN) delivery of 
six RAS drugs to circumvent the BBB and attain the brain, envisioning its future 
use in central nervous system (CNS) neuroinflammatory diseases, such as 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Captopril, enalaprilat, irbesartan, lisinopril, 
losartan and valsartan were firstly screened based on their impact on the 
viability of nasal, lung, and neuronal cell lines and their apparent 
permeability (Papp) across porcine olfactory mucosa. Irbesartan, identified as 
the one with the best safety and permeability balance, was selected for 
pharmacokinetic characterization following single and multidose IN 
administration to CD-1 mice. The results were compared to those obtained by 
intravenous (IV) injection to assess direct nose-to-brain drug delivery. 
Olfactory toxicity and anxiety were also evaluated after multidose IN treatment. 
Irbesartan IN administration significantly enhanced brain targeting, with a 
3-fold increase in the maximum concentration (Cmax) and a 2.5-fold increase in 
the area under the curve (AUCt) in the brain compared to IV route. The drug 
exhibited a tmax of 15 min post-IN administration and achieved a brain targeting 
efficiency of 239.56%, with a significant direct transport percentage of 58.26%. 
Multidose administration indicated no systemic or tissue accumulation, with 
accumulation ratio (Rac) values below 1.0, and no significant olfactory 
toxicity. Overall, the study highlights the potential of IN delivery of 
irbesartan as a promising strategy to improve brain targeting and therapeutic 
outcomes in CNS diseases such as AD, providing an effective approach to bypass 
BBB limitations.

There are currently over forty degenerative diseases that are correlated with 
abnormal accumulation of peptide/protein aggregates in the human body, such as 
Alzheimer's disease. Due to their unique physiochemical properties (e.g., small 
size, large surface-to-volume ratio, and facile surface modification), silver 
nanoparticles (AgNPs) have been considered potential substrates for designing 
inhibitors against amyloid fibrillogenesis. Metal polyphenolic network (MPN) 
that combines the characteristics of organic and inorganic components has been 
used to suppress amyloid fibril formation. This study is aimed at investigating 
the effects of MPN-coated AgNPs (MPN-AgNPs) on the in vitro amyloid 
fibrillogenesis of hen lysozyme (HEWL). The two types of MPN-AgNPs (Zn/MPN-AgNPs 
and Co/MPN-AgNPs) were synthesized through chemical reduction and metal 
chelation, and their particle sizes were determined to be in the range of 
40-60 nm. The characterization of MPN-AgNPs by ζ-potential and transmission 
electron microscopy showed that the MPN-AgNPs had negative surface charge and 
spherical-shaped morphology. Furthermore, the elemental analysis demonstrated 
that the MPN was uniformly coated on the surface of AgNPs. The thioflavin T 
fluorescence results revealed that the Co/MPN-AgNPs showed a better percent of 
inhibition compared to Zn/MPN-AgNPs and TA-AgNPs. The kinetics data of amyloid 
fibril formation in the presence of MPN-AgNPs were analyzed using the sigmoidal 
curve, showing that the MPN-AgNPs reduced fibril growth rate and prolonged lag 
time. Our findings also demonstrated that MPN-AgNPs could effectively suppress 
HEWL aggregation upon binding to aggregation-prone regions. The quenching of 
intrinsic fluorescence of HEWL by MPN-AgNPs was found to be a static type. 
Moreover, the fluorescence quenching data were analyzed using the modified 
Stern-Volmer equation to determine the number of binding sites. Notably, our 
findings indicated that the binding between HEWL and MPN-AgNPs was mainly 
governed by hydrophobic interaction. This work offers an excellent example of 
utilizing MPN-based materials as anti-aggregating/anti-fibrillogenic nano-drugs 
for the treatment of amyloidosis.

BACKGROUND: Place of death is relevant both for individuals and for the society. 
Home is universally considered the optimal place of death while dying in 
hospital may be a signal of inappropriate end-of-life care. We aimed at studying 
the place of death of patients with cancer in Italy in a five-year period.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The death-certificate database published by the Italian 
National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) was analysed, searching the place of 
death and the main disease related to death. Data from 2015 to 2019 were used, 
to exclude the influence of the COVID pandemic. Cancer, "cognitive impairment 
and Alzheimer's disease" (CIAD) and "cardiovascular and cerebrovascular 
diseases" (CCD) were the examined diseases. The place of death was categorized 
as "acute care hospital", "hospice" or "other long-term care (LTC) structures" 
and "home". We implemented an ordinary linear regression model to verify whether 
there was a statistically significant variation across the selected time (i), 
and whether a substitution effect among sites of death could be hypothesized 
(ii).
RESULTS: Data on 769,517 deaths were retrieved. In 2019 35.39 % patients with 
cancer died in hospital, 39.57 % died at home and 20.06 % died in hospice or in 
other LTC structures. In the examined period, death at home decreased by 3.09 % 
(95 % C.I. -3.18 - -2.99; p<0.01); death in hospice and long-term structures 
increased by 2.71 % (95 % C.I. 2.66 - 2.76; p<0.01); death in hospital increased 
by 0.3 % (95 % C.I. 0.23 - 0.36; p<0.01). For patients with CIAD, death in 
hospital increased by 0.98 % (95 % C.I. 0.80 - 1.17; p<001) and for patients 
with CCD decreased by 1.43 % (95 % I.C. -1.47 - -1.39; p<0.01). Death at home 
decreased in both diseases.
CONCLUSIONS: More than one-third of cancer patients die in acute care hospitals 
and this percentage is slightly increasing in the analysed period. Mortality at 
home decreased in all the examined diseases. Dying at home is being 
progressively less frequent, while hospitals continue to represent a frequent 
place of death.

IMPORTANCE: Blast-related mild traumatic brain injuries (TBIs), the "signature 
injury" of post-9/11 conflicts, are associated with clinically relevant, 
long-term cognitive, psychological, and behavioral dysfunction and disability; 
however, the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate associations between a history of remote blast-related 
mild TBI and regional brain volume in a sample of US veterans and active duty 
service members.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective cohort study of US veterans and 
active duty service members from the Long-Term Impact of Military-Relevant Brain 
Injury Consortium-Chronic Effects of Neurotrauma Consortium (LIMBIC-CENC), which 
enrolled more than 1500 participants at 5 sites used in this analysis between 
2014 and 2023. Participants were recruited from Veterans Affairs medical centers 
across the US; 774 veterans and active duty service members of the US military 
met eligibility criteria for this secondary analysis. Assessment dates were from 
January 6, 2015, to March 31, 2023; processing and analysis dates were from 
August 1, 2023, to January 15, 2024.
EXPOSURE: All participants had combat exposure, and 82% had 1 or more lifetime 
mild TBIs with variable injury mechanisms.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Regional brain volume was calculated using 
tensor-based morphometry on 3-dimensional, T1-weighted magnetic resonance 
imaging scans; history of TBI, including history of blast-related mild TBI, was 
assessed by structured clinical interview. Cognitive performance and psychiatric 
symptoms were assessed with a battery of validated instruments. We hypothesized 
that regional volume would be smaller in the blast-related mild TBI group and 
that this would be associated with cognitive performance.
RESULTS: A total of 774 veterans (670 [87%] male; mean [SD] age, 40.1 [9.8] 
years; 260 [34%] with blast-related TBI) were included in the sample. 
Individuals with a history of blast-related mild TBI had smaller brain volumes 
than individuals without a history of blast-related mild TBI (which includes 
uninjured individuals and those with non-blast-related mild TBI) in several 
clusters, with the largest centered bilaterally in the superior corona radiata 
and subcortical gray and white matter (cluster peak Cohen d range, -0.23 to 
-0.38; mean [SD] Cohen d, 0.28 [0.03]). Additionally, causal mediation analysis 
revealed that these volume differences significantly mediated the association 
between blast-related mild TBI and performance on measures of working memory and 
processing speed.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of 774 veterans and active duty 
service members, robust volume differences associated with blast-related TBI 
were identified. Furthermore, these volume differences significantly mediated 
the association between blast-related mild TBI and cognitive function, 
indicating that this pattern of brain differences may have implications for 
daily functioning.

IMPORTANCE: An accessible marker of both biological age and dementia risk is 
crucial to advancing dementia prevention and treatment strategies. Although 
frailty is a candidate for that role, the nature of the relationship between 
frailty and dementia is not well understood.
OBJECTIVE: To clarify the temporal relationship between frailty and incident 
dementia by investigating frailty trajectories in the years preceding dementia 
onset.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Participant data came from 4 prospective 
cohort studies: the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, the Health and 
Retirement Study, the Rush Memory and Aging Project, and the National Alzheimer 
Coordinating Center. Data were collected between 1997 and 2024 and were analyzed 
from July 2023 to August 2024. The settings were retirement communities, 
national-level surveys, and a multiclinic-based cohort. Included individuals 
were 60 years or older and without cognitive impairment at baseline. Included 
individuals also had data on age, sex, education level, and ethnicity and a 
frailty index score calculated at baseline.
EXPOSURE: Frailty was the main exposure, with participants' degrees of frailty 
quantified using retrospectively calculated frailty index scores.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incident all-cause dementia ascertained through 
physician-derived diagnoses, self- and informant-report, and estimated 
classifications based on combinations of cognitive tests.
RESULTS: The participant number before exclusions was 87 737. After exclusions, 
data from 29 849 participants (mean [SD] age, 71.6 [7.7] years; 18 369 female 
[62%]; 257 963 person-years of follow-up; 3154 cases of incident dementia) were 
analyzed. Bayesian generalized linear mixed regression models revealed 
accelerations in frailty trajectories 4 to 9 years before incident dementia. 
Overall, frailty was positively associated with dementia risk (adjusted hazard 
ratios [aHRs] ranged from 1.18; 95% CI, 1.13-1.24 to 1.73; 95% CI, 1.57-1.92). 
This association held among participants whose time between frailty measurement 
and incident dementia exceeded the identified acceleration period (aHRs ranged 
from 1.18; 95% CI, 1.12-1.23 to 1.43; 95% CI, 1.14-1.80).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that frailty measurements may 
be used to identify high-risk population groups for preferential enrolment into 
clinical trials for dementia prevention and treatment. Frailty itself may 
represent a useful upstream target for behavioral and societal approaches to 
dementia prevention.

Epidemiological evidence suggests the presence of common risk factors for the 
development and prognosis of both cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases, 
including stroke, Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, heart, and peripheral 
vascular diseases. Accumulation of harmful blood signals may induce organotypic 
endothelial dysfunction affecting blood-brain barrier function and vascular 
health in age-related diseases. Genetic-, age-, lifestyle- or cardiovascular 
therapy-associated imbalance of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptide metabolism in the 
brain and periphery may be the missing link between age-related 
neurocardiovascular diseases. Genetic polymorphisms of genes related to Aβ 
metabolism, lifestyle modifications, drugs used in clinical practice, and 
Aβ-specific treatments may modulate Aβ levels, affecting brain, vascular, and 
cardiac diseases. This narrative review elaborates on the effects of 
interventions on Aβ metabolism in the brain, cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and 
peripheral heart or vascular tissues. Implications for clinical applicability, 
gaps in knowledge, and future perspectives of Aβ as the link among age-related 
neurocardiovascular diseases are also discussed.

OBJECTIVES: To describe the performance of the Healthy Aging Brain Care Monitor 
Self Report (HABC-M SR) in assessment of post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) 
among Acute Respiratory Failure ICU survivors.
DESIGN: Secondary data analysis of a randomized controlled trial.
SETTING: Patients evaluated by a nurse care coordinator in an out-of-hospital 
setting.
PATIENTS: English-speaking adults 18 years old or older who were admitted to the 
ICU with acute respiratory failure requiring invasive or noninvasive mechanical 
ventilation for greater than or equal to 24 hours.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients randomized to the intervention arm of the mobile 
critical care recovery program, a negative trial testing multidisciplinary care 
to improve quality of life.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: HABC-M SR scale was used to assess PICS in the 
intervention group at ICU discharge, 3, and 6 months post-discharge. Hospital 
Anxiety and Depression Scale; Pain, Enjoyment of Life, and General Activity 
Scale; Timed Up and Go; and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information 
System sleep scores were obtained at the same time. Mini-Mental State 
Examination (MMSE) was administered at baseline and 6 months. ICU survivors 
reported mild PICS symptoms, which improved over 6 months (mean HABC-M SR 
scores: baseline [8.5, sd 7.6], 3 mo [5.3 mo, sd 6.6 mo], and 6 mo [5.2 mo, sd 
6.9 mo; p < 0.001]). HABC-M SR total score had moderate internal consistency 
that improved over time (Cronbach's alpha = 0.78 at baseline and 0.84 at 6 mo). 
The psychological subscale of HABC-M SR was moderately correlated with 
standardized scales for mood, pain, and sleep. The cognitive subscale was not 
significantly correlated with MMSE.
CONCLUSIONS: While HABC-M SR correlated with mood, physical, and sleep symptoms, 
the cognitive subscale was less sensitive compared with standardized scales.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic, progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
marked by permanent impairment of brain function across the whole brain. This 
condition results in a progressive deterioration of cognitive function in 
patients and is frequently associated with psychological symptoms such as 
agitation and anxiety, imposing a significant burden on both patients and their 
families. Nanomaterials possess numerous distinctive physical and chemical 
features that render them extensively utilized. In the biomedical domain, 
nanomaterials can be utilized for disease prevention and therapy, including 
medication delivery systems, biosensors, and tissue engineering. This article 
explores the etiology and potential molecular processes of AD, as well as the 
application of carbon-based nanomaterials in the diagnosis and treatment of AD. 
Some of such nanomaterials are carbon quantum dots, carbon nanotubes, and 
graphene, among others. These materials possess distinctive physicochemical 
features that render them highly promising for applications in biosensing, drug 
delivery, neuroprotection, and photothermal treatment. In addition, this review 
explored various therapeutic approaches for AD in terms of reducing 
inflammation, preventing oxidative damage, and inhibiting Aβ aggregation. The 
advent of carbon nanomaterials in nanotechnology has facilitated the development 
of novel treatment approaches for Alzheimer's disease. These strategies provide 
promising approaches for early diagnosis, effective intervention and 
neuroprotection of the disease.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory 
loss and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). Given that 
cholinergic neurons are predominantly affected in AD, current treatments 
primarily aim to enhance cholinergic neurotransmission. However, imbalances in 
other neurotransmitters, such as γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), also contribute to 
AD symptomatology. In the presented research, using a combination of 
crystallography and computational methods we developed compound 6 as a dual 
modulator of GABAergic and cholinergic neurotransmission systems. Compound 6 
demonstrated inhibition of BuChE (IC50=0.21 μM) and GABA transporter 1 
(IC50=10.96 μM) and 3 (IC50=7.76 μM), along with a favorable drug-likeness 
profile. Subsequent in vivo studies revealed the effectiveness of 6 in enhancing 
memory retention and alleviating anxiety and depression symptoms in animal 
models, while also proving safe and bioavailable for oral administration. The 
innovative multi-target-directed ligand 6 offers a new approach to treating 
cognitive deficits and BPSD in AD.

In the current scenario, Alzheimer's disease is a complex, challenging, and 
arduous health issue, and its prevalence, together with comorbidities, is 
accelerating around the universe. Alzheimer's disease is becoming a primary 
concern that significantly impacts an individual's status in life. The 
traditional treatment of Alzheimer's disease includes some synthetic drugs, 
which have numerous dangerous side effects, a high risk of recurrence, lower 
bioavailability, and limited treatment. Hence, the current article is a detailed 
study and review of all known information on plant-derived compounds as natural 
anti-Alzheimer's agents, including their biological sources, active 
phytochemical ingredients, and a possible mode of action. With the help of a 
scientific data search engine, including the National Center for Biotechnology 
Information (NCBI/PubMed), Science Direct, and Google Scholar, analysis from 
2001 to 2024 has been completed. This article also described clinical studies on 
phytoconstituents used to treat Alzheimer's disease. Plant-derived compounds 
offer promising alternatives to synthetic drugs in treating Alzheimer's disease, 
with the potential for improving cognitive function and slowing down the 
progression of the disease. Further research and clinical trials are needed to 
fully explore their therapeutic potential and develop effective strategies for 
managing this complex condition.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by neurodegeneration 
linked to amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau protein tangles. Protein kinase C alpha 
(PKCα) plays a crucial role in modulating amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP) 
processing, potentially mitigating AD progression. Consequently, PKCα stands out 
as a promising target for AD therapy.
OBJECTIVE: Despite the identification of numerous inhibitors, the pursuit of 
more effective and precisely targeted PKCα inhibitors remains crucial.
METHODS: In this study, we employed an integrated virtual screening approach of 
molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to identify 
phytochemical inhibitors of PKCα from the IMPPAT database.
RESULTS: Molecular docking screening via InstaDock identified compounds with 
strong binding affinities to PKCα. Subsequent ADMET and PASS analyses filtered 
out compounds with favorable pharmacokinetic profiles. Interaction analysis 
using Discovery Studio Visualizer and PyMOL further elucidated binding 
conformations of selected compounds with PKCα. Top hits underwent 200 ns MD 
simulations using GROMACS to validate stability of the interactions. Finally, we 
propose two phytochemicals, Kammogenin and Imperialine, with appreciable 
drug-likeliness and binding potential with PKCα.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the findings suggest Kammogenin and Imperialine as 
potential PKCα inhibitors, highlighting their therapeutic promise for AD after 
further validation.

Deciphering the molecular communications along the gut-brain axis can help in 
understanding the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases and exploiting 
the gut microbiome for therapeutics. However, gut microbes and their metabolites 
have a multifaceted role in mediating both brain physiology and 
neurodegenerative pathology. There is a lack of understanding of how and when 
this role is tipped in neurodegenerative diseases and what are those 
contributing factors, both at local (gut) and distal (neuronal) levels, that 
drive this imbalance. Here we have reviewed the gut microbiome and its 
metabolites in the context of the gut-brain axis and summarized how different 
factors such as gut-microbial diversity, their metabolites, the role of the 
native immune system and the integrity of gut epithelial and blood-brain 
barriers are interconnected and collectively define the involvement of 
gut-microbiome in neurodegenerative pathologies. It also underlines the need for 
multidisciplinary tools and animal models to simultaneously reflect on many of 
these factors and to better correlate with clinical observations and data 
obtained from human biopsies and fecal samples. Harnessing the gut-brain axis 
will herald a paradigm shift in medicine for neurodegenerative diseases and 
aging, emphasizing the significance of the microbiome in the broader spectrum of 
health and disease.

This preclinical AD CSF proteome study identified a panel of 12-CSF markers 
detecting amyloid positivity and clinical progression to AD with high accuracy; 
some of these CSF proteins related to immune function, neurotrophic processes, 
energy metabolism and endolysosomal functioning (e.g., ITGB2, CLEC5A, IGFBP-1, 
CST3) changed before amyloid positivity is established.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the mechanism by which Yigong San (YGS) improves learning 
and memory abilities of APP/PS1 transgenic mice in light of cerebral fluid 
metabolism regulation.
METHODS: Three-month-old male APP/PS1 transgenic mice and wild-type C57BL/6 mice 
were both randomized into control group, model group, donepezil (1.67 mg/kg) 
group, and YGS (7.5 g/kg) group and received the corresponding treatments via 
gavage once daily for one month. After the treatments, the mice were assessed 
for learning and memory functions using Morris water maze test and examined for 
hippocampal and cortical pathologies and amyloid plaques using HE, 
immunohistochemical and thioflavin S staining; ELISA and Evans blue method were 
used for detecting Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 levels in the brain tissue and serum and 
assessing blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity. Immunofluorescence colocalization 
was used to investigate AQP4 polarization on astrocytes. Western blotting was 
performed to detect the expressions of VE-cadherin, ZO-1, occludin, β-amyloid 
precursor protein (APP), BACE1, insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), LRP1, RAGE, and 
AQP4 proteins.
RESULTS: Compared with the control mice, APP/PS1 mice showed significant 
impairment of learning and memory abilities, increased degeneration or necrosis 
of hippocampal and cortical neurons, pathological scores, Aβ-positive plaques, 
elevated Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 levels in the brain tissue and serum, increased BBB 
permeability, upregulated RAGE expression, lowered expressions of VE-cadherin, 
LRP1, ZO-1, occludin, and AQP4 proteins, and reduced AQP4- expressing 
GFAP-positive cells. YGS treatment significantly improved the performance of the 
transgenic mice in Morris water maze test, reduced hippocampal and cortical 
pathologies and Aβ-positive plaques, and ameliorated the abnormal changes in 
Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 levels, BBB permeability, protein expressions of RAGE, 
VE-cadherin, LRP1, ZO-1, occludin and AQP4, and the number of AQP4-expressing 
GFAP-positive cells.
CONCLUSION: YGS improves learning and memory changes in APP/PS1 mice by 
ameliorating neuronal damage and Aβ pathology in the brain and regulating brain 
fluid metabolism.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Neuroinflammation, a low-grade chronic inflammation of the 
central nervous system, is linked to age-related neuropsychiatric disorders such 
as senile depression and Alzheimer's disease. Recent studies have explored 
controlling neuroinflammation as a novel treatment strategy. Molecular hydrogen 
shows anti-inflammatory effects. However, its impacts on neuroinflammation and 
age-related neuropsychiatric disorders remain unelucidated. We investigated 
molecular hydrogen's effects on microglial activation, neuroinflammation, 
depressive-like behavior, and short-term cognitive decline in 
senescence-accelerated mouse-prone 8 (SAMP8) mice.
METHODS: Six-week-old SAMP8 or senescence-accelerated mouse-resistant 1 (SAMR1) 
mice received hydrogen-rich jelly (HRJ) or placebo jelly (PJ) from six weeks of 
age for 26-28 weeks. Depressive-like behavior was assessed using tail suspension 
and forced swimming tests, while cognitive function was evaluated using the 
Y-maze and object recognition tests. Brain tissues were used for 
immunohistochemical studies or to measure pro-inflammatory cytokine levels via 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
RESULTS: HRJ intake reduced immobility time in both tail suspension and forced 
swimming tests and enhanced visual cognitive and spatial working memory in SAMP8 
mice. Additionally, HRJ intake suppressed the 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine 
(8-OHdG), Iba1, and cleaved caspase 3 expression levels in the medial prefrontal 
cortex and hippocampal dentate gyrus. Furthermore, HRJ intake significantly 
lowered IL-6 levels in brain tissues of SAMP8 mice.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that molecular hydrogen treatment may 
regulate neuroinflammation induced by activated microglia and improve 
depressive-like behavior and short-term cognitive impairment in SAMP8 mice.

Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's 
disease (PD), Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington disease (HD), and 
Multiple sclerosis (MS), pose a significant global health challenge due to their 
intricate pathology and limited therapeutic interventions. Natural products 
represent invaluable reservoirs for combating these neurodegenerative diseases 
by targeting key pathological hallmarks such as protein aggregation, synaptic 
dysfunction, aberrant proteostasis, cytoskeletal abnormalities, altered energy 
homeostasis, inflammation, and neuronal cell death. This review provides an 
in-depth analysis of the mechanisms and therapeutic targets of natural products 
for their neuroprotective effects. Furthermore, it elucidates the current 
progress of clinical trials investigating the potential of natural products in 
delaying neurodegeneration. The objective of this review is to enhance the 
comprehension of natural products in the prevention and treatment of 
neurodegenerative diseases, offering new insights and potential avenues for 
future pharmaceutical research.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disease, 
is characterized by the deposition of extracellular amyloid plaques and 
intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. Conventional anti-AD drugs exhibit high 
toxicity and adversely impact patients' quality of life. Therefore, novel 
treatments for AD are urgently required. In recent years, targeting ferroptosis 
through the modulation of lipid oxidation has emerged as a new approach in the 
treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Catalpol, an iridoid glycoside isolated 
from the roots of Rehmannia glutinosa, has exhibited anti-inflammatory, 
antioxidant, and neuroprotective properties. Therefore, in this study, we 
investigated the protective effects and associated underlying mechanisms of 
catalpol in an APP/PS1 AD mouse model. Catalpol treatment significantly improved 
the cognitive capabilities and decreased Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 levels in mice. 
Morphological testing revealed that catalpol prevented neuronal loss and reduced 
mitochondrial swelling in the hippocampal CA1 region. Proteomic studies 
identified 2495 hippocampus proteins whose expression was associated with the 
mechanism of catalpol treatment, including 44 ferroptosis-related proteins. 
Bioinformatic analysis revealed that catalpol significantly increased the 
protein levels of HSPA5 and GPX4 in the hippocampus. Additionally, catalpol 
modulated biological pathways related to apoptosis, cytokine-mediated signaling, 
and ferroptosis. The considerable upregulation of HSPA5 and GPX4 with catalpol 
was further confirmed through western blotting. Catalpol exhibited 
neuroprotective effects through a variety of mechanisms. Among these, HSPA5 and 
GPX4, associated with ferroptosis, may play key roles in AD pathogenesis, and 
present promising therapeutic targets.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cancer, both age-related diseases, are 
characterized by abnormal cellular behavior. Epidemiological data indicate an 
inverse relationship between AD and various cancers. Accordingly, this study 
seeks to analyze the negatively correlated genes between AD and ovarian cancer 
and identify closely related compounds through virtual screening technology to 
explore potential therapeutic drugs.
METHODS: Microarray data were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus 
database, and negatively correlated genes between AD and ovarian cancer were 
identified using bioinformatics analysis. Clinical prognostic and survival 
analyses were performed to identify genes most negatively associated with these 
diseases. The top ten compounds with the strongest binding to the target genes 
were screened from the ChemDiv database using virtual screening technology, 
considering the blood-brain barrier. Molecular dynamics simulations were used to 
identify potential sites for the binding of these compounds to the target 
protein MX1. Additionally, point mutation analysis of the target protein was 
performed. Finally, the binding site was verified in vitro.
RESULTS: The MX1 gene was most significantly negatively associated with AD and 
ovarian cancer. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed intersection sites at 
Glu-227 and Gly-188, where MX1 binds tightly to the head compound.
CONCLUSION: This study successfully identified MX1 as being negatively 
associated with AD and ovarian cancer and assessed the potential drug compounds 
that bind most closely to it. Our findings provide important rationale and 
candidate targets for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for AD and 
ovarian cancer.

N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, activated by glutamate, play a crucial 
role in learning and memory. Memantine (MEM), a non-competitive NMDA receptor 
antagonist, is currently prescribed for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease or 
dementia, which meanwhile simultaneously promotes a need to clarify its 
potential pro-cognitive effects that exist in normal healthy individuals. 
However, the neurobehavioral mechanisms underlying the cognitive improvement by 
MEM in normal individuals remain to be elucidated. This study aimed to assess 
the effects of MEM on working memory, measured by a discrete paired-trial delay 
alternation task in a T-maze in normal male rats. The impacts of MEM were 
hypothesized to vary depending on different baseline levels of working memory 
performance. Neurochemical examination of the levels of 
calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase 2 (CaMKII) and NMDA receptor subunits within 
five targeted brain regions was conducted after behavioral tests. The results 
showed that acute administration of MEM enhanced working memory performance, 
with 2.5, 5.0, and 10 mg/kg doses increasing task accuracy compared to the 
vehicle, particularly in low performers. Neurochemically, the protein expression 
of CaMKII in the amygdala and that of the glutamate (Glu) N2A subunit in the 
dorsal striatum were greater in the low-performance group than in the 
high-performance group. Additionally, the protein expression of the GluN2A 
subunit in the dorsal striatum was negatively associated with task performance 
at baseline. The expression of GluN1 and GluN2B in the nucleus accumbens was 
negatively associated with task performance in the retest three weeks after drug 
treatment. These findings underscore the baseline-dependent improvement of 
working memory resulting from MEM administration, with observed drug effects 
associated with alterations in the levels of NMDA receptor subunits in striatal 
subareas and CaMKII in the amygdala.

Ademetionine 1,4-Butanedisulfonate (SAMe) is widely used as a prescription drug 
to treat cholestasis associated with liver disease, and is also used to treat 
depression, Alzheimer's disease and other diseases. Currently, the main way to 
produce SAMe is by fermentation of S-adenosylmethionine synthetase（SAMS）. 
However, during the fermentation process, host cells produce contaminants 
unrelated to the treatment. Among them, host cell protein (HCP), which is 
co-purified with the drug, is the main impurity in the production process. 
HCP-induced antigenic reactions can lead to allergies or other adverse reactions 
and affect drug quality, efficacy, and safety. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA) and mass spectrometry (MS) are currently used as the main analytical 
methods for measuring HCP. The ELISA method may ignore some HCPs with low 
immunogenicity, while mass spectrometry is primarily employed for the 
characterization of proteomes. Orthogonal methods can more effectively evaluate 
impurities in drugs. In this study, ELISA was initially utilized to quantify the 
content of Saccharomyces cerevisiae host protein in 11 batches of SAMe active 
pharmaceutical ingredient (API) from two suppliers, then the above APIs were 
qualitatively analyzed by MS method. Following the identification of surrogate 
peptide of SAMS, an Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass 
Spectrometry（UPLC-MS/MS）method was established and validated, the SAMS protein 
residues in 11 batches of samples were subsequently determined. The results 
demonstrated that the levels of Saccharomyces cerevisiae host protein and SAMS 
in the samples were both low, with values below 20 ppm and 1.19 ppm, 
respectively. The qualitative results also indicate that the types of peptide 
residues in the samples are more diverse than those of protein residues. 
Furthermore, residues of proteins and peptides can be detected in all samples, 
which underscores the importance of evaluating the HCP in API. This study 
employs a range of complementary detection methods to conduct a comprehensive 
and sensitive evaluation of total HCP and specific proteins in drugs, thereby 
guiding more informed assessments of the risks posed by HCP impurities in raw 
materials during pharmaceutical processes.

Autophagy plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis and progression of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation involved in 
autophagy are associated with the cerebral ischemia-induced exacerbation of 
cognitive deficits in individuals with AD. APP/PS1 mice underwent bilateral 
common carotid artery clamping for 15 min. The degrees of Aβ deposition, 
oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and neuronal and synaptic loss after 
cerebral ischemia were detected. Autophagy levels were assessed by RT-qPCR, 
western blotting, immunofluorescence staining, and transmission electron 
microscopy. DPEs occurring in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice after cerebral 
ischemia were analyzed via label-free proteomics. The present study demonstrated 
that cerebral ischemia exacerbates learning and memory deficits in APP/PS1 mice. 
Cerebral ischemia aggravated the cognitive impairment in APP/PS1 mice by 
worsening neuronal and synaptic loss through damage to intracellular autophagy, 
increased oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. Notably, cerebral ischemia 
interfered with mitochondrial and nuclear transport functions in APP/PS1 
transgenic mice, thereby aggravating cognitive deficits. Cellular transport 
functions may be a target for preventing AD progression. In summary, autophagy 
is impaired in APP/PS1 mice compared with WT mice, and oxidative stress and 
neuroinflammation caused by cerebral ischemia exacerbate autophagy-induced 
damage and are responsible for cognitive decline. Label-free proteomics 
indicated that cerebral ischemia results in abnormal Abcb8, Sestd1, TPR, and 
Rab8a protein expression in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 transgenic mice and that 
an imbalance of mitochondrial transport and nuclear transport functions 
exacerbates cognitive deficits. Improving autophagy and restoring organelle 
transport may be targets for the prevention and treatment of dementia.

Cerebral amyloid plaques in the brain define the elderly neuralgic disorder, 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). The enzyme Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) was reported to 
play a vital role in AD. It was shown that AChE induces amyloid fibril formation 
forming highly toxic AChE-Amyloid-β (Aβ) complexes. AChE can accelerate amyloid 
formation, and its inhibition could prevent such alterations to the enzyme. 
Understanding the proteostasis of AChE and its binding site to cellular 
chaperone GRP78 (Glucose-regulated protein 78) would help find a treatment for 
AD. In this study, the state of the art computational tools were utilized to 
predict the binding location of AChE that can stably associate with the cellular 
chaperone, GRP78. Sequence comparison along with molecular docking predicts two 
binding locations on AChE (C69-C96 and C257-C272) that could bind to GRP78 
substrate binding domain β (SBDβ). The analysis of the docking data suggests 
that the former location has the best average binding affinity value 
(-12.16 kcal/mol) and average interaction pattern (13.9 ± 3.5 H-bonds, 5.5 ± 1.4 
hydrophobic contacts, and 1.4 ± 1.2 salt bridges).

BACKGROUND: Defects in the ataxin-2 (ATXN-2) protein and CAG trinucleotide 
repeat expansion in its coding gene, Atxn-2, cause the neurodegenerative 
disorder spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2). While clinical studies suggest 
potential benefits of human-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) for treating 
various ataxias, the exact mechanisms underlying their therapeutic effects and 
interaction with host tissue to stimulate neurotrophin expression remain unclear 
specifically in the context of SCA2.
METHODS: Human bone marrow-derived MSCs (hMSCs) were injected into the cisterna 
magna of 26-week-old wild-type and SCA2 mice. Mice were assessed for impaired 
motor coordination using the accelerating rotarod, open field test, and 
composite phenotype scoring. At 50 weeks, the cerebellum vermis was harvested 
for protein assessment and immunohistochemical analysis.
RESULTS: Significant loss of NeuN and calbindin was observed in 25-week-old SCA2 
mice. However, after receiving multiple injections of hMSCs starting at 26 weeks 
of age, these mice exhibited a significant improvement in abnormal motor 
performance and a protective effect on Purkinje cells. This beneficial effect 
persisted until the mice reached 50 weeks of age, at which point they were 
sacrificed to study further mechanistic events triggered by the administration 
of hMSCs. Calbindin-positive cells in the Purkinje cell layer expressed 
bone-derived neurotrophic factor after hMSC administration, contributing to the 
protection of cerebellar neurons from cell death.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, repeated administration of hMSCs shows promise in 
alleviating SCA2 symptoms by preserving Purkinje cells, improving neurotrophic 
support, and reducing inflammation, ultimately leading to the preservation of 
locomotor function in SCA2 mice.

The simultaneous targeting of neuroinflammation and cholinergic hypofunction, 
the key pathological changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD), is not addressed by 
drugs currently in clinical trials, highlighting a critical therapeutic gap. We 
propose that dual-acting small molecules that inhibit butyrylcholinesterase 
(BChE) and mitogen-activated protein kinase p38α (p38α MAPK) represent a novel 
strategy to combat AD. This hypothesis is supported by cellular and animal 
studies as well as in silico modelling showing that it is possible to act 
simultaneously on both enzymes. Amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques trigger a 
pro-inflammatory microglial response that overactivates p38α MAPK, leading to 
increased Aβ synthesis, tau hyperphosphorylation, and altered synaptic 
plasticity. Overactivated microglia exacerbate neuroinflammation and cholinergic 
degeneration, ultimately leading to cognitive impairment. Structural 
similarities between the binding sites of BChE and p38α MAPK provide a promising 
basis for the development of dual inhibitors that could alleviate AD symptoms 
and address the underlying pathology.

BACKGROUND: Choline, an essential nutrient, plays a critical role in cognition, 
and may help prevent dementia and mild cognitive impairment. However, studies on 
dietary choline and its derivatives for preventing these conditions are limited 
and inconsistent.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to explore the associations between 
dietary choline intake and the incidence of dementia, Alzheimer disease (AD), 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and current cognitive performance in the United 
Kingdom Biobank cohort.
METHODS: Dietary choline intake was categorized into quartiles of consumption 
based on 24-h dietary recalls, with units expressed as milligrams per day. 
Diagnoses of dementia, AD, and MCI were identified using the International 
Classification of Diseases (ICD-9/10) codes. Current cognitive performance was 
assessed via the computerized touchscreen interface. After adjusting for 
sociodemographic factors, dietary and lifestyle behaviors, and comorbid 
conditions, Cox proportional hazards regression, logistic regression, and 
restricted cubic splines were used to analyze the association between choline 
intake and dementia or cognitive performance.
RESULTS: Among 125,594 participants (55.8% female), with a mean age of 56.1 y 
(range: 40-70 years) at baseline and a median follow-up of 11.8 y, 1103 cases of 
dementia (including 385 AD and 87 cases of MCI) were recorded. U-shaped 
associations were observed between choline intake and dementia and AD. 
Participants in the 2nd quartile of total choline intake had lower risks than 
those in the lowest quartile, with HR of 0.80 (95% CI: 0.67, 0.96) for dementia 
and 0.76 (95% CI: 0.58, 1.00) for AD. Moderate intake of choline derivative, 
including free choline (HR, 0.77; 95%CI, 0.65, 0.92), phosphatidylcholine (HR 
0.82; 95% CI: 0.68, 0.98), sphingomyelin (HR 0.82; 95% CI: 0.69, 0.98) and 
glycerophosphocholine (HR 0.83; 95% CI: 0.70, 1.00), were associated with a 
17%-23% lower odds of dementia. Additionally, moderate total choline intake was 
associated with an 8%-13% lower odds of poor cognitive performance in visual 
attention (OR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.86, 0.99), fluid intelligence (OR: 0.87; 95% CI: 
0.82, 0.92), and complex processing speed (OR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.84, 0.95).
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our findings suggest that moderate dietary choline 
intake, ranging from 332.89 mg/d to 353.93 mg/d, is associated with lower odds 
of dementia and better cognitive performance.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a representative neurodegenerative disease that is 
characterized by the overaccumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) proteins. Since AD is 
accompanied by excessive oxidative stress, which aggravates neurological 
pathologies, the use of antioxidants has been considered to prevent disease 
development. NXP031, a combination of vitamin C (VitC) and an optimized aptamer 
that binds to VitC and stabilizes the reactivity of VitC, was designed. This 
study aimed to evaluate the effects of NXP031 on AD pathology, including Aβ 
accumulation, Aβ-induced oxidative stress, neuronal damage, and 
neuroinflammation. When NXP031 was administered to 5xFAD transgenic mice, NXP031 
exerted a strong inhibitory action on Aβ accumulation, superior to that of VitC, 
by inducing an increase in Aβ-degrading endopeptidase expression. NXP031 
diminished lipid peroxidation levels, activated Nrf2-mediated antioxidant 
pathways, and suppressed overactivated neuroinflammation. An in vitro study 
using Neuro2a cells revealed that NXP031 protects the cells against oxidative 
stress by regulating the MAPK signaling pathway-mediated apoptosis. 
Additionally, the neuroprotective effects of NXP031 were confirmed in a 
dose-dependent manner when administered to intrahippocampal Aβ-injected mice, as 
NXP031 attenuated memory decline, neuronal apoptosis, synaptic degeneration, and 
excessive glial activation, and reduced NOX-2 expression in the hippocampus. 
Taken together, NXP031 reduced the Aβ burden by regulating Aβ-degeneration and 
attenuated memory impairment, neuronal death, synaptic degeneration, and 
neuroinflammation induced by Aβ toxicity. These results suggest the potential of 
NXP031 as a therapeutic agent for AD.

Impaired cerebral waste clearance (i.e., glymphatics) is evident in aging and 
neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, where an impaired 
waste clearance system could be related to the accumulation of pathological 
proteins (e.g., tau). One marker of impaired cerebral clearance is the abundance 
of enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS). Preclinical studies propose a similar 
clearance system in the eye, driven by intraocular pressure (IOP). This 
cross-sectional pilot study explores the link between ocular and cerebral waste 
clearance by examining the association between MRI-visible PVS, tear fluid 
total-tau, and IOP. Thirty cognitively healthy participants, all aged over 
55 years, underwent 7 Tesla MRI, with PVS visually rated in the centrum 
semiovale (CSO) and basal ganglia. Tear fluid was collected using paper 
Schirmer's strips and analyzed for total-tau using enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay. IOP was measured using non-contact tonometry. Partial Spearman's 
correlation coefficients of eye and brain markers were calculated, adjusted for 
age, sex, tear fluid-wetting length, and hemispheric region of interest volume. 
Higher CSO PVS scores in the left and right hemisphere were associated with 
higher levels of tear fluid total-tau. Higher CSO PVS scores in both hemispheres 
were related to lower ipsilateral IOP. The exploratory results suggest that 
higher tear fluid total-tau and a reduced driving force of ocular waste 
clearance are connected to impaired cerebral waste clearance in cognitive 
healthy individuals. This study connects the potential ocular glymphatic system 
to the cerebral waste clearance system. Clarifying waste clearance biology and 
validating eye biomarkers for cerebral waste clearance could provide treatment 
targets and diagnostic opportunities for neurological diseases.

Neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, share 
key characteristics, notably cognitive impairment and significant cell death in 
specific brain regions. Cognition, a complex mental process allowing individuals 
to perceive time and place, is disrupted in these conditions. This consistent 
disruption suggests the possibility of a shared underlying mechanism across all 
neurodegenerative diseases. One potential common factor is the activation of 
pathways leading to cell death. Despite significant progress in understanding 
cell death pathways, no definitive treatments have emerged. This has shifted 
focus towards less-explored mechanisms like ferroptosis, which holds potential 
due to its involvement in oxidative stress and iron metabolism. Unlike apoptosis 
or necrosis, ferroptosis offers a novel therapeutic avenue due to its distinct 
biochemical and genetic underpinnings, making it a promising target in 
neurodegenerative disease treatment. Ferroptosis is distinguished from other 
cellular death mechanisms, by distinctive characteristics such as an imbalance 
of iron hemostasis, peroxidation of lipids in the plasma membrane, and 
dysregulated glutathione metabolism. In this review, we discuss the potential 
role of ferroptosis in cognitive impairment. We then summarize the evidence 
linking ferroptosis biomarkers to cognitive impairment brought on by 
neurodegeneration while highlighting recent advancements in our understanding of 
the molecular and genetic mechanisms behind the condition. Finally, we discuss 
the prospective therapeutic implications of targeting ferroptosis for the 
treatment of cognitive abnormalities associated with neurodegeneration, 
including natural and synthetic substances that suppress ferroptosis via a 
variety of mechanisms. Promising therapeutic candidates, including antioxidants 
and iron chelators, are being explored to inhibit ferroptosis and mitigate 
cognitive decline.

OBJECTIVES: There is a lack of studies on the rate and temporal changes of 
infections in relation to Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. We studied the 
infection rate in persons with and without AD yearly 5 years before and after AD 
diagnosis.
DESIGN: Register-based cohort study.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We used the Medication Use and Alzheimer's Disease 
cohort with 70,718 Finnish community dwellers diagnosed with AD between 2005 and 
2011 and an equal number of age, sex- and region-of-residence-matched comparison 
persons.
METHODS: Data on comorbidities, medication use, and hospital days due to 
infection were retrieved from multiple nationwide registers. The rate of 
hospitalization and accrued hospital days due to infections were calculated 
yearly during the follow-up. The accumulation of hospital days was investigated 
with the negative binomial model.
RESULTS: During the follow-up, one-half of persons with AD had inpatient stays 
due to infections compared with 34% of persons without AD. The infection rate 
increased substantially 1 to 2 years before AD diagnosis. At AD diagnosis, the 
rate of inpatient stays and outpatient visits due to infection was higher (15 
per 100 person-years) in persons with AD than in comparison persons (9 per 100 
person-years), and the accumulation of hospital days in persons with AD was 
higher a year after the diagnosis (incidence rate ratio, 1.21; 95% CI, 
1.11-1.32) due to higher infection rate. The most common infection diagnoses in 
both groups were pneumonia and genitourinary infections.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Compared with matched comparison persons, the 
higher hospitalization rate due to infections could be caused by systemic 
inflammation related to AD, infections generally treated in outpatient care, 
delirium symptoms associated with infections, and caregiver burden. The 
prevention of infections should be part of the care of cognitive disorders 
throughout the disease.

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether the risk of nursing home-to-nursing home 
transfer is higher among long-term nursing home residents with intellectual and 
developmental disabilities (IDD), or serious mental illness (SMI), and/or 
Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), relative to residents without 
these clinical diagnoses, and to assess the factors associated with transfer 
overall and for residents with these diagnoses.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional cohort study of nursing home residents in 2019.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Michigan long-term nursing home residents identified 
from the Minimum Data Set.
METHODS: Residents who had a nursing home-to-nursing home transfer were 
allocated into 5 groups: IDD, SMI and ADRD, ADRD, SMI, and all others. We 
examined transfer rates for each group. We assessed the odds of transfer for 
each group, adjusting for resident and nursing home characteristics, and 
behavioral issue and clinical indicators. We used stratified logistic regression 
to determine factors associated with transfers within each group.
RESULTS: Among 37,638 long-term nursing home residents, 2.3% had a nursing 
home-to-nursing home transfer. Transfers varied across diagnosis groups: 1.9% in 
IDD, 2.8% in SMI and ADRD, 1.9% in ADRD, 2.6% in SMI, and 2.5% in all others. 
After adjustment, residents in the SMI and ADRD group were 39% more likely to 
transfer than those in the all others group (adjusted odds ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 
1.14-1.68). Aged ≥75 years, moderate to severe cognitive impairment, and falls 
were associated with a lower odds of transfer. Being married and wandering were 
associated with a higher odds of transfer. Factors associated with transfers 
varied within each group.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Among Michigan long-term nursing home residents, 
residents with both SMI and ADRD are at the highest risk for transfer to another 
nursing home when compared with residents with SMI or ADRD alone and with IDD 
and none of these diagnoses. Understanding the drivers of transfer of this 
vulnerable group warrants further investigation.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease primarily 
characterized by cognitive impairments. With the intensification of population 
aging, AD has become a major health concern affecting the elderly. Kaixinsan, a 
classical traditional Chinese formula, consists of Ginseng Panax et Rhizoma, 
Polygalae Radix, Poria and Acori Tatarinowii Rhizoma, and is commonly used in 
clinical for treating memory decline. However, its mechanism remains unclear, 
which hinders its popularization and application.
METHOD: Morris water maze (MWM) was performed to evaluate the effect of 
Kaixinsan on improving learning and memory ability in SAMP8 
(senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8, an AD model mice) mice. Nissl staining, 
TdT-mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) and western blotting (Bax and Bcl-2) 
were used to confirm the effect of Kaixinsan on the neuronal structure and 
apoptosis of SAMP8 mice. Ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with 
quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS) was performed to 
identify the distribution components in brain tissue after administration of 
Kaixinsan extraction. Based on the identified brain distribution components, the 
mechanism of Kaixinsan improving the cognitive function was predicted by network 
pharmacology. Then, using HSP60 as a mitochondrial marker and RBFOX3 as a 
neuronal marker, immunofluorescence co-localization was used to confirm the 
effect of Kaixinsan on neuronal mitochondria quantity in SAMP8 mice. Western 
blotting was employed to access the expression of predicted proteins (AMPK, 
CaMKKβ, PGC-1α and HSP90) implicated in mitochondrial homeostasis. To further 
confirm the mechanism of Kaixinsan, SH-SY5Y cell injury model induced by amyloid 
β - protein fragment 25-35 (Aβ25-35) was replicated and the effect of Kaixinsan 
- containing serum on apoptosis in injured SH-SY5Y cells was investigated by 
flow cytometer. The expression level of apoptosis-associated proteins (Bax and 
Bcl-2) and mitochondrial homeostasis related proteins (AMPK, CaMKKβ, PGC-1α and 
HSP90) in the presence or absence of CaMKKβ inhibitor (STO-609) were compared.
RESULTS: The results indicate that Kaixinsan can improve the cognitive function 
of SAMP8 mice, alleviate the hippocampal tissue lesions and inhibit neuron 
apoptosis. Seventeen brain distribution components of Kaixinsan were identified. 
Based on the brain distribution components of Kaixinsan, the results of network 
pharmacology suggest that Kaixinsan may regulate mitochondrial homeostasis 
through the CaMKKβ-AMPK-PGC-1α signaling axis. In vivo experiments indicated 
that Kaixinsan could reverse neuronal mitochondrial loss in SAMP8 mice by 
upregulating CaMKKβ, AMPK, HSP90 and PGC-1α to promote mitochondrial biogenesis 
and increase the number of neuronal mitochondria. Additionally, the in vitro 
experiments demonstrated that Kaixinsan can inhibit apoptosis of Aβ25-35 injured 
SH-SY5Y cells and upregulate mitochondrial homeostasis-related proteins CaMKKβ, 
AMPK and PGC-1α. However, in addition to CaMKKβ inhibitors, the neuroprotective 
effect disappeared.
CONCLUSION: The results indicate that Kaixinsan can improve the cognitive 
function of SAMP8 mice by regulating CaMKKβ-AMPK-PGC-1α signaling axis to 
maintain mitochondrial homeostasis and inhibit neuronal apoptosis.

(1) Background: Lippia sidoides Cham is a Brazilian aromatic plant rich in 
phenolic compounds. In traditional medicine, its leaves are used to treat 
diseases of the Central Nervous System such as stress and anxiety. This study 
evaluates the capacity of the aqueous extract of L. sidoides as an 
anticonvulsant, anticholinesterase and antihemolytic agent. (2) Methods: The 
extract was obtained from the leaves using water as a solvent, then dried in a 
spray dryer. The anticonvulsant effect was evaluated in zebrafish models using 
the pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) method. The anticholinesterase effect was determined 
using the acetylcholinesterase enzyme and physostigmine as a positive control. 
The antihemolytic action was evaluated by exposing erythrocytes to different 
concentrations of NaCl in the presence and absence of the extract. (3) Results: 
The anticonvulsant effect was observed at a concentration of 400 mg/kg, delaying 
convulsive crises. In the anticholinesterase assay, a dose-dependent action and 
variation in the effect over time were observed, demonstrating a reversible 
effect of the extract. For the osmotic fragility test, the extract showed 
satisfactory results, providing cellular protection across all variations of 
NaCl concentration. (4) Conclusions: These results demonstrate the promising 
potential of L. sidoides extract for the development of drugs that act in the 
treatment of diseases that affect the Central Nervous System.

The most prevalent chronic neurodegenerative illness in the world is Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). It results in mental symptoms including behavioral abnormalities 
and cognitive impairment, which have a substantial financial and psychological 
impact on the relatives of the patients. The review discusses various 
pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to AD, including amyloid beta, tau 
protein, inflammation, and other factors, while emphasizing the need for 
effective disease-modifying therapeutics that alter disease progression rather 
than merely alleviating symptoms. This review mainly covers medications that are 
now being studied in clinical trials or recently approved by the FDA that fall 
under the disease-modifying treatment (DMT) category, which alters the 
progression of the disease by targeting underlying biological mechanisms rather 
than merely alleviating symptoms. DMTs focus on improving patient outcomes by 
slowing cognitive decline, enhancing neuroprotection, and supporting 
neurogenesis. Additionally, the review covers amyloid-targeting therapies, 
tau-targeting therapies, neuroprotective therapies, and others. This evaluation 
specifically looked at studies on FDA-approved novel DMTs in Phase II or III 
development that were carried out between 2021 and 2024. A thorough review of 
the US government database identified clinical trials of biologics and small 
molecule drugs for 14 agents in Phase I, 34 in Phase II, and 11 in Phase III 
that might be completed by 2028.

The deposition of amyloid β-protein (Aβ) in the brain is the main pathogenesis 
of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The development of potent inhibitors against Aβ 
aggregation is one of the effective strategies to combat AD. Endogenous 
transthyretin (TTR) can inhibit Aβ fibrillization via hydrophobic interactions, 
but its weak inhibitory potency hinders its application in AD therapy. Here, 
different recombinant TTRs were designed by cationic surface charge engineering. 
Compared with TTR, all positively charged recombinant TTRs showed enhanced 
capability in inhibiting Aβ aggregation, especially the recombinant protein 
obtained by mutating the acidic amino acid in TTR to arginine (TTR-nR) exhibited 
excellent inhibitory effect. Among them, TTR-7R remarkably increased the 
inhibitory potency against Aβ, which could effectively inhibit Aβ40 
fibrillization at a very low concentration (0.5 μM). In addition, TTR-7R 
increased cultured cell viability from 62% to 89%, scavenged amyloid plaques in 
AD nematodes, and prolonged nematode lifespan by 5 d at 2 μM. Thermodynamic 
studies demonstrated that TTR-7R, enriching in positive charges, presented 
hydrophobic interactions and enhanced electrostatic interactions with Aβ40, 
leading to a significantly enhanced inhibitory capacity of TTR-7R. The research 
provided insights into the development of efficient recombinant protein 
inhibitors for AD treatment.

Background: Neuronal excitotoxicity and metabolic decline, which begin in the 
early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD), pose challenges for effective 
amelioration. Our previous work suggested that the natural compound xanthohumol, 
the most abundant prenylated flavonoid in hops, prevents memory deficits in 
APP/PS1 mice; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Methods: This 
study utilized APP/PS1 mice and cutting-edge omics techniques to investigate the 
effects of xanthohumol on hippocampal proteome, serum metabolome, and 
microbiome. Results: Our findings revealed that xanthohumol reduces the 
postsynaptic overexpression of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic 
acid, N-methyl-D-aspartate, and metabotropic glutamate receptors, but enhances 
ATP synthesis and mitophagy in the young AD hippocampus. Further mechanistic 
analyses suggested systemic regulatory effects, particularly on the decreasing 
glutamate synthesis in the blood and intestines of AD mice following xanthohumol 
administration. Conclusions: These results underscore the potential of 
xanthohumol in mitigating AD pathology through multifaceted mechanisms, sparking 
interest and curiosity in its preventive and therapeutic potential in AD.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Schisandra chinensis Fructus (SCF) is a traditional 
medicinal herb containing lignans that improves glucose metabolism by mitigating 
insulin resistance. We aimed to investigate the therapeutic potential and action 
mechanism of SCF for Alzheimer's disease (AD) using a network pharmacology 
analysis, followed by experimental validation in an AD rat model.
METHODS: The biological activities of SCF's bioactive compounds were assessed 
through a network pharmacology analysis. An AD rat model was generated by 
infusing amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) (25-35) into the hippocampus to induce Aβ 
accumulation. The AD rats were fed either 0.5% dextrin (AD-Con) or 0.5% SCF 
(AD-SCF group) in a high-fat diet for seven weeks. The rats in the 
normal/control group received an Aβ (35-25) infusion (no Aβ deposition) and were 
fed a control diet (Normal-C). Aβ deposition, memory function, inflammation, and 
glucose/lipid metabolism were evaluated.
RESULTS: The network analysis revealed significant intersections between 
AD-related targets and bioactive SCF compounds, like gomisin A, schisandrin, and 
longikaurin A. Key AD genes prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase-2 (PTGS2, 
cyclooxygenase-2) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) were linked to SCF compounds. 
In the rats with AD induced by bilaterally infusing amyloid-β (25-35) into the 
hippocampus, the 0.5% SCF intake mitigated hippocampal amyloid-β deposition, 
neuroinflammation, memory deficits, and dysregulated glucose and lipid 
metabolism versus the AD controls. SCF reduced hippocampal AChE activity, 
inflammatory cytokine expression related to PTGS2, and malondialdehyde contents 
and preserved neuronal cell survival-related factors such as brain-derived 
neurotrophic factor and ciliary neurotrophic factor similar to normal rats. The 
neuroprotective effects validated the network analysis findings.
CONCLUSIONS: SCF could be a potential AD therapeutic agent by activating the 
parasympathetic nervous system to reduce hippocampal oxidative stress and 
inflammation, warranting further clinical investigations of its efficacy.

Functional Foods in Preventing Human Blood Platelet Hyperactivity-Mediated 
Diseases-An Updated Review.

Duttaroy AK(1).

Medicine, University of Oslo, 0313 Oslo, Norway.

Backgrounds/Objectives: Abnormal platelet functions are associated with human 
morbidity and mortality. Platelets have emerged as critical regulators of 
numerous physiological and pathological processes beyond their established roles 
in hemostasis and thrombosis. Maintaining physiological platelet function is 
essential to hemostasis and preventing platelet-associated diseases such as 
cardiovascular disease, cancer metastasis, immune disorders, hypertension, 
diabetes, sickle cell disease, inflammatory bowel disease, sepsis, rheumatoid 
arthritis, myeloproliferative disease, and Alzheimer's disease. Platelets become 
hyperactive in obesity, diabetes, a sedentary lifestyle, hypertension, 
pollution, and smokers. Platelets, upon activation, can trawl leukocytes and 
progenitor cells to the vascular sites. Platelets release various 
proinflammatory, anti-inflammatory, and angiogenic factors and shed 
microparticles in the circulation, thus promoting pathological reactions. These 
platelet-released factors also maintain sustained activation, further impacting 
these disease processes. Although the mechanisms are unknown, multiple stimuli 
induce platelet hyperreactivity but involve the early pathways of platelet 
activation. The exact mechanisms of how hyperactive platelets contribute to 
these diseases are still unclear, and antiplatelet strategies are inevitable for 
preventing these diseases. Reducing platelet function during the early stages 
could significantly impact these diseases. However, while this is potentially a 
worthwhile intervention, using antiplatelet drugs to limit platelet function in 
apparently healthy individuals without cardiovascular disease is not recommended 
due to the increased risk of internal bleeding, resistance, and other side 
effects. The challenge for therapeutic intervention in these diseases is 
identifying factors that preferentially block specific targets involved in 
platelets' complex contribution to these diseases while leaving their hemostatic 
function at least partially intact. Since antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin are 
not recommended as primary preventives, it is essential to use alternative safe 
platelet inhibitors without side effects.
METHODS: A systematic search of the PUBMED database from 2000 to 2023 was 
conducted using the selected keywords: "functional foods", "polyphenols", "fatty 
acids", "herbs", fruits and vegetables", "cardioprotective agents", "plant", 
"platelet aggregation", "platelet activation", "clinical and non-clinical 
trial", "randomized", and "controlled".
RESULTS: Potent natural antiplatelet factors have been described, including 
omega-3 fatty acids, polyphenols, and other phytochemicals. Antiplatelet 
bioactive compounds in food that can prevent platelet hyperactivity and thus may 
prevent several platelet-mediated diseases, including cardiovascular disease.
CONCLUSIONS: This narrative review describes the work during 2000-2023 in 
developing functional foods from natural sources with antiplatelet effects.

BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress and chronic inflammation, at both the systemic and 
the central level, are critical early events in atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's 
disease (AD).
PURPOSE: To investigate the oxidative stress-, inflammation-, and 
Tau-phosphorylation-lowering effects of pomegranate polyphenols (PPs) 
(punicalagin, ellagic acid, peel, and aril extracts).
METHODS: We used flow cytometry to quantify the protein expression of 
proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β) and anti-inflammatory mediators (IL-10) in 
THP-1 macrophages, as well as M1/M2 cell-specific marker (CD86 and CD163) 
expression in human microglia HMC3 cells. The IL-10 protein expression was also 
quantified in U373-MG human astrocytes. The effect of PPs on human amyloid beta 
1-42 (Aβ1-42)-induced oxidative stress was assessed in the microglia by 
measuring ROS generation and lipid peroxidation, using 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein 
diacetate (DCFH-DA) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) tests, 
respectively. Neuronal viability and cell apoptotic response to Aβ1-42 toxicity 
were assayed using the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium 
bromide) assay and the annexin-V-FITC apoptosis detection kit, respectively. 
Finally, flow cytometry analysis was also performed to evaluate the ability of 
PPs to modulate Aβ1-42-induced Tau-181 phosphorylation (pTau-181).
RESULTS: Our data indicate that PPs are significantly (p < 0.05) effective in 
countering Aβ1-42-induced inflammation through increasing the anti-inflammatory 
cytokines (IL-10) in U373-MG astrocytes and THP1 macrophages and decreasing 
proinflammatory marker (IL-1β) expression in THP1 macrophages. The PPs were also 
significantly (p < 0.05) effective in inducing the phenotypic transition of 
THP-1 macrophages and microglial cells from M1 to M2 by decreasing CD86 and 
increasing CD163 surface receptor expression. Moreover, our treatments have a 
significant (p < 0.05) beneficial impact on oxidative stress, illustrated in the 
reduction in TBARS and ROS generation. Our treatments have significant (p < 
0.05) cell viability improvement capacities and anti-apoptotic effects on human 
H4 neurons. Furthermore, our results suggest that Aβ1-42 significantly (p < 
0.05) increases pTau-181. This effect is significantly (p < 0.05) attenuated by 
arils, peels, and punicalagin and drastically reduced by the ellagic acid 
treatment.
CONCLUSION: Overall, our results attribute to PPs anti-inflammatory, 
antioxidant, anti-apoptotic, and anti-Tau-pathology potential. Future studies 
should aim to extend our knowledge of the potential role of PPs in 
Aβ1-42-induced neurodegeneration, particularly concerning its association with 
the tauopathy involved in AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a challenging medical issue that requires 
efficacious treatment options to improve long-term quality of life. Cannabidiol 
(CBD) is a cannabis-derived phytocannabinoid with potential health benefits, 
including reports from our laboratory and others showing a therapeutic role in 
the pre-clinical treatment of AD; however, the mechanisms whereby CBD affects AD 
progression remain undefined. Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are recently 
discovered immune cells that initiate and orchestrate inflammatory responses. 
ILC2, a sub-class of ILCs, is proposed to have a role in cognitive function via 
unknown mechanisms. In this present study, we explored whether CBD ameliorates 
AD symptoms via the enhancement of acetylcholine (ACh), a cholinergic 
neurotransmitter involved in cognition that may regulate ILC2. 5xFAD mice were 
chronically treated by inhalation of a formulation of broad-spectrum CBD for 
seven months. ACh production, ILC2s profile, brain histopathology, and long-term 
behavior were assessed. Together, our studies showed that long-term inhalation 
of CBD improved cognitive function and reduced senile plaques in a murine AD 
model, effects that were associated with enhanced ACh production and altered 
ILC2s distribution within the CNS. These findings indicate that inhaled CBD 
could offer a cost-effective, non-invasive, and effective treatment for managing 
AD. The beneficial effects of CBD inhalation may be linked to increased ACh 
production and an altered distribution of ILC2s, highlighting the need for 
further research in this area.
