BackgroundPeople living with dementia (PLWD) are vulnerable to serious COVID-19 
illness and death but the contribution of various factors including long-term 
care (LTC), pandemic wave, hospitalization, comorbidities, and underlying 
neurological health remains unclear.ObjectiveTo investigate the relative risk of 
SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization, and mortality (COVID-19 and non-COVID-19) 
in PLWD compared to those without dementia, by living circumstance and pandemic 
wave, while controlling for additional risk factors.MethodsA cohort of people 65 
and up with dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, was propensity score 
matched to a control cohort using linked population-level health records. 
Relative risk of outcomes was estimated using adjusted Cox proportional hazards 
modelling. The modifying effects of LTC residence and pandemic wave on all 
outcomes, and of COVID-19-related hospitalization on COVID-19 mortality were 
investigated.ResultsCompared to controls without dementia, PLWD had higher risk 
of infection and COVID-19 mortality whether they lived in LTC or not. For PLWD 
in LTC, relative risk was often reduced or not significantly different when 
stratified by wave but remained higher for PLWD not in LTC (32-93%). In LTC, 
likelihood of hospitalization was 53-64% lower for PLWD compared to those 
without dementia. PLWD not hospitalized for COVID-19 had higher COVID-19 
mortality than non-hospitalized, non-dementia controls both in and not in LTC 
(32% and 477%, respectively).ConclusionsPLWD repeatedly had higher risk of 
COVID-19 infection and mortality, but risk varied with changing pandemic 
circumstances and living environment. Higher mortality may have been associated 
with reduced hospital transfers, complex care needs and neurological health.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is not a single-cause disease; rather, it is a complex 
neurodegenerative disease involving multiple pathological pathways influenced by 
various risk factors. Aggregation and accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau 
are the most prominent features in the brains of AD patients. Aggregated Aβ and 
tau exert neurotoxic effects in the central nervous system, contributing to the 
pathogenesis and progression of AD. They also act synergistically to cause 
neurodegeneration, resulting in memory loss. In this context, dual inhibition of 
Aβ and tau aggregation, or dissociation of these two aggregates, is considered 
promising for AD treatment. Recently, dual inhibitors capable of simultaneously 
targeting the aggregation and dissociation of both Aβ and tau have been 
investigated. Specific amino acid domains of Aβ and tau associated with their 
aggregation/dissociation have been identified. Subsequently, therapeutic agents 
that prevent aggregation or promote disaggregation by targeting these domains 
have been identified/developed. In this review, we summarize the major domains 
and properties involved in Aβ and tau aggregation, as well as the therapeutic 
effects and mechanisms of agents that simultaneously regulate their aggregation 
and dissociation. This comprehensive review may contribute to the design and 
discovery of next-generation dual-targeting drugs for Aβ and tau, potentially 
leading to the development of more effective therapeutic strategies for AD.

The presence of hyperphosphorylated Tau proteins, which mislocalize and form 
neurofibrillary tangles, and the accumulation of amyloid-β plaques are hallmark 
features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). These toxic protein aggregates contribute 
to synaptic impairment and neuronal dysfunction, underscoring the need for 
strategies aimed at effectively clearing or reducing these aggregates in the 
treatment of AD. In recent years, proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) 
technology has emerged as a promising approach for selectively degrading 
dysfunctional proteins rather than merely inhibiting their function. This 
approach holds great potential for developing more effective interventions that 
could slow AD progression and improve patient outcomes. In this review, we first 
examine the pathological mechanisms underlying AD, focusing on abnormal protein 
degradation and accumulation. We then explore the evolution of PROTAC 
technology, its mechanisms of action, and the current status of drug 
development. Finally, we discuss the latest findings regarding the application 
of PROTACs in AD therapy, highlighting the potential benefits and limitations of 
this technology. Although promising, further clinical research is necessary to 
fully assess the safety and efficacy of PROTAC-based therapies for AD treatment.

Neuronal hyperexcitation affects memory and neural processing across the 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) cognitive continuum. Levetiracetam, an antiepileptic, 
shows promise in improving cognitive impairment by restoring the neural 
excitation/inhibition balance in AD patients. We previously identified a 
hyper-excitable phenotype in cognitively unimpaired female APOE-ε4 carriers 
relative to male counterparts cross-sectionally. This sex difference lacks 
longitudinal validation; however, clarifying the vulnerability of female 
ε4-carriers could better inform antiepileptic treatment efficacy. Here, we 
investigated this sex-by-ε4 interaction using a longitudinal design. We used 
resting-state fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging collected longitudinally from 
106 participants who were cognitively unimpaired for at least one scan event but 
may have been assessed to have clinical dementia ratings corresponding to early 
mild cognitive impairment over time. By including scan events where participants 
transitioned to mild cognitive impairment, we modeled the trajectory of the 
whole-brain excitation-inhibition ratio throughout the preclinical cognitively 
healthy continuum and extended to early impairment. A linear mixed model 
revealed a significant three-way interaction among sex, ε4-status, and time, 
with female ε4-carriers showing a significant hyper-excitable trajectory. These 
findings suggest a possible pathway for preventative therapy targeting 
preclinical hyperexcitation in female ε4-carriers.

Citalopram is effective in treating agitation in Alzheimer's dementia (AD), but 
it is associated with cognitive and cardiac risks, likely due to its 
R-enantiomer. Escitalopram, the S-enantiomer, may be an alternative. In this 
double-masked randomized (1:1) placebo-controlled trial, we assessed the 
efficacy and safety of escitalopram in treating agitation in AD after failure of 
a psychosocial intervention (PSI). Assessments occurred at enrollment, post-PSI 
(baseline) and at 3, 6, 9 and 12 weeks post-baseline. Settings were 27 
community-based centers. The target randomization sample was 392 participants. 
Participants were adults with AD, a Mini-Mental State Examination Telephone 
score of 3-20 and significant agitation. PSI non-responders received 
escitalopram (up to 15 mg per day) or placebo for 12 weeks while continuing PSI. 
The outcome was the proportion of participants with clinically significant 
improvement in agitation from baseline at 12 weeks. In total, 173 participants 
were randomized (84 escitalopram versus 89 placebo; mean ± s.d. 
age = 78.4 ± 8.7 years; 90 men (52.0%); 127 White (73.4%)). The unadjusted risk 
difference at 12 weeks was 0.08 (95% confidence interval: -0.21, 0.06). 
Drug-related QT interval prolongation was observed. Although the randomized 
sample was smaller than planned, escitalopram was not effective in treating 
agitation in AD and was associated with cardiac conduction delays. Clinicians 
need to be cautious in recommending escitalopram as an alternative to citalopram 
for this condition. ClincialTrials.gov identifier: NCT03108846 .

additional unrelated cases using genetic data from over 50,000 individuals. 
Carriers with available genotyping data shared a common haplotype. The clinical 
presentation resembles other LRRK2-PD forms. Combined with published functional 
evidence showing strongly enhanced LRRK2 kinase activity, we provide evidence 
that LRRK2 p.L1795F is pathogenic.

The amyloid hypothesis has been a leading narrative concerning the 
pathophysiological foundation of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. At the two 
ends of the hypothesis lie the functional protein monomers and the 
pathology-defining amyloid fibrils, while the early stages of protein 
aggregation are populated by polymorphic, transient and neurotoxic oligomers. As 
the structure and activity of oligomers are intertwined, here we show oligomers 
arising from liquid-liquid phase separation and β-barrel formation, their routes 
to neurodegeneration, and their role in cerebrovascular perturbation. Together, 
this Perspective converges on the multifaceted oligomer-axis central to the 
pathological origin and, hence, the treatment of amyloid diseases.

INTRODUCTION: Disturbances in microvascular flow dynamics are hypothesized to 
precede the symptomatic phase of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, evidence in 
presymptomatic AD remains elusive, underscoring the need for therapies targeting 
these early vascular changes.
METHODS: We employed a multimodal approach, combining in vivo optical imaging, 
molecular techniques, and ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging, to investigate 
early capillary dysfunction in C57BL/6-Tg(Thy1-APPSwDutIowa)BWevn/Mmjax 
(Tg-SwDI) mice without memory impairment. We also assessed the efficacy of 
carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAIs) in preventing capillary flow disturbances.
RESULTS: Our study revealed capillary flow disturbances associated with 
alterations in capillary morphology, adhesion molecule expression, and amyloid 
beta (Aβ) load in 9- to 10-month-old Tg-SwDI mice without memory impairment. CAI 
treatment ameliorated these capillary flow disturbances, enhanced oxygen 
availability, and reduced Aβ load.
DISCUSSION: These findings underscore the importance of capillary flow 
disturbances as early biomarkers in presymptomatic AD and highlight the 
potential of CAIs for preserving vascular integrity in the early stages of AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: Uncovered early capillary dysfunction in a presymptomatic 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model. Evidence linking capillary stalls and 
capillary dysfunction with oxygen delivery issues in AD. Novel use of carbonic 
anhydrase inhibitors to prevent early capillary flow disturbances in AD.

Nicotine, the principal alkaloid in tobacco, exhibits significant central 
nervous system activity and induces a wide array of physiological effects. In 
addition to its well-documented role in tobacco dependence, previous studies 
have suggested that nicotine also has diverse pharmacological properties. These 
include alleviating symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease, potentially 
reducing the risk of Alzheimer's disease, mitigating oxidative stress, as well 
as anti-inflammatory and anxiolytic effects. Neuroscientists frequently use an 
array of molecular biology techniques to elucidate the mechanisms responsible 
for the effects of nicotine on the central nervous system. However, disease 
onset is invariably accompanied by metabolic dysfunction, and organisms often 
exhibit complex and unpredictable responses to pharmacological stimuli. As a 
bioactive alkaloid with potent pharmacological properties, nicotine is able to 
cross the blood-brain barrier and induce brain-compound changes, which serves as 
the basis for its effects on the central nervous system. Consequently, examining 
the extensive impact of nicotine exposure on endogenous metabolites and 
metabolic pathways in the brain is an indispensable step toward providing a more 
robust foundation for understanding the complex physiological effects of 
nicotine. In this study, an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem 
mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) metabolomic-analysis method was established to 
systematically examine the effects of repeated nicotine exposure on endogenous 
metabolites in mouse brains. Two chromatographic systems fitted with Acquity 
UPLC BEH HILIC (150 mm×2.1 mm, 1.7 μm) and BEH C18 (150 mm×2.1 mm, 1.7 μm) 
columns were used to determine the nicotine present in samples. As a result, the 
established UHPLC-MS/MS method identified a total of 759 endogenous metabolites. 
Compared with the saline group, nicotine exposure resulted in 575 significantly 
different metabolites, with 434 metabolites down-regulated and 141 up-regulated. 
Further pathway-enrichment analysis using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and 
Genomes (KEGG) revealed that nicotine exposure primarily affects 
essential-amino-acid, lipid, nucleotide, carbohydrate, cofactor, and vitamin 
metabolism, as well as other amino-acid metabolic pathways in the brain. 
Although non-targeted metabolomics can simultaneously detect and analyze all 
small-molecule metabolites in an unbiased manner, accurately capturing 
metabolite changes in specific brain regions is challenging when dealing with 
complex brain-tissue systems. Targeting the aggregation of material bases and 
the delivery of precision treatment to certain brain regions is expected to be 
significant for the targeted therapy of central nervous system diseases. 
Airflow-assisted desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging 
(AFADESI-MSI) was further used to directly visualize the nicotine-induced 
distributions and variations of differentially expressed metabolites in various 
brain regions, which revealed that nicotine exposure leads to the significant 
downregulation of choline, serine, aspartate, and malate levels throughout the 
brain. Specifically, taurine, acetylcholine, and adenosine levels were notably 
affected in the cortical, hippocampal, and striatal regions, respectively. 
Essential-amino-acid metabolism was most affected by nicotine, with lipid 
metabolism found to be the next-most affected pathway. These metabolic pathways 
predominantly affected the cortical region, whereas the striatum, hippocampus, 
thalamus, and cerebellum were affected to varying degrees. These findings 
provide novel experimental evidence that enhances our understanding of metabolic 
biomarkers associated with nicotine exposure.

烟碱具有明显的神经药理学活性,对多种中枢神经系统疾病具有干预作用,然而烟碱入脑后对脑区内源性代谢物的影响尚不清楚。研究烟碱暴露后对小鼠脑内内源性代谢物的影响,可为阐明烟碱的多重生理学效应提供更加全面的物质基础。本文基于超高效液相色谱-串联质谱(UHPLC-MS/MS)及代谢组学分析方法,系统考察了烟碱多次暴露后对小鼠脑内内源性代谢产物的影响,并进一步采用质谱成像法,直观获取烟碱引发的差异性代谢物在不同脑区的分布及变化差异。实验结果如下:本研究共鉴定到759种代谢物,烟碱暴露后共筛选到575个显著差异性代谢物,其中434个代谢物下调,141个代谢物上调;通过京都基因和基因组数据库(Kyoto 
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, 
KEGG)通路富集分析表明烟碱暴露后主要影响到脑内必需氨基酸代谢、脂质代谢、核苷酸代谢、碳水化合物代谢、辅因子和维生素代谢以及其他氨基酸代谢通路;进一步通过质谱成像法分析差异性代谢物在脑内的分布特征,结果表明烟碱暴露后全脑范围内胆碱、丝氨酸、天冬氨酸及苹果酸含量都被显著下调,皮层区域牛磺酸、海马区域乙酰基肉碱以及纹状体区域的腺苷类物质均被显著影响。这些结果为进一步揭示烟碱暴露对中枢神经系统的影响提供了新的实验依据。

Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) is the greatest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's 
(AD) and is linked to whole-body metabolic dysfunction. However, it is unclear 
how APOE4 interacts with modifiable factors like diet to impact tissues central 
to regulating whole-body metabolism. We examined APOE4- and Western diet-driven 
effects in skeletal muscle using APOE3 (control) and APOE4 targeted replacement 
mice on a C57BL/6NTac background fed a high-fat diet (HFD, 45% kcal fat) or 
low-fat diet (LFD, 10% kcal fat) for 4 months (n = 7-8 per genotype/diet/sex 
combination). We assessed body composition and whole-body outcomes linked to 
skeletal muscle function including respiratory exchange ratio (RER) and resting 
energy expenditure (REE). In skeletal muscle, we evaluated the proteome and 
mitochondrial respiration. In males only, APOE4 drove greater gains in fat mass 
and lower gains in lean mass on both diets. APOE4 did not affect daily RER but 
was associated with elevated REE in males and lower REE in HFD females after 
covarying for body composition. Skeletal muscle proteomics showed APOE4 exerts 
several diet- and sex-specific effects on mitochondrial pathways, including 
elevations in branched-chain amino catabolism in HFD males and reductions in 
oxidative phosphorylation in LFD females. This did not translate to differences 
in skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration, suggesting that compensatory 
mechanisms may sustain mitochondrial function at this age. Our work indicates 
that genetic risk may mediate early life effects on skeletal muscle mitochondria 
and energy expenditure that are partially dependent on diet. This has important 
implications for mitigating ad risk in APOE4 carriers.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex disease with unknown etiology and 
pathogenesis. We described a combined analysis of murine proteomics and 
microbiomics to find potential therapeutic targets of different doses of 
xanthohumol (Xn), with the goal of providing a biological basis for the 
treatment of early AD. Xn improved the spatial learning and memory ability of 
APP/PS1 mice; this was associated with an increased number of newborn neurons in 
the subgranular zone (SGZ) and dentate gyrus (DG) and a decreased inflammatory 
response. 108 proteins were significantly changed after 0.5 mg/kg Xn treatment 
while only 72 proteins changed by 5 mg/kg Xn. Eight significant microbiota were 
modulated by different doses of Xn at line discriminant analysis (LDA) score 
3.0, but only three of which were regulated by 0.5 mg/kg Xn at LDA score 4.0. In 
addition, Xn treatment could significantly regulate the pathways of 
neurodegeneration- multiple diseases in the hippocampus and the penicillin and 
cephalosporin biosynthesis and atrazine degradation pathways in the gut. 
Interestingly, Nefl protein validated by correlation analysis was found in the 
common signaling pathway. 0.5 mg/kg Xn was able to reverse the correlation 
between hippocampal proteins and gut microbiota. Xn treatment significantly 
improved cognitive function in AD transgenic mice. Different doses of Xn caused 
significant differences in protein expression and flora composition and 
abundance, suggesting that the doses of Xn should be selected with caution, and 
low dose may be better in the prevention of AD.

Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative condition that is the 
most frequent reason for dementia. Due to the increasing trend of aging in 
societies, it will place a large social and financial burden on society. 
Although beta amyloid plaques and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles are 
mentioned as the main events in this disorder, the exact molecular pathology and 
inflammatory regulatory networks involved in neuroinflammatory events, as a 
fundamental pathogenic mechanism remain unknown. Understanding these molecular 
network pathways in addition to helping to understand the pathogenesis of 
Alzheimer's disease, can also help in the early diagnosis as well as the control 
of inflammatory processes that are involved in its progression. So, in this 
study, we intend to have an overview on the regulatory lncRNAs of Alzheimer's 
disease and their related miRNA and mRNAs, as well as the relationship of these 
regulatory pathways with inflammatory processes, so that we can provide a 
perspective for future studies in the field of diagnosis and possibly treatment 
of this disorder.

Stress granules (SGs) are membrane-less cytoplasmic structures formed by cells 
in response to external stress, primarily composed of mRNA and proteins. The 
dynamic properties of their assembly, maintenance, and disassembly play crucial 
roles in cellular homeostasis. Recent studies have increasingly revealed that 
aberrations in SGs dynamics are closely related to the pathogenesis of various 
neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, 
and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This review summarizes the latest research 
progress on SGs dynamics in neurodegenerative diseases. It begins with an 
overview of the basic biological characteristics of SGs and their functions in 
neurons, followed by an in-depth exploration of the mechanisms and regulatory 
pathways of SGs dynamics. The review then summarizes potential therapeutic 
strategies targeting SGs dynamics abnormalities, particularly through small 
molecule drugs to modulate SGs formation and disassembly, aiming to delay or 
halt the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. The review also highlights 
the application prospects of these interventions in treating neurodegenerative 
diseases. Finally, the review introduces current techniques used to study SGs 
dynamics, discussing their advantages, limitations, and future development 
possibilities. This review aims to provide researchers with a comprehensive 
perspective to advance the understanding and clinical application of SGs 
dynamics in the field of neurodegenerative diseases.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease - an age-related neurodegenerative disorder 
leading to progressive cognitive impairment - is characterized by an 
intracerebral accumulation of soluble β-amyloid (Aβ) oligomers, followed by the 
appearance of abnormally ubiquitinylated neurofibrillary tangles - a process 
associated with a chronic inflammation. The systematic presence of 
ubiquitinylated inclusions reflects a decrease in the proteasome activity due to 
(and contributing to) the presence of Aβ oligomers - a central dysfunction in 
the etiology of the disease.
SUMMARY: The involvement of the ubiquitin-proteasome system opens new 
therapeutic perspectives for both prevention and treatment. In particular, the 
potential for synergistic strategies combining diet-derived proteasome 
activators, immunoproteasome inhibitors, and modulators of Aβ peptide 
aggregation to prevent, delay or even reverse disease progression over time is 
currently arousing growing interest.
KEY MESSAGES: From that perspective, and in light of the recent advances in the 
understanding of the key molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying 
Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, the present review highlights the mechanisms 
of action and the preventive and therapeutic potential of some diet-derived 
bioactive compounds and other natural substances of interest. This article is a

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Among the participants of Alzheimer disease (AD) 
treatment trials, 40% do not show cognitive decline over 80 weeks of follow-up. 
Identifying and excluding these individuals can increase power to detect 
treatment effects. We aimed to develop machine learning-based predictive models 
to identify persons unlikely to show decline on placebo treatment over 80 weeks.
METHODS: We used the data from the placebo arm of EXPEDITION3 AD clinical trial 
and a subpopulation from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). 
Participants in the EXPEDITION3 trial were patients with mild dementia and 
biomarker evidence of amyloid burden. For this study, participants were 
identified as those who demonstrated clinically meaningful cognitive decline 
(CMCD) or cognitively stable (CS) at final visit of the trial (week 80). Machine 
learning-based classifiers were trained to classify participants into CMCD vs CS 
groups using combinations of demographics, APOE genotype, neuropsychological 
tests, and biomarkers (volumetric MRI). The results were developed in 70% of the 
EXPEDITION3 placebo sample using 5-fold cross-validation. Trained models were 
then used to classify the participants in an internal validation sample and an 
external matched sample ADNIAD.
RESULTS: Eight hundred ninety-four of the 1,072 participants in the placebo arm 
of the EXPEDITION3 trial had necessary follow-up data, who were on average aged 
72.7 (±7.7) years and 59% female. 55.8% of those participants showed CMCD (∼2 
years younger than those without) at the final visit. In the independent 
validation sample within the EXPEDITION3 data, all the models showed high 
sensitivity and modest specificity. Positive predictive values (PPVs) of models 
were at least 11% higher than base prevalence of CMCD observed at the end of the 
trial. The subset of matched ADNI participants (ADNIAD, N = 105) were aged 74.5 
(±6.4) years and 46% female. The models that were validated in ADNIAD also 
showed high sensitivity, modest specificity, and PPVs of at least 15% higher 
than the base prevalence in ADNIAD.
DISCUSSION: Our results indicate that predictive models have the potential to 
improve the design of AD trials through selective inclusion and exclusion 
criteria based on expected cognitive decline. Such predictive models need 
further validation across data from different AD clinical trials.

We investigated the role of Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid cells 2 
(TREM2) in myelin regeneration in the brain. TREM2 is a receptor that activates 
microglia, which are crucial for clearing myelin debris and promoting 
remyelination. Previous studies in a mouse model of demyelination induced by the 
copper-chelating agent Cuprizone (CPZ) have shown that stimulation of TREM2 with 
a monoclonal antibody reduces demyelination, while deleting the Trem2 gene in 
mice impairs remyelination. Here, we blocked TREM2 function acutely with an 
antibody during both the demyelination and remyelination phases of the CPZ model 
and analyzed the impact of the antibody treatment on myelination and gene 
expression in single cells. We found that blocking TREM2 depleted a distinct 
population of microglia with high expression of the transcription factor MAFB 
during remyelination. The loss of these MAFB-high microglia was linked to 
impaired generation of myelinating oligodendrocytes. Importantly, we identified 
MAFB+ microglia in acute and acute-chronic brain lesions from individuals with 
multiple sclerosis (MS), but not in inactive lesions. We conclude that TREM2 is 
essential for maintaining a population of MAFB-high microglia that is associated 
with myelin repair. This finding has significant implications for understanding 
demyelinating diseases like MS and suggests that stimulating TREM2 could be a 
promising therapeutic approach for myelin repair.

PURPOSE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized 
by memory loss and cognitive decline. The relationship between AD and 
radiofrequency (RF) radiation emitted by wireless devices remains under 
investigation. The aim of this review is to comprehensively explore the effects 
of RF radiation on AD by evaluating existing literature. This review used Web of 
Science, Scopus, and PubMed to find relevant studies on AD and RF radiation. 
This review evaluates a total of 81 studies, including animal models, human 
studies, and in vitro experiments, with results summarized in tables for 
clarity.
CONCLUSION: Some studies suggest RF aggravates AD by increasing oxidative 
stress, impairing blood-brain barrier integrity, and promoting amyloid-beta 
deposition. Conversely, other studies indicate RF may have protective benefits, 
such as enhancing brain mitochondrial functions and reducing amyloid-beta 
levels. Understanding the RF-AD relationship, including parameters like 
frequency and exposure time, is crucial for therapeutic strategies. The studies 
reviewed highlight RF radiation's dual effects on AD, underscoring the need for 
a detailed approach. Further studies are required to clarify these effects and 
inform preventive and therapeutic measures.

Neuroinflammation plays a critical role in the development of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) and is closely associated with obesity. In AD, the fat 
cell-secreted protein leptin crosses the blood-brain barrier and protects 
against nerve damage. However, obesity may induce leptin resistance, reduce 
leptin sensitivity, stimulate excessive glial cell activation, promote 
inflammatory factor production and exacerbate brain inflammation. Unfortunately, 
the mechanism of interaction among high-fat diets, obesity, neuroinflammation 
and neurodegenerative diseases remains unclear. We investigated the changes in 
neuroinflammation and leptin sensitivity in the brains of wild-type and 
high-fat-diet-fed APP/PS1 transgenic mice. We explored the effects of treadmill 
exercise for 12 weeks on the leptin/LepR/GSK-3β signalling pathway and memory. 
The body weights of the high-fat-diet-fed mice increased, and elevated levels of 
markers for leptin resistance, including suppressor of signalling 3 (SOCS3), 
protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and proinflammatory factors such as 
tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), were observed. After 
12 weeks of aerobic exercise, the leptin mRNA and protein levels increased, 
GSK-3β protein expression decreased and the mean fluorescence intensities of 
brain microglial (IBA-1) and neuron markers (NeuN) decreased, indicating that 
exercise may activate the leptin/LepR/GSK-3β signalling pathway, reducing glial 
cell activation and inflammation. Our study revealed that obesity induces and 
exacerbates the AD-related neuroinflammatory response. Aerobic exercise 
activates the leptin/LepR/GSK-3β pathway to relieve neuroinflammation and 
protect nerve cells, alleviating AD-associated memory loss. These promising 
outcomes could inform the development of nondrug-based aerobic exercise 
interventions for the treatment of AD and associated cognitive disorders.

As the global population ages, neurodegenerative diseases, particularly 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), have become a major public health concern. AD is the 
most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, accounting for 60-80% of cases, and 
is characterized by progressive cognitive and memory decline due to neuronal 
loss. Current pharmacological treatments primarily offer symptomatic relief 
rather than a cure. Recent research has highlighted the role of vitamin D in 
neuroprotection, owing to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and 
neuroprotective properties, as well as its ability to maintain blood-brain 
barrier integrity and regulate amyloid-beta (Aβ) clearance. Another emerging 
noninvasive therapeutic approach is Low-Level Laser Therapy (LLLT), a form of 
photobiomodulation (PBM) that has been shown to enhance neuronal function, 
reduce oxidative stress, inflammation, and Aβ deposition, and potentially 
increase vitamin D levels. This review examines the interplay between LLLT, 
vitamin D, and oxidative stress in AD pathophysiology. Findings suggest that 
LLLT can stimulate mitochondrial function, enhance synaptic plasticity, and 
improve cognitive performance in preclinical and clinical studies. Furthermore, 
LLLT has been reported to modulate immune responses, promote neurogenesis, and 
facilitate vitamin D synthesis by activating cytochrome c oxidase (CCO), which 
plays a crucial role in mitochondrial energy production. However, while 
promising, further in vivo and clinical trials are required to optimize 
treatment protocols and establish standardized guidelines for LLLT application, 
particularly in enhancing vitamin D levels, in AD patients. CLINICAL TRIAL

Background Alzheimer disease (AD) progression can be monitored by tracking 
intensity changes in PET standardized uptake value (SUV) ratios of amyloid, tau, 
and neurodegeneration. The spatial extent ("fill state") of these three hallmark 
pathologic abnormalities may serve as critical pathophysiologic information, 
pending further investigation. Purpose To examine the clinical utility and 
increase the accessibility of PET-derived fill states. Materials and Methods 
This secondary analysis of two prospective studies used data from two 
independent cohorts: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and 
the Tau Propagation over Time study (T-POT). Each cohort comprised 
amyloid-negative cognitively normal individuals (controls) and patients with 
subjective cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, or probable-AD 
dementia. Fill states of amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration were computed as 
the percentages of significantly abnormal voxels relative to controls across PET 
scans. Fill states and SUV ratios were compared across stages (Kruskal-Wallis H 
test, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis) and 
tested for association with the severity of cognitive impairment (Spearman 
correlation, multivariate regression analysis). Additionally, a convolutional 
neural network (CNN) was developed to estimate fill states from patients' PET 
scans without requiring controls. Results The ADNI cohort included 324 
individuals (mean age, 72 years ± 6.8 [SD]; 173 [53%] female), and the T-POT 
cohort comprised 99 individuals (mean age, 66 years ± 8.7; 63 [64%] female). 
Higher fill states were associated with higher stages of cognitive impairment (P 
< .001), and tau and neurodegeneration fill states showed higher diagnostic 
performance for cognitive impairment compared with SUV ratio (P < .05) across 
cohorts. Similarly, all fill states were negatively correlated with cognitive 
performance (P < .001) and uniquely characterized the degree of cognitive 
impairment even after adjustment for SUV ratio (P < .05). The CNN estimated 
amyloid and tau accurately, but not neurodegeneration fill states. Conclusion 
Fill states provided reliable markers of AD progression, potentially improving 
early detection, staging, and monitoring of AD in clinical practice and trials 
beyond SUV ratio. Clinical trial registration no. NCT00106899 © RSNA, 2025

Cathepsin B has been shown to contribute to deficits in traumatic brain injury 
(TBI), an important risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cathepsin B is 
elevated in TBI and AD patients, as well as in animal models of these 
conditions. Knockout of the cathepsin B gene results in amelioration of 
TBI-induced motor dysfunction and improvement of AD memory deficit in mice. The 
mechanism of cathepsin B pathogenesis in these brain disorders has been 
hypothesized to involve its translocation to the cytosol from its normal 
lysosomal location. This study, therefore, evaluated brain cytosolic cathepsin B 
activity in the controlled cortical impact (CCI) mouse model of TBI. CCI-TBI 
resulted in motor deficits demonstrated by the rotarod assay, brain tissue 
lesions, and disorganization of the hippocampus. Significantly, CCI-TBI 
increased cytosolic cathepsin B activity in the brain cortex in the ipsilateral 
brain hemisphere that received the CCI-TBI injury, with a concomitant decrease 
in the lysosomal fraction. Cathepsin B activity was monitored using the 
substrate Z-Nle-Lys-Arg-AMC which specifically detects cathepsin B activity but 
not other cysteine proteases. The normal lysosomal distribution of cathepsin B 
was observed by its discrete localization in brain cortical cells. CCI-TBI 
resulted in a more diffuse cellular distribution of cathepsin B consistent with 
translocation to the cytosol. Further studies utilized the novel neutral 
pH-selective inhibitor, Z-Arg-Lys-AOMK, that specifically inhibits cathepsin B 
at neutral pH 7.2 of the cytosol but not at acidic pH 4.6 of lysosomes. Daily 
administration of Z-Arg-Lys-AOMK (ip), beginning 1 day before CCI-TBI, resulted 
in the reduction of the increased cytosolic cathepsin B activity induced by 
CCI-TBI. The inhibitor also reduced cathepsin B activities in homogenates of the 
brain cortex and hippocampus which were increased by CCI-TBI. Furthermore, the 
Z-Arg-Lys-AOMK inhibitor resulted in the reduction of motor function deficit 
resulting from CCI-TBI. These findings demonstrate the activation of cytosolic 
cathepsin B activity in CCI-TBI mouse brain injury.

Alzheimer's disease is one of the prevalent neurodegenerative diseases and is 
characterized by amyloid beta aggregate (Aβ) accumulation. This study reports an 
Aβ 1-42 induced 3D Alzheimer's disease modeling utilizing differentiated SH-SY5Y 
spheroids, which is carried out by Magnetic levitation approach, and the 
neuroprotective effect of Curcumin is further investigated on this model. For 
this purpose, SH-SY5Y spheroids are differentiated using Retinoic 
acid-Brain-derived neurotrophic factor sequentially during 3D cell culture. 
Differentiated spheroids maintained high viability and exhibited significant 
neuronal characteristics, as evidenced by increasing β-III tubulin and NeuN 
expressions. 3D Alzheimer's disease model formation and neurotoxicity of Aβ 1-42 
aggregates are investigated on un-/differentiated spheroids, resulting in 65% 
and 51% cell viability, respectively. Characterization of the 3D Alzheimer's 
disease model is done by immunostaining of Choline acetyltransferase to 
investigate cholinergic neuron activity loss, showing a 2.2 decrease in 
fluorescence intensity. Further, Curcumin treatment on the 3D Alzheimer's 
disease model resulted in augmenting cell viability, confirming neuroprotective 
effect of Curcumin on Aβ 1-42 induced Alzheimer's disease model. This study 
highlighted the magnetic levitation-based fabrication of Aβ 1-42-induced 3D 
Alzheimer's disease model successfully, offering a promising experimental 
platform for other neurodegenerative disease research and potential clinical 
applications.

Ketogenic diet, adenosine, and dopamine in addiction and psychiatry.

Ruskin DN(1), Martinez LA(1), Masino SA(1).

Author information:
(1)Trinity College, Hartford, CT, United States.

Adhering to the ketogenic diet can reduce or stop seizures, even when other 
treatments fail, via mechanism(s) distinct from other available therapies. These 
results have led to interest in the diet for treating conditions such as 
Alzheimer's disease, depression and schizophrenia. Evidence points to the 
neuromodulator adenosine as a key mechanism underlying therapeutic benefits of a 
ketogenic diet. Adenosine represents a unique and direct link among cell energy, 
neuronal activity, and gene expression, and adenosine receptors form functional 
heteromers with dopamine receptors. The importance of the dopaminergic system is 
established in addiction, as are the challenges of modulating the dopamine 
system directly. A mediator that could antagonize dopamine's effects would be 
useful, and adenosine is such a mediator due to its function and location. 
Studies report that the ketogenic diet improves cognition, sociability, and 
perseverative behaviors, and might improve depression. Many of the translational 
opportunities based on the ketogenic diet/adenosine link have come to the fore, 
including addiction, autism spectrum disorder, painful conditions, and a range 
of hyperdopaminergic disorders.

BackgroundNo effective therapies exist to prevent neurodegenerative mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) related to Alzheimer's disease. Therapies integrating 
music and/or dance are promising non-pharmacological options to effectively 
mitigate cognitive decline.ObjectiveTo deepen our understanding of individuals' 
relationships (i.e., histories, experiences, and attitudes) with music and 
dance, in order to incorporate such knowledge into the design of music- and 
dance-based interventions, thereby improving therapeutic outcomes.MethodsEleven 
older adults with MCI and five of their care partners/ spouses (4 M/12F; Black: 
n = 4, White: n = 10, Hispanic/Latino: n = 2; Age: 71.4 ± 9.6 years) first 
completed questionnaires, then participated in focus groups that captured 
aspects of their relationships with music and dance. Emergent themes were 
extracted from four major topics, including: (1) experience and history, (2) 
enjoyment and preferences, (3) confidence and barriers, and (4) impressions of 
music and dance as therapeutic tools.ResultsThematic analysis revealed 
participants' positive impressions of music and dance as potential therapeutic 
interventions, citing perceived neuropsychological, emotional, and physical 
benefits. Participants viewed music and dance as integral to their lives, 
histories, and identities within a culture, family, and/ or community. 
Participants also identified lifelong engagement barriers that, in conjunction 
with negative feedback, instilled persistent low self-efficacy regarding dancing 
and active music engagement. Questionnaires verified individuals' 
moderately-strong music and dance relationships, which were strongest in passive 
forms of music engagement (e.g., listening).ConclusionsOur findings support that 
individuals' music and dance relationships and the associated perceptions toward 
music and dance therapy may offer valuable insights that enhance the design of 
efficacious and engaging non-pharmacological therapies for individuals with MCI.

BackgroundThe Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale is widely used as a cognitive 
and functional measure in Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical trials. Given its 
time and personnel burden, there is a need to more efficiently identify patients 
who warrant further evaluation or clinical trial qualification. To potentially 
address this need, a novel performance-based test of cognition and daily 
functioning has been developed for use in AD research and clinical 
care.ObjectiveTo test whether this novel performance-based test is associated 
with levels of daily functioning in both impaired and unimpaired 
individuals.MethodsOne-hundred-seventy-one participants (72 cognitively 
unimpaired; 53 amnestic mild cognitive impairment; 46 mild AD) completed the 
novel performance-based test of cognition and daily functioning, as well as the 
Quick Dementia Rating System (QDRS) for estimating global CDR.ResultsThe novel 
test was significantly associated with the QDRS Total, as well as the Behavioral 
and Cognitive subdomains, and differentiated between estimated global CDR scores 
of 0 versus ≥0.5. No significant effect of age, sex, or education on the 
performance-based test was observed.ConclusionsThe performance-based test used 
in this study can be considered a measure of cognition and daily functioning. As 
such, it may be a quick, objective method for identifying impaired individuals 
who may qualify for clinical trial enrollment or may warrant further evaluation 
without the need for informant input.

Neuroinflammation has emerged as a crucial factor in the pathogenesis of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), paving the way for promising therapeutic 
interventions. Increasing evidence highlights the interplay between the 
peripheral immune system and the central nervous system (CNS) in driving 
neuroinflammation, with T lymphocytes playing a vital role in both regulatory 
and effector functions. Aberrant activation of T cells during the early stages 
of neuroinflammation perpetuates inflammatory responses by interacting with CNS 
glial cells and releasing pro-inflammatory mediators, such as IFN-γ, TNF-α, and 
IL-17. Studies have documented significant T cell activation and infiltration 
into the brain parenchyma in AD, contributing to disease progression. However, 
the specific mechanisms by which T cells mediate AD pathogenesis remain unclear. 
This comprehensive review synthesizes the current understanding of T cell 
involvement in AD pathology, emphasizing their aberrant activation, interactions 
with microglia, tau protein pathology, and the influence of gut microbiota. 
Finally, we propose potential treatment modalities for AD, highlighting the 
promise of T cellbased therapies currently under investigation in clinical 
trials. Understanding the critical role of T cells in intercellular 
communication and disease progression may enhance our comprehension of the 
pathophysiology of AD.

The research and design of new inhibitors for the treatment of diseases such as 
Alzheimer's disease and glaucoma through inhibition of cholinesterases (ChEs; 
acetylcholinesterase, AChE and butyrylcholinesterase, BChE) and carbonic 
anhydrase enzymes are among the important targets. Here, a series of novel 
sulfonamide-bearing pyrazolone derivatives (1a-f and 2a-f) were successfully 
synthesized and characterized by using spectroscopic and analytical methods. The 
inhibitory activities of these newly synthesized compounds were evaluated both 
in vitro and in silico for their effect on carbonic anhydrases (hCA I and hCA II 
isoenzymes) and ChEs. The in vitro studies showed that these novel compounds 
demonstrated potential inhibitory activity, with KI values covering the 
following ranges: 18.03 ± 2.86-75.54 ± 4.91 nM for hCA I, 
24.84 ± 1.57-85.42 ± 6.60 nM for hCA II, 7.45 ± 0.98-16.04 ± 1.60 nM for AChE, 
and 34.78 ± 5.88-135.70 ± 17.39 nM for BChE. Additionally, many of these 
compounds showed promising inhibitory activity, and some showed higher potency 
than reference compounds. While the in silico studies have also identified the 
potential binding positions of these compounds, using the crystal structures of 
hCA I, II, AChE and BChE receptors. The varying affinities demonstrated by these 
designed compounds for ChEs and hCA isoenzymes show that these compounds could 
hold promise as potential alternative agents for selectively inhibiting ChEs and 
hCAs in the treatment of diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and glaucoma.

Neurological disorders present considerable challenges in diagnosis and 
treatment due to their complex and diverse etiology. Retrotransposons are a type 
of mobile genetic element that are increasingly revealed to play a role in these 
diseases. This review provides a detailed overview of recent developments in the 
study of retrotransposons in neurodevelopment, neuroaging, and neurological 
diseases. Retrotransposons, including long interspersed nuclear elements-1, Alu, 
SINE-VNTR-Alu, and endogenous retrovirus, play important regulatory roles in the 
development and aging of the nervous system. They have also been implicated in 
the pathological processes of several neurological diseases, including 
Alzheimer's disease, X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism, amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis, autism spectrum disorder, and schizophrenia. Retrotransposons provide 
a new perspective for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying 
neurological diseases and provide insights into diagnostic and therapeutic 
strategies of these diseases.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex disorder that affects multiple 
biological systems including cognition, behavior and physical health. 
Unfortunately, the pathogenic mechanisms behind AD are not yet clear and the 
treatment options are still limited. Despite the increasing number of studies 
examining the pairwise relationships between genetic factors, physical activity 
(PA), and AD, few have successfully integrated all three domains of data, which 
may help reveal mechanisms and impact of these genomic and phenomic factors on 
AD. We use high-dimensional mediation analysis as an integrative framework to 
study the relationships among genetic factors, PA and AD-like brain atrophy 
quantified by spatial patterns of brain atrophy.
RESULTS: We integrate data from genetics, PA and neuroimaging measures collected 
from 13,425 UK Biobank samples to unveil the complex relationship among genetic 
risk factors, behavior and brain signatures in the contexts of aging and AD. 
Specifically, we used a composite imaging marker, Spatial Pattern of Abnormality 
for Recognition of Early AD (SPARE-AD) that characterizes AD-like brain atrophy, 
as an outcome variable to represent AD risk. Through GWAS, we identified single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are significantly associated with SPARE-AD 
as exposure variables. We employed conventional summary statistics and 
functional principal component analysis to extract patterns of PA as mediators. 
After constructing these variables, we utilized a high-dimensional mediation 
analysis method, Bayesian Mediation Analysis (BAMA), to estimate potential 
mediating pathways between SNPs, multivariate PA signatures and SPARE-AD. BAMA 
incorporates Bayesian continuous shrinkage prior to select the active mediators 
from a large pool of candidates. We identified a total of 22 mediation pathways, 
indicating how genetic variants can influence SPARE-AD by altering physical 
activity. By comparing the results with those obtained using univariate 
mediation analysis, we demonstrate the advantages of high-dimensional mediation 
analysis methods over univariate mediation analysis.
CONCLUSION: Through integrative analysis of multi-omics data, we identified 
several mediation pathways of physical activity between genetic factors and 
SPARE-AD. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the pathogenic 
mechanisms of AD. Moreover, our research demonstrates the potential of the 
high-dimensional mediation analysis method in revealing the mechanisms of 
disease.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder 
worldwide, causing dementia and affecting millions of individuals. One prominent 
characteristic in the brains of AD patients is glucose hypometabolism. In the 
context of galactose metabolism, intracellular glucose levels are heightened. 
Galactose mutarotase (GALM) plays a crucial role in maintaining normal galactose 
metabolism by catalyzing the conversion of β-D-galactose into α-D-galactose 
(α-D-G). The latter is then converted into glucose-6-phosphate, improving 
glucose metabolism levels. However, the involvement of GALM in AD progression is 
still unclear. In the present study, we found that the expression of GALM was 
significantly increased in AD patients and model mice. Genetic knockdown of GALM 
using adeno-associated virus did not change the expression of amyloid precursor 
protein (APP) and APP-cleaving enzymes including a disintegrin and 
metalloprotease 10 (ADAM10), β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), and 
presenilin-1 (PS1). Interestingly, genetic overexpression of GALM reduced APP 
and Aβ deposition by increasing the maturation of ADAM10, although it did not 
alter the expression of BACE1 and PS1. Further electrophysiological and 
behavioral experiments showed that GALM overexpression significantly ameliorated 
the deficits in hippocampal CA1 long-term potentiation (LTP) and spatial 
learning and memory in AD model mice. Importantly, direct α-D-G (20 mg/kg, i.p.) 
also inhibited Aβ deposition by increasing the maturation of ADAM10, thereby 
improving hippocampal CA1 LTP and spatial learning and memory in AD model mice. 
Taken together, our results indicate that GALM shifts APP processing towards 
α-cleavage, preventing Aβ generation by increasing the level of mature ADAM10. 
These findings indicate that GALM may be a potential therapeutic target for AD, 
and α-D-G has the potential to be used as a dietary supplement for the 
prevention and treatment of AD.

This article presents an extension of an article previously featured in History 
and Philosophy of the Life Sciences by Schweda and Jongsma (History and 
Philosophy of the Life Sciences, 2022), who aptly (1) critiqued the 
"Zombification" of people living with dementia by reviewing the historic and 
philosophic origins of this damaging metaphor and (2) offered a life course 
perspective to highlight the ethical implications related to biomedicine and the 
life sciences. Herein, we aim to build upon and constructively critique the 
important discourse offered by Schweda and Jongsma by (1) presenting a 
transdisciplinary perspective highlighting many important remaining social and 
cognitive abilities of people living with dementia that (2) further informs 
philosophical discussion and (3) provides ways of helping people diagnosed as 
well as formal and informal caregivers to live with dementia rather than 
enduring the damaging and incorrect "living death" notion, and its 
ramifications, of the syndrome. In the process, we will explore many inherent 
harms associated with the "zombie-like" construction of the syndrome: harms that 
entail dysfunctional treatment of people living with dementia. Specifically, we 
will draw upon evidence from psychology, sociology, philosophy, neurology, and 
neuroscience, to provide an integrated, whole-person perspective that adds 
specific dimensions to the life-course perspective and support the necessary 
multifaceted interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research and clinical 
collaborations for this complex issue.

The complement system protects against infection, positively responds to tissue 
damage, clears cell debris, directs and modulates the adaptive immune system, 
and functions in neuronal development, normal synapse elimination and 
intracellular metabolism. However, complement also has a role in aberrant 
synaptic pruning and neuroinflammation - processes that lead to a feedforward 
loop of inflammation, injury and neuronal death that can contribute to 
neurodegenerative and neurological disorders, including Alzheimer disease. This 
Review provides justification, largely from preclinical mouse models but also 
from correlates with human tissue and biomarkers, for targeting specific 
complement components for therapeutic intervention in Alzheimer disease. We 
discuss promising strategies to slow the progression of cognitive loss with 
minimal undesired effects. The diverse interactions and functions of complement 
system components can influence biological processes in the healthy and diseased 
brain; here, these functions are described as a prerequisite to selecting 
appropriate, safe and effective therapeutic targets for translation to the 
clinic.

Cost-effective, noninvasive screening methods for preclinical Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) and other neurocognitive disorders remain an unmet need. The 
olfactory neural circuits develop AD pathological changes prior to symptom 
onset. To probe these vulnerable circuits, we developed the digital remote 
AROMHA Brain Health Test (ABHT), an at-home odor identification, discrimination, 
memory, and intensity assessment. The ABHT was self-administered among 
cognitively normal (CN) English and Spanish speakers (n = 127), participants 
with subjective cognitive complaints (SCC; n = 34), and mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI; n = 19). Self-administered tests took place remotely at home 
under unobserved (among interested CN participants) and observed modalities (CN, 
SCC, and MCI), as well as in-person with a research assistant present (CN, SCC, 
and MCI). Olfactory performance was similar across observed and unobserved 
remote self-administration and between English and Spanish speakers. Odor 
memory, identification, and discrimination scores decreased with age, and 
olfactory identification and discrimination were lower in the MCI group compared 
to CN and SCC groups, independent of age, sex, and education. The ABHT revealed 
age-related olfactory decline, and discriminated CN older adults from those with 
cognitive impairment. Replication of our results in other populations would 
support the use of the ABHT to identify and monitor individuals at risk for 
developing dementia.

Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) exhibit significant global public health 
challenges due to the lack of effective treatments. Berberine (BBR), a natural 
alkaloid compound in various plants, has been recognized for its potential 
neuroprotective properties. This review explores the current understanding of 
BBR's mechanisms of action and its therapeutic potential in preventing and 
treating NDs such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's 
disease. BBR's neuroprotective properties are attributed to its multifaceted 
actions, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiapoptotic, and 
neurotrophic effects. In addition, BBR can influence many signaling pathways 
involved in neurodegeneration, including AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), 
nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2, and brain-derived neurotrophic 
factor pathways. Furthermore, BBR targets vital signaling pathways, including 
AMPK, PI3K/Akt, and MAPK, which are essential for developing NDs. In addition, 
BBR's efficacy in reducing neurodegenerative pathology and improving cognitive 
function has been demonstrated through preclinical studies using cellular and 
animal models. Clinical trials demonstrating BBR's therapeutic potential in NDs 
have yielded promising results, but further research is needed to confirm its 
safety and efficacy in humans.

PURPOSE: We aimed to address fears and lived experiences of cognitive decline 
among adults via whole-person conversations that elicit problems and goals that 
matter most to patients. Currently, 6.7 million Americans have Alzheimer disease 
or related dementias, with an additional 28 million people reporting subjective 
cognitive decline-a possible indicator of Alzheimer disease and related 
dementias. A review of tools for older adults with cognitive impairment showed 
strong clinical specificity, with insufficient whole-person support for 
patients. We developed and tested the feasibility and acceptability of a tool to 
enhance conversations for adults with cognitive impairment at the point of care.
METHODS: We conducted a feasibility study to build a conversation tool, guided 
by principles of shared decision making, called the "About Me" Care Card. 
Informed by an environmental scan, we created and pilot-tested prototypes at 
implementation sites. All phases were overseen by a multidisciplinary steering 
committee.
RESULTS: Fourteen diverse clinicians consisting of 7 clinician types across 7 
institutions piloted the card during in-person visits or by telephone. 
Observations showed that the card (1) allowed time to elicit what matters most 
to patients, (2) created space for personalized care conversations, (3) opened 
an examination of social care needs, and (4) moderated emotional relationships 
between families and individuals.
CONCLUSION: A community-based codesign process led to a feasible tool for 
primary care teams to facilitate whole-person conversations with aging adults. 
The About Me Care Card appeared to broaden conversations compared with routine 
care. More work is needed to determine scalability and effects on outcomes.

The blood-brain barrier is a physiological barrier between the vascular system 
and the nervous system. Under healthy conditions, it restricts the passage of 
most biomolecules into the brain, making drug development exceedingly 
challenging. Conventional cell-based in vitro models provide valuable insights 
into certain features of the BBB. Nevertheless, these models often lack the 
three-dimensional structure and dynamic interactions of the surrounding 
microenvironment, which greatly influence cell functionality. Consequently, 
considerable efforts have been made to enhance in vitro models for drug 
development and disease research. Recently, microfluidic organ-on-a-chip systems 
have emerged as promising candidates to better mimic the dynamic nature of the 
BBB. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent BBB-on-chip 
devices. The typical building blocks, chip designs, the perfusion 
infrastructure, and readouts used to characterize and evaluate BBB formation are 
presented, analyzed, and discussed in detail. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The 
blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a highly selective barrier that controls what can 
enter the brain. While it protects the brain from harmful substances, it also 
hinders the delivery of treatments for neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's 
and Parkinson's. Due to its complexity, studying the BBB in living organisms 
remains difficult. However, recent advances in "organ-on-a-chip" technology have 
allowed scientists to create small, engineered models that replicate the BBB. 
These models provide a powerful platform to study diseases and test potential 
drugs with greater accuracy than traditional methods. Organ-on-a-chip devices 
are designed to mimic the behavior of organs or tissues in the human body, 
offering a more realistic and controlled environment for research. This review 
highlights recent breakthroughs in BBB-on-a-chip technology, showing how these 
models enhance current research and have the potential to transform the way we 
study brain diseases and develop new drugs. By integrating biology and 
engineering, BBB-on-a-chip technology has the potential to transform 
neuroscience research, improve drug development, and enhance our understanding 
of brain disorders.

Cerebral glycolytic alteration has been identified as an important contributor 
to the pathological progress of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Research has shown 
that gastrodin (GAS) possesses neuroprotection in various experimental models of 
AD, but its specific mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we determined 
whether GAS exerted neuroprotective effects on AD models through regulating 
PI3K/AKT/BACH1 signaling axis. Eight-week-old C57BL/6 J male mice were 
intracerebroventricularly injected with Aβ25-35, to establish an AD model, 
followed by the administration of GAS (30, 60 mg·kg-1·d-1, i.g.) for 21 days. 
Treatment of GAS markedly alleviated the downregulation of p-PI3K Tyr199/458, 
p-AKT Ser473, BACH1 and HK1 in the hippocampus of the Aβ25-35-induced AD mice. 
To further explore the mechanism of GAS-mediated neuroprotection, an in vitro AD 
cellular model was established by challenging HT22 cells with Aβ25-35. In the 
Aβ25-35 induced cells, the expression of BACH1, p-PI3K Tyr199/458 and p-AKT 
Ser473 was reduced, the mRNA and protein levels of HK1 were decreased, and the 
levels of pyruvate and ATP were reduced. After treatment of GAS, the decline of 
these indicators was reversed. In addition, overexpression of BACH1 by 
lentivirus transfection significantly upregulated the mRNA and protein levels of 
HK1, thereby enhancing glycolytic function and protecting HT22 cells from 
Aβ25-35-induced injury. The results of chromatin immunoprecipitation 
assay-real-time quantitative PCR revealed that BACH1 directly bound to the HK1 
promoter region. Collectively, these findings suggest that GAS can play a 
protective role in Aβ25-35-induced experimental AD models by increasing HK1 
expression and ameliorating glycolytic dysfunction through activation of the 
PI3K/AKT/BACH1 signaling axis.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the main cause of dementia in the elderly, and is 
becoming one of the most expensive and deadly diseases. Deficiency of 
neurotrophic factors signaling is an important cause of this disease. Therefore, 
we investigated whether neuritin as a neurotrophic factor can have a 
neuroprotective effect against streptozotocin (STZ)-induced rat model of AD. The 
animals were bilaterally injected with intra hippocampal-STZ (3 mg/kg). 
Different concentrations of neuritin (0.5, 1, 1.5 µg/rat) were administrated 
15 min before STZ injection. After 14 days, the rats were evaluated for 
cognitive performance using novel object recognition (NOR), open field and 
Morris water maze (MWM) tests and then sacrificed for biochemical analysis (by 
real-time PCR and western blot examinations). The results demonstrated that the 
STZ- induced learning and memory impairments were significantly prevented by 
1.5 µg neuritin. Moreover, the increased levels of inflammatory factors (NF-κb, 
TNF-α and IL-1β) and apoptotic parameters (cytochrome c and caspase‑3) in STZ- 
treated rats were also significantly decreased by neuritin. In addition, 
hippocampal neuritin gene expression was downregulated by STZ injection, which 
was reversed by intra hippocampal neuritin injection. In conclusion, the present 
study suggests that neuritin prevents cognitive defects in AD rat model and its 
expression level is associated with cognitive resilience.

Synaptic dysfunction is an early pathological phenotype of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) that is initiated by oligomers of amyloid β peptide (Aβos). Treatments 
aimed at correcting synaptic dysfunction could be beneficial in preventing 
disease progression, but mechanisms underlying Aβo-induced synaptic defects 
remain incompletely understood. Here, we uncover an epithelial sodium channel 
(ENaC) - CaV2.3 - protein kinase C (PKC) - glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) 
signal transduction pathway that is engaged by Aβos to enhance presynaptic 
CaV2.1 voltage-gated Ca2+ channel activity, resulting in pathological 
potentiation of action-potential-evoked synaptic vesicle exocytosis. We present 
evidence that the pathway is active in human APP transgenic mice in vivo and in 
human AD brains, and we show that either pharmacological CaV2.1 inhibition or 
genetic CaV2.1 haploinsufficiency is sufficient to restore normal 
neurotransmitter release. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized 
mechanism driving synaptic dysfunction in AD and identify multiple potentially 
tractable therapeutic targets.

Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) are essential in the treatment of 
neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease, as they prevent the 
breakdown of acetylcholine, thereby enhancing cognitive function. This review 
provides a comprehensive analysis of the structural motifs and mechanisms 
governing AChEI pharmacological activity, with a focus on medicinal chemistry 
strategies to enhance potency, selectivity, and pharmacokinetic properties. 
Beginning with the physiological role of acetylcholinesterase in neurological 
disorders, the review explores the historical evolution of AChEIs and highlights 
key structural interactions with catalytic, peripheral anionic, and allosteric 
binding sites. Advances in computational modeling, virtual screening, and 
structure-based drug design are discussed, alongside emerging approaches, such 
as multi-target-directed ligands and prodrugs. Additionally, the significance of 
natural products and drug repurposing in identifying novel AChEI scaffolds is 
emphasized, contributing to chemical diversity and innovation in drug discovery. 
By integrating computational tools, expansive chemical libraries, and innovative 
design strategies, this review identifies promising directions for developing 
effective AChEIs. These advancements hold great potential in addressing the 
multifaceted nature of neurodegenerative diseases and improving therapeutic 
interventions.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the aged 
population. Histone acetylation is a major epigenetic mechanism linked to memory 
formation and cognitive function. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are responsible 
for the deacetylation of lysine residues in histone proteins. Although pan-HDAC 
inhibitors are effective in ameliorating AD phenotypes in preclinical models, 
they are associated with potential unfavorable adverse effects and barely 
translated into clinical trials. Therefore, the development of novel HDAC 
inhibitors with a well isoform-selectivity has been desired in AD drug 
discovery. Among various HDAC isoforms, HDAC3 is highly expressed in neurons and 
exhibits detrimental effects on synaptic plasticity and cognitive function. 
Moreover, HDAC3 provokes neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity and contributes to 
AD pathogenesis. In this review, we highlight HDAC3 as an attractive therapeutic 
target for disease-modifying therapy in AD. In addition, we discuss the 
therapeutic potential of HDAC3 inhibitors in other neurological disorders.

Emerging evidence suggests a bidirectional relationship between Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) and epilepsy. In our previous studies, we identified a partial 
AD-like phenotype associated with central insulin resistance in the Wistar 
audiogenic rat (WAR), a genetic model of epilepsy. We also found that 
intracerebroventricular administration of streptozotocin, a compound used to 
model diabetes and AD, exacerbates seizure susceptibility. Given the role of 
insulin signaling in both AD and epilepsy, we hypothesized that metformin (MET), 
an anti-diabetic drug known for enhancing insulin sensitivity, could be a 
potential therapeutic agent for both conditions. Our objective was to 
investigate MET's effects on brain insulin signaling, seizure activity, and 
AD-like pathology in WARs. Adult male WARs received oral MET (250 mg/kg) for 
21 days. Audiogenic seizures were assessed using the Categorized Severity Index 
and Racine's scale. Spatial memory was tested with the Morris water maze (MWM), 
followed by Western blot analysis of hippocampal proteins. MET significantly 
reduced seizure severity and improved MWM performance. Although MET did not 
affect insulin receptor levels or activation, it increased phosphoinositide 
3-kinase (PI3K), activated Akt, and increased glycogen synthase kinase-3α/β 
(GSK-3α/β) levels. MET also decreased amyloid β precursor protein (AβPP) levels 
but did not affect Tau phosphorylation. These results suggest that chronic MET 
treatment alleviates behaviors related to both AD and epilepsy in WARs and 
modulates insulin signaling independently of insulin receptor activation. Our 
findings highlight MET's potential as a therapeutic agent for managing comorbid 
AD and epilepsy, warranting further investigation into its mechanisms of action.

To investigate the impact of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) on the cognitive 
function of mice with Alzheimer's disease (AD), while also identifying the 
cellular pathways associated with autophagy involved in the treatment. 
Twenty-four APP/PSl double transgenic mice were randomly assigned to either 
Group A or Group B, while another 24 C57 mice were randomly allocated to Group C 
or Group D. HBOT was administered to mice in Group B and Group D, and the Morris 
water maze test was used to assess changes in mice behavior. Histological 
examination using hematoxylin and eosin staining was conducted to observe 
pathological alterations in the hippocampus of the mice brain tissue. Polymerase 
chain reaction (PCR) was employed to analyze autophagy-related gene pathways in 
the hippocampus of the mice. Following HBOT, mice in Group B exhibited a 
significant reduction in escape latency and a notable increase in residence time 
within the target quadrant compared with Group A (P<0.05), as well as Group C 
and Group D (P<0.01). The hippocampal neurons in Group A and Group B mice 
exhibited disorganized arrangements, characterized by pyknosis and margination. 
Conversely, neurons in Group C displayed orderly arrangements, retaining intact 
structures with round nuclei demonstrating clear nuclear staining and normal 
morphology. The cellular morphology of mice in Group D remained unaffected. PCR 
analysis revealed no notable disparity in autophagy-related gene expression 
between Group A and Group C. However, the expression levels of five genes 
including Tgfb1, Mapk14, Bid, Atg7, and Akt1, were significantly elevated in 
Group B compared to Group A. HBOT has the potential to improve the cognitive 
function in mice modeled with AD. This improvement of cognitive function appears 
to be mediated by the up-regulation of autophagy-related genes, specifically 
Tgfb1, Mapk14, Bid, Atg7, and Akt1. These results indicate that HBOT may offer a 
therapeutic strategy for treating AD by enhancing autophagy mechanisms. Key 
words Alzheimer's disease, Autophagy, Hyperbaric oxygen, Morris water maze, PCR.

Berberine (BBR), a small molecule protoberberine isoquinoline alkaloid, is easy 
to cross the blood-brain barrier and is a potential drug for neurodegenerative 
diseases. Here, we explored the role and molecular mechanism of BBR in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. Weighted gene co-expression network 
analysis (WGCNA) was conducted to determine AD pathology-associated gene modules 
and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were also identified. GO and KEGG 
analyses were performed for gene function and signaling pathway annotation. Cell 
counting kit-8 (CCK8) assay was applied to analyze cell viability. 
Immunofluorescence (IF) staining assay was conducted to measure the levels of 
polarization markers. The production of inflammatory cytokines was analyzed by 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) level 
and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were detected using a ROS detection 
kit and a MMP Detection Kit (JC-1), respectively. AD pathology-associated DEGs 
were applied for GO function annotation and KEGG enrichment analysis, and the 
results uncovered that AD pathology was related to immune and inflammation. 
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure induced the M1 phenotype of microglia, and BBR 
suppressed LPS-induced M1 polarization and induced microglia toward M2 
polarization. Through co-culture of microglia and neuronal cells, we found that 
BBR exerted a neuro-protective role by attenuating the injury of LPS-induced 
HMC3 on SH-SY5Y cells. Mechanically, BBR switched the M1/M2 phenotypes of 
microglia by activating PI3K-AKT signaling. In summary, BBR protected neuronal 
cells from activated microglia-mediated neuro-inflammation by switching the 
M1/M2 polarization in LPS-induced microglia via activating PI3K-AKT signaling. 
Key words Alzheimer's Disease, Berberine, Microglia polarization, 
Neuroinflammation, PI3K-AKT signaling.

BACKGROUND: Impaired mitophagy results in the accumulation of defective 
mitochondria that are unable to be cleared effectively in Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). Aloe-emodin (AE), a key component of the traditional Chinese medicine 
Rhubarb, exhibits neuroprotective effects against Alzheimer's disease, though 
the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Studying aloe-emodin's role in 
enhancing mitophagy is vital for improving cognitive function and reducing 
neuronal damage in Alzheimer's disease.
METHODS: The APP/PS1 double transgenic mice were adopted as models for AD to 
assess the effects of aloe-emodin upon cognitive function and its 
neuroprotective impact on hippocampal neurons. Additionally, we investigated the 
regulatory mechanisms of proteins within the aforementioned pathway, and the 
morphological characteristics of mitophagy-related proteins. An AD hippocampal 
neuron model was developed using Aβ25-35 to evaluate the mitochondrial function, 
the protein expression of such a pathway and the mitophagy. This approach aims 
to elucidate the effects and underlying mechanisms of aloe-emodin in relation to 
AD.
RESULTS: AE activates mitophagy in neurons, improves cognitive dysfunction, 
reduces hippocampal damage, and alleviates AD symptoms in model mice. AE 
activates the expression of AMPK, PGC-1α and SIRT3. Increased expression of 
SIRT3 in mitochondria promotes mitophagy and regulates the function of 
mitochondrial proteins. When mitochondrial autophagy is enhanced, the expression 
of Beclin1, LC3, P62, Parkin, and PINK1-related proteins changes. Further 
in vitro experiments showed that AE can enhance mitochondrial function in 
Alzheimer's disease cell models. The mitochondrial membrane potential, GSH, ROS 
and Ca2+ levels gradually recover, alleviating the pathological manifestations 
of AD. Knocking down SIRT3 leads to increased mitochondrial damage and a 
reduction in mitophagy in HT22 cells.
CONCLUSION: Experimental results show that AE can activate mitophagy through 
AMPK/PGC-1α/SIRT3 pathway, alleviate cognitive dysfunction in AD, and reduce 
damage to hippocampal neurons.

BACKGROUND: Visual working memory (VWM), which is an essential component of 
higher cognitive processes, declines with age and is associated with the 
progression from amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) to Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). Cognitive impairment, particularly in VWM, is prominent in aMCI 
and may indicate disease progression. This study investigates the cognitive 
neural mechanisms responsible for VWM impairment in aMCI, with a focus on 
identifying the VWM processing stages affected. The study targets the 
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for repetitive transcranial magnetic 
stimulation (rTMS) to investigate its influence on VWM in aMCI patients. The 
role of the DLPFC in the top-down control of VWM processing is central to 
understanding rTMS effects on the stages of information processing in 
aMCI-related VWM impairments.
METHODS: A 7-day rTMS intervention was performed in 25 aMCI patients and 15 
healthy elderly controls to investigate its effects on VWM and cognitive 
functions. Tasks included VWM change detection, digital symbol transformation, 
and the Stroop task for attention and executive functions. EEG analyses 
consisting of ERP, ERSP, and functional connectivity (wPLI) were integrated. The 
first part of the study addressed the cognitive neural mechanism of VWM 
impairment in aMCI and differentiated the processing stages using EEG. The 
second part investigated the effects of rTMS on EEG processing at different VWM 
stages and revealed cognitive neural mechanisms that improve visual working 
memory in aMCI.
RESULTS: The results indicated a significant deterioration of VWM tasks in aMCI, 
especially in accuracy and memory capacity, with prolonged reaction time and 
increased duration of the Stroop task. In the VWM memory encoding phase, N2pc 
amplitude, α-oscillation in the parieto-occipital region, and θ-band 
synchronization in the frontoparietal connectivity decreased. Conversely, rTMS 
improved N2pc amplitude, α-oscillation, and θ-band synchronization, which 
correlated with improved frontoparietal connectivity, parieto-occipital 
α-oscillation, and attentional capacity.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with aMCI experience significant deterioration in VWM 
function, particularly during the encoding phase. This deterioration manifests 
in reduced accuracy and capacity of memory performance, accompanied by a 
significant decrease in N2pc amplitude, alpha oscillations, and theta-band 
connectivity in frontoparietal and fronto-occipital brain regions. rTMS proves 
to be a promising intervention that improves VWM, attention, and executive 
functions. In particular, it supports attention during target selection by 
increasing N2pc amplitude during encoding, enhancing alpha oscillations for 
better suppression of irrelevant information, and increasing synchronization in 
frontoparietal and occipital functional connectivity, which ultimately improves 
visual working memory.

BACKGROUND: Timely identification of reversible conditions that mimic dementia 
is critical in memory clinic practice. However, psychiatric conditions as 
potential dementia mimics have not been studied as thoroughly as neurological 
ones, and detailed data on their reversibility remain limited.
OBJECTIVE: To identify reversible psychiatric dementia mimics.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted on 749 new outpatients to 
investigate etiologies, progression rates, a neuropsychological assessment, 
cognitive and functional levels, and potential reversibility, categorized by 
psychiatric and neurological conditions. Cases showing cognitive reversibility 
following treatment were also identified. Comparisons were made based on the 
presence or absence of potential reversibility, as well as actual reversibility.
RESULTS: Among the 749 individuals, 121 (16.2%) had potentially reversible 
conditions: 75 psychiatric and 46 neurological. Psychiatric conditions included 
depression, schizophrenia and delusional disorders, developmental disorders, 
alcohol use disorder, and dissociative and anxiety disorders. Compared to 
individuals without potentially reversible conditions, individuals with 
psychiatric conditions were younger, had a faster progression rate, and 
demonstrated higher cognitive function. Of the individuals who had mild 
cognitive impairment or dementia mimic, 6 (0.9%) showed complete cognitive 
resolution (3 cases) or partial cognitive improvement (3 cases). These 6 cases 
included two individuals with psychiatric conditions manifesting psychotic 
features.
CONCLUSIONS: While rare, reversible psychiatric dementia mimics highlight the 
importance of comprehensive evaluations in memory clinics, particularly for 
younger individuals experiencing rapid cognitive decline. The infrequency of 
reversibility may reflect a strong association between these potentially 
reversible conditions and dementia risk factors, or their role as prodromes of 
dementia itself.

BACKGROUND: Observational studies indicate a complex relationship between 
coagulation factors and Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the current findings 
are inconsistent, and it remains uncertain whether a causal relationship exists.
OBJECTIVE: This study utilizes a Mendelian randomization analysis to investigate 
the causal relationships between blood levels of coagulation factors and AD 
risk.
METHODS: Eleven coagulation factors with valid instrumental variables available 
were evaluated. Two independent cohorts of European ancestry with AD genome-wide 
association study (GWAS) summary statistics were used: UK Biobank (UKB, 
N = 472,868) and the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP, 
N = 63,926). We primarily conducted Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses using 
the Inverse variance weighted (IVW). Meanwhile, the MR-Egger intercept test is 
used to detect horizontal pleiotropy, the Residual Sum of Squares observed 
(RSSobs) is used to assess the model's goodness of fit, and the leave-one-out 
analysis is employed for sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: Using IVW analysis, the UKB database shows positive correlations of 
Protein C (PC, p = 0.002), Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT, 
p = 0.019), and coagulation factor X (FX, p = 0.032) with AD, and a negative 
association for coagulation factor XI (FXI, p = 0.021). The IGAP database 
mirrors these findings for PC and FXI but not for the others. Leave-one-out 
analysis showed an anomaly after a single single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 
driving, yet the overall results remained stable.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that elevated levels of PC, FX, and aPTT, 
along with reduced levels of FXI, are causally associated with an increased risk 
of AD. These findings might pave the way for the diagnosis and treatment of AD.

RNA activation (RNAa), a gene regulatory mechanism mediated by small activating 
RNAs (saRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs), has significant implications for 
therapeutic applications. Unlike small interfering RNA (siRNA), which is known 
for gene silencing in RNA interference (RNAi), synthetic saRNAs can stably 
upregulate target gene expression at the transcriptional level through the 
assembly of the RNA-induced transcriptional activation (RITA) complex. Moreover, 
the dual functionality of endogenous miRNAs in RNAa (hereafter referred to as 
mi-RNAa) reveals their complex role in cellular processes and disease pathology. 
Emerging studies suggest saRNAs' potential as a novel therapeutic modality for 
diseases such as metabolic disorders, hearing loss, tumors, and Alzheimer's. 
Notably, MTL-CEBPA, the first saRNA drug candidate, shows promise in 
hepatocellular carcinoma treatment, while RAG-01 is being explored for 
non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, highlighting clinical advancements in RNAa. 
This review synthesizes our current understanding of the mechanisms of RNAa and 
highlights recent advancements in the study of mi-RNAa and the therapeutic 
development of saRNAs.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a modifiable risk factor for Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). TBI and AD share several histopathological hallmarks: namely, beta-amyloid 
aggregation, tau hyperphosphorylation, and plasma protein infiltration. The 
relative contributions of these proteinopathies and their interplay in the 
pathogenesis of both conditions remains unclear although important differences 
are emerging. This review synthesises emerging evidence for the critical role of 
the neurovascular unit in mediating protein accumulation and neurotoxicity in 
both TBI and AD. We propose a shared pathogenic cascade centred on a 
neurovascular unit, in which increased blood-brain barrier permeability induces 
a series of noxious mechanisms leading to neuronal loss, synaptic dysfunction 
and ultimately cognitive dysfunction in both conditions. We explore the 
application of this hypothesis to outstanding research questions and potential 
treatments for TBI and AD, as well as other neurodegenerative and 
neuroinflammatory conditions. Limitations of this hypothesis, including the 
challenges of establishing a causal relationship between neurovascular damage 
and proteinopathies, are also discussed.

INTRODUCTION: The mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles. The mitochondrial 
morphology and spatial distribution within the cell is determined by fusion and 
fission processes of mitochondria. Several studies have used mitochondrial 
division inhibitor-1 (Mdivi.1) to explore the roles of mitochondrial dynamics in 
various pathological conditions, including diabetic cardiomyopathy, myocardial 
infarction, cardiac hypertrophy, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease and 
cancers.
PURPOSE: The objective of the study was to investigate the role of mitochondrial 
dynamics in the invasiveness of HCT116 colorectal cancer cells.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: MTT assay was used to determine the Mdivi.1-induced 
toxicity in HCT116 cells. Wound healing, cell migration and colony forming 
assays were adopted to measure the migration and invasion activity of HCT116 
cells. Furthermore, flow cytometry was used to determine the Mdivi.1-induced 
mitochondrial mass quantification, mitochondrial membrane potential and reactive 
oxygen species generation in HCT116 cells. Additionally, Western Blot analysis 
was used to determine the expression level of Drp1, p-Drp1, Mnf2, AMPK-α, 
p-AMPK-α, Cox-2, iNos and MMP9 in HCT116 cells.
RESULTS: We found that Mdivi.1 induced toxicity and altered the morphology of 
HCT116 cells in concentration- and time-dependent manners. Mdivi.1 significantly 
increased mitochondrial mass and dissipated the mitochondrial membrane 
potential. Furthermore, Mdivi.1 induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation 
and mitochondrial superoxide production, leading to AMPK activation. Moreover, 
Mdivi.1 decreased dynamin-related protein-1 (Drp1) and phosphorylated-Drp1 
expression and increased mitofusin-2 (Mfn2) expression in a 
concentration-dependent manner at 48 and 72 h post-treatment. Notably, Mdivi.1 
induced inhibition of translocation of Drp1 from the cytosol to the outer 
mitochondrial membrane. Mdivi.1 significantly suppressed the invasion and 
migration of HCT116 cells and inhibited the formation of HCT116 cell colonies. 
In addition, Mdivi.1 significantly decreased the expression of metastatic 
markers including Cox-2, iNos, and MMP-9 in HCT116 cells.
CONCLUSION: Collectively, this study revealed that Mdivi.1 downregulates Drp1, 
upregulates Mfn2, and increases mitochondrial mass with attenuated oxidative 
metabolism, leading to the inhibition of cell invasion and metastasis in 
colorectal cancer HCT116 cells. Mitochondrial dynamics are regarded as possible 
drug targets for interrupting colorectal cancer cell migration and metastasis.

Plain Language Summary: The mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles. This 
study aimed to investigate the role of a mitochondrial fission inhibitor 
(Mdivi.1) on the viability, migration, and invasion of colorectal cancer cells 
(HCT116 cells), as well as the underlying mechanisms. We found that Mdivi.1 
inhibited cell viability and migration via mechanisms linked to changes in 
mitochondrial dynamics, reactive oxygen species generation, and the 
downregulation of metastatic markers. This study highlighted the role of altered 
mitochondrial dynamics as a potential therapeutic approach for colorectal cancer 
treatment.

Sciences Isfahan, Iran.

Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Lewy body 
dementia, are associated with the accumulation of brain proteins, leading to 
neuroinflammation, disruption of cellular clearance mechanisms, and neuronal 
death. Nuclear medicine, utilizing technologies like PET and SPECT, plays a 
crucial role in diagnosing and managing these disorders. Recent advancements in 
nuclear medicine have enhanced the understanding of disease pathophysiology and 
facilitated the development of tailored therapeutics. This study aims to address 
gaps in understanding nuclear medicine's potential to improve early diagnosis, 
monitor disease progression, and evaluate therapeutic effectiveness. In this 
review, we analyzed 28 papers and summarized their findings. PET radioligands 
have revolutionized the in vivo measurement of pathological targets in 
neurological diseases, offering new insights into the pathophysiology of 
neurodegenerative conditions. Amyloid PET has emerged as a reliable diagnostic 
imaging tool, accurately identifying cerebral amyloid-beta accumulation and 
enabling early differential diagnosis in clinical settings. Furthermore, 
radiopharmaceuticals such as [18F]Flortaucipir, [18F]FDOPA, and TSPO ligands 
provide significant advancements in the diagnosis and treatment of 
neurodegenerative disorders.

BACKGROUND: The intestinal flora (IF) has been linked to risks of 
non-communicable diseases, especially various cancers, stroke, and Alzheimer's 
disease. However, many uncertainties of these associations during different 
stages of growth, development, and aging still exist. Therefore, further 
in-depth explorations are warranted.
AIM: To explore the associations of the human IF with disease risks during 
different stages of growth, development, and aging to achieve more accurate and 
convincing conclusions.
METHODS: Cohort, cross-sectional, case-control, and Mendelian randomization 
studies published in the PubMed and Web of Science databases until December 31, 
2023 were systematically reviewed to clarify the associations of the IF at the 
genus level with the risks of various non-communicable diseases, which were 
grouped in accordance with the 10th revision of the International Classification 
of Diseases.
RESULTS: In total, 57 studies were included to quantitatively examine the 
influence of the IF on the risks of 30 non-communicable diseases during 
different stages of growth, development, and aging. Population studies and 
Mendelian randomization studies confirmed positive associations of the 
abundances of Bifidobacterium and Ruminococcus with multiple sclerosis.
CONCLUSION: These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the roles of 
the IF and provide novel evidence for effective strategies for the prevention 
and treatment of non-communicable diseases. In the future, it will be necessary 
to explore a greater variety of research techniques to uncover the specific 
mechanisms by which gut microbiota trigger diseases and conduct in-depth studies 
on the temporal relationship between microbiota alterations and diseases, so as 
to clarify the causal relationship more accurately.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by 
dementia and cognitive decline, associated with synaptic loss and degeneration 
of cholinergic neurons. New multitarget inhibitors for monoamine oxidase (MAO) 
and cholinesterase (ChE) enzymes are emerging as a potential treatment strategy 
for AD. Herein, we synthesized a series of N-benzyl-substituted biaryl 
phthalimide derivatives (3a-3m) encompassing potentially therapeutically active 
arenes/heteroarenes to serve as multitarget compounds for treating AD. To 
improve their binding affinity as well as inhibitory activity against ChE and 
MAO target proteins, comparable molecular structures were synthesized bearing 
electron-donating, electron-withdrawing, heterocyclic, and fluorinated moieties 
for a comprehensive SAR. In vitro evaluation of synthesized compounds against 
cholinesterases (AChE/BChE) and monoamine oxidases (MAO-A/MAO-B) revealed that 
compound 3e had good potency against AChE (IC50 = 0.24 μM) and BChE (IC50 = 6.29 
μM), while compound 3f had the highest inhibition of MAO-B (IC50 = 0.09 μM). 
Selected compounds (3e,f) showed no cytotoxicity against the neuroblastoma cell 
line (SH-SY5Y) and normal human embryonic HEK-293 cells. Moreover, they showed 
high blood-brain barrier penetration (PAMPA assay) and reversible MAO-B 
inhibitory activity (ex vivo). In molecular docking studies, compounds 3e and 3f 
displayed the highest binding affinity with ChEs and MAO-B, respectively. In 
silico ADMET studies and MD simulation studies were also carried out for the 
most potent derivatives (3e and 3f), suggesting their strong potential as 
anti-Alzheimer agents.

Abnormal lipid metabolism in microglia leads to the formation of pathological 
lipid droplets (LDs), a phenomenon also observed in neurodegenerative diseases 
such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). The abnormal accumulation of LDs disrupts 
normal cellular function and exacerbates the pathological process of AD. ATP11B 
is a P4-ATPase and the expression of Atp11b changes in the brain of patients 
with AD and diseases of lipid metabolism. The present study aimed to explore the 
regulatory role of ATP11B in microglial lipid metabolism and assess the 
potential of ATP11B as a therapeutic target for AD. Atp11b deficiency caused 
excessive fatty acid uptake and activated the PPAR signaling pathway, resulting 
in abnormal synthesis of neutral lipids and mitochondrial energy metabolism in 
microglia. Further results showed that Atp11b deficiency led to the accumulation 
of pathological LDs in microglia and AD mice. Conversely, overexpression of 
Atp11b alleviated exploratory behavior impairment, learning and memory 
impairment, LD accumulation, beta-amyloid (Aβ) deposition, and inflammatory 
response in the brain of AD mice. These findings provide important clues for a 
better understanding of the pathogenesis of AD and for developing novel 
therapeutic strategies.

The incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the concurrent cost of healthcare 
will increase as the population continues to age. Pharmaceutical interventions 
effectively manage symptoms of AD but carry side effects and ineffectively 
address underlying causes and disease prevention. Non-pharmaceutical 
interventions for AD, such as music training and therapy do not carry these side 
effects and can improve symptoms, and should therefore be explored as 
stand-alone or co-therapy for AD. In addition, music encapsulates modifiable 
lifestyle factors, such as cognitive stimulation, that have been shown to delay 
progression of and prevent AD. However, the neural mechanisms underpinning how 
music improves AD symptoms are not fully understood and whether music can target 
compensatory processes, activate neural networks, or even slow or prevent AD 
needs further research. Research suggests neural mechanism may involve 
stimulating brain areas to promote neurogenesis, dopaminergic rewards systems, 
and the default mode network (DMN). Alternatively, this review proposes that 
music improve symptoms of AD via the fronto-parietal control network (FPCN), the 
salience network (SN) and DMN, and neural compensation. This review will then 
present evidence for how music could activate the FPCN, SN, and DMN to improve 
their efficiency, organization, and cognitive functions they govern, protecting 
the brain from damage, slowing progression, and possibly preventing AD. 
Establishing how music improves symptoms of AD can lead to tailored music 
therapy protocols that target functional neural networks responsible for 
impaired executive functions common in AD.

BackgroundRepetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an efficient 
intervention for alleviating cognitive symptoms in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but 
the optimal treatment duration for high efficacy remains unclear.ObjectiveThis 
study investigates the effects of 2-week and 4-week rTMS on neural network 
plasticity and cognitive improvement, aiming to identify the optimal treatment 
duration for cognitive impairment.MethodsrTMS was administered to cognitively 
impaired patients over 2-week and 4-week periods, exploring its effects on 
cognitive improvement and induced neural circuits. The study also examines the 
predictive value of these neural circuits for individual treatment 
responses.ResultsThe 4-week rTMS treatment significantly outperformed the 2-week 
course in improving cognitive function. Neural activity analysis identified the 
precuneus as a key region for episodic memory. Changes in brain regions, 
particularly within the default mode network (DMN), visual network (VN), and 
motor network (MN), were associated with cognitive improvements. Baseline 
functional connectivity in these regions predicted changes in general cognition 
(r = 0.724, p < 0.001) and episodic memory (r = 0.447, p = 0.022) after 
rTMS.ConclusionsExtended rTMS treatment enhances cognitive performance in 
cognitive impairment patients, with the 4-week course showing superior effects. 
Reduced connectivity in the DMN following rTMS was linked to cognitive 
improvements. The neural network baseline can predict patients' treatment 
responses.

ObjectiveThis study examines the longitudinal relationship between subjective 
memory problems (SMPs) and timed instrumental activity of daily living (IADL) 
performance while considering the effects of depressive symptoms and the 
moderating role of the social determinants of health (SDHs).MethodsData from 
2622 older adults in the Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital 
Elderly (ACTIVE) randomized control trial were analyzed longitudinally, spanning 
up to 10 years. SMPs and timed IADL performance were assessed at each wave. The 
SDHs were captured using validated factors incorporating US Census data and 
person-level data from the ACTIVE Study. Multilevel mixed models examined 
associations, adjusting for demographics and the effects of depressive 
symptoms.ResultsMore SMPs at baseline were associated with slower timed IADL 
performance which rapidly became slower over time. Those older adults who 
experienced SMPs as they aged also experienced declines in timed IADL. These 
associations were influenced by socially determined health outcomes such as 
neighborhood and built environment, healthcare access and quality, and social 
and community context. Living in a better neighborhood and built environment and 
having access to quality healthcare weakened relationships over time between 
baseline SMPs and slower timed IADL performance. Better healthcare access and 
quality weakened the association of increases in SMPs with the slowing of timed 
IADL. Contrary to our prediction, living in a better social and community 
context, which fostered social engagement and decreased social isolation, 
strengthened relationships over time between baseline SMPs and slower timed IADL 
performance as well as the association of increases in SMPs with slower timed 
IADL performance over time.DiscussionMore SMPs at baseline were significantly 
related to slower rates of timed IADL performance over time, especially in older 
adults living in worse neighborhoods and built environments as well as areas 
with better social and community contexts. Increases in SMPs as one aged were 
also related to the slowing of timed IADL performance, especially in older 
adults living in areas with worse healthcare access and quality. Finally, our 
study found that higher scores on SMPs were related to slower timed IADL 
performance-independent of major confounds such as depressive symptoms.

Treatment with anti-amyloid-β monoclonal antibodies slowed cognitive decline in 
recent RCTs in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early dementia 
due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, stringent trial eligibility criteria 
may affect generalisability to clinical practice. We extracted eligibility 
criteria for trials of aducanumab, lecanemab and donanemab, and applied these to 
participants with MCI and early clinical AD dementia from the population-based 
Rotterdam Study. Participants underwent questionnaires, genotyping, brain-MRI, 
cognitive testing, and cardiovascular assessment. We determined amyloid status 
using a validated prediction model based on age and APOE-genotype. Of 968 
participants (mean age: 75 years, 56% women), 779 had MCI and 189 dementia. 
Across trials, around 40% of participants would be ineligible because of 
predicted amyloid negativity. At least one clinical exclusion criterion was 
present in 76.3% of participants for aducanumab, 75.8% for lecanemab, and 59.8% 
for donanemab. Common criteria were cardiovascular disease (35.2%), 
anticoagulant (31.2%), psychotropic or immunological medication use (20.4%), 
anxiety or depression (15.9%), or lack of social support (15.6%). One-third were 
ineligible based on brain-MRI findings alone, similar across trials and 
predominantly due to cerebral small-vessel disease. Combining amyloid, clinical, 
and imaging criteria, eligibility ranged from 9% (95% CI:7.0-11.1) for 
aducanumab, 8% (6.2-9.9) lecanemab to 15% (12.4-17.5) for donanemab. Findings 
from recent RCTs reporting protective effects of monoclonal antibodies against 
amyloid-β are applicable to less than 15% of community-dwelling individuals with 
MCI or early AD. These findings underline that evidence for drug efficacy and 
safety is lacking for the vast majority of patients with MCI/AD in routine 
clinical practice.

TREM2, a microglia-specific receptor, is strongly associated with Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) risk, mediating microglial responses to amyloid pathology critical 
to AD development. However, its role in tau pathology and neurodegeneration 
remains unclear. Using the PS19 tauopathy mouse model with inducible 
overexpression of human wild-type TREM2 (TREM2-WT) or the R47H variant 
(TREM2-R47H), we show that increasing TREM2-WT expression modestly reduces 
soluble phosphorylated tau levels and mildly preserves neuronal integrity. 
Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that TREM2-WT robustly enhances microglial 
activation, characterized by a disease-associated microglia (DAM) signature. In 
contrast, TREM2-R47H overexpression exhibits a loss-of-function phenotype, with 
no significant impact on tau levels, neurodegeneration, or microglial 
activation. These findings highlight the role of TREM2 in modulating microglial 
activity and its influence on tau pathology and neurodegeneration, providing 
important insights for the future development of therapies targeting TREM2 or 
microglial pathways in AD or other tauopathies.

The glial control of energy homeostasis is of crucial importance for health and 
disease. Astrocytes in particular play a major role in controlling the 
equilibrium among adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP), adenosine 5'-diphosphate 
(ADP), adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP), and adenosine. Any energy crisis leads 
to a drop in ATP, and the resulting increase in adenosine is an evolutionary 
ancient mechanism to suppress energy-consuming activities. The maintenance of 
brain energy homeostasis, in turn, requires the availability of energy sources, 
such as glucose and ketones. Astrocytes have assumed an important role in 
enabling efficient energy utilization by neurons. In addition, neurons are under 
the metabolic control of astrocytes through regulation of glutamate and GABA 
levels. The intricate interplay between glial brain energy metabolism and brain 
function can be best understood once the homeostatic system of energy metabolism 
is brought out of control. This has best been studied within the context of 
epilepsy where metabolic treatments provide unprecedented opportunities for the 
control of seizures that are refractory to conventional antiseizure medications. 
This chapter will discuss astroglial energy metabolism in the healthy brain and 
will use epilepsy as a model condition in which glial brain energy homeostasis 
is disrupted. We will conclude with an outlook on how those principles can be 
applied to other conditions such as Alzheimer disease.

Alzheimer's disease is the most widespread neurodegenerative disease 
characterized by insidious onset and slow progression. At present, most 
available medications serve to attenuate the progression of Alzheimer's disease 
with side effects and drug resistance. Neochlorogenic acid is a natural 
polyphenolic compound with excellent antioxidant properties. Based on zebrafish 
Alzheimer's disease model induced by AlCl3, we found that neochlorogenic acid 
significantly improved motor dysfunction, reduced brain cell apoptosis, and Aβ 
plaque. Because of antioxidant stress and improvement of blood-brain barrier 
dysfunction are important in treating Alzheimer's disease, we explored the 
interaction between these two mechanisms in alleviating the pathological course 
of Alzheimer's disease. Neochlorogenic acid inhibited the overproduction of 
reactive oxygen species, suppressed the gene expression encoding 
antioxidant-related proteins, and protected brain cell integrity while enhancing 
Nrf2, improving blood-brain barrier nerve resilience. Meanwhile, neochlorogenic 
acid attenuated blood-brain barrier dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease zebrafish 
by reducing blood hemoglobin leakage and upregulating the gene expression 
encoding blood-brain barrier endothelial cell-related proteins, resulting in 
reactive oxygen species in a controllable state. In conclusion, our research 
suggests that neochlorogenic acid ameliorates Alzheimer's disease-like pathology 
by inhibiting oxidative stress and restoring blood-brain barrier function, 
indicating that neochlorogenic acid may be a potential drug for treating 
Alzheimer's disease.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder that 
leads to progressive cognitive decline and imposes a significant socio-economic 
burden. Traditional diagnostic methods, primarily based on amyloid-beta (Aβ) and 
tau biomarkers, often identify the disease at late stages, highlighting the need 
for more sensitive and accessible early detection tools. This review explores 
emerging non-traditional biomarkers, including salivary, lipid, urinary, 
synaptic, blood-based, microRNA (miRNA), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), fecal, and 
inflammatory markers, which provide deeper insights into AD pathophysiology. 
These biomarkers reflect key pathological processes such as neuroinflammation, 
mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, synaptic damage, lipid 
dysregulation, and genetic factors. Non-invasive biomarkers, such as those found 
in saliva and urine, present promising avenues for large-scale screening, while 
advanced blood-based markers like neurofilament light chain (NfL) and glial 
fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) offer precise monitoring of neurodegeneration 
and inflammation. Additionally, miRNAs and lipid biomarkers shed light on 
molecular alterations in neuronal health and signaling. Integrating these 
biomarkers with imaging techniques, proteomics, and genetic profiling enhances 
diagnostic accuracy and enables personalized treatment approaches. This shift 
toward multi-dimensional biomarker assessment not only improves early detection 
but also aids in tailoring therapeutic strategies to individual disease 
profiles. By reviewing recent advancements, this article highlights the 
transformative potential of emerging biomarkers in overcoming the limitations of 
conventional diagnostics. Standardization and validation across diverse 
populations will be crucial in expanding their clinical applicability, 
ultimately improving disease management, reducing societal burden, and enhancing 
the quality of life for individuals affected by AD.

Mitochondria, as central regulators of cellular processes such as energy 
production, apoptosis, and metabolic homeostasis, are essential to cellular 
function and health. The maintenance of mitochondrial integrity, especially 
through mitophagy-the selective removal of impaired mitochondria-is crucial for 
cellular homeostasis. Dysregulation of mitochondrial function, dynamics, and 
biogenesis is linked to neurodegenerative and metabolic diseases, notably 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is increasingly recognized as a metabolic 
disorder due to its shared pathophysiologic features: insulin resistance, 
oxidative stress, and chronic inflammation. In this review, we highlight recent 
advancements in pharmacological interventions, focusing on agents that modulate 
mitophagy, mitochondrial uncouplers that reduce oxidative phosphorylation, 
compounds that directly scavenge reactive oxygen species to alleviate oxidative 
stress, and molecules that ameliorate amyloid beta plaque accumulation and 
phosphorylated tau pathology. Additionally, we explore dietary and lifestyle 
interventions-MIND and ketogenic diets, caloric restriction, physical activity, 
hormone modulation, and stress management-that complement pharmacological 
approaches and support mitochondrial health. Our review underscores 
mitochondria's central role in the pathogenesis and potential treatment of 
neurodegenerative and metabolic diseases, particularly AD. By advocating for an 
integrated therapeutic model that combines pharmacological and lifestyle 
interventions, we propose a comprehensive approach aimed at mitigating 
mitochondrial dysfunction and improving clinical outcomes in these complex, 
interrelated diseases.

Neurodegenerative disorders include Parkinson's disease, spinal cord injury, 
multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease, cause gradual neuronal loss, protein 
misfolding, and accumulation, resulting in severe cognitive and movement 
deficits. Despite substantial study, therapeutic interventions are hampered by 
the blood-brain barrier, which prevents medication distribution to the central 
nervous system. Traditional pharmaceutical methods, such as small compounds, 
peptides, and inhibitors, have shown minimal effectiveness in addressing this 
obstacle. Exosomes are nanoscale membrane-bound vesicles that are primarily 
engaged in intercellular communication. They have the inherent capacity to cross 
the blood-brain barrier, which allows them to be used as medication delivery 
vehicles for brain illness therapy. Exosomes may be derived from a variety of 
cells like microglia, astrocytes identified according to origin, increasing 
their flexibility as drug delivery vehicles. Advanced engineering approaches 
optimise exosomes for tailored distribution across the blood-brain barrier, 
paving the path for novel neurodegenerative disease treatments. This review 
discusses the promise of exosome-based drug delivery, focussing on their 
composition, biogenesis, engineering, and applications in treating central 
nervous system illnesses, eventually overcoming the unmet hurdles of crossing 
the blood-brain barrier.

Neuroinflammation is implicated in nearly all pathological processes of central 
nervous system (CNS) diseases. However, no medications specifically targeting 
neuroinflammation are clinically available, and conventional anti-inflammatory 
drugs exhibit limited efficacy. Here, we identified cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) 
as a novel therapeutic target in neuroinflammation. Elevated CYP2E1 levels were 
observed in hippocampal tissues of mouse and rat neuroinflammation models, as 
well as in LPS-stimulated primary microglia. Genetic ablation of Cyp2e1 improved 
spatial learning and memory in neuroinflammatory rats and reduced 
pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in Cyp2e1-deficient microglia. Furthermore, Q11 
(1-(4-methyl-5-thiazolyl) ethanone), a novel CYP2E1 inhibitor developed and 
synthesized in our laboratory, effectively ameliorated Alzheimer's 
disease-related spatial learning and memory functions and depression-related 
anxiety-like behaviors in mice/rats. Mechanistically, Q11 attenuated microglial 
activation, neuronal damage, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation by 
suppressing the PI3K/Akt, STAT1/3, and NF-κB signaling pathways. These findings 
establish CYP2E1 as a druggable target for neuroinflammation and propose Q11 as 
a promising candidate for treating neuroinflammation-related diseases.

OBJECTIVES: Intrinsic capacity (IC), the composite of all the physical and 
mental capacities of an individual, has never been studied in patients with 
dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). As IC decline is associated with the risk of 
frailty, functional decline and disability and is potentially reversible after 
targeted interventions, a monitoring and specific management of IC decline in 
patients with DLB could promote healthy aging in this population. The aim of 
this cross-sectional study was to describe the frequency of IC decline in DLB 
and to compare it with AD.
DESIGN: A single-center cross-sectional study.
SETTING: This study was carried out in a memory clinic between 2015 and 2023 
based on the MEMORA cohort.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients with a diagnosis of AD or probable DLB and a 
comprehensive geriatric assessment.
MEASUREMENTS: IC was assessed according to the WHO model in 4 domains: vitality 
assessed by the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA), locomotion assessed by the 
Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), psychology assessed by the Geriatric 
Depression Scale 4-items (GDS-4 items), and hearing assessed by the Hearing, 
Vision, Equilibrium and Cognition (HVEC) scale.
RESULTS: A total of 798 patients (154 with probable DLB and 644 with AD) were 
included, and the mean age was 81.4 years (SD 6.33). Compared with AD patients, 
DLB patients had significantly more impaired IC in all domains, with greater 
risks of impaired vitality (odds ratio (OR) 2.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 
1.60-3.72), locomotion (OR 3.50, 95% CI 2.15-5.90), psychology (OR 2.60, 95% CI 
1.73-3.92) and hearing (OR 2.30, 95% CI 1.53-3.49), according to the adjusted 
models. Similarly, when IC domains were considered linear variables, IC across 
all domains was significantly lower in the DLB group than in the AD group.
CONCLUSION: This study revealed that DLB patients presented a greater decrease 
in IC than did AD patients across all domains. In memory clinics, DLB patients 
could be offered systematic and early IC monitoring and personalized 
interventions.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe neurodegenerative disorder characterized by 
abnormal metabolism of β-amyloid (Aβ) precursor proteins and neuronal apoptosis, 
ultimately leading to cognitive dysfunction. The pathogenesis of AD is complex, 
and current single-target therapies are not effective in preventing the rapid 
progression of AD, which highlights the urgent need for developing multi-target 
drugs. In this study, a series of compounds were synthesized through a 
multi-targeting ligand strategy. After extensive screening and evaluation, we 
found a lead compound B14, which showed excellent dual targeting ability for 
effectively alleviating neuronal apoptosis and oxidative stress damage of AD. In 
our molecular and cellular level experiments, B14 could target and stabilize the 
i-motif structure formed on the BCL-2 promoter to upregulate BCL-2 expression, 
which could also bind to Aβ and inhibit its deposition. In the Aβ1-42-induced 
cell model, B14 could maintain mitochondrial function and number, regulate 
intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Ca2+ metabolism disorders, and 
effectively reduce Aβ1-42-induced apoptosis. Further studies showed that B14 
also exhibited good ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which 
significantly improved learning memory and cognitive deficits, reduced brain Aβ 
plaques, alleviated inflammation and restored oxidative stress markers in 
APP/PS1 mice. Our findings provide an innovative strategy of dual targeting 
BCL-2 promoter i-motif for transcriptional regulation and Aβ aggregation 
synergistically for mitigating AD pathologies. B14 represents a promising 
multi-target lead compound with a good potential for further development for AD 
treatment.

Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs) are the sole source of cholinergic 
innervation to the cerebral cortex and hippocampus in humans and the primary 
source in rodents. This system undergoes early degeneration in Alzheimer's 
disease. BFCNs terminal synapses are involved in the regulation of the cerebral 
blood flow by making classical synaptic contacts with other neurons. 
Additionally, they are located in proximity to cortical cerebral blood vessels, 
forming connections with various cell types of the neurovascular unit (NVU), 
including vascular smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, and astrocytic 
end-feet. However, the effects of the BFCNs input on NVU components remain 
unresolved. To address this issue, we immunolesioned the nucleus basalis by 
administering bilateral stereotaxic injections of the cholinergic immunotoxin 
192-IgG-Saporin in 2.5-month-old Wistar rats. Seven months post-lesion, we 
observed a significant reduction in cortical vesicular acetylcholine 
transporter-immunoreactive synapses. This was accompanied by changes in the 
diameter of cortical capillaries and precapillary arterioles, as well as lower 
levels of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). Additionally, the 
cholinergic immunolesion increased the density of cortical astrocytes and 
microglia in the cortex. At these post-BFCN-lesion stages, astrocytic end-feet 
exhibited an increased co-localization with arterioles. The number of microglia 
in the parietal cortex correlated with cholinergic loss and exhibited 
morphological changes indicative of an intermediate activation state. This was 
supported by decreased levels of proinflammatory mediators IFN-γ, IL-1β, and 
KC/GRO (CXCL1), and by increased expression of M2 markers SOCS3, IL4Rα, YM1, 
ARG1, and Fizz1. Our findings offer a novel insight: that the loss of nucleus 
basalis cholinergic input negatively impacts cortical blood vessels, NVU 
components, and microglia phenotype.

Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD), a collection of 
neurodegenerative conditions, take a heavy physical, emotional, and financial 
toll on individuals, families, and communities. Developing effective strategies 
for preventing and treating these conditions, which impact millions of people in 
the United States, is one of the most pressing needs in biomedical research 
today. The National Institutes of Health has invested billions of dollars in 
this research, which has led to numerous scientific advances over the last 
decade. However, the pace of progress has not kept up with the growing needs of 
people living with AD/ADRD and those at risk. Consequently, the National 
Institute on Aging and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and 
Stroke asked the National Academies to convene an expert committee to examine 
and assess the current state of biomedical research and recommend research 
priorities to advance the prevention and treatment of AD/ADRD. Preventing and 
Treating Dementia outlines these research priorities and recommends strategies 
to overcome barriers to progress.

Microglial diversity arises from the interplay between inherent genetic programs 
and external environmental signals. However, the mechanisms by which these 
processes develop and interact within the growing brain are not yet fully 
understood. Here, we show that radial glia-expressed integrin beta 8 (ITGB8) 
activates microglia-expressed TGFβ1 to drive microglial development. 
Domain-restricted deletion of Itgb8 in these progenitors results in regionally 
restricted and developmentally arrested microglia that persist into adulthood. 
In the absence of autocrine TGFβ1 signaling, microglia adopt a similar 
phenotype, leading to neuromotor symptoms almost identical to Itgb8 mutant mice. 
In contrast, microglia lacking the canonical TGFβ signal transducers Smad2 and 
Smad3 have a less polarized dysmature phenotype and correspondingly less severe 
neuromotor dysfunction. Our study describes the spatio-temporal regulation of 
TGFβ activation and signaling in the brain necessary to promote microglial 
development, and provides evidence for the adoption of microglial developmental 
signaling pathways in brain injury or disease.

Central Nervous System (CNS) diseases significantly affect human health. 
However, replicating the onset, progression, and pathology of these diseases in 
rodents is challenging. To address this issue, researchers have developed 
humanized animal models. These models introduce human genes or cells into 
rodents. As a result, rodents become more suitable for studying human CNS 
diseases and their therapies in vivo. This review explores the preparation 
protocols, pathological and behavioral characteristics, benefits, significance, 
and limitations of humanized rodent models in researching various CNS diseases, 
particularly Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, 
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, glial cells-related CNS diseases, 
N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor encephalitis, and others. Humanized rodent 
models have expanded the opportunities for in vivo exploration of human 
neurodegenerative diseases, other brain disorders, and their treatments. We can 
enhance translational research on CNS disorders by developing, investigating, 
and utilizing these models.

Gut microbiota preservation or rational manipulation is a key condition for 
healthy longevity and a promising strategy to prevent neurodegenerations 
exploiting the gut-brain axis, with a key role of prebiotics and probiotics. 
Whether their combination in a functional food can provide a synergistic effect 
to the host remains controversial. To fill this gap, we supplemented the diet of 
3xTg-AD Alzheimer's disease mice with a red lentils (prebiotic)-based cookie 
enriched with neuroprotective probiotics and we performed behavioural, 
biochemical and molecular tests. Chronic consumption of this synbiotic 
preparation (functional cookie) preserved cognition, reduced amyloid load, 
improved glucose and lipid homeostasis and diminished oxidation and inflammation 
related damages compared to animals receiving a classic cookie (standard 
recipe). The synergistic effect was indicated by significantly higher glucose 
insulinotropic polypeptide concentrations in the functional cookie group 
compared to probiotic group. Moreover, Ruminoclostridium sp KB18 and 
Ruminicoccus decreased in the gut of mice supplemented with the functional 
cookie, partially explaining the improved short-term memory upon treatments and 
substantiating the combined use over individual components. This synbiotic 
innovative snack represents a prototype of a simple and affordable dietary 
approach to promote healthy aging and prevent or delay the onset of 
neurodegenerations.

Microglia and astrocytes are central to the pathogenesis and progression of 
Alzheimer's Disease (AD), working both independently and collaboratively to 
regulate key pathological processes such as β-amyloid protein (Aβ) deposition, 
tau aggregation, neuroinflammation, and synapse loss. These glial cells interact 
through complex molecular pathways, including IL-3/IL-3Ra and C3/C3aR, which 
influence disease progression and cognitive decline. Emerging research suggests 
that modulating these pathways could offer therapeutic benefits. For instance, 
recombinant IL-3 administration in mice reduced Aβ plaques and improved 
cognitive functions, while C3aR inhibition alleviated Aβ and tau pathologies, 
restored synaptic function, and corrected immune dysregulation. However, the 
effects of these interactions are context-dependent. Acute C3/C3aR activation 
enhances microglial Aβ clearance, whereas chronic activation impairs it, 
highlighting the dual roles of glial signaling in AD. Furthermore, C3/C3aR 
signaling not only impacts Aβ clearance but also modulates tau pathology and 
synaptic integrity. Given AD's multifactorial nature, understanding the specific 
pathological environment is crucial when investigating glial cell contributions. 
The interplay between microglia and astrocytes can be both neuroprotective and 
neurotoxic, depending on the disease stage and brain region. This complexity 
underscores the need for targeted therapies that modulate glial cell activity in 
a context-specific manner. By elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying 
microglia-astrocyte interactions, this research advances our understanding of AD 
and paves the way for novel therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating 
neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in AD and related disorders.

Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), characterized by progressive neuronal 
degeneration and manifesting in diverse forms such as memory loss and movement 
disorders, pose significant challenges due to their complex molecular mechanisms 
and heterogeneous patient presentations. Diagnosis often relies heavily on 
clinical assessments and neuroimaging, with definitive confirmation frequently 
requiring post-mortem autopsy. However, the emergence of Artificial Intelligence 
(AI) and Machine Learning (ML) offers a transformative potential. These 
technologies can enable the development of non-invasive tools for early 
diagnosis, biomarker identification, personalized treatment strategies, patient 
subtyping and stratification, and disease risk prediction. This review aims to 
provide a starting point for researchers, both with and without clinical 
backgrounds, who are interested in applying ML to NDs. We will discuss available 
data resources for key diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, explore how ML 
can revolutionize neurodegenerative care, and emphasize the importance of 
integrating multiple high-dimensional data sources to gain deeper insights and 
inform effective therapeutic strategies.

Exosomes are a subject of continuous investigation due to their function as 
extracellular vesicles (EVs) that significantly contribute to the 
pathophysiology of certain neurodegenerative disorders (NDD), including 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Exosomes have shown the potential to carry both 
therapeutic and pathogenic materials; hence, researchers have used exosomes for 
medication delivery applications. Exosomes have reduced immunogenicity when used 
as natural drug delivery vehicles. This guarantees the efficient delivery of the 
medication without causing significant side reactions. Exosomes have lately 
enabled the potential for drug delivery in AD, along with promising future 
therapeutic uses for the detection of neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, 
exosomes have been examined for their prospective use in illness diagnosis and 
prediction before the manifestation of symptoms. This review will document prior 
studies and will concentrate on the rationale behind the substantial potential 
of exosomes in the treatment of AD and their prospective use as a diagnostic and 
predictive tool for this condition.

Neurodegenerative diseases (NDD) are characterized by the progressive loss of 
neurons and the impairment of cellular functions. Messenger RNA (mRNA) has 
emerged as a promising therapy for treating NDD, as it can encode missing or 
dysfunctional proteins and anti-inflammatory cytokines or neuroprotective 
proteins to halt the progression of these diseases. However, effective mRNA 
delivery to the central nervous system (CNS) remains a significant challenge due 
to the limited penetration of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Lipid nanoparticles 
(LNPs) offer an efficient solution by encapsulating and protecting mRNA, 
facilitating transfection and intracellular delivery. This review discusses the 
pathophysiological mechanisms of neurological disorders, including Parkinson's 
disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), multiple sclerosis (MS), Huntington's 
disease (HD), ischemic stroke, spinal cord injury, and Friedreich's ataxia. 
Additionally, it explores the potential of LNP-mediated mRNA delivery as a 
therapeutic strategy for these diseases. Various approaches to overcoming 
BBB-related challenges and enhancing the delivery and efficacy of mRNA-LNPs are 
discussed, including non-invasive methods with strong potential for clinical 
translation. With advancements in artificial intelligence (AI)-guided mRNA and 
LNP design, targeted delivery, gene editing, and CAR-T cell therapy, mRNA-LNPs 
could significantly transform the treatment landscape for NDD, paving the way 
for future clinical applications.

BACKGROUND: Amyloid plaque removal by monoclonal antibody therapies slows 
clinical progression in symptomatic Alzheimer's disease; however, the potential 
for delaying the onset of clinical symptoms in asymptomatic people is unknown. 
The Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network Trials Unit (DIAN-TU) is an ongoing 
platform trial assessing the safety and efficacy of multiple investigational 
products in participants with dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease (DIAD). 
Based on findings of amyloid removal and downstream biological effects from the 
gantenerumab group of the platform trial, we continued a 3-year open-label 
extension (OLE) study to assess the safety and efficacy of long-term treatment 
with high doses of gantenerumab.
METHODS: The randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase 2/3 multi-arm 
trial (DIAN-TU-001) assessed solanezumab or gantenerumab versus placebo in 
participants who were between 15 years before and 10 years after their estimated 
years to symptom onset and who had a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) global score 
of 0 (cognitively normal) to 1 (mild dementia). This study was followed by an 
OLE study of gantenerumab treatment, conducted at 18 study sites in Australia, 
Canada, France, Ireland, Puerto Rico, Spain, the UK, and the USA. For inclusion 
in the OLE, participants at risk for DIAD had participated in the double-blind 
period of DIAN-TU-001 and were required to know their mutation status. We 
investigated increasing doses of subcutaneous gantenerumab up to 1500 mg every 2 
weeks. Due to the lack of a regulatory path for gantenerumab, the study was 
stopped early after a prespecified interim analysis (when most participants had 
completed 2 years of treatment) of the clinical measure CDR-Sum of Boxes 
(CDR-SB). The primary outcome for the final analysis was the amyloid plaque 
measure 11C-Pittsburgh compound-B positron emission tomography (PiB-PET) 
standardised uptake value ratio (SUVR [PiB-PET SUVR]) at 3 years, assessed in 
the modified intention-to-treat group (mITT; defined as participants who 
received any gantenerumab treatment post-OLE baseline, had at least one PiB-PET 
SUVR assessment before gantenerumab treatment, and a post-baseline assessment). 
All participants who received at least one dose of study drug in the OLE were 
included in the safety analysis. DIAN-TU-001 (NCT01760005) and the OLE 
(NCT06424236) are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov.
FINDINGS: Of 74 participants who were recruited into the OLE study between June 
3, 2020, and April 22, 2021, 73 were enrolled and received gantenerumab 
treatment. 47 (64%) stopped dosing due to early termination of the study by the 
sponsor, and 13 (18%) prematurely discontinued the study for other reasons; 13 
people completed 3 years of treatment. The mITT group for the primary analysis 
comprised 55 participants. At the interim analysis, the hazard ratio for 
clinical decline of CDR-SB in asymptomatic mutation carriers was 0·79 (n=53 [95% 
CI 0·47 to 1·32]) for participants who were treated with gantenerumab in either 
the double-blind or OLE period (Any Gant), and 0·53 (n=22 [0·27 to 1·03]) for 
participants who were treated with gantenerumab the longest (Longest Gant). At 
the final analysis, the adjusted mean change from OLE baseline to year 3 in 
PiB-PET SUVR was -0·71 SUVR (95% CI -0·88 to -0·53, p<0·0001). Amyloid-related 
imaging abnormalities occurred in 53% (39 of 73) of participants: 47% (34 of 73) 
with microhaemorrhages, 30% (22 of 73) with oedema, and 6% (five of 73) were 
associated with superficial siderosis. No treatment-associated macrohaemorrhages 
or deaths occurred.
INTERPRETATION: Partial or short-term amyloid removal did not show significant 
clinical effects. However, long-term full amyloid removal potentially delayed 
symptom onset and dementia progression. Our conclusions are limited due to the 
OLE design and use of external controls and need to be confirmed in long-term 
trials.

Long-term formaldehyde (FA) exposure causes cognitive dysfunction, often 
associated with metabolic disorders. While some studies suggest Ganoderma 
lucidum polysaccharides (GLP) can improve cognitive function, such as 
Alzheimer's disease. However, the effects of GLP on FA-exposed cognitive 
dysfunction and the regulation of GLP on brain metabolic disturbances caused by 
FA remain unclear. In our study, we revealed that GLP significantly reversed 
FA-exposed spatial cognitive deficits in mice by using Morris Water Maze and 
Histological analysis. Furthermore, desorption electrospray ionization mass 
spectrometry imaging (DESI-MSI) found that exposure of FA can caused 
dysregulated expression of 35 metabolites. Following GLP treatment, there was a 
significant restoration of the imbalance of choline and acetylcholine, carnitine 
and acetylcarnitine, and spermidine and spermine, which were all involved in 
choline metabolism, carnitine metabolism, and polyamine metabolism. Our results 
suggested that GLP alleviated FA-exposed cognitive dysfunction, likely through 
modulation of metabolic pathways, providing a potential therapeutic approach for 
FA-related cognitive dysfunction.

BACKGROUND: A reliable blood biomarker for neuroborreliosis (NB) has yet to be 
identified. This study investigated levels of neuron damage markers glial 
fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and brain-derived tau (BD-tau) over six months 
of follow-up in patients with NB. The aim was to evaluate the potential of these 
biomarkers for monitoring treatment response and prognostic purposes.
METHODS: A retrospective longitudinal cohort study including plasma collected at 
diagnosis and approximately three- and six-months post diagnosis from adult NB 
patients enrolled at the Department of Infectious Diseases, Rigshospitalet 
between 2018 and 2020. BD-tau concentrations were measured in-house using the 
Single Molecule Array (Simoa) HD-X platform, while GFAP concentrations were 
assessed on the same platform utilizing the GFAP Discovery Kit. Changes in 
biomarker concentrations were analyzed using linear mixed models with an 
unstructured covariance pattern, with follow-up included as a categorical fixed 
effect.
RESULTS: A total of 23 patients (median age: 63 years; male/female ratio: 16/7) 
with 56 plasma samples were analyzed; 12 patients had complete samples. GFAP and 
BD-tau levels showed minimal variation throughout the study period. Patients 
with persistent symptoms had GFAP concentrations that were 55 % higher at 
diagnosis compared to those who fully recovered, though this difference was not 
statistically significant (p = 0.09). No significant associations were observed 
between biomarker levels and treatment response or long-term outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: This longitudinal study did not find BD-tau or GFAP to be effective 
blood biomarkers for monitoring treatment response or predicting outcomes in NB.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia worldwide. Despite 
recent advances, more effective and safer treatment options for AD are needed. 
Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is one of the key pathological hallmarks of AD 
characterized by amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition in the cerebral vasculature and is 
associated with intracerebral hemorrhage, cerebrovascular dysfunction, and 
cognitive impairment. CAA is also considered to underlie the main adverse effect 
of recently FDA-approved anti-Aβ immunotherapies, namely the amyloid-related 
imaging abnormalities (ARIA). Substantial evidence has shown that elevated 
levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and its main protein component, APOA-I, 
are associated with reduced CAA and superior cognitive function. 4F is an 
APOA-I/HDL-mimetic peptide and its clinical safety and activity have been 
demonstrated in human trials for cardiovascular diseases. The present study 
investigates whether treatment with 4F modulates CAA and associated cognitive 
deficits and neuropathologies in the well-established Tg-SwDI mouse model of 
CAA/AD. Age/sex-matched Tg-SwDI mice received daily treatments of 4F or vehicle 
(PBS), respectively, by intraperitoneal injections for 12 weeks. The results 
showed that 4F treatment reduced overall Aβ plaque deposition and CAA, and 
attenuated CAA-associated microgliosis, without significantly affecting total 
levels of Aβ, astrocytosis, and behavioral function. Unbiased transcriptomic 
analysis revealed a heightened inflammatory state in the brain of SwDI mice and 
that 4F treatment reversed the overactivation of vascular cells, in particular 
vascular smooth muscle cells, relieving cerebrovascular inflammation in CAA/AD 
mice. Our study provides experimental evidence for the therapeutic potential of 
4F to mitigate CAA and associated pathologies in AD.

Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) is a critical element in vascular 
dementia (VD) pathogenesis and therapeutic development while remaining strongly 
influenced by aging processes and cellular aging mechanisms. VEGF's multiple 
effects comprise neuroprotective functions, its role in vascular development, 
and its ability to regulate brain blood flow systems, all leading to cognitive 
preservation. The prefrontal cortex exhibits elevated VEGF gene levels, which 
directly matches the advancement of cognitive deficits in patients with 
Alzheimer's disease and VD. These patients exhibit higher VEGF levels in their 
CSF fluid, demonstrating that disease pathology includes multiple inseparable 
factors. Aging dramatically worsens VEGF regulation because endothelial 
dysfunction combines with chronic inflammation and oxidative stress to generate 
adverse vascular symptoms that include atherosclerosis and stroke. Cellular 
senescence convolutes these processes by causing damaging inflammatory reactions 
alongside impaired vascular healing abilities. The secretion of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines from senescent cells (SCs) disrupts VEGF signaling and produces 
harmful consequences for both vascular health and cognitive well-being. The 
neuroprotective properties of VEGF-A165a and VEGF-A165b variants demonstrate 
their ability to lessen β-amyloid and tau protein toxicity. The protective 
mechanisms of VEGF depend heavily on VEGF expression levels and receptor 
functionality, both of which decrease with aging. The combination of approaches 
that modulate VEGF signaling and SC accumulation shows potential for designing 
treatments against VD. People can sustain BBB functionality over a longer period 
through Mediterranean diet consumption together with aerobic exercise along with 
developing therapies, including senolytics and senomorphics, which delay 
neurodegenerative progression. Future investigative efforts must improve VEGF 
delivery methods while studying cellular senescence mechanisms and developing 
advanced methods to detect SC cells. A three-dimensional healthcare approach 
combining VEGF-targeted treatments with anti-ageing interventions and detailed 
diagnostic techniques shows the potential for effective VD management to achieve 
better patient results.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by brain aggregates of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and Tau tangles. 
Despite extensive research, effective therapy for AD remains elusive. 
Polyoxometalates (POMs), a class of inorganic compounds with diverse chemical 
structures and properties, are emerging as potential candidates for AD treatment 
due to their ability to target key molecular players implicated in disease 
pathogenesis, such as Aβ, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyryl 
acetylcholinesterase (BChE). Here, we use molecular docking to predict the 
binding pose and affinities of POMs to 10 top targets associated with AD. First, 
we validate our method by replicating experimentally known binding of POMs to Aβ 
(ΔG = - 9.67 kcal/mol), AChE (ΔG = - 9.39 kcal/mol) and BChE (ΔG = - 10.86 
kcal/mol). Then, using this method, we show that POM can also bind β-secretase 1 
(BACE1, ΔG = - 10.14 kcal/mol), presenilin 1 (PSEN1, ΔG = - 10.65 kcal/mol), 
presenilin 2 (PSEN2, ΔG = - 7.94 kcal/mol), Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP, 
ΔG = - 7.26 kcal/mol), Apolipoprotein E (APOE4, ΔG = - 10.05 kcal/mol), 
Microtubule-Associated Protein Tau (MAPT, ΔG = - 5.28 kcal/mol) depending on 
phosphorylation, and α-synuclein (SNCA, ΔG = - 7.64 kcal/mol). Through such 
binding, POMs offer the potential to mitigate APP cleavage, Aβ oligomer 
neurotoxicity, Aβ aggregation, thereby attenuating disease progression. Overall, 
our molecular docking study represents a powerful tool in the discovery of 
POM-based therapeutics for AD, facilitating the development of novel treatments 
for AD.

BACKGROUND: Ambulatory care is critical in delivering interventions for dementia 
and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), from basic services to novel therapeutics. 
Yet, little is known regarding how community-dwelling persons with dementia/MCI 
interact with clinicians in outpatient ambulatory settings. We assessed 
associations of dementia/MCI with outpatient ambulatory evaluation and 
management (E&M) visits.
METHODS: We included 2116 community-dwelling participants in Rush Alzheimer's 
Disease Center cohorts, with linked fee-for-service Medicare claims. Annually 
from 2011 to 2019, cohort neuropsychologic evaluations classified participants 
as dementia, MCI, or no cognitive impairment (NCI). Across groups, we compared 
annual probability of visiting providers and number of E&M visits, using 
repeated measures logistic or generalized Poisson mixed effects models.
RESULTS: Across 8672 person-years (PY) of follow-up, the mean age was 82 (SD 
7.6) years; 77% of PYs were among females and 24% among Black participants. 
Controlling for demographics and comorbidity, the annual predicted probability 
of primary care visits was high in all groups (86%-92%). Although there were few 
visits with dementia-related specialists, we found a higher probability of these 
visits among those with dementia (15%) and MCI (17%) than NCI (12%; p = 0.009, 
dementia vs. NCI; p < 0.001, MCI vs. NCI). There were striking differences in 
visits to other medical specialties: the mean number of annual visits was 40% 
lower for those with dementia (p < 0.001) and 10% lower for MCI (p < 0.001) than 
NCI. Overall, dementia and MCI were associated with 19% (p < 0.001) and 4% 
(p = 0.005) fewer E&M visits, respectively, compared to NCI.
CONCLUSIONS: Older adults with dementia and MCI interact with primary care 
providers regularly and are more likely to use dementia-related specialists than 
those with NCI. Yet, we found lower utilization of other medical specialties, 
without compensatory increases in primary care, leading to fewer overall E&M 
visits, even in MCI. Together, the findings may suggest lost opportunities to 
address the scope of health issues in vulnerable groups.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease of the central 
nervous system caused by loss of neuronal or myelin function, accompanied by 
ferroptosis. Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.) Bge. (A. membranaceus) is one of 
China's homologous lists of medicines and food, and its active component 
saponins have neuroprotective effects. This study examines the mechanism of 
saponins from A. membranaceus (AS) in treating AD. UPLC-Q-TOF-MS analyzed the 
composition of AS. Ferroptosis models were established to evaluate the anti-AD 
efficacy. As a result, AS treatment inhibited ferroptosis in SAMP8 mice by 
restoring iron homeostasis and lipid peroxidation (LPO) balance in the brain, 
thereby improving cognitive impairment and pathological damage. Mechanistically, 
AS treatment reduced Fe2+, MDA, and ROS levels and enhanced protein levels of 
SLC7A11, GPX4, FTH1, and FPN1. NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) overexpression revealed 
that AS treatment inhibited NOX4, thereby reducing NOX4 stability and regulating 
the NOX4/Nrf2 pathway in erastin-injured HT22 cells and significantly 
alleviating ferroptosis. Therefore, AS inhibited ferroptosis and improved AD by 
rebuilding iron homeostasis and LPO balance in the brain. AS has the potential 
to be a promising candidate medicine for AD.

Spatial transcriptomics (ST) is revolutionizing our understanding of the central 
nervous system (CNS) by providing spatially resolved gene expression data. This 
mini review explores the impact of ST on CNS research, particularly in 
neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis, 
and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We describe two foundational ST methods: 
sequencing-based and imaging-based. Key studies are reviewed highlighting the 
power of ST data sets to map transcriptomes to disease-specific histomorphology, 
elucidate molecular mechanisms of regional and cellular vulnerability, integrate 
single-cell data with tissue mapping, and reveal receptor-ligand interactions. 
Despite current challenges like data interpretation and resolution limits, ST 
holds promise for identifying novel drug targets, evaluating their therapeutic 
potential, and bridging gaps between animal models and human studies to advance 
development of CNS-targeting compounds.

BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains incompletely 
elucidated, and there is a notable deficiency in effective and safe therapeutic 
interventions. The influence of brain matrix viscoelasticity on the progression 
of AD has frequently been underestimated. It is imperative to elucidate these 
overlooked pathogenic factors and to innovate novel therapeutic strategies for 
AD. Gastrodin, a bioactive constituent derived from the traditional Chinese 
medicinal herb Gastrodia elata, exhibits a range of pharmacological properties, 
notably in the enhancement of neural function. Nevertheless, the underlying 
mechanisms of its action remain insufficiently elucidated. Consequently, this 
study seeks to examine the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of 
gastrodin in the context of AD, with particular emphasis on its potential 
influence on the viscoelastic properties of the brain matrix.
METHODS: This study employs a range of methodologies, including the Morris water 
maze test, Y-maze spontaneous alternation test, atomic force microscopy (AFM), 
immunofluorescence, transmission electron microscopy, molecular docking, and 
Cellular Thermal Shift Assay (CETSA), to demonstrate that gastrodin mitigates 
tau pathology by modulating FERMT2, thereby reversing the deterioration of 
mechanical viscoelasticity in the brain.
RESULTS: Gastrodin administration via gavage has been demonstrated to mitigate 
cognitive decline associated with AD, attenuate the hyperphosphorylation of tau 
protein in the hippocampus and cortex, and ameliorate synaptic damage. 
Additionally, gastrodin was observed to counteract the reduction in brain matrix 
viscoelasticity in 3xTg-AD mice, as evidenced by the upregulation of 
extracellular matrix components pertinent to viscoelasticity, notably collagen 
types I and IV. Furthermore, molecular docking and CETSA revealed a strong 
binding affinity between gastrodin and FERMT2. Gastrodin treatment resulted in a 
reduction of FERMT2 fluorescence intensity, which is selectively expressed in 
astrocytes. Additionally, gastrodin contributed to the restoration of the 
blood-brain barrier (BBB) and modulated the expression levels of inflammatory 
mediators interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and matrix 
metallopeptidase 8 (MMP8).
CONCLUSION: Gastrodin treatment has the potential to mitigate tau pathology, 
thereby enhancing learning and memory in AD mouse models. This effect may be 
mediated through the modulation of cerebral mechanical viscoelasticity via the 
mechanosensor FERMT2, which facilitates the restoration of synaptic structure 
and function. This process is potentially linked to the maintenance of BBB 
integrity and the modulation of inflammatory factor release.

Klotho, initially introduced as an anti-aging protein, is expressed in the 
brain, pancreas, and most prominently in the kidney. The two forms of Klotho 
(membrane-bound and soluble form) have diverse pharmacological functions such as 
anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, anti-fibrotic, tumour-suppressive etc. The 
membrane-bound form plays a pivotal role in maintaining kidney homeostasis by 
regulating fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF 23) signalling, vitamin D metabolism 
and phosphate balance. Klotho deficiency has been linked with significantly 
reduced protection against various kidney pathological phenotypes, including 
diabetic kidney disease (DKD), which is a major cause of chronic kidney disease 
leading to end-stage kidney disease. Owing to the pleiotropic actions of klotho, 
it has shown beneficial effects in DKD by tackling the complex pathophysiology 
and reducing kidney inflammation, oxidative stress, as well as fibrosis. 
Moreover, the protective effect of klotho extends beyond DKD in other 
pathological conditions, including cardiovascular diseases, alzheimer's disease, 
cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, and liver disease. Therefore, this review 
summarizes the relationship between Klotho expression and various diseases with 
a special emphasis on DKD, the distinct mechanisms and the potential of 
exogenous Klotho supplementation as a therapeutic strategy. Future research into 
exogenous Klotho could unravel novel treatment avenues for DKD and other 
diseases.

BACKGROUND: Photoreceptor death leads to inherited blinding retinal diseases, 
such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP). As disease progression often outpaces 
therapeutic advances, developing effective treatments is urgent. This study 
evaluates the efficacy of small peptides derived from pigment epithelium-derived 
factor (PEDF), which are known to restrict common cell death pathways associated 
with retinal diseases.
METHODS: We tested chemically synthesized peptides (17-mer and H105A) with 
affinity for the PEDF receptor, PEDF-R, delivered as eye drops to two RP mouse 
models: rd10 (phosphodiesterase 6b mutation) and RhoP23H/+ (rhodopsin P23H 
mutation). Additionally, we engineered AAV-H105A vectors for intravitreal 
delivery in RhoP23H/+ mice. To assess peptide effects in human tissue, we used 
retinal organoids exposed to cigarette smoke extract, a model of oxidative 
stress. Photoreceptor survival, morphology and function were evaluated.
RESULTS: Here we show that peptides 17-mer and H105A delivered via eye drops 
successfully reach the retina, promote photoreceptor survival, and improve 
retinal function in both RP mouse models. Intravitreal delivery of a AAV-H105A 
vector delays photoreceptor degeneration in RhoP23H/+ mice up to six months. In 
human retinal organoids, peptide H105A specifically prevents photoreceptor death 
induced by oxidative stress, a contributing factor to RP progression.
CONCLUSIONS: PEDF peptide-based eye drops offer a promising, minimally invasive 
therapy to prevent photoreceptor degeneration in retinal disorders, with a 
favorable safety profile.

Plain Language Summary: Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a rare inherited condition 
that causes the gradual death of photoreceptors (light-sensing cells) in the 
eye, leading to vision loss. There is currently no cure. This study tested a 
potential treatment using small protein fragments (peptides) from PEDF, a 
protective protein naturally found in the eye. Researchers delivered these 
peptides through eye drops or gene therapy in mouse models of RP and to human 
retinal organoids (lab-grown retina tissue). Mice treated early maintained 
healthy vision cells, while untreated mice experienced rapid cell loss and 
vision decline. These results suggest that peptide-based eye drops could be a 
simple, safe, and effective way to slow vision loss in patients with RP.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer disease (AD)-modifying therapies are approved for 
treatment of early-symptomatic AD. Autosomal dominant AD (ADAD) provides a 
unique opportunity to test therapies in presymptomatic individuals.
METHODS: Using data from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN), 
sample sizes for clinical trials were estimated for various cognitive, imaging, 
and CSF outcomes. Sample sizes were computed for detecting a reduction of either 
absolute levels of AD-related pathology (amyloid, tau) or change over time in 
neurodegeneration (atrophy, hypometabolism, cognitive change).
RESULTS: Biomarkers measuring amyloid and tau pathology had required sample 
sizes below 200 participants per arm (examples CSF Aβ42/40: 47[95 %CI 25,104], 
cortical PIB 49[28,99], CSF p-tau181 74[48,125]) for a four-year trial in 
presymptomatic individuals (CDR=0) to have 80 % power (5 % statistical 
significance) to detect a 25 % reduction in absolute levels of pathology, 
allowing 40 % dropout. For cognitive, MRI, and FDG, it was more appropriate to 
detect a 50 % reduction in rate of change. Sample sizes ranged from 250 to 900 
(examples hippocampal volume: 338[131,2096], cognitive composite: 
326[157,1074]). MRI, FDG and cognitive outcomes had lower sample sizes when 
including indivduals with mild impairment (CDR=0.5 and 1) as well as 
presymptomatic individuals (CDR=0).
DISCUSSION: Despite the rarity of ADAD, presymptomatic clinical trials with 
feasible sample sizes given the number of cases appear possible.

Maximizing the benefit and managing the risk of anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody 
therapy for Alzheimer's disease: Strategies and research directions.

Anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies (MABs) have introduced a new era of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapeutics with disease-targeted drugs. Three agents 
--- aducanumab, lecanemab, donanemab --- have been approved and others are in 
development. These agents are administered intravenously, once in the brain they 
activate microglia to engulf amyloid-beta protein fibrillar plaques. Each 
approved agent has a specific profile of administration, titration, amyloid 
target, and adverse events. In 18 month trials of participants with early AD 
(defined as mild cognitive impairment due to AD or mild AD dementia), 
anti-amyloid MABs slow cognitive and functional decline by approximately 30 ​%. 
Amyloid positron emission tomography reveals marked reductions in amyloid plaque 
burden; reductions below a threshold of 15-25 Centiloids are associated with 
clinical benefit. The magnitude, scope, and trajectory of clinical end points 
provide the basis for interpretations of clinical meaningfulness. Occurrence of 
amyloid-related imaging abnormalities with intracerebral edema, 
microhemorrhages, or superficial siderosis must be monitored and managed to 
prevent serious or rare catastrophic consequences. Infusion reactions occur and 
anticipatory management is required. Development of subcutaneous formulations 
and use of blood-based biomarkers for diagnosis and monitoring promises to 
increase the accessibility and decrease the demands on health care systems 
associated with these agents. Anti-amyloid MABs provide the foundation for 
further advances in developing a repertoire of disease-targeted therapies for 
AD.

Donepezil (Do), a drug known for its ability to reduce neuronal inflammation and 
for its use in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, has shown promise in 
combating hepatic lipid accumulation in hyperlipidemic conditions and 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, a factor associated with alterations in 
hepatic lipid metabolism. However, the mechanisms by which these problems are 
alleviated have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the 
effects of Do on hepatic lipid metabolism through both in vitro and in vivo 
studies. We examined the expression of proteins associated with lipogenesis and 
ER stress via immunoblot analysis, and hepatic lipid accumulation was assessed 
via oil red O staining. In addition, autophagosome formation was analyzed by 
counting MDC-positive cells. Our results demonstrated that Do treatment improved 
hepatic lipid metabolism and reduced the expression of ER stress markers, 
resulting in decreased lipogenic lipid deposition and apoptosis in the 
hepatocytes and livers of hyperlipidemic mice. Mechanistically, knocking down 
AMPK or inhibiting autophagy with 3-methyladenine (3 MA) attenuated the effects 
of Do on palmitate-exposed hepatocytes. These results suggest that Do alleviates 
hepatic ER stress via the AMPK/autophagy pathway and AMPK-mediated fatty acid 
oxidation, resulting in improved hepatic lipid metabolism and reduced hepatic 
steatosis and apoptosis. Our study provides evidence that Do may be a promising 
therapeutic approach for Alzheimer's disease patients with metabolic 
dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD).

Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) specifically bind to target RNA sequences and 
regulate protein expression through various mechanisms. ASOs are a promising 
therapeutic approach for treating neurodegenerative diseases. The ASO field is a 
growing area of drug development that focuses on targeting the root cause of 
diseases at the RNA level, providing a promising alternative to therapies that 
target downstream processes. Addressing challenges related to off-target effects 
and inadequate biological activity is essential to successfully develop 
ASO-based therapies. Researchers have investigated various chemical 
modifications and delivery strategies to overcome these challenges. This review 
discusses oligonucleotide-based therapies, particularly ASOs. We discuss the 
chemical modifications and mechanisms of action of ASOs. Additionally, we recap 
the results of preclinical and clinical studies testing different ASOs in 
various neurodegenerative disorders, including spinal muscular atrophy, 
Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and 
Parkinson's disease. In conclusion, ASO drugs show promise as a therapeutic 
option for treating neurodegenerative diseases.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive brain 
stimulation technique used to modulate neocortical excitability, with expanding 
applications in neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, the cellular 
and molecular mechanisms underlying its effects, particularly the role of 
microglia -the resident immune cells of the central nervous system- remain 
poorly understood. This review synthesizes recent findings on how different rTMS 
protocols influence microglial function under physiological conditions and in 
disease models. Emerging evidence indicates that rTMS modulates microglial 
activation, promoting neuroprotective and plasticity-enhancing processes not 
only in models of brain disorders, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, 
but also in healthy neural circuits. While much of the current research has 
focused on the inflammatory profile of microglia, critical aspects such as 
activity-dependent synaptic remodeling, phagocytic activity, and process 
motility remain underexplored. Given the substantial heterogeneity of microglial 
responses across brain regions, age, and sex, as well as their differential 
roles in health and disease, a deeper understanding of their involvement in 
rTMS-induced plasticity is essential. Future studies should integrate selective 
microglial manipulation and advanced structural, functional, and molecular 
profiling techniques to clarify their causal involvement. Addressing these gaps 
will be pivotal in optimizing rTMS protocols and maximizing its therapeutic 
potential across a spectrum of neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions.

Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) have emerged as a major global 
health challenge due to the aging population. This study is among the first to 
investigate the impact of extreme high temperatures on ADRD hospitalization in a 
developing country, leveraging individual-level inpatient medical records. We 
found that both transient and cumulative exposure to heat waves significantly 
increased total hospitalization expenses and the length of hospital stay for 
ADRD patients. Specifically, an additional day with a daily mean temperature 
exceeding 30 °C in the preceding 7 days, compared to a moderate day with a 
temperature between 14-18 °C, was associated with a 1.5 % (200.2 yuan) increase 
in total hospitalization expenses and a 1.8 % (0.2 days) increase in the length 
of hospital stay. These effects were largely driven by out-of-pocket 
expenditures on nursing care and were particularly pronounced among male 
patients and those aged over 75.

Caspase activation has been linked to several diseases, including cancer, 
neurodegeneration, and inflammatory conditions, generating interest in targeting 
this family of proteases for drug development. Caspase-2 (Casp2) in particular 
has been implicated in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) by cleaving tau protein into 
fragment Δtau314, which reversibly impairs cognitive and synaptic function. 
Thus, Casp2 inhibition could be a useful strategy for therapeutic treatment of 
AD. To that end, we have previously synthesized and characterized various series 
of peptide and peptidomimetic inhibitors that demonstrate potency and 
selectivity for Casp2 over caspase-3 (Casp3). Despite promising developments in 
the design of selective Casp2 inhibitors, low expression yields of Casp2 hinder 
crystallographic experiments and make structure-based design challenging. The 
design of circularly permuted (cp) Casp2 increased protein yields considerably; 
however, this protein could not be crystallized. This article describes the 
characterization of ten novel cpCasp2 mutants, designed with the goal of 
increasing stability and facilitating crystallization. Gratifyingly, engineered 
mutant JF1cpCasp2 displayed high relative stability and was readily 
crystallizable with the canonical Casp2 inhibitor AcVDVAD-CHO, leading to what 
we believe to be the first crystal structures of any reverse caspase in the PDB. 
Moreover, we have reported the structure of JF1cpCasp2 with our recently 
described Casp2-selective inhibitor MUR-65, which revealed a unique interaction 
with Arg417 in the binding pocket. Overall, JF1cpCasp2 has proven valuable for 
structure-based design and expanding understanding of Casp2 inhibition, with 
potential implications for drug discovery and the development of more selective 
compounds.

Amyloid cerebrovascular disease, primarily driven by the accumulation of 
amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, is intricately linked to neurodegenerative disorders 
like Alzheimer's disease. BACE1 (beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving 
enzyme 1) plays a critical role in the production of Aβ, making it a key 
therapeutic target. In the current work, a CNS library of ChemDiv database 
containing 44085 compounds was screened against the BACE1 protein. Initially, a 
structure-based pharmacophore hypothesis was constructed, followed by virtual 
screening, with the screened hits docked to the BACE1 protein to determine the 
optimal binding modes. The docking results were examined using the glide gscore 
and chemical interactions of the docked molecules. The cutoff value of -5 
kcal/mol was used to select hits with high binding affinities. A total of seven 
hits were chosen based on the glide g score. Furthermore, the possible binding 
mechanisms of the docked ligands were investigated, and it was discovered that 
all seven selected ligands occupied the same site in the predicted binding 
pocket of protein. The bioactivity scores of the compounds demonstrated that the 
chosen compounds possess the features of lead compounds. The toxicity risks and 
ADMET features of the selected hits were anticipated, and four compounds, 
J032-0080, SC13-0774, V030-0915, and V006-5608 were chosen for stability 
analysis. The selected hits were extremely stable and strongly bound to the 
BACE1 pocket, and conformational changes caused by RMSD, RMSF, and 
protein-ligand interactions were assessed using MD modeling. Similarly, 
principal component analysis revealed a large static number of hydrogen bonds. 
The MM/GBSA binding free energies maps revealed a significant energy 
contribution in the binding of selected hits to BACE1. The binding free energy 
landscapes indicated that the hits were bound with a high binding affinity. 
Thus, the hits could serve as lead compounds in biophysical investigations to 
limit the biological activity of the BACE1 protein.

Sodium and potassium-activated adenosine 5'-triphosphatase (Na+/K+-ATPase) is a 
pivotal plasma membrane enzyme involved in neuronal activity and cellular 
homeostasis. The dysregulation of these enzymes has been implicated in a 
spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and neurodevelopmental 
disorders including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), psychiatric disorders such 
as schizophrenia, and neurological problems like epilepsy. A hallmark of these 
disorders is the gradual loss of neuronal integrity and function, often 
exacerbated by protein accumulation within brain cells. This review delves into 
the multifaceted role of Na+/K+-ATPase dysfunction in driving oxidative stress, 
excitotoxicity, and neuroinflammation, contributing to synaptic and neuronal 
damage. Emerging therapeutic strategies, such as gene therapy and developing 
isoform-specific enzyme modulators, offer promising avenues for targeted 
interventions. Furthermore, this review highlights innovative research 
directions, including the role of Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase in synaptic plasticity, the 
identification of endogenous regulators, and its contribution to 
neuroinflammatory pathways. Personalized medicine and advanced gene-editing 
technologies are positioned as transformative tools for crafting safer and more 
precise therapies tailored to individual patients. This comprehensive 
exploration underscores the enzyme's therapeutic potential and sets the stage 
for developing novel targeted strategies to mitigate the burden of 
Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase-linked neurological disorders.
