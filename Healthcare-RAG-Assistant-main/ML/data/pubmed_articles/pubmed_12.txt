INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD), a debilitating neurodegenerative 
disorder, presents a growing global health challenge due to limited therapeutic 
options. Ergosterol, known for its neuroprotective and antioxidant properties, 
suffers from poor bioavailability. This study aimed to develop ergosterol-loaded 
nanoliposomes (ER-NL-2) and evaluate their safety, antioxidant potential, and 
therapeutic efficacy in animal models of AD.
METHODS: ER-NL-2 was formulated using the ultrasonic thin-film dispersion method 
and characterized via dynamic light scattering (DLS), zeta potential, and TEM. 
Acute oral toxicity was assessed in Wistar rats and Swiss mice (2000 mg/kg). Two 
AD models were employed: Streptozotocin (STZ)- induced in Swiss albino mice and 
AlCl₃-induced in Wistar albino rats. Behavioral studies included actophotometer 
and elevated plus maze tests. Antioxidant assays measured SOD, CAT, GSH, and LPO 
levels. Histopathological analysis of brain tissue was conducted.
RESULTS: ER-NL-2 exhibited a mean droplet size of ~180 nm, PDI <0.3, and zeta 
potential of -27.9 mV. TEM confirmed spherical morphology. Toxicity studies 
showed no abnormalities. In both AD models, ER-NL-2 improved locomotor activity 
and reduced transfer latency. Biochemical analyses revealed elevated SOD, CAT, 
GSH and reduced LPO levels. Histopathology showed preserved neuronal integrity 
and reduced neurofibrillary tangles in treated groups.
DISCUSSION: ER-NL-2 demonstrated neuroprotective efficacy through behavioral, 
biochemical, and histological endpoints, confirming its antioxidative mechanism 
and brain safety profile. It was comparable to standard therapy (donepezil).
CONCLUSION: ER-NL-2 is a safe and promising nanocarrier for Alzheimer's 
treatment with significant neuroprotective and antioxidant properties. Further 
studies are warranted to explore its pharmacokinetics and clinical 
applicability.

INTRODUCTION: The novel positron emission tomography (PET) tracer, 
18F-florzolotau, enables in vivo visualization of tau pathology.
METHODS: We evaluated the diagnostic performance of disease-specific spatial 
patterns of 18F-florzolotau PET imaging by visual read for tauopathies and its 
added value in diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making in 1277 participants 
with cognitive complaints.
RESULTS: The disease-specific spatial patterns of 18F-florzolotau PET imaging 
demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy in differentiating various tauopathies, 
with 96.0% for Alzheimer's disease, 94.4% for frontotemporal lobe degeneration, 
93.7% for progressive supranuclear palsy, and 97.5% for corticobasal 
degeneration. Added to a standard diagnostic workup, 18F-florzolotau PET reading 
led to diagnostic revisions for 247 participants (19.3%), increased diagnostic 
confidence from 68.6% to 81.3%, and resulted in medication changes for 284 
participants (22.2%).
DISCUSSION: Our data advocate for the strategic implementation of 
18F-florzolotau PET in memory clinics, offering transformative potential for 
patient care and management.
HIGHLIGHTS: 18F-Florzolotau PET imaging presented disease-specific spatial 
patterns for different tauopathies. The disease-specific spatial patterns of 
18F-florzolotau positron emission tomography (PET) imaging exhibited high 
diagnostic accuracy in differentiating various tauopathies. Integration of 
18F-florzolotau PET imaging modality to a standard diagnostic workup 
significantly enhanced diagnostic confidence, enabled diagnostic revisions, and 
informed adjustments to treatment strategies.

OBJECTIVE: To understand the real-world clinical practice patterns and variation 
in Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnostic and screening tool utilization by primary 
care physicians (PCPs), including tools used for assessing dementia/AD severity 
and subsequent treatment patterns.
METHODS: This retrospective observational study used de-identified primary care 
data from electronic medical records (EMR) data provided by the researchers from 
Queen's University, Ontario, Canada from August 2011 to August 2021. Individuals 
≥50 years old with dementia or AD were identified using AD and dementia-related 
diagnostic codes, medications, and keywords searched using natural language 
processing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms from EMR chart 
notes. Diagnostic and screening tools included scales, neuroimaging, and 
laboratory tests. Medications examined were cholinesterase inhibitors, 
memantine, antidepressants, and antipsychotics.
RESULTS: The study cohort included 417 individuals with all-cause dementia (mean 
[standard deviation: SD] age: 78.86 [0.19] years), and 71 individuals with AD 
(mean [SD] age: 76.13 [1.07]). The most-used scale was the Montreal Cognitive 
Assessment (MoCA; dementia: 53.2%, AD: 84.5%). The mean [SD] frequency of MoCA 
administration doubled in the year following AD index date compared to the year 
prior (0.29 [0.82] to 0.67 [1.19] times per patient-year). Severity scores, 
often unspecified, suggested various stages of cognitive impairment. Among the 
medications examined, cholinesterase inhibitors were prescribed in 27.8% 
(n = 116) and 57.8% (n = 41) of people with dementia and AD, respectively. 
Antidepressants were the most frequently prescribed medication examined 
(dementia: 49.6%; AD: 71.8%).
CONCLUSION: PCPs play an important role in the early detection and management of 
dementia/AD. As new biomarkers and therapies emerge for early AD, there is a 
need for connected health system data to guide PCPs through the early diagnostic 
process.

Persistent passive coping (p-coping) behaviour is a hallmark feature in major 
depression and is reversed by fast-acting antidepressants (such as ketamine). 
This behaviour is regulated by a specific cortico-midbrain circuit. However, the 
contribution of inhibition in prefrontal cortex to p-coping modulation, and its 
relevance to chronic stress and/or fast-acting antidepressant effects, are 
poorly understood. Here, we found that rostral prelimbic cortex (rPL) 
bidirectionally controls p-coping behaviour where excitatory and inhibitory 
neurons play opposite roles. Chronic stress leads to a reduced 
excitation/inhibition (E/I) ratio, reflected as alterations of in vivo spiking 
rate, synaptic strength, and intrinsic excitability of rPL neurons. A 
fast-acting antidepressant, (2 R,6 R)-hydroxynorketamine (HNK), reduced 
p-coping, restored rPL E/I ratio, and partially reversed neuronal changes in 
chronically stressed mice. Notably, chronic stress and HNK significantly 
affected fast-spiking/parvalbumin inhibitory neurons which also bidirectionally 
regulate the passive coping behaviour, highlighting the critical roles of these 
neurons in the above processes. These findings underscore the importance of rPL 
E/I balance in regulating p-coping behaviour, which is disrupted by chronic 
stress and rapidly restored by fast-acting antidepressant.

Millions of individuals worldwide suffer from Alzheimer's Disease (AD), a 
debilitating degenerative condition. Early detection of Alzheimer's disease is 
critical to ensure effective treatment and better patient outcomes. In the past 
few years, advanced medical imaging techniques, particularly MRI, have shown 
potential for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease. However, developing accurate and 
efficient techniques for Alzheimer's disease detection offcuts a demanding duty 
suitable to the complication of medical images and the limited availability of 
labelled data. The early detection of Alzheimer's disease is critical for 
effective treatment and management of this debilitating neurodegenerative 
condition. The research proposes a novel method for Alzheimer's disease 
detection using an optimization-enabled ResNet feature extraction technique with 
transfer learning that is proposed by combining LeNet and VGG networks. The 
pre-processing was done using image resizing and median filter and the 
featureextraction was conducted using the proposed Walrus Optimization 
Algorithm-Residual neural network (WOA-ResNet), where WOA is employed for 
training ResNet. The conducted experiments with the Alzheimer's dataset achieved 
a higher accuracy using the proposed LeNet-VGG method. The findings suggest that 
optimization-enabled ResNet feature extraction with LeNet-VGG networks can 
significantly improve the accuracy of Alzheimer's disease detection. The 
presented method achieved maximum accuracy value of 95.37 %, sensitivity value 
of 97.24 % and specificity value of 93.73 %.

Microglial biology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) has become a major focus of 
investigation, aiming to define how these cells contribute to neurodegeneration 
and to develop new therapeutic strategies. Once regarded as passive responders, 
microglia are now recognized as active regulators of brain homeostasis, immune 
signaling, and synaptic remodeling. Their interactions with genetic risk 
variants and age-related changes are increasingly understood to play central 
roles in AD pathogenesis. In this mini-review, we summarize recent progress in 
identifying microglial contributions to AD through genetic and transcriptomic 
studies. We discuss how microglia respond to amyloid-β and tau pathology by 
shifting into diverse functional disease-associated states, which may either 
protect or harm the brain depending on context and disease stage. We also 
outline the rationale for targeting microglia through replacement strategies and 
review emerging approaches using circulation-derived myeloid cells (CDMCs), and 
human pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia-like cells. These replacement 
methods have shown potential to rectify microglial functions and modify 
AD-related pathology in preclinical models, offering a novel therapeutic 
direction for neurodegenerative diseases.

BACKGROUND: Individuals with Down syndrome have a genetically determined form of 
Alzheimer's disease, due to an additional copy of the APP gene. Nearly all 
individuals with Down syndrome develop Alzheimer's disease pathology by age 40 
years, and approximately 70% are diagnosed with dementia by around age 54 years, 
with an overall lifetime risk of 95%. Moreover, Alzheimer's disease is the 
leading cause of death in adults with Down syndrome older than 35 years.
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS: The intersection of Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease 
has garnered substantial attention in the past 10 years as research indicates 
that the trajectory of clinical symptoms and biomarker changes in adults with 
Down syndrome closely resembles that seen in late-onset Alzheimer's disease and 
autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease (ADAD). The predictive nature of dementia 
onset in genetically determined populations allows precise staging of disease in 
individuals along the Alzheimer's disease continuum. The high prevalence of 
Alzheimer's disease pathology combined with the few age-related comorbidities in 
these cohorts, makes them ideal for understanding the biological mechanisms 
related to late-onset Alzheimer's disease. The more rapid disease progression 
seen in people with Down syndrome-related Alzheimer's disease compared with 
people with ADAD or late-onset Alzheimer's disease provides important insights 
and supports the rationale for new clinical trials. WHERE NEXT?: The Alzheimer's 
Clinical Trials Consortium-Down Syndrome is ushering in a new era of therapies 
for individuals with Down syndrome. Three ongoing clinical trials, in close 
collaboration with industry partners, specifically designed for this population, 
are focused on testing disease-modifying treatments. These innovative efforts 
mark a considerable stride in bringing groundbreaking therapies to a group that 
has long been excluded from clinical trials in Alzheimer's disease.

BACKGROUND: Plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau) biomarkers show promise to 
transform the clinical management of Alzheimer's disease by providing more 
accessible and cost-effective diagnostic tools. p-tau biomarkers have emerged as 
leading contenders for clinical implementation; however, there have been no 
comprehensive meta-analyses of their diagnostic performance. We aimed to 
evaluate the diagnostic performance of plasma p-tau biomarkers and individual 
p-tau assays to identify biologically defined Alzheimer's disease.
METHODS: For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched Embase, 
MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for articles published from July 1, 
1984 up to Dec 9, 2024, that reported on the discriminative accuracy of plasma 
p-tau biomarkers for amyloid-PET, tau-PET, CSF, and neuropathological reference 
standards. We included cohort, case-control, cross-sectional, and randomised 
controlled studies that recruited adults from any setting. Articles were 
excluded if they did not contain data on a p-tau blood biomarker, did not 
contain an appropriate biological reference standard, did not report diagnostic 
accuracy data, included participants younger than 18 years, or reported 
duplicate or overlapping data from another publication. Summary data were 
independently extracted by eight authors. Risk of bias was assessed using 
QUADAS-2. The primary outcome was the diagnostic performance of plasma p-tau 
biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease. We used a bivariate random-effects 
meta-analysis to estimate pooled sensitivity, specificity, diagnostics odds 
ratio and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. We assessed 
the certainty of evidence using GRADE. This study was done following PRISMA-DTA 
guidelines and is registered with PROSPERO as CRD42023422143.
FINDINGS: Of the 6429 studies identified by our search, 312 studies were 
assessed for eligibility, with 113 studies included in the final analysis, 
comprising 29 625 unique individuals. Plasma p-tau217 was the highest-performing 
biomarker for identifying biologically defined Alzheimer's disease, with pooled 
sensitivity of 88·1% (95% CI 86·7-89·5, moderate certainty of evidence), 
specificity of 88·7% (87·4-89·9, moderate certainty of evidence), area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 91·1% (88·9-92·4, moderate 
certainty of evidence), and diagnostic odds ratio of 50·7 (40·6-63·4). p-tau181 
pooled sensitivity was 80·5% (78·4-82·4, low certainty of evidence), specificity 
was 76·4% (74·1-78·6, low certainty of evidence), AUROC was 81·5% (80·2-82·9, 
low certainty of evidence), and diagnostic odds ratio was 13·4 (11·4-16·7). 
p-tau205 pooled sensitivity was 76·6% (70·7-81·6, moderate certainty of 
evidence), specificity was 86·0% (78·6-91·2, moderate certainty of evidence), 
AUROC was 85·1% (80·7-89·6, moderate certainty of evidence), and diagnostic odds 
ratio was 20·2 (10·5-38·7). p-tau212 pooled sensitivity was 84·5% (75·5-90·6, 
moderate certainty of evidence), specificity was 87·3% (79·5-92·5, moderate 
certainty of evidence), AUROC was 90·3% (86·6-94·1, moderate certainty of

was 75·3% (71·2-78·9, moderate certainty of evidence), AUROC was 80·2 
(77·6-82·7, moderate certainty of evidence), and diagnostic odds ratio was 9·3 
(7·0-12·2). Approximately 90% of studies were rated as high risk of bias for not 
having used predefined or externally derived thresholds.
INTERPRETATION: Plasma p-tau217 is a highly sensitive and specific biomarker for 
Alzheimer's disease pathology, despite the high risk of bias of many studies. 
Prospective clinical implementation studies in real-world settings are needed to 
characterise the effect of plasma p-tau217 on Alzheimer's disease diagnosis and 
clinical management.

OBJECTIVES: Natural products (NP) play a crucial role in the development of new 
compounds, due to their complex chemical structure and pharmacological 
diversity. Neurodegenerative diseases and other disorders in the central nervous 
system (CNS) have become a significant problem in the world due to the increase 
in life expectancy of the elderly population. This increases the risk of 
developing diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, 
Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, this exploratory review aims to show the 
applications of zebrafish for NP research and how they can be used in CNS's in 
vivo studies.
METHODS: The present review covers the literature survey until 2023, including 
the descriptors for zebrafish, natural product and neurodegenerative diseases. 
The databases used were PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane and Lilacs.
KEY FINDINGS: For the development of new medicines, an efficient animal model is 
required, and the zebrafish has stood out as a promising model due to its small 
size, low cost of maintenance, ease of handling, and transparency of embryos, 
which allows real-time observation of development and pathological processes. 
They possess conserved neurotransmission systems such as glutamatergic, 
cholinergic, dopaminergic, serotonergic, histaminergic, GABAergic, and 
purinergic pathways, making them especially relevant for modelling CNS 
disorders. From literature survey, flavonoids, alkaloids, and phenolic compounds 
were the most frequently studied, indicating that its influence the 
pathophysiological mechanisms associated with neurodegenerative diseases.
CONCLUSIONS: This current review offers data for further research work with 
natural products aiming treatment for CNS disorders.

Transferrin receptor (TfR)-targeting of biologics has emerged as a promising 
strategy to improve drug delivery across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). However, 
most preclinical studies evaluating TfR-enabled drugs have been conducted in 
young adult animals. It remains unclear whether age and aging-related diseases 
impact TfR protein levels and/or BBB transport capacity. Here, we utilized a 
previously described TfR-targeting antibody transport vehicle (ATVTfR) to 
investigate how healthy aging and disease progression in the 5xFAD mouse model 
of Alzheimer's disease (AD) impact TfR protein and TfR-mediated brain delivery. 
ATVTfR transport capacity remained stable across 3- to 24-month-old healthy mice 
and 5xFAD progression did not impair ATVTfR brain transport up to 10.5 months, 
despite significant amyloid burden. Interestingly, neonates exhibited 
significantly elevated levels of vascular TfR protein and ATVTfR brain exposure 
compared to adult mice. Furthermore, vascular TfR in AD patient brains was 
similar to age-matched controls, suggesting conserved TfR transport is also 
likely in human AD. Overall, our data demonstrates broad functional utility for 
TfR-based brain delivery in both healthy aging and in an AD mouse model. 
Additionally, elevated TfR-mediated brain delivery during early mouse 
development highlights the potential of added efficacy in utilizing such 
platforms in disease treatment of infants and children.

Neurodegenerative diseases, which are characterized by progressive neuronal loss 
and the lack of disease-modifying therapies, are becoming a major global health 
challenge. The existing neuromodulation techniques, such as deep brain 
stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation, show limitations such as 
invasiveness, restricted cortical targeting, and irreversible tissue effects. In 
this context, low-intensity transcranial ultrasound has emerged as a promising 
noninvasive alternative that can penetrate deep into the brain and modulate 
neuroplasticity. This review comprehensively assesses the therapeutic 
mechanisms, efficacy, and translational potential of low-intensity transcranial 
ultrasound in treating neurodegenerative diseases, with emphasis on its role in 
promoting neuronal regeneration, modulating neuroinflammation, and enhancing 
functional recovery. We summarize the findings of previous studies and 
systematically illustrate the potential of low-intensity transcranial ultrasound 
in regulating cell death mechanisms, enhancing neural repair and regeneration, 
and alleviating symptoms associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Preclinical 
findings indicate that low-intensity transcranial ultrasound can enhance the 
release of neurotrophic factors (e.g., brain-derived neurotrophic factor), 
promote autophagy to clear protein aggregates, modulate microglial activation, 
and temporarily open the blood-brain barrier to facilitate targeted drug 
delivery. Existing clinical trial data show that low-intensity transcranial 
ultrasound can reduce amyloid-? plaques, improve motor and cognitive deficits, 
and promote remyelination in various disease models. Early clinical trials 
suggest that low-intensity transcranial ultrasound may enhance cognitive scores 
in Alzheimer's disease and alleviate motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease, all 
while demonstrating a favorable safety profile. Past studies support the notion 
that by integrating safety, precision, and reversibility, low-intensity 
transcranial ultrasound can transform the treatment landscape for 
neurodegenerative disease. However, more advancements are necessary for future 
clinical application of low-intensity transcranial ultrasound, including 
optimizing parameters such as frequency, intensity, and duty cycle; considering 
individual anatomical differences; and confirming long-term efficacy. We believe 
establishing standardized protocols, conducting larger trials, and investigating 
the underlying mechanisms to clarify dose-response relationships and refine 
personalized application strategies are essential in this regard. Future 
research should focus on translating preclinical findings into clinical 
practice, addressing technical challenges, and exploring combination therapies 
with pharmacological or gene interventions.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing healthcare crisis with limited 
effective therapies. This study aims to identify new candidate drugs that can be 
repurposed using key transcriptional regulators (DERs) in AD as therapeutic 
targets.
METHODS: Multi-cohort single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) data from the 
prefrontal cortex were analysed to identify DERs. Molecular docking and dynamic 
simulations analysis evaluated interactions between DERs and 2200 Food and Drug 
Administration-approved drugs to assess binding stability, whilst 
pharmacokinetic parameters relevant to blood-brain barrier permeability were 
evaluated.
RESULTS: We identified 20 key DERs associated with AD. Lasmiditan stood out as 
the most promising drug amongst other drug candidates (Vorapaxar, Bictegravir, 
Tonaftate, Fluspirilene, Lisuride, Olaparib) interacting with five DERs: ZEB2, 
APP, PAX6, ETV6, and ST18. Lasmiditan-ETV6 complex showed the best binding 
stability (RMSD: 2.98 Å, H-bonds: 68.38) and optimal passive diffusion (LogP3-4, 
TPSA 60-75 Å2).
DISCUSSION: Lasmiditan is a potential AD therapeutic candidate that warrants 
further preclinical validation.
KEY POINTS: 20 key transcriptional regulators (DERs) were identified linked to 
AD in myeloid, and neuronal cell populations. The DERs correlated with Braak 
stage, APOE genotype, and aging. ETV6 is a potentially viable therapeutic target 
due to its ability to form stable and strongly interacting complexes across 
multiple drugs. Lasmiditan showed the strongest binding to ETV6 (RMSD: 2.98 Å, 
H-bonds: 68.38) and optimal blood-brain-barrier (BBB) penetration (LogP 3-4, 
TPSA 60-75). Lasmiditan is a potentially promising AD therapeutic candidate that 
warrants further preclinical validation.

In the world, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the utmost public reason for dementia. 
AD causes memory loss and disturbing mental function impairment in aging people. 
The loss of memory and disturbing mental function brings a significant load on 
patients as well as on society. So far, there is no actual treatment that can 
cure AD; however, early diagnosis can slow down this disease. Deep learning has 
shown substantial success in diagnosing AZ disease. However, challenges remain 
due to limited data, improper model selection, and extraction of irrelevant 
features. In this work, we proposed a fully automated framework based on the 
fusion of a vision transformer and a novel inverted residual bottleneck with 
self-attention (IRBwSA) for AD diagnosis. In the first step, data augmentation 
was performed to balance the selected dataset. After that, the vision model is 
designed and modified according to the dataset. Similarly, a new inverted 
bottleneck self-attention model is developed. The designed models are trained on 
the augmented dataset, and extracted features are fused using a novel 
search-based approach. Moreover, the designed models are interpreted using an 
explainable artificial intelligence technique named LIME. The fused features are 
finally classified using a shallow wide neural network and other classifiers. 
The experimental process was conducted on an augmented MRI dataset, and 96.1% 
accuracy and 96.05% precision rate were obtained. Comparison with a few recent 
techniques shows the proposed framework's better performance.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by 
cognitive decline and associated metabolic disturbances, including altered amino 
acid profiles. This study investigated the effects of probiotic supplementation 
with Lactobacillus rhamnosus HA-114 and Bifidobacterium longum R0175 on serum 
amino acid levels in adults with mild to moderate AD. In a 12-week, randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 60 participants (aged 50-90 years) were 
assigned to three groups: L. rhamnosus (n = 20), B. longum (n = 20), or placebo 
(n = 20). Serum amino acids were analyzed using High-Performance Liquid 
Chromatography (LC). Changes in total amino acids, Branched Chain Amino Acids 
(BCAAs), and aromatic amino acids (AAAs) were assessed as the primary outcomes. 
A significant interaction effect was found between time and group for serum 
amino acids. Compared to placebo, the B. longum group showed a significant 
increase in total amino acids (difference: 2132.67 µmol/L, 95% CI: 
464.06-3801.28; p = 0.01), BCAAs (difference: 255.15 µmol/L, 95% CI: 
53.01-457.30; p = 0.01), and AAAs (difference: 374.34 ng/ml, 95% CI: 
57.45-691.23; p = 0.02). The L. rhamnosus group also showed a significant 
increase in BCAAs compared to placebo (difference: 206.08 µmol/L, 95% CI: 
3.94-408.23; p = 0.04). The greatest improvements were consistently observed in 
the B. longum group across all primary outcome measures. Probiotic 
supplementation, particularly with B. longum, significantly improved serum amino 
acid profiles in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. These 
findings support the potential of specific probiotic strains to address 
metabolic imbalances in AD through gut-brain axis modulation. Trial 
Registration: IRCT number: 20210513051277N1 (2021-05-27).

BACKGROUND: Recent multidomain prevention trials for dementia have shifted 
toward more targeted approaches, focusing on specific combinations of risk 
factors and interventions at certain times. However, the optimal combinations of 
modifiable risk factors that can be targeted to maximize intervention effect 
remain unclear. Identifying risk factor combinations with the highest prevalence 
and largest effect sizes can enhance efficiency of trial design.
OBJECTIVES: To identify risk factor combinations that are both highly prevalent 
and have the most detrimental effect on cognition, and to assess their 
interaction effect and synergism.
DESIGN: Longitudinal analysis of Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA).
SETTING: Community.
PARTICIPANTS: 30,097 adults aged 45 to 85 at baseline MEASUREMENTS: The five 
most prevalent dyad, triad, and tetrad combinations of 12 modifiable risk 
factors were identified. Cognition was assessed with a composite Z-score from a 
neuropsychological test battery. Linear mixed effect models were used to examine 
the association between the identified combinations and 3-year cognitive 
changes. Interaction was assessed on additive scale, and synergism was explored.
RESULTS: The combinations that were both highly prevalent and had the most 
detrimental effect on global cognition were: hearing loss and physical 
inactivity for the dyad (mean difference in change score = -0.07 SD; 95 % CI: 
-0.09 to -0.06; p < 0.001; effect size = -0.28), hearing loss, physical 
inactivity, and hypertension for the triad (mean difference in change score = 
-0.07; 95 % CI: -0.09 to -0.06; p < 0.001; effect size = -0.28), and hearing 
loss, physical inactivity, hypertension, and sleep disturbance for the tetrad 
(mean difference in change score = -0.05; 95 % CI: -0.07 to -0.03; p < 0.001; 
effect size = -0.20). Similar patterns were observed for memory and executive 
function. A significant synergistic interaction was observed between hearing 
loss and physical inactivity for global cognition (p = 0.005).
CONCLUSIONS: The combined effect of multiple risk factors varied by its 
combinations. The combination of hearing loss and physical inactivity offers a 
greater potential benefit than other dyad combinations. Hypertension and sleep 
disturbance can be further included for triad and tetrad combinations. Auditory 
health and exercise should be prioritized for multidomain interventions.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology involves amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulation and 
neuronal toxicity, highlighting the need for therapeutic strategies that can 
both inhibit Aβ aggregation and promote pathogenic protein clearance. In this 
study, we identified Gaultheria leucocarpa as a medicinal plant with promising 
neuroprotective potential. Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence screening revealed 
that extracts from G. leucocarpa (GE), particularly the petroleum ether fraction 
of G. leucocarpa extract (GPF), effectively inhibited Aβ fibril formation in 
vitro. In cell-based assays, GPF significantly improved the viability of PC-12 
​cells exposed to Aβ peptides and fibrils, indicating protection against 
Aβ-induced cytotoxicity. Furthermore, GPF enhanced mitophagic activity, as 
demonstrated by increased GFP-LC3 puncta, elevated LC3-II/I ratio, and 
colocalization of GFP-LC3 with MitoTracker Red. Mechanistic investigations 
showed that GPF activates mitophagy via the AMPK/ULK1 pathway and inhibits the 
PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, resulting in enhanced degradation of APP and Tau 
proteins. In Caenorhabditis elegans models relevant to AD, GPF administration 
led to reduced Aβ deposits, delayed paralysis onset, improved food perception, 
and decreased oxidative stress. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that 
GPF exerts dual actions by inhibiting Aβ fibrillization and promoting 
mitophagy-mediated degradation of pathogenic proteins. The active ingredients 
identified from GPF extracts represent promising leads for the development of 
novel neuroprotective agents targeting AD-related pathological mechanisms.

MiRNA-based therapeutics represent a promising approach for treating multiple 
diseases, yet the key regulatory miRNAs in chronic cerebral hypoperfusion 
(CCH)-related cognitive impairment remains unclear. Here, we identify miR-153 as 
consistently upregulated in both male and female mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 
and late-stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, as well as in the basal 
forebrain of both male and female postmortem AD specimens and male CCH rats. 
Knockdown of miR-153 in the basal forebrain alleviated CCH-induced cognitive 
deficits. Mechanistically, miR-153 directly targeted Karyopherin alpha 5 
(KPNA5), a nuclear transport protein that facilitates nuclear factor erythroid 
2-related factor 2 (NRF2) nuclear translocation. miR-153 suppressed KPNA5 via 
two binding sites in its 3'UTR, impairing NRF2-mediated antioxidant responses 
and promoting oxidative stress, and KPNA5 bound to three nuclear localization 
sequences of NRF2 through protein interaction. Restoration of the 
miR-153-KPNA5-NRF2 axis in the basal forebrain alleviated oxidative stress 
damage in male CCH rats, while no such effect was observed in the hippocampus. 
These findings reveal a potential role of the miR-153-KPNA5-NRF2 axis in 
CCH-related cognitive decline.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition 
characterized by persistent cognitive decli ne, tau-containing intracellular 
neurofibrillary tangles, and β-amyloid (Aβ)-containing extracellular plaques. 
Early symptoms include patchy memory loss and some behavioural abnormalities. 
There is a plethora of studies that have reported sexual dimorphism and a higher 
prevalence of Alzheimer's disease in women. However, the molecular mechanisms 
responsible for these differences remain an enigma. The increasing aging 
population, as well as the decline in estrogen levels, have been attributed to 
increased risk in the development of AD in women. Hormone replacement therapy 
(HRT) has been proposed as an approach for tackling the increased AD 
susceptibility in women; increased AD vulnerability in men is also linked to 
testosterone levels. In addition to the hormonal influence as one of the 
causative factors for increased risk of AD, there is the involvement of genetic 
factors, with APOE ε4 gene documented as a risk gene leading to tau pathological 
changes in the brain of female AD patients. Here, we aim to systematically 
examine literature on the factors and molecular mechanisms responsible for 
sexual dimorphism in increased vulnerability and pathological features of AD, 
with the hope that it may provide information on the diagnosis and therapeutic 
interventions in AD.

The development of small-molecule ligands targeting cholinesterases remains a 
central focus in neuropharmacology, particularly for the treatment of 
neurodegenerative disorders and organophosphate poisoning. This review 
highlights the rational design, synthesis, and biological profiling of diverse 
classes of heterocyclic compounds - including oxazoles, heterostilbenes, 
triazoles, and bicyclo[3.2.1]octane/octadiene derivatives - as reversible 
inhibitors and reactivators of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and 
butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). Novel amino-oxazolostilbenes and their 
photoproducts exhibited selective BChE inhibition, while naphtoxazole and 
triazole-containing scaffolds demonstrated promising dual-target or 
BChE-selective profiles. Several uncharged oximes, such as thienostilbene and 
heterostilbene oximes, showed potential for reactivating cyclosarin-inhibited 
BChE, supporting their further development as CNS-permeable antidotes. 
Additionally, resveratrol-based triazoles and carbamates revealed enhanced BChE 
inhibition, antioxidant activity, and favorable selectivity. Collectively, these 
findings underscore the therapeutic potential of structurally diverse 
cholinesterase ligands and provide a framework for the discovery of 
multifunctional agents for Alzheimer's disease and chemical threat 
countermeasures.

The developmental origin of Alzheimer disease (AD) has been proposed but is 
arguably debated. Here, we developed cerebral organoids from induced pluripotent 
stem cells (iPSCs) with mutations in amyloid precursor protein (APP) associated 
with familial AD (fAD) and analyzed the dynamic changes of cellular states. We 
found that mature neurons induced in fAD organoids markedly decreased compared 
to that of health control, accompanied with increased cell senescence and 
β-amyloid (Aβ) production. Interestingly, the expression level of the gene 
TMSB4X that encodes thymosin beta 4 (Tβ4) significantly decreased both in fAD 
organoids' neurons and AD patients' excitatory neurons. Remarkably, the 
neurodevelopmental deficits and Aβ formation in fAD organoids were rescued by 
treatment with Tβ4. The beneficial effects of Tβ4 were also revealed in 5xfAD 
model mice. Thus, this study has identified Tβ4 as a neuroprotective factor that 
may mitigate altered neurogenesis and AD pathology, highlighting a potential for 
disease intervention.

The number of diagnoses and drug prescriptions for dementia patients is poorly 
available. Delay in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), for which missed 
diagnoses amount to over half cases, and undertreatment of chronic and 
neuropathic pain mirroring excessive use of harmful antipsychotics and 
antidepressants is reported. Our study aimed at diagnosing AD through the most 
advanced artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies even in patients who escaped 
clinical observation. To this end, pharmacoepidemiology data collected as part 
of the first retrospective community study in a wide sample of 298,000 
individuals, 84,235 aged over 60 years, were used to set up an AI algorithm for 
the rescue of missed diagnoses of AD. The core of the algorithm consisted in the 
management of time series represented by pharmacological therapies through a 
distance matrix and in the use of autoencoders. Patients without a diagnosis of 
AD based on pharmacotherapy were 114.920, while diagnosed patients were 1.150, 
mainly aged between 75 and 84 years, pointing at late start of treatment. 
Increased use of antidepressants, neuroleptics, and mood stabilizers is found in 
patients treated with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) and memantine, 
while nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, paracetamol-codeine and opioids are 
mostly prescribed to patients not receiving AChEIs and memantine. The 
classification model demonstrated good global accuracy at the end of training, 
equal to 79.12%. Further studies and longitudinal monitoring of patients are 
needed to improve disease detection and management. The deep learning-based 
pharmacoutilization algorithm generated in the present study will aid the 
diagnosis of AD and the understanding of neuropsychiatric symptoms treatment.

BACKGROUND: Many Korean American older adults have limited English proficiency, 
have low socioeconomic status, and are immigrants. The availability and 
accessibility of linguistic and culturally appropriate dementia-related health 
care and caregiving resources for this population are limited. This is 
concerning given that Korean American older adults are a rapidly growing 
population, and Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRD) represent a 
significant public health issue.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess changes in pre- and posttest knowledge, attitudes, 
and behaviors regarding ADRD prevention and caregiving among participants in the 
Koreans Invested in Making Caregivers' Health Important (KIMCHI) before and 
after their participation in KIMCHI workshop presentations.
METHODS: A community engagement dissemination project, KIMCHI, was developed by 
academic and community partners to culturally and linguistically tailor selected 
evidence-based research from the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute 
for Korean American older adults, caregivers, and other stakeholders. 
Dissemination activities were conducted in-person (as workshops) and on digital 
platforms. Through partnerships with 1 academic institution and 2 community 
organizations that serve Korean Americans, 211 participants participated in the 
KIMCHI in-person workshop presentations, and 134 participants participated 
asynchronously online (via fact sheets on the project website, YouTube videos, 
and other social media, such as Facebook and X [formerly known as Twitter]). 
Pre- and postparticipation tests on knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors for ADRD 
and caregiving were conducted with workshop participants. We administered 
satisfaction surveys to all participants (workshop and online) and conducted 
two-tailed paired-sample 2-tailed t tests to assess mean changes in the pre- and 
postparticipation tests.
RESULTS: Among the workshop participants (N=211), most (114/204, 55.9%) were 
older adults (mean age 69, SD 12.1 y; range 24-90 y), female (n=148, 70.1%), and 
foreign-born (n=203, 96.2%). Many reported having limited English proficiency 
(167/211, 79.1%). Significant changes were observed in posttest ADRD knowledge 
(mean 11.51, SD 2.64), attitudes (mean 7.13, SD 2.83), and behaviors (mean 8.88, 
SD 2.72) compared to pretest scores (knowledge: mean 10.34, SD 2.67; t210=1.17; 
P<.001; attitudes: mean 6.33, SD 2.44; t210=0.8; P<.001; and behaviors: mean 
8.11, SD 2.68; t210=0.76; P<.001). Workshop participants reported high 
satisfaction (196/209, 93.8%) with KIMCHI, with the workshop presentations being 
perceived as culturally relevant and applicable (196/209, 93.8%). Most workshop 
participants expressed interest in learning more about ADRD-related health 
topics (186/209, 89%). Similarly, the online participants (N=134) expressed high 
satisfaction (115/134, 85.8%) and agreed that the topics and content were 
culturally relevant and applicable (116/133, 87.2%) and learned new information 
(110/134, 82.1%).
CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that KIMCHI may have a positive impact on 
improving ADRD knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors among Korean Americans. 
Academic-community collaborations should continue to culturally tailor the 
programs and studies to help ensure greater representation of Korean Americans 
in research and community engagement projects.

IMPORTANCE: The number of physicians and advanced practitioners (APs) whose care 
is concentrated in nursing homes (often referred to as nursing home or skilled 
nursing facility specialists [SNFists]) has increased rapidly. Therefore, 
whether these clinicians provide better care is important.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between SNFist care and outcomes of 
long-stay nursing home (NH) residents with Alzheimer disease and related 
dementias (ADRD).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this retrospective cohort study of 417 378 
residents with ADRD in US NHs, claims for a 20% national sample of Medicare 
fee-for-service beneficiaries between 2013 and 2019 were analyzed. Adjusted 
estimates were based on a machine learning approach that incorporated a doubly 
robust procedure using a generalized estimating equation with inverse 
probability treatment weighting. Three secondary analyses were conducted: (1) 
stratified analyses for physicians and APs, (2) inclusion of physicians of any 
specialty and APs, and (3) use of proxy outcomes for in-place deaths. Data were 
analyzed from June 1, 2024, to May 3, 2025.
INTERVENTION: Receipt of care from a SNFist; SNFists included generalist 
physicians and APs.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) 
visits for ambulatory care-sensitive (ACS) conditions. Death without an ACS 
hospitalization and death without any hospitalization were used in secondary 
analyses.
RESULTS: Of the total 417 378 residents, 242 540 received care from SNFists 
(mean [SD] age, 83.5 [8.7] years), and 174 838 never received care from SNFists 
(mean [SD] age, 84.8 [8.5] years). Compared with the residents who never 
received care from SNFists, the residents who received care from SNFists were 
more likely to be Black (12.6% vs 9.4%; P < .001), dually eligible (77.5% vs 
73.1%; P < .001), and have more chronic conditions (eg, anemia, 60.9% vs 57.6%). 
Compared with non-SNFist clinicians, the SNFist clinicians were more likely to 
be female (physicians, 37.1% vs 23.3%; APs, 88.1% vs 85.1%), practice at more 
facilities (mean [SD] number of facilities, 9.4 [8.7] for SNFist physicians vs 
6.4 [6.1] for non-SNFist physicians; 8.6 [8.1] for SNFist APs vs 7.1 [6.8] for 
non-SNFist APs), and less likely to practice in rural areas (physicians, 9.3% vs 
25.4%; APs, 8.1% vs 20.2%). In adjusted analyses, receiving care from a SNFist 
vs non-SNFist was associated with 7% lower odds of an ACS hospitalization (odds 
ratio [OR], 0.93; 95% CI, 0.90-0.96) and 7% lower odds of an ACS ED visit (OR, 
0.93; 95% CI, 0.90-0.96). In stratified analyses, receiving care from a SNFist 
physician vs a non-SNFist physician was associated with 13% lower odds (OR, 
0.87; 95% CI, 0.83-0.90) of an ACS hospitalization and 7% lowers odds of an ACS 
ED visit (OR, 0.93, 95% CI, 0.88-0.97); comparisons of SNFist APs vs non-SNFist 
APs were not statistically significant. Estimates from the analysis including 
physicians of any specialty and APs were consistent with the primary results. 
SNFist care was associated with increased odds of in-place death.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Findings of this cohort study suggest that the use of 
SNFists by NHs may enhance the quality of care for residents with ADRD.

This research employed a multi-method strategy integrating network pharmacology, 
molecular docking, and animal experiments to investigate the therapeutic 
mechanisms of ligustilide in Alzheimer's disease (AD) management. AD-related 
targets were obtained from GeneCards, while ligustilide-associated targets were 
identified using SwissTargetPrediction. Protein interaction networks were 
constructed via the STRING database. Functional annotation and pathway 
enrichment analysis were performed using Metascape, including Gene Ontology and 
KEGG pathway analyses revealing that ligustilide modulated AD progression 
primarily by regulating the Toll-like receptor 4/nuclear factor kappa B 
(TLR4/NF-κB) signaling pathway. Molecular docking studies conducted with 
AutoDock Vina demonstrated strong binding affinities between ligustilide and key 
targets in this pathway. Behavioral evaluations, including locomotor activity 
assessment (open field test), spatial memory analysis (Morris water maze), and 
recognition memory testing (novel object recognition test) demonstrated that 
ligustilide significantly attenuated SCOP-induced cognitive deficits. 
Histopathological and biochemical analyses indicated that ligustilide maintained 
cholinergic neuron integrity and boosted antioxidant defenses in SCOP-treated 
mice. Transcriptional profiling revealed decreased expression of TLR4, NF-κB 
p65, and pro-inflammatory mediators (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) in ligustilide-treated 
AD model mice. Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) 
demonstrated reduced levels of TLR4, phosphorylated p65 (Ser536), TNF-α, IL-1β 
and IL-6 in ligustilide-treated AD model mice. These findings collectively 
demonstrate that ligustilide alleviates SCOP-induced cognitive deficits through 
suppression of the TLR4/NF-κB signaling cascade.

This study explores the potential of novel molecules that can act as copper 
chelators to treat Alzheimer's disease. Eight imines L03-10 and one 
quinoline-based compound L11 were synthesized, characterized, and evaluated as 
compounds that can act to reverse neurodegeneration in vivo. Their ability to 
extract copper from the Cu-β-amyloid complex, a key factor in Alzheimer's 
pathology, was assessed, achieving a remarkable in vitro activity for L09, L10, 
and L11. They effectively extracted it from the Cu-β-amyloid complex, which was 
confirmed using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. In silico 
studies predicted that compounds L09, L10, and L11 demonstrated favorable 
absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties, 
suggesting suitability for oral administration and blood-brain barrier 
permeability. Cellular studies showed that compounds L09 and L10 (at 
concentrations up to 500 μM) exhibited low cytotoxicity. They reduced lipid 
peroxidation and DNA damage induced by beta-amyloid oligomers at lower 
concentrations. Compound L11 showed more significant cytotoxicity but reduced 
beta-amyloid-induced DNA damage. In vivo studies (STZ-induced Alzheimer's rat 
model) proved that compound L10 significantly reduced neuroinflammation, 
oxidative stress, and restored copper homeostasis in the hippocampus. This was 
accompanied by improved spatial memory performance in the Barnes maze test. 
Compounds L09 and L11 showed less impact on these parameters. The study presents 
compelling evidence that specifically designed copper chelators could offer a 
new therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease. Compound L10 is an 
up-and-coming candidate and warrants further investigation. The detailed in 
silico, in vitro, and in vivo analyses provide a solid motivation for future 
research and drug development efforts.

Herein, we describe the synthesis of magnetic zeolitic imidazole framework 
(ZIF-8) microswimmers for detecting and quantifying the amyloid beta (Aβ1-42) 
peptide in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples, which are used as a biomarker of 
amyloidosis for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD). The microswimmers are 
prepared by external decoration of the ZIF-8 with magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles, 
followed by post internal encapsulation of quinine as fluorescent probe. The 
magnetic and surface properties of the microswimmers are fine-tuned to obtain 
tailored structures with an inner porous structure with the loaded fluorescent 
probe and outer magnetic engines. A macroporous structure was preferred over a 
microporous structure for quinine encapsulation, increasing the loading 
efficiency by about 50%, allowing also external decoration of the ferrite to 
impart the desired magnetic properties to the microswimmer. The principle for 
detection relies on the specific affinity of target sequence of amino acids in 
the Aβ1-42 peptide structure toward the Zn units in the ZIF-8, resulting in the 
self-destruction of the microswimmers and subsequent release of quinine in a 
concentration-dependent manner. The use of the bioreceptor-free magnetic 
assisted microswimmers allows for direct assessment of Aβ1-42 peptide in only 10 
μL of CSF samples in just 10 min. Excellent analytical performance with a limit 
of detection of 40 pg/mL and a linear range ranging from 140 to 1200 pg/mL (r = 
0.9990), covering the range in the clinical practice, is obtained. An excellent 
selectivity was also obtained toward the Aβ1-42 peptide which approaches an 
excellent assessment of amyloidosis in the human brain, as demonstrated by the 
good correlation obtained (r = 0.97) between the quantitative levels obtained in 
our microswimmers approach in comparison with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay method in diagnosed CSF samples from patients where Tau protein was also 
determined due to its coexistence with Aβ1-42 peptides. Since CSF biomarkers are 
currently the only clinically validated biofluid diagnostic test for AD, our 
approach will drastically reduce the volume required to determine Aβ levels, 
reducing the impact of the side effects of lumbar puncture in clinical practice. 
It became a novel bioreceptor-free approach to more easily, less invasively 
measure Aβ1-42 peptide in CSF, becoming a valuable tool for indirect amyloidosis 
prediction in brain tissues in the patient's lifetime, opening the possibility 
for early treatment of the AD.

Technology, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India.

In this study, we employed a quantitative Read-Across Structure-Activity 
Relationship (q-RASAR) approach to develop a statistically robust machine 
learning (ML)-based q-RASAR model aimed at predicting the agonistic activity of 
compounds targeting the α7-nicotinic acetylcholine (α7nACh) receptor, a key 
therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to its involvement in 
cognitive processes and neuroprotection. We developed a rigorously validated 
univariate q-RASAR linear regression (LR) model using an extensive dataset of 
1,727 structurally diverse heterocyclic and aromatic hydrocarbon compounds 
sourced from the publicly available Binding Database (www.bindingdb.org). 
Additionally, we explored various other ML-based q-RASAR models to further 
enhance predictive performance. The established LR q-RASAR model was 
subsequently applied to predict the Mcule database 
(https://mcule.com/database/), containing 1,91,94,405 chemical compounds, to 
identify structurally relevant candidates with potential α7nACh receptor 
agonistic activity. Additionally, molecular docking analysis and molecular 
dynamics (MD) simulations for 100 ns were conducted to investigate interactions 
between the target protein and ligands. Overall, this investigation highlights 
the critical influence of hydrophobicity, electronic effects, ionization degree, 
and steric factors as key determinants in the design of potential 
anti-Alzheimer's agents.

There is an urgent need for rapid, affordable diagnostics for Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), particularly those that can detect phosphorylated Tau 181 
(p-tau181)─a key biomarker─directly in plasma. We present a scalable, label-free 
electrochemical biosensor fabricated on a printed circuit board platform, 
integrating a novel nanomolecularly imprinted polymer transducer based on a 
polyphenol red-polypyrrole composite. This platform enables sensitive detection 
of p-tau181 in undiluted plasma, serum, and clinical AD samples using a 
custom-designed potentiostat and machine learning-assisted classification. The 
sensor achieves a detection limit of 498 fg mL-1, a sensitivity of 8.99 μA/pg 
mL, and an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.84 in clinical samples, 
comparable to the single molecule array (SIMOA) assay (AUC = 0.91), but at a 
fraction of the cost. This integrated platform, validated in real patient 
samples, demonstrates significant advancement toward accessible, point-of-care 
diagnostics for early AD detection.

BACKGROUND: The deposition of toxic aggregated amyloid-β (Aβ), resulting from 
continuous cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β-site APP cleaving 
enzyme 1 (BACE1) and γ-secretase, is a key pathogenic event in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). Small interfering RNAs (siRNA) have shown great potential for 
disease treatment by specifically silencing target genes. However, the poor 
brain delivery efficiency of siRNAs limits their therapeutic efficacy against 
AD.
METHODS: We designed a simplified and effective BACE1 siRNA (siBACE1) delivery 
system, namely, dendritic polyamidoamine modified with the neurotropic 
virus-derived peptide RVG29 and polyethylene glycol (PPR@siBACE1).
RESULTS: PPR@siBACE1 crossed the blood-brain barrier efficiently and entered 
brain parenchyma in large amount, with subsequent neurotropism and potential 
microglia-targeting ability. Both in vitro and in vivo studies validated the 
effective brain delivery of siBACE1 and strong BACE1 silencing efficiency. 
Treatment of AD mice with PPR@siBACE1 inhibited the production of Aβ, 
potentiated Aβ phagocytosis by microglia, improved the memory deficits and 
reduced neuroinflammatory response in AD mice.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a reliable delivery platform for gene therapies 
for AD.

Cognitive impairment and dementia in older adults represent significant global 
health challenges. Although the bidirectional relationship between physical 
function and brain health is well established, the mechanistic drivers of this 
link remain poorly understood. Muscle function and quality are central to 
physical function, and muscle's secretome is increasingly recognized for its 
systemic health effects-supporting the potential for muscle-to-brain crosstalk. 
This concept was explored at the 3rd International Research Symposium on Brain 
Health, jointly hosted by Vancouver Coastal Health and the University of British 
Columbia. We present the findings of this symposium, which reviewed the current 
state of the literature on muscle-to-brain crosstalk from multiple perspectives, 
spanning population studies to preclinical models. A key focus was the muscle 
secretome, particularly myokines and extracellular vesicles, as potential 
messengers influencing brain health. The symposium also identified critical 
takeaways and proposed next steps to further elucidate the underlying mechanisms 
of muscle-to-brain crosstalk and explore how these pathways might be harnessed 
through exercise or pharmacologic interventions to promote brain health in older 
adults.

BACKGROUND: Caregivers caring for patients with dementia could experience 
depressive symptoms, distress from patients' behavioral symptoms, and physical 
morbidities. Factors associated with a caregiving burden are complex and vary 
with time because burden is a subjective measure influenced by physical, 
economic, and psychosocial strain and has an interaction among caregiver 
resources, vulnerabilities, and care demands. The purpose of this study was to 
elucidate the association of patients' and caregivers' factors especially the 
severity of behavior and psychiatric symptoms of dementia (BPSD) and specific 
activities of daily living items impairment with a moderate or even severe 
caregiving burden.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 585 patients with dementia 
who were cared for informal caregivers and were managed by the dementia 
collaborative care team at Changhua Christian Hospital in Taiwan. Variables from 
patients with dementia included age, gender, type of dementia, clinical dementia 
rating, feeding, toilet use, bathing, mobility, getting lost, and 
Neuropsychiatric Inventory, whereas variables from caregivers consisted of age, 
relation to the patient, marital status, employment, type of primary care, 
frequency of care, and caregiving burden. The Apriori algorithm was used to find 
the association of patients' and caregivers' factors and a moderate or even 
severe caregiving burden when the minimum support and confidence were set to 1% 
and 85%, respectively, along with lift > 1.
RESULTS: One hundred and fifty rules were found for caregivers with a moderate 
to severe burden, and these rules can be further summarized into twenty general 
rules. To further explore the rules containing severe burden, the minimum 
confidence was reduced from 85 to 65%. Sixteen rules were found with a severe 
caregiving burden, and these rules were concluded into one general rule. When 
the caregiver was a spouse who solely cared for the male patient with moderate 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), the caregiver had a severe burden. Moderately severe 
BPSD was associated with a high caregiving burden than specific activities of 
daily living domain dysfunctions.
CONCLUSIONS: The severity of BPSD, severity of cognition, patients' and 
caregivers' gender, relation to the care recipient, employment, and caregiving 
load were associated with a moderate or severe burden for caregivers who cared 
for patients with dementia. A severe caregiving burden was occurred when a 
female caregiver solely took care of her spouse who had moderate AD. Suitable 
caregiving supports should be provided to female caregivers in order to reduce 
their caregiving burden.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the pathological hallmarks of 
β-amyloid deposition and Tau protein hyperphosphorylation, with memory loss and 
cognitive dysfunction as its primary clinical manifestations. The incidence of 
AD has been progressively increasing in recent years. Short-chain fatty acids 
(SCFAs), key effector molecules in host-gut microbial interactions, play a 
crucial role in maintaining central nervous system homeostasis. In this study, 
AD mouse model was established via AlCl3/D-gal induction. The effects of mixed 
SCFA intervention on spatial learning and memory in AD model mice were assessed 
using behavioral tests, including the Morris Water Maze. Levels of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines and activities of oxidative stress-related enzymes in 
brain and colon tissues were quantified using ELISA and commercial kits. Key 
protein expression levels were analyzed by Western blot, immunohistochemistry, 
and immunofluorescence. Results demonstrated that SCFAs significantly alleviated 
cognitive dysfunction in AD model, reduced Tau hyperphosphorylation at T181, 
T231 and S396 sites, suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokine release, and enhanced 
antioxidant capacity, but with no reversal in elevated Aβ levels in AD model. 
Mechanistically, SCFAs inhibited glial cell activation, upregulated MCT-1 and 
tight junction proteins in the blood-brain barrier and strengthened gut-brain 
barrier integrity, potentially regulating small molecule trans-barrier 
transport. Furthermore, examination of relevant protein expressions revealed 
that SCFAs activated HDAC1 and inhibited overexpressed HDAC3 and Keap-1 in AD 
mice model. These findings suggest that SCFAs may regulate epigenetic 
modifications in the brain of AD to exert neuroprotective effects. This study 
provides novel evidence supporting the potential of symbiotic microbe-derived 
SCFAs in alleviating AD.

Late-onset depression (LOD) is closely linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
marked by shared biological pathways and common risk factors. The 
neurobiological alterations associated with depression, particularly the 
dysregulation of amyloid-β (Aβ), play a critical role in the acceleration of 
disease progression. In individuals suffering from LOD, Aβ peptides - 
specifically Aβ40 and Aβ42 - exhibit distinct profiles in plasma, cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF), and brain tissue, highlighting the substantial influence of AD 
pathology. Central to this relationship is A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease 10 
(ADAM10), an essential α-secretase that exerts a protective effect by decreasing 
Aβ formation through the non-amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid precursor 
protein (APP). Furthermore, ADAM10 regulates the shedding of Neuronal Growth 
Regulator 1 (Negr1), a protein intricately linked to both LOD and AD, thereby 
enhancing synaptic plasticity and neuronal development - two critical processes 
in addressing these challenging disorders. Given the rapidly rising prevalence 
of both depression and dementia in aging populations, understanding these 
molecular interactions is more urgent than ever. Despite growing evidence, the 
interplay among LOD, AD, ADAM10, and Negr1 remains insufficiently explored, 
particularly in diverse populations. This review synthesizes recent advancements 
that illuminate the complex interactions among LOD, AD, and the regulatory 
function of ADAM10, particularly concerning one of its substrates, Negr1. By 
elucidating these fundamental interactions, the study paves the way for 
innovative treatment approaches aimed at both LOD and AD, advocating for a 
synergistic strategy to address these multifaceted conditions effectively, 
meeting a critical and time-sensitive challenge in global brain health.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a gradually worsening neurodegenerative condition 
marked by the accumulation of amyloid-β plaques and a decline in cognitive 
abilities. Emerging research emphasizes astrocytic metabolic disturbances as 
contributors to AD development. This study investigates the therapeutic effects 
of Verapamil (VPM), a clinically approved calcium channel blocker, on astrocytic 
glycolysis in 3 × Tg-AD mice, focusing on the involvement of the 
thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP)/glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) pathway. 
VPM treatment significantly enhanced glycolytic activity in astrocytes, as 
evidenced by increased lactate production and improved metabolic function. 
Western blot and PCR analyses revealed a reduction in TXNIP levels and an 
upregulation of GLUT1 expression, particularly in the plasma membrane fraction, 
suggesting enhanced glucose uptake and glycolysis. Additionally, VPM treatment 
decreased soluble β-amyloid (Aβ) levels and alleviated cognitive impairments in 
the 3 × Tg-AD mice. These findings indicate that VPM restores glycolytic 
function in astrocytes through the TXNIP/GLUT1 pathway, offering a promising 
intervention targeting metabolic disruption and cognitive decline in AD. This 
study underscores the critical role of glycolysis in glial cells and highlights 
VPM's therapeutic potential in AD by targeting metabolic dysfunction.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque accumulation 
and neurofibrillary tangles, leading to neuroinflammation, synaptic dysfunction, 
and cognitive decline. Despite extensive research, current therapies for AD show 
limited efficacy. Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) has emerged as a 
promising non-invasive therapeutic approach due to its neuroprotective and 
immunomodulatory properties. This study investigates the effects of LIPUS on Aβ 
pathology, neuroinflammation, and cognitive deficits in a transgenic AD mouse 
model. Twelve-month-old J20 transgenic mice expressing human amyloid precursor 
protein (APP) were used to model middle-to-late-stage AD. LIPUS was administered 
for 30 days, targeting the bilateral hippocampus. Spatial memory was assessed 
via the Morris water maze (MWM). Aβ plaque burden and synaptic integrity were 
quantified using immunofluorescence and Thioflavin-S staining. Western blot 
analysis evaluated neurotrophic factors, inflammatory markers, and synaptic 
proteins (PSD95). LIPUS treatment significantly improved spatial learning and 
memory deficits in APP transgenic mice, as evidenced by reduced escape latency 
and increased platform crossings in the MWM test. LIPUS significantly reduced 
hippocampal amyloid plaque burden and promoted microglial recruitment to Aβ 
plaques. Importantly, LIPUS downregulated TNF-α expression without affecting 
IL-6 levels, suggesting enhanced Aβ clearance without inducing 
neuroinflammation. Furthermore, LIPUS increased synaptophysin expression in the 
CA3-mossy fiber and dentate gyrus (DG) regions, while PSD95 levels remained 
unchanged. Our findings demonstrate that LIPUS enhances microglial-mediated Aβ 
clearance, preserves synaptic integrity, and improves cognitive function in a 
transgenic AD model. As a non-invasive modality capable of targeting deep brain 
structures, LIPUS holds promise as a potential therapeutic strategy for AD.

Tau aggregation inhibitors or neurotoxic-metal chelators have been extensively 
studied as potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease. However, it is a great 
challenge to improve their therapeutic effects while reducing neurotoxicity. 
Herein, we designed and synthesized two new compounds, 
(1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetrayl)tetrakis((3,4,5-trihydroxyphenyl)methanone) 
(4GA) and 
(4,10-dimethyl-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,7-diyl)bis((3,4,5-trihydroxyphenyl)methanone) 
(2GA). Each molecule is composed of a 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane (cyclen) 
core as the supramolecular chelator to copper ions, attached by 2 or 4GAllic 
acid polyphenol arms to capture tau peptide chain like a molecular hairpin. We 
interestingly found that 4GA and 2GA could inhibit self-aggregation through 
blocking the misfolding of tau peptide, suppress the promotion of Cu2+ on tau 
aggregation by removing Cu2+ from dyshomeostasis, and clear reactive oxygen 
species triggered by Cu2+ using their reductive gallic acid groups. More 
significantly, the synthesized compounds exhibit remarkable efficiency on both 
in vitro and at cellular level. Our rational design of multifunctional 
therapeutic agent that simultaneously targets tau misfolding process, copper 
dyshomeostasis, and oxidative stress of reactive oxygen species, may hold 
considerable implications for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

Cannabidiol (CBD) has gained a lot of interest in recent years for its purported 
medicinal properties. CBD has been investigated for the treatment of anxiety, 
depression, epilepsy, neuroinflammation, and pain. Recently there has been an 
interest in CBD as a possible treatment for age-related disorders such as 
Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (ADRD). Here we tested the hypothesis 
that chronic CBD administration would improve learning and memory in the SAMP8 
mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. SAMP8 mice aged 11 months (at the start of 
the study) were administered vehicle or CBD (3 or 30 mg/Kg) daily via oral 
gavage for 2 months. Vehicle-treated young SAMP8 mice (age 3 months at the start 
of the study) served as unimpaired controls. After 30 days of treatment (4 and 
12 months of age), learning and memory, activity, anxiety, strength and 
dexterity were assessed. High dose CBD treatment significantly improved learning 
and memory of the 12-month-old mice in the T maze. Novel object recognition 
memory was also improved by CBD in aged CBD treated mice. Aged CBD treated mice 
also displayed less anxiety in the elevated plus maze test compared to controls. 
However, activity and strength levels were similar between groups. Biochemical 
analysis revealed decreased markers of oxidative stress, providing a possible 
mechanism by which CBD treatment impacts learning, memory, and anxiety. These 
results highlight the potential use of CBD as a therapeutic for age related 
cognitive impairment and dementia.

About 30% to 40% of the general population experiences insomnia symptoms of 
difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, and another 10% to 15% of the 
general population experiences chronic insomnia disorder. The prevalence of 
insomnia is disproportionately higher in people with cardiometabolic risk 
factors, cardiovascular diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, and neurocognitive 
disorders, including vascular cognitive impairment. In fact, recent 
meta-analytic evidence from epidemiological studies has demonstrated that 
insomnia, especially when accompanied by objective short sleep duration, is a 
risk factor for incident hypertension, type 2 diabetes, heart failure, stroke, 
cognitive impairment, Alzheimer disease, and all-cause mortality. Insomnia 
should, thus, be part of the prevention and management of these adverse health 
outcomes. However, randomized clinical trials have not demonstrated whether 
treatment with cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia, the first-line 
guideline-recommended treatment, or hypnotics/sedatives improves heart- or 
brain-related outcomes. Studies have also failed to consider insomnia a 
heterogeneous disorder consisting of distinct phenotypes that result from the 
relative contribution of biological versus cognitive-behavioral perpetuating 
factors. Objective short sleep duration has emerged as a marker of physiological 
hyperarousal in insomnia (ie, dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, 
increased sympathetic nervous system activation, and increased inflammation), as 
a predictor of insomnia-related adverse heart and brain health outcomes and, 
potentially, poor response to cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia. This 
review summarizes the meta-analytic evidence on the association of insomnia with 
cardiometabolic risk factors, cardiovascular diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, 
and neurocognitive disorders, including current knowledge on the heterogeneity 
of the disorder. This review also summarizes the potential pathophysiologic 
mechanisms that lead to heart and brain morbidity, which vary across insomnia 
phenotypes based on objective sleep duration. This review suggests that basic 
and clinical sciences need to unveil the molecular, cellular, and behavioral 
mechanisms at play across insomnia phenotypes, as the public health and clinical 
implications of their association with adverse heart and brain health are 
demanding immediate attention.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a deteriorating neurodegenerative disorder defined 
by cognitive decline and neuronal damage, with oxidative stress and 
neuroinflammation as central pathological features. Emerging evidence suggests 
the gut-brain axis is a key modulator in neurodegeneration, highlighting 
probiotics' potential in mitigating AD progression. This study investigates the 
effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC4356, Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938, 
and their combination on cognitive performance, oxidative stress, and 
hippocampal structure in a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced AD-like rat model. 
Thirty-Five male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to five groups: 
Sham, AD-like model (STZ), STZ + Ac, STZ + Re, and STZ + Comb. The AD-like model 
was induced via intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of STZ. Probiotics were 
administered by gavage for 35 days. Behavioral assessments, including the open 
field test and Morris water maze, were conducted to evaluate cognitive and 
anxiety-like behaviors. Hippocampal oxidative stress markers, including 
malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and catalase , were 
analyzed biochemically. Additionally, stereological techniques were used to 
assess hippocampal volume and cellular densities. Behavioral results 
demonstrated significant improvement in anxiety-like behavior and spatial memory 
in probiotic-treated groups compared to the STZ group. Biochemical analysis 
revealed reduced MDA levels and enhanced antioxidant markers following probiotic 
intervention. Histological and stereological analyses indicated increased 
neuronal density and reduced glial cell activation in hippocampal subregions 
(CA1, CA3, DG), though hippocampal volume loss remained unaltered. These 
findings underscore the neuroprotective potential of probiotics in alleviating 
AD-related neurodegeneration, possibly through antioxidative and 
anti-inflammatory mechanisms. Further pre-clinical studies are warranted to 
optimize probiotic regimens for AD prevention and treatment.

Amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, primarily Aβ40 and Aβ42, are central to the 
formation of amyloid plaques, a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). These peptides, derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP), are 
aggregation prone and neurotoxic. Experimental studies aimed at understanding Aβ 
aggregation and interaction require pure, monomeric peptides with the native 
sequences, including the absence of an N-terminal methionine. We present an 
optimized protocol for producing recombinant human Aβ40 and Aβ42 using a SUMO 
fusion system in Escherichia coli. Cleavage of the SUMO tag enables recovery of 
native-sequence peptides, producing physiologically relevant monomers with high 
yield and purity. This method eliminates the need for chemical synthesis and 
offers a reliable and cost-effective approach to producing recombinant Aβ 
suitable for aggregation studies, structural analyses, and interaction assays. 
The resulting peptides closely mimic endogenous Aβ, facilitating accurate models 
of Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis and supporting future therapeutics 
development. © 2025 The Author(s). Current Protocols published by Wiley

INTRODUCTION: We investigated associations of plasma proteins with blood-based 
amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration/inflammation (A/T/N/I) biomarkers for Alzheimer's 
disease (AD).
METHODS: Plasma proteomics and clinical data from the Indiana AD Research Center 
(N = 498) were used. Association analysis of plasma proteins with blood A/T/N/I 
biomarkers as well as diagnosis was performed, followed by replication in an 
independent cohort (N = 323), network analysis, pathway enrichment, and machine 
learning classification to identify proteins and pathways related to AD risk.
RESULTS: We identified 35 proteins associated with AD, 20 of which were 
replicated in the independent cohort. We identified 150, 448, and 219 proteins 
associated with T/N/I biomarkers, respectively, revealing biomarker-specific 
pathways. Network analysis identified two modules associated with T/N/I 
biomarkers, preserved in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and their enriched pathways. 
The classification model of proteins effectively differentiated AD (area under 
the curve [AUC] = 0.930).
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest dysregulated plasma proteins and pathways in 
AD, enhancing our understanding of molecular mechanisms and diagnostic 
strategies for AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: Plasma proteins were identified as being associated with Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) and plasma biomarkers. The identified proteins were replicated in 
both plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomics. The identified proteins 
were associated with AD biomarker-specific pathways. The identified proteins 
improved the performance of the AD classification. Protein network analysis

Caregivers of individuals with dementia often face the dual challenge of 
managing dementia alongside sensory impairments (hearing and/or vision loss). 
Despite the significant burden, this issue remains underexplored, with existing 
research largely overlooking the impact of sensory impairments on caregivers' 
experiences. This systematic review examines the challenges and needs of 
caregivers managing both conditions. A comprehensive literature search across 
three databases identified 12 studies published before May 2024 in five 
countries. The review revealed that caregivers face increased challenges when 
managing both dementia and sensory impairments. Unmet needs, particularly in 
accessing tailored support and assistive technologies, were prevalent. 
Multidisciplinary care and interventions are crucial to address both cognitive 
and sensory needs. To improve the quality of life for caregivers and sensory 
impaired dementia patients, comprehensive support systems, enhanced caregiver 
education, and better access to affordable assistive technologies are essential. 
Addressing these disparities is critical for providing effective care. 
HIGHLIGHTS: This review focuses on informal caregiving for people with dementia 
and sensory loss. Caregivers face increased challenges due to managing both 
dementia and sensory impairments. There are additive implications of caring for 
people with dual impairments. Further research is needed on interventions to 
support this caregiver population.

Microglia (MG) are immune effector cells in the central nervous system (CNS) and 
play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of various CNS diseases. Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) is defined as a severe chronic degenerative neurological disease in 
humans. The amyloid cascade hypothesis is a hypothesis on the pathogenesis of AD 
that suggests that abnormal extracellular aggregation of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides 
is the main cause of the disease. Although this hypothesis has been found to be 
convincing, a growing body of evidence suggests that it does not fully explain 
the pathogenesis of AD. Neuroinflammation is a crucial element in the 
pathogenesis of AD, as evidenced by elevated levels of inflammatory markers and 
the identification of AD risk genes associated with innate immune function. This 
paper will first summarize the impact of microglia-mediated neuroinflammation on 
AD, exploring the phenotypic changes that follow microglia activation. Secondly, 
the interactions between microglia, Aβ, microtubule-associated protein, 
apolipoprotein E and neurons are thoroughly investigated, with particular focus 
on the interactive mechanisms. Furthermore, the recent progress and prospects of 
microglia as a diagnostic and therapeutic target for AD are analysed. A review 
of the literature on the mechanisms regulating MG for AD at home and abroad 
revealed that acupuncture modulation of microglia could help to delay the 
progression of AD. This was followed by an extensive discussion of the clinical 
possibilities and scientific validity of acupuncture treatment for AD, with the 
aim of providing new insights for acupuncture modulation of MG targeting for the 
treatment of AD.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely used diagnostic tool for 
neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. A gadolinium chelate 
conjugated with vanillic acid (Gd-DO3A-Va) serves as a contrast agent that 
specifically targets activated microglia in the brains of Alzheimer's disease 
animal models, such as the 5XFAD mouse. In this study, we evaluated the 
therapeutic potential of Gd-DO3A-Va in this model. The 5XFAD mouse exhibits 
neuroinflammation, characterized by activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase 
signaling pathway, inflammasome activation, and increased amyloid-β (Aβ) 
productionall of which are pathological features of Alzheimer's disease. 
Treatment with Gd-DO3A-Va reduced inflammatory responses and Aβ deposits. 
Additionally, the peri-plaque dendritic loss observed in the brains of 5XFAD 
mice was attenuated following Gd-DO3A-Va treatment. Moreover, Gd-DO3A-Va 
treatment prevented memory loss, as indicated by the Y-maze test. Taken 
together, these findings suggest that Gd-DO3A-Va, an MR contrast agent that 
provides disease-specific signal enhancement in the brains of animal models of 
Alzheimer's disease, shows promising therapeutic potential for preventing 
disease progression by suppressing inflammation and inhibiting Aβ production. 
Therefore, Gd-DO3A-Va could serve as a theranostic agent for Alzheimer's 
disease.

Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, 
and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, present considerable challenges for our 
societies and health systems due to their progressive nature, the demographic 
shift toward older populations, and limited treatment options. Recent advances 
in macromolecular therapeutics, including antibodies, peptides, and proteins, 
offer novel therapeutic modalities for a broad range of diseases. Their high 
potency and specificity hold promise for disease-modifying therapies to combat 
neurodegenerative diseases. However, the blood-brain barrier poses a significant 
challenge for the effective delivery of these large molecules to the central 
nervous system. This review discusses the physiological role of the blood-brain 
barrier and its influence on restricting the exposure of macromolecules in the 
brain. Furthermore, emerging strategies for enhancing blood-brain barrier 
permeability to macromolecules are highlighted. This review summarizes 
modifications designed to utilize receptor-mediated uptake, adsorptive-mediated 
transcytosis, carrier-mediated transport, and nanoparticle-based delivery 
systems to overcome the blood-brain barrier. Additionally, we emphasize the 
importance of testing macromolecular therapeutics for their blood-brain barrier 
permeability and review the methods for such in vitro and in vivo testing. 
Finally, we shed light on therapeutics in preclinical and clinical development 
for neurodegenerative diseases and their challenges.

OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the effect of 0.2 % chlorhexidine gluconate 
on oral microbiota dysbiosis in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and explored potential 
links between oral microbiota and cognition, offering new insights into its role 
in AD treatment.
STUDY DESIGN: We assessed the impact of 0.2 % chlorhexidine gluconate on the 
oral microbiota of patients with AD. One hundred patients were divided into two 
groups based on oral health score (using a cut-off of 8). Subgingival plaque 
samples were analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing; no significant differences in 
bacterial composition were observed between groups at baseline.
RESULTS: Poor oral health correlated with higher oral health scores (P = 0.000), 
fewer teeth (P = 0.002), lower cognitive levels (P = 0.048), and a higher 
proportion of patients with diabetes (P = 0.032). After 24 weeks of treatment 
with 0.2 % chlorhexidine gluconate in a randomized controlled trial, subgingival 
plaques from 66 patients showed changes in Porphyromonas, Filifactor, 
Desulfobulbus, Anaeroglobus, Pyramidobacter, Mycoplasma, Dialister, 
Fretibacterium, and Tannerella (P < 0.05). Treponema and Porphyromonas 
gingivalis were identified as potential interventional targets.
CONCLUSION: Chlorhexidine gluconate effectively alters oral flora, reducing 
harmful bacteria. Targeting specific microbiota disturbances may offer a 
promising strategy to delay AD onset or slow its progression.

Bone is a common site of breast cancer metastasis, with the spine showing a 
particularly high affinity. An 83-year-old Japanese woman with Alzheimer's 
disease presented with a palpable mass in her left breast. A needle biopsy 
revealed invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast, hormone receptor-positive, 
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, with lymph node 
metastasis. Chest dynamic computed tomography showed no distant metastases. She 
was diagnosed with luminal-type, stage IIB (T2N1M0) breast cancer and underwent 
surgery. During induction of general anesthesia, intubation was difficult due to 
airway edema, necessitating bronchoscopy. The day after surgery, she reported 
neck pain, and radiography revealed a compression fracture of the third cervical 
vertebra. Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed a metastatic lesion in the third 
cervical vertebra. Postoperatively, she received endocrine therapy with 
letrozole, radiation therapy with zoledronic acid, and a cervical collar for 
cervical metastases. Seven months later, the osteolytic lesion calcified, and 
her pain improved. This case is unique because solitary cervical vertebral 
metastases from breast cancer, leading to compression fractures and airway 
edema, are rare. The case highlights the importance of considering cervical 
metastases in patients with breast cancer who develop airway difficulties or 
unexplained neck pain, particularly in the perioperative setting. Early 
recognition and intervention are crucial for preventing complications and 
optimizing patient outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a common form of dementia with no 
approved pharmacological treatment. Clinical and experimental evidence suggest 
that dopaminergic transmission is impaired in FTD. Here we aimed at 
investigating the clinical impact of treatment with dopaminergic agonists in 
FTD.
METHODS: This was a phase IIa 24-week randomized, double-blind, multicenter, 
placebo-controlled study, conducted in Italy from June 16th 2021 to April 30th 
2023. Patients with a diagnosis of probable behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD) were 
randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive rotigotine transdermal patches at 
4 mg/24 h, rotigotine transdermal patches at 6 mg/24 h, or placebo transdermal 
patches for 24 weeks. Randomization was centralized and performed using a 
double-blind covariate-adaptive scheme. The primary outcome was analyzed in the 
intention-to treat (ITT) population. The primary efficacy outcome measure was 
the change at 24-weeks from baseline in the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB). 
The trial is completed and was registered on the clinicaltrial.gov website 
(NCT04937452).
FINDINGS: A total of 128 patients were screened, of which 75 were randomized. 25 
patients were randomized to receive Rotigotine 4 mg, 26 patients to Rotigotine 6 
mg, and 24 patients to placebo. The mean age of patients was 66.5 ± 8 of which 
31 (41%) were female. A total of 69 patients (92%) completed the study. The 
estimated mean change from baseline at 24 weeks in the FAB score in the ITT 
population was 0.18 (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.79 to 1.15) in the 
rotigotine 4 mg group, 0.89 (95% CI -0.09 to 1.88) in the rotigotine 6 mg group 
and 1.08 (95% CI 0.19-1.98) in the placebo group (rotigotine 4 mg vs placebo, 
-0.90; 95% CI -2.22 to 0.42; p = 0.18; rotigotine 6 mg vs placebo, -0.19; 95% CI 
-1.52 to 1.14; p = 0.77). No significant effect was found on secondary outcome 
measures. Adverse events were mild in all groups and more common in the 
rotigotine (4 mg: 4/25; 6 mg: 3/26) than in the placebo (1/24) group.
INTERPRETATION: Rotigotine administration may not be a viable therapeutic option 
for enhancing frontal function, slowing disease progression, mitigating 
functional decline or ameliorating behavioral disturbances in bvFTD patients. 
The current findings provide data in a large sample of bvFTD that might be 
useful for the design of future clinical trials.
FUNDING: This trial was funded by a joint grant from the Alzheimer Drug 
Discovery Foundation (ADDF) and the Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration 
(AFTD) grant to GK and BB (GFTD-201902-2017958).

Psychedelic compounds have demonstrated remarkable therapeutic potential for 
treating neuropsychiatric disorders by promoting sustained neuroplasticity in 
the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Cognitive flexibility-the ability to adapt 
previously learned rules to novel situations-represents a critical PFC function 
that is frequently impaired in depression, PTSD, and neurodegenerative 
conditions. In this study, we demonstrate that a single administration of the 
selective serotonin 2A receptor agonist 25CN-NBOH produces significant, 
long-lasting improvements in cognitive flexibility in both male and female mice 
when measured 2-3 weeks posttreatment. Using a novel automated sequential 
learning paradigm, psychedelic-treated mice showed superior adaptability in rule 
reversal tasks compared to saline controls, as evidenced by enhanced poke 
efficiency, higher percentages of correct trials, and increased reward 
acquisition. These behavioral findings complement existing cellular research 
showing psychedelic-induced structural remodeling in the PFC and uniquely 
demonstrate sustained cognitive benefits persisting weeks after a single 
psychedelic dose. Our automated behavioral task provides a high-throughput 
method for evaluating cognitive flexibility effects of various psychedelic 
compounds, offering important implications for therapeutic applications in 
conditions characterized by cognitive rigidity, including depression, PTSD, and 
potentially Alzheimer's disease.

The hypothesis that insulin resistance and impaired insulin-like growth factor 
signaling contribute to Alzheimer's disease (AD) has led to the designation of 
AD as "type 3 diabetes." Ajuga chamaepitys subsp. chia is traditionally used in 
Türkiye as an analgesic, tonic, and for the external treatment of hemorrhoids 
and wound healing. This study evaluates antioxidant, antidiabetic, and 
anticholinesterase activities of methanolic, aqueous extracts, and essential 
oils from the flowering aerial parts of A. chamaepitys subsp. chia, along with 
their phytochemical profiles (GC-MS/MS), morphological-anatomical 
characteristics, and molecular docking analysis. The essential oil yield was 
0.002%, comprising 45 compounds (92.5%), with β-pinene (19.8%), α-pinene 
(12.8%), and germacrene D (10.0%) as major constituents, dominated by 
monoterpene (39.8%) and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (23.5%). The methanolic 
extract exhibited moderate bioactivity, achieving 28.36% α-amylase inhibition at 
5000 μg/mL and 21.85% acetylcholinesterase inhibition at 100 μg/mL, while also 
demonstrating notable antioxidant activity with 23.013% ABTS•+ and 8.114% DPPH• 
scavenging. It showed the highest total phenolic (14.261 μg GAE/mg) and tannin 
content (34.444 μg TAE/mg) among the tested extracts. Morphologically, the plant 
features hairy stems and tripartite leaves with a cuticle, trichomes, and 
diacytic stomata, while anatomically, it presents collenchyma, starch-filled 
parenchyma, and a distinct cambium in the stem. Molecular docking studies 
revealed that germacrene D exhibited strong binding affinities to 
acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, α-amylase, and α-glucosidase, 
suggesting multitarget inhibition potential. These findings support the 
traditional use of A. chamaepitys subsp. chia and highlight its promise as a 
natural source for therapeutic agents targeting oxidative stress, diabetes, and 
neurodegenerative diseases.

BackgroundDementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a common degenerative dementia, but 
no studies investigate bereaved caregiver experiences.ObjectiveTo investigate 
the experiences of caregivers three months after the death of persons with DLB 
using a mixed-methods approach.MethodsDyads of individuals with 
moderate-advanced DLB and their primary informal caregivers were followed 
prospectively every 6 months until the person with DLB died. Caregivers 
completed a study visit with questionnaires and a semi-structured interview ∼3 
months later. Spearman correlation coefficients and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests 
evaluated the relationships of post-death measures with pre-death patient and 
caregiver variables. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the 
interviews.ResultsSeventy-three caregivers completed visits (mean 3.5 months 
post-death). Most of the caregivers were women (82.2%) and spouses (76.7%) or 
adult children (17.8%). Over 40% had scores indicating risk for clinical 
depression. Post-death caregiver experiences (depression, quality of life, 
grief, resilience) correlated with pre-death caregiver experiences. Post-death 
experiences did not associate with patient characteristics, disease-related 
symptoms, or healthcare services used in the last 6 months of life. Trajectories 
for caregiver measures from pre- to post-death visits varied widely. Interview 
themes included grief and sadness, anger, guilt and regret, relief, 
appreciation/gratitude, and adjusting to a new normal.ConclusionsThe finding 
that pre-death caregiving experiences have the strongest association with 
post-death experiences emphasizes the critical importance of accessible and 
evidence-based caregiver support before and after the death of a person with 
DLB. Research is needed to develop interventions for current and bereaved 
caregivers of individuals with DLB.Trial registration informationNCT04829656

The neuroprotective role of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) 
has attracted considerable interest. The purpose of this study was to 
investigate the role of SGLT2i in several common neurodegenerative diseases 
(NDs), including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis (ALS), and multiple sclerosis (MS). Utilizing drug-target 
Mendelian randomization (MR) and colocalization, we used single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) proximal to the SLC5A2 gene to analyze the influence of 
SGLT2i on AD, PD, ALS, and MS. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess 
heterogeneity and pleiotropy. Phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) was used 
to probe the relationship of SGLT2i with other characteristics. Protein-protein 
interaction (PPI) networks were used to explore how SLC5A2 affects other 
proteins, and enrichment analysis was used to explore possible biological 
processes. The MR analysis showed that SGLT2i was negatively associated with AD 
(OR = 0.77, p = 0.01), PD (OR = 0.52, p = 0.04), ALS (OR = 0.60, p = 0.01), and 
MS (OR = 0.33, p = 0.027), indicating that SGLT2i could reduce the risk of AD by 
23%, PD by 48%, ALS by 40%, and MS by 67%. The colocalization supported this 
conclusion. The PheWAS showed that SGLT2i was associated with body mass index 
and systolic blood pressure. SGLT2i is biologically closely related to the 
development of NDs. This study suggested that SGLT2i was able to reduce the risk 
of NDs. SGLT2i may perform this process through many mechanisms. This study 
provides a new perspective on the treatment of NDs; clinical trials and relevant 
experiments are necessary to further validate the neuroprotective effects of 
SGLT2i.

Neurodegenerative diseases are increasing in prevalence due largely to aging 
populations worldwide and improved medical care for the elderly. Currently 
approved drugs can reduce some of the symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases but 
cannot cure them. Inflammation is involved in the development and progression of 
neurodegenerative diseases, and oxidative stress is implicated in 
neurodegeneration associated with cognitive decline and age-related cognitive 
impairment. Polyphenols such as curcumin, quercetin, and resveratrol possess 
potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Nanoformulations of 
curcumin and quercetin can optimize their pharmacological effects in the 
treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Nanocarriers play a crucial role in 
delivering drugs across the blood-brain barrier, thereby lowering the risk of 
peripheral side effects. Various nanoforms have been developed to induce 
bioavailability and solubility of curcumin and quercetin, including 
nanoparticles and nanoemulsions. The studies reviewed included 17 using curcumin 
nanoformulations and seven with quercetin nanoformulations and were tested in 
widely used animal models of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, 
Huntington's disease, and multiple sclerosis. Many of the curcumin and quercetin 
nanoformulations brought about improvements in learning and memory in behavioral 
tests of Alzheimer's disease models and were effective in reducing oxidative 
stress in the brain. Both nanocurcumin and nanoquercetin decreased the levels of 
inflammatory markers in the brain. Nanocurcumin formulations improved motor 
behavior, gait, and memory in Parkinson's disease models and increased 
dopaminergic neurons in the striatum and substantia nigra. Furthermore, 
nanocurcumin improved locomotor activity, memory, and learning, and the number 
of dendrites of medium spiny neurons in Huntington's disease models. 
Nanocurcumin formulations decreased oxidative stress and inflammation in a model 
of demyelination. Several important limitations were identified in the studies 
reviewed and these need to be considered in future studies. Also, clinical 
trials could be performed using the currently available nanoforms of curcumin 
and quercetin.

Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that leads to progressive 
memory loss, cognitive decline, and behavioral changes. Despite ongoing 
research, its exact causes and effective treatments remain elusive. Traditional 
approaches have focused on symptom management, but breakthroughs in 
bioinformatics and high-throughput drug screening are offering new pathways to 
potential therapies. This review highlights our recent efforts to identify novel 
drug candidates for Alzheimer's disease by leveraging computational methods and 
large-scale biological datasets. Our work introduces two key innovations in 
Alzheimer's disease research: addressing sex-specific differences and leveraging 
drug repurposing for accelerated treatment discovery. By combining 
sex-stratified preclinical data with machine learning and in vivo validation, we 
improve translational relevance and support precision medicine. Using the 
TgF344-AD rat model, which mimics human Alzheimer's disease spatial memory 
deficits and pathology, we explored the efficacy of various US Food and Drug 
Administration- approved and investigational drugs. These included ibudilast, 
timapiprant, RG2833, diazoxide/ dibenzoylmethane (combined), and BT-11, which 
targeted key Alzheimer's disease-related molecular pathways such as amyloid-beta 
plaques, Tau tangles, and neuroinflammation. These drugs, at various stages of 
development, offer hope for not only managing symptoms but also addressing the 
underlying mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease. This review underscores the need 
for a multifaceted approach to Alzheimer's disease treatment, combining symptom 
relief with disease modification.

Alzheimer's disease is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder affecting 
millions worldwide, with current treatments offering only limited benefits. 
Central to emerging research is the role of autophagy and endolysosomal 
pathways, which are essential for clearing misfolded proteins and damaged 
organelles. Bridging integrator 1 (BIN1), traditionally recognized for its role 
in membrane remodeling and endocytosis, has recently emerged as a top genetic 
risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, linking cellular clearance mechanisms to 
the development of toxic amyloid-beta plaques and tau tangles. In this review, 
we provide an accessible overview of how disruptions in autophagy and 
endolysosomal trafficking contribute to the neurodegeneration process in 
Alzheimer's disease, positioning BIN1 as a central mediator within this complex 
network. Recent advances have shown that alterations in BIN1 expression and 
isoform distribution are associated with increased tau pathology and changes in 
amyloid-beta processing. Moreover, BIN1 appears to also influence synaptic 
transmission, neuroinflammation, and overall cellular homeostasis. The 
integration of recent findings not only deepens our understanding of Alzheimer's 
disease pathology but also opens new avenues for the development of targeted 
treatments. This timely perspective underscores the potential of modulating BIN1 
activity to enhance cellular clearance mechanisms and offers hope for more 
effective interventions for Alzheimer's disease.

BackgroundIn the past decade, Alzheimer's disease (AD) researchers have found 
that the formation of amyloid aggregates occurs after dysregulation of 
respiratory chain activity.ObjectiveUsing our developing mathematical model to 
identify potential therapeutic targets for AD treatment.MethodsWe have 
constructed a mathematical model for AD that incorporates enzyme activities and 
kinetics, and protein and mRNA expression levels.ResultsOur analyses of gene 
expression in AD brains provide complimentary evidence that changes in 
mitochondrial energy production and biogenesis accompany AD pathogenesis. Using 
this data, we created a mitochondrial model of electron transport chain 
supercomplex assembly.ConclusionsBy carrying out sensitivity analyses of 
responses to oxidative stress and effects of gene expression on energy 
production, we demonstrate how oxidative stress and energy deficits change the 
initial antioxidant defense system and impact the progression of AD. We 
investigated the impact of gene expression changes in 9 genes as new therapeutic 
options via metabolic flux analysis of supercomplex assembly. Through careful 
analysis, we propose that UQCRC1 may be an effective therapy option for in vitro 
AD treatment testing.

Brain related disorders are a set of medical ailments that cause motor 
incoordination, cognitive and memory problems due to neurodegeneration in the 
brain. Although current therapies alleviate symptoms, they fail to target the 
fundamental pathological processes driving the disorders. A hematopoietic growth 
factor, Erythropoietin, stimulates erythroid cell formation and is 
therapeutically applied for the treatment of anemia. Furthermore, Erythropoietin 
has shown improved neurological outcomes in preclinical models and is being 
investigated as a potential therapeutic agent for neurodegenerative disorders. 
Erythropoietin is potential target for the regulation of numerous cellular 
signal pathways to enhance the neuronal survival, promote neuronal 
differentiation via binding of Erythropoietin-to-Erythropoietin receptor to 
stimulate the protein Janus-tyrosine kinase 2 followed by regulation of protein 
kinase B, signal transducer and stimulators of transcription 5, protein tyrosine 
phosphatases, mitogen-activated protein kinases, nuclear factor kB and Wnt1. 
Numerous research studies have evaluated the therapeutic potential of 
Erythropoietin against several neurological disorders including Alzheimer's 
disease, Parkinson's disease, neuroinflammation and epilepsy and highlight that 
Erythropoietin exhibits significant neuroprotective effects by counteracting 
apoptosis, neuroinflammatory process, reactive oxygen species overburden and 
neuronal death, consequently, prevent the progression of such diseases. However, 
two major challenges in developing erythropoietin as a neuroprotective agent 
include optimizing its therapeutic window and addressing safety concerns, 
particularly its adverse interaction with tissue plasminogen activator, which 
has been shown to increase the risk of hemorrhagic complications in ischemic 
stroke patients. In present review, we discuss the neurotherapeutic applications 
of Erythropoietin against brain related disorders beyond erythropoiesis. In 
conclusion, it can be assumed that Erythropoietin could be an alternative 
therapeutic option for the management of neurological disorders.

Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, 
Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis remain incurable. 
Current therapeutic strategies primarily focus on slowing disease progression, 
alleviating symptoms, and improving patients' quality of life, including the 
management of comorbid conditions. Over the past few decades, the incidence of 
diagnosed neurodegenerative disorders has risen significantly. As the number of 
affected individuals continues to grow, so does the urgent need for effective 
treatments that can halt or mitigate the progression of these diseases. Among 
the most promising therapeutic resources are bioactive compounds derived from 
fungi. The high quality of proteins, polysaccharides, unsaturated fatty acids, 
triterpenoids, sterols, and secondary metabolites found in fungi have attracted 
growing interest from researchers across multiple disciplines. One intensively 
studied direction involves the use of naturally occurring fungi-derived 
nutraceuticals in the treatment of various diseases, including neurodegenerative 
conditions. This article provides an overview of recent findings on fungal 
compounds-such as phenolic compounds, carbohydrates, peptides and proteins, and 
lipids-that may have potential applications in the treatment of 
neurodegenerative diseases and the alleviation of their symptoms.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the main causes of dementia, with an 
exponential increment in its incidence as years go by. However, since 
pathophysiological mechanisms are complex and multifactorial, therapeutic 
strategies remain inconclusive and only provide symptomatic relief to patients. 
In order to solve this problem, new strategies have been investigated over 
recent years for AD treatment. This field has been reborn due to epidemiological 
and preclinical findings that demonstrate the fact that omega-3 polyunsaturated 
fatty acids (ω-3 PUFAs) can be promising therapeutic agents because of their 
anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neurogenic-promoting activities, thus 
allowing us to classify these molecules as neuroprotectors. Similarly, ω-3 PUFAs 
perform important actions in the formation of characteristic AD lesions, 
amyloid-β plaques (Aβ) and neurofibrillary tangles, reducing the development of 
these structures. Altogether, the aforementioned actions hinder cognitive 
decline and possibly reduce AD development. In addition, ω-3 PUFAs modulate the 
inflammatory response by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory molecules 
and promoting the synthesis of specialised pro-resolving mediators. 
Consequently, the present review assesses the mechanisms by which ω-3 PUFAs can 
act as therapeutic molecules and the effectiveness of their use in patients. 
Clinical evidence so far has shown promising results on ω-3 PUFA effects, both 
in animal and epidemiological studies, but remains contradictory in clinical 
trials. More research on these molecules and their neuroprotective effects in AD 
is needed, as well as the establishment of future guidelines to obtain more 
reproducible results on this matter.

Tau protein is essential for the structural stability of neurons, particularly 
through its role in microtubule assembly and axonal transport. However, when 
abnormally hyperphosphorylated or cleaved, Tau can aggregate into insoluble 
forms that disrupt neuronal function, contributing to the pathogenesis of 
neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Emerging evidence 
suggests that similar Tau-related alterations may occur in individuals with 
chronic exposure to psychoactive substances. This review compiles experimental, 
clinical, and postmortem findings that collectively indicate a 
substance-specific influence on Tau dynamics. Alcohol and opioids, for instance, 
promote Tau hyperphosphorylation and fragmentation through the activation of 
kinases such as GSK-3β and CDK5, as well as proteases like caspase-3, leading to 
neuroinflammation and microglial activation. Stimulants and dissociatives 
disrupt insulin signaling, increase oxidative stress, and impair endosomal 
trafficking, all of which can exacerbate Tau pathology. In contrast, 
cannabinoids and psychedelics may exert protective effects by modulating kinase 
activity, reducing inflammation, or enhancing neuroplasticity. Psychedelic 
compounds such as psilocybin and harmine have been demonstrated to decrease Tau 
phosphorylation and facilitate cognitive restoration in animal models. Although 
the molecular mechanisms differ across substances, Tau consistently emerges as a 
convergent target altered in substance-related cognitive disorders. 
Understanding these pathways may provide not only mechanistic insights into 
drug-induced neurotoxicity but also identify Tau as a valuable biomarker and 
potential therapeutic target for the prevention or treatment of cognitive 
decline associated with substance use.

Neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), are a growing 
problem in aging society. The amyloid cascade hypothesis has recently been 
questioned, and therapies based on it have not yielded the expected results. 
However, the role of amyloid-β (Aβ) in AD pathogenesis cannot be rejected. It 
appears that some of the key players in the pathogenesis of the disease are the 
soluble amyloid-β oligomers. Soluble amyloid-β oligomers have neurotoxic effects 
by disrupting intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and impairing mitochondrial 
function. The glymphatic system is an important pathway for the removal of 
soluble amyloid forms from the brain. The decline in the activity of this system 
is observed in aging brains, which is correlated with the occurrence of 
Alzheimer's disease, primarily among the elderly population. Therefore, the 
question arises as to whether the glymphatic system could be another potential 
target for therapeutic interventions in Alzheimer's disease. In this regard, it 
is imperative to pay attention to the factors that contribute to the 
pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and also impact the glymphatic system, such 
as sleep, physical activity, alcohol consumption, and supplementation with 
polyunsaturated fatty acids. The question remains whether the glymphatic system 
will become the key to treating Alzheimer's disease.

The Redox Revolution in Brain Medicine: Targeting Oxidative Stress with AI, 
Multi-Omics and Mitochondrial Therapies for the Precision Eradication of 
Neurodegeneration.

Oxidative stress is a defining and pervasive driver of neurodegenerative 
diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). As a molecular accelerant, reactive oxygen 
species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) compromise mitochondrial 
function, amplify lipid peroxidation, induce protein misfolding, and promote 
chronic neuroinflammation, creating a positive feedback loop of neuronal damage 
and cognitive decline. Despite its centrality in promoting disease progression, 
attempts to neutralize oxidative stress with monotherapeutic antioxidants have 
largely failed owing to the multifactorial redox imbalance affecting each 
patient and their corresponding variation. We are now at the threshold of 
precision redox medicine, driven by advances in syndromic multi-omics 
integration, Artificial Intelligence biomarker identification, and the precision 
of patient-specific therapeutic interventions. This paper will aim to reveal a 
mechanistically deep assessment of oxidative stress and its contribution to 
diseases of neurodegeneration, with an emphasis on oxidatively modified proteins 
(e.g., carbonylated tau, nitrated α-synuclein), lipid peroxidation biomarkers 
(F2-isoprostanes, 4-HNE), and DNA damage (8-OHdG) as significant biomarkers of 
disease progression. We will critically examine the majority of clinical trial 
studies investigating mitochondria-targeted antioxidants (e.g., MitoQ, SS-31), 
Nrf2 activators (e.g., dimethyl fumarate, sulforaphane), and epigenetic 
reprogramming schemes aiming to re-establish antioxidant defenses and repair 
redox damage at the molecular level of biology. Emerging solutions that involve 
nanoparticles (e.g., antioxidant delivery systems) and CRISPR (e.g., correction 
of mutations in SOD1 and GPx1) have the potential to transform therapeutic 
approaches to treatment for these diseases by cutting the time required to 
realize meaningful impacts and meaningful treatment. This paper will argue that 
with the connection between molecular biology and progress in clinical 
hyperbole, dynamic multi-targeted interventions will define the treatment of 
neurodegenerative diseases in the transition from disease amelioration to 
disease modification or perhaps reversal. With these innovations at our 
doorstep, the future offers remarkable possibilities in translating 
network-based biomarker discovery, AI-powered patient stratification, and 
adaptive combination therapies into individualized/long-lasting neuroprotection. 
The question is no longer if we will neutralize oxidative stress; it is how 
likely we will achieve success in the new frontier of neurodegenerative disease 
therapies.

of Warsaw, Chałubińskiego Str. 5, 02-004 Warsaw, Poland.

Glucose is the main source of energy and the source of carbon for the 
biosynthesis of several molecules, such as neurotransmitters, for most mammalian 
cells. Therefore, the transport of glucose into cells is very important. There 
are described three distinct families of glucose transporters: facilitative 
glucose transporters (GLUTs), sodium-dependent glucose cotransporters (SGLTs), 
and a uniporter, the SWEET protein. Impaired function and/or expression of these 
transporters due to, for example, mutations in their genes, may cause severe 
diseases. Associations with the impaired function of glucose transporters have 
been described in the case of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as 
Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, GLUT1-deficiency 
syndrome, stroke, and traumatic brain injury. Changes in the presence of glucose 
transporters may be a cause of NDs, and they may be the effect of NDs. On the 
other hand, in many cases of neurodegenerative diseases, changes in the 
expression of glucose transporters may be a targeted therapy in the treatment of 
patients with these diseases.

Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) are a distinct and dynamic glial 
population that retain proliferative and migratory capacities throughout life. 
While traditionally recognized for differentiating into oligodendrocytes (OLs) 
and generating myelin to support rapid nerve conduction, OPCs are now 
increasingly appreciated for their diverse and non-canonical roles in the 
central nervous system (CNS), including direct interactions with neurons. A 
notable feature of OPCs is their expression of diverse ion channels that 
orchestrate essential cellular functions, including proliferation, migration, 
and differentiation. Given their widespread distribution across the CNS, OPCs 
are increasingly recognized as active contributors to the development and 
progression of various neurological disorders. This review aims to present a 
detailed summary of the physiological and pathological functions of ion channels 
in OPCs, emphasizing their contribution to CNS dysfunction. We further highlight 
recent advances suggesting that ion channels in OPCs may serve as promising 
therapeutic targets across a broad range of disorders, including, but not 
limited to, multiple sclerosis (MS), spinal cord injury, amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis (ALS), psychiatric disorders, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 
neuropathic pain (NP). Finally, we discuss emerging therapeutic strategies 
targeting OPC ion channel function, offering insights into potential future 
directions in the treatment of CNS diseases.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with a multifaceted 
pathogenesis, which remains elusive, seriously affecting the quality of life of 
elderly patients and placing a heavy burden on affected individuals, their 
families, and society. As third-party synapses in brain networks, astrocytes 
play an important role in maintaining the normal function of neural networks, 
which contribute to the abnormal function of networks in AD. In recent years, 
numerous studies have shown that clusterin, a protein expressed by astrocytes, 
can participate in the progression of AD. Clusterin plays a significant role in 
many pathological processes of AD, such as lipid metabolism, AD pathological 
features, the imbalance in neural circuit excitatory inhibition, and 
neuroinflammation. Therefore, delving deeper into the association between 
clusterin and AD will help us to understand the mechanisms of disease better and 
provide a theoretical basis for early diagnosis and the development of treatment 
strategies for AD.

With a rapidly growing incidence and prevalence, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is 
rapidly becoming one of the most disabling, lethal, and expensive diseases of 
the century. To diagnose AD as early as possible, the scientific world struggles 
to find reliable and non-invasive biomarkers that could predict the conversion 
of mild cognitive impairment to AD and delineate the ongoing pathogenic vicious 
pathways to be targeted with therapy. Research supports the use of blood 
biomarkers, such as Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio, phosphorylated tau181, and p-tau217 for 
diagnostic purposes, although the cut-offs are not clearly established and can 
depend on the assays used. For more accurate diagnosis, markers of 
neurodegeneration (neurofilament light) and neuroinflammation (glial fibrillary 
acidic protein) could be introduced in the biomarker panel. The recent approval 
of the Lumipulse G p-tau217/Aβ1-42 plasma ratio by the FDA for the early 
detection of amyloid plaques associated with Alzheimer's disease in adult 
patients, aged 55 years and older, exhibiting signs and symptoms of the disease 
represents a significant advancement in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, 
offering a more accessible and less invasive way to diagnose this devastating 
disease and allow potentially earlier access to treatment options.

Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, ALS, and 
Huntington's pose a growing global challenge due to their complex pathobiology 
and aging demographics. Once considered as cellular debris, small extracellular 
vesicles (sEVs) are now recognized as active mediators of intercellular 
signaling in NDD progression. These nanovesicles (~30-150 nm), capable of 
crossing the blood-brain barrier, carry pathological proteins, RNAs, and lipids, 
facilitating the spread of toxic species like Aβ, tau, TDP-43, and α-synuclein. 
sEVs are increasingly recognized as valuable diagnostic tools, outperforming 
traditional CSF biomarkers in early detection and disease monitoring. On the 
therapeutic front, engineered sEVs offer a promising platform for CNS-targeted 
delivery of siRNAs, CRISPR tools, and neuroprotective agents, demonstrating 
efficacy in preclinical models. However, translational hurdles persist, 
including standardization, scalability, and regulatory alignment. Promising 
solutions are emerging, such as CRISPR-based barcoding, which enables 
high-resolution tracking of vesicle biodistribution; AI-guided analytics to 
enhance quality control; and coordinated regulatory efforts by the FDA, EMA, and 
ISEV aimed at unifying identity and purity criteria under forthcoming Minimal 
Information for Studies of Extracellular Vesicles (MISEV) guidelines. This 
review critically examines the mechanistic roles, diagnostic potential, and 
therapeutic applications of sEVs in NDDs, and outlines key strategies for 
clinical translation.

Cognitive function is critical for overall health, with vitamin D's impact under 
extensive investigation. This review explores the association between vitamin D 
and cognitive health, its neuroprotective mechanisms, and the therapeutic 
potential of supplementation in cognitive decline. Observational studies link 
low vitamin D levels to increased cognitive deterioration risk, particularly in 
Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, Parkinson's disease, and schizophrenia. 
Clinical trial results on vitamin D supplementation's cognitive benefits are 
inconclusive. Vitamin D's neuroprotective effects are complex, influencing 
cognitive abilities by interacting with neuronal and glial cells, modulating 
immune responses, and regulating key molecular pathways. Challenges remain in 
clinical applications, including determining optimal vitamin D levels, effective 
supplementation forms and doses, and identifying responsive populations. The 
review advocates for robust clinical trials to address these gaps, facilitating 
informed use of vitamin D in cognitive health. Future research should focus on 
the optimal timing, duration, and target groups for supplementation to enhance 
cognitive outcomes and reduce risks.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-β plaques, tau 
hyperphosphorylation, and chronic neuroinflammation. Emerging evidence suggests 
a crucial role of lipid signaling pathways in AD pathogenesis, particularly 
those mediated by autotaxin (ATX) and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). ATX, an 
enzyme responsible for LPA production, has been implicated in neuroinflammatory 
processes, blood-brain barrier dysfunction, and neuronal degeneration. LPA 
signaling, through its interaction with specific G-protein-coupled receptors, 
influences neuroinflammation, synaptic plasticity, and tau pathology, all of 
which contribute to AD progression. This review synthesizes recent findings on 
the ATX/LPA axis in AD, exploring its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic 
target. Understanding the mechanistic links between ATX, LPA, and AD pathology 
may open new avenues for disease-modifying strategies.

TREM2 (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2) is a membrane-bound 
receptor primarily expressed on microglia in the central nervous system (CNS). 
TREM2 plays a crucial role in regulating immune responses, phagocytosis, lipid 
metabolism, and inflammation. Mutations in the TREM2 gene have been linked to 
various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Nasu-Hakola disease 
(NHD). These mutations are suggested to impair microglial activation and reduce 
the ability to clear amyloid aggregates, leading to exacerbated 
neuroinflammatory responses and accelerating disease progression. This review 
provides an overview of TREM2 structure, functions, and known pathogenic 
variants-including Arg47His, Arg62His, His157Tyr, Tyr38Cys, and Thr66Met. 
Furthermore, the molecular and cellular consequences of TREM2 mutations are 
introduced, such as impaired ligand binding, altered protein folding and 
trafficking, enhanced TREM2 shedding, and dysregulated inflammatory signaling. 
We also highlight recent advances in therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating 
TREM2 signaling. These include monoclonal antibodies (e.g., AL002, CGX101), 
small molecule agonists, and gene/cell-based therapies that seek to restore 
microglial homeostasis, enhance phagocytosis, and reduce neuroinflammation. 
While these approaches show promise in in vivo/in vitro studies, their clinical 
translation may be challenged by disease heterogeneity and mutation-specific 
responses. Additionally, determining the appropriate timing and precise dosing 
will be essential.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by cognitive decline, memory loss, and neuronal dysfunction. It is 
driven by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques, Tau protein 
hyperphosphorylation, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. Resveratrol (RSV) 
is a natural polyphenolic compound found in grapes, berries, and red wine that 
has garnered attention for its potential neuroprotective properties in combating 
AD. The neuroprotective effects of RSV are mediated through the activation of 
sirtuins (SIRT1), inhibition of Aβ aggregation, modulation of Tau protein 
phosphorylation, and the attenuation of oxidative stress and inflammatory 
responses. RSV also enhances mitochondrial function and promotes autophagy, 
which are important processes for maintaining neuronal health. Preclinical 
studies have demonstrated its efficacy in reducing Aβ burden, improving 
cognitive performance, and mitigating synaptic damage; however, challenges such 
as poor bioavailability, rapid metabolism, and limited blood-brain barrier 
penetration restrict its clinical applicability. Recent technological advances 
and selected modifications are being explored to overcome these limitations and 
enhance its therapeutic efficacy. This review summarizes the multifaceted 
neuroprotective mechanisms of RSV, the synergistic potential of natural 
compounds in enhancing neuroprotection, and the advancements in formulation 
strategies aimed at mitigating AD pathology. Leveraging the therapeutic 
potential of natural compounds represents a compelling paradigm shift for AD 
management, paving the way for future clinical applications.

Background: The Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay 
(MIND) was a 3-year, multicenter, randomized controlled trial to test the 
effects of the MIND diet on cognitive decline in 604 individuals at risk for 
Alzheimer's dementia. Here, we describe the genotyping, imputation, and quality 
control (QC) procedures for the genetic data of trial participants. Methods: DNA 
was extracted from either whole blood or serum, and genotyping was performed 
using the Infinium Global Diversity Array. Established sample and SNP QC 
procedures were applied to the genotyping data, followed by imputation using the 
1000 Genomes Phase 3 v5 reference panel. Results: Significant study-site, 
specimen type, and batch effects were observed. A total of 494 individuals of 
inferred European ancestry and 58 individuals of inferred African ancestry were 
included in the final imputed dataset. Evaluation of the imputed APOE genotype 
against gold-standard sequencing data showed high concordance (98.2%). We 
replicated several known genetic associations identified from previous 
genome-wide association studies, including SNPs previously linked to adiponectin 
(rs16861209, p = 1.5 × 10-5), alpha-linolenic acid (rs174547, p = 1.3 × 10-7), 
and alpha-tocopherol (rs964184, p = 0.003). Conclusions: This dataset represents 
the first genetic resource derived from a dietary intervention trial focused on 
cognitive outcomes. It enables investigation of genetic contributions to 
variability in cognitive response to the MIND diet and supports integrative 
analyses with other omics data types to elucidate the biological mechanisms 
underlying cognitive decline. These efforts may ultimately inform precision 
nutrition strategies to promote cognitive health.

Background/Objectives: Neurodegenerative proteinopathies, such as Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), are 
increasingly prevalent worldwide mainly due to population aging. These 
conditions are marked by complex etiologies, overlapping pathologies, and 
progressive clinical decline, with significant consequences for patients, 
caregivers, and healthcare systems. This review aims to synthesize evidence on 
the healthcare complexities of major neurodegenerative proteinopathies to 
highlight current knowledge gaps, and to inform future care models, policies, 
and research directions. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive literature search 
in PubMed/MEDLINE using combinations of MeSH terms and keywords related to 
neurodegenerative diseases, proteinopathies, diagnosis, sex, management, 
treatment, caregiver burden, and healthcare delivery. Studies were included if 
they addressed the clinical, pathophysiological, economic, or care-related 
complexities of aging-related neurodegenerative proteinopathies. Results: Key 
themes identified include the following: (1) multifactorial and unclear 
etiologies with frequent co-pathologies; (2) long prodromal phases with emerging 
biomarkers; (3) lack of effective disease-modifying therapies; (4) progressive 
nature requiring ongoing and individualized care; (5) high caregiver burden; (6) 
escalating healthcare and societal costs; and (7) the critical role of 
multidisciplinary and multi-domain care models involving specialists, primary 
care, and allied health professionals. Conclusions: The complexity and cost of 
neurodegenerative proteinopathies highlight the urgent need for 
prevention-focused strategies, innovative care models, early interventions, and 
integrated policies that support patients and caregivers. Prevention through the 
early identification of risk factors and prodromal signs is critical. Investing 
in research to develop effective disease-modifying therapies and improve early 
detection will be essential to reducing the long-term burden of these disorders.

Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), present 
significant diagnostic challenges due to overlapping symptoms and the invasive, 
time-consuming, and costly nature of current diagnostic methods. While AD 
remains the only neurodegenerative disorder for which biomarkers in 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), such as amyloid beta peptide (Aβ), are available for 
clinical diagnosis, similar tools are lacking for other neurodegenerative 
conditions. This diagnostic gap hinders timely and accurate differential 
diagnoses, limiting patient access to appropriate clinical trials and 
therapeutic interventions. In this study, we developed a compartmentalized 
microfluidic platform to facilitate differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative 
diseases by providing an initial screening tool to guide patients toward 
targeted clinical pathways. Using CSF samples from AD patients with confirmed 
diagnoses, we showed a proof of concept to distinguish between non 
neurodegenerative (NN) and Alzheimer's samples. Human glutamatergic neurons 
derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were exposed to synthetic Aβ 
oligomers (AβO) and patient CSF to assess their effects on neuronal network 
activity. Neuronal responses were recorded via microelectrode array (MEA) before 
and after treatments, with tetrodotoxin (TTX) serving as a control for 
validating modulation of the neuronal network. Our findings demonstrated that 
key electrophysiological metrics extracted from MEA recordings can tend to 
differentiate AD from non-neurodegenerative CSF samples. This standardized 
platform not only provides a robust approach for AD biomarker validation but 
also offers a foundation for broader differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative 
diseases. By enabling more accurate patient stratification, this tool could have 
the potential to direct patients toward appropriate clinical trials, enabling 
the diagnosis of a broader range of neurodegenerative diseases. This approach 
has the potential to expand the patient population included in research and 
accelerate the development of new therapeutic strategies.

The β-amyloid (Aβ) deposits in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are primarily composed 
of Aβ42-derived fibrils, and Aβ42 fibrils exhibit polymorphism with diverse 
molecular structures. While small-molecule-based targeting strategies have 
achieved phased progress in AD diagnosis and treatment, the distribution and 
quantity of binding sites on Aβ42 fibrils, as well as the dynamic interaction 
mechanisms between these sites and different tracers, remain unclear. 
Additionally, the binding efficacy of small molecules to Aβ42 fibrils with 
distinct structures and their conformational dependence have not yet been 
elucidated. In this study, five novel ligands were selected as tracers to 
investigate their interactions with four representative Aβ42 fibril 
conformations. The results demonstrated significant differences in the 
capacities of these molecules to bind Aβ fibrils with varying conformations, 
revealing a pronounced conformation-dependent relationship. Notably, small 
molecule 1 (SM1) and SM3 exhibited robust binding affinities across all four Aβ 
fibril conformations, highlighting their potential as tracers. Furthermore, the 
binding sites of the υ-type (8EZE) Aβ fibril accommodating small molecules were 
first identified, and U-type (2BEG), S-type (2NAO), and LS-type (5OQV) Aβ 
fibrils were found to align with the ones reported previously for other ligands. 
Notably, strongly bound molecules induce structural deformation of the fibril. 
These findings provide critical insights for the rational design and 
modification of existing Aβ42 fibril-targeting ligands, facilitating the 
development of tracers with enhanced specificity and selectivity.

Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) regulate cellular signaling 
pathways, but also cause oxidative stress when de-regulated during aging and 
pathological conditions such as neurodegenerative diseases. The dynamic 
redistribution of proteins between cellular compartments is a common mechanism 
to control their stability and biological activities. By targeting the BirA∗ 
biotin ligase to the outer mitochondrial membrane in HEK293 cells, we identified 
proteins whose labeling increased or decreased in response to treatment with 
menadione, consistent with a dynamic change in their mitochondrial localization 
in response to increased mtROS production. These proteins represent potential 
candidates for future studies of mitochondrial oxidative stress signaling. A 
subset of glycolytic enzymes was found in this screen and confirmed, by 
mitochondrial fractionation and imaging, to increase localization to 
mitochondria in response to menadione, despite no change in their overall 
abundance. Submitochondrial fractionation studies are consistent with import of 
a pool of these enzymes to the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Localization 
of glycolytic enzymes to mitochondria was also increased in cells grown under 
hypoxia or that express a mitochondria-targeted d-amino-acid oxidase (conditions 
that induce increased mtROS production), and inhibited basally under normal 
growth conditions by the mitochondrial antioxidant MnTBAP. Finally, primary 
Alzheimer's disease fibroblasts also had glycolytic enzymes associated with 
mitochondria that was reduced by antioxidants, consistent with increased mtROS 
altering their relative distribution between the cytoplasm and mitochondria. We 
speculate that the increased mitochondrial localization of glycolytic enzymes is 
an adaptive response to mtROS that alters glucose flux toward the antioxidant 
pentose phosphate pathway, creates distinct regulatory pools of mitochondrial 
metabolites or new metabolic circuits, and/or provides cytoprotection or other 
adaptive responses via moonlighting functions unrelated to their enzymatic 
activity.

Mounting evidence implicates brain lymphatic drainage in the pathogenesis of 
Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Several recent basic and clinical 
science discoveries have suggested the impact of lymphatic therapy to stimulate 
lymph flow in the head and neck including improvement in cognition. Manual 
lymphatic drainage has potential as a simple inexpensive way to promote brain 
lymph drainage and is worthy of a well-designed clinical trial to evaluate its 
potential as a primary or adjunctive treatment of Alzheimer's disease at this 
time.

Addressing Digital Disparities in Alzheimer Disease by Improving Access to 
Alzheimer Resources for Spanish-Speaking Latino or Latina Individuals in Los 
Angeles County: Mixed Methods Study.

States.

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted traditional health care delivery 
models, exacerbating disparities between those with and without ready access to 
digital technology. This digital divide poses a structural barrier to accessing 
equitable healthy aging resources and dementia care. Latino and Hispanic 
individuals, who constitute nearly half of Los Angeles County's population and 
face a projected tripling of Alzheimer disease and related dementia (ADRD) 
prevalence by 2040, are particularly impacted.
OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to examine the barriers and facilitators affecting 
access to digital health education and resources for Alzheimer disease (AD) 
prevention and care management during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study focuses 
on the digital barriers possibly hindering Spanish-speaking Latino and Hispanic 
individuals in Los Angeles County from using online services offering critical 
AD prevention and care resources amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: We developed a conceptual model based on users' digital access or web 
literacy and language as barriers and facilitators impacting access to digital 
AD prevention and care resources. Between January 2022 and February 2022, we 
identified 15 websites of local organizations providing digital AD prevention 
services and resources in Los Angeles County during the pandemic. We applied our 
digital divide model to qualitatively evaluate the 15 websites. A post hoc 
analysis was conducted to reevaluate the 15 websites in 2025, and interrater 
reliability was evaluated using a Cohen κ analysis.
RESULTS: Out of the 15 websites, 5 featured web navigation accessibility tools 
(4/15 in 2025), 4 provided content available in Spanish (6/15 in 2025), and 2 
included resources for family dialogue about AD care and management (3/15 in 
2025). One website showed cultural and linguistic responsiveness in its content 
(2/15 in 2025). Cohen κ analysis revealed substantial agreement for digital 
acceptability factors including Spanish language (κ=0.71), resources available 
in Spanish (κ=0.71), and family dialogue resources (κ=0.74). Agreement for web 
accessibility tools was moderate at (κ=0.53). We uncovered other unforeseen 
structural barriers to digital access, including email subscription 
requirements, English language-centered online forms, and the limited 
availability of Spanish-speaking staff.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights structural barriers hindering access to 
digital AD prevention and care resources tailored to the needs and values of 
Latino and Hispanic communities living in Los Angeles County. The findings 
emphasize the need to bridge the digital gap by incorporating user-friendly 
features and culturally and linguistically responsive elements in website design 
and implementation. This approach will move our field toward equitable access to 
digital ADRD prevention and care resources by mitigating structural barriers 
that sustain ADRD disparities in Latino and Hispanic communities.

BACKGROUND: Computerized cognitive training conducted in a home setting has 
shown beneficial effects on cognitive functions in people with mild cognitive 
impairment. Similar effects in people suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
have not yet been found. We aimed to examine the effect of a six-month 
tablet-based multimodal training in community-dwelling people with mild to 
moderate AD on cognitive functions and on the volume of (sub)cortical 
structures.
METHODS: Within a randomized controlled trial, a six-month (un)supervised 
tablet-based multimodal training including cognitive and physical exercises in 
people with mild to moderate AD (n = 11) was compared to a control group 
(n = 11) that received cognitive paper-and-pencil exercises for voluntary, 
unsupervised training. Participants in the intervention group were visited by 
professional trainers on a weekly basis for joint, supervised training sessions 
and were encouraged to train alone or with a caregiver as often as possible. 
Neuropsychological examination included assessments of global cognitive 
functions, memory, attention, executive functions, and verbal fluency. 
Freesurfer analyses of T1-weighted scans from structural magnetic resonance 
imaging were used to assess volumes of specific (sub)cortical areas (e.g., 
hippocampal volume).
RESULTS: Over six months, the intervention group showed a stable global 
cognitive function score (Mini Mental Status Examination), whereas the control 
group showed a cognitive decline (ANCOVA-interaction: F1, 14 = 5.083, p = .041; 
controlled for disease duration and education). No other selective cognitive 
domain showed a significant time-by-group difference. No difference in cerebral 
volumes were detected.
CONCLUSION: The tablet-based multimodal training with cognitive and physical 
activation has positive effects on global cognitive functions of people with 
mild to moderate AD over a six-month training period, but lacks measurable 
transferability to other cognitive domains such as memory, attention or 
executive functions or brain structure. Further research on such interventions 
using high-quality longitudinal designs is recommended.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the utmost age-linked neuro-degenerative conditions, 
marked via gradual deterioration of cognitive abilities and continues to be a 
significant worldwide health issue. Etiology of AD is linked to neurobehavioral 
variations, deposition of Aβ, p-Tau, activations of glycogen synthase kinase-3 
(GSK-3β), and fluctuations in cyclic nucleotides including cAMP & cGMP. As per 
evidence, PDE-5 inhibitors are able to boost cAMP & cGMP levels and other 
etiological hallmarks, which could be a novel AD cure. The main objective of 
present study was to examine therapeutic potential of Avanafil in a rat model of 
AD induced by administering 60 mg/kg of D-galactose (D-galac) and 10 mg/kg of 
Aluminium chloride (AlCl3) for a period of 42 days. Following this, 28 days of 
therapy with two different doses of Avanafil (3 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg) was given. 
Towards end of treatment, locomotor activity & Morris water maze were performed. 
Rats were then euthanized and hippocampus was isolated for biochemical 
parameters & histological investigation. Results revealed that both 
neurobehavioral parameters exhibits significant difference in treatment group as 
compared to toxic group. Alterations in level of AchE, Aβ (1-42), GSK-3β, p-Tau, 
tumor necrosis factor- alpha (TNF-α), IL-1β, & IL-6, cAMP, cGMP & BDNF, and 
oxidative stress were significantly reversed towards normal level in the 
treatment group when compared to toxic rats. Histopathological changes by H&E 
staining showed significant difference in treatment vs. toxic rats. The current 
investigation suggested that Avanafil improves memory by improving cAMP and cGMP 
pathways, implying that it may have therapeutic prospective in cognitive 
deficiencies linked with Alzheimer's disease.

INTRODUCTION: The causal association between pulmonary function and Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate whether low 
pulmonary function has a causal relationship with the risk of AD.
METHODS: We conducted prospective cohort and two-sample Mendelian randomization 
(MR) studies. In the cohort study, 333,816 UK Biobank participants were eligible 
for analysis. Forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1), forced vital 
capacity (FVC), FEV1/FVC ratio, percentage of predicted normal value of FEV1 
(FEV1% pred), and peak expiratory flow (PEF) were measured at baseline. 
Longitudinal associations were investigated using cox-proportional hazard 
models. We conducted univariate and multivariable MR analyses on genome-wide 
association study (GWAS) data from 421,986 Europeans for FEV1, FVC, and PEF. 
Inverse-variance weighting was employed as the primary MR analysis approach.
RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 12.8 years (10.3-15.0 years), 2275 incident 
cases of AD were identified in the cohort study. Compared to the highest 
quartile, the lowest quartile for pulmonary function exhibited a higher risk of 
incident AD, and hazard ratios (95% CI) were as follows after adjustment for 
risk factors: 1.81 (1.32-2.48; FEV1), 1.97 (1.44-2.69; FVC), and 1.86 
(1.39-2.47; PEF). In the MR study, genetically determined high FEV1 was 
associated with a decreased risk of AD (odds ratio: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.53-0.88). 
The results remained robust after sensitivity and multivariable MR analyses.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest the potential causal association between high 
FEV1 and decreased risk of AD.

Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's 
disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) 
are characterized by progressive neuronal loss and chronic neuroinflammation. 
Increasing evidence highlights the interleukin-12 (IL-12) cytokine 
family-including IL-12, IL-23, IL-27, and IL-35-as central regulators of immune 
responses in the central nervous system (CNS). IL-12 and IL-23 predominantly 
promote pro-inflammatory pathways by driving Th1/Th17 activity, microglial 
activation, and neurotoxicity, whereas IL-27 and IL-35 exert anti-inflammatory 
and neuroprotective effects through IL-10 induction and expansion of regulatory 
immune subsets. This review synthesizes disease-specific expression patterns and 
experimental findings, underscoring the dual pathogenic and protective roles of 
these cytokines. Therapeutic strategies targeting IL-12 family signaling have 
shown promise in preclinical and clinical contexts. In AD, blockade of 
IL-12/IL-23 reduced amyloid burden and improved cognition, while agents such as 
tadalafil and bergapten enhanced IL-27-mediated neuroprotection via PI3K/Akt, 
Wnt/β-catenin, and cGMP/PKG pathways. In MS, approaches including p40 blockade 
(ustekinumab, ABT-874), interferon-β therapy, hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation, and B-cell depletion (ocrelizumab) variably suppressed 
IL-12/IL-23 and augmented IL-27/IL-35, influencing relapse rates and 
progression. Natural compounds such as curcumin, berberine, and vitamin D 
further highlight metabolic and dietary opportunities for cytokine modulation. 
In PD, combinatorial regimens combining herbal formulations with 
anti-inflammatory agents dampened IL-12-driven macrophage activation and 
supported dopaminergic neuron survival. Taken together, IL-12 family cytokines 
emerge as both biomarkers and therapeutic targets in NDs. However, 
context-dependent activity, blood-brain barrier constraints, and incomplete 
understanding-particularly of IL-35-pose translational challenges warranting 
further investigation.

Sleep questionnaires may help understand sleep habits and screen for sleep 
disorders. However, they can fail in diagnosing obstructive sleep apnea or 
identifying the chronotype and the total sleep time of patients admitted to a 
specialized memory clinic. Lam et al. showed the high prevalence of sleep 
disturbances in patients with cognitive impairment. They also highlighted the 
importance of combining subjective questionnaires with objective tests to 
identify sleep problems associated with poor cognitive performance, particularly 
in women. Consequently, recognizing sleep problems can help clinicians set 
personalized treatment strategies for improving sleep and preventing or slowing 
cognitive impairment.

BackgroundThe cerebellum plays a crucial role in cognitive processing, making it 
a potential target for therapeutic intervention in Alzheimer's disease 
(AD).ObjectiveThis study aimed to investigate the effect of cerebellar 
intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) in patients with AD.MethodsWe 
conducted a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled clinical trial in which 
patients were randomly allocated to receive either active-iTBS or sham-iTBS. The 
primary outcome was the change in Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes 
(CDR-SB) scores from baseline to week 4. Secondary outcomes included evaluations 
of neurophysiological measures, brain network functions, and glymphatic 
clearance.ResultsFrom April 20 to June 25, 2024, 20 patients were analyzed. 
Compared with sham-iTBS, active-iTBS significantly improved cognition at week 4, 
indicated by reduced CDR-SB scores (mean changes: -0.60 versus 0.15; adjusted β: 
0.73; 95% CI, 0.17-1.26). In the active-iTBS group compared with the sham-iTBS 
group, the power spectral density in electroencephalogram revealed global 
decreased in theta power (adjusted β, -0.014; 95% CI, -0.024-0.003) and 
increased beta power (adjusted β, 0.002; 95%CI, 0.000-0.005), the functional 
magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated enhanced the gradient values of default 
mode network activity along the principal gradient, and the structural magnetic 
resonance imaging indicated an improvement in glymphatic clearance (adjusted β, 
0.097, 95% CI, 0.0381-0.1603).ConclusionsA four-week course of iTBS improved 
cognitive function in patients with AD, possibly via promoting the Beta 
frequency band power, enhancing brain network functionality, and facilitating 
glymphatic clearance.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov (NCT06379100, April

Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, represents a 
significant global health challenge with profound implications for patients and 
their families. Despite decades of intensive research efforts, no curative 
treatment for AD currently exists. In recent years, surgical interventions have 
emerged as a promising therapeutic avenue, offering potential for disease 
modification and symptom management. This comprehensive review critically 
evaluates the evolving landscape of surgical approaches in AD treatment, 
encompassing deep brain stimulation, focused ultrasound, gene therapy delivery 
systems, neural grafting techniques, and lymphatic-venous anastomosis. We 
systematically analyze the neurobiological mechanisms, clinical efficacy, safety 
profiles, and technical challenges associated with these interventions. Drawing 
upon an extensive review of 112 recent studies, this article provides a rigorous 
assessment of the current state of surgical therapies for AD, while identifying 
key knowledge gaps and future research directions that could advance the field 
toward more effective therapeutic strategies.

(1) Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is a neurotrophin with 
anti-inflammatory properties. Neuroinflammation and stress activate peripheral 
immune mechanisms, which may contribute to the development of depression and 
anxiety in sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD). This study aims to evaluate 
whether intracerebroventricular (ICV) premedication with IGF-1 in a rat model of 
streptozotocin (STZ)-induced neuroinflammation can prevent the emergence of 
anhedonia and anxiety-like behavior by impacting the peripheral inflammatory 
responses. (2) Male Wistar rats were subjected to double ICVSTZ (total dose: 3 
mg/kg) and ICVIGF-1 injections (total dose: 2 µg). We analyzed the level of 
anhedonia (sucrose preference), anxiety (elevated plus maze), peripheral 
inflammation (hematological and cytometric measurement of leukocyte populations, 
interleukin (IL)-6), and corticosterone concentration at 7 (very early stage, 
VES), 45 (early stage, ES), and 90 days after STZ injections (late stage, LS). 
(3) We found that ICVIGF-1 administration reduces behavioral symptoms: anhedonia 
(ES and LS) and anxiety (VES, ES), and peripheral inflammation: number of 
leukocytes, lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, monocytes, granulocytes, IL-6, and 
corticosterone concentration (LS) in the rat model of sAD. (4) The obtained 
results demonstrate beneficial effects of central IGF-1 administration on 
neuropsychiatric symptoms and peripheral immune system activation during disease 
progression in the rat model of sAD.

Neuroinflammation is a key feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and stem cell 
therapies have emerged as promising candidates due to their immunomodulatory 
properties. Neuro-Cells (NC), a combination of unmodified mesenchymal stem cells 
(MSCs) and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), have demonstrated therapeutic 
potential in models of central nervous system (CNS) injury and 
neurodegeneration. Here, we studied the effects of NC in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice, an 
AD mouse model. Twelve-month-old APPswe/PS1dE9 mice or their wild-type 
littermates were injected with NC or vehicle into the cisterna magna. Five to 
six weeks post-injection, cognitive, locomotor, and emotional behaviors were 
assessed. The brain was stained for amyloid plaque density using Congo red, and 
for astrogliosis using DAPI and GFAP staining. Gene expression of immune 
activation markers (Il-1β, Il-6, Cd45, Tnf) and plasticity markers (Tubβ3, 
Bace1, Trem2, Stat3) was examined in the prefrontal cortex. IL-6 secretion was 
measured in cultured human monocytes following endotoxin challenge and NC 
treatment. Untreated APPswe/PS1dE9 mice displayed impaired learning in the 
conditioned taste aversion test, reduced object exploration, and anxiety-like 
behavior, which were improved in the NC-treated mutants. NC treatment normalized 
the expression of several immune and plasticity markers and reduced the density 
of GFAP-positive cells in the hippocampus and thalamus. NC treatment decreased 
amyloid plaque density in the hippocampus and thalamus, targeting plaques of 
<100 μm2. Additionally, NC treatment suppressed IL-6 secretion by human 
monocytes. Thus, NC treatment alleviated behavioral deficits and reduced amyloid 
plaque formation in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice, likely via anti-inflammatory mechanisms. 
The reduction in IL-6 production in human monocytes further supports the 
potential of NC therapy for the treatment of AD.

Nonischemic cardiomyopathies (NICMs), encompassing hypertrophic (HCM), dilated 
(DCM), restrictive, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy/dysplasia, 
and nondilated left ventricular cardiomyopathies, contribute significantly to 
cardiovascular morbidity, representing nearly 50% of cardiac transplants. 
Despite improved genetic and imaging techniques, underdiagnosis persists, 
particularly for HCM. Mendelian randomization (MR) studies provide a powerful 
method to identify causal risk factors, overcoming limitations of observational 
studies and randomized controlled trials. This manuscript reviews MR studies to 
identify causal factors for NICM, including endocrine, neurological, 
psychological, musculoskeletal, and microbial influences, and evaluates their 
implications for diagnostics and therapeutics. We reviewed MR studies using 
genetic variants as instrumental variables to establish causality. Studies 
employed one-sample and 2-sample MR, univariable and multivariable analyses, and 
large-scale genome-wide association study data. Causal relationships between 
exposures (eg, thyroid dysfunction, type-1 diabetes, iron overload, gut 
microbiome) and NICM subtypes were assessed, focusing on mediators such as 
inflammatory biomarkers. MR studies confirmed causal links between NICM and 
autoimmune endocrinopathies (eg, Hashimoto's thyroiditis and type-1 diabetes), 
iron overload, obesity, smoking, stress/irritability, and gut microbial taxa. 
Inflammatory biomarkers, such as monokine induced by interferon-gamma, mediated 
endocrine pathways. Alzheimer's disease showed a protective effect, while bone 
mineral density and homocysteine lacked causality. Genetic loci (eg, SVIL and 
RBM20) were implicated in HCM and DCM. Population stratification biased results, 
limiting generalizability. MR studies reveal diverse NICM causal factors, 
supporting precision medicine via enhanced screening and therapies targeting 
inflammatory mediators and microbial influences. Future research should improve 
population diversity, validate causal pathways, and explore the 
cardiac-gut-microbiome axis.

INTRODUCTION: In clinically and racially diverse training and test sets, we 
evaluated and validated Alzheimer's disease (AD) plasma biomarkers: 
phosphorylated tau-217 (p-tau217), amyloid beta 1-42/1-40 (Aβ42/Aβ40), and 
p-tau217/Aβ42.
METHODS: Inclusion criteria were available plasma, race (people who 
self-identified as Black/African American [pBlack] or White [pWhite]), cognitive 
status (normal, mild cognitive impairment [MCI], dementia), and 18F-florbetaben 
or 18F-florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET) data. In the training set 
(n = 289; 28% pBlack), we used receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis 
to calculate two cut points (0.95 sensitivity and specificity) to detect amyloid 
PET positivity. Cut points were validated in an independent test set (n = 846; 
12% pBlack).
RESULTS: In the test set, plasma p-tau217/Aβ42 had the highest accuracy (pBlack: 
0.88, pWhite: 0.91) and lowest proportion of intermediate classifications 
(≤0.16), with no classification difference by race (odds ratio [OR] = 1.45, 95% 
confidence interval [CI] = 0.66-2.95, p = 0.33). False negatives were more 
likely to be cognitively normal (vs mild cognitive impairment [MCI]; OR = 7.79, 
95% CI = 2.33-40.81, p = 5.1e-05) than correct classifications.
DISCUSSION: Plasma p-tau217/Aβ42 had high accuracy to detect AD, with comparable 
performance across race.
HIGHLIGHTS: We tested plasma phosphorylated tau-217 (p-tau217)/amyloid beta 
(Aβ)42, p-tau217, and Aβ42/Aβ40 in diverse training and test sets. In models, 
race × amyloid PET interactions were not significant. Plasma p-tau217/Aβ42 had 
the highest accuracy in people who self-identified as Black/African American 
(pBlack; 0.88) and people who self-identified as White (pWhite; 0.91). Plasma 
p-tau217/Aβ42 had the lowest proportion of intermediate cases 
(range = 0.09-0.16). False negatives were more likely to have normal cognition, 
female sex, and high body mass index.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: Growing evidence indicates that subjective cognitive decline 
(SCD), characterized by self-reported cognitive deterioration without measurable 
cognitive impairment, may be an early indicator of Alzheimer's Disease. This 
study investigated the association between baseline sleep disturbance and a 
10-year trajectory of global cognitive performance in adults with SCD and 
examined if this association was moderated by age (50-64 years and ≥65 years) 
and sleep treatment.
METHODS: Using six waves (2010-2020) of the Health and Retirement Study, we 
included individuals aged ≥50 years who reported SCD but had no objective 
cognitive impairment at baseline (2010) and had final wave of cognitive data 
(n=1,372). Latent growth curve modeling was employed to examine the associations 
between self-reported sleep disturbance and cognitive trajectories from 2010 to 
2020, controlling for sociodemographic and health-related factors.
RESULTS: In the full sample, baseline sleep disturbance was not significantly 
associated with cognitive change. However, a significant interaction between 
sleep disturbance and age group was found (β=-0.04, 95% CI [-0.08, -0.003]). 
Stratified analyses showed that poorer sleep was associated with faster 
cognitive decline in those aged ≥65 years (β=-0.04, 95% CI [-0.07, -0.005]; 
n=558), and receiving sleep treatment was associated with a reduced impact of 
sleep disturbance on cognitive decline (β=0.31, 95% CI [0.02, 0.60]). These 
associations were not significant in those aged 50-64 years (n=814).
CONCLUSIONS: Sleep disturbance was an independent risk factor of future 
cognitive decline in older adults ≥65 years with SCD. Sleep treatment may 
mitigate this decline, offering a potential intervention strategy.

INTRODUCTION: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are prevalent in dementia, but 
most studies focus on Western populations. This study examines the association 
between NPS and neurodegeneration-related plasma biomarkers in older adults with 
and without dementia in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
METHODS: Eighty-five individuals (≥65 years) underwent dementia adjudication 
using the Community Screening Instrument for Dementia (CSID) and Alzheimer's 
Questionnaire (AQ). Plasma biomarkers (amyloid β [Aβ] 42/40, 
phosphorylated-tau181 [p-tau181], neurofilament light [NfL], glial fibrillary 
acidic protein (GFAP), interleukin-1β [IL-1β], tumor necrosis factor-α [TNF-α]) 
were measured. NPS were assessed using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), 
Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI) 
(for dementia cases). Logistic regressions examined associations between NPS and 
biomarkers, adjusting for age, sex, and education.
RESULTS: NPS were common in dementia cases, with irritability (57.8%) and 
depression (90.7%) most frequent. GFAP was linked to irritability (odds ratio 
[OR] = 3.34, p = 0.01), and NfL and GFAP were associated with depressive 
symptoms (OR = 0.76, p = 0.04; OR = 1.98, p = 0.02, respectively).
DISCUSSION: These findings highlight the burden of NPS in the DRC and suggest 
biomarker-driven mechanisms, emphasizing the need for further research in 
diverse populations.
HIGHLIGHTS: Identifies neuropsychiatric symptoms as early indicators of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. Examines associations between depression 
and AD biomarkers in preclinical and prodromal stages. Highlights the role of 
amyloid and tau pathology in depression-related cognitive decline. Discusses 
implications for early intervention and personalized treatment strategies.

The amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration (ATN) biomarker framework has greatly 
progressed the diagnosis and staging of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, 
recent research highlights neuroinflammation as an equally critical factor in AD 
pathology across humans, rodents, and non-human primates (NHPs). This review 
evaluates the combined use of ATN and neuroinflammatory biomarkers-such as glial 
fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (astrocytic marker) and triggering receptor 
expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2)/ ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 
(IBA-1) (microglial markers)-in elucidating AD mechanisms, promoting early 
diagnosis, and shaping therapeutic strategies. It also summarizes the key 
features and translational potential of NHP models that closely mimic human AD 
pathology, highlighting the promising prospects of integrating these models with 
the ATN(X) biomarker system. These insights strengthen the link between 
biomarkers, NHP research, and clinical practice, opening new avenues for the 
early detection and treatment strategies of AD. HIGHLIGHTS: Neuroinflammation 
biomarkers, including glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), triggering 
receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2)/sTREM2, and YKL-40, show strong 
clinical potential in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Incorporating neuroinflammation 
biomarkers into the ATN(X) framework may enhance diagnostic precision. Advanced 
non-human primate (NHP) models closely replicate human brain pathology, 
addressing key limitations of mouse models. Measuring ATN(X) biomarkers in NHPs 
may improve clinical translation and support early diagnosis of AD. Optimizing 
NHP models-including ApoE4 status, injection protocols, and gene-editing 
approaches-is crucial for reproducibility and efficiency.

[18F]PI-2620 is a second generation tracer that has shown high binding affinity 
for tau aggregation in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, [18F]PI-2620 signal in 
a large sample spanning the healthy aging and AD clinical spectrum as well as 
the stability of signal across different acquisition time windows has not yet 
been examined. Here, amyloid negative (Aβ-) cognitively unimpaired (CU; n = 49), 
amyloid positive (Aβ+) CU (n = 37), CU individuals with unknown amyloid status 
(n = 5), mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n = 14), dementia due to AD (n = 19), 
and non-AD neurodegenerative disorder (n = 54) participants were scanned with 
[18F]PI-2620 using a 45-75 min and/or 60-90 min acquisition time window. The 
impact of acquisition time on standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) magnitude 
was first quantified with linear mixed models, and in participants and regions 
with high [18F]PI-2620 signal, SUVRs increased linearly up to 0.04 SUVR with 
each additional 5 min past injection time. We then accounted for differences in 
acquisition time using a voxel-wise correction approach and showed high 
correlations (allr's ≥ 0.986) between SUVRs calculated from 45-75 min data and 
SUVRs from 60-90 min data that were interpolated to the 45-75 min scale in 15 
participants who were scanned across both time windows. Using real and 
interpolated 45-75 min data, we next examined [18F]PI-2620 signal in Braak 
regions of interest and an off-target binding region (putamen) in Aβ- and Aβ+ 
CU, Aβ+ MCI, and Aβ+ AD dementia (n = 115) and showed that SUVRs in all Braak 
regions increased with greater disease severity. Within CU, higher Braak I SUVR 
was significantly associated with greater CSF pTau-181 (n = 35), and higher 
SUVRs were significantly associated with worse memory and language (n = 57). 
Thus, voxel-wise acquisition time corrections can be applied to combine 
[18F]PI-2620 datasets collected at different post-injection times, and once 
acquisition time is accounted for, [18F]PI-2620 signal shows the expected 
increases across the AD spectrum and can be used for detection of early tau 
elevations.

Longitudinal assessment of brain atrophy, particularly in the hippocampus, is a 
well-studied biomarker for neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). Estimating brain progression patterns can be applied to 
understanding the therapeutic effects of amyloid-clearing drugs in research and 
detecting the earliest sign of accelerated atrophy in clinical settings. 
However, most state-of-the-art measurements calculate changes directly by 
segmentation and/or deformable registration of MRI images, and may misreport 
head motion or MRI artifacts as neurodegeneration, impacting their accuracy. In 
our previous study, we developed a deep learning method DeepAtrophy that uses a 
convolutional neural network to quantify differences between longitudinal MRI 
scan pairs that are associated with time. DeepAtrophy has high accuracy in 
inferring temporal information from longitudinal MRI scans, such as temporal 
order or relative interscan interval. DeepAtrophy also provides an overall 
atrophy score that was shown to perform well as a potential biomarker of disease 
progression and treatment efficacy. However, DeepAtrophy is not interpretable, 
and it is unclear what changes in the MRI contribute to progression 
measurements. In this paper, we propose Regional Deep Atrophy (RDA), which 
combines the temporal inference approach from DeepAtrophy with a deformable 
registration neural network and attention mechanism that highlights regions in 
the MRI image where longitudinal changes are contributing to temporal inference. 
RDA has similar prediction accuracy as DeepAtrophy, but its additional 
interpretability makes it more acceptable for use in clinical settings, and may 
lead to more sensitive biomarkers for disease monitoring and progression 
understanding in preclinical AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), a global health crisis exacerbated by aging 
populations, demands innovative therapeutic strategies. Curcumin, a natural 
compound with anti-aging and anti-inflammatory properties, holds promise for AD 
treatment but is hindered by poor bioavailability. Here, we developed 
curcumin-loaded nanovesicles (NV-CUR) derived from brain-homing B16 melanoma 
cells to overcome these limitations. NV-CUR enhanced the solubility, stability, 
and blood‒brain barrier (BBB) penetration of curcumin, enabling systemic 
delivery in aged 3 × Tg AD mice. Our 3R strategy for removing senescent cells, 
remodeling the neuroinflammatory microenvironment, and repairing neuronal damage 
was comprehensively validated. NV-CUR effectively cleared p16INK4a 
(P16)-positive senescent microglia, suppressed senescence-associated secretory 
phenotypes (SASP), and reduced neuroinflammation (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α). 
Concurrently, NV-CUR diminished amyloid-beta plaques, attenuated Tau 
hyperphosphorylation, and restored hippocampal neuronal integrity. Cognitive 
assessments revealed significant improvements in memory and exploratory 
behavior, whereas biosafety evaluations confirmed that there was no systemic 
toxicity. This study establishes NV-CUR as a mechanistically innovative, 
clinically translatable nanomedicine that aligns with the 3R paradigm, offering 
a multifaceted approach to combat AD pathogenesis.

White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are covert magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
- markers of microvascular dysfunction and are primary vascular contributors to 
dementia, emphasizing its importance in prevention strategies. Here, we 
integrate gene expression and protein levels measured across plasma, 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), brain and multiple other tissues from 
population-based and biobank-scale data to triangulate druggable genes 
influencing WMH-burden and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to map their spatial 
localization specifically in brain-cell types. Lowering the expression levels of 
CALCRL, MAP3K11, PKN2 and EPHB4 shows putative causal associations with reduced 
WMH-burden, and AD risk. These targets of clinically approved drugs, enriched in 
key cell types of the neurovascular unit and exhibiting cell-type specific 
effects in peripheral CD4 + T cell subsets, are implicated in regulating 
neuroimmune interactions and amyloid-β homeostasis. Gene-drug interaction 
analysis identifies higher levels of GLTPD2 modifying the antidepressants 
associated increase in dementia risk contributing to a 73.3% risk reduction 
relative to the use of drugs. Furthermore, pharmagenic pathway studies identify 
the coagulation cascade as a targetable pathway associated with AD risk (HR: 
2.23, 95% CI:1.85-2.69), providing orthogonal support to emerging therapies 
targeting coagulation components in treating neurodegenerative disorders.

Recent advances in gene-editing technologies offer new opportunities for drug 
development to treat unmet medical needs in central nervous system (CNS) 
disorders including neurogenerative diseases of the aging brain. The 
adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a promising and most widely utilized vector for 
gene therapy application including the CNS. AAV is characterized by high 
transduction efficiency in both dividing and non-dividing cells, low 
immunogenicity and toxicity, and exceptional tissue specificity. The development 
of clustered regularly interspaced short-palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-based 
technologies has revolutionized all aspects of modern sciences and created an 
innovative therapeutic toolkit with the potential to address a wide range of 
neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's (PD) diseases. 
However, AAV limitations for delivering CRISPR modalities continue to impede 
viable therapeutic interventions targeting the brain. This review highlights 
challenges and strategies to deliver AAV-CRISPR-based therapeutic cargos for 
gene therapy applications in the CNS, with a particular focus on AD and PD 
preclinical studies.

Individuals with Down syndrome (DS), caused by trisomy of chromosome 21 (chr21, 
T21), are strongly predisposed to Alzheimer's disease (AD), due to triplication 
of the APP gene, with ∼100% penetrance of AD brain pathology by age 40 and 
variable onset of dementia thereafter. It remains unclear what role other 
triplicated genes play in the pathophysiology of DS-associated AD (DS-AD). Using 
mouse models of DS-AD, we demonstrate that triplication of other chr21 genes has 
paradoxical effects on learning and memory in DS-AD mice, exacerbating some 
phenotypes and attenuating others. Spatial transcriptomic analysis revealed 
genome-wide alterations typified by upregulation of interferon (IFN) signatures 
and elevated levels of disease-associated microglia with concomitant decreases 
in neurons in DS-AD animals. Finally, systemic treatment with a JAK inhibitor 
improved cognition and rescued gene expression changes in DS-AD animals, 
indicating that IFN may be a driver of pathophysiology in DS-AD that could be 
amenable to therapeutic intervention.
