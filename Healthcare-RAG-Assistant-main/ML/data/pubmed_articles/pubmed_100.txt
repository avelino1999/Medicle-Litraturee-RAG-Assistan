BACKGROUND: Diagnostic criteria for progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) include 
midbrain atrophy in MRI and hypometabolism in [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose 
(FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) as supportive features. Due to limited 
data regarding their relative and sequential value, there is no recommendation 
for an algorithm to combine both modalities to increase diagnostic accuracy. 
This study evaluated the added value of sequential imaging using 
state-of-the-art methods to analyse the images regarding PSP features.
METHODS: The retrospective study included 41 PSP patients, 21 with Richardson's 
syndrome (PSP-RS), 20 with variant PSP phenotypes (vPSP) and 46 sex- and 
age-matched healthy controls. A pretrained support vector machine (SVM) for the 
classification of atrophy profiles from automatic MRI volumetry was used to 
analyse T1w-MRI (output: MRI-SVM-PSP score). Covariance pattern analysis was 
applied to compute the expression of a predefined PSP-related pattern in FDG-PET 
(output: PET-PSPRP expression score).
RESULTS: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the 
detection of PSP did not differ between MRI-SVM-PSP and PET-PSPRP expression 
score (p≥0.63): about 0.90, 0.95 and 0.85 for detection of all PSP, PSP-RS and 
vPSP. The MRI-SVM-PSP score achieved about 13% higher specificity and about 15% 
lower sensitivity than the PET-PSPRP expression score. Decision tree models 
selected the MRI-SVM-PSP score for the first branching and the PET-PSPRP 
expression score for a second split of the subgroup with normal MRI-SVM-PSP 
score, both in the whole sample and when restricted to PSP-RS or vPSP.
CONCLUSIONS: FDG-PET provides added value for PSP-suspected patients with 
normal/inconclusive T1w-MRI, regardless of PSP phenotype and the methods to 
analyse the images for PSP-typical features.

INTRODUCTION: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an intermediate phase between 
normal cognitive ageing and dementia and poses a serious threat to public health 
worldwide; however, it might be reversible, representing the best opportunity 
for secondary prevention against serious cognitive impairment. As a 
non-pharmacological intervention for those patients, interventions that combine 
physical exercise and cognitive training, whether delivered simultaneously or 
sequentially, may have superior effects on various cognitive domains, including 
global cognition, memory, executive function and attention. The supportive 
evidence remains incomplete. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of a 
combined exercise and cognitive intervention in Chinese older adults with mild 
cognitive impairment (COGITO), empowered by digital therapy and guided by the 
Health Action Process Model and the Theory of Planned Behaviour (HAPA-TPB 
theory) in a home-based setting.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is a randomised controlled, assessor-blinded 
multi-centre study. Four parallel groups will include a total of 160 patients, 
receiving either a combined exercise and cognitive intervention, an isolated 
exercise intervention, an isolated cognitive intervention or only health 
education. These interventions will be conducted at least twice a week for 
50 min each session, over 3 months. All interventions will be delivered at home 
and remotely monitored through RehabApp and Mini-programme, along with an 
arm-worn heart rate telemetry device. Specifically, supervisors will receive 
participants' real-time training diaries, heart rates or other online monitoring 
data and then provide weekly telephone calls and monthly home visits to 
encourage participants to complete their tasks and address any difficulties 
based on their training information. Eligible participants are 
community-dwelling patients with no regular exercise habit and diagnosed with 
MCI. The primary outcome is cognitive function assessed by the Alzheimer's 
Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-Cog) and Community Screening Instrument 
for Dementia (CSI-D), with baseline and three follow-up assessments. Secondary 
outcomes include quality of life, physical fitness, sleep quality, intrinsic 
capacity, frailty, social support, adherence, cost-effectiveness and 
cost-benefit.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study was approved by the Institutional Review 
Board of Peking University. Research findings will be presented to stakeholders 
and published in peer-reviewed journals and at provincial, national and 
international conferences.

INTRODUCTION: There are many myths regarding Alzheimer's disease (AD) that have 
been circulated on the internet, each exhibiting varying degrees of accuracy, 
inaccuracy, and misinformation. Large language models, such as ChatGPT, may be a 
valuable tool to help assess these myths for veracity and inaccuracy; however, 
they can induce misinformation as well.
OBJECTIVE: This study assesses ChatGPT's ability to identify and address AD 
myths with reliable information.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of attending geriatric medicine 
clinicians' evaluation of ChatGPT (GPT 4.0) responses to 16 selected AD myths. 
We prompted ChatGPT to express its opinion on each myth and implemented a survey 
using REDCap to determine the degree to which clinicians agreed with the 
accuracy of each of ChatGPT's explanations. We also collected their explanations 
of any disagreements with ChatGPT's responses. We used a 5-category Likert-type 
scale with a score ranging from -2 to 2 to quantify clinicians' agreement in 
each aspect of the evaluation.
RESULTS: The clinicians (n = 10) were generally satisfied with ChatGPT's 
explanations. Among the 16 myths, the clinicians were generally satisfied with 
these explanations, with [mean (SD) score of 1.1(±0.3)]. Most clinicians 
selected "Agree" or "Strongly Agree" for each statement. Some statements 
obtained a small number of "Disagree" responses. There were no "Strongly 
Disagree" responses.
CONCLUSION: Most surveyed health care professionals acknowledged the potential 
value of ChatGPT in mitigating AD misinformation; however, the need for more 
refined and detailed explanations of the disease's mechanisms and treatments was 
highlighted.

Spinal cord (SC) atrophy obtained from structural magnetic resonance imaging has 
gained relevance as an indicator of neurodegeneration in various neurological 
disorders. The common method to assess SC atrophy is by comparing numerical 
differences of the cross-sectional spinal cord area (CSA) between time points. 
However, this indirect approach leads to considerable variability in the 
obtained results. Studies showed that this limitation can be overcome by using a 
registration-based technique. The present study introduces the Structural Image 
Evaluation using Normalization of Atrophy on the Spinal Cord (SIENA-SC), which 
is an adapted version of the original SIENA method, designed to directly 
calculate the percentage of SC volume change over time from clinical brain MRI 
acquired with an extended field of view to cover the superior part of the 
cervical SC. In this work, we compared SIENA-SC with the Generalized Boundary 
Shift Integral (GBSI) and the CSA change. On a scan-rescan dataset, SIENA-SC was 
shown to have the lowest measurement error than the other two methods. When 
comparing a group of 190 Healthy Controls with a group of 65 Multiple Sclerosis 
patients, SIENA-SC provided significantly higher yearly rates of atrophy in 
patients than in controls and a lower sample size when measured for treatment 
effect sizes of 50%, 30% and 10%. Our findings indicate that SIENA-SC is a 
robust, reproducible, and sensitive approach for assessing longitudinal changes 
in spinal cord volume, providing neuroscientists with an accessible and 
automated tool able to reduce the need for manual intervention and minimize 
variability in measurements.

Brain rhythms provide the timing for recruitment of brain activity required for 
linking together neuronal ensembles engaged in specific tasks. The 
γ-oscillations (30 to 120 Hz) orchestrate neuronal circuits underlying cognitive 
processes and working memory. These oscillations are reduced in numerous 
neurological and psychiatric disorders, including early cognitive decline in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we report on a potent brain-permeable small 
molecule, DDL-920 that increases γ-oscillations and improves cognition/memory in 
a mouse model of AD, thus showing promise as a class of therapeutics for AD. We 
employed anatomical, in vitro and in vivo electrophysiological, and behavioral 
methods to examine the effects of our lead therapeutic candidate small molecule. 
As a novel in central nervous system pharmacotherapy, our lead molecule acts as 
a potent, efficacious, and selective negative allosteric modulator of the 
γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors most likely assembled from α1β2δ subunits. 
These receptors, identified through anatomical and pharmacological means, 
underlie the tonic inhibition of parvalbumin (PV) expressing interneurons 
(PV+INs) critically involved in the generation of γ-oscillations. When orally 
administered twice daily for 2 wk, DDL-920 restored the cognitive/memory 
impairments of 3- to 4-mo-old AD model mice as measured by their performance in 
the Barnes maze. Our approach is unique as it is meant to enhance cognitive 
performance and working memory in a state-dependent manner by engaging and 
amplifying the brain's endogenous γ-oscillations through enhancing the function 
of PV+INs.

Ginkgo biloba extracts (GBE) have been shown to effectively improve cognitive 
function in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). One potential therapeutic 
strategy for AD is to prevent loss of adult hippocampal neurons. While recent 
studies have reported that GBE protects against oxidative stress in neurons, the 
underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, an AD-like rat model was 
established via bidirectional injection of amyloid beta 25-35 (Aβ25-35; 20 μg) 
in the hippocampal CA1 region. Learning and memory abilities of experimental 
rats were AD assessed in response to oral administration of 7.5 g/L or 15 g/L 
Ginkgo biloba extract 50 (GBE50) solution and the peroxidation phenomenon of 
hippocampal mitochondria determined via analysis of mitochondrial H2O2 and 
several related enzymes. Levels of the oxidative stress-related signaling factor 
cytochrome C (Cyto C), apoptosis-related proteins (Bax, Bcl-2 and caspase-3) and 
caspase-activated DNase (CAD) were further detected via western blot. 
8-Hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), the major product of DNA oxidative stress, was 
evaluated to analyze DNA status. Our results showed elevated H2O2 levels and 
monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity, and conversely, a decrease in the activities 
of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in the 
hippocampus of AD rats. Administration of GBE50 regulated the activities of 
these three enzymes and induced a decrease in H2O2. GBE50 exerted regulatory 
effects on abnormally expressed apoptotic proteins in the AD rat hippocampus, 
enhancing the expression of Bcl-2, inhibiting release of Cyto C from 
mitochondria, and suppressing the level of caspase-3 (excluding cleaved 
caspase-3). Furthermore, GBE50 inhibited DNA damage by lowering the generation 
of 8-OHdG rather than influencing expression of CAD. The collective findings 
support a protective role of GBE50 in hippocampal neurons of AD-like animals 
against mitochondrial oxidative stress.

Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, and imposes a substantial 
socioeconomic burden with little impact especially on aggressive types of 
cancer. Conventional therapies have many serious side effects including 
generalised systemic toxicity which limits their long-term use. Tumour 
resistance and recurrence is another main problem associated with conventional 
therapy. Purified or extracted natural products have been investigated as 
cost-effective cancer chemoprotective agents with the potential to reverse or 
delaying carcinogenesis. Curcumin (CUR) as a natural polyphenolic component, 
exhibits many pharmacological activities such as anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, 
anti-microbial, activity against neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer, 
antidiabetic activities (type II diabetes), anticoagulant properties, wound 
healing effects in both preclinical and clinical studies. Despite these 
effective protective properties, CUR has several limitations, including poor 
aqueous solubility, low bioavailability, chemical instability, rapid metabolism 
and a short half-life time. To overcome the pharmaceutical problems associated 
with free CUR, novel nanomedicine strategies (including polymeric nanoparticles 
(NPs) such as poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) NPs have been developed. 
These formulations have the potential to improve the therapeutic efficacy of 
curcuminoids. In this review, we comprehensively summarise and discuss recent in 
vitro and in vivo studies to explore the pharmaceutical significance and 
clinical benefits of PLGA-NPs delivery system to improve the efficacy of CUR in 
the treatment of cancer.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), a prevalent cognitive disorder among the elderly, is 
frequently linked to the abnormal accumulation of myloid-β (Aβ), which is mainly 
as a result of neuronal death and inflammation. Diosmin, a flavonoid, is 
considered a potential drug for the treatment of AD. Our study aimed to uncover 
the molecular mechanism of diosmin in AD therapy. Here, rats were randomly 
divided into three groups: control, Aβ25-35, and Aβ25-35 + diosmin groups. AD 
model rats were induced by Aβ25-35 intraventricular injection, meanwhile 
50 mg/kg diosmin was orally administered for 6-week intervention. Morris water 
maze test assessed learning and memory abilities. Hippocampal neuronal damage 
was determined by HE, Nissl, and TUNEL staining. These assays indicate that 
diosmin improves cognitive dysfunction and reduces hippocampal neuronal loss and 
apoptosis. Western blot showed that diosmin reduced Bax (1.21 ± 0.12) and 
cleaved caspase-3 (1.27 ± 0.12) expression, and increased Bcl-2 (0.70 ± 0.06), 
p-PI3K (0.71 ± 0.08), and p-AKT (0.96 ± 0.10) in the hippocampus. ELISA 
indicated diosmin reduces IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α levels, suggesting 
anti-inflammation effect. These results suggest that diosmin inhibits neuronal 
apoptosis and neuroinflammatory responses to improve cognitive dysfunction in AD 
rats, possibly related to upregulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway, providing a 
scientific basis for its use in AD treatment.

We elucidated the molecular fingerprint of vulnerable excitatory neurons within 
select cortical lamina of individuals with Down syndrome (DS) for mechanistic 
understanding and therapeutic potential that also informs Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) pathophysiology. Frontal cortex (BA9) layer III (L3) and layer V (L5) 
pyramidal neurons were microisolated from postmortem human DS and age- and 
sex-matched controls (CTR) to interrogate differentially expressed genes (DEGs) 
and key biological pathways relevant to neurodegenerative programs. We 
identified > 2300 DEGs exhibiting convergent dysregulation of gene expression in 
both L3 and L5 pyramidal neurons in individuals with DS versus CTR subjects. 
DEGs included over 100 triplicated human chromosome 21 genes in L3 and L5 
neurons, demonstrating a trisomic neuronal karyotype in both laminae. In 
addition, thousands of other DEGs were identified, indicating gene dysregulation 
is not limited to trisomic genes in the aged DS brain, which we postulate is 
relevant to AD pathobiology. Convergent L3 and L5 DEGs highlighted pertinent 
biological pathways and identified key pathway-associated targets likely 
underlying corticocortical neurodegeneration and related cognitive decline in 
individuals with DS. Select key DEGs were interrogated as potential hub genes 
driving dysregulation, namely the triplicated DEGs amyloid precursor protein 
(APP) and superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), along with key signaling DEGs including 
mitogen activated protein kinase 1 and 3 (MAPK1, MAPK3) and calcium calmodulin 
dependent protein kinase II alpha (CAMK2A), among others. Hub DEGs determined 
from multiple pathway analyses identified potential therapeutic candidates for 
amelioration of cortical neuron dysfunction and cognitive decline in DS with 
translational relevance to AD.

Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, 
and Huntington's disease, pose significant health challenges and economic 
burdens worldwide. Recent studies have emphasized the potential therapeutic 
value of activating silent information regulator-1 (SIRT1) in treating these 
conditions. Resveratrol, a compound known for its ability to potently activate 
SIRT1, has demonstrated promising neuroprotective effects by targeting the 
underlying mechanisms of neurodegeneration. In this review, we delve into the 
crucial role of resveratrol-mediated SIRT1 upregulation in improving 
neurodegenerative diseases. The role of the activation of SIRT1 by resveratrol 
was reviewed. Moreover, network pharmacology was used to elucidate the possible 
mechanisms of resveratrol in these diseases. Activation of SIRT1 by resveratrol 
had positive effects on neuronal function and survival and alleviated the 
hallmark features of these diseases, such as protein aggregation, oxidative 
stress, neuroinflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. In terms of network 
pharmacology, the signaling pathways by which resveratrol protects against 
different neurodegenerative diseases were slightly different. Although the 
precise mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of resveratrol and 
SIRT1 activation remain under investigation, these findings offer valuable 
insights into potential therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases.

The neurotrophic growth factor brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a 
crucial role in various neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases, such as 
Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia and depression. BDNF has been proposed as a 
potential biomarker for diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring therapy. 
Understanding the factors influencing BDNF levels and whether they follow a 
circadian rhythm is essential for interpreting fluctuations in BDNF 
measurements. We aimed to investigate the circadian rhythm of BDNF by collecting 
multiple peripheral venous blood samples from young, healthy male participants 
at 12 different time points over 24 h. In addition, vital parameters, cortisol 
and insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF1) were measured to explore potential 
regulatory mechanisms, interfering variables and their correlations with BDNF 
concentration. The findings revealed that plasma BDNF did not exhibit any 
significant fluctuations over 24 h, suggesting the absence of a circadian 
rhythm. However, serum BDNF levels decreased during sleep. Furthermore, serum 
BDNF showed a positive correlation with heart rate but a negative correlation 
with IGF1. No significant correlation was observed between cortisol and BDNF or 
IGF1. Although plasma BDNF suggests steady-state conditions, the decline of 
serum BDNF during the nocturnal period could be attributed to physical 
inactivity and associated with reduced haemodynamic blood flow (heart rate 
reduction during sleep). The type of sample collection (peripheral venous 
cannula vs. blood sampling using a butterfly system) does not significantly 
affect the measured BDNF levels. The sample collection during the day did not 
significantly affect BDNF analysis, emphasizing the importance of considering 
activity levels rather than timing when designing standardized protocols for 
BDNF assessments.

Recent approvals of amyloid immunotherapy drugs for early Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) have been highly controversial. In this piece, we consider challenges from 
the clinical, population health, and health systems perspectives to the role 
that the new AD drugs might be expected to play, now and in the future, in 
alleviating the morbidity caused by AD in the population. Clinically, short-term 
effects are small, adverse events are frequent, treatment regimens are 
burdensome, and, crucially, long-term effects are unknown. At a population 
level, there is always likely to be a trade-off between breadth of access and 
magnitude of benefit for any given individual. At a health system level, roll 
out of treatment even for only narrowly-defined patient groups will involve 
considerable resources to identify and treat eligible patients, with profound 
opportunity costs. Our considered view on current evidence is that there are 
challenges from each perspective to imagining a foreseeable future in which 
amyloid immunotherapy significantly alleviates AD morbidity at scale. 
HIGHLIGHTS: Recent approvals of Alzheimer's drugs have met with excitement but 
also controversy. Trial effects are small, adverse effects concerning, and 
long-term effects unknown. Results from trial cohorts may not generalize to 
broader, more complex patients. Significant resource requirements of eligibility 
assessment and drug administration. Use in "presymptomatic" populations is not 
supported by current evidence.

A reduction in adult neurogenesis is associated with behavioral abnormalities in 
patients with Alzheimer's disease. Consequently, enhancing adult neurogenesis 
represents a promising therapeutic approach for mitigating disease symptoms and 
progression. Nonetheless, non-pharmacological interventions aimed at inducing 
adult neurogenesis are currently limited. Although individual 
non-pharmacological interventions, such as aerobic exercise, acousto-optic 
stimulation, and olfactory stimulation, have shown limited capacity to improve 
neurogenesis and cognitive function in patients with Alzheimer's disease, the 
therapeutic effect of a strategy that combines these interventions has not been 
fully explored. In this study, we observed an age-dependent decrease in adult 
neurogenesis and a concurrent increase in amyloid-beta accumulation in the 
hippocampus of amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1 mice aged 2-8 months. 
Amyloid deposition became evident at 4 months, while neurogenesis declined by 6 
months, further deteriorating as the disease progressed. However, following a 
4-week multifactor stimulation protocol, which encompassed treadmill running (46 
min/d, 10 m/min, 6 days per week), 40 Hz acousto-optic stimulation (1 hour/day, 
6 days/week), and olfactory stimulation (1 hour/day, 6 days/week), we found a 
significant increase in the number of newborn cells 
(5'-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine-positive cells), immature neurons 
(doublecortin-positive cells), newborn immature neurons 
(5'-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine-positive/doublecortin-positive cells), and newborn 
astrocytes (5'-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine-positive/glial fibrillary acidic 
protein-positive cells). Additionally, the amyloid-beta load in the hippocampus 
decreased. These findings suggest that multifactor stimulation can enhance adult 
hippocampal neurogenesis and mitigate amyloid-beta neuropathology in amyloid 
precursor protein/presenilin 1 mice. Furthermore, cognitive abilities were 
improved, and depressive symptoms were alleviated in amyloid precursor 
protein/presenilin 1 mice following multifactor stimulation, as evidenced by 
Morris water maze, novel object recognition, forced swimming test, and tail 
suspension test results. Notably, the efficacy of multifactor stimulation in 
consolidating immature neurons persisted for at least 2 weeks after treatment 
cessation. At the molecular level, multifactor stimulation upregulated the 
expression of neuron-related proteins (NeuN, doublecortin, postsynaptic density 
protein-95, and synaptophysin), anti-apoptosis-related proteins (Bcl-2 and 
PARP), and an autophagy-associated protein (LC3B), while decreasing the 
expression of apoptosis-related proteins (BAX and caspase-9), in the hippocampus 
of amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1 mice. These observations might be 
attributable to both the brain-derived neurotrophic factor-mediated signaling 
pathway and antioxidant pathways. Furthermore, serum metabolomics analysis 
indicated that multifactor stimulation regulated differentially expressed 
metabolites associated with cell apoptosis, oxidative damage, and cognition. 
Collectively, these findings suggest that multifactor stimulation is a novel 
non-invasive approach for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

Wnt/β-catenin pathway as a potential target for Parkinson's disease: a cohort 
study of romosozumab using routinely collected health data in Japan.

INTRODUCTION: Romosozumab is a monoclonal antibody approved for osteoporosis 
which targets sclerostin, an endogenous inhibitor of Wnt/β-catenin pathway. 
Given the essential roles of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in various tissues, we 
hypothesized romosozumab treatment may influence other conditions.
METHODS: This cohort study included patients prescribed romosozumab or 
parathyroid receptor (PTHR) agonists after 1 January 2019, using a Japanese 
electronic medical record database. The outcomes of interest included autoimmune 
disease, interstitial pneumonia, cardiovascular outcome, Alzheimer's disease, 
Parkinson's disease (PD), serious infections, and malignancies. A stabilized 
inverse probability-weighted Cox proportional hazard model was used to estimate 
the hazard ratios. Age- and gender-based subgroup analyses were conducted. 
Exploratory outcomes based on three-digit International Classification of 
Diseases 10th Revision-based were also examined.
RESULTS: In total, 2,673 patients treated with romosozumab and 5,980 treated 
with PTHR agonists were identified, respectively. While most outcomes of 
interest showed no association with romosozumab, the risk of PD decreased with 
romosozumab (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval], 0.37 [0.14-0.94]) compared 
with PTHR agonist. Regarding the cardiovascular outcome, no notable association 
was identified overall; however, gender-based subgroup analysis suggested that 
male sex may be a potential risk factor with romosozumab treatment. Only 16 of 
903 exploratory outcomes were potentially influenced by romosozumab.
CONCLUSION: Romosozumab lowered the risk of PD development compared with PTHR 
agonist. The study also highlights the utility of routinely collected health 
data for drug repositioning. While further validation is warranted, the findings 
suggest that the Wnt-β-catenin pathway holds promise as a therapeutic target for 
PD.

Studies have shown that vascular dysfunction is closely related to the 
pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. The middle temporal gyrus region of the 
brain is susceptible to pronounced impairment in Alzheimer's disease. 
Identification of the molecules involved in vascular aberrance of the middle 
temporal gyrus would support elucidation of the mechanisms underlying 
Alzheimer's disease and discovery of novel targets for intervention. We carried 
out single-cell transcriptomic analysis of the middle temporal gyrus in the 
brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease and healthy controls, revealing 
obvious changes in vascular function. CellChat analysis of intercellular 
communication in the middle temporal gyrus showed that the number of cell 
interactions in this region was decreased in Alzheimer's disease patients, with 
altered intercellular communication of endothelial cells and pericytes being the 
most prominent. Differentially expressed genes were also identified. Using the 
CellChat results, AUCell evaluation of the pathway activity of specific cells 
showed that the obvious changes in vascular function in the middle temporal 
gyrus in Alzheimer's disease were directly related to changes in the vascular 
endothelial growth factor (VEGF)A-VEGF receptor (VEGFR) 2 pathway. AUCell 
analysis identified subtypes of endothelial cells and pericytes directly related 
to VEGFA-VEGFR2 pathway activity. Two subtypes of middle temporal gyrus cells 
showed significant alteration in AD: endothelial cells with high expression of 
Erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ERBB4 high ) and pericytes with high 
expression of angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4 high ). Finally, combining bulk RNA 
sequencing data and two machine learning algorithms (least absolute shrinkage 
and selection operator and random forest), four characteristic Alzheimer's 
disease feature genes were identified: somatostatin ( SST ), protein tyrosine 
phosphatase non-receptor type 3 ( PTPN3 ), glutinase ( GL3 ), and tropomyosin 3 
( PTM3 ). These genes were downregulated in the middle temporal gyrus of 
patients with Alzheimer's disease and may be used to target the VEGF pathway. 
Alzheimer's disease mouse models demonstrated consistent altered expression of 
these genes in the middle temporal gyrus. In conclusion, this study detected 
changes in intercellular communication between endothelial cells and pericytes 
in the middle temporal gyrus and identified four novel feature genes related to 
middle temporal gyrus and vascular functioning in patients with Alzheimer's 
disease. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the molecular 
mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease and present novel treatment targets.

Traumatic brain injury, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, and Alzheimer's 
disease are three distinct neurological disorders that share common 
pathophysiological mechanisms involving neuroinflammation. One sequela of 
neuroinflammation includes the pathologic hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, 
an endogenous microtubule-associated protein that protects the integrity of 
neuronal cytoskeletons. Tau hyperphosphorylation results in protein misfolding 
and subsequent accumulation of tau tangles forming neurotoxic aggregates. These 
misfolded proteins are characteristic of traumatic brain injury, chronic 
traumatic encephalopathy, and Alzheimer's disease and can lead to downstream 
neuroinflammatory processes, including assembly and activation of the 
inflammasome complex. Inflammasomes refer to a family of multimeric protein 
units that, upon activation, release a cascade of signaling molecules resulting 
in caspase-induced cell death and inflammation mediated by the release of 
interleukin-1β cytokine. One specific inflammasome, the NOD-like receptor 
protein 3, has been proposed to be a key regulator of tau phosphorylation where 
it has been shown that prolonged NOD-like receptor protein 3 activation acts as 
a causal factor in pathological tau accumulation and spreading. This review 
begins by describing the epidemiology and pathophysiology of traumatic brain 
injury, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, and Alzheimer's disease. Next, we 
highlight neuroinflammation as an overriding theme and discuss the role of the 
NOD-like receptor protein 3 inflammasome in the formation of tau deposits and 
how such tauopathic entities spread throughout the brain. We then propose a 
novel framework linking traumatic brain injury, chronic traumatic 
encephalopathy, and Alzheimer's disease as inflammasome-dependent pathologies 
that exist along a temporal continuum. Finally, we discuss potential therapeutic 
targets that may intercept this pathway and ultimately minimize long-term 
neurological decline.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive disease that causes an impairment of 
learning and memory. Despite the highly complex pathogenesis of AD, amyloid beta 
(Aβ) deposition and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) formation are the main 
hallmarks of AD. Neuroinflammation also has a crucial role in the development of 
AD. As the central nervous system's innate immune cells, microglial cells are 
activated in AD and induce inflammation by producing pro-inflammatory mediators. 
However, microglial activation is not always deleterious. M2-activated 
microglial cells are considered anti-inflammatory cells, which develop 
neuroprotection. Various approaches are proposed for managing AD, yet no 
effective therapy is available for this disorder. Considering the potential 
protective role of M2 microglia in neurodegenerative disorders and the 
improvement of these disorders by preconditioning approaches, it can be 
suggested that preconditioning of microglial cells may be beneficial for 
managing AD progression. Therefore, this study review microglial preconditioning 
approaches for preventing and improving AD.

Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome has been implicated in Parkinson's disease 
(PD) based on in vitro and in vivo studies. Clinical trials targeting the NLRP3 
inflammasome in PD are ongoing. However, the evidence supporting NLRP3's 
involvement in PD from human genetics data is limited. We analyzed common and 
rare variants in NLRP3 inflammasome-related genes in PD cohorts, performed 
pathway-specific polygenic risk score (PRS) analyses, and studied causal 
associations using Mendelian randomization (MR) with the NLRP3 components and 
the cytokines IL-1β and IL-18. Our findings showed no associations of common or 
rare variants, nor of the pathway PRS with PD. MR suggests that altering the 
expression of the NLRP3 inflammasome, IL-1β, or IL-18, does not affect PD risk 
or progression. Therefore, our results do not support a role for the NLRP3 
inflammasome in PD pathogenesis or as a target for drug development.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is characterized by an accumulation of pathologic 
amyloid-beta (Aβ) and Tau proteins, neuroinflammation, metabolic changes and 
neuronal death. Reactive astrocytes participate in these pathophysiological 
processes by releasing pro-inflammatory molecules and recruiting the immune 
system, which further reinforces inflammation and contributes to neuronal death. 
Besides these neurotoxic effects, astrocytes can protect neurons by providing 
them with high amounts of lactate as energy fuel. Astrocytes rely on aerobic 
glycolysis to generate lactate by reducing pyruvate, the end product of 
glycolysis, through lactate dehydrogenase. Consequently, limited amounts of 
pyruvate enter astrocytic mitochondria through the Mitochondrial Pyruvate 
Carrier (MPC) to be oxidized. The MPC is a heterodimer composed of two subunits 
MPC1 and MPC2, the function of which in astrocytes has been poorly investigated. 
Here, we analyzed the role of the MPC in the pathogeny of AD, knowing that a 
reduction in overall glucose metabolism has been associated with a drop in 
cognitive performances and an accumulation of Aβ and Tau. We generated 3xTgAD 
mice in which MPC1 was knocked-out in astrocytes specifically and focused our 
study on the biochemical hallmarks of the disease, mainly Aβ and neurofibrillary 
tangle production. We show that inhibition of the MPC before the onset of the 
disease significantly reduces the quantity of Aβ and Tau aggregates in the brain 
of 3xTgAD mice, suggesting that acting on astrocytic glucose metabolism early on 
could hinder the progression of the disease.

BACKGROUND: Patient and public involvement (PPI) is a critical priority in 
research, policy, academia and advocacy organizations. PPI in dementia research 
is gaining momentum. However, these efforts are missing in international 
projects aimed at those living with advanced dementia in long-term care (LTC) 
homes. Additional complexities can arise in enacting PPI within the context of 
integration of a palliative approach to care and experiences around end-of-life 
in (EOL) dementia. The mySupport study involved implementing the Family Carer 
Decision Support (FCDS) intervention for care partners of those living with 
advanced dementia in LTC in six countries.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND OBJECTIVE: An interpretive description study was conducted 
to explore the perspectives of international researchers from six countries on 
engaging people with lived experiences of dementia and EOL care in research 
processes. The findings from this study informed the development of a PPI 
strategy and a subsequent toolkit for the FCDS intervention.
FINDINGS: Thirty-eight interviews were completed with project researchers: 12 
from the United Kingdom, 8 from Canada, 7 from Ireland, 4 each from Italy and 
The Netherlands and 3 from the Czech Republic. Four broad themes describe 
international researchers' perspectives on advancing methods of engagement for 
people with lived experiences of dementia and EOL in international PPI 
activities: (1) Groundwork to engage in research; (2) planning for research 
activities is key; (3) focus on meaningful engagement and (4) having foresight 
for practical issues shaping PPI.
DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: International projects that involve PPI can present 
many sources of challenges. The findings in this study highlight important 
considerations for foundational work for incorporating PPI in international 
projects. Learning from world leaders and those with lived experiences in 
various regions can be insightful and help share tools and resources.
PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: PPI was envisioned as a critical part of 
conducting the mySupport study. The findings from this study informed the 
development of a PPI strategy and an international Strategic Guiding Council 
that included family carers of those living with advanced dementia in LTC homes 
in six countries. This manuscript focused on the perspectives of researchers on 
their engagement with people with lived experiences of dementia and EOL. The 
perspectives of persons with lived experiences on engaging in the mySupport 
research study will be reported in a forthcoming manuscript.

In recent years, significant advancements have been made in understanding 
Alzheimer's disease from both neurobiological and clinical perspectives. 
Exploring the complex systems underlying AD has unveiled insights that could 
potentially revolutionize therapeutic approaches. Recent investigations have 
highlighted intricate interactions among genetic, molecular, and environmental 
factors in AD. Optimism arises from neurobiological advancements and diverse 
treatment options, potentially slowing or halting disease progression. 
Amyloid-beta plaques and tau protein tangles crucially influence AD onset and 
progression. Emerging treatments involve diverse strategies, such as approaches 
targeting multiple pathways involved in AD pathogenesis, such as inflammation, 
oxidative stress, and synaptic dysfunction pathways. Clinical trials using 
humanized monoclonal antibodies, focusing on immunotherapies eliminating 
amyloid-beta, have shown promise. Nonpharmacological interventions such as light 
therapy, electrical stimulation, cognitive training, physical activity, and 
dietary changes have drawn attention for their potential to slow cognitive aging 
and enhance brain health. Precision medicine, which involves tailoring therapies 
to individual genetic and molecular profiles, has gained traction. Ongoing 
research and interdisciplinary collaboration are expected to yield more 
effective treatments.

INTRODUCTION: Disturbance in naming accuracy and reaction time (RT) is one of 
the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Naming performance can be considered 
a diagnostic key in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which has 
remained diagnostically challenging. Although most of the studies in this field 
have been conducted on the naming accuracy of common nouns, others have shown 
that proper nouns are more sensitive for detecting the onset of AD. This study 
aims to compare the naming of common and proper nouns.
METHOD: Eighty pictures of common and proper nouns (40 items each) were 
presented to 18 healthy older adults and 18 people with mild Alzheimer's disease 
using DMDX software on a laptop computer. The patients' responses were 
transcribed into a pre-designed form, and their reaction times were captured by 
DMDX.
RESULTS: Study results indicated a significant difference in the number of 
errors and RTs between proper and common nouns in patients with mild Alzheimer's 
disease (p-value=), implying that proper nouns may be more sensitive to mild AD. 
Moreover, patients with mild Alzheimer's had more problems in common and proper 
nouns than healthy older adults.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that individuals with mild AD experienced 
greater difficulty recalling proper nouns, which were found to be more 
susceptible to the effects of AD.

Stroke and Alzheimer's disease are common neurological disorders and often occur 
in the same individuals. The comorbidity of the two neurological disorders 
represents a grave health threat to older populations. This review presents a 
brief background of the development of novel concepts and their clinical 
potentials. The activity of glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and 
N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-mediated Ca 2+ influx is critical for neuronal 
function. An ischemic insult induces prompt and excessive glutamate release and 
drastic increases of intracellular Ca 2+ mainly via N-methyl-D-aspartate 
receptors, particularly of those at the extrasynaptic site. This Ca 2+ -evoked 
neuronal cell death in the ischemic core is dominated by necrosis within a few 
hours and days known as acute excitotoxicity. Furthermore, mild but sustained Ca 
2+ increases under neurodegenerative conditions such as in the distant penumbra 
of the ischemic brain and early stages of Alzheimer's disease are not 
immediately toxic, but gradually set off deteriorating Ca 2+ -dependent signals 
and neuronal cell loss mostly because of activation of programmed cell death 
pathways. Based on the Ca 2+ hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease and recent 
advances, this Ca 2+ -activated "silent" degenerative excitotoxicity evolves 
from years to decades and is recognized as a unique slow and chronic 
neuropathogenesis. The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit GluN3A, primarily 
at the extrasynaptic site, serves as a gatekeeper for the N-methyl-D-aspartate 
receptor activity and is neuroprotective against both acute and chronic 
excitotoxicity. Ischemic stroke and Alzheimer's disease, therefore, share an 
N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor- and Ca 2+ -mediated mechanism, although with much 
different time courses. It is thus proposed that early interventions to control 
Ca 2+ homeostasis at the preclinical stage are pivotal for individuals who are 
susceptible to sporadic late-onset Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's 
disease-related dementia. This early treatment simultaneously serves as a 
preconditioning therapy against ischemic stroke that often attacks the same 
individuals during abnormal aging.

Alzheimer's disease poses a significant global health challenge owing to the 
progressive cognitive decline of patients and absence of curative treatments. 
The current therapeutic strategies, primarily based on cholinesterase inhibitors 
and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists, offer limited symptomatic relief 
without halting disease progression, highlighting an urgent need for novel 
research directions that address the key mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's 
disease. Recent studies have provided insights into the critical role of 
glycolysis, a fundamental energy metabolism pathway in the brain, in the 
pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Alterations in glycolytic processes within 
neurons and glial cells, including microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, 
have been identified as significant contributors to the pathological landscape 
of Alzheimer's disease. Glycolytic changes impact neuronal health and function, 
thus offering promising targets for therapeutic intervention. The purpose of 
this review is to consolidate current knowledge on the modifications in 
glycolysis associated with Alzheimer's disease and explore the mechanisms by 
which these abnormalities contribute to disease onset and progression. 
Comprehensive focus on the pathways through which glycolytic dysfunction 
influences Alzheimer's disease pathology should provide insights into potential 
therapeutic targets and strategies that pave the way for groundbreaking 
treatments, emphasizing the importance of understanding metabolic processes in 
the quest for clarification and management of Alzheimer's disease.

As a form of dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD) suffers from no efficacious 
cure, yet AD treatment is still imperative, as it ameliorates the symptoms or 
prevents it from deteriorating or maintains the current status to the longest 
extent. The human brain is the most sensitive and complex organ in the body, 
which is protected by the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This yet induces the 
difficulty in curing AD as the drugs or nanomaterials that are much inhibited 
from reaching the lesion site. Thus, BBB crossing capability of drug delivery 
system remains a significant challenge in the development of neurological 
therapeutics. Fortunately, nano-enabled delivery systems possess promising 
potential to achieve multifunctional diagnostics/therapeutics against various 
targets of AD owing to their intriguing advantages of nanocarriers, including 
easy multifunctionalization on surfaces, high surface-to-volume ratio with large 
payloads, and potential ability to cross the BBB, making them capable of 
conquering the limitations of conventional drug candidates. This review, which 
focuses on the BBB crossing ability of the multifunctional nanomaterials in AD 
diagnosis and treatment, will provide an insightful vision that is conducive to 
the development of AD-related nanomaterials.

Sleep deprivation (SD) is commonplace in today's fast-paced society. SD is a 
severe public health problem globally since it may cause cognitive decline and 
even neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease. Melatonin (MT) is a 
natural chemical secreted by the pineal gland with neuroprotective effects. The 
purpose of this study was to investigate the protective effect and mechanism of 
MT on chronic sleep deprivation-induced cognitive impairment. A 3-week modified 
multi-platform method was used to create the SD rat model. The Morris water maze 
test (MWM), Tissue staining (including Hematoxylin and Eosin (H & E) staining, 
Nissl staining, and immunofluorescence), Western blot, Enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and Quantitative real-time polymerase chain 
reaction (qPCR) were used to investigate the protective effect and mechanism of 
MT in ameliorating cognitive impairment in SD rats. The results showed that MT 
(50 and 100 mg/kg) significantly improved cognitive function in rats, as 
evidenced by a shortening of escape latency and increased time of crossing the 
platform and time spent in the quadrant. Additionally, MT therapy alleviated 
hippocampus neurodegeneration and neuronal loss while lowering levels of 
pathogenic factors (LPS) and inflammatory indicators (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, iNOS, 
and COX2). Furthermore, MT treatment reversed the high expression of Aβ42 and 
Iba1 as well as the low expression of ZO-1 and occludin, and inhibited the 
SD-induced TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway. In summary, MT ameliorated 
spatial recognition and learning memory dysfunction in SD rats by reducing 
neuroinflammation and increasing neuroprotection while inhibiting the 
TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway. Our study supports the use of MT as an 
alternate treatment for SD with cognitive impairment.

Alzheimer's disease has escalated into a critical public health concern, marked 
by its neurodegenerative nature that progressively diminishes cognitive 
abilities. Recognized as a continuously advancing and presently incurable 
condition, AD underscores the necessity for early-stage diagnosis and 
interventions aimed at delaying the decline in mental function. Despite the 
proven efficacy of cerebrospinal fluid and positron emission tomography in 
diagnosing AD, their broader utility is constrained by significant costs and the 
invasive nature of these procedures. Consequently, the innovation of blood 
biomarkers such as Amyloid-beta, phosphorylated-tau, total-tau et al, 
distinguished by their high sensitivity, minimal invasiveness, accessibility, 
and cost-efficiency, emerges as a promising avenue for AD diagnosis. The advent 
of ultra-sensitive detection methodologies, including single-molecule 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry, has 
revolutionized the detection of AD plasma biomarkers, supplanting previous 
low-sensitivity techniques. This rapid advancement in detection technology 
facilitates the more accurate quantification of pathological brain proteins and 
AD-associated biomarkers in the bloodstream. This manuscript meticulously 
reviews the landscape of current research on immunological markers for AD, 
anchored in the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association AT(N) 
research framework. It highlights a selection of forefront ultra-sensitive 
detection technologies now integral to assessing AD blood immunological markers. 
Additionally, this review examines the crucial pre-analytical processing steps 
for AD blood samples that significantly impact research outcomes and addresses 
the practical challenges faced during clinical testing. These discussions are 
crucial for enhancing our comprehension and refining the diagnostic precision of 
AD using blood-based biomarkers. The review aims to shed light on potential 
avenues for innovation and improvement in the techniques employed for detecting 
and investigating AD, thereby contributing to the broader field of 
neurodegenerative disease research.

disease.

University, Bukit Jalil 57000, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. monamohamed@imu.edu.my.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are two major health 
concerns that have seen a rising prevalence worldwide. Recent studies have 
indicated a possible link between DM and an increased risk of developing AD. 
Insulin, while primarily known for its role in regulating blood sugar, also 
plays a vital role in protecting brain functions. Insulin resistance (IR), 
especially prevalent in type 2 diabetes, is believed to play a significant role 
in AD's development. When insulin signalling becomes dysfunctional, it can 
negatively affect various brain functions, making individuals more susceptible 
to AD's defining features, such as the buildup of beta-amyloid plaques and tau 
protein tangles. Emerging research suggests that addressing insulin-related 
issues might help reduce or even reverse the brain changes linked to AD. This 
review aims to explore the rela-tionship between DM and AD, with a focus on the 
role of IR. It also explores the molecular mechanisms by which IR might lead to 
brain changes and assesses current treatments that target IR. Understanding IR's 
role in the connection between DM and AD offers new possibilities for treatments 
and highlights the importance of continued research in this interdisciplinary 
field.

This study investigated the blood‒brain barrier (BBB) permeability of the 
central nervous system (CNS)-active compounds donepezil (DON), methionine (MET), 
and memantine (MEM) by employing a comprehensive in silico approach. These 
compounds are of particular interest for Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapy. 
Rigid-flexible molecular docking simulations indicated favorable binding 
affinities of all the compounds with BBB-ChT, with DON exhibiting the highest 
binding affinity (ΔGbind = -10.26 kcal/mol), predominantly mediated by 
significant hydrophobic interactions. In silico kinetic profiling suggested the 
stability of the DON/BBB-ChT complex, with ligand release prompted by 
conformational changes. 3D molecular alignment corroborated a minor 
conformational shift for DON in its minimal binding energy pose. Predictions 
indicated that active transport mechanisms notably enhance the brain 
distribution of donepezil compared to that of MET and MEM. Additionally, DON and 
MEM exhibited low mutagenic probabilities, while MET was identified as highly 
mutagenic. Overall, these findings highlight the potential of donepezil for 
superior BBB penetration, primarily through active transport mechanisms, 
underscoring the need for further validation through in vitro and in vivo 
studies for effective AD treatment.

The goal of this research was to study the effect of different doses of 
resveratrol (RS) and RS with donepezil (DPZ) on the deposition of amyloid beta 
(Aβ) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in colchicine-induced Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) brain. The study included three months old male Albino Wistar rats 
and consisted of six animal groups: AD model (group 1), treatment groups, RS 
10 mg/kg body weight (group 2), RS 20 mg/kg body weight (group 3), RS 10 mg/kg 
body weight along with DPZ 1 mg/kg body weight (group 6), prophylaxis groups, RS 
10 mg/kg body weight (group 4) and RS 20 mg/kg body weight (group 5). In the 
treatment groups, RS was given for 7 consecutive days from the day of induction 
of AD, and in the prophylaxis groups, we started RS 7 days even before the 
induction of AD and continued for seven days after the induction. The number of 
Aβs and NFTs at the frontal region, cornu ammonis (CA) 1,2,3,4 and dentate gyrus 
regions of hippocampus were evaluated. The immunohistochemical analysis was 
performed by using mouse anti-β-amyloid antibody for the Aβ plaques and 
polyclonal rabbit anti-human tau for the tau-positive neurons. The present study 
observed the accumulation of Aβ plaques and tau-positive neurons in the AD 
model. However, their numbers were significantly decreased in the treatment 
groups (p < 0.001). The best results were observed when RS 10 mg was given 
prophylactically (p < 0.01) and RS along with DPZ (p < 0.001), suggesting the 
neuroprotective effect of RS and its synergistic effect with the DPZ.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most widespread and irreversible form of 
dementia and accounts for more than half of dementia cases. The most significant 
risk factors for AD are aging-related exacerbations, degradation of anatomical 
pathways, environmental variables and mitochondrial dysfunction. Finding a 
decisive therapeutic solution is a major current issue. Nuanced interactions 
between major neuropathological mechanisms in AD in patients and microbiome have 
recently gained rising attention. The presence of bacterial amyloid in the gut 
triggers the immune system, resulting in increased immune feedbacks and 
endogenous neuronal amyloid within the CNS. Also, early clinical research 
revealed that changing the microbiome with beneficial bacteria or probiotics 
could affect brain function in AD. New approaches focus on the possible 
neuroprotective action of disease-modifying medications in AD. In the present 
review, we discuss the impact of the gut microbiota on the brain and review 
emerging research that suggests a disruption in the microbiota-brain axis can 
affect AD by mediating neuroinflammation. Such novel methods could help the 
development of novel therapeutics for AD.

Technology, King Faisal University, Al-Hofuf, Saudi Arabia.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating brain disorder that steadily worsens 
over time. It is marked by a relentless decline in memory and cognitive 
abilities. As the disease progresses, it leads to a significant loss of mental 
function. Early detection of AD is essential to starting treatments that can 
mitigate the progression of this disease and enhance patients' quality of life. 
This study aims to observe AD's brain functional connectivity pattern to extract 
essential patterns through multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) and analyze 
activity patterns across multiple brain voxels. The optimized feature extraction 
techniques are used to obtain the important features for performing the training 
on the models using several hybrid machine learning classifiers for performing 
binary classification and multi-class classification. The proposed approach 
using hybrid machine learning classification has been applied to two public 
datasets named the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) and the AD 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The results are evaluated using performance 
metrics, and comparisons have been made to differentiate between different 
stages of AD using visualization tools.

OBJECTIVE: Cognitive training may benefit older adults with mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI), but the prognostic factors are not well-established.
METHODS: This study analyzed data from a 78-week trial with 107 participants 
with MCI, comparing computerized cognitive training (CCT) and computerized 
crossword puzzle training (CPT). Outcomes were changes in cognitive and 
functional measures from baseline. Linear mixed-effect models were used to 
identify prognostic factors for each intervention.
RESULTS: Baseline neuropsychological composite z-score was positively associated 
with cognitive and functional improvements for both interventions in univariable 
models, retaining significance in the final multivariable model for functional 
outcome in CPT ( P < 0.001). Apolipoprotein E e4 carriers had worse cognitive ( 
P = 0.023) and functional ( P = 0.001) outcomes than noncarriers for CPT but not 
CCT. African Americans showed greater functional improvements than non-African 
Americans in both CPT ( P = 0.001) and CCT ( P = 0.010). Better baseline odor 
identification was correlated with cognitive improvements in CPT ( P = 0.006) 
and functional improvements in CCT ( P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Baseline cognitive test performance, African American background, 
and odor identification ability are potential prognostic factors for improved 
outcomes with cognitive interventions in older adults with MCI. Apolipoprotein E 
e4 is associated with poor outcomes. Replication of these findings may improve 
the selection of cognitive interventions for individuals with MCI.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a 
troublesome side effect in patients exposed to taxanes in the treatment of 
cancer and may affect quality of life dramatically. Here we assessed whether 
serum levels of neurofilament light (NfL) and tau (two neuroaxonal injury 
biomarkers) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, a biomarker for 
astrocytic activation) correlate with the development of CIPN in the adjuvant 
setting of early breast cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using ultrasensitive single molecule array technology, 
serum levels of NfL, GFAP, and tau were measured before and every 3 weeks in 10 
women receiving adjuvant EC (epirubicin 90 mg/m² and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m²) 
every 3 weeks × 3, followed by weekly paclitaxel 80 mg/m² × 9-12 weeks after 
surgery due to early breast cancer. CIPN was graded according to the NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v5.0) and the questionnaire EORTC 
QLQ CIPN-20.
RESULTS: Serum levels of GFAP increased successively during cycles of EC. NfL 
increased instead in response to the treatment of paclitaxel. NfL and GFAP 
continued to rise throughout exposure of cumulatively higher doses of paclitaxel 
and were reduced 3 months after the end of chemotherapy. Serums levels of tau 
were marginally affected by exposure to chemotherapy. Women with worse symptoms 
of CIPN had higher concentrations of NfL than women with mild symptoms of CIPN.
INTERPRETATION: NfL and GFAP are promising biomarkers to identify women at risk 
of developing CIPN. Larger prospective studies are now needed.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder that represents 
a major cause of dementia worldwide. Its pathogenesis involves multiple 
pathways, including the amyloid cascade, tau protein, oxidative stress, and 
metal ion dysregulation. Recent studies have suggested a critical link between 
changes in gut microbial diversity and the disruption of the gut-brain axis in 
AD. Previous studies primarily explored the potential benefits of probiotics and 
prebiotics in managing AD. However, studies have yet to fully describe a novel 
promising approach involving the use of synbiotics, which include a combination 
of active probiotics and new-generation prebiotics. Synbiotics show potential 
for mitigating the onset and progression of AD, thereby offering a holistic 
approach to address the multifaceted nature of AD. This review article primarily 
aims to gain further insights into the mechanisms of AD, specifically the 
intricate interaction between gut bacteria and the brain via the gut-brain axis. 
By understanding this relationship, we can identify potential targets for 
intervention and therapeutic strategies to combat AD effectively. This review 
also discusses substantial evidence supporting the role of synbiotics as a 
promising AD treatment that surpasses traditional probiotic or prebiotic 
interventions. We find that synbiotics may be used not only to address cognitive

overall quality of life of patients with AD.

INTRODUCTION: We investigated the link between habitual caffeine intake with 
memory impairments and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients.
METHODS: MCI (N = 147) and AD (N = 116) patients of the Biomarker of AmyLoid 
pepTide and AlZheimer's diseAse Risk (BALTAZAR) cohort reported their caffeine 
intake at inclusion using a dedicated survey. Associations of caffeine 
consumption with memory impairments and CSF biomarkers (tau, p-tau181, amyloid 
beta 1-42 [Aβ1-42], Aβ1-40) were analyzed using logistic and analysis of 
covariance models.
RESULTS: Adjusted on Apolipoprotein E (APOE ε4), age, sex, education level, and 
tobacco, lower caffeine consumption was associated with higher risk to be 
amnestic (OR: 2.49 [95% CI: 1.13 to 5.46]; p = 0.023) and lower CSF Aβ1-42 
(p = 0.047), Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 (p = 0.040), and Aβ1-42/p-tau181 (p = 0.020) in the 
whole cohort.
DISCUSSION: Data support the beneficial effect of caffeine consumption to memory 
impairments and CSF amyloid markers in MCI and AD patients.
HIGHLIGHTS: We studied the impact of caffeine consumption in the BALTAZAR 
cohort. Low caffeine intake is associated with higher risk of being amnestic in 
MCI/AD patients. Caffeine intake is associated with CSF biomarkers in AD 
patients.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses an immense challenge in healthcare, lacking 
effective therapies. This study investigates the potential of anthranilamide 
derivative (AAD23), a selective M2 receptor antagonist, in proactively 
preventing cognitive impairments and cholinergic neuronal degeneration in G 
protein-coupled receptor kinase-5-deficient Swedish APP (GAP) mice. GAP mice 
manifest cognitive deficits by 7 months and develop senile plaques by 9 months. 
A 6-month AAD23 treatment was initiated at 5 months and stopped at 11 months 
before behavioral assessments without the treatment. AAD23-treated mice 
exhibited preserved cognitive abilities and improved cholinergic axonal health 
in the nucleus basalis of Meynert akin to wildtype mice. Conversely, 
vehicle-treated GAP mice displayed memory deficits and pronounced cholinergic 
axonal swellings in the nucleus basalis of Meynert. Notably, AAD23 treatment did 
not alter senile plaques and microgliosis. These findings highlight AAD23's 
efficacy in forestalling AD-related cognitive decline in G protein-coupled 
receptor kinase-5-deficient subjects, attributing its success to restoring 
cholinergic neuronal integrity and resilience, enhancing resistance against 
diverse degenerative insults.

In Alzheimer's disease, chronic neuroinflammation is accompanied by amyloid and 
tau pathologies. Especially, aberrant microglial activation is known to precede 
the regional tau pathology development, but the mechanisms how microglia affect 
tau spread remain largely unknown. Here, we found that toll-like receptor 2 
(TLR2) in microglia recognizes oligomeric tau as a pathogenic ligand and induces 
inflammatory responses. Knockout of TLR2 reduced tau pathology and microglial 
activation in rTg4510 tau transgenic mice. Treatment of oligomeric tau induced 
TLR2 activation and increased inflammatory responses in microglial cells. TLR2 
further mediated the tau-induced microglial activation and promoted tau uptake 
into neurons in neuron-microglia co-culture system and in mouse hippocampus 
after intracranial tau injection. Importantly, treatment with anti-TLR2 
monoclonal antibody Tomaralimab blocked TLR2 activation and inflammatory 
responses in a dose-dependent manner, and significantly reduced tau spread and 
memory loss in rTg4510 mice. These results suggest that TLR2 plays a crucial 
role in tau spread by causing aberrant microglial activation in response to 
pathological tau, and blocking TLR2 with immunotherapy may ameliorate tau 
pathogenesis in Alzheimer's disease.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that 
seriously affects the quality of the elderly's lives worldwide. The main 
pathological features of AD are amyloid plaques formed by β-amyloid (Aβ) and 
neuronal fibrillary tangls (NFTs) formed by hyperphosphorylated Tau protein. The 
formation process of these pathological features is closely related to 
inflammatory response, so anti-inflammatory treatment has become a potential 
treatment for AD. In recent years, more and more research has shown that the 
anti-inflammatory therapy can relieve the symptoms of AD and improve cognitive 
function, which provides a valuable research direction for the treatment of AD 
strategy. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the hotspots and 
development trends of AD anti-inflammatory research is important for promoting 
the further development of this field and improving the quality of life of 
patients.
METHODS: This study used bibliometric methods, with AD and anti-inflammatory as 
key words, collected 7638 AD anti-inflammatory studies collected in Web of 
Science Core Collection (WoSCC) literature database since 2000, and conducted an 
in-depth analysis of the research hotspots and potential trends in this field.
RESULTS: The depth and breadth of AD anti-inflammatory research are in the stage 
of rapid development, and the hot focus is on exploring the role of inflammation 
in the pathogenesis of AD, especially the interaction of microglia in the 
neuroinflammatory mechanism. Secondly, the treatment effect and potential risks 
of anti-inflammatory drugs such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs) on AD are also the focus of research. Therefore, researchers have 
carried out a series of animal experiments and prospective clinical studies on 
anti-inflammatory drugs for the treatment of AD, forming a comprehensive 
research system from basic research to clinical research. As for the future 
development trend, we believe that the further exploration of inflammation in 
the pathogenesis of AD will still be one of the key directions, and the 
application of big data and artificial intelligence technology is expected to 
provide strong support for the association between inflammation and AD 
progression. Moreover, the development of novel anti-inflammatory drugs for the 
inflammatory mechanism of AD will be another major trend for future research. At 
the same time, personalized treatment strategies and alternative supplements of 
medicine will also become one of the hotspots of future research. Through the 
comprehensive use of anti-inflammatory drugs, nutritional supplements, lifestyle 
intervention and other means, more comprehensive and effective treatment plans 
for AD patients are expected.
CONCLUSION: This research analyzes the overall development trend of AD 
anti-inflammatory research field since 2000, and provides a comprehensive 
perspective for the progress of AD anti-inflammatory research. Overall, the 
field of AD anti-inflammatory research is facing a broad development prospect. 
In the future, with further research and technological advances, we have resason 
to expect more effective and safer treatment options for AD patients to help 
them improve their quality of life and delay disease progression.

OBJECTIVES: Older spouses are a significant part of family caregivers of 
patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and need support. Evidence suggests that 
different factors influence the support of older spousal caregivers. However, 
there is little evidence about these factors in developing countries like Iran. 
This study aimed to identify the factors affecting the support of Iranian older 
spousal caregivers of people with AD.
METHOD: This qualitative study used Graneheim and Lundman's conventional content 
analysis approach. Through purposive sampling, 10 caregivers, three family 
members, and three professionals were recruited from various cognitive clinics 
and centers. In-depth and semi-structured interviews were used to collect data 
and continued until conceptual saturation was achieved.
RESULTS: Two themes were derived from the data as factors affecting support, 
which included (1) caregiver's support-seeking (complexity of the patient's 
condition, caregiver's geriatric health, the burden of caring for a spouse with 
AD, marital bond quality, caregiver's support-phobic beliefs, caregiver's 
awareness of care) and (2) capacities of support resources (supportive family, 
supportiveness of society, formal systems' capability to provide support 
services).
CONCLUSION: The present study provided practical information about the factors 
influencing the support of older spousal caregivers. Healthcare providers and 
policymakers can use these concepts to improve the support process by 
strengthening caregivers' support-seeking motivation and enhancing capacities in 
support resources.

and Brain Health), Wenzhou, China.

BACKGROUND: This work elucidated the effect of honokiol (HKL) on hippocampal 
neuronal mitochondrial function in Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: APP/PS1 mice were used as AD mice models and exposed to HKL and 3-TYP. 
Morris water maze experiment was performed to appraise cognitive performance of 
mice. Hippocampal Aβ+ plaque deposition and neuronal survival was evaluated by 
immunohistochemistry and Nissl staining. Hippocampal neurons were dissociated 
from C57BL/6 mouse embryos. Hippocampal neuronal AD model was constructed by Aβ 
oligomers induction and treated with HKL, CsA and 3-TYP. Neuronal viability and 
apoptosis were detected by cell counting kit-8 assay and TUNEL staining. 
mRFP-eGFP-LC3 assay, MitoSOX Red, dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, and JC-1 
staining were performed to monitor neuronal autophagosomes, mitochondrial 
reactive oxygen species (ROS), neuronal ROS, and mitochondrial membrane 
potential. Autophagy-related proteins were detected by Western blot.
RESULTS: In AD mice, HKL improved cognitive function, relieved hippocampal 
Aβ1-42 plaque deposition, promoted hippocampal neuron survival, and activated 
hippocampal SIRT3 expression and mitochondrial autophagy. These effects of HKL 
on AD mice were abolished by 3-TYP treatment. In hippocampal neuronal AD model, 
HKL increased neuronal activity, attenuated neuronal apoptosis and Aβ 
aggregation, activated SIRT3 and mitochondrial autophagy, reduced mitochondrial 
and neuronal ROS, and elevated mitochondrial membrane potential. CsA treatment 
and 3-TYP treatment abrogated the protection of HKL on hippocampal neuronal AD 
model. The promotion of mitochondrial autophagy by HKL in hippocampal neuronal 
AD model was counteracted by 3-TYP.
CONCLUSIONS: HKL activates SIRT3-mediated mitochondrial autophagy to mitigate 
hippocampal neuronal damage in AD. HKL may be effective in treating AD.

Synaptic plasticity is believed to underlie the cellular and molecular basis of 
memory formation. Mitochondria are one of the main organelles involved in 
metabolism and energy maintenance as plastic organelles that change 
morphologically and functionally in response to cellular needs and regulate 
synaptic function and plasticity through multiple mechanisms, including ATP 
generation, calcium homeostasis, and biogenesis. An increased neuronal activity 
enhances synaptic efficiency, during which mitochondria's spatial distribution 
and morphology change significantly. These organelles build up in the pre-and 
postsynaptic zones to produce ATP, which is necessary for several synaptic 
processes like neurotransmitter release and recycling. Mitochondria also 
regulate calcium homeostasis by buffering intracellular calcium, which ensures 
proper synaptic activity. Furthermore, mitochondria in the presynaptic terminal 
have distinct morphological properties compared to dendritic or postsynaptic 
mitochondria. This specialization enables precise control of synaptic activity 
and plasticity. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been linked to synaptic failure in 
many neurodegenerative disorders, like Alzheimer's disease (AD). In AD, 
malfunctioning mitochondria cause delays in synaptic vesicle release and 
recycling, ionic gradient imbalances, and mostly synaptic failure. This review 
emphasizes mitochondrial plasticity's contribution to synaptic function. It also 
explores the profound effect of mitochondrial malfunction on neurodegenerative 
disorders, focusing on AD, and provides an overview of how they sustain cellular 
health under normal conditions and how their malfunction contributes to 
neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting their potential as a therapeutic target 
for such conditions.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative dementia illness that causes atrophy 
of the temporal and frontal lobes of the cerebral cortex. Linggui Zhugan (LGZG), 
a classic Chinese herbal formula, was initially recognized as a safe and 
effective treatment of cardiovascular diseases for long history. This study 
intended to assess the effects and the molecular mechanism of LGZG on AD 
progress. C57BL/6 mice were divided into six groups: normal mice, amyloid 
precursor protein/presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) mice (model group), positive control 
group (model mice treated with donepezil), high, medium and low LGZG group 
(model mice treated with 7g/kg/d, 3.5g/kg/d or 1.75g/kg/d LGZG respectively). 
Water maze results showed that the escape latency and path length of high and 
medium LGZG groups declined compared to the model mice, the decline degree was 
dose-dependent. The hippocampal slices of six groups were analyzed by 
Nissl-staining, Perls' iron staining and immunofluorescence assay. The results 
indicated LGZG could restore morphological anomalies and alleviate iron 
deposition of AD mice, and the GXP4 positive cells increased significantly. The 
MDA, Fe2+ and GSH were measured by biochemical testing, whose results 
illustrated that LGZG could normalize MDA, Fe2+ and GSH levels in AD model 
compared to un-treated APP/PS1 model. The higher dose of LGZG the mice received, 
the more intensive effects on those levels of molecules. Western blot results 
showed that LGZG could affect NeuN, AMPK, p53, SLC7A11 and GPX4 levels in the 
hippocampus of AD model, which was all proteins related to AMPK pathway. In 
conclusion, LGZG has a neuroprotective effect on AD through AMPK pathway by 
alleviating oxidative stress and ferroptosis.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) presents a growing global challenge, with an increasing 
prevalence and significant impact on individuals and public health. Effective 
pharmacological treatments directly impacting the disease are still lacking, 
highlighting the importance of programs and interventions aimed at improving the 
wellbeing of those affected. The present feasibility study aimed to evaluate the 
effectiveness and feasibility of the Alzheimer's patients Interaction through 
Digital and Arts (AIDA) program. AIDA's main objective is to enhance perceived 
wellbeing and quality of life of people with AD and their caregivers through a 
series of structured activities through museum- and art-based activities over 
five sessions. Pre- and post-program evaluations were conducted using Visual 
Analog Scales (VASs) to measure various dimensions of perceived wellbeing such 
as confidence, happiness, interest, optimism, and wellness. Results showed 
significant improvements in all considered dimensions for people with AD 
following AIDA activities, highlighting its potential to enhance overall 
wellbeing. Caregivers also reported increased perceived wellness post-program, 
demonstrating some positive effects also in healthy participants. The 
feasibility of AIDA was supported by positive feedback and engagement of 
participants. Overall, the AIDA program offers a non-intrusive and engaging 
approach to improve the perceived wellbeing of people with AD and caregivers 
while facilitating meaningful experiences (e.g., silence, sharing etc.) in 
cultural settings.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its subset diabetic kidney disease are 
progressive conditions that affect >850 million people worldwide. Diabetes, 
hypertension, and glomerulonephritis are the most common causes of CKD, which is 
associated with significant patient morbidity and an increased risk of 
cardiovascular events, such as heart failure, ultimately leading to premature 
death. Despite newly approved drugs, increasing evidence shows that patients 
respond to treatment differently given the complexity of disease heterogeneity 
and complicated pathophysiology. This review article presents an integrative 
approach to understanding and addressing CKD through the lens of precision 
medicine and therapeutics. Advancements in single-cell omics technologies and 
artificial intelligence can be leveraged to explore the intricate cellular 
mechanisms underlying CKD and diabetic kidney disease pathogenesis. Dissecting 
the cellular heterogeneity and identifying rare cell populations using 
single-cell approaches will facilitate uncovering novel therapeutic targets and 
biomarkers for personalized treatment strategies. Finally, we discuss the 
potential of artificial intelligence-driven analyses in predicting disease 
progression and treatment response, thereby paving the way for tailored 
interventions.

Glutamate activates the NMDARs, significantly affecting multiple processes such 
as learning, memory, synaptic integration, and excitatory transmission in the 
central nervous system. Uncontrolled activation of NMDARs is a significant 
contributor to synaptic dysfunction. Having a properly functioning NMDAR and 
synapse is crucial for maintaining neuronal communication. In addition, the 
dysfunction of NMDAR and synapse function could contribute to the development of 
neurological disorders at the neuronal level; hence, targeting NMDARs with 
antagonists in the fight against neurological disorders is a promising route. 
Recently published results from the animal study on different kinds of brain 
diseases like stroke, epilepsy, tinnitus, ataxia, Alzheimer's disease, 
Parkinson's disease, and spinal cord injury have demonstrated promising 
therapeutic scopes. Several NMDA receptor antagonists, such as memantine, MK801, 
ketamine, ifenprodil, gacyclidine, amantadine, agmatine, etc., showed 
encouraging results against different brain disease mouse models. Given the 
unique expression of different subunits of the well-organized NMDA receptor 
system by neurons. It could potentially lead to the development of medications 
specifically targeting certain receptor subtypes. For a future researcher, 
conducting more targeted research and trials is crucial to fully understand and 
develop highly specific medications with good clinical effects and potential 
neuroprotective properties.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease. Early diagnosis 
are very important to timely treatment and delay the progression of the disease. 
In the past decade, many computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) algorithms have been 
proposed for classification of AD. In this paper, we propose a novel graph 
neural network method, termed Brain Graph Attention Network (BGAN) for 
classification of AD. First, brain graph data are used to model classification 
of AD as a graph classification task. Second, a local attention layer is 
designed to capture and aggregate messages of interactions between node 
neighbors. And, a global attention layer is introduced to obtain the 
contribution of each node for graph representation. Finally, using the BGAN to 
implement AD classification. We train and test on two open public databases for 
AD classification task. Compared to classic models, the experimental results 
show that our model is superior to six classic models. We demonstrate that BGAN 
is a powerful classification model for AD. In addition, our model can provide an 
analysis of brain regions in order to judge which regions are related to AD 
disease and which regions are related to AD progression.

Rapid advances in biological knowledge and technological innovation have greatly 
advanced the fields of stem cell and gene therapies to combat a broad spectrum 
of neurologic disorders. Researchers are currently exploring a variety of stem 
cell types (e.g., embryonic, progenitor, induced pluripotent) and various 
transplantation strategies, each with its own advantages and drawbacks. 
Similarly, various gene modification techniques (zinc finger, TALENs, 
CRISPR-Cas9) are employed with various delivery vectors to modify underlying 
genetic contributors to neurologic disorders. While these two individual fields 
continue to blaze new trails, it is the combination of these technologies which 
enables genetically engineered stem cells and vastly increases investigational 
and therapeutic opportunities. The capability to culture and expand stem cells 
outside the body, along with their potential to correct genetic abnormalities in 
patient-derived cells or enhance cells with extra gene products, unleashes the

The misfolding and aggregation of beta-amyloid (Aβ) peptides have been 
implicated as key pathogenic events in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). Inhibiting Aβ aggregation represents a potential disease-modifying 
therapeutic approach to AD treatment. Previous studies have identified various 
molecules that inhibit Aβ aggregation, some of which share common chemical 
substructures (fragments) that may be key to their inhibitory activity. 
Employing fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD) methods may facilitate the 
identification of these fragments, which can subsequently be used to screen new 
inhibitors and provide leads for further drug development. In this study, we 
used an in silico FBDD approach to identify 17 fragment clusters that are 
significantly enriched among Aβ aggregation inhibitors. These fragments were 
then used to screen anti-infective agents, a promising drug class for 
repurposing against amyloid aggregation. This screening process identified 16 
anti-infective drugs, 5 of which were chosen for further investigation. Among 
the 5 candidates, anidulafungin, an antifungal compound, showed high efficacy in 
inhibiting Aβ aggregation in vitro. Kinetic analysis revealed that anidulafungin 
selectively blocks the primary nucleation step of Aβ aggregation, substantially 
delaying Aβ fibril formation. Cell viability assays demonstrated that 
anidulafungin can reduce the toxicity of oligomeric Aβ on BV2 microglia cells. 
Molecular docking simulations predicted that anidulafungin interacted with 
various Aβ species, including monomers, oligomers, and fibrils, potentially 
explaining its activity against Aβ aggregation and toxicity. This study suggests 
that anidulafungin is a potential drug to be repurposed for AD, and FBDD is a 
promising approach for discovering drugs to combat Aβ aggregation.

INTRODUCTION: We developed a multimarker blood test result interpretation tool 
for the clinical dementia practice, including phosphorylated (P-)tau181, 
amyloid-beta (Abeta)42/40, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and 
neurofilament light (NfL).
METHODS: We measured the plasma biomarkers with Simoa (n = 1199), applied LASSO 
regression for biomarker selection and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) 
analyses to determine diagnostic accuracy. We validated our findings in two 
independent cohorts and constructed a visualization approach.
RESULTS: P-tau181, GFAP, and NfL were selected. This combination had area under 
the curve (AUC) = 83% to identify amyloid positivity in pre-dementia stages, 
AUC = 87%-89% to differentiate Alzheimer's or controls from frontotemporal 
dementia, AUC = 74%-76% to differentiate Alzheimer's or controls from dementia 
with Lewy bodies. Highly reproducible AUCs were obtained in independent cohorts. 
The resulting visualization tool includes UpSet plots to visualize the 
stand-alone biomarker results and density plots to visualize the biomarker 
results combined.
DISCUSSION: Our multimarker blood test interpretation tool is ready for testing 
in real-world clinical dementia settings.
HIGHLIGHTS: We developed a multimarker blood test interpretation tool for 
clinical dementia practice. Our interpretation tool includes plasma biomarkers 
P-tau, GFAP, and NfL. Our tool is particularly useful for Alzheimer's and 
frontotemporal dementia diagnosis.

Cellular senescence is a crucial process of irreversible cell-cycle arrest, in 
which cells remain alive, but permanently unable to proliferate in response to 
distinct types of stressors. Accumulating evidence suggests that DNA damage 
builds over time and triggers DNA damage response signaling, leading to cellular 
senescence. Cellular senescence serves as a platform for the perpetuation of 
inflammatory responses and is central to numerous age-related diseases. Defects 
in DNA repair genes or senescence can cause premature aging disease. Therapeutic 
approaches limiting DNA damage or senescence contribute to a rescued phenotype 
of longevity and neuroprotection, thus suggesting a mechanistic interaction 
between DNA damage and senescence. Here, we offer a unique perspective on the 
crosstalk between the DNA damage response pathway and senescence as well as 
their contribution to age-related diseases. We further summarize recent progress 
on the mechanisms and therapeutics of senescence, address existing challenges, 
and offering new insights and future directions in the senescence field.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Notopterygium incisum Ting ex H. T. Chang, also 
called 'Qianghuo', is a distinct umbelliferae plant in China. The rhizomes and 
roots of Notopterygium incisum have long been used to treat headaches, colds, 
analgesia and rheumatoid arthritis. It is a main traditional Chinese medicine in 
Qianghuo Yufeng Decoction, which was used to treat diseases such as liver and 
kidney insufficiency, mental paralysis and dementia.
AIM OF THIS STUDY: As the most common dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD) has a 
complicated pathogenesis. So far, there is no effective drug to prevent its 
pathological process. Previous research has shown that Notopterygium incisum 
root extract (NRE) may inhibit the release of Aβ and the activation of tau in 
mice with AD. However, the effect of NRE on the pathological process of 
neuroinflammation is still unclear.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We determined the pro-inflammatory cytokines levels in 
BV2 cells exposed to LPS/Aβ42 after treated with NRE. APP/PS1 and LPS-induced 
C57BL/6 neuroinflammatory mice were given NRE for 8 weeks and 5 days 
respectively to detect the pathological changes of neuroinflammation.
RESULTS: The findings showed that NRE had a notable inhibitory effect on the 
levels of TNF-α and IL-1β in BV2 cells induced by LPS/Aβ42. The results of in 
vivo experiments show that following NRE treatment, there was a notable decrease 
in the number of activated microglia in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice as 
indicated by immunofluorescence results. Sholl analysis showed that microglia 
branches increased in NRE group, indicating that M1 microglia activation was 
inhibited. In the mice model injected with LPS in the tail vein, PCR and Western 
Blot results confirmed the anti-inflammatory effect of NRE, Nissl staining 
showed the protective effect of NRE on neurons, and immunofluorescence results 
also indicated that the activation of M1 microglia was inhibited.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that long term oral administration of NRE may 
inhibit neuroinflammation in the progression of AD.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Alzheimer's disease is the most common 
neurodegenerative disease with therapeutic limitations. Insulin resistance plays 
a role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Therapies that modulate 
insulin secretion and signaling, as well as oxidative stress in the brain are 
now being investigated for their potential role in the prevention of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). Terminalia macroptera (Combretaceae) is a plant that different 
parts have been used traditionally for the treatment of metabolic and 
neurological conditions. Previous study has indicated that the crude extract 
exhibit anti-diabetic property. In addition, the plant is a rich source of 
tannins, phenolic acids, flavonoids, triterpenes. However, there is no study on 
its protective effect against biochemical alterations of AD in diabetic rats.
AIM OF THE STUDY: The present research study investigated the neuroprotective 
effects of TeMac™ on Alzheimer-like pathology induced by aluminum chloride 
(AlCl3) in diabetic rats.
METHODS: A phytochemical analysis of TeMac™ was carried out to quantify tannins. 
The potential effect of the tannins-enriched fraction (TEF) of TeMac™ to prevent 
the formation of senile plaques was conducted by its ability to inhibit the 
activities of β-secretase (EC 3.4.23.46), monoamine oxidase A (EC 1.4.3.4) and 
the fibrillation of Aβ. A diabetic model was induced from female Wistar rats by 
a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 35 mg/kg BW). After 
that, the blood glucose level was measured to confirm the induction of diabetes. 
Three days after induction, animals received AlCl3 (75 mg/kg BW) alone (AD 
control) or concomitantly with 400 mg/kg BW of TEF of TeMac™ or 5 mg/kg BW 
Daonil by daily gavage for 42 days. At the end of the experiment, rats were 
sacrificed, blood and brains were collected. The levels of amyloid fibrils, 
glucose, albumin and the activities of DPP4, β-secretase and phosphatase, and 
markers of oxidative stress in the brain were assessed.
RESULTS: TEF of TeMac™ displays a potential ability to inhibit the activities of 
β-secretase, monoamine oxidase, and Aβ fibrillation. Treatment with TEF of 
TeMac™ significantly inhibited DPP4 and BACE1 activities and reduced brain 
glucose and amyloid fibril levels, and improved cerebral albumin levels and 
modulated oxidative stress markers.
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that TEF of TeMac™ prevents Alzheimer's-type 
pathology linked to insulin resistance in rats. TEF of TeMac™ may be a potential 
drug candidate for the treatment of diabetes-associated cognitive impairment.

OBJECTIVES: Reimbursement decisions for new Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatments 
are informed by economic evaluations. An open-source model with intuitive 
structure for model cross-validation can support the transparency and 
credibility of such evaluations. We describe the new International 
Pharmaco-Economic Collaboration on Alzheimer's Disease (IPECAD) open-source 
model framework (version 2) for the health-economic evaluation of early AD 
treatment and use it for cross-validation and addressing uncertainty.
METHODS: A cohort state-transition model using a categorized composite domain 
(cognition and function) was developed by replicating an existing reference 
model and testing it for internal validity. Then, features of existing Institute 
for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) and Alzheimer's Disease Archimedes 
Condition-Event Simulator (AD-ACE) models assessing lecanemab treatment were 
implemented for model cross-validation. Additional uncertainty scenarios were 
performed on choice of efficacy outcome from trial, natural disease progression, 
treatment effect waning and stopping rules, and other methodological choices. 
The model is available open-source as R code, spreadsheet, and web-based version 
via https://github.com/ronhandels/IPECAD.
RESULTS: In the IPECAD model incremental life-years, quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALY) gains and cost savings were 21% to 31% smaller compared with the ICER 
model and 36% to 56% smaller compared with the AD-ACE model. IPECAD model 
results were particularly sensitive to assumptions on treatment effect waning 
and stopping rules and choice of efficacy outcome from trial.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the ability of a new IPECAD open-source model 
framework for researchers and decision makers to cross-validate other (Health 
Technology Assessment submission) models and perform additional uncertainty 
analyses, setting an example for open science in AD decision modeling and 
supporting important reimbursement decisions.

Ovaries are essential for healthy female reproduction, with the follicles as 
their fundamental functional units, which consist of an oocyte and surrounding 
granulosa cells. The development and formation of follicles in the ovaries are 
closely linked to reproductive health. Oxylipins refer to oxidative metabolites 
produced from the oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids, either through 
automatic oxidation or with the help of specific enzymes. They play crucial 
regulatory roles in the immune system, oxidative stress, and inflammatory 
reactions and are intimately linked to the development of numerous illnesses, 
such as diabetes, heart disease, asthma, and Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, 
oxylipins have a complex relationship with ovarian function, and both 
prostaglandins and leukotrienes produced by arachidonic acid affect processes 
such as follicle growth and development, ovulation, and hormone regulation. The 
synthesis and metabolism of oxylipins in the ovaries are finely regulated. 
Oxylipin dysregulation has been linked to various ovarian diseases, including 
endometriosis, polycystic ovary syndrome, ovarian cancer, and premature ovarian 
insufficiency. In addition, potential therapeutic targets and interventions 
targeting the oxylipin pathway for the treatment of ovarian diseases have become 
a prominent research focus, including regulating the enzymes responsible for 
oxylipin synthesis, using anti-inflammatory agents, and regulating lipid 
metabolism. Recent research has been directed towards improving the reproductive 
outcomes of women with ovarian diseases through this series of interventions. An 
overview of the role of oxylipins in ovarian function and disease is provided in 
this article, which will aid researchers in understanding the current state of 
the field and in identifying future directions.

Microglia are resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS) with 
roles in sensing, housekeeping, and defense. Exploring the role of microglia in 
the occurrence and development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the possible 
therapeutic mechanism of plant-derived natural compounds (PDNCs) that regulate 
microglia-associated neuroinflammation may potentially help in elucidating the 
pathogenesis of AD and provide novel insights for its treatment. This review 
explores the role of abnormal microglial activation and its dominant 
neuroinflammatory response, as well as the activation of their target receptors 
and signaling pathways in AD pathogenesis. Additionally, we report an update on 
the potential pharmacological mechanisms of multiple PDNCs in modulating 
microglia-associated neuroinflammation in AD treatment. Dysregulated activation 
of microglial receptors and their downstream pathways impaired immune 
homeostasis in animal models of AD. Multiple signaling pathways, such as 
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), nuclear factor kappa light chain 
enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), and Toll-like receptors, play important 
roles in microglial activation and can exacerbate microglia-mediated 
neuroinflammation. PDNCs, such as magnolol, stigmasterol, matrine, naringenin, 
naringin, and resveratrol, can delay the progression of AD by inhibiting the 
proinflammatory receptors of microglia, activating its anti-inflammatory 
receptors, regulating the receptors related to β-amyloid (Aβ) clearance, 
reversing immune dysregulation, and maintaining the immune homeostasis of 
microglial downstream pathways. This review summarizes the mechanisms by which 
microglia cause chronic inflammation in AD and evaluates the beneficial effects 
of PDNCs on immune regulation in AD by regulating microglial receptors and their 
downstream pathways.

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused unprecedented worldwide infections from 
persistent mutant variants with various degrees of infectivity and virulence. 
The elusiveness of a highly penetrant, worldwide vaccination strategy suggests 
that the complete eradication of SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely. Even with the advent of 
new antiviral agents, the disease burden worldwide continues to exceed current 
preventative and therapeutic strategies. Greater interest has been placed 
towards the development of affordable,broadly effective antiviral therapeutics. 
Here, we report that the small branched-chain fatty acid Valproic acid (VPA), 
approved for maintenance of seizure and bipolar disorder, has a novel anti- 
coronavirus activity that can be augmented with the addition of a long-chain, 
polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acid, Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). An EMR-based 
epidemiological study of patients tested for COVID-19 demonstrated a correlation 
exists between a reduced infection rate in patients treated withVPA of up to 
25%, as well as a decreased risk of emergency room visits, hospitalization, ICU 
admission,and use of mechanical ventilation. In vitro studies have demonstrated 
that VPA modifies gene expression in MRC5 cells. Interestingly, VPA correlates 
with the inhibition of several SARS-CoV2 interacting genes and the greater 
inhibition of alpha-coronavirus HCoV-229E (a "common cold" virus) and SARS-CoV2. 
The VPA-DHA combination activates pre-existing intracellular antiviral 
mechanisms normally repressed by coronaviruses. Gene expression profiles 
demonstrate subtle differences in overall gene expression between VPA-treated 
and VPA-DHA-treated cells. HCoV-229E infection caused an intensely different 
response with a marked induction of multiple intracellular inflammatory genes. 
Changes in gene expression took at least 24 hours to manifest and most likely 
why prior drug screens failed to identify any antiviral VPA activity despite in 
silico predictions. This report demonstrates an interaction between HDAC 
inhibition and the potent activation of cellular antiviral responses. A 
foundation now exists for a low-cost, highly effective antiviral strategy when 
supplemented with DHA.

Fortea et al.'s. (2024) recent data analysis elegantly calls attention to 
familial late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) with APOE4 homozygosity. The 
article by Grant (2024) reviews the factors associated with AD, particularly the 
APOE genotype and lifestyle, and the broad implications for prevention, both for 
individuals with the lifestyles associated with living in resource-rich 
countries and for those enduring environmental adversity in poverty settings, 
including high exposure to enteric pathogens and precarious access to 
healthcare. Grant discusses the issue of APOE genotype and its implications for 
the benefits of lifestyle modifications. This review highlights that bearing 
APOE4 could constitute an evolutionary benefit in coping with heavy enteric 
infections and malnutrition early in life in the critical formative first two 
years of brain development. However, the critical issue may be that this 
genotype could be a health concern under shifts in lifestyle and unhealthy diets 
during aging, leading to severe cognitive impairments and increased risk of AD. 
This commentary supports the discussions of Grant and the benefits of improving 
lifestyle for decreasing the risks for AD while providing further understanding 
and modelling of the early life benefits of APOE4 amidst adversity. This 
attention to the pathophysiology of AD should help further elucidate these 
critical, newly appreciated pathogenic pathways for developing approaches to the 
prevention and management in the context of the APOE genetic variations 
associated with AD.

BACKGROUND: Blood biomarkers are crucial for the diagnosis and therapy of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Energy metabolism disturbances are closely related to 
AD. However, research on blood biomarkers related to energy metabolism is still 
insufficient.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the diagnostic and therapeutic 
significance of energy metabolism-related genes in AD.
METHODS: AD cohorts were obtained from GEO database and single center. Machine 
learning algorithms were used to identify key genes. GSEA was used for 
functional analysis. Six algorithms were utilized to establish and evaluate 
diagnostic models. Key gene-related drugs were screened through network 
pharmacology.
RESULTS: We identified 4 energy metabolism genes, NDUFA1, MECOM, RPL26, and 
RPS27. These genes have been confirmed to be closely related to multiple energy 
metabolic pathways and different types of T cell immune infiltration. 
Additionally, the transcription factors INSM2 and 4 lncRNAs were involved in 
regulating 4 genes. Further analysis showed that all biomarkers were 
downregulated in the AD cohorts and not affected by aging and gender. More 
importantly, we constructed a diagnostic prediction model of 4 biomarkers, which 
has been validated by various algorithms for its diagnostic performance. 
Furthermore, we found that valproic acid mainly interacted with these biomarkers 
through hydrogen bonding, salt bonding, and hydrophobic interaction.
CONCLUSIONS: We constructed a predictive model based on 4 energy metabolism 
genes, which may be helpful for the diagnosis of AD. The 4 validated genes could 
serve as promising blood biomarkers for AD. Their interaction with valproic acid 
may play a crucial role in the therapy of AD.

BACKGROUND: Aggression, a common symptom of Alzheimer's disease (AD), can impose 
a significant burden on caregivers, necessitating early institutionalization.
OBJECTIVE: The current study examined the neural basis of aggression and its 
expression mechanism, to advance the development of effective treatment 
strategies for aggression in patients with AD.
METHODS: The study sample included 257 patients; 180 were diagnosed with AD and 
77 with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). Factor analysis of the 
neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI) aggression scores was performed, and the 
correlation between each factor and cerebral blood flow (CBF) was examined via 
diagnosis of AD or aMCI using statistical parametric mapping.
RESULTS: Refusal of care was correlated with reduced CBF in the right 
hippocampus of patients with AD while no specific related regions could be 
identified in patients with aMCI. Violent behavior was associated with decreased 
CBF in the right temporal pole and medial frontal lobe of patients with AD and 
aMCI.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that aggression, measured using NPI includes 
two distinct symptoms, refusal of care and violent behavior, having different 
underlying neural bases.

Interpersonal synchrony in dance/movement therapy: Neural underpinnings for 
individuals with dementia.

PA, USA.

Rising global levels of dementia including Alzheimer's disease call for the 
treatment of both cognitive and psychosocial deficits of this population. While 
there is no cure for dementia, the progression can be slowed, and symptoms 
eased. The positive effects of exercise and dance have been documented as has 
interpersonal synchrony. Dance/movement therapy uses kinesthetic empathy, 
attunement, and mirroring to communicate, synchronize, and connect with clients, 
salient for a population that often struggles with loneliness and isolation. 
Here I offer a perspective on how dance/movement therapy promotes the social 
functions and neural underpinning of interpersonal synchrony, possibly providing 
neuroprotection for this population.

BACKGROUND: Recent advances linking gut dysbiosis with neurocognitive disorders 
such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) suggest that the microbiota-gut-brain axis 
could be targeted for AD prevention, management, or treatment.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify probiotics that can delay Aβ-induced paralysis.
METHODS: Using C. elegans expressing human amyloid-β (Aβ)1-42 in body wall 
muscles (GMC101), we assessed the effects of several probiotic strains on 
paralysis.
RESULTS: We found that Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus HA-114 and Bacillus subtilis 
R0179, but not their supernatants or heat-treated forms, delayed paralysis and 
prolonged lifespan without affecting the levels of amyloid-β aggregates. To 
uncover the mechanism involved, we explored the role of two known pathways 
involved in neurogenerative diseases, namely mitophagy, via deletion of the 
mitophagy factor PINK-1, and fatty acid desaturation, via deletion of the Δ9 
desaturase FAT-5. Pink-1 deletion in GMC101 worms did not modify the 
life-prolonging and anti-paralysis effects of HA-114 but reduced the protective 
effect of R0179 against paralysis without affecting its life-prolonging effect. 
Upon fat5 deletion in GMC101 worms, the monounsaturated C14:1 and C16:1 FAs 
conserved their beneficial effect while the saturated C14:0 and C16:0 FAs did 
not. The beneficial effects of R0179 on both lifespan and paralysis remained 
unaffected by fat-5 deletion, while the beneficial effect of HA-114 on paralysis 
and lifespan was significantly reduced.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively with clinical and preclinical evidence in other 
models, our results suggest that HA-114 or R0179 could be studied as potential 
therapeutical adjuncts in neurodegenerative diseases such as AD.

With the recent clinical success of anti-amyloid-β (Aβ) monoclonal antibodies, 
there is a renewed interest in agents which target the Aβ peptide of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). Metal complexes are particularly well-suited for this development, 
given their structural versatility and ability to form stabile interactions with 
soluble Aβ. In this report, a small series of ruthenium-arene complexes were 
evaluated for their respective ability to modulate both the aggregation and 
cytotoxicity of Aβ. First, the stability of the complexes was evaluated in a 
variety of aqueous media where the complexes demonstrated exceptional stability. 
Next, the ability to coordinate and modulate the Aβ peptide was evaluated using 
several spectroscopic methods, including thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence, 
dynamic light scattering (DLS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). 
Overall, the complex RuBO consistently gave the greatest inhibitory action 
towards Aβ aggregation, which correlated with its ability to coordinate to Aβ in 
solution. Furthermore, RuBO also had the lowest affinity for serum albumin, 
which is a key consideration for a neurotherapeutic, as this protein does not 
cross the blood brain barrier. Lastly, RuBO also displayed promising 
neuroprotective properties, as it had the greatest inhibition of Aβ-inducted 
cytotoxicity.

BACKGROUND: Cadmium chloride (Cd) is a pervasive environmental heavy metal 
pollutant linked to mitochondrial dysfunction, memory loss, and genetic 
disorders, particularly in the context of neurodegenerative diseases like 
Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: This study investigated the neurotherapeutic potential of vitamin B6 
(Vit. B6) in mitigating Cd-induced oxidative stress and 
neuroinflammation-mediated synaptic and memory dysfunction. Adult albino mice 
were divided into four groups: Control (saline-treated), Cd-treated, Cd+Vit. B6- 
treated, and Vit. B6 alone-treated. Cd and Vit. B6 were administered 
intraperitoneally, and behavioral tests (Morris Water Maze, Y-Maze) were 
conducted. Subsequently, western blotting, antioxidant assays, blood glucose, 
and hyperlipidemia assessments were performed.
RESULTS: Cd-treated mice exhibited impaired cognitive function, while Cd+Vit. 
B6-treated mice showed significant improvement. Cd-induced neurotoxic effects, 
including oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, were observed, along with 
disruptions in synaptic proteins (SYP and PSD95) and activation of p-JNK. Vit. 
B6 administration mitigated these effects, restoring synaptic and memory 
deficits. Molecular docking and MD simulation studies confirmed Vit. B6's 
inhibitory effect on IL-1β, NRF2, and p-JNK proteins.
CONCLUSION: These results highlight Vit. B6 as a safe therapeutic supplement to 
mitigate neurodegenerative disorders, emphasizing the importance of assessing 
nutritional interventions for combating environmental neurotoxicity in the 
interest of public health.

Oxidative degradation of the pathogenic amyloid-β-peptide (Aβ) aggregation is an 
effective and promising method to treat Alzheimer's disease under light 
irradiation. However, the limited penetration of external light sources into 
deep tissues has hindered the development of this treatment. Therefore, we have 
designed an unprecedented chemiluminescence-initiated photodynamic therapy 
system to replace external laser irradiation, primarily composed of 
d-glucose-based polyoxalate (G-poly(oxalate)), the novel photosensitizer 
(BD-Se-QM), and bis [2,4,5-trichloro-6-(pentoxy-carbonyl) phenyl] ester. 
BD-Se-QM possesses excellent singlet oxygen (1O2) generation efficiency and the 
ability to photooxidize Aβ1-42 aggregates under white light. G-poly(oxalate) not 
only helps the nanosystem to cross the blood-brain barrier but also has 
sufficient oxalate ester groups to significantly enhance the efficiency of 
chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer. The oxalate ester groups in 
BD-Se-QM/NPs can chemically react with H2O2 to produce high-energy intermediates 
that activate BD-Se-QM, which can generate 1O2 to inhibit Aβ1-42 aggregates and 
also promote microglial uptake of Aβ1-42, reducing the Aβ1-42-induced 
neurotoxicity. The chemically stimulated nanoplatform not only solves the drug 
delivery problem but also eliminates the need for external light sources. We 
anticipate that this chemically excited nanosystem could also be used for 
targeted delivery of other small molecule drugs.

Deficits in attention are common across a range of neuropsychiatric disorders. A 
multitude of brain regions, including the frontal cortex (FC) and locus 
coeruleus (LC), have been implicated in attention. Regulators of these brain 
regions at the molecular level are not well understood, but might elucidate 
underlying mechanisms of disorders with attentional deficits. To probe this, we 
used chemogenetic stimulation of neurons in the LC with axonal projections to 
the FC, and subsequent bulk RNA-sequencing from the mouse FC. We found that 
stimulation of this circuit caused an increase in transcription of the Apoe 
gene. To investigate cell type-specific expression of Apoe in the FC, we used a 
dual-virus approach to express either the excitatory DREADD receptor hM3Dq in LC 
neurons with projections to the FC, or a control virus, and found that increases 
in Apoe expression in the FC following depolarization of LC inputs is enriched 
in GABAergic neurons in a sex-dependent manner. The results of these experiments 
yield insights into how Apoe expression affects function in cortical 
microcircuits that are important for attention-guided behavior, and point to 
interneuron-specific expression of Apoe as a potential target for the 
amelioration of attention symptoms in disorders such as attention-deficit 
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Menopausal loss of neuroprotective estrogen is thought to contribute to the sex 
differences in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Activation of estrogen receptor beta 
(ERβ) can be clinically relevant since it avoids the negative systemic effects 
of ERα activation. However, very few studies have explored ERβ-mediated 
neuroprotection in AD, and no information on its contribution to the sex 
differences in AD exists. In the present study we specifically explored the role 
of ERβ in mediating sex-specific protection against AD pathology in the 
clinically relevant App NL-G-F knock-in mouse model of amyloidosis, and if 
surgical menopause (ovariectomy) modulates pathology in this model. We treated 
male and female App NL-G-F mice with the selective ERβ agonist LY500307 and 
subset of the females was ovariectomized prior to treatment. Memory performance 
was assessed and a battery of biochemical assays were used to evaluate amyloid 
pathology and neuroinflammation. Primary microglial cultures from male and 
female wild-type and ERβ-knockout mice were used to assess ERβ's effect on 
microglial activation and phagocytosis. We find that ERβ activation protects 
against amyloid pathology and cognitive decline in male and female App NL-G-F 
mice. Ovariectomy increased soluble amyloid beta (Aβ) in cortex and insoluble Aβ 
in hippocampus, but had otherwise limited effects on pathology. We further 
identify that ERβ does not alter APP processing, but rather exerts its 
protection through amyloid scavenging that at least in part is mediated via 
microglia in a sex-specific manner. Combined, we provide new understanding to 
the sex differences in AD by demonstrating that ERβ protects against AD 
pathology differently in males and females, warranting reassessment of ERβ in 
combating AD.

BACKGROUND: Digital speech assessment has potential relevance in the earliest, 
preclinical stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We evaluated the feasibility, 
test-retest reliability, and association with AD-related amyloid-beta (Aβ) 
pathology of speech acoustics measured over multiple assessments in a remote 
setting.
METHODS: Fifty cognitively unimpaired adults (Age 68 ± 6.2 years, 58% female, 
46% Aβ-positive) completed remote, tablet-based speech assessments (i.e., 
picture description, journal-prompt storytelling, verbal fluency tasks) for five 
days. The testing paradigm was repeated after 2-3 weeks. Acoustic speech 
features were automatically extracted from the voice recordings, and mean scores 
were calculated over the 5-day period. We assessed feasibility by adherence 
rates and usability ratings on the System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire. 
Test-retest reliability was examined with intraclass correlation coefficients 
(ICCs). We investigated the associations between acoustic features and 
Aβ-pathology, using linear regression models, adjusted for age, sex and 
education.
RESULTS: The speech assessment was feasible, indicated by 91.6% adherence and 
usability scores of 86.0 ± 9.9. High reliability (ICC ≥ 0.75) was found across 
averaged speech samples. Aβ-positive individuals displayed a higher 
pause-to-word ratio in picture description (B = -0.05, p = 0.040) and 
journal-prompt storytelling (B = -0.07, p = 0.032) than Aβ-negative individuals, 
although this effect lost significance after correction for multiple testing.
CONCLUSION: Our findings support the feasibility and reliability of multi-day 
remote assessment of speech acoustics in cognitively unimpaired individuals with 
and without Aβ-pathology, which lays the foundation for the use of speech 
biomarkers in the context of early AD.

Since 2014, sacubitril/valsartan (Entresto®) is widely prescribed for heart 
failure. Despite neprilysin inhibition's benefits in heart failure, concerns 
about potential amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulation and Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk 
have persisted. This narrative review, a decade post-approval, evaluates the 
risk of amyloid pathology and neurocognitive disorders in long-term 
sacubitril/valsartan use. Clinical trials, real-world studies, and 
pharmacovigilance data do not indicate an increased risk of cognitive decline. 
In patients treated with sacubitril/valsartan blood-based amyloid biomarkers 
show perturbations, while neuroimaging biomarkers reveal no significant increase 
in amyloid load. Despite a theoretical risk of amyloid accumulation and AD under 
treatment with sacubitril/valsartan, current clinical data appears reassuring, 
and there is no signal indicating an increased risk of cognitive decline, but a 
perturbation of amyloid blood-based biomarkers, which implies great caution when 
interpreting biomarkers in this context.

INTRODUCTION: Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) agonists 
are being clinically evaluated as disease-modifying therapeutics for Alzheimer's 
disease. Clinically translatable pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers are needed to 
confirm drug activity and select the appropriate therapeutic dose in clinical 
trials.
METHODS: We conducted multi-omic analyses on paired non-human primate brain and 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and stimulation of human induced pluripotent stem 
cell-derived microglia cultures after TREM2 agonist treatment, followed by 
validation of candidate fluid PD biomarkers using immunoassays. We immunostained 
microglia to characterize proliferation and clustering.
RESULTS: We report CSF soluble TREM2 (sTREM2) and CSF chitinase-3-like protein 1 
(CHI3L1/YKL-40) as PD biomarkers for the TREM2 agonist hPara.09. The respective 
reduction of sTREM2 and elevation of CHI3L1 in brain and CSF after TREM2 agonist 
treatment correlated with transient microglia proliferation and clustering.
DISCUSSION: CSF CHI3L1 and sTREM2 reflect microglial TREM2 agonism and can be 
used as clinical PD biomarkers to monitor TREM2 activity in the brain.
HIGHLIGHTS: CSF soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 
(sTREM2) reflects brain target engagement for a novel TREM2 agonist, hPara.09. 
CSF chitinase-3-like protein 1 reflects microglial TREM2 agonism. Both can be 
used as clinical fluid biomarkers to monitor TREM2 activity in brain.

BACKGROUND: High-throughput experimental technologies can provide deeper 
insights into pathway perturbations in biomedical studies. Accordingly, their 
usage is central to the identification of molecular targets and the subsequent 
development of suitable treatments for various diseases. Classical 
interpretations of generated data, such as differential gene expression and 
pathway analyses, disregard interconnections between studied genes when looking 
for gene-disease associations. Given that these interconnections are central to 
cellular processes, there has been a recent interest in incorporating them in 
such studies. The latter allows the detection of gene modules that underlie 
complex phenotypes in gene interaction networks. Existing methods either impose 
radius-based restrictions or freely grow modules at the expense of a statistical 
bias towards large modules. We propose a heuristic method, inspired by Ant 
Colony Optimization, to apply gene-level scoring and module identification with 
distance-based search constraints and penalties, rather than radius-based 
constraints.
RESULTS: We test and compare our results to other approaches using three 
datasets of different neurodegenerative diseases, namely Alzheimer's, 
Parkinson's, and Huntington's, over three independent experiments. We report the 
outcomes of enrichment analyses and concordance of gene-level scores for each 
disease. Results indicate that the proposed approach generally shows superior 
stability in comparison to existing methods. It produces stable and meaningful 
enrichment results in all three datasets which have different case to control 
proportions and sample sizes.
CONCLUSION: The presented network-based gene expression analysis approach 
successfully identifies dysregulated gene modules associated with a certain 
disease. Using a heuristic based on Ant Colony Optimization, we perform a 
distance-based search with no radius constraints. Experimental results support 
the effectiveness and stability of our method in prioritizing modules of high 
relevance. Our tool is publicly available at

In an experimental model of Alzheimer's disease in mice, oral administration of 
trehalose disaccharide reduces neuroinflammation assessed by the expression 
level of microglia activation marker Iba1 and affects the neutrophil 
degranulation activity. A potential anti-inflammatory effect of 4% trehalose 
solution associated with a decrease in the activity of leukocyte elastase in 
plasma was revealed.

Ganoderma lucidum (Curtis) P. Karst.(G. lucidum) is a kind of fungi, which also 
a traditional Chinese medicine used for "wisdom growth" in China. Triterpenoids 
from G. lucidum (GLTs) are one of the main active ingredients. Based on the 
strategy of early intervention on Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the inextricable 
association between disordered gut microbiota and metabolites with AD, this 
study aimed to explore the mechanisms of GLTs in the protection against AD via 
microbiota-gut-brain axis with the aid of network pharmacology. In this study, 
LC-MS/MS was used to identify the main active ingredients of GLTs. Network 
pharmacology was used to predict the potential target and validated with Caco-2 
cell model. D-galactose was used to induce the slow-onset AD on rats. 
Metabolomics methods basing on GC-MS combined with 16S rRNA sequencing 
technology was used to carry out microbiota-gut-metabolomics analysis in order 
to reveal the potential mechanisms of GLTs in the protection of AD. As results, 
GLTs showed a protection against AD effect on rats by intervening 
administration. The mechanisms were inextricably linked to GLTs interference 
with the balance of gut microbiota and metabolites. The main fecal metabolites 
involved were short-chain fatty acids and aromatic amino acid metabolites.

Alpinia oxyphylla is famous for its neuroprotective and memory-improving 
effects. A crude polysaccharide AO70 from A. oxyphylla remarkably ameliorated 
neuroinflammation and cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease mice. This 
study aimed to explore the bioactive component of AO70 and its mechanism of 
action. A homogeneous polysaccharide (AOP70-1) rich in arabinose and xylose was 
purified from AO70, which was consisted of α-L-Araf-(1→, →5)-α-L-Araf-(1→, 
β-D-Xylp-(1→,→2,4)-β-D-Xylp-(1→, →2,3,4)-β-D-Xylp-(1→, α-L-Rhap-(1→, 
α-D-Manp-(1→, →4)-α-D-Glcp-(1→, →4)-α-D-GlcpA-(1→, β-D-Galp-(1→, 
→2)-α-D-Galp-(1→, →6)-α-D-Galp-(1 → and →3,6)-α-D-Manp-(1 →. AOP70-1 (2.5, 5, 
10 μM) significantly suppressed NO, IL-1β, and TNF-α production in a 
concentration-dependent manner and inhibited the migration of BV2 microglia. 
AOP70-1 inhibited LPS-mediated activation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), 
myeloid differentiation primary response protein (MyD88), and nuclear factor 
kappa B (NF-κB). Moreover, AOP70-1 exerted neuroprotection on SH-SY5Y cells and 
primary neurons by reducing neuronal apoptosis (72 %, 44 %), alleviating ROS 
accumulation (63 %, 55 %), and improving mitochondrial membrane potential (63 %, 
77 %). Overall, AOP70-1 is one of the major bioactive components in AO70 from A. 
oxyphylla, which has great potential in the prevention and treatment of

Alzheimer's disease (AD) presents a growing global health concern. In recent 
decades, natural and synthetic chromenone have emerged as promising drug 
candidates due to their multi-target potential. Natural chromenone, quercetin, 
scopoletin, esculetin, coumestrol, umbelliferone, bergapten, and methoxsalen 
(xanthotoxin), and synthetic chromenone hybrids comprising structures like 
acridine, 4-aminophenyl, 3-arylcoumarins, quinoline, 1,3,4-oxadiazole, 
1,2,3-triazole, and tacrine, have been explored for their potential to combat 
AD. Key reactions used for synthesis of chromenone hybrids include Perkin and 
Pechmann condensation. The activity of chromenone hybrids has been reported 
against several drug targets, including AChE, BuChE, BACE-1, and MAO-A/B. This 
review comprehensively explores natural, semisynthetic, and synthetic 
chromenone, elucidating their synthetic routes, possible mode of action/drug 
targets and structure-activity relationships (SAR). The acquired knowledge 
provides valuable insights for the development of new chromenone hybrids against 
AD.

OBJECTIVE: To systematically assess the effectiveness of transcranial direct 
current stimulation (tDCS) on global cognition in patients with mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD).
DATA SOURCES: Ten databases were retrieved for pertinent Chinese and English 
studies published up until February 2023.
DATA EXTRACTION: Two researchers independently selected the literature, 
extracted the data, evaluated using the Cochrane Collaboration's quality 
criteria, and then cross-checked. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.4.
RESULTS: 22 studies involving 1074 patients were included. Compared with the 
control group received the interventions such as pharmacotherapy, cognitive 
stimulation, et al., with/without sham-tDCS, while the experiment group received 
tDCS added to the interventions of the control group. The meta-analysis found 
that tDCS increased MMSE, MoCA, MODA scores and reduced the P300 latency scores 
(all P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The tDCS can ameliorate the global cognition of patients with MCI 
and AD, and it has a better rehabilitation effect than non-tDCS or sham-tDCS.

Soluble transforming growth factor beta receptor 3 (sTGFBR3) antagonist is a new 
focus in the research and development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) drugs. Our 
previous studies have identified sTGFBR3 as a promising new target for AD, with 
few targeted antagonists identified. In this study, we performed structural 
modeling of sTGFBR3 using AlphaFold2, followed by high-throughput virtual 
screening and surface plasmon resonance assays. which collectively identified 
Xanthone as potential compounds for targeting sTGFBR3. After optimizing the 
sTGFBR3-Xanthone complex using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we prepared 
a series of novel Xanthone derivatives and evaluated their anti-inflammatory 
activity, toxicity, and structure-activity relationship in BV2 cell model 
induced by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) or APP/PS1/tau mouse brain extract (BE). 
Several derivatives with the most potent anti-inflammatory activity were tested 
for blood-brain barrier permeability and sTGFBR3 affinity. Derivative P24, 
selected for its superior properties, was further evaluated in vitro. The 
results indicated that P24 increased the activation of TGF-β signaling and 
decreased the activation of IκBα/NF-κB signaling by targeting sTGFBR3, thereby 
regulating the inflammation-phagocytosis balance in microglia. Moreover, the low 
acute toxicity, long half-life, and low plasma clearance of P24 suggest that it 
can be sustained in vivo. This property may render P24 a more effective 
treatment modality for chronic diseases, particularly AD. The study demonstrates 
P24 serve as potential novel candidates for the treatment of AD via antagonizing 
sTGFBR3.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the 
accumulation of amyloid-β outside neurons and Tau protein inside neurons. 
Various pathological mechanisms are implicated in AD, including brain insulin 
resistance, neuroinflammation, and endocrinal dysregulation of adrenal 
corticosteroids. These factors collectively contribute to neuronal damage and 
destruction. Recently, bile acids (BAs), which are metabolites of cholesterol, 
have shown neuroprotective potential against AD by targeting the above 
pathological changes. BAs can enter the systematic circulation and cross the 
blood-brain barrier, subsequently exerting neuroprotective effects by targeting 
several endogenous receptors. Additionally, BAs interact with the 
microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis to improve immune and neuroendocrine function 
during AD episodes. Gut microbes impact BA signaling in the brain through their 
involvement in BA biotransformation. In this review, we summarize the role and 
molecular mechanisms of BAs in AD while considering the MGB axis and propose 
novel strategies for preventing the onset and progression of AD.

Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) is the most common form of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). However, modeling sporadic LOAD that endogenously captures 
hallmark neuronal pathologies such as amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition, tau tangles, 
and neuronal loss remains an unmet need. We demonstrate that neurons generated 
by microRNA (miRNA)-based direct reprogramming of fibroblasts from individuals 
affected by autosomal dominant AD (ADAD) and LOAD in a three-dimensional 
environment effectively recapitulate key neuropathological features of AD. 
Reprogrammed LOAD neurons exhibit Aβ-dependent neurodegeneration, and treatment 
with β- or γ-secretase inhibitors before (but not subsequent to) Aβ deposit 
formation mitigated neuronal death. Moreover inhibiting age-associated 
retrotransposable elements in LOAD neurons reduced both Aβ deposition and 
neurodegeneration. Our study underscores the efficacy of modeling late-onset 
neuropathology of LOAD through high-efficiency miRNA-based neuronal 
reprogramming.

BACKGROUND: Older adults often face loneliness due to chronic illness or loss of 
close ones, a situation worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic. Increased loneliness 
heightens the risk of diseases, especially dementia, necessitating urgent 
action.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the impact of a virtual reality (VR)-based 
open-air bath program on depression and loneliness in older individuals with 
subjective cognitive decline/mild cognitive impairment attending the Dementia 
Medical Center in Kyoto, Japan. We further aim to evaluate the feasibility of 
the program (participant recruitment and adherence) and to measure program 
enjoyment and satisfaction.
METHODS: The study design is a crossover trial with a 1:1 ratio, wherein 12 
participants will be randomly assigned to groups 1 and 2, with group 2 serving 
as a waitlist control and group 1 receiving the VR program from the onset for 6 
months; the VR program will be conducted 6 times (monthly). Program completion 
for group 1 will be followed by an observation period from months 7 to 12. Group 
2 will participate in the VR program from months 7 to 12, with an observation 
period from months 1 to 6. Cognitive tests, psychiatric assessments, and the 
University of California, Los Angeles Loneliness Scale will be conducted before 
the study, at 6 months, and at 12 months. Results will be analyzed using 
repeated-measures ANOVA. Head magnetic resonance imaging and single-photon 
emission computed tomography scans will be performed before and after the VR 
program to evaluate changes and effects on brain regions.
RESULTS: Recruitment began in September 2023 and data collection is expected to 
be completed by March 2025. Complete study results will be published by 
September 2025.
CONCLUSIONS: This study examines the preliminary effects of VR on loneliness in 
older adults with predementia through open-air bath simulations. VR experiences 
could benefit this population, particularly those with limited outdoor 
activities. Quantifying VR's impact will aid in determining the size for a 
larger clinical trial. Qualitative results will inform participation mechanisms 
and guide the implementation and design of future trials.

IMPORTANCE: Older adults with lower intake and tissue levels of long-chain ω-3 
polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5) and 
docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6) have more brain white matter lesions (WMLs), an 
association suggesting that small-vessel ischemic disease, a major contributor 
to the development of dementia, including Alzheimer disease, may be preventable 
through ω-3 treatment.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether ω-3 treatment reduces WML accumulation in older 
adults without dementia harboring WMLs and with suboptimal ω-3 status.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This quadruple-blinded, placebo-controlled, 
randomized clinical trial with treatment stratification by apolipoprotein E ε4 
allele (APOE*E4) carrier status used linear mixed-effects models to estimate 
mean annual change between groups. The study was conducted at Oregon Health & 
Science University, a major academic medical center in the Pacific Northwest, 
from May 2014 to final participant visit in September 2019. Data analysis 
concluded in July 2022. Participants were adults without dementia aged 75 years 
and older with WMLs greater than or equal to 5 cm3 and plasma ω-3 PUFA less than 
5.5 weight percentage of total.
INTERVENTION: Three-year treatment with 1.65 g of ω-3 PUFA (975 mg of EPA and 
650 mg of DHA) vs a soybean oil placebo matched for taste, smell, and 
appearance.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was annual WML progression 
measured using magnetic resonance imaging. Secondary outcomes included diffusion 
tensor imaging of fractional anisotropy (DTI-FA), representing neuronal 
integrity breakdown.
RESULTS: A total of 102 participants (62 women [60.8%]; mean age, 81 years 
[range, 75-96 years]) were equally randomized, 51 per treatment group. Although 
the ω-3 group had less annual WML accumulation than the placebo group, the 
difference was not statistically significant (1.19 cm3 [95% CI, 0.64-1.74 cm3] 
vs 1.34 cm3 [95% CI, 0.80-1.88 cm3]; P = .30). Similarly, the ω-3 group had less 
annual DTI-FA decline than the placebo group, but the difference was not 
statistically significant (-0.0014 mm2/s [95% CI, -0.0027 to 0.0002 mm2/s] vs 
-0.0027 mm2/s [95% CI, -0.0041 to -0.0014 mm2/s]; P = .07). Among APOE*E4 
carriers, the annual DTI-FA decline was significantly lower in the group treated 
with ω-3 than the placebo group (-0.0016 mm2/s [95% CI, -0.0032 to 0.0020 mm2/s] 
vs -0.0047 mm2/s [95% CI, -0.0067 to -0.0025 mm2/s]; P = .04). Adverse events 
were similar between treatment groups.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this 3-year randomized clinical trial, ω-3 
treatment was safe and well-tolerated but failed to reach significant reductions 
in WML accumulation or neuronal integrity breakdown among all participants, 
which may be attributable to sample size limitations. However, neuronal 
integrity breakdown was reduced by ω-3 treatment in APOE*E4 carriers, suggesting 
that this treatment may be beneficial for this specific group.

Estrogens are pivotal regulators of brain function throughout the lifespan, 
exerting profound effects from early embryonic development to aging. Extensive 
experimental evidence underscores the multifaceted protective roles of estrogens 
on neurons and neurotransmitter systems, particularly in the context of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Studies have consistently revealed a 
greater risk of AD development in women compared to men, with postmenopausal 
women exhibiting heightened susceptibility. This connection between sex factors 
and long-term estrogen deprivation highlights the significance of estrogen 
signaling in AD progression. Estrogen's influence extends to key processes 
implicated in AD, including amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and 
neuronal health maintenance mediated by brain-derived neurotrophic factor 
(BDNF). Reduced BDNF expression, often observed in AD, underscores estrogen's 
role in preserving neuronal integrity. Notably, hormone replacement therapy 
(HRT) has emerged as a sex-specific and time-dependent strategy for primary 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention, offering an excellent risk profile 
against aging-related disorders like AD. Evidence suggests that HRT may mitigate 
AD onset and progression in postmenopausal women, further emphasizing the 
importance of estrogen signaling in AD pathophysiology. This review 
comprehensively examines the physiological and pathological changes associated 
with estrogen in AD, elucidating the therapeutic potential of estrogen-based 
interventions such as HRT. By synthesizing current knowledge, it aims to provide

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by cognitive decline stemming from the 
accumulation of beta-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and the propagation of tau pathology 
through synapses. Exosomes, crucial mediators in neuronal development, 
maintenance, and intercellular communication, have gained attention in AD 
research. Yet, the molecular mechanisms involving exosomal miRNAs in AD remain 
elusive. In this study, we treated APPswe/PSEN1dE9 transgenic (APP/PS1) mice, a 
model for AD, with either vehicle (ADNS) or fasudil (ADF), while C57BL/6 
(control) mice received vehicle (WT). Cognitive function was evaluated using the 
Y-maze test, and AD pathology was confirmed through immunostaining and western 
blot analysis of Aβ plaques and phosphorylated tau. Exosomal RNAs were 
extracted, sequenced, and analyzed from each mouse group. Our findings revealed 
that fasudil treatment improved cognitive function in AD mice, as evidenced by 
increased spontaneous alternation in the Y-maze test and reduced Aβ plaque load 
and phosphorylated tau protein expression in the hippocampus. Analysis of 
exosomal miRNAs identified three miRNAs (mmu-let-7i-5p, mmu-miR-19a-3p, 
mmu-miR-451a) common to both ADNS vs ADF and WT vs ADNS groups. Utilizing 
miRTarBase software, we predicted and analyzed target genes associated with 
these miRNAs. Gene ontology (GO) annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and 
Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis of miRNA target genes indicated that 
mmu-miR-19a-3p and mmu-miR-451a are implicated in signal transduction, immune 
response, cellular communication, and nervous system pathways. Specifically, 
mmu-miR-19a-3p targeted genes involved in the sphingolipid signaling pathway, 
such as Pten and Tnf, while mmu-miR-451a targeted Nsmaf, Gnai3, and Akt3. 
Moreover, mmu-miR-451a targeted Myc in signaling pathways regulating the 
pluripotency of stem cells. In conclusion, fasudil treatment enhanced cognitive 
function by modulating exosomal MicroRNAs, particularly mmu-miR-451a and 
mmu-miR-19a-3p. These miRNAs hold promise as potential biomarkers and 
therapeutic targets for novel AD treatments.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease 
associated with aging, characterized by progressive cognitive impairment and 
memory loss. However, treatments that delay AD progression or improve its 
symptoms remain limited. The aim of the present study was to investigate the 
therapeutic effects of omaveloxolone (Omav) on AD and to explore the underlying 
mechanisms. Thirty-week-old APP/PS1 mice were selected as an experimental model 
of AD. The spatial learning and memory abilities were tested using the Morris 
water maze. Amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition in the brains was measured using 
immunohistochemistry. Network pharmacological analyses and molecular docking 
were conducted to gain insights into the therapeutic mechanisms of Omav. 
Finally, validation analyses were conducted to detect changes in the associated 
pathways and proteins. Our finding revealed that Omav markedly rescued cognitive 
dysfunction and reduced Aβ deposition in the brains of APP/PS1 mice. Network 
pharmacological analysis identified 112 intersecting genes, with CASP3 and MTOR 
emerging as the key targets. In vivo validation experiments indicated that Omav 
attenuated neuronal apoptosis by regulating apoptotic proteins, including 
caspase 3, Bax, and Bcl-2. Moreover, Omav suppressed neuroinflammation and 
induced autophagy by inhibiting the phosphorylation of mTOR. These findings 
highlight the therapeutic efficacy of Omav in AD and that its neuroprotective 
effects were associated with inhibiting neuronal apoptosis and regulating 
neuroinflammation.

Rectifying the aberrant microenvironment of a disease through maintenance of 
redox homeostasis has emerged as a promising perspective with significant 
therapeutic potential for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Herein, we design and 
construct a novel nanozyme-boosted MOF-CRISPR platform (CMOPKP), which can 
maintain redox homeostasis and rescue the impaired microenvironment of AD. By 
modifying the targeted peptides KLVFFAED, CMOPKP can traverse the blood-brain 
barrier and deliver the CRISPR activation system for precise activation of the 
Nrf2 signaling pathway and downstream redox proteins in regions characterized by 
oxidative stress, thereby reinstating neuronal antioxidant capacity and 
preserving redox homeostasis. Furthermore, cerium dioxide possessing catalase 
enzyme-like activity can synergistically alleviate oxidative stress. Further in 
vivo studies demonstrate that CMOPKP can effectively alleviate cognitive 
impairment in 3xTg-AD mouse models. Therefore, our design presents an effective 
way for regulating redox homeostasis in AD, which shows promise as a therapeutic 
strategy for mitigating oxidative stress in AD.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Precise and timely diagnosis is crucial for the optimal 
use of emerging disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer disease (AD). 
Electroencephalography (EEG), which is noninvasive and cost-effective, can 
capture neural abnormalities linked to various dementias. This study explores 
the use of individual alpha frequency (IAF) derived from EEG as a diagnostic and 
prognostic tool in cognitively impaired patients.
METHODS: This retrospective study included 375 patients from the tertiary Memory 
Clinic of IRCCS San Raffaele Hospital, Milan, Italy. Participants underwent 
clinical and neuropsychological assessments, brain imaging, cerebrospinal fluid 
biomarker analysis, and resting-state EEG. Patients were categorized by amyloid 
status, the AT(N) classification system, clinical diagnosis, and mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) progression to AD dementia. IAF was calculated and compared 
among study groups. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to 
calculate its discriminative performance.
RESULTS: IAF was higher in amyloid-negative subjects and varied significantly 
across AT(N) groups. ROC analysis confirmed IAF's ability to distinguish A-T-N- 
from the A+T+N+ and A+T-N+ groups. IAF was lower in AD and Lewy body dementia 
patients compared to MCI and other dementia types, with moderate discriminatory 
capability. Among A+ MCI patients, IAF was significantly lower in those who 
converted to AD within 2 years compared to stable MCI patients and predicted 
time to conversion (p < 0.001, R = 0.38).
CONCLUSIONS: IAF is a valuable tool for dementia diagnosis and prognosis, 
correlating with amyloid status and neurodegeneration. It effectively predicts 
MCI progression to AD, supporting its use in early, targeted interventions in 
the context of disease-modifying treatments.

The cognitive impairment known as dementia affects millions of individuals 
throughout the globe. The use of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) 
algorithms has shown great promise as a means of early identification and 
treatment of dementia. Dementias such as Alzheimer's Dementia, frontotemporal 
dementia, Lewy body dementia, and vascular dementia are all discussed in this 
article, along with a literature review on using ML algorithms in their 
diagnosis. Different ML algorithms, such as support vector machines, artificial 
neural networks, decision trees, and random forests, are compared and 
contrasted, along with their benefits and drawbacks. As discussed in this 
article, accurate ML models may be achieved by carefully considering feature 
selection and data preparation. We also discuss how ML algorithms can predict 
disease progression and patient responses to therapy. However, overreliance on 
ML and DL technologies should be avoided without further proof. It's important 
to note that these technologies are meant to assist in diagnosis but should not 
be used as the sole criteria for a final diagnosis. The research implies that ML 
algorithms may help increase the precision with which dementia is diagnosed, 
especially in its early stages. The efficacy of ML and DL algorithms in clinical 
contexts must be verified, and ethical issues around the use of personal data 
must be addressed, but this requires more study.

Objectives: The aim of the present study was to study the potential therapeutic 
effects of quercetin in protection against repeated intranasal exposure of an 
amyloid-beta-induced mouse model. Methods: Mice received intranasal Aβ1-42 (5 
μg/10 μL) exposure once daily for seven consecutive days. Quercetin was orally 
administered to them at 30 mg kg-1 and 100 mg kg-1 doses for one week starting 
from day five following Aβ1-42 peptide administration. Following this, the 
animals were evaluated for neurobehavioral parameters using a Morris water maze 
test and a novel object recognition test. Further to this, the biomarkers for 
neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration were evaluated in the hippocampus and 
cortex regions of the brain in these animals. Results: Multiple exposures to 
intranasal Aβ led to a significant decline in the learning and cognitive memory 
of the animals, whereas oral treatment with quercetin at dosages of 30 and 100 
mg kg-1 alleviated Aβ-induced effects. Quercetin treatment significantly reduced 
Aβ accumulation, oxidative stress and proinflammatory cytokine biomarkers in the 
brain. In addition, it also alleviated the activation of astrocytic biomarkers, 
amyloid precursor protein and phosphorylated-tau proteins in the brain. 
Conclusion: Quercetin was found to be a potent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory 
compound with protection against neurodegenerative damage and improved learning 
and cognitive memory in a repeated Aβ-exposure model of AD.

INTRODUCTION: We disclosed amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) results in 
individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and studied patient 
experiences and outcomes over a 6-month period.
METHODS: Fifty-seven participants from the Subjective Cognitive Impairment 
Cohort (SCIENCe) (66 ± 8 years, 21 [37%] F, Mini-Mental State Examination 
29 ± 1, 15 [26%] amyloid positive [A+]) completed questionnaires 1 week prior 
(T0), 1 day after (T1), and 6 months after amyloid PET disclosure (T2). 
Questionnaires addressed patient-reported experiences and outcomes.
RESULTS: Independent of amyloid status, participants were satisfied with the 
consultation (scale 1-10; 7.9 ± 1.7) and information provided (scale 1-4; T1: 
3.3 ± 0.9, T2: 3.2 ± 0.8). After 6 months, A+ participants reported more 
information needs (45% vs. 12%, p = 0.02). Independent of amyloid status, 
decision regret (scale 1-5; A+: 1.5 ± 0.9, A-: 1.4 ± 0.6, p = 0.53) and negative 
emotions (negative affect, uncertainty, anxiety) were low (all p > 0.15 and 
Pinteraction > 0.60).
DISCUSSION: Participants with SCD valued amyloid PET disclosure positively, 
regardless of amyloid status. The need for information after 6 months, which was 
stronger in A+ individuals, underscores the importance of follow-up.
HIGHLIGHTS: Participants with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) positively 
valued amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) disclosure. Participants with 
SCD experienced low levels of decision regret. We did not observe an increase in 
negative emotions. After 6 months, amyloid-positive individuals wanted more 
information.

INTRODUCTION: Are reductions in the rate of decline from the new 
disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) in early Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
meaningful? We examined whether such reductions may be reflected in changes in 
health-related resource use.
METHODS: Patients with Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) = 0.5 or 1 with a clinical 
diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment or AD, reflecting clinical trial 
populations. Health-related resource use was reported using the Resource Use 
Inventory (RUI) including direct medical care, non-medical care, unpaid informal 
care, and time use.
RESULTS: Faster decline in CDR-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) from baseline was 
independently associated with higher likelihood and hours of informal care 
received, and lower likelihood of employment/volunteer work, but not with direct 
medical care.
DISCUSSION: Reductions in the rate of decline in CDR-SB seen from DMTs 
significantly affect patients' work capacity and need for informal care, 
indicators of economic impact meaningful to patients, families, and health 
systems. These measures are not readily captured in administrative data sets.
HIGHLIGHTS: Following a cohort of participants with MCI or mild dementia due to 
AD that mimics participants targeted for AD trials, this study showed slower 
decline in CDR-SB have significant effects on patients' work capacity and need 
for informal care, but not on their direct medical care utilization such as 
hospitalizations, ED use, and doctors' visits.Capturing potential benefits in 
health-related resource use may require direct measures of informal care and 
work/volunteer effort which are meaningful outcomes to patients, families and 
health systems.Caution is needed in our effort to assess benefits of recently 
developed disease modifying treatment in AD using electronic health records and 
administrative data from which utilization of direct medical care are routinely 
collected as these data sources may not capture the most apparent changes in 
resource utilization during early disease stages.

Targeting brain insulin resistance (BIR) has become an attractive alternative to 
traditional therapeutic treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Incretin 
receptor agonists (IRAs), targeting either or both of the glucagon-like peptide 
1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptors, have 
proven to reverse BIR and improve cognition in mouse models of AD. We previously 
showed that many, but not all, IRAs can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) 
after intravenous (IV) delivery. Here we determined if widespread brain uptake 
of IRAs could be achieved by circumventing the BBB using intranasal (IN) 
delivery, which has the added advantage of minimizing adverse gastrointestinal 
effects of systemically delivered IRAs. Of the 5 radiolabeled IRAs tested 
(exenatide, dulaglutide, semaglutide, DA4-JC, and DA5-CH) in CD-1 mice, 
exenatide, dulaglutide, and DA4-JC were successfully distributed throughout the 
brain following IN delivery. We observed significant sex differences in uptake 
for DA4-JC. Dulaglutide and DA4-JC exhibited high uptake by the hippocampus and 
multiple neocortical areas. We further tested and found the presence of 
AD-associated Aβ pathology minimally affected uptake of dulaglutide and DA4-JC. 
Of the 5 tested IRAs, dulaglutide and DA4-JC are best capable of accessing brain 
regions most vulnerable in AD (neocortex and hippocampus) after IN 
administration. Future studies will need to be performed to determine if IN IRA 
delivery can reduce BIR in AD or animal models of that disorder.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
that severely affects cognitive functions and social behaviors, leading to a 
significant decline in an individual's quality of life. Auditory processing 
deficits often precede the clinical symptoms of AD, prompting interest in 
auditory-based interventions as potential treatments. This scoping review aimed 
to compile the existing evidence on active and passive auditory-based 
interventions for individuals with AD and its prodromal stages.
METHOD AND RESULTS: This scoping review followed Arksey and O'Malley's five-step 
framework to identify the existing evidence on auditory-based interventions for 
AD. Four databases (PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL, and Embase) were used to 
search for studies on auditory stimulation techniques to treat cognitive decline 
in AD patients. In total, 14 studies were included in the analysis. Seven 
studies explored active auditory stimulation techniques, such as the Brain 
Fitness Program (BrainHQ), aiming to improve cognitive function in individuals 
with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). The other seven studies focused on passive 
auditory stimulation, often combined with other sensory stimuli such as light or 
tactile inputs. Passive stimulation studies have focused mainly on Gamma 
Entrainment Using Sensory Stimulation (GENUS). The intervention frequency and 
duration varied across studies, ranging from one session lasting 8 h to a year. 
Both active and passive auditory stimulation showed potential for enhancing 
cognitive function in individuals with AD.
CONCLUSION: The literature suggests that auditory stimulation may positively 
influence cortical wiring and enhance cognitive abilities. Multimodal 
interventions that combine auditory stimulation with other sensory or 
behavioural approaches could yield more substantial effects on global cognition. 
However, the study design, intervention characteristics and outcome measures 
varied across studies, underscoring the necessity for standardised reporting. 
Well-designed studies using standard cognitive assessment protocols are 
recommended.

INTRODUCTION: Given the prevalence and staggering cost of neurological 
disorders, there is dire need for effective early detection and intervention 
tools. Emerging evidence suggests that multidisciplinary lifestyle interventions 
(MLI) may mitigate the risk and progression of neurological disorders. The 
objectives of this protocol are (1) to test the impact of MLI on the progression 
of neurological disorders and (2) to identify multi-omic biomarkers for early 
stages of neurological disease and the impact of MLIs on these biomarkers.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We present the Multidisciplinary lifestyle Interventions 
for Neurological Disorders during the Silent phase (MINDS) protocol, a 
randomized controlled trial of MLI in neurologically healthy older adults (≥ 50 
years old) exhibiting elevated risk for common neurological disorders: stroke, 
epilepsy, Parkinson's Disease, or Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. 
Participants will be randomly assigned to intervention (n = 100) or control 
(n = 100) groups. The intervention group will receive 3 months of weekly 2-hour 
sessions on diet education, yoga, music therapy, and cognitive skills training. 
The participants' neurological health and engagement in relevant lifestyle 
practices will be assessed at regular intervals for 12 months. Neuroimaging and 
samples for multi-omic analyses will be collected at baseline, and at 3 months 
and 12 months after enrollment. Primary outcomes will be signs of progression of 
the neurological disorder risk that qualified them for study enrollment or a 
clinical diagnosis of the disorder. Secondary and exploratory outcomes will be 
based on self-reported health and multi-omic data. Data analysis will include 
between-group and longitudinal within-group analyses.
PERSPECTIVES: The MINDS protocol and trial aims to clarify the impact of MLI on 
the progression of neurological disorder risk or diagnosis in older adults and 
to identify biomarkers that can be used to confirm MLI efficacy. The ability to 
validate the impact of MLI on neurological disorder progression based on 
biomarker data allows the identification of individuals most likely to benefit 
from such therapies in the early stages of neurological disease.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial is registered on the National Institutes of Health 
(NIH) ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05984056) site. It was registered on August 2nd, 
2023. The trial has full approval of the Cleveland Clinic Internal Review Board.

The Bauhinia ungulata, also known by its common name "pata de vaca", is one of 
the species used in Brazil for medicinal purposes, and is commonly used for the 
treatment of diabetes. In this study, the authors studied the interaction 
between the chemical constituents which are present in the essential oil of 
Bauhinia ungulata (EOBU), collected in Boa Vista-RR, Legal Amazon, and their 
effects on the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in the essential oil. The 
analysis that we perform includes proton magnetic resonance ( 1H NMR), enzymatic 
inhibition, molecular docking, in silico toxicity prediction, enrichment 
analysis, and target prediction for biological interactions. According to the 
tests performed on the essential oil, it obtained 100% inhibition of the enzyme 
AChE. During 1H NMR experiments, it was found that α- Bisabolol, one of the main 
components, had a significant alteration in its chemical shift. A molecular 
docking analysis confirmed that this compound binds to the AChE enzyme, which 
confirms the 1H NMR analysis. The results of this work showed that the major 
component of EOBU acted as a possible inhibitor of AChE enzyme in vitro and in 
silico assays. These results show that EOBU could be potentially applied in 
Alzheimer's disease treatment.

Neurological disorders pose a huge worldwide challenge to the healthcare system, 
necessitating innovative strategies for targeted drug delivery to the central 
nervous system. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an untreatable neurodegenerative 
condition characterized by dementia and alterations in a patient's physiological 
and mental states. Since ancient times, medicinal plants have been an important 
source of bioactive phytochemicals with immense therapeutic potential. This 
review investigates new and safer alternatives for prevention and treatment of 
disease related to inevitable side effects associated with synthetic compounds. 
This review examines how nanotechnology can help in enhancing the delivery of 
neuroprotective phytochemicals in AD. Nevertheless, despite their remarkable 
neuroprotective properties, these natural products often have poor therapeutic 
efficacy due to low bioavailability, limited solubility and imperfect blood 
brain barrier (BBB) penetration. Nanotechnology produces personalized drug 
delivery systems which are necessary for solving such problems. In overcoming 
these challenges, nanotechnology might be employed as a way forward whereby 
customized medication delivery systems would be established as a result. The use 
of nanocarriers in the design and application of important phytochemicals is 
highlighted by this review, which indicate potential for revolutionizing 
neuroprotective drug delivery. We also explore the complications and 
possibilities of using nanocarriers to supply nutraceuticals and improve 
patients' standard of living, and preclinical as well as clinical investigations 
displaying that these techniques are effective in mitigating neurodegenerative 
diseases. In order to fight brain diseases and improve patient's health, 
scientists and doctors can employ nanotechnology with its possible therapeutic 
interventions.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, neuroinflammation, 
and neuronal death. Besides aging, various comorbidities increase the risk of 
AD, including obesity, diabetes, and allergic asthma. Epidemiological studies 
have reported a 2.17-fold higher risk of dementia in asthmatic patients. 
However, the molecular mechanism(s) underlying this asthma-associated AD 
exacerbation is unknown. This study was designed to explore house dust mite 
(HDM)-induced asthma effects on AD-related brain changes using the AppNL-G-F 
transgenic mouse model of disease. Male and female 8-9 months old C57BL/6J wild 
type and AppNL-G-F mice were exposed to no treatment, saline sham, or HDM 
extract every alternate day for 16 weeks for comparison across genotypes and 
treatment. Mice were euthanized at the end of the experiment, and 
broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF), blood, lungs, and brains were collected. 
BALF was used to quantify immune cell phenotype, cytokine levels, total protein 
content, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, and total IgE. Lungs were 
sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin, Alcian blue, and Masson's 
trichrome. Serum levels of cytokines and soluble Aβ1-40/42 were quantified. 
Brains were sectioned and immunostained for Aβ, GFAP, CD68, and collagen IV. 
Finally, frozen hippocampi and temporal cortices were used to perform Aβ ELISAs 
and cytokine arrays, respectively. HDM exposure led to increased levels of 
inflammatory cells, cytokines, total protein content, LDH activity, and total 
IgE in the BALF, as well as increased pulmonary mucus and collagen staining in 
both sexes and genotypes. Levels of serum cytokines increased in all HDM-exposed 
groups. Serum from the AppNL-G-F HDM-induced asthma group also had significantly 
increased soluble Aβ1-42 levels in both sexes. In agreement with this peripheral 
change, hippocampi from asthma-induced male and female AppNL-G-F mice 
demonstrated elevated Aβ plaque load and increased soluble Aβ 1-40/42 and 
insoluble Aβ 1-40 levels. HDM exposure also increased astrogliosis and 
microgliosis in both sexes of AppNL-G-F mice, as indicated by GFAP and CD68 
immunoreactivity, respectively. Additionally, HDM exposure elevated cortical 
levels of several cytokines in both sexes and genotypes. Finally, HDM-exposed 
groups also showed a disturbed blood-brain-barrier (BBB) integrity in the 
hippocampus of AppNL-G-F mice, as indicated by decreased collagen IV 
immunoreactivity. HDM exposure was responsible for an asthma-like condition in 
the lungs that exacerbated Aβ pathology, astrogliosis, microgliosis, and 
cytokine changes in the brains of male and female AppNL-G-F mice that correlated 
with reduced BBB integrity. Defining mechanisms of asthma effects on the brain 
may identify novel therapeutic targets for asthma and AD.

AIMS: This study investigates the neuroprotective effects of lipidized analogues 
of 2-SS-CART(61-102) derived from anorexigenic neuropeptide cocaine- and 
amphetamine-regulated transcript peptide (CARTp) in light of the link between 
obesity, its comorbidities, and the development of Alzheimer's disease.
METHODS: We introduce novel lipidized analogues derived from 2-SS-CART(61-102), 
a specific analogue of natural CART(61-102), with two disulfide bridges. Using 
hypothermic PC12 cells, we tested the effect of the most potent analogues on Tau 
phosphorylation. We further described the anorexigenic and neuroprotective 
potential of subcutaneously (SC) injected lipidized CARTp analogue in a mouse 
model with prediabetes and obesity induced by neonatal monosodium glutamate 
(MSG) administration.
RESULTS: Compared to the non-lipidized 2-SS-CART(61-102), all lipidized 
analogues exhibited a potent binding affinity to PC12 cells and enhanced in 
vitro stability in rat plasma. Two most potent lipidized analogues attenuated 
hypothermia-induced Tau hyperphosphorylation at multiple epitopes. Subsequently, 
chronic SC treatment with palm-2-SS-CART(61-102) significantly decreased body 
weight and food intake, improved metabolic parameters, decreased level of pTau 
and increased neurogenesis in hippocampi of obese MSG mice.
CONCLUSION: Our unique CARTp analogue palm-2-SS-CART(61-102) shows promise as a 
potent anti-obesity and neuroprotective agent.
