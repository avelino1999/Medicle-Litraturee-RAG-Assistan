Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressiveneurodegenerative condition is marked by 
extensive damage in the brain and dementia. Among the pathological hallmarks of 
AD is beta-amyloid (Aβ). Production of toxic Aβ oligomers production and 
accumulation in the brain is among the characteristic features of the disease. 
The abnormal accumulation Aβ is initiated by the catalytic degradation of 
Amyloid Precursor Proteins (APP) by Beta Amyloid Cleaving Enzyme 1 (BACE1) to 
generate insoluble amyloid plaques. The abnormal proteins are mitochondrial 
poison which disrupt the energy production and liberate excessive free radicals 
causing neuronal damage and mutations. Consequently, targeting Aβ-associated 
pathways has become a focus in the pursuit of developing effective AD 
treatments. An obstacle faced by many medications used to treat 
neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) is the restricted permeability across the 
blood-brain barrier (BBB). Unfortunately, no anti-amyloid drug is clinically 
approved till now. Recent advancements in nanotechnology have provided a 
possible solution for delivering medications to specific targets. By integrating 
natural products with nano-medicinal approaches, it is possible to develop novel 
and highly efficient therapeutic strategies for the treatment of AD.

Neurodegenerative diseases, notably Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, hallmark their 
progression through the formation of amyloid aggregates resulting from 
misfolding. While current therapeutics alleviate symptoms, they do not impede 
disease onset. In this context, repurposing existing drugs stands as a viable 
therapeutic strategy. Our study determines the antihistamine drug Cimetidine's 
potential as an inhibitor using diverse spectroscopic and microscopic methods on 
alpha-synuclein and human insulin amyloid formation, unveiling its efficacy. The 
thioflavin T (ThT) assay illustrated a dose-dependent reduction in amyloid 
formation with escalating concentrations of Cimetidine. Notably, the 
antihistamine drug maintained a helical structure and showed no significant 
conformational changes in the secondary structure. Confocal microscopy validated 
fewer fibrils in the Cimetidine-treated samples. Remarkably, Cimetidine 
interacted with pre-existing fibrils, leading to their disintegration. Further 
analyses (ThT, circular dichroism, and dynamic light scattering) showcased the 
conversion of fibrils into smaller aggregates upon Cimetidine addition. These 
findings signify the potential of this antihistamine drug as a plausible 
therapeutic option for Parkinson's disease. This study may open avenues for 
deeper investigations and possible therapeutic developments, emphasizing 
Cimetidine's promising role in mitigating neurodegenerative diseases like 
Parkinson's.

Recent advances in Alzheimer's disease therapy: clinical trials and literature 
review of novel enzyme inhibitors targeting amyloid precursor protein.

INTRODUCTION: Amyloid precursor protein (APP) plays a central role in the 
pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The accumulation of beta-amyloid 
protein is believed to be a crucial step in the development of AD. Therefore, 
understanding the complex biology of APP and its various cleavage products may 
be useful for developing effective therapeutic strategies for AD.
AREAS COVERED: The amyloidogenic pathway of APP processing involves proteolytic 
cleavage by two prominent secretases, γ-Secretase and β-secretase. In the late 
2000s, multiple pharmaceutical drugs that inhibited γ-Secretase and β-Secretase 
were synthesized, some of which advanced to human clinical trials. 
Unfortunately, neither γ-Secretase nor β-secretase inhibitors have been approved 
by the FDA due to both lack of efficacy and concerns for serious side effects.
EXPERT OPINION: While targeting of Aβ accumulation through secretase inhibitors 
was halted due to severe side effects, γ-Secretase modulators (GSMs) have arisen 
as a potential alternative approach. First-generation GSMs could modulate 
γ-secretase activity without affecting Notch cleavage. However, to improve 
potency and brain penetration, second-generation GSMs were developed to reduce 
levels of the amylogenic form of Aβ, Aβ42, without affecting the NOTCH signaling 
pathway. Several of these drugs have progressed to clinical trials, although 
with mixed results. The development of GSM's continues to serve as a potentially 
safer approach to modulating Aβ production in AD treatment.

Promising therapeutic strategies are being explored to replace or regenerate the 
neuronal populations that are lost in patients with neurodegenerative disorders. 
Several research groups have attempted direct reprogramming of astrocytes into 
neurons by manipulating the expression of polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 
(PTBP1) and claimed putative converted neurons to be functional, which led to 
improved disease outcomes in animal models of several neurodegenerative 
disorders. However, a few other studies reported data that contradict these 
claims, raising doubt about whether PTBP1 suppression truly reprograms 
astrocytes into neurons and the therapeutic potential of this approach. This 
review discusses recent advances in regenerative therapeutics including stem 
cell transplantations for central nervous system disorders, with a particular 
focus on Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. We also provide a perspective on 
this controversy by considering that astrocyte heterogeneity may be the key to 
understanding the discrepancy in published studies, and that certain 
subpopulations of these glial cells may be more readily converted into neurons.

Sciences, Irvine, California.

Background: Cholinesterase (ChE) inhibitors enhance central cholinergic function 
and are considered as standard treatments to ameliorate symptoms relating to 
Alzheimer's disease. Though anticholinergic medications directly antagonize the 
effects of ChE inhibitors, they are commonly prescribed among hospitalized 
adults. Objective: To determine the impact of high anticholinergic burden (ACB) 
on length of stay (LOS) and 30-day readmission rates among hospitalized patients 
receiving concomitant ChE inhibitors. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort 
study conducted at a tertiary care academic medical center involving 
hospitalized patients on medical floors who received any Food and Drug 
Administration-approved ChE inhibitors during their hospital stay from October 
1, 2022, to September 30, 2023. The primary outcome of the study was to compare 
hospital LOS among patients with high (ACB ≥ 3) versus low (ACB < 3) ACB. The 
secondary outcome was to assess the impact of ACB burden on 30-day readmission 
rates. Results: Among hospitalized adults, patients with high ACB exposure had a 
significantly longer hospital LOS (median: 5.50 vs 4.25 days; P < 0.001) than 
patients with low ACB exposure, after adjusting for covariates. Analysis of 
secondary outcome revealed that though the high ACB group had a higher 30-day 
readmission rate compared with the lower ACB group (6.8% vs. 2.2%), the 
difference was not statistically significant (OR = 3.46, 95% CI 0.85-14.08; P = 
0.083). Conclusion: A high ACB exposure among older individuals taking 
concurrent ChE inhibitors is associated with a longer hospital stay.

Neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Parkinson's disease (PD) affect millions of people 
worldwide. Curative treatment for these neurodegenerative disorders is still 
lacking and therefore a further understanding of their cause and progression is 
urgently needed. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nanosized vesicles loaded with 
cargo, such as proteins and miRNAs, that are released by cells and play an 
important role in intercellular communication. Intercellular communication 
through EVs can contribute to the spread of pathological proteins, such as 
amyloid-beta and tau, or cause pathogenesis through other mechanisms. In 
addition, EVs may serve as potential biomarkers for diagnosis and for monitoring 
disease progression. In this review, we summarize and discuss recent advances in 
our understanding of the role of EVs in AD, ALS an PD with an emphasis on 
dysregulated cargo in each disease. We highlight shared dysregulated cargo 
between these diseases, discuss underlying pathways, and outline future 
implications for therapeutic strategies.

The U1 snRNP complex recognizes pre-mRNA splicing sites in the early stages of 
spliceosome assembly and suppresses premature cleavage and polyadenylation. Its 
dysfunction may precede Alzheimer's disease (AD) hallmarks. Here we evaluated 
the effects of a synthetic single-stranded cDNA (APT20TTMG) that interacts with 
U1 snRNP, in iPSC-derived neurons from a donor diagnosed with AD and in the 
SAMP8 mouse model. APT20TTMG effectively binds to U1 snRNP, specifically 
decreasing TAU in AD neurons, without changing mitochondrial activity or 
glutamate. Treatment enhanced neuronal electrical activity, promoted an 
enrichment of differentially expressed genes related to key processes affected 
by AD. In SAMP8 mice, APT20TTMG reduced insoluble pTAU in the hippocampus, 
amyloid-beta and GFAP in the cortex, and U1-70 K in both brain regions, without 
cognitive changes. This study highlights the correction of the U1 snRNP complex 
as a new target for AD.

Innovative cellular medicine (ICM) is an exponentially emerging field with a 
promising approach to combating complex and ubiquitous life-threatening diseases 
such as multiple sclerosis (MS), arthritis, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's, 
heart disease, and cancer. Together with the advancement of nanotechnology and 
bio-mechatronics, ICM revolutionizes cellular therapy in understanding the 
essence and nature of the disease initiated at a single-cell level. This paper 
focuses on the intricate nature of cancer that requires multi-disciplinary 
efforts to characterize it well in order to achieve the objectives of modern 
world contemporary medicine in the early detection of the disease at a cellular 
level and potentially arrest its proliferation mechanism. This justifies the 
multidisciplinary research backgrounds of the authors of this paper in advancing 
cellular medicine by bridging the gap between experimental biology and the 
engineering field. Thus, in pursuing this approach, two novel miniaturized and 
highly versatile biomechatronic platforms with dedicated operating software and 
microelectronics are designed, modeled, nanofabricated, and tested in numerous 
in vitro experiments to investigate a hypothesis and arrive at a proven theorem 
in carcinogenesis by interrelating cellular contractile force, membrane 
potential, and cellular morphology for early detection and characterization of 
melanoma cancer cells. The novelties that flourished within this work are 
manifested in sixfold: (1) developing a mathematical model that utilizes a 
Heaviside step function, as well as a pin-force model to compute the contractile 
force of a living cell, (2) deriving an expression of cell-membrane potential 
based on Laplace and Fourier Transform and their Inverse Transform functions by 
encountering Warburg diffusion impedance factor, (3) nano-fabricating novel 
biomechatronic platforms with associated microelectronics and customized 
software that extract cellular physics and mechanics, (4) developing a 
label-free biomarker, (5) arrive at a proved theorem in developing a 
mathematical expression in relating cancer cell mechanobiology to its biophysics 
in connection to the stage of the disease, and (6) to the first time in 
literature, and to the best of the authors' knowledge, discriminating different 
stages and morphology of cancer cell melanoma based on their cell-membrane 
potentials, and associated contractile forces that could introduce a new venue 
of cellular therapeutic modalities, preclinical early cancer diagnosis, and a 
novel approach in immunotherapy drug development. The proposed innovative 
technology-based versatile bio-mechatronic platforms shall be extended for 
future studies, investigating the role of electrochemical signaling of the 
nervous system in cancer formation that will significantly impact modern 
oncology by pursuing a targeted immunotherapy approach. This work also provides 
a robust platform for immunotherapy practitioners in extending the study of 
cellular biophysics in stalling neural-cancer interactions, of which the 
FDA-approved chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapies can be enhanced 
(genetically engineered) in a lab by improving its receptors to capture cancer 
antigens. This work amplifies the importance of studying neurotransmitters and 
electrochemical signaling molecules in shaping the immune T-cell function and 
its effectiveness in arresting cancer proliferation rate (mechanobiology 
mechanism).

Loss of proteostasis is a hallmark of aging and Alzheimer disease (AD). We 
identify β-hydroxybutyrate (βHB), a ketone body, as a regulator of protein 
solubility. βHB primarily provides ATP substrate during periods of reduced 
glucose availability, and regulates other cellular processes through protein 
interactions. We demonstrate βHB-induced protein insolubility is not dependent 
on covalent protein modification, pH, or solute load, and is observable in mouse 
brain in vivo after delivery of a ketone ester. This mechanism is selective for 
pathological proteins such as amyloid-β, and exogenous βHB ameliorates pathology 
in nematode models of amyloid-β aggregation toxicity. We generate libraries of 
the βHB-induced protein insolublome using mass spectrometry proteomics, and 
identify common protein domains and upstream regulators. We show enrichment of 
neurodegeneration-related proteins among βHB targets and the clearance of these 
targets from mouse brain. These data indicate a metabolically regulated 
mechanism of proteostasis relevant to aging and AD.

INTRODUCTION: Despite advancements in adoptive regulatory T cell (Treg) therapy, 
its application in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains constrained by challenges in 
ex vivo Treg selection and expansion with antigen specificity. Our previous 
findings demonstrated the bystander suppressive immunomodulatory mechanism of ex 
vivo expanded amyloid β-specific mouse Tregs in AD models, prompting inquiry 
into the efficacy of ex vivo expanded human Tregs in AD.
METHODS: We developed an effective ex vivo expansion method for manufacturing 
amyloid β-specific human Tregs (Aβ-hTreg) and evaluated their safety and 
efficacy in 3xTg mouse models of AD and a phase 1 clinical trial with six AD 
patients. The phenotype of Aβ-hTreg was analyzed using single-cell 
transcriptomics. The clinical trial involved intravenous administration of 
Aβ-hTreg, with three patients receiving a low dose and three receiving a high 
dose. Exploratory assessments of effectiveness, including cognitive tasks and 
functional evaluations, were conducted ninety days post-treatment.
RESULTS: Behavioral spatial learning and memory impairment, neuroinflammatory 
and amyloid pathology were dramatically ameliorated by single intrathecal 
administration of ex vivo expanded Aβ-hTreg to 3xTg AD mice. Single cell 
transcriptomics analysis revealed alterations in five key genes within a cluster 
of Tregs under antigen-specific manufacturing conditions. In the clinical trial 
with six AD patients, dose-limiting toxicity was experienced by none of the 
participants within five days of receiving GMP-grade Aβ-hTreg (VT301), 
indicating its good tolerability. Although exploratory assessments of 
effectiveness did not reach statistically significant values among the groups, 
these findings offer valuable insights for AD treatment and management, guiding 
the planning of the next phase of clinical trials.
DISCUSSION: This study suggests that hTregs may modulate Alzheimer's disease 
pathology by suppressing neuroinflammation, while VT301 shows promise as a safe 
treatment option. However, further research is necessary to confirm its clinical 
efficacy and optimize treatment strategies.

This study investigates the effects of Pt and Ru complexes containing a Schiff 
base with a diimine structure on Alzheimer's disease. The Schiff base 
(N1E,N2E)-N1,N2-bis(isoquinolin-4-ylmethylene)benzene-1,2-diamine (I) and the 
novel Pt(II) and Ru(II) complexes (Ia and Ib) were synthesized and characterized 
using FTIR, NMR (1H, 13C), mass spectrometry, and elemental analyses. Their 
ability to inhibit amyloid beta (Aβ1-42) aggregation was determined in vitro 
using the SH-SY5Y cell line. Fluorescence spectroscopy investigated the early 
aggregation kinetics and dose-dependent characteristics of Aβ1-42 with the 
complexes. Transmission electron microscopy confirmed the results. 
Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry 
(MALDI-TOF MS) and 1H NMR spectroscopy examined the interaction with Aβ1-16. 
Electrochemical analysis using square wave voltammetry monitored the interaction 
with Aβ1-42. The synthesized complexes were active in inhibiting amyloid 
aggregation at a low molar ratio.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Apraxia is a frequently observed symptom in Alzheimer 
disease (AD), but the causal pathomechanism underlying this dysfunction is not 
well understood. Previous studies have demonstrated associations between various 
cognitive dysfunctions in AD and cortical tau deposition in specific brain 
areas, suggesting a causal relationship. Thus, we hypothesized that specific 
regional patterns of tau pathology in praxis-related brain regions may be 
associated with apraxic deficits in AD. For this purpose, we performed PET 
imaging with the second-generation tau-PET tracer [18F]PI-2620 in a well-defined 
group of patients with AD (N = 33) who had been systematically assessed for 
apraxia.
METHODS: Patients with a biomarker-confirmed diagnosis of AD were recruited in 
addition to a sample of cognitively unimpaired (CU1) control participants. Both 
groups underwent apraxia assessments with the Dementia Apraxia Screening Test. 
In addition, PET imaging with [18F]PI-2620 was performed to assess tau pathology 
in the patients with AD. To specifically investigate the association of apraxia 
severity with regional tau pathology, we compared the PET data from this group 
with an independent sample of amyloid-negative cognitively intact participants 
(CU2) by generation of z-score deviation maps and submitted these maps to a 
voxel-based multiple regression analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 120 participants (39% female) with a mean age of 67.9 (9.2) 
years were included in the study (AD = 33; CU1; N = 33; CU2; N = 54). We 
identified a significant correlation between circumscribed clusters of tau 
aggregation in praxis-related brain regions (including parietal (angular gyrus), 
temporal, and occipital regions) and severity of apraxia in patients with AD. By 
contrast, no significant correlations between tau tracer uptake in primary motor 
cortex or subcortical brain regions and apraxia were observed.
DISCUSSION: These results suggest that tau deposition in specific cortical 
praxis-related brain regions may induce local neuronal dysfunction leading to a 
dose-dependent functional decline in praxis performance in AD. The awareness of 
this relationship could further refine a differentiated individual diagnostic 
characterization and classification of patients with AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that causes memory loss 
and progressive and permanent deterioration of cognitive function. The most 
challenging issue in combating AD is its complicated pathogenesis, which 
includes the deposition of amyloid β (Aβ) plaques, intracellular 
hyperphosphorylated tau protein, neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), etc. Despite 
rapid advancements in mechanistic research and drug development for AD, the 
currently developed drugs only improve cognitive ability and temporarily relieve 
symptoms but cannot prevent the development of AD. Moreover, the blood-brain 
barrier (BBB) creates a huge barrier to drug delivery in the brain. Therefore, 
effective diagnostic tools and treatments are urgently needed. In recent years, 
nanomedicine has provided opportunities to overcome the challenges and 
limitations associated with traditional diagnostics or treatments. Various types 
of nanoparticles (NPs) play an essential role in nanomedicine for the diagnosis 
and treatment of AD, acting as drug carriers to improve targeting and 
bioavailability across/bypass the BBB or acting as drugs directly on AD lesions. 
This review categorizes different types of NPs and summarizes their applications 
in nanomedicine for the diagnosis and treatment of AD. It also discusses the 
challenges associated with clinical applications and explores the latest 
developments and prospects of nanomedicine for AD.

Microscopic, membranous vesicles known as extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been 
proposed to play a role in the mechanisms underlying central nervous system 
(CNS) diseases. EVs are secreted by a variety of cells, including myeloid, 
endothelial, microglial, oligodendroglial, and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). 
Body fluids such as plasma, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) contain 
microparticles (MPs). The detection of MPs in CSF may indicate genetic or 
environmental susceptibility to conditions such as schizophrenia, 
schizoaffective disorder, and bipolar disorder. MPs of different origins can 
exhibit changes in specific biomarkers at various stages of the disease, aiding 
in the diagnosis and monitoring of neurological conditions. However, 
understanding the role and clinical applications of MPs is complicated by 
challenges such as their isolation and dual roles within the CNS. In this 
review, we discuss the history, characteristics, and roles of MPs in CNS 
diseases. We also provide practical insights for future research and highlight 
the challenges that obscure the therapeutic potential of MPs.

The formation of amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregates in brain is a neuropathological 
hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, there is mounting evidence that 
Aβ also plays a pathogenic role in other types of dementia and that specific 
post-translational Aβ modifications contribute to its pathogenic profile. The 
objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that distinct types of 
dementia are characterized by specific patterns of post-translationally modified 
Aβ variants. We conducted a comparative analysis and quantified Aβ as well as Aβ 
with pyroglutamate (pGlu3-Aβ and pGlu11-Aβ), N-truncation (Aβ(4-X)), 
isoaspartate racemization (isoAsp7-Aβ and isoAsp27-Aβ), phosphorylation 
(pSer8-Aβ and pSer26-Aβ) or nitration (3NTyr10-Aβ) modification in post mortem 
human brain tissue from non-demented control subjects in comparison to tissue 
classified as pre-symptomatic AD (Pre-AD), AD, dementia with Lewy bodies and 
vascular dementia. Aβ modification-specific immunohistochemical labelings of 
brain sections from the posterior superior temporal gyrus were examined by 
machine learning-based segmentation protocols and immunoassay analyses in brain 
tissue after sequential Aβ extraction were carried out. Our findings revealed 
that AD cases displayed the highest concentrations of all Aβ variants followed 
by dementia with Lewy bodies, Pre-AD, vascular dementia and non-demented 
controls. With both analytical methods, we identified the isoAsp7-Aβ variant as 
a highly abundant Aβ form in all clinical conditions, followed by Aβ(4-X), 
pGlu3-Aβ, pGlu11-Aβ and pSer8-Aβ. These Aβ variants were detected in distinct 
plaque types of compact, coarse-grained, cored and diffuse morphologies and, 
with varying frequencies, in cerebral blood vessels. The 3NTyr10-Aβ, pSer26-Aβ 
and isoAsp27-Aβ variants were not found to be present in Aβ plaques but were 
detected intraneuronally. There was a strong positive correlation between 
isoAsp7-Aβ and Thal phase and a moderate negative correlation between isoAsp7-Aβ 
and performance on the Mini Mental State Examination. Furthermore, the abundance 
of all Aβ variants was highest in APOE 3/4 carriers. In aggregation assays, the 
isoAsp7-Aβ, pGlu3-Aβ and pGlu11-Aβ variants showed instant fibril formation 
without lag phase, whereas Aβ(4-X), pSer26-Aβ and isoAsp27-Aβ did not form 
fibrils. We conclude that targeting Aβ post-translational modifications, and in 
particular the highly abundant isoAsp7-Aβ variant, might be considered for 
diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in different types of dementia. Hence, our 
findings might have implications for current antibody-based therapies of AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that occurs with aging. 
Ganoderma lucidum (Curtis.) P. Karst. (G. lucidum) is a traditional medicinal 
fungus believed to nourish the brain and anti-aging. Ganoderic acid A (GAA), a 
triterpenoid from G. lucidum, has demonstrated natural neuroprotective effects. 
This study aims to explore the therapeutic effect and molecular mechanism of GAA 
on AD. Systematic network pharmacology identified 95 targets, 8 biological 
functions, and multiple pathways. The results highlighted MAPK family members as 
core genes, with MAPK1 (ERK2) showing the highest binding affinity to GAA in 
molecular docking. In vitro experiments revealed that GAA dose-dependently 
increased the viability of Aβ25-35-injured HT22 cells and inhibited MAPK 
pathway-related protein expression. Similar to FR180204, 100 µM GAA 
significantly reversed ERK protein expression, oxidative stress markers, and 
mitochondrial damage in AD cell model. GAA also downregulated cleaved caspase-3 
protein levels, apoptosis rates, Aβ and p-Tau expression by inhibiting the ERK 
signaling pathway. The therapeutic effect of GAA on AD was predicted and 
validated through network pharmacology and in vitro experiments. The ability of 
GAA to inhibit apoptosis via the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway positions it as a 
promising candidate for AD treatment.

Neurologic music therapy (NMT) represents a groundbreaking, interdisciplinary 
approach that combines the therapeutic properties of music with neuroscientific 
principles to treat a range of neurological and psychiatric conditions. This 
interdisciplinary approach, increasingly recognized in clinical and research 
settings, leverages advances in neuroimaging to explore how music affects the 
structure and activity of the brain. This review provides an in-depth 
exploration of the multifaceted effects of NMT on brain function, highlighting 
its role in promoting neuroplastic changes and enhancing cognitive, emotional 
and motor functions in diverse patient groups. This review consolidates current 
knowledge on NMT and provides insights into how music affects brain structure 
and function and the mechanisms of action. The article then discusses the 
application and research results of NMT in various diseases such as stroke, 
Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Its potential in personalizing 
therapeutic interventions and its ability to improve treatment access and 
effectiveness in various settings are highlighted.

The revised biomarker framework for diagnosis and staging of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) relies on amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau pathologies as core markers, and 
markers for adjacent pathophysiology, such as neurodegeneration and 
inflammation. Many of the core fluid biomarkers are phosphorylated tau (p-tau) 
fragments, with p-tau217 showing a prominent association with Aβ and tau. While 
positron emission tomography (PET) imaging is well established, plasma p-tau 
assays are newer and likely to reduce the use of expensive, and less accessible 
cerebrospinal fluid and PET imaging tests, thereby promoting wider access to AD 
screening. There is a need for greater understanding of how the various plasma 
p-tau species reflect different pathological processes of AD and how different 
immunoassays perform. This review surveys the available immunoassays and 
highlights their strengths and limitations in different contexts of use. Assays 
need to be standardized to maximize their impact on AD clinical research, and 
patient diagnosis and management. HIGHLIGHTS: Different plasma phosphorylated 
tau (p-tau) species reflect different pathological processes of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), with p-tau231 showing the greatest association with the earliest 
increases in brain amyloid beta (Aβ) accumulation, while p-tau217 shows greater 
association with both brain Aβ and early tau pathology, and other p-tau and tau 
fragment species show greater association with later stages of brain tau 
pathology. Plasma p-tau217 has proven to be an excellent biomarker for AD 
pathology due to its close association with both brain Aβ and tau pathology, as 
well as its large dynamic range. Many different assays with varying performance 
exist for the same p-tau species, with mass spectrometry assays performing 
uniformly well, and several immunoassays achieving comparable performance. 
"Round robin" head-to-head studies have been performed to compare different 
assays for several key plasma biomarkers, including p-tau181 and p-tau217, but 
additional head-to-head studies are needed, especially for new analytes and for 
measuring performance in diverse populations. Plasma immunoassays have the 
potential to increase accessibility of early diagnostic testing for a broad 
population, including diverse historically under-represented and under-served 
populations, due to the potential to be implemented globally, including in 
primary care settings; however, further research is needed to validate the 
optimal cutoffs for each assay for real-world clinical usage. Eventually, 
clinical implementation of a two-step workflow may allow standalone use of 
plasma testing in certain contexts, minimizing the need for confirmation with 
costly and less accessible cerebrospinal fluid/positron emission tomography 
testing.

Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) mostly occur in older demographics. With the 
average lifespan increasing over time, NDDs are becoming one of the major 
adverse factors affecting human health and the quality of life. Currently, there 
are no specific diagnostic methods for NDDs and they are usually diagnosed based 
on nonspecific clinical symptoms and occasionally by biomarkers, such as 
β-amyloid (Aβ) for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and a-synuclein (α-syn) for 
Parkinson's disease, etc. However, it is usually too late for most treatment to 
startr when the aforementioned criteria become detectable. Circular RNAs 
(circRNAs) are a type of single-stranded, covalently closed, non-coding RNAs 
that lack a 5' cap structure and 3' terminal poly-A tail. According to recent 
research, circRNAs may play a crucial role for the onset and progression of some 
NDDs. These small RNAs may be potential diagnostic and prognostic markers and 
therapeutic targets for these diseases. This review will provide a comprehensive 
overview of the recent advancements of knowledge on the functions and the 
possible underlying mechanism of circRNAs in the pathogenesis and treatment of 
NDDs.

Magnolol may have the potential to alleviate the progression of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). The present study was conducted to investigate the broader 
mechanism of action of magnolol in AD pathogenesis. C57BL/6 mice were randomly 
divided into five groups (n=6 mice/group): i) Control; ii) AD model; iii) 5 
mg/kg magnolol + AD model; iv) 10 mg/kg magnolol + AD model; and v) 20 mg/kg 
magnolol + AD model. A total of 7 days after modeling, the treatment groups were 
administered different doses of magnolol (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg) by gavage every 
day, and a Morris water maze test was conducted after 2 months of treatment. The 
impacts of magnolol on amyloid β (Aβ) plaque deposition and neuroinflammation 
were assessed using Congo red and immunofluorescence staining. 
Immunofluorescence staining results were supplemented with western blotting and 
reverse transcription-quantitative PCR to ascertain the role of magnolol in 
other pivotal pathological mechanisms, including the formation of intracellular 
neurofibrillary tangles, compromised synaptic plasticity, and astrocyte and 
microglia activation. Administration of magnolol effectively mitigated cognitive 
impairment, reduced Aβ plaque deposition and inhibited neuroinflammation in 
Aβ1-42-induced mice. Moreover, hippocampal levels of tau, phosphorylated 
(p-)tau, glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), p-GSK3β, synaptophysin, 
brain-derived neurotrophic factor, glial fibrillary acidic protein and ionized 
calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 revealed that magnolol also limited 
neurofibrillary tangle formation, repaired synaptic plasticity, and inhibited 
astrocyte and microglia activation. In conclusion, the present findings broaden 
the current understanding of the mechanisms explaining the neuroprotective 
effects of magnolol against AD progression. Notably, it may inhibit multiple 
manifestations of AD, including plaques and neuroinflammation, while also 
exhibiting the capacity to restore AD-related neurological damage.

AIM: Natural flavonoids have powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory 
activities against neurodegenerative diseases. Fisetin is a powerful flavonoid 
that targets a variety of neurological disorders. Aluminum (Al) has been linked 
to several neurological conditions, such as Parkinsons disease, autism, and 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study was designed to assess the modulatory role 
of fisetin in reversing oxidative stress and neuroinflammation caused by 
Aluminum chloride (AlCl3) induced neurological conditions in rats.
METHODS: Adult male Wistar were randomly divided into eight groups of four 
animals per group. Group 1; the control group received phosphate-buffered 
saline, group 2 received 100 mg/kg/bodyweight of aluminum chloride, and group 
3,4, and 5 received 25, 50, and 75 mg/kg/bodyweight of fisetin respectively for 
21 days. Groups 6, 7, and 8 received 25, 50, and 75 mg/kg/bodyweight of fisetin 
for 14 days followed by 100 mg/kg/bodyweight of aluminum chloride for 7 days 
respectively. The administration was via the oral route. Following treatment, 
the rats were euthanized, and biochemical alterations were observed by measuring 
the serum levels of Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) and Malondialdehyde (MDA) 
for oxidative stress and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) for neuroinflammation. 
Furthermore, histopathological evaluations of the thalamus were carried out 
using routine Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) and Cresyl Fast Violet (CFV) 
techniques while expressions of Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) for 
astrocytes, and Ionized Calcium Binding Adapter Molecule 1 (IBA1) for microglia, 
were examined by immunohistochemical methods.
RESULTS: The findings in the AlCl3 group indicated a rise in lipid peroxidation, 
decreased antioxidant activity, altered thalamic histomorphology, and increased 
expression of GFAP and IBA1 markers for astrocytes and microglia, respectively. 
These effects were mitigated in the Fisetin pretreated groups.
CONCLUSION: These results imply that fisetin can attenuate AlCl3-induced 
neurodegeneration possibly by mitigating oxidative stress and neuroinflammation.

Stepwise identification of prodromal dementia: Testing a practical model for 
primary care.

Boston, Boston, MA, USA.

BACKGROUND: Prodromal dementia is largely underdiagnosed in primary care.
OBJECTIVE: To develop a clinical model for detecting prodromal dementia within 
the operative boundaries of primary care practice.
METHODS: The study employed the Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) and 
Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) to evaluate a "functional-cognitive" 
step-down screening model, in which the MoCA is administered subsequent to 
reported symptoms on the FAQ. It classified participants from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Imaging Initiative to three diagnostic categories: (1) healthy cognition 
(n = 396), (2) mild cognitive impairment without conversion (n = 430), and (3) 
prodromal dementia assessed 24 months before diagnosis (n = 164).
RESULTS: Analyses indicated that the step-down model (Model 1) performed 
significantly better than an alternative model that applied the FAQ as a single 
measure (Model 2) and compared well with another model that administered both 
screening measures to all participants (Model 3). Gradient Boosting Trees 
classifications yielded the following estimations for Model 1/Model 2/ Model 3, 
respectively: Sensitivity = 0.87/0.77/0.89, Specificity = 0.68/0.47/0.70, 
PPV = 0.73/0.40/0.75, NVP = 0.84/0.81/0.87, F1 Score = 0.79/0.52/0.81, 
AUC = 0.78/0.67/0.79.
CONCLUSIONS: These analyses support the proposed model. The study offers 
algorithms for validated measures, which were developed from a well 
characterized clinical sample. Their accuracy will likely improve further with 
new data from diverse clinical settings. These results can serve primary care in 
a timely manner in light of the recent advances in pharmacological treatment of 
dementia and the expected increase in demand for screening.

BACKGROUND: Addressing modifiable risk factors such as physical inactivity and 
social isolation could reduce risk of Alzheimer's disease and all-cause 
dementia, but little is known about which factors individuals are most willing 
to address or how they prefer to address them.
OBJECTIVE: To examine and describe behavior change goals set by participants 
during the Systematic Multi-domain Alzheimer's Risk Reduction Trial (SMARRT).
METHODS: In SMARRT, older adults worked with a health coach and nurse over 2 
years to set incremental, personalized goals to reduce dementia risk. We 
performed quantitative analyses to summarize the numbers of goals per risk 
factor and qualitative content analyses of health coach and nurse notes to 
describe types of goals and useful strategies.
RESULTS: 82 dementia-free adults (70 to 89 years) with at least two dementia 
risk factors participated in the SMARRT intervention arm (mean age, 76 ± 5 
years; 72% women; 11% Black/African American, 4% Asian, 3% Hispanic, 7% another 
non-White race). Participants set a median of 12 health coach goals and 1 nurse 
goals. The risk factors participants chose to work on most frequently were 
physical activity (95%), hypertension (72%), and cognitive activity (60%). 
Participants reported that the most useful strategies included support and 
accountability from the health coach/nurse, setting small goals, and learning to 
manage setbacks.
CONCLUSIONS: When given support, older adults at increased risk for dementia set 
a wide range of goals to reduce dementia risk. A flexible, personalized approach 
that focuses on setting feasible goals and managing setbacks provides a useful 
framework for dementia risk reduction.

Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) can appear not only in 
Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD) but in mild cognitive impairment (MCI). This 
study examined the association of BPSD with caregiver relationship, using the 
Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) score. The cognitive function 
of 419 new outpatients with ADD or MCI was evaluated using the Revised Hasegawa 
Dementia Scale (HDS-R) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Caregiver 
relationship was significantly associated with patient age, sex, duration of 
education, cohabitation status, total NPI-Q score, and number of NPI-Q domains. 
Caregiver (oldest daughter), duration of school education, age, and total HDS-R 
and MMSE scores were significantly associated with NPI-Q total score and number 
of NPI-Q domains. The delusions, dysphoria/depression, irritability/lability, 
and aberrant motor behaviors domains were significantly associated with 
caregiver relationship. The dysphoria/depression and irritability/lability 
domain score were scored significantly higher by female caregivers. The delusion 
domain was significantly associated with cohabitation.

Betanin (BET) has been studied for its therapeutic benefits in various diseases, 
but its low bioavailability and uncertain brain penetration limit its efficacy. 
Accordingly, this study aimed to explore BET-loaded liposomal nanocarriers (LPN) 
as a novel treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD), focusing on the triggering 
receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2)/DNAX-activating protein of 12 kDa 
(DAP12) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) pathways 
implicated in AD. In an AlCl3-induced AD rat model, 48 male Wistar rats were 
divided into four groups: control, AlCl3 (50 mg/kg, intraperitoneal), AlCl3+BET 
(100 mg/kg, per os), and AlCl3+BET LPN (25 mg/kg, intranasally), with treatments 
administered for 28 days. Morris water maze test and histopathological 
examination showed that BET LPN-treated rats had improved spatial and learning 
memory and less hippocampal and cortical degeneration compared with the AlCl3 
and oral BET groups. Mechanistically, BET LPN treatment corrected AD biomarkers, 
increased miR-132 and ADAM10 expression, and reduced oxidative stress, 
inflammation, and apoptosis. Additionally, BET LPN treatment suppressed the 
expression of TREM2, DAP12, ERK1/2, and mitogen-activated protein kinase 1/2 
(MEK1/2), showing greater improvement than oral BET. These findings suggest that 
BET LPN enhances cognitive function and neuroprotection in AD by modulating 
miR-132 and ADAM10 and inhibiting ERK1/2 and TREM2/DAP12 pathways, providing a 
more effective treatment compared with traditional oral BET administration.

Due to the unclear pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the lack of a 
completely cured medication, AD patients need to take medication in order and on 
time every day all one's life, which is difficult for severe memory impairment 
patients to strictly follow on time. Traditional AD drug carriers, such as sugar 
coating and capsules, rely on dissolution or fragmentation to achieve drug 
release, which lacks the interaction between drug molecules and carriers, thus 
they cannot achieve sufficient long-acting and sequential drug release. Herein, 
Mn-MOF-74, which ligand structure is similar to two antioxidants 
dihydroquercetin (DHQ) and resveratrol (Res) is chosen as the carrier. Due to 
the differences in adsorption energy between DHQ/MOF and Res/MOF, the release 
speed of DHQ is much faster than Res. Therefore, Mn-MOF-74 loaded with DHQ and 
Res (DR@MOF) showed sequential drug release and a long-term antioxidant effect 
for ≈72 h, with an efficacy time six times longer than that of vitamin E. In 
5×FAD transgenic mice, DR@MOF exhibited excellent capacity in maintaining 
oxidative balance in the brain, ameliorating spatial learning and memory 
deficits, and showed the potential of an AD agent for long-acting and sequential 
treatment.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is characterized by synapse loss and neurodegeneration, 
which leads to cognitive and psychiatric symptoms. Researchers worldwide have 
been studying therapeutic approaches aiming to induce plasticity and 
neuroprotection once AD has no cure and the existing treatments are limited. 
Environmental Enrichment (EE) is a change in housing conditions that promotes 
increased cognitive stimulus. Studies have demonstrated that EE acts as a 
plasticity modulator in several conditions and experimental models. In this 
review, we analyze and discuss the potential role of EE on plasticity modulation 
in different animal models but primarily on AD models. The data were extracted 
from the PubMed and ScienceDirect databases. The EE was shown to induce 
plasticity. LTP and behavior were enhanced in animals under different 
conditions, such as the AD model. The mechanisms were related to the 
glutamatergic system and excitatory/ inhibitory balance. Moreover, many studies 
have evidenced that EE promotes the upregulation of BDNF and the synaptic 
proteins SYN and PSD95. These data also suggest a neuroprotective function 
performed by EE in different contexts, such as aging and AD. Therefore, an 
enriched environment can be a target of new therapeutic approaches that aim to 
induce neuroplasticity and neuroprotection against AD.

BACKGROUND: Cognitive reserve allows for resilience to neuropathology, 
potentially through active compensation. Here, we examine ex vivo 
electrophysiological evidence for active compensation in Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) focusing on the cholinergic innervation of layer 6 in prefrontal cortex. 
Cholinergic pathways are vulnerable to neuropathology in AD and its preclinical 
models, and their modulation of deep layer prefrontal cortex is essential for 
attention and executive function.
METHODS: We functionally interrogated cholinergic modulation of prefrontal layer 
6 pyramidal neurons in two preclinical models: a compound transgenic AD mouse 
model that permits optogenetically-triggered release of endogenous acetylcholine 
and a transgenic AD rat model that closely recapitulates the human trajectory of 
AD. We then tested the impact of therapeutic interventions to further amplify 
the compensated responses and preserve the typical kinetic profile of 
cholinergic signaling.
RESULTS: In two AD models, we found potentially compensatory upregulation of 
functional cholinergic responses above non-transgenic controls after onset of 
pathology. To identify the locus of this enhanced cholinergic signal, we 
dissected key pre- and post-synaptic components with pharmacological strategies. 
We identified a significant and selective increase in post-synaptic nicotinic 
receptor signalling on prefrontal cortical neurons. To probe the additional 
impact of therapeutic intervention on the adapted circuit, we tested cholinergic 
and nicotinic-selective pro-cognitive treatments. Inhibition of 
acetylcholinesterase further enhanced endogenous cholinergic responses but 
greatly distorted their kinetics. Positive allosteric modulation of nicotinic 
receptors, by contrast, enhanced endogenous cholinergic responses and retained 
their rapid kinetics.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that functional nicotinic upregulation occurs within 
the prefrontal cortex in two AD models. Promisingly, this nicotinic signal can 
be further enhanced while preserving its rapid kinetic signature. Taken 
together, our work suggests that compensatory mechanisms are active within the 
prefrontal cortex that can be harnessed by nicotinic receptor positive 
allosteric modulation, highlighting a new direction for cognitive treatment in 
AD neuropathology.

Psychosis and agitation are among the most distressing neuropsychiatric symptoms 
(NPSs) of Alzheimer's disease (AD), linked to faster disease progression and 
earlier admission to nursing homes. While nonpharmacological treatments may 
alleviate mild behavioral symptoms, more severe syndromes often require 
pharmacological intervention. Brexpiprazole is the only medication approved for 
agitation in AD, although its limited clinical efficacy has raised criticism. No 
drugs have been approved for treating psychosis in AD, highlighting the critical 
need for new, effective, and safe treatments. Recent studies have elucidated 
part of the neurobiological basis of NPSs in the AD brain, offering insights for 
testing repurposed and novel drugs. We conducted a comprehensive nonsystematic 
literature review, aiming to provide a critical overview of both current 
treatments and emerging pharmacological interventions under clinical development 
for treating psychosis and agitation in AD. Additionally, we present strategies 
to optimize the clinical development of new drug candidates. We identify three 
promising compounds that are currently in phase 3 trials: xanomeline-trospium 
for AD psychosis, and dextromethorphan-bupropion and dexmedetomidine for 
agitation in AD. We propose that biomarkers linked to the neuropsychiatric 
traits of AD patients should be identified in dedicated studies and then 
included in phase 2 dose-range-finding studies with novel compounds to establish 
biological engagement. Furthermore, phase 3 placebo-controlled studies should be 
carried out in AD biomarker-confirmed subjects with narrower cognitive 
impairment ranges and precise NPS severity at screening. Alternative study 
designs, such as sequential phase approaches, may also be adopted.

Due to an aging population, Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative 
disorder, has affected more than 40 million people worldwide, a figure predicted 
to significantly increase in the coming decades. Despite much effort to 
understand AD pathogenesis, effective diagnosis and treatment remain a 
challenge. However, the development of liquid biopsy including the analysis of 
cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and methylation thereof has provided an alternative source 
of investigation to further explore the pathophysiology of AD. Herein, we 
discuss the research progress to date and highlight clinical applications of 
methylated cfDNA in AD.

[Post-Stroke Epilepsy and Vascular Dementia].

[Article in Japanese]

Tanaka T(1), Ihara M.

Author information:

Hospital.

Epilepsy and cognitive impairment are major post-stroke complications. As 
society ages, the number of stroke survivors increases, leading to a greater 
interest in these complications. Post-stroke epilepsy accounts for approximately 
half of all epilepsy cases in older adults and is associated with physical 
disability and mortality, emphasizing the importance of controlling seizures. 
Research is progressing on diagnostic methods, primary prevention, and secondary 
prevention of post-stroke epilepsy. Vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease 
are the two major types of dementia and can be prevented and treated by 
addressing vascular risk factors such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and 
diabetes. Currently, there are no available treatments to reverse vascular 
dementia, and many challenges remain unresolved. This review discusses the 
information necessary for clinical practice, including diagnostic criteria, 
classification, risk factors, measurements, and appropriate treatments for 
post-stroke complications.

BACKGROUND: Informal caregivers of persons living with dementia are increasingly 
using mobile health (mHealth) apps to obtain care information. mHealth apps are 
seen as promising tools to better support caregivers' complex and evolving 
information needs. Yet, little is known about the types and quality of dementia 
care information that these apps provide. Is this information for caregivers 
individually tailored; if so, how?
OBJECTIVE: We aim to address the aforementioned gaps in the literature by 
systematically examining the types and quality of care-related information 
provided in publicly available apps for caregivers of persons living with 
dementia as well as app features used to tailor information to caregivers' 
information wants and situations.
METHODS: In September 2023, we used a multistage process to select mobile apps 
for caregivers of persons living with dementia. The final sample included 35 
apps. We assessed (1) types of dementia care information provided in the apps, 
using our 3-item Alzheimer disease and related dementias daily care strategy 
framework, which encompasses educational information, tangible actions, and 
referral information; (2) quality of apps' care information, using the 11 
indicators recommended by the National Library of Medicine; and (3) types of 
tailoring to provide personalization, feedback, and content matching, which are 
common tailoring strategies described in the literature.
RESULTS: Educational information was the most prevalent type of information 
provided (29/35 apps, 83%), followed by information about tangible actions 
(18/35, 51%) and referrals (14/35, 40%). All apps presented their objectives 
clearly and avoided unrealistic or emotional claims. However, few provided 
information to explain whether the app's content was generated or reviewed by 
experts (7/35, 20%) or how its content was selected (4/35, 11%). Further, 6 of 
the 35 (17%) apps implemented 1 type of tailoring; of them, 4 (11%) used content 
matching and the other 2 (6%) used personalization. No app used 2 types of 
tailoring; only 2 (6%) used all 3 types (the third is feedback).
CONCLUSIONS: Existing dementia care apps do not provide sufficient high-quality, 
tailored information for informal caregivers. Caregivers should exercise caution 
when they use dementia care apps for informational support. Future research 
should focus on designing dementia care apps that incorporate quality-assured, 
transparency-enhanced, evidence-based artificial intelligence-enabled mHealth 
solutions for caregivers.

Chesterford, Saffron Walden, Essex CB10 1XL, United Kingdom.

The NLRP3 inflammasome has attracted much interest as a drug target; however, 
many of the first wave of inhibitors were derived from a single aryl 
sulfonylurea starting point. The physicochemical properties of this molecule and 
most derivatives are not amenable to high brain penetration, thus limiting their 
potential effectiveness against disease targets where this is required. The 
disclosure of a novel pyridazine phenol scaffold facilitated a second wave of 
research toward brain-penetrant molecules, which may enable the discovery of 
novel treatments for Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple 
sclerosis and cardiometabolic diseases.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases. 
Its etiology and associated mechanisms are still unclear, which largely hinders 
the development of AD treatment strategies. Many studies have shown that 
dysregulation of energy metabolism in the brain of AD is closely related to 
disease development. Dysregulation of brain energy metabolism in AD brain is 
associated with reduced glucose uptake and utilization, altered insulin 
signaling pathways, and mitochondrial dysfunction. In this study, we summarized 
the relevant pathways and mechanisms regarding the dysregulation of energy 
metabolism in AD. In addition, we highlight the possible role of mitochondrial 
dysfunction as a central role in the AD process. A deeper understanding of the 
relationship between energy metabolism dysregulation and AD may provide new 
insights for understanding learning memory impairment in AD patients and in 
improving AD prevention and treatment.

Implementing New Dementia Care Models in Practice.

Ramanan VK.

Care for patients with Alzheimer disease and related neurodegenerative causes of 
dementia is in the midst of a transformation. Recent advancements in diagnostics 
and therapeutics reflect a rapidly evolving knowledge base and represent 
positive steps for patients and clinicians facing these progressive diseases; 
however, the complexities of emerging biomarkers and treatment options present 
challenges that will require systematic adaptations to routine care to 
facilitate effective incorporation of these options. This article reviews 
ongoing updates in the assessment and management of neurodegenerative causes of 
dementia, focusing on practical models for innovation that practices and health 
care systems can use to implement these new tools. In particular, sustainable 
adaptation in the field will benefit from a comprehensive approach implemented 
at local levels, including (1) education of clinicians and communities to refine 
perceptions about dementia care, (2) multifaceted stakeholder engagement to 
optimize infrastructure and workflows to the new era, and (3) investments in 
personnel to address existing and exacerbated gaps.

Care Partner Burden and Support Services in Dementia.

Polsinelli AJ.

OBJECTIVE: Informal care partners are essential to the care of people living 
with dementia, but they often experience significant burden and receive minimal 
training, support, and resources. This article provides an overview of care 
partner experiences, factors contributing to burden, and methods for reducing 
burden of caregiving in dementia.
LATEST DEVELOPMENTS: The US Department of Health and Human Services National 
Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease and the World Health Organization Global 
Action Plan for dementia have identified support for dementia care partners as a 
top priority for research and policy in recognition of care partners' 
instrumental but underresourced role in dementia care. The psychological, 
financial, social, and physical costs of caregiving, particularly without 
necessary knowledge, skills, and resources, can lead to care partner burden. 
Reassuringly, multicomponent interventions can mitigate burden and other 
negative consequences of caregiving, especially when they are theoretically 
grounded, inclusive, and culturally relevant.
ESSENTIAL POINTS: Health care providers play a vital role in the early 
identification of care partner burden through brief, regular assessments. With 
earlier identification and subsequent intervention (eg, education, skills-based 
training, local and national resources), the experience of burden and negative 
health outcomes can be mitigated and quality of life for people living with 
dementia and their care partners can be improved.

Treatment of Alzheimer Disease.

Geldmacher DS.

OBJECTIVE: Symptom-oriented treatment has been the mainstay of Alzheimer disease 
(AD) pharmacotherapy for decades. This article reviews the evidence basis for 
symptomatic treatments for AD and the emerging data on amyloid-lowering 
therapies with possible disease-slowing effects.
LATEST DEVELOPMENT: Amyloid-lowering monoclonal antibody therapies entered 
clinical use in 2021. In July 2023, lecanemab became the first of these to gain 
full US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval and limited Medicare payment 
coverage. Donanemab gained similar approval status in July 2024. The approved 
agents remove amyloid plaque from the brain and appear to slow clinical disease 
progression but can produce significant adverse events known as amyloid-related 
imaging abnormalities with cerebral edema or effusion and with cerebral 
hemorrhages. Extensive safety monitoring is therefore required, including 
scheduled MRI scans. Also in 2023, brexpiprazole became the first agent 
specifically approved by the FDA for agitation associated with AD. Suvorexant, 
an orexin receptor antagonist, previously was approved for the treatment of 
insomnia in people with mild and moderate AD.
ESSENTIAL POINTS: There is robust evidence for the use of acetylcholinesterase 
inhibitors for patients with mild, moderate, and severe dementia due to AD, 
including outcomes beyond changes in cognitive screening test scores. More 
limited studies support the use of memantine in moderate and severe stages. 
These agents have a primary effect of delaying decline in cognition and function 
and postponing the emergence of adverse behaviors. Pharmacotherapy for 
behavioral and psychological symptoms is less predictable, and most clinical 
trials have had negative results. Anti-amyloid therapies provide the first 
FDA-approved option to alter AD pathology, but an understanding of overall 
utility and value to patients remains in its infancy.

Genetics and Neuropathology of Neurodegenerative Dementias.

Scholz SW, Cobos I.

OBJECTIVE: This article provides an overview of the current understanding of the 
genetic and pathologic features of neurodegenerative dementias, with an emphasis 
on Alzheimer disease and related dementias.
LATEST DEVELOPMENTS: In recent years, there has been substantial progress in 
genetic research, contributing significant knowledge to our understanding of the 
molecular risk factors involved in neurodegenerative dementia syndromes. Several 
genes have been linked to monogenic forms of dementia (eg, APP, PSEN1, PSEN2, 
SNCA, GRN, C9orf72, MAPT) and an even larger number of genetic variants are 
known to influence susceptibility for developing dementia. As anti-amyloid 
therapies for patients with early-stage Alzheimer disease have entered the 
clinical arena, screening for the apolipoprotein E ε4 high-risk allele has come 
into focus, emphasizing the importance of genetic counseling. Similarly, 
advances in the pathologic classifications of neurodegenerative dementia 
syndromes and molecular pathology highlight their heterogeneity and overlapping 
features and provide insights into the pathogenesis of these conditions.
ESSENTIAL POINTS: Recent progress in neurogenetics and molecular pathology has 
improved our understanding of the complex pathogenetic changes associated with 
neurodegenerative dementias, facilitating improved disease modeling, enhanced 
diagnostics, and individualized counseling. The hope is that this knowledge will 
ultimately pave the way for the development of novel therapeutics.

Fluid Biomarkers in Dementia Diagnosis.

Quinn JF, Gray NE.

OBJECTIVE: This article familiarizes neurologists with the currently available 
CSF and plasma biomarkers for the diagnosis of dementia and diagnosis-dependent 
treatment decisions.
LATEST DEVELOPMENTS: For Alzheimer disease, the recent US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) approval of monoclonal antibody therapy has increased the 
urgency of confirming the pathologic diagnosis with biomarkers before initiating 
therapy. The new availability of disease-modifying therapies also highlights the 
need for biomarkers to monitor efficacy over time. Both of these needs have been 
partially addressed by the emergence of improved blood-based biomarkers for 
Alzheimer disease. Regarding other forms of dementia, the latest development is 
a CSF assay for aggregated α-synuclein, which permits the biomarker confirmation 
of synuclein pathology in Lewy body dementia.
ESSENTIAL POINTS: CSF biomarkers for the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease, Lewy 
body dementia, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease are well established. Blood-based 
biomarkers for dementia diagnosis are emerging and rapidly evolving. Sensitivity 
and specificity for diagnosis continue to improve, and they are being 
incorporated into diagnostic decisions. Fluid biomarkers for monitoring the 
efficacy of therapy are not yet established. Because serial CSF examinations are 
impractical, the validation of blood-based biomarkers of disease activity will 
be critical for addressing this unmet need.

Neuroimaging in Dementia.

Risacher SL.

OBJECTIVE: This article captures the current literature regarding the use of 
neuroimaging measures to study neurodegenerative diseases, including early- and 
late-onset Alzheimer disease, vascular cognitive impairment, frontotemporal 
lobar degeneration disorders, dementia with Lewy bodies, and Parkinson disease 
dementia. In particular, the article highlights significant recent changes in 
novel therapeutics now available for the treatment of Alzheimer disease and in 
defining neurodegenerative disease using biological frameworks. Studies 
summarized include those using structural and functional MRI (fMRI) techniques, 
as well as metabolic and molecular emission tomography imaging (ie, positron 
emission tomography [PET] and single-photon emission computerized tomography 
[SPECT]).
LATEST DEVELOPMENTS: Neuroimaging measures are considered essential biomarkers 
for the detection and diagnosis of most neurodegenerative diseases. The recent 
approval of anti-amyloid antibody therapies has highlighted the importance of 
MRI and PET techniques in treatment eligibility and monitoring for associated 
side effects. Given the success of the initial biomarker-based classification 
system for Alzheimer disease (the amyloid, tau, neurodegeneration [A/T/N] 
framework), researchers in vascular cognitive impairment have created similar 
techniques for biomarker-based diagnosis. Further, the A/T/N framework for 
Alzheimer disease has been updated to include several pathologic targets for 
biomarker detection.
ESSENTIAL POINTS: Neurodegenerative diseases have a major health impact on 
millions of patients around the world. Neuroimaging biomarkers are rapidly 
becoming major diagnostic tools for the detection, monitoring, and treatment of 
neurodegenerative diseases. This article educates readers about the current 
literature surrounding the use of neuroimaging tools in neurodegenerative 
diseases along with recent important developments in the field.

Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in Dementia.

Marshall GA.

OBJECTIVE: This article discusses the prevalence, pathophysiology, assessment, 
and management of neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with dementia.
LATEST DEVELOPMENTS: There is a growing body of evidence localizing 
neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia to frontal circuits in the brain, as well 
as relating them to pathologic changes seen in different dementias. Although 
very few medications have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) for the treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia, there are more 
clinical trials showing the benefit of antidepressants, stimulants, and 
antipsychotics. In line with that trend, in 2023, the FDA approved the use of 
brexpiprazole, an atypical antipsychotic, for the treatment of agitation in 
Alzheimer disease dementia.
ESSENTIAL POINTS: Neuropsychiatric symptoms are a core feature of all dementias 
and often emerge before cognitive symptoms manifest. They are highly clinically 
significant symptoms that disrupt the lives of patients and care partners and 
greatly influence the decision to place patients in long-term care facilities. 
The first line of treatment for neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia is 
nonpharmacologic behavioral modification, but clinicians often must supplement 
this intervention with medications using an empiric approach.

Vascular Cognitive Impairment.

Silbert LC.

OBJECTIVE: Vascular cognitive impairment is a major contributor to 
age-associated cognitive decline, both independently and as a contributor to 
mixed dementia syndromes. This article reviews the current understanding of how 
vascular dysfunction contributes to cognitive impairment and dementia risk in 
older individuals and includes updated diagnostic criteria and treatment 
recommendations.
LATEST DEVELOPMENTS: Clinical and research criteria have been evolving to more 
accurately determine the full prevalence of vascular cognitive impairment. The 
Boston Criteria version 2.0 for cerebral amyloid angiopathy now includes 
multiple punctate MRI T2 white matter hyperintensities and MR-visible 
perivascular spaces in addition to previously described T2* hemorrhagic 
signatures. MR-visible perivascular spaces are associated with both vascular 
cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease, potentially linking cerebrovascular 
dysfunction to neurodegenerative disorders through its role in brain waste 
clearance. The American Heart Association's goal for cardiovascular health 
promotion, "Life's Essential 8," has been updated to include sleep health and 
acknowledges psychological well-being and social determinants of health as 
fundamental components necessary to achieve optimal cardiovascular health for 
all adults.
ESSENTIAL POINTS: Vascular cognitive impairment is a common and often 
underrecognized contributor to cognitive impairment in older individuals, with 
heterogeneous etiologies requiring individualized treatment strategies. 
Effective cerebrovascular disease risk factor modification starting in midlife 
is critical to reducing the risk of Alzheimer disease and related dementias, 
with the goal of preventing vascular brain injury and maintaining cognitive 
reserve in the presence of nonvascular age-related brain pathologies.

Frontotemporal Dementia.

Clark DG.

OBJECTIVE: This article discusses frontotemporal dementia (FTD) syndromes using 
a simplified framework of three core syndromes, including details on their 
pathology and unique genetic variations.
LATEST DEVELOPMENTS: FTD includes at least seven major clinical syndromes. The 
three core syndromes are behavioral variant FTD and two forms of progressive 
aphasia, commonly referred to as the nonfluent variant and semantic variant of 
primary progressive aphasia. Clinical features reflect the involvement of major 
functional brain networks. Derangements of three proteins account for nearly all 
underlying pathology for FTD syndromes: transactive response DNA-binding protein 
43 (TDP-43) (approximately 50% of cases), MAPT (45% of cases), and FUS (5% of 
cases). The clinical presentation and imaging provide clues to the underlying 
pathology. FTD is more heritable than Alzheimer disease, with variations in 
C9orf72, MAPT, or GRN (which encodes progranulin) occurring in more than 10% of 
FTD cases.
ESSENTIAL POINTS: The framework described here will provide clinicians with a 
foundation for understanding the complex and heterogeneous set of FTD syndromes. 
There are currently no disease-modifying or US Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA)-approved treatments for FTD, but clinical trials are underway, including 
some targeting presymptomatic genetic variation carriers. Available FTD 
treatments address deficits in behavior or language nonpharmacologically or 
through the off-label use of medications approved for other indications. 
Improvements in biomarkers will accelerate the discovery of new pharmacologic 
treatments.

Atypical Presentations of Alzheimer Disease.

Jones D, Pelak V, Rogalski E.

OBJECTIVE: This article provides a comprehensive review of the distinct features 
of four atypical Alzheimer disease (AD) variants: dysexecutive AD, behavioral 
variant AD, posterior cortical atrophy, and the logopenic variant of primary 
progressive aphasia. It also elucidates their clinical presentations, underlying 
pathophysiologic pathways, diagnostic indicators, and management requirements.
LATEST DEVELOPMENTS: Recent research has revealed that these atypical AD forms 
vary not only in clinical manifestations but in their functional neuroanatomy 
spanning a common pathophysiologic spectrum. Imaging techniques, such as MRI, 
fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), and tau PET, have 
identified distinct abnormalities in specific brain regions associated with each 
variant. This same variability is less tightly coupled to amyloid imaging. 
Emerging diagnostic and therapeutic strategies should be tailored to each 
variant's unique features.
ESSENTIAL POINTS: Atypical forms of AD often present with symptoms that are 
predominantly nonmemory related, distinguishing them from the more common 
memory-centric presentation of the disease. Two distinct clinical and pathologic 
entities, dysexecutive AD and behavioral variant AD, have replaced the outdated 
term frontal AD. Posterior cortical atrophy is another variant that mainly 
affects higher-order visual functions, which can lead to misdiagnoses because of 
its atypical symptom profile. Logopenic primary progressive aphasia is marked by 
difficulties in word retrieval, a challenge that may not be readily apparent if 
the person compensates by using circumlocution. Modern diagnostic techniques, 
such as MRI, PET, and biomarker analysis, have proven crucial for the accurate 
diagnosis and differentiation of these atypical AD variants. In treating these 
forms, it is critical to use tailored therapeutic interventions that combine 
pharmacotherapy with nonpharmacologic strategies to effectively manage the 
disease.

Coactivator-1α Axis: A Promising Target for Parkinson's and Alzheimer's Disease 
Therapies.

One of the key challenges in medical research is developing safe medications to 
treat neurodegenerative disorders. Increased oxidative stress, mitochondrial 
dysfunction, and neuroinflammation are common features of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Silent information regulator 1 (SIRT-1), part 
of the sirtuin family, plays a critical role in various physiological processes 
by binding to histones and nonhistone proteins. SIRT-1 primarily mitigates 
oxidative stress and regulates mitochondrial activity by maintaining the 
deacetylated form of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α 
(PGC-1α), ensuring stable PGC-1α levels. Research has shown reduced 
SIRT-1/PGC-1α expression in AD and PD models. Targeting this pathway presents a 
promising therapeutic approach for managing AD and PD, potentially leading to 
disease-modifying treatments and improved outcomes. This review highlights the 
findings of various studies suggesting that the SIRT-1/PGC-1α pathway promotes 
mitochondrial biogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and cognitive function, as well 
as exerts antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic effects, offering a 
potential method for AD and PD treatment.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative 
disease, and timely and effective diagnosis is essential for the prevention and 
treatment of AD. Peripheral blood is readily available, inexpensive, and 
non-invasive, making it an ideal substrate for screening diagnostic biomarkers.
METHOD: The Notch signaling pathway is closely related to AD, so genes related 
to the Notch signaling pathway may be candidate diagnostic biomarkers for AD. 
Here, we have performed an integrated analysis of peripheral blood cells 
transcriptomics from two AD cohorts (GSE63060: Ctrl = 104, MCI = 80, AD = 145; 
GSE63061: Ctrl = 134, MCI = 109, AD = 139) to reveal the expression levels of 16 
Notch signals involving 100 genes.
RESULT: The results have shown the changes in Notch signaling-related genes to 
be highly consistent in both AD cohorts. Bioinformatics analysis has found 
Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) related to Notch signaling to mainly play 
important roles in Alzheimer's disease, the Notch signaling pathway, and the 
C-type lectin receptor signaling pathway. Multiple machine learning analyses 
have revealed IKBKB, HDAC2, and PIK3R1 to exhibit good diagnostic value in both 
AD cohorts and that they may be ideal biomarkers for early diagnosis of AD.
CONCLUSION: This study has provided a comprehensive description of the molecular 
signatures of the Notch signaling pathway in AD peripheral blood and a potential 
diagnostic model for AD clinical screening.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is estimated to affect over 55 million people across 
the world. Small molecule treatment options are limited to symptom management 
with no impact on disease progression. The need for new protein targets and 
small molecule hit compounds is unmet and urgent. Hydroxysteroid 17-β 
dehydrogenase type 10 (17β-HSD10) is a mitochondrial enzyme known to bind 
amyloid beta, a hallmark of AD, and potentiate its toxicity to neurons. 
Identification of small molecules capable of interacting with 17β-HSD10 may 
drive drug discovery efforts for AD. The screening compound BCC0100281 (1), was 
previously identified as an inhibitor of 17β-HSD10. Herein we report the first 
synthetic access to the hit compound following a convergent pathway starting 
from simple heterocyclic building blocks. The compound was found to be toxic to 
'neuron-like' cells, specifically those of neuroblastoma origin, providing a 
potential hit compound for cancer drug discovery, wherein the protein is known 
to be overexpressed. However, assay of synthetic intermediates identified novel 
scaffolds with effect to rescue amyloid beta-induced cytotoxicity, showcasing 
the power of organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry to optimize hit 
compounds.

Dementia and Alzheimer's disease are common occurrences in the population, 
affecting many patients. Recent research and studies have found a link between 
oral biofilm and the initiation of these conditions or the worsening of their 
presentation. Periodontal disease and the associated oral biofilm with its 
bacteria are often not considered by the medical community when treating these 
or their patients. Coordination of therapy with a dentist can improve the 
patient's oral health. Decreasing bacteria in the oral biofilm allows the 
physician and dentist to provide coordinated total healthcare. Emphasis and 
education of the patient on the importance of maintaining good oral homecare and 
routine dental recall prophylaxis appointments to improve their systemic health 
and limit the progression and worsening of mental health conditions. This 
article discusses the connection between oral biofilm and systemic health, 
specifically Alzheimer's disease, and how to improve those conditions through 
oral healthcare.

Bioinformatics and Machine Learning-Based Identification of Critical Biomarkers 
and Immune Infiltration in Venous Thromboembolism.

Li Y(1), Deng H(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Vascular Surgery, Fu Xing Hospital, Capital Medical University 
(FXH-CMU), Beijing 100038, China.

Objective: This study aims to use bioinformatics and machine learning algorithms 
to screen and analyze the key genes involved in venous thromboembolism (VTE) and 
explore the relationship between these biomarkers and immune cell infiltration. 
Methods: The gene expression profile with the identifier GSE19151 was downloaded 
from the GEO database. Differential expression analysis using the limma package 
was conducted to identify genes that were differentially expressed between VTE 
and normal samples. Biological activities of these genes were then investigated 
through GO analysis utilizing the R language package. KEGG and GSEA were also 
performed to identify key signaling pathways. Furthermore, machine learning 
techniques were employed to determine hub gene signatures related to VTE, and 
ROC curves were used to validate the findings. To compare the immune 
infiltration of healthy and VTE samples, single sample gene set enrichment 
analysis (ssGSEA) was applied. Lastly, the Spearman correlation coefficient was 
used to assess the relationship between the expression of hub genes and immune 
cell infiltration. Results: A total of 628 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) 
were discovered between the VTE samples and normal samples. GO analysis 
identified protein polyubiquitination, lysosomal lumen acidification, organellar 
ribosome, mitochondrial ribosome, ammonium transmembrane transporter activity, 
and immunoglobulin binding as the processes with the highest abundance of DEGs. 
KEGG pathway analysis revealed that DEGs were enriched in ribosome, COVID-19, 
viral infection, oxidative phosphorylation, Parkinson's disease, nonalcoholic 
fatty liver disease, apoptosis, and cancer. The most prominent KEGG pathways 
associated with VTE were ribosome, Parkinson's disease, oxidative 
phosphorylation, Alzheimer's disease, and Huntington's disease according to GSEA 
findings. DLST and LSP1 were identified as hub gene signatures in VTE by machine 
learning integrative analysis, and ROC curves confirmed their diagnostic value. 
Results from ssGSEA indicated a significant difference in the degree of immune 
cell infiltration between VTE and normal samples, with the expression of DLST 
and LSP1 positively correlated with the content of some immune cells. The R 
package, code, and analysis results used in this paper are available on 
https://github.com/doctorlaby/my-project. Conclusion: Our research is the first 
to utilize machine learning techniques in identifying DLST and LSP1 as 
significant biomarkers of VTE. With our findings, we have uncovered new insights 
into the underlying causes of VTE and potential treatments for affected 
patients.

Distinct Patterns of Socioemotional Dysfunction Relate to Aggressive Versus 
Nonaggressive Rule-breaking Antisocial Behaviors in Behavioral Variant 
Frontotemporal Dementia.

Tennessee.

BACKGROUND: Antisocial behaviors occur in up to 91% of individuals with 
behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). Prior work has shown that 
antisocial behaviors can be differentiated into aggressive and nonaggressive 
rule-breaking behavioral subtypes. Socioemotional dysfunction is common in bvFTD 
and unique compared to other types of dementia.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether socioemotional dysfunction relates to general 
antisocial behaviors in individuals with bvFTD, or whether different types of 
socioemotional dysfunction relate to aggressive versus rule-breaking behaviors.
METHODS: Informants for 28 participants with bvFTD and 21 participants with 
Alzheimer disease (AD) completed the Social Behavior Questionnaire (SBQ) and the 
Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI). The SBQ measures the presence and severity 
of 26 antisocial behaviors, including subscales for aggressive behaviors 
(SBQ-AGG) and nonaggressive rule-breaking behaviors (SBQ-RB). The IRI measures 
cognitive and emotional empathy capabilities, including subscales for Empathic 
Concern (IRI-EC) and Perspective-taking (IRI-PT).
RESULTS: As expected, participants with bvFTD had higher scores on the SBQ in 
total than participants with AD, as well as on the SBQ-AGG and SBQ-RB 
separately. Participants with bvFTD had lower scores on the IRI-EC and IRI-PT 
than participants with AD (P < 0.0001 for all measures). Lower scores on the 
IRI-PT correlated with higher scores on the SBQ-AGG-but not with higher scores 
on the SBQ-RB-across the combined group of participants (P = 0.007), and within 
participants in the bvFTD group (P = 0.01) specifically, after controlling for 
covariates of age, sex, dementia severity, and IRI-EC scores. Lower scores on 
the IRI-EC correlated with higher scores on the SBQ-AGG-but not with higher 
scores on the SBQ-RB-across the combined group of participants (P = 0.02) after 
controlling for covariates of age, sex, dementia severity, and IRI-PT scores.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that socioemotional dysfunction relates to 
antisocial behaviors in individuals with bvFTD, but that the mechanisms leading 
to aggressive and rule-breaking behaviors are differentiable, providing 
meaningful implications for distinct approaches to treatment and prevention.

BACKGROUND: Adults with Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease related 
dementias (ADRD) or frailty are susceptible to fractures. Opioid analgesics are 
frequently prescribed after fractures. Documenting post-fracture opioid 
discontinuation rates and predictors of discontinuation among adults with ADRD 
or frailty can inform clinical practice, identify potential disparities, and 
improve pain management guidelines. The objective of this paper was to 
investigate opioid discontinuation in opioid-naïve older adults who used opioids 
after an acute fracture.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included opioid-naïve Medicare 
fee-for-service beneficiaries (N = 33,027) ≥65 years of age who filled an opioid 
prescription within 30 days of a vertebral, lower extremity, or upper extremity 
fracture from 2013 to 2018. Beneficiaries were classified according to ADRD 
(yes/no) and frailty (yes/no) status using validated claims-based algorithms. 
The primary outcome was opioid discontinuation, defined as a 30-day supply gap. 
We estimated discontinuation rates with the Kaplan-Meier method and identified 
predictors of opioid discontinuation using Cox proportional hazards regression.
RESULTS: The 30-day opioid discontinuation rate was similar among non-frail 
beneficiaries without ADRD (81% [95% CI, 80%-81%]) and those who were non-frail 
with ADRD (83% [81%-84%]). Comparatively, 30-day discontinuation rates were 
lower among those with frailty and ADRD (76% [75%-77%]) and those with frailty 
alone (77% [75%-78%]). After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, 
health status, healthcare utilization, and calendar year, beneficiaries with 
both ADRD and frailty (HR, 0.90 [0.87-0.93]) and those with frailty alone (HR, 
0.85 [0.82-0.89]), but not those with ADRD alone (HR, 1.06 [1.01-1.10]), were 
less likely to discontinue opioids compared with those without ADRD or frailty.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our findings suggest that frailty, but not ADRD, was 
associated with a lower likelihood of opioid discontinuation among older adults 
who initiated opioids after an acute fracture. Further research is needed to 
understand how opioid deprescribing practices depend on patient and provider 
preferences.

BACKGROUND: A digital adaptation of the nine-hole peg test (9HPT) was developed 
with the potential to provide novel disability features for patients with 
multiple sclerosis (PwMS).
OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to evaluate the 9HPT features based on 
reliability, prognosis, and discrimination between treatment groups.
METHODS: The MS partners Advancing Technology and Health Solutions (MS PATHS) 
cohort data were used to derive new features including completion time and 
speed. Association and reliability between features and clinical outcomes were 
tested by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) with repeated measures. The 
added prognostic value of the features for a clinically meaningful decline was 
assessed by time-to-event analyses with likelihood ratio tests. The estimated 
effect size between treatment efficacy groups was acquired from linear 
mixed-effects models. Sample size was calculated for a hypothetical randomized 
clinical trial.
RESULTS: For the 10,843 PwMS, speed and completion time were associated with MS 
disability. Compared with time, speed showed higher reliability (ICC = 0.78 vs 
0.74), added benefits in predicting disability worsening (p < 0.001), better 
discrimination between high- and low-efficacy groups (effect size: 0.035 vs 
0.015), and an 18% reduction in required sample size for a 1-year clinical 
trial.
CONCLUSION: Integrating horizontal hand distances traveled over the 9HPT 
pegboard can be a more reliable measure of hand function.

BACKGROUND: People with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) carry a 
substantial risk of developing dementia compared to non-amnestic MCI (naMCI). 
Several previous studies proved the remarkable effectiveness of acupuncture for 
MCI, but they didn't distinguish between aMCI and naMCI. We conducted this 
meta-analysis to systematically assess the evidence of the efficacy of 
acupuncture in this unique population with aMCI.
METHODS: We comprehensively searched nine databases on January 09, 2024, to 
identify relevant articles estimating the effects of acupuncture for aMCI, and 
then assessed the risk of bias of the included trials utilizing the RoB 2.0 tool 
which included the domain of randomization process, deviation from intended 
interventions, missing outcome data, measurement of the outcome, selection of 
the reported outcome, and overall bias. The results of this meta-analysis were 
exhibited with forest plots. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to determine 
the robustness of the pooled results, and publication bias was estimated by 
Egger's and Begg's tests. Besides, we also performed subgroup analysis to 
determine whether there was a difference in therapeutic effects between four 
weeks and eight weeks of treatment duration. The certainty of the evidence was 
graded using GRADEpro GDT.
RESULTS: A total of 15 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 908 people 
with aMCI were included in this study. According to the meta-analysis, 
acupuncture treatment provided a remarkable improvement in cognitive function as 
assessed by Mini-Mental State Examination (MD = 1.09, 95 %CI [0.86, 1.31], 
p < 0.00001), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MD = 0.93, 95 %CI [0.80, 1.07], 
p < 0.00001), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (MD = 1.00, 95 %CI 
[-1.23, -0.77], p < 0.00001), and P300 latency (MD = -15.40, 95 %CI [-23.68, 
-7.12], p = 0.0003). Subgroup analysis showed evidence that the efficacy of four 
weeks of acupuncture treatment was consistent with that of eight weeks. 
Sensitivity analyses, Egger's and Begg's tests suggested the pooled results were 
robust and reliable. The overall quality of the evidence, as appraised by the 
GRADE criteria, was very low or low for all outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: The evidence from 15 RCTs demonstrated that acupuncture 
interventions are effective in ameliorating cognitive function in people with 
aMCI. There is a need for larger-scale multicenter RCTs using standardised 
training protocols and more rigorous designs to confirm the conclusions further.

Persistent reactive oxygen species (ROS) and neuroinflammation contribute to the 
onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases, underscoring the need for 
targeted therapeutic strategies to mitigate these effects. Extracellular 
vesicles (EVs) show promise in drug delivery due to their biocompatibility, 
ability to cross biological barriers, and specific interactions with cell and 
tissue receptors. In this study, we demonstrated that human plasma-derived EVs 
(pEVs) exhibit higher brain-targeting specificity, while adipose-derived 
mesenchymal stem cells EVs (ADMSC-EVs) offer regenerative and immunomodulatory 
properties. We further investigated the potential of these EVs as therapeutic 
carriers for brain-targeted drug delivery, using Donepezil (DNZ) as the model 
drug. DNZ, a cholinesterase inhibitor commonly used for Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), also has neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties. The size of EVs 
used ranged from 50 to 300 nm with a surface charge below -30 mV. Both 
formulations showed rapid cellular internalization, without toxicity, and the 
ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in a zebrafish model. The have 
analyzed the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant actions of pEVs-DNZ and 
ADMSC-EVs-DNZ in the presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). ADMSC-EVs 
significantly reduced the inflammatory mediators released by HMC3 microglial 
cells while treatment with pEVs-DNZ and ADMSC-EVs-DNZ lowered both phagocytic 
activity and ROS levels in these cells. In vivo experiments using zebrafish 
larvae revealed that both EV formulations reduced microglial proliferation and 
exhibited antioxidant effects. Overall, this study highlights the potential of 
EVs loaded with DNZ as a novel approach for treating neuroinflammation 
underlying various neurodegenerative diseases.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD), and related dementias, represent a growing concern for 
the worldwide population given the increased numbers of people of advanced age. 
Marked by significant degradation of neurological tissues and critical 
processes, in addition to more specific factors such as the presence of amyloid 
plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in AD, robust discussion is ongoing 
regarding the precise mechanisms by which these diseases arise. One of the major 
interests in recent years has been the contribution of reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) and, particularly, the contribution of the ROS-generating NADPH Oxidase 
proteins. NADPH Oxidase 2 (NOX2), the prototypical member of the family, 
represents a particularly interesting target for study given its close 
association with vascular and inflammatory processes in all tissues, including 
the brain, and the association of these processes with AD development and 
progression. In this review, we discuss the most relevant and recent work 
regarding the contribution of NOX2 to AD progression in neuronal, microglial, 
and cerebrovascular signaling. Furthermore, we will discuss the most promising 
NOX2-targeted therapeutics for potential AD management and treatment.

56. Health System Readiness for Disease-Modifying Therapies for Alzheimer
Disease:  Health Systems [Internet].

Ottawa (ON): Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health; 2024 Dec. 
Report No.: CM0003.
CADTH Health Technology Review.

WHAT IS THE ISSUE? • Alzheimer disease (AD) is a chronic neurologic degenerative 
disease and 1 of the most common causes of dementia. It affected an estimated 
368,200 people in Canada in 2020. • Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a 
clinical condition involving memory loss that can progress to dementia and is 
often due to underlying AD. It was estimated to affect around 917,000 people in 
Canada aged 60 and older in 2020., • Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) are 
being developed that target underlying pathologic processes of AD to slow 
disease progression, unlike contemporary treatments that focus on managing 
symptoms. A prominent target of these therapies is amyloid-beta, a protein known 
to contribute to amyloid plaques. Many of the anti–amyloid-beta DMTs are 
intended for people with early-stage AD, which includes MCI and mild dementia 
due to AD. • At least 7 countries have approved a therapy from this treatment 
class, and, at the time of writing, 2 therapies are undergoing regulatory review 
by Health Canada and reimbursement review by Canada's Drug Agency (CDA-AMC). • 
DMTs demand more frequent health care visits and higher use of medical imaging 
for safe treatment and monitoring. This would greatly impact current care 
pathways for early-stage AD, necessitating an examination of health system 
readiness in Canada.
WHAT DID CDA-AMC DO? • CDA-AMC sought to examine health system readiness in 
Canada and care pathways for early-stage patients with AD in preparation for the 
potential use of these anti–amyloid-beta DMTs in Canada. • CDA-AMC reviewed 
publicly available data and literature about health systems and AD treatment 
pathways for improving dementia care to prepare for the possible introduction of 
DMTs in health systems in Canada.
WHAT DID CDA-AMC FIND? • CDA-AMC found that, if DMTs were approved by Health 
Canada and provincial and territorial drug plans, a new model of care for AD in 
Canada would be necessary. The new care pathway would require: o.. earlier 
screening and diagnosis, at the MCI or mild dementia stages of AD; o.. guidance 
for optimal use of diagnostic imaging and biomarker-based tests, as well as an 
increase in equitable access to PET-CT units for amyloid PET exams or 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing to assess treatment eligibility; o.. increased 
capacity to administer IV infusions; o.. guidance for optimal use of MRI to 
avoid overuse and increase equitable access to MRI to monitor individuals 
through treatment; o.. a combination of reliable and validated methods and tools 
for evaluating cognitive decline in diverse populations, including Indigenous 
Peoples and racialized groups, presenting with cognitive symptoms or undergoing 
treatment; o.. clear criteria for discontinuing treatment. • CDA-AMC found that 
assessment and diagnosis of early-stage AD and timely access to DMTs could be 
delayed due to: o.. a lack of education and awareness of symptoms of early-stage 
AD among the general public and care providers, as well as cultural barriers, 
including a fear of stigma or cultural perceptions of the condition; o.. 
staffing shortages in care providers capable of assessing and treating dementia 
and other supporting staff, including primary care providers (PCPs), dementia 
specialists, nurses, imaging staff, and social care providers; o.. limited 
capacity of medical imaging (e.g., PET-CT and MRI) and laboratory services 
(i.e., CSF analysis) to confirm early-stage AD and treatment eligibility and to 
monitor drug response and disease progression. • A variety of new technologies 
are in development, including new AD biomarker testing methods, that may 
alleviate some capacity concerns in dementia detection, treatment eligibility 
screening, treatment administration, and patient monitoring. • Alternative DMTs 
that target other AD pathologic processes are also in development.
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN? • There may be challenges in providing equitable and timely 
access to DMTs for AD, given the geographic distribution of the population 
(especially in rural and remote locations), cultural barriers, and lack of 
awareness of the condition in the population in Canada. • Not all individuals 
with mild dementia due to early-stage AD or MCI who are eligible for treatment 
may have timely access to screening and diagnosis, which could prevent them from 
receiving DMTs. • Additionally, an increased number of individuals — some of 
whom may not be eligible for DMTs — may be motivated to seek screening, leading 
to higher demand and potential delays in the screening process. • Health system 
decision-makers may want to consider system-wide adaptations to enhance 
screening and care for individuals with suspected early-stage AD, given the 
projected rise in AD prevalence, which is expected to exceed 1.1 million people 
by 2050. This may include: o.. adding more health and social care staff; o.. 
providing enhanced training to effectively assess and diagnose early-stage AD; 
o.. improving access to diagnostic imaging to screen and monitor patients using 
anti–amyloid-beta DMTs.

With increasing age comes the inevitable decline in proteostasis, where 
chaperone and co-chaperone activity becomes imbalanced. These changes lead to 
global disturbances and pathogenic rewiring of the chaperone system into 
epichaperones consisting of protein networks that are ultimately dysfunctional. 
Such imbalances in proteostasis may favor mechanisms that can lead to 
neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Consequently, there has 
been an increase in research activity toward finding small molecules that can 
re-balance the chaperone and co-chaperone machinery to counter the effects of 
disease resulting from old age. The Hsp90 co-chaperone FKBP51 has recently been 
identified as a protein whose induction not only increases with age but is 
elevated further in AD cells. Significantly, FKBP51 plays a role in the 
Hsp90-dependent isomerization of tau, which in turn influences its 
phosphorylation and susceptibility to aggregation. We hypothesize that FKBP51 is 
a major player that is able to elicit tauopathy in response to amyloid-beta 
senile plaques that damage the brain. We propose that elevated FKBP51 levels 
result in an abnormal FKBP51-Hsp90 activity that alters the normal processing of 
tau, which manifests as hyperphosphorylation and oligomerization of tau. Thus, 
the Hsp90-FKBP51 complex is emerging as a drug target against AD. In support of 
this idea, the structure of the FKBP51-Hsp90 complex was recently described, 
and significantly, the small-molecule dihydropyridine LA1011 was shown to be 
able to disrupt the Hsp90-FKBP51 complex. LA1011 was previously shown to 
effectively prevent neurodegeneration in the APPxPS1 AD transgenic mouse model. 
This review looks at the role of Hsp90 and its co-chaperones in AD with a focus 
on FKBP51.

INTRODUCTION: Establishing a solid resident knowledge of multiple sclerosis (MS) 
during neurology residency is crucial for independent clinical practice. We 
created a case-based and interactive educational workshop on MS with the aim of 
improving neurology resident clinical and theoretical knowledge of various 
aspects of MS diagnosis and care.
METHODS: MS neurologists from the University of North Carolina (UNC) School of 
Medicine designed a 4-hour in-person case-based interactive educational workshop 
for all neurology residents. Covered topics included: MS definition, 
epidemiology, pathogenesis, risk factors, MS clinical course/disease phenotypes, 
MS diagnostic criteria and differential diagnosis, acute MS attack treatment, 
symptomatic therapy, disease modifying therapy. Case-based and knowledge-based 
questions with multiple-choice questions were utilized using interactive online 
polls that residents participated in during the workshop. Additionally, a 
10-question pre- and post-workshop test was administered and the change in exam 
results was analyzed using paired t-tests. Descriptive statistics were used in 
the analysis of percentile rank changes in Residency In-Service Training 
Examination (RITE) exam scores by UNC Neurology residents 2022 - 2023 (pre-MS 
Workshop) and 2023-2024 (post- MS Workshop).
RESULTS: A total of 21 residents completed the workshop and pre- and 
post-workshop exam. Pre-workshop scores (mean, 6.14/10; standard deviation [SD], 
1.20; range, 4-9) and post-workshop test scores (mean, 8.67/10; SD, 0.97; range, 
7-10) were compared. There was a mean improvement of 2.52 points between pre- 
and post-workshop test results (t-ratio 8.97 [95% confidence interval 
1.94-3.11]; p<.0001). Percentile rank on RITE exam scores by UNC Neurology 
residents (postgraduate years 2-4) after attending MS Workshop improved by 
136.8% compared with the prior academic year when the traditional virtual 
didactic program on MS was conducted.
CONCLUSION: Interactive workshops for residents can improve resident education 
on MS, creating a solid basis for future continuing education activities in the 
rapidly developing field of MS with a goal of improving patient outcomes. 
Residency programs may consider incorporating interactive, case-based MS 
workshops into their educational curricula.

INTRODUCTION: Patients with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) 
undergoing colorectal surgery have suboptimal postoperative outcomes, but the 
specific adverse outcomes and the context of these worse outcomes on a national 
level are not well understood.
METHODS: Colorectal surgery patients with and without ADRD from January 1, 2017, 
to October 1, 2018, were identified using traditional, fee-for-service Medicare 
claims data. Unadjusted and adjusted analyses were performed to evaluate 
postoperative outcomes.
RESULTS: 123,324 Medicare beneficiaries (mean age 76.5, 59.3% female) underwent 
colorectal surgery in the study cohort with 8.3% (n = 10,254) having a 
preoperative diagnosis of ADRD. Colorectal surgery patients with ADRD were older 
(81 versus 76 y old, P < 0.001), frail (42.8% versus 13.6%, P < 0.001), and had 
more comorbidities (Elixhauser Score 19.6 versus 13.9, P < 0.001) compared with 
those without an ADRD diagnosis. Patients with ADRD more often had open surgery 
(75.2% versus 65.7%, P < 0.001) and emergency surgery (65.1% versus 37.8%, 
P < 0.001). Unadjusted and adjusted analyses demonstrated that patients with 
ADRD have an increased risk of in-hospital, 30-d, and 90-day mortality, as well 
as postoperative complications. Patients with ADRD required more healthcare 
resources after colorectal surgery including increased length of stay (7 versus 
5 days), discharge to a higher level of care (60.8% versus 25.8%, P < 0.001), 
and discharge to a facility (54.0% versus 23.8%, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: For patients undergoing colorectal surgery, the diagnosis of ADRD 
is an independent risk factor for adverse postoperative outcomes and results in 
increased healthcare resource utilization both in hospital and after discharge.

Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia and accounts for the 
largest proportion of dementia cases. The amyloid cascade hypothesis is known 
for the pathogenesis of AD, in which excessive accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) 
leads to the formation of senile plaques and ultimately to AD. Inhibition of 
β-secretase (BACE1) may contribute to the treatment of AD by suppressing Aβ 
production. In this study, we isolated and characterized the activity of new and 
known BACE1-inhibiting compounds from two mushrooms of the Boletales order, 
Suillus bovinus and Boletinus cavipes, using a BACE1-inhibitory activity-guided 
separation approach. Three compounds (1-3) were isolated from Suillus bovinus 
CHCl3 extract and three compounds (4-6) were isolated from Boletinus cavipes 
CHCl3 extract. Compound 1 was a new compound. The structures were elucidated 
using MS, IR, and NMR. Compounds 1-6 showed BACE1-inhibitory activity (IC50; 
21.2, 17.8, 1.0, 1.6, 23.7, and 22.8 μM, respectively). To examine the 
structure-activity relationship, we also evaluated the activity of 
geranylgerniol, farnesol, 2,5-dihydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone and mesaconic acid. 
These compounds showed no activity, and these results indicate that chain 
terpenes alone do not show BACE1-inhibitory activity, but only when mesaconic 
acid or a quinone with a hydroxyl group is bound. In addition, the mode of 
inhibition of 2 and 3 were competitive and 4 was uncompetitive inhibition, 
respectively, as determined by analysis of Lineweaver-Burk and Dixon plots.

Biomarker Core major activities from October 2004 to March 2024, including 
biobanking ADNI cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), plasma, and serum biofluid samples, 
biofluid analyses for Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers in the Biomarker Core 
and various non-ADNI laboratories, and continuous assessments of pre-analytics.
RESULTS: Validated immunoassay and mass spectrometry-based assays were performed 
in CSF with a shift to plasma, a more accessible biofluid, as qualified assays 
became available. Performance comparisons across different CSF and plasma AD 
biomarker measurement platforms have enriched substantially the ADNI participant 
database enabling method performance determinations for AD pathology detection 
and longitudinal assessments of disease progression.
DISCUSSION: Close collaboration with academic and industrial partners in the 
validation and implementation of AD biomarkers for early detection of disease 
pathology in treatment trials and ultimately in clinical practice is a key 
factor for the success of the work done in the Biomarker Core.
HIGHLIGHTS: Describe ADNI Biomarker Core biobanking and sample distribution from 
2007 to 2024. Discuss validated mass spectrometry and immunoassay methods for 
ADNI biofluid analyses. Review collaborations with academic and industrial 
partners to detect AD and progression. Discuss major challenges, and progress to 
date, for co-pathology detection. Implementation in the ATN scheme: co-pathology 
and modeling disease progression.

INTRODUCTION: Heterozygous mutations in the progranulin gene (GRN) leading to 
decreased progranulin levels are one of the most frequent causes of inherited 
frontotemporal dementia (FTD). We evaluated progranulin levels in dried blood 
spots from capillary finger-stick collection (DBScapillary).
METHODS: Paired venous Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) plasma and 
DBScapillary samples were collected from each participant with or without 
pathogenic GRN mutations.
RESULTS: DBScapillary progranulin levels in GRN mutation carriers (mean [SD] 
age, 55 [13] years; n = 16) were reduced compared to non-mutation carriers (64 
[11] years; n = 44) (2.38 ng/mL [1.0] vs 4.37 [0.68] ng/mL; U = 42; p < 0.0001, 
ROC AUC = 0.94 [95% CI: 0.83 to 1.00]) and highly associated with venous plasma 
levels (R = 0.819; p < 0.001).
DISCUSSION: Progranulin levels can be accurately determined from finger-stick 
blood samples. This can enable regular and remote monitoring of this protein in 
FTD therapeutic trials and potentially serve as a first-level screening test for 
GRN mutations.
HIGHLIGHTS: Progranulin levels measured using capillary dried blood spots were 
significantly reduced in GRN mutation carriers compared to non-mutation 
carriers. Progranulin levels measured using capillary dried blood spots strongly 
correlated with levels from venous EDTA plasma. DBScapillary progranulin levels 
were able to identify GRN mutation carriers with high accuracy. DBScapillary 
might allow repeated measurements of progranulin levels in a remote and 
unsupervised setting, circumventing the restrictions of traditional venous blood 
collection. DBScapillary might be used to assess the biological efficacy of 
disease-modifying therapies in clinical trials aiming to increase baseline 
progranulin levels or as a first-level screening for GRN mutations in primary 
settings.

Recent years have seen significant advances in diagnostic testing of central 
nervous system (CNS) function and disease. However, there remain challenges in 
developing a comprehensive suite of non- or minimally invasive assays of neural 
health and disease progression. Due to the direct connection with the CNS, 
structural changes in the neural retina, retinal vasculature and morphological 
changes in retinal immune cells can occur in parallel with disease conditions in 
the brain. The retina can also, uniquely, be assessed directly and 
non-invasively. For these reasons, the retina may prove to be an important 
"window" for revealing and understanding brain disease. In this review, we 
discuss the gross anatomy of the eye, focusing on the sensory and non-sensory 
cells of the retina, especially microglia, that lend themselves to diagnosing 
brain disease by imaging the retina. We include a history of ocular imaging to 
describe the different imaging approaches undertaken in the past and outline 
current and emerging technologies including retinal autofluorescence imaging, 
Raman spectroscopy, and artificial intelligence image analysis. These new 
technologies show promising potential for retinal imaging to be used as a tool 
for the diagnosis of brain disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and others and 
the assessment of treatment success.

A thermoregulatory decline occurs with age due to changes in muscle mass, 
vasoconstriction, and metabolism that lowers core body temperature (Tc). 
Although lower Tc is a biomarker of successful aging, we have previously shown 
this worsens cognitive performance in the APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). We hypothesized that elevating Tc with thermotherapy would improve 
metabolism and cognition in APP/PS1 mice. From 6-12 months of age, male and 
female APP/PS1 and C57BL/6 mice were chronically housed at 23 or 30°C. At 12 
months of age, mice were assayed for insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, and 
spatial cognition. Plasma, hippocampal, and peripheral (adipose, hepatic, and 
skeletal muscle) samples were procured postmortem and tissue-specific markers of 
amyloid accumulation, metabolism, and inflammation were assayed. Chronic 30°C 
exposure increased Tc in all groups except female APP/PS1 mice. All mice 
receiving thermotherapy had either improved glucose tolerance or insulin 
sensitivity, but the underlying processes responsible for these effects varied 
across sexes. In males, glucose regulation was influenced predominantly by 
hormonal signaling in plasma and skeletal muscle glucose transporter 4 
expression, whereas in females, this was modulated at the tissue level. 
Thermotherapy improved spatial navigation in male C57BL/6 and APP/PS1 mice, with 
the later attributed to reduced hippocampal soluble amyloid-β (Aβ)42. Female 
APP/PS1 mice exhibited worse spatial memory recall after chronic thermotherapy. 
Together, the data highlights the metabolic benefits of passive thermotherapy, 
but future studies are needed to determine therapeutic benefits for those with 
AD.

Cognitive aging has become a public health concern as the mean age of the 
population is ever-increasing. It is a naturalistic and common process of 
degenerative and compensatory changes that may result in neurocognitive 
disorders. While heterogeneous, cognitive aging mostly affects executive 
functions that may be associated with functional losses during activities of 
daily living. Cognition-oriented treatments like cognitive training and 
transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) have garnered considerable 
attention in the past few decades while the exact picture regarding their 
efficacy in healthy older adults has not been determined yet. The present paper 
aimed to evaluate the effects of a 3-month intervention of tDCS over the 
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) with multimodal cognitive training on the 
Stroop test and Trail Making Tests A and B performance. One hundred and 
ninety-three healthy older adults from 2 sites were administered repeated 
sessions of active/sham tDCS with cognitive training. Baseline, 
post-intervention, and 1-year performance results between groups were compared 
using multiple linear regressions. Active tDCS resulted in better Stroop test 
performance at post-intervention (p = 0.033) but not at 1-year follow-up while 
no differences between groups were observed in Trail Making Tests A & B 
performance. The present results may correspond to a modest improvement in 
conflict monitoring, potentially due to modulation of prefrontal regions, 
without changing shifting performance. Further investigation is warranted to 
draw an interference regarding the subdomain-specific impact of repeated tDCS 
with multimodal cognitive training on executive functions.

Light-based gamma entrainment using sensory stimuli (GENUS) shows considerable 
potential for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in both animal and human 
models. While the clinical efficacy of GENUS for AD is paramount, its 
effectiveness will eventually also rely on the barrier to treatment adherence 
imposed by the discomfort of gazing at luminance flickering (LF) light. 
Currently, there have been few attempts to improve the comfort of GENUS. Here we 
investigate if Invisible spectral flicker (ISF), a novel type of light-based 
40 Hz GENUS for which the flicker is almost imperceptible, can be used as a more 
comfortable option. We found that whereas ISF, LF, and chromatic flicker (CF) 
all produce a 40 Hz steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP), ISF scores 
significantly better on measures of comfort and perceived flicker. We also 
demonstrate that, while there is a trend towards a lower SSVEP response, 
reducing the stimulation brightness has no significant effect on the 40 Hz SSVEP 
or perceived flicker, though it significantly improves comfort. Finally, there 
is a slight decrease in the 40 Hz SSVEP response when stimulating with ISF from 
increasingly peripheral angles. This may ease the discomfort of GENUS treatment 
by freeing patients from gazing directly at the light.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. The two major 
hallmarks of this disease are extracellular amyloid plaques and intracellular 
neurofibrillary tangles in the brain, accompanied by loss of neurons and 
synapses. The plaques and tangles mainly consist of amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau 
protein, respectively. Most of the therapeutic strategies for AD to date have 
focused on Aβ. However, there is still no effective therapy available. In recent 
years, the clinical therapeutic failure of targeting Aβ pathology has resulted 
in increased interest towards tau-based therapeutics. In the current review, we 
focus on the research progress regarding the pathological mechanisms of tau 
protein in this disease and discuss tau-targeting therapeutic strategies.

Better knowledge of the molecular actors governing sequential amyloid precursor 
protein (APP) proteolysis is crucial to endorse novel therapies aimed to delay 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. ADAM17 (A Disintegrin and 
Metalloproteinase 17) is a type-I transmembrane protease involved in the 
non-amyloidogenic processing of APP that contributes to the maintenance of 
synaptic functions. In this work, we analyzed the 5'-flanking region and first 
intron of ADAM17 gene employing an in silico analysis. This strategy evidenced 
two regions which concentrate the binding sites of diverse transcription 
factor-families, including members of the b-ZIP small MAF, NRF2 and BACH1 
proteins. Then, we found that the natural isothiocyanate 6-MSITC (6 
methylsulfinyl hexyl isothiocyanate) increased both mRNA and protein levels of 
ADAM17 in an NRF2-dependent manner. In line, SH-SY5Y neurons released higher 
levels of the soluble APPα peptide as a result of ADAM17 activation. Overall, 
our study identifies inducible expression of ADAM17, and consequently protease 
activity, by NRF2.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia and 
neurodegenerative disease characterized by neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and 
amyloid plaque. Familial AD is caused by mutations in the APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 
genes and these mutations result in the early onset of the disease. Sporadic AD 
usually affects older adults over the age of 65 years and is, therefore 
classified as late-onset AD (LOAD). Several risk factors associated with LOAD 
including the APOE gene have been identified. Moreover, GWAS studies have 
identified a wide array of genes and polymorphisms that are associated with LOAD 
risk. Currently, the diagnosis of AD involves the evaluation of memory and 
personality changes, cognitive impairment, and medical and family history to 
rule out other diseases. Laboratory tests to assess the biomarkers in the body 
fluids as well as MRI, CT, and PET scans to analyze the presence of plaques and 
NFTs are also included in the diagnosis of AD. It is important to diagnose AD 
before the onset of clinical symptoms, i.e. during the preclinical stage, to 
delay the progression and for better management of the disease. Research has 
been conducted to identify biomarkers of AD in the CSF, serum, saliva, and urine 
during the preclinical stage. Current research has identified several biomarkers 
and potential biomarkers in the body fluids that enhance diagnostic accuracy. 
Aside from genetics, other factors such as diet, physical activity, and 
lifestyle factors may influence the risk of developing AD. Clinical trials are 
underway to find potential biomarkers, diagnostic measures, and treatments for 
AD mainly in the preclinical stage. This review provides an overview of the 
genes and biomarkers of AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by extracellular amyloid plaques and neuronal Tau tangles. A 
recent study found that the APOE3 Christchurch (APOECh) variant could delay AD 
progression. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, 
we established neuron-microglia co-cultures and neuroimmune organoids using 
isogenic APOE3 and APOECh microglia derived from human induced pluripotent stem 
cells (hiPSCs) with PSEN1 mutant neurons or brain organoids. We show that APOECh 
microglia are resistant to Aβ-induced lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis and 
therefore preserve the phagocytic activity and promote pTau clearance, providing 
mechanistic insights into the neuroprotective role of APOE3Ch microglia. 
Moreover, we show that an APOE mimetic peptide can mimic the protective effects 
of APOECh microglia. These findings demonstrate that the APOECh microglia plays 
a causal role in microglial neuroprotection, which can be exploited for 
therapeutic development for AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the main cause of dementia. Aβ-mediated 
neuroinflammation plays a crucial role in the development of AD. Curculiginis 
Rhizoma and Epimedii Folium, frequently used in combination for their 
synergistic effects, have shown promise for cognitive improvement and 
anti-inflammatory properties in previous studies. This study, for the first 
time, investigates the pharmacokinetic profile of seven key compounds in the 
aqueous extract of Curculiginis Rhizoma and Epimedii Folium (CREF) in both 
normal and Aβ1-42-treated rats. A validated high-performance liquid 
chromatography-tandem triple quadrupole mass (HPLC-QQQ-MS) method was used to 
simultaneously quantify curculigoside, orcinol glucoside, icariin, epimedin B/C, 
baohuoside I, and magnoflorine in rat plasma. Results revealed significant 
increases in AUC0-∞ and Cmax values for curculigoside, orcinol glucoside, 
epimedin B, icariin, and magnoflorine in Aβ1-42-treated rats compared to normal 
rats, accompanied by decreased plasma clearance (CL). These findings suggest 
that the pathological condition induced by Aβ1-42 significantly affects the 
pharmacokinetic characteristics of components in CREF, potentially leading to 
increased bioavailability in a cognitive impairment model. This discovery 
provides a novel perspective for exploring the mechanism of CREF's therapeutic 
effects on cognitive impairment.

The number of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is expected to increase as 
the population ages. The amyloid cascade hypothesis is proposed as the 
pathogenic mechanism of AD. We report the isolation and structural determination 
of three new p-terphenyl compounds, thelephantin P (1), thelephantin Q (2), and 
thelephantin R (3), with four known compounds (4-7), from the fruiting bodies of 
Thelephora aurantiotincta Corner. We evaluated Aβ aggregation and BACE1 
inhibitory activities and neuroprotective activities of these isolated 
compounds. Compound 1 was shown to be multi-inhibitors for AD. Compound 1 had an 
IC50 = 12.9 μM (Aβ), 6.3 μM (BACE1), and EC50 = 8.0 μM (neuroprotection), 
respectively. Therefore, these compounds are potential therapeutic agents for 
AD.

Quinoa is a versatile, nutrient-dense, gluten-free pseudocereal, increasingly 
recognized for its potential health benefits, particularly in managing diabetes 
mellitus and Alzheimer's disease-two conditions with growing links. Recent 
research on 14 quinoa genotypes explored fatty oil composition and bioactive 
potential of quinoa extracts. Linoleic acid was predominant fatty acid 
(46.60%-56.33%), whereas alanine was the most concentrated amino acid across all 
active extracts (192.4887-1578.0355 nmol/mL). French Vanilla hexane extract 
exhibited the strongest α-glucosidase inhibition (75.71%), with Santa Ana hexane 
extract showing the highest α-amylase inhibition (28.58%). Additionally, 
Titicaca hexane extract displayed notable acetylcholinesterase inhibition 
(22.22%), and Moqu Arochilla methanol extract had the most potent 
butyrylcholinesterase inhibition (47.20%). Antioxidant assays revealed that 
Salcedo and French Vanilla extracts had exceptional 
1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity, with positive 
correlations found between total phenolic content and antioxidant activity 
(DPPH, β-carotene, FRAP). These findings emphasize quinoa's potential as a 
functional food, offering significant benefits for disease management.

Memantine hydrochloride, a non-competitive antagonist of NMDA-type glutamate 
receptors, is known to suppress the progression of symptoms in Alzheimer's 
disease. Possessing a characteristic adamantane skeleton as its core structure 
and an amino group at the bridgehead position, memantine was synthesized 
starting from acenaphthene. The synthesis involved nucleus hydrogenation of 
acenaphthene to perhydroacenaphthene, skeletal rearrangement of 
perhydroacenaphthene, nitration of 1,3-dimethyladamantane, and reduction of the 
nitro groups to an amino group. In each step, continuous flow reactions were 
investigated to achieve continuous manufacturing of memantine.

Alzheimer's disease, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder marked by 
cognitive decline, affects millions worldwide. The presence of amyloid plaques 
and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain is the key pathological feature, 
leading to neuronal dysfunction and cell death. Current treatment options 
include pharmacological approaches such as cholinesterase inhibitors, as well as 
non-pharmacological strategies like cognitive training and lifestyle 
modifications. Recently, the potential role of probiotics, particularly strains, 
such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, in managing neurodegenerative 
diseases through the gut-brain axis has garnered significant attention. 
Probiotics can modulate inflammation, produce neurotransmitters, and support 
neuronal health, potentially slowing disease progression and alleviating 
symptoms, such as stress and anxiety. Optimizing the pharmacotherapeutic effects 
of probiotics is critical and involves advanced formulation techniques, such as 
microencapsulation and nanoencapsulation. Microencapsulation employs natural or 
synthetic polymers to protect probiotic cells, enhancing their viability and 
stability against environmental stressors. Methods like extrusion, emulsion, and 
spray-drying are used to create microcapsules suited for various applications. 
Nanoencapsulation, on the other hand, operates at the nanoscale, utilizing 
polymeric or lipid-based nanoparticles to improve the bioavailability and shelf 
life of probiotics. Techniques, such as nanoprecipitation and emulsification, 
are employed to ensure stable nanocapsule formation, thereby augmenting the 
therapeutic potential of probiotics as nutraceutical agents. This study delves 
into the essential formulation aspects of microencapsulation and 
nanoencapsulation for beneficial probiotic strains, aimed at managing 
Alzheimer's disease by optimizing the gut-brain axis. The insights gained from 
these advanced techniques promise to enhance probiotic delivery efficacy, 
potentially leading to improved health outcomes for patients suffering from 
neurodegenerative disorders.

Biomarker-only diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease: Not ready for prime time.

Castellani RJ(1).

Author information:

Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.

The Alzheimer's Association Workgroup research criteria for diagnosis and 
staging of Alzheimer's disease hypothesize diagnostic meaning in the absence of 
clinical symptoms. If operationalized, this would trivialize neuropsychological 
assessment but would also expand the pool of candidates for anti-amyloid 
therapies. A recent survey of the reactions of clinical neuropsychologists to 
these criteria suggested that the purpose lacked clarity, among other concerns. 
Given the current landscape in Alzheimer's disease therapeutics, with 
substantial toxicity and unclear benefit, as well as the poorly understood 
relationships between biomarkers and clinical signs at the individual level, the 
roll out of biomarker-only disease seems premature.

BACKGROUND: Over 90% of individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) may not 
receive a timely diagnosis. Understanding community-based practice patterns, 
where most individuals are seen, is critical to improving patient care.
OBJECTIVE: To understand how patients with MCI and mild dementia due to 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) are diagnosed and managed in community-based settings, 
including the use of clinical and cognitive assessments, referrals to 
dementia-related specialties, and receipt of treatment.
METHODS: This observational study recruited community-based primary care 
physicians (PCPs) (N = 177) and neurologists (N = 147) in August-September 2023, 
through a verified physician panel with broad geographic representation across 
the US. Physicians abstracted medical chart data from patients diagnosed with 
MCI or mild AD within the previous two years. Data collected included use of 
neurocognitive assessments, biomarker and structural imagine tests, referrals, 
and treatments. Descriptive statistics were used.
RESULTS: Medical records for 817 MCI and 467 mild AD patients were abstracted. 
The mean age was 70.2 years, 56.4% were female, and 67.2% were White. Symptoms 
were commonly reported by a family member (67.2%). Nearly 1 in 6 patients did 
not receive any neurocognitive assessments (16.1%), and nearly 1 in 4 did not 
receive a structural imaging or AD-specific biomarker test (23.7%). AD-specific 
biomarker tests were more common among patients aged ≥65 (87.1% versus 75.3%; 
p < 0.05). Less than 1 in 4 patients were referred for cognitive/behavioral 
concerns.
CONCLUSIONS: As the diagnostic and treatment landscape changes, education on 
symptom recognition, and physician training on new technologies may facilitate 
timely diagnoses and improve patient outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Amyloid-β proteins, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, are believed 
to play an adaptive role in the cerebral immune response.
OBJECTIVE: Amyloid is believed to play a role in cerebral immune response and 
could play a similar role in response to air pollution exposures. In the present 
study, we examined whether WTC exposure duration was associated with cerebral 
amyloidosis in WTC responders.
METHODS: WTC responders (aged 44-65 years) who varied in exposure duration but 
did not use personalized protective equipment were assessed using 
positron-emission tomography with [18F]-Florbetaben. The outcome was the 
cortical [18F]-Florbetaben burden, measured using regional standardized uptake 
value ratios (SUVRs) in 34 Desikan-Killiany regions of interest. Spearman's ρ 
and generalized linear models were used to estimate correlations between WTC 
exposure duration and cortical [18F]-Florbetaben SUVR. Cognitive and behavioral 
symptoms were measured. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure cortical 
thickness and diffusivity.
RESULTS: The mean age of imaged responders was 56 years old. WTC exposure 
duration was associated with olfactory [18F]-Florbetaben SUVR (Spearman's 
ρ = 0.43, p = 0.011), which was in turn associated with elevated 
[18F]-Florbetaben SUVR in ventral regions (ρ = 0.41, p = 0.016). Cortical 
[18F]-Florbetaben in ventral regions was associated with reduced response speed 
(ρ = -0.72, p < 0.001), was co-located with cortical diffusivity across regions 
in the parietal and frontal lobes and reduced cortical thickness in the isthmus 
cingulate (ρ = -0.53, p = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Low-grade amyloidosis in the olfactory and frontal lobes was 
associated with WTC exposure duration. Future work should examine whether 
low-grade amyloidosis is correlated with the location or distribution of 
neurofibrillary tangles in WTC responders.

BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is highly prevalent among older adults 
and has been associated with cognitive decline and dementia risk. The 
suitability of screening tools for detecting OSA in memory clinic settings is 
unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the utility and validity of the STOP-Bang questionnaire 
(SBQ) and pulse oximeter as a screening tool, compared to gold-standard 
polysomnography (PSG) in older adults attending a memory clinic.
METHODS: Participants aged over 50 with new onset cognitive/mood concerns 
attended a memory clinic, then completed the SBQ, oximetry, and PSG. The SBQ and 
oximetry's accuracy in detecting moderate-severe and severe OSA was evaluated 
using receiver operating curves. Intraclass correlation and Bland-Altman plots 
compared the oximeter's adjusted oxygen desaturation index (ODI-Ox) and PSG's 
apnea-hypopnea index (AHI-PSG).
RESULTS: Of 194 participants (mean age = 65.6, 64 males) who completed PSG, 184 
completed the SBQ, and 138 completed oximetry. SBQ demonstrated limited 
performance for moderate-severe OSA (sensitivity = 52%, specificity = 62%, 
AUC = 0.600) and severe OSA (sensitivity = 18%, specificity = 87%, AUC = 0.577). 
Oximetry was satisfactory for moderate-severe OSA (sensitivity = 67%, 
specificity = 73%, AUC = 0.769) and severe OSA (sensitivity = 50%, 
specificity = 88%, AUC = 0.730). The diagnostic performance was improved with 
new cut-offs at ODI-Ox ≥ 11 for AHI-PSG ≥ 15 and ODI-Ox ≥ 20 for AHI-PSG ≥ 30. 
Bland-Altman plots and intraclass correlation indicated acceptable agreement for 
oximetry.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that while the SBQ may be unsuitable to detect 
moderate or severe OSA for older adults with cognitive impairment, oximetry may 
be a viable screening tool. Given OSA treatment can optimize sleep and may slow 
cognitive decline, routine screening for OSA should be part of memory clinic 
assessments.

BACKGROUND: Apathy in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with 
significant morbidity and is often one of the first neuropsychiatric symptoms to 
present in mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Apathy is associated with 
accelerated cognitive decline and atrophy in fronto-striatal regions of the 
brain. Previous work has shown a link between apathy and the APOE gene in the 
context of AD, as the APOE ε4 allele is already known to be associated with the 
onset of AD. However, other genetic associations with apathy are largely 
unexplored.
OBJECTIVE: To examine whether interactions between genetic variants related to 
neurotransmitter systems and regional brain atrophy are associated with apathy 
in patients with MCI and AD.
METHODS: In a sample of individuals with AD (n = 266), MCI (n = 518), and 
cognitively normal controls (n = 378), a partial least squares correspondence 
analysis modeled interactions between single nucleotide polymorphisms, 
structural whole-brain imaging variables, and apathy.
RESULTS: An interaction was found between apathy, the possession of an APOE ε4 
allele combined with minor homozygosity for the DAT1 (dopamine transporter 1) 
gene, and regional brain atrophy. This interaction was closely linked to the MCI 
and AD groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The results point to an association of a dopaminergic genetic 
marker and apathy in the AD continuum and may inform future design of clinical 
trials of apathy, as well as new treatment targets.

BACKGROUND: Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) promotes neurogenesis, cell 
survival, and glial function, making it a promising candidate therapy in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD).
OBJECTIVE: Long arginine 3-IGF-1 (LR3-IGF-1) is a potent IGF-1 analogue. We 
sought to determine whether intranasal (IN) LR3 treatment would delay cognitive 
decline and pathology in 5XFAD mice.
METHODS: Wildtype and 5XFAD male mice were treated for 7 months (3-10 months of 
age), with IN LR3-IGF-1 or IN Vehicle (Veh) (n = 19-27 mice/group). Behavior, 
memory, and brain imaging were assessed at 8-9 months of age and tissues 
collected at 10 months. A comprehensive amyloid-β (Aβ) profile and other 
pathologic features were conducted and supportive in vitro stimulation studies 
in BV-2 microglial cells were also performed.
RESULTS: In male 5XFAD mice, IN LR3-IGF-1 treatment improved body composition, 
but did not significantly alter cognitive symptoms, as assessed by multiple 
assays. In cortex, LR3 treatment improved some facets of pathology, including a 
reduction in filamentous plaques, and increase in inert plaques, corresponding 
with a reduction in low molecular weight Aβ oligomers. In vitro, uptake of 
Aβ1-42 peptide by BV2 cells was enhanced by LR3-IGF-1, which was also found to 
promote gene pathways implicated in actin remodeling and endocytosis.
CONCLUSIONS: LR3 promotes favorable effects on Aβ plaque remodeling in cortex of 
male 5XFAD mice but fails to preserve aspects of behavior or memory. While these 
data do not support LR3 as a monotherapy per se, they do warrant further 
investigation into its potential for combinatorial formulations aimed at 
targeting the complexity of AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) presents a complex pathological landscape, posing 
challenges to current therapeutic strategies that primarily target amyloid-β 
(Aβ). Using a novel integrative pathway activity analysis (IPAA), we identified 
83 dysregulated pathways common between both post-mortem AD brains and 
three-dimensional AD cellular models showing robust Aβ42 accumulation. p38 
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was the most upregulated common pathway. 
Active p38 MAPK levels increased in the cellular models, human brains, and 5XFAD 
mice and selectively localized to presynaptic dystrophic neurites. Unbiased 
phosphoproteomics confirmed increased phosphorylation of p38 MAPK substrates. 
Downstream activation of MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2) plays a crucial 
role in Aβ42-p38 MAPK-mediated tau pathology. Therapeutic targeting of the p38 
MAPK-MK2 axis with selective inhibitors significantly reduced Aβ42-driven tau 
pathology and neuronal loss. IPAA prioritizes the best models to derisk 
target-drug discovery by integrating human tissue gene expression with 
functional readouts from cellular models, enabling the identification and 
validation of high-confidence AD therapeutic targets.

Transmembrane B cell lymphoma 2-associated X protein inhibitor motif-containing 
(TMBIM) 6, also known as Bax Inhibitor-1 (BI-1), has been heavily researched for 
its cytoprotective functions. TMBIM6 functional diversity includes modulating 
cell survival, stress, metabolism, cytoskeletal dynamics, organelle function, 
regulating cytosolic acidification, calcium, and reactive oxygen species (ROS). 
Clinical research shows TMBIM6 plays a key role in many of the world's top 
diseases/injuries (i.e., Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, diabetes, obesity, brain 
injury, liver disease, heart disease, aging, etc.), including cancer, where 
TMBIM6 expression impacts patient survival, chemoresistance, cancer progression, 
and metastasis. We show TMBIM6 is activated by, and undergoes, different 
conformational changes that dictate its function following a significant change 
in the cell's IntraCellular Environment (ICE). TMBIM6 agonism, following ICE 
change, can help the cell overcome multiple stresses including toxin exposure, 
viral infection, wound healing, and excitotoxicity. However, in cancer cells 
TMBIM6 agonism results in rapid paraptotic induction irrespective of the cancer 
type, sub-type, genotype or phenotype. Furthermore, the level of TMBIM6 
expression in cancer did not dictate the level of paraptotic induction; however, 
it did dictate the rate at which paraptosis occurred. TMBIM6 agonism did not 
induce paraptosis in cancer via canonical routes involving p38 MAPK, JNK, ERK, 
UPR, autophagy, proteasomes, or Caspase-9. Instead, TMBIM6 agonism in cancer 
upregulates cytosolic Ca2+ and ROS, activates lysosome biogenesis, and induces 
paraptosis via ERAD II mechanisms. In xenograft models, we show TMBIM6 agonism 
induces rapid cancer cell death with no toxicity, even at high doses of TMBIM6 
agonist (>450 mg/kg). In summary, this study shows TMBIM6's functional diversity 
is only activated by severe ICE change in diseased/injured cells, highlighting 
its transformative potential as a therapeutic target across various diseases and 
injuries, including cancer.

Exon skipping technologies enable exclusion of targeted exons from mature mRNA 
transcripts, which have broad applications in medicine and biotechnology. 
Existing techniques including antisense oligonucleotides, targetable nucleases, 
and base editors, while effective for specific applications, remain hindered by 
transient effects, genotoxicity, and inconsistent exon skipping. To overcome 
these limitations, here we develop SPLICER, a toolbox of next-generation base 
editors containing near-PAMless Cas9 nickase variants fused to adenosine or 
cytosine deaminases for the simultaneous editing of splice acceptor (SA) and 
splice donor (SD) sequences. Synchronized SA and SD editing improves exon 
skipping, reduces aberrant splicing, and enables skipping of exons refractory to 
single splice site editing. To demonstrate the therapeutic potential of SPLICER, 
we target APP exon 17, which encodes amino acids that are cleaved to form Aβ 
plaques in Alzheimer's disease. SPLICER reduces the formation of Aβ42 peptides 
in vitro and enables efficient exon skipping in a mouse model of 
Alzheimer's disease. Overall, SPLICER is a widely applicable and efficient exon 
skipping toolbox.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) stands out as the foremost prevalent neurodegenerative 
disorder, characterized by a complex etiology. Various mechanisms have been 
proposed to elucidate its onset, encompassing amyloid-beta (Aβ) toxicity, tau 
hyperphosphorylation, oxidative stress and reactive gliosis. The hallmark of AD 
comprises Aβ and tau aggregation. These misfolded protein aggregates trigger the 
activation of glial cells, primarily microglia. Microglial cells serve as a 
major source of inflammatory mediators and their cytotoxic activation has been 
implicated in various aspects of AD pathology. Activated microglia can adopt M1 
or M2 phenotypes, where M1 promotes inflammation by increasing pro-inflammatory 
cytokines and M2 suppresses inflammation by boosting anti-inflammatory factors. 
Overexpressed pro-inflammatory cytokines include interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and 
tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in adjacent brain regions. Furthermore, 
microglial signaling pathways dysregulated in AD are myeloid differentiation 
primary-response protein 88 (Myd 88), colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor 
(CSF1R) and dedicator of cytokinesis 2 (DOCK2), which alter the physiology. 
Despite numerous findings, the causative role of microglia-mediated 
neuroinflammation in AD remains elusive. This review concisely explores cellular 
and molecular mechanisms of activated microglia and their correlation with AD 
pathogenesis. Additionally, it highlights promising therapeutics targeting 
microglia modulation, currently undergoing preclinical and clinical studies, for 
developing effective treatment for AD.

INTRODUCTION: The factors that influence the progression of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) after individuals become amyloid-positive are poorly understood. This study 
examines how sex influences the longitudinal trajectories of plasma AD and 
neurodegenerative biomarkers in the years following a person's estimated onset 
of amyloid-β.
METHODS: Linear mixed-effects modeling investigated overall and sex-specific 
longitudinal trajectories of plasma biomarkers, brain volumes, and cognition 
relative to the estimated age of amyloid onset in a cohort of 78 
amyloid-positive Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) participants 
(n = 45 male; follow-up time: 6.8 years [SD 3.31]). Amyloid status was 
ascertained with 11C-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET imaging.
RESULTS: After amyloid onset, men displayed steeper increases in pTau181, 
pTau231, and neurofilament light (NfL) compared to women. In this same period, 
men demonstrated steeper declines in brain volume and cognitive performance.
DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that sex influences the trajectory of AD 
pathology, neuronal injury, and symptom progression after individuals become 
amyloid-positive.
HIGHLIGHTS: Steeper rates of increase in pTau and GFAP among amyloid-positive 
individuals. After amyloid onset, steeper increases in pTau and NfL 
concentrations in men than in women. Steeper declines in brain volume and 
cognition in men corroborate biomarker results.

INTRODUCTION: Dementia is one of the leading causes of disability among older 
people aged 60 years and above, with majority eventually being diagnosed with 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Pharmacological agents approved for dementia include 
acetylcholinesterase enzyme (AChE) inhibitors like rivastigmine, donepezil and 
galantamine and the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist memantine, 
prescribed as monotherapy or in combination with each other, depending on the 
severity of disease. There is currently no available study demonstrating the 
clinical response to these drugs for AD in the Filipino population. Hence, this 
protocol aims to characterise the clinical, genetic, microbial and metabolic 
factors associated with drug responses to donepezil, rivastigmine and/or 
memantine for AD in a cohort of Filipinos with late-onset AD.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This protocol involves a multisite descriptive study that 
will use two study designs: (1) a descriptive, cross-sectional study to 
characterise the clinical profile of Filipino dementia patients with AD and (2) 
an exploratory prospective cohort study to investigate drug response-related 
genetic, gut microbiome and metabolome signatures of a subset of the recruited 
AD patients. At least 153 patients with mild or moderate AD aged 65 years old 
and above will be recruited regardless of their treatment status. A subset of 
these patients (n=60) who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria will be included 
further in the exploratory cohort study. These patients will be grouped 
according to their baseline medications and will be observed for treatment 
response in 6 months. The cognitive, functional and behavioural domains of 
patients and levels of functioning will be measured using different assessment 
tools. Drug responses of Filipino patients will then be investigated employing 
multi-omics technology to characterise genetic variations via whole exome 
sequencing, gut microbiome profile via shotgun metagenomic sequencing and 
metabolome profile via liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has received ethical clearance from the 
Department of Health Single Joint Research Ethics Board (SJREB-2022-15). Results 
of psychometric scales will be made available to enrolled patients. The study 
results will be presented at national/international conferences and published in 
international peer-reviewed scientific journals, and summaries of the results 
will be provided to the study funders and institutional review boards of the 
three tertiary referral hospitals.

We investigated the inhibitory effects of 32 antidepressants on 
[3H]N-methylscopolamine ([3H]NMS)-specific binding in the mouse cerebral 
neocortex to determine which antidepressants should be recommended for patients 
with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Of those tested, nine antidepressants (10-4 M) 
exhibited less inhibitory effect on [3H]NMS-specific binding (<35%): tianeptine 
(a tricyclic); trazodone (a serotonin 5-HT2A blocker); sulpiride (a dopamine D2 
blocker); fluvoxamine (a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (RI)); 
milnacipran, levomilnacipran, venlafaxine, and desvenlafaxine (serotonin and 
noradrenaline RIs); and bupropion (a noradrenaline and dopamine RI). Therefore, 
these antidepressants show little anticholinergic effect in the brain and are 
recommended for use in patients with AD.

Neuroinflammation is closely related to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). One of its prominent cellular components, microglia, is a potent 
coordinator of neuroinflammation in interplay with the characteristic AD 
pathological alterations including Aβ, tau, and neuronal defects, which 
constitute the AD-unique extracellular microenvironment. Mounting evidence 
implicates Triggering Receptors Expressed on Myeloid Cells 2 (TREM2) in the 
center of microglial activation, a vital event in the pathogenesis of AD. TREM2 
is a pivotal microglial receptor that interacts with specific elements present 
in the AD microenvironment and induces microglial intracellular signallings 
contributing to phagocytosis, migration, cytokine production, metabolism, and 
survival, which shapes the microglial activation profile. It follows that TREM2 
builds up a bridge between microglia and the extracellular microenvironment. 
This review illustrates how TREM2 modulates microglia to affect AD pathogenesis. 
Mainly presented facets in the review are i. the development of AD-specific 
microglial phenotypes (disease-associated microglia, DAM), ii. microglial 
interactions with major AD pathologies, and iii. the underlying intracellular 
signallings of microglial activation. Also, outstanding controversies regarding 
the nature of neuroinflammation are discussed. Through our illustration, we 
attempt to establish a TREM2-centered network of AD pathogenesis, in the hope as 
well to provide insights into the potential therapeutic strategies based on the 
underlying mechanisms.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), a demonstrativeness disease with insidious onset, has 
become an important public health problem worldwide and is the fifth leading 
cause of death in the world. Boschniakia rossica (BR) has been used to treat 
age-related diseases, especially AD in China for centuries, but the material 
basis and mechanism are unclear. Here, we investigated the effective components 
and the mechanism of BR in the treatment of AD. The therapeutic effect of BR was 
verified through pathological and behavioral studies of AD rat model. BR can 
significantly increase the number of nerve cells in the hippocampus and improve 
the study and memory ability of AD rats. Subsequently, the active composition 
and the potential targets of BR were explored by UPLC-Q-Orbitrap-HRMS and 
network pharmacology. Ursolic acid, baicalein, and salicylic acid were the 
potential pharmacodynamic components acted on the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 
(PI3 K)/protein kinase B (AKT) pathway, which was verified by further molecular 
docking and molecular dynamics simulations. The in vivo and in vitro study 
revealed that BR treat AD by reducing the neurotoxicity of Aβ25-35 induced nerve 
cells by regulating PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Our data strongly support a 
theoretical basis and methodology for the treatment of AD by BR and a reference 
for its new drug development.

Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a cerebrovascular disease characterized by 
vascular amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition. CAA is often seen in the brains of elderly 
individuals and in a majority of patients with Alzheimer's disease. The 
molecular pathways triggered by vascular Aβ, causing vessel wall breakdown and 
ultimately leading to intracerebral haemorrhage and cognitive decline, remain 
poorly understood. The occurrence of CAA-related inflammation (CAA-ri) and 
Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormalities (ARIA) have sparked interest for a role of 
neuroinflammation in CAA pathogenesis. This review discusses prior studies of 
neuroinflammation in CAA and outlines potential future research directions 
targeting candidates such as matrix metalloproteinases, complement activation, 
microglial activation, reactive astrocytes and parenchymal border macrophages. 
Understanding the role of neuroinflammation in CAA pathogenesis could help 
identify new therapeutic strategies.

α-Hederin, a naturally occurring compound found in various plant sources, has 
remarkable properties and therapeutic potential for human health. One notable 
attribute is its potent anti-inflammatory activity, such as in arthritis, 
asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease. In addition, it exhibits notable 
antioxidant effects implicated in the development of chronic diseases, including 
cardiovascular disorders and certain types of cancer. According to research, it 
may limit the growth and proliferation of cancer cells, making it a possible 
candidate for future cancer treatments. Moreover, it is a promising 
neuroprotective agent and enhances cognitive function, suggesting its potential 
in the treatment of neurodegenerative illnesses like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's 
disease. The multifaceted benefits of α-hederin make it an intriguing compound 
with significant therapeutic implications. As research progresses, exploring its 
mechanisms of action and clinical applications is warranted. Harnessing the 
potential of α-hederin may pave the way for innovative treatment strategies and 
improved outcomes in the battle against various chronic diseases.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) is 
essentially characterized by progressive changes in personality and cognition. 
Clinically, bvFTD presents with often profound behavioral symptomatology. 
Despite the high burden of these symptoms for both patients and caregivers, 
there is no general consensus on an effective pharmacological symptomatic 
treatment. Interestingly, for multiple similar symptoms in primary psychiatric 
disorders, there is consensus on an effective pharmacological treatment. The aim 
of this study is to explore currently preferred clinical practices in the 
pharmacological treatment of specific core behavioral symptoms in bvFTD by 
world-leading clinical experts.
METHODS: A digital survey was conducted among members of the Neuropsychiatric 
International Consortium on Frontotemporal Dementia, comprising neurologists, 
psychiatrists, and neuropsychiatrists. Respondents recommended pharmacological 
treatments targeting symptoms including disinhibition, apathy, loss of empathy, 
hyperorality, perseverative/compulsive behaviors, and positive psychotic 
symptoms.
RESULTS: Of 48 respondents with a median experience of 11.5 years in treating 
bvFTD, disinhibition was most frequently targeted (58.4%), followed by 
perseverative/compulsive behaviors (46.5%). Recommended drug classes included 
atypical antipsychotics (35.1%), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors 
(31.2%), antiepileptics (10.0%), serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitors 
(8.4%), benzodiazepines (4.0%), and others (11.4%).
CONCLUSIONS: Our survey revealed diverse pharmacological treatment practices for 
behavioral symptoms in bvFTD, reflecting the expected radical heterogeneity in 
pharmacological treatment strategies. Notwithstanding this, results from this 
explorative survey could further inform future research directions, and thus in 
turn potentially aid in establishing more consensus on effective pharmacological 
management of bvFTD, while the field awaits the development of highly 
anticipated disease-modifying treatment(s).

OBJECTIVE: To meet the growing demand for timely diagnosis in the new era of 
disease-modifying medications for Alzheimer's disease (AD), the present study 
aimed to reduce clinic wait times by developing and refining an abbreviated 
neuropsychological battery to assess individuals with a suspected amnestic 
process (i.e., Early-Stage AD Pathway).
METHOD: Early-Stage AD Pathway patients were referred by an internal neurology 
provider who determined that the patient had: (1) an amnestic clinical 
presentation, (2) a normal neurological examination, and (3) a Montreal 
Cognitive Assessment total score between 18 and 25. These patients were 
scheduled for a 2-h neuropsychological evaluation, including a brief clinical 
interview and an abbreviated testing battery. We evaluated n = 19 patients in 
the Early-Stage AD Pathway and compared them to 114 older adults referred via 
traditional clinic procedures (i.e., General Clinic).
RESULTS: Most individuals evaluated via the Early-Stage AD Pathway were 
diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI; 68.4%) or mild dementia (21.1%) 
through the neuropsychological evaluation. Rate of diagnosis of MCI/dementia was 
comparable between groups. The average number of days between initial referral 
and completion of the neuropsychological evaluation was significantly lower 
(Mdiff = 145.8 days, U = 1867.500, p < 0.001) for the Early-Stage AD Pathway 
group than for the General Clinic group, as the former could be scheduled more 
flexibly.
CONCLUSIONS: Implementing an abbreviated neuropsychological assessment process 
significantly reduced the time between referral and evaluation to identify 
individuals who may be eligible for emerging pharmacological treatments for AD 
and/or non-pharmacological interventions in a timely manner.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a condition characterized by the gradual 
degeneration of the nervous system that poses significant challenges to 
cognitive function and overall mental health. Given the increasing global life 
expectancy, there is an urgent need for effective strategies to prevent and 
manage Alzheimer's disease, with a particular focus on anti-aging interventions. 
Recent scientific advancements have unveiled several promising strategies for 
combating Alzheimer's disease (AD), ranging from lifestyle interventions to 
cutting-edge pharmacological treatments and therapies targeting the underlying 
biological processes of aging and AD. Regular physical exercise, cognitive 
engagement, a balanced diet, and social interaction serve as key pillars in 
maintaining brain health. At the same time, therapies target key pathological 
mechanisms of AD, such as amyloid-beta accumulation, tau abnormalities, 
neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and synaptic loss, offering 
potential breakthroughs in treatment. Moreover, cutting-edge innovations such as 
gene therapy, stem cell transplantation, and novel drug delivery systems are 
emerging as potential game-changers in the fight against AD. This review 
critically evaluates the latest research on anti-aging interventions and their 
potential in preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease (AD) by exploring the 
connections between aging mechanisms and AD pathogenesis. It provides a 
comprehensive analysis of both well-established and emerging strategies, while 
also identifying key gaps in current knowledge to guide future research efforts.

The three clap test (TCT) is a simple bedside test that can elicit the so-called 
applause sign (AS), manifesting with more than three claps after the examiner's 
instruction to clap three times. Although the AS was originally described as a 
useful sign differentiating patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) 
from patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), 
it is also known to be present in PD, Alzheimer's disease and several other 
diseases. It reflects the so-called stopping impulsivity and cognitive and 
frontal lobe dysfunction. In addition to the AS, the TCT can also elicit the 
non-applause sign, linked with the apathy subtype of behavioural variant of FTD 
and the jumping the gun sign, a sign of waiting impulsivity, also seen in PSP. 
This review summarizes the up-to-date clinical aspects and pathophysiology of 
all these signs and discuss the benefit of using the TCT in the routine clinical 
praxis.
