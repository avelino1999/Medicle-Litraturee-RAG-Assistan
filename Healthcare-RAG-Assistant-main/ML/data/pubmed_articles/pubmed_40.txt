OBJECTIVE: This study probed the effect of targeted regulation of CD151 by 
microRNA-214-3p (miR-214-3p) delivered by bone marrow mesenchymal stem 
cells-secreted exosomes (BMSCs-exo) on oxidative stress and apoptosis of neurons 
in Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: Rat BMSCs were isolated, from which MSCs-exo were extracted and 
identified. The AD rat model was established and injected with MSC-exo 
suspension. Meanwhile, miR-214-3p and CD151 interfering lentivirus were 
transfected in MSCs. After injection, learning and cognitive ability of the rats 
were assessed, as well as neuronal apoptosis and oxidative stress injury. 
miR-214-3p and CD151 levels were determined, and their relationship was 
explored.
RESULTS: AD rats had prolonged escape latency, weakened learning and cognitive 
ability, increased neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampal CA3 region, and 
aggravated oxidative stress. After MSC-exo injection, these changes in AD rats 
were partially rescued. CD151 was targeted by miR-214-3p, and MSC-exo improved 
AD in rats through the miR-214-3p/CD151 axis.
CONCLUSION: MSC-exo down-regulates CD151 by targeting miR-214-3p to enhance 
antioxidant capacity, thereby improving the pathological injury of AD rats.

Macroautophagy and mitophagy are critical processes in Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
yet their links to behavioral outcomes, particularly sex-specific differences, 
are not fully understood. This study investigates autophagic (LC3B-II, SQSTM1) 
and mitophagic (BNIP3L, BNIP3, BCL2L13) markers in the cortex and hippocampus of 
male and female 3xTg-AD mice, using western blotting, transmission electron 
microscopy (TEM), and behavioral tests (novel object recognition and novel 
object placement). Significant sex-specific differences emerged: female 3xTg-AD 
mice exhibited autophagosome accumulation due to impaired degradation in the 
cortex, while males showed fewer autophagosomes, especially in the hippocampus, 
without significant degradation changes. TEM analyses demonstrated variations in 
mitochondrial and mitophagosome numbers correlated with memory outcomes. Females 
had enhanced mitophagy, with higher BNIP3L and BCL2L13 levels, whereas males 
showed elevated BNIP3 dimers. Cognitive deficits in females correlated with 
mitochondrial dysfunction in the cortex, while in males, higher LC3B-II levels 
associated positively with cognitive performance, suggesting protective 
autophagy effects. Using machine learning, we predicted mitophagosome and 
mitochondrial numbers based on behavioral data, pioneering a predictive approach 
to cellular outcomes in AD. These findings underscore the importance of 
sex-specific regulation of autophagy and mitophagy in AD and support 
personalized therapeutic approaches targeting these pathways. Integrating 
machine learning emphasizes its potential to advance neurodegenerative research. 
Sex-specific differences in autophagy and mitophagy regulation in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) are highlighted. Female 3xTg-AD mice show autophagosome 
accumulation and cognitive deficits, while males exhibit variations in mitophagy 
markers and behavior.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Parkinson's Disease (PD) are common 
neurodegenerative diseases, characterized by the progressive loss of synapses 
and neurons, leading to cognitive and motor decline. Their pathophysiology 
includes cerebral lesions, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation as well as 
brain-gut axis microbiota dysbiosis. Preclinical investigations demonstrated 
that brain photobiomodulation (bPBM) reduces oxidative stress and inflammation, 
increases cerebral blood flow and enhance neurogenesis and synaptogenesis, which 
makes bPBM a promising treatment in AD and PD. This review focuses on the 
clinical application of bPBM in AD and PD. It aims to provide a scientific 
overview of the current clinical knowledge, review recent clinical studies 
findings, and describe future directions and upcoming clinical studies. So far, 
several clinical studies investigated bPBM therapy, at various parameters, both 
in patients with AD and related dementia, and PD. All demonstrate bPBM safety 
and bring valuable clinical information regarding efficacy, with particularly 
promising results in AD. However, their exploratory design and inconsistent 
quality lead to a low level of evidence, which currently does not support the 
widespread use of bPBM in clinical practice. Future clinical research should 
address two gaps: the need for robust double-blinded RCTs vs sham with a higher 
number of patients and a longer follow-up, and the need for research focusing on 
dosimetry to determine which bPBM parameters are optimal. The ongoing or 
unpublished clinical studies on bPBM should fill in this gap.

Neuroinflammation is one of crucial pathogenic mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's 
disease, sepsis-associated encephalopathy, and postoperative cognitive 
dysfunction. These diseases or conditions are often accompanied by typical 
clinical manifestations of cognitive impairments, including impaired learning 
and memory but underlying mechanisms are unknown. Hence, effective treatments 
are not available. In the current study, mice received intraperitoneal 
administrations of LPS (0.5 mg/kg, daily, Escherichia coliO55:B5) for seven 
consecutive days and after which, different cohorts were used for behavioral 
assessments with open field, Y maze, and novel object recognition test or for 
electrophysiology recordings of mEPSC, mIPSC or LTP in ex vivo preparations. 
Their hippocampi were harvested for immunostaining or Western blotting of PSD95, 
vGLUT1, vGAT, gephyrin, PV, and SST. In vivo optical fiber calcium recording was 
used to evaluate the neuronal excitability. During the early stage of 
neuroinflammation induced by LPS, there was a decrease of excitatory afferent 
synapses and transmission in the CA1. During the later stage of 
neuroinflammation, there was an increase of inhibitory afferent synapses and 
transmission in the CA1, resulting in excessive inhibition on excitatory 
neurons. Both of them contributed to the decreased hippocampal neuronal 
excitability and impaired LTP, ultimately leading to cognitive impairments. 
Overexpression of CREB in the early stage or inactivation of PV-positive 
interneurons in the later stage in the CA1 both improved cognitive impairments. 
Our work suggests that negating decreased excitatory and increased inhibitory 
afferent in the hippocampus may improve cognitive impairments relate to 
neuroinflammation associated with neurological diseases.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents the most prevalent form of dementia, 
characterized by progressive cognitive impairment and chronic neuroinflammation. 
Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), including anti-programmed cell death (PD)-1 
and anti-PD-L1, signify a revolutionary advancement in cancer treatment by 
preventing T-cell exhaustion; however, their therapeutic application in AD 
presents a conundrum. Hypothesis: Recent preclinical studies indicate that PD-1 
inhibition in AD mouse models induces an interferon-gamma (IFN-γ)-mediated 
response, leading to increased recruitment of monocyte-derived macrophages into 
the brain, enhanced clearance of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques, and improved 
cognitive performance. Nonetheless, this therapeutic effect is counterbalanced 
by the potential for exacerbated neuroinflammation, as PD-1/PD-L1 blockade may 
potentiate pro-inflammatory T helper (Th)1 and Th17 responses. In this review, 
we critically discuss the pertinent pro-inflammatory and neuroprotective facets 
of T cell biology in the pathogenesis of AD, emphasizing the potential for 
modulation of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis to influence both Aβ clearance and the 
dynamics of neuroinflammatory processes. In summary, we determine that ICIs are 
promising tools for reducing AD pathology and improving cognition. However, it 
is essential to refine treatment protocols and carefully select patients to 
optimize neuroprotective effects while adequately considering inflammatory 
risks.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial neuropathology 
characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques, 
neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and cholinergic system dysfunction. At present, 
there is no effective treatment strategy for AD. Our previous research showed 
that ZJQ-3F acts as an inhibitor of AChE/BACE1/GSK3β, and showed good 
blood-brain barrier permeability, appropriate bioavailability and oral safety. 
In order to further study, the protective effect of ZJQ-3F on APP/PS1/Tau 
transgenic mice was determined.
METHODS: APP/PS1/Tau transgenic mice model of AD was treated with ZJQ-3F from 
the age of 8 to 12 months, and then behavioral tests was conducted. Western 
blot, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining were used to evaluate 
the level of tau protein, Aβ plaques and synaptic function.
RESULTS: Our results revealed that administration of ZJQ-3F could improve the 
cognitive function of APP/PS1/Tau transgenic mice. In addition, compared with 
APP/PS1/Tau mice, the protein expression levels of tau protein phosphorylation 
site at Ser396, Thr212 and Thr181 in the cortex and hippocampus of ZJQ-3F 
treated mice was significantly decreased. Moreover, the results showed that 
ZJQ-3F significantly reduced the deposition of Aβ in the cortex and hippocampus. 
Furthermore, the results indicated that the protein expression levels of PSD95, 
SYP and SYT in the cortex and hippocampus were increased markedly after ZJQ-3F 
was given.
CONCLUSIONS: Our studies suggest that the chronic administration of ZJQ-3F can 
improve learning and memory ability, reduce tau protein phosphorylation, reduce 
Aβ deposition and improve synaptic dysfunction in APP/PS1/Tau transgenic model 
of AD, indicating that ZJQ-3F can be used as a multi-target inhibitor to slow 
down the progress of AD.

Research has demonstrated that engaging in regular exercise has the potential to 
enhance cognitive function, promote neuroplasticity, and mitigate the likelihood 
of experiencing cognitive decline. The underlying mechanisms responsible for 
these effects are intricate and encompass various pathways, including the 
interaction between neurogranin and calmodulin. The activation of calcium 
signaling pathways is a significant mechanism through which regular exercise 
facilitates the treatment of age-related diseases. The activation of neurogranin 
and calmodulin induced by exercise can provide protection against 
neurodegeneration by promoting neuronal survival, mitigating oxidative stress, 
and improving mitochondrial function through the regulation of calcium 
homeostasis and energy metabolism. In addition, there is evidence suggesting 
that engaging in regular exercise can lead to an upregulation of neurotrophic 
factors, specifically brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). These factors 
are crucial for the survival of neurons, the plasticity of synapses, and overall 
cognitive function. Researchers have discovered the involvement of neurogranin 
in the regulation of BDNF signaling, underscoring its significance in 
exercise-induced neuroprotection and cognitive enhancement. The current work 
offers valuable insights into how neurogranin/calmodulin cooperation, 
facilitated by regular exercise, promotes the treatment of aging-related 
diseases. The results suggest that regular exercise could enhance memory, 
learning, synaptic plasticity, and resilience to neurological damage; promote 
recovery after brain injury; and treat aging-related disorders such as 
Alzheimer's disease.

Dementia is a heterogeneous syndrome characterized by the progressive 
deterioration of various brain functions, severely impacting cognitive, 
emotional, and social abilities. According to a World Health Organization (WHO) 
report, dementia represents a pressing global health concern, with the number of 
affected individuals projected to triple by 2050. Among its various subtypes, 
vascular dementia (VD) stands as the second most common form, following 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Despite ongoing efforts in drug development, no 
pharmaceutical entity has yet received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) for the treatment of VD. Emerging evidence underscores the 
critical involvement of the brain's Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) in the 
pathogenesis of multiple neurodegenerative disorders, including VD. The 
intricate roles of RAS components include regulating vascular tone, neuronal 
growth and survival, regulating cerebral blood flow and endothelial dysfunction, 
increasing neuroinflammation (by increasing release of IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α, 
microglial activation), oxidative stress and destruction of BBB integrity, 
mainly through Angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) and type 2 (AT2) receptors, are of 
significant interest in the pathophysiology of VD. However, disruptions in these 
signaling pathways are believed to contribute substantially to the progression 
of VD. This review addresses the limitations of current therapeutic approaches 
for VD while emphasizing the untapped potential of RAS-targeted interventions. 
We systematically explore the neurophysiological mechanisms of brain RAS, their 
role in promoting neuronal health, and the factors that compromise these 
pathways, ultimately leading to cognitive decline. By elucidating these 
mechanisms and challenges, the review offers novel insights into designing 
innovative RAS-based therapeutic strategies, paving the way for effective 
clinical management of VD. This work aspires to stimulate further research and 
development in this underexplored yet promising domain.

Lysosomes are an important intracellular organelle that regulates cellular 
degradation. Dysfunctional lysosomes disrupt this process, leading to the 
accumulation of toxic proteins that are meant to be degraded inside the cell, 
leading to cellular stress and potential toxicity. One of the proteins is 
beta-amyloid which is associated with conditions like cerebral amyloid 
angiopathy (CAA) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). To identify its effects on the 
vascular compartment, the current study explored lysosomal dysfunction's impact 
on cytosolic vacuole formation and amyloid beta 40 (Aß40) levels in human brain 
endothelial cells (HBEC-5i). Cells treated with the lysosomotropic compound 
chloroquine (70.5 µM) exhibited morphological changes, including prominent 
cytosolic vacuole formation. The vacuole density was recorded at 11.86 ± 1.907 
vacuoles per cell (p < 0.05), and its diameter was significantly increased (3.76 
± 0.182 µm, p < 0.05) compared to the negative control group. However, the 
average cell size remained unchanged despite the vacuole formation in CQ-treated 
cells. ELISA tests on lysate and supernatant revealed no significant differences 
between treatment and control groups in intracellular and extracellular Aß40 
levels. This suggested that while lysosomal dysfunction induced cytosolic 
vacuole changes, it did not significantly alter Aß40 levels. Further research is 
needed to elucidate the pathways involved in Aß40.

Frontotemporal degeneration (FTD) is a rare neurodegenerative disease in which 
patients can present with cognitive, behavioral, motor, and speech impairment. 
Currently, there are no approved therapies available to slow or halt disease 
progression. Detection and monitoring of patient symptoms is challenging for 
this heterogeneous disease and has negatively impacted progress in FTD clinical 
trials. Rapid technological advancements can promote the development of digital 
health technologies (DHTs) capable of capturing even the most subtle clinical 
impairments. DHTs are computing platforms being designed to measure meaningful 
aspects of disease onset and progression. Here we present some of the numerous 
tools currently being developed to measure changes in the functional domains 
that become impaired in FTD, challenges faced by developers, and a proposed 
roadmap for developing fit-for-purpose DHTs that will aid in the development of 
effective therapies for FTD. HIGHLIGHTS: DHTs are being developed to assess FTD 
onset and progression. Tool developers must overcome numerous challenges in 
creating effective applications. Guidance to tool developers aims to benefit FTD 
drug development and patient care.

BACKGROUND: Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a hallmark of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), linked to adverse effects of emerging AD treatments. We explored 
the molecular effects of CAA in mouse brain and evaluated how these could be 
prevented by two repurposed United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
approved treatments.
METHODS: Brain proteomics was performed on the Tg-SwDI genetic mouse model 
carrying disease causing mutations and developing AD characteristic cognitive 
deficits and severe CAA. Cortical and hippocampal tissues from presymptomatic 
male and female mice were studied.
RESULTS: We identify a core of dysregulated proteins across studies, including 
established markers of AD as well as proteins indicative of astrogliosis and 
negative regulators of synaptic stability and function. Two FDA approved, 
repurposed carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAIs), acetazolamide and 
methazolamide, were effective in preventing these molecular adaptations.
DISCUSSION: The two drugs broadly prevent proteome adaptations to the 
detrimental genotype and retain glutamatergic synapse proteins significantly 
closer to wild-type levels.
HIGHLIGHTS: The brain proteome changes of mice with CAA are mapped. Cortical and 
hippocampal tissues from presymptomatic male and female mice are studied. 
Markers of AD, astrogliosis, and synaptic stability are dysregulated. Two CAI 
are effective in preventing these protein changes.

Homocysteine, a sulfur-containing amino acid, is an intermediate product during 
the metabolism of methionine, a vital amino acid. An elevated concentration of 
homocysteine in the plasma, named hyperhomocysteinemia, has been significantly 
related to the onset of several diseases, including diabetes, multiple 
sclerosis, osteoporosis, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders such as 
dementia, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. An interaction between metabolic 
pathways of homocysteine and gut microbiota has been reported, and specific 
microbial signatures have been found in individuals experiencing 
hyperhomocysteinemia. Furthermore, some evidence suggests that gut microbial 
modulation may exert an influence on homocysteine levels and related disease 
progression. Conventional approaches for managing hyperhomocysteinemia typically 
involve dietary interventions alongside the administration of supplements such 
as B vitamins and betaine. The present review aims to synthesize recent 
advancements in understanding interventions targeted at mitigating 
hyperhomocysteinemia, with a particular emphasis on the role of gut microbiota 
in these strategies. The emerging therapeutic potential of gut microbiota has 
been reported for several diseases. Indeed, a better understanding of the 
complex interaction between microbial species and homocysteine metabolism may 
help in finding novel therapeutic strategies to counteract hyperhomocysteinemia.

Lithium was introduced into psychiatric practice in the late nineteenth century 
and has since become a standard treatment for severe psychiatric disorders, 
particularly those characterized by psychotic agitation. It remains the most 
effective agent for managing acute mania and preventing relapses in bipolar 
disorder. Despite potential adverse effects, lithium's use should be carefully 
considered relative to other treatment options, as these alternatives may 
present distinct safety and tolerability profiles. The World Health Organization 
classifies lithium salts as 'essential' medications for inclusion in global 
healthcare systems. Over the past two decades, the growing recognition of 
lithium's efficacy-extending beyond mood stabilization to include reducing 
suicide risk and inducing neuroprotection-has led to its incorporation into 
clinical practice guidelines. Current research, particularly from translational 
models, suggests that lithium's pleiotropic effects benefit not only mental and 
brain health but also other organs and systems. This supports its potential as a 
therapeutic candidate for neurological conditions, particularly those associated 
with neurodegenerative processes. This article will discuss the historical 
background, discovery, and early experimentation of lithium in psychiatry. We 
will also review its mechanisms of action and discuss its potential in the 
treatment and prevention of neurodegenerative disorders, focusing on Alzheimer's 
disease.

Background/Objectives: Brain insulin resistance is a potential causal factor for 
dementia in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), a 
neurotrophin, plays a key role in central insulin signaling and neuroprotection. 
Intracerebrovenitricular (ICV) administration of streptozotocin (STZ) disrupts 
insulin signal transduction, leading to brain insulin resistance, which may 
mimic the early pathophysiological changes in sporadic AD (sAD). In this study, 
we investigated whether restoring insulin signaling through ICV injection of 
IGF-1 could ameliorate spatial memory deficits during sAD progression in a rat 
model induced by ICV STZ injection. Methods: Male Wistar rats (n = 40) were 
subjected to double ICV injections of STZ (0.75 mg/kg/ventricle, days 2 and 4) 
and IGF-1 (1 μg/single injection, days 1 and 3), and placed at the Morris water 
maze (MWM) at baseline, 7, 45 and 90 days after injections. Reference (days 1-3 
and day 4 MWM)) and working (days 5-8 MWM) memory, microglia activation (CD68+ 
cells), and amyloid β (Aβ) deposition (immunohistochemistry) were measured. 
Results: We found that ICVIGF-1 administration protected working memory 
demonstrated as (1) reduced latency to reach the platform, and reduced swimming 
distance in trials 3 (p < 0.05) and 4 (p < 0.01) on days 45 and 90 
post-injection and (2) a short-term (up to 45 days post-injection) enhancement 
of reference memory, manifested by a reduction in swimming distance and latency 
(p < 0.05). Furthermore, IGF-1 treatment reduced neuroinflammation in CA2 (p < 
0.05) and Aβ deposition in CA1(p < 0.01) of the hippocampus. Conclusions: 
Central IGF-1 attenuates spatial memory deficits in the ICVSTZ-induced sAD model 
by reducing neuroinflammation and Aβ accumulation in the hippocampus.

Background/Objectives: The purpose of this research was to investigate the 
effects of bisphenol A (BPA) exposure on neurobehavioral testing in young Wistar 
rats and to evaluate the therapeutic potential of Thymus ciliatus (TEO) 
essential oil to attenuate the damage induced by this chemical toxin. Methods: 
The essential oil was extracted by hydro-distillation (yield of 2.26%), and the 
characterization by GC-MS indicates that the major components of Thymus ciliatus 
oil are thymol (63.33%), p-cymene (13.4%), and σ-terpinene (6.69%). Acute BPA 
intoxication was induced with a dose of 50 mg/kg orally for 60 days. The 
neurobehavioral evaluation, performed using a comprehensive set of tests 
including the forced swim test, dark/light box, Morris water maze, open field 
test, and sucrose preference test, clearly demonstrated that bisphenol A (BPA) 
exposure induced significant neurobehavioral impairments. Results: These 
impairments included reduced exploratory behavior indicative of heightened 
stress, anxiety, and depressive-like states, as well as deficits in memory and 
learning. Furthermore, BPA intoxication was associated with metabolic 
disturbances such as hyperglycemia along with histopathological evidence of 
brain tissue damage. However, TEO treatment attenuated these adverse effects by 
restoring neurobehavioral function. Molecular docking analysis revealed an 
affinity between the major essential oils identified in T. ciliatus, BPA, and 
the 5HT2C receptor and the MAO, AChE, and BChE enzymes, suggesting a potential 
mechanism underlying BPA's effects on behavior and memory. In addition, TEO also 
showed an interaction with these molecules, suggesting a therapeutic potential 
against BPA. These findings underscore the promising role of TEO in mitigating 
the poisonous effects of BPA and pave the way for additional research into the 
molecular mechanisms and therapeutic uses of natural bioactive compounds for the 
prevention and treatment of toxic diseases. Thymol, the major compound in TEO, 
exhibited activity related to the dopamine and serotonin pathways, so it could 
have potential antidepressant properties. Conclusions: Thymol might be a 
promising candidate for the treatment of neurodegenerative and neurological 
disorders such as depression, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease while 
also preventing histological damage in the brain.

Background/Objectives: Amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque accumulation, oxidative stress, and 
cholinergic dysfunction are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a 
neurodegenerative disability that progresses over time, ultimately resulting in 
the loss of neurons. The side effects and limitations of current synthetic drugs 
have shifted attention toward natural alternatives. This study investigates the 
ethanolic extract of Aegle marmelos (L.) Corrêa fruits for their antioxidant, 
AChE-inhibitory, and anti-amyloidogenic properties, as well as their 
neuroprotective effects against amyloid beta-peptide (Aβ1-42). Methods: 
Phytochemical constituents were identified through HR-LCMS analysis and their 
antioxidant (DPPH, FRAP) and neuroprotective activities (AChE inhibition, ThT 
binding, MTT assay, ROS reduction, MMP restoration, and AD-related gene 
expression via qRT-PCR) were assessed using SHSY-5Y neuroblastoma cells. 
Results: The extract revealed the existence of flavonoids, phenols, and other 
bioactive substances. In vitro assays demonstrated strong antioxidant and 
AChE-inhibitory activities, while the ThT binding assay showed protection 
against amyloid-β aggregation. The extract exhibited no cytotoxicity in SHSY-5Y 
cells, even at a concentration of 500 μg/mL, whereas Aβ1-42 at 20 μM induced 
significant cytotoxicity. Co-treatment with Aβ1-42 (10 μM and 20 μM) and the 
extract improved cell viability (˃50%) and reduced ROS levels. Additionally, the 
extract restored mitochondrial membrane potential in Aβ1-42 treated cells, 
highlighting its role in preserving mitochondrial function. Conclusions: These 
findings suggest that A. marmelos fruits serve as a powerful source of natural 
antioxidants, AChE inhibitors, and anti-amyloidogenic agents, positioning them 
as a compelling option for AD treatment.

This comprehensive review examines the therapeutic potential of metformin, a 
well-established diabetes medication, in treating neurodegenerative disorders. 
Originally used as a first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes, recent studies 
have begun investigating metformin's effects beyond metabolic disorders, 
particularly its neuroprotective capabilities against conditions like 
Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and multiple 
sclerosis. Key findings demonstrate that metformin's neuroprotective effects 
operate through multiple pathways: AMPK activation enhancing cellular energy 
metabolism and autophagy; upregulation of antioxidant defenses; suppression of 
inflammation; inhibition of protein aggregation; and improvement of 
mitochondrial function. These mechanisms collectively address common 
pathological features in neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation, including 
oxidative stress, protein accumulation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Clinical 
and preclinical evidence supporting metformin's association with improved 
cognitive performance, reduced risk of dementia, and modulation of pathological 
hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases is critically evaluated. While metformin 
shows promise as a therapeutic agent, this review emphasizes the need for 
further investigation to fully understand its mechanisms and optimal therapeutic 
applications in neurodegenerative diseases.

Background and Objectives: Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) 
at 40 Hz has shown potential to enhance cognitive function. However, research on 
its combination with cognitive exercises, particularly its long-term effects in 
a dementia population, remains limited. This study investigated the effects of 
40 Hz tACS paired with simultaneous cognitive exercises on cognition, 
neuropsychiatric symptoms, and the depression status of individuals with 
dementia in a sham-controlled, double-blind crossover design. Materials and 
Methods: A total of 42 participants with dementia were randomized into two 
groups: (1) the R1S2 group received 40 Hz real tACS with cognitive exercises, 
followed by a ≥8-week washout period, and then sham tACS with cognitive 
exercises; (2) the S1R2 group received the reversed sequence. tACS was applied 
at 1.5 mA peak-to-peak with electrodes over the left dorsolateral prefrontal 
cortex and contralateral supraorbital area. Participants received two 30 min 
stimulation sessions per day, 5 days per week, for 4 consecutive weeks, paired 
with cognitive exercises using the MindTriggers app (2.9.1). The primary outcome 
was the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) and 
the secondary outcomes included the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale 
(MADRS) and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q). All outcome 
measures were assessed before and after each treatment block. Results: Real tACS 
paired with cognitive exercises significantly improved ADAS-Cog scores 
post-treatment compared to pre-treatment (p-value = 0.019), whereas sham tACS 
did not. Furthermore, real tACS produced significant long-term improvements 
approximately 2-3 months post-treatment in ADAS-Cog scores compared to sham 
(p-value = 0.048). Both real (p-value = 0.003) and sham (p-value = 0.015) tACS 
significantly reduced NPI-Q scores post-treatment. MADRS scores significantly 
improved (p-value = 0.007) post-treatment for real tACS but not sham. 
Conclusions: The 40 Hz tACS paired with cognitive exercises improves cognition, 
neuropsychiatric symptoms, and depression post-treatment in dementia, with 
sustained cognitive effects. The findings highlight its potential as a 
non-invasive therapeutic intervention for dementia.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD), and more specifically late-onset 
Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), represents a considerable challenge in terms of 
early and timely diagnosis and treatment. Early diagnosis is crucial to improve 
the efficacy of the therapies and patients' quality of life. The current 
challenge is to accurately identify at-risk individuals before the 
manifestations of the first symptoms of AD.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Here, we present an improved model for LOAD risk 
prediction, which applies the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm. We have 
achieved a sensitivity of 0.80 and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.71, which 
represents a high performance especially when compared to an AUC of 0.66 
reported previously in 2019 using a KNN model.
DISCUSSION: The application of a mathematical model that combines genetic and 
clinical covariates showed a good prediction of the AD/LOAD risk, with the 
higher weight being the polygenic genetic risk, APOE haplotype, and age. 
Compared to previous studies, our model integrates and correlates genetic 
prediction together with phenotypic information by fine-tuning the parameters of 
the model in order to achieve the best performance. This algorithm can be used 
in the general population and does not require the manifestation of any symptoms 
for its effective application. Thus, we present here an advanced model for risk 
prediction of LOAD.

Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a noninvasive imaging 
technique used to visualize retinal blood flow and identify changes in vascular 
density and enlargement or distortion of the foveal avascular zone (FAZ), which 
are indicators of various eye diseases. Although several automated FAZ detection 
and segmentation algorithms have been developed for use with OCTA, their 
performance can vary significantly due to differences in data accessibility of 
OCTA in different retinal pathologies, and differences in image quality in 
different subjects and/or different OCTA devices. For example, data from 
subjects with direct macular damage, such as in age-related macular degeneration 
(AMD), are more readily available in eye clinics, while data on macular damage 
due to systemic diseases like Alzheimer's disease are often less accessible; 
data from healthy subjects may have better OCTA quality than subjects with 
ophthalmic pathologies. Typically, segmentation algorithms make use of 
convolutional neural networks and, more recently, vision transformers, which 
make use of both long-range context and fine-grained detail. However, 
transformers are known to be data-hungry, and may overfit small datasets, such 
as those common for FAZ segmentation in OCTA, to which there is limited access 
in clinical practice. To improve model generalization in low-data or imbalanced 
settings, we propose a multi-condition transformer-based architecture that uses 
four teacher encoders to distill knowledge into a shared base model, enabling 
the transfer of learned features across multiple datasets. These include 
intra-modality distillation using OCTA datasets from four ocular conditions: 
healthy aging eyes, Alzheimer's disease, AMD, and diabetic retinopathy; and 
inter-modality distillation incorporating color fundus photographs of subjects 
undergoing laser photocoagulation therapy. Our multi-condition model achieved a 
mean Dice Index of 83.8% with pretraining, outperforming single-condition models 
(mean of 83.1%) across all conditions. Pretraining on color fundus 
photocoagulation images improved the average Dice Index by a small margin on all 
conditions except AMD (1.1% on single-condition models, and 0.1% on 
multi-condition models). Our architecture demonstrates potential for broader 
applications in detecting and analyzing ophthalmic and systemic diseases across 
diverse imaging datasets and settings.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles, 
which contribute significantly to neuroinflammation, a central driver of disease 
pathogenesis. The activation of microglia and astrocytes, coupled with the 
complex interactions between Aβ and tau pathologies and the innate immune 
response, leads to a cascade of inflammatory events. This process triggers the 
release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, exacerbating neuronal 
damage and fostering a cycle of chronic inflammation that accelerates 
neurodegeneration. Key signaling pathways, such as nuclear factor-kappa B 
(NF-κB), Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription 
(JAK/STAT), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and phosphoinositide 
3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt), are involved in regulating the production 
of these inflammatory mediators, offering potential therapeutic targets for AD. 
Recently, extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as a promising tool for AD 
therapy, due to their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and deliver 
therapeutic agents. Despite challenges in standardizing EV-based therapies and 
ensuring their safety, EVs offer a novel approach to modulating 
neuroinflammation and promoting neuroregeneration. This review aims to highlight 
the intricate relationship between neuroinflammation, signaling pathways, and 
the emerging role of EV-based therapeutics in advancing AD treatment strategies.

BACKGROUND: In Alzheimer's disease (AD), MRI atrophy patterns can distinguish 
between amnestic (typical) and non-amnestic (atypical) clinical phenotypes and 
are increasingly used for diagnosis and outcome measures in clinical trials. 
However, understanding how protein accumulation and other key features of 
neurodegeneration influence these imaging measurements, are lacking. The current 
study aimed to assess regional MRI patterns of cortical atrophy across clinical 
AD phenotypes, and their association with amyloid-beta (Aβ), phosphorylated tau 
(pTau), neuro-axonal degeneration and microvascular deterioration.
METHODS: Post-mortem in-situ 3DT1 3 T-MRI data was obtained from 33 AD (17 
typical, 16 atypical) and 16 control brain donors. Additionally, ante-mortem 
3DT1 3 T-MRI scans of brain donors were collected if available. Regional volumes 
were obtained from MRI scans using an atlas based parcellation software. Eight 
cortical brain regions were selected from formalin-fixed right hemispheres of 
brain donors and then immunostained for Aβ, pTau, neurofilament light, and 
collagen IV. Group comparisons and volume-pathology associations were analyzed 
using linear mixed models corrected for age, sex, post-mortem delay, and 
intracranial volume.
RESULTS: Compared to controls, both typical and atypical AD showed volume loss 
in the temporo-occipital cortex, while typical AD showed additional volume loss 
in the parietal cortex. Posterior cingulate volume was lower in typical AD 
compared to atypical AD (- 6.9%, p = 0.043). In AD, a global positive 
association between MRI cortical volume and Aβ load (βs = 0.21, p = 0.010), and 
a global negative association with NfL load (βs = - 0.18, p = 0.018) were 
observed. Regionally, higher superior parietal gyrus volume was associated with 
higher Aβ load in typical AD (βs = 0.47, p = 0.004), lower middle frontal gyrus 
volume associated with higher NfL load in atypical AD (βs = - 0.50, p < 0.001), 
and lower hippocampal volume associated with higher COLIV load in typical AD (βs 
= - 1.69, p < 0.001). Comparing post-mortem with ante-mortem scans showed 
minimal volume differences at scan-intervals within 2 years, highlighting the 
translational aspect of this study.
CONCLUSION: For both clinical phenotypes, cortical volume is affected by Aβ and 
neuro-axonal damage, but in opposing directions. Differences in volume-pathology 
relationships between clinical phenotypes are region-specific. The findings of 
this study could improve the interpretation of MRI datasets in heterogenous AD 
cohorts, both in research and clinical settings.

inflammation (CAA-ri).

BACKGROUND: Research of the past years has refined our perception of cerebral 
amyloid angiopathy-related inflammation (CAA-ri) as a subacute autoimmune 
encephalopathy, which is presumably caused by elevated CSF concentrations of 
anti-amyloid β (Aβ) autoantibodies. A broad understanding of the 
pathophysiological mechanisms and diagnostic criteria of CAA-ri may lay the 
foundation for improved immunosuppressive treatment of the disease.
MAIN TEXT: Spontaneous CAA-ri mainly occurs in elderly patients but might also 
be evoked iatrogenically by modern treatment with amyloid-modifying therapies in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). On a histopathological level, CAA-ri is characterized 
by microglial activation and the formation of vasogenic edemas. Clinically, the 
disease frequently presents with progressive cognitive decline, focal 
neurological deficits, headache and epileptic seizures. While brain biopsy has 
formerly represented the gold standard in the diagnosis of CAA-ri, its 
importance has been increasingly replaced by clinical as well as radiological 
diagnostic criteria and the relevance of anti-Aβ autoantibodies in the CSF of 
affected patients. Though relevant progress has been achieved in 
immunosuppressive treatment of CAA-ri, the protocols lack standardization as 
well as decision criteria for the choice of the respective immunosuppressive 
agent.
CONCLUSIONS: CAA-ri gains increasing interest as a spontaneous human model of 
iatrogenic edematous amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA-E) in the 
context of amyloid-modifying therapies. In near future, screening of AD patients 
for the presence of CAA-ri using CSF anti-Aβ autoantibodies might play a 
decisive role in the risk stratification as well as dosage finding of 
amyloid-modifying therapies, as they show high specificity for CAA-ri. The 
clinical and radiological diagnostic criteria by Auriel et al. allow diagnosis 
of probable resp. possible CAA-ri with high accuracy. Though only tested in 
small, specialized patient cohorts to date, additional imaging modalities 
(11C-PK11195 PET) might play a future role in the clinical monitoring of CAA-ri. 
Therapy of CAA-ri frequently encompasses initial steroid treatment, whereby 
different schemes, dosages as well as substances are used. Choice of 
immunosuppressive agents with higher potency still requires objective decision 
criteria, which should be established in future studies involving larger CAA-ri 
patient cohorts.

Immune dysfunction is implicated in the aetiology of psychiatric, 
neurodevelopmental, and neurodegenerative conditions, but the issue of causality 
remains unclear impeding attempts to develop new interventions. Using genomic 
data on protein and gene expression across blood and brain, we assessed evidence 
of a potential causal role for 736 immune response-related biomarkers on 7 
neuropsychiatric conditions by applying Mendelian randomization (MR) and genetic 
colocalisation analyses. A systematic three-tier approach, grouping biomarkers 
based on increasingly stringent criteria, was used to appraise evidence of 
causality (passing MR sensitivity analyses, colocalisation, False Discovery Rate 
and Bonferroni thresholds). We provide evidence for a potential causal role of 
29 biomarkers for 7 conditions. The identified biomarkers suggest a role of both 
brain specific and systemic immune response in the aetiology of schizophrenia, 
Alzheimer's disease, depression, and bipolar disorder. Of the identified 
biomarkers, 20 are therapeutically tractable, including ACE, TNFRSF17, SERPING1, 
AGER and CD40, with drugs currently approved or in advanced clinical trials. 
Based on the largest available selection of plasma immune-response related 
biomarkers, our study provides insight into possible influential biomarkers for 
the aetiology of neuropsychiatric conditions. These genetically prioritised 
biomarkers now require examination to further evaluate causality, their role in 
the aetiological mechanisms underlying the conditions, and therapeutic 
potential.

Frontotemporal lobar degeneration with neuronal inclusions of the TAR 
DNA-binding protein 43 (FTLD-TDP) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder with 
only a limited number of risk loci identified. We report our comprehensive 
genome-wide association study as part of the International FTLD-TDP Whole-Genome 
Sequencing Consortium, including 985 patients and 3,153 controls compiled from 
26 institutions/brain banks in North America, Europe and Australia, and 
meta-analysis with the Dementia-seq cohort. We confirm UNC13A as the strongest 
overall FTLD-TDP risk factor and identify TNIP1 as a novel FTLD-TDP risk factor. 
In subgroup analyzes, we further identify genome-wide significant loci specific 
to each of the three main FTLD-TDP pathological subtypes (A, B and C), as well 
as enrichment of risk loci in distinct tissues, brain regions, and neuronal 
subtypes, suggesting distinct disease aetiologies in each of the subtypes. Rare 
variant analysis confirmed TBK1 and identified C3AR1, SMG8, VIPR1, RBPJL, 
L3MBTL1 and ANO9, as novel subtype-specific FTLD-TDP risk genes, further 
highlighting the role of innate and adaptive immunity and notch signaling 
pathway in FTLD-TDP, with potential diagnostic and novel therapeutic 
implications.

BACKGROUND: Diagnostic criteria for apathy in neurocognitive disorders (DCA-NCD) 
have recently been updated.
OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether validated scales measuring apathy severity 
capture the three dimensions of the DCA-NCD (diminished initiative, diminished 
interest, diminished emotional expression).
MEASUREMENTS: Degree of mapping ("not at all", "weakly", or "strongly") between 
items on two commonly used apathy scales, the Neuropsychiatric 
Inventory-Clinician (NPI-C) apathy and Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES), with the 
DCA-NCD overall and its 3 dimensions was evaluated by survey.
DESIGN: Survey participants, either experts (n = 12, DCA-NCD authors) or 
scientific community members (n = 19), rated mapping for each item and mean 
scores were calculated. Interrater reliability between expert and scientific 
community members was assessed using Cohen's kappa.
RESULTS: According to experts, 9 of 11 (81.8%) NPI-C apathy items and 6 of 18 
(33.3%) AES items mapped strongly onto the DCA-NCD overall. For the scientific 
community group, 10 of 11 (90.9%) NPI-C apathy items and 7 of 18 (38.8%) AES 
items mapped strongly onto the DCA-NCD overall. The overall mean mapping scores 
were higher for the NPI-C apathy compared to the AES for both expert (t (11) 
= 3.13, p = .01) and scientific community (t (17) = 3.77, p = .002) groups. 
There was moderate agreement between the two groups on overall mapping for the 
NPI-C apathy (kappa= 0.74 (0.57, 1.00)) and AES (kappa= 0.63 (0.35, 1.00)).
CONCLUSIONS: More NPI-C apathy than AES items mapped strongly and uniquely onto 
the DCA-NCD and its dimensions. The NPI-C apathy may better capture the DCA-NCD 
and its dimensions compared with the AES.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Prostate cancer (PC) and dementia may commonly 
co-occur; yet, prior evidence for bidirectional associations is inconsistent. 
This study aims to determine the associations between PC and dementia in large 
population-based studies, which may further inform clinical care.
METHODS: To assess the dementia risk in men with PC, a national cohort study was 
conducted in 178 746 men diagnosed with PC in 1998-2017 and 1 787 460 
age-matched control men in Sweden without prior dementia. Cox regression was 
used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular 
dementia (VaD) through 2018. Subanalyses explored differences by PC treatment 
during 2005-2017. To assess the PC risk in men with dementia, case-control 
analyses were performed in 180 189 men with PC and 1 801 890 age-matched control 
men. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for PC 
associated with prior AD or VaD. All analyses were adjusted for sociodemographic 
factors and health care utilization.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Among men with high-risk PC, those treated with 
androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) only had a higher risk of AD (HR, 1.37; 95% 
confidence interval [CI], 1.19-1.58) and VaD (1.51; 1.29-1.78), but not those 
who received other treatments. Men with low- or intermediate-risk PC had little 
or no increased risk of AD (HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.03-1.18) or VaD (0.90; 
0.83-0.98). Men with AD or VaD had lower odds of high-risk PC (OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 
0.35-0.45, and 0.36; 0.30-0.42, respectively) and low- or intermediate-risk PC 
(0.30; 0.25-0.36, and 0.30; 0.24-0.38, respectively). This study was limited to 
Sweden and will need replication when feasible.
CONCLUSIONS: In a large national study, men with high-risk PC treated with ADT 
had higher risks of AD and VaD. Such men should be monitored for timely 
detection and treatment of dementia. In contrast, men with AD or VaD had a lower 
subsequent risk of PC, possibly reflecting reduced screening in these subgroups.

INTRODUCTION: The complex process of amyloid-β (Aβ) transportation across the 
blood-brain and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barriers is crucial for preventing Aβ 
accumulation, which linked to dementia and neurodegeneration. This review 
explores therapeutic plasma exchange with albumin replacement in Alzheimer's 
disease, based on the dynamics of amyloid-β between the brain, plasma, and 
cerebrospinal fluid.
METHODOLOGY: A comprehensive literature review was conducted using 
PubMed/Medline, Cochrane Library, and open databases (bioRxiv, MedRixv, 
preprint.org) up to April 30, 2023. The first search utilized the following MeSH 
terms and keywords: 'Plasma Exchange', 'Plasmapheresis', 'Therapeutic plasma 
exchange', 'Apheresis', 'Aβ', 'p-tau', 'Total-tau', 'Alzheimer's disease', 
'Cognitive dysfunction', 'neurodegenerative diseases', 'centrifugation', 
'membranous', and 'filtration' in the Title/Abstract, yielding 146 results. A 
second search with the keywords: 'Albumin', 'Aβ', 'BBB', 'Alzheimer's dementia', 
and 'Nerve degeneration' resulted in 125 additional articles for analysis. 
Finally, a third search using keywords: 'Albumin structural domains', 
'Albumin-Aβ interactions', 'Albumin-endothelial interactions', and 
'Post-Translational Modification' produced 193 results for further review.
RESULTS/DISCUSSION: Therapeutic plasma exchange shows potential as a 
disease-modifying therapy for dementia, specifically for Alzheimer's disease. 
Additionally, the promising role of albumin supplementation in cognitive 
improvement has attracted attention. However, clinical evidence supporting 
therapeutic plasma exchange for dementia remains limited, necessitating further 
research and development to mitigate potential adverse effects. A deeper 
understanding of the molecular dynamics of Aβ transportation and the mechanisms 
of therapeutic plasma exchange is essential. A critical evaluation of existing 
evidence highlights the importance of balancing potential benefits with 
associated risks, which will guide the development and application of these 
treatments in neurodegenerative diseases.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) spectrum is increasingly recognized as a progressive 
network-disconnection syndrome. Neuroimaging studies using graph theoretical 
analysis (GTA) have reported alterations in the topological properties of 
whole-brain structural and functional connectomes in both preclinical AD and AD 
patients, though findings remain inconsistent. This study aimed to identify 
robust changes in multimodal GTA metrics across the AD spectrum through a 
comprehensive literature search and Bayesian random-effects meta-analyses. The 
analysis included 53 studies (37 functional and 17 structural), involving 1649 
AD patients, 1455 preclinical AD patients, and 1771 healthy controls (HC). 
Results revealed lower structural network integration (evidenced by higher 
characteristic path length and/or normalized characteristic path length) and 
segregation (evidenced by lower clustering coefficient and local efficiency) in 
AD and preclinical AD patients compared to HC. Functional network segregation 
was also lower in AD patients, while preclinical AD showed preserved functional 
topology despite structural changes. Moderator analyses identified potential 
methodological moderators, including neuroimaging technique, node and edge 
definitions, and network type, although further validation is needed. These 
findings support the progressive disconnection hypothesis in the AD spectrum and 
suggest that structural network alterations may precede functional network 
changes. Furthermore, the results help clarify inconsistencies in previous 
studies and highlight the utility of graph-based metrics as biomarkers for 
staging AD progression.

Progressive neuronal loss is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases including 
Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), 
which cause cognitive and motor impairment. Delaying the onset and course of 
symptoms is largely dependent on neuroadaptation, the brain's ability to 
restructure in response to damage. The molecular, cellular, and systemic 
processes that underlie neuroadaptation are examined in this study. These 
mechanisms include gliosis, neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and changes in 
neurotrophic factors. Axonal sprouting, dendritic remodelling, and compensatory 
alterations in neurotransmitter systems are important adaptations observed in 
NDDs; nevertheless, these processes may shift to maladaptive plasticity, which 
would aid in the advancement of the illness. Amyloid and tau pathology-induced 
synaptic alterations in Alzheimer's disease emphasize compensatory network 
reconfiguration. Dopamine depletion causes a major remodelling of the basal 
ganglia in Parkinson's disease, and non-dopaminergic systems compensate. Both 
ALS and Huntington's disease rely on motor circuit rearrangement and 
transcriptional dysregulation to slow down functional deterioration. 
Neuroadaptation is, however, constrained by oxidative stress, compromised 
autophagy, and neuroinflammation, particularly in elderly populations. The goal 
of emerging therapy strategies is to improve neuroadaptation by 
pharmacologically modifying neurotrophic factors, neuroinflammation, and 
synaptic plasticity. Neurostimulation, cognitive training, and physical 
rehabilitation are instances of non-pharmacological therapies that support 
neuroplasticity. Restoring compensating systems may be possible with the use of 
stem cell techniques and new gene treatments. The goal of future research is to 
combine biomarkers and individualized medicines to maximize neuroadaptive 
responses and decrease the course of illness. In order to reduce 
neurodegeneration and enhance patient outcomes, this review highlights the dual 
function of neuroadaptation in NDDs and its potential as a therapeutic target.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by 
cognitive and behavioral impairments. Despite extensive research into the 
pathogenesis of AD, there is still a lack of effective clinical treatments 
drugs. In this study, we identified calmodulin (CaM) as a key molecule in the 
pathological process of AD through bioinformatics analysis and innovatively 
designed a peptide, TI-16, based on the binding specificity between CaM and 
amyloid-β (Aβ). We evaluated the improvement effect of TI-16 on the activity and 
apoptosis of Aβ25-35-induced SHSY5Y cells damage by Cell Counting Kit 8 (CCK-8) 
and Flow cytometry. MOE molecular docking and GST pull-down experiments 
demonstrated that TI-16 possesses binding affinity for Aβ, and 
Immunofluorescence staining and Ca2+ concentration determination experiments 
showed that TI-16 reduced the co-localization of Aβ and CaM, and could inhibit 
intracellular calcium overload. Subsequently, Morris water maze tests were 
conducted to assess the impact of TI-16 on learning and memory abilities in AD 
model mice. Furthermore, HE staining, ThS staining, and Western blot analysis 
were utilized to investigate the improvement effect of TI-16 on the pathological 
damage of AD. The results indicate that TI-16 can target Aβ to increase the 
intracellular free concentration of CaM, and effectively regulate intracellular 
Ca2+ homeostasis. Notably, TI-16 significantly enhanced cognitive function in AD 
model mice, reduced Aβ deposition, alleviated neuronal damage, inhibited 
neuronal apoptosis, and thereby improved AD progression. As a potentially 
effective peptide therapeutic drug for AD, TI-16 offers a novel target and 
introduces a fresh perspective for future clinical applications.

Astragalus membranaceus is a versatile plant resource that can be used for both 
medicinal and food purposes. The stems and leaves of A.membranaceus (AMSL), 
which are by-products generated during the processing of its medicinal roots, 
are commonly reused as a feed additive for animals. Given the rising prevalence 
of memory impairment, particularly in aging populations and neurodegenerative 
diseases like Alzheimer's, identifying novel therapeutic agents to alleviate 
cognitive deficits is of critical importance. This study aimed to explore the 
therapeutic effects and mechanisms of AMSL in alleviating memory impairment, as 
well as to identify its active ingredients responsible for such effects. Using a 
mouse model of memory deficits induced by D-gal combined with AlCl₃, it was 
demonstrated that AMSL significantly alleviated memory impairment. Meanwhile, 
through a combination of multiple chromatographic techniques along with LC-MS 
and NMR spectroscopy, ten new triterpenoids (1-10) coupled with six analogues 
(11-16) were isolated, purified, and identified from AMSL. Notably, compounds 1 
and 12 were found to attenuate inflammatory responses-evidenced by reduction in 
pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α and to inhibit apoptotic 
pathways, as reflected by downregulated expression of Caspase-3, Bax, and 
Cytochrome C in PC12 cells induced by Aβ25-35. These findings provide valuable 
insights into the potential applications of AMSL in neuroprotective 
interventions and highlight its potential as a therapeutic agent for 
memory-related disorders.

BACKGROUND: Berbamine (BBM), a natural bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid, has 
demonstrated promising effects in ameliorating pathological process and 
inflammation response in central neuronal system (CNS). Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), primarily characterized by amyloid-beta (Aβ)-containing extra-cellular 
plaques and abnormal "autophagy-brake regulation" of neuroinflammation, 
currently lacks of effective therapeutic options. Therapeutics of BBM on AD is 
indeed intriguing, and the potential targets and mechanisms are vague yet.
PURPOSE: This study is designed to elucidate the therapeutic potential of BBM on 
AD, focusing particularly on its ability to enhance autophagy, induce microglial 
M2 polarization, and to uncover the underlying molecular mechanisms and 
implicated targets.
METHODS: The therapeutic efficacy of BBM was systematically investigated in 
APP/PS1 mice, with a focus on its potential to enhance autophagy, induce M2 
polarization in microglia, and facilitate the clearance of Aβ plaques. Cognitive 
function was rigorously assessed through a series of behavioral tests, including 
the Morris Water Maze and Object Location Task. Immunofluorescence was employed 
to visualize the spatial distribution of inflammatory cytokines and autophagic 
markers within the brain parenchyma. Quantitative measurements of these 
cytokines were obtained using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Western 
blotting was utilized to analyze protein profiles associated with autophagy and 
microglial phenotypes. Additionally, chemo-proteomics and molecular docking 
techniques were applied to identify the key molecular targets of BBM.
RESULTS: BBM treatment significantly ameliorated cognitive dysfunction and 
reduced Aβ plaque deposition in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Notably, BBM promoted 
microglial polarization from the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype to the 
anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype, accompanied by attenuation of neuroinflammation. 
Mechanistically, BBM exerted its effects through inhibition of mTOR signaling 
via direct interaction with the FKBP12-rapamycin-binding domain, thereby 
restoring autophagic flux and facilitating M2 microglial polarization. The mTOR 
activator MHY1485 abrogated the beneficial effects of BBM, highlighting the 
pivotal role of mTOR inhibition in its mechanism of action.
CONCLUSIONS: BBM promotes M2 microglial polarization and restores autophagic 
flux in AD by inhibiting mTOR signaling, representing a novel dual-modulatory 
mechanism for AD intervention. These findings highlight BBM's ability to target 
mTOR and intersecting pathways, offering a promising disease-modifying 
therapeutic approach for AD and other neurodegenerative disorders.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of animal-assisted rehabilitation 
interventions on symptom management in Alzheimer's disease patients.
METHODS: This study is a systematic review and meta-analysis based on PRISMA 
2022 guidelines, which adhered to the Cochrane 2021 guidelines. Databases 
including PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library were searched between 
February 1, 2023, and November 28, 2023. Two authors independently assessed the 
risk of bias using the Cochrane Collaboration tool. Review Manager 5.4.1 
software was utilized for the meta-analysis.
RESULTS: Six randomized controlled trials were included. This meta-analysis 
demonstrated that animal-assisted rehabilitation interventions significantly 
impacted physical outcomes, such as improving physical competence and 
independence in basic daily living activities, as well as psychological 
outcomes, including reducing depression and enhancing mini-mental state 
examination scores in Alzheimer's patients.
CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis revealed that animal-assisted rehabilitation 
interventions effectively reduce cognitive decline and depression symptoms in 
Alzheimer's patients.

BACKGROUND: Improving self-management ability can not only improve blood glucose 
control but also improve cognitive function. The current research on 
self-management only focuses on individual diseases, and the degree of 
personalization is insufficient.
METHODS: A total of 68 participants were recruited and randomly assigned to a 12 
week Stratified Support Pattern-based Internet-assisted Self-management Therapy 
(SISMT ) intervention group or control group.
RESULT: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCa) and Fasting Blood Sugar (FBS) 
with mild cognitive impairment associated with diabetes-mellitus (DM-MCI) was 
statistically significant. For the Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT) were 
statistically significant. The Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) that 
reflected attention of DM-MCI was also statistically significant. For the 
psychological outcomes, Self-Assessment Scale for Anxiety (SAS), General 
Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES) , Self-Efficacy Scale (SES) , Memorial University of 
Newfoundland Scale of Happiness (MUNSH) were statistically significant. The 
effect of SISMT on the Quality of Life Alzheimer's Disease (QoL-AD) , Diabetes 
Self-care Scale (DSCS) , Health Literacy Scale (HLS) were statistically 
significant. The effect of intervention on the Glycated Hemoglobin (HbA1C) , 
Postprandial Plasma Glucose (PPG) with DM-MCI were not statistically 
significant.
CONCLUSION: The SISMT can improve fasting blood glucose, cognitive function, 
anxiety, quality of life, subjective well-being, and other indicators in 
patients.

OBJECTIVE: The implications of cerebellar pathology on clinical disease 
progression in multiple sclerosis (MS) remain unclear. This study investigated 
regional cerebellar atrophy related to physical disability and cognitive 
impairment progression.
METHODS: We included 331 MS patients and 95 controls (Amsterdam MS Cohort, 229 
patients and 58 controls re-evaluated after 5 years). Assessments included 
baseline MRI, and disability and cognition at baseline and follow up. Cerebellar 
(sub)cortex was parcellated, volumetric data were determined and related to 
baseline disability and cognition. Longitudinal progression was explored only 
for regions with significant baseline correlations.
RESULTS: At baseline, patients had mild disability (median EDSS 3.0) and 46% 
showing mild-to-severe cognitive impairment. At follow-up, 34.5% showed EDSS 
progression and 26.6% cognitive decline. All global and most regional volumes 
showed atrophy. Cross-sectionally, atrophy of several regions encompassing both 
anterior and posterior lobes correlated with both disability and cognition, 
while some correlated with EDSS only. Additionally, cerebellar nuclei only 
correlated with cognition. Cerebellar volumes were mainly related to information 
processing speed, working and verbal memory. Longitudinally, atrophy in the 
posterior lobe, lobule VI and VIIIb, and vermis VI, correlated with cognitive 
decline, while no variables correlated with disability progression.
CONCLUSION: Regional cerebellar atrophy in both anterior and posterior lobes 
correlated with disability and cognitive impairment. Posterior regional atrophy 
was correlated with longitudinal cognitive decline, but none correlated with 
disability progression. Further research is required to elucidate these 
relationships.

Whether or not neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in advance of dementia are 
associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and/or other neurodegenerative 
dementias remains to be determined. The mild behavioural impairment (MBI) 
construct selects persons with NPS that are later-life emergent and persistent 
to identify a high-risk group for cognitive decline and incident dementia. Here, 
in older adults without dementia at baseline, we examined whether post-mortem AD 
and other neurodegenerative pathologies were associated with MBI in the 5 years 
before death. National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center study autopsy 
participants (n = 1016, 82.6 years of age, 48.7% female, 60% normal cognition) 
were included in the analyses. Using the Neuropsychiatric 
Inventory-Questionnaire, MBI+ status was operationalized as NPS persistence at 
more than two-thirds of pre-dementia study visits; otherwise, status was non-MBI 
NPS. The presence of AD, Lewy body disease (LBD) and transactive response 
DNA-binding protein 43 neuropathological changes was determined using published 
guidelines. Adjusted multinomial logistic regressions modelled pathology-NPS 
status associations. Adjusted Cox proportional hazards regressions modelled 
hazard for AD dementia at each NPS status level, including interaction terms 
with cognitive status and each co-pathology. AD+ individuals (51.4%) were 88.4% 
more likely to be MBI+ ∼5 years prior than AD- individuals [odds ratio: 1.88, 
95% confidence interval (CI): 1.29-2.75, P < 0.01]; however, the likelihood of 
having non-MBI NPS was not different (odds ratio: 1.22, CI: 0.90-1.66, P = 
0.20). No significant associations were seen for LBD pathology, even among AD+ 
participants. There were no significant differences in the levels of LBD or 
transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 in those with MBI in comparison to 
no MBI. Among MBI progressors to dementia (n = 106), 33.0% were solely AD+, 
18.9% were mixed AD+ and LBD+, and 11.3% had all three pathologies. For all 
those with MBI (including dementia non-progressors), of persons with LBD, 83.4% 
were comorbid with AD. In the survival analysis, MBI+ individuals had a 
2.03-fold greater progression rate to AD dementia than those without NPS (CI: 
1.60-2.57, P < 0.01). The progression rate was higher in mild cognitive 
impairment , but the effect of MBI on progression was greater in normal 
cognition (hazard ratio: 3.05, CI: 1.37-6.80, P < 0.01) versus mild cognitive 
impairment (hazard ratio: 1.93, CI: 1.51-2.47, P < 0.01). Limbic LBD appeared 
also to moderate the association between MBI and incident AD (limbic LBD+ hazard 
ratio: 4.64, CI: 2.05-10.50, P < 0.001; limbic LBD- hazard ratio: 1.87, CI: 
1.46-2.40, P < 0.001). Antecedent MBI was strongly associated with AD pathology 
but not with other neurodegenerative dementias. Inclusion of MBI in research and 
clinical frameworks for dementia might aid in identification of early stages of 
neurodegenerative disease, which might be helpful for selecting patients for 
treatment with AD-modifying drugs.

Recent reports suggest dysregulation of the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA 
modification may contribute to the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases. 
Herein, we show the m6A methyltransferase complex including METTL3-the catalytic 
component of the nuclear-localized complex-is robustly upregulated in human 
microglia and astrocytes exposed to αSynf and Mn. Subcellular localization 
studies reveal METTL3 was predominantly cytoplasmic following Mn insult but 
remained nuclear following αSynf stimulation in activated microglia. Functional 
analysis revealed METTL3 and downstream m6A readers, including YTHDF2 and 
IGF2BP1-3, may regulate the proinflammatory secretome of activated microglia. 
Notably, methyltransferase activity and m6A abundance were significantly 
increased following Mn and αSynf treatment. METTL3 in Mn and αSynfin vivo models 
of neuroinflammation, along with human postmortem tissues from Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) 
patients, was significantly upregulated. This was further confirmed by 
single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis. Overall, we demonstrate the m6A 
writer METTL3 may function as a major regulator of chronic neuroinflammation in 
synucleinopathies.

Aging is a slow and irreversible biological process leading to decreased cell 
and tissue functions with higher risks of multiple age-related diseases, 
including neurodegenerative diseases. It is widely accepted that aging 
represents the leading risk factor for neurodegeneration. The pathogenesis of 
these diseases involves complex interactions of genetic mutations, environmental 
factors, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction, 
which complicate treatment with traditional mono-targeted therapies. Network 
pharmacology can help identify potential gene or protein targets related to 
neurodegenerative diseases. Integrating advanced molecular profiling 
technologies and computer-aided drug design further enhances the potential of 
network pharmacology, enabling the identification of biomarkers and therapeutic 
targets, thus paving the way for precision medicine in neurodegenerative 
diseases. This review article delves into the application of network 
pharmacology in understanding and treating neurodegenerative disorders such as 
Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 
Huntington's disease, and spinal muscular atrophy. Overall, this article 
emphasizes the importance of addressing aging as a central factor in developing 
effective disease-modifying therapies, highlighting how network pharmacology can 
unravel the complex biological networks associated with aging and pave the way 
for personalized medical strategies.

Alzheimer's disease, a complex and progressive neurological disorder, is the 
leading cause of late-life dementia. Pathologically, it is marked by the 
presence of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. Over the 
past two decades, advancements in understanding the disease's pathogenesis have 
spurred research into new pharmacological treatments that target its underlying 
mechanisms. Currently available drugs, such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors 
(rivastigmine, galantamine, donepezil) and the NMDA receptor antagonist 
memantine, primarily address symptoms and are effective only in the later stages 
of the disease. While these medications can slow disease progression and provide 
symptomatic relief, they do not offer a cure. Despite having a clear 
understanding of Alzheimer's neuropathology, the precise mechanisms driving the 
disease remain elusive. The lack of effective treatments that can stop the start 
and progression of the disease may be caused by our incomplete understanding of 
the pathogenic process. New therapeutic targets are now available due to the 
significant advancements made in pathophysiology over the past few years, which 
should allow for a direct attack on the underlying illness process. The various 
pathophysiological pathways that underlie Alzheimer's disease and how it is 
managed by conventional medication therapy, including current exploratory 
therapeutic options, are covered in this review article. Innovative, beneficial 
policies are essential to determine and progress therapeutic molecules to defend 
against AD.

Background/aim: A growing body of evidence suggests a link between dyslipidemias 
and neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting the crucial role of lipid 
metabolism in the health of the central nervous system. The aim of our work was 
to provide an update on this topic, with a focus on clinical practice from an 
endocrinological point of view. Endocrinologists, being experts in the 
management of dyslipidemias, can play a key role in the prevention and treatment 
of neurodegenerative conditions, through precocious and effective lipid profile 
optimization. Methods: The literature was scanned to identify clinical trials 
and correlation studies on the association between dyslipidemia, statin therapy, 
and the following neurodegenerative diseases: Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
Parkisons's disease (PD), Multiple sclerosis (MS), and Amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis (ALS). Results: Impaired lipid homeostasis, such as that frequently 
observed in patients affected by obesity and diabetes, is related to 
neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD, PD, and other cognitive deficits related 
to aging. AD and related dementias are now a real priority health problem. In 
the United States, there are approximately 7 million subjects aged 65 and older 
living with AD and related dementias, and this number is projected to grow to 12 
million in the coming decades. Lipid-lowering therapy with statins is an 
effective strategy in reducing serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to 
normal range concentrations and, therefore, cardiovascular disease risk; 
moreover, statins have been reported to have a positive effect on 
neurodegenerative diseases. Conclusions: Several pieces of research have found 
inconsistent information following our review. There was no association between 
statin use and ALS incidence. More positive evidence has emerged regarding 
statin use and AD/PD. However, further large-scale prospective randomized 
control trials are required to properly understand this issue.

Parasitic diseases pose a serious threat to the health of humans and the steady 
development of livestock husbandry. Although there are certain drug-based 
treatment methods, with the widespread application of drugs, various parasites 
are gradually developing drug resistance. Natural products are highly favored by 
researchers due to their characteristics such as low toxicity, multi-target 
effects, and low risk of drug resistance. The ocean, as the largest treasure 
trove of biological resources on Earth, has a special ecosystem (high pressure, 
high salt, and low oxygen). This enables marine organisms to develop a large 
number of unique structures during their survival competition. So far, a variety 
of compounds, such as terpenoids, have been isolated from the algae. As 
potential drugs, these compounds have certain curative effects on various 
diseases, including tumors, parasitic diseases, Alzheimer's disease, and 
tuberculosis. This paper systematically reviews and analyzes the current 
advances in research on the antiparasite effects of seaweed extracts. The 
primary objective of this research is to formulate a conceptual foundation for 
marine pharmaceutical exploration, focusing on the creation of innovative 
marine-based medicinal compounds to overcome the emerging problem of parasite 
resistance to conventional treatments.

Numerous epidemiological studies indicate that populations exposed to 
environmental toxicants such as heavy metals have a higher likelihood of 
developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared to those unexposed, indicating a 
potential association between heavy metals exposure and AD. The aim of this 
review is to summarize contemporary mechanistic research exploring the 
associations of four important metals, arsenic (As), manganese (Mn), lead (Pb), 
and cadmium (Cd), with AD and possible pathways, processes, and molecular 
mechanisms on the basis of data from the most recent mechanistic studies. 
Primary research publications published during the last decade were identified 
via a search of the PubMed Database. A thorough literature search and final 
screening yielded 45 original research articles for this review. Of the 45 
research articles, 6 pertain to As, 9 to Mn, 21 to Pb, and 9 to Cd exposures and 
AD pathobiology. Environmental exposure to these heavy metals induces a wide 
range of pathological processes that intersect with well-known mechanisms 
leading to AD, such as oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, protein 
aggregation, neuroinflammation, autophagy dysfunction, and tau 
hyperphosphorylation. While exposure to single metals shares some affected 
pathways, certain effects are unique to specific metals. For instance, Pb 
disrupts the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and mitochondrial functions and alters 
AD-related genes epigenetically. Cd triggers neuronal senescence via p53/p21/Rb. 
As disrupts nitric oxide (NO) signaling, cortical, and synaptic function. Mn 
causes glutamate excitotoxicity and dopamine neuron damage. Our review provides 
a deeper understanding of biological mechanisms showing how metals contribute to 
AD. Information regarding the potential metal-induced toxicity relevant to AD 
may help us develop effective therapeutic AD intervention, treatment, and 
prevention.

Vascular dementia (VaD) is a heterogeneous group of brain disorders caused by 
cerebrovascular pathologies and the second most common cause of dementia, 
accounting for over 20% of cases and posing an important global health concern. 
VaD can be caused by cerebral infarction or injury in critical brain regions, 
including the speech area of the dominant hemisphere or arcuate fasciculus of 
the dominant hemisphere, leading to notable cognitive impairment. Although the 
exact causes of dementia remain multifactorial and complex, oxidative stress 
(reactive oxygen species), neuroinflammation (TNFα, IL-6, and IL-1β), and 
inflammasomes are considered central mechanisms in its pathology. These 
conditions contribute to neuronal damage, synaptic dysfunction, and cognitive 
decline. Thus, antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents have emerged as 
potential therapeutic targets in dementia. Recent studies emphasize that 
cerebrovascular disease plays a dual role: first, as a primary cause of 
cognitive impairment and then as a contributor to the manifestation of dementia 
driven by other factors, such as Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative 
conditions. This comprehensive review of VaD focuses on molecular mechanisms and 
their consequences. We provided up-to-date knowledge about epidemiology, 
pathophysiological mechanisms, and current therapeutic approaches for VaD.

Natural Products in the Treatment of Neuroinflammation at Microglia: Recent 
Trend and Features.

Natural products (NPs) are considered to be the oldest medicine in human history 
and numerous NPs have been investigated to search for therapeutic agents in 
various diseases. Neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia, Parkinson's, 
Alzheimer's, and Huntington's disease have been increasing following the 
extension of human lifespans. Neuroinflammation is a key factor in the genesis 
of several neurodegenerative diseases; therefore, many studies have been focused 
on finding therapeutics for the reduction in neuroinflammation. Microglia cells 
are found in the central nervous system (CNS) and these play a crucial role in 
the regulation of neuroinflammation; thus, the importance of microglia research 
has been recognized. This review focuses on recent research trends in finding 
neuroinflammatory regulators in microglia by using NPs.

We here present evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of 
migraine. These guidelines, created by the Italian Society for the Study of 
Headache and the International Headache Society, aim to offer clear, actionable 
recommendations to healthcare professionals. They incorporate evidence-based 
recommendations from randomized controlled trials and expert-based opinions. The 
guidelines follow the GRADE approach for assessing the quality of evidence. The 
guideline development involved a systematic review of literature across multiple 
databases, adherence to Cochrane review methods, and a structured framework for 
data extraction and interpretation. Although the guidelines provide a robust 
foundation for migraine treatment, they also highlight gaps in current research, 
such as the paucity of head-to-head drug comparisons and the need for long-term 
outcome studies. These guidelines serve as a resource to standardize migraine 
treatment and promote high-quality care across different healthcare settings.

We here present evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of 
migraine. These guidelines, created by the Italian Society for the Study of 
Headache and the International Headache Society, aim to offer clear, actionable 
recommendations to healthcare professionals. They incorporate evidence-based 
recommendations from randomized controlled trials and expert-based opinions. The 
guidelines follow the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and 
Evaluation approach for assessing the quality of evidence. The guideline 
development involved a systematic review of literature across multiple 
databases, adherence to Cochrane review methods, and a structured framework for 
data extraction and interpretation. Although the guidelines provide a robust 
foundation for migraine treatment, they also highlight gaps in current research, 
such as the paucity of head-to-head drug comparisons and the need for long-term 
outcome studies. These guidelines serve as a resource to standardize migraine 
treatment and promote high-quality care across different healthcare settings.

INTRODUCTION: Sex differences are apparent in neurodegenerative diseases but 
have not been comprehensively characterized in frontotemporal dementia (FTD).
METHODS: Participants included 337 adults with autosomal dominant FTD enrolled 
in the ALLFTD Consortium. Clinical assessments and plasma were collected 
annually for up to 6 years. Linear mixed-effects models investigated how sex and 
disease stage are associated with longitudinal trajectories of cognition, 
function, and neurofilament light chain (NfL).
RESULTS: While sex differences were not apparent at asymptomatic stages, females 
showed more rapid declines across all outcomes in symptomatic stages compared to 
males. In asymptomatic participants, the association between baseline NfL and 
clinical trajectories was weaker in females versus males, a difference that was 
not present in symptomatic participants.
DISCUSSION: In genetic FTD, females show cognitive resilience in early disease 
stages followed by steeper clinical declines later in the disease. Baseline NfL 
may be a less sensitive prognostic tool for clinical progression in females with 
FTD-causing mutations.
HIGHLIGHTS: Females with genetic FTD exhibit overall steeper increases in plasma 
neurofilament light chain (NfL) than males. Females with genetic FTD outperform 
NfL levels in asymptomatic stages compared to males. Once symptomatic, females 
with genetic FTD decline more rapidly than males. Plasma NfL is a stronger 
prognostic marker in asymptomatic males than females.

Olfactory loss affects more than 12% of the population, with prevalence 
increasing in aging individuals. Multiple conditions can lead to a loss of smell 
(hyposmia or anosmia), including post-viral damage from coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19) or influenza, head injuries, sinusitis, or neurodegenerative 
conditions such as Alzheimer or Parkinson disease. Although treatments like 
surgery, anti-inflammatory medications, or olfactory training can be beneficial 
in certain cases, there remains an unmet need for effective therapies addressing 
many common causes of olfactory dysfunction. This is particularly true for cases 
attributed to damage of olfactory neurons that fail to spontaneously recover. 
Regenerative medicine approaches, aimed at either stimulating the regrowth of 
sensory neural structures or replacing them through cell-based therapies, have 
attracted considerable interest for treating various neurological disorders, 
including olfactory loss. Here, we summarize the intrinsic regenerative 
capabilities of the peripheral olfactory system, focusing on current research 
strategies and the existing barriers that must be overcome for successful 
translational applications. A major unmet need in this field involves the 
establishment of reliable and widely accepted culture models for expanding and 
differentiating olfactory stem or progenitor cells from rodents and humans, both 
for use in vitro assays and as potential material for cell-based therapies.

There are no effective curative treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD), the 
most prevalent form of dementia. Amyloid-beta (Aβ) oligomers are considered key 
neurotoxic molecules that trigger AD. Recent studies have shown that direct 
antibody targeting of Aβ oligomers is beneficial for early AD patients; however, 
serious side effects (e.g., brain hemorrhage, edema, and shrinkage) persist. 
Considering that Aβ oligomers readily bind to other proteins, contributing to 
neurotoxicity and AD onset, those proteins could represent alternative 
therapeutic targets. However, proteins that bind to Aβ oligomers in the brains 
of AD patients have not yet been identified. In this study, we identified four 
proteins (DDX6, DSP, JUP, and HRNR) that bind to Aβ oligomers derived from the 
brains of AD patients. Intriguingly, among these four proteins, only the 
blockade of DEAD-box helicase 6 (DDX6) in human-derived Aβ oligomers attenuated 
their neurotoxicity both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic analysis revealed 
that DDX6 promotes the formation of Aβ oligomers, likely due to DDX6 bind to Aβ 
oligomers at four distinct sites. These findings suggest that DDX6 could serve 
as a potential therapeutic target to reduce the neurotoxicity of Aβ oligomers in 
the brain and prevent the progression of AD.

We elucidate that the cerebellum displays striking resilience to 
neurodegenerative changes under aging or Alzheimer's disease (AD). We identify 
the neurobiological factors that underlie the natural neuroprotective 
characteristic of cerebellum, thereby obtaining innovative therapeutic 
directions that may duplicate this naturalistic neurorestorative response. We 
investigated the mass spectrometry/liquid chromatography-based proteomics 
profile from AD tissue: sparely affected cerebellum and highly affected 
hippocampus/cingulate/entorhinal cortex. We found 83 upregulated and 37 
downregulated cerebellar genes. Top five upregulated genes were GAP43 
(hub-gene), APLP1, NCAM1, THY1, SNCB; these encode for neurorestorative 
processes, as axonal, dendritic, and myelination growth. Contrastingly, the top 
five downregulated genes were NDUFS8 (hub-gene), NDUFA9, NDUFU2, NDUFA12, 
NDUFV1. These encode for NADH-dehydrogenase subunit in mitochondria; their 
increased expression relates to mitochondrial-based ROS stress-based apoptosis; 
hence, their downregulation reduces apoptosis, reinforcing neural survival. 
Indeed, cerebellum displays unique neuroprotection, by coupling of two 
reciprocal cytometabolic fluxes: (1) hyperactivation of neural anabolic 
processing, as neuronal growth, and (2) hypoactivation of neural catabolic 
processing, as mitochondrial caspase-induced neural degradation. Hence, for 
inducing the endogenous neuroprotective response, one needs to pharmacologically 
modulate both these cytometabolic processes: (i) agonism of neural synaptotropic 
anabolic pathway, coupled to (ii) antagonism of mitochondrial catabolic 
neurotoxic pathway. We also observed that synaptic efficiency-encoding genes 
constitute majority (70%) of upregulated cerebellar genes. We noted 
the unexpected observations, namely that (a) the neuron is the most pivotal 
factor for the restorative response than any type of glial or other cells, (b) 
with respect to the neuron, the synaptogenesis process is much more critical 
than the neurogenesis process, and (c) collaterally, the hypomodulation of the 
mitochondrial NADHD ubiquinone activity is the key factor. A unique significance 
is that a naturally occurring neurorestorative response may be therapeutically 
harnessed in neurons, minimizing off-target effects that are often hazardous 
disadvantages of conventional dementia therapeutics.

INTRODUCTION: Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by progressive degeneration of the frontal and temporal lobes, 
leading to significant changes in personality, behavior, and language abilities. 
Early and accurate differential diagnosis between FTD, its subtypes, and other 
dementias, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), is crucial for appropriate 
treatment planning and patient care. Machine learning (ML) techniques have shown 
promise in enhancing diagnostic accuracy by identifying complex patterns in 
clinical and neuroimaging data that are not easily discernible through 
conventional analysis.
METHODS: This systematic review, following PRISMA guidelines and registered in 
PROSPERO, aimed to assess the strengths and limitations of current ML models 
used in differentiating FTD from other neurological disorders. A comprehensive 
literature search from 2013 to 2024 identified 25 eligible studies involving 
6,544 patients with dementia, including 2,984 with FTD, 3,437 with AD, 103 mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) and 20 Parkinson's disease dementia or probable 
dementia with Lewy bodies (PDD/DLBPD).
RESULTS: The review found that Support Vector Machines (SVMs) were the most 
frequently used ML technique, often applied to neuroimaging and 
electrophysiological data. Deep learning methods, particularly convolutional 
neural networks (CNNs), have also been increasingly adopted, demonstrating high 
accuracy in distinguishing FTD from other dementias. The integration of 
multimodal data, including neuroimaging, EEG signals, and neuropsychological 
assessments, has been suggested to enhance diagnostic accuracy.
DISCUSSION: ML techniques showed strong potential for improving FTD diagnosis, 
but challenges like small sample sizes, class imbalance, and lack of 
standardization limit generalizability. Future research should prioritize the 
development of standardized protocols, larger datasets, and explainable AI 
techniques to facilitate the integration of ML-based tools into real-world 
clinical practice.

Abnormal accumulation of tau proteins in the brain is a hallmark of 
neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and is closely linked 
with neuronal cell death. Tau accumulation is a prominent therapeutic target for 
Alzheimer's disease, since tau accumulation correlates well with the disease 
progression, and tau-targeting drugs hold potentials to halt the disease 
progression. Given the differential response of human and mouse neuronal cells, 
there is a critical need for a human cellular platform to quickly screen for 
tau-related neurodegenerative disease therapeutics. However, inducing rapid, 
tau-dependent neuronal cell death in human models remains challenging. In this 
study, we established a human cellular model capable of inducing tau 
aggregation-dependent neuronal cell death within two weeks via tau 
overexpression. Additionally, we demonstrated the neuroprotective efficacy of 
known tau-targeting compounds within this system. These findings suggest that 
our cellular model recapitulates the molecular pathogenesis of tau-induced 
neurodegeneration and could serve as a valuable platform for drug screening in 
tauopathies.

INTRODUCTION:  Older age is a major risk factor for many neurocognitive 
disorders like Alzheimer's disease. While there are limited treatment options 
for improving memory in this population, research has shown that special 
psychotherapeutic modalities like Cognitive Remediation Therapy (CRT), 
especially when coupled with psychosocial and vocational rehabilitation (PSR and 
VCR respectively), benefit older adults. This study examines the availability of 
these services in US mental health (MH) facilities serving older adults and 
compares the characteristics of the facilities providing these services.
METHODS: Our study includes 1216 MH facilities using the 2022 National Substance 
Use and Mental Health Services Survey (N-SUMHSS) data from the Substance Abuse 
and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). Descriptive statistics were 
used to determine availabilities, while multivariable logistic regression was 
used to compare facilities that offer the services compared to those that do 
not.
RESULTS: Of the total facilities included, 78 (6%), 634 (52%), and 381 (31%) 
offered CRT, PSR, and VCR respectively. Facilities that provided only MH 
services compared to those providing substance use and MH services, those that 
offer special services for veterans, and special Alzheimer's programs compared 
to those that do not were more likely to have CRT services. MH facilities that 
provide supplemental employment services, housing services and recovery housing 
were more likely to offer PSR and VCR compared to those that do not. Compared to 
facilities in Midwest states, facilities in East South-Central were less likely 
to offer PSR and VCR.
CONCLUSION: This study highlights the relative unavailability of CRT, indicating 
a need for more interest in evidence-based nonpharmacological treatment options 
for cognitive decline in the aging population.

    medRxiv. 2024 Nov 02:2024.10.31.24316469. doi: 10.1101/2024.10.31.24316469.

BACKGROUND: All individuals with Down syndrome (DS) will develop full-blown 
Alzheimer´s disease (AD) pathology by age 40. Several genes encoded in 
chromosome 21, including dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated 
kinase 1A (DYRK1A), have been proven to contribute to the pathology. 
Phosphorylation of tau at threonine-212 (p-tau212) is very sensitive to DYRK1A 
phosphorylation and is increased in DSAD brain lysates. Here, we assessed the 
potential of this biomarker in DSAD and sporadic AD.
METHODS: Using single molecule array (Simoa) technology, we tested p-tau212 and 
p-tau181 (n = 245 for plasma, n = 114 matching cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] 
samples).
RESULTS: We have confirmed that the levels of plasma p-tau212 are increased in 
the DS population and sporadic AD cases, including prodromal and mild cognitive 
impairment states. Plasma p-tau212 started increasing approximately when people 
became amyloid positron emission tomography positive.
DISCUSSION: Plasma p-tau212 might have utility for theragnostics, monitoring 
therapy efficacy, and as a target engagement biomarker in clinical trials both 
in sporadic and DSAD.
HIGHLIGHTS: Plasma p-tau212 is increased in the Down syndrome (DS) population. 
Plasma p-tau212 increases ≈15 years before the disease onset in DSAD. Plasma 
p-tau212 accurately differentiates between control and disease groups. Plasma 
p-tau212 accurately differentiates amyloid beta (Aβ)+ and Aβ- participants.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder characterized 
by significant cognitive impairment and predominantly affects the elderly. With 
no effective cure available, research continues to explore novel therapeutic and 
preventive strategies. Recently, palmitic acid-hydroxystearic acids (PAHSAs), 
especially their stereochemistry S-configuration, have shown potential as a 
dietary supplement with anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetic properties. We 
previously found that one of the PAHSAs, 9-PAHSA, could improve cognitive 
impairment in the high-fat-diet mice, however, whether it has an equal effect on 
AD-like mice remains unclear. Since mitochondrial dysfunction is recognized as a 
significant pathological feature of AD, with impaired mitophagy leading to the 
accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria, thus exacerbating disease 
progression, in this study, we evaluated the effects of the chiral isomer of 
9-PAHSA, S-9-PAHSA, on cognitive dysfunction and mitochondrial dysfunction in 
5xFAD mice. Three-month-old mice were treated with S-9-PAHSA 30 mg/kg in their 
drinking water for 3 months. Behavioral studies were conducted using the Morris 
Water Maze (MWM) and Y-maze tests, followed by assessments of amyloid-beta (Aβ) 
plaque deposition, neuronal apoptosis, and mitochondrial function. We found that 
S-9-PAHSA significantly enhanced spatial learning and memory abilities, reduced 
amyloid plaque deposition, decreased neuronal apoptosis, and improved 
mitochondrial homeostasis and autophagy in 5xFAD mice. These findings suggest 
that S-9-PAHSA holds promise as a supplementary preventive and therapeutic 
strategy for AD treatment.

The effective treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is challenging because of 
its complex and controversial pathological mechanisms. Moreover, multiple 
barriers, such as the blood-brain barrier (BBB), reduce drug delivery 
efficiency. Microglia-related neuroinflammation has recently attracted 
increasing attention as a possible cause of AD and has become a novel 
therapeutic target. Therefore, overcoming the BBB and targeted delivery of 
anti-inflammatory agents to microglia seem to be effective practical strategies 
for treating AD. A large proportion of natural active extracts possess 
exceptional immunomodulating capabilities. In this study, the cooperative 
delivery of berberine (Ber) and palmatine (Pal) by transferrin-decorated 
extracellular vesicles (Tf-hEVs-Ber/Pal), which can cross the BBB and precisely 
target microglia, was performed. This nanosystem effectively cleared amyloid 
β-protein (Aβ) aggregates, significantly regulated the neuroinflammatory 
environment both in vitro and in vivo and markedly altered the behavior and 
improved the cognitive and learning abilities of AD model mice. The efficacy of 
a microglia-targeting combined therapeutic approach for AD was demonstrated, 
which broadens the potential application of Chinese herbal ingredients.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by deficits in cognition, behavior, 
and intellectual functioning, and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) refers to 
individuals whose cognitive impairment deviates from what is expected for their 
age but does not significantly interfere with daily activities. Because there is 
no treatment for AD, early prediction of AD can be helpful to reducing the 
progression of this disease. This study examines the Electroencephalography 
(EEG) signal of 3 distinct groups, including AD, MCI, and healthy individuals. 
Recognizing the non-stationary nature of EEG signals, two nonlinear approaches, 
Poincare and Entropy, are employed for meaningful feature extraction. Data 
should be segmented into epochs to extract features from EEG signals, and 
feature extraction approaches should be implemented for each one. The obtained 
features are given to machine learning algorithms to classify the subjects. 
Extensive experiments were conducted to analyze the features comprehensively. 
The results demonstrate that our proposed method surpasses previous studies in 
terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, indicating its effectiveness in 
classifying individuals with AD, MCI, and those without cognitive impairment.

Alzheimer disease (AD) is a debilitating progressive dementia, whose 
pathophysiology is not fully understood. Chronic inflammation is now widely 
accepted as one of the key features of AD pathogenesis. Because of this, 
anti-inflammatory preparations are considered as putative disease modifying 
agents. A new compound of zinc aspartate with enriched light atoms 64Zn 
(64Zn-asp) was evaluated as a possible anti-AD agent using Aβ1-40-induced AD 
model. Intrahippocampal Aβ1-40 injection resulted in pronounced 
neuroinflammation, as was evidenced by increased phagocytic activity, augmented 
reactive oxygen species generation, and up-regulated CD86 and CD206 expression 
by microglia. In rats with Aβ1-40-induced AD, persistent systemic inflammation 
was also registered, as was ascertained by significantly increased white blood 
cell-based inflammatory indices and development of anemia of inflammation. 
Neuro- and systemic inflammation in rats was accompanied by hippocampal dopamine 
neuron loss, as well as by impairment of short-term and remote spatial memory 
and cognitive flexibility. Intravenous 64Zn-asp administration rats with AD was 
associated with returning all microglia indicators to normal range. All 
aforementioned features of systemic inflammation were not observed in these 
animals. Anti-inflammatory 64Zn-asp effect was strongly correlated with 
improvement of short-term spatial memory and cognitive flexibility, and 
moderately-with betterment of remote spatial memory. These results demonstrated 
that i.v. 64Zn-asp administration could reverse the inflammatory and, as a 
result, cognitive effects of intra-hippocampal Aβ1-40 in rats. Therefore, its 
use may be a viable approach in the complex therapeutic strategy for AD.

Amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaque formation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology is 
morphologically diverse. Understanding the association of polymorphic Aβ 
pathology with AD pathogenesis and progression is critical in light of emerging 
Aβ-targeting therapies. In this work, functional amyloid microscopy enhanced by 
deep learning was integrated with mass spectrometry imaging to delineate 
polymorphic plaques and to identify their associated Aβ make-up. In both 
sporadic AD (n = 12) and familial AD (n = 6), dense-core plaques showed higher 
levels of Aβ1-40 and N-terminal pyroglutamated Aβx-42 compared to diffuse 
plaques and plaques in non-demented, amyloid positive individuals (n = 5). 
Notably, a distinct dense-core plaque subtype, coarse-grained plaque, was 
observed in AD but not in non-demented, amyloid positive patients. 
Coarse-grained plaques were more abundant in early onset AD, showed increased 
neuritic dystrophy and higher levels of Aβ1-40 and Aβ3pE-40, an Aβ-pattern 
similar to cerebral amyloid angiopathy. The correlative chemical imaging 
paradigm presented here allowed to link structural and biochemical 
characteristics of Aβ plaque polymorphism across various AD etiologies.

Obesity, a worldwide health emergency, is defined by excessive fat accumulation 
and significantly impacts metabolic health. In addition to its recognized 
association with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and other metabolic 
illnesses, recent studies have revealed the connection between obesity and 
neurodegeneration. The main reason for this link is inflammation caused by the 
growth of fat tissue, which activates harmful processes that affect how the 
brain works. Fat tissue, particularly the fat around the organs, produces 
various substances that cause inflammation, such as cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6), 
adipokines (leptin, resistin), and free fatty acids. These chemicals cause 
low-grade, persistent systemic inflammation, which is becoming more widely 
acknowledged as a major factor in peripheral metabolic dysfunction and pathology 
of the central nervous system (CNS). Inflammatory signals in the brain cause 
neuroinflammatory reactions that harm neuronal structures, change 
neuroplasticity, and disrupt synaptic function. When obesity-related 
inflammation is present, the brain's resident immune cells, known as microglia, 
become hyperactivated, which can lead to the production of neurotoxic chemicals, 
which can cause neuronal death. This neuroinflammation exacerbates the negative 
effects of obesity on brain health and is linked to cognitive decline, 
Alzheimer's disease, and other neurodegenerative disorders. Moreover, the 
blood-brain barrier (BBB) exhibits increased permeability during inflammatory 
states, facilitating the infiltration of peripheral immune cells and cytokines 
into the brain, hence exacerbating neurodegeneration. Adipose tissue is a source 
of chronic inflammatory mediators, which are examined in this review along with 
the molecular pathways that connect inflammation brought on by obesity to 
neurodegeneration. Additionally, it addresses various anti-inflammatory 
treatment approaches, including lifestyle modifications, anti-inflammatory 
medications, and gut microbiota modulation, to lessen the metabolic and 
neurological effects of obesity. Recognizing the link between obesity and 
inflammation opens up new opportunities for early intervention and the 
development of targeted treatments to prevent or alleviate neurodegenerative 
disorders.

BACKGROUND: Inter-individual variability in tau topography challenges the 
propagation hypothesis of tau aggregates.
METHODS: To address this gap, we propose the Manifold Component Analysis (MCA), 
for identifying pseudo-continuous profiles informed by the spatial continuity of 
stage regions.
RESULTS: Longitudinal and cross-sectional MCA in large aging cohort identified 
individual profiles (N = 753) expressing tau load in the entorhinal, limbic and 
neocortical regions. Using these profiles, we found neuropsychological and 
blood-based milestones of early and late disease stages. Finally, we also found 
evidence of rapid tau load increases and cognitive decline centered at the 
early-to-mid neocortical stages of Alzheimer's disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Stage system based on tau load and spreading profiles across 
cortical areas provide a compelling framework for inferring pathophysiological 
prognosis in Alzheimer's disease.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive uncurable neurodegenerative pathology 
affecting millions worldwide. Photobiomodulation and Taurine are promising 
alternatives for preventing and reducing the rapid progression of 
neurodegeneration, stimulating the reconstructing of neural tissue structures, 
especially improving mitochondrial activity, which is highly impaired in AD. In 
this study, the mitochondrial effects of Taurine combined with light emitting 
diode (LED) irradiation were evaluated on human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y), 
under oxidative stress condition by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) exposure, a 
considerable modulator in AD. We evaluated LED irradiation at the wavelength of 
660 nm and Taurine under different concentrations before and together with 
exposing SH-SY5Y cells to different concentrations of H2O2, assessing 
mitochondrial activity by the MTT colorimetric test and labeling live cells 
mitochondria by the fluorescent probe MitoTracker. Cell viability was also 
evaluated by the trypan blue exclusion assay, and cellular morphological 
structures were imaged by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Neuroprotective 
effects were achieved by both LED irradiation and LED irradiation + Taurine when 
cells were exposed to them before H2O2-induced stress. Comparing both agents, 
LED irradiation at 660 nm is sufficient to improve mitochondrial activity, 
however, healthy mitochondrial morphology was only observed when cells were 
treated with Taurine together with LED irradiation, representing affordable 
candidates that act in synergy against oxidative stress, one of the main 
contributors to neurodegeneration.

Senescent cell accumulation contributes to the progression of age-related 
disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Clinical trials focused on 
cellular senescence are in early stages and have yet to establish reliable 
outcome measures reflecting senescent cell burden or response to senolytics, 
therapeutics that clear senescent cells. Results from the first open-label trial 
of senolytics, dasatinib plus quercetin (D ​+ ​Q), in older adults (N ​= ​5) 
with early AD demonstrated central nervous system penetration of dasatinib and 
favorable safety and tolerability. Herein, we present exploratory analyses of 
senescence and AD-associated analytes in blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and 
urine from this study in effort to guide biomarker development for future 
senolytic trials. Immunoassays, mass spectrometry and transcriptomics were 
performed and changes in analyte levels were assessed from baseline to 
post-treatment using paired t-tests. Targeted cytokine and chemokine analyses 
revealed increases in plasma fractalkine and MMP-7 and CSF IL-6 from baseline to 
post-treatment. Mass spectrometry indicated stable levels of amyloid β and tau 
proteins in CSF, unchanged urinary metabolites, and modest treatment-associated 
lipid profile changes. Targeted transcriptomic analysis of peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells indicated downregulation of inflammatory genes including FOS, 
FOSB, IL1β, IL8, JUN, JUNB, PTGS2. The levels and treatment responses of the 
analytes identified here may help inform trial design and outcomes for senolytic 
studies. Independent validation will be necessary to develop standardized 
biomarker panels across senolytic trials for AD. ClinicalTrials.gov: 
NCT04063124.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that leads to memory 
loss and cognitive decline, in which blood-brain barrier (BBB) and astrocyte 
dysfunction are significantly involved. Recent evidence suggests that 
dysregulation of lipid metabolism in astrocytes contributes to BBB disruption 
and neuroinflammation in AD. Sterol O-acyltransferase 1 (SOAT1), an enzyme 
involved in cholesterol esterification, has been implicated in BBB disruption 
and neuroinflammation, but its specific role in AD remains unclear. This study 
aimed to investigate the impact of SOAT1 on lipid metabolism, BBB integrity, and 
neuroinflammation in AD. Using Oil Red O staining of human autopsy brain tissue 
and reanalysis of publicly available single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) 
data, we identified a significant increase in lipid droplet accumulation and 
lipid metabolism gene expression, particularly in astrocytes, in the brains of 
AD patients. Furthermore, in vitro BBB models and the 5 × FAD mouse model were 
used to explore how SOAT1 expression influences BBB function. Our results 
demonstrated that elevated SOAT1 expression in astrocytes was positively 
correlated with increased lipid droplet accumulation and compromised BBB 
integrity. Knockdown of SOAT1 using siRNA or treatment with the SOAT1 inhibitor 
K604 restored BBB function, reduced neuroinflammation, and improved cognitive 
function in 5 × FAD mice. These findings suggest that SOAT1 plays a critical 
role in astrocytic lipid metabolism and BBB dysfunction in AD. Targeting SOAT1 
may be a promising therapeutic approach to alleviate neuroinflammation and 
restore cognitive function in AD patients.

Sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterised by oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction 
and cerebral insulin resistance. Even though approximately 95 % of AD cases are 
reported as sporadic, the exact pathogenesis remains sparse. Tranilast, an 
analogue of tryptophan metabolite, was initially endowed as an anti-allergic 
agent and used in multiple inflammatory ailments. Still, the molecular 
mechanisms targeting sAD are yet to be investigated. In the present study, we 
investigated the neuroprotective potential of tranilast by performing 
biochemical, molecular and histopathological assessments using both in vivo and 
in vitro experimental sAD models. Streptozotocin (STZ; 3 mg/kg) was bilaterally 
injected on day 1 and 3 through the intracerebroventricular (ICV) route to 
Sprague Dawley rats for the in vivo model induction. Spontaneous alternation 
test, novel object recognition test, and passive avoidance test were performed 
to assess the altered behavioural patterns in animals. Furthermore, human 
neuroblastoma cells (SHSY5Y) were exposed to STZ (1 mM) and tranilast for 24 h 
to validate the in vivo results. Three weeks of tranilast (30 and 100 mg/kg, 
p.o.) treatment improved neurobehavioural anomalies in ICV-STZ-treated rats by 
halting neuroinflammation and NLRP3 inflammasome activation caused by enhanced 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) and thioredoxin interaction protein (TXNIP) 
overexpression. The phosphorylated tau (p-tau S416) level was also increased in 
the ICV-STZ rat's hippocampus and reversed upon tranilast treatment. A high dose 
of tranilast (100 mg/kg) treatment sensitised hippocampal insulin signalling in 
ICV-STZ-treated rats. Furthermore, in cell culture studies, 24-h tranilast (30 
and 100 μM) treatment reduced the mitochondrial ROS production and attenuated 
inflammasome activation in STZ-treated SHSY5Y cells. In summary, the findings of 
the study proclaim the neuroprotective potential of tranilast in STZ induced 
model of sAD by modulating the TXNIP-NLRP3 inflammasome pathway.

BACKGROUND: Previous research has shown that in-lab motor skill acquisition 
(supervised by an experimenter) is sensitive to biomarkers of Alzheimer disease 
(AD). However, remote unsupervised screening of AD risk through a skill-based 
task via the web has the potential to sample a wider and more diverse pool of 
individuals at scale.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine a web-based motor skill game 
("Super G") and its sensitivity to risk factors of AD (eg, age, sex, APOE ε4 
carrier status, and verbal learning deficits).
METHODS: Emails were sent to 662 previous MindCrowd participants who had agreed 
to be contacted for future research and have their APOE ε4 carrier status 
recorded and those who were at least 45 years of age or older. Participants who 
chose to participate were redirected to the Super G site where they completed 
the Super G task using their personal computer remotely and unsupervised. Once 
completed, different Super G variables were derived. Linear and logistic 
multivariable regression was used to examine the relationship between available 
AD risk factors (age, sex, APOE ε4 carrier status, and verbal learning) and 
distinct Super G performance metrics.
RESULTS: Fifty-four participants (~8% response rate) from the MindCrowd 
web-based cohort (mean age of 62.39 years; 39 females; and 23 APOE ε4 carriers) 
completed 75 trials of Super G. Results show that Super G performance was 
significantly associated with each of the targeted risk factors. Specifically, 
slower Super G response time was associated with being an APOE ε4 carrier (odds 
ratio 0.12, 95% CI 0.02-0.44; P=.006), greater Super G time in target (TinT) was 
associated with being male (odds ratio 32.03, 95% CI 3.74-1192,61; P=.01), and 
lower Super G TinT was associated with greater age (β -3.97, 95% CI -6.64 to 
-1.30; P=.005). Furthermore, a sex-by-TinT interaction demonstrated a 
differential relationship between Super G TinT and verbal learning depending on 
sex (βmale:TinT 6.77, 95% CI 0.34-13.19; P=.04).
CONCLUSIONS: This experiment demonstrated that this web-based game, Super G, has 
the potential to be a skill-based digital biomarker for screening of AD risk on 
a large scale with relatively limited resources.

AIM: This study aimed to explore differences in the emotions of patients with 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's dementia (AD) in group 
rehabilitation using facial analysis.
METHOD: We conducted rehabilitation consisting of aerobic exercise, cognitive 
training, dual tasks (a combination of exercise and cognitive training), and 
creative activities in a group format with patients with MCI and dementia. The 
faces of the 30 patients (MCI: n=14; mild/moderate AD: n=16) who participated 
were filmed from the front with a small camera during the four tasks. Then, we 
used the Kokoro Sensor (CAC Corporation, Japan), a device which estimates 
emotion scores (anger, contempt, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise) based on 
different parts of the face using artificial intelligence, to calculate emotion 
scores for each activity, and compared them between the MCI and AD groups.
RESULTS: Emotion scores for fear and surprise were significantly higher for the 
AD group than for the MCI group during dual tasks (p=0.016), while emotion 
scores for joy were significantly higher for the MCI group than for the AD group 
during creative activities (p=0.012).
CONCLUSION: Creative activities and dual tasks, which require simultaneous 
physical activity and cognitive thinking, were difficult for patients with AD. 
On the other hand, tasks which used a range of cognitive functions, such as 
creative activities, evoked joy in patients with MCI. It may be beneficial to 
provide tasks and support to patients with respect to their unique emotions 
based on these results.

The global rise in both metabolic syndrome (MetS) and neurodegenerative diseases 
(NDs), particularly dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses a growing health 
and socioeconomic burden. MetS affects approximately 25% of the global adult 
population and is associated with insulin resistance, hypertension, 
dyslipidemia, and obesity, factors increasingly linked to cognitive impairment 
and brain atrophy. This review explores the shared pathophysiological mechanisms 
between MetS and NDs, including neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, insulin 
resistance in the brain, blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, mitochondrial 
damage, gut microbiota dysbiosis, and alterations in the renin-angiotensin 
system. In terms of substance, MetS patients are four times more likely to 
develop dementia, with increased markers such as CRP and IL-6 present in the 
patient populations. The review suggests the role of astrocytic insulin 
signalling, adipokines, and toll-like receptors as key molecular links. 
Interventions such as caloric restriction, hydroxytyrosol (HT), and intranasal 
insulin have shown promising outcomes at preclinical and early clinical stages. 
Antidiabetic drugs like metformin, liraglutide, and GLP-1 receptor agonists have 
the potential to modulate neuroinflammation and improve cognition. Angiotensin 
receptor blockers like losartan and candesartan also exhibit neuroprotection via 
RAS pathway modulation. The review emphasizes the need for longitudinal studies 
and clinical trials to confirm these therapeutic agents and develop effective 
and cost-friendly interventions for the prevention and management of 
neurodegeneration in patients with metabolic syndrome.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by neuroinflammation and cognitive impairments. Although 
short-term treatment with fucoxanthin, a marine carotenoid with 
anti-neuroinflammatory activity, has been reported to prevent cognitive 
impairments in scopolamine- and β-amyloid (Aβ)-treated mice, it remains 
uncertain whether long-term fucoxanthin treatment could produce similar effects 
in transgenic AD models. Moreover, the anti-neuroinflammatory mechanism of 
fucoxanthin is still unclear. In this study, long-term treatment with 
fucoxanthin (15-150 mg kg-1, twice a week for 20 weeks) significantly prevented 
cognitive deficits and Aβ-related neuroinflammation in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. 
In addition, fucoxanthin largely prevented Aβ oligomer-induced secretion of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines and the activation of BV2 microglial cells. 
Furthermore, fucoxanthin reduced the increased expression of Nogo-A, a central 
player in AD pathophysiology, as well as the activation of downstream 
Rho-associated protein kinase 2 (ROCK2) and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) 
pathways in AD models. Most importantly, the inhibition of neuroinflammation by 
fucoxanthin was not reduced by shRNA-mediated knockdown of Nogo-A, suggesting 
that fucoxanthin significantly prevented cognitive impairments and 
neuroinflammation via the inhibition of Nogo-A. These results not only elucidate 
an anti-neuroinflammatory mechanism of fucoxanthin, but also provide strong 
support for the development of fucoxanthin as a novel food ingredient or drug 
for the treatment of AD.

Top-Rated Health Care and Ease of Access to Medications Linked to Lower Medicare 
and ADRD Costs.

Chen J(1), Jang S.

University of Maryland, College Park, MD.

IMPORTANCE: Little is known about the extent to which patient self-perception of 
care experience is associated with costs, especially for people with Alzheimer 
disease and related dementias (ADRD).
OBJECTIVE: This study explores the relationship between self-reported quality 
measures and Medicare costs and examines whether the ease of obtaining 
prescribed medications is associated with reduced overall Medicare costs, 
focusing on Medicare beneficiaries with ADRD.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cross-sectional study, Medicare 
Beneficiary Summary File data from 2018, 2019, and 2021 were linked to the 
Medicare Consumer Assessment of Health Care Providers and Systems (CAHPS) Survey 
using beneficiary IDs. The study sample included community-dwelling Medicare 
fee-for-service beneficiaries.
EXPOSURES: Five quality measures were used as key exposure variables: (1) 
beneficiary's rating on health care; (2) ease of getting care/tests/treatment 
through the health plan; (3) whether the doctor always explained, listened, 
respected; and spent enough time with the patient; (4) ease of obtaining 
prescribed medications; and (5) whether doctor always talked about all the 
prescription medicines the beneficiary was taking.
MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Annual total Medicare payments per person.
RESULTS: The study included 230,617 Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries aged 
65 and older, including 16,452 beneficiaries with ADRD. Among the total 
beneficiaries, 53% were females (vs. 56% of ADRD beneficiaries), with a mean 
(SD) age of 75.8 (SD 7.27) years [vs. 82.5 (SD 7.97) years for ADRD 
beneficiaries]. Fully adjusted analyses showed significant negative associations 
between quality measures and total per-capita payments, with more pronounced 
cost reductions among patients with ADRD. Specifically, patients with ADRD who 
reported it was always easy to get care had reductions of $1,922.0 (95% CI, 
-$3304.8 to -$539.2), while those who reported it was always easy to get 
prescribed medications had reductions of $2964.5 (95% CI, -$4518.8 to -$1410.1). 
In addition, beneficiaries who reported that doctors always discussed the 
medicines experienced cost reductions of $2299.7 (95% CI, -$3800.5 to -$799.0) 
in medicare costs.
CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Our findings suggest that high-quality care is not 
necessarily associated with high costs. Meanwhile, focusing on the ease of 
access to needed care, obtaining prescription drugs, and effective communication 
about medication is critical in improving care quality while reducing costs.

INTRODUCTION: The EXERT study (Exercise in Adults with Mild Memory Problems) was 
a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized controlled trial that examined effects of 
exercise on cognition and other measures of brain health in sedentary older 
adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
METHODS: Participants were randomized to moderate-high intensity aerobic 
training (AX) or low-intensity stretching/balance/range of motion (SBR) for 
18 months. Exercise was supervised for the first 12 months. Assessments were 
administered at baseline and every 6 months. The primary outcome was a global 
cognitive composite.
RESULTS: A total of 296 participants were enrolled, and intervention adherence 
was high (supervised session attendance: AX = 81%, SBR = 87%). Intervention 
effects on cognition did not differ for AX and SBR (regression = -0.078, 
standard error [SE] = 0.074; p = 0.3). Notably, there was no 12 month  cognition 
decline for either group, and mean 12 month  hippocampal volume loss for both 
groups was low at 0.51%.
DISCUSSION: Exercise intensity did not differentially affect cognitive 
trajectory. Intervention delivery was successful (high adherence) and cognition 
remained stable over 12 months  for both MCI groups, an association that 
warrants further study.
HIGHLIGHTS: Exercise in Adults with Mild Memory Problems (EXERT) was a large 
multisite randomized controlled trial of moderate-high intensity aerobic 
training versus lower-intensity flexibility and balance exercise in sedentary 
older adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI). A sensitive and 
validated measure of global cognitive function, the Alzheimer's Disease 
Assessment Scale-Cognition supplemented with tests of executive function 
(ADAS-Cog-Exec), was used to assess intervention efficacy with 12 months of 
supervised exercise. There was no intervention group difference on the 12-month 
cognitive trajectory of the ADAS-Cog-Exec. Intervention delivery was successful 
(high adherence), and cognition remained stable over 12 months for both exercise 
groups. Regular supported moderate-high or lower-intensity exercise may stall 
decline in adults with amnestic MCI, but further investigation is needed.

INTRODUCTION: EXERT was a multisite randomized controlled trial (RCT) examining 
the effects of moderate-high intensity aerobic training (AX) versus 
lower-intensity stretching/balance/range of motion (SBR) on cognitive 
trajectories in older adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI).
METHODS: Preplanned post-hoc analyses were conducted to compare each arm to a 
propensity-matched usual care (no intervention) group from Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative 1 (ADNI-1) selected for similarity across key 
characteristics. Differences in 12-month trajectories in the primary endpoint 
(ADAS-Cog-Exec) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volumes in prespecified 
brain regions were compared.
RESULTS: AX and SBR showed significantly less 12-month cognitive decline than 
ADNI-1 (AX:n = 109, β = 0.169, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.011-0.328; 
SBR:n = 105, β = 0.181, 95% CI 0.007-0.354). There were trends of less 
prefrontal cortex volume loss for both EXERT groups and less AD signature region 
volume loss for SBR relative to ADNI-1 over 12 months.
DISCUSSION: Moderate-high intensity aerobic or low-intensity flexibility 
exercise for 12 months in participants with aMCI may provide protection against 
decline relative to usual care.
CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: The EXERT clinical trial is registered at 
clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02814526).
HIGHLIGHTS: EXERT was a randomized controlled trial in sedentary older adults 
with aMCI. EXERT arms were propensity-matched to a usual care (no intervention) 
group (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 1 [ADNI-1]). High and 
low-intensity exercise arms had less 12-mo cognitive decline than ADNI-1. There 
were trends of less prefrontal cortex volume loss for each arm versus ADNI-1.

OBJECTIVES: Adult child caregivers of older adults living with Alzheimer's 
disease and related dementias are at risk of burnout due to competing caregiving 
demands from multiple generations. Yet, drawing from structural family theory, 
this study aims to examine the extent to which family dynamics, especially 
greater family cohesion and less family conflict, are associated with children's 
mental and physical health.
METHOD: The present study was secondary data analysis of an observational study, 
in which 150 pairs of adult-child caregivers and parents with early-stage 
cognitive impairment self-reported their health, family relationships (cohesion, 
expressiveness, and conflict), and family conflict regarding caregiving.
RESULTS: Findings indicate that family cohesion and expressiveness are 
significantly positively, and family conflict is significantly negatively, 
associated with children's mental health. However, we did not find any 
significant association with physical health.
CONCLUSION: Supportive family relationships may buffer the mental health of 
adult-child caregivers whose parents are living with early-stage cognitive 
impairment. Tailored interventions focusing on family relationships and 
conflicts are crucial to support children in managing the challenges associated 
with caregiving.

INTRODUCTION: This study investigates whether midlife cortisol levels predict 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarker burden 15 years later, with particular 
attention to sex differences and menopausal status.
METHODS: We analyzed data from 305 cognitively unimpaired Framingham Heart Study 
participants (48.5% female; mean age: 39.6 ± 8.1 years). Serum cortisol was 
categorized into tertiles, with amyloid ([11C]PiB) and tau ([18F]Flortaucipir) 
positron emission tomography (PET) imaging conducted 15 years later. We 
performed multivariable regression analyses adjusted for confounders including, 
apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) status.
RESULTS: Elevated midlife cortisol correlated with increased amyloid deposition, 
specifically in post-menopausal women, predominantly in posterior cingulate, 
precuneus, and frontal-lateral regions (p < 0.05). No significant associations 
were observed with tau burden or in males.
DISCUSSION: These findings reveal post-menopausal women with high midlife 
cortisol are at increased risk of AD. Results highlight the importance of 
identifying early risk factors when biomarkers are detectable but cognitive 
impairment is absent.
HIGHLIGHTS: High midlife cortisol is linked to increased amyloid deposition in 
post-menopausal women. Cortisol showed no association with tau pathology. 
Post-menopausal hormone changes may amplify cortisol's effects on amyloid.

Extracellular β-amyloid protein (Aβ) plaques are prominent pathological feature 
of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aβ oligomers and plaques induce sustained 
microglial activation via the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase 
(AMPK)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/interferon regulatory factor 5 
(IRF5) signaling pathway. This microglial activation-mediated neuroinflammation 
can accelerate neuronal cell senescence. Consequently, the regulation of the 
AMPK/mTOR/IRF5 pathway presents a potential therapeutic target for AD, as it may 
inhibit neuroinflammation and delay neuronal cell senescence. Mangiferin, a 
bioactive natural polyphenol extracted from the leaves of Mangifera indica 
Linn., has garnered significant attention for its anti-inflammatory properties. 
However, it remains unclear whether mangiferin can modulate the AMPK/mTOR/IRF5 
pathway to inhibit microglial activation-mediated neuroinflammation and delay 
neuronal cell senescence. This study employed both cellular and animal models of 
neuronal cell senescence to explore the effects of mangiferin on the regulation 
of the AMPK/mTOR/IRF5 pathway, aiming to inhibit neuroinflammation and delay 
neuronal cell senescence in vitro and in vivo. Specifically, SH-SY5Y 
neuroblastoma cells were subjected to a neuroinflammatory microenvironment 
induced by Aβ1-42-mediated HMC3 microglial activation to induce neuronal cell 
senescence in vitro. Additionally, SAMP8 accelerated aging mice were utilized as 
an aging animal model. The results indicate that mangiferin significantly 
enhances AMPK phosphorylation in microglial cells, inhibits mTOR activation, and 
downregulates IRF5 expression. These effects collectively suppress microglial 
activation and markedly reduce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by 
activated microglia. Consequently, there is a decrease in the proportion of 
neurons arrested in the G0/G1 phase and a reduction in the number of 
senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) positive neurons. Furthermore, 
mangiferin significantly decreases the expression of neuronal cell senescence 
markers P16Ink4a and P21Cip1. Collectively, these findings suggest that 
mangiferin effectively regulates the AMPK/mTOR/IRF5 pathway, inhibits 
neuroinflammation mediated by microglial activation, and delays neuronal cell 
senescence. This study underscores the potential of mangiferin for the treatment 
of neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative diseases.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) significantly reduces the quality of life of patients 
and exacerbates the burden on their families and society. Resistance exercise 
significantly enhances the overall cognitive function of the elderly and 
patients with AD while positively improving memory, executive function, and 
muscle strength, reducing fall risks, and alleviating psychological symptoms. As 
AD is a neurodegenerative disorder, some nerve factors are readily activated and 
released during exercise. Therefore, several prior studies have concentrated on 
exploring the molecular mechanisms of resistance exercise and their impact on 
brain function and neural plasticity. Recent investigations have identified an 
intrinsic relationship between individuals with AD and the pathological 
mechanisms of skeletal muscle atrophy, establishing a correlation between 
patients with AD cognitive level and skeletal muscle content. Resistance 
exercise primarily targets the skeletal muscle, which improves cognitive 
impairment in patients with AD by reducing vascular and neuroinflammatory 
factors and further enhances cognitive function in patients with AD by restoring 
the structural function of skeletal muscle. Furthermore, the effects of 
resistance training vary among distinct subgroups of cognitive impairment. 
Individuals exhibiting lower cognitive function demonstrate more pronounced 
adaptive responses in physical performance over time. Consequently, further 
investigation is warranted to determine whether tailored guidelines-such as 
variations in the frequency and duration of resistance exercise-should be 
established for patients with varying levels of dementia, in order to optimize 
the benefits for those experiencing cognitive impairment. This study aimed to 
review the relationship between AD and skeletal muscle atrophy, the impact of 
skeletal muscle atrophy on AD cognition, the mechanism by which resistance 
exercise improves cognition through skeletal muscle improvement, and the optimal 
resistance exercise mode to elucidate the additional advantages of resistance 
exercise in treating cognitive function in patients with AD and skeletal muscle 
atrophy.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by cognitive decline; recent studies suggest that neuronal 
ferroptosis plays a key role in its pathogenesis. Danggui Shaoyao San (DSS), a 
traditional Chinese medicine formula, has shown demonstrated neuroprotective 
effects, but its precise mechanisms in AD treatment remain unclear. This study 
aims to investigate the mechanism of DSS in treating AD by inhibiting neuronal 
ferroptosis, explore whether DSS alleviates AD by suppressing neuronal 
ferroptosis via the AMPK/Sp1/ACSL4 pathway.
METHODS: Chemical composition of DSS was identified by LC-MS/MS, followed by 
network pharmacology to predict targets and pathways. Molecular docking assessed 
binding affinities between DSS compounds and key proteins (AMPK, Sp1, ACSL4). In 
vivo experiments on APP/PS1 mice evaluated DSS effects on cognitive function, 
oxidative stress markers, lipid peroxidation, and ferroptosis-related proteins.
RESULTS: Network pharmacology analysis suggested that DSS regulates lipid 
metabolism and inhibits neuronal ferroptosis via the AMPK pathway. Molecular 
docking revealed strong binding affinities between DSS compounds and AMPK 
downstream proteins, Sp1 and ACSL4. In vivo experiments showed that DSS improved 
cognitive function, enhanced antioxidant capacity, reduced lipid peroxide 
accumulation, and decreased Fe2+ content in brain tissue. Furthermore, DSS 
increased the expression of FTH, p-AMPK, and GPX4 while decreasing Sp1 and ACSL4 
levels, thereby inhibiting ferroptosis.
CONCLUSION: DSS alleviates AD symptoms by suppressing neuronal ferroptosis via 
the AMPK/Sp1/ACSL4 axis, representing a novel lipid metabolism-targeted 
therapeutic strategy.

The gut microbiota plays a pivotal role in human life and undergoes dynamic 
changes throughout the human lifespan, from infancy to old age. During our life, 
the gut microbiota influences health and disease across life stages. This review 
summarizes the discussions and presentations from the symposium "Gut microbiota 
development from infancy to old age" held in collaboration with the Journal of 
Internal Medicine. In early infancy, microbial colonization is shaped by factors 
such as mode of delivery, antibiotic exposure, and milk-feeding practices, 
laying the foundation for subsequent increased microbial diversity and 
maturation. Throughout childhood and adolescence, microbial maturation 
continues, influencing immune development and metabolic health. In adulthood, 
the gut microbiota reaches a relatively stable state, influenced by genetics, 
diet, and lifestyle. Notably, disruptions in gut microbiota composition have 
been implicated in various inflammatory diseases-including inflammatory bowel 
disease, Type 1 diabetes, and allergies. Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests 
a connection between gut dysbiosis and neurodegenerative disorders such as 
Alzheimer's disease. Understanding the role of the gut microbiota in disease 
pathogenesis across life stages provides insights into potential therapeutic 
interventions. Probiotics, prebiotics, and dietary modifications, as well as 
fecal microbiota transplantation, are being explored as promising strategies to 
promote a healthy gut microbiota and mitigate disease risks. This review focuses 
on the gut microbiota's role in infancy, adulthood, and aging, addressing its 
development, stability, and alterations linked to health and disease across 
these critical life stages. It outlines future research directions aimed at 
optimizing the gut microbiota composition to improve health.

BACKGROUND: Genetic variation in Transmembrane protein 106B (TMEM106B) is known 
to influence the risk and presentation in several neurodegenerative diseases and 
modifies healthy aging. While evidence from human studies suggests that the risk 
allele is associated with higher levels of TMEM106B, the contribution of 
elevated levels of TMEM106B to neurodegeneration and aging has not been assessed 
and it remains unclear how TMEM106B modulates disease risk.
METHODS: To study the effect of increased TMEM106B levels, we generated 
Cre-inducible transgenic mice expressing human wild-type TMEM106B. We evaluated 
lysosomal and neuronal health using in vitro and in vivo assays including 
transmission electron microscopy, immunostainings, behavioral testing, 
electrophysiology, and bulk RNA sequencing.
RESULTS: We created the first transgenic mouse model that successfully 
overexpresses TMEM106B, with a 4- to 8-fold increase in TMEM106B protein levels 
in heterozygous (hTMEM106B(+)) and homozygous (hTMEM106B(++)) animals, 
respectively. We showed that the increase in TMEM106B protein levels induced 
lysosomal dysfunction and age-related downregulation of genes associated with 
neuronal plasticity, learning, and memory. Increased TMEM106B levels led to 
altered synaptic signaling in 12-month-old animals which further exhibited an 
anxiety-like phenotype. Finally, we observed mild neuronal loss in the 
hippocampus of 21-month-old animals.
CONCLUSION: Characterization of the first transgenic mouse model that 
overexpresses TMEM106B suggests that higher levels of TMEM106B negatively 
impacts brain health by modifying brain aging and impairing the resilience of 
the brain to the pathomechanisms of neurodegenerative disorders. This novel 
model will be a valuable tool to study the involvement and contribution of 
increased TMEM106B levels to aging and will be essential to study the many 
age-related diseases in which TMEM106B was genetically shown to be a disease- 
and risk-modifier.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer Disease (AD) represents a growing global health concern 
with profound socioeconomic implications, with predictions indicating a 
potential 50% increase in AD cases in Italy over the next 30 years. Timely 
diagnosis remains challenging due to the slow progression of symptoms and 
limited accessibility to advanced diagnostic tools, yet it remains one of the 
few tools available to prevent and alter the clinical course of the disease. The 
aim of this study is to build a cost-of-illness model to estimate the number of 
AD patients managed by the National Health Service, analyzing their use of 
hospital care, and estimating the social costs through real-world data.
METHODS: The analysis encompassed a multifaceted approach, combining real-world 
data analysis from different sources for the period 2014-2019. Health direct 
costs related to AD in Italy were estimated thanks to the Italian database of 
all hospital discharges and a Local Health Unit database (400,000 residents) 
collecting all information on resource consumption related to AD. The National 
Social Security System database was used to estimate social security costs 
(disability compensations) related to Attendance Allowance (AA) recognitions.
RESULTS: In Italy a prevalence of 413,715 AD patients was estimated, with annual 
health direct costs per patient equal to €3,779. Annual social security costs 
related to AA recognitions amounted to 240 million euros. Overall, the analysis 
estimated an annual total cost exceeding 1.8 billion euros.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a comprehensive exploration of the multifaceted 
burden of AD in Italy, shedding light on its economic dimensions. The results 
underscore the urgency of prioritizing AD on political agendas, especially in 
the face of the projected global surge in AD cases. The study advocates for 
proactive policy interventions and informed healthcare decision-making to 
address the complex challenges posed by AD.

Lewy body dementia (LBD) encompasses neurodegenerative dementias characterized 
by cognitive fluctuations, visual hallucinations, and parkinsonism. Clinical 
differentiation of LBD from Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains complex due to 
symptom overlap, yet approximately 25% of dementia cases are diagnosed as LBD 
postmortem, primarily identified by the presence of α-synuclein aggregates, tau 
tangles, and amyloid plaques. These pathological features position LBD as a 
comorbid condition of both Parkinson's disease (PD) and AD, with over 50% of LBD 
cases exhibiting co-pathologies. LBD's mixed pathology complicates the 
development of comprehensive models that reflect the full spectrum of LBD's 
etiological, clinical, and pathological features. While existing animal and 
cellular models have facilitated significant discoveries in PD and AD research, 
they lack specificity in capturing LBD's unique pathogenic mechanisms, limiting 
the exploration of therapeutic avenues for LBD specifically. This review 
assesses widely used PD and AD models in terms of their relevance to LBD, 
particularly focusing on their ability to replicate human disease pathology and 
assess treatment efficacy. Furthermore, we discuss potential modifications to 
these models to advance the understanding of LBD mechanisms and propose 
innovative research directions aimed at developing models with enhanced 
etiological, face, predictive, and construct validity.

Decreased expression of sirtuin 1 (SirT1) has been implicated in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), and as we previously reported, is related to transcriptional 
repression by the major risk factor for sporadic AD, apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4). 
Herein we describe the discovery of an orally brain-permeable small-molecule, 
DDL-218, that enhanced SirT1 in ApoE4-expressing neuronal cells and a murine AD 
model. DDL-218 increased the transcription factor NFYb resulting in upregulation 
of PRMT5. Mechanistic and modeling studies show that binding of ApoE4 to the 
SirT1 gene promoter can be displaced by PRMT5 leading to increased SirT1 
transcription. DDL-218 treatment elicited improvement in memory in the AD model, 
suggesting that DDL-218 enhancement of neurotrophic SirT1 in the brain has 
potential to modulate neuronal activity that may clinically provide an 
improvement in cognitive function and complement the current anti-Aβ antibody 
monotherapy. Our findings support further development of DDL-218 as a novel 
ApoE4-targeted therapeutic candidate for AD.

Dementia includes a variety of neurodegenerative diseases that affect and target 
the brain's fundamental cognitive functions. It is undoubtedly one of the 
diseases that affects people globally. The ameliorating the disease is still not 
known; the symptoms, however, can be prevented to an extent. Dementia 
encompasses Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Lewy 
body dementia, mixed dementia, and various other diseases. The aggregation of 
β-amyloid protein plaques and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles have been 
concluded as the foremost cause for the onset of the disease. As the cases 
climb, new neuroprotective methods are being developed in the form of new drug 
delivery systems that provide targeted delivery. Herbal drugs like Ashwagandha, 
Brahmi, and Cannabis have shown satisfactory results by not only treating the 
symptoms but have also been shown to reduce and ameliorate the formation of 
amyloid plaque formation. This article explores the intricate possibilities of 
drug delivery and the absolute use of herbal drugs to target neurodegenerative 
diseases. The various possibilities of nanotechnology currently available with 
new emerging techniques are also discussed.

Microglia-mediated neuroinflammation plays a critical role in the onset and 
progression of Alzheimer's disease. In a previous study, we synthesized 
6-hydroxy-3'-propyl-[1,1'-biphenyl]-3-propanoic acid (6OHA) based on the 
structure of magnaldehyde B, a natural compound that our group identified as a 
retinoid X receptor (RXR) agonist. However, its potential effects on 
inflammation in microglial cells remain unexplored. In this study, we 
specifically focused on the early-phase inflammatory responses to 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and evaluated the inhibitory effects of 6OHA on BV-2 
microglial cells following 2 h of LPS exposure. Similar to the existing RXR 
agonist bexarotene (Bex), 6OHA treatment (0.1 and 1 μM) resulted in a 
dose-dependent decrease in the mRNA levels of proinflammatory mediators, 
including interleukin-1β (Il1b), Il6, and inducible nitric oxide synthase. 
However, these effects on proinflammatory mediators were effectively abolished 
by the RXR antagonist UVI3003. Additionally, 6OHA promoted M2 microglia 
polarization after 24 h of treatment, as evidenced by the increased mRNA levels 
of the M2 marker genes arginase-1 (Arg1), C-C motif chemokine ligand 6 (Ccl6), 
Ccl17, and Ccl22. Notably, 6OHA induced a distinct set of M2 microglial markers 
compared with IL-4, a known M2 microglial inducer. Furthermore, the 
transcription of Arg1, a key M2 marker gene, is regulated by retinoic acid 
receptor/RXR heterodimers and the IL-4 signaling pathway. Collectively, 6OHA 
suppressed the early inflammatory responses to LPS and promoted M2 microglial 
polarization through a mechanism distinct from that of IL-4. Therefore, RXR 
agonists, including 6OHA and Bex, may exhibit dual anti-inflammatory effects and 
serve as novel modulators of neuroinflammation.

BACKGROUND: - Type 2 diabetes (T2D) increases the risk of dementia by 1.5 to 2.5 
times. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) and metformin, widely 
used antidiabetic therapies, have demonstrated potential neuroprotective 
effects. Their comparative effectiveness in dementia prevention remains unknown.
METHODS: - This retrospective cohort study used the TriNetX global federated 
network, analyzing de-identified records from over 98 healthcare organizations. 
Adults with T2D initiating SGLT2i or metformin as first-line therapy were 
propensity score-matched (1:1). The primary outcome was overall dementia 
incidence, including vascular dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and other subtypes. 
Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality. Time-to-event outcomes were 
assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox models.
RESULTS: - Among 74,975 matched patients in each cohort, SGLT2i use was 
associated with a lower incidence of overall dementia: 2.7 % vs. 6.9 %: adjusted 
hazard ratio (aHR) 0.80 [95 % CI 0.76;0.84]. Reductions were observed in 
vascular dementia (0.8 % vs. 2.0 %; aHR 0.87), Alzheimer's dementia (1.1 % vs. 
3.2 %; aHR, 0.76), and all-cause mortality (6.8 % vs. 15.4 %; aHR, 0.92). 
Benefits were pronounced in older adults, particularly those aged ≥80 years.
CONCLUSIONS: - SGLT2is significantly reduced dementia risk and mortality 
compared to metformin in T2D patients. These findings suggest SGLT2is may offer 
superior neuroprotective benefits, underscoring their potential as a first-line 
therapy for T2D. Further randomized trials are needed to confirm these results.

OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the neuroprotective effects of 
sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) in reducing dementia risk 
among older adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), compared to dipeptidyl 
peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i).
METHODS: Using the TriNetX electronic health records network, we conducted a 
retrospective cohort study including adults aged ≥65 years with T2DM who 
initiated SGLT2i or DPP4i between January 1, 2013, and November 30, 2024. 
Propensity score matching was employed to create two balanced cohorts, with the 
primary outcome being new-onset dementia. Secondary outcomes included 
dementia-related drug use and subtypes of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease 
and vascular dementia.
RESULTS: After propensity score matching, 80,376 patients were included in each 
group. SGLT2i use was associated with a significantly lower risk of developing 
dementia compared to DPP4i (hazard ratio [HR], 0.54; 95 % confidence interval 
[CI]: 0.51-0.57; p < 0.001). Similar reductions were observed for 
dementia-related drug use (HR, 0.69; 95 % CI: 0.64-0.74; p < 0.001), Alzheimer's 
disease (HR, 0.53; 95 % CI: 0.48-0.60; p < 0.001), and vascular dementia (HR, 
0.52; 95 % CI: 0.46-0.58; p < 0.001). Subgroup analyses showed consistent 
protective effects.
CONCLUSION: Compared to DPP-4i, SGLT2i use is associated with a lower risk of 
dementia in older adults with T2DM, with consistent benefits observed across 
diverse populations and patient subgroups. These findings highlight the 
potential of SGLT2i as a preventive strategy for cognitive decline and support 
further investigation in randomized controlled trials.

BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence indicates that neuroinflammation is involved 
in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). According to RNA sequencing and 
quantitative PCR (qPCR), we found that chemokine CCL3 mRNA expression was 
abnormally upregulated in the brains of AD transgenic mice. Moreover, the levels 
of CCL3 in the serum of AD patients were significantly elevated and negatively 
correlated with their cognitive abilities. However, the role of CCL3 in AD 
neuroinflammation and pathological damages remains elusive.
METHODS: Using behavioral, histological, and biochemical methods, outcomes of 
CCL3 antibody treatment on neuropathology and cognitive deficits were studied in 
the APPswe/PS1dE9 mice.
RESULTS: In the present study, we reported that CCL3 protein expression was 
increased in the APPswe/PS1dE9 mice, whereas blockage of CCL3 with neutralizing 
antibody potently inhibited CCL3 activation in the APPswe/PS1dE9 mice down to 
the levels of wild-type mice. Specifically, CCL3 antibody significantly improved 
the learning and memory abilities of APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. In addition, CCL3 
antibody treatment decreased cerebral amyloid-β (Aβ) levels and plaque burden 
via inhibiting amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing by reducing beta-site 
APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) expression in the APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. We also 
found that CCL3 antibody treatment alleviated neuroinflammation and reduced 
synaptic defects in the APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. Furthermore, the activated NF-κB 
signaling pathway in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice was inhibited by CCL3 antibody 
treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our findings provide evidence that CCL3 activation 
may contribute to the AD pathogenesis and may serve as a novel therapeutic 
target in the treatment of AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
marked by complex pathologies. Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) plays a 
pivotal role in AD pathogenesis, influencing key pathological processes such as 
hyperphosphorylation of tau and production of amyloid-beta. However, current 
methods for detecting GSK-3β in living cells and tissues are limited in 
sensitivity and real-time tracking. Herein, we reported a series of 
environment-sensitive fluorescent probes to detect GSK-3β in both living cells 
and brain slices. These probes exhibit fluorescence upon the binding of GSK-3β, 
providing high sensitivity and selectivity with minimal background interference. 
Compound 10c was further validated in an AD mouse model with elevated expression 
of GSK-3β, showing clear imaging in hippocampal regions. Compared to 
immunofluorescence, compound 10c demonstrated a lower background and faster 
labeling. In addition, this compound showed neuroprotective effects, supporting 
its potential as a theranostic tool in AD. These findings provide new tools for 
investigating the role of GSK-3β in AD and advancing targeted therapies.

Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are prevalent, emerge early, and are associated 
with poorer outcomes in Lewy body dementia (LBD). Research suggests NPS may 
reflect LBD-related dysfunction in distributed neuronal networks. This study 
investigated NPS neural correlates in prodromal LBD using resting-state 
functional MRI. Fifty-seven participants were included with mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) with Lewy bodies (MCI-LB, n = 28) or Parkinson's disease 
(PD-MCI, n = 29). Functional MRI assessed connectivity within five resting-state 
networks: primary visual, dorsal attention, salience, limbic, and default mode 
networks. NPS were measured using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Principal 
component analyses identified three neuropsychiatric factors: affective disorder 
(apathy, depression), psychosis (delusions, hallucinations) and anxiety. 
Seed-to-voxel connectivity maps were analysed to determine associations between 
NPS and network connectivity. In PD-MCI, affective symptoms and anxiety were 
associated with greater connectivity between limbic orbitofrontal cortex and 
default mode areas, including medial prefrontal cortex, subgenual cingulate and 
precuneus, and weaker connectivity between limbic orbitofrontal cortex and the 
brainstem and between the salience network and medial prefrontal cortex (all 
pFWE<0.001). Psychosis severity in PD-MCI correlated with connectivity across 
multiple networks (all pFWE<0.001). In MCI-LB, no significant correlations were 
found between NPS severity and network connectivity. However, participants with 
anxiety demonstrated a trend towards greater connectivity within medial 
prefrontal areas than those without (pFWE=0.046). Altered connectivity within 
and between networks associated with mood disorders may explain affective and 
anxiety symptoms in PD-MCI. Neural correlates of NPS in MCI-LB, however, remain 
unclear, highlighting the need for research in larger, more diverse LBD 
populations to identify symptomatic treatment targets.

Lesion-symptom mapping methods assess the relationship between lesions caused by 
cerebral small vessel disease and cognition, but current technology like support 
vector regression (SVR)) primarily provide group-level results. We propose a 
novel lesion-symptom mapping approach that can indicate how lesion patterns 
contribute to cognitive impairment on an individual level. A convolutional 
neural network (CNN) predicts cognitive scores and is combined with explainable 
artificial intelligence (XAI) to map the relation between cognition and vascular 
lesions. This method was evaluated primarily using real white matter 
hyperintensity maps of 821 memory clinic patients and simulated cognitive data, 
with weighted lesions and noise levels. Simulated data provided ground truth 
locations to assess predictive performance of the CNN and accuracy of strategic 
lesion identification by XAI, using an established lesion-symptom mapping 
method, SVR, and a simple fully connected neural network (FNN) as benchmarks. 
Real cognitive scores were used in a final proof-of-principle analysis. 
Predictive performance in simulation experiments was high for the CNN 
(R2 = 0.964), SVR (R2 = 0.875), and FNN (R2 = 0.863). CNN with XAI provided 
patient-specific attribution maps that highlighted the ground truth locations. 
All methods showed similar sensitivity to noise. Using real cognitive scores, 
SVR (R2 = 0.291) obtained a somewhat higher predictive performance than the CNN 
(R2 = 0.216), although both methods substantially exceeded the predictive 
performance of total WMH volume alone (R2 = 0.013). The FNN performed worse on 
real data (R2 = 0.020). To conclude, results show that CNNs combined with XAI 
can perform lesion-symptom mapping and generate individual attribution maps, 
which could be a valuable feature with further method development.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Brain atrophy is relevant for understanding disease 
progression and treatment response in people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS). 
Automatic brain volume-reporting tools often rely on healthy control (HC) 
reference curves to interpret brain volumes, whereas brain volume loss is 
different in pwMS. This observational study aimed to develop an MS-specific 
reference model for brain volumes and evaluate its performance compared with 
HC-based curves, as a proof-of-concept.
METHODS: Participants, pwMS and HCs, from the Amsterdam MS cohort were included 
based on the availability of T1-weighted MR scans. Normalized brain volumes 
(NBVs) were obtained using commercially available software. The software program 
also provides NBV percentiles, based on age-specific and sex-specific HC curves, 
grouped into NBV quartiles, describing deviation from expected NBVs. Disease 
severity was determined with the MS severity score (MSSS), Symbol Digit 
Modalities Test (SDMT), and 9-Hole Peg Test (9HPT). An MS-specific model was 
developed by regressing NBVs against age, sex, disease duration, and MS 
phenotype. The resulting MS model was also used to classify pwMS into quartiles 
describing deviation from expected NBV, given the modeled patient 
characteristics, with leave-one-out predictions. Quartile classification from 
HC-based and MS-based reference curves was compared with MSSS using analysis of 
variance (ANOVA).
RESULTS: Regressions for NBVs from 713 pwMS and 259 HCs (mean age: 49.1 ± 9.7 
and 48.3 ± 10.1, %female: 70.4% and 67.2%, respectively) were significant for 
age, sex, disease duration, and phenotype, which were included in the 
MS-specific model. MS-specific model quartile designations significantly 
improved associations with MSSS values (p = 2.2*10-9, η2 = 0.06) compared with 
HC-based quartiles. MSSS values worsened with lower NBV quartiles in the 
MS-specific model (difference between quartiles 1-4 = -0.84, p = 6.1*10-3, 95% 
CI [-1.5 to -0.18])), which was not observed for HC-based quartiles (p = 0.98). 
Quartile group differences were observed for 9HPT (MS: p = 3.5*10-3, η2 = 0.02, 
HC: p = 6.6*10-3, η2 = 0.02) and SDMT (MS: p = 3.1*10-4, η2 = 0.05, HC: p = 
5.4*10-4, η2 = 0.04) values, but MS-specific quartiles again improved quartile 
associations (p = 0.036, η2 = 0.01 and p = 0.02, η2 = 0.01, respectively).
DISCUSSION: NBV values derived from an MS-specific reference model offer 
improved relevance for assessing disease severity compared with curves derived 
from age-specific and sex-specific HC reference models. Improving the model 
toward application in individual people could enhance clinical implementation.

Background: Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are 
neurodegenerative disorders that afflict 1 in 9 older adults. As pharmacological 
interventions for ADRD are often ineffective and cause rampant side effects, 
interest has increased in finding adjunctive, non-pharmacological approaches. 
Music therapy may be especially beneficial for individuals with ADRD and their 
caregivers as music is a form of non-verbal communication. Objective: In this 
case series, we describe a 12-week group music therapy program for individuals 
with ADRD and their caregivers. Methods: Brain activity was recorded with 
hyperscanning electroencephalography (EEG) during each music therapy session 
from the individual with ADRD (n = 3), caregiver (n = 3), and music therapist 
(n = 1). Video recordings allowed for assessment of movement behavior and 
affective state responses. Results: This 12-week case series of group music 
therapy for individuals and their caregivers had a 66% retention and 95.8% 
adherence rate. We had success collecting behavioral and neural data using 
360-degree video capture in combination with EEG. Video recordings allowed us to 
analyze affective state and nonverbal communication metrics. After 
pre-processing, neural recordings were clean and able to be analyzed for various 
neural metrics of interest. Conclusions: A human-centered design approach can be 
helpful for implementing longitudinal, non-pharmacological interventions in this 
vulnerable population. A team-science approach with a collective of creative 
arts therapists, neuroscientists, dementia care experts, creative technologists, 
and gerontology experts contributed to the conduction of this work. Future 
studies should examine the effects of music therapy on behavioral and neural 
outcomes, especially as it relates to interpersonal behavioral and neural 
synchrony.

BackgroundThe alternative splicing (AS) of MAPT, which encodes Tau, in the adult 
human brain produces six major isoforms that play critical roles in the 
pathogenesis of tauopathies including Alzheimer's disease. Previous efforts have 
failed to differentiate human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to 
cortical neurons expressing the six isoforms of Tau.ObjectiveWe aim to develop a 
differentiation method capable of producing the six Tau isoforms in 
hiPSC-derived cortical neurons.MethodsWe searched for the optimal concentration, 
duration and treatment window of morphogens in the differentiation of hiPSCs 
through embryoid bodies (EBs) to dorsal forebrain neuroepithelial cells then to 
cortical neurons.ResultsThe combined inhibition of WNT, SHH, and SMAD signaling 
in EBs generated neuroepithelial cells expressing appropriate dorsal forebrain 
markers, while suppressing ventral, midbrain, and hindbrain genes. Further 
differentiation in neurogenic and neurotrophic factors produced MAP2+ neurons at 
day 18. The iPSC-derived neurons expressed markers of all cortical layers and 
exhibited synapse formation and synaptic physiology. In addition, MAP2+ neurons 
and mitotic cells expressing radial glial markers formed aggregates that could 
be dissociated to produce mature neurons with similar properties. Most 
importantly, the six Tau isoforms were expressed from day 80 in a 
developmentally regulated manner, modeling the situation in human brains on an 
accelerated timeline.ConclusionsThis chemically defined differentiation method 
produces a key hallmark of mature human cortical neurons by expressing the six 
main splicing isoforms of Tau. It will greatly facilitate disease modeling and 
therapeutic discovery for many human brain disorders involving cortical neurons.

BackgroundCurrent therapies for cognitive impairment, including Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment, are limited by a lack of universal 
treatment and adverse effects associated with polypharmacy. Investigating 
genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying cognitive decline is critical for 
the development of targeted therapeutics.ObjectiveTo identify causal genes and 
potential therapeutic targets for cognitive impairment through integrative 
genomic analyses.MethodsGenome-wide association study data on cognitive 
impairment were combined with the expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data 
from the eQTLGen consortium. Mendelian randomization (MR) and colocalization 
analyses were employed to infer causal relationships. Gene Set Enrichment 
Analysis and Gene Set Variation Analysis evaluated the pathway and functional 
differences. Immune cell infiltration patterns and the immunometabolic pathways 
were assessed, followed by drug target prediction.ResultsMR analysis identified 
seven gene-eQTL pairs significantly associated with cognitive impairment. SMR 
colocalization prioritized three key genes: HNMT (histamine metabolism), TNFSF8 
(inflammatory signaling), and S1PR5 (sphingolipid signaling). HNMT, TNFSF8, and 
S1PR5 had 39, 24, and 30 predicted targeted drugs, respectively, including 
arsenic trioxide, aspirin, and immunomodulators.ConclusionsThis study implicates 
HNMT, TNFSF8, and S1PR5 as potential therapeutic targets for cognitive 
impairment. Further validation is required to confirm their clinical relevance.

BackgroundLow-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU), a non-invasive targeted brain 
stimulation technology, has shown promise for therapeutic applications in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Despite its potential, the implications of 
repeated LIFU neuromodulation in AD patients remain to be 
investigated.ObjectiveThis pilot study evaluated the safety and potential to 
improve cognition and functional connectivity following repeated LIFU treatment 
in AD patients.MethodsTen early-stage AD patients underwent six sessions of 
neuronavigation-guided LIFU targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex 
(DLPFC) within 2-3 weeks, alongside ongoing standard pharmacotherapy. 
Neuropsychological assessments and resting-state functional magnetic resonance 
imaging were performed at baseline and eight weeks post-treatment.ResultsMemory 
performance (p = 0.02) and functional connectivity between the left DLPFC and 
both the left perirhinal cortex and left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex 
(corrected p < 0.05) significantly improved from baseline. Additionally, 
enhancements in memory performance were positively correlated with increases in 
functional connectivity of the left DLPFC with the left perirhinal cortex 
(Kendall's tau = 0.56, p = 0.03). No adverse events were reported during the 
LIFU treatments or at the subsequent follow-up.ConclusionsLIFU may have the 
therapeutic potential to enhance both brain network connectivity and memory 
functions in AD patients. Our results provide a basis for further research, 
including randomized sham-controlled trials and optimization of stimulation 
protocols, on LIFU as a supplementary or alternative treatment option for 
AD.Trial registrationClinical Research Information Service, KCT0008169,

BackgroundImpairments in orientation in space, time, and person occur frequently 
in Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. Subtle changes in orientation may arise in 
preclinical and prodromal disease stages. Thus, assessing orientation may help 
identify those on a trajectory toward AD dementia.ObjectiveTo investigate how 
orientation, measured using a novel artificial intelligence-based paradigm, 
relates to AD biomarkers (amyloid and tau) in cognitively unimpaired older 
adults.MethodsUsing an automated chatbot, 53 cognitively unimpaired participants 
(74.0 ± 5.5 years; 60% female) provided details about memories and 
relationships, recognition of historical event dates, and geographical 
locations. These details were then used to assess orientation to space, time, 
and person. For each domain separately, orientation accuracy was calculated by 
dividing the number of correct responses by response time. All participants 
underwent Pittsburgh compound-B (amyloid) and flortaucipir (tau) positron 
emission tomography. We analyzed the relationship between performance on the 
three orientation domains and retrosplenial, precuneus, neocortical, and medial 
temporal tau, and global amyloid.ResultsHigher retrosplenial and precuneus tau 
burden were associated with worse temporal orientation (β = -0.32, 95% 
confidence interval [95%CI] = [-0.59, -0.05] and β = -0.29, 95%CI = [-0.57, 
-0.01], respectively). Spatial or social orientation were not associated with 
amyloid or tau.ConclusionsThese results suggest that impaired temporal 
orientation is related to AD pathological processes, even before the onset of 
overt cognitive impairment, and may infer a role for personalized assessment of 
orientation in early diagnosis of AD.
