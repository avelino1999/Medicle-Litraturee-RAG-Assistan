Cell culture is an essential tool in both fundamental and translational 
research, particularly for understanding complex diseases like Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). The use of cell lines provides the advantage of genetic 
homogeneity, ensuring reproducible and consistent results. This article explores 
the application of mammalian cell cultures to model AD, focusing on the 
transfection of cells with key genes associated with the disease to replicate 
the cellular environment of AD. It explains various transfection methods and 
challenges related to the process. These models offer a robust platform for 
investigating cellular biology, molecular pathways, physiological processes, and 
drug discovery efforts. A range of assays, including RT-PCR, western blotting, 
ELISA, mitochondrial respiration, and reactive oxygen species analysis, are 
employed to assess the impact of genetic modifications on cellular functions and 
to screen potential AD therapies. Researchers often design experiments with 
multiple variables such as genetic modifications, chemical treatments, or time 
points, paired with positive and negative controls. By using a consistent 
control group across all conditions and under identical experimental conditions, 
researchers can minimize variability and enhance data reproducibility. This 
approach is particularly valuable in AD research, where small experimental 
differences can significantly influence outcomes. Using a shared control group 
ensures data comparability across experiments, saving time and resources by 
eliminating redundant control tests. This strategy not only streamlines the 
research process but also improves the reliability of results, making it a 
sensible, resource-efficient method that ultimately conserves public funding in 
the pursuit of AD treatments.

BACKGROUND: There is limited data on the use of rivastigmine oral solution in 
patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD).
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the tolerability, efficacy and physicians' satisfaction 
of Rivast® (rivastigmine oral solution 2 mg/ml) in Taiwanese patients with mild 
to moderate AD over a 52-week period.
METHODS: An open-label, non-comparative, observational study was conducted 
across four hospitals in Taiwan. 142 Patients with mild to moderate AD were 
enrolled. Adverse events and adherence rates were monitored throughout the 
52-week study period, while cognitive (Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)) and 
global functional outcomes (Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR)-Sum of Boxes) were 
recorded at baseline and at week 52. Factors associated with discontinuation, 
adverse events, and declines in cognitive and global function were determined.
RESULTS: The study achieved a 92.3% adherence rate, with 19% experiencing 
adverse events. The optimal dose was 3.8 ml, reached within 8.3 weeks. 43.7% of 
the patients reached an optimal dose of 4 ml and 59.8% achieved optimal dose 
within 4 weeks. Age and clinically significant electrocardiogram (EKG) 
abnormalities were associated with a higher risk of discontinuation, while 
female patients exhibited a lower risk. Additionally, both a higher initial dose 
and a higher optimal dose were associated with a reduced risk of adverse 
effects. Abnormal EKG findings were significantly associated with cognitive 
decline. More time to optimal dose was significantly associated with worse 
global function. All physicians regarded the medication is ease of use and the 
administration schedule is simple.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides valuable insights into the tolerability and 
efficacy of rivastigmine oral solution in Taiwanese patients with mild to 
moderate AD.

BACKGROUND: There are lines of evidence suggesting that cerebral 
microcirculatory dysfunction is involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). We have developed a low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) 
therapy that upregulates endothelial NO synthase with therapeutic angiogenesis. 
We demonstrated that the LIPUS therapy ameliorates cognitive declines in mouse 
models of AD and tended to do so in patients with early AD (mild AD and mild 
cognitive impairment due to AD) in the pilot trial. Thus, the Japanese 
government has designated our LIPUS device as the first breakthrough medical 
device in Japan.
OBJECTIVE: We are performing a pivotal clinical trial (LIPUS-AD) to finally 
address the efficacy and safety of our LIPUS therapy in patients with early AD 
in Japan.
METHODS: LIPUS-AD is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, in 
which a total of 220 patients with early AD, who are positive for amyloid-β (Aβ) 
PET, will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion. The LIPUS therapy is performed for the 
whole brain for one hour 3 times a week as one session under the special 
conditions (32 cycles, 0.5 MHz, 0.25 W/cm2). It is performed for 6 sessions with 
3-month intervals in the LIPUS group for 72 weeks, while the placebo group 
receives placebo therapy. Before and at 72 weeks of the trial, all subjects 
undergo brain Aβ PET and MRI and 9 cognitive functions tests. The primary 
efficacy endpoint is the changes in ADAS-J-cog-14 scores from baseline to 72 
weeks.
CONCLUSIONS: LIPUS-AD addresses efficacy and safety of the LIPUS therapy in 
patients with early AD.Clinical Trial Gov. No.: NCT05983575.

Background: Intermediate care services are designed to facilitate transition 
from medical dependence to functional independence, ultimately improving the 
overall quality of life. Despite the recognized benefits of intermediate care in 
rehabilitation, data on its impact on functional outcomes for older adults with 
stroke in low- and middle-income countries are limited. Objective: This 
systematic review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and outcomes of an 
intermediate care model among older adults with stroke. Methods: This systematic 
review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline. Scopus, EMBASE, PubMed, CINAHL, MEDLINE, 
Google Scholar, and reference lists of manually selected articles were searched. 
Only studies published in English from 2012 to 2023 were included. Randomized 
controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies focusing on functional 
improvement in motor function, activities of daily living (ADLs), and quality of 
life in older adults with stroke receiving home-based or community intermediate 
care were considered. Data extraction utilized the PICO framework. Three 
reviewers independently conducted a critical appraisal and risk of bias 
assessments, with two additional reviewers resolving any discrepancies. Results: 
Eleven studies from low- and middle-income countries were included. The 
interventions varied, encompassing exercise programs, therapy sessions, 
video-based programs, reminiscence therapy, and caregiver-assisted therapy, 
targeting various aspects of stroke recovery and rehabilitation. The 
interventions demonstrated positive effects on functional outcomes, 
significantly improving ADLs and overall quality of life. Conclusions: Despite 
variability in functional outcomes, the study highlights that implementing 
home-based intermediate care can be crucial for stroke patients in low-resource 
settings.

BACKGROUND: Clinical distinction between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia 
with Lewy bodies (DLB) poses significant challenges due to pathological 
comorbidity. Similar ages of onset and overlapping cognitive and psychiatric 
symptoms can lead to diagnostic inaccuracy and inappropriate treatment 
recommendations.
OBJECTIVE: Identify the best combination of clinical and neuropsychological 
predictors of AD, DLB, and mixed DLB/AD neuropathology in dementia patients.
METHODS: Using the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center dataset, we selected 
either pure AD (n = 189), DLB (n = 21), or mixed DLB/AD (n = 42) patients on 
autopsy. Neuropsychological and clinical predictors, including core clinical 
features of DLB, were entered into multivariable logistic regressions.
RESULTS: Gait disturbances (odds ratio (OR) = 19.32; p = 0.01), visual-spatial 
complaints (OR = 6.06; p = 0.03), and visual hallucinations (OR = 31.06; 
p = 0.002) predicted DLB compared to AD, along with better memory (OR = 3.42; 
p = 0.003), naming (OR = 3.35; p = 0.002), and worse processing speed (OR = 
0.51; p = 0.01). When comparing DLB to DLB/AD, gait disturbances (OR = 6.33; 
p = 0.01), increased depressive symptoms (OR = 1.44; p = 0.03), and better 
memory (OR = 3.01; p = 0.004) predicted DLB. Finally, rapid eye movement sleep 
behavior disorder (RBD) (OR = 6.44; p = 0.004), parkinsonism severity (OR = 
1.07; p = 0.02), and lower depressive symptoms (OR = 0.70; p = 0.006) and memory 
impairment (OR = 0.57; p = 0.02) distinguished DLB/AD from AD.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study converges with prior research suggesting specific 
neuropsychological and clinical features can help distinguish DLB from AD. 
Neuropsychological differentiation becomes more challenging among mixed 
pathologies and in advanced cognitive impairment, although the presence of RBD 
and parkinsonism distinguished DLB. Earlier clinical assessment and 
incorporation of in vivo and postmortem biomarkers should enhance diagnostic 
accuracy and understanding of disease characteristics, offering significant 
relevance for disease-modifying treatments.

BACKGROUND: This project has investigated the role of the Bacillus 
Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine as a potential treatment against Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD).
OBJECTIVE: To further establish that BCG treatment results in lower risk of ADRD 
through novel machine learning methods and to analyze the heterogeneity of 
treatment effects.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted from May 28, 1987 to May 
6, 2021, in patients who were 50 years or older and were diagnosed with 
non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Follow-up duration was 15-years. 
Machine learning algorithms using survival analysis and the random forest 
algorithm were the primary methods of data analysis.
RESULTS: The research has found that on average, NMIBC patients who received BCG 
treatment had a 6.9% (95% CI: 0.43%, 13.4%) lower risk of developing ADRD 
compared to those who did not. Heterogeneous treatment effects were also 
detected for those with a history of mental health disorders and also for those 
with a history of respiratory diseases. Those with mental health disorders were 
at a 14.7% (95% CI: 0.6%, 28.9%) reduced risk of ADRD if they received BCG 
treatment compared to no BCG treatment. Additionally, those taking BCG with 
respiratory diseases increased risk of ADRD by 13.6% (95% CI: 1.1%, 26.1%) 
compared to those with no BCG treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: BCG is associated with a lower risk of ADRD through novel analysis 
methods and has detected heterogeneity of treatment effects. This presents BCG 
as a potential low-cost method, with few side-effects, to prevent ADRD.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease 
characterized by the impairment of cognitive functions and neuronal loss. AD has 
no cure; current treatments like acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEI) 
alleviate symptoms but do not halt disease progression.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the effects and mechanisms of two novel AChEI 
hybrid compounds (TAHB3 and TA8Amino), regarding cytotoxicity, neuroprotection 
and neurodifferentiation in PC12 cells.
METHODS: The effects of TAHB3 and TA8Amino on neurodifferentiation were analyzed 
on PC12 cells which were treated with AChEI compounds for seven days, following 
morphological, and quantitative analyses to calculate the differentiation 
percentages, neurite length, and protein expression. Regarding cytotoxicity and 
neuroprotection assays, PC12 cells were differentiated into mature neurons, then 
treated with TAHB3 or TA8Amino, following a posttreatment with H2O2 (an inducer 
of oxidative damage); the analyses were performed using the XTT assay and flow 
cytometry.
RESULTS: The hybrid compound TAHB3 induced differentiation of PC12 cells, but 
TA8Amino did not cause the same effect. Both compounds did not show cytotoxic 
effects to PC12 cells and did not change the cell cycle progression, nor induce 
cell death. Only TAHB3 showed neuroprotective potential against 
induced-oxidative damage, and TAHB3 increased the levels of p-AKT, suggesting 
its action through the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that TAHB3 can induce neurodifferentiation, 
besides a neuroprotective activity, indicating the potential of AChEI hybrid 
compounds as novel candidates to be explored for the establishment of novel 
therapeutic strategies for patients with AD.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by cognitive decline and behavior impairments. Despite recent 
approvals of anti-amyloid antibodies, there remains a need for disease modifying 
and easily accessible therapies. Emerging evidence suggests that targeting the 
endocannabinoid system may hold promise for AD therapy as it plays a crucial 
role in different physiological processes, including learning, memory and 
anxiety, as well as inflammatory and immune responses.
OBJECTIVE: In this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of the 
synthetic cannabinoid WIN 55,212-2 on memory deficits in Tg4-42 transgenic mice.
METHODS: Tg4-42 mice were assigned to two treatment groups to investigate the 
preventive effects of WIN 55,212-2 after a prolonged washout period, as well as 
the therapeutic effects of WIN 55,212-2 on behavior. Furthermore, the effects of 
WIN 55,212-2 treatment on AD pathology, including inflammation, amyloid-β load, 
neurogenesis, and brain glucose metabolism, were evaluated.
RESULTS: Therapeutic WIN 55,212-2 treatment rescued recognition memory and 
spatial reference deficits in Tg4-42 mice. Furthermore, therapeutic WIN 55,212-2 
administration improved motor performance. In addition, preventative WIN 
55,212-2 treatment rescued spatial learning and reference memory deficits. 
Importantly, WIN 55,212-2 treatment did not affect anxiety-like behavior. 
However, therapeutic and preventative WIN 55,212-2 treatment resulted in an 
increase locomotor activity and swimming speed in Tg4-42 mice. WIN-treatment 
reduced microgliosis in the hippocampus of preventively treated mice and rescued 
brain glucose metabolism in therapeutically treated Tg4-42 mice.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings emphasize the therapeutic promise of the synthetic 
cannabinoid WIN 55,212-2 in alleviating behavioral and cognitive deficits linked 
to AD.

South University, Changsha, China.

BACKGROUND: In contrast to existing evidence focusing on high-income countries, 
this study offers novel insights into the demographic and geographical context 
that have yet to be explored in the existing literature. Comparatively, in 
Pakistan, cognitive impairment is one of the neglected disorders that can 
develop into dementia and Alzheimer's disease. As no treatment is available, 
lifestyle modifications are a valid intervention for cognitive health.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the relationship between physical 
functionality, adherence to the Mediterranean-DASH diet Intervention for 
Neurological Delay (MIND), and cognitive impairment among elderly individuals in 
Pakistan.
METHODS: From January to June 2023, this cross-sectional study recruited 462 
participants aged 65 and above. We used proven tools in gerontological research, 
such as the MIND diet quiz and Quick Physical Activity Rating scale (QPAR), to 
evaluate diet and physical activity levels. Cognitive function was assessed 
using the Mini-Mental State Examination.
RESULTS: Our analysis revealed that 26.40% of the participants had mild 
cognitive impairment, whereas 48.50% demonstrated low adherence to the MIND 
diet. The mean QPAR score was 20.51 ± 18.77. A significant association was found 
between lower physical activity levels and increased cognitive impairment 
(adjusted odds ratio 9.94, confidence interval (CI): 6.07-16.27). Additionally, 
higher adherence to the MIND diet correlated with reduced cognitive impairment 
(odds ratio 0.29, CI: 0.18-0.46).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the critical role of diet and physical 
activity in cognitive health among the elderly population. The study emphasizes 
the need for targeted public health interventions and further longitudinal 
research to explore the long-term effects of these factors on cognitive health.

de Sousse, Pôle technologique de Sousse, Sousse, Tunisie.

BACKGROUND: Significant advancements in neuroimaging have emerged over the past 
decade, notably through positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its 
precursor, mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Combining imaging modalities with 
machine learning (ML) techniques enhances diagnostic accuracy.
OBJECTIVE: To develop predictive models using pre-treatment brain imaging data 
to distinguish between normal controls (NC), MCI, and AD stages, improving 
diagnostic precision.
METHODS: We utilized the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database, 
processing 3D MRI, PET Florbetaben, and PET Flortaucipir images. Techniques 
included convolutional neural networks (CNN), fuzzy logic, and multi-layer 
perceptron (MLP). Feature extraction involved amyloid-β volume, tau protein 
levels, and empty space volumes.
RESULTS: The fuzzy logic approach achieved a classification accuracy of 99.1%, 
outperforming CNN (90.67%) and MLP (94%). Integration of multimodal data 
significantly enhanced performance compared to single-modality approaches.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that integrating advanced ML techniques with 
multimodal neuroimaging can effectively classify AD stages. These findings 
address critical gaps in early detection and provide a foundation for future 
clinical applications.

Lecanemab, an anti-amyloid therapy for early Alzheimer's disease, received 
approval by the FDA and Japan in 2023. Public response on social media was 
scrutinized, aiming to obtain insights into communication and treatment 
development. For 478 posts from X and Facebook, their sentiments on efficacy, 
safety, societal significance, and overall lecanemab impression were assessed by 
GPT-4 and the authors. Results indicated impressions were 43.7% negative, 26.6% 
neutral, and 29.7% positive. Social significance concerns dominated negative 
views. Specific attitude patterns were observed in the overall impression to 
lecanemab's approval. These insights highlight the need for targeted 
communication and research on anti-amyloid therapies.

BACKGROUND: Agitation is a common behavioral symptom in persons living with 
Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease-related dementias (AD/ADRD), 
especially in the setting of residential care. Pharmacologic and 
non-pharmacologic interventions are limited. Memesto is a wearable audio device 
designed to provide messages and music that can be scheduled or played on 
demand. The objective of this proof-of-principle study was to quantify whether 
Memesto can reduce agitation in persons with AD/ADRD.
METHODS: Persons living with AD/ADRD with a Clinical Global Impressions-Severity 
(CGI-S) average score of 4 or greater, one informal caregiver, and one formal 
caregiver (triad) were recruited from residential care facilities in the Midwest 
region of the United States. After consent and a two-week training period, the 
triad was monitored every two weeks from Baseline to Week 10 with the 
Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) agitation domain subscale (primary endpoint) 
and the CGI-S scale (secondary endpoint) with the last observation carried 
forward. The average score on the NPI agitation domain subscale and the CGI-S 
scale at Baseline and Week 10 as rated by the two caregivers were compared. A 
30% drop in the NPI agitation domain subscale in 50% of the persons living with 
AD/ADRD was considered a clinically meaningful finding.
RESULTS: Over thirteen months of recruitment, 9 triads were identified in 6 
residential care facilities in three Midwestern states. For the NPI agitation 
domain, 6 of 9 (67%) persons with AD/ADRD had a 30% reduction in the average 
caregiver ratings at Week 10. No adverse events were identified associated with 
the use of the device. Device usability was rated as positive based on a survey.
DISCUSSION: This study provided quantitative data on psychometrically sound 
agitation scales regarding a 10-week treatment course with Memesto after a 
two-week training period. The results were limited by the inability to recruit 
the desired set of 20 triads due to disruptions in care and staff at residential 
care facilities. Further effectiveness testing in a larger cohort with a sham 
control device is necessary.

BACKGROUND: Intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) is the standard treatment for acute 
ischemic stroke (AIS) to improve functional outcomes. Furthermore, AIS is an 
important risk factor for dementia. Limited evidence has shown the long-term 
benefit of IVT on dementia in Western countries.
OBJECTIVE: We aim to investigate the association between IVT and the risk of 
dementia in acute ischemic stroke patients in Asian population.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study using medical records from a medical 
center in Taiwan between 2017 and 2022 was conducted. We included acute ischemic 
stroke patients aged over 55 years old who had not previously been diagnosed 
with dementia. The primary outcome was incident dementia ascertained through 
dementia diagnosis in medical records. The inverse probability of 
treatment-weighted Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the 
association between IVT and incident dementia.
RESULTS: A total of 1471 patients with AIS were included. 939 (63.8%) were male, 
and the mean age was 70.7  ±  9.6 years. Among them, 19.1% of patients (n = 281) 
received IVT. The mean follow-up time was 2.6  ±  1.7 years. Although not 
statistically significant, the IVT was associated with a decreased risk of 
dementia (HR: 0.88 [95%CI 0.54-1.41)]).
CONCLUSIONS: The IVT was associated with lower risk of dementia, although not 
statistically significant, in reducing the incidence of dementia in Asian 
patients with ischemic stroke. Studies with larger sample sizes will be needed 
in the future.

BACKGROUND: Retina is a non-invasive channel for assessing changes in brain 
microvasculature, which has been implicated in the pathophysiology of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previous studies revealed significant relationship 
between clinically diagnosed AD and retinal vasculature. However, clinical 
diagnosis has limited sensitivity and specificity, and those investigations were 
conducted from traditional retinal fundus photographs which only captured a 
narrow section of the fundus.
OBJECTIVE: Determining changes in retinal vasculature from larger area of retina 
between subjects with positron emission tomography (PET) biomarker-confirmed AD 
compared to controls.
METHODS: Participants were recruited from the community and cognitive disorder 
clinics. Diagnosis of AD was confirmed by significant amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau 
uptake on PET scan. Retinal vasculature was imaged with ultra-widefield (UWF) 
scanning laser ophthalmoscopy and a series of vessel parameters were quantified 
using the semi-automated Singapore I Vessel Assessment (SIVA) software. 
Statistical analyses were adjusted for age, gender and systolic blood pressure. 
In addition, arteriole parameters were adjusted against the same measurements in 
venules, and vice versa.
RESULTS: Out of the 39 patients, 18 had radiologically confirmed AD. These 
individuals with AD showed significantly smaller arteriolar fractal dimension 
(p = 0.032) in UWF images and greater venular tortuosity (p = 0.011) in standard 
fundus images compared with controls. Presence of significant Aβ and tau burden 
was associated with lower arteriolar caliber (OR 3.857; 95% CI 1.014-14.67; 
p = 0.048).
CONCLUSIONS: Reduction of fractal dimension in retinal arterioles observed in 
UWF imaging is associated with cerebral Aβ and tau burden in people with 
biomarker-confirmed AD. Wide field retinal imaging provides an alternative 
perspective in demonstrating microvascular alterations related to AD in this 
pilot study.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasingly prevalent, leading to 
severe cognitive decline and a diminished quality of life for patients. Nucleus 
basalis of Meynert deep brain stimulation (NBM-DBS) is a potential treatment 
approach.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of NBM-DBS for AD 
patients.
METHODS: We conducted a clinical study involving 6 patients with severe AD who 
received NBM-DBS. The treatment's safety and efficacy were evaluated using 
cognitive function tests (Mini-Mental State Examination, Montreal Cognitive 
Assessment, Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale- cognitive subscale, Clinical 
Dementia Rating) and assessments of neuropsychiatric symptoms and sleep 
disorders (Functional Activity Questionnaire, Functional Independence Measure, 
Zarit Burden Interview, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, Hamilton Depression 
Rating Scale, Neuropsychiatric Inventory, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index).
RESULTS: NBM-DBS was safe, with no severe adverse events. It improved cognitive 
functions and self-care abilities without altering the disease's progression. 
Notably, NBM-DBS significantly alleviated neuropsychiatric symptoms and sleep 
disturbances.
CONCLUSIONS: NBM-DBS could be a promising therapeutic approach for severe AD, 
particularly for managing neuropsychiatric symptoms and sleep disorders. Further 
research is warranted to confirm these preliminary findings.

Sciences, International Research Centre, Sathyabama Institute of Science and 
Technology, Chennai, India.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative 
disorder, which subdues over 55 million people and finding a cure, still remains 
disenchanting. Indian medicinal herbs notably, Withania somnifera, Bacopa 
monnieri, Curcuma longa, and Clitoria ternatea are traditionally utilized for 
their memory-enhancing properties.
OBJECTIVE: We computationally investigated the therapeutic potential of four 
nootropic herbs by uncovering the molecular mechanisms underlying their 
treatment for AD.
METHODS: Cheminformatics, pharmacokinetics, and system pharmacology studies were 
carried out to predict the phytocompounds drug-like properties, protein targets, 
targets functional association and enrichment analysis. A comparative study was 
performed with phytocompounds and FDA-approved drugs. Investigation on the 
expression of protein targets in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex of the AD 
brain was performed. Network was constructed to depict the interaction between 
phytocompounds, drugs, and molecular targets.
RESULTS: Through comparative analysis, we found that the phytocompounds shared 
common targets with both FDA drugs and drugs under clinical trials. We 
identified potential active compounds notably, Withaferin A, Withanolide-D, 
Withanolide-E, Withanolide-G, and Humulene epoxide II, that can combat AD. 
Interestingly, the enzyme inhibition scores of the identified drugs were much 
higher than FDA-approved drugs. In addition, regulatory proteins such as AβPP, 
acetylcholinesterase, BACE1, and PTPN1 were the targets of 8, 16, 9, and 22 
phytocompounds, respectively. Nonetheless, AR and CYP19A, were the primary 
targets of most phytocompounds.
CONCLUSIONS: Herbal medicines can synergistically stimulate multiple protein 
targets, rendering a holistic and integrative treatment, encouraging a promising 
avenue to treat AD.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing public health problem in the 
aging population, with limited treatment options. We previously reported that 
Centella asiatica herb water extract (CAW) attenuates cognitive decline in 
murine models of AD and aging.
OBJECTIVE: To explore changes in the hippocampal metabolome associated with 
CAW's modulation of cognitive function and amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque load in aged 
Tg2576 and wild-type (WT) mice.
METHODS: We compared cognitive function, hippocampal Aβ plaque burden, and 
hippocampal metabolite profile in 20-month-old Tg2576 female mice and their WT 
littermates following 3-5 weeks treatment with CAW (0, 200, or 1000 mg/kg/d 
p.o.). Cognitive testing included contextual fear response (CFR) and novel 
object recognition task (NORT). Aβ plaque burden was measured via 
immunohistochemistry. Metabolomic profiles of mouse hippocampi were obtained 
using liquid chromatography coupled with high resolution tandem mass 
spectrometry.
RESULTS: CAW treatment resulted in dose-related improvements in CFR and NORT 
performance of Tg2576 and WT mice. However, while CFR correlated with 
neurosignaling and glycosylated ceramide levels, NORT performance correlated 
with lysophosphatidylcholines and oxidized metabolites, and Aβ accumulation was 
linked to elevated excitatory and suppressed inhibitory neurotransmission. Only 
a subset of the metabolite changes induced by CAW in Tg2576 mice represented a 
reversal of metabolite differences between Tg2576 and WT mice, suggesting the 
involvement of other pathways in CAW's cognitive effects.
CONCLUSIONS: Mechanisms underlying CAW's cognitive effects extend beyond 
reversing metabolic effects of Aβ accumulation. The data support the potential 
use of CAW to manage memory challenges in aged individuals with or without AD.

BACKGROUND: Severe Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by significant 
neuropsychiatric symptoms and sleep disorders, with limited effectiveness of 
conservative drug treatments. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) offers a potential 
alternative.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy, safety, and long-term outcomes of DBS 
versus conservative treatment in patients with severe AD.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 40 patients with severe AD diagnosed at the 
People's Liberation Army General Hospital from 2015 to 2022. Twenty patients 
received DBS, and twenty received conservative treatment. Treatment effects were 
assessed using standardized scales at three- and twelve-months post-treatment. 
Primary outcomes included changes in cognitive function [Mini-Mental State 
Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Alzheimer's Disease 
Rating Scale-Cognitive subscale, Clinical Dementia Rating). Secondary outcomes 
included quality of life, sleep quality, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and 
caregiver burden (Barthel Index, Functional Activity Questionnaire, Functional 
Independence Measure (FIM), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), Hamilton Anxiety 
Rating Scale (HAM-A), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), Pittsburgh Sleep 
Quality Index (PDQI), Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI)].
RESULTS: DBS patients showed significantly greater improvements in MMSE, MoCA, 
FIM, and ZBI scores than controls, suggesting improved cognitive function and 
quality of life, and reduced caregiver burden (p < 0.05). Notably, DBS 
significantly reduced HAM-A, HAM-D, and PSQI scores, and improved NPI scores 
more than controls, indicating significant amelioration of neuropsychiatric 
symptoms and sleep disorders (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: DBS is a safe and reversible treatment that potentially enhances 
cognitive function and quality of life in severe AD patients and alleviates 
caregiver burden. For the first time, we report that DBS also improves 
neuropsychiatric symptoms and sleep disorders, highlighting its clinical 
potential in AD.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
that impairs memory, language, and cognitive functions and currently has no 
definitive cure. Saraswata Ghrita (SG), a traditional Ayurvedic remedy 
administered nasally, offers a holistic approach and is believed to directly 
affect brain functions through its unique delivery route.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of SG in improving 
cognitive function and neurochemical biomarkers in a patient with AD. Key 
outcomes included electroencephalography-based excitation/inhibition (fE/I) 
ratio, and levels of phosphorylated Tau-181 (pTau-181), serotonin, dopamine, 
acetylcholine, and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA).
METHODS: A 90-day proof-of-concept clinical trial was conducted with one AD 
patient. Nasal administration of SG was performed twice daily. Measurements 
included EEG spectral power analysis across 1-48 Hz, cognitive function assessed 
by Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog), 
Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and 
Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease (QoL-AD) scales, and biochemical analyses 
of pTau-181, serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine, and DHEA.
RESULTS: Notable improvements were observed: ADAS-Cog score decreased from 40 to 
36, QoL-AD score increased from 23 to 31, MMSE score improved from 13 to 18, and 
MoCA score increased from 8 to 13. Biochemical markers showed a decrease in 
pTau-181 (12.50 pg/ml to 6.28 pg/ml), an increase in acetylcholine (13.73 pg/ml 
to 31.83 pg/ml), while serotonin and DHEA levels rose, and dopamine levels 
decreased (39.14 pg/ml to 36.21 pg/ml).
CONCLUSIONS: SG demonstrated potential in enhancing cognitive functions and 
neurochemical markers in AD, with the nasal route proving safe and effective. 
These findings suggest the value of traditional Ayurvedic treatments in 
contemporary AD management.

BACKGROUND: Previous evidence suggests serum concentrations of donepezil varies 
in clinical populations and that a dose higher than standard may have additional 
positive effect on cognition. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is a tool for 
dose optimization (DO) whereby treatment is adjusted based on previous 
quantification of the prescribed drug.
OBJECTIVE: Investigate whether TDM-based DO of donepezil or memantine improves 
clinical outcomes and/or reduce the frequency of adverse reactions (ARs) in 
neurodegenerative conditions commonly treated with these two study drugs.
METHODS: Single-blinded 1:1 randomized controlled study in an outpatient memory 
clinic. Eligible participants either newly diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease 
dementia (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), or Parkinson's disease dementia 
(PDD) scheduled for treatment with donepezil or memantine. The intervention 
group received TDM based DO. The control group received DO solely based on 
clinical assessment. Clinical outcomes were change in Mini-Mental State 
Examination, Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination, Neuropsychiatric Inventory, 
and Disability Assessment in Dementia from baseline to 12 months. Additionally, 
data on incidence and severity of ARs and proportion of participants with a 
serum concentration within the therapeutic reference range were collected.
RESULTS: 132 participants recruited (125 AD, 7 DLB, none with PDD) of whom 107 
completed the study (101 AD and 6 DLB), fewer in the control group than planned. 
Statistical analysis did not reveal significant differences between groups 
neither for clinical outcomes nor for frequency of ARs.
CONCLUSIONS: TDM based DO did not significantly improve clinical outcomes nor 
reduce the frequency of ARs albeit important caveats to the results apply.

Elucidating Alzheimer's disease (AD) prodromal symptoms can resolve the 
outstanding challenge of early diagnosis. Based on intrinsically related 
substrates of olfaction and spatial navigation, we propose a novel experimental 
framework for their conjoint study. Artificial intelligence-driven multimodal 
study combining self-collected olfactory and motion data with available big 
clinical datasets can potentially promote high-precision early clinical 
screenings to facilitate timely interventions targeting neurodegenerative 
progression.

The extraction of sulforaphane (SFN) is challenging due to its instability and 
low water solubility, with existing methods often involving toxic solvents or 
yielding low SFN. We optimized an endogenous extraction protocol for high SFN 
content, characterized by HPLC and LC-MS analyses. SFN remained stable in 
refrigerated broccoli sprout extract powder (BSEP) for over a month. BSEP showed 
four times higher oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) than the SFN 
standard, indicating high antioxidant capacity. It also reduced inflammatory 
responses by down-regulating COX-2, IL-6, and TNF-α gene expression in 
LPS-induced RAW 264.7 macrophages. Additionally, BSEP exhibited neuroprotective 
properties in amyloid-beta (1-42) (Aβ1-42)-induced Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
mice, enhancing memory and learning retention in water maze and passive 
avoidance tests. BSEP mitigated spatial cognitive impairment and improved memory 
function in Aβ1-42-induced memory-deficient mice. While BSEP did not alter 
acetylcholine (ACh) concentration, it improved memory and learning by inhibiting 
acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. BSEP with SFN content exceeding 200 mg/kg 
ameliorated neurobehavioral deficits and protected the brain from amyloid 
deposition, suggesting its therapeutic potential in AD treatment. We propose an 
eco-friendly form of SFN-rich BSEP for daily intake and commercial therapeutics.

Cholinesterase enzymes (BuChE and AChE) are privileged biological targets for 
the symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Indeed, inhibition of 
cholinesterase enzymes has been proven to improve the neurotransmission 
mechanisms in Alzheimer's disease patients. In this investigation, we attempt to 
highlight new cholinesterase inhibitors from natural products. For this purpose, 
secondary metabolites (299 phytoconstituents) of twenty-eight Medicinal plants 
were virtually screened using molecular docking, pharmacokinetic and 
toxicological analysis. Ten phytoconstituents (L82, L86, L92, L121, L148, L187, 
L211, L221, L228) exhibited their high binding affinity with BuChE, and five 
phytoconstituents, namely L119, L147, L149, L192 and L193, exhibited their 
strong binding ability with AChE. Subsequently, these phytoconstituents were 
evaluated for their ADMET properties. As result, L221 is predicted to be highly 
bioavailable and readily absorbed by the human intestinal tract without 
significant toxicity concerns, making it suitable for oral administration. 
Crucially, it can penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB), allowing it to 
effectively reach the central nervous system. Molecular dynamics simulations and 
MM-PBSA analysis revealed that the best-screened phytoconstituent form 
thermodynamically favorable and stable complex with the BuChE binding site. The 
conducted investigations highlighted promising outcomes that can orient towards 
the rational development of effective Cholinesterase inhibitors.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease for which there 
are no effective drugs. Kai-Xin-San (KXS), with definite curative effects, is 
widely used for the prevention and treatment of AD in China. But its mechanism 
is not yet fully understood. Based on our established rat model and previous 
pharmacodynamics study, Multi-omics (metabolomics, proteomics) and network 
analysis were integrated to explore the holistic mechanism of anti-AD effects of 
KXS. The key pathways were validated with western blot and ELISA methods. Morris 
water maze and Nissl staining showed that KXS could ameliorate cognitive 
deficits and pathological morphology of the hippocampus in AD rats. A total of 
nine metabolites were identified, which were related to pyrimidine metabolism, 
riboflavin metabolism, tyrosine metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, and 
glycerophospholipid metabolism. Proteomics results indicated that the 
improvement of cognitive deficits by KXS was closely related to the regulation 
of oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. Western blotting results showed 
that KXS significantly inhibited the expression of Mt-nd2 and Ndufb6 in AD rats. 
Integrated analysis indicated that the anti-AD targets of KXS were interrelated 
and KXS could exert its anti-AD effect by reducing oxidative stress, 
neurotoxicity, and inflammation.

BACKGROUND: Identification of at-risk individuals who would benefit from early 
intervention for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) is critical as 
new treatments are developed. Measures of retinal health could offer accessible 
and low-cost indication of pre-morbid disease risk, but their association with 
ADRD risk is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether midlife retinal neuronal and microvascular 
measures are associated with ADRD risk-index scores and individual domains of 
ADRD risk.
METHODS: Data were from the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development 
Study, a population-representative longitudinal New Zealand-based birth cohort 
study. 94.1% (N = 938) of living Study members were seen at age 45 (2017-2019). 
Retinal neuronal (retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and ganglion cell-inner 
plexiform layer (GC-IPL)) and microvascular (arterioles and venules) measures 
were used as predictors. Outcome measures were four top ADRD risk indexes 
(CAIDE, LIBRA, Lancet, and ADU-ADRI), and a comprehensive midlife ADRD risk 
index, the DunedinARB.
RESULTS: Poorer retinal microvascular health (narrower arterioles and wider 
venules) was associated with greater ADRD risk (βs = 0.16-0.31; ps < 0.001). 
Thinner RNFL was modestly associated with higher ADRD risk (βs = 0.05-0.08; 
ps = 0.02-0.13). Follow-up tests of distinct domains of ADRD risk indicated that 
while RNFL associations reflected cardiometabolic risk only, microvascular 
measures were associated with diverse ADRD risk factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Measures of retinal health, particularly microvascular measures, 
successfully capture ADRD risk across several domains of known risk factors, 
even at the young midlife age of 45 years. Retinal microvascular imaging may be 
an accessible, scalable, and relatively low-cost method of assessing ADRD risk 
among middle-aged adults.

BACKGROUND: Novel ultrasound neuromodulation techniques allow therapeutic brain 
stimulation with unmet precision and non-invasive targeting of deep brain areas. 
Transcranial pulse stimulation (TPS), a multifrequency sonication technique, is 
approved for the clinical treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we 
present the largest real-world retrospective analysis of ultrasound 
neuromodulation therapy in dementia (AD, vascular, mixed) and mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI).
METHODS: The consecutive sample involved 58 patients already receiving 
state-of-the-art treatment in an open-label, uncontrolled, retrospective study. 
TPS therapy typically comprises 10 sessions (range 8-12) with individualized 
MRI-based target areas defined according to brain pathology and individual 
pathophysiology. We compared the CERAD-Plus neuropsychological test battery 
results before and after treatment, with the CERAD Corrected Total Score ( CTS) 
as the primary outcome. Furthermore, we analyzed side effects reported by 
patients during the treatment period.
RESULTS: CERAD Corrected Total Score (CTS) significantly improved (p = .017, 
d = .32) after treatment (Baseline: M = 56.56, SD = 18.56; Post-treatment: 
M = 58.65, SD = 19.44). The group of top-responders (top quartile) improved even 
by 9.8 points. Fewer than one-third of all patients reported any sensation 
during treatment. Fatigue and transient headaches were the most common, with no 
severe adverse events.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings implicate TPS as a novel and safe add-on therapy for 
patients with dementia or MCI with the potential to further improve current 
state-of-the-art treatment results. Despite the individual benefits, further 
randomized, sham-controlled, longitudinal clinical trials are needed to 
differentiate the effects of verum and placebo.

PURPOSE: This study explores the application of machine learning to 
high-dimensional proteomics datasets for identifying Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
biomarkers. AD, a neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions worldwide, 
necessitates early and accurate diagnosis for effective management.
METHODS: We leverage Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) proteomics data from the 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from the frontal cortex of patients with 
idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH), a condition often comorbid with 
AD, with rare access to both lumbar and ventricular samples. Our methodology 
includes extensive data preprocessing to address batch effects and missing 
values, followed by the use of the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique 
(SMOTE) for data augmentation to overcome the small sample size. We apply 
linear, and non-linear machine learning models, and ensemble methods, to compare 
iNPH patients with and without biomarker evidence of AD pathology ( Aβ-T- or 
Aβ+T+ ) in a classification task.
RESULTS: We present a machine learning workflow for working with 
high-dimensional TMT proteomics data that addresses their inherent data 
characteristics. Our results demonstrate that batch effect correction has no or 
minor impact on the models' performance and robust feature selection is critical 
for model stability and performance, especially in the high-dimensional 
proteomics data setting for AD diagnostics. The results further indicated that 
removing features with missing values produced stronger models than imputing 
them, and the batch effect had minimal impact on the models Our best-performing 
disease-progression detection model, a random forest, achieves an AUC of 0.84 (± 
0.03).
CONCLUSION: We identify several novel protein biomarkers candidates, such as 
FABP3 and GOT1, with potential diagnostic value for AD pathology detection, 
suggesting the necessity of different biomarkers for AD diagnoses for patients 
with iNPH, and considering different biomarkers for ventricular and lumbar CSF 
samples. This work underscores the importance of a meticulous machine learning 
process in enhancing biomarker discovery. Our study also provides insights in 
translating biomarkers from other central nervous system diseases like iNPH, and 
both ventricular and lumbar CSF samples for biomarker discovery, providing a 
foundation for future research and clinical applications.

BACKGROUND: We investigated how cerebrospinal fluid levels of synaptic proteins 
associate with memory function in normal cognition (CN) and mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI), and investigated the effect of amyloid positivity on these 
associations.
METHODS: We included 242 CN (105(43%) abnormal amyloid), and 278 MCI individuals 
(183(66%) abnormal amyloid) from the European Medical Information Framework for 
Alzheimer's Disease Multimodal Biomarker Discovery (EMIF-AD MBD) and the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). For 181 (EMIF-AD MBD) and 36 
(ADNI) proteins with a synaptic annotation in SynGO, associations with word 
learning recall were analysed with linear models.
RESULTS: Subsets of synaptic proteins showed lower levels with worse recall in 
preclinical AD (EMIF-AD MBD: 7, ADNI: 5 proteins, none overlapping), prodromal 
AD (EMIF-AD MBD only, 27 proteins) and non-AD MCI (EMIF-AD MBD: 1, ADNI: 7 
proteins). The majority of these associations were specific to these clinical 
groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Synaptic disturbance-related memory impairment occurred very early 
in AD, indicating it may be relevant to develop therapies targeting the synapse 
early in the disease.

This systematic review sought to assess the impact of nicotinamide adenine 
dinucleotide (NAD+) precursors on cognitive impairments in several diseases in 
rat/mouse models. Accumulating evidence suggests that inflammation, apoptosis, 
oxidative stress responses, and mitochondrial dysfunction are potential factors 
of cognitive deficits in aging, Alzheimer's disease (AD), diabetes, traumatic 
brain injury (TBI), vascular dementia (VAD), and schizophrenia. NAD+ precursors 
have received increased interest due to their unique molecular structure targets 
antioxidant and inflammatory pathways and mitochondrial function. The PubMed, 
Scopus, Google Scholar, Embase, and Web of Science databases were searched 
through May 30, 2024. Studies investigating the effect of NAD+ precursors on 
cognitive impairments in rodent models were included. Two reviewers 
independently extracted and evaluated the data. The PRISMA guidelines for 
reporting systematic reviews were followed. Thirty preclinical studies were 
included in the review. Studies have revealed that treatment with NAD+ rescues 
cognitive deficits by inhibiting inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis 
and improving mitochondrial function. Preclinical evidence has demonstrated that 
treatment with NAD+ precursors may be more effective in learning and memory 
recovery in AD, TBI, diabetes, aging, VAD, and schizophrenia. The outcomes of 
this investigation may lead to additional studies on the use of NAD+ precursors 
for treating human cognitive decline.

Microglia, the innate immune cells of the central nervous system, have been 
genetically implicated in multiple neurodegenerative diseases. Mapping the 
genetics of gene expression in human microglia has identified several loci 
associated with disease-associated genetic variants in microglia-specific 
regulatory elements. However, identifying genetic effects on splicing is 
challenging because of the use of short sequencing reads. Here, we present the 
isoform-centric microglia genomic atlas (isoMiGA), which leverages long-read RNA 
sequencing to identify 35,879 novel microglia isoforms. We show that these 
isoforms are involved in stimulation response and brain region specificity. We 
then quantified the expression of both known and novel isoforms in a 
multi-ancestry meta-analysis of 555 human microglia short-read RNA sequencing 
samples from 391 donors, and found associations with genetic risk loci in 
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. We nominate several loci that may act 
through complex changes in isoform and splice-site usage.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and atherosclerosis (AS) are two chronic diseases with 
seemingly distinct pathologies. However, emerging research points to a 
bidirectional relationship driven by common mechanisms, such as inflammation, 
oxidative stress, and dysregulation of Amyloid-Beta (Aβ). This review focuses on 
the role of Aβ as a critical molecular link between AD and AS, emphasizing its 
contribution to neuronal impairment and vascular damage. Specifically, 
peripheral Aβ produced in the pancreas and skeletal muscle tissues exacerbates 
AS by promoting endothelial dysfunction and insulin resistance (IR). 
Furthermore, AS accelerates AD progression by impairing cerebral blood flow and 
inducing chronic hypoxia, causing Aβ accumulation. This review critically 
evaluates recent findings, highlighting inconsistencies in clinical studies and 
suggesting future research directions. Understanding the bidirectional influence 
of AD and AS could pave the way for novel therapeutic approaches targeting 
shared molecular pathways, particularly emphasizing Aβ clearance and 
inflammation.

Transactive response (TAR) DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is a critical 
RNA/DNA-binding protein involved in various cellular processes, including RNA 
splicing, transcription regulation, and RNA stability. Mislocalization and 
aggregation of TDP-43 in the cytoplasm are key features of the pathogenesis of 
several neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
(ALS), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). This review 
provides a comprehensive retrospective and prospective analysis of TDP-43 
research, highlighting structural insights, significant milestones, and the 
evolving understanding of its physiological and pathological functions. We 
delineate five major stages in TDP-43 research, from its initial discovery as a 
pathological hallmark in neurodegeneration to the recent advances in 
understanding its liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) behavior and 
interactions with cellular processes. Furthermore, we assess therapeutic 
strategies targeting TDP-43 pathology, categorizing approaches into direct and 
indirect interventions, alongside modulating aberrant TDP-43 LLPS. We propose 
that future research will focus on three critical areas: targeting TDP-43 
structural polymorphisms for disease-specific therapeutics, exploring dual 
temporal-spatial modulation of TDP-43, and advancing nano-therapy. More 
importantly, we emphasize the importance of understanding TDP-43's functional 
repertoire at the mesoscale, which bridges its molecular functions with broader 
cellular processes. This review offers a foundational framework for advancing 
TDP-43 research and therapeutic development.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a common neurodegenerative disease, which 
characterized by amyloid Aβ deposition and neurofibrillary tangles. Astragalin 
(AST), a natural flavonoid, has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-cancer, and 
other pharmacological effects. Astrocytes can phagocytize and degrade Aβ in 
their vicinity. In this study, we used the AD mice model established by 
injecting the mixture of Aβ1-42 and Aβ25-35 into the CA1 region of the 
hippocampus, and C8D1A cells injured by Aβ1-42 to explore the neuroprotective 
effects of AST. Our findings showed that AST enhances learning and cognitive 
ability of AD mice, reduces Aβ deposition and neurofibrillary tangles in the 
brain, and improves the structural morphology of hippocampal nerve cells. 
Furthermore, AST promoted autophagy and suppressed apoptosis of astrocytes in 
the AD model. Additionally, AST inhibited the expression of proteins associated 
with the Fas/Fasl-VDAC1 signaling pathway, while autophagy inhibitor chloroquine 
(CQ) or apoptosis agonist phenoxodiol reversed above change. Interestingly, 
consistent with the action of pathway Fas inhibitor KR-33493, AST could activate 
autophagy of Aβ1-42 injured C8D1A cells while inhibit their apoptosis. In 
conclusion, AST activated autophagy and inhibited apoptosis of hippocampal 
astrocytes in AD mice, ameliorating animal cognitive deficits by down-regulating 
Fas/Fasl-VDAC1 signaling pathway. Thus, this study provided a new perspective 
and experimental foundation for developing AD treatment drugs.

INTRODUCTION: The microbiome-gut-brain axis, by modulating bidirectional immune, 
metabolic, and neural signaling pathways in the host, has emerged as a target 
for the prevention and treatment of psychiatric and neurological disorders. Oral 
administration of the probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG; ATCC 
53103) exhibits anti-inflammatory effects, although the precise mechanisms by 
which LGG benefits host physiology and behavior are not known. The goal of this 
study was to explore the general effects of LGG on the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
proteome and a biological signature of anti-inflammatory signaling in the 
central nervous system (CNS) of undisturbed, adult male rats.
METHODS: Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomics were 
conducted using CSF samples collected after 21 days of oral treatment with live 
LGG (3.34 × 107 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL in the drinking water (resulting 
in an estimated delivery of ∼1.17 × 109 CFU/day/rat) or water vehicle. Gene 
enrichment analysis (using DAVID, v. 6.8) and protein-protein interactions 
(using STRING, v. 11) were used to explore physiological network changes in CSF. 
Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR) was 
performed to assess gene expression changes of anti-inflammatory cytokines in 
the hippocampus. Genes associated with anti-inflammatory signaling that were 
analyzed included Il10, Tgfb1, Il4, and IL-4-responsive genes, Cd200, Cd200r1, 
and Mrc1 (Cd206).
RESULTS: Oral LGG administration altered the abundance of CSF proteins, 
increasing the abundance of five proteins (cochlin, NPTXR, reelin, Sez6l, and 
VPS13C) and decreasing the abundance of two proteins (CPQ, IGFBP-7) in the CSF. 
Simultaneously, LGG increased the expression of Il10 mRNA, encoding the 
anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 10, in the hippocampus.
CONCLUSION: Oral LGG altered the abundance of CSF proteins associated with 
extracellular scaffolding, synaptic plasticity, and glutamatergic signaling. 
These data are consistent with the hypothesis that oral administration of LGG 
improves memory and cognition, and promotes a physiological resilience to 
neurodegenerative disease, by increasing glutamatergic signaling and promoting 
an anti-inflammatory environment in the brain.

Modality Imbalance? Dynamic Multi-Modal Knowledge Distillation in Automatic 
Alzheimer's Disease Recognition.

Dong Z, Xu W, Xu X, Zhang Z.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), as the most prevalent form of dementia, necessitates 
early identification and treatment for the critical enhancement of patients' 
quality of life. Recent studies strive to explore advanced machine learning 
approaches with multiple information cues, such as speech and text, to 
automatically and precisely detect this disease from conversations. However, 
these multi-modality-based approaches often suffer from a modality-imbalance 
challenge that leads to performance degradation. That is, the multi-modal model 
performs worse than the best mono-modal model, although the former contains more 
information. To address this issue, we propose a Dynamic Multi-Modal Knowledge 
Distillation (DMMKD) approach, which dynamically identify the dominant modality 
and the weak modality, and opt to conduct an inter(cross)-modal or intra-modal 
knowledge distillation. The core idea is to balance the individual learning 
speed in the multi-modal learning process by boosting the weak modality with the 
dominant modality. To evaluate the effectiveness of the introduced DMMKD 
algorithm, we conducted extensive experiments on two publicly available and 
widely used AD datasets, i. e., ADReSSo and ADReSS-M. Compared to the 
multi-modal approaches without dealing with the modality imbalance issue, the 
introduced DMMKD indicates substantial performance improvements by 15.4% and 
10.9% in terms of relative accuracy on the ADReSSo and ADReSS-M datasets, 
respectively. Moreover, when compared to the state-of-the-art models for 
automatic AD detection, the DMMKD achieves the best performance of 91.5% and 
87.0% accuracies on the two datasets, respectively.

CPST-GAN: Conditional Probabilistic State Transition Generative Adversarial 
Network With the Biomedical Large Foundation Models.

Wang Q, Xu L, Shan Y, Shen W, Li L, Bi XA, Liu Z.

The risk prediction of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial for its early 
prevention and treatment. However, current risk prediction methods face 
challenges in effectively extracting and fusing multiomics features, 
particularly overlooking the multilevel evolutionary mechanisms of AD. This 
article combines biomedical large foundation models with the conditional 
generative adversarial network (GAN) to mine the evolutionary patterns of AD by 
considering the regulatory effect of genes on brain lesions. Specifically, we 
first use biomedical large foundation models to effectively construct 
high-quality imaging genetic features. Next, a conditional probabilistic state 
transition mathematical model is constructed to describe AD progression as state 
transitions of brain regions under genetic regulations. Based on the 
mathematical model, a conditional probabilistic state transition GAN (CPST-GAN) 
is proposed. This algorithm can mine the dynamic evolutionary patterns of AD by 
fusing brain imaging and genetic features to achieve risk prediction of AD. 
Finally, experiments on the public imaging genetics datasets validate the 
effectiveness and superiority of CPST-GAN in evolutionary pattern mining and 
risk prediction of AD. This article not only provides a reliable intelligence 
algorithm for early intervention of AD but also offers new insights for future

Neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's lead to the 
gradual decline of the nervous system, resulting in cognitive and motor 
impairments. With an aging population, the prevalence and associated healthcare 
costs are anticipated to rise. Misfolded protein aggregates are central to these 
diseases, disrupting cellular function and causing neuronal death. Preventing 
these toxic aggregates could preserve neurons and slow disease progression. 
Understanding how to inhibit protein aggregation is crucial for developing 
effective treatments. We explored the effect of nalidixic acid (NA) on protein 
aggregation using human serum albumin (HSA) as model protein. In vitro assays 
demonstrated that NA significantly reduced ThT fluorescence by 47.10 % and 
decreased turbidity by 63.07 %. NA also protected the protein's hydrophobic 
surfaces. The α-helical content of HSA dropped from 56.23 % to 11.43 % but was 
restored to 38.53 % with NA. We then utilized advanced molecular simulations to 
understand the kinetics and mechanism of aggregation inhibition by NA. Binding 
studies showed that NA attaches to HSA's subdomain IIA with a binding energy of 
-7.8 kcal/mol through hydrogen bonds, Van der Waals forces, and hydrophobic 
interactions. Molecular simulations confirmed the stability of HSA-NA complex. 
Additionally, NA increased solvent accessibility of HSA282-292 oligomers, 
reduced hydrogen bonding, and prevented β-sheet formation. Compared to existing 
anti-aggregation strategies, NA offers a promising alternative with its 
potential therapeutic applications in neurodegenerative diseases by stabilizing 
protein structures and preventing misfolding. These findings highlight NA's 
potential as a candidate for inhibiting protein aggregation and offer insights 
for therapeutic approaches. Further experimental studies utilizing in vivo 
models are needed to validate the anti-aggregation potential of NA.

Transcranial Focused Ultrasound Modifies Disease Progression in SOD1G93A Mouse 
Model of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.

Hong Z, Yi S, Deng M, Zhong Y, Zhao Y, Li L, Zhou H, Xiao Y, Hu X, Niu L.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressively worsening 
neurodegenerative condition with very few treatment options available. 
Ultrasound neuromodulation offers promising benefits for treating 
neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. 
However, the effects and underlying mechanisms of ultrasound neuromodulation on 
ALS remain unclear. A head-mounted ultrasound neuromodulation system was 
developed to noninvasively stimulate the motor cortex of symptomatic mice 
carrying the G93A human SOD1 mutation (SOD $1^{\text {G93A}}$ ) for four weeks. 
Motor performance was assessed through the rotarod locomotor test, grip strength 
test, and open field test. In addition, the effect of ultrasound stimulation on 
the elastic modulus of gastrocnemius muscle atrophy was measured using real-time 
shear wave elastography (SWE). Subsequently, the brain tissues of the mice were 
harvested. Gastrocnemius morphology was examined using hematoxylin-eosin and 
Gomori aldehyde-fuchsin (GAF) staining. The number of neurons and the phenotype 
of microglia in the motor cortex were observed by immunohistochemical analysis. 
Ultrasound therapy delayed disease onset by 10.7% and increased the lifespan by 
6.7% in SOD $1^{\text {G93A}}$ mice by reduction of neuronal loss and 
enhancement of M2 microglia in the motor cortex. Furthermore, we found 
significant improvements in motor function for ultrasound-treated mice. More 
importantly, ultrasound stimulation ameliorated gastrocnemius muscle atrophy in 
the SOD $1^{\text {G93A}}$ mice. These results revealed the neuroprotective 
effects of ultrasound against the disease pathogenesis of SOD $1^{\text {G93A}}$ 
mice. Transcranial ultrasound neuromodulation provides an innovative tool for 
the intervention and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

Background: Curcumin, a polyphenolic compound derived from Curcuma longa, 
exhibits significant neuroprotective potential due to its diverse 
pharmacological properties.Objective: This review explores curcumin's role in 
modulating key pathological mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative disorders 
such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's diseases, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, 
Huntington's Disease and Prion Disease.Methods: A comprehensive analysis of 
curcumin's molecular interactions, including its effects on amyloid-beta (Aβ) 
aggregation, tau hyperphosphorylation, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and 
metal-induced neurotoxicity, was conducted. Additionally, strategies to overcome 
its low bioavailability and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability were 
evaluated.Results: Curcumin inhibits Aβ aggregation and promotes disaggregation, 
reducing amyloid plaque formation in Alzheimer's disease. It modulates glial 
cell activity, attenuating neuroinflammation and fostering a neuroprotective 
environment. By interacting with tau proteins, curcumin prevents 
hyperphosphorylation and neurofibrillary tangle formation. As a potent 
antioxidant, it scavenges reactive oxygen species, mitigating oxidative 
stress-related neuronal damage. Its metal-chelating properties further diminish 
neurotoxicity by sequestering iron and copper ions. Despite its limited 
bioavailability and BBB permeability, curcumin's therapeutic efficacy can be 
enhanced using nanocarriers such as nanoparticles, liposomes, and micelles, 
which improve solubility, stability, and brain penetration.Conclusion: 
Curcumin's multifaceted neuroprotective mechanisms make it a promising candidate 
for preventing or slowing neurodegenerative disease progression. Advanced drug 
delivery systems hold potential for overcoming its pharmacokinetic limitations, 
paving the way for future clinical applications.

IMPORTANCE: Alzheimer disease (AD) predominates in females at almost twice the 
rate relative to males. Mounting evidence in adults without AD indicates that 
females exhibit higher tau deposition than age-matched males, particularly in 
the setting of elevated β-amyloid (Aβ), but the evidence for sex differences in 
tau accumulation rates is inconclusive.
OBJECTIVE: To examine whether female sex is associated with faster tau 
accumulation in the setting of high Aβ (as measured with positron emission 
tomography [PET]) and the moderating influence of sex on the association between 
APOEε4 carrier status and tau accumulation.
DATA SOURCES: This meta-analysis used data from 6 longitudinal aging and AD 
studies, including the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, Berkeley 
Aging Cohort Study, BioFINDER 1, Harvard Aging Brain Study, Mayo Clinic Study of 
Aging, and Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer Prevention. Longitudinal data were 
collected between November 2004 and May 2022.
STUDY SELECTION: Included studies required available longitudinal 
[18F]flortaucipir or [18F]-MK-6240 tau-PET scans, as well as baseline [11C] 
Pittsburgh Compound B, [18F]flutemetamol or [18F]florbetapir Aβ-PET scans. 
Recruitment criteria varied across studies. Analyses began on August 7, 2023, 
and were completed on February 5, 2024.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: In each study, primary analyses extracted 
estimates for the sex (female or male) and the sex by baseline Aβ-PET status 
(high or low) association with longitudinal tau-PET using a series of 
mixed-effects models. Secondary mixed-effects models extracted the interaction 
estimate for the association of sex by APOEε4 carrier status with longitudinal 
tau-PET. Study-specific estimates for each mixed-effects model were then pooled 
in a meta-analysis, and the global fixed effect (β) and total heterogeneity (I2) 
across studies were estimated. This study is reported following the Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting 
guideline.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Seven tau-PET outcomes that showed cross-sectional 
sex differences were examined across temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes.
RESULTS: Among 6 studies assessed, there were 1376 participants (761 [55%] 
female; mean [range] age at first tau scan, 71.9 [46-93] years; 401 participants 
[29%] with high baseline Aβ; 412 APOEε4 carriers [30%]). Among individuals with 
high baseline Aβ, female sex was associated with faster tau accumulation 
localized to inferior temporal (β = -0.14; 95% CI, -0.22 to -0.06; P = .009) 
temporal fusiform (β = -0.13; 95% CI, -0.23 to -0.04; P = .02), and lateral 
occipital regions (β = -0.15; 95% CI, -0.24 to -0.06; P = .009) compared with 
male sex. Among APOEε4 carriers, female sex was associated with faster 
inferior-temporal tau accumulation (β = -0.10; 95% CI, -0.16 to -0.03; P = .01).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that sex differences in the 
pathological progression of AD call for sex-specific timing considerations when 
administrating anti-Aβ and anti-tau treatments.

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of dementia is expected to rise with an aging 
population, necessitating accessible early detection methods. Serious games have 
emerged as potential cognitive screening tools. They provide not only an 
engaging platform for assessing cognitive function but also serve as valuable 
indicators of cognitive health through engagement levels observed during play.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the differences in engagement-related 
behaviors between older adults with and without dementia during serious gaming 
sessions. Further, it seeks to identify the key contributors that enhance the 
effectiveness of machine learning for dementia classification based on 
engagement-related behaviors.
METHODS: This was an exploratory proof-of-concept study. Over 8 weeks, 20 older 
adults, 6 of whom were living with dementia, were enrolled in a single-case 
design study. Participants played 1 of 4 "Vibrant Minds" serious games 
(Bejeweled, Whack-A-Mole, Mah-jong, and Word-Search) over 8 weeks (16 30-min 
sessions). Throughout the study, sessions were recorded to analyze 
engagement-related behaviors. This paper reports on the analysis of the 
engagement-related behaviors of 15 participants. The videos of these 15 
participants (10 cognitively intact, 5 with dementia) were analyzed by 2 
independent raters, individually annotating engagement-related behaviors at 
15-second intervals using a coding system. This analysis resulted in 1774 data 
points categorized into 47 behavior codes, augmented by 54 additional features 
including personal characteristics, technical issues, and environmental factors. 
Each engagement-related behavior was compared between older adults living with 
dementia and older adults without dementia using the χ² test with a 2×2 
contingency table with a significance level of .05. Codes underwent one-hot 
encoding and were processed using random forest classifiers to distinguish 
between participant groups.
RESULTS: Significant differences in 64% of engagement-related behaviors were 
found between groups, notably in torso movements, voice modulation, facial 
expressions, and concentration. Including engagement-related behaviors, 
environmental disturbances, technical issues, and personal characteristics 
resulted in the best model for classifying cases of dementia correctly, 
achieving an F1-score of 0.91 (95% CI 0.851-0.963) and an area under the 
receiver operating curve of 0.99 (95% CI 0.984-1.000).
CONCLUSIONS: Key features distinguishing between older adults with and without 
dementia during serious gameplay included torso, voice, facial, and 
concentration behaviors, as well as age. The best performing machine learning 
model identified included features of engagement-related behavios, environmental 
disturbances, technical challenges, and personal attributes. Engagement-related 
behaviors observed during serious gaming offer crucial markers for identifying 
dementia. Machine learning models that incorporate these unique behavioral 
markers present a promising, noninvasive approach for early dementia screening 
in a variety of settings.

Dimensional reduction analysis of available data for white matter of the brain 
allows to locate the normal (homeostatic), Glioblastoma and Alzheimer's disease 
attractors in gene expression space and to identify paths related to transitions 
like carcinogenesis or Alzheimer's disease onset. A predefined path for aging is 
also apparent, which is consistent with the hypothesis of programmatic aging. In 
addition, reasonable assumptions about the relative strengths of attractors 
allow to draw a schematic landscape of fitness: a Wright's diagram. These simple 
diagrams reproduce known relations between aging, Glioblastoma and Alzheimer's 
disease, and rise interesting questions like the possible connection between 
programmatic aging and Glioblastoma in this tissue. We anticipate that similar 
multiple diagrams in other tissues could be useful in the understanding of the 
biology of apparently unrelated diseases or disorders, and in the discovery of 
unexpected clues for their treatment.

Microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, continuously 
monitor the brain's microenvironment through their array of specific receptors. 
Once brain function is altered, microglia are recruited to specific sites to 
perform their immune functions, including phagocytosis of misfolded proteins, 
cellular debris, and apoptotic cells to maintain homeostasis. When toxic 
substances are overproduced, microglia are over-activated to produce large 
amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which induce chronic inflammatory 
responses and lead to neurotoxicity. Additionally, microglia can also monitor 
and protect neuronal function through microglia-neuron crosstalk. Microglia 
receptors are important mediators for microglia to receive external stimuli, 
regulate the functional state of microglia, and transmit signals between cells. 
In this paper, we first review the role of microglia-expressed receptors in the 
pathogenesis and treatment of Alzheimer's disease; moreover, we emphasize the 
complexity of targeting microglia for therapeutic interventions in 
neurodegenerative disorders to inform the discovery of new biomarkers and the 
development of innovative therapeutics.

Increasing evidence suggests that Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis strongly 
correlates with neuroinflammation. Peripheral monocytes are crucial components 
of the human immune system that may play a role in neuroinflammation, but their 
contribution to AD pathogenesis is largely understudied partially due to the 
lack of appropriate human models. Here, we present human cortical organoid 
microphysiological systems (hCO-MPSs) for modeling dynamic AD neuroinflammation 
mediated by monocytes. By incorporating 3D printed devices into an existing 
cortical organoid protocol, 96 hCO-MPSs can be established with significantly 
reduced necrosis and hypoxia as well as enhanced viability within a commonly 
used 96 well plate, and each hCO-MPS consists of a doughnut-shaped hCO and a 3D 
printed device per well. Using this approach, monocytes from AD patients exhibit 
higher infiltration, decreased amyloid-beta (Aβ) clearance, and stronger 
inflammatory responses compared to monocytes from age-matched control donors. 
Moreover, pro-inflammatory effects such as elevated astrocyte activation and 
neuronal apoptosis were observed to be induced by AD monocytes. Furthermore, the 
significant increase in the expression of IL1B and CCL3, both at the 
transcriptional and protein levels, indicated the pivotal role of these cytokine 
and chemokine in monocyte-mediated AD neuroinflammation. Our findings provide 
insight for understanding monocytes' role in AD pathogenesis, and the 
user-friendly MPS models we present are compatible with existing laboratory 
settings, highlighting their potential for modeling neuroinflammation and 
developing new therapeutics for various neuroinflammatory diseases.

Despite recent approval of monoclonal antibodies that reduce amyloid (Aβ) 
accumulation, the development of disease-modifying strategies targeting the 
underlying mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is urgently needed. We 
demonstrate that mitochondrial complex I (mtCI) represents a druggable target, 
where its weak inhibition activates neuroprotective signaling, benefiting AD 
mouse models with Aβ and p-Tau pathologies. Rational design and 
structure-activity relationship studies yielded novel mtCI inhibitors profiled 
in a drug discovery funnel designed to address their safety, selectivity, and 
efficacy. The new lead compound C458 is highly protective against Aβ toxicity, 
has favorable pharmacokinetics, and has minimal off-target effects. C458 
exhibited excellent brain penetrance, activating neuroprotective pathways with a 
single dose. Preclinical studies in APP/PS1 mice were conducted via functional 
tests, metabolic assessment, in vivo 31P-NMR spectroscopy, blood cytokine 
panels, ex vivo electrophysiology, and Western blotting. Chronic oral 
administration improved long-term potentiation, reduced oxidative stress and 
inflammation, and enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis, antioxidant signaling, and 
cellular energetics. These studies provide further evidence that the restoration 
of mitochondrial function and brain energetics in response to mild energetic 
stress represents a promising disease-modifying strategy for AD.

Tau is a primary target for immunotherapy in Alzheimer's disease. Recent studies 
have shown the potential of anti-tau fragment antibodies in lowering 
pathological tau levels in vitro and in vivo. Here, we compared the effects of 
single-chain variable fragments (scFv) derived from the well-characterized 
monoclonal antibodies PHF1 and MC1. We used adeno-associated virus 1 (AAV1) to 
deliver scFvs to skeletal muscle cells in eight-week-old P301S tau transgenic 
mice. We evaluated motor and behavioral functions at 16 and 23 weeks of age and 
measured misfolded, soluble, oligomeric and insoluble brain tau species. 
Monotherapy with scFv-MC1 improved motor and behavioral functions more 
effectively than scFv-PHF1 or combination therapy. Brain glucose metabolism also 
benefited from scFv-MC1 treatment. Surprisingly, combining scFvs targeting early 
(MC1) and late (PHF1) tau modifications did not produce additive or synergistic 
effects. These results confirm that intramuscular AAV1-mediated scFv-MC1 gene 
therapy holds promise as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease. Our 
findings also suggest that combining scFvs targeting different tau epitopes may 
not necessarily enhance efficacy if administered together in a prevention 
paradigm. Further research is needed to explore whether other antibodies' 
combinations and/or administration schedules could improve the efficacy of 
scFv-MC1 alone.

Hospital of Huzhou University, Huzhou, Zhejiang, People's Republic of China.

BACKGROUND: Psychiatric inpatients face an increased risk of deep vein 
thrombosis (DVT) due to their psychiatric conditions and pharmacological 
treatments. However, research focusing on this population remains limited.
METHODS: This study analyzed 17,434 psychiatric inpatients at Huzhou Third 
Municipal Hospital, incorporating data on demographics, psychiatric diagnoses, 
physical illnesses, laboratory results, and medication use. Predictive models 
for DVT were developed using logistic regression, random forest, support vector 
machine (SVM), and XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting). Feature importance was 
assessed using the random forest model.
RESULTS: The DVT incidence among psychiatric inpatients was 1.6%. Predictive 
model performance, measured by the area under the curve (AUC), showed logistic 
regression (0.900), random forest (0.885), SVM (0.890), and XGBoost (0.889) 
performed well. Logistic regression and random forest models exhibited optimal 
overall performance, while XGBoost excelled in recall. Significant predictors of 
DVT included elevated D-dimer levels, age, Alzheimer's disease, and Madopar use.
CONCLUSION: Psychiatric inpatients require vigilance for DVT risk, with factors 
like D-dimer levels and age serving as critical indicators. Machine learning 
models effectively predict DVT risk, enabling early detection and personalized 
prevention strategies in clinical practice.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) stands as one of the most outstanding progressive 
neurodegenerative disorders. Obviously, acetylcholine esterase (AChE) is the 
primary enzyme responsible for breaking down acetylcholine (ACh) with a much 
more prominent effect than butyrylcholine esterase (BuChE). Hence, novel 
quinazoline derivatives (3a-p) were designed and synthesized as AChE inhibitors 
for AD treatment. The newly synthesized quinazoline derivatives (3a-p) were 
pursued for their inhibitory potential towards both AChE and BuChE. Notably, 
compound 3e displayed the highest inhibitory potential towards AChE (IC50 = 9.26 
nM) surpassing donepezil (IC50 = 16.43 nM). On the other side, compound 3e 
effectively negated the decline in memory acquisition and retention instigated 
by ICV administration of streptozotocin (STZ) in mice, an effect that was 
comparable to that produced by donepezil. Moreover, compound 3e, reduced BACE1 
by 51.08% (p < 0.0001), Aβ42 by 52.47% (p < 0.0001), and p(Ser199)-tau by 69.16% 
(p < 0.0001) compared to STZ mice. Such effects were similar to those of 
donepezil which reduced all 3 parameters by 57.53%, 58.5%, and 66.78%, 
respectively, compared to STZ mice. Furthermore, molecular docking studies 
showed that the superimposition view clarified the similar binding mode of both 
3e and the co-crystallized donepezil at the AChE binding pocket. Moreover, the 
docked complexes (3e-AChE and 3e-BuChE) were further subject to molecular 
dynamics simulations for 100 ns. In addition, eligible pharmacokinetic profiles 
as well as feasible BBB penetration were anticipated for compound 3e using ADME 
and BBB permeation prediction studies. Accordingly, the synthesized compounds, 
in particular compound 3e, can be treated as promising lead compounds for AD 
treatment with future further optimization.

Despite broad spectrum utility of Nardostachys jatamansi (D. Don) DC, little is 
known about the molecular processes that underlie its anti-Alzheimer action. To 
investigate the molecular targets and therapeutic potential of N. jatamansi for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), we used Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS), 
ADMET analysis, network pharmacology, differential gene expression analysis, 
molecular docking, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The STITCH database 
was used for network creation and protein-protein interaction analysis, while 
Cytoscape was used for network visualization and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and 
Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment and Gene Ontology (GO) for term enrichment. 
Additionally, to investigate the intermolecular interactions between the active 
chemicals and target proteins, molecular docking experiments were conducted 
using the Blind docking on the Achilles server. The stability of the PS1 gene 
complex with Spirojatamol, was further evaluated using MD simulations. With 
Spirojatamol showing the highest binding energy scores against PS1 (-6.9 
kcal/mol), molecular docking confirmed the activity of this metabolite against 
AD targets PS1 and Spirojatamol formed a stable complex at 100 nanoseconds, 
according to additional investigation using MD simulations. Significant 
ligand-protein interactions were verified by binding free energy calculations 
using the MM/GBSA technique. The PS1-Spirojatamol complex had a binding energy 
of ΔG: -36.95 ± 5.00 kcal/mol. By focusing on several genes and pathways, 
involved in AD, this work reveals the molecular underpinnings behind N. 
jatamansi possible use in the treatment of AD.

BACKGROUND: Data about the utility of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) as a 
potential therapy for neurodegenerative disorders are still inconclusive. We 
used a rat model of acrolein-induced hippocampal neurodegeneration to 
investigate the effect of VNS on spatial learning and memory.
METHODS: A total of 24 Wistar rats were randomly allocated to one of the four 
groups: no acrolein exposure (n = 6), control (n = 6), sham (n = 6), and 
experimental (n = 6). The control, sham, and experimental groups were exposed to 
acrolein 2.5 mg/kg/day by gastric gavage for eight weeks. After acrolein 
exposure, the experimental and sham groups received transcutaneous auricular VNS 
and greater auricular nerve stimulation, respectively, under 2% isoflurane 
anesthesia for four weeks. Then, all animal groups were assessed for spatial 
learning and memory in a Morris water maze before being euthanized for 
hippocampus histological examination.
RESULTS:  The mean time to find the hidden platform varied significantly between 
the no acrolein exposure group and each of the acrolein-exposed groups. The 
results of one-way ANOVA indicated a significant difference in the average 
swimming time between the four study groups (F = 14.64, p < 0.001). Results from 
the post-hoc analysis indicated that the mean difference was statistically 
significant between the "no acrolein exposure" and "control" groups (p < 0.001), 
the "no acrolein exposure" and "experimental" groups (p = 0.001), and between 
the "control" and "sham" groups (p< 0.001). There was no statistically 
significant difference in swimming time to find the hidden escape platform 
between the sham and experimental groups (p = 0.060).
CONCLUSION: Transcutaneous auricular VNS has no significant effect on spatial 
learning or memory in Wistar rats with acrolein-induced hippocampus neuronal 
damage, indicating the need to review the long-standing notion that hippocampal 
neuronal loss causes spatial navigation deficits.

BACKGROUND: The mechanisms underlying the protective effect of the e2 variant of 
the APOE gene (APOEe2) against Alzheimer's disease (AD) have not been 
elucidated. We altered the microbiota of 3xTgAD mice by fecal microbiota 
transplantation from a human APOEe2 donor (e2-FMT) and tested the effect of 
microbiota perturbations on brain AD pathology.
METHODS: FMT of bacteria isolated from stools of untreated 3xTgAD mice (M-FMT) 
or e2-FMT were transplanted in 15-month-old 3xTgAD mice. FMT was done alone or 
in combination with antibiotic and proton-pump inhibitor following the 
Microbiota Transfer Therapy protocol (MTT). The effect of donor (M or e2) and 
transplantation protocol (FMT or MTT) on hippocampal amyloid, tau pathology and 
neuroinflammation were assessed at the end of the treatment.
RESULTS: e2-FMT reduced amyloid, and tau pathology as well as increased 
neuroinflammation as compared with M-FMT. MTT was associated with reduced number 
of Aβ40+ plaques and tau pathology. Low levels of amyloid were associated with 
high levels of pro-inflammatory molecules in e2-FMT mice. These associations 
were partially attenuated by MTT.
CONCLUSION: Bacteria from a human APOEe2 donor reduced AD pathology and 
increased neuroinflammation in mice suggesting that the gut microbiota may be a 
mediator of the protective effect of APOEe2.

Background: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) represents a transitional stage 
between normal aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD), with a significantly elevated 
risk of progressing to AD. In recent years, accumulating evidence has indicated 
that exercise interventions may mitigate cognitive decline in individuals with 
MCI and reduce the risk of conversion to AD, potentially through mechanisms such 
as enhancing cerebral blood flow and promoting neuroplasticity. Objective: To 
explore which type of exercise is most effective in improving global cognition 
in older adults with MCI and to investigate whether exercise can enhance their 
balance abilities. Methods: Randomized controlled trials were retrieved from 
four databases. Stata software was used for Network Meta-Analysis and 
traditional meta-analysis. Results: A total of 33 studies were included, of 
which 28 were used to determine the best exercise modality. The results 
indicated that multicomponent exercise (SUCRA = 76.5%) and moderate-intensity 
aerobic exercise (SUCRA = 73.6%) are two effective modalities. The results of 
the traditional meta-analysis showed that exercise combined with cognitive 
training, moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, resistance exercise, and 
land-based kayaking training can improve balance ability. Conclusions: 
Multicomponent exercise may be the optimal exercise modality for enhancing 
global cognition in older adults with MCI, and various exercise modalities can 
improve balance abilities. However, more studies with larger sample sizes and 
higher quality are needed to provide further evidence.

Geroscience aims to understand how the biology of aging serves as a shared 
contributor to multiple age-related health conditions. Genetic variants that 
influence multiple traits are said to exert pleiotropic effects. The study by 
Pan and colleagues applied a modern statistical model to identify genetic 
variants with potentially pleiotropic effects by assessing their joint 
association with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias and another 
age-related comorbidity (e.g., coronary heart disease, hyperlipidemia, cancer). 
Motivated by Pan and colleagues, this commentary introduces the concept of 
genetic geroscience as a paradigm for identifying genetic variants with 
potentially pleotropic effects on multiple age-related health conditions.

BACE-1 is an encouraging target for the development of AD therapeutics. However, 
many BACE-1 inhibitors failed clinical trials due to their non-selectivity 
towards BACE-2 or adverse effects. Herein, a set of 96 benzothiazoles were 
designed based on the structural features of Atabecestat and Riluzole to find a 
promising selective BACE-1 inhibitor. Out of the 96 designed compounds, compound 
72 showed comparable binding affinity with BACE-1 as compared to Atabecestat, 
and more selective towards BACE-1 as compared to BACE-2. The BACE-1 docking 
score of Atabecestat and compound 72 were found to be -7.76 and -7.49, 
respectively, while their corresponding MM-GBSA ΔGbind energy were -70.39 and 
-68.97 kcal/mol. In contrast, the BACE-2 docking score of Atabecestat and 
compound 72 were found to be -6.24 and -5.32, respectively, while their 
corresponding MM-GBSA ΔGbind energy were -56.02 and -43.46 kcal/mol. The strong 
binding affinity of compound 72 was further validated by 100 ns dynamics study. 
The physicochemical and pharmacokinetic (ADME) profile of compound 72 predicted 
it as an excellent orally bioavailable brain-penetrant molecule. To confirm 
these results, compound 72 was synthesized and spectrally characterized. The 
selectivity and inhibitory potential (IC50) of compound 72 was estimated by in 
vitro BACE-1 and BACE-2 FRET assay. Compound 72 was found to inhibit BACE-1 with 
IC50 121.65 nM, while it was found to be less potent on BACE-2 (IC50 480.92 nM), 
as compared to Atabecestat (BACE-1, IC50 13.25 nM and BACE-2, IC50 7.15 nM).

Plain Language Summary: The structure of Atabecestat and Riluzole was used to 
design benzothiazole derivatives.Compound 72 showed good binding affinity and 
selectivity for BACE-1 as compared to BACE-2.The affinity of compound 72 was 
further confirmed by a 100 ns MD simulation study.Compound 72 was predicted to 
be orally bioavailable and brain-penetrant.Compound 72 was found more selective 
BACE-1 inhibitor (IC50 121.65 nM), as compared to BACE-2 (IC50 480.92 nM).

BackgroundThe rising number of older people, including those living with 
Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) 
highlights the need for an improved clinical diagnosis and management of the 
diseases.ObjectiveTo understand and describe healthcare providers' perceptions 
and practices regarding AD/ADRD diagnosis and care in Kenya, not previously 
reported.MethodsThis was an ethnographic study involving observations and 
semi-structured interviews with healthcare providers working at the Aga Khan 
University Hospital, Nairobi (AKUHN) Kenya. Twenty-one healthcare providers were 
purposively recruited and interviewed in English, with the data transcribed 
verbatim and thematically analysed using Nvivo version 14.ResultsOur findings 
reveal that AKUHN's dementia diagnostic pathway aligns with universal best 
practice models and involves multidisciplinary care. Yet, healthcare providers 
noted that this level of care is not representative of most public hospitals in 
Kenya, where a lack of diagnostic equipment and trained staff severely limits 
patient access to timely dementia care. In addition, new medications that can 
slow AD/ADRD progression, are not readily available in Africa, including Kenya. 
We also identified barriers to timely diagnosis and care such as: lack of 
dementia policy and guidelines, limited expertise of healthcare providers, high 
cost of care, and sociocultural factors, including stigma.ConclusionsWe 
emphasize the need for the Kenyan government and relevant stakeholders to 
develop social and healthcare policies and allocate resources to raise awareness 
about dementia and combat stigma; train healthcare providers; improve early 
detection and service delivery through access to diagnostic tools, and establish 
clear guidelines/protocols for AD/ADRD care.

With the increasing incidence of dementia in Japan due to an aging population 
and declining birthrate, supporting family caregivers is crucial. A survey was 
conducted at the hospital of the University of Occupational and Environmental 
Health, Japan from October 1, 2021, to February 29, 2024, involving dementia 
patients and their working caregiver relatives. The survey assessed health, 
living, work, caregiving status, sociodemographic factors, and the care 
recipient's condition. A total of 214 patient-caregiver pairs participated; 
consent was obtained from 212 pairs, and data were collected from 166 
caregivers. The caregivers were predominantly women, with 54 (33%) male 
caregivers and a mean age of 54.7 years. Health status was reported as good 
(33%) or fair (50%); however, 46% experienced sleep disturbances, 44% had 
psychological distress, 18% reported work dysfunction, and 8% noted poor social 
adjustment. Most of the care recipients were women (65%), with a mean age of 
79.8 years. The most common diagnoses were mild cognitive impairment (37%) and 
Alzheimer's disease (35%), with an average mini-mental state examination score 
of 21.6. This study outlines the survey protocol, focusing on the health, work, 
and caregiving conditions of working relatives caring for dementia patients.

As I recently retired from Chiba University, I would like to describe how I 
began my research career, some of my accomplishments in the research field of 
modeling and simulation, and future prospects in this area. Here, I discuss the 
research topics of drug interactions, the oral absorption of drugs, analyses of 
between-group and individual differences in pharmacokinetics based on the 
theories of physiologically-based pharmacokinetics and population 
pharmacokinetics, and my roles in implementation of the drug interaction 
guideline. Furthermore, I also discuss modeling topics unrelated to 
pharmacokinetics, i.e., the analyses of the long-term progression of chronic 
diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease using individual patient information; the spread 
of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic; and prognostic factors of 
chronic heart failure with the view towards personalized medicine. After 
completing my Master's course at Hokkaido University, I joined a pharmaceutical 
company and worked as a pharmacokinetics researcher for 21 years, while 
obtaining my doctoral degree. I spent the next 9 years as a hospital pharmacist 
focusing on scientific research at the University of Tokyo Hospital, and the 
last 10 years as a Professor of Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacometrics at 
Chiba University. My career is, therefore, characterized by involvement in 
pharmaceutical sciences from many different perspectives. This description 
focuses rather on the background of the studies than scientific details.

[Modulation of Cognitive and Psychiatric Functions by Psychostimulant-responsive 
Molecules].

[Article in Japanese]

Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama.

Methamphetamine, a psychostimulant drug, acts on dopaminergic neuron terminals 
projecting from the ventral tegmental area to the nucleus accumbens, which 
constitutes the reward system in the brain. In addition to dependence triggered 
by excessive excitation of the reward system, methamphetamine induces various 
effects, including hallucinations, delusions, and cognitive dysfunction. This 
means that molecules responsive to methamphetamine are importantly involved in 
the brain function. This report reviews the functions of Shati/Nat8l and 
Piccolo, identified as methamphetamine-responsive molecules in the murine 
nucleus accumbens, in cognitive and psychiatric functions clarified by rodent 
studies. Shati/Nat8l is related to drug addiction and depression and 
participates in the synaptic function of the hippocampus to maintain cognitive 
function. Its upregulation suppresses cognitive disturbance in Alzheimer's 
disease pathology. In the nucleus accumbens, Piccolo contributes to the 
behavioral alteration caused by methamphetamine. Piccolo downregulation in the 
prefrontal cortex induced schizophrenia-like behavioral and neuronal changes in 
mice. These findings indicate that Shati/Nat8l and Piccolo exert important 
functions on the brain and are potential targets for brain disorder studies. It 
is anticipated that understanding of brain function will be achieved through the 
analysis of methamphetamine-responsive molecules.

OBJECTIVES: Post-acute heart failure (HF) care presents significant management 
challenges, particularly among veterans with cognitive and behavioral 
impairments due to Alzheimer disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) or severe 
mental illness (SMI). We hypothesized that comorbid AD/ADRD and SMI would reduce 
the likelihood of discharge home following HF hospitalization. In addition, we 
explored how AD/ADRD and SMI influence discharge to Veterans Affairs (VA) 
Community Living Centers (CLCs) compared with Medicare Skilled Nursing 
Facilities (SNFs).
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study spanning January 1, 2011, to September 
30, 2019.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Veterans hospitalized with acute HF at VA hospitals 
(n = 291,117).
METHODS: We examined VA administrative data from HF hospitalizations to assess 
how AD/ADRD and SMI impact post-hospital discharge location. Using diagnostic 
codes from the prior year, we stratified participants by the presence of AD/ADRD 
and/or SMI, then employed logistic regression models to estimate the odds ratios 
(ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for discharge location, adjusted for 
demographics, comorbidities, and health care utilization.
RESULTS: Participants were predominantly older (mean age: 78.1 ± 11.1 years), 
male (97.5%), and self-identified as white (72.7%). Those with AD/ADRD alone 
(n = 16,212) or SMI alone (n = 33,194) outnumbered those with both conditions 
(n = 3612). Compared with neither condition, the presence of AD/ADRD alone 
[adjusted OR (aOR), 0.523; 95% CI, 0.505-0.542], SMI alone (aOR, 0.869; 95% CI, 
0.843-0.896), and both conditions (aOR, 0.505; 95% CI, 0.47-0.542) all reduced 
likelihood of discharge home. Participants with AD/ADRD and SMI were more likely 
to be discharged to a CLC than a SNF (aOR, 1.225; 95% CI, 1.064-1.411).
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Our findings indicate that AD/ADRD and SMI are 
major barriers to discharge home for patients with HF, suggesting a need for 
enhanced supervision during health care transitions. This study calls for 
further research into how discharge location affects short- and long-term 
clinical outcomes in patients with cognitive and behavioral impairment.

Nanoemulsions are nanostructured material and stabilized colloidal in nature 
evolved as a highly desirable mechanism for the delivery of drugs. Our objective 
of the study deals with a successful Rivastigmine (RSG) loaded nanoemulsion 
which can effectively progress the treatment of AD patients. We developed 
nanoemulsion containing RSG by combining pyridoxine, an essential vitamin 
supplement for central nervous system development, with linseed oil, which 
functioned as the lipophilic phase in the nanoemulsion formulation. The optimal 
formulation having globular size of 202.3 nm was further evaluated by various 
analytical techniques, including zeta potential analysis, ATR, DSC, and XRD 
study. The study utilized the Morris Water Maze (MWM) model to assess the 
cognitive abilities of Long-Evans rats. The current investigation establishes 
that the utilization of RSG nanoemulsion incorporating blend of linseed oil and 
pyridoxine which reduced travel distance in animal mode and can be successfully 
contribute to therapeutic advancements in patients with AD.

Berberine hydrochloride (Ber), a bioactive compound widely found in the roots, 
rhizomes, stems and barks of Coptis chinensis, has demonstrated efficacy in 
treating many diseases, such as cancer, congestive heart failure, Alzheimer's 
disease, especially inflammatory caused by bacteria. The molecularly imprinted 
microspheres based on chitosan were fabricated to adsorb selectively, release 
and anti-bacteria of Ber. The Ber surface molecularly imprinted microspheres 
(Ber-PSSS@GCS-MIPs) were synthesized using crosslinked chitosan as matrix, Ber 
as template, and sodium 4-styrene sulfonate (SSS) as functional monomer via a 
redox surface-initiating system -NH2/-S2O82-. The microspheres were 
characterized by fourier transform infrared reflection (FTIR), scanning electron 
microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Adsorption 
kinetics, isotherms and imprinting factor were investigated, and the drug 
release performance and antibacterial activity were evaluated. As a result, via 
electrostatic interaction and "lock-key" imprinted cavities, the adsorption 
capacity of Ber-PSSS@GCS-MIPs reaches 185 mg/g at 2 h, significantly higher than 
51 mg/g observed for non-imprinted microspheres. The adsorption of 
Ber-PSSS@GCS-MIPs. follows pseudo-second-order kinetics, with adsorption amount 
decreasing as temperature increases and salt concentration rises. 
Ber-PSSS@GCS-MIPs show excellent recognition and selectivity with an imprinting 
factor of 3.07, a selectivity factor exceeding to 2. The adsorption capacity 
remains at 82.4 % of three times cycles. The Ber-PSSS@GCS-MIPs loaded drug 
microspheres attain slow and sustained release for 70 % at 139 h. The relative 
antibacterial rate of Ber-PSSS@GCS-MIPs loaded Ber is higher than non-imprinted 
microsphere and control against S. aureus and E. coli.

Amyloid proteins have long been in the spotlight for being involved in many 
degenerative diseases including Alzheimer´s, Parkinson´s or type 2 diabetes, 
which currently cannot be prevented and for which there is no effective 
treatment or cure. Here we provide a comprehensive review of inhibitors that act 
directly on the amyloidogenic pathway (at the monomer, oligomer or fibril level) 
of key pathological amyloids, focusing on the most representative 
amyloid-related diseases. We discuss the latest advances in preclinical and 
clinical trials, focusing on cutting-edge developments, particularly on 
nanomaterials-based inhibitors, which offer unprecedented opportunities to 
address the complexity of protein misfolding disorders and are revolutionizing 
the landscape of anti-amyloid therapeutics. Notably, nanomaterials are impacting 
critical areas such as bioavailability, penetrability and functionality of 
compounds currently used in biomedicine, paving the way for more specific 
therapeutic solutions tailored to various amyloid-related diseases. Finally, we 
highlight the window of opportunity opened by comparative analysis with 
so-called functional amyloids for the development of innovative therapeutic 
approaches for these devastating diseases.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder characterized 
by cognitive decline due to the accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques, 
neurofibrillary tangles, and decreased acetylcholine levels caused by 
acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. Current treatments using synthetic 
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) provide only symptomatic relief and are 
associated with adverse effects, highlighting the need for safer and more 
effective alternatives. This study investigates the potential of 
phytoconstituents from the plant Senecio candicans as natural AChE inhibitors 
for AD treatment. Using structure-based virtual screening, molecular docking, 
and molecular dynamics simulations, we evaluated several compounds from Senecio 
candicans for their binding affinity, stability, and inhibitory activity against 
AChE. The findings identified compounds such as Estra-135(10)-trien-17β-ol and 
Vulgarone A, which demonstrated strong binding affinities and stable 
interactions with AChE, comparable to or surpassing the clinically used drug 
Donepezil. These phytoconstituents exhibited potential as effective AChEIs with 
potentially fewer side effects. The results underscore the therapeutic potential 
of plant-based molecules for drug discovery, offering a promising avenue for 
developing new treatments for neurodegenerative diseases. Combining 
phytochemical studies with computational methods provides a powerful approach to 
identifying novel therapeutic agents. This study suggests that phytoconstituents 
from Senecio candicans could serve as safer alternatives for managing AD. 
Further experimental validation and clinical studies are necessary to confirm 
these compounds' efficacy and safety, paving the way for innovative, 
plant-derived treatments for Alzheimer's disease.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
with limited treatment options. Emerging evidence suggests that antidiabetic 
agents may offer neuroprotective effects by targeting shared pathophysiological 
mechanisms such as insulin resistance and neuroinflammation. However, the 
comparative efficacy, and safety of these agents in the treatment of AD remain 
unclear.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to systematically evaluate and compare the efficacy 
and safety of antidiabetic agents for improving cognitive outcomes, reducing 
amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition, and managing adverse effects in patients with AD, 
using a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted across multiple 
databases to identify RCTs examining the effects of antidiabetic agents in 
patients with AD. The primary outcomes included cognitive performance (e.g., 
MMSE scores), Aβ deposition (measured via CSF biomarkers), and safety/adverse 
effects. A network meta-analysis was performed to integrate direct and indirect 
evidence, ranking interventions using Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking 
(SUCRA) probabilities. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias 
tool.
RESULTS: A total of 26 studies, involving 7,361 participants, were included in 
the analysis. The interventions evaluated included insulin detemir (both 
low-dose and high-dose), liraglutide, exenatide, metformin, and pioglitazone. 
Both low-dose insulin detemir (mean difference: 2.10, 95 % CI: 1.04 to 3.15), 
high-dose insulin detemir (mean difference: 1.40, 95 % CI: -0.07 to 2.88), 
exenatide (mean difference: 1.19, 95 % CI: 0.06 to 2.32), and metformin combined 
with exenatide (mean difference: 1.06, 95 % CI: -1.68 to 3.80) showed cognitive 
improvements compared to placebo. Among these, low-dose insulin detemir 
demonstrated the most significant improvement. In terms of reducing Aβ 
deposition, metformin ranked highest in effectiveness, with the highest SUCRA 
score (84.6), followed by high-dose insulin detemir (SUCRA: 54.1). Low-dose 
insulin detemir (SUCRA: 51.1) also demonstrated moderate efficacy. Low-dose 
insulin detemir showed some reduction in Aβ deposition (mean difference: -0.31, 
95 % CI: -2.82 to 2.20), although statistical significance was limited. 
Liraglutide exhibited the highest rate of study treatment withdrawal (mean 
difference: 1.97, 95 % CI: -0.07 to 4.00), while pioglitazone demonstrated the 
lowest withdrawal rates (mean difference: 0.07, 95 % CI: -0.03 to 0.17).
CONCLUSIONS: This network meta-analysis provides valuable insights into the 
comparative efficacy and safety of antidiabetic agents in AD. Low-dose insulin 
detemir demonstrated the most significant cognitive improvement and a moderate 
effect on reducing Aβ deposition. Metformin emerged as the most effective agent 
for reducing Aβ levels, though its effects on cognitive function were less 
pronounced. Safety profiles varied, with liraglutide associated with the highest 
rate of treatment withdrawals, while pioglitazone demonstrated the lowest 
incidence of treatment-related discontinuations. These findings support the 
potential use of antidiabetic agents, particularly insulin detemir, as a 
therapeutic option for AD, although further studies are needed to confirm their 
long-term benefits and safety.

Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a ubiquitously expressed serine/threonine 
phosphatase with a diverse and integral role in cellular signalling pathways. 
Consequently, its dysfunction is frequently observed in disease states such as 
cancer, inflammation and Alzheimer's disease. A growing understanding of both 
PP2A and its endogenous regulatory proteins has presented numerous targets for 
therapeutic intervention. This provides important context for the dynamic 
control and dysregulation of PP2A function in disease states. Understanding the 
intricate regulation of PP2A signalling in disease has resulted in the 
development of novel pharmacological agents aimed at restoring cellular 
homeostasis. Herein we review the structure and function of PP2A together with 
pharmacological modulators, both endogenous (proteins) and exogenous (small 
molecules and peptides), with relevance to targeting PP2A as a future 
pharmacotherapeutic strategy.

Early detection of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI), is essential to enable timely intervention and potential 
treatment. Accurate detection of AD/MCI is challenging due to the high 
complexity, cost, and often invasive nature of current diagnostic techniques, 
which limit their suitability for large-scale population screening. Given the 
shared embryological origins and physiological characteristics of the retina and 
brain, retinal imaging is emerging as a potentially rapid and cost-effective 
alternative for the identification of individuals with or at high risk of AD. In 
this paper, we present a novel PolarNet+ that uses retinal optical coherence 
tomography angiography (OCTA) to discriminate early-onset AD (EOAD) and MCI 
subjects from controls. Our method first maps OCTA images from Cartesian 
coordinates to polar coordinates, allowing approximate sub-region calculation to 
implement the clinician-friendly early treatment of diabetic retinopathy study 
(ETDRS) grid analysis. We then introduce a multi-view module to serialize and 
analyze the images along three dimensions for comprehensive, clinically useful 
information extraction. Finally, we abstract the sequence embedding into a 
graph, transforming the detection task into a general graph classification 
problem. A regional relationship module is applied after the multi-view module 
to explore the relationship between the sub-regions. Such regional relationship 
analyses validate known eye-brain links and reveal new discriminative patterns. 
The proposed model is trained, tested, and validated on four retinal OCTA 
datasets, including 1,671 participants with AD, MCI, and healthy controls. 
Experimental results demonstrate the performance of our model in detecting AD 
and MCI with an AUC of 88.69% and 88.02%, respectively. Our results provide 
evidence that retinal OCTA imaging, coupled with artificial intelligence, may 
serve as a rapid and non-invasive approach for large-scale screening of AD and 
MCI. The code is available at https://github.com/iMED-Lab/PolarNet-Plus-PyTorch, 
and the dataset is also available upon request.

Peanut skin proanthocyanidins (PSP) are natural polyphenols with antioxidant 
properties that mitigate Alzheimer's disease (AD), a complex progressive 
neurodegenerative disorder whose underlying biological mechanisms includes the 
aggregation of insoluble amyloid plaques. However, the high degree of 
polymerization of PSP, extracted using conventional methods, limits its 
bioavailability. This study established the optimal processes for 
ultrasound-assisted alkaline depolymerization to produce oligomeric 
proanthocyanidins (OPSP) from PSP content (2.7 mg/mL), depolymerization 
temperature (54.8 °C), ultrasonic power (480 W, 28 Hz), ultrasonic duration 
(28.7 min), and pH (12.1). Under these conditions, the degree of polymerization 
of the proanthocyanidins decreased from 6.74 to 2.87. Physicochemical 
characteristics of PSP and OPSP were analyzed. Both PSP and OPSP exhibited 
shared structural bonding and a repeating 288 Da unit, with Proanthocyanidin A 
identified as the predominant type. Furthermore, compared with PSP, OPSP 
demonstrated enhanced stability and antioxidant activity. Using in vitro 
detection of amyloid-beta (Aβ42) inhibition, this study demonstrated that OPSP 
exhibited greater inhibition of Aβ42 fibrillogenicity than underpolymerized PSP, 
and OPSP significantly inhibited Aβ42-induced cytotoxicity. In addition, the 
effect of OPSP was investigated in a rat model of Alzheimer's disease. The 
results indicated that OPSP improved the memory performance of AD rats in the 
water maze and decreased the levels of inflammatory factors IL-6, IL-1β, and 
TNF-α. Moreover, OPSP ameliorated histopathological changes and reduced Aβ42 
plaque deposition in the brains of AD rats. These findings regarding OPSP are 
anticipated to facilitate high-value utilization of peanut by-products, expand 
their applications, and provide guidance for the use of OPSP in the development 
of natural healthcare pharmaceuticals and mitigation and treatment of 
Alzheimer's disease.

BACKGROUND: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a critical gastrointestinal 
disease in preterm infants, for which no specific treatment is established. We 
previously demonstrated that thrombin-preconditioned mesenchymal stromal 
cell-derived extracellular vesicles (thMSC-EVs) enhance protection against other 
neonatal tissue injuries. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the 
therapeutic potential of thMSC-EVs in modified in vitro, in vivo, and organoid 
models of NEC.
METHODS: In vitro, the effects of thMSC-EVs and naïveMSC-EVs were compared in 
hyperosmotic, ischemic, and hypothermic (HIT)-stressed IEC-6 cells and 
LPS-treated peritoneal macrophages. In vivo, NEC was induced in P4 mouse pups by 
three cycles of formula feeding, oral LPS administration, hypoxia, and 
hypothermia, followed by overnight dam care. 2 × 109 thMSC-EVs were 
intraperitoneally administered daily for three days, and the therapeutic effects 
were assessed macroscopically, histologically, and biochemically. NEC 
mouse-derived organoids were established to evaluate the thMSC-EVs' effect in 
mature enterocytes. LC-MS/MS was performed to analyze the EV proteomics.
RESULTS: In vitro, compared with naïveMSC-EVs, thMSC-EVs significantly improved 
cellular viability in HIT-induced IEC-6 cells and reduced pro-inflammatory 
(IL-1α, IL-1β, TNF-α) but increased anti-inflammatory (TGF-b) cytokine levels in 
LPS-treated peritoneal macrophages. In vivo, thMSC-EVs significantly attenuated 
clinical symptoms, reduced intestinal damage, and retained intestinal stem cell 
markers, showing more significant localization in NEC-induced intestines than in 
healthy intestines. In NEC mouse-derived organoids, thMSC-EVs significantly 
increased OLFM4 and claudin-4 expression and reduced stress-related markers such 
as sucrase-isomaltase, defensin, and chromogranin A. Proteomic analysis revealed 
that thMSC-EVs were greater enriched in anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, cell 
adhesion, and Wnt signaling pathways than naïveMSC-EVs.
CONCLUSION: thMSC-EVs improved cellular viability, reduced apoptosis, attenuated 
inflammation, and upregulated key intestinal stem cell markers, collectively 
suggesting their tissue-protective effects and highlighting their potential as a 
treatment for NEC.

Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, 
characterized by gradual loss of neuronal structure and function, results in 
cognitive and motor impairments. These complex disorders involve multiple 
pathogenic mechanisms, including neurotransmitter imbalances, oxidative stress, 
and protein misfolding, necessitating multifunctional therapeutic approaches. 
Piperidine and isatin are valuable scaffolds in drug design due to their 
favorable pharmacokinetic profiles, ability to cross blood-brain barrier, and 
ease of modification. This study focuses on design, synthesis, and evaluation of 
benzylpiperidine-isatin hybrids as dual inhibitors targeting key enzymes 
implicated in NDDs: monoamine oxidases (MAO-A/B) and acetylcholinesterase 
(AChE). Strategic hybridization of piperidine and isatin produced novel 
benzylpiperidine-isatin hybrids, combining pharmacological benefits of both 
scaffolds. Synthesized hybrids were tested for MAO-A/B and AChE inhibitory 
effects. 15 emerged as a lead inhibitor for both MAO-A (IC50 = 0.108 ± 0.004 μM, 
competitive and reversible) and AChE (IC50 = 0.034 ± 0.002 μM, mixed and 
reversible), outperforming donepezil in AChE inhibition. 4 showed significant 
MAO-B inhibition (IC50 = 0.057 ± 0.001 μM, competitive and reversible). SAR 
studies identified crucial structural elements for potency and selectivity, 
while molecular docking revealed key interactions stabilizing the 
enzyme-inhibitor complexes. MD simulations of lead molecules demonstrate the 
ligand's suitability for strong and consistent binding to the respective 
proteins. Lead compounds were non-neurotoxic, exhibited good antioxidant 
properties, and had favorable in silico ADMET predictions. These findings 
suggest that benzylpiperidine-isatin hybrids hold promise as multifunctional 
agents against NDDs, warranting further refinement to enhance their efficacy and 
safety.

BACKGROUND: Older adults with Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRDs) 
are at high risk for medication-related problems. Comprehensive medication 
reviews (CMRs), required in Medicare Part D medication therapy management (MTM) 
programs, aim to optimize medication use and reduce adverse events. Individual 
factors related to MTM eligibility and CMR receipt among beneficiaries with ADRD 
are unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To examine MTM eligibility and CMR receipt among older adults with 
ADRD compared with those without.
METHODS: This retrospective, cross-sectional study included 2014 Health and 
Retirement Study participants aged at least 65 years, with continuous Medicare 
fee-for-service and Part D coverage. Outcomes were MTM eligibility and CMR 
receipt in 2014 or 2015. Our primary independent variable was presence of 
diagnosed ADRD. Covariates included sociodemographic characteristics, health 
conditions, and functional limitations. Weighted descriptive and bivariate 
statistics and multivariable logistic regression were used.
RESULTS: We included 14,778,506 older adults and 10.1% had ADRD. Those with ADRD 
were older (mean age [SE] = 83 [0.6] vs 75 [0.2] years; P < 0.001), had a higher 
proportion of Black (11.6% vs 6.3%) and Hispanic (5.7% vs 4.7%) race and 
ethnicity (P = 0.008), and had higher MTM eligibility (25.3% vs 14.8%; 
P < 0.001) compared with those without ADRD. Older adults with ADRD were more 
likely to be eligible for MTM (odds ratio [OR] = 1.95, 95% CI = 1.41-2.70) but 
not after adjusting for covariates (adjusted OR = 1.41, 95% CI = 0.88-2.27). 
Overall, 16.9% received a CMR. CMR receipt was lower in those with ADRD compared 
with those without (10.4% vs 18.2%), but not significantly different 
(P  = 0.12). ADRD status was not associated with CMR receipt (OR = 0.52, 95% 
CI = 0.23-1.21, adjusted OR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.25-2.29).
CONCLUSIONS: Older adults with ADRD were not more likely to be MTM eligible or 
receive a CMR compared with those without ADRD. Strategies to improve MTM 
program design are needed to increase CMR receipt among older adults with ADRD.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves alterations in synaptic vesicle 
cycling (SVC), which significantly affect neuronal communication and function. 
Therefore, a thorough investigation into the potential roles of SVC-related 
genes (SVCRGs) in AD can enhance the identification of critical biomarkers that 
may influence disease progression and treatment responses.
METHODS: The datasets used in this study were sourced exclusively from public 
databases. By integrating differential expression analysis with Mendelian 
randomization (MR), we identified SVCRGs as biomarkers for AD. Functional 
characterization of these biomarkers was performed, followed by integration into 
a nomogram. Further investigation of immune infiltration in AD patients and 
healthy individuals was carried out. Ultimately, the potential cellular 
mechanisms of AD were explored through single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) 
analysis.
RESULTS: ATP6V1D, ATP6V1G2, CLTB, and NSF were identified as biomarkers, 
exhibiting a positive correlation with each other and a downregulated expression 
in AD. These markers were pinpointed as protective factors for AD [odds ratio 
(OR) < 1, P < 0.05], with potential to reduce the risk of the disease. 
Integrated into a nomogram, they demonstrated satisfactory diagnostic 
performance and clinical utility, surpassing the use of single gene. They were 
collectively enriched in pathways related to "interferon gamma response", 
"inflammatory response", and "TNFα signaling via NFκB". Additionally, an 
increase in infiltration of 17 immune cell types in AD was noted, particularly 
cells associated with neuroinflammation such as activated CD8 T cells and 
various dendritic cells (DCs), suggesting an inflammatory milieu in AD while 
also displaying a negative correlation with the biomarkers. The cell types were 
further annotated, revealing specific expressions of biomarkers and uncovering 
the heterogeneity of excitatory neurons. A significant reduction in the overall 
number of excitatory neurons under AD conditions was observed, alongside 
consistent expression of biomarkers during the developmental stages of 
excitatory neurons.
CONCLUSION: By using MR, we firstly identified four SVCRGs as protective factors 
for AD, functioning through pathways associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, 
chronic inflammation, immune dysregulation, and neuronal damage. These genes had 
the potential to modulate immune cell infiltration activated in AD patients and 
exhibited cell-type-specific expression profiles within AD-related cellular 
contexts. Their findings provide novel insights and valuable references for 
future research on AD pathogenesis and therapeutic strategies.

Oxidative stress is widely recognized as a key contributor to the pathogenesis 
of Alzheimer's disease (AD). While not the sole factor, it is closely linked to 
critical pathological features, such as the formation of senile plaques and 
neurofibrillary tangles. The development of agents with antioxidant properties 
has become an area of growing interest in AD research. Between 2015 and 2024, 
several antioxidant-targeted drugs for AD progressed to clinical trials, with 
increasing attention to the evaluation of antioxidant properties during their 
development. Oxidative stress plays a pivotal role in linking various AD 
hypotheses, underscoring its importance in understanding the disease mechanisms. 
Despite this, comprehensive reviews addressing advancements in AD drug 
development from the perspective of antioxidant capacity remain limited, 
hindering the design of novel compounds. This review aims to explore the 
mechanistic relationship between oxidative stress and AD, summarize methods for 
assessing antioxidant capacity, and provide an overview of antioxidant compounds 
with anti-AD properties reported over the past decade. The goal is to offer 
strategies for identifying effective antioxidant-based therapies for AD and to 
deepen our understanding of the role of oxidative stress in AD pathology.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a globally recognized neurodegenerative disorder 
that severely impairs cognitive function and imposes substantial psychological 
and financial burdens on patients and their families. The hallmark pathological 
features of AD include progressive neurodegeneration, extracellular beta-amyloid 
(Aβ) plaque accumulation, and intracellular hyperphosphorylated tau protein 
tangles. However, recent studies have identified a subset of patients exhibiting 
cognitive resilience, characterized by a slower cognitive decline or the 
preservation of high cognitive function despite the presence of AD pathology. 
Cognitive resilience is influenced by a complex interplay of genetic, 
environmental, and lifestyle factors. In addition, cognitive resilience 
contributes to the new perspectives on the diagnosis and personalized treatment 
of AD. This review aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of current studies 
on cognitive resilience in AD and to explore future research directions of AD 
diagnosis and treatment.

The brain-gut axis plays an important role in regulating cognitive ability in 
obesity-related Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we aimed to investigate 
the correlation between the barrier penetration ability of the DMY nanodelivery 
system in vivo and the regulation of the gut-brain axis to alleviate cognitive 
impairment. Brain-targeted peptide (TGN: TGNYKALHPHNG) and DMY loaded chitosan 
(CS)/sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP) nanoparticles (TGN-DMY-CS/TPP-NPs) and 
ovalbumin (OVA)/sodium carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) nanoparticles 
(TGN-DMY-OVA/CMC-NPs) were prepared. TGN-DMY-CS/TPP-NPs demonstrated superior 
mucus penetration and BBB targeting ability compared to TGN-DMY-OVA/CMC-NPs, 
while the latter showed notable intestinal accumulation. TGN-DMY-CS/TPP-NPs 
treatment significantly increased the relative abundance of Alistipes and 
Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group, and TGN-DMY-OVA/CMC-NPs treatment obviously 
enhanced the relative abundance of Lactobacillus. Furthermore, both 
nanoparticles alleviated lipid metabolism disorder, oxidative stress, and 
inflammation in the liver, reduced oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in the 
brain, inhibited neuronal apoptosis, and enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and 
synaptic plasticity in obesity-related AD mice. Despite different mucus 
penetration and biodistribution, their similar efficacy in improving 
obesity-related AD is attributed to the gut-brain bidirectional connection.

An imbalance in the brain microenvironment, involving oxidative stress and 
β-amyloid (Aβ) accumulation, is thought to be one of the primary characteristics 
of early Alzheimer's disease (AD). To address the intricate pathophysiology of 
AD, therapeutic approaches that can concurrently control several diseases in the 
AD microenvironment are desperately needed. This study created a guanidine salt 
ionic liquid functionalized carbon dots (CDs@TGM-IL) to mitigate Aβ 
aggregation-induced cytotoxicity and scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
simultaneously. In vitro studies have shown that CDs@TGM-IL can effectively 
inhibit Aβ42 protein aggregation, disaggregate mature Aβ42 fibrils, and 
effectively remove ROS. In vivo studies have found that CDs@TGM-IL can cross the 
blood-brain barrier (BBB) and improve cognitive performance in AD mice. Just as 
importantly, CDs@TGM-IL has been shown to have unparalleled biocompatibility. 
This means that CDs@TGM-IL is expected to be a possible treatment for AD.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The embryos of lotus (Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn.) 
is a famous traditional Chinese medicine used to treat insomnia, memory decline, 
and dementia for a long time. However, the underlying material basis and 
mechanisms of this medicine are still unclear. Isoliensinine (IL) is a major 
alkaloid derived from lotus embryos. Our previous research has demonstrated that 
IL can exert strong anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects in vitro.
AIM OF THE STUDY: To reveal the underlying therapeutic effect and mechanism of 
IL on Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like mice induced by AlCl3 and D-galactose 
(D-gal) in vivo.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The AD-like mice were modeled by intragastric injection 
(i.g.) of AlCl3 (20 mg/kg/day) and intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) of D-gal 
(120 mg/kg/day) for 8 weeks. Starting from the third week, AD-like mice were 
treated with IL (1, 3, or 10 mg/kg/day; i.p.) for 6 weeks. Cognitive impairment 
in AD-like mice was evaluated through some behavioral experiments including nest 
building, open field, novel object recognition, Y maze, and Morris water maze 
tests. The cortex and hippocampus (DG, CA1, and CA3) regions were analyzed as 
follows: Neuronal pathological changes and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) 
formation were observed by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and silver staining, 
respectively; The production of Aβ plaques and the activation of microglia and 
astrocytes were detected by immunohistochemistry; The levels of Ca2+ levels were 
determined by the ortho-cresolphtalein complexone method. The levels of 
inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β) were analyzed using the ELISA 
kits. The expression of CaM, p-CaMKII, Calpain, CDK5, p35/p25, p-Tau, ADAM10, 
BACE1, PSEN1, APP, Aβ1-42, p-IκBα, and IκBα were evaluated by western blotting.
RESULTS: IL (1, 3, and 10 mg/kg) treatment effectively ameliorated cognitive 
impairment in AD-like model mice. IL inhibited the decrease of brain index and 
body weight in AD-like mice and alleviated neuronal damage in the cortex and 
hippocampus (DG, CA1, and CA3). IL decreased the levels of Ca2+ and reduce high 
expression of CaM and Calpain in the cortex and hippocampus of AD-like mice. IL 
treatment did not affect the expression of CDK5 but inhibited the expression of 
p-CaMKII and p25/p35, and reduced Tau phosphorylation and NFTs formation. IL 
also down-regulated the high expression of Aβ1-42 and APP and regulated the 
expression of APP-cleavage secretase (reducing the expression of BACE1 and 
PSEN1, while increasing the expression of ADAM10), thereby inhibited the 
production of Aβ plaques in AD-like mouse brain. Moreover, IL inhibited the 
phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα, as well as the production of 
inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β), and prevented the activation of 
microglia and astrocytes in AD-like mice.
CONCLUSIONS: IL has a significant therapeutic effect on pathological alterations 
and cognitive impairment in AlCl3 and D-gal-induced AD-like mice, indicating 
that IL may have the potential to treat AD. The anti-AD activity of IL may be 
associated with its regulation of the Ca2+ homeostasis and downstream signaling 
molecules such as CaM and Calpain.

Oral infection with Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis), a kind of 
pathogenic bacteria causing periodontitis, can increase the risk of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) and cause cognitive decline. Therefore, precise intracerebral 
antimicrobial therapy to reduce the load of P. gingivalis in brain may serve as 
a potential therapeutic approach to improve AD-like cognitive impairment. A kind 
of nano-delivery system precisely targets bacteria in the brain through coating 
P. gingivalis stimulated macrophage membrane onto the surface of platinum 
nanoclusters (Pg-M-PtNCs). Approximate 50 nm spherical Pg-M-PtNCs demonstrate 
good biocompatibility and the pretreated macrophage membranes can inhibit 
macrophages phagocytosis and increase the adherence to bacteria. Pg-M-PtNCs can 
significantly inhibit the growth of P.gingivalis in vitro, and are effectively 
delivered and remain at the infection site in the mice brain to reduce the 
bacterial load and neuronal damage, and then improve the AD-like cognitive 
dysfunction in the chronic periodontitis mice. Platinum nanoclusters coated with 
P. gingivalis pretreated macrophage membrane play an important role in targeting 
bacteria in the brain, and effectively improve AD-like cognitive function 
disorder caused by P. gingivalis infection in the brain.

BACKGROUND: Paramagnetic rim lesions (PRLs), marked by chronic inflammation and 
iron-loaded microglia, are linked to severe disease progression in multiple 
sclerosis (MS). The impact of cladribine, an immune reconstitution therapy, on 
PRLs remains underexplored.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of cladribine tablets on PRLs in 
relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients and explore the association between PRLs 
dynamics and brain atrophy.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 52 RRMS patients treated with 
cladribine in Buenos Aires between 2018 and 2021. Brain MRIs were analyzed at 
baseline, 12, and 24 months post-treatment, focusing on PRLs count and brain 
volume measurements. Statistical analyses included Wilcoxon tests, Poisson mixed 
models, and linear mixed models.
RESULTS: The cohort included 52 patients (32 women) with a median age of 36 
years (range 21-66 years). PRLs were present in 61.5% of patients at baseline. 
Cladribine treatment significantly reduced PRLs count (IRR=0.68, 95% CI [0.49, 
0.95], p=0.02), independent of prior treatment or disease activity. While no 
significant relationship was found between PRLs changes and overall brain 
atrophy, a significant interaction between PRLs dynamics and atrophy in the 
right thalamus was observed (p<0.05).
CONCLUSION: Cladribine tablets are associated with a reduction in PRLs in RRMS 
patients, potentially influencing regional brain atrophy over time.

Knowledge of Alzheimer's disease (AD) among healthcare staff influences 
important aspects of care and is associated with better patient outcomes. This 
study aimed to assess the knowledge of AD among healthcare professionals working 
in government hospitals and healthcare centers in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. This 
cross-sectional study used an online questionnaire to assess Alzheimer's disease 
knowledge using the Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Scale (ADKS). Participants 
also self-rated their knowledge and reported their experience in dementia care 
and training. The study included 231 healthcare professionals, with 61.5% males 
and 38.5% females. Medical professionals demonstrated significantly higher mean 
ADKS score = 19.84 compared to pharmacy, nursing, and allied health 
professionals (P < .05). Other factors, such as gender, age, workplace setting, 
years of experience, and formal dementia training, showed no significant impact 
on ADKS scores (P > .05). However, participants with additional dementia-related 
learning experiences, such as workshops or self-directed study, had 
significantly higher scores (P < .05). A notable finding was the discrepancy 
between self-assessed and actual knowledge. Among those who rated themselves as 
"very knowledgeable," only 10% achieved a very good ADKS score, while more than 
half failed the test. Conversely, those who rated themselves as having poor 
knowledge often performed better than expected, with many achieving good or very 
good ADKS scores 44.3% and 13.1%, respectively. This study highlights 
significant disparities in Alzheimer's disease knowledge among healthcare 
professionals in Jeddah, with medical staff showing higher understanding. 
Tailored educational programs are needed to address these gaps and improve 
dementia care.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting 
millions worldwide. There is no known cure for AD, highlighting an urgent need 
for new, innovative treatments. Recent studies have shed light on a promising, 
noninvasive approach using sensory stimulation as a potential therapy for AD. 
Exposing patients to light and sound pulses at a frequency of 40 hertz induces 
brain rhythms in the gamma frequency range that are important for healthy brain 
activity. Using this treatment in animal models, we are now beginning to 
understand the molecular, cellular, and circuit-level changes that underlie 
improvements in disease pathology, cognition, and behavior. A mechanistic 
understanding of the basic biology that underlies the 40-hertz treatment will 
inform ongoing clinical trials that offer a promising avenue of treatment 
without the side effects and high costs typically associated with 
pharmacological interventions. Concurrent advancements in neurotechnology that 
can also noninvasively stimulate healthy brain rhythms are illuminating new 
possibilities for alternative therapies. Altogether, these noninvasive 
approaches could herald a new era in treating AD, making them a beacon of hope 
for patients, families, and caregivers facing the challenges of this 
debilitating condition.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent cause of dementia and a 
significant contributor to health issues and mortality among older individuals. 
This condition involves a progressive deterioration in cognitive function and 
the onset of dementia. Recent advancements suggest that the development of AD is 
more intricate than its underlying brain abnormalities alone. In addition, 
Alzheimer's disease, metabolic syndrome, and oxidative stress are all 
intricately linked to one another. Increased concentrations of circulating 
lipids and disturbances in glucose homeostasis contribute to the intensification 
of lipid oxidation, leading to a gradual depletion of the body's antioxidant 
defenses. This heightened oxidative metabolism adversely impacts cell integrity, 
resulting in neuronal damage. Pathways commonly acknowledged as contributors to 
AD pathogenesis include alterations in synaptic plasticity, disorganization of 
neurons, and cell death. Abnormal metabolism of some membrane proteins is 
thought to cause the creation of amyloid (Aβ) oligomers, which are extremely 
hazardous to neurotransmission pathways, especially those involving 
acetylcholine. The interaction between Aβ oligomers and these neurotransmitter 
systems is thought to induce cellular dysfunction, an imbalance in 
neurotransmitter signaling, and, ultimately, the manifestation of neurological 
symptoms. Antioxidants have a significant impact on human health since they may 
improve the aging process by combating free radicals. Neurodegenerative diseases 
are currently incurable; however, they may be effectively managed. An appealing 
alternative is the utilization of natural antioxidants, such as polyphenols, 
through diet or dietary supplements, which offer numerous advantages. Within 
this framework, we have extensively examined the importance of oxidative stress 
in the advancement of Alzheimer's disease, as well as the potential influence of 
antioxidants in mitigating its effects.

BACKGROUND: Several preclinical studies have reported elevated levels of tau 
following the induction of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) in Alzheimer's 
disease mouse models. The objective of this study was to first induce CCH in a 
mouse model of tauopathy over an extended period of up to 6 months and to 
subsequently investigate the effects of CCH on tau accumulation and alterations 
in the transcriptome.
METHODS: Three-month-old P301S tauopathy mice were randomly allocated to either 
a Sham or CCH group. The common carotid arteries (CCAs) of the CCH group were 
bilaterally implanted using 0.75-mm inner diameter ameroid constrictors. Prior 
to surgery, Doppler ultrasound imaging was acquired, with follow-up imaging at 
1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively. Brain tissue samples were obtained, and 
hemispheres were dissected and divided for separate analysis.
RESULT: No significant differences in phosphorylated and total tau protein 
levels were found in either Sham or CCH left cortical hemispheres or hippocampal 
lysates. Immunohistochemical staining of phosphorylated tau in the right 
hemisphere revealed similar findings. Compared with the Sham group, 
transcriptomic deconvolution revealed a significant reduction of memory B cells 
in the CCH group (p = 0.029).
CONCLUSION: To clarify the effects of chronic hypoperfusion on tau pathology, 
more than one surgical method of hypoperfusion should be used in future studies.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that significantly 
impairs memory, cognitive function, and the ability to perform daily tasks. The 
pathological features of AD include β-amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, 
and neuronal loss. Current AD treatments target pathological changes but often 
fail to noticeably slow disease progression and can cause severe complications, 
limiting their effectiveness. In addition to therapies targeting the core 
pathology of AD, a more comprehensive approach may be needed for its treatment. 
In recent years, non-pharmacological treatments such as physical therapy, 
exercise therapy, cell therapy, and nanoparticles have shown great potential in 
mitigating disease progression and alleviating clinical symptoms. This article 
reviews recent advances in non-pharmacological treatment approaches for AD, 
highlighting their contributions to AD management and facilitating the 
exploration of novel therapeutic strategies.

INTRODUCTION: Evidence suggests that oxidative stress plays a critical role in 
the pathogenesis and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Consequently, 
antioxidants may mitigate neurotoxicity induced by beta-amyloid (Aβ) and 
potentially reduce cell death. Previous research has demonstrated that 
olanzapine (OLZ) possesses antioxidant and neuroprotective properties. In this 
study, we investigated the protective and therapeutic effects of OLZ on an 
animal model of AD induced by Aβ using behavioral assessments.
METHODS: Rats were randomly assigned to one of five groups (n = 10 rats per 
group): a control group, a sham group that received an intracerebrovascular 
(ICV) injection of phosphate-buffered saline (the solvent for Aβ), an AD group 
that received an ICV injection of Aβ, an OLZ group that received OLZ via gavage 
for two months, and an AD + OLZ group that received OLZ for one month before and 
one month after AD induction.
RESULTS: We used the Elevated Plus Maze (EPM), Novel Object Recognition Test 
(NORT), Barnes Maze (BM), Passive Avoidance Test (PAT), and Morris Water Maze 
(MWM) to assess behavioral performance in the experimental rats. Aβ 
administration impaired cognition and increased anxiety-like behavior. Treatment 
with OLZ improved cognitive decline and reduced anxiety-like behavior in 
Aβ-infused rats.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that OLZ can restore cognitive performance and 
alleviate anxiety-like behavior following Aβ injection. Thus, OLZ may have both 
preventive and therapeutic potential for AD and could be considered a viable 
pharmacological option.

INTRODUCTION: Whether temporal proximity to parental onset of dementia (PPO) can 
be used to estimate timing of the preclinical stage of sporadic Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) remains uncertain.
METHODS: We investigated cross-sectionally adults aged > 50 without dementia 
included in the European Prevention of Alzheimer's Dementia (EPAD) study. PPO 
was tested as a predictor of quantitative levels of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
β-amyloid (1-42) (Aβ1-42) in those with a parental history of dementia (n = 688) 
and of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and EPAD neuropsychological examination (ENE) 
subscores in an amyloid positive subgroup (n = 226). Possible interactions were 
explored.
RESULTS: Shorter PPO predicted lower CSF Aβ1-42 level (β = 9.357; T = 4.161; 
p < 0.001), interacting with apolipoprotein E (APOE) -𝜀4 carriage in 
a dose-dependent manner. Concomitant APOE-𝜀2 carriage appeared to provide 
protection. PPO did not predict p-tau levels or cognitive performance.
DISCUSSION: PPO may provide a valid method of stratifying risk of early AD 
pathologic change in APOE-𝜀4 carriers, with empirical and clinical applications.
HIGHLIGHTS: Proximity to age of parental dementia onset can predict amyloid 
accrualThe effect is APOE-𝜀4 dose-dependent and APOE-𝜀2 appears to provide 
protectionPPO does not appear to predict further advancement along the AD 
continuumIn the era of anti-amyloid treatments, this may inform timing of 
amyloid screeningUsed as an empirical metric, PPO could help elucidate the 
natural history of LOAD.

INTRODUCTION: The brain age gap estimation (BrainAGE) method uses a machine 
learning model to generate an age estimate from structural magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) scans. The goal was to study the association of brain age with 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) imaging and plasma biomarkers.
METHODS: One hundred twenty-three individuals from the Indiana Memory and Aging 
Study underwent structural MRI, amyloid and tau positron emission tomography 
(PET), and plasma sampling. The MRI scans were processed using the software 
program BrainAgeR to receive a "brain age" estimate. Plasma biomarker 
concentrations were measured, and partial Pearson correlation models were used 
to evaluate their relationship with brain age gap (BAG) estimation 
(BrainAGE = chronological age - MRI estimated brain age).
RESULTS: Significant associations between BAG and amyloid and tau levels on PET 
and in plasma were observed depending on diagnostic categories.
DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that BAG is potentially a biomarker of 
pathology in AD which can be applied to routine brain imaging.
HIGHLIGHTS: Novel research that uses an artificial intelligence learning tool to 
estimate brain age.Findings suggest that brain age gap is associated with plasma 
and positron emission tomography Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
biomarkers.Differential relationships are seen in different stages of disease 
(preclinical vs. clinical).Results could play a role in early AD diagnosis and 
treatment.

Recent advances in digital technologies hold promise for supporting aging adults 
and their care partners as they navigate changes in cognitive and daily 
functioning associated with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). 
Commonly owned digital technologies, like smartphones, include features that 
could help maintain independence and reduce caregiver burden. However, we lack 
models for successful integration of technologies into treatment of persons with 
ADRD. We propose the Technology Assistance in Dementia (Tech-AiD) framework for 
aiding persons with ADRD and their care partners with using digital technologies 
to reach individualized goals. We discuss how technology use is impacted by a 
multitude of factors, including severity of cognitive impairment, technology 
proficiency, and barriers to adequate and equitable care, all of which are 
further complicated by health disparities. Further, we explore the potential 
benefits of technology use among patients with ADRD and their care partners, 
highlighting pertinent clinical and ethical challenges and drawing from 
evidence-based strategies to promote practical recommendations.

BACKGROUND: Asthma, a prevalent chronic respiratory condition, is hypothesized 
to influence cognitive health; however, the precise nature of this association 
remains unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to elucidate the 
prevalence and risk of cognitive impairment in individuals with asthma.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was performed in databases such as 
PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science, spanning publications up to December 25, 
2023. This search aimed to identify studies that assessed cognitive impairment 
in patients with asthma. We used the random effects model in the R v4.3 software 
for the meta-analysis to evaluate the prevalence and risk of cognitive decline, 
including dementia and Alzheimer's disease, among asthma patients. To ensure 
robustness and validity, the quality of the studies was assessed using 
Newcastle-Ottawa scale.
RESULTS: Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria, of these 10 were eligible 
for meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of cognitive impairment in patients 
with asthma was 16.3%. The analysis also revealed an increased hazard ratio of 
1.47 (95% confidence interval [1.09; 1.84]) for cognitive impairment in patients 
with asthma compared to the control group (individuals without asthma). 
Significant heterogeneity and publication bias were observed across the studies. 
The results underscored the substantial correlation between asthma and 
heightened risks of cognitive decline, dementia, and Alzheimer's disease.
CONCLUSION: This review found a notable association between asthma and an 
increased risk of cognitive decline, including dementia and Alzheimer's disease. 
These findings highlight the importance of integrating cognitive health 
assessments into asthma care. Further research is required to understand this 
relationship and develop effective treatments. Emphasizing a holistic approach 
to asthma management, these findings highlight the need to consider both 
respiratory and cognitive health for comprehensive patient care.

Background: Diabetes is a risk factor for dementia, but we do not know whether 
specific diabetes medications ameliorate this risk. Objective: To systematically 
review and meta-analyze such medication's effect on the risk of developing 
dementia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or cognitive decline. Methods: We 
searched three databases until 21 November 2023. We included randomized 
controlled trials (RCT), cohort, and case-control studies assessing association 
between antidiabetic medication and future dementia, MCI, or cognitive decline. 
We meta-analyzed studies separately for individual drug classes and their 
comparators (no medication, placebo, or another drug). We appraised study 
quality using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and Physiotherapy Evidence Database 
Scale. Results: 42 studies fulfilled inclusion criteria. Glucagon-like peptide-1 
receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) versus placebo reduced dementia risk by 53% in 
three RCTs (n = 15,820, RR = 0.47[0.25, 0.86]) and 27% in three case-control 
studies (n = 312,856, RR = 0.73[0.54, 0.99], I2 = 96%). Repaglinide was superior 
to glibenclamide by 0.8 points on the Mini-Mental State Examination scale in 
another RCT. Meta-analysis of seven longitudinal studies showed glitazones 
(n = 1,081,519, RR = 0.78[0.76, 0.81], I2 = 0%) were associated with reduced 
dementia risk. Metformin (n = 999,349, RR = 0.94[0.79, 1.13], I2 = 98.4%), 
sulfonylureas (RR = 0.98[0.78, 1.22], I2 = 83.3%), dipeptidyl peptidase-IV 
inhibitors (DPP-1V) (n = 192,802, RR = 0.86[0.65, 1.15], I2 = 92.9%) and insulin 
(n = 571,274, RR = 1.09[0.95, 1.25], I2 = 94.8%) were not. Most studies were 
observational and limited by confounding by indication. Conclusions: In people 
with diabetes, RCTs consistently showed GLP-RAs reduce future dementia risk. 
Glitazones consistently showed protective effects, without heterogeneity, 
suggesting potential generalizability of these results. Metformin, 
sulfonylureas, insulin, and DPP-1V studies had inconsistent findings. If 
information is available future studies should consider dosage, severity, and 
duration.

Brexpiprazole: A Balance of Risks and Benefits.

Spokane, Washington.

Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia. Behavioral and 
psychological symptoms in dementia (BPSD) are neuropsychiatric signs 
accompanying dementia that carry a significant impact on prognosis and 
management. Management of BPSD is challenging because of its complex and 
multifactorial nature. Historically, no medications were specifically approved 
for the treatment of BPSD, and any pharmacological use was considered off-label. 
In May 2023, brexpiprazole was the first and only atypical antipsychotic agent 
to receive US Food and Drug Administration approval for the treatment of 
agitation associated with dementia because of Alzheimer's disease. The purposes 
of this article are to discuss the clinical characteristics of brexpiprazole 
with a focus on safety and efficacy in older adults, to review the studies that 
led to the approval for agitation associated with dementia, and to examine its 
potential place in therapy and impact on patient care. Brexpiprazole is a 
second-generation antipsychotic with affinity for multiple monoaminergic 
receptors. Efficacy, safety, and tolerability of brexpiprazole for the treatment 
of agitation associated with dementia because of Alzheimer's disease was 
evaluated in two Phase III studies with results suggesting that brexpiprazole 
has potential to be a safe, effective, and well-tolerated treatment for this 
indication. Given the individualized and complicated nature of BPSD, 
brexpiprazole is another option in the treatment landscape that may improve 
symptoms of agitation but requires careful assessment to ensure benefits 
outweigh any risks.

BACKGROUND: Plasma phospho-tau biomarkers, such as p217+tau, excel at 
identifying Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology. However, their ability to 
substitute for tau PET to identify AD biological stage is unclear.
METHODS: Participants included 248 cognitively unimpaired (CU) and 227 
cognitively impaired (CI) individuals, with Janssen plasma p217+tau Simoa® 
assay, 18F-NAV4694 Aβ-PET (A) and 18F-MK6240 tau-PET (T) data. Biological PET 
stages were defined according to the Revised Criteria for Diagnosis and Staging 
of Alzheimer's Disease (2024): Initial (A + T-), Early (A + TMTL + ), 
Intermediate (A + TMOD + ), and Advanced (A + THIGH + ). The threshold for A+ 
was 25 Centiloid and for THIGH + , the 75th percentile SUVRtemporo-parietal in 
A + CI. Sixty percent were A + , 36% Intermediate/Advanced, and 9% Advanced. The 
performance of p217+tau in discriminating AD stages was assessed using Receiver 
Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis and logistic regression.
RESULTS: Plasma p217+tau concentrations increase across the AD biological PET 
stages, except between Initial and Early stages. Screening for all AD stages 
(vs. A-T-), combined Intermediate/Advanced stages, or Advanced stage yields AUC 
of 0.92, 0.92, and 0.91, respectively (CI only: AUC 0.93, 0.89, 0.83). Plasma 
p217+tau Youden threshold provides sensitivity of 0.77 [0.73-0.90], specificity 
0.91 [0.80-0.95], PPV 0.84 [0.71-0.89], and NPV 0.88 [0.85-0.93] for combined 
Intermediate/Advanced stages. For the Advanced stage alone, sensitivity is 0.89 
[0.79-0.97], specificity 0.82 [0.75-0.9], NPV 0.99 [0.98-1.0], but PPV is only 
0.33 [0.25-0.47].
CONCLUSIONS: In addition to accurately screening for A+ individuals, plasma 
p217+tau is useful for identifying a combined Intermediate/Advanced stage AD 
cohort or pre-screening to reduce the tau-PET required to identify Advanced 
stage AD individuals.

Plain Language Summary: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) can be classified into four 
biological stages: Initial, Early, Intermediate, and Advanced, typically 
determined using expensive brain scans. We aimed to investigate whether a 
cost-effective blood test could accurately predict these stages. Our findings 
show that changes in blood markers can reliably identify individuals in the 
Intermediate or Advanced stages but are less effective at distinguishing those 
in the Advanced stage. This suggests that the blood test could help identify 
individuals with Intermediate to Advanced AD and reduce the need for costly 
brain scans in some cases.

Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy holds promise in biomedical applications but 
faces challenges in efficient transfection without compromising cell viability. 
Here, we show a serum-tolerant MSC transfection nanotool, APOs@BP, composed of 
an apolipoprotein (APO) corona and a boronated polyethyleneimine (BP) core. The 
APOs corona's serum-protein resistance and cytomembrane affinity enable APOs@BP 
to achieve 10.4-fold higher transfection efficiency and improved 
cytocompatibility in serum-containing medium compared to high-molecular-weight 
polycationic transfectants. For MSC neural differentiation, miRNA-124 and 
all-trans retinoic acid derivative (atRAN) are further loaded into APOs@BP, 
forming a polymeric complex for sequential drug release triggered by lysosomal 
acid and cytosolic reactive oxygen species post-transplantation. Transcriptomic 
analysis confirms that this system enhances MSC neural differentiation through 
sequential activation of atRAN-induced differentiation potential and 
miRNA-124-directed neurogenesis via cGMP-PKG, MAPK, and PI3K-Akt pathways. 
Transplantation of engineered MSCs reconstructs neural circuits and alleviates 
cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease model mice. Collectively, this 
system provides a robust and convenient method for MSC-based regenerative 
medicine.

Within precision psychiatry, there is a growing interest in normative models 
given their ability to parse heterogeneity. While they are intuitive and 
informative, the technical expertise and resources required to develop normative 
models may not be accessible to most researchers. Here we present Neurofind, a 
new freely available tool that bridges this gap by wrapping sound and previously 
tested methods on data harmonisation and advanced normative models into a 
web-based platform that requires minimal input from the user. We explain how 
Neurofind was developed, how to use the Neurofind website in four simple steps ( 
www.neurofind.ai ), and provide exemplar applications. Neurofind takes as input 
structural MRI images and outputs two main metrics derived from independent 
normative models: (1) Outlier Index Score, a deviation score from the normative 
brain morphology, and (2) Brain Age, the predicted age based on an individual's 
brain morphometry. The tool was trained on 3362 images of healthy controls aged 
20-80 from publicly available datasets. The volume of 101 cortical and 
subcortical regions was extracted and modelled with an adversarial autoencoder 
for the Outlier index model and a support vector regression for the Brain age 
model. To illustrate potential applications, we applied Neurofind to 364 images 
from three independent datasets of patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease 
and schizophrenia. In Alzheimer's disease, 55.2% of patients had very extreme 
Outlier Index Scores, mostly driven by larger deviations in temporal-limbic 
structures and ventricles. Patients were also homogeneous in how they deviated 
from the norm. Conversely, only 30.1% of schizophrenia patients were extreme 
outliers, due to deviations in the hippocampus and pallidum, and patients tended 
to be more heterogeneous than controls. Both groups showed signs of accelerated 
brain ageing.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate Americans' willingness-to-pay (WTP) for universal access 
to a disease-modifying Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment with a discrete choice 
experiment in a nationally representative sample. As part of this experiment, we 
examined whether providing information about the higher disease burden among 
minorities and persons of lower socioeconomic status (SES) changes WTP.
METHODS: We conducted an information experiment using the nationally 
representative Understanding America Study (UAS) panel. Participants were 
provided with general information about AD and a hypothetical treatment that 
reduces disease progression by 30 %. Two-thirds of the sample were randomized to 
receive additional information about the higher prevalence of Alzheimer's among 
either lower SES groups or racial/ethnic minorities. We measured participants' 
WTP for making the treatment nationally available as a fixed annual fee and 
income-proportionate fee. Differences in WTP between those exposed to the 
additional information and those who were not provide the societal valuation of 
the equity-enhancing effects of the AD treatment.
RESULTS: Average valuations were $252, $260 and $247 per year, and 0.59 %, 0.59 
% and 0.61 % of earned income, for the control, race/ethnicity and SES frames, 
respectively-all statistically indistinguishable. These average results imply 
that Americans would be willing to pay $33.7 billion based on the fixed fee and 
$51.4 billion based on the income-related charge for universal access to an AD 
treatment annually, but their valuation does not further increase when informed 
about equity considerations.
CONCLUSIONS: While Americans value universal access to an AD treatment highly, 
health equity considerations did not significantly alter respondents' WTP.

BACKGROUND: Hearing loss poses a significant global public health concern 
associated with cognitive decline. Among the many risk factors associated with 
Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD), hearing loss is the most 
prevalent sensory impairment in older adults and has emerged as a significant, 
yet often overlooked, modifiable risk factor for dementia.
OBJECTIVES: To access 1) the association between diet and risk of hearing loss 
in older adults and 2) the modifying effect of diet on the impact of hearing 
loss on cognitive decline in an aging population.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study SETTING: The Chicago Health and Aging Project, 
a community-based cohort study PARTICIPANTS: A total of 5,145 older adults (62 % 
non-Hispanic Black, 63 % female).
MEASUREMENTS: Self-reported hearing ability was assessed during each cycle of 
data collection. Diet was assessed by a 144-item Food Frequency Questionnaire. 
Diet quality was evaluated using a 144-item Food Frequency Questionnaire, 
focusing on adherence to dietary patterns such as Dietary Approaches to Stop 
Hypertension (DASH), Mediterranean, and Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for 
Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND). Cognitive function assessment was conducted 
during the in-home visits at each cycle. Four cognitive tests, including the 
East Boston tests of immediate and delayed recall, the mini-mental State 
Examination, and the Symbol Digit Modalities test, were included. We used linear 
mixed effect models to examine 1) the association of hearing loss and cognitive 
decline and 2) the association of diet on cognitive decline through modifying 
risk hearing loss. Discrete-time survival analysis examined the association 
between dietary patterns and the time to hearing impairment.
RESULTS: Among 5,145 participants included in the analyses, 747 (14.5 %) 
reported hearing loss, including 207 Black adults and 199 White adults. Each 
unit increase in the DASH, MedDiet, and MIND scores was associated with 19 % (95 
% CI: 0.79, 0.94, P < 0.001), 11 % (95 % CI: 0.79, 1.00, P = 0.05), and 13 % (95 
% CI: 0.87, 0.99, P < 0.05) lower risk for hearing loss, respectively. High 
adherence to the Western diet was associated with an earlier onset of hearing 
loss up to 14 months (P < 0.05). Participants had an increased rate of cognitive 
decline after reporting hearing loss. During follow-up, participants in the 
highest tertile of the DASH diet score who reported hearing loss experienced a 
17 % faster cognitive decline (β = -0.07 ± 0.01) compared to those without 
hearing loss (β = -0.06 ± 0.003). However, this decline was significantly slower 
than that of participants observed in the lowest tertile of the DASH diet, who 
exhibited a 67 % faster cognitive decline (β = -0.10 ± 0.012, P = 0.05).
DISCUSSION: Healthy dietary patterns, particularly the DASH diet, was associated 
with a reduced risk of hearing loss and slower cognitive decline following 
hearing loss. Clinically, these findings underscore the importance of dietary 
quality in preserving cognitive health by potentially mitigating risk of hearing 
loss or delaying the onset of hearing loss in older adults.

Most studies of nonpharmacological interventions have used a combination of 
medications in experimental and control groups to improve cognitive functioning 
or to control symptoms, but the results have been inconsistent with respect to 
the effects of single nonpharmacological interventions on cognitive functioning 
in older patients with Alzheimer's disease. The aim of this study was to assess 
the effect of a single nonpharmacological intervention on cognitive functioning 
in older adults with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. We conducted a 
systematic review and meta-analysis in the first week of January 2024, searching 
eight electronic databases for articles that reflect on non-pharmacological 
interventions in Alzheimer's disease published between January 1, 1986, and 
December 31, 2023. All included articles had to be randomized controlled trials. 
The primary measure was the change in cognitive function before and after the 
intervention. Data were extracted by two authors and quality was assessed using 
the Cochrane Handbook. With the exception of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment 
(MoCA) scale [MD=2.99, 95% CI (-0.66,6.63)], the differences between the 
intervention group and the control group were significant for all the remaining 
scales, namely, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) [SMD=0.65, 95% CI 
(0.15,1.15)], Activity of Daily Living Scale (ADL) [MD=-2.30, 95% CI 
(-3.63,0.97)], Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease Scale (QoL-AD) [MD=5.03, 
95% CI (2.27,7.78)], Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) [MD=-2.16, 95% CI 
(-3.86,0.46)], and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive score 
(ADAS-cog) [MD=-5.21, 95% CI (-7.89,2.54)]. Subgroup analysis revealed that the 
most effective intervention was exercise therapy, followed by repetitive 
transcranial magnetic stimulation. On the other hand, music therapy was not 
found to be effective. Current evidence suggests that nonpharmacological 
interventions can be used to improve cognitive functioning in older adults with 
mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. This study was registered in PROSPERO 
(registration number: CRD42024497247).

BACKGROUND: Physical inactivity is one of the most important modifiable risk 
factors for Alzheimer's disease in North America. Despite this, most older 
adults are physically inactive. It is currently unknown how to successfully 
motivate physical activity behavior in older adults at risk for Alzheimer's 
disease, and this knowledge is crucial for early and effective disease 
prevention. Prior research has shown that intergenerational social engagement 
and prosocial behaviours can enhance the health and well-being of older adults.
OBJECTIVES: This manuscript describes the design of a randomized controlled 
trial that will test the efficacy of a behavioral intervention to enhance 
physical activity in older adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease.
DESIGN/SETTING: This is a single-blinded, two-arm stratified randomized 
controlled trial that incorporates a hybrid efficacy and implementation design. 
Participants are randomized to an intervention or control condition in a 1:1 
ratio and are stratified by a multimodal Alzheimer's disease risk score. All 
study visits are conducted remotely through videoconferencing.
PARTICIPANTS: The study aims to recruit 60 older adults with a first-degree 
family history of Alzheimer's disease from the PREVENT-AD cohort and 30 younger 
adults who are paired with older adults in the intervention condition.
INTERVENTION: Older participants in the intervention group will be paired with 
younger study partners and receive positive, daily messages over four weeks 
using a novel technology platform. The daily messages combine intergenerational 
social engagement (growing a virtual garden with a younger study partner) and 
prosocial goals (donations to charity after reaching step count goals).
MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome is change in step count compared to baseline 
measured using a wrist-worn triaxial accelerometer. Secondary outcomes include 
time spent physically active, mood, generativity, loneliness, and cognition. 
Target mechanisms (social support and generativity) of physical activity 
engagement will be examined. Ease of use, acceptability, and feasibility of the 
technology as well as barriers and facilitators of participation will be 
assessed.
CONCLUSIONS: This research will advance our understanding of mechanisms and 
individual differences underlying successful physical activity engagement in 
older adults who are at risk for Alzheimer's disease. This knowledge will 
contribute to strategies for promoting health behaviours that can prevent the 
risk of Alzheimer's disease.

BACKGROUND: The number of people with dementia is expected to grow substantially 
across the world due to population aging, but cognitive impairment remains 
undetected and undiagnosed, especially in early stages. Newly available 
diagnostic tools such as digital cognitive assessments and blood biomarker tests 
may be well suited to increase the rates of early detection of dementia in 
primary care.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of the Davos Alzheimer's Collaborative Healthcare 
System Preparedness (DAC-SP) Early Detection Flagship Program was to improve the 
rate of early detection of cognitive impairment in primary care and 
non-specialty settings. We aimed to understand the program's impact on clinician 
attitudes, engagement, and confidence in diagnosing and managing cognitive 
impairment.
DESIGN: Survey of participating healthcare professionals before and after the 
intervention.
SETTING: The DAC Healthcare System Preparedness Early Detection Flagship Program 
was implemented in seven sites across six countries: Brazil, Jamaica, Japan, 
Mexico, Scotland, and the United States (2 sites).
PARTICIPANTS: 110 healthcare professionals, including, primary care physicians, 
specialists (neurologists and psychologists), nurses, nurse practitioners, 
physician assistants, social workers, and healthcare support workers completed 
the pre-intervention survey. 68 healthcare professionals completed the 
post-intervention survey.
INTERVENTION: Participating sites implemented a digital cognitive assessment 
tool and a blood biomarker test for the Alzheimer's pathology and were trained 
in the administration of the digital cognitive assessment tool. The intervention 
was adapted to each site for cultural relevance and operational feasibility.
MEASUREMENTS: Participants completed the General Practitioners Attitude and 
Confidence Scale for Dementia (GPACS-D), a 15-item scale with three subscales: 
Attitude to Care (six items), Confidence in Clinical Abilities (six items), and 
Engagement (three items). In addition to the subscale scores, the total GPACS-D 
score was reported.
RESULTS: Across all sites, there was a significant increase in the Confidence in 
Clinical Abilities score from 2.98 (SD = 0.77) pre-intervention to 3.27 (SD = 
0.72) post-intervention (p = 0.01), and in the total GPACS-D score from 3.48 (SD 
= 0.48) to 3.65 (SD = 0.39) (p = 0.01). There were non-significant increases in 
the Attitude to Care and Engagement scores across all sites.
CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of digital cognitive assessment tools and a 
blood biomarker test was associated with an increase in healthcare 
professionals' confidence in diagnosing and managing patients with cognitive 
impairment in primary care and non-specialty settings. Digital cognitive 
assessments and blood biomarker tests are promising tools that could be utilized 
in primary care to increase clinicians' confidence in detecting dementia and 
lead to timely clinical evaluation, treatment, and referral to supportive 
resources.
