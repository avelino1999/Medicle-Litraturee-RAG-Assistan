As our population continues to age, the search for effective therapeutic 
strategies to combat neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), has become more pressing than ever. For over a decade, researchers 
have focused on the amyloid cascade hypothesis in their pursuit of new drugs for 
AD. However, with numerous drugs targeting this hypothesis failing in clinical 
trials, it is clear that AD's pathogenesis is complex, and each individual may 
display significant heterogeneity. Consequently, treatment has shifted to focus 
on multiple targets and early AD detection. Furthermore, there is an urgent need 
to develop new models that address the shortcomings of current rodent models, 
which have species differences. The organoid model, a newly developed model, 
appears to be the future direction, but it must overcome some system immaturity 
problems.

This review article investigates the intricate relationship between 
nutrigenomics and neurological disorders, highlighting how genetic variations 
affect an individual's response to nutrients. The study delves into the role of 
diet-related oxidative stress and the gut-brain axis in the progression and 
management of brain disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, 
epilepsy, stroke, migraines, and depression. The review encompasses various 
clinical trials and introduces new trends and techniques, including omics and 
artificial intelligence, in identifying and managing neurological disorders. The 
main findings emphasize that personalized diet recommendations, tailored to an 
individual's genetic makeup, can significantly improve cognitive health and 
manage neurological conditions. The study concludes that further research in the 
field of nutrigenomics is essential to advancing personalized nutrition 
strategies for better neurological functioning, ultimately linking diet, genes, 
and brain health.

The exchange of information and materials between organelles plays a crucial 
role in regulating cellular physiological functions and metabolic levels. 
Mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes serve as physical 
contact channels between the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and the 
mitochondrial outer membrane, formed by various proteins and protein complexes. 
This microstructural domain mediates several specialized functions, including 
calcium (Ca 2+ ) signaling, autophagy, mitochondrial morphology, oxidative 
stress response, and apoptosis. Notably, the dysregulation of Ca 2+ signaling 
mediated by mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes is a 
critical factor in the pathogenesis of neurological diseases. Certain proteins 
or protein complexes within these membranes directly or indirectly regulate the 
distance between the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, as well as the 
transduction of Ca 2+ signaling. Conversely, Ca 2+ signaling mediated by 
mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes influences other 
mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membrane-associated functions. 
These functions can vary significantly across different neurological 
diseases-such as ischemic stroke, traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer's disease, 
Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington's disease-and 
their respective stages of progression. Targeted modulation of these 
disease-related pathways and functional proteins can enhance neurological 
function and promote the regeneration and repair of damaged neurons. Therefore, 
mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes-mediated Ca 2+ signaling 
plays a pivotal role in the pathological progression of neurological diseases 
and represents a significant potential therapeutic target. This review focuses 
on the effects of protein complexes in mitochondria-associated endoplasmic 
reticulum membranes and the distinct roles of mitochondria-associated 
endoplasmic reticulum membranes-mediated Ca 2+ signaling in neurological 
diseases, specifically highlighting the early protective effects and neuronal 
damage that can result from prolonged mitochondrial Ca 2+ overload or 
deficiency. This article provides a comprehensive analysis of the various 
mechanisms of Ca 2+ signaling mediated by mitochondria-associated endoplasmic 
reticulum membranes in neurological diseases, contributing to the exploration of 
potential therapeutic targets for promoting neuroprotection and nerve repair.

Copper homeostasis and neurodegenerative diseases.

Copper, one of the most prolific transition metals in the body, is required for 
normal brain physiological activity and allows various functions to work 
normally through its range of concentrations. Copper homeostasis is meticulously 
maintained through a complex network of copper-dependent proteins, including 
copper transporters (CTR1 and CTR2), the two copper ion transporters the Cu 
-transporting ATPase 1 (ATP7A) and Cu-transporting beta (ATP7B), and the three 
copper chaperones ATOX1, CCS, and COX17. Disruptions in copper homeostasis can 
lead to either the deficiency or accumulation of copper in brain tissue. 
Emerging evidence suggests that abnormal copper metabolism or copper binding to 
various proteins, including ceruloplasmin and metallothionein, is involved in 
the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. However, the exact mechanisms 
underlying these processes are not known. Copper is a potent oxidant that 
increases reactive oxygen species production and promotes oxidative stress. 
Elevated reactive oxygen species levels may further compromise mitochondrial 
integrity and cause mitochondrial dysfunction. Reactive oxygen species serve as 
key signaling molecules in copper-induced neuroinflammation, with elevated 
levels activating several critical inflammatory pathways. Additionally, copper 
can bind aberrantly to several neuronal proteins, including alpha-synuclein, 
tau, superoxide dismutase 1, and huntingtin, thereby inducing neurotoxicity and 
ultimately cell death. This study focuses on the latest literature evaluating 
the role of copper in neurodegenerative diseases, with a particular focus on 
copper-containing metalloenzymes and copper-binding proteins in the regulation 
of copper homeostasis and their involvement in neurodegenerative disease 
pathogenesis. By synthesizing the current findings on the functions of copper in 
oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and protein 
misfolding, we aim to elucidate the mechanisms by which copper contributes to a 
wide range of hereditary and neuronal disorders, such as Wilson's disease, 
Menkes' disease, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis, Huntington's disease, and multiple sclerosis. Potential clinically 
significant therapeutic targets, including superoxide dismutase 1, 
D-penicillamine, and 5,7-dichloro-2-[(dimethylamino)methyl]-8-hydroxyquinoline, 
along with their associated therapeutic agents, are further discussed. 
Ultimately, we collate evidence that copper homeostasis may function in the 
underlying etiology of several neurodegenerative diseases and offer novel 
insights into the potential prevention and treatment of these diseases based on 
copper homeostasis.

BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of ultrasound stimulation in treating Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) has been reported in previous studies, but the underlying 
mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigated the effects of ultrasound 
stimulation on the proportion and function of microglia of different phenotypes, 
as well as on the levels of inflammatory factors. Additionally, it revealed the 
alterations in proteomic molecules in the mouse hippocampus following ultrasound 
stimulation treatment, aiming to uncover potential new molecular mechanisms.
METHODS: Ultrasound stimulation was used to stimulate the hippocampus for 30 min 
per day for 5 days in the ultrasound stimulation-treated group. Amyloid plaque 
deposition was measured using immunofluorescence staining. M1 and M2 type 
microglia were labeled using immunofluorescent double staining, and the ratio 
was calculated. The levels of Aβ42, IL-10, and TNF-α were determined using ELISA 
kits. The quantitative proteomics method was employed to explore molecular 
changes in hippocampal proteins.
RESULTS: Ultrasound stimulation treatment reduced the average fluorescence 
intensity of amyloid plaques and the concentration of Aβ42. Compared to the AD 
group, ultrasound stimulation resulted in a 14% reduction in the proportion of 
M1 microglia and a 12% increase in the proportion of M2 microglia. The 
concentration of the anti-inflammatory factor IL-10 was significantly increased 
in the ultrasound stimulation-treated group. Proteomics analysis revealed 753 
differentially expressed proteins between the ultrasound stimulation-treated and 
AD groups, with most being enriched in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway of 
mitochondria. Additionally, the activity of cytochrome c oxidase, involved in 
oxidative phosphorylation, was increased after ultrasound stimulation treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound stimulation affects microglial polarization, reduces 
amyloid plaque load, and enhances levels of anti-inflammatory factors in APP/PS1 
mice. Proteomics analysis reveals molecular changes in hippocampal proteins 
after ultrasound stimulation treatment. The mechanism behind ultrasound 
stimulation-induced modulation of microglial polarization may be related to 
changes in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.

INTRODUCTION: Non-pharmacological interventions may offer significant benefits 
to the quality of life for persons with primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and 
their care partners but have lacked efficacy trials. To help fill the efficacy 
gap, we provide the feasibility of recruitment, enrollment, randomization, and 
baseline data for the Communication Bridge-2 (CB2) randomized controlled trial 
(RCT).
METHODS: CB2 is the first international, single enrollment site, Phase 2, Stage 
2, parallel-group, active control, RCT delivered via video chat to individuals 
with PPA and their care partners. Participants were recruited, screened, and 
randomized into one of two speech-language intervention arms.
RESULTS: Ninety-five participant dyads (PPA mean baseline age: 67.1; 48% female) 
from four countries were enrolled and randomized.
DISCUSSION: Global recruitment, enrollment, and randomization of individuals 
with PPA into a video chat-delivered non-pharmacologic RCT is feasible. This 
trial provides a potential model for conducting rigorous non-pharmacologic 
efficacy trials for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.
HIGHLIGHTS: Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) negatively impacts communication 
participation. Communication Bridge-2 (CB2) is a telemedicine-delivered 
randomized controlled trial. CB2 included global recruitment and randomization 
of 95 PPA participant dyads. CB2, the first international superiority trial for 
PPA using video chat shows feasibility. The study provides a model for rigorous 
non-pharmacologic trials for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.

INTRODUCTION: Alterations in locus coeruleus' (LC) metabolic turnover are 
associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD)-pathology and cognitive impairment. 
However, the evolution of these changes across disease stages and their 
functional relevance remains unknown.
METHODS: We examined associations of [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission 
tomography (FDG-PET) -derived LC metabolism with clinical diagnostic status, 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) -based AD biomarkers of AD pathology, and cognitive 
decline in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) participants 
(n = 604).
RESULTS: FDG-PET-derived LC metabolism was elevated in the earliest preclinical 
stages and lower in later disease stages. Higher LC metabolism was associated 
with attenuated memory decline in preclinical stages, particularly in those with 
low CSF Aβ42, but not in AD patients with cognitive impairment.
DISCUSSION: Higher locus coeruleus [18F]-FDG-PET-derived signal in the early 
preclinical stages of AD can confer cognitive resilience and may reflect 
increased metabolic activity, whereas later stages are characterized by lower LC 
FDG-PET-derived signal, possibly due to neurodegeneration.
HIGHLIGHTS: LC FDG-PET signal is lower in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. LC 
FDG-PET signal is higher in the preclinical stage of AD. We observed less memory 
decline in those with higher LC FDG-PET signal. Higher LC FDG-PET signal 
conferred cognitive resilience in preclinical AD.

The presence of multiple pathologies is the largest predictor of dementia. A 
major gap in the field is the in vivo detection of mixed pathologies and their 
antecedents. The Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers (ADRCs) are uniquely 
positioned to address this gap. The ADRCs longitudinally follow ≈ 17,000 
participants, ranging from cognitively unimpaired to dementia, arising from 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD; e.g., AD, Lewy body 
disorders, vascular). Motivated by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative's (ADNI) impact, the ADRC Consortium for Clarity in ADRD Research 
Through Imaging (CLARiTI) was formed. Leveraging existing ADRC infrastructure, 
CLARiTI will integrate standardized imaging and plasma collection to 
characterize mixed pathologies and use community-engaged research methods to 
ensure that ≥ 25% of the sample is from underrepresented populations (e.g., 
ethnoculturally minoritized, low education). The resulting ADRD profiles, within 
a more diverse sample, will provide key resources for ADRCs and an 
unprecedented, more generalizable publicly available imaging-plasma dataset. 
HIGHLIGHTS: In vivo detection of mixed pathologies is critical for Alzheimer's 
disease and related dementias research. The Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers 
(ADRCs) are uniquely positioned to address gaps related to mixed pathologies. 
The ADRC Consortium for Clarity in ADRD Research Through Imaging (CLARiTI) will 
enhance this national program by adding standardized imaging and plasma 
collection to existing ADRC infrastructure. This effort will provide key 
resources for ADRCs and an unprecedented publicly available 
imaging-plasma-neuropath dataset.

Inflammation is emerging as a critical player in the disease progression of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) by its interaction with amyloid beta plaques in a 
feed-forward loop. There is also a decline in the nourishment and enriching 
neurotrophic factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), in the brain. 
Therefore, supplementing the brain with BDNF by gene delivery and delivering the 
anti-inflammatory agent, cannabidiol (CBD) in this case, to mitigate 
inflammation-induced disease cascade offers an attractive treatment strategy. To 
achieve the brain localization of CBD and pBDNF, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) 
functionalized with mannose and penetratin were utilized. CBD and pBDNF were 
successfully encapsulated in the LNPs (more than 80%) with a size less than 180 
nm, polydispersity index less than 0.25, and zeta potential of 23 mV. CBD was 
released from the formulation over a period of a week. The dual-functionalized 
LNPs demonstrated higher cellular uptake of CBD and expressed a significantly 
higher amount of BDNF (p-value <0.05) after transfection than their nonmodified 
counterparts in four brain cell lines, i.e., brain endothelial cells (b.END3), 
immortalized microglia cells (IMGs), primary astrocytes, and primary neurons. 
Similarly, the permeation of CBD through the dual-modified LNPs across the in 
vitro coculture blood-brain barrier model was significantly higher (p-value 
<0.05) compared to free CBD or nonfunctionalized nanoparticles. The LNPs 
demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity against lipopolysaccharides and human 
amyloid beta1-42 oligomer induction as they reduced the protein and mRNA 
expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α (p < 0.05) and IL-1β (p < 0.05) 
in IMG cells. In summary, the penetratin and mannose-functionalized LNPs 
encapsulating CBD and pBDNF could serve as a promising therapy in AD, requiring 
further validation in animal models.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a highly heritable disease (60%-80%). 
Amyloid beta (Aβ) 42/40, neurofilament light chain (NfL), and glial fibrillary 
acidic protein (GFAP) are plasma biomarkers for AD. Clinical biomarker research 
would be served by an understanding of the sources of variance in these markers.
METHODS: Blood concentrations of Aβ42/40, NfL, and GFAP of twins and their 
families (monozygotic twins: 1574, dizygotic twins: 1266, other: 3657) were 
analyzed on the Simoa HD-X. Twin-family models were used to estimate 
proportional genetic contributions to the variance in biomarker levels.
RESULTS: Heritability estimates were 16% for Aβ42/40, 42% for NfL, and 60% for 
GFAP. NfL and GFAP were significantly correlated with each other (0.37) but not 
with Aβ42/40.
DISCUSSION: The heritability of Aβ42/40 (16%) is lower than the heritability of 
AD, suggesting strong environmental influences on this biomarker. The lack of 
correlation between NfL/GFAP and Aβ42/40 indicates these markers may be on 
different biological pathways.
HIGHLIGHTS: Heritability is found for glial fibrillary acidic protein (60%), 
neurofilament light chain (42%), and amyloid beta (Aβ) 42/40 (16%) plasma 
levels. Aβ42/40 plasma levels are sensitive to person-specific environmental 
influences.

Medicine, Kanagawa Dental University School of Dentistry, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, 
Japan.

BACKGROUND: The potential of Ultra-Ma, an ultrasonic head stimulator, for the 
supplementary treatment of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) was evaluated in 
patients with various symptoms under poor control by drug therapy.
METHODS: Patients with DLB treated with choline esterase inhibitor or L-DOPA, 
either alone or in combination, and who met inclusion criteria were enrolled. 
Four weeks of placebo stimulation was followed by 8 weeks of active ultrasonic 
stimulation and a 4-week follow-up. Primary endpoints were the effects of 
ultrasonic head stimulation on both cognitive dysfunction and behavioral and 
psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). Cognitive dysfunction was evaluated 
using the Japanese versions of the Mini-Mental State Examination and Montreal 
Cognitive Assessment, and BPSD was assessed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory 
Brief Questionnaire Form. For cognitive fluctuations, the Cognitive Fluctuation 
Inventory served as an index. Improvements in parkinsonism, activities of daily 
living, and caregiver burden were examined as secondary endpoints.
RESULTS: Twelve patients were enrolled. The primary endpoint was significantly 
improved during the active stimulation period, as were secondary endpoint 
ratings for parkinsonism and caregiver burden. No notable adverse events 
occurred.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that ultrasonic head stimulation has 
supplementary potential when combined with drug treatment in DLB.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies were examined effects of social restriction by 
COVID-19 pandemic on elderly peoples or compared difference of before/after 
restrictions on patients with Alzheimer disease-related dementia (ADRD). Here, 
we assessed the effects of restrictions on the cognitive function of the 
patients by comparing control group.
METHODS: We examined the impact on cognitive function using the Alzheimer 
Disease Assessment Scale (Japanese version) cognitive subscale (ADAS-JCOG), in 
patients with mild to moderate ADRD by a post hoc subgroup analysis of 
double-blinded, noninferiority study of donepezil 27.5 mg patches and donepezil 
hydrochloride 5 mg tablets (JapicCTI-194582). After demonstrating the 
noninferiority of both treatments, we used combined data for this analysis.
RESULTS: The analyzed subpopulation of the per-protocol set groups was balanced 
(n=126 and 135, respectively). Patient demographics were similar between 
subgroups. The difference of ADAS-JCOG scores [least-squares mean (95%CI)] 
between the groups was 0.388 (-0.377 to 1.152, not statistically significant).
CONCLUSION: Social isolation affects cognitive function on ADRD and this 
knowledge should be considered in future.

PURPOSE: The National Institute of Health Toolbox Cognition Battery (NIHTB-CB) 
is increasingly used in Alzheimer disease (AD) research. We examined the 
relation of AD biomarkers with performance in the NIHTB-CB in late middle age.
METHODS: This is a cross-sectional analysis of 334 Hispanic participants aged 
64.22±3.35 years from a study of AD biomarkers. White matter hyperintensities 
(WMH), infarcts, and cortical thickness in AD regions (CT) were assessed with 3T 
magnetic resonance imaging. Amyloid and tau were assessed with 18F-Florbetaben 
and 18F-MK6240 positron emission tomography, respectively.
RESULTS: Lower CT and infarcts were associated with worse Oral Reading 
Recognition and Cognition Crystallized Composite scores. Lower CT and higher WMH 
were associated with worse Pattern Comparison Processing Speed. Amyloid and tau 
were not associated with any test.
DISCUSSION: Amyloid and tau, the culprits of AD, are not related to the NIHTB-CB 
in late middle age. Continued follow-up will reveal if AD impacts performance on 
the NIHTB-CB.

BACKGROUND: Individuals with dementia are particularly vulnerable during 
emergency situations due to challenges with cognition, mobility, and daily 
functioning. However, little is known about how disruptive events may 
specifically impact the health of those with dementia.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate changes in health outcomes for individuals with and 
without dementia surrounding the Israel-Gaza war in October 2023. Specifically, 
we analyzed and compared changes in mental health status, medication adherence, 
healthcare service utilization, and associated costs between individuals with 
dementia (Study Group) and those without dementia (Control Group) during the 
period surrounding the Israel-Gaza war in October 2023.
METHOD: A prospective cohort study compared outcomes between individuals with 
dementia (Study Group, n = 24,178) and without (Control Group, n = 250,652) 
before and after the crisis onset. The conflict precipitously threw national 
systems into disarray, recruited healthcare personnel to the war effort, and 
disrupted supply chains.
RESULTS: Compared to baseline, analysis revealed alterations in patterns of 
dementia diagnoses, healthcare service utilization, medication adherence, and 
associated costs during the crisis period for both groups. However, the Study 
Group experienced comparatively larger declines.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings provide insights into how humanitarian emergencies, 
through disruption of health systems and care networks, differentially impact 
continuity of dementia care. This underscores the need for tailored crisis 
response strategies to address the heightened vulnerabilities of patients with 
dementia.

BACKGROUND: Carotenoids, potent antioxidants in fruits and vegetables, have 
recently garnered attention for their potential therapeutic effects against 
neurodegenerative diseases. This study focuses on the interaction and 
anti-aggregation properties of conventional and unconventional carotenoids found 
in red mamey fruit, a nutraceutical fruit that is a rich source of these 
compounds.
OBJECTIVE: To assess computational the interaction between of amyloid-β (Aβ) 
peptide with a set of carotenoids and three carotenoids previously explored in 
experimental assays as well as to assess ADMET prediction of carotenoids 
selected by computational analysis results.
METHODS: We analyzed the interaction between these carotenoids and Aβ peptides 
using molecular docking, a key factor in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. 
Selected carotenoids were compared with the reference compounds cryptocapsin 
(1), zeaxanthin (2), lutein (3), and cryptocapsin-5,6-epoxide (24), which 
previously demonstrated significant anti-aggregation activity against Aβ. Using 
SwissADME and ADMET Predictor® software to determine the pharmaceutical analysis 
prediction.
RESULTS: Computational analysis identified (5R,8R)-sapotexanthin-5,8-epoxide 
(19) and (5S,8S)-cryptocapsin-5,8-epoxide (26) as the most promising candidates 
due to their strong binding affinity and potential anti-aggregation properties 
against Aβ. The pharmaceutical analysis identified compounds 
(5S,8S)-cryptocapsin-5,8-epoxide (26) and (5R,8R)-cryptocapsin-5,8-epoxide (28) 
as the most promising compounds. Our findings suggest that specific 
modifications in the carotenoid structure, particularly modifications in the 
type of epoxidation and stereochemistry, can significantly influence the 
biological activity of carotenoids and biopharmaceutical performance.
CONCLUSIONS: These results provide valuable insights for future in vitro studies 
of most potential carotenoids (19 and 26) and the development of potential 
therapeutic agents for AD.

Recent Studies on Heterocyclic Cholinesterase Inhibitors Against Alzheimer's 
Disease.

Tok F(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Marmara 
University, İstanbul, Türkiye.

Alzheimer's disease is a progressive and neurodegenerative disease characterized 
by impairment in emotion, language, memory, and cognitive judgment. There are 
many factors related to Alzheimer's disease, such as amyloid beta plaques (Aβ) 
due to impaired metabolism of amyloid precursor protein (APP), tau 
hyperphosphorylation, and accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles, and 
disruption of the cholinergic system. Disruption of the cholinergic system 
responsible for cognitive function and memory processes is one of the important 
causes of Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, cholinesterase (acetylcholinesterase 
and butyrylcholinesterase) inhibitors that maintain choline (acetylcholine and 
butyrylcholine) levels in the synaptic gap play an important role in the 
symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Numerous studies have been carried 
out against Alzheimer's disease involving acetylcholinesterase and 
butyrylcholinesterase inhibitors. However, there are very few drugs (tacrine, 
rivastigmine, galantamine, and donepezil) approved as cholinesterase inhibitors. 
Therefore, cholinesterase inhibitors are needed against Alzheimer's disease. 
This review is focused on using heterocyclic rings that show remarkable 
cholinesterase inhibitory activity for Alzheimer's disease. In this review, 
chemical structures and structure-activity relationships of recently reported 
cholinesterase inhibitors are emphasized. This review will give important ideas 
to medicinal chemists in the discovery and development of potent cholinesterase 
inhibitors in their future studies.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a neurodegenerative disease can cause 
behavioral impairments due to oxidative stress. Aging and oxidative conditions 
are some AD risk factors.
OBJECTIVE: We assessed the influence of geraniol (GR), an acyclic monoterpene 
alcohol, on behavioral functions, hippocampal oxidative status, and histological 
alterations in AD rats induced by amyloid-β (Aβ).
METHODS: Male Wistar rats (n = 70) were randomly allocated to the control, sham, 
AD, control-GR (100 mg/kg; per oral: P.O.), AD-GR (100 mg/kg; P.O.; treatment), 
GR-AD (100 mg/kg; P.O.; pretreatment), and GR-AD-GR (100 mg/kg; P.O.; 
pretreatment + treatment) groups. GR administration was done for four continuous 
weeks. After treatments, novel object recognition (NOR) and Morris water maze 
(MWM) tests assessed the animals' behavior. Then, hippocampal specimens were 
collected for biochemical assessment. Finally, the number of intact neurons was 
identified in the hippocampus using hematoxylin and eosin staining.
RESULTS: Aβ microinjection increased learning and memory deficits in both NOR 
and MWM tests, oxidative stress status, and neuronal loss. Oral GR 
administration improved behavioral deficits and reduced oxidative stress status 
and neuronal loss in the Aβ-infused animals.
CONCLUSIONS: GR ameliorates behavioral impairments through a decrease in 
neuronal degeneration and oxidative stress.

Mitochondrial dysfunction and associated inflammatory signaling are pivotal in 
both aging and in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Studies have also shown that 
hypothalamic function is affected in AD. The hypothalamus may be a target for AD 
drugs given that mitochondrial alterations are observed in the hypothalamus. 
This study investigated how age and sex affect mitochondrial bioenergetics and 
inflammatory signaling in the hypothalamic mitochondria of 3xTg and control mice 
at 2, 6, and 13 months, aiming to enhance our understanding of these processes 
in aging and AD. Parameters included oxygen consumption rates, expression levels 
of subunits comprising mitochondrial complexes I-V, the enzymatic activity of 
cytochrome c oxidase (COX), transcription factors associated with inflammation 
such as NF-κB, pIκB-α, Nrf2, and other inflammatory biomarkers. Hypothalamic 
mitochondrial dysfunction was observed in 3xTg females as early as 2 months, but 
no changes were detected in 3xTg males until 6 months of age. In 3xTg mice, 
subunit expression levels for mitochondrial complexes I-II were significantly 
reduced in both sexes. Significant sex-based differences in COX activity were 
also observed at 13 months of age, with levels being lower in females compared 
to males. In addition, significant sex differences were indicated in NF-κB, 
pIκB-α, Nrf2, and other inflammatory biomarkers at different age groups during 
normal aging and AD progression. These findings highlight important sex 
differences in hypothalamic bioenergetics and inflammation, offering insights 
into potential new targets for preventing and/or treating AD.

Plain Language Summary: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a gradual onset disorder, 
characterized by memory impairments. The greatest risk factor is age. In 
addition, almost two-thirds of Americans with AD are women, and reasons for this 
health disparity are unclear. While it’s true that women live longer than men, 
longevity alone does not explain this disparity. Interestingly, studies have 
also shown that hypothalamic function is affected in AD, but it appears that men 
are affected differently than women. The hypothalamus regulates numerous 
functions, including sex hormone regulation, sleep/wake cycles, and energy 
expenditure, to name a few. In this study, we examined how changes in energy 
metabolism may be different in the hypothalamus in male vs. female genetically 
engineered mice that model AD pathology.

BACKGROUND: The increasing prevalence of dementia and the introduction of 
disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) highlight the need for efficient diagnostic 
pathways in memory clinics. We present a data-driven approach to efficiently 
guide stepwise diagnostic testing for three clinical scenarios: 1) syndrome 
diagnosis, 2) etiological diagnosis, and 3) eligibility for DMT.
METHODS: We used data from two memory clinic cohorts (ADC, PredictND), including 
504 patients with dementia (302 Alzheimer's disease, 107 frontotemporal 
dementia, 35 vascular dementia, 60 dementia with Lewy bodies), 191 patients with 
mild cognitive impairment, and 188 cognitively normal controls (CN). Tests 
included digital cognitive screening (cCOG), neuropsychological and functional 
assessment (NP), MRI with automated quantification, and CSF biomarkers. 
Sequential testing followed a predetermined order, guided by diagnostic 
certainty. Diagnostic certainty was determined using a clinical decision support 
system (CDSS) that generates a disease state index (DSI, 0-1), indicating the 
probability of the syndrome diagnosis or underlying etiology. Diagnosis was 
confirmed if the DSI exceeded a predefined threshold based on 
sensitivity/specificity cutoffs relevant to each clinical scenario. Diagnostic 
accuracy and the need for additional testing were assessed at each step.
RESULTS: Using cCOG as a prescreener for 1) syndrome diagnosis has the potential 
to accurately reduce the need for extensive NP (42%), resulting in syndrome 
diagnosis in all patients, with a diagnostic accuracy of 0.71, which was 
comparable to using NP alone. For 2) etiological diagnosis, stepwise testing 
resulted in an etiological diagnosis in 80% of patients with a diagnostic 
accuracy of 0.77, with MRI needed in 77%, and CSF in 37%. When 3) determining 
DMT eligibility, stepwise testing (100% cCOG, 83% NP, 75% MRI) selected 60% of 
the patients for confirmatory CSF testing and eventually identified 90% of the 
potentially eligible patients with AD dementia.
CONCLUSIONS: Different diagnostic pathways are accurate and efficient depending 
on the setting. As such, a data-driven tool holds promise for assisting 
clinicians in selecting tests of added value across different clinical contexts. 
This becomes especially important with DMT availability, where the need for more 
efficient diagnostic pathways is crucial to maintain the accessibility and 
affordability of dementia diagnoses.

BACKGROUND: This randomized, open-label study examined the therapeutic effects 
of Neurocognitive Adaptive Training for Depression (NCAT-D) combined with 
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) on cognitive impairment among 
patients with late-life depression (LLD).
METHOD: Study data were collected from May 5, 2021, to April 21, 2023. 
Outpatients who met the diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder 
according to the fifth revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Mental Disorders (DSM-5) (i.e., a total score on the 17-item Hamilton Depression 
Rating Scale (HAMD-17) ≥ 18 and a total score on the Montreal Cognitive 
Assessment scale (MOCA) < 26) were recruited at Beijing Anding Hospital. These 
participants were randomly assigned to receive up to 12 weeks of NCAT-D and 
SSRIs treatment (n = 57) or SSRIs with a control treatment (n = 61). Primary 
outcomes included changes in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive 
Subscale (ADAS-Cog) scores from baseline to week 12 between the two groups. 
Assessments were conducted at baseline, after 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and at 
12 weeks. Mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis was performed on 
modified intention-to-treat (mITT) and completer populations.
RESULTS: The full analysis set (FAS) included 118 patients (NCAT-D and SSRIs 
group, n = 57; SSRIs and Control group, n = 61). During the 12-week study 
period, MMRM analysis revealed a significantly greater reduction in cognitive 
function (as indicated by ADAS-cog total scores) from baseline to post-treatment 
in the NCAT-D and SSRIs group compared to the SSRIs and Control groups [(F 
(1,115) = 13.65, least-squares mean difference [95% CI]: -2.77 [- 3.73, - 1.81], 
p < 0.001)]. The intervention group showed a significantly greater reduction in 
HAMD-17 scores compared to the control group [MMRM, estimated mean difference 
(SE) between groups: -3.59 [- 5.02, - 2.15], p < 0.001]. There was no 
significant difference in the incidence of adverse events between the two 
groups.
CONCLUSIONS: NCAT-D combined with SSRIs was efficacious and well tolerated in 
LLD patients with cognitive impairment.

The intricate relationship between brain vascular diseases and neurodegeneration 
has garnered increased attention in the scientific community. With an aging 
population, the incidence of these two conditions is likely to increase, making 
it imperative to understand the underlying common molecular mechanisms and 
unveiling novel avenues for therapy. Prompted by the observation that Aβ peptide 
aggregation has been implicated in the development of cerebral amyloid 
angiopathy (CAA) and that elevated concentrations of vascular endothelial growth 
factor (VEGF) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been correlated with less 
cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD), we demonstrate that a small 
peptide (Pep9) encompassing the 10-30 sequence of VEGF exhibits significant 
ability to inhibit the aggregation of the Aβ1-42 peptide, as well as the 
formation of toxic oligomers. AFM studies confirmed this inhibitory capacity, 
which is also paralleled by a significant reduction of the random coil to a 
beta-sheet conformational transition. Further studies have shown that Pep9 
protects differentiated neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells from Aβ toxicity, being even 
more effective than full-length protein in preventing amyloid-induced neuronal 
death. The use of a control peptide wherein two histidines are substituted with 
glycines (H11G and H12G) suggests a close relationship between the peptide amino 
acid sequence and its antiaggregating/neuroprotective activity. Overall, this 
study provides insight into the role of VEGF in AD and suggests that specific 
VEGF fragments could be beneficial in the treatment of this condition.

Sex differences, driven in part by steroid hormones, shape the structure and 
function of the brain throughout the lifespan and manifest across brain health 
and disease. The influence of steroid hormones on neuroplasticity, particularly 
in the adult hippocampus, differs between the sexes, which has important 
implications for disorders and diseases that compromise hippocampus integrity, 
such as depression and Alzheimer disease. This Review outlines the intricate 
relationship between steroid hormones and hippocampal neuroplasticity across the 
adult lifespan and explores how the unique physiology of male and 
female individuals can affect health and disease. Despite calls to include sex 
and gender in research, only 5% of neuroscience studies published in 2019 
directly investigated the influence of sex. Drawing on insights from depression, 
Alzheimer disease and relevant hippocampal plasticity, this Review underscores 
the importance of considering sex and steroid hormones to achieve a 
comprehensive understanding of disease susceptibility and mechanisms. Such 
consideration will enable the discovery of personalized treatments, ultimately 
leading to improved health outcomes for all.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is an incurable and debilitating progressive, 
neurodegenerative disorder which is the leading cause of dementia worldwide. 
Neuropathologically, AD is characterized by the accumulation of Aβ amyloid 
plaques in the microenvironment of brain cells and neurovascular walls, chronic 
neuroinflammation, resulting in neuronal and synaptic loss, myelin and axonal 
failure, as well as significant reduction in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. The 
hippocampal formation is particularly vulnerable to this degenerative process, 
due to early dysfunction of the cholinergic circuit. Neurotrophic factors 
consist major regulatory molecules and their decline in AD is considered as an 
important cause of disease onset and progression. Novel pharmacological 
approaches are targeting the downstream pathways controlled by neurotrophins, 
such as nerve growth factor (NGF) receptors, TrkA and p75NTR, which enhance 
hippocampal neurogenic capacity and neuroprotective mechanisms, and potentially 
counteract the neurotoxic effects of amyloid deposition. BNN27 is a non-toxic, 
newly developed 17-spiro-steroid analog, penetrating the blood-brain-barrier 
(BBB) and mimicking the neuroprotective effects of NGF, acting as selective 
activator of its receptors, both TrkA and p75NTR, thus promoting survival of 
various neuronal cell types. Our present research aims at determining whether 
and which aspects of the AD-related pathology, BNN27 is able to alleviate, 
exploring the cellular and molecular AD components and link these changes with 
improvements in the cognitive performance of an animal AD model, the 5xFAD mice. 
Our results clearly indicate that BNN27 administration significantly reduced 
amyloid-β load in whole brain of the animals, enhanced adult hippocampal 
neurogenesis, restored cholinergic function and synaptogenesis, reducing 
inflammatory activation and leading to significant restoration of cognitive 
functions. BNN27 may represent a new lead multimodal molecule with 
neuroprotective, neurogenic and anti-neuroinflammatory actions for developing 
druggable anti-Alzheimeric agents. Proteomics data are available via 
ProteomeXchange with the identifier PXD044699.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, leads to 
progressive dementia, which impairs decision-making, problem-solving, and 
communication. While there is no cure, early detection can facilitate treatments 
to slow its progression. Deep learning (DL) significantly enhances AD detection 
by analyzing brain imaging data to identify early biomarkers, improving 
diagnostic accuracy and predicting disease progression more precisely than 
traditional methods. In this article, we propose an ensemble methodology for DL 
models to detect AD from brain MRIs. We trained an enhanced Xception 
architecture once to produce multiple snapshots, providing diverse insights into 
MRI features. A decision-level fusion strategy was employed, combining decision 
scores with a RF meta-learner using a blending algorithm. The efficacy of our 
ensemble technique is confirmed by the experimental findings, which categorize 
Alzheimer's into four groups with 99.14% accuracy. This methodology may help 
medical practitioners provide patients with Alzheimer's with individualized 
care. Subsequent efforts will concentrate on enhancing the model's efficacy via 
its generalization to a variety of datasets.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and is 
characterized by the accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) and phosphorylated tau. 
Neuroinflammation, mainly mediated by glial activation, plays an important role 
in AD progression. Although there is growing evidence for the 
anti-neuroinflammatory and neuroprotective effects of the cannabinoid system 
modulation, the detailed mechanism remains unclear. To address these issues, we 
analyzed the expression levels of cannabinoid receptor type II (Cnr2/Cb2) in 
AppNL-G-F/NL-G-F mice and human AD precuneus, which is vulnerable to amyloid 
deposition in AD, and the effects of JWH 133, a selective CB2 agonist, on 
neuroinflammation in primary glial cells and neuroinflammation and cognitive 
impairment in AppNL-G-F/NL-G-F mice. The levels of Cnr2/Cb2 were upregulated in 
microglia isolated from the cerebral cortex of AppNL-G-F/NL-G-F mice. CNR2 
expression was also increased in RNAs derived from human precuneus with advanced 
AD pathology. Chronic oral administration of JWH 133 significantly ameliorated 
the cognitive impairment of AppNL-G-F/NL-G-F mice without neuropsychiatric side 
effects. Microglia and astrocyte mRNAs were directly isolated from the mouse 
cerebral cortex by magnetic-activated cell sorting, and the gene expression was 
determined by quantitative PCR. JWH 133 administration significantly decreased 
reactive astrocyte markers and microglial C1q, an inducer for the reactive 
astrocytes in AppNL-G-F/NL-G-F mice. In addition, JWH133 administration 
inhibited the expression of p-STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of 
transcription 3) in astrocytes in AppNL-G-F/NL-G-F mice. Furthermore, JWH 133 
administration suppressed dystrophic presynaptic terminals surrounding amyloid 
plaques. In conclusion, stimulation of microglial CB2 ameliorates cognitive 
dysfunction in AppNL-G-F/NL-G-F mice by controlling astrocyte activation and 
inducing beneficial neuroinflammation, and our study has implications that CB2 
may represent an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of AD and 
perhaps other neurodegenerative diseases involving neuroinflammation.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Callicarpa kwangtungensis Chun (CK) is a 
traditional herb for the treatment of blood stasis, hemostasis, 
anti-inflammation, and antidepressant. Previous studies have showen that CK 
extract has significant anti-neuroinflammatory activity. However, the mechanism 
by which it treats AD is still unclear.
AIM OF STUDY: This study aimed to investigate the effects and mechanisms of CK 
in ameliorating AD pathology using in vivo and in vitro models, supported by a 
multi-omics analysis approach.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The chemical composition of CK was characterized using 
UPLC-QE Plus-MS/MS. The effects and mechanisms of CK on AD pathology were then 
investigated using APP/PS1 mice and BV2 and HT22 cell models, with comprehensive 
insights provided by network pharmacology, transcriptomics, and metabolomics 
analyses.
RESULTS: This study is the first to report the identification of 146 compounds 
from CK. CK administration led to significant improvements in cognitive 
function, reduced amyloid-beta and neurofibrillary tangle formation, and 
inhibited the activation of microglia and astrocytes in APP/PS1 mice. 
Comprehensive analyses suggest that CK may modulate the TCA cycle through the 
PI3K-AKT signaling pathways and inflammation-related MAPK and NF-κB signaling 
pathways. In vitro studies revealed that CK significantly inhibited LPS-induced 
inflammation and oxidative stress in BV2 cells, as well as reduced oxidative 
stress and neuronal apoptosis in HT22 cells.
CONCLUSION: These findings underscore the potential of CK as a therapeutic agent 
in alleviating AD pathology. This study offers new insights into CK's 
mechanisms, suggesting that its therapeutic effects may be achieved through the 
coordinated reduction of neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and neuronal 
apoptosis across multiple pathways, collectively working to counteract AD 
pathology.

Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease 
(PD), and multiple sclerosis (MS) are pathologies associated with neuronal 
disorders and degradation. They are difficult to detect in their early stages, 
when it is crucial for appropriate treatment to be implemented. Currently, many 
biosensors are being developed to enable the determination of compounds 
characteristic of the aforementioned diseases. This review includes a 
de-scription of the structure of biosensors, as well as their applications in 
many areas of qualitative and quantitative analysis, with particular emphasis on 
diagnostics. The structures of biosensors that can potentially be used for the 
diagnosis of AD, PD and MS are discussed, as well as their characteristics, 
which depend on the technique used for the analysis and the type of recognition 
element capable of specifically binding a given biomarker. A description is also 
given of biosensors classified according to the type of sample used for 
quantitative determinations.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) exhibits distinct biochemical and histopathological 
attributes, encompassing cellular, neuronal, and oxidative impairment. There is 
also an abnormal buildup, misfolding and clumping of amyloid β (Aβ). The present 
study aimed to explore the influence of the antihyperglycemic agent metformin on 
rats with AD-like symptoms, while also elucidating the intricate relationship 
between insulin resistance and AD. The rats were categorized into five groups: a 
control group, a saline-administered group, a metformin-treated group, AD-model 
rats, and AD-rats treated with a 200 mg/kg dose of metformin. Cognitive 
impairment was rated using the classical labyrinth test. Moreover, serum 
biochemical parameters, encompassing glucose levels, Homeostatic Model 
Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), lipid 
profile, kidney, and liver function, were evaluated. Additionally, oxidative, 
antioxidant, and neurotransmitter parameters were measured in hippocampus 
tissues. Also, the Aβ and insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS-2) were measured by 
immunoblotting. Besides hippocampal histopathology, glial fibrillary acidic 
protein (GFAP) and calretinin immunoreactivity were monitored. The study 
findings disclosed deficits in memory and learning capabilities among AD rats. 
Furthermore, AD-afflicted rats exhibited heightened glucose levels, elevated 
HOMA-IR and HbA1c values, alongside compromised liver, and kidney functions. 
Additionally, an upsurge in oxidative stress coincided with a notable reduction 
in the antioxidant system and neurotransmitters activities. The levels of Aβ 
deposition increased, while IRS-2 expression subsided, accompanied by 
alterations in the hippocampal structure and neuronal damage. These changes were 
paralleled by an intensification in GFAP reactivity and a detracting in 
calretinin reactivity. Metformin was altogether able to move forward cognitive 
execution by means of bringing down oxidative stress and Aβ conglomeration. 
Furthermore, metformin was able to improve neurotransmitters and insulin 
signals. AD, glucose impairment, and brain insulin resistance are completely 
interlinked, and future AD medications may be inspired by diabetic medication.

This work aimed to formulate surface-modified berberine hydrochloride 
(BER)-loaded liposomes containing in-situ nasal gel for bran targeting. The 
liposomes were prepared by ethanol-injection method and optimized following a 32 
full-factorial design. Size, morphology, zeta potential, ex-vivo permeation, and 
in-vitro release were estimated. The surface of optimized liposome was modified 
with ascorbic acid. The size of surface-modified liposomes was bigger (191.4 nm) 
than the unmodified liposomes (171 nm). Surface-modified liposomes were embedded 
in in-situ gel using poloxamer and Carbopol 934P. Liposomal in-situ gel showed 
higher permeation (71.94%) in contrast to the plain gel (46.64%). In-vivo 
pharmacokinetic examination of payload from liposomal in-situ gel displayed 
higher concentration in brain (Cmax of 93.50 ng/mL). The liposomal in-situ nasal 
gel had a higher drug targeting efficiency (138.43%) and a higher drug targeting 
potential (27.77%) confirming improved brain targeting. In male Wistar rats, the 
pharmacodynamic parameters (path length and escape latency) were evaluated with 
trimethyl tin-induced neurodegeneration. Animals treated with BER-loaded in-situ 
gel significantly decreased escape latency and path length in comparison to the 
control group. Histopathological assessment showed that the formulated gel was 
safe for intranasal administration. The developed formulation has the potential 
to effectively enhance the efficacy of BER in Alzheimer's disease management.

Background: The utility of single-pulse TMS (transcranial magnetic 
stimulation)-evoked EEG (electroencephalograph) potentials (TEPs) has been 
extensively studied in the past three decades. TEPs have been shown to provide 
insights into features of cortical excitability and connectivity, reflecting 
mechanisms of excitatory/inhibitory balance, in various neurological and 
psychiatric conditions. In the present study, we sought to review and summarize 
the most studied neurological and psychiatric clinical indications utilizing 
single-pulse TEP and describe its promise as an informative novel tool for the 
evaluation of brain physiology. Methods: A thorough search of PubMed, Embase, 
and Google Scholar for original research utilizing single-pulse TMS-EEG and the 
measurement of TEP was conducted. Our review focused on the indications and 
outcomes most clinically relevant, commonly studied, and well-supported 
scientifically. Results: We included a total of 55 publications and summarized 
them by clinical application. We categorized these publications into seven 
sub-sections: healthy aging, Alzheimer's disease (AD), disorders of 
consciousness (DOCs), stroke rehabilitation and recovery, major depressive 
disorder (MDD), Parkinson's disease (PD), as well as prediction and monitoring 
of treatment response. Conclusions: TEP is a useful measurement of mechanisms 
underlying neuronal networks. It may be utilized in several clinical 
applications. Its most prominent uses include monitoring of consciousness levels 
in DOCs, monitoring and prediction of treatment response in MDD, and diagnosis 
of AD. Additional applications including the monitoring of stroke rehabilitation 
and recovery, as well as a diagnostic aid for PD, have also shown encouraging 
results but require further evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Background: Olive leaves are a significant source of biophenols, which have a 
beneficial impact on cognitive performance. Objective: To examine, for the first 
time, in humans the effect of the daily consumption of a beverage containing 
olive leaf extract (OLE) versus a Mediterranean diet (MeDi) on patients 
diagnosed with mild Alzheimer's Disease (AD), in addition to their regular 
treatment. Methods: A randomized clinical trial compared OLE's effects on 
cognitive and functional performance in 55 mild AD patients. Each participant 
was randomly assigned to two groups: (1) Group 1 was given olive leaves for 
making a daily beverage and MeDi instructions through monthly diet programs; (2) 
Group 2 received only the MeDi instructions. After six months, all participants 
underwent a second neuropsychological evaluation. Results: Group 1 participants 
had statistically significantly higher MMSE scores compared to Group 2 with a 
p-value of 0.0135. Specifically, the mean MMSE difference in patients receiving 
OLE was close to 0, indicating no memory deterioration, whereas in controls it 
was -4.1, indicative of cognitive decline. The remaining neuropsychological 
assessments (FRSSD, FUCAS, ADAS-Cog, CDR, GDS, and NPI) revealed better results 
in the OLE group, except for GDS, which showed no change, but without 
statistically significant differences between the two groups.

Pharmaceutical residues in aquatic ecosystems pose significant environmental and 
public health challenges. Identifying the presence and levels of these 
pharmaceuticals is crucial. This study developed an analytical method to detect 
pharmaceuticals used for Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's (PD) disease, 
including psychiatric drugs and the stimulant caffeine, targeting 30 compounds. 
Optimized mass spectrometric and liquid chromatographic parameters enabled 
robust detection and quantification. The methodology was applied to 25 surface 
and wastewater samples. Twenty-one compounds were detected including eight 
psychiatric drugs, five metabolites (citalopram N-oxide, citalopram propionic 
acid, desmethylcitalopram, O-desmethylvenlafaxine, and 
10,11-epoxycarbamazepine), and seven AD/PD pharmaceuticals along with caffeine. 
Nine compounds (apomorphine, benserazide, donepezil, didemethylcitalopram, 
carbidopa, norfluoxetine, galantamine, pramipexole, and safinamide) were not 
detected. Fluoxetine was found in all samples, and caffeine had the highest 
concentration at 76,991 ng/L, reflecting its high consumption. Concentrations 
ranged from 29.8 to 656 ng/L for caffeine, <MDL to 381 ng/L for psychiatric 
drugs, and <MDL to 37.1 ng/L for AD and PD pharmaceuticals in surface water. In 
wastewater, concentrations ranged from 140 to 76,991 ng/L for caffeine, <MDL to 
5227 ng/L for psychiatric drugs, and <MDL to 206 ng/L for AD and PD 
pharmaceuticals. These findings highlight the critical need for comprehensive 
environmental monitoring.

BACKGROUND: Motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCRS) is a pre-dementia syndrome of 
growing interest, yet it remains understudied in Latin America with a 
significant lack of information on the interaction between its risk factors and 
race.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of MCRS among older adults in Brazil, 
investigate its association with various clinical and sociodemographic 
variables, and explore the potential of effect modification by race.
METHODS: This cross-sectional, population-based study was conducted among 
community-dwelling older adults in Brazil, with data collected between 2015 and 
2016. The diagnosis of MCRS was established following the standard recommended 
by the original study that first described it. We used Poisson regression models 
to analyze the association between MCRS and a list of 21 variables identified 
from a systematic review.
RESULTS: A total of 4677 participants aged 60 years and older were included. The 
prevalence of MCRS in the Brazilian population of older adults was 4.34% (95% 
CI: 3.20%-5.48%). Higher levels of education and physical activity showed 
protective associations with MCRS, while depression and stroke demonstrated risk 
associations. A significant cross-over interaction between race and depression 
regarding MCRS was observed, such that the association of depression with MCRS 
was approximately three times higher among White individuals than Black 
individuals.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results challenge previous estimates that Latin America is the 
region with the highest prevalence of MCRS among older adults and signal the 
need for further studies to better investigate the modification of effect of the 
association between depression and MCRS by race.

BACKGROUND: Depression in old age is associated with the incidence of dementia. 
However, whether a combination of somatic and psychological symptoms influences 
the risk of dementia has not been fully investigated.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the association between the combination of 
psychological and somatic symptoms of depression and the incidence of dementia.
METHODS: This prospective cohort study included 2111 community-dwelling older 
adults (median age = 73 years, interquartile range = 68-78 years, 39.5% male). 
Participants were evaluated for 5 years from baseline to assess the incidence of 
dementia. Somatic symptoms were defined as the presence of one or more symptoms 
of fatigue, weight loss, sleep disturbances, and abnormal appetite. 
Psychological symptoms were assessed using the 15-item Geriatric Depression 
Scale. Participants were stratified into four groups based on the presence or 
absence of somatic and psychological symptoms. A Cox proportional hazards model 
was used to examine the associations with the incidence of dementia, adjusted 
for potential confounders.
RESULTS: The hazard ratios for the incidence of dementia in the somatic (HR 
1.42, 95% CI: 0.96-2.09) and psychological symptoms-only groups (HR 1.47, 95% 
CI: 0.83-2.59) were not significantly different; however, they were 
significantly higher in the coexistent group than in the normal group (HR 1.91, 
95% CI: 1.24-2.94).
CONCLUSIONS: The coexistence of somatic and psychological symptoms of depression 
increases the risk of dementia. Therefore, interventions should consider both 
somatic and psychological symptoms to prevent or delay dementia.

BACKGROUND: Dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent 
neurocognitive disorder in the world and impacts the individual's cognitive 
functions and functionality in the early stages of the condition. Virtual 
reality (VR) interventions can assist in non-pharmacological treatment in a more 
ecological way, positively impacting cognitive abilities. However, there are few 
studies on VR exclusively involving people with AD in randomized controlled 
trials.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of VR intervention on the cognitive functions 
of people with AD.
METHODS: A systematically conducted search was carried out in MEDLINE, EMBASE, 
BVS, Web of Science, and Scopus. Eligible studies were randomized controlled 
trials comparing the efficacy of VR and traditional cognitive interventions in 
people with AD. Methodologic quality was assessed with the Cochrane risk of bias 
tool, and outcomes were calculated as risk ratios (for dichotomous outcomes) and 
mean differences (for continuous outcomes) with 95% confidence interval.
RESULTS: A total of three randomized controlled trials with 75 participants were 
included. An improvement in the performance of the VR group was observed in 
memory, especially when comparing the usual treatment [MD = 0.99; CI95%: 0.33; 
1.66; I2 = 0%]. VR has little or no effect on participants' executive function 
[MD = 1.36; 95%CI: -1.12; 3.85; I2 = 0%] compared to the usual treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study results cautiously suggest, despite the small number of 
participants, that VR intervention may be a suitable memory treatment for 
individuals diagnosed with AD.

BACKGROUND: Assessing consciousness might benefit the care for people with 
Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia at the end of life by indicating 
distressing symptoms and moments of awareness. This could guide symptom control 
and increase interaction with the person with dementia.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the acceptability of a biosignal 
measurement of consciousness, the Bispectral Index monitoring (BIS), for persons 
with dementia at the end of life.
METHODS: Qualitative study using focus groups and interviews with demonstrations 
of BIS monitoring, with 17 individuals with dementia and 24 family caregivers. 
Qualitative content analysis was based on the theoretical framework of 
acceptability.
RESULTS: People with dementia did not find BIS monitoring bothersome, yet 
acceptability varied across participants and situations. Family caregivers 
considered BIS acceptable for medical situations such as palliative sedation and 
pain assessment. Perceived effectiveness, ethicality, and usefulness 
considerations underpinned reasons and concerns around acceptability.
CONCLUSIONS: Potential end-users expressed diverse attitudes towards BIS 
monitoring in dementia end-of-life care. If BIS or similar technologies are to 
be implemented in the future, care must be taken to ensure that the device has 
sufficient added value, that the person with dementia and family are well 
informed, and that the technology does not replace human care. Future research 
should investigate its efficacy and feasibility in the situations that were 
deemed acceptable.

University, Tokat, Turkey.

The present study aimed to provide experimental evidence that CDELNs 
(coffee-derived exosome-like nanoparticles) may be a candidate for the treatment 
or prevention of amyloid-β (Aβ)-induced Alzheimer's disease (AD). An in vitro 
Alzheimer's model was created with Aβ-induced toxicity in mouse hippocampal 
neuronal cells (HT-22). Aβ(1-42)-exposed cells were treated with different 
concentrations of CDELNs (1-50 μg/ml) and the viability of cells was analyzed. 
The change in the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) of cells was also 
determined. CDELNs treatment increased the viability of Aβ(1-42 
)-toxicity-induced HT-22 cells significantly. The increase in the viability of 
Aβ(1-42)-toxicity-induced cells was correlated with an improvement in ΔΨm. 
CDELNs treatment restored the dissipated ΔΨm. These results suggested that 
CDELNs protect neuronal cells against Aβ(1-42)-induced neurotoxicity by 
repairing mitochondrial dysfunction. CDELNs might be a useful neuroprotective 
agent for the treatment or prevention of Aβ-induced AD. Further animal and 
clinical studies should be carried out to investigate the neuroprotective 
potential of CDELNs against Aβ-induced AD.

BackgroundDual-task function is compromised among individuals with prodromal 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and others at risk of developing AD. While exercise has 
been studied as a therapeutic candidate, the activity of social dance might 
promote dual-task rehabilitation as well or better than conventional 
exercise.ObjectiveCompare effects of social dance versus home exercise on 
dual-task function and intervention adherence among individuals with increased 
risk of developing AD: survivors of breast cancer (BC) with chemotherapy-induced 
neuropathy (CIN).MethodsFifty-two (n = 52) survivors of BC with CIN-related 
symptoms and functional deficits were randomized (1:1) to 8 weeks of biweekly 
physical activity that took the form of partnered AdapTango dance (20 min) or 
home exercise (45 min) (NCT05114005, registered 08/15/2021). Primary outcome: 
dual-task function (TUG-Cog counting backward by 3 s). Secondary outcome: 
adherence. Exploratory outcomes: participant rating of perceived exertion in 
physical versus cognitive domains and cognitive load during dual-task 
performance.ResultsBoth interventions improved Timed-Up-and-Go with cognitive 
task (TUGCog) after 4 weeks (p < 0.001); gains were maintained at 8 weeks of 
intervention (p < 0.001) and 1 month follow-up (p < 0.001). The dance 
intervention met adherence feasibility criteria for 8 weeks; exercise met 
criteria for 4 weeks. The ratio of cognitive to physical exertion was higher for 
dance (1 to 1) than exercise (0.8 to 1.0; p < 0.001). Dance, only, was 
associated with reduced cognitive load (p = 0.02).ConclusionsAmong survivors of 
BC with CIN, small doses of social dance improved dual-task function comparably 
to larger doses of home exercise, possibly due to differences in cognitive 
engagement.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) presents a significant challenge in 
healthcare, prompting exploration into non-pharmacological interventions to 
complement traditional treatments.
OBJECTIVE: This systematic review explores the efficacy of lifestyle-based 
interventions in managing AD.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of 
Science, and Scopus between 2018 and 2023, selecting randomized controlled 
trials examining factors such as exercise, diet, stress, and cognitive training 
in AD patients.
RESULTS: The review revealed physical exercise as the predominant 
non-pharmacological intervention, accompanied by dietary modifications, 
cognitive training, and therapies such as mindfulness and music. While exercise 
demonstrated improvements in quality of life, its cognitive benefits were 
limited. Modified diets, such as Atkins and ketogenic, displayed inconsistent 
effects on cognitive function but influenced other health-related parameters. 
Additionally, probiotic therapy and novel cognitive training technologies were 
explored.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite some interventions showing promise in enhancing cognitive 
function and slowing disease progression, uncertainties remain regarding the 
dose-response relationship, underlying mechanisms, and potential synergistic 
effects. Moreover, consideration of genetic and sex-based disparities is 
warranted. This synthesis underscores the need for further research to elucidate 
the nuances of non-pharmacological interventions in managing AD effectively.

Cerebral amyloid angiopathy commonly co-occurs with amyloid β plaques and 
neurofibrillary degeneration and is proposed to contribute to cognitive 
impairment. However, the interplay among these pathologic changes of Alzheimer 
disease is not well understood. Here we replicate and extend findings of a 
recent study that suggested the association of cerebral amyloid angiopathy and 
cognitive impairment is mediated by neurofibrillary degeneration. We employed 
similar approaches but in a larger, clinical-based (as opposed to 
community-based) set of 4915 autopsied National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center 
participants (60% with dementia). Neuropathologic lesions were measured 
ordinally; longitudinal change in cognition was used to measure cognitive 
impairment. Statistical analyses included ordinal logistic regression, mediation 
analyses and extension of models to include presence of APOE e4. We show a 
statistical interaction between cerebral amyloid angiopathy and neuritic plaques 
that impacts the burden of neurofibrillary tangles. Mediation analyses show that 
cerebral amyloid angiopathy is associated with cognitive impairment, but only by 
modifying the impact of neurofibrillary tangles on cognition. We expanded the 
mediation analysis to include APOE e4 and show similar results. Findings 
indicate that cerebral amyloid angiopathy plays an important role in the burden 
and impact of neurofibrillary degeneration contributing to cognitive impairment.

PURPOSE: To explore the protective effects and mechanisms of Jiawei Qifuyin on 
APP/PS1 mice, a model for Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: Network pharmacology tools were used to predict anti-AD targets and 
signaling pathways affected by Jiawei Qifuyin. In vitro studies assessed 
antioxidant and oxygen radical scavenging abilities, immune cell proliferation, 
and inflammatory cytokine levels in lipopolysaccharide-induced BV2 microglial 
cells. Cognitive ability in APP/PS1 mice was evaluated using the Morris Water 
Maze test. mRNA expression of neuroinflammatory factors, changes in intestinal 
microbiota, and short-chain fatty acid content were analyzed post-treatment.
RESULTS: Network pharmacology predicted that Jiawei Qifuyin affects AKT1, TNF-α, 
and AGE/RAGE pathways. It showed concentration-dependent antioxidant effects and 
modulated immune cell proliferation. IL-2, IL-6, and TNF-α levels in LPS-induced 
BV2 cells were significantly reduced. Treated animals exhibited improved 
cognitive performance, decreased brain amyloid-beta levels, and downregulated 
expression of IL-1β, IL-6, RAGE, and NF-κB. Significant changes in intestinal 
microbiota composition and SCFA content were observed.
CONCLUSION: Jiawei Qifuyin may enhance immunity and improve cognitive impairment 
in APP/PS1 mice through regulation of inflammatory factors, gut microbiota, and 
the gut-brain axis.

Alzheimer's disease is the most general type of cognitive impairments. Until 
recently, strategies that prevent its clinical progression have remained more 
elusive. Consequently, research direction should be for finding effective 
neuroprotective agents. It has been suggested oxidative stress, mitochondrial 
injury, and inflammation level might lead to brain cell death in many 
neurological disorders. Therefore, several autophagy-targeted bioactive 
compounds may be promising candidate therapeutics for the prevention of brain 
cell damage. Interestingly, some risk genes to Alzheimer's disease are expressed 
within brain cells, which may be linked to cholesterol metabolism, lipid 
transport, endocytosis, exocytosis and/or caveolae formation, suggesting that 
caveolae may be a fruitful therapeutic target to improve cognitive impairments. 
This review would highlight the latest advances in therapeutic technologies to 
improve the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. In particular, a paradigm that 
serotonin and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors agonist/antagonist within 
caveolae structure might possibly improve the cognitive impairment. 
Consequently, cellular membrane biophysics should improve our understanding of 
the pathology of the cognitive dysfunction associated with Alzheimer's disease. 
Here, this research direction for the purpose of therapy may open the potential 
to move a clinical care toward disease-modifying treatment strategies with 
certain benefits for patients.

INTRODUCTION: With the advent of disease-modifying therapies, accurate 
assessment of biomarkers indicating the presence of disease-associated amyloid 
beta (Aβ) pathology becomes crucial in patients with clinically suspected 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). We evaluated Aβ levels in cerebrospinal fluid (Aβ CSF) 
and Aβ levels in positron emission tomography (Aβ PET) biomarkers in a 
real-world memory-clinic setting to develop an efficient algorithm for clinical 
use.
METHODS: Patients were evaluated for AD-related Aβ pathology from two 
independent cohorts (Ludwig Maximilian University [LMU], n = 402, and Medical 
University of Vienna [MUV], n = 144). Optimal thresholds of CSF biomarkers were 
deduced from receiver operating characteristic curves and validated against Aβ 
PET positivity.
RESULTS: In both cohorts, a CSF Aβ42/40 ratio ≥ 7.1% was associated with a low 
risk of a positive Aβ PET scan (negative predictive value: 94.3%). Implementing 
two cutoffs revealed 14% to 16% of patients with intermediate results (CSF 
Aβ42/40 ratio: 5.5%-7.1%), which had a strong benefit from Aβ PET imaging 
(44%-52% Aβ PET positivity).
DISCUSSION: A two-cutoff approach for CSF Aβ42/40 including Aβ PET imaging at 
intermediate results provides an effective assessment of Aβ pathology in 
real-world settings.
HIGHLIGHTS: We evaluated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and positron emission 
tomography (PET) amyloid beta (Aβ) biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease in 
real-world cohorts.A CSF Aβ 42/40 ratio between 5.5% and 7.1% defines patients 
at borderline levels.Patients at borderline levels strongly benefit from 
additional Aβ PET imaging.Two-cutoff CSF Aβ 42/40 and PET will allow effective 
treatment stratification.

INTRODUCTION: Characterizing pathological changes in the brain that underlie 
cognitive impairment, including Alzheimer's disease and related disorders, is 
central to clinical concerns of prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.
METHODS: We describe the properties of a brain gray matter region ("Union 
Signature") that is derived from four behavior-specific, data-driven signatures 
in a discovery cohort.
RESULTS: In a separate validation set, the Union Signature demonstrates 
clinically relevant properties. Its associations with episodic memory, executive 
function, and Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes are stronger than those of 
several standardly accepted brain measures (e.g., hippocampal volume, cortical 
gray matter) and other previously developed brain signatures. The ability of the 
Union Signature to classify clinical syndromes among normal, mild cognitive 
impairment, and dementia exceeds that of the other measures.
DISCUSSION: The Union Signature is a powerful, multipurpose correlate of 
clinically relevant outcomes and a strong classifier of clinical syndromes.
HIGHLIGHTS: Data-driven brain signatures are potentially valuable in models of 
cognitive aging.In previous work, we outlined rigorous validation of signatures 
for memory.This work demonstrates a signature predicting multiple clinical 
measures.This could be useful in models of interventions for brain support of 
cognition.

INTRODUCTION: Plasma phosphorylated tau-217 (p-tau217) and neurofilament light 
(NfL) can differentiate between different dementias in selected cohorts. We aim 
to test the discrimination potential of these markers in a real-world cohort.
METHODS: We measured p-tau217 (ALZpath) and NfL (Quanterix) in 415 (unselected) 
consecutive memory clinic patients. Biomarker levels were dichotomized as 
low/high to create four biomarker profiles based on p-tau217 and NfL levels.
RESULTS: p-Tau217 levels were highest in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
dementia, whereas NfL levels were highest in patients with frontotemporal 
dementia (FTD). Low p-tau217/low NfL was associated mostly with non-neurological 
diagnoses (79%), and high p-tau217/low NfL indicated AD pathology at any stage 
(84%). Low p-tau217/high NfL indicated FTD (38%) and high p-tau217/high NfL 
indicated AD dementia (87%).
DISCUSSION: p-Tau217 can identify AD pathology at any disease stage. NfL can 
differentiate FTD from other diagnoses (e.g., AD dementia). Plasma p-tau217 and 
NfL can support clinical decision-making, and we suggest using them as 
complements to standard clinical assessment.
HIGHLIGHTS: Phosphorylated tau-2017 (p-tau217) can detect Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) across the clinical continuum.Neurofilament light (NfL) can differentiate 
frontotemporal dementia (FTD) from other diagnoses (AD dementia, dementia with 
Lewy bodies [DLB], and Psychiatry).p-Tau217 may detect AD co-pathology in other 
diseases or dementia types (e.g., DLB).p-Tau217 and NfL show potential for 
clinical implementation.

INTRODUCTION: Both micro- and macrostructural white matter (WM) abnormalities, 
particularly those related to axonal degeneration, are associated with cognitive 
decline in adults with Down syndrome (DS) prior to a diagnosis of Alzheimer 
disease. Neurofilament light chain (NfL) is a support protein within myelinated 
axons released into blood following axonal damage. In this study we investigated 
cross-sectional relationships between WM microstructural changes as measured by 
diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and plasma NfL concentration in adults with DS 
without dementia.
METHODS: Thirty cognitively stable (CS) adults with DS underwent 
diffusion-weighted MRI scanning and plasma NfL measurement. DTI measures of 
select WM tracts were derived using automatic fiber tracking, and associations 
with plasma NfL were assessed using Spearman correlation coefficients.
RESULTS: Higher Plasma NfL was associated with greater altered diffusion 
measures of select tracts.
DISCUSSION: Early increases in plasma NfL may reflect early white matter 
microstructural changes prior to dementia in DS.
HIGHLIGHTS: The onset of such WM changes in DS has not yet been widely 
studied.WM microstructural properties correlated with plasma neurofilament light 
chain (NfL).NfL may reflect early, selective WM changes in adults with DS at 
high risk of developing AD.

BACKGROUND: Recent advancements in Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarker research 
and clinical trials prompt reflection on the value and consequently appropriate 
use of tau positron emission tomography (tau-PET) in the future.
METHODS: We conducted an online survey among dementia and PET experts worldwide 
to investigate the anticipated future role of tau-PET in clinical practice and 
trials.
RESULTS: Two hundred sixty-eight dementia experts, comprising 143 clinicians and 
121 researchers, covering six continents participated. The vast majority (90%) 
fostered a positive attitude toward the added value of tau-PET in clinical 
practice, particularly for staging, diagnosing, monitoring, and prognostication 
in a cognitively impaired memory clinic population. Experts anticipated an 
important role for tau-PET for participant selection (76%-100%) and measuring 
endpoints (75%-97%), in both anti-amyloid and anti-tau drug trials.
DISCUSSION: Our global survey study shows that dementia experts envision an 
important role for tau-PET in the future, both in clinical practice and in drug 
trials, beyond current guidelines and practices.
HIGHLIGHTS: Dementia experts envision an important role for tau-PET in the 
future.Experts indicate that a tau-PET scan could influence patient 
management.Experts anticipate the utility of tau-PET for participant selection 
and endpoints in drug trials.There is a gap between the anticipated usefulness 
of tau-PET and current clinical practices.

Molecules in Neurodegenerative Diseases.

The identification of protective agents for the treatment of neurodegenerative 
diseases is the mainstay therapeutic goal to modify the disease course and 
arrest the irreversible disability progression. Pharmacological therapies 
synergistically targeting multiple pathogenic pathways, including oxidative 
stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammation, are prime candidates for 
neuroprotection. Combination or synergistic therapy with melatonin, whose 
decline correlates with altered sleep/wake cycle and impaired glymphatic "waste 
clearance" system in neurodegenerative diseases, has a great therapeutic 
potential to treat inflammatory neurodegenerative states. Despite the protective 
outcomes observed in preclinical studies, mild or poor outcomes were observed in 
clinical settings, suggesting that melatonin combinations promoting synergistic 
actions at appropriate doses might be more suitable to treat multifactorial 
neurodegenerative disorders. In this review, we first summarize the key 
melatonin actions and pathways contributing to cell protection and its 
therapeutic implication in Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), 
and multiple sclerosis (MS). We remark the major controversies in the field, 
mostly generated by the lack of a common consensus for the optimal dosing, 
molecular targets, and toxicity. Then, we review the literature investigating 
the efficacy of melatonin combinations with approved or investigational 
neuroprotective agents and of melatonin-containing hybrid molecules, both in 
vitro and in animal models of AD, PD, and MS, as well as the efficacy of add-on 
melatonin in clinical settings. We highlight the rationale for such melatonin 
combinations with a focus on the comparison with single-agent treatment and on 
the assays in which an additive or a synergistic effect has been achieved. We 
conclude that a better characterization of the mechanisms underlying such 
melatonin synergistic actions under neuroinflammation at appropriate doses needs 
to be tackled to advance successful clinical translation of neuroprotective 
melatonin combination therapies or melatonin-based hybrid molecules.

Suffruticosol B from Paeonia lactiflora Ameliorates Alzheimer's Disease 
Pathology by Inhibiting MAO-B Activity.

Monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) has emerged as a therapeutic target for Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) due to its involvement in the synthesis of γ-aminobutyric acid 
(GABA) in reactive astrocytes, which inhibits neuronal activity. Suffruticosol B 
(Suf-B), isolated from Paeonia lactiflora, is one of the resveratrol oligomers. 
Although resveratrol oligomers have demonstrated neuroprotective effects, it 
remains unexplored whether Suf-B exerts therapeutic effects on AD by targeting 
MAO-B. In this study, we investigated whether Suf-B alleviates AD pathology by 
mitigating reactive astrogliosis and inhibiting the overproduction of astrocytic 
GABA. After confirming the MAO-B inhibitory effect of Suf-B through MAO-B enzyme 
assay, we administered Suf-B to APP/PS1 AD model mice. To test the potential 
therapeutic action of Suf-B in AD, a series of experiments were conducted, 
including behavioral tests such as the open field test, novel object recognition 
test, Barnes maze test, passive avoidance test, as well as immunohistochemistry 
and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. We found that Suf-B markedly inhibited 
MAO-B activity without causing cytotoxicity. Immunohistochemistry and 
electrophysiology experiments demonstrated that Suf-B significantly reduced 
astrocyte reactivity, as well as an aberrant increase in GABA production and 
tonic GABA release from astrocytes in AD. Behavior test results indicated that 
Suf-B treatment restored cognitive function in APP/PS1 mice. In conclusion, 
Suf-B effectively reduces excessive GABA production in reactive astrocytes by 
inhibiting MAO-B, normalizing aberrant inhibition in hippocampal neurons in an 
AD mouse model. These results suggest that Suf-B has potential as a treatment 
for AD and may be applicable to other brain diseases associated with reactive 
astrogliosis.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of age-related dementia. In AD, 
the death of neurons in the central nervous system is associated with the 
accumulation of toxic amyloid β peptide (Aβ) and mitochondrial dysfunction. 
Mitochondria are signal transducers of metabolic and biochemical information, 
and their impairment can compromise cellular function. Mitochondria 
compartmentalise several pathways, including folate-dependent one-carbon (1C) 
metabolism and electron transport by respiratory complexes. Mitochondrial 1C 
metabolism is linked to electron transport through complex I of the respiratory 
chain. Here, we analysed the proteomic changes in a fly model of AD by 
overexpressing a toxic form of Aβ (Aβ-Arc). We found that expressing Aβ-Arc 
caused alterations in components of both complex I and mitochondrial 1C 
metabolism. Genetically enhancing mitochondrial 1C metabolism through Nmdmc 
improved mitochondrial function and was neuroprotective in fly models of AD. We 
also found that exogenous supplementation with the 1C donor folinic acid 
improved mitochondrial health in both mammalian cells and fly models of AD. We 
found that genetic variations in MTHFD2L, the human orthologue of Nmdmc, were 
linked to AD risk. Additionally, Mendelian randomisation showed that increased 
folate intake decreased the risk of developing AD. Overall, our data suggest 
enhancement of folate-dependent 1C metabolism as a viable strategy to delay the 
progression and attenuate the severity of AD.

Induced neural stem cells (iNSCs), which have similar properties to neural stem 
cells and are able to self-proliferate and differentiate into neural cell 
lineages, are expected to be potential cells for the treatment of 
neurodegeneration disease. However, cell therapy based on iNSCs transplantation 
is limited by the inability to acquire sufficient quantities of iNSCs. Previous 
studies have found that mouse and human fibroblasts can be directly reprogrammed 
into iNSCs with a single factor, Sox2. Here, we induced mouse embryonic 
fibroblasts (MEFs) into iNSCs by combining valproic acid (VPA) with the 
induction factor Sox2, and the results showed that VPA significantly improved 
the conversion efficiency of fibroblasts to iNSCs. The iNSCs exhibited typical 
neurosphere-like structures that can express NSCs markers, such as Sox2, Nestin, 
Sox1, and Zbtb16, and could differentiate into neurons, astrocytes, and 
oligodendrocytes in vitro. Subsequently, the iNSCs were stereotactically 
transplanted into the hippocampus of APP/PS1 double transgenic mice (AD mice). 
Post-transplantation, the iNSCs showed long-term survival, migrated over long 
distances, and differentiated into multiple types of functional neurons and 
glial cells in vivo. Importantly, the cognitive abilities of APP/PS1 mice 
transplanted with iNSCs exhibited significant functional recovery. These 
findings suggest that VPA enhances the conversion efficiency of fibroblasts into 
iNSCs when used in combination with Sox2, and iNSCs hold promise as a potential 
donor material for transplantation therapy in Alzheimer's disease.

Ramalin, a strong antioxidant isolated from Antarctic lichens, has been shown to 
have potential therapeutic effects in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. 
However, this compound is readily degraded in aqueous solutions, which restricts 
its development as a therapeutic agent. With a view toward addressing this 
problem, in this study, we modified the structure of ramalin to obtain more 
stable compounds and attempted to identify a derivative with the strongest 
neuroprotective properties. We synthesized a total of 20 ramalin derivatives, 
among which, RA-2 N was demonstrated to have the best neuroprotective effects, 
not only inhibiting inflammation in BV2 cells but also inhibiting 
inflammation-induced HT22 cell apoptosis in BV2-HT22 co-culture models. 
Moreover, we established that these effects were associated with an inhibition 
of the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB). Our findings in 
this study revealed that the synthesis of ramalin derivatives is an effective 
approach for stabilizing this compound for therapeutic purposes. Given its 
modified structure, the RA-2 N derivative can inhibit inflammation and protect 
nerve cells, and thus indicate its potential application as a drug for treating 
neurodegenerative diseases.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently approved lecanemab and 
donanemab for the treatment of early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease (AD) after 
their phase III trials reached endpoints. These two anti-amyloid β monoclonal 
antibodies represent the latest promise of disease-modifying therapy (DMT) for 
AD, which undoubtedly reignites new hope for DMTs to combat the staggering 
financial and human costs of AD. However, in addition to these two successful 
antibodies, there have been enormous efforts to develop DMTs in various aspects 
to meet the therapeutic requirement of AD. In this review, we delineate the core 
principles and methodologies of diverse DMTs, covering the advances in clinical 
trials of drug candidates that either have been discontinued, completed, or are 
ongoing, as well as brain stimulation and lifestyle interventions. In addition, 
by overseeing the fate of various candidate molecules, we hope to provide 
references and ideas for prospective approaches and promising applications of 
DTMs for AD, particularly in terms of universality and clinical application 
economics, to optimize efficacy and maximize AD patient benefits in the future.

Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a common complication with no 
effective treatment in elderly patients. POCD, Alzheimer disease (AD), and many 
other cognitive diseases mostly involve neurotoxic microglia response, and 
recently, β2-microglobulin (B2M) has been suggested to play a pivotal role. A 
novel pyromeconic acid-styrene hybrid compound D30 was synthesized by our team 
and shown to be safe and effective in some neurodegenerative mouse models. In 
this study, we evaluated D30 on POCD and its potential mechanism. Fourteen- to 
18-month-old male C57BL/6 mice were used to establish POCD through isoflurane 
anesthesia and surgery. The plasma of elderly patients was collected pre- and 
postoperatively. Primary mouse microglia were subjected to various stimulations 
in multiple experimental designs to imitate in vivo POCD-like conditions. Morris 
water maze, fear conditioning, western blot, immunofluorescent staining, and 
blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability tests were conducted in this study. D30 
administration significantly improved learning and memory in aged mice following 
POCD. Neurotoxic M1 microglia cells were dramatically increased following POCD, 
manifested as morphologically changing into fewer and shorter branches, enlarged 
somatic areas, and upregulated expression of iNOS and C1q. Notably, following 
POCD, B2M was significantly upregulated in the plasma and the brain. D30 
treatment significantly suppressed these pathologic changes, by inhibiting the 
POCD-induced BBB breakdown while suppressing the surge of plasma B2M levels. D30 
treatment suppressed POCD-induced surge of B2M and Aβ plaques in the brain and 
preserved adult hippocampal neurogenesis vulnerable to POCD. Furthermore, 
postoperative levels of B2M were significantly elevated over the preoperative 
levels in patients aged 80 years and over. In parallel with mouse plasma after 
POCD, the postoperative patient plasma was also much more effective at 
activating M1 microglia. Of note, this POCD plasma-induced activation of M1 
microglia was largely prevented by D30 treatment. Taken together, by inhibiting 
the surge of plasma B2M, protecting BBB integrity, and reducing inflammatory 
response, D30 protected aged mice from B2M-facilitated POCD.

OBJECTIVE: Exercise exerts protective effects against Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
However, the factors and mechanisms underlying these effects remain largely 
unknown. This study aims to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which exercise 
exerts its protective effects against AD.
METHODS: Male 7-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly allocated to four 
groups (n = 10 per group): control (CON), exercise control (EXE), sedentary AD 
model induced by intracerebroventricular streptozotocin (STZ) injection, and AD 
model with treadmill exercise (EXE + STZ). The exercise groups underwent a 
13-week treadmill exercise. An intracerebroventricular injection of STZ was used 
to induce a rat model of AD. The Barnes maze task was employed as an assessment 
of spatial learning and memory. Hippocampal tissues from three rats per group 
was collected for proteomic analysis. Immunofluorescence staining, western blot 
analysis and polymerase chain reaction were performed for the evaluation of Aβ 
production, tau hyperphosphorylation, differential protein and corresponding 
signaling pathway.
RESULTS: Treadmill exercise could significantly improve STZ-induced cognitive 
dysfunction and provide neuroprotection by reducing Aβ deposition and tau 
hyperphosphorylation. Proteomic analysis and further studies demonstrated that 
treadmill training could significantly increase the expression of tripartite 
motif-containing 9 (TRIM9). Subsequent research indicated that the upregulation 
of TRIM9 maybe due, in part,to the inhibition of the NF-κB pathway, thereby 
reducing the pro-inflammatory factor, and exerting an anti-inflammatory effect.
CONCLUSIONS: Treadmill exercise attenuates cognitive decline in AD models by 
upregulating TRIM9 expression, which in turn inhibits NF-κB-mediated 
neuroinflammation. These findings suggest that TRIM9 may serve as a potential 
therapeutic target for immunomodulatory strategies against AD.

Donepezil has traditionally been used in Alzheimer's disease treatment and is 
known for its ability to alleviate neural inflammation and apoptosis. However, 
its impact on insulin signaling remains unexplored. This study sought to 
elucidate the novel role of donepezil in mitigating skeletal muscle insulin 
resistance under hyperlipidemic conditions. Western blot analysis was used to 
assess the expression of various proteins of interest, whereas a glucose uptake 
assay was performed in skeletal muscle cells via commercially available kits. An 
in vitro model of obesity was developed using palmitate. These in vitro findings 
were corroborated in vivo via insulin resistance models established through 
high-fat diet (HFD) feeding in mice. Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests and 
insulin tolerance tests were performed on the experimental mice. The results 
revealed that donepezil treatment improved insulin signaling and inflammation in 
palmitate-treated C2C12 myocytes and the skeletal muscle of HFD-fed mice. 
Notably, donepezil treatment augmented FGF21 expression and AMPK phosphorylation 
in the myocytes and skeletal muscle of HFD-fed mice. Knockdown of FGF21 or AMPK 
via siRNA reversed the effects of donepezil on insulin signaling and 
inflammation in cultured myocytes. We also found that donepezil ameliorated 
skeletal muscle insulin resistance via the FGF21-mediated suppression of 
ferroptosis under hyperlipidemic conditions. These findings suggest that 
donepezil enhances the FGF21/AMPK axis, thereby mitigating inflammation and 
insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. This study introduces a novel therapeutic 
approach for treating Alzheimer's disease patients with insulin resistance.

Lecanemab, brand name Leqembi, is a monoclonal antibody that targets amyloid 
beta (Aβ) aggregates for the treatment of Alzheimer disease (AD) (1). It is 
approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for individuals with mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild dementia stage AD with confirmed amyloid 
pathology (1). Tests to confirm Aβ pathology in the clinical trials included 
positron emission tomography (PET) or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measurement of 
the Aβ42/Total Tau ratio (2). This disease-modifying medication is based on the 
amyloid cascade hypothesis, which suggests Aβ aggregates are a key driver in AD 
pathogenesis and that the removal of Aβ aggregates should slow cognitive 
decline. Lecanemab is associated with amyloid-related imaging abnormalities 
(ARIA) due to edema (ARIA-E) or hemorrhage (ARIA-H) from blood vessels in the 
brain (3, 4). Individuals who have one or 2 copies of the AD risk-associated 
apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 (NM_000041.4:c.388T>C) allele have an increased risk 
of ARIA-E or -H (1) (Table 1). These individuals require additional monitoring 
during the first year of treatment (5). The FDA-approved label reports that 
concomitant antithrombotic medication (aspirin, antiplatelet, or anticoagulant) 
with lecanemab therapy resulted in intracerebral hemorrhage in 2.5% of 
individuals during clinical trials (1). The appropriate use recommendations from 
the Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Therapeutics Work Group state that 
individuals requiring anticoagulants should not be treated with lecanemab until 
additional data regarding this interaction are available (5). Both the 
FDA-approved label and Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Therapeutics 
Work group encourage clinicians to consider participation in a registry for AD 
treatment to gather additional real-world data on lecanemab therapy (1, 5).

BACKGROUND: The spread of tau pathology closely correlates with the disease 
course and cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Tau-targeting 
immunotherapies are being developed to stop the spread of tau pathology and thus 
halt disease progression. In this post hoc analysis of the ADAMANT clinical 
trial, we examined the performance of AADvac1, an active immunotherapy targeting 
the microtubule-binding region (MTBR) of tau, in a subgroup of participants with 
elevated plasma p-tau217, indicating AD-related neuropathological changes.
METHODS: ADAMANT was a 24-month, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 
double-blinded, multicenter, phase 2 clinical trial in subjects with mild AD. 
The trial participants were randomized 3:2 to receive six doses of AADvac1 or 
placebo at 4-week intervals, followed by five booster doses at 14-week 
intervals. The primary outcome was safety. The secondary outcomes were the 
Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), the Alzheimer's Disease 
Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily Living score for Mild Cognitive 
Impairment 18-item version (ADCS-ADL-MCI-18), and immunogenicity. Volumetric 
MRI, plasma neurofilament light (NfL), and glial fibrillary acidic protein 
(GFAP) were exploratory outcomes. The inclusion criterion for this post-hoc 
analysis was a baseline plasma p-tau217 level above the cutoff for AD.
RESULTS: Among 196 ADAMANT participants, 137 were positive for plasma p-tau217 
(mean age 71.4 years, 59% women). AADvac1 was safe and well tolerated in this 
subgroup. AADvac1 reduced the rate of accumulation of log-plasma NfL by 56% and 
that of GFAP by 73%. The treatment differences in the CDR-SB and ADCS-ADL-MCI-18 
scores favored AADvac1 but were not statistically significant. AADvac1 had no 
effect on whole-brain volume but nonsignificantly reduced the loss of brain 
cortical tissue in several regions. Importantly, the impact on the study 
outcomes was more pronounced in participants with higher anti-tau antibody 
levels.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that AADvac1 tau immunotherapy can reduce 
plasma biomarkers of neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. These findings and 
possible observations on brain atrophy and cognition are hypothesis-generating 
and warrant further evaluation in a larger clinical trial.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is physiopathologically marked by an accumulation of 
beta-amyloid peptide (Aβ), hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, inflammation, 
and oxidative stress in the brain tissue. While new drugs for AD have been 
approved, novel treatments are still needed. Eplingiella fruticosa (EF) has 
demonstrated anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, which may be 
beneficial against AD. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of EF leaf 
essential oil complexed with β-cyclodextrin in a sporadic AD model induced by 
streptozotocin (STZ). Male Wistar rats (5-6 months old) received an 
intracerebroventricular STZ injection (3 mg/kg) or vehicle, and were orally 
treated with vehicle, EF (5 mg/kg), or donepezil (5 mg/kg) for 14 days. 
Behavioral tests included olfactory discrimination, open field, novel object 
recognition, sucrose preference, and spontaneous alternation. Upon completion, 
rats were euthanatized, and their brains were analyzed for Aβ, tau, and IL-1β 
via immunohistochemistry, and for oxidative stress markers. STZ-treated rats 
showed memory deficits and anhedonia, accompanied by increased Aβ, tau, and 
IL-1β immunoreactivity in the olfactory bulb, cortex, hippocampus, and increased 
TBARS levels in the hippocampus. On the other hand, EF treatment improved 
short-term and working memory (p < 0.001), and reduced depressive-like behavior 
(p = 0.02). Additionally, EF treatment decreased Aβ, tau, and IL-1β 
immunoreactivity in the olfactory bulb, hippocampus and cortex (p < 0.05), and 
reduced TBARS levels (p = 0.04) and total oxidant status in the hippocampus 
(p = 0.03), and increased total antioxidant status in the cortex (p = 0.04). 
These findings suggest EF has neuroprotective effects against STZ-induced 
damage, indicating its potential as a novel compound for AD treatment.

To propose new mechanism-based therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease (AD), it is 
crucial to study the kinetics and oligomerization/aggregation mechanisms of the 
hallmark tau proteins, which have various isoforms and are intrinsically 
disordered. In this study, multiple all-atom (AA) and coarse-grained (CG) force 
fields (FFs) have been benchmarked on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of K18 
tau (M243-E372), which is a truncated form (130 residues) of full-length tau 
(441 residues). FF19SB is first excluded because the dynamics are too slow, and 
the conformations are too stable. All other benchmarked AAFFs (Charmm36m, 
FF14SB, Gromos54A7, and OPLS-AA) and CGFFs (Martini3 and Sirah2.0) exhibit a 
trend of shrinking K18 tau into compact structures with the radius of gyration 
(ROG) around 2.0 nm, which is much smaller than the experimental value of 3.8 
nm, within 200 ns of AA-MD or 2000 ns of CG-MD. Gromos54A7, OPLS-AA, and 
Martini3 shrink much faster than the other FFs. To perform meaningful 
postanalysis of various properties, we propose a strategy of selecting snapshots 
with 2.5 < ROG < 4.5 nm, instead of using all sampled snapshots. The calculated 
chemical shifts of all C, CA, and CB atoms have very good and close 
root-mean-square error (RMSE) values, while Charmm36m and Sirah2.0 exhibit 
better chemical shifts of N than other FFs. Comparing the calculated 
distributions of the distance between the CA atoms of CYS291 and CYS322 with the 
results of the FRET experiment demonstrates that Charmm36m is a perfect match 
with the experiment while other FFs exhibit limitations. In summary, Charmm36m 
is recommended as the best AAFF, and Sirah2.0 is recommended as an excellent 
CGFF for simulating tau K18.

BACKGROUND: Anterior controllable antedisplacement and fusion (ACAF) is an 
emerging surgical approach for treating cervical ossification of the posterior 
longitudinal ligament (C-OPLL), yet there is limited data on its long-term 
efficacy and safety. The present study aimed to analyze the short- and long-term 
postoperative clinical and radiological outcomes and perioperative complications 
of ACAF for patients with C-OPLL.
METHODS: This was a single-center, retrospective, cohort study, with the mean 
duration of follow-up of at least 24 months. A total of 111 patients with C-OPLL 
in our institution from June 2017 to June 2019 were assessed preoperatively and 
at 3 days, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. The primary outcome was the 
recovery of neurological function, measured with the Japanese Orthopedic 
Association (JOA) score. The secondary outcomes included pain, Cobb angle, 
spinal canal invasion rate, and surgery-related complications.
RESULTS: The postoperative JOA score at each follow-up was significantly better 
than the preoperative JOA score, regardless of preoperative spinal canal 
invasion rate, K-line, and segment length. The visual analog scale (VAS) score 
also decreased dramatically 3 days after surgery and was maintained at a low 
level throughout the follow-up period. Improvements in Cobb angle and invasion 
rate were observed right after the operation and were maintained for 2 years 
thereafter.
CONCLUSIONS: ACAF could achieve satisfactory recovery of neurological function 
in C-OPLL patients during a follow-up of 24 months, regardless of preoperative 
spinal canal invasion rate, preoperative K-line, or surgical segment length.

BACKGROUND: Older adults commonly experience chronic medical conditions and are 
at risk of cognitive impairment as a result of age, chronic comorbidity, and 
medications prescribed to manage multiple chronic conditions. Anticholinergic 
medications are common treatments for chronic conditions and have been 
repeatedly associated with poor cognitive outcomes, including delirium and 
dementia, in epidemiologic studies. However, no study has definitively evaluated 
the causal relationship between anticholinergics and cognition in a randomized 
controlled trial design. Utilizing our prior experience in deprescribing 
anticholinergic medications in various clinical environments, we designed an 
outpatient deprescribing intervention to prospectively test the potential causal 
relationship between anticholinergics and cognition in primary care older 
adults.
METHODS: This cluster randomized clinical trial will be conducted to evaluate 
the impact of an anticholinergic deprescribing intervention compared to usual 
care on outcomes of cognition and safety in primary care older adults. 
Participants will include those aged 65 years and over, receiving primary care 
in the greater Indianapolis area, using a strong anticholinergic within the last 
2 weeks or with evidence of high-risk exposure in the past year. Those excluded 
will have a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease or related dementia, or serious 
mental illness. The trial plans to enroll 344 participants who will be 
cluster-randomized at the level of primary care physician to avoid 
contamination. Participants will complete outcome assessments every 6 months up 
to 2 years by blinded outcome assessors. The primary outcome of the study is a 
composite measure of cognition that includes domains assessing executive 
cognitive function, language, and memory. Secondary outcomes include 
patient-reported measures of pain intensity, depression, anxiety, sleep 
disturbance, and health-related quality of life.
DISCUSSION: The R2D2 trial will be the largest and longest prospective 
randomized trial testing the impact of an anticholinergic-specific deprescribing 
intervention on cognition in primary care older adults. Results could influence 
deprescribing methodology and provide new insight on the relationship between 
anticholinergics and cognition.

The inflammatory processes that drive pathologies of the central nervous system 
(CNS) are complex and involve significant contributions from the immune system, 
particularly myeloid cells. Understanding the shared and distinct pathways of 
myeloid cell regulation in different CNS diseases may offer critical insights 
into therapeutic development. This review aims to elucidate the mechanisms 
underlying myeloid cell dysfunction and neuroinflammation in two groups of 
neurological pathologies with significant social impact and a limited efficacy 
of their treatments: the most common primary brain tumors -gliomas-, and the 
most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders -Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. 
Despite their distinct clinical manifestations, these diseases share key 
pathological features, including chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation. 
The role of myeloid cells in neuroinflammation has garnered special interest in 
recent years in both groups, as evidenced by the growing focus on therapeutic 
research centred on myeloid cells. By examining the cellular and molecular 
dynamics that govern these conditions, we hope to identify common and unique 
therapeutic targets that can inform the development of more effective 
treatments. Recent advances in single-cell technologies have revolutionized our 
understanding of myeloid cell heterogeneity, revealing diverse phenotypes and 
molecular profiles across different disease stages and microenvironments. Here, 
we present a comprehensive analysis of myeloid cell involvement in gliomas, 
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, with a focus on phenotypic acquisition, 
molecular alterations, and therapeutic strategies targeting myeloid cells. This 
integrated approach not only addresses the limitations of current treatments but 
also suggests new avenues for therapeutic intervention, aimed at modulating the 
immune landscape to improve patient outcomes.

Brain region- and cell-specific transcriptomic and epigenomic features are 
associated with heritability for neuropsychiatric traits, but a systematic view, 
considering cortical and subcortical regions, is lacking. Here, we provide an 
atlas of chromatin accessibility and gene expression profiles in neuronal and 
non-neuronal nuclei across 25 distinct human cortical and subcortical brain 
regions from 6 neurotypical controls. We identified extensive gene expression 
and chromatin accessibility differences across brain regions, including 
variation in alternative promoter-isoform usage and enhancer-promoter 
interactions. Genes with distinct promoter-isoform usage across brain regions 
were strongly enriched for neuropsychiatric disease risk variants. Moreover, we 
built enhancer-promoter interactions at promoter-isoform resolution across 
different brain regions and highlighted the contribution of brain 
region-specific and promoter-isoform-specific regulation to neuropsychiatric 
disorders. Including promoter-isoform resolution uncovers additional distal 
elements implicated in the heritability of diseases, thereby increasing the 
power to fine-map risk genes. Our results provide a valuable resource for 
studying molecular regulation across multiple regions of the human brain and 
underscore the importance of considering isoform information in gene regulation.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease and other dementia have a higher incidence 
among women and that risk factors specific to the female sex could be involved. 
Few studies looked into female reproductive factors and their association with 
dementia in low-and middle-income countries.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed the baseline data from the Brazilian 
Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil) and included data from 2594 women aged 
60 years and older. We used an algorithm approach to determine dementia status 
and performed logistic regressions using as predictors the self-reported total 
length of the reproductive period, total parity and use of hormonal replacement 
therapy. We also analyzed the effects of hormonal replacement therapy use for 
different age groups and the effects of number of living children.
RESULTS: Reproductive period length, hormonal replacement therapy use and parity 
as a continuous measure were not significantly associated with dementia status. 
When compared with 0 births, the group with 5-8 had more dementia while the 
other groups displayed no differences. For the number of living children, but a 
higher occurrence of dementia was found among women with more children.
CONCLUSIONS: We did not find any association between continuous parity, 
reproductive period length or hormonal replacement therapy use and dementia. 
Social factors of motherhood appear to play an important role, and group 
specific effects of parity and hormonal replacement therapy require further 
study.

Alzheimer's disease was induced in female Wistar rats by bilateral injection of 
β-amyloid fragment 1-42 into the hippocampal region. After 8 weeks, ensheathing 
cells of the olfactory mucosa were transplanted into the hippocampus at the same 
stereotactic coordinates. These cells survived for 8 weeks; large clusters of 
cells were observed on week 4. On weeks 3-5 after transplantation of ensheathing 
cells, experimental animals demonstrated a significant cognitive improvement 
(memory and spatial orientation). The obtained results create prerequisites for 
further studies of ensheathing cells as a potential cell product for 
personalized therapy of Alzheimer's disease.

BACKGROUND: Dementia is a leading cause of global death and disability. 
High-quality data describing dementia prevalence and burden remain scarce in 
sub-Saharan Africa. Health and Aging in Africa: A Longitudinal Study in South 
Africa (HAALSI) fills evidence gaps with longitudinal data on cognition, 
biomarkers, and everyday function in a population-based cohort of Black South 
Africans, aged 40 years and older, in a rural subdistrict. This study uses 
consensus diagnoses and prediction algorithms to estimate dementia prevalence.
METHODS: Data were from eligible HAALSI Wave 2 respondents aged 50 years or 
older (n=3662) and were collected between September, 2019, and January, 2020. An 
enriched sub-cohort (ie, including a high proportion of individuals with 
cognitive impairment; n=632) completed a battery of rigorous neuropsychological 
and clinical assessments and received expert classification of cognitively 
unimpaired, mild cognitive impairment, or dementia. Logistic regression was used 
to predict dementia status within the sub-cohort using predictor variables from 
the parent HAALSI wave. Coefficients were applied to the parent cohort to obtain 
dementia probability scores and calculate dementia prevalence. Optimal 
probability cut points to classify individual cases were selected for each 
model.
FINDINGS: When the sub-cohort was reweighted to reflect the full HAALSI 
population, the estimated prevalence of dementia was 18% (95% CI 15-22), with 
steep age gradients. Four models of increasing complexity showed good 
discrimination between dementia and non-dementia (area under receiver operating 
characteristic curves 0·78-0·84; classification accuracy 74-81%). Model-based 
dementia prevalence estimates aligned closely with weighted prevalence; model 
performance was consistent in cross-validated datasets.
INTERPRETATION: HAALSI is among the first studies to use algorithmic methods to 
describe dementia prevalence in a population-based sample in South Africa. These 
efforts could provide a foundation to expand understanding of dementia 
epidemiology in a region of the world experiencing rapid population ageing.

BACKGROUND: The pathological hallmarks of multiple system atrophy and 
Parkinson's disease are, respectively, misfolded-α-synuclein-laden glial 
cytoplasmic inclusions and Lewy bodies. CSF-soluble misfolded α-synuclein 
aggregates (seeds) are readily detected in people with Parkinson's disease by 
α-synuclein seed amplification assay (synSAA), but identification of seeds 
associated with multiple system atrophy for diagnostic purposes has proven 
elusive. We aimed to assess whether a novel synSAA could reliably distinguish 
seeds from Lewy bodies and glial cytoplasmic inclusions.
METHODS: In this multicentre cohort study, a novel synSAA that multiplies and 
detects seeds by fluorescence was used to analyse masked CSF and brain samples 
from participants with either clinically diagnosed or pathology-confirmed 
multiple system atrophy, Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, 
isolated rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (IRBD), disorders that were 
not synucleinopathies, or healthy controls. Participants were from eight 
available cohorts from seven medical centres in four countries: New York Brain 
Bank, New York, USA (NYBB); University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA 
(UPENN); Paracelsus-Elena-Klinik, Kassel, Germany (DeNoPa and KAMSA); Hospital 
Clinic Barcelona, Spain (BARMSA); Universität Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany 
(EKUT); Göteborgs Universitet, Göteborgs, Sweden (UGOT); and Karolinska 
Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden (KIMSA). Clinical cohorts were classified for 
expected diagnostic accuracy as either research (longitudinal follow-up visits) 
or real-life (single visit). Sensitivity and specificity were estimated 
according to pathological (gold standard) and clinical (reference standard) 
diagnoses.
FINDINGS: In 23 brain samples (from the NYBB cohort), those containing Lewy 
bodies were synSAA-positive and produced high fluorescence amplification 
patterns (defined as type 1); those containing glial cytoplasmic inclusions were 
synSAA-positive and produced intermediate fluorescence (defined as type 2); and 
those without α-synuclein pathology produced below-threshold fluorescence and 
were synSAA-negative. In 21 pathology-confirmed CSF samples (from the UPENN 
cohort), those with Lewy bodies were synSAA-positive type 1; those with glial 
cytoplasmic inclusions were synSAA-positive type 2; and those with four-repeat 
tauopathy were synSAA-negative. In the DeNoPa research cohort (which had no 
samples from people with multiple system atrophy), the novel synSAA had 
sensitivities of 95% (95% CI 88-99) for 80 participants with Parkinson's disease 
and 95% (76-100) for 21 participants with IRBD, and a specificity of 95% (86-99) 
for 60 healthy controls. Overall (combining BARMSA, EKUT, KAMSA, UGOT, and KIMSA 
cohorts that were enriched for cases of multiple system atrophy), the novel 
synSAA had 87% sensitivity for multiple system atrophy (95% CI 80-93) and 
specificity for type 2 seeds was 77% (67-85). For participants with multiple 
system atrophy just in research cohorts (BARMSA and EKUT), the novel synSAA had 
a sensitivity of 84% (95% CI 71-92) and a specificity for type 2 seeds of 87% 
(74-95), whereas cases from real-life cohorts (KAMSA, KIMSA, and UGOT) had a 
sensitivity of 91% (95% CI 80-97) but a decreased specificity for type 2 seeds 
of 68% (53-81).
INTERPRETATION: The novel synSAA produced amplification patterns that enabled 
the identification of underlying α-synuclein pathology, showing two levels of 
fluorescence that corresponded with different pathological hallmarks of 
synucleinopathy. The synSAA might be useful for early diagnosis of 
synucleinopathies in clinical trials, and potentially for clinical use, but 
additional formal validation work is needed.

Increasing evidence suggests that metabolic disorders such as obesity are 
implicated in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The pathological 
buildup of lipids in microglia is regarded as a key indicator in brain aging and 
the progression of AD, yet the mechanisms behind this process remain uncertain. 
The adipokine ANGPTL4 is strongly associated with obesity and is thought to play 
a role in the advancement of neurodegenerative diseases. This study utilized RNA 
sequencing to identify differential expression in lipid-accumulating BV2 
microglia and investigated the potential mechanism through ANGPTL4 
overexpression in BV2. Subsequently, animal models and clinical data were 
employed to further explore alterations in circulating ANGPTL4 levels in AD. RNA 
sequencing results indicated a correlation between ANGPTL4 and microglial lipid 
accumulation. The overexpression of ANGPTL4 in microglia resulted in increased 
secretion of inflammatory factors, elevated oxidative stress levels, and 
diminished antiviral capacity. Furthermore, when simulating the coexistence of 
AD and obesity through combined treatment with Amyloid-Beta 1-42 peptide (Aβ) 
and Free Fatty Acids (FFA) in vitro, we observed a notable upregulation of 
ANGPTL4 expression, highlighting its potential role in the interplay between AD 
and obesity. In vivo experiments, we also observed a significant increase in 
ANGPTL4 expression in the hippocampus and plasma of APP/PS1 mice compared to 
wild-type controls. This was accompanied by heightened microglial activation and 
reduced expression of longevity-related genes in the hippocampus. Clinical data 
from the UK Biobank indicated that plasma ANGPTL4 levels are elevated in 
patients with AD when compared to healthy controls. Moreover, significantly 
higher ANGPTL4 levels were observed in obese AD patients relative to their 
non-obese counterparts. Our findings suggest that ANGPTL4-mediated microglial 
aging may serve as a crucial link between AD and obesity, proposing ANGPTL4 as a 
potential biomarker for AD.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD), an age-progressive neurodegenerative 
disease, is featured by a relentless deterioration of cognitive abilities. In 
parallel with the hypotheses of Aβ and tau, microglia-mediated neuroinflammation 
is a core pathological hallmark of AD. Promoting the transition of microglia 
from M1 to M2 phenotype and inhibition of neuroinflammatory response provide new 
insights into the treatment of AD. And substantial studies have confirmed that 
overexpression of C/EBPβ accelerates the progression of AD pathology. 
Acupuncture is renowned for its unique advantages including safety and 
effectiveness, which has gained wide application in geriatric diseases, and 
thoroughly exploring the mechanism for its treatment of AD will provide 
scientific basis for its clinical application.
METHODS: In this study, SAMP8 mice were employed and EA therapy was performed as 
the main intervention. The combination of behavioural experiments (including 
water maze and novel objective recognition), Immunofluorescence, Western blot, 
and Chip-qPCR assay were performed to compare between different groups.
RESULTS: EA therapy facilitates the polarization of microglia from M1 to M2 
phenotype, reduces pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α) and 
promotes the expression of anti-inflammatory factors (IL-4 and IL-10), as well 
as attenuates neuroinflammation. Simultaneously, EA also inhibits the enrichment 
of H3K9ac at C/EBPβ promoter region and expression of C/EBPβ. Thus, it was 
evident that EA had a favorable effect on ameliorating cognitive decline in 
SAMP8 mice.
CONCLUSION: EA therapy may ameliorate cognitive deficits in AD via facilitating 
microglia shift from M1 to M2 phenotype and epigenetically regulating C/EBPβ. 
And further studies are required to better understand how the mechanism between 
microglia and epigenetic modulation of C/EBPβ are effective in reversing AD.

The LDL Receptor-Related Protein 1(LRP1), a member of the Low-density 
Lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family, is a multifunctional cellular transporter and 
signaling receptor, this includes regulation of lipid metabolism, cell migration 
and signaling. Abnormal accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) in the brain is 
thought to be the main pathological change in Alzheimer's disease. By binding to 
a variety of ligands, LRP1 is involved in the internalization and degradation of 
Aβ, thereby affecting the course of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we discuss 
the main mechanisms by which LRP1 mediates Aβ degradation and clearance and 
several current therapeutic approaches targeting LRP1. Finally, we concluded 
that modulating the expression level of LRP1 is an effective way to attenuate Aβ 
deposition and ameliorate AD. Abbreviations: LRP1, LDL Receptor-Related Protein

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder, with existing 
therapeutic drugs typically targeting specific disease stages. Traditional 
Chinese medicine (TCM), known for its multi-target and multi-mechanism 
therapeutic approach, has demonstrated efficacy in treating various stages of 
AD. In the present work, through a systematic review of classical Chinese 
medical texts, the formulae for preventing and treating AD were identified. 
Meanwhile, the active ingredients within these formulae were extracted and 
cataloged. A comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of omics data was performed 
to identify differentially expressed genes across different functional brain 
zones in AD patients at various stages. Finally, by integrating the 
multidimensional data, we proposed the first database, TCM-ADIP, dedicated to 
TCM based AD prevention and treatment, which is freely available at 
https://cbcb.cdutcm.edu.cn/TCM-ADIP/. TCM-ADIP not only supports interactive 
searching of multidimensional data, but also provides tools for gene 
localization and functional enrichment analysis of formulae, herbs, and 
ingredients for AD intervention in specific brain zones. TCM-ADIP fills a 
crucial gap in existing databases, offering a comprehensive resource for TCM in 
the treatment of AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses a major societal challenge, yet no definitive 
cure exists. Noninvasive brain stimulation methods, such as transcranial 
magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation, have shown 
promise in alleviating cognitive symptoms associated with neurodegenerative 
disorders. This study investigated the effects of 40 Hz vibrotactile stimulation 
on AD-related cellular responses using SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, primary 
human brain pericytes, and BV2 microglia. SH-SY5Y cells and brain pericytes 
treated with oligomeric beta-amyloid (Aβ) underwent 40 Hz vibrational 
stimulation for varying durations. Cell viability was determined via the CCK-8 
assay, while intracellular calcium levels in pericytes were assessed. Protein 
expression was measured using western blotting, and gene expression was 
quantified via a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Detailed 
vibrational parameters were employed to ensure precise stimulation. Notably, 
40 Hz vibrotactile stimulation improved cell viability in Aβ-exposed SH-SY5Y 
cells, reduced intracellular calcium ion (Ca2+) levels in Aβ-treated pericytes, 
activated autophagy, and mitigated tau hyperphosphorylation in SH-SY5Y cells. 
Additionally, it exhibited anti-neuroinflammatory properties in BV2 microglia. 
These findings highlight the potential of 40 Hz vibrotactile stimulation as a 
therapeutic strategy for AD.

Hydrogen sulfide has been known to humans for about 300 years and the previous 
studies emphasize only on its toxic side effects. In the last two decennium, 
researchers have varied their perspectives and insights towards H2S biology 
based on experimental findings. It has been found that H2S is an endogenic 
gaseous signaling molecule in many organisms and plays a crucial role in many 
systems and diseases. Early reports suggest that H2S as a neuromodulator 
influences calcium levels within the brain cells which ultimately control 
memory, learning, and cognition. It has also been observed that some 
complications in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases are due to 
anomalies in the biosynthesis and metabolism of H2S. This review focuses on the 
role of H2S in the pathophysiology of major neurodegenerative diseases such as 
Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and Vascular 
dementia. H2S was observed to have a protective role in the above-mentioned 
neurological conditions and the H2S donor therapy may help in disease 
management. The H2S gas displays a neuroprotective role and protects against 
cellular damage thereby declining the neurological conditions. Some studies have 
revealed that treatment with H2S donors has improved neuronal damage, restored 
memory and cognition in animal models. In this review, we have discussed the 
role of H2S donors as neuroprotective agents with examples of some of the 
natural and synthetic H2S donors, and also briefly enumerated the molecules used 
to detect H2S in neurodegenerative diseases.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease, 
characterized by memory loss, speech and motor defects, personality changes, and 
psychological disorders. The exact cause of AD remains unclear. Current 
treatments focus on maintaining neurotransmitter levels or targeting β-amyloid 
(Aβ) protein, but these only alleviate symptoms and do not reverse the disease. 
Developing new drugs is time-consuming, costly, and has a high failure rate. 
Utilizing multi-omics for drug repositioning has emerged as a new strategy. 
Based on transcriptomic perturbation data of over 40,000 drugs in human cells 
from the LINCS-L1000 database, our study employed the Jaccard index and 
hypergeometric distribution test for reverse transcriptional feature matching 
analysis, identifying Givinostat as a potential treatment for AD. Our research 
found that Givinostat improved cognitive behavior and brain pathology in models 
and enhanced hippocampal synaptic plasticity. Transcriptome sequencing revealed 
increased expression of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex proteins in the 
brains of APP/PS1 mice after Givinostat treatment. Functionally, Givinostat 
restored mitochondrial membrane potential, reduced reactive oxygen species, and 
increased ATP content in Aβ-induced HT22 cells. Additionally, it improved 
mitochondrial morphology and quantity in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice and 
enhanced brain glucose metabolic activity. These effects are linked to 
Givinostat promoting mitochondrial biogenesis and improving mitochondrial 
function. In summary, Givinostat offers a promising new strategy for AD 
treatment by targeting mitochondrial dysfunction.

BACKGROUND: Neurodegeneration has been recognized as the main pathophysiological 
alteration in the majority of brain-related diseases. Despite contemporary 
attempts to provide acceptable medicinal therapies, the conclusion has not been 
much beneficial. Besides, the complex pathophysiological mechanisms behind 
neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) urge the needs for finding novel multi-target 
agents. Accordingly, saffron with major active constituents and as 
multi-targeting agents have shown beneficial effects in modulating NDDs with 
higher efficacy and lower side effects.
PURPOSE: The present study provides a systematic and comprehensive review of the 
existing in vitro, in vivo, and clinical data on the effectiveness, and 
signaling pathways of saffron and its key phytochemical components in the 
management of NDDs. The need to develop novel saffron delivery systems is also 
considered.
METHODS: Studies were identified through a systematic and comprehensive search 
in Science Direct, PubMed, and Scopus databases through April 30, 2024. The 
whole saffron major constituents (e.g., saffron, crocin, crocetin, picrocrocin, 
and safranal) and NDDs (e.g., neuro*, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington*, Parkinson*, Alzheimer*, and brain) 
were selected as keywords to find related studies. In the systematic analysis, 
64 articles were directly included in the current study. Additional reports were 
added within the comprehensive studies in the review.
RESULTS: Saffron and its active metabolites crocin, crocetin, safranal, and 
picrocrocin have shown acceptable efficacy in managing NDDs like Alzheimer's 
disease, Parkinson's disease, Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, 
depression, and other NDDs via modulating apoptotic (e.g., caspases, Bax/Bcl-2, 
cytochrome c, and death receptors), inflammatory (e.g., NF-κB, IL-1β, IL-6, 
TNF-α, and COX-2), and oxidative strass (e.g., Nrf2, GSH, GPx, CAT, SOD, MDA, 
ROS, and nitrite) signaling pathways. The presented in vitro, in vivo, and 
clinical evidences showed us a better future of controlling NDDs with higher 
efficacy, while decreasing associated side effects with no significant toxicity. 
Additionally, employing novel delivery systems could increase the efficacy of 
saffron phytoconstituents to resolve the issues pharmacokinetic limitations.
CONCLUSION: Saffron and its major constituents employ anti-inflammatory, 
anti-apoptotic and antioxidant mechanisms in modulating several 
dysregulated-signaling pathways in NDDs. However, further research is necessary 
to elucidate the precise underlying mechanisms in exploring the feasibility of 
using saffron active compounds against NDDs. More studies should focus on 
dose-response relationships, long-term effects, highlighting key mechanisms, and 
designing more well-controlled clinical trials. Additionally, developing stable 
and cost-benefit novel delivery systems in future works helps to remove the 
pharmacokinetic limitations of saffron major constituents.

The physiological actions of a gut hormone, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain remain poorly understood, although GLP-1 receptor 
(GLP-1R) expression in this organ has been shown in several experimental 
studies. Therefore, we explored whether the GLP-1R signaling promotes the 
clearance of amyloid β (Aβ) (1-42) which is a core pathological hallmark of AD, 
focusing on the water channel protein aquaporin 4 (AQP4) localized to astrocyte 
endfeet perivascular membranes in intact brain. First, we confirmed that Glp1r 
mRNA is predominantly expressed at perivascular site of astrocytes in normal 
mouse cerebral cortex through in situ hybridization analysis. Next, we observed 
that 20-week subcutaneous administration of a GLP-1R agonist (GLP-1RA) 
liraglutide significantly reduced Aβ (1-42) accumulation in the cerebral cortex 
and improved spatial working memory in an AD mouse model, AppNL-G-F/NL-G-F mice. 
Furthermore, our current data revealed that the 4-week liraglutide treatment 
relocalized subcellular AQP4 in morphologically injured reactive astrocytes of 
AppNL-G-F/NL-G-F mice to the cell surface perivascular site through PKA-mediated 
AQP4 phosphorylation. Such translocation of phosphorylated AQP4 to astrocyte 
cell surface following incubation with liraglutide was observed also in the 
present in vitro study using the cell line in which AQP4 cDNA was introduced 
into immortalized human astrocyte. These results suggest that enhanced 
intracerebral GLP-1R signaling following peripheral administration of GLP-1RA 
restores AQP4 subcellular polarization in reactive astrocytes and would promote 
Aβ excretion possibly through increasing AQP4-mediated intracerebral water flux 
in the brain in AD.

Everyday Cognition, Mood, and Community Life-Space in Older Adults: Feasibility, 
Acceptability, and Preliminary Validity Study.

BACKGROUND: Current methods of monitoring cognition in older adults are 
insufficient to address the growing burden of Alzheimer disease and related 
dementias (AD/ADRD). New approaches that are sensitive, scalable, objective, and 
reflective of meaningful functional outcomes are direly needed. Mobility 
trajectories and geospatial life space patterns reflect many aspects of 
cognitive and functional integrity and may be useful proxies of age-related 
cognitive decline.
OBJECTIVE: We investigated the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary 
validity of a 1-month smartphone digital phenotyping protocol to infer everyday 
cognition, function, and mood in older adults from passively obtained GPS data. 
We also sought to clarify intrinsic and extrinsic factors associated with 
mobility phenotypes for consideration in future studies.
METHODS: Overall, 37 adults aged between 63 and 85 years with healthy cognition 
(n=31, 84%), mild cognitive impairment (n=5, 13%), and mild dementia (n=1, 3%) 
used an open-source smartphone app (mindLAMP) to unobtrusively capture GPS 
trajectories for 4 weeks. GPS data were processed into interpretable features 
across categories of activity, inactivity, routine, and location diversity. 
Monthly average and day-to-day intraindividual variability (IIV) metrics were 
calculated for each feature to test a priori hypotheses from a 
neuropsychological framework. Validation measures collected at baseline were 
compared against monthly GPS features to examine construct validity. Feasibility 
and acceptability outcomes included retention, comprehension of study 
procedures, technical difficulties, and satisfaction ratings at debriefing.
RESULTS: All (37/37, 100%) participants completed the 4-week monitoring period 
without major technical adverse events, 100% (37/37) reported satisfaction with 
the explanation of study procedures, and 97% (36/37) reported no feelings of 
discomfort. Participants' scores on the comprehension of consent quiz were 97% 
on average and associated with education and race. Technical issues requiring 
troubleshooting were infrequent, though 41% (15/37) reported battery drain. 
Moderate to strong correlations (r≥0.3) were identified between GPS features and 
validators. Specifically, individuals with greater activity and more location 
diversity demonstrated better cognition, less functional impairment, less 
depression, more community participation, and more geospatial life space on 
objective and subjective validation measures. Contrary to predictions, greater 
IIV and less routine in mobility habits were also associated with positive 
outcomes. Many demographic and technology-related factors were not associated 
with GPS features; however, income, being a native English speaker, season of 
study participation, and occupational status were related to GPS features.
CONCLUSIONS: Theoretically informed digital phenotypes of mobility are feasibly 
captured from older adults' personal smartphones and relate to clinically 
meaningful measures including cognitive test performance, reported functional 
decline, mood, and community activity. Future studies should consider the impact 
of intrinsic and extrinsic factors when interpreting mobility phenotypes. 
Overall, smartphone digital phenotyping is a promising method to unobtrusively 
capture relevant risk and resilience factors in the context of aging and AD/ADRD 
and should continue to be investigated in large, diverse samples.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. Epileptic 
seizures or epileptic activity have been detected in AD, and people with 
epilepsy have a higher risk of dementia compared to the general population. This 
suggests that seizures or epileptic activity might often coexist with AD. It is 
increasingly evident that epileptic activity or seizures are common but often 
overlooked comorbidities of AD. However, the causal relationship between 
seizures, epileptic activity and cognitive decline remains uncertain. 
Experimental data show that amyloid-β (Aβ) and Tau protein can cause neuronal 
hyperexcitability and has epileptogenic effects. Neural network hyperexcitation 
regulates the ratio of Aβ isoforms and is linked to the initiation of AD, 
indicating a shared mechanism. Clinical studies suggest that cognitive 
impairment accelerates in AD patients with seizures or epileptic activity. This 
review discusses the relationship between epileptic seizures and AD, the impact 
of epileptic activity in AD, and potential treatments.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the mechanism of action of Jiedu 
Yizhi formula (JDYZF) in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through 
network pharmacology, molecular docking technology, and in vivo experiments.
METHOD:  The main active ingredients of seven herbs in the Chinese Medicine 
compound JDYZF were identified by searching the TCMSP database, PubChem 
database, CNKI, and other sources. Disease targets of AD were obtained from 
databases such as OMIM, TDD, DisGeNET, and DrugBank. A protein‒protein 
interaction (PPI) network was constructed using the STRING platform, and core 
targets were identified through topological analysis using Cytoscape software. 
Gene Ontology (GO) functional analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and 
Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis of the relevant targets were 
performed using the Metascape database. The main active ingredients of JDYZF and 
potential core targets were identified based on degree values. Molecular docking 
technology was used to verify the interactions between the main active 
ingredients and potential core targets. Furthermore, water maze tests and 
hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining of brain and liver tissues were performed to 
evaluate the effects of JDYZF on cognitive dysfunction in AD mice and neuronal 
damage in hippocampal brain tissue and to assess drug toxicity. PCR was 
performed to determine the expression levels of the apoptosis-related genes 
Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase-3 and to investigate the effect of JDYZF on hippocampal 
apoptosis in AD mice. Results. One hundred twelve core PPI target proteins, 
including CASP3, TP53, and VEGFA, were found between JDYZF and AD. The KEGG 
pathway enrichment analysis showed significant enrichment of the MAPK signaling 
pathway, PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and so on. Water maze tests revealed that 
the high-dose JDYZF treatment significantly improved the escape latency of AD 
model mice. The HE staining results showed that JDYZF exerted a protective 
effect on neuronal damage in the hippocampus of AD mice. JDYZF could upregulate 
the expression of the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-2 while downregulating the 
expression of the proapoptotic factors Bax and caspase-3. Conclusion. JDYZF can 
improve the cognitive function of AD mice by suppressing cell apoptosis.

Carbonyl stress refers to the excessive accumulation of advanced glycation end 
products (AGEs) in mammalian tissues. This phenomenon plays a significant role 
in the pathogenesis of various diseases, including diabetes, chronic renal 
failure, arteriosclerosis, and central nervous system (CNS) disorders. We have 
previously demonstrated that an increase in glutathione concentration, dependent 
on the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) system, provides a 
potent cytoprotective effect against Methylglyoxal (MGO)-induced carbonyl 
stress. Meanwhile, dimethyl fumarate (DMF), known for its Nrf2-activating 
effects, was recently approved as a treatment for multiple sclerosis (MS), a 
neurodegenerative disease. DMF is a first line therapy for relapsing-remitting 
MS and may also be effective for other neurodegenerative conditions. However, 
the detailed mechanisms by which DMF mitigates neurodegenerative pathologies 
remain unclear. This study investigates the impact of DMF on anticarbonyl 
activity and its underlying mechanism focusing on the accumulation of carbonyl 
protein in the cell. MGO, a glucose metabolite, was used to induce carbonylation 
in the neuronal cell line. MGO is a typical carbonyl compound that readily 
reacts with arginine and lysine residues to form AGE-modified proteins. 
Methylglyoxal-derived hydroimidazolone 1 (MG-H1) often forms uncharged, 
hydrophobic residues on the protein surface, which can affect protein 
distribution and lead to misfolding. Our findings indicate that DMF increases 
levels of glutathione (GSH), glutamate cysteine ligase modifier subunit (GCLM), 
and nuclear Nrf2 in SH-SY5Y cells. Importantly, DMF pretreatment significantly 
reduced the accumulation of MG-H1-modified proteins. Furthermore, this effect of 
DMF was diminished when Nrf2 expression was suppressed and when GCL, a 
rate-limiting enzyme in GSH synthesis, was inhibited. Thus, the increase in GSH 
levels, leading to the activation of the Nrf2 pathway, a key factor in DMF's 
ability to suppress the accumulation of MG-H1-modified proteins. This study is 
the first to demonstrate that DMF possesses strong anticarbonyl stress activity 
in neuronal cells. Therefore, future research may extend the application of DMF 
to other CNS diseases associated with carbonyl stress, such as Alzheimer's and 
Parkinson's disease.

Donepezil (DNZ) has been used to treat dementia associated with mild, moderate, 
or severe Alzheimer's disease (AD). DNZ uptake can alleviate cognitive symptoms 
in AD patients via acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition. However, oral 
administration of DNZ has limitations, including first-pass metabolism, 
difficulties with swallowing, and low patient compliance. In this work, we 
disclose a novel transdermal DNZ delivery system utilizing T2 polymer, 
synthesized via the ring-opening polymerization of 
2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-2,5-disila-1-oxacyclopentane with trifluoroacetic acid 
(TFA). In the in vivo studies in an AD animal model, the DNZ-loaded T2 polymer 
(DNZ@T2) facilitated efficient transdermal DNZ delivery to the bloodstream and 
improved spatial working memory and long-term memory of the AD mouse model. Both 
the T2 polymer and DNZ@T2 exhibited low cytotoxicity and non-significant in vivo 
toxicity. This research highlights a promising transdermal delivery strategy for 
AD treatment, potentially enhancing therapeutic efficacy and patient compliance.

INTRODUCTION: Late-life air pollution exposure is associated with an increased 
risk for dementia, with this effect exacerbated among apolipoprotein E-4 
(ApoE-4) carriers. However, whether midlife occupational exposures likewise 
influence dementia outcomes, and varies as a function of ApoE-4 status is 
unknown.
METHODS: Using data from 3814 participants in the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study 
(WLS), we employed weighted logistic regression to evaluate associations between 
midlife occupational respiratory exposures and late-life air pollution on 
all-cause dementia risk, stratified by ApoE-4 status.
RESULTS: Midlife occupational exposure was associated with increased odds of 
all-cause dementia preferentially among ApoE-4 noncarriers (odds ratio 
[OR] = 1.59, p = 0.01), whereas higher late-life urban air pollution exposure 
was associated with increased dementia risk among ApoE-4 carriers (OR = 1.258, 
p = 0.029).
DISCUSSION: Associations between environmental exposures and dementia risk vary 
based on the timing of exposure and ApoE-4 status. While late-life environmental 
exposures are associated with dementia among ApoE-4 carriers, for noncarriers 
midlife environmental exposure confers the greatest risk.
HIGHLIGHTS: The effect of adult environmental respiratory exposures on 
subsequent dementia risk varies as a function of both ApoE-4 carrier status and 
exposure timing. Midlife occupational exposure to respiratory hazards is 
preferentially associated with increased dementia odds among ApoE-4 noncarriers. 
Late-life exposure to ambient air pollution is associated with dementia risk, 
but only among ApoE-4 carriers. While higher exposure to PM2.5 increases the 
risk for dementia, higher exposure to ozone was associated with reduced risk for 
dementia among ApoE-4 carriers.

Significance: Cellular senescence is a critical process underlying aging and is 
associated with age-related diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Lipids are 
implicated in cellular senescence. Fatty acids, particularly eicosanoids, have 
been associated with various forms of senescence and inflammation, and the 
associated reactive oxygen species production has been proposed as a therapeutic 
target for mitigating senescence. When overactivated, calcium-dependent 
phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid into 
eicosanoids such as leukotrienes and prostaglandins. Recent Advances: With a 
growing understanding of the importance of lipids as mediators and modulators of 
senescence, cPLA2 has emerged as a compelling drug target. cPLA2 overactivation 
plays a significant role in several pathways associated with senescence, 
including neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. Critical Issues: Previous 
cPLA2 inhibitors have shown potential in ameliorating inflammation and oxidative 
stress, but the dominant hurdles in the central nervous system-targeting drug 
discovery are specificity and blood-brain barrier penetrance. Future Directions: 
With the need for more effective drugs against neurological diseases, we 
emphasize the significance of discovering new brain-penetrant, potent, and 
specific cPLA2 inhibitors. We discuss how the recently developed Virtual Synthon 
Hierarchical Enumeration Screening, an iterative synthon-based approach for fast 
structure-based virtual screening of billions of compounds, provides an 
efficient exploration of large chemical spaces for the discovery of 
brain-penetrant cPLA2 small-molecule inhibitors. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 41,

INTRODUCTION: While the role of apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) susceptibility has been studied extensively, much less is known 
about the differences in disease presentation in APOE ε4 carriers versus 
non-carriers.
METHODS: To help elucidate these differences, we performed a broad analysis 
comparing the regional levels of six different neuroimaging biomarkers in the 
brains of APOE ε4 carriers versus non-carriers who participated in the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).
RESULTS: We observed significant APOE ε4-associated heterogeneity in regional 
amyloid beta deposition, tau accumulation, glucose uptake, brain volume, 
cerebral blood flow, and white matter hyperintensities within each AD diagnostic 
group. We also observed important APOE ε4-associated differences in cognitively 
unimpaired individuals who converted to mild cognitive impairment/AD versus 
those who did not convert.
DISCUSSION: This observed heterogeneity in neuroimaging biomarkers between APOE 
ε4 carriers versus non-carriers may have important implications regarding the 
prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of AD in different subpopulations.
HIGHLIGHTS: An extensive study was performed on the apolipoprotein E (APOE) 
ε4-associated heterogeneity in neuroimaging biomarkers from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Robust APOE ε4-associated increases in amyloid 
beta (Aβ) deposition throughout the brain, in every diagnostic group, were 
observed. APOE ε4-associated increases in tau pathology, decreases in glucose 
uptake, and increases in brain atrophy, which expand in regional scope and 
magnitude with disease progression, were observed. Significant sex- and 
age-related differences in APOE ε4-associated neuroimaging biomarker 
heterogeneity, with overall increases in pathological presentation in female 
APOE ε4 carriers, were observed. Regional differences in Aβ deposition, tau 
accumulation, glucose uptake, ventricle size, and white matter hyperintensities 
were observed in cognitively normal participants who converted to mild cognitive 
impairment/Alzheimer's disease, which may hold potential predictive value.

Norepinephrine (NE) modulates cognitive function, arousal, attention, and 
responses to novelty and stress, and also regulates neuroinflammation. We 
previously demonstrated behavioral and immunomodulatory effects of 
beta-adrenergic pharmacology in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The 
current studies were designed to block noradrenergic signaling in 5XFAD mice 
through 1) chemogenetic inhibition of the locus coeruleus (LC), 2)pharmacologic 
blocking of β-adrenergic receptors, and 3) conditional deletion of β1- or 
β2-adrenergic receptors (adrb1 or adrb2) in microglia. First, brain-wide AD 
pathology was mapped in 3D by imaging immunolabeled, cleared 5XFAD brains to 
assess the overlap between Aβ pathology, reactive microglia, and the loss of 
tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression in the catecholaminergic system. To examine 
the effects of inhibiting the LC NE system in the 5XFAD model, inhibitory (Gi) 
DREADD receptors were expressed specifically in LC NE neurons. LC NE neurons 
were chronically inhibited through the subcutaneous pump administration of the 
DREADD agonist clozapine-N-oxide (CNO). Plasma and brains were collected for 
assessment of neuroinflammation and pathology. A separate cohort of 5XFAD mice 
was chronically dosed with the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol or vehicle 
and evaluated for behavior, as well as post-mortem neuroinflammation and 
pathology. Finally, we used 5XFAD mice with conditional deletion of either adrb1 
or adrb2 in microglia to assess neuroinflammation and pathology mediated by 
β-adrenergic signaling. Using iDISCO, light sheet fluorescence microscopy, and 
novel analyses, we detected widespread microgliosis and amyloid pathology, along 
with modest TH downregulation in fibers across multiple brain regions, in 
contrast to the spatially limited TH downregulation observed in neurons. Both 
chemogenetic inhibition of LC adrenergic signaling and pharmacological 
inhibition of beta-adrenergic receptors potentiated neuroinflammation without 
altering amyloid beta pathology. Conditional deletion of adrb1 in microglia did 
not affect neuroinflammation. Conditional deletion of adrb2 in microglia 
attenuated inflammation and pathology in females but had no effect in males. 
Overall, these data support previous observations demonstrating the 
immunomodulatory effects of beta-adrenergic signaling in the pathophysiology of 
brain disorders and suggest that adrenergic receptors on cell types other than 
microglia, such as astrocytes, may predominantly mediate the disease-modifying 
effects of β-adrenergic agonists in the brain.

BACKGROUND: Older adults commonly experience chronic medical conditions and are 
at risk of cognitive impairment as a result of age, chronic comorbidity, and 
medications prescribed to manage multiple chronic conditions. Anticholinergic 
medications are common treatments for chronic conditions, and have been 
repeatedly associated with poor cognitive outcomes, including delirium and 
dementia, in epidemiologic studies. However, no study has definitively evaluated 
the causal relationship between anticholinergics and cognition in a randomized 
controlled trial design. Utilizing our prior experience in deprescribing 
anticholinergic medications in various clinical environments, we designed an 
outpatient deprescribing intervention to prospectively test the potential causal 
relationship between anticholinergics and cognition in primary care older 
adults.
METHODS: This cluster randomized clinical trial will be conducted to evaluate 
the impact of an anticholinergic deprescribing intervention compared to usual 
care on outcomes of cognition and safety in primary care older adults. 
Participants will include those aged 65 years and over, receiving primary care 
in the greater Indianapolis area, using a strong anticholinergic within the last 
two weeks or with evidence of high-risk exposure in the past year. Those 
excluded will have a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease or related dementia, or 
serious mental illness. The trial plans to enroll 344 participants who will be 
cluster-randomized at the level of primary care physician to avoid 
contamination. Participants will complete outcome assessments every six months 
up to 2 years by blinded outcome assessors. The primary outcome of the study is 
a composite measure of cognition that includes domains assessing executive 
cognitive function, language, and memory. Secondary outcomes include 
patient-reported measures of pain intensity, depression, anxiety, sleep 
disturbance, and health-related quality of life.
DISCUSSION: The R2D2 trial will be the largest and longest prospective 
randomized trial testing the impact of an anticholinergic-specific deprescribing 
intervention on cognition in primary care older adults. Results could influence 
deprescribing methodology and provide new insight on the relationship between 
anticholinergics and cognition.

Update in
    Alzheimers Dement. 2025 Apr;21(4):e70172. doi: 10.1002/alz.70172.

BACKGROUND: All individuals with Down Syndrome (DS) will develop full-blown 
Alzheimeŕs disease (AD) pathology by age 40, decades before the occurrence of 
sporadic late-onset AD. Understanding this strong biological relation between 
age and AD pathology risk in DS is important to accelerate diagnostics, disease 
monitoring, and treatment. Several genes encoded in chromosome 21 including 
dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A) have been 
proven to contribute to the pathology. A recently validated plasma immunoassay 
to measure tau phosphorylation at threonine-212 (p-tau212) has very high 
diagnostic accuracy in detecting AD. P-tau212 is also very sensitive to DYRK1A 
phosphorylation and is increased in DSAD brain lysates. Here, we assessed the 
potential of this biomarker in DSAD and sporadic AD.
METHODS: Using Simoa technology, we tested p-tau212 and p-tau181 (n=245 for 
plasma, n=114 matching cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples). We used AUC-ROC to 
examine diagnostic performance and the DeLong test to compare the AUC-ROC 
differences between methods. Spearman correlation is used to examine 
correlations. Fold changes relative to median levels were calculated for their 
respective asymptomatic groups. ANCOVA followed by Tukey posthoc test was used 
to calculate differences across groups. LOESS was used to determine the 
temporality of plasma biomarker changes.
RESULTS: We have confirmed that p-tau212 has extremely high accuracy in 
detecting AD-related changes in euploid controls. For the DS population, we 
observed a strong correlation between plasma and CSF p-tau212 (r=0.867; 
p<0.001). In prodromal DS (pDS) and dementia DS (dDS), we observed significantly 
elevated levels of p-tau212 in reference to asymptomatic DS (aDS). The 
diagnostic accuracy to differentiate between aDS and dDS was AUC=0.91 and AUC = 
0.86 in discriminating between DS amyloid positive and amyloid negative 
participants. Plasma p-tau212 started increasing approximately when people 
became amyloid PET-positive.
CONCLUSIONS: We have confirmed that the levels of plasma p-tau212 are increased 
in the DS population and sporadic AD cases including prodromal and MCI states. 
Plasma p-tau212 might have utility for theragnostic, monitoring therapy 
efficacy, and as a target engagement biomarker in clinical trials both in 
sporadic and DSAD.

    J Biomed Inform. 2025 Jun;166:104830. doi: 10.1016/j.jbi.2025.104830.

BACKGROUND: Early detection of cognitive decline during the preclinical stage of 
Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) is crucial for timely 
intervention and treatment. Clinical notes in the electronic health record 
contain valuable information that can aid in the early identification of 
cognitive decline. In this study, we utilize advanced large clinical language 
models, fine-tuned on clinical notes, to improve the early detection of 
cognitive decline.
METHODS: We collected clinical notes from 2,166 patients spanning the 4 years 
preceding their initial mild cognitive impairment (MCI) diagnosis from the 
Enterprise Data Warehouse of Mass General Brigham. To train the model, we 
developed CD-Tron, built upon a large clinical language model that was finetuned 
using 4,949 expert-labeled note sections. For evaluation, the trained model was 
applied to 1,996 independent note sections to assess its performance on 
real-world unstructured clinical data. Additionally, we used explainable AI 
techniques, specifically SHAP values (SHapley Additive exPlanations), to 
interpret the model's predictions and provide insight into the most influential 
features. Error analysis was also facilitated to further analyze the model's 
prediction.
RESULTS: CD-Tron significantly outperforms baseline models, achieving notable 
improvements in precision, recall, and AUC metrics for detecting cognitive 
decline (CD). Tested on many real-world clinical notes, CD-Tron demonstrated 
high sensitivity with only one false negative, crucial for clinical applications 
prioritizing early and accurate CD detection. SHAP-based interpretability 
analysis highlighted key textual features contributing to model predictions, 
supporting transparency and clinician understanding.
CONCLUSION: CD-Tron offers a novel approach to early cognitive decline detection 
by applying large clinical language models to free-text EHR data. Pretrained on 
real-world clinical notes, it accurately identifies early cognitive decline and 
integrates SHAP for interpretability, enhancing transparency in predictions.

BACKGROUND: A water extract of the Ayurvedic plant Centella asiatica (CAW) 
improves cognitive function in mouse models of aging and Alzheimer's disease, 
and affects dendritic arborization, mitochondrial activity and oxidative stress 
in mouse primary neurons. Triterpenes (TT) and caffeoylquinic acids (CQA) are 
constituents associated with these bioactivities of CAW although little is known 
about how interactions between these compounds contribute to the plant's 
therapeutic benefit.
METHODS: Mouse primary cortical neurons were treated with CAW, or equivalent 
concentrations of four TT combined, eight CQA combined, or these twelve 
compounds combined (TTCQA). Treatment effects on the cell transcriptome (18,491 
genes) and metabolome (192 metabolites) relative to vehicle control were 
evaluated using RNAseq and metabolomic analyses respectively.
RESULTS: Extensive differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were seen with all 
treatments, as well as evidence of interactions between compounds. Notably many 
DEGs seen with TT treatment were not observed in the TTCQA condition, possibly 
suggesting CQA reduced the effects of TT. Moreover, additional gene activity 
seen with CAW as compared to TTCQA indicate the presence of additional compounds 
in CAW that further modulate TTCQA interactions. Weighted Gene Correlation 
Network Analysis (WGCNA) identified 4 gene co-expression modules altered by 
treatments that were associated with extracellular matrix organization, fatty 
acid metabolism, cellular response to stress and stimuli, and immune function. 
Compound interaction patterns were seen at the eigengene level in these modules. 
Interestingly, in metabolomics analysis, the TTCQA treatment saw the highest 
number of changes in individual metabolites (20), followed by CQA (15), then TT 
(8) and finally CAW (3). WGCNA analysis found two metabolomics modules with 
significant eigenmetabolite differences for TT and CQA, and possible compound 
interactions at this level.
CONCLUSIONS: Four gene expression modules and two metabolite modules were 
altered by the four types of treatments applied. This methodology demonstrated 
the existence of both negative and positive interactions between TT, CQA and 
additional compounds found in CAW on the transcriptome and metabolome of mouse 
primary cortical neurons.

INTRODUCTION: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health disorder 
caused by experiencing or witnessing traumatic events. Recent studies show that 
patients with PTSD have an increased risk of developing dementia, including 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), but there is currently no way to predict which 
patients will go on to develop AD. The objective of this study was to identify 
structural and functional neural changes in patients with PTSD that may 
contribute to the future development of AD.
METHODS: Neuroimaging (pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling [pCASL] and 
structural magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) and behavioral data for the current 
study (n = 67) were taken from our non-randomized open label clinical trial 
(ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03229915) for treatment-seeking individuals 
with PTSD (n = 40) and age-matched healthy controls (HC; n = 27). Only the 
baseline measures were utilized for this study. Mean cerebral blood flow (CBF) 
and gray matter (GM) volume were compared between groups. Additionally, we 
utilized two previously established machine learning-based algorithms, one 
representing AD-like brain activity (Machine learning-based AD Designation 
[MAD]) and the other focused on AD-like brain structural changes (AD-like Brain 
Structure [ABS]). MAD scores were calculated from pCASL data and ABS scores were 
calculated from structural T1-MRI images. Correlations between neuroimaging data 
(regional CBF, GM volume, MAD scores, ABS scores) and PTSD symptom severity 
scores measured by the clinician-administered PTSD scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) were 
assessed.
RESULTS: Decreased CBF was observed in two brain regions (left caudate/striatum 
and left inferior parietal lobule/middle temporal lobe) in the PTSD group, 
compared to the HC group. Decreased GM volume was also observed in the PTSD 
group in the right temporal lobe (parahippocampal gyrus, middle temporal lobe), 
compared to the HC group. GM volume within the right temporal lobe cluster 
negatively correlated with CAPS-5 scores and MAD scores in the PTSD group.
CONCLUSION: Results suggest that patients with PTSD with reduced GM volume in 
the right temporal regions (parahippocampal gyrus) experienced greater symptom 
severity and showed more AD-like brain activity. These results show potential 
for early identification of those who may be at an increased risk for future 
development of dementia.

BACKGROUND: Accurately differentiating stable mild cognitive impairment (sMCI) 
from progressive MCI (pMCI) is clinically relevant, and identification of pMCI 
is crucial for timely treatment before it evolves into Alzheimer's disease (AD).
OBJECTIVE: To construct a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to 
differentiate pMCI from sMCI integrating features from structural magnetic 
resonance imaging (sMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) images.
METHODS: We proposed a multi-modal and multi-stage region of interest 
(ROI)-based fusion network (m2ROI-FN) CNN model to differentiate pMCI from sMCI, 
adopting a multi-stage fusion strategy to integrate deep semantic features and 
multiple morphological metrics derived from ROIs of sMRI and PET images. 
Specifically, ten AD-related ROIs of each modality images were selected as 
patches inputting into 3D hierarchical CNNs. The deep semantic features 
extracted by the CNNs were fused through the multi-modal integration module and 
further combined with the multiple morphological metrics extracted by 
FreeSurfer. Finally, the multilayer perceptron classifier was utilized for 
subject-level MCI recognition.
RESULTS: The proposed model achieved accuracy of 77.4% to differentiate pMCI 
from sMCI with 5-fold cross validation on the entire ADNI database. Further, 
ADNI-1&2 were formed into an independent sample for model training and 
validation, and ADNI-3&GO were formed into another independent sample for 
multi-center testing. The model achieved 73.2% accuracy in distinguishing pMCI 
and sMCI on ADNI-1&2 and 75% accuracy on ADNI-3&GO.
CONCLUSIONS: An effective m2ROI-FN model to distinguish pMCI from sMCI was 
proposed, which was capable of capturing distinctive features in ROIs of sMRI 
and PET images. The experimental results demonstrated that the model has the 
potential to differentiate pMCI from sMCI.

BACKGROUND: The Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive 
Impairment and Disability (FINGER) multimodal lifestyle intervention yielded 
cognitive and other health benefits in older adults at risk of cognitive 
decline. The two-year multinational randomized controlled LETHE trial evaluates 
the feasibility of a digitally supported, adapted FINGER intervention among 
at-risk older adults. Technology is used to complement in-person activities, 
streamline the intervention delivery, personalize recommendations, and collect 
digital biomarkers.
METHODS: Trial includes older adults (60-77 years) with digital 
readiness/experience with smart devices and increased dementia risk but without 
substantial cognitive impairment. Participants are enrolled at four sites 
(Austria, Finland, Italy, Sweden). At baseline, participants were randomized 1:1 
ratio to 1) intervention i.e., structured multimodal lifestyle program 
(including diet, exercise, cognitive training, vascular/metabolic risk 
management, social stimulation, sleep/stress management) where in-person 
activities led by professionals are supported with an Android mobile phone 
application developed by the consortium (the LETHE App); or 2) control i.e., 
self-guided program (regular health advice; simplified App with no 
personalized/interactive content). All participants wear smartwatches to gather 
passive data (e.g., physical activity, sleep). Primary outcomes are retention, 
adherence, and change in validated dementia risk scores. Secondary outcomes 
include changes in lifestyle, cognition, stress, sleep, health-related quality 
of life, and health literacy. Additional outcomes (exploratory) include e.g. 
participant experiences and dementia-related biomarkers (Alzheimer's disease 
blood markers, neuroimaging). A sub-study explores the feasibility of novel 
interactive technology (audio glasses, social robot).
RESULTS: Recruitment began in September 2022, and the last participant was 
randomized in June 2023. In total, 156 individuals were randomized (mean age 
69 years, 65% women; balanced recruitment across the four sites). Vascular and 
lifestyle risk factors were common (e.g., 65% with hypertension, 69% with 
hypercholesterolemia, 39% physically inactive), indicating successful 
recruitment of a population with risk reduction potential. Trial will be 
completed by summer 2025. Retention until the first post-baseline visit at 
6 months is high (n = 2 discontinued, retention 98.7%).
CONCLUSION: LETHE provides crucial information about the feasibility of 
technology and a digitally supported FINGER lifestyle program to promote brain 
health. Digital tools specifically designed for older adults could offer 
potential for large-scale, cost-effective prevention programs.

BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial dysfunction emerges as an early pathological hallmark 
of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential 
and the elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production are pivotal in the 
initiation of neuronal cell apoptosis. Pedunculoside(Ped), a novel triterpene 
saponin derived from the dried barks of Ilex rotunda Thunb, exhibits a potent 
anti-inflammatory effect. In the course of drug screening, we discovered that 
Ped offers significant protection against apoptosis induced by Aβ1-42. 
Nevertheless, the role and mechanism of Ped in AD are yet to be elucidated.
METHODS: Oxidative stress was evaluated by measuring mitochondrial membrane 
potential and intracellular ROS production. The expression of proteins 
associated with apoptosis was determined using western blot analysis and flow 
cytometry. In vivo, the pathological characteristics of AD were investigated 
through Western blot and tissue immunofluorescence techniques. Cognitive 
function was assessed using the Morris Water Maze and Novel Object Recognition 
tests.
RESULTS: We demonstrated that Ped decreased apoptosis in PC12 cells, reduced the 
generation of intracellular ROS, and restored mitochondrial membrane potential. 
Mechanistically, we found that the protective effect of Ped against Aβ-induced 
neurotoxicity was associated with activation of the AMPK/GSK-3β/Nrf2 signaling 
pathway. In vivo, Ped alleviated memory deficits and inhibited neuronal 
apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress in the hippocampus of 3 × Tg AD 
mice, along with the activation of the AMPK signaling pathway.
CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that Ped exerts its neuroprotective effects 
against oxidative stress and apoptosis through the AMPK signaling cascade. The 
results demonstrate that Ped is a potential candidate for the treatment of AD.

BACKGROUND: Evidence supports the neuroprotective effects of physical activity, 
either in experimental animal models or humans. However, the biological 
mechanisms by which physical exercise modulates dementia and Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) progression are still unclear.
OBJECTIVE: This study investigated whether long-term (6 months) of voluntary 
wheel running induces neuroprotective effects in the pathogenesis of AD in 
middle-aged (8 months) female mice, focusing on energy metabolism.
METHODS: A genetic mice model of AD (3xTg-AD) that performed wheel running 
presented changes in body metabolism and muscle oxidative profile, as well as 
restored discriminative and non-associative retention memories, evaluated by 
novel object recognition and open field tasks, respectively.
RESULTS: In the hippocampus, these mice exhibited reduced levels of 
amyloidogenic AβPPβ fragment, phospho-Tau protein and phospho-Akt (activated 
form), without changes in phospho-AMPK (activated form). In addition, 
hippocampal mitochondria presented a restored respiratory function, 
characterized by lower coupling degree and weak contribution from complex I 
found in 3xTg-AD mice.
CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated that voluntary exercise improves cognitive 
parameters and biochemical hallmarks of AD, modulates Akt activation and 
enhances mitochondrial energy metabolism in hippocampus of middle-aged 3xTg-AD 
female mice, thereby reinforcing the neuroprotective role of physical exercise 
and the involvement of mitochondria in the etiology of the AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease characterized by 
amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition and neurofibrillary tangles formed by high 
phosphorylation of tau protein. At present, drug therapy is the main strategy of 
AD treatment, but its effects are limited to delaying or alleviating AD. 
Recently, non-pharmacologic intervention has attracted more attention, and more 
studies have confirmed that non-pharmacologic intervention in AD can improve the 
patient's cognitive function and quality of life. This paper summarizes the 
current non-pharmacologic intervention in AD, to provide useful supplementary 
means for AD intervention.

BACKGROUND: The efficacy and safety of 40 Hz gamma transcranial alternating 
current stimulation (γ-tACS) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are still uncertain.
OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the therapeutic 
potential and safety of 40 Hz γ-tACS for AD.
METHODS: The meta-analysis was conducted by systematically searching four 
databases from their start to 28 December 2023. Subgroup analyses were performed 
to identify the intervention effects of γ-tACS.
RESULTS: Of the 7 included studies, γ-tACS has a notable impact on improving 
overall cognition [standardized mean difference (SMD): 0.49, 95% CI: 0.09 to 
0.89], memory (SMD: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.18 to 1.41), and cholinergic transmission 
(weighted mean difference: -0.40, 95% CI: -0.43 to -0.37). Furthermore, subgroup 
analysis revealed that γ-tACS treatment had a substantial impact on enhancing 
memory targeting the left angular gyrus in both home (SMD: 3.12, 95% CI: 1.54 to 
4.70) and non-home settings (SMD: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.24 to 0.82). However, γ-tACS 
had a positive effect on overall cognition in non-home settings (SMD: 0.55, 95% 
CI 0.11 to 0.98), but not in home settings (SMD: 0.22, 95% CI -0.76 to 1.20). 
Additionally, targeting temporo-frontal or bitemporal γ-tACS treatment resulted 
in improvement in overall cognition (SMD: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.06 to 1.16), but not 
targeting the left angular gyrus (SMD: 0.22, 95% CI: -0.76 to 1.20).
CONCLUSIONS: γ-tACS could be beneficial in enhancing cognition, memory and 
restoring cholinergic dysfunction in AD. The different selection of stimulation 
sites plays distinct roles. Meanwhile, AD patients are recommended to receive 
γ-tACS treatment at home.
