Treatment with melatonin is routinely prescribed for its potent antioxidant and 
cognitive-promoting effects, nevertheless, it has yet to find neuromodulatory 
effects in normal and disease conditions. Therefore, to investigate its 
neuromodulatory mechanisms, melatonin was systemically administered over 10 
consecutive days to both intracortical normal saline- and amyloid-β 1-42 (Aβ) 
peptide-injected rats. At the behavioral level, treatment with melatonin was 
associated with reduced efficacy in restoring Aβ-induced deficit in 
passive-avoidance memory. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from CA1 pyramidal 
neurons revealed that melatonin treatment reduced spontaneous and evoked 
intrinsic excitability in control rats while exerting a reduction of 
spontaneous, but not evoked activity, in the Aβ-injected group. Interestingly, 
treatment with melatonin enhances after-hyperpolarization in control, but not 
Aβ-injected rats. In contrast, our voltage-clamp study showed that Ih current is 
significantly enhanced by Aβ injection, and this effect is further strengthened 
by treatment with melatonin in Aβ-injected rats. Finally, we discovered that the 
transcription of melatonin receptors 1 (MT1) and 2 (MT2) is significantly 
upregulated in the hippocampi of Aβ-injected rats. Collectively, our study 
demonstrates that systemic treatment with melatonin has differential 
neuromodulation on CA1 neuronal excitability, at least in part, via differential 
effects on after-hyperpolarization and Ih currents due to Aβ-induced 
neurotoxicity.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease 
characterized by Amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. We explored the 
potential mechanism by which Danggui Shaoyao San (DSS) modulates central glucose 
metabolism via the insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1)/glycogen synthase 
kinase-3β (GSK3β)/Wnt3a-β-catenin pathway, thereby exerting protective effects 
on cognitive functions.
METHODS: In vitro, HT22 cells were induced with streptozotocin (STZ) to 
investigate the impact of GSK3β on pathway transduction. The active components 
in the DSS stock solution were validated using mass spectrometry. Subsequently, 
an AD model in C57BL/6J mice was established through STZ injection into both 
ventricles. The success of the model was validated behaviorally and 
pathologically. The Morris Water Maze (MWM) test, immunohistochemistry, Western 
blotting, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, and 
18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) were employed to 
evaluate the influence of DSS on memory and pathological changes in AD.
RESULTS: The DSS stock solution, rich in active components, ameliorated the 
memory deficits in AD mice in the MWM. In vitro, GSK3β exhibited regulatory 
control over Wnt and β-catenin, with GSK3β inhibition mitigating β-amyloid and 
tau redundancies at protein and gene levels, facilitating signal transduction. 
In vivo, DSS impacted key targets in the IRS1/GSK3β/Wnt3a-β-catenin pathway, 
mitigated senile plaques resulting from amyloid β (Aβ) deposition and neurofiber 
tangles induced by tau hyperphosphorylation, and alleviated the decline in 
central glucose metabolism observed in FDG-PET.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that DSS potentially confers cognitive 
protection by alleviating central hypoglycemia through the 
IRS1/GSK3β/Wnt3a-β-catenin pathway. This may serve as a promising therapeutic 
avenue for AD.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses a significant public health 
challenge, increasingly affecting patients' finances, mental health, and 
functional abilities as the global population ages. Stem cell-derived 
extracellular vesicles (SC-EVs) have emerged as a promising cell-free 
therapeutic approach for AD, although their precise mechanisms remain unclear. 
This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the effectiveness of SC-EVs in treating AD.
METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases 
up to December 31, 2023, identifying studies investigating SC-EVs therapy in AD 
rodent models. Outcome measures included Morris water maze and Y maze tests, 
β-amyloid pathology, and inflammatory markers. Statistical analyses utilized 
Stata 15.1 and R software.
RESULTS: This meta-analysis of 16 studies (2017-2023, 314 animals) demonstrates 
significant efficacy of SC-EVs therapy in AD models. Pooled analyses 
demonstrated that SC-EVs therapy significantly increased the learning function 
as measured by Morris water maze tests (MWM) by -1.83 (95% CI = -2.51 to -1.15, 
p < 0.0001), Y maze test by 1.66 (95% CI = 1.03 to 2.28, p < 0.0001), decreased 
Aβ plaques in the hippocampal by -2.10 (95% CI = -2.96 to -1.23, p < 0.0001), 
and proinflammatory cytokines Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) by -2.61 (95% 
CI = -4.87 to -0.35, p < 0.05), Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) by -2.37 (95% CI = 
-3.68 to -1.05, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: SC-EVs therapy shows promise in enhancing cognitive function and 
mitigating AD progression in preclinical models. Future research should focus on 
standardizing methodologies and comparing SC-EVs isolation techniques and dosing 
strategies to facilitate clinical translation.

Epidemiological studies show that individuals with obesity are more likely to 
develop Alzheimer's disease (AD) than those who do not have obesity. However, 
the mechanisms underlying the relationship between obesity and AD are not 
entirely unclear. Here, we have reviewed and analyzed relevant articles 
published in the literature and found that obesity has correlation or potential 
increase in the levels of β-amyloid (Aβ) protein, which may explain why people 
with obesity are more likely to suffer from AD. Additionally, the published 
findings point to the roles of obesity-related metabolic disorders, such as 
diabetes, inflammation, oxidative stress, and imbalance in gut microbiota in Aβ 
accumulation caused by obesity. Therefore, in-depth experimental and clinical 
studies on these mechanisms in the future may help shed light on appropriate 
prevention and treatment strategies for AD, such as dietary changes and regular 
exercise to reverse or prevent obesity and related metabolic disorders.

INTRODUCTION: Agitation is a common and disruptive syndrome in dementia due to 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Brexpiprazole was recently approved for this agitation 
of AD dementia and is the only therapy approved for this indication.
AREAS COVERED: The authors review the chemistry, pharmacokinetics, mechanism of 
action, and pharmacodynamics of brexpiprazole. Phase 2/3 and Phase 3 studies of 
brexpiprazole for the treatment of agitation in dementia due to AD are 
described. These studies demonstrated efficacy and safety for the 2 mg/d and 
3 mg/d doses. Agitation reduction from baseline was significantly greater in the 
active treatment groups compared to the participants on placebo as measured by 
the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory, the primary outcome. Treatment benefit 
was demonstrated on the Clinician Global Impression - Severity, the key 
secondary outcome. Safety and tolerability were comparable in drug and placebo 
arms of the studies.
EXPERT OPINION: Approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of 
brexpiprazole for the treatment of agitation in dementia due to AD is an 
important milestone and regulatory precedent. This is the first approval for the 
treatment of any neuropsychiatric syndrome of AD. Brexpiprazole has a 'black 
box' warning for its use in psychosis caused by dementia due to an observed 
increase in mortality when using this class of antipsychotic agents in patients 
with dementia. Post-marketing surveillance will be key to understanding the 
safety profile of brexpiprazole. Brexpiprazole may be prioritized over the 'off 
label' use of other potential treatments for agitation.

Artemisinin (ART) and its derivatives, collectively referred to as artemisinins 
(ARTs), have been approved for the treatment of malaria for decades. ARTs are 
converted into dihydroartemisinin (DHA), the only active form, which is 
reductive in vivo. In this review, we provide a brief overview of the 
neuroprotective potential of ARTs and the underlying mechanisms on several of 
the most common neurodegenerative diseases, particularly considering their 
potential application in those associated with cognitive and motor impairments 
including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's 
disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). ARTs act as autophagy 
balancers to alleviate AD and PD. They inhibit neuroinflammatory responses by 
regulating phosphorylation of signal transduction proteins, such as AKT, PI3K, 
ERK, NF-κB, p38 MAPK, IκBα. In addition, ARTs regulate GABAergic signaling in a 
dose-dependent manner. Although they competitively inhibit the binding of 
gephyrin to GABAergic receptors, low doses of ARTs enhance GABAergic signaling. 
ARTs can also inhibit ferroptosis, activate the Akt/Bcl-2, AMPK, or ERK/CREB 
pathways to reduce oxidative stress, and maintain mitochondrial homeostasis, 
protecting neurons from oxidative stress injury. More importantly, ARTs 
structurally combine with and suppress β-Amyloid (A[Formula: see text]-induced 
neurotoxicity, reduce P-tau, and maintain O-GlcNAcylation/Phosphorylation 
balance, leading to relieved pathological changes in neurodegenerative diseases. 
Collectively, these natural properties endow ARTs with unique potential for 
application in neurodegenerative diseases.

This cohort study aimed to analyze the relationship between nut consumption and 
the risk of all-cause dementia in adults from the United Kingdom (UK). Data from 
participants in the UK Biobank cohort between 2007-2012 (baseline) and 2013-2023 
(follow-up) were analyzed. Baseline information on nut consumption was obtained 
using the Oxford WebQ 24-h questionnaire. All-cause dementia (i.e. Alzheimer's 
disease, frontotemporal dementia, or vascular dementia) was assessed at baseline 
and follow-up through self-reported medical diagnosis, hospitalization, or death 
records. Hazard regression models were used to estimate the association between 
nut consumption and the risk of developing all-cause dementia, with adjustments 
made for sociodemographic, lifestyle, hearing problems, self-rated health, and 
the number of chronic diseases. Participants with all-cause dementia at baseline 
were excluded. A total of 50,386 participants (mean age 56.5 ± 7.7 years, 49.2% 
women) were included in the prospective analyses. The incidence of all-cause 
dementia was 2.8% (n = 1422 cases). Compared with no consumption, daily nut 
consumption (> 0 to 3 or more handfuls) was significantly associated with a 12% 
lower risk of all-cause dementia (hazard ratio = 0.88; 95% confidence interval, 
0.77-0.99) after 7.1 mean years of follow-up, regardless of the potential 
confounders considered. No statistically significant interactions were observed 
between nut consumption and any of the covariates included in the hazard 
regression models. Stratified analyses revealed that nut consumption of up to 1 
handful of 30 g/day and consumption of unsalted nuts were associated with the 
greatest protective benefits. The daily consumption of nuts may play a 
protective role in the prevention of dementia.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is known to be associated with an increased risk of 
epilepsy, which is not exclusively related to the late stage of the disease - 
when a major cognitive impairment is observed, previously known as the dementia 
stage - but also to its prodromal stage (mild cognitive impairment). Moreover, 
published case reports and cohorts have shown that epilepsy may occur even 
earlier, at the preclinical stage of AD: Epileptic seizures may therefore be the 
sole objective manifestation of the disease. Such a situation is called the 
epileptic variant of AD (evAD). EvAD is one of the etiologies of late-onset 
epilepsy, which means that it carries a risk of later progression to dementia 
and that it can only be diagnosed by assessing amyloid and tau biomarkers. 
However, evAD is a window of therapeutic opportunity that is probably optimal 
for preventing, through antiseizure medication treatment, the accelerated 
cognitive decline associated with AD-related brain hyperexcitability (manifested 
by seizures or interictal epileptiform activities).

BACKGROUND: Chronic noise exposure poses a remarkable public health concern, 
drawing attention to its impacts on the brain. Ferroptosis is involved in 
several brain-related diseases. However, the role of ferroptosis in the effects 
of chronic noise on the brain remains elusive. This study aimed to investigate 
the effects of chronic noise exposure on the brain and elucidate the underlying 
mechanisms.
METHODS: A chronic noise-induced cognitive impairment model in rats was 
constructed and validated. The pathological state and ferroptosis level of the 
rat hippocampus were determined using Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. 
Bioinformatics was employed to investigate the interrelationship between chronic 
noise exposure and genes. Genetic relationships were analyzed using Mendelian 
randomization (MR) analysis. Cytoscape was employed for the prediction of 
upstream molecular and drug targets.
RESULTS: In vivo experiments revealed that chronic noise exposure could induce 
Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like neuropathological changes in rat hippocampus and 
cognitive impairment. Moreover, protein markers indicative of ferroptosis and 
levels of lipid peroxidation were quantified to elucidate underlying mechanisms. 
Thereafter, oxidative stress- and ferroptosis-related differentially expressed 
genes (DEGs) underwent functional enrichment and PPI network analyses. 
Additionally, 8 genes with diagnostic significance were identified. In MR 
analysis, retinoic acid receptor responder 2 (Rarres2) gene exhibited a negative 
genetic relationship with AD.
CONCLUSIONS: Chronic noise exposure could induce AD-like neuropathological 
changes and cognitive impairment via ferroptosis. The results of MR analysis 
indicated that Rarres2 gene may act as a protective factor in AD. This gene may 
be upstream of ferroptosis and serve as a target for the prevention and 
treatment of chronic noise-induced cognitive impairment.

Dementia is an umbrella term for multiple conditions that lead to progressive 
cognitive decline and impaired activities of daily living. Neuropsychological 
evaluation is essential for characterizing the distinct cognitive and behavioral 
profile that can aid in the diagnostic process and treatment planning for 
dementia. Modifiable risk factors for dementia such as nutrition, physical 
activity, sleep, cognitive and social engagement, and stress provide important 
avenues for prevention. Neurologists and other health care providers can help 
patients reduce their risk for dementia by providing them with education about 
modifiable factors and connecting them to resources to empower them to engage in 
brain-healthy behavior.

BACKGROUND: Microbiome dysbiosis plays a significant role in neuroinflammation 
and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, gut microbiome restoration using 
appropriate probiotics may be beneficial in alleviating AD features. In this 
study, we investigated the effects of a domestic strain of Lactobacillus 
rhamnosus (L. rhamnosus) on spatial memory, and cytokines expression in an 
inflammation-based AD model.
METHOD: Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups (six animals per 
group) of control, L. rhamnosus-only, D-galactose (D-gal)-only, and D-gal + L. 
rhamnosus. Spatial learning and memory were assessed using the Morris water maze 
test. IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α expression levels were measured using Real-Time 
qPCR. A significance level of 0.05 was used for statistical analysis.
RESULTS: In contrast to the D-gal + L. rhamnosus-treated group, D-gal only 
treated group showed impaired memory in MWM test compared to the control group. 
Additionally, D-gal treatment resulted in an increase in IL-1β and TNF-α levels 
and a decrease in IL-6 levels, which was not statistically significant. However, 
the TNF-α level was significantly decreased in D-gal + L. rhamnosus-treated 
group compared to D-gal-only treated group (P < 0.05). Also, IL-6 level was 
significantly lower in D-gal + L. rhamnosus-treated group compared to control 
group (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the domestic L. rhamnosus might 
positively impact cognitive deficit and neuroinflammation. Further studies are 
suggested to investigate the specific mechanisms mediating the effects of L. 
rhamnosus on cognitive functions and neuroinflammation in animal models of AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative disorder characterised by 
amyloid-beta aggregates activated by the accumulation of lipid molecules and 
their derivatives, especially 7-ketocholesterol (7KCh), an oxidised lipid that 
plays a great part in the progression of AD. The current therapeutics need 
bio-potential molecules and their biomedical application preventing 7KCh-induced 
cytotoxicity. In this study, bornyl acetate (BA) and menthol (ME), the natural 
monoterpenes were investigated for their neuroprotective effects against 
7KCh-induced SH-SY5Y cells and their effects were compared to the standard drug 
galantamine (GA). 7KCh-induced changes like lipid accumulation, amyloid 
generation, free radical generation, acetylcholinesterase levels, calcium 
accumulation and mitochondrial membrane integrity were analysed in SH-SY5Y cells 
with or without BA and ME treatment. Furthermore, various mediators involved in 
the amyloidogenic, inflammatory and apoptotic pathways were studied. In our 
results, the cells induced with 7KCh upon co-treatment with BA and ME 
significantly reduced lipid accumulation and amyloid generation through 
toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 suppression and enhanced ATP binding cassette (ABCA) 
1-mediated clearance. Co-treatment with BA and ME concurrently regulated 
oxidative stress, acetylcholinesterase activity, mitochondrial membrane 
potential and intracellular calcification altered by 7KCh-induced SH-SY5Y cells. 
Moreover, 7KCh-induced cells showed elevated mRNA levels of misfolded protein 
markers and apoptotic mediators which were significantly downregulated by BA and 
ME co-treatment. In addition, the protein expression of amyloidogenic, 
proinflammatory as well as pro-apoptotic markers was decreased by BA and ME 
co-treatment in 7KCh-induced cells. Overall, BA and ME mediated inhibition of 
amyloidogenic activation and cell survival against 7KCh-induced inflammation, 
thereby preventing the onset and progression of AD in comparison to GA.

Microglia are essential in neurogenesis, synaptic pruning, and homeostasis. 
Nevertheless, aging, and cellular senescence may modify their role, causing them 
to shift from being shields to being players of neurodegeneration. In the aging 
brain, the population of microglia increases, followed by enhanced activity of 
genes related to neuroinflammation. This change increases their ability to cause 
inflammation, resulting in a long-lasting state of inflammation in the brain 
that harms the condition of neurons. In Alzheimer's Disease (AD), microglia are 
located inside amyloid plaques and exhibit an inflammatory phenotype 
characterized by a diminished ability to engulf and remove waste material, 
worsening the illness's advancement. Genetic polymorphisms in TREM2, APOE, and 
CD33 highlight the significant impact of microglial dysfunction in AD. This 
review examines therapeutic approaches that aim to address microglial 
dysfunction, such as enhancing the microglial capability to engulf and remove 
amyloid-β clumps and regulating microglial metabolism and mitochondrial 
activity. Microglial transplanting and reprogramming advancements show the 
potential to restore their ability to reduce inflammation. Although there has 
been notable advancement, there are still voids in our knowledge of microglial 
biology, including their relationships with other brain cells. Further studies 
should prioritize the improvement of human AD models, establish standardized 
methods for characterizing microglia, and explore how various factors influence 
microglial responses. It is essential to tackle these problems to create 
effective treatment plans that focus on reducing inflammation in the brain and 
protecting against damage in age-related neurodegenerative illnesses.

OBJECTIVE: Despite the substantial need for reliable and valid assessment of 
functional ability in older adults, there is currently limited research on the 
emergence of early functional declines during prodromal dementia stages, such as 
subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). This 
study uses novel performance-based assessments to characterize subtle, yet 
clinically meaningful, changes in functional ability.
METHOD: A sample of 93 older adults classified as cognitively unimpaired (CU; 
n = 30, Mage = 73.57 ± 6.66), SCD (n = 34, Mage = 72.56 ± 6.43), or MCI (n = 29, 
Mage = 78.28 ± 7.55) underwent neuropsychological testing along with an 
informant-rated daily functional skills measure (Assessment of Functional 
Capacity Interview). Participants also completed the Night Out Task (NOT), an 
open-ended performance-based measure of functional assessment, and the Financial 
Capacity Instrument-Short Form (FCI-SF) that assesses financial skills.
RESULTS: The MCI group performed worse on the NOT and FCI-SF relative to SCD and 
CU. NOT and FCI scores were associated with measures of global cognitive 
function, executive function, processing speed, language and memory, and FCI-SF 
overall score was correlated with informant-rated functional ability. The NOT 
and FCI-SF were also predictive of informant-reported daily functioning over and 
above traditional cognitive data and demographics.
CONCLUSIONS: Performance-based measures of IADL may allow for earlier detection 
of subtle functional changes that might not be adequately captured by 
traditional measures. The measurement of early functional changes is an 
important global outcome to evaluate the efficacy of interventions in dementia 
research.

BACKGROUND: China has the largest number of dementia patients worldwide. The 
prolonged course of dementia has a serious negative impact on the economy and 
quality of life of patients and their families.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review and 
meta-analysis of the existing literature about economic burden and quality of 
life of people with dementia in China.
METHODS: Six databases were systematically searched for observational studies of 
the economic burden or quality of life of dementia that were published before 
June 30, 2024. This review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines.
RESULTS: A total of 36,411 papers were identified, and 21 studies met the 
inclusion criteria. The annual economic burden of dementia was 20,893 RMB (3,104 
USD). The total costs associated with mild, moderate, and severe dementia were 
16,619 RMB (2,469 USD), 22,283 RMB (3,311 USD), and 34,611 RMB (5,143 USD), 
respectively, indicating that the cost increased significantly with increasing 
dementia severity. In terms of the quality of life, the combined total score for 
the Quality of Life-Alzheimer's Disease scale was 30.11, with lower scores for 
the Housekeeping, Recreation, and Memory items.
CONCLUSIONS: Dementia imposes a significant economic and quality of life burden 
on Chinese patients. The government should pay more attention to dementia and 
develop a comprehensive prevention and treatment system to reduce the heavy 
burden of dementia.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: This systematic review has the registration number 
CRD42022374470 on PROSPERO.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) associated with 
long-term use of topical glaucoma medications among middle-aged and older 
glaucoma patients, and compare the AD risk among various glaucoma subtypes.
METHODS: This nationwide population-based cohort study utilized insurance claims 
data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database between 2008 and 
2019. Participants were adults aged 45 years or older either with a diagnosis of 
glaucoma or without. Those with glaucoma must have received single 
antiglaucomatous medication (including α2-adrenergic agonists, cholinergic 
agonists, beta-blockers, prostaglandin analogs, and pilocarpine) for over 90 
days. Those with pre-existing AD diagnoses prior to the index date were 
excluded.
RESULTS: A total of 202,000 participants were included in the study, with 
101,000 in each group (glaucoma and control groups). Glaucoma patients on 
topical alpha-2 adrenergic agonist monotherapy exhibited a significantly higher 
AD risk (aHR 1.15, 95% CI = 1.01-1.31) compared to those on beta-blockers. 
Glaucoma was further categorized into primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), 
normal-tension glaucoma (NTG), primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG), and 
unspecified glaucoma. Irrespective of the type of glaucoma, individuals with 
glaucoma had a significantly higher risk of AD compared to those without 
glaucoma (POAG: aHR 1.23, 95% CI = 1.08-1.40; NTG: aHR 1.49, 95% CI = 1.19-1.85; 
PACG: aHR 1.35, 95% CI = 1.19-1.52; unspecified glaucoma: aHR 1.36, 95% 
CI = 1.23-1.50).
CONCLUSIONS: Topical alpha-2 adrenergic agonists might pose increased AD risk in 
individuals with glaucoma compared to beta-blockers. Accordingly, their 
utilization should be undertaken judiciously, especially in middle-aged and 
older populations. Our findings also indicate glaucoma may increase the risk of 
AD regardless of glaucoma subtype.

Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is a clinical syndrome that arises from 
cerebrovascular issues and associated risk factors, resulting in difficulties in 
at least one area of cognitive function. VCI has emerged as the second most 
prevalent type of dementia following Alzheimer's disease, yet there is no 
effective clinical treatment. Botch, an endogenous Notch1 antagonist, 
demonstrates neuroprotective effects by inhibiting neuroinflammatory responses 
mediated through the Notch pathway. While its role in stroke-induced 
neuroinflammation is well-established, its involvement in VCI remains largely 
unexplored. This study investigates the role and potential mechanisms of Botch 
in a rat model of cognitive impairment caused by bilateral common carotid artery 
occlusion (BCCAO). Firstly, we observed that Botch levels were down-regulated in 
BCCAO rats, which correlated with increased release of inflammatory cytokines 
and neuronal damage. Microglia in BCCAO rats released interleukin-1α (IL-1α), 
tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and complement component 1q (C1q), leading to 
the activation of neurotoxic C3+ A1 reactive astrocytes. Then, the 
down-regulation of Botch exacerbated microglia-mediated inflammation, activated 
C3+ A1 astrocytes, worsened neuronal damage, and led to a decline in cognitive 
function. Conversely, the re-expression of Botch alleviated C3+ astrocyte 
activation, inhibited neuronal damage, and improved mental function. In 
conclusion, Botch plays a crucial role in inhibiting neuroinflammation induced 
by type A1 reactive astrocytes. It achieves this by blocking the activation of 
microglia triggered by the Notch pathway. Ultimately, it inhibits neuronal 
damage to play a neuroprotective role. These findings suggest that Botch may 
represent a novel potential target for treating VCI.

Cerebellar dysfunction is increasingly recognized as a critical factor in 
various neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's 
disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Research has revealed 
distinct cerebellar atrophy patterns in conditions such as AD and multiple 
system atrophy, and studies in mice have highlighted its impact on motor control 
and cognitive functions. Emerging research into autism spectrum disorder (ASD) 
has identified key targets, such as elevated levels of chemokine receptors and 
ZIC family genes. Biomarkers, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), genetic 
markers, and advances in AI and bioinformatics, are enhancing early diagnosis 
and personalized treatment across neurodegenerative disorders. Notable 
advancements include improved diagnostic tools, gene therapy, and novel clinical 
trials. Despite progress, challenges such as the bloodbrain barrier and 
neuroinflammation persist. Current therapies for AD, PD, HD, and ALS, including 
antisense oligonucleotides and stem cell treatments, show promise but require 
further investigation. A comprehensive approach that integrates diagnostic 
methods and innovative therapies is essential for effective management and 
improved patient outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of a cognitive-motor rehabilitation program 
consisting of treadmill training (TT) augmented by virtual reality (TT+VR) on 
frailty in people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS).
DESIGN: Secondary analysis from a multicenter randomized controlled trial 
investigating the effects of TT+VR, compared with TT only, on measures of 
mobility and cognitive function in pwMS.
SETTING: Four university research laboratories in 3 countries.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 124 pwMS were randomized into the parent trial. Here, 
we studied a subset of n = 83 participants (mean age, 49.4±9.3y; 73.5% female; 
expanded disability status scale range, 2.0-6.0), who completed the intervention 
and had complete preintervention and postintervention frailty data.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly allocated to TT+VR (n=44) or TT 
(n=39). Both groups trained 3 times a week for 6 weeks.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Frailty was assessed using a 40-item frailty index (FI) 
through standard validated procedures and represented the primary study outcome. 
Two exploratory frailty indices were also computed by isolating health-related 
deficits involving the cognitive (FI-physical) or physical (FI-cognitive) 
domains from the main FI. The assessments were performed at baseline and after 6 
weeks, upon intervention completion.
RESULTS: The mean FI of study participants at baseline was 0.33±0.13, indicating 
a moderate average level of frailty. FI scores improved in both TT+VR and TT 
groups participants (pooled mean ΔFI, 0.024; 95% CI, 0.010-0.038; F=10.49; 
P=.002; ηp2=0.115), without any group-by-time interaction (F=0.82; P=.367; 
ηp2=0.010). However, a significant group-by-time interaction was found for 
pretraining and posttraining changes in FI-cognitive (F=5.74; P=.019; 
ηp2=0.066), suggesting a greater improvement for TT+VR group participants than 
for TT group participants.
CONCLUSIONS: TT with or without virtual reality can reduce frailty levels in 
pwMS. While both TT and TT+VR had a positive effect on overall frailty, only 
TT+VR improved cognitive aspects of frailty and may represent an appropriate 
strategy for counteracting frailty in pwMS.

Proper maintenance of intracellular vesicular pH is essential for cargo 
trafficking during synaptic function and plasticity. Mutations in the SLC9A6 
gene encoding the recycling endosomal pH regulator (Na+, K+)/H+ exchanger 
isoform 6 (NHE6) are causal for Christianson syndrome (CS), a severe form of 
X-linked intellectual disability. NHE6 expression is also downregulated in other 
neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, such as autism spectrum 
disorder and Alzheimer's disease, suggesting its dysfunction could contribute 
more broadly to the pathophysiology of other neurological conditions. To 
understand how ablation of NHE6 function leads to severe learning impairments, 
we assessed synaptic structure, function, and cellular mechanisms of learning in 
a novel line of Nhe6 knockout (KO) mice expressing a plasma membrane-tethered 
green fluorescent protein within hippocampal neurons. We uncovered significant 
reductions in dendritic spines density, AMPA receptor (AMPAR) expression, and 
AMPAR-mediated neurotransmission in CA1 pyramidal neurons. The neurons also 
failed to undergo functional and structural enhancement during long-term 
potentiation (LTP). Significantly, the selective TrkB agonist 
7,8-dihydroxyflavone restored spine density as well as functional and structural 
LTP in KO neurons. TrkB activation thus may act as a potential clinical 
intervention to ameliorate cognitive deficits in CS and other neurodegenerative 
disorders.

BACKGROUND: Numerous studies have examined the association between 
neuroprotective diets and cognitive function during aging; however, these 
studies have produced divergent findings. Some studies find that greater 
adherence to these dietary patterns is associated with preserved cognition, 
whereas others find no effect.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the association of the 
Mediterranean, the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH), and 
Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegeneration Delay (MIND) dietary 
patterns with global cognition over 4 waves of data from the Health and 
Retirement Study, a longitudinal panel study conducted at the University of 
Michigan.
DESIGN: This is a longitudinal secondary data analysis using Health and 
Retirement Study data drawn from the Food Frequency Questionnaire completed as 
part of the Health Care and Nutrition Survey administered in 2013 to 2014, 
neuropsychological assessment data obtained from the Core questionnaire in 2014, 
2016, 2018, and 2020, and demographic data from the Core questionnaire in 2014.
PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: Participants with total daily energy intake below 600 or 
800 kcal and above 6000 and 8000 kcal for women and men, respectively, were 
excluded based on criteria from a similar study using the same dataset. In 
addition, participants with a diagnosis of dementia, Alzheimer disease, or 
stroke as of 2014 were excluded. There were 6154 participants in the 
Mediterranean diet and DASH diet analyses and 5143 participants in the MIND diet 
analyses.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: A global cognitive measure incorporating immediate and 
delayed recall, serial 7s, and backward counting scores was calculated for each 
participant at each wave.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The primary analyses examined the association between each 
diet type and cognition over 4 waves using separate multilevel models that 
controlled for age, gender, self-rated health, years of education, total energy 
intake, weekly exercise, and body mass index.
RESULTS: Mediterranean and DASH diet adherence were positively and significantly 
associated with baseline cognition and were associated with slower cognitive 
decline over a 6-year period. MIND diet adherence was positively and 
significantly correlated with baseline cognition but was not significantly 
associated with slower cognitive decline over a 6-year period. Cross-level 
interactions for adherence to each dietary pattern and cognitive change over 
time, computed with standardized diet scores, were as follows: Mediterranean 
diet (β = .03; P = .002), DASH diet (β = .04; P = .004), and MIND diet (β = .02; 
P = .094).
CONCLUSIONS: The Mediterranean, DASH, and MIND dietary patterns are associated 
with better cognitive performance at baseline and the Mediterranean and DASH 
diets were associated with slower cognitive decline over time. Adherence to the 
DASH diet had the greatest magnitude of association with baseline cognition and 
rate of cognitive change.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Dihuang Yinzi (DHYZ) is a classic prescription 
in traditional Chinese medicine. Its therapeutic effect on Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) has been widely validated. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of 
DHYZ in AD treatment remain unclear and require further research.
AIM OF THE STUDY: Elucidating DHYZ's promotion of mitochondrial biogenesis 
through the AMPK/SIRT1/PGC-1α pathway improves neuronal loss, mitochondrial 
damage, and memory deficits in AD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Administering DHYZ by gavage to SAMP8 mice, after 
completing behavioral tests, the effects of DHYZ on hippocampal neuron loss and 
mitochondrial structural damage in AD model mice were assessed using Nissl 
staining and transmission electron microscopy. Western blot was used to detect 
the expression of mitochondrial biogenesis-related proteins PGC-1α, CREB, 
mitochondrial fusion protein MFN2, and mitochondrial fission proteins DRP1 and 
FIS1. At the same time, immunofluorescence (IF) was employed to measure the 
relative fluorescence intensity of mitochondrial fusion protein MFN1. After 
determining the optimal dose of DYHZ for treating AD, we conducted mechanistic 
studies. By intraperitoneally injecting SAMP8 mice with the AMPK inhibitor 
(Compound C) to inhibit AMPK protein expression and subsequently treating them 
with DHYZ, the impact of DHYZ on hippocampal neurons in AD model mice was 
evaluated using Nissl and hematoxylin-eosin staining. Western blot was used to 
detect the protein expression of AMPK, p-AMPK, SIRT1, PGC-1α, NRF1, and TFAM. In 
contrast, IF was used to measure the relative fluorescence intensity of PGC-1α, 
NRF1, and TFAM proteins in the hippocampal CA1 region.
RESULTS: DHYZ significantly improved AD model mice's cognitive impairment and 
memory deficits and mitigated hippocampal neuron loss and degeneration. 
Additionally, it ameliorated mitochondrial morphological structures. DHYZ 
upregulated the protein expression of mitochondrial biogenesis-related proteins 
PGC-1α, CREB, and mitochondrial fusion proteins MFN1 and MFN2 while inhibiting 
the expression of mitochondrial fission proteins DRP1 and FIS1. Further studies 
revealed that DHYZ could upregulate the expression of the AMPK/SIRT1/PGC-1α 
pathway proteins and their downstream proteins NRF1 and TFAM.
CONCLUSION: DHYZ promotes mitochondrial biogenesis by activating the 
AMPK/SIRT1/PGC-1α signaling pathway, thereby improving memory deficits, neuronal 
loss, and mitochondrial dysfunction in AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) typically do not exhibit 
distinct differences in clinical manifestations and auxiliary examination 
results, which leads to a high misdiagnosis rate. However, significant 
differences in treatment approaches and prognosis between these two diseases 
underscore the critical need for an accurate diagnosis of AD and VaD. In this 
study, serum samples from 33 patients with AD patients, 37 patients with VaD, 
and 130 healthy individuals were collected, employing near-infrared 
aquaphotomics technology in combination with deep learning for differential 
diagnoses. Through an analysis of water absorption patterns among different 
diseases via aquaphotomics, the efficacies of traditional machine learning 
methods (Support Vector Machine and Decision Trees) and deep learning approaches 
(Deep Forest) in modeling were compared. Ultimately, by leveraging feature 
extraction techniques in conjunction with deep learning, a differential 
diagnostic model for AD and VaD was successfully developed. The results revealed 
that aquaphotomics could identify a certain correlation between the number of 
hydrogen bonds in water molecules and the development of AD and VaD; the deep 
learning model was found to be superior to traditional machine learning models, 
achieving an accuracy of 98.67 %, sensitivity of 97.33 %, and specificity of 
100.00 %. The bands identified using the Competitive Adaptive Reweighting 
Algorithm method, primarily located at approximately 1300-1500 nm, showed a 
significant correlation with water molecules containing four hydrogen bonds. 
These results highlighted the potential role of the water molecule hydrogen-bond 
network in disease development and were consistent with the aquaphotomics 
analysis results. Therefore, the differential diagnostic model developed by 
integrating near-infrared spectroscopy and deep learning was proven to be 
effective and feasible, providing accurate and rapid diagnostic methods for AD 
and VaD diagnoses.

The neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's 
disease (PD), Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease (HD) and 
Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), present an enormous medical, social, financial 
and scientific problem. Despite intense research into the causes of these 
disorders, only marginal progress has been made in the clinic and no cures exist 
for any of them. Most of the scientific effort has been focused on 
identification of the major causes of these diseases and on developing ways to 
target them, such as targeting amyloid accumulation for AD or targeting 
expression of mutant Huntingtin for HD. Calcium (Ca2+) signaling has long been 
proposed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative 
disorders, but blockers of Ca2+ channels and Ca2+ signaling proteins have not 
been translated to clinic primarily due to side effects related to the important 
roles of target molecules for these compounds at the peripheral tissues. In this 
review article, we would like to discuss an idea that recently identified 
positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum calcium 
(SERCA) pump may provide a promising approach to develop therapeutic compounds 
for treatment of these disorders. This hypothesis is supported by the 
preclinical data obtained with animal models of AD and PD. The first critical 
test of this idea will be an imminent phase I study that will offer an 
opportunity to evaluate potential side effects of this class of compounds in 
humans.

Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) are characterized by the progressive loss of 
neurons. As to developing effective therapeutic interventions, it is crucial to 
understand the underlying mechanisms of NDs. Cellular models have become 
invaluable tools for studying the complex pathogenesis of NDs, offering insights 
into disease mechanisms, determining potential therapeutic targets, and aiding 
in drug discovery. This review provides a comprehensive overview of various 
cellular models used in ND research, focusing on Alzheimer's disease, 
Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. 
Cell lines, such as SH-SY5Y and PC12 cells, have emerged as valuable tools due 
to their ease of use, reproducibility, and scalability. Additionally, co-culture 
models, involving the growth of distinct cell types like neurons and astrocytes 
together, are highlighted for simulating brain interactions and 
microenvironment. While cell lines cannot fully replicate the complexity of the 
human brain, they provide a scalable method for examining important aspects of 
neurodegenerative diseases. Advancements in cell line technologies, including 
the incorporation of patient-specific genetic variants and improved co-culture 
models, hold promise for enhancing our understanding and expediting the 
development of effective treatments. Integrating multiple cellular models and 
advanced technologies offers the potential for significant progress in 
unraveling the intricacies of these debilitating diseases and improving patient 
outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Few studies have analyzed sensor-derived metrics of mobility 
abilities and total daily physical activity (TDPA). We tested whether 
sensor-derived mobility metrics and TDPA indices are independently associated 
with mobility disabilities.
METHODS: This cohort study derived mobility abilities from a belt-worn sensor 
that recorded annual supervised gait testing. TDPA indices were obtained from a 
wrist-worn activity monitor. Mobility disability was determined by self-report 
and inability to perform an 8-feet walk task. Baseline associations of mobility 
metrics and TDPA (separately and together) were examined with logistic 
regressions and incident associations (average 7 years follow-up) with Cox 
models. Mediation analysis quantified the extent mobility metrics mediate the 
association of TDPA with mobility disability.
RESULTS: 724 ambulatory older adults (mean age 82 years, 77.4% female) were 
studied. In separate models, mobility abilities (eg, step time variability, 
turning angular velocity) and TDPA were related to mobility disabilities. 
Examined together in a single model, mobility abilities remained associated with 
mobility disabilities, while TDPA was attenuated. This attenuation of TDPA could 
be explained by mediation analysis that showed about 50% of TDPA associations 
with mobility disabilities is mediated via mobility abilities (prevalent 
mobility disability 54%, incident mobility disability 40%, incident loss of 
ambulation 50%; all p's < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: Sensor-derived mobility metrics assess more diverse facets of 
mobility. These metrics mediate approximately half of the association of higher 
levels of daily physical activity with reduced mobility disability in older 
adults. Findings may inform the design of targeted interventions to reduce 
mobility disability in late life.

Background: Dementia does not merely affect individuals, the carer and the 
person living with dementia, but also has a profound impact on their spousal 
relationship. As such, this study aimed to gain a deeper understanding of how 
dementia affects spousal relationships with a focus on interpersonal (i.e. 
relationship adjustment, communication engagement and emotional connection 
between two individuals) and intrapersonal (i.e. loss of self within the context 
of relationships) dynamics using a qualitative approach. The study also explored 
how carers adapt to such relationship challenges in the context of dementia 
care.Methods: A phenomenological approach was used to capture the subjective 
experiences of female spousal carers, who regularly support their partner living 
with dementia. A total of nine semi-structured interviews were 
conducted.Results: Relationship adjustment theme highlighted how learning to 
acknowledge role shifts from a spouse to a carer is critical for carers to 
manage relationship difficulties. Emotional connection theme demonstrated the 
importance of reminiscing about the shared history between dyads to cope with 
feelings of loss of affective intimacy. Communication engagement theme revealed 
carers' need to learn a new way of communicating due to the decrease in 
meaningful communication and two-way interaction. Sense of self theme 
highlighted the importance of self-compassion to overcome feelings of self-loss 
and isolation.Conclusion: Findings suggest that improving the relationship 
between female spousal carers and their partner living with dementia may require 
targeted interventions addressing different factors. Such interventions can 
include a couple's life story approach to enable couples to reminisce about 
their shared experiences, interactive communication training to enhance 
meaningful engagements, and a psychological approach such as compassion-focused 
therapy to overcome emotional challenges and facilitate self-compassion.

Neurodegenerative diseases (ND) give rise to significant declines in motor, 
autonomic, behavioral, and cognitive functions. Of these conditions, Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are the most prevalent, impacting over 
55 million people worldwide. Given the staggering financial toll on the global 
economy and their widespread manifestation, NDs represent a critical issue for 
healthcare systems worldwide. Current treatment options merely seek to provide 
symptomatic relief or slow the rate of functional decline and remain financially 
inaccessible to many patients. Indeed, no therapy has yet demonstrated the 
potential to halt the trajectory of NDs, let alone reverse them. It is now 
recognized that brain accumulation of pathological variants of AD- or 
PD-associated proteins (i.e., amyloid-β, Tau, α-synuclein) begins years to 
decades before the onset of clinical symptoms. Accordingly, there is an urgent 
need to pursue therapies that prevent the neurodegenerative processes associated 
with pathological protein aggregation long before a clinical diagnosis can be 
made. These therapies must be safe, convenient, and affordable to ensure broad 
coverage in at-risk populations. Based on the need to intervene long before 
clinical symptoms appear, in this review, we present a rationale for greater 
investment to support the development of active immunotherapy for the prevention 
of the two most common NDs based on their safety profile, ability to 
specifically target pathological proteins, as well as the significantly lower 
costs associated with manufacturing and distribution, which stands to expand 
accessibility to millions of people globally.

The incidence of neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's or Parkinson's 
Disease, characterized by a progressive cognitive decline, is rising worldwide. 
Despite the considerable efforts to unveil the neuropsychological bases of these 
diseases, there is still an unmet medical need for effective therapies against 
cognitive deficits. In recent years, increasing laboratory evidence indicates 
the potential of phytotherapy as an integrative aid to improve cognitive 
functions. In this review, we describe the data of plant whole extracts or 
single compounds' efficacy on validated preclinical models and 
neuropsychological tests, aiming to correlate brain mechanisms underlying rodent 
behavioral responses to human findings. After a search of the literature, the 
overview was limited to the following plants: Dioscorea batatas, Ginkgo biloba, 
Melissa officinalis, Nigella sativa, Olea europaea, Panax ginseng, Punica 
granatum, and Vitis vinifera. Results showed significant improvements in 
different cognitive functions, such as learning and memory or visuospatial 
abilities, in both humans and rodents. However, despite promising laboratory 
evidence, clinical translation has been dampened by a limited pharmacological 
characterization of the single bioactive components of the herbal products. 
Depicting the contribution of the single phytochemicals to the phytocomplex's 
pharmacological efficacy could enable the comprehension of their potential 
synergistic activity, leading to phytotherapy inclusion in the existing 
therapeutic package against cognitive decline.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by the 
formation of amyloid β and tau protein aggregates in the brain, 
neuroinflammation, impaired cholinergic neurotransmission, and oxidative stress, 
resulting in the gradual loss of neurons and neuronal function, which leads to 
cognitive and memory deficits in AD patients. Chronic neuroinflammation plays a 
particularly important role in the progression of AD since the excessive release 
of proinflammatory cytokines from glial cells (microglia and astrocytes) induces 
neuronal damage, which subsequently causes microglial activation, thus 
facilitating further neurodegenerative changes. Mitogen-activated protein kinase 
(MAPK) p38α is one of the key enzymes involved in the control of innate immune 
response. The increased activation of the p38α MAPK pathway, observed in AD, has 
been for a long time associated not only with the maintenance of excessive 
inflammatory process but is also linked with pathophysiological hallmarks of 
this disease, and therefore is currently considered an attractive drug target 
for novel AD therapeutics. This review aims to summarize the current state of 
knowledge about the involvement of p38α MAPK in different aspects of AD 
pathophysiology and also provides insight into the possible therapeutic effects 
of novel p38α MAPK inhibitors, which are currently studied as potential drug 
candidates for AD treatment.

Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) are remnants of ancient retroviral 
infections that, over millions of years, became integrated into the human 
genome. While normally inactive, environmental stimuli such as infections have 
contributed to the transcriptional reactivation of HERV-promoting pathological 
conditions, including the development of autoimmunity, neurodegenerative disease 
and cancer. What infections trigger HERV activation? Mycobacterium avium 
subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) is a pluripotent driver of human disease. 
Aside from granulomatous diseases, Crohn's disease, sarcoidosis and Blau 
syndrome, MAP is associated with autoimmune disease: type one diabetes (T1D), 
multiple sclerosis (MS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and autoimmune thyroiditis. 
MAP is also associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease 
(PD). Autoimmune diabetes, MS and RA are the diseases with the strongest 
MAP/HERV association. There are several other diseases associated with HERV 
activation, including diseases whose epidemiology and/or pathology would prompt 
speculation for a causal role of MAP. These include non-solar uveal melanoma, 
colon cancer, glioblastoma and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This article 
further points to MAP infection as a contributor to autoimmunity, 
neurodegenerative disease and cancer via the un-silencing of HERV. We examine 
the link between the ever-increasing number of MAP-associated diseases and the 
MAP/HERV intersection with these diverse medical conditions, and propose 
treatment opportunities based upon this association.

Plants of the genus Tribulus have been used in folk medicine for wound healing, 
alleviating liver, stomach, and rheumatism pains, and as cognitive enhancers, 
sedatives, antiseptics, tonics, and stimulants. The present work aimed to 
evaluate whether Tribulus terrestris (Tt) administered for 15 days attenuated 
cognitive deficits and exhibited anxiolytic and antidepressant profiles in 
scopolamine-induced amnesia in zebrafish. Animals were randomly divided into six 
groups (eight animals per group): (1)-(3) Tt treatment groups (1, 3 and 6 mg/L), 
(4) control, (5) scopolamine (SCOP, 0.7 mg/kg), and (6) galantamine (Gal, 1 
mg/L). Exposure to SCOP (100 µM) resulted in anxiety in zebrafish, as assessed 
by the novel tank diving test (NTT) and novel approach test (NAT). When 
zebrafish were given SCOP and simultaneously given Tt (1, 3, and 6 mg/L once 
daily for 10 days), the deficits were averted. Molecular interactions of 
chemical compounds from the Tt fractions with the monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) 
were investigated via molecular docking experiments. Using behavioral 
experiments, we showed that administration of Tt induces significant 
anxiolytic-antidepressant-like effects in SCOP-treated zebrafish. Our result 
indicated that flavonoids of Tt, namely kaempferol, quercetin, luteolin, 
apigetrin, and epigallocatechin, could act as promising phytopharmaceuticals for 
improving anxiety-related disorders.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most predominant cause of dementia, considered a 
progressive decline in cognitive function that ultimately leads to death. AD has 
posed a substantial challenge in the records of medical science over the past 
century, representing a predominant etiology of dementia with a high prevalence 
rate. Neuroinflammation is a common characteristic of various central nervous 
system (CNS) pathologies like AD, primarily mediated by specialized brain immune 
and inflammatory cells, such as astrocytes and microglia. The present study aims 
to elucidate the potential mechanism of physcion that mitigates LPS-induced 
gliosis and assesses oxidative stress in mice. Physcion reduced the reactivity 
of Iba-1- and GFAP-positive cells and decreased the level of inflammatory 
cytokines like TNF-α and IL-1β. Physcion also reversed the effect of LPS-induced 
oxidative stress by upregulating the expression of Nrf2 and HO-1. Moreover, 
physcion treatment reversed LPS-induced synaptic disorder by increasing the 
level of presynaptic protein SNAP-23 and postsynaptic protein PSD-95. Our 
findings may provide a contemporary theoretical framework for clinical 
investigations aimed at examining the pathogenic mechanisms and therapeutic 
approaches for neuroinflammation and AD.

Considering the complex pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the 
multi-target ligand strategy is expected to provide superior effects for the 
treatment of the neurological disease compared to the classic single target 
strategy. Thus, one novel pyrrole-based hydrazide (vh0) and four corresponding 
hydrazide-hydrazones (vh1-4) were synthesized by applying highly efficient 
MW-assisted synthetic protocols. The synthetic pathway provided excellent yields 
and reduced reaction times under microwave conditions compared to conventional 
heating. The biological assays indicated that most of the novel pyrroles are 
selective MAO-B inhibitors with IC50 in the nanomolar range (665 nM) and 
moderate AChE inhibitors. The best dual-acting MAO-B/AChE inhibitor 
(IC50hMAOB-0.665 μM; IC50eeAChE-4.145 μM) was the unsubstituted pyrrole-based 
hydrazide (vh0). Importantly, none of the novel molecules displayed 
hMAOA-blocking capacities. The radical-scavenging properties of the compounds 
were examined using DPPH and ABTS in vitro tests. Notably, the hydrazide vh0 
demonstrated the best antioxidant activities. In addition, in silico simulations 
using molecular docking and MM/GBSA, targeting the AChE (PDB ID: 4EY6) and MAO-B 
(PDB: 2V5Z), were utilized to obtain active conformations and to optimize the 
most prominent dual inhibitor (vh0). The ADME and in vitro PAMPA studies 
demonstrated that vh0 could cross the blood-brain barrier, and it poses good 
lead-like properties. Moreover, the optimized molecular structures and the 
frontier molecular orbitals were examined via DFT studies at 6-311G basis set in 
the ground state.

Memantine, a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, is used to treat 
Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, loading memantine in nanoparticles (NPs) could 
be an essential tool to improve the treatment effectiveness while reducing drug 
toxicity. Even though some approaches have been described to quantify memantine, 
none reported optimized methods using high-performance liquid chromatography 
resorting to ultraviolet detection (UV-HPLC) to determine encapsulation in NPs. 
The present research developed a HPLC method using pre-column derivatization for 
quantitatively analyzing memantine hydrochloride in NPs. Memantine was 
derivatized using 9-fluorenylmethyl chloroformate (FMOC). The developed method 
was fully validated regarding suitability, specificity, linearity, sensitivity, 
precision, accuracy, and robustness according to the International Conference on 
Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for 
Human Use guidelines. The retention time of memantine was 11.393 ± 0.003 min, 
with a mean recovery of 92.9 ± 3.7%. The new chromatographic method was 
validated and found to respond linearly over 5-140 μg/mL, with a high 
coefficient of determination. Intraday precision lay between 3.6% and 4.6%, and 
interday precision between 4.2% and 9.3%. The stability of memantine was also 
tested at 4 °C and -20 °C, and no signs of decay were found for up to 6 months. 
The new method was properly validated and proved simple, sensitive, specific, 
accurate, and precise for determining memantine encapsulation efficiency in 
lipid NPs. Greenness was evaluated, presenting a final score of 0.45. In the 
future, this methodology could also be applied to quantify memantine in 
different nanoformulations.

This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of vortioxetine for improving 
depressive symptoms, cognitive performance, daily and global functioning in 
patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) in 
real-world clinical practice. We retrospectively identified 46 AD patients who 
had received treatment for 12 months with vortioxetine. Drug effects were 
evaluated at baseline, 4, 8, and 12 months. The primary endpoint was change from 
baseline in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and in the Cornell Scale 
for Depression in Dementia (CSDD) to month 12. Cognitive and daily and global 
functioning changes were also evaluated. Significant baseline-to-endpoint 
improvement in depressive symptom severity was observed (p < 0.0001). At month 
12, the least-square mean (standard error) change score from baseline was -10.48 
(±0.42) on the HDRS and -9.04 (±0.62) on the CSDD. Significant improvements in 
cognitive performance were observed for the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, 
the Symbol Digit Modalities Test, the Letter Fluency Test, the Category Fluency 
Test, and the Trail Making Test-A. Patients also experienced significant 
improvements in daily and global functioning. Vortioxetine was safe and well 
tolerated. Patients with AD and MDD receiving vortioxetine showed meaningful 
improvements in depressive symptoms, cognitive performance, and daily and global 
functioning over the 12-month treatment period.

Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE) is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by 
recurrent focal seizures originating in the temporal lobe. Despite the variety 
of antiseizure drugs currently available to treat TLE, about 30% of cases 
continue to have seizures. The etiology of TLE is complex and multifactorial. 
Increasing evidence indicates that Alzheimer's disease (AD) and drug-resistant 
TLE present common pathological features that may induce hyperexcitability, 
especially aberrant hyperphosphorylation of tau protein. Genetic polymorphic 
variants located in genes of the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) and 
glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3B) have been associated with the risk of 
developing AD. The APOE ε4 allele is a major genetic risk factor for AD. 
Likewise, a gene-dose-dependent effect of ε4 seems to influence TLE. The present 
study aimed to investigate whether the APOE ɛ4 allele and genetic variants 
located in the MAPT and GSK3B genes are associated with the risk of developing 
AD and drug-resistant TLE in a cohort of the Mexican population. A significant 
association with the APOE ε4 allele was observed in patients with AD and TLE. 
Additional genetic interactions were identified between this allele and variants 
of the MAPT and GSK3B genes.

Salvia leucantha is a perennial herb of the genus Salvia in the family Labiatae, 
which has a wide range of biological activities, mainly including inhibition of 
acetylcholinesterase, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory activity. To explore 
the protective effects and mechanism of action of S. leucantha on Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), the anti-AD activity of SLE (extracts of S. leucantha) was 
determined by using a transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) model 
(CL4176). Analyses included paralysis assay, phenotypic experiments, 
transcriptome sequencing, RNA interference (RNAi), heat shock assays, and gas 
chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). SLPE (S. leucantha petroleum ether 
extract) could significantly delay CL4176 paralysis and extend the longevity of 
C. elegans N2 without harmful effects. A total of 927 genes were significantly 
changed by SLPE treatment in C. elegans, mainly involving longevity regulatory 
pathways-nematodes, drug metabolism-cytochrome P450, and glutathione metabolic 
pathways. RNAi showed that SLPE exerted its anti-AD activity through 
up-regulation of the gene gst-5; the most abundant compound in SLPE analyzed by 
GC-MS was 2,4-Di-tert-butylphenol (2,4-DTBP), and the compound delayed nematode 
paralysis. The present study suggests that active components in S. leucantha may 
serve as new-type anti-AD candidates and provide some insights into their 
biological functions.

Neurodegenerative diseases are the leading cause of human disability and 
immensely reduce patients' life span and quality. The diseases are characterized 
by the functional loss of neuronal cells and share several common pathogenic 
mechanisms involving the malfunction, structural distortion, or aggregation of 
multiple key regulatory proteins. Cellular phase separation is the formation of 
biomolecular condensates that regulate numerous biological processes, including 
neuronal development and synaptic signaling transduction. Aberrant phase 
separation may cause protein aggregation that is a general phenomenon in the 
neuronal cells of patients suffering neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, 
we summarize the pathological causes of common neurodegenerative diseases, 
including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease, 
among others. We discuss the regulation of key amyloidogenic proteins with an 
emphasis of their aberrant phase separation and aggregation. We also introduce 
the approaches as potential therapeutic strategies to ameliorate 
neurodegenerative diseases through intervening protein aggregation. Overall, 
this review consolidates the research findings of phase separation and 
aggregation caused by misfolded proteins in a context of neurodegenerative 
diseases.

Gut microbiota (GM), together with its metabolites (such as SCFA, tryptophan, 
dopamine, GABA, etc.), plays an important role in the functioning of the central 
nervous system. Various neurological and psychiatric disorders are associated 
with changes in the composition of GM and their metabolites, which puts them in 
the foreground as a potential adjuvant therapy. However, the molecular 
mechanisms behind this relationship are not clear enough. Therefore, before 
considering beneficial microbes and/or their metabolites as potential 
therapeutics for brain disorders, the mechanisms underlying microbiota-host 
interactions must be identified and characterized in detail. In this review, we 
summarize the current knowledge of GM alterations observed in prevalent 
neurological and psychiatric disorders, multiple sclerosis, major depressive 
disorder, Alzheimer's disease, and autism spectrum disorders, together with 
experimental evidence of their potential to improve patients' quality of life. 
We further discuss the main obstacles in the study of GM-host interactions and 
describe the state-of-the-art solution and trends in this field, namely 
"culturomics" which enables the culture and identification of novel bacteria 
that inhabit the human gut, and models of the gut and blood-brain barrier as 
well as the gut-brain axis based on induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and 
iPSC derivatives, thus pursuing a personalized medicine agenda for 
neuropsychiatric disorders.

The emerging role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in central nervous system 
(CNS) diseases is gaining significant interest, particularly their applications 
as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic agents. EVs are involved in 
intercellular communication and are secreted by all cell types. They contain 
specific markers and a diverse cargo such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic 
acids, reflecting the physiological and pathological state of their originating 
cells. Their reduced immunogenicity and ability to cross the blood-brain barrier 
make them promising candidates for both biomarkers and therapeutic agents. In 
the context of CNS diseases, EVs have shown promise as biomarkers isolable from 
different body fluids, providing a non-invasive method for diagnosing CNS 
diseases and monitoring disease progression. This makes them useful for the 
early detection and monitoring of diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, where specific alterations in EVs content can be 
detected. Additionally, EVs derived from stem cells show potential in promoting 
tissue regeneration and repairing damaged tissues. An evaluation has been 
conducted on the current clinical trials studying EVs for CNS diseases, focusing 
on their application, treatment protocols, and obtained results. This review 
aims to explore the potential of EVs as diagnostic markers and therapeutic 
carriers for CNS diseases, highlighting their significant advantages and ongoing 
clinical trials evaluating their efficacy.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common causes of dementia, 
accounting for more than 60% of all cases. It is a neurodegenerative disease in 
which symptoms such as a decline in memory, thinking, learning, and organizing 
skills develop gradually over many years and eventually become more severe. To 
date, there is no effective treatment for the cause of Alzheimer's disease, and 
the existing pharmacological options primarily help manage symptoms. Treatment 
is mainly based on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors such as donepezil, 
rivastigmine, and galantamine, which exhibit numerous adverse cardiovascular and 
gastrointestinal effects due to excessive stimulation of peripheral cholinergic 
activity involving muscarinic receptors. Therefore, in addition to the obvious 
drugs that act on the cause of the disease, new drugs based on AChE inhibition 
that show the fewest side effects are needed. One potential drug could be a new 
compound under study, tetrahydroacridine derivative (CHDA), which showed 
significant potential to inhibit the AChE enzyme in previous in vitro studies. 
The present study shows that while having very potent AChE inhibitory 
properties, CHDA is a compound with low toxicity to nerve cell culture and 
living organisms. In addition, it exhibits dissociative activity against amyloid 
β fibrils, which is extremely important for applications in Alzheimer's disease 
therapy.

Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are a diverse group of neurological disorders 
characterized by alterations in the structure and function of the central 
nervous system. Alzheimer's disease (AD), characterized by impaired memory and 
cognitive abilities, is the most prevalent type of senile dementia. Loss of 
synapses, intracellular aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, and 
extracellular amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) plaques are the hallmarks of AD. MicroRNAs 
(miRNAs/miRs) are single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules that bind to 
the 3' and 5' untranslated regions of target genes to cause post-transcriptional 
gene silencing. The brain expresses over 70% of all experimentally detected 
miRNAs, and these miRNAs are crucial for synaptic function and particular 
signals during memory formation. Increasing evidence suggests that miRNAs play a 
role in AD pathogenesis and we provide an overview of the role of miRNAs in 
synapse formation, Aβ synthesis, tau protein accumulation, and brain-derived 
neurotrophic factor-associated AD pathogenesis. We further summarize and discuss 
the role of miRNAs as potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers for AD 
detection and differentiation between early- and late-stage AD, based on recent 
research. In conclusion, altered expression of miRNAs in the brain and 
peripheral circulation demonstrates their potential as biomarkers and 
therapeutic targets in AD.

The present study analyzes two potential therapeutic approaches for Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). One is the suppression of the neuronal integrated stress response 
(ISR). Another is the targeted degradation of intraneuronal amyloid-beta (iAβ) 
via the activation of BACE1 (Beta-site Aβ-protein-precursor Cleaving Enzyme) 
and/or BACE2. Both approaches are rational. Both are promising. Both have 
substantial intrinsic limitations. However, when combined in a carefully 
orchestrated manner into a composite therapy they display a prototypical synergy 
and constitute the apparently optimal, potentially most effective therapeutic 
strategy for AD.

Histaminergic System Activity in the Central Nervous System: The Role in 
Neurodevelopmental and Neurodegenerative Disorders.

Sciences, Medical University of Warsaw, 02-004 Warsaw, Poland.

Histamine (HA), a biogenic monoamine, exerts its pleiotropic effects through 
four H1R-H4R histamine receptors, which are also expressed in brain tissue. 
Together with the projections of HA-producing neurons located within the 
tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN), which innervate most areas of the brain, they 
constitute the histaminergic system. Thus, while remaining a mediator of the 
inflammatory reaction and immune system function, HA also acts as a 
neurotransmitter and a modulator of other neurotransmitter systems in the 
central nervous system (CNS). Although the detailed causes are still not fully 
understood, neuroinflammation seems to play a crucial role in the 
etiopathogenesis of both neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative 
(neuropsychiatric) diseases, such as autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 
Parkinson's disease (PD). Given the increasing prevalence/diagnosis of these 
disorders and their socioeconomic impact, the need to develop effective forms of 
therapy has focused researchers' attention on the brain's histaminergic activity 
and other related signaling pathways. This review presents the current state of 
knowledge concerning the involvement of HA and the histaminergic system within 
the CNS in the development of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative 
disorders. To this end, the roles of HA in neurotransmission, neuroinflammation, 
and neurodevelopment are also discussed.

of Insulin Resistance, Neuroinflammation, and Acetylcholinesterase Activity in 
an Amyloid-β Rat Model.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by impaired insulin/insulin-like 
growth factor-1 signaling in the hippocampus. Zeaxanthin and lutein, known for 
their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, have been reported to 
protect against brain damage and cognitive decline. However, their mechanisms 
related to insulin signaling in AD remain unclear. This study investigated the 
efficacy and mechanisms of zeaxanthin, lutein, and resveratrol in modulating an 
AD-like pathology in an amyloid-β rat model. Rats were administered hippocampal 
infusions of 3.6 nmol/day amyloid-β (Aβ)(25-35) for 14 days to induce AD-like 
memory deficits (AD-CON). Normal control rats received Aβ(35-25) (Normal-CON). 
All rats had a high-fat diet. Daily, AD rats consumed 200 mg/kg body weight of 
zeaxanthin (AD-ZXT), lutein (AD-LTN), and resveratrol (AD-RVT; positive-control) 
or resistant dextrin as a placebo (AD-CON) for eight weeks. The AD-CON rats 
exhibited a higher Aβ deposition, attenuated hippocampal insulin signaling 
(reduced phosphorylation of protein kinase B [pAkt] and glycogen synthase 
kinase-3β [pGSK-3β]), increased neuroinflammation, elevated acetylcholinesterase 
activity, and memory deficits compared to the Normal-CON group. They also showed 
systemic insulin resistance and high hepatic glucose output. Zeaxanthin and 
lutein prevented memory impairment more effectively than the positive-control 
resveratrol by suppressing acetylcholinesterase activity, lipid peroxidation, 
and pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β). They also potentiated hippocampal 
insulin signaling and increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and 
ciliary neurotrophic factor (CTNF) mRNA expression to levels comparable to the 
Normal-CON rats. Additionally, zeaxanthin and lutein improved glucose disposal, 
reduced hepatic glucose output, and normalized insulin secretion patterns. In 
conclusion, zeaxanthin and lutein supplementation at doses equivalent to 1.5-2.0 
g daily in humans may have practical implications for preventing or slowing 
human AD progression by reducing neuroinflammation and maintaining systemic and 
central glucose homeostasis, showing promise even when compared to the 
established neuroprotective compound resveratrol. However, further clinical 
trials are needed to evaluate their efficacy and safety in human populations.

The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is essential for protection and plays a crucial 
role in chronic neurological disorders like small-vessel disease and Alzheimer's 
disease. Its complexity poses significant challenges for effective diagnostics 
and treatments, highlighting the need for novel animal models and comprehensive 
BBB dysfunction studies. This study investigates chronic BBB dysfunction 
induction using osmotic disruption via mannitol in healthy adult male Sprague 
Dawley rats over 12 weeks. Group 1 received 1 bolus/week (2.0 g/kg), Group 2 
received 3 boluses/week (1.5 g/kg), and Group 3 received 3 boluses/week (2.5 
g/kg). BBB dysfunction was assessed using gadolinium (Gd) infusion and MRI to 
evaluate location, severity, evolution, and persistence. MR spectroscopy (MRS) 
examined the brain metabolism changes due to intravenous mannitol, with 
T2-weighted MRI assessing brain lesions. Biomarkers of neuroinflammation were 
analyzed in the highest mannitol dose group. Our data show chronic BBB 
dysfunction primarily in the cortex, hippocampus, and striatum, but not in the 
corpus callosum of rats under periodic mannitol dosing in groups 1 and 2. MRS 
identified a distinctive metabolite signature, including changes in alanine, 
choline, and N-acetyl aspartate in the striatum of Group 1. No significant 
differences were found in the serum levels of all pro- and anti-inflammatory 
cytokines analyzed in the high-dose Group 3. This study underscores the 
feasibility and implications of using osmotic disruption to model chronic BBB 
dysfunction, offering insights for future neuroprotection and therapeutic 
strategies research.

From Brain to Muscle: The Role of Muscle Tissue in Neurodegenerative Disorders.

Duranti E(1), Villa C(1).

Italy.

Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD), primarily affect the 
central nervous system, leading to progressive neuronal loss and motor and 
cognitive dysfunction. However, recent studies have revealed that muscle tissue 
also plays a significant role in these diseases. ALS is characterized by severe 
muscle wasting as a result of motor neuron degeneration, as well as alterations 
in gene expression, protein aggregation, and oxidative stress. Muscle atrophy 
and mitochondrial dysfunction are also observed in AD, which may exacerbate 
cognitive decline due to systemic metabolic dysregulation. PD patients exhibit 
muscle fiber atrophy, altered muscle composition, and α-synuclein aggregation 
within muscle cells, contributing to motor symptoms and disease progression. 
Systemic inflammation and impaired protein degradation pathways are common among 
these disorders, highlighting muscle tissue as a key player in disease 
progression. Understanding these muscle-related changes offers potential 
therapeutic avenues, such as targeting mitochondrial function, reducing 
inflammation, and promoting muscle regeneration with exercise and 
pharmacological interventions. This review emphasizes the importance of 
considering an integrative approach to neurodegenerative disease research, 
considering both central and peripheral pathological mechanisms, in order to 
develop more effective treatments and improve patient outcomes.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Altered 
neurogenesis and the appearance of AD pathological hallmarks are fundamental to 
this disease. SRY-Box transcription factor 2 (Sox2), octamer-binding 
transcription factor 4 (Oct4), and Nanog are a set of core transcription factors 
that play a very decisive role in the preservation of pluripotency and the 
self-renewal capacity of embryonic and adult stem cells. These factors are 
critically involved in AD pathogenesis, senescence, and aging. Skin fibroblasts 
are emblematic of cellular damage in patients. We, therefore, in the present 
study, analyzed the basal expression of these factors in young, aged, and AD 
fibroblasts. AD fibroblasts displayed an altered expression of these factors, 
differing from aged and young fibroblasts. Since melatonin is well acknowledged 
for its anti-aging, anti-senescence and anti-AD therapeutic benefits, we further 
investigated the effects of melatonin treatment on the expression of these 
factors in fibroblasts, along with precise validation of the observed data in 
human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Our findings reveal that melatonin 
administration augmented the expression levels of Sox2, Oct4, and Nanog 
significantly in both cells. Altogether, our study presents the neuroprotective 
potential and efficacy of melatonin, which might have significant therapeutic 
benefits for aging and AD patients.

The number of people with dementia is increasing annually worldwide. Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), which accounts for the highest percentage of dementia-causing 
diseases, remains difficult to cure, and prevention of its onset is important. 
We aimed to discover new AD-preventive ingredients and investigate the 
inhibitory effects of ten different species of seafood digests prepared by 
protease treatment on β-secretase 1 (BACE1) activity. Substantial inhibition of 
BACE1 activity was observed in five species of seafood, and protease-digested 
whitebait (WPD) showed the highest inhibitory effect among the ten marine 
samples. We further examined the potential of WPD as an AD preventive component 
using a familial AD strain (5xFAD) murine model. The intraperitoneal 
administration of WPD for 28 days substantially decreased the insoluble amyloid 
β1-42 content and the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein, a marker of 
astrogliosis, in the cerebral cortex of the 5xFAD mice. These results strongly 
suggest that WPD is a novel functional food-derived ingredient with preventive 
effects against AD.

Background: Brain age prediction from brain MRI scans and the resulting brain 
age gap (BAG)-the difference between predicted brain age and chronological 
age-is a general biomarker for a variety of neurological, psychiatric, and other 
diseases or disorders. Methods: This study examined the differences in BAG 
values derived from T1-weighted scans using five state-of-the-art deep learning 
model architectures previously used in the brain age literature: 2D/3D VGG, 
RelationNet, ResNet, and SFCN. The models were evaluated on healthy controls and 
cohorts with sleep apnea, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, 
mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease, employing rigorous 
statistical analysis, including repeated model training and linear mixed-effects 
models. Results: All five models consistently identified a statistically 
significant positive BAG for diabetes (ranging from 0.79 years with RelationNet 
to 2.13 years with SFCN), multiple sclerosis (2.67 years with 3D VGG to 4.24 
years with 2D VGG), mild cognitive impairment (2.13 years with 2D VGG to 2.59 
years with 3D VGG), and Alzheimer's dementia (5.54 years with ResNet to 6.48 
years with SFCN). For Parkinson's disease, a statistically significant BAG 
increase was observed in all models except ResNet (1.30 years with 2D VGG to 
2.59 years with 3D VGG). For sleep apnea, a statistically significant BAG 
increase was only detected with the SFCN model (1.59 years). Additionally, we 
observed a trend of decreasing BAG with increasing chronological age, which was 
more pronounced in diseased cohorts, particularly those with the largest BAG, 
such as multiple sclerosis (-0.34 to -0.2), mild cognitive impairment (-0.37 to 
-0.26), and Alzheimer's dementia (-0.66 to -0.47), compared to healthy controls 
(-0.18 to -0.1). Conclusions: Consistent with previous research, Alzheimer's 
dementia and multiple sclerosis exhibited the largest BAG across all models, 
with SFCN predicting the highest BAG overall. The negative BAG trend suggests a 
complex interplay of survival bias, disease progression, adaptation, and therapy 
that influences brain age prediction across the age spectrum.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent kind of dementia and 
is a long-term degenerative disease. Pathologically, it is defined by the 
development of extracellular amyloid-β plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary 
tangles made up of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. This causes neuronal death, 
particularly in the hippocampus and cortex. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived 
exosomes have been identified as possibly therapeutic and have promise for 
Alzheimer's disease due to their regenerative characteristics.
METHODS: A systematic retrieval of information was performed on PubMed. A total 
of 60 articles were found in a search on mesenchymal stem cells, exosomes, and 
Alzheimer's disease. A total of 16 ongoing clinical trials were searched and 
added from clinicaltrials.gov. We added 23 supporting articles to help provide 
information for certain sections. In total, we included 99 articles in this 
manuscript: 50 are review articles, 13 are preclinical studies, 16 are clinical 
studies, 16 are ongoing clinical trials, and 4 are observational studies. 
Appropriate studies were isolated, and important information from each of them 
was understood and entered into a database from which the information was used 
in this article. The clinical trials on mesenchymal stem cell exosomes for 
Alzheimer's disease were searched on clinicaltrials.gov.
RESULTS: Several experimental investigations have shown that MSC-Exo improves 
cognitive impairment in rats. In this review paper, we summarized existing 
understanding regarding the molecular and cellular pathways behind MSC-Exo-based 
cognitive function restoration, with a focus on MSC-Exo's therapeutic potential 
in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
CONCLUSION: AD is a significant health issue in our culture and is linked to 
several important neuropathological characteristics. Exosomes generated from 
stem cells, such as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) or neural stem cells (NSCs), 
have been examined more and more in a variety of AD models, indicating that they 
may be viable therapeutic agents for the treatment of diverse disorders. Exosome 
yields may be increased, and their therapeutic efficacy can be improved using a 
range of tailored techniques and culture conditions. It is necessary to provide

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, mainly affecting 
elderly individuals. AD is characterized by β-amyloid plaques, abnormal tau 
tangles, neuronal loss, and metabolic disruptions. Recent studies have revealed 
the involvement of the kynurenine (KP) pathway and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor 
(AhR) in AD development. The KP pathway metabolizes tryptophan to produce 
neuroactive substances like kynurenine, kynurenic acid, and quinolinic acid. In 
AD, high levels of kynurenine and the neurotoxic quinolinic acid are associated 
with increased neuroinflammation and excitotoxicity; conversely, reduced levels 
of kynurenic acid, which acts as a glutamate receptor antagonist, compromise 
neuroprotection. Research has indicated elevated KP metabolites and enzymes in 
the hippocampus of AD patients and other tissues such as blood, cerebrospinal 
fluid, and urine. However, the finding that KP metabolites are AD biomarkers in 
blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and urine has been controversial. This controversy, 
stemming from the lack of consideration of the specific stage of AD, details of 
the patient's treatment, cognitive deficits, and psychiatric comorbidities, 
underscores the need for more comprehensive research. AhR, a ligand-activated 
transcription factor, regulates immune response, oxidative stress, and 
xenobiotic metabolism. Various ligands, including tryptophan metabolites, can 
activate it. Some studies suggest that AhR activation contributes to AD, while 
others propose that it provides neuroprotection. This discrepancy may be 
explained by the specific ligands that activate AhR, highlighting the complex 
relationship between the KP pathway, AhR activation, and AD, where the same 
pathway can produce both neuroprotective and harmful effects.

The role of mitochondria in neurodegenerative diseases is crucial, and recent 
developments have highlighted its significance in cell therapy. Mitochondrial 
dysfunction has been implicated in various neurodegenerative disorders, 
including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and 
Huntington's diseases. Understanding the impact of mitochondrial biology on 
these conditions can provide valuable insights for developing targeted cell 
therapies. This mini-review refocuses on mitochondria and emphasizes the 
potential of therapies leveraging mesenchymal stem cells, embryonic stem cells, 
induced pluripotent stem cells, stem cell-derived secretions, and extracellular 
vesicles. Mesenchymal stem cell-mediated mitochondria transfer is highlighted 
for restoring mitochondrial health in cells with dysfunctional mitochondria. 
Additionally, attention is paid to gene-editing techniques such as mito-CRISPR, 
mitoTALENs, mito-ZNFs, and DdCBEs to ensure the safety and efficacy of stem cell 
treatments. Challenges and future directions are also discussed, including the 
possible tumorigenic effects of stem cells, off-target effects, disease 
targeting, immune rejection, and ethical issues.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive brain 
stimulation method that has been suggested as a possible treatment method for 
cognitive impairment in patients with Alzheimer's Disease (pwAD), similar to 
multidomain cognitive training (CT). The effectiveness, however, of combining 
these techniques for pwAD remains controversial due to the variability in rTMS 
parameters, differences in CT protocol designs-many of which neglect the 
language domain-and the inclusion of patients at various stages of Alzheimer's 
Disease (AD) and with different types of dementia. The current review aims to 
evaluate the cognitive benefits of combining rTMS with CT, including language 
training, for individuals with mild to moderate AD. An extensive literature 
search was conducted in PubMed, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Library with 
relevant terms, resulting in nine studies with a total of 290 participants [190 
in the Active Group (AG) and 100 in the Control Group (CG)]. The comprehensive 
review of the articles revealed that the combined treatment improved global 
cognitive function, as well as neurocognitive, neuropsychiatric, and quality of 
life in the AG. Nevertheless, these results should be interpreted cautiously, 
given the relatively small number of existing studies on this specific 
combination.

Prion diseases are 100% fatal infectious neurodegenerative diseases affecting 
the brains of humans and other mammals. The disease is caused by the formation 
and replication of prions, composed exclusively of the misfolded prion protein 
(PrPSc). We invented and developed the protein misfolding cyclic amplification 
(PMCA) technology for in vitro prion replication, which allow us to replicate 
the infectious agent and it is commonly used for ultra-sensitive prion detection 
in biological fluids, tissues and environmental samples. In this article, we 
studied whether PMCA can be used to screen for chemical compounds that block 
prion replication. A small set of compounds previously shown to have anti-prion 
activity in various systems, mostly using cells infected with murine prions, was 
evaluated for their ability to prevent the replication of prions. Studies were 
conducted simultaneously with prions derived from 4 species, including human, 
cattle, cervid and mouse. Our results show that only one of these compounds 
(methylene blue) was able to completely inhibit prion replication in all 
species. Estimation of the IC50 for methylene blue inhibition of human prions 
causing variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) was 7.7 μM. Finally, we showed 
that PMCA can be used for structure-activity relationship studies of anti-prion 
compounds. Interestingly, some of the less efficient prion inhibitors altered 
the replication of prions in some species and not others, suggesting that PMCA 
is useful for studying the differential selectivity of potential drugs.

Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's Disease (PD) are life-altering diseases that 
are characterised by progressive memory loss and motor dysfunction. The 
prevalence of AD and PD is predicted to continuously increase. Symptoms of AD 
and PD are primarily mediated by progressive neuron death and dysfunction in the 
hippocampus and substantia nigra. Central features that drive neurodegeneration 
are caspase activation, DNA fragmentation, lipid peroxidation, protein 
carbonylation, amyloid-β, and/or α-synuclein formation. Reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) increase these central features. Currently, there are limited therapeutic 
options targeting these mechanisms. Antioxidants reduce ROS levels by the 
induction of antioxidant proteins and direct neutralisation of ROS. This review 
aims to assess the effectiveness of antioxidants in reducing ROS and 
neurodegeneration. Antioxidants enhance major endogenous defences against ROS 
including superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione. Direct neutralisation 
of ROS by antioxidants protects against ROS-induced cytotoxicity. The 
combination of Indirect and direct protective mechanisms prevents ROS-induced 
α-synuclein and/or amyloid-β formation. Antioxidants ameliorate ROS-mediated 
oxidative stress and subsequent deleterious downstream effects that promote 
apoptosis. As a result, downstream harmful events including neuron death, 
dysfunction, and protein aggregation are decreased. The protective effects of 
antioxidants in human models have yet to directly replicate the success seen in 
cell and animal models. However, the lack of diversity in antioxidants for 
clinical trials prevents a definitive answer if antioxidants are protective. 
Taken together, antioxidant treatment is a promising avenue in neurodegenerative 
disease therapy and subsequent clinical trials are needed to provide a 
definitive answer on the protective effects of antioxidants. No current 
treatment strategies have significant impact in treating advanced AD and PD, but 
new mimetics of endogenous mitochondrial antioxidant enzymes (Avasopasem 
Manganese, GC4419 AVA) may be a promising innovative option for decelerating 
neurodegenerative progress in the future at the mitochondrial level of OS.

Oxidative stress (OS) occurs from excessive reactive oxygen species or a 
deficiency of antioxidants-primarily endogenous glutathione (GSH). There are 
many illnesses, from acute and post-COVID-19, diabetes, myocardial infarction to 
Alzheimer's disease, that are associated with OS. These dissimilar illnesses 
are, in order, viral infections, metabolic disorders, ischemic events, and 
neurodegenerative disorders. Evidence is presented that in many illnesses, (1) 
OS is an early initiator and significant promotor of their progressive 
pathophysiologic processes, (2) early reduction of OS may prevent later serious 
and irreversible complications, (3) GSH deficiency is associated with OS, (4) 
GSH can likely reduce OS and restore adaptive physiology, (5) effective 
administration of GSH can be accomplished with a novel nano-product, the 
GSH/cyclodextrin (GC) complex. OS is an overlooked pathological process of many 
illnesses. Significantly, with the GSH/cyclodextrin (GC) complex, therapeutic 
administration of GSH is now available to reduce OS. Finally, rigorous 
prospective studies are needed to confirm the efficacy of this therapeutic 
approach.

BACKGROUND: Identifying lifestyle factors that independently or jointly lower 
dementia risk is a public health priority given the limited treatment options 
available to patients. In this cohort study, we examined the associations 
between Mediterranean or Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet 
adherence and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) with later-life dementia, and 
assessed whether the associations between dietary pattern and dementia are 
modified by CRF.
METHODS: Data are from 9,095 adults seeking preventive care at the Cooper Clinic 
(1987-1999) who completed a 3-day dietary record and a maximal exercise test. 
Alzheimer's disease and related disorders or senile dementia (i.e., all-cause 
dementia) was identified from Medicare administrative claims (1999-2019). 
Illness-death models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) for the associations between Mediterranean or DASH 
diet adherence (primary exposure), CRF (secondary exposure), and all-cause 
dementia, adjusted for demographic and clinical factors. An interaction term was 
included between diet score and CRF to assess effect modification by CRF.
RESULTS: The mean age at baseline was 50.6 (standard deviation [SD]: 8.4) years, 
and a majority of the study sample were men (77.5%) and White (96.4%). 1449 
cases of all-cause dementia were identified over a mean follow-up of 9.2 (SD: 
5.8) years. Neither Mediterranean nor DASH diet adherence was associated with 
dementia risk in fully adjusted models (HR per SD of Mediterranean diet score: 
1.00, 95% CI: 0.94, 1.05; HR per SD of DASH diet score: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.96, 
1.08). However, participants with higher CRF had a decreased hazard of dementia 
(HR, per metabolic equivalent of task [MET] increase, Mediterranean model: 0.95, 
95% CI: 0.92, 0.98; HR, per MET increase, DASH model: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.92, 0.97). 
No effect modification by CRF was observed in the association between diet and 
dementia.
CONCLUSIONS: In this sample of apparently healthy middle-aged adults seeking 
preventive care, higher CRF at midlife was associated with a lower risk of 
all-cause dementia, though adherence to a Mediterranean or DASH diet was not, 
and CRF did not modify the diet-dementia association. CRF should be emphasized 
in multimodal interventions for dementia prevention and investigated among 
diverse samples.

network for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.

OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a type of neurological illness that 
significantly impacts individuals' daily lives. In the intelligent diagnosis of 
AD, 3D networks require larger computational resources and storage space for 
training the models, leading to increased model complexity and training time. On 
the other hand, 2D slices analysis may overlook the 3D structural information of 
MRI and can result in information loss.
APPROACH: We propose a multi-slice attention fusion and multi-view personalized 
fusion lightweight network for automated AD diagnosis. It incorporates a 
multi-branch lightweight backbone to extract features from sagittal, axial, and 
coronal view of MRI, respectively. In addition, we introduce a novel multi-slice 
attention fusion module, which utilizes a combination of global and local 
channel attention mechanism to ensure consistent classification across multiple 
slices. Additionally, a multi-view personalized fusion module is tailored to 
assign appropriate weights to the three views, taking into account the varying 
significance of each view in achieving accurate classification results. To 
enhance the performance of the multi-view personalized fusion module, we utilize 
a label consistency loss to guide the model's learning process. This encourages 
the acquisition of more consistent and stable representations across all three 
views.
MAIN RESULTS: The suggested strategy is efficient in lowering the number of 
parameters and FLOPs, with only 3.75M and 4.45G respectively, and accuracy 
improved by 10.5% to 14% in three tasks. Moreover, in the classification tasks 
of AD vs. CN, AD vs. MCI and MCI vs. CN, the accuracy of the proposed method is 
95.63%, 86.88% and 85.00%, respectively, which is superior to the existing 
methods.
CONCLUSIONS: The results show that the proposed approach not only excels in 
resource utilization, but also significantly outperforms the four comparison 
methods in terms of accuracy and sensitivity, particularly in detecting 
early-stage AD lesions. It can precisely capture and accurately identify subtle 
brain lesions, providing crucial technical support for early intervention and 
treatment.

Neurocognitive disorders are characterized by a decline in various components of 
cognitive function, resulting in a high rate of morbidity and mortality. Despite 
multiple efforts, there is still a lack of practical preventive and therapeutic 
approaches for these diseases, and current pharmaceuticals have failed to manage 
their progression. Consequently, this chapter aims to provide a concise overview 
of the existing preclinical and clinical evidence that explores the impact of 
plant-based therapies on the prevention and treatment of neurocognitive 
disorders.We thoroughly searched different web databases to identify preclinical 
and clinical studies that investigate the effect of plant-based medicines on 
cognitive function in animal models, as well as individuals who are healthy, 
those with mild cognitive decline, or those with Alzheimer's disease. We 
included studies that examined plant extracts, multi-component herbal 
preparations, and phytochemicals such as Nigella sativa Linn., Rosmarinus 
officinalis L., Ginkgo biloba, and Melissa officinalis. The neuroprotective 
effects of these plants were associated with their anticholinesterase, 
anti-inflammatory, and antioxidative activities. None of the included studies 
reported severe adverse reactions.In conclusion, the results of the preclinical 
and clinical studies indicate the potential benefits of plant-based therapies on 
neurocognitive disorders. However, more extended and comprehensive clinical 
studies must confirm these findings thoroughly.

Brazil has a very large biological variety, which is an almost inexhaustible 
source of substances of pharmacological and biotechnological interest. Several 
studies have demonstrated the presence of bioactive peptides in insect hemolymph 
and their potential use as therapeutic agents. However, few data are available 
regarding molecules extracted from insects with anti-apoptotic action. The 
objective of this work was to identify the presence of proteins from the 
hemolymph of caterpillars of the Megalopygidae family with pharmacological and 
biotechnological interest. This study provides preliminary and innovative 
information on a new substance that inhibits cellular apoptopsis and stabilizes 
the tested cells, impacting the cytoskeleton, maintaining cellular structure and 
its functions. To this, two species of Megalopygidae family were studied, 
Podalia sp. and Megalopyge albicolis. Cytotoxicity tests on Vero and Sf-9 cells 
revealed that the hemolymph of both caterpillars was cytotoxic only at 
concentrations greater than 5%v/v. In the anti-apoptotic activity assays, it was 
verified that the supplementation of cell cultures with only 1% of hemolymph v/v 
is sufficient to inhibit cell death by apoptosis induced by different inducers 
such as terbutyl, actinomycin D, hydrogen peroxide, or even by nutrient 
depletion. For this study, cells were stained with trypan blue, crystal violet, 
and fluorescent markers to cytoskeleton (actin and tubulin), mitochondria 
membrane electric potential (JC-1), and apoptosis marker (acridine orange and 
ethidium). The protein responsible for anti-apoptotic action was isolated 
through gel filtration chromatography, using an AKTA purifier high-resolution 
liquid chromatography system. The hemolymph was fractionated into 3 pools 
for Podalia sp. and 6 pools for M. abicolis. In the antiapoptotic tests, 
semi-purified hemolymph from both caterpillars showed anti-apoptotic effect in 
VERO and SF-9 cells, pre-treated with only 1% v/v of hemolymph and induced to 
death by different and apoptotic inductors. Was observed that the molecule with 
anti-apoptotic effect is present in pool 3 in both hemolymphs. This protector 
effect blocked and attenuated the disruption of the cytoskeleton (actin 
filaments), being that the protective effect also was observed on the integrity 
of the mitochondrial membrane of SF-9 cells pre-treated with both hemolymphs and 
treated with the apoptosis inducer Terbutil at concentrations of 25 to 100 µM. 
By acting on the mitochondrial pathway of death by apoptosis, and by maintaining 
the structure of the cytoskeleton and cellular functions, pathway that can cause 
disorders and diseases neurodegenerative, the substances present in the 
hemolymph of these and other caterpillars could be good candidates in studies 
for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and 
Alzheimer's.

(-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is reported to have benefits for the 
treatment of Alzheimer's disease by binding with acetylcholinesterase (AChE) to 
enhance the cholinergic neurotransmission. Organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) 
inhibited AChE and damaged the nervous system. This study investigated the 
combined effects of EGCG and OPs on AChE activities in vitro & vivo. The results 
indicated that EGCG significantly reversed the inhibition of AChE caused by OPs. 
In vitro, EGCG reactived AChE in three group tubes incubated for 110 min, and in 
vivo, it increased the relative activities of AChE from less than 20% to over 
70% in brain and vertebral of zebrafish during the exposure of 34 h. The study 
also proposed the molecular interaction mechanisms through the reactive kinetics 
and computational analyses of density functional theory, molecular docking, and 
dynamic modeling. These analyses suggested that EGCG occupied the key residues, 
preventing OPs from binding to the catalytic center of AChE, and interfering 
with the initial affinity of OPs to the central active site. Hydrogen bonding, 
conjugation, and steric interactions were identified as playing important roles 
in the molecular interactions. The work suggests that EGCG antagonized the 
inhibitions of OPs on AChE activities and potentially offered the 
neuroprotection against the induced damage.

The Neuronal alpha-Synuclein Disease (NSD) biological definition and Integrated 
Staging System (NSD-ISS) provide a research framework to identify individuals 
with Lewy body pathology and stage them based on underlying biology and 
increasing degree of functional impairment. Utilizing data from the PPMI, 
PASADENA, and SPARK studies, we developed and applied biologic and clinical 
data-informed definitions for the NSD-ISS across the disease continuum. 
Individuals enrolled as Parkinson's disease, Prodromal, or Healthy Controls were 
defined and staged based on biological, clinical, and functional anchors at 
baseline. Across the three studies 1741 participants had SAA data and of these 
1030 (59%) were S+ consistent with NSD. Among sporadic PD, 683/736 (93%) were 
NSD, and the distribution for Stages 2B, 3, and 4 was 25%, 63%, and 9%, 
respectively. Median (95% CI) time to developing a clinically meaningful outcome 
was 8.3 (6.2, 10.1), 5.9 (4.1, 6.0), and 2.4 (1.0, 4.0) years for baseline stage 
2B, 3, and 4, respectively. We propose pilot biologic and clinical anchors for 
NSD-ISS. Our results highlight the baseline heterogeneity of individuals 
currently defined as early PD. Baseline stage predicts time to progression to 
clinically meaningful milestones. Further research on validation of the anchors 
in longitudinal cohorts is necessary.

Despite recent advances, severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) remains a lethal 
inflammation with limited treatment options. Here, we provide compelling 
evidence of GV-971 (sodium oligomannate), an anti-Alzheimer's medication, as 
being a protective agent in various male mouse SAP models. Microbiome 
sequencing, along with intestinal microbiota transplantation and mass cytometry 
technology, unveil that GV-971 reshapes the gut microbiota, increasing 
Faecalibacterium populations and modulating both peripheral and intestinal 
immune systems. A metabolomics analysis of cecal contents from GV-971-treated 
SAP mice further identifies short-chain fatty acids, including propionate and 
butyrate, as key metabolites in inhibiting macrophage M1 polarization and 
subsequent lethal inflammation by blocking the MAPK pathway. These findings 
suggest GV-971 as a promising therapeutic for SAP by targeting the microbiota 
metabolic immune axis.

Age-related cognitive decline and dementia are significant manifestations of 
brain aging. As the elderly population grows rapidly, the health and 
socio-economic impacts of cognitive dysfunction have become increasingly 
significant. Although clinical treatment of dementia has faced considerable 
challenges over the past few decades, with limited breakthroughs in slowing its 
progression, there has been substantial progress in understanding the molecular 
mechanisms and hallmarks of age-related dementia (ARD). This progress brings new 
hope for the intervention and treatment of this disease. In this review, we 
categorize the latest findings in ARD biomarkers into four stages based on 
disease progression: Healthy brain, pre-clinical, mild cognitive impairment, and 
dementia. We then systematically summarize the most promising therapeutic 
approaches to prevent or slow ARD at four levels: Genome and epigenome, 
organelle, cell, and organ and organism. We emphasize the importance of early 
prevention and detection, along with the implementation of combined treatments 
as multimodal intervention strategies, to address brain aging and ARD in the 
future.

A new era of disease-modifying therapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD) arrived in 
2021 following the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) decision to grant 
accelerated approval for aducanumab, an anti-β-amyloid (Aβ) monoclonal antibody 
designed to target Aβ aggregates, a biological component of AD. More recently, 
trial outcomes for lecanemab and donanemab, two additional antibodies of this 
drug class, have shown favorable and significant slowing of metrics for 
cognitive and functional decline. Lecanemab and donanemab have since received 
similar FDA approval to aducanumab in January 2023 and July 2024, respectively. 
Given that these therapies are a clearly emerging tool in the repertoire of 
clinicians treating AD and related dementias, a critical dialogue has been 
ongoing regarding the potential impacts and place for these therapies. Here, we 
seek to contextualize this debate by first considering factors involved in 
theoretically extrapolating current randomized control trial outcomes to 
estimate meaningful clinical impacts. In the process of this exercise, we 
outline a generally useful concept termed Summative Treatment-Associated Benefit 
measuring Long-term Efficacy/Effectiveness Area as a metric of summative 
benefits of treatment over the life course of an individual. Second, we consider 
current real-world factors, such as conditions of FDA approval and other points 
involved in clinical decision-making that will influence and/or temper the 
actual impacts of this drug class.

The distribution of insulin receptors throughout the brain implicates insulin in 
physiological functions and disease states, including cognition, appetite, mood, 
and metabolic disorders. Intranasally administered insulin offers a non-invasive 
approach for isolating and investigating brain insulin action. This systematic 
review synthesized the effects of acute intranasal insulin on neuroimaging, 
cognitive, and behavioural outcomes reported in 48 studies in adults. Age, sex, 
body mass index, and insulin resistance were found to moderate brain insulin 
action. Neuroimaging studies showed insulin affects brain activity, cerebral 
blood flow, and functional connectivity in regions like the hypothalamus, 
amygdala, and insula. Insulin also modified cognitive function, eating 
behaviour, and the stress response. Nonetheless, inconsistencies in study 
designs, dosages, and outcome measures necessitate standardized methodologies to 
better understand central insulin action. Taken together, insulin's ability to 
modify stress and fear, appetite and eating behaviour, and cognitive function in 
both healthy and diseased individuals highlight its potential in the therapeutic 
and mechanistic exploration of highly prevalent psychiatric, metabolic, and 
cognitive conditions like mood disorders, obesity, and Alzheimer's disease.

In this high-throughput proteomic study of autosomal dominant Alzheimer's 
disease (ADAD), we sought to identify early biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) for disease monitoring and treatment strategies. We examined CSF proteins 
in 286 mutation carriers (MCs) and 177 non-carriers (NCs). The developed 
multi-layer regression model distinguished proteins with different 
pseudo-trajectories between these groups. We validated our findings with 
independent ADAD as well as sporadic AD datasets and employed machine learning 
to develop and validate predictive models. Our study identified 137 proteins 
with distinct trajectories between MCs and NCs, including eight that changed 
before traditional AD biomarkers. These proteins are grouped into three stages: 
early stage (stress response, glutamate metabolism, neuron mitochondrial 
damage), middle stage (neuronal death, apoptosis), and late presymptomatic stage 
(microglial changes, cell communication). The predictive model revealed a 
six-protein subset that more effectively differentiated MCs from NCs, compared 
with conventional biomarkers.

BACKGROUND: β-Amyloid (Aβ) fibrillation is critical for Aβ deposition and 
cytotoxicity during the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Consequently, 
anti-Aβ monoclonal antibody drugs targeting Aβ oligomers and aggregation are 
considered potential therapeutic strategies for AD treatment. Similar to the 
working mechanisms of anti-Aβ monoclonal antibody drugs, our study identified 
osmundacetone (OAC), a small-molecule compound isolated from the traditional 
Chinese medicine Rhizoma Osmundae, as exerting anti-AD effects by targeting Aβ.
PURPOSE: This study sought to determine whether OAC influences the Aβ burden in 
APP/PS1 mice and to identify potential regulatory mechanisms.
METHODS: Five-month-old APP/PS1 mice were injected intraperitoneally with OAC at 
a dose of 1 mg/kg for 12 weeks. The cognitive functions of the mice were 
assessed via the Morris water maze test and the open field test. Osmundacetone 
was analyzed via molecular docking, an isothermal dose‒response 
fingerprint-cellular context thermal shift assay, a thioflavine T fluorescence 
assay, and an atomic force microscopy assay to analyze the effects of OAC on Aβ 
fibrillation. Immunofluorescence, immunoblotting, and immunohistochemistry were 
used to assess Aβ clearance, AD pathology, oxidative stress, and inflammatory 
responses.
RESULTS: The innovative biochemical and physical data illustrated that the 
ability of OAC to inhibit Aβ fibrillation was accomplished by binding directly 
to Aβ, which differed from the majority of previously reported natural 
polyphenols that modulate the Aβ content and structure in an indirect manner. 
The inhibition of Aβ fibrosis by OAC subsequently promoted Aβ lysosomal 
degradation, resulting in a decreased Aβ burden in APP/PS1 mice. Furthermore, 
OAC treatment inhibited oxidative damage by upregulating glutathione peroxidase 
expression and attenuated the production of inflammatory factors by 
downregulating nuclear factor-kB phosphorylation in APP/PS1 mice.
CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate, for the first time, that OAC could 
reduce the brain Aβ burden in APP/PS1 mice by inhibiting Aβ fibrillation through 
direct binding to Aβ and improve cognitive dysfunction by attenuating oxidative 
damage and neuroinflammation. These findings indicate that OAC may be a 
promising candidate for the treatment of AD.

By detecting and responding to cytosolic DNA, the cGAS STING pathway regulates 
the innate immune responses bymediatinginflammatory reactions and antiviral 
defense. Thederegulation and modification of this system have been linked to 
variousneurodegenerative diseases like AD, PD and ALS. Accumulation of tau 
protein and Aβ aggregates to activate the pathway and releases neuroinflammatory 
cytokines which accelerates neuronal dysfunction and cognitive impairment as the 
symptom of AD. Similarly, in PD Alpha-synuclein aggregates activate the cGAS 
STING pathway and regulate the neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. In ALS, 
mutation of the genes causes the activation of the pathway which leads to motor 
neuron degeneration. Alteration of the cGAS STING pathway also leads to 
mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired autophagy. Preclinical investigations of 
AD, PD, and ALS animal models showed that STING pathway inhibitors reduced 
inflammation and improved neurological outcomes and modulators of the cGAS STING 
pathway may treat these neurodegenerative disorders. In this review we focus on 
the fact thatneuroinflammation, neuronal dysfunction, and various disease 
progressions can be treated byaltering the cGAS STING pathway. Understanding the 
processes and creating specific interventions for this route may offer new 
treatments for these terrible illnesses.

BACKGROUND: The neural activity of the Default Mode Network (DMN) is disrupted 
in patients with In Alzheimer's disease (AD).
OBJECTIVES: We used a novel multimodal approach to track neural signal 
propagation within the DMN in AD patients.
METHODS: Twenty mild to moderate AD patients were recruited. We used 
transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) pulses to probe with a millisecond time 
resolution the propagation of evoked electroencephalography (EEG) signal 
following the neural activation of the Precuneus (PC), which is a key hub area 
of the DMN. Moreover, functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
data were collected to reconstruct individual features of the DMN.
RESULTS: In AD patients a probe TMS pulse applied over the PC evokes an 
increased local activity unmasking underlying hyperexcitability. In contrast, 
the EEG evoked neural signal did not propagate efficiently within the DMN 
showing a remarkable breakdown of signal propagation. fMRI and structural 
tractography showed that impaired signal propagation was related to the same 
connectivity matrices derived from DMN BOLD signal and transferred by specific 
white matter bundles forming the cingulum. These features were not detectable 
stimulating other areas (left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) or for different 
networks (fronto-parietal network). Finally, connectivity breakdown was 
associated with cognitive impairment, as measured with the Clinical Dementia 
Rating Scale sum of boxes (CDR-SB).
CONCLUSIONS: TMS-EEG in AD shows both local hyperexcitability and a lack of 
signal propagation within the DMN. These neurophysiological features also 
correlate with structural and cognitive attributes of the patients.
SIGNIFICANCE: Neuronavigated TMS-EEG may be used as a novel neurophysiological 
biomarker of DMN connectivity in AD patients.

University First Affiliated Hospital, Changsha, China.

Alzheimer disease (AD), as the main type of dementia, is primarily characterized 
by cognitive dysfunction across multiple domains. Current drugs for AD have not 
achieved the desired clinical efficacy due to potential risks, inapplicability, 
high costs, significant side effects, and poor patient compliance. However, 
recent findings offer new hope by suggesting that sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 
inhibitors (SGLT-2i) may possess neuroprotective properties, potentially opening 
up novel avenues for the treatment of AD. This review delves deeply into the 
multifaceted mechanisms of action of SGLT-2i in AD, encompassing antioxidative 
stress, antineuroinflammation, upregulation of autophagy, antiapoptosis, 
acetylcholinesterase inhibitor activity, and protection of endothelial cells 
against atherosclerosis and damage to the blood-brain barrier, among others. 
Furthermore, it provides an overview of recent advances in clinical research on 
this drug. These findings suggest that SGLT-2i is poised to emerge as a pivotal 
candidate for the treatment of AD, given its diverse functional effects.

Accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) in the brain has been explored as a primary 
cause of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Better known as the amyloid hypothesis, it 
has been the main target of researchers vying to bring their therapeutic 
interventions to market despite several failed attempts by predecessors. In June 
2021, Aduhelm (Aducanumab) became the first U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) approved treatment for AD based on the amyloid hypothesis in which sparked 
controversy. This meta-analysis aims to investigate the efficacy of amyloid-beta 
targeting interventions at all stages of the disease including the prodromal or 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage compared to placebo. All completed and 
terminated Phase III trials are assessed to provide a comprehensive overview of 
interventions targeting amyloid-beta to inform the legitimacy of the amyloid 
hypothesis.

Huntington disease (HD) is a genetic neurodegenerative disease caused by 
cytosine, adenine, guanine (CAG) expansion in the Huntingtin (HTT) gene, 
translating to an expanded polyglutamine tract in the HTT protein. Age at 
disease onset correlates to CAG repeat length but varies by decades between 
individuals with identical repeat lengths. Genome-wide association studies link 
HD modification to DNA repair and mitochondrial health pathways. Clinical 
studies show elevated DNA damage in HD, even at the premanifest stage. A major 
DNA repair node influencing neurodegenerative disease is the PARP pathway. 
Accumulation of poly adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribose (PAR) has been 
implicated in Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases, as well as cerebellar ataxia. We 
report that HD mutation carriers have lower cerebrospinal fluid PAR levels than 
healthy controls, starting at the premanifest stage. Human HD induced 
pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons and patient-derived fibroblasts have 
diminished PAR response in the context of elevated DNA damage. We have defined a 
PAR-binding motif in HTT, detected HTT complexed with PARylated proteins in 
human cells during stress, and localized HTT to mitotic chromosomes upon 
inhibition of PAR degradation. Direct HTT PAR binding was measured by 
fluorescence polarization and visualized by atomic force microscopy at the 
single molecule level. While wild-type and mutant HTT did not differ in their 
PAR binding ability, purified wild-type HTT protein increased in vitro PARP1 
activity while mutant HTT did not. These results provide insight into an early 
molecular mechanism of HD, suggesting possible targets for the design of early 
preventive therapies.

Since the 2021 FDA approval of the first monoclonal antibody (MAB) therapy for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), treatment has progressed from symptom management to 
targeting and reducing amyloid β plaque burden. While these therapies offer hope 
of altering the disease course, they come with risks, such as amyloid-related 
imaging abnormalities (ARIA), which include ARIA-E (edema and effusion) and 
ARIA-H (hemorrhage). This report details the case of a 64-year-old woman 
undergoing donanemab treatment who developed severe ARIA, characterized by 
extensive vasogenic edema and multiple microhemorrhages. The increasing use of 
MABs necessitates heightened awareness and expertise among emergency 
radiologists to identify findings of ARIA effectively, ensuring timely and 
appropriate care for patients undergoing these novel therapies.

This narrative review aimed to summarize evidence on responses to exercise in 
pre-clinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) and on how long-term exercise programs 
work to improve neuropsychiatric symptoms and cognitive performance. We 
conducted a narrative review of the body of research on the benefits of 
long-term exercise programs in improving cognitive performance and reducing 
neuropsychiatric scores in patients with AD. Long-term exercise therapy appears 
to improve blood flow, increase hippocampal volume, and promote neurogenesis in 
patients with AD. Higher levels of physical activity are associated with a lower 
chance of developing the disease, and most prospective studies have shown that 
physical inactivity is one of the most prevalent modifiable risk factors for the 
development of AD. Exercise appears to be beneficial in improving cognitive 
function, a neuropsychiatric symptom of AD. Exercise has been shown to have 
fewer side effects, such as non-pharmacological effects and better adherence 
than medication. In this review, experts provided a snapshot and authoritative 
summary of evidence for non-pharmacological exercise in patients with AD based 
on the best synthesis efforts, identified the main knowledge gaps and relevant 
barriers, and provided directions for future research. Furthermore, experts in 
randomized trial designs provided practical details and recommendations for 
researchers working in this area, underscoring the importance of relevant 
topics.

BACKGROUND: Early detection of amyloid-β (Aβ) positivity is essential for an 
accurate diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but it is 
currently costly and/or invasive.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to classify Aβ positivity (Aβ+) using morphometric features 
from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a more accessible and non-invasive 
technique, in two clinical population scenarios: one containing AD, mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) and cognitively normal (CN) subjects, and another 
only cognitively impaired subjects (AD and MCI).
METHODS: Demographic, cognitive (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] scores), 
regional morphometry MRI (volumes, areas, and thicknesses), and derived 
morphometric graph theory (GT) features from all subjects (302 Aβ+, age: 
73.3±7.2, 150 male; 246 Aβ-, age: 71.1±7.1, 131 male) were combined in different 
feature sets. We implemented a machine learning workflow to find the best Aβ+ 
classification model.
RESULTS: In an AD+MCI+CN population scenario, the best-performing model selected 
120 features (107 GT features, 12 regional morphometric features and the MMSE 
total score) and achieved a negative predictive value (NPVadj) of 68.4%, and a 
balanced accuracy (BAC) of 66.9%. In a AD+MCI scenario, the best model obtained 
NPVadj of 71.6%, and BAC of 70.7%, using 180 regional morphometric features (98 
volumes, 52 areas and 29 thicknesses from temporal, parietal, and frontal brain 
regions).
CONCLUSIONS: Although with currently limited clinical applicability, regional 
MRI morphometric features have clinical usefulness potential for detecting Aβ 
status, which may be augmented by a combination with cognitive data when 
cognitively normal subjects make up a substantial part of the population 
presenting for diagnosis.

A characteristic feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the formation of 
neuronal extracellular senile plaques composed of aggregates of fibrillar 
amyloid β (Aβ) peptides, with the Aβ1-42 peptide being the most abundant 
species. These Aβ peptides have been proposed to contribute to the 
pathophysiology of the disease; however, there are few tools available to test 
this hypothesis directly. In particular, there are no data that establish a 
dose-response relationship between Aβ peptide expression level and disease. We 
have generated a panel of transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans strains expressing 
the human Aβ1-42 peptide under the control of promoter regions of two 
pan-neuronal expressed genes, snb-1 and rgef-1. Phenotypic data show strong 
age-related defects in motility, subtle changes in chemotaxis, reduced median 
and maximum lifespan, changes in health span indicators, and impaired learning. 
The Aβ1-42 expression level of these strains differed as a function of promoter 
identity and transgene copy number, and the timing and severity of phenotypes 
mediated by Aβ1-42 were strongly positively correlated with expression level. 
The pan-neuronal expression of varying levels of human Aβ1-42 in a nematode 
model provides a new tool to investigate the in vivo toxicity of neuronal Aβ 
expression and the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying AD progression 
in the absence of endogenous Aβ peptides. More importantly, it allows direct 
quantitative testing of the dose-response relationship between neuronal Aβ 
peptide expression and disease for the first time. These strains may also be 
used to develop screens for novel therapeutics to treat Alzheimer's disease.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are two neurodegenerative 
diseases posing a significant disease burden due to their increasing prevalence 
and socio-economic cost. Traditional therapeutic approaches for these diseases 
exist but provide limited symptomatic relief without addressing the underlying 
pathologies. This review examines the potential of immunotherapy, specifically 
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), as disease-modifying treatments for AD and PD. We 
analyze the pathological mechanisms of AD and PD, focusing on the roles of 
amyloid-beta (Aβ), tau (τ), and alpha-synuclein (α-syn) proteins. We discuss the 
latest advancements in mAb therapies targeting these proteins, evaluating their 
efficacy in clinical trials and preclinical studies. We also explore the 
challenges faced in translating these therapies from bench to bedside, including 
issues related to safety, specificity, and clinical trial design. Additionally, 
we highlight future directions for research, emphasizing the need for 
combination therapies, improved biomarkers, and personalized treatment 
strategies. This review aims to provide insights into the current state and 
future potential of antibody-based immunotherapy in modifying the course of AD 
and PD, ultimately improving patient outcomes and quality of life.

The recent, controversial approval of antibody-based treatments for Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) is fueling a heated debate on the molecular determinants of this 
condition. The discussion should also incorporate a critical revision of the 
limitations of preclinical mouse models in advancing our understanding of AD. We 
critically discuss the limitations of animal models, stressing the need for 
careful consideration of how experiments are designed and results interpreted. 
We identify the shortcomings of AD models to recapitulate the complexity of the 
human disease. We dissect these issues at the quantitative, qualitative, 
temporal, and context-dependent levels. We argue that these models are based on 
the oversimplistic assumptions proposed by the amyloid cascade hypothesis (ACH) 
of AD and fail to account for the multifactorial nature of the condition. By 
shedding light on the constraints of current experimental tools, this review 
aims to foster the development and implementation of more clinically relevant 
tools. While we do not rule out a role for preclinical models, we call for 
alternative approaches to be explored and, most importantly, for a re-evaluation 
of the ACH.

INTRODUCTION: Delay in diagnosis of posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) syndrome is 
common, and the lack of familiarity with assessment tools for identifying visual 
cortical dysfunction is a contributing factor. We propose recommendations for 
the approach to the evaluation of PCA clinical features during the office visit, 
the neuropsychological evaluation, and the research setting. A recommended 
screening battery for eye clinics is also proposed.
METHODS: Recommendations were developed using results from a web-based survey of 
members of Alzheimer's Association International Society to Advance Alzheimer's 
Research and Treatment (ISTAART) Atypical Alzheimer's Disease Professional 
Interest Area (PIA), literature review, and consensus by the PCA assessment 
working party of the Atypical Alzheimer's Disease PIA.
RESULTS: Survey results revealed robust agreement for assessment tool 
preferences for PCA features, and many respondents indicated that they reserve 
assessment tools for use only when PCA is suspected. For some PCA features, 
curated tools were preferred over validated battery tools, particularly for the 
office visit. Consensus recommendations superseded survey preferences for two 
core cognitive features within the 2017 PCA diagnostic criteria.
DISCUSSION: These consensus recommendations provide an evaluation framework for 
PCA clinical features and can facilitate timely and accurate recognition and 
diagnosis of PCA. Broader use of these tools should be sought, and development 
and validation of novel PCA clinical outcome assessments are needed to improve 
our understanding of atypical AD and other dementias and support the inclusion 
of those with PCA in treatment trials.

BACKGROUND: The study aims to investigate the pharmacological basis and 
molecular mechanisms of resveratrol in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
and Parkinson's disease (PD) through the approach of treating different diseases 
with the same method, guided by traditional Chinese medicine theory. Utilizing 
network pharmacology and bioinformatics methods, this research aims to provide 
modern medical evidence for the theory of treating different diseases with the 
same method in traditional Chinese medicine.
METHODS: Omnibus from Swiss Target Prediction, TCMSP, SuperPred, SEA, HIT, CTD, 
TCMIP and Gene Expression Disease datasets for resveratrol related genes, 
Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease were obtained from the GEO 
database. Core targets were identified by weighted gene coexpression network 
analysis (WGCNA) and minimum absolute contraction and selection operator 
(LASSO). The expression of core targets was verified in AD and PD cell models. 
The immune characteristics of AD and PD were analyzed by CIBERSORT algorithm. 
Finally, the potential mechanism of resveratrol intervention on the core target 
was studied by molecular docking technique.
RESULTS: The results of network pharmacological analysis showed that resveratrol 
acted on 85 common targets such as STAT3 and CASP3, affected AGE-RAGE signaling 
pathway and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and showed the effect of "same disease 
and different treatment" for AD and PD. Three core targets associated with AD 
and PD (PLK4, FCGRT, and PRKAR2A) were finally identified through comprehensive 
transcriptome analysis, and experimentally verified in cell models of AD and PD. 
At the same time, the analysis of immune cell infiltration suggested that AD and 
PD had dysregulation of inflammation, and the core target was significantly 
related to M2 macrophages.
CONCLUSION: Resveratrol may play a potential mechanism of "treating the same 
disease with different diseases" and target three core targets (PLK4, FCGRT and 
PRKAR2A) to improve the disease process of AD and PD by participating in the 
regulation of immune and inflammatory pathways. These findings have potential 
implications for clinical practice and future research.

Systemic study of pathogenic pathways and interrelationships underlying genes 
associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) facilitates the identification of new 
targets for effective treatments. Recently available large-scale multiomics 
datasets provide opportunities to use computational approaches for such studies. 
Here, we devised a novel disease gene identification (digID) computational 
framework that consists of a semi-supervised deep learning classifier to predict 
AD-associated genes and a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network-based 
analysis to prioritize the importance of these predicted genes in AD. digID 
predicted 1,529 AD-associated genes and revealed potentially new AD molecular 
mechanisms and therapeutic targets including GNAI1 and GNB1, two G-protein 
subunits that regulate cell signaling, and KNG1, an upstream modulator of CDC42 
small G-protein signaling and mediator of inflammation and candidate coregulator 
of amyloid precursor protein (APP). Analysis of mRNA expression validated their 
dysregulation in AD brains but further revealed the significant spatial patterns 
in different brain regions as well as among different subregions of the frontal 
cortex and hippocampi. Super-resolution STochastic Optical Reconstruction 
Microscopy (STORM) further demonstrated their subcellular colocalization and 
molecular interactions with APP in a transgenic mouse model of both sexes with 
AD-like mutations. These studies support the predictions made by digID while 
highlighting the importance of concurrent biological validation of 
computationally identified gene clusters as potential new AD therapeutic 
targets.

been associated with neurodegenerative diseases, although direct mechanisms are 
poorly defined. Here, we report on a maturation process for the cellular prion 
protein (PrPC) that involves a conformational change after LLPS and is regulated 
by mutations and poly(4-styrenesulfonic acid-co-maleic acid) (PSCMA), a molecule 
that has been reported to rescue Alzheimer's disease-related cognitive deficits 
by antagonizing the interaction between PrPC and amyloid-β oligomers (Aβo). We 
show that PSCMA can induce reentrant LLPS of PrPC and lower the saturation 
concentration (Csat) of PrPC by 100-fold. Regardless of the induction method, 
PrPC molecules subsequently undergo a maturation process to restrict molecular 
motion in a more solid-like state. The PSCMA-induced LLPS of PrPC stabilizes the 
intermediate LLPS conformational state detected by NMR, though the final matured 
β-sheet-rich state of PrPC is indistinguishable between induction conditions. 
The disease-associated E200 K mutation of PrPC also accelerates maturation. This 
post-LLPS shift in protein conformation and dynamics is a possible mechanism of 
LLPS-induced neurodegeneration.

It has been shown that excitotoxicity and tau-mediated toxicities are major 
contributing factors to neuronal death in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The 
excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2 or GLT-1), the major glutamate 
transporter in the brain that regulates glutamate levels synaptically and 
extrasynaptically, has been shown to be deficient in AD brains, leading to 
excitotoxicity and subsequent cell death. Similarly, buildup of neurofibrillary 
tangles, which consist of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, correlates with 
cognitive decline and neuronal atrophy in AD. However, common genes and pathways 
that are critical in the aforementioned toxicities have not been well 
elucidated. To investigate the impact of glutamate dyshomeostasis and tau 
accumulation on translational profiles of affected hippocampal neurons, we used 
mouse models of excitotoxicity and tau-mediated toxicities (GLT-1-/- and P301S, 
respectively) in conjunction with BAC-TRAP technology. Our data show that GLT-1 
deficiency in CA3 pyramidal neurons leads to translational signatures 
characterized by dysregulation of pathways associated with synaptic plasticity 
and neuronal survival, while the P301S mutation induces changes in endocytic 
pathways and mitochondrial dysfunction. Finally, the commonly dysregulated 
pathways include impaired ion homeostasis and metabolic pathways. These common 
pathways may shed light on potential therapeutic targets for ameliorating 
glutamate and tau-mediated toxicities in AD.

Serum/Glucocorticoid Regulated Kinase 1 (SGK1), a serine/threonine kinase, is 
ubiquitous across a wide range of tissues, orchestrating numerous signaling 
pathways and associated with various human diseases. SGK1 has been extensively 
explored in diverse types of immune and inflammatory diseases, cardiovascular 
disorders, as well as cancer metastasis. These studies link SGK1 to cellular 
proliferation, survival, metabolism, membrane transport, and drug resistance. 
Recently, increasing research has focused on SGK1's role in neurological 
disorders, including a variety of neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's 
disease, Huntington's disease and Parkinson's disease), brain injuries (e.g., 
cerebral ischemia and traumatic brain injury), psychiatric conditions (e.g., 
depression and drug addiction). SGK1 is emerging as an increasingly compelling 
therapeutic target across the spectrum of neurological disorders, supported by 
the availability of several effective agents. However, the conclusions of many 
studies observing the prevalence and function of SGK1 in neurological disorders 
are contradictory, necessitating a review of the SGK1 research within 
neurological disorders. Herein, we review recent literature on SGK1's primary 
functions within the nervous system and its impacts within different 
neurological disorders. We summarize significant findings, identify research 
gaps, and outline possible future research directions based on the current 
understanding of SGK1 to help further progress the understanding and treatment 
of neurological disorders.

Cholesterol and its oxidative products-oxysterols homeostasis- play a crucial 
role in maintaining cognitive function. Chinese medicine KaiXinSan (KXS) has 
demonstrated effectiveness in treating mental illness and regulating cognitive 
dysfunction of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The purpose of this article is to 
explore whether the KXS can enhance cognitive function by regulating cholesterol 
homeostasis. Employing the 27-hydroxy cholesterol (27-OHC) induced mice model of 
cognitive dysfunction and coculture model of assessment neurocyte damage, we 
investigated learning and memory abilities while concurrently addressing the 
reduction of neuronal cell damage through the regulation of cholesterol 
metabolism. 21 days of KXS treatment improved the learning and memory ability in 
mice 27-OHC-overloading by alleviating the exacerbated deposition of amyloid-β 
(Aβ), reducing inflammatory reactions, and mitigating synaptic plasticity 
damage. Additionally, it repaired myelin sheath function. More importantly, KXS 
significantly affects the metabolism of central cholesterol by substantially 
inhibiting the expression of liver X receptor (LXR), ATP-binding cassette 
transporter (ABCA1, ABCG1), apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and upregulated cytochrome 
P450 46A1(CYP46A1). Furthermore, KXS may alleviate 27-OHC-induced neuronal 
inflammation and apoptosis by promoting the conversion of cholesterol to 
24-hydroxycholesterol (24-OHC) via CYP46A1 and suppressing cholesterol release 
from astrocyte cells. Altogether, our results demonstrate that KXS can prevent 
learning and memory impairments induced by 27-OHC loading. This effect may be 
related to its multitarget capability in promoting the conversion of excessive 
cholesterol to 24-OHC and maintaining a balance in cholesterol homeostasis and 
metabolism between neurons and astrocyte cells.

Saroglitazar (SGZ), a peroxisomal proliferated activated receptor α/γ agonist 
showed neuroprotective effects in various neurodegenerative disorders like 
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. However, no studies were performed on Huntington's, 
so the goal of the current study is to examine the effect of SGZ on Huntington's 
disease like symptoms induced by 3-Nitropropionic acid. In this protocol, 
twenty-four rats were divided into four groups, each group consisting of 6 
animals. Group 1: The control group received 1 % CMC 10 mg/kg, p.o. for 14 days. 
Groups 2, 3, and 4 received 3-NP 15 mg/kg, i.p. from Day 1 to Day 7. Groups 3 
and 4 received SGZ 5 mg/kg, p.o. and 10 mg/kg, p.o. respectively once daily from 
day 1 to day 14. Various behavioral tests like OFT, rotarod, hanging wire, 
narrow beam walk, MWM, and Y-maze were performed. On day-15, the animals were 
euthanised by cervical dislocation and brain sample were isolated for 
biochemical and histopathological analysis. Administration of 3-NP showed a 
significant decrease in motor coordination and cognitive function. Furthermore, 
3-NP altered the activity of acetylcholinesterase, anti-oxidant enzymes, Nrf-2, 
NF-κB, BDNF, CREB levels, and histological features. However, treatment with SGZ 
showed ameliorative effects in the 3-NP induced neurotoxicity via PPAR α/γ 
pathway by reducing motor dysfunction, memory impairment, cholinesterase levels, 
oxidative stress, neuroinflammation. It also enhanced the levels of Nrf-2, BDNF, 
and CREB expression and improved histological features. In conclusion, treatment 
with Saroglitazar attenuated Huntington's disease-like symptoms in rats which 
are induced by 3-NP via activation of PPAR α/γ pathway.

Alzheimer's disease, a neurodegenerative condition, is characterized by the slow 
and progressive deterioration of the cognitive functions of geriatric patients. 
It occurs due to exacerbation of neurons in the brain, indicated by loss of 
memory, mood instability, and even death. The aggregation of amyloid β protein 
and neurofibrillary tangles-atypical forms of tau protein is the major cause of 
this disease. Phytoconstituents have been frequently employed in treating 
Alzheimer's disease. These natural compounds act through different molecular 
mechanisms to treat the disease. However, their potential in Alzheimer's disease 
therapy may be limited due to poor blood-brain barrier permeability, off-target 
effects, low bioavailability, etc. In recent times, nanotechnology has gained 
attraction to overcome these challenges. This article focuses on the potential 
phytoconstituents for Alzheimer's disease treatment and the associated 
limitations. Moreover, it highlights various nanoformulation strategies employed 
to penetrate the blood-brain barrier effectively, avoid side effects, improve 
bioavailability, and target specificity in treating Alzheimer's disease. The 
integration of nanotechnology with plant-derived compounds has the potential to 
revolutionize the therapeutic landscape for Alzheimer's disease.

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) correlate with tau 
deposition in the brain. Here, we investigated the association of PET-based 
Braak stages with NPS and assessed whether they predict annual changes in NPS. 
We evaluated 231 individuals in the aging and AD continuum. Participants were 
assigned a Braak stage at baseline and followed for 1.97 (s.d. 0.62) years. NPS 
were investigated using the Mild Behavioral Impairment Checklist (MBI-C) and the 
Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire severity (NPI-Q-S) and distress 
(NPI-Q-D) scales. Multiple linear regressions (MLR) assessed the association of 
Braak stages with baseline NPS and the annual change in NPS scores. At baseline, 
stages I-II, III-IV, and V-VI were associated with higher MBI-C, NPI-Q-S, and 
NPI-Q-D scores. Stages V-VI were associated with a significant annual increase 
in MBI-C scores. These findings suggest that tau accumulation may manifest 
clinically with an increase in NPS, which seems to be an early event in AD 
pathophysiology. Moreover, PET-based Braak staging appears to be a good 
predictor of NPS severity progression.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Functional motor disorders (FMD) present a prevalent, yet 
misunderstood spectrum of neurological conditions characterized by abnormal 
movements (i.e., functional limb weakness, tremor, dystonia, gait impairments), 
leading to substantial disability and diminished quality of life. Despite their 
high prevalence, FMD often face delayed diagnosis and inadequate treatment, 
resulting in significant social and economic burdens. The old concept of 
psychological factors as the primary cause (conversion disorder) has been 
abandoned due to the need for more evidence about their causal role. According 
to a predictive coding account, the emerging idea is that symptoms and 
disability may depend on dysfunctions of a specific neural system integrating 
interoception, exteroception, and motor control. Consequently, symptoms are 
construed as perceptions of the body's state. Besides the main 
pathophysiological features (abnormal attentional focus, beliefs/expectations, 
and sense of agency), the lived experience of symptoms and their resulting 
disability may depend on an altered integration at the neural level of 
interoception, exteroception, and motor control.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Our proposal aims to elucidate the pathophysiological 
mechanisms of FMD through a three-stage research approach. Initially, a large 
cohort study will collect behavioral, neurophysiological, and MRI biomarkers 
from patients with FMD and healthy controls, employing eXplainable Artificial 
Intelligence (XAI) to develop a diagnostic algorithm. Subsequently, validation 
will occur using patients with organic motor disorders. Finally, the algorithm's 
prognostic value will be explored post-rehabilitation in one subgroup of 
patients with FMD.
RESULTS: Data collection for the present study started in May 2023, and by May 
2025, data collection will conclude.
DISCUSSION: Our approach seeks to enhance early diagnosis and prognostication, 
improve FMD management, and reduce associated disability and socio-economic 
costs by identifying disease-specific biomarkers.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered in clinicaltrials.gov 
(NCT06328790).

We previously reported that the peptide ST2-104 (CBD3, for Ca2+ channel-binding 
domain 3), derived from the collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2)-a 
cytosolic phosphoprotein, protects neuroblastoma cells against β-amyloid (Aβ) 
peptide-mediated toxicity through engagement of a phosphorylated CRMP2/NMDAR 
pathway. Abnormal aggregation of Aβ peptides (e.g., Aβ25-35) leads to programmed 
cell death (apoptosis) as well autophagy-both of which contribute to Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) progression. Here, we asked if ST2-104 affects apoptosis and 
autophagy in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma challenged with the toxic Aβ25-35 peptide and 
subsequently mapped the downstream signaling pathways involved. ST2-104 
protected SH-SY5Y cells from death following Aβ25-35 peptide challenge by 
reducing apoptosis and autophagy as well as limiting excessive calcium entry. 
Cytotoxicity of SHY-SY5Y cells challenged with Aβ25-35 peptide was blunted by 
ST2-104. The autophagy activator Rapamycin blunted the anti-apoptotic activity 
of ST2-104. ST2-104 reversed Aβ25-35-induced apoptosis via inhibiting 
Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase kinase β (CaMKKβ)-mediated autophagy, which 
was partly enhanced by STO-609 (an inhibitor of CaMKKβ). ST2-104 attenuated 
neuronal apoptosis by inhibiting autophagy through a CaMKKβ/AMPK/mTOR signaling 
hub. These findings identify a mechanism whereby, in the face of Aβ25-35, the 
concerted actions of ST2-104 leads to a reduction in intracellular calcium 
overload and inhibition of the CaMKKβ/AMPK/mTOR pathway resulting in attenuation 
of autophagy and cellular apoptosis. These findings define a mechanistic 
framework for how ST2-104 transduces "outside" (calcium channels) to "inside" 
signaling (CaMKKβ/AMPK/mTOR) to confer neuroprotection in AD.

Tau hyperphosphorylation and accumulation in neurofibrillary tangles are closely 
associated with cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Glycogen 
synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) overexpression has been implicated in tau 
hyperphosphorylation, and many GSK3β inhibitors have been developed as potential 
therapeutic candidates for AD. However, the potent GSK3β inhibitors produced are 
prone to side effects because they can interfere with the basic functions of 
GSK3β. We previously found that when the phosphorylated PPPSPxS motifs in Wnt 
coreceptor LRP6 can directly inhibit GSK3β, and thus, we produced a novel GSK3β 
inhibitory peptide (GIP), specifically activated by Akt, by combining the 
PPPSPxS motif of LRP6 and the Akt targeted sequence (RxRxxS) of GSK3β. GIP 
effectively blocked GSK3β-induced tau phosphorylation in hippocampal homogenates 
and, when fused with a cell-permeable sequence, attenuated Aβ-induced tau 
phosphorylation in human neuroblastoma cells and inhibited cell death. An in 
vivo study using a 3 × Tg-AD mouse model revealed that intravenous GIP 
significantly reduced tau phosphorylation in the hippocampus without affecting 
Aβ plaque levels or neuroinflammation and ameliorated memory defects. The study 
provides a novel neuroprotective drug development strategy targeting tau 
hyperphosphorylation in AD.

CONTEXT: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia around the 
world, totaling about 55 million cases, with an estimated growth to 74.7 million 
cases in 2030, which makes its treatment widely desired. Several studies and 
strategies are being developed considering the main theories regarding its 
origin since it is not yet fully understood. Among these strategies, the 5-HT6 
receptor antagonism emerges as an auspicious and viable symptomatic treatment 
approach for AD. The 5-HT6 receptor belongs to the G protein-coupled receptor 
(GPCR) family and is closely implicated in memory loss processes. As a serotonin 
receptor, it plays an important role in cognitive function. Consequently, 
targeting this receptor presents a compelling therapeutic opportunity. By 
employing antagonists to block its activity, the 5-HT6 receptor's functions can 
be effectively modulated, leading to potential improvements in cognition and 
memory.
METHODS: Addressing this challenge, our research explored a promising avenue in 
drug discovery for AD, employing Artificial Neural Networks-Quantitative 
Structure-Activity Relationship (ANN-QSAR) models. These models have 
demonstrated great potential in predicting the biological activity of compounds 
based on their molecular structures. By harnessing the capabilities of machine 
learning and computational chemistry, we aimed to create a systematic approach 
for analyzing and forecasting the activity of potential drug candidates, thus 
streamlining the drug discovery process. We assembled a diverse set of compounds 
targeting this receptor and utilized density functional theory (DFT) 
calculations to extract essential molecular descriptors, effectively 
representing the structural features of the compounds. Subsequently, these 
molecular descriptors served as input for training the ANN-QSAR models alongside 
corresponding biological activity data, enabling us to predict the potential 
efficacy of novel compounds as 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 6 (5-HT6) 
antagonists. Through extensive analysis and validation of ANN-QSAR models, we 
identified eight new promising compounds with therapeutic potential against AD.

Barrier: Structural Implications and Therapeutic Potential.

L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) is integral to the transport of large 
neutral amino acids across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), playing a crucial role 
in brain homeostasis and the delivery of therapeutic agents. This review 
explores the multifaceted role of LAT1 in neurological disorders, including its 
structural and functional aspects at the BBB. Studies using advanced BBB models, 
such as induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived systems and quantitative 
proteomic analyses, have demonstrated LAT1's significant impact on drug 
permeability and transport efficiency. In Alzheimer's disease, LAT1-mediated 
delivery of anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective agents shows promise in 
overcoming BBB limitations. In Parkinson's disease, LAT1's role in transporting 
L-DOPA and other therapeutic agents highlights its potential in enhancing 
treatment efficacy. In phenylketonuria, studies have revealed polymorphisms and 
genetic variations of LAT1, which could be correlated to disease severity. 
Prodrugs of valproic acid, pregabalin, and gabapentin help use LAT1-mediated 
transport to increase the therapeutic activity and bioavailability of the 
prodrug in the brain. LAT1 has also been studied in neurodevelopment disorders 
like autism spectrum disorders and Rett syndrome, along with neuropsychiatric 
implications in depression. Its implications in neuro-oncology, especially in 
transporting therapeutic agents into cancer cells, show immense future 
potential. Phenotypes of LAT1 have also shown variations in the general 
population affecting their ability to respond to painkillers and 
anti-inflammatory drugs. Furthermore, LAT1-targeted approaches, such as 
functionalized nanoparticles and prodrugs, show promise in overcoming 
chemoresistance and enhancing drug delivery to the brain. The ongoing 
exploration of LAT1's structural characteristics and therapeutic applications 
reiterates its critical role in advancing treatments for neurological disorders.

While amyloidopathy and tauopathy have been recognized as hallmarks in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain, recently, increasing lines of evidence have 
supported the pathological roles of cerebrovascular changes in the pathogenesis 
and progression of AD. Restoring or ameliorating the impaired cerebrovascular 
function during the early phase of the disease may yield benefits against the 
cognitive decline in AD. In the present study, we evaluated the potential 
therapeutic effects of nicergoline [NG, a well-known α1 adrenergic receptor 
(ADR) blocker and vasodilator] against AD through ameliorating vascular 
abnormalities. Our in vitro data revealed that NG could reverse β-amyloid1-42 
(Aβ1-42)-induced PKC/ERK1/2 activation, the downstream pathway of α1-ADR 
activation, in α1-ADR-overexpressed N2a cells. NG also blocked Aβ1-42- or 
phenylephrine-induced constrictions in isolated rat arteries. All these in vitro 
data may suggest ADR-dependent impacts of Aβ on vascular function and the 
reversal effect of NG. In addition, the ameliorating impacts of NG treatment on 
cerebral vasoconstriction, vasoremodeling, and cognitive decline were 
investigated in vivo in a PSAPP transgenic AD mouse model. Consistent with in 
vitro findings, the chronic treatment of NG significantly ameliorated the 
cerebrovascular dysfunctions and Aβ plaque depositions in the brain. Moreover, 
an improved cognitive performance was also observed. Taken together, our 
findings supported the beneficial effects of NG on AD through adrenergic-related 
mechanisms and highlighted the therapeutic potential of α1-adrenergic 
vasomodulators against AD pathologies.

INTRODUCTION: The multifactorial influence of repetitive transcranial magnetic 
stimulation (rTMS) on neuroplasticity in neural networks is associated with 
improvements in cognitive dysfunction and sleep disorders. The mechanisms of 
rTMS and the transcriptional-neuronal correlation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
patients with sleep disorders have not been fully elucidated.
METHODS: Forty-six elderly participants with cognitive impairment (23 patients 
with low sleep quality and 23 patients with high sleep quality) underwent 4-week 
periods of neuronavigated rTMS of the angular gyrus and neuroimaging tests, and 
gene expression data for six post mortem brains were collected from another 
database. Transcription-neuroimaging association analysis was used to evaluate 
the effects on cognitive dysfunction and the underlying biological mechanisms 
involved.
RESULTS: Distinct variable neuroplasticity in the anterior and posterior angular 
gyrus networks was detected in the low sleep quality group. These interactions 
were associated with multiple gene pathways, and the comprehensive effects were 
associated with improvements in episodic memory.
DISCUSSION: Multitrajectory neuroplasticity is associated with complex 
biological mechanisms in AD-spectrum patients with sleep disorders.
HIGHLIGHTS: This was the first transcription-neuroimaging study to demonstrate 
that multitrajectory neuroplasticity in neural circuits was induced via 
neuronavigated rTMS, which was associated with complex gene expression in 
AD-spectrum patients with sleep disorders. The interactions between sleep 
quality and neuronavigated rTMS were coupled with multiple gene pathways and 
improvements in episodic memory. The present strategy for integrating 
neuroimaging, rTMS intervention, and genetic data provide a new approach to 
comprehending the biological mechanisms involved in AD.

INTRODUCTION: Hearing loss is identified as one of the largest modifiable risk 
factors for cognitive impairment and dementia. Studies evaluating this 
relationship have yielded mixed results.
METHODS: We investigated the longitudinal relationship between self-reported 
hearing loss and cognitive/functional performance in 695 cognitively normal (CN) 
and 941 participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) enrolled in the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.
RESULTS: Within CN participants with hearing loss, there was a significantly 
greater rate of cognitive decline per modified preclinical Alzheimer's cognitive 
composite. Within both CN and MCI participants with hearing loss, there was a 
significantly greater rate of functional decline per the functional activities 
questionnaire (FAQ). In CN and MCI participants, hearing loss did not 
significantly contribute to the risk of progression to a more impaired 
diagnosis.
DISCUSSION: These results confirm previous studies demonstrating a significant 
longitudinal association between self-reported hearing loss and 
cognition/function but do not demonstrate an increased risk of conversion to a 
more impaired diagnosis.

HIGHLIGHTS: Hearing loss is a potential modifiable risk factor for dementia. We 
assessed the effect of self-reported hearing loss on cognition and function in 
the ADNI cohort. Hearing loss contributes to significantly faster cognitive and 
functional decline. Hearing loss was not associated with conversion to a more 
impaired diagnosis.

INTRODUCTION: We investigated longitudinal associations between self-reported 
exercise and Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related biomarkers in individuals with 
autosomal dominant AD (ADAD) mutations.
METHODS: Participants were 308 ADAD mutation carriers aged 39.7 ± 10.8 years 
from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer's Network. Weekly exercise volume was 
measured via questionnaire and associations with brain volume (magnetic 
resonance imaging), cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, and brain amyloid beta (Aβ) 
measured by positron emission tomography were investigated.
RESULTS: Greater volume of weekly exercise at baseline was associated with 
slower accumulation of brain Aβ at preclinical disease stages β = -0.16 [-0.23 
to -0.08], and a slower decline in multiple brain regions including hippocampal 
volume β = 0.06 [0.03 to 0.08].
DISCUSSION: Exercise is associated with more favorable profiles of AD-related 
biomarkers in individuals with ADAD mutations. Exercise may have therapeutic 
potential for delaying the onset of AD; however, randomized controlled trials 
are vital to determine a causal relationship before a clinical recommendation of 
exercise is implemented.
HIGHLIGHTS: Greater self-reported weekly exercise predicts slower declines in 
brain volume in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (ADAD). Greater
