INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is triggered by biological mechanisms 
such as neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 
stress can lead to the expression of molecular chaperones in the ER, which helps 
in restoring cellular homeostasis. Researchers have highlighted the role of ER 
stress in the progression of AD, suggesting that regulating it could be a 
potential treatment strategy for AD.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We induced AD in mice by injecting amyloid beta-peptide 
25-35 (Aβ25-35) bilaterally into the CA1 of the dorsal hippocampus. Some mice 
were administered celastrol intraperitoneally before the Aβ25-35 injection, 
while others received it after the injection. The mice underwent the Barnes maze 
cognitive test and Morris water maze test to assess learning and memory 
impairment. Levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor α, and IL-10 
were measured to evaluate inflammation, while total antioxidant capacity, 
catalase, malondialdehyde, and superoxide dismutase levels were analyzed to 
estimate oxidative stress.
RESULTS: Our study showed that pre-treatment with celastrol could prevent 
learning and memory decline in AD mice by reducing inflammation and oxidative 
stress. Celastrol also inhibited AD-induced inflammation and oxidative stress. 
Additionally, celastrol suppressed AD progression by targeting ER stress. These 
results suggest that celastrol treatment could be beneficial in addressing 
learning and memory deficits in AD, paving the way for potential neuroprotective 
treatments.
CONCLUSIONS: Celastrol effectively improved learning and memory impairments in 
AD mice by targeting ER stress-induced inflammation and oxidative stress. This 
highlights the potential of celastrol as a therapeutic agent for AD.

Alzheimer's disease is characterized by cholinergic dysfunction and 
neuroinflammation, with acetylcholinesterase and monoacylglycerol lipase 
emerging as important therapeutic targets. In this study, a series of novel 
flavonoid carbamate derivatives were synthesized from chrysin and kaempferol, 
and their structures were confirmed via NMR and HRMS spectroscopy. The 
inhibitory activities of these compounds were evaluated against 
acetylcholinesterase and monoacylglycerol lipase using in vitro enzymatic 
assays. Among them, C3 and C5 exhibited significant dual inhibition, with IC50 
values of 22.86 μM and 46.65 μM for monoacylglycerol lipase, and 61.78 μM and 
89.40 μM for acetylcholinesterase, respectively. Molecular docking studies 
revealed key binding interactions, while molecular dynamics simulations 
demonstrated their stability within the active sites of target enzymes. These 
findings highlight C3 and C5 as promising candidates for further investigation 
in the development of dual acetylcholinesterase/monoacylglycerol lipase 
inhibitors for Alzheimer's disease treatment.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the 
loss of neural connections and decreased brain tissue volume. Initially 
affecting the hippocampus and entorhinal complex, which are responsible for 
memory, the disease later impacts the cerebral cortex, controlling language, 
logic, and social conduct. While the exact cause is unknown, genetic mutations 
and environmental factors are implicated. Diagnosis involves computed tomography 
(CT) scans, Magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs), Positron emission tomography 
(PET) scans, and lumbar punctures to detect brain abnormalities, protein 
deposits, and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers. AD features beta-amyloid plaques 
and neurofibrillary tau tangles that disrupt neuronal function, chronic 
inflammation, blood-brain barrier impairment, brain atrophy, and neuronal death. 
There is no cure; current treatments manage symptoms and slow cognitive decline. 
Research into genetic, cellular, and molecular pathways aims to develop targeted 
therapies. Tau tangle accumulation is closely linked to AD, making it crucial to 
explore therapies that restore normal tau pathways and prevent tau accumulation. 
Nanoparticulate drug delivery technologies offer promise in this area. This 
review discusses the potential of nanotechnology-based therapies to target 
AD-related tau accumulation and restore normal tau protein mechanics, which 
could preserve neuronal transmission, synaptic integrity, and brain tissue 
volume.

BACKGROUND: Preclinical studies suggest that creatine monohydrate (CrM) improves 
cognition and Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers. However, there is currently 
no clinical evidence demonstrating the effects of CrM in patients with AD.
METHODS: In this single-arm pilot trial, we investigated the feasibility of 
20 g/day CrM for 8 weeks in 20 patients with AD. We measured compliance 
throughout; serum creatine at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks; and brain total 
creatine (tCr) and cognition (National Institutes of Health [NIH] Toolbox, 
Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE]) at baseline and 8 weeks.
RESULTS: Nineteen participants achieved the target of ≥80% compliance with the 
CrM intervention. Serum Cr was elevated at 4 and 8 weeks (p < .001) and brain 
tCr increased by 11% (p < .001). Cognition improved on global (p = .02) and 
fluid (p = .004) composites, List Sorting (p = .001), Oral Reading (p < .001), 
and Flanker (p = .05) tests.
DISCUSSION: Our data suggest that CrM supplementation is feasible in AD and 
provides preliminary evidence for future efficacy and mechanism studies.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05383833, registered on May 20, 2022.
HIGHLIGHTS: Creatine monohydrate supplementation was feasible in patients with 
Alzheimer's disease.Creatine monohydrate was associated with increased brain 
total creatine.Creatine monohydrate was associated with improvements in 
cognition.Efficacy of creatine monohydrate in Alzheimer's disease should be 
studied further.

The complex interrelation of gut microbiota with human health underlines the 
profound influence this microbial ecosystem has on mechanisms of disease and 
wellness. The gut microbiome profoundly impacts various human diseases, 
encompassing gastrointestinal disorders, metabolic disorders, neurological 
disorders, and immune-related diseases. Gastrointestinal disorders are closely 
linked to microbial imbalances in the gut. Metabolic disorders, including 
obesity and type 2 diabetes, are influenced by the gut microbiota's role in 
energy regulation and glucose metabolism. Furthermore, the gut-brain axis 
highlights the correlation between gut microbiota and neurological conditions 
such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Moreover, the gut microbiome assumes a 
pivotal function in regulating the immune system, whereby dysbiosis is 
implicated in developing immunological-related ailments, including allergies and 
autoimmune disorders. Predisposing factors, including diet, medicines, 
lifestyle, and environmental influences, are described as having an important 
role in the composition of the gut microbiome. By understanding these factors, 
we can get valuable insights into how to intervene to reduce the chances of a 
disease. Current interventions, including probiotics, prebiotics, fecal 
microbiota transplants, and lifestyle modification, show promise, but there are 
still challenges and unanswered questions in this evolving field that may lead 
to improvements. This review interrelates the complicated gut microbiome with 
various human diseases, mechanisms, predisposing factors, and potential 
interventions.

Tau is a microtubule-associated protein (MAP) and is critical for maintaining 
the cytoskeleton of neurons. Tau and its post-translational modifications (PTMs) 
have been studied for decades, yet the exact composition of intact tau and its 
truncation products present in the human brain has evaded study at the 
proteoform level. Here, we show that tau proteoform profiling and exact 
characterization are possible using immunoprecipitation (IP) and the new 
approach of individual ion mass spectrometry (I2MS). We provide a first glimpse 
of the tau proteoform landscape present in the CHAPS-soluble extracts from the 
temporal cortex of a control subject and a donor with Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Profiling and identification of four isoforms (0N3R, 1N3R, 0N4R, and 1N4R), 
truncated products (e.g., 72-172 derived from the 0N3R/0N4R isoforms), and 
intact tau proteoforms harboring PTMs include phosphorylation, methylation, and 
acetylation. The specific tau proteoform identification typically employs proton 
transfer charge reduction (PTCR) and electron transfer dissociation (ETD) with 
spectral readout by individual ion tandem mass spectrometry (I2MS2). A precise 
understanding of the tau proteoform landscape over the course of 
neurodegeneration is critical to understand AD pathology vs related dementias. 
The assay approach reported here will advance AD research, gives a sense of what 
is technologically possible for new biomarker discovery and will assist the 
development of therapeutics using the most exact kind of compositional 
information on tau.

BACKGROUND: Recent studies emphasize the significance of copper dyshomeostasis 
in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, thereby 
highlighting the role of copper in neurotoxicity. Cuproptosis, a novel mechanism 
of copper-dependent cell death, remains underexplored, particularly concerning 
environmental pollutants like polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NPs). While PS-NPs 
are recognized for inducing neurotoxicity through various forms of cell death, 
including apoptosis and ferroptosis, their potential to trigger neuronal 
cuproptosis has not yet been investigated. This study aims to determine whether 
exposure to PS-NPs induces neurotoxicity via cuproptosis and to explore the 
preliminary molecular mechanisms involved, thereby addressing this significant 
knowledge gap.
METHODS: Seven-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were exposed to PS-NPs at dose of 
12.5 mg/kg, and were co-treated with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC). 
Complementary in vitro experiments were conducted using SH-SY5Y neuronal cells 
exposed to PS-NPs at a concentration of 0.75 mg/mL, with interventions that 
included the copper chelator tetrathiomolybdate (TTM), NAC, and the MAPK 
inhibitor PD98059.
RESULTS: Exposure to PS-NPs significantly increased cerebral copper accumulation 
(P < 0.05) and induced cuproptosis, characterized by lipid-acylated DLAT 
oligomerization, dysregulation of cuproptosis regulators (FDX1, LIAS, HSP70), 
and mitochondrial damage. In murine models, PS-NPs elicited neurotoxicity, as 
evidenced by neuronal loss, decreased Nissl body density, impaired synaptic 
plasticity, and suppressed oxidative stress markers (GSH, SOD, Nrf2), alongside 
activation of the ERK-MAPK pathway, ultimately resulting in deficits in learning 
and memory. Treatment with NAC alleviated these adverse effects. In SH-SY5Y 
cells, exposure to PS-NPs resulted in reduced cell viability (p < 0.01), an 
effect that was mitigated by TTM. Furthermore, NAC and PD98059 were found to 
reverse elevated copper levels, cuproptosis markers, and mitochondrial anomalies 
(p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: This study presents preliminary evidence indicating that PS-NPs may 
induce neuronal cuproptosis, potentially through the oxidative stress-mediated 
activation of the ERK-MAPK pathway, which contributes to cognitive dysfunction 
in mice. These findings provide insights into the potential mechanisms 
underlying PS-NPs neurotoxicity and highlight possible therapeutic targets, such 
as copper chelation or MAPK inhibition, for mitigating the neurological risks 
associated with nanoplastic exposure, pending further validation in 
human-relevant models.

BACKGROUND: Cannabidiol (CBD), the second most abundant phytocannabinoid in 
Cannabis sativa, has garnered significant interest due to its non-psychoactive 
nature and diverse receptor interactions.
METHODS: This study employs in vitro and in vivo methodologies to validate CBD's 
potential as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD) by addressing key 
hallmarks of the condition and promoting neuroprotective effects on spatial 
memory.
RESULTS: Our findings demonstrate CBD's ability to decrease pTau and Aβ 
aggregation and to mitigate their axonal transport between cortical and 
hippocampal neurons. Moreover, CBD treatment was shown to reduce 
neuroinflammation, as CBD was able to skew microglia towards a neuroprotective 
M2 phenotype while attenuating proinflammatory cytokine release in the 5xFAD AD 
mouse model. Notably, daily CBD injections (10 mg/Kg) for 28 days in 5xFAD mice 
resulted in significant improvements in both short- and long-term spatial 
memory. The study also reveals CBD's capacity to partially revert neurite 
formation loss induced by Aβ, Tau, and pTau proteins, suggesting a potential 
role in promoting neuronal plasticity. Additionally, CBD treatment led to a 
reduction in reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and increased neuronal 
viability in the presence of AD-associated protein aggregates.
CONCLUSIONS: These multifaceted effects of CBD, ranging from molecular-level 
modulation to behavioral improvements, underscore its potential as a 
comprehensive therapeutic approach for AD. The findings not only support CBD's 
neuroprotective properties but also highlight its ability to target multiple 
pathological processes simultaneously, offering a promising avenue for future AD 
treatment strategies.

BACKGROUND: Rapamycin has been shown to extend lifespan and acts on pathologies 
underlying Alzheimer's disease and related dementias in animal models. However, 
rapamycin's clinical application remains underexplored.
METHODS: We conducted a single-site open-label phase 1 clinical trial 
(ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04200911) to examine the effects of rapamycin in humans. 
Eligible participants were people 55-85 years old with mild cognitive impairment 
or early-stage dementia, which was defined as having a Global Clinical Dementia 
Rating Scale Score of 0.5-1. All participants received rapamycin (1 mg/day) for 
eight weeks. The primary aim was to evaluate rapamycin's central nervous system 
penetrance by assaying drug levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) before and 
after treatment. Secondary aims evaluated safety, cognition, Alzheimer's 
disease, and inflammatory biomarkers in the CSF and plasma.
RESULTS: In ten participants (mean age 74 ± 4 years, 60% female), we find that 
rapamycin is not detectable in the CSF before or after treatment. After 
treatment, we find that twenty, mostly mild adverse events occur, systolic blood 
pressure and hemoglobin A1c increase, multiple erythrocyte parameters decrease, 
and there are no significant cognitive changes. Furthermore, we find that CSF 
phosphorylated tau-181 (mean change (95% confidence interval) pg/ml), 2.64 
[0.70-4.59]), glial fibrillary acidic protein (6262.21 [3787.44-9373.84]), and 
neurofilament light (367.19 [204.28-561.61]) and plasma interferon gamma (4.37 
[3.01-5.74]), interleukin 5 (0.33 [0.12-0.64]), vascular endothelial growth 
factor D (3741.03 [1505.98-5976.07]), soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (258.88 
[89.03-428.74]) and placental growth factor (20.81 [12.38-29.25]) significantly 
increase (FDR-corrected p-value < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Rapamycin is not detectable in the CSF before or after treatment, 
but several Alzheimer's disease and inflammatory biomarkers increase after 
treatment. Our results highlight the need to better understand the biological 
effects and clinical impact of repurposing rapamycin for Alzheimer's disease.

Plain Language Summary: The drug rapamycin has been shown to increase longevity 
and reverse changes in the brain associated with Alzheimer’s disease and related 
dementias in animal models. However, rapamycin’s role in the clinical setting is 
unclear. Here we show data from a phase 1 clinical trial in ten participants 
with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s disease who were treated with 
rapamycin (1 mg/day) for eight weeks. Findings show that rapamycin levels were 
not detectable in cerebrospinal fluid before or after treatment. All 
participants knew they were receiving rapamycin and did not experience any 
serious negative health events due to the treatment. Additionally, several 
Alzheimer’s disease and inflammatory biomarkers were increased from baseline to 
post-treatment. These results highlight the need to better understand the impact 
of rapamycin on Alzheimer’s disease in humans.

Individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus have an increased risk of developing 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are used for 
glycemic control in diabetes and show potential neuroprotective properties, but 
their effects on AD and the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here 
we demonstrate that GLP-1RAs can alleviate AD-related phenotypes by activating 
5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling. We found that plasma GLP-1 
levels were decreased in AD model mice and negatively correlated with 
amyloid-beta (Aβ) load in patients with AD. Enhancing GLP-1 signaling through 
GLP-1RAs increased CaMKK2-AMPK signaling, which subsequently reduced 
BACE1-mediated cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Aβ generation. 
GLP-1RAs also increased AMPK activity in microglia, inhibiting neuroinflammation 
and promoting Aβ phagocytosis. Consequently, GLP-1RAs inhibited plaque formation 
and improved memory deficits in AD model mice. Our findings indicate that AMPK 
activation mediates the effects of GLP-1RAs on AD, highlighting the therapeutic 
potential of GLP-1RAs for the treatment of AD.

Proteomic studies have been instrumental in identifying brain, cerebrospinal 
fluid and plasma proteins associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we 
comprehensively examined 6,905 aptamers corresponding to 6,106 unique proteins 
in plasma in more than 3,300 well-characterized individuals to identify new 
proteins, pathways and predictive models for AD. We identified 416 proteins (294 
new) associated with clinical AD status and validated the findings in two 
external datasets representing more than 7,000 samples. AD-related proteins 
reflected blood-brain barrier disruption and other processes implicated in AD, 
such as lipid dysregulation or immune responses. A machine learning model was 
used to identify a set of seven proteins that were highly predictive of both 
clinical AD (area under the curve (AUC) of >0.72) and biomarker-defined AD 
status (AUC of >0.88), which were replicated in multiple external cohorts and 
orthogonal platforms. These findings underscore the potential of using plasma 
proteins as biomarkers for the early detection and monitoring of AD and for 
guiding treatment decisions.

Metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance and hypertension are potential 
risk factors for aging and neurodegenerative diseases. These conditions are 
reversed in Chromogranin A (CgA) knockout (CgA-KO) mice. CgA is known to be 
associated with protein aggregates in the brains of neurodegenerative diseases 
including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we investigated the role of CgA in Tau 
pathogenesis in AD and corticobasal degeneration (CBD). CgA ablation in 
Tauopathy mice (PS19) (CgA-KO/PS19) reduced pathological Tau aggregation and 
spreading, extended lifespan, and improved cognitive function. Transcriptomic 
and metabolite analysis of mouse cortices revealed elevated alpha-1-adrenergic 
receptors (Adra1) expression and high Epinephrine (EPI) levels in PS19 mice 
compared to WT mice, mirroring observations in AD and CBD patients. CgA 
depletion in PS19 mice lowered cortical EPI levels and the expression of Adra1 
back to normal. Treatment of WT hippocampal organotypic slice cultures with EPI 
or Adra1 agonist promoted, while an Adra1 antagonist inhibited Tau 
hyperphosphorylation and formation of neurofibrillary tangles, which is 
unaltered upon CgA depletion. These findings demonstrate the involvement of CgA 
in Tau pathogenesis and highlight the interplay between the EPI-Adra1 signaling 
pathway and CgA in Tauopathy.

The field of Alzheimer's disease (AD) drug development is rapidly changing, with 
two anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) having received Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) approval, additionally many compounds are in the pipeline. 
A major obstacle for novel AD therapeutics is the blood-brain barrier (BBB), 
which restricts passage of particles larger than 400-500 Da. It is estimated 
that only ∼0.1 % of mAbs, being ∼150 kDa, passes the BBB, which greatly hampers 
the efficacy of treatment. To enhance treatment efficacy and to lower the drug 
dose needed, mechanisms that effectively increase drug delivery across the BBB 
are urgently sought for. This narrative review describes three promising 
strategies to enhance drug delivery across the BBB in AD: focused ultrasound 
(FUS) with microbubbles, receptor-mediated transcytosis (RMT) and delivery using 
nanoparticle carrier systems. FUS and RMT have shown promising preclinical 
results and are now being tested in humans whereas nanoparticle carrier systems 
still need further preclinical validation before clinical application in humans. 
89Zr-Immuno-PET provides a unique opportunity to noninvasively monitor and 
quantitatively assess novel brain delivery methods.

The year 2025 marks the 180th anniversary of the first documented synthesis of 
apomorphine, and the first U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of a 
subcutaneous apomorphine infusion device for advanced Parkinson's disease 
(SPN-830). This narrative review therefore aims to examine apomorphine clinical 
journey, celebrating its turbulent yet founding past, analyzing its current 
challenges in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) and envisioning its 
promising future, both in neurological disorders and beyond. Enduring 
misconceptions and the lack of class 1 evidence for supporting the use of 
continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusion (CSAI) in PD have long been thought 
to have prevented its generalized use. The TOLEDO study, which robustly 
demonstrated a clinically meaningful reduction in off time (as expected based on 
decades of clinical experience) has now removed this barrier. Challenges to be 
addressed moving forward include (1) redefining the place of apomorphine in the 
PD treatment paradigm (from early use to terminal care), (2) reducing access 
disparities (availability, cost), (3) improving delivery systems and apomorphine 
formulations, and (4) expanding clinical use both in and outside of neurological 
disorders, with already tangible results for atypical Parkinsonian syndromes and 
disorders of consciousness, and promising perspectives in Alzheimer's disease.

OBJECTIVE: A growing body of evidence points to a role for herpesviruses in the 
development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and a reduced risk of AD among patients 
receiving antiherpetic medications. We investigated the association between 
herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and AD using real-world data (RWD) from USA.
DESIGN: In a matched case-control study, patients with AD aged ≥50 years 
diagnosed between 2006 and 2021 were identified from the IQVIA PharMetrics Plus 
claims database. Controls were matched in a 1:1 ratio with subjects with AD on 
age, sex, region, database entry year and healthcare visit numbers.
RESULTS: The study included 344 628 AD case-control pairs. History of HSV-1 
diagnosis was present in 1507 (0.44%) patients with AD compared with 823 (0.24%) 
controls. HSV-1 diagnosis was found to be associated with AD (adjusted OR 1.80; 
95% CI 1.65 to 1.96). Patients with HSV-1 who used antiherpetics were less 
likely to develop AD compared with those who did not use antiherpetics (adjusted 
HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.92).
CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this large RWD study implicate HSV-1 in the 
development of AD and highlight antiherpetic therapies as potentially protective 
for AD and related dementia.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence and prevalence of dementia in a nationally 
representative cohort of US Medicare beneficiaries, stratified by important 
subgroups.
DESIGN: Population based study.
SETTING: Nationwide study between 2015 and 2021.
PARTICIPANTS: Fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries aged 66 or older with at 
least one year of continuous enrollment.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence and prevalence of dementia, calculated as 
percentage per person years or percentage of beneficiaries respectively. These 
metrics were also calculated in key subgroups defined by age, sex, 
race/ethnicity, and neighborhood socioeconomic status.
RESULTS: A total of 5 025 039 incident cases of dementia were documented from 
2015 to 2021. The overall age and sex standardized incidence decreased between 
2015 and 2021 from 3.5% to 2.8%. Prevalence increased during this time from 
10.5% to 11.8%. Male beneficiaries had a higher age standardized incidence than 
did female beneficiaries in 2015 (3.5% v 3.4%), a difference that widened by 
2021 (2.9% v 2.6%; estimated difference-in-difference 0.94, 95% confidence 
interval (CI) 0.94 to 0.95; P<0.001). Incidence was highest in 2015 for black 
beneficiaries (4.2%), followed by Hispanic beneficiaries (3.7%) and white 
beneficiaries (3.4%), and in 2021 for black beneficiaries (3.1%) followed by 
white beneficiaries (2.8%) and Hispanic beneficiaries (2.6%); the difference 
between white and black beneficiaries narrowed from 2015 to 2021 
(difference-in-difference 0.92, 95% CI 0.91 to 0.93; P<0.001) as did the 
difference between white and Hispanic beneficiaries (difference-in-difference 
0.88, 0.87 to 0.89; P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of dementia decreased from 2015 to 2021, but the 
prevalence increased. Disparities in these measures by race/ethnicity, sex, and 
neighborhood socioeconomic status should motivate future measures to promote 
health equity.

The blood-brain barrier (BBB) serves as a highly selective interface that 
regulates the transport of molecules between the blood and the brain. Its 
integrity is essential for maintaining neuronal homeostasis and preventing 
neuroinflammation. Hyperglycemia, a hallmark of diabetes, is linked to cognitive 
deficits and central nervous system (CNS) pathologies, including vascular 
dementia, stroke, and Alzheimer's disease, with BBB damage as a potential 
contributing factor. As the global prevalence of diabetes rises, understanding 
the connection between hyperglycemia and BBB dysfunction may facilitate the 
development of novel treatments that protect or restore BBB integrity, thereby 
alleviating the neurological complications of diabetes. Furthermore, it may aid 
in the development of targeted therapies for diabetes-related neurological 
complications. This literature review examines the emerging insights into the 
relationship between hyperglycemia and BBB dysfunction. It focuses on the 
mechanisms underlying BBB dysfunction, the clinical manifestations of this 
dysfunction in diabetes and cerebrovascular diseases, and potential therapeutic 
interventions.

The introduction of anti-amyloid antibodies has ushered in a new era in the 
treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), coinciding with the revision of its 
diagnostic criteria, which now focus on the biological definition of AD, with 
amyloid beta at its core. However, despite being fully aligned with these 
criteria-and therefore with how we define the disease-amyloid-targeting 
therapies have not yielded the expected results. How can a treatment targeting 
the very core of the disease be ineffective? Perhaps because AD, as we have 
defined it, is not actually the disease that afflicts millions of patients 
worldwide. Patients with conditions related to AD, such as apolipoprotein ε4 
allele (APOE4) homozygotes, patients receiving anticoagulant therapy for atrial 
fibrillation, and those with microhemorrhages, are excluded from treatment. 
Several other pathogenetic mechanisms continue to arise, including 
neuroinflammation, cerebrovascular disease, and metal ion dysregulation. At the 
same time, Alzheimer's pathology frequently coexists with other brain 
pathologies in AD patients, the roles and interactions of which remain largely 
unknown. Thus, AD should be redefined as a multifactorial neurodegenerative 
disorder, in which various processes contribute to amyloid accumulation or 
independently drive neurodegeneration.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) causes a progressive decline in memory, along with 
impairments in other cognitive abilities. The main pharmacological target for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment is acetylcholinesterase (AChE), a biochemical 
enzyme belonging to the cholinesterase (ChE) family. In the search for novel hit 
compoundswith potential as future Alzheimer's therapies, a series of carbamates 
derivatives were designed and evaluated using computational approaches including 
QSAR modeling, molecular docking, ADMET profiling, and molecular dynamics 
simulations. The following study focused on the development of a QSAR model with 
satisfactory statistical properties. ADMET analysis on the designed ligands, 
demonstrated good pharmacokinetic properties. Molecular docking identified M6 as 
a promising AChE binder with a docking score of -11.200 kcal/mol, while the 
Donepezil control returned a docking score of -10.800 kcal/mol. The validity of 
the docked complex was confirmed using molecular dynamics simulations, where the 
trajectory plots of M6 were found to be stable and consistent over 100 ns 
intervals. The enclosed study highlights M6 as a novel chemical starting point 
(CSP) (i.e., hit compound) targeting AChE as a potential therapeutic strategy 
against AD.

With recent advances in the potential usage of visual gamma stimulation at 40 Hz 
for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, there is motivation to evaluate 
adjacent frequencies to ensure that specifically 40 Hz is optimal. As visual 
stimulation with luminance flicker may affect adherence in clinical trials due 
to its inherent perceived flickering, invisible spectral flicker (ISF) was 
proposed as a more comfortable alternative for entraining 40 Hz. Based on 
current understanding of the potential mechanism of action for 40 Hz 
stimulation, the exact frequency is debatable. This study investigates the 
ability of ISF to evoke acute gamma responses at several frequencies in the 
range of 36-44 Hz. Twenty healthy volunteers were included in an 
electroencephalography (EEG) experiment with ISF stimulation at nine different 
frequencies (36-44 Hz, 1 Hz interval). Estimated signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) 
showed that the cortical power was significantly increased at all stimulation 
frequencies compared to baseline, but with no significant difference in SNR 
between stimulation frequencies. There was a significant subject effect, 
suggesting that there is higher variability between subjects than between 
frequencies alone. Our results indicate that ISF can evoke steady-state 
potentials at several frequencies in the low gamma range of 36-44 Hz. Across the 
population of participants, no preference or trend for any specific gamma 
stimulation frequency in the tested range was found. While the subject-stimulus 
interaction was significant, it described little variance and showed no specific 
patterns for individual preference of frequency.

BACKGROUND: Algorithms estimating real-world digital mobility outcomes (DMOs) 
are increasingly validated in healthy adults and various disease cohorts. 
However, their accuracy and reliability in older adults after hip fracture, who 
often walk slowly for short durations, is underexplored.
OBJECTIVE: This study examined DMO accuracy and reliability in a hip fracture 
cohort considering walking bout (WB) duration, physical function, days since 
surgery, and walking aid use.
METHODS: In total, 19 community-dwelling participants were real-world monitored 
for 2.5 hours using a lower back wearable device and a reference system 
combining inertial modules, distance sensors, and pressure insoles. A total of 6 
DMO estimates from 164 WBs from 58% (11/19) of the participants (aged 71-90 
years; assessed 32-390 days after surgery; Short Physical Performance Battery 
[SPPB] scores of 3-12; gait speed range 0.39-1.34 m/s) were assessed against the 
reference system at the WB and participant level. We stratified by WB duration 
(all WBs, WBs of >10 seconds, WBs of 10-30 seconds, and WBs of >30 seconds) and 
lower versus higher SPPB scores and observed whether days since surgery and 
walking aid use affected DMO accuracy and reliability.
RESULTS: Across WBs, walking speed and distance ranged from 0.25 to 1.29 m/s and 
from 1.7 to 436.5 m, respectively. Estimation of walking speed, cadence, stride 
duration, number of steps, and distance stratified by WB duration showed 
intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) ranging from 0.50 to 0.99 and mean 
relative errors (MREs) from -6.9% to 12.8%. Stride length estimation showed poor 
reliability, with ICCs ranging from 0.30 to 0.49 and MREs from 6.1% to 13.2%. 
Walking speed and distance ICCs in the higher-SPPB score group ranged from 0.85 
to 0.99, and MREs ranged from -10.1% to -1.7%. In the lower-SPPB score group, 
walking speed and distance ICCs ranged from 0.17 to 0.99, and MREs ranged from 
13.5% to 32.6%. There was no discernible effect of time since surgery or walking 
aid use.
CONCLUSIONS: In total, 5 accurate and reliable real-world DMOs were identified 
in older adults after hip fracture: walking speed, cadence, stride duration, 
number of steps, and distance. Accuracy and reliability of most DMOs improved 
when excluding WBs of <10 seconds and were higher for WBs of >30 seconds than 
for WBs of 10 to 30 seconds and for participants with higher physical function. 
DMOs capture daily gait as early as 1 month after surgery also in people using 
walking aids. However, as most WBs in this cohort were short, there was a 
trade-off between improving accuracy and reliability by excluding short WBs and 
losing a substantial amount of data. These results have important implications 
for establishing the clinical validity of DMOs and evaluating the effects of 
interventions on daily-life gait, thereby facilitating the design of optimal 
care pathways.

Hippocampal interneurons (INs) play a fundamental role in regulating neural 
oscillations, modulating excitatory circuits, and shaping spatial 
representation. While historically overshadowed by excitatory pyramidal cells in 
spatial coding research, recent advances have demonstrated that inhibitory INs 
not only coordinate network dynamics but also contribute directly to spatial 
information processing. This review aims to provide a novel integrative 
perspective on how distinct IN subtypes participate in spatial coding and how 
their dysfunction contributes to cognitive deficits in neurological disorders 
such as epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease (AD), traumatic brain injury (TBI), and 
cerebral hypoxia-ischemia. We synthesize recent findings demonstrating that 
different IN classes-including parvalbumin (PV)-, somatostatin (SST)-, 
cholecystokinin (CCK)-, and calretinin (CR)-expressing neurons-exhibit spatially 
selective activity, challenging traditional views of spatial representation, and 
influence memory consolidation through network-level interactions. By leveraging 
cutting-edge techniques such as in vivo calcium imaging and optogenetics, new 
evidence suggests that INs encode spatial information with a level of 
specificity previously attributed only to pyramidal cells. Furthermore, we 
investigate the impact of inhibitory circuit dysfunction in neurological 
disorders, examining how disruptions in interneuronal activity lead to impaired 
theta-gamma coupling, altered sharp wave ripples, and destabilized place cell 
representations, ultimately resulting in spatial memory deficits. This review 
advances the field by shifting the focus from pyramidal-centered models to a 
more nuanced understanding of the hippocampal network, emphasizing the active 
role of INs in spatial coding. By highlighting the translational potential of 
targeting inhibitory circuits for therapeutic interventions, we propose novel 
strategies for restoring hippocampal network function in neurological 
conditions. Readers will gain a comprehensive understanding of the emerging role 
of INs in spatial representation and the critical implications of their 
dysfunction, paving the way for future research on interneuron-targeted 
treatments for cognitive disorders.

OBJECTIVES: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, 
characterized by progressive cognitive decline. Current approved drugs merely 
relieve symptoms rather than halt or reverse disease progression. The role of 
the brain lymphatic system in clearing harmful substances in the brain has 
provided new insights for AD treatment. The goal of this study was to assess the 
efficacy and safety of deep cervical lymphovenous anastomosis (LVA) in treating 
AD patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A single-center, prospective, single-arm exploratory 
study was conducted on 26 AD patients who met the clinical and biomarker 
diagnostic criteria of the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association 
(NIA-AA). Deep cervical LVA was performed with modified technique from lymphatic 
vessel-vein to lymphatic flap-vein anastomosis. Preoperative and follow-up 
neuropsychological tests were carried out using Mini-Mental Status Examination 
(MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Neuropsychiatric Inventory 
(NPI) scores. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers (Aβ42, Aβ40, p-Tau, T-Tau) 
were collected and analyzed via single-molecule immunoassay in the early 
postoperative period.
RESULTS: One month after surgery, about 60% of caregivers reported varying 
degrees of overall symptom improvement in patients. MMSE scores of patients 
significantly increased after surgery compared with before surgery (3 [0, 6] vs. 
5 [0, 7], P = 0.022). Although, 15% of patients had increased MoCA scores, 42% 
had decreased NPI scores, both changes did not reach statistical difference. 
Quantitative analysis revealed a trend toward reduced AD biomarker levels 
following LVA, but the differences did not reach statistical significant. Only 
two patients experienced postoperative difficulty raising their arms, with 
gradual recovery during follow-up.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that deep cervical LVA is safe and feasible 
procedure, showing a significant cognitive improvement in AD patients (mainly in 
MMSE), which needs long-term follow-up and large-scale clinical trials to 
verify.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and neurodegenerative disease, 
predominantly causing dementia. Despite increasing clinical evidence suggesting 
the involvement of peripheral immune cells such as monocytes in AD pathology, 
the dynamic penetration and infiltration of monocytes crossing blood-brain 
barrier (BBB) and inducing neuroinflammation is largely understudied in an AD 
brain. Herein, we engineer BBB-like microphysiological system (BBB-MPS) models 
for recapitulating the dynamic penetration and infiltration of monocytes in an 
AD patient's brain. Each BBB-MPS model can be engineered by integrating a 
functional BBB-like structure on a human cortical organoid using a 3D-printed 
device within a well of a plate. By coculturing these BBB-MPS models with 
monocytes from AD patients and age-matched healthy donors, we found that AD 
monocytes exhibit significantly greater BBB penetration and brain infiltration 
compared to age-matched control monocytes. Moreover, we also tested the 
interventions including Minocycline and Bindarit, and found they can effectively 
inhibit AD monocyte infiltration, subsequently reducing neuroinflammation and 
neuronal apoptosis. We believe these scalable and user-friendly BBB-MPS models 
may hold promising potential in modeling and advancing therapeutics for 
neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases.

BACKGROUND: Social media listening is a new approach for gathering insights from 
social media platforms about users' experiences. This approach has not been 
applied to analyse discussions about Alzheimer's disease (AD) in China.
AIMS: We aimed to leverage multisource Chinese data to gain deeper insights into 
the current state of the daily management of Chinese patients with AD and the 
burdens faced by their caregivers.
METHODS: We searched nine mainstream public online platforms in China from 
September 2010 to March 2024. Natural language processing tools were used to 
identify patients and caregivers, and categorise patients by disease stage for 
further analysis. We analysed the current state of patient daily management, 
including diagnosis and treatment, choice of treatment scenarios, patient safety 
and caregiver concerns.
RESULTS: A total of 1211 patients with AD (66% female, 82% aged 60-90) and 756 
caregivers for patients with AD were identified from 107 556 online sources. 
Most patients were derived from online consultation platforms (43%), followed by 
bulletin board system platforms (24%). Among the patients categorised into 
specific disease stages (n=382), 42% were in the moderate stage. The most 
frequent diagnostic tools included medical history (97%) and symptoms (84%). 
Treatment options for patients with AD primarily included cholinesterase 
inhibitors, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists and antipsychotics. Both 
quantitative and qualitative analysis of patients who experienced wandering 
(n=92) indicated a higher incidence of wandering during the moderate stage of 
the disease. Most caregivers were family members, with their primary concerns 
focusing on disease management and treatment (90%), followed by daily life care 
(37%) and psychosocial support (25%).
CONCLUSIONS: Online platform data provide a broad spectrum of real-world 
insights into individuals affected by AD in China. This study enhances our 
understanding of the experiences of patients with AD and their caregivers, 
providing guidance for developing personalised interventions, providing advice 
for caregivers and improving care for patients with AD.

INTRODUCTION: The phase 3, open-label TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 4 study compared the 
effect of donanemab versus aducanumab on amyloid plaque (AP) clearance in 
participants with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease.
METHODS: Participants (n = 148) were randomized 1:1 to receive intravenous 
donanemab (700 mg every 4 weeks for three doses, then 1400 mg every 4 weeks 
thereafter) or aducanumab (per label). AP was measured with florbetapir F 18 
positron emission tomography. AP clearance was defined as < 24.1 Centiloids.
RESULTS: At 6, 12, and 18 months, AP clearance was achieved in 37.9%, 70.0%, and 
76.8%, respectively, of donanemab-treated participants versus 1.6%, 24.6%, and 
43.1% of aducanumab-treated participants (P < 0.001). Median time to clearance 
was 359 versus 568 days for donanemab- versus aducanumab-treated participants 
(P < 0.001). Amyloid-related imaging abnormality (ARIA)-edema/effusion occurred 
in 23.9% and 34.8% of donanemab- and aducanumab-treated participants, 
respectively.
DISCUSSION: Donanemab treatment resulted in earlier and greater AP clearance 
compared to aducanumab. ARIA frequencies were consistent with prior studies.
CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: No: NCT05108922, TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 4 HIGHLIGHTS: Here 
we report the first direct comparator study of two amyloid-targeting therapies. 
This was the first investigation of donanemab on biomarker efficacy regardless 
of tau levels. Donanemab demonstrated superiority over aducanumab in amyloid 
plaque (AP) clearance. The depth and speed of AP removal did not affect 
amyloid-related imaging abnormality risk or incidence.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are 
neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). This study examined astrocytic contributions 
to neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS), focusing on astrocytic protein activity and 
its relationship with NPS severity, accounting for clinical and pathological 
features of NDs.
METHODS: Cerebrospinal astrocytic proteins (glial fibrillary acidic protein 
[GFAP], chitinase-3-like protein 1 [YKL-40], and aquaporin-4 [AQP4]) from 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (AD) and Parkinson's 
Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) (PD) were analyzed using K-means 
clustering. Six NPS domains, ND-specific pathologies (amyloid-beta/Aβ for AD, 
alpha-synuclein/αSyn for PD), and nonspecific pathology (phosphorylated 
tau/ptau) were assessed.
RESULTS: In both samples, three astrocytic clusters were identified, and the 
"highYKL|lowOthers" cluster (high YKL-40, low GFAP/AQP4) consistently showed 
lower ptau and NPS severity compared to the "highAll" cluster (high GFAP, 
YKL-40, AQP4). In PPMI, the "highYKL|lowOthers" cluster also attenuated the 
relationship between αSyn and NPS compared to the "highAll" cluster.
DISCUSSION: Astrocytic activity relates to NPS, highlighting astrocytic proteins 
as potential therapeutic targets for NPS in NDs.
HIGHLIGHTS: Astrocytic protein clusters were linked to NPS severity in AD and PD 
cohorts. The "highYKL|lowOthers" cluster showed lower ptau and NPS severity than 
"allhigh" cluster in AD and PD cohorts. Astrocytic proteins may serve as 
therapeutic targets for managing NPS in NDs.

There is increasing interest in nose-to-brain delivery as an innovative drug 
delivery strategy for neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's or 
Alzheimer's disease. The unique anatomy of the nose-brain interface facilitates 
direct drug transport via the olfactory and trigeminal pathways to the brain, 
bypassing the blood-brain barrier. Different administration techniques as well 
as advanced drug formulations like targeted nanoparticles and thermoresponsive 
systems have been explored to improve the delivery efficiency and the 
therapeutic efficacy. This review provides an up-to-date perspective on this 
fast-developing field, and discusses different studies on safety and 
pharmacokinetic properties. A thorough evaluation of preclinical and clinical 
studies reveals both promises and challenges of this delivery method, 
highlighting approved drugs for the treatment of epilepsy and migraine that 
successfully utilize intranasal routes. The current landscape of research on 
nose-to-brain delivery is critically discussed, and a rationale is provided for 
ongoing research to optimize therapeutic strategies.

BACKGROUND: The neurochemical alterations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
associated with the typical symptomatology in idiopathic normal pressure 
hydrocephalus (iNPH) and their association with outcome after shunt surgery are 
unsettled.
AIM: To explore associations between concentrations of CSF biomarkers reflecting 
amyloid- and tau pathology, neuronal degeneration as well as astrocytic 
activation and the characteristic symptomatology in iNPH and to examine whether 
these biomarkers can predict the postoperative outcome in all patients and in 
patients without evidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology.
METHODS: This explorative study included 81 patients diagnosed with iNPH at the 
Hydrocephalus research unit, Sahlgrenska. Symptoms were assessed using the 
iNPH-scale and standardized clinical tests measuring gait, balance, cognition 
and urinary incontinence before and median 8 months after shunt surgery. 
Pre-operative lumbar CSF concentrations of Aβ38, Aβ40, Aβ42, ratio Aβ42/Aβ40, 
sAPPα, sAPPβ, T-tau, P-tau, MCP-1, and NFL were analyzed. A low Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio 
defined patients with AD pathology. Correlation and regression analyses between 
biomarker concentrations and clinical symptoms at baseline as well as 
postoperative change in symptoms after surgery, were performed.
RESULTS: Higher NFL correlated with more pronounced impairment in all clinical 
tests, i.e. included measures of gait, balance, cognition and urinary 
incontinence (rp=0.25-0.46, p < 0.05). Higher T-tau and P-tau correlated with 
poorer performance in cognitive tests (rp=0.26-0.39, p < 0.05). No biomarker 
could differentiate between improved and unimproved patients in the whole sample 
or in AD-pathology negative patients. Low ratio Aβ42/Aβ40 lacked predictive 
value. A higher preoperative P-tau was weakly correlated with less pronounced 
overall clinical improvement (rp = -0.238, p = 0.036).
CONCLUSIONS: Axonal degeneration, as indicated by elevated NFL, is probably 
involved in the generation of the full iNPH tetrade of symptoms and tau 
pathology more specifically with iNPH cognitive impairment. No CSF biomarker 
could identify shunt responders. CSF evidence of Alzheimer pathology should not 
be used to exclude patients from shunt surgery.

Memory loss, and behavioral impairments. Hallmark pathological features include 
amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques, tau neurofibrillary tangles, chronic inflammation, 
and impaired neuronal signaling. Physical exercise is increasingly recognized as 
a non-pharmacological intervention to attenuate Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk 
and progression by enhancing neuroplasticity, improving mitochondrial function, 
and modulating immune responses. The let-7 family of microRNAs is critically 
involved in AD pathology. Elevated levels of let-7b and let-7e have been 
reported in the cerebrospinal fluid of AD patients, with let-7b levels 
correlating positively with total tau and phosphorylated tau concentrations. 
Overexpression of let-7a enhances Aβ-induced neurotoxicity, increases neuronal 
apoptosis by up to 45%, and alters autophagy-related signaling via the 
PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, as shown by 1.8-fold increases in LC3-II/I ratios and 
2.2-fold upregulation of Beclin-1 expression. Exercise modulates let-7 
expression in a tissue-specific and context-dependent manner. Aerobic training 
reduces skeletal muscle expression of let-7b-5p by 30-35%, while increasing its 
suppressor Lin28a by 40%, thereby improving mitochondrial respiration. Overall, 
modulation of let-7 by exercise influences neuronal survival, autophagy, and 
inflammation, offering a potential mechanism through which physical activity 
exerts neuroprotective effects in AD. Quantitative characterization of let-7 
expression patterns may support its use as a diagnostic and therapeutic 
biomarker, though further research is needed to establish optimal modulation 
strategies.

Dementia spectrum disorders, characterized by progressive cognitive decline, 
pose a significant global health burden. Early screening and diagnosis are 
essential for timely and accurate treatment, improving patient outcomes and 
quality of life. This study investigated dynamic features of resting-state 
electroencephalography (EEG) functional connectivity to identify characteristic 
patterns of dementia subtypes, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 
frontotemporal dementia (FD), and to evaluate their potential as biomarkers. We 
extracted distinctive statistical features, including mean, variance, skewness, 
and Shannon entropy, from brain connectivity measures, revealing common 
alterations in dementia, specifically a generalized disruption of Alpha-band 
connectivity. Distinctive characteristics were found, including generalized 
Delta-band hyperconnectivity with increased complexity in AD and disrupted 
phase-based connectivity in Theta, Beta, and Gamma bands for FD. We also 
employed a convolutional neural network model, enhanced with these dynamic 
features, to differentiate between dementia subtypes. Our classification models 
achieved a multiclass classification accuracy of 93.6% across AD, FD, and 
healthy control groups. Furthermore, the model demonstrated 97.8% and 96.7% 
accuracy in differentiating AD and FD from healthy controls, respectively, and 
97.4% accuracy in classifying AD and FD in pairwise classification. These 
establish a high-performance deep learning framework utilizing dynamic EEG 
connectivity patterns as potential biomarkers, offering a promising approach for 
early screening and diagnosis of dementia spectrum disorders using EEG. Our 
findings suggest that analyzing brain connectivity dynamics as a network and 
during cognitive tasks could offer more valuable information for diagnosis, 
assessing disease severity, and potentially identifying personalized 
neurological deficits.

BACKGROUND: Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) are routinely prescribed 
for mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). National guidance advises GPs to 
initiate memantine for patients already taking an AChEI, as it offers small 
benefits for moderate-to-severe AD, with good tolerability. But this is not 
routinely done, potentially depriving patients of a beneficial treatment.
AIM: To assess prescribing for AD in general practice, to explore factors 
influencing prescribing, and to identify additional education needs.
DESIGN & SETTING: Mixed-methods study involving GPs in England.
METHOD: An online survey and semi-structured interviews were conducted. Survey 
responses were analysed in StataNow (version 18.5). Interview transcriptions 
were coded in NVivo (version 14) by two researchers, who agreed themes. 
Quantitative and qualitative analyses were integrated and mapped to the 
Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) and behaviour change wheel (BCW).
RESULTS: Survey responders (n = 104) mostly continued rather than initiated 
memantine. Less than half were confident in identifying AD stages and developing 
care plans for moderate-to-severe AD. Overall, 46% of responders were unaware of 
current national guidance concerning memantine. Interviews (n = 23) mostly 
concurred with survey findings. Direction from local formularies conflicts with 
current national guidance. Mapping to TDF and BCW identified barriers to, 
facilitators, and interventions for changing practice.
CONCLUSION: Limited time, patchy support, and Quality and Outcomes Framework 
downgrading contribute to a perception that dementia is not prioritised in 
general practice. Local systems for diagnosis and treatment reinforce GPs' 
feelings of inadequacy. GPs assess the impact of AD on patients and families but 
may not map assessments to a disease stage for memantine initiation. 
Interventions to change practice should boost knowledge and confidence; local 
pathways should clearly reflect national guidance.

Over the recent years, numerous research efforts have been focused toward 
xanthones, a class of heterocyclic compounds characterized by a three-ring core 
structure and a diverse range of biological activities. Despite extensive 
studies, no xanthone-based molecule has successfully progressed through clinical 
trials to reach pharmaceutical applications. Xanthones belong to the class of 
secondary metabolites that exist naturally, found in various plant species, and 
their structural diversity has been further expanded through synthetic 
modifications to enhance their pharmacological efficacy. This review provides a 
comprehensive description of the therapeutic potential of xanthone derivatives 
within the scope of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, 
Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 
multiple sclerosis, and neuroinflammation. Existing literature has been 
rigorously examined to highlight the pharmacological relevance of xanthones in 
these disorders. Additionally, the pathophysiological aspects of each disease 
are discussed in detail to establish a mechanistic understanding of how xanthone 
derivatives may exert neuroprotective effects. Furthermore, the SAR of xanthones 
is explored to elucidate key molecular features responsible for their 
bioactivity, providing insights into rational drug design. By synthesizing and 
critically analyzing the existing research, this review is focused in 
highlighting the therapeutic relevance of xanthones in neurodegenerative 
diseases and their potential as lead candidates for further drug development.

Advanced analysis of MRI and PET images provides quantitative and accurate 
information about the brain structure and function, allowing differential 
diagnosis, prognosis, and personalized treatment. Most clinical software lack 
accurate quantification. Here we developed a user-friendly multimodal neuroimage 
analysis toolbox, named Odense-Oxford PET Image Analysis (OPETIA), based on 
Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain Software Library (FSL) and 
Python programming language. FSL is a strong toolbox library for MRI analysis 
but has not been widely used for PET image analysis. OPETIA includes a graphical 
user interface that facilitates automatic multimodal neuroimage analysis. OPETIA 
can automatically pre-process magnetic resonance, and PET images and calculates 
maximum, mean, and standard deviation of Standardized Uptake Value (SUV) and 
Standardized Uptake Value Ratio (SUVR) in the volumes of interest (VOI). To 
assess the efficacy of OPETIA, we analysed a set of static 
18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET and MRIs of healthy subjects and patients with 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) dataset using OPETIA and compared the SUVR measurements with those 
obtained from Statistical Parametric Mapping, version 12 (SPM12). The result of 
this comparison showed a close association between OPETIA and SPM12 results 
(p-value 〈 0.01, r 〉 0.8). OPETIA measurements were significantly (p-value < 
0.01) larger than those of SPM12 in all brain regions (according to the 
Harvard-Oxford brain atlas), indicating a systematic difference between these 
tools. The Cronbach's Alpha values for both tools were > 0.9, indicating a high 
reproducibility. We compared the group difference (control vs Alzheimer's 
disease) obtained from each toolbox using two-sample t-test and found 
significantly (p-value < 0.01) larger Cohen's d values for SUVRs from OPETIA (d 
= 0.22) than SPM12 (d = 0.04). We suggest that OPETIA is a user-friendly and 
robust tool for quantitative analysis of multimodal neuroimaging such as 
cerebral PET and MR images.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder 
associated with aberrant neuronal activity. In AD, NF-κB, a key transcription 
factor and inflammatory mediator, becomes hyperactive, influencing gene 
expression, and likely neuronal excitability. This study investigates whether 
inhibiting intracortical injection of amyloid-β peptides (Aβ)-induced 
hyperactive NF-κB can restore spatial memory impairment and abnormal neuronal 
activity in rats. We observed that intracortical injection of Aβ increases 
immunoreactivity of phosphorylated-p65 in CA1 pyramidal neurons. We demonstrated 
that in vivo treatment of rats with JSH-23 restores anxiety-like behaviors as 
well as spatial learning and memory, as assessed by elevated plus maze and 
Morris water maze, respectively. In addition, using patch-clamp recording we 
showed that the intrinsic excitability of CA1 pyramidal neurons, particularly in 
terms of the evoked spikes, is reduced in Aβ-injected rats along with altered 
resting membrane properties. Incubating acute brain slices from control rats in 
aCSF containing JSH-23 did not influence the neuronal activity. In contrast, 
this incubation restored almost all of the passive- and activity-dependent 
properties of CA1 pyramidal neurons in brain slices from Aβ-injected rats. 
Furthermore, we found that Aβ-induced enhancement of Ih currents and 
after-hyperpolarization amplitude (AHP) are reduced by JSH-23 incubation, 
possibly underlying rescuing effects of NF-κB inhibition at behavioral and 
cognitive level. Collectively, our results suggest that hyperactive NF-κB 
signaling in AD is associated with abnormal neuronal activity and deficits in 
cognitive functions. Moreover, pharmacologic inhibition of this signaling 
molecule restores neuronal excitability, as well as rescues spatial memory, 
likely through influencing Ih currents and AHP.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Bu-Wang San (BWS) is a prominent traditional 
Chinese medicine known for calming the mind and promoting intelligence. It has 
been reported to improve learning and memory, enhance memory ability, and 
promote synaptic plasticity. However, the complexity of the material basis and 
the diversity of therapeutic targets of BWS on Alzheimer's disease (AD) have not 
been elucidated.
AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic material basis 
and the mechanism of BWS in AD treatment by comprehensively analyzing multiple 
GEO datasets of the human hippocampus, network pharmacology, and multi-platform 
metabolomics validation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three GEO datasets of the human hippocampus were utilized 
to identify AD-associated targets using weighted gene co-expression network 
analysis (WGCNA) and differential analysis. Network pharmacology analyses were 
performed to investigate BWS's therapeutic material basis and predict the 
therapeutic targets of BWS on AD. A rat model was induced through the concurrent 
administration of AlCl3 and D-galactose to validate BWS's therapeutic potential 
and underlying mechanisms in AD. To validate the results of GEO data mining and 
network pharmacology, a comprehensive metabolomics approach integrating gas 
chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and ultra-performance liquid 
chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF/MS) was 
conducted on rat serum samples to uncover potential metabolic alterations and 
their associated pathways.
RESULTS: A total of 6367 genes were selected as AD drug targets through WGCNA 
analysis and enrichment analysis of disease-associated gene expression profiles 
in the GEO database. Network pharmacology was performed in this study for the 
identification of potential interactions between the components of BWS and its 
targets, TP53, STAT3, EGFR, MAOA, NOS3, PPARG, PRKCA, MAPK8, AChE, ARG1, among 
others, which were among the top 25 highest probable targets of BWS acting on 
AD. The multi-platform metabolomics indicated that amino sugar and nucleotide 
sugar metabolism, glycine, serine and threonine metabolism pathways, and other 
pathways may be associated with the AD model based on AlCl3 and D-galactose. The 
comparison of differential metabolites between the AD model group and the BWS 
intervention group revealed that 66 of the 97 differential metabolites exhibited 
a pullback trend, indicating a potential therapeutic effect of BWS on these 
metabolites.
CONCLUSION: This study builds a systematic strategy combining GEO datasets, 
network pharmacology, and multi-platform metabolomics and provides valuable 
insights into the pharmacological mechanism of BWS on AD. The results suggest 
that BWS may exert its therapeutic effects on AD by modulating the amino sugar 
and nucleotide sugar metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, glycine, serine 
and threonine metabolism pathway and acting on the drug targets of ARG1, MAOA, 
AChE, XDH, GAD2 et al. This strategy provides a deep understanding of the 
molecular mechanisms of herbal medicine in treating AD at a systematic level.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Disruption of receptor-mediated mitophagy 
contributes to neuronal damage in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Chuanxiong-Danggui 
herb pair (CDHP) is classic herbal pair applied to treating neurodegenerative 
diseases including AD, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Parkinson's disease. 
Though studies have demonstrated the neuroprotective effects of CDHP, the 
underlying mechanisms by which CDHP attenuates neuronal impairment of AD remains 
to be elucidated.
AIM OF THE STUDY: The objective of this work was to investigate the anti-AD 
mechanism of CDHP in APP/PS1 mice.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Behavioral assessments were conducted on C57BL/6J and 
APP/PS1 mice following CDHP treatment, alongside an evaluation of neuronal 
morphology in the hippocampal region. In vitro, HT-22 cells were induced by 
Aβ25-35 before being treated with CDHP. The mechanisms of CDHP were investigated 
using transmission electron microscopy, Golgi staining, immunofluorescence, and 
Western blot analysis.
RESULTS: Results from the passive avoidance test and the Morris water maze (MWM) 
indicated that CDHP significantly mitigated cognitive deficits of APP/PS1 mice, 
accompanied by a reduction of pathological damage in the CA1 and CA3 regions of 
hippocampus. Further testing found that a significant reduction in dendritic 
spines density was rescued by CDHP. Synaptophysin (SYN) and postsynaptic density 
protein 95 (PSD-95) were elevated in the CDHP group, while β-amyloid (Aβ) 
plaques deposition was significantly reduced. Simultaneously, CDHP markedly 
inhibited neuronal apoptosis through a decrease of the levels of Cleaved 
Caspase-12 and enhanced expression of Bcl-2/Bax, both in vivo and in vitro. 
Additionally, CDHP improved mitochondrial morphology and function in the AD 
model by decreasing abnormal mitochondria and increasing the expression of 
COXIV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that clear 
mitophagy-autophagosomes were nearly absent in APP/PS1 mice, while the 
expression of p62 and LC3B were elevated following CDHP treatment. Furthermore, 
CDHP increased the expression of the FUNDC1 and PGAM5 in APP/PS1 mice and 
AD-like cell models.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that CDHP mitigated cognitive dysfunction in 
APP/PS1 mice by enhancing mitophagy to reduce neuronal injury.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder characterized by 
cognitive decline due to brain cell death, typically manifesting later in 
life.Early and accurate detection is critical for effective disease management 
and treatment. This study proposes an ensemble learning framework that combines 
five deep learning architectures (VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, InceptionV3, and 
EfficientNetB7) to improve the accuracy of AD diagnosis. We use a comprehensive 
dataset of 3,714 MRI brain scans collected from specialized clinics in Iraq, 
categorized into three classes: NonDemented (834 images), MildDemented (1,824 
images), and VeryDemented (1,056 images). The proposed voting ensemble model 
achieves a diagnostic accuracy of 99.32% on our dataset. The effectiveness of 
the model is further validated on two external datasets: OASIS (achieving 86.6% 
accuracy) and ADNI (achieving 99.5% accuracy), demonstrating competitive 
performance compared to existing approaches. Moreover, the proposed model 
exhibits high precision and recall across all stages of dementia, providing a 
reliable and robust tool for early AD detection. This study highlights the 
effectiveness of ensemble learning in AD diagnosis and shows promise for 
clinical applications.

Due to graphene's structural and electrical properties, electrical biosensors 
made of this 2D material have drawn tremendous attention in the field of 
biosensing, enabling label-free, amplification-free, highly sensitive, and 
selective detection of diverse biological targets. However, the detection of 
biomolecules with minimal size and charge remains challenging due to the Debye 
electrostatic screening effect. This study introduces a surface chemistry 
treatment that employs fullerene derivatives to enhance charge transfer to the 
graphene biosensor interface, overcoming this limitation. Specifically, 
(1,2-methanofullerene C60)-61-carboxylic acid (MFCA) is used as a linker 
molecule, replacing the traditional 1-pyrenebutanoic acid succinimidyl ester 
(PBASE). This modification facilitates the movement of electrons from 
biomarkers, such as microRNA (miRNA), across the Debye screening layer through a 
charge attraction effect. This approach achieves a detection limit (LoD) as low 
as 1 aM for hsa-mir-125b miRNA, a critical biomarker for Alzheimer's disease, 
and this is an improvement of 2-3 orders of magnitude over previous methods. The 
enhanced sensitivity is attributed to the efficient electron transfer from miRNA 
to the graphene surface, demonstrated by density functional theory (DFT) 
calculation and control experiment with the PBASE linker. Further, this method 
is also applied in the detection of another miR-34a with an ultralow LoD of 1 
aM, showing its generalizability. This work enables the application of charge 
polarization-enhanced electrical biosensors in the early-stage diagnosis of 
various diseases with ultrahigh sensitivity.

Phytocannabinoids are attracting growing attention because of their potential 
for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Among them, the "minor" 
cannabinoid, cannabinol (CBN), has emerged as a promising neuroprotective agent, 
acting independently of classical cannabinoid receptors through as-yet 
unidentified mitochondrial targets. To uncover the molecular basis of its 
neuroprotective effects, we designed and synthesized a chemical probe based on 
CBN, incorporating a minimalist diazirine linker. Functional assays confirmed 
that the probe retains CBN's mitochondrial activity and exhibits strong 
mitochondrial enrichment, as demonstrated by fluorescence microscopy and 
click-correlative light and electron microscopy (click-CLEM). By affinity-based 
protein profiling (AfBPP), we identified isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) as a 
key mitochondrial target of CBN. This finding was further substantiated by siRNA 
knockdown studies, which revealed that the absence of IDH2 partially phenocopies 
CBN's effects, validating its role as a critical mediator of CBN's 
neuroprotective activity.

Insulin receptors are present on cells throughout the body, including the brain. 
Dysregulation of insulin signaling in neurons and astrocytes has been implicated 
in altered mood, cognition, and the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). To 
define the role of insulin signaling in microglia, the primary phagocytes in the 
brain critical for maintenance and damage repair, we created mice with an 
inducible microglia-specific insulin receptor knockout (MG-IRKO). RiboTag 
profiling of microglial mRNAs revealed that loss of insulin signaling results in 
alterations of gene expression in pathways related to innate immunity and 
cellular metabolism. In vitro, loss of insulin signaling in microglia results in 
metabolic reprogramming with an increase in glycolysis and impaired uptake of 
Aβ. In vivo, MG-IRKO mice exhibit alterations in mood and social behavior, and 
when crossed with the 5xFAD mouse model of AD, the resultant mice exhibit 
increased levels of Aβ plaque and elevated neuroinflammation. Thus, insulin 
signaling in microglia plays a key role in microglial cellular metabolism and 
the ability of the cells to take up Aβ, such that reduced insulin signaling in 
microglia alters mood and social behavior and accelerates AD pathogenesis. 
Together, these data indicate key roles of insulin action in microglia and the 
potential of targeting insulin signaling in microglia in treatment of AD.

IMPORTANCE: While clinical disease stages remained largely unchanged in the 2024 
update of the Alzheimer disease (AD) criteria, tau-positron emission tomography 
(PET) was introduced as a core biomarker and its spatial extent was incorporated 
into the revised biological stages of the disease. It is important to consider 
both the clinical and the biological stages and understand their discrepancies.
OBJECTIVE: To compare individuals who have discrepant biological and clinical 
stages with those who have congruent stages in terms of copathologies, 
comorbidities, and demographics.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Participants were from the Swedish 
BioFINDER-2 (inclusion from 2017 through 2023) and the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (inclusion from 2015 through 2024). BioFINDER-2 
included a prospective population-based (cognitively normal [CN] older adults) 
and memory clinic-based cohort (participants with subjective cognitive 
impairment [SCD], mild cognitive impairment [MCI], and dementia). ADNI included 
a volunteer-based sample. All participants who were amyloid-β positive and had 
undergone tau-PET were included. In BioFINDER-2, 838 participants of a total of 
1979 were included, and of 927 with tau-PET in ADNI, 380 were included.
EXPOSURES: The clinical (CN to dementia) and biological (based on PET; initial 
[amyloid-β-positive only] to advanced [amyloid-β-positive, elevated, and 
widespread tau]) stages from the revised AD criteria.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cross-sectional measures of neurodegeneration 
(cortical thickness, TAR DNA-binding protein 43 [TDP-43] imaging signature, 
neurofilament light [NfL]), α-synuclein cerebrospinal fluid status, plasma glial 
fibrillary acidic protein, white matter lesions, infarcts, microbleeds, 
comorbidities, and demographics.
RESULTS: There were 838 BioFINDER-2 participants (mean age, 73.9 [SD, 7.3] 
years; 431 women [51%]; 407 men [49%]) and 380 ADNI participants (average age, 
72.9 [SD, 7.0] years; 194 women [51%]; 186 mean [49%]) included. In BioFINDER-2, 
37.7% of the sample had congruent biological and clinical stages (reference 
group), 51.3% had more advanced clinical impairment compared with their clinical 
stage (clinical > biological) and 11.0% had the opposite (biological > 
clinical). The main differences were between the reference group and the 
clinical > biological group: the latter participants were more often positive 
for α-synuclein pathology, had higher NfL levels, greater TDP-43-like atrophy, 
and higher burden of cerebral small vessel disease lesions (all false discovery 
rate P < .05). The only difference between the biological > clinical and the 
reference group was that the former had less neurodegeneration (thicker cortex; 
all false discovery rate P < .001). The main results were replicated in the 
independent ADNI cohort, where congruent 56.1% of participants had biological 
and clinical stages; 36.1% were in the category clinical > biological, and 7.9% 
in biological > clinical.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Copathologies play an important role in symptom 
severity in individuals who harbor less tau-tangle pathology than expected for 
their clinical impairment. These results highlight the importance of measuring 
non-AD biomarkers in patients with AD with worse cognitive impairment than 
expected based on their biological stage, which could impact the clinical 
diagnosis and prognosis.

IMPORTANCE: Long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs), such as tiotropium, are 
inhaled anticholinergic bronchodilators. However, there is limited clinical 
evidence examining whether LAMAs may have clinically meaningful central 
anticholinergic effects, such as increased dementia risk.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between tiotropium initiation and 
dementia risk in older adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This population-based, active-comparator, 
new-user cohort study used linkable administrative databases from Ontario, 
Canada, with a target trial emulation framework. The cohort included new users 
of tiotropium monotherapy or a long-acting β2-agonist plus inhaled 
corticosteroid (LABA-ICS) who were 66 years or older with COPD and without 
dementia, from September 4, 2004, to February 29, 2012. The follow-up period was 
up to 10 years from treatment initiation. Analyses were conducted from May 13, 
2024, to March 6, 2025.
EXPOSURES: Tiotropium monotherapy initiators were compared with LABA-ICS 
initiators. The primary analysis used an intention-to-treat exposure definition.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incident dementia was determined using a validated 
algorithm. A 1-year lag time was implemented to mitigate reverse causality and 
to account for disease latency. Cause-specific hazard ratios (HRs) with death as 
a competing risk were obtained from Cox models with propensity score fine 
stratification weights. Weighted incidence rate differences (IRDs) per 1000 
person-years were calculated.
RESULTS: Among 30 960 tiotropium monotherapy initiators and 19 530 LABA-ICS 
initiators, the mean (SD) age was 75.1 (6.7) years and 46.7% were female. Over a 
median (IQR) follow-up period of 7.59 (3.91-10.0) years from treatment 
initiation, tiotropium monotherapy vs LABA-ICS initiation was associated with a 
small increase in dementia risk per 1000 person-years (incidence rates, 29.6 
[95% CI, 28.8-30.4] vs 27.4 [95% CI, 26.4-28.3]; IRD, 2.3 [95% CI, 1.0-3.5]; HR, 
1.09 [95% CI, 1.04-1.14]). The secondary as-treated analysis showed no 
significant association per 1000 person-years (incidence rates, 24.1 [95% CI, 
22.2-26.0] vs 21.4 [95% CI, 18.5-24.3]; IRD, 2.7 [95% CI, -0.8 to 6.1]; HR, 1.11 
[95% CI, 0.93-1.32]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, among older adults with COPD, 
the small absolute rate increase in incident dementia associated with tiotropium 
monotherapy vs LABA-ICS was of questionable clinical importance, particularly 
when weighed against the established clinical benefits of tiotropium.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder characterized 
by progressive memory loss, posing a significant risk, particularly within aging 
populations. Effective treatments to prevent or cure AD have remained elusive 
with current treatments only able to slow disease progression. Moreover, 
challenges in drug development for AD therapies are a complex pathology. A 
multi-target agent gained considerable interest over the single therapy in 
complex diseases, providing possible insights into therapeutic development by 
simultaneously targeting multiple pathological mechanisms. Virtual screening 
(VS) is a potent computational tool for identifying potential drug candidates 
from vast chemical databases, with subsequent molecular docking providing 
detailed insights into ligand-protein interactions. The ZINC database, housing 
millions of chemical compounds, serves as a valuable resource for screenings. 
Here, we conducted VS of compounds sourced from the ZINC database to identify 
potential multi-target AD agents. Through the VS analysis and subsequent 
in-vitro evaluations, our investigation identified one compound, ZINC006067856 
(VS3), as a highly promising hit. This compound exhibited multifaceted actions 
against key AD pathological features, including cholinesterase inhibition, 
modulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) aggregation, and promotion of Aβ 
destabilization. Additionally, VS3 demonstrated neuroprotective effects against 
hydrogen peroxide-induced cell damage, further highlighting its potential as a 
comprehensive multi-targeted therapeutic agent for AD. Therefore, our findings 
suggested that VS3 held promise as a candidate for further preclinical and 
clinical investigations in the treatment of AD. Further elucidation of its 
mechanisms of action and comprehensive preclinical evaluations are required to 
assess its safety, efficacy, and therapeutic potential in improving AD clinical 
outcomes.

Inhibiting the aggregation of amyloid β (Aβ) peptides is a promising strategy 
for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, there have been very 
limited reports of highly effective inhibitors of Aβ aggregation in the past few 
decades. Herein, two types of nanoparticles (NPs) with opposite chirality were 
prepared through one-step assembly of L-cysteine (L-Cys) or D-cysteine (D-Cys) 
and Cu2+ at room temperature. L-Cys-Cu NPs and D-Cys-Cu NPs were able to inhibit 
the aggregation of Aβ42. Compared to their enantiomer L-Cys-Cu NPs, D-Cys-Cu NPs 
showed a larger binding affinity to Aβ42, leading to stronger inhibition of Aβ42 
fibrillation. Moreover, D-Cys-Cu NPs were found to cause the disaggregation of 
Aβ42 fibrils. Due to their simple preparation, good biocompatibility and 
significant effects, these chiral Cys-Cu NPs have great potential in inhibiting 
protein aggregation.

Diabetes is associated with an increased risk of cognitive impairment. 
Autophagy-lysosomal dysfunction is a key feature of diabetes that contributes to 
dementia. Transcription factor EB (TFEB) is a master regulator of the 
autophagy-lysosomal function. Although the TFEB level and activity are known to 
be significantly decreased in transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease, 
the role of TFEB in diabetes-associated cognitive decline remains unknown. 
Tomatidine protects nerve cells through reduced inflammation, oxidative stress, 
and cell apoptosis, which also increases the TFEB expression. In the present 
study, we elucidated whether tomatidine activates TFEB and ameliorates 
diabetes-associated cognitive impairment. The results revealed that tomatidine 
ameliorated diabetes-induced cognitive impairment and tau protein 
hyperphosphorylation through TFEB activation. Furthermore, tomatidine activated 
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). When AMPK was inhibited, the improvement 
role of tomatidine disappeared. Taken together, tomatidine exerted a partial 
protective effect on diabetes-associated cognitive impairment by modulating the 
AMPK-TFEB signaling pathway.

INTRODUCTION: Characterizing transitions of cognitive state, including reversion 
from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to normal cognition (NC) and subsequent 
cognitive stability or deterioration for post-reversion, has so far remained 
limited.
METHODS: Using a retrospective cohort of subjects with an MCI diagnosis at study 
entry and at least two follow-up visits between 2005 and December 2022, we 
developed a functional multistate model framework to estimate longitudinal 
patterns of transition probabilities between different cognitive states.
RESULTS: The probability of reversion increased from 2% at baseline to a maximum 
of 8% by year 10 before gradual decline thereafter. For post-reversion, the 
probability of progression to MCI rose from 8% to 35.71% at Year 10 and 
subsequently stabilized.
DISCUSSION: The instantaneous risk of MCI progressing was similar to the risk of 
re-progression to MCI for post-reversion. Post-reversion subjects remained at an 
increased risk of cognitive deterioration.
HIGHLIGHTS: The instantaneous risk of MCI progressing to AD is similar to the 
risk of re-progression to MCI for post-reversion. The FMSM we developed 
effectively utilizes multiple longitudinal markers to reveal variable transition 
patterns between different cognitive states. Considering both spatiotemporal 
dimensions and sparse irregularities from longitudinal neuroimaging and 
neuropsychological scales, fMLFPCA and MVFPCA help to extract variation 
patterns, to capture detailed changes characterizing the multidimensional 
evolution patterns of MCI.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating form of dementia, with the number of 
affected individuals rising sharply. The main hallmarks of the disease include 
amyloid-beta plaque deposits and neurofibrillary tangles consisting of 
hyperphosphorylated tau protein, besides other pathological features that 
contribute to the disease's complexity. The causes of sporadic AD are 
multifactorial and mostly age-related and involve risk factors such as diabetes 
and cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disorders. Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) 
is another type of dementia characterized by a spectrum of behaviors, memory, 
and motor abnormalities and associated with abnormal depositions of protein 
aggregation, including tau protein. Currently approved medications are 
symptomatic, and no disease-modifying therapy is available to halt the disease 
progression. Therefore, the development of multi-targeted therapeutic approaches 
could hold promise for the treatment of AD and other neurodegenerative 
disorders, including tauopathies. In this article, we will discuss the 
pathophysiology of AD and FTD, the proposed hypotheses, and current therapeutic 
approaches, highlighting the development of novel drug candidates and the 
progress of clinical trials in this field of research.

INTRODUCTION: Understanding molecular, neuroanatomical, and neurophysiological 
changes in cognitive decline is crucial for comprehending Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) progression and facilitating objective staging and early screening.
METHODS: We enrolled 277 participants and employed a multimodal approach, 
integrating genomics, metagenomics, metabolomics, magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI), and electroencephalogram (EEG) to investigate the AD continuum, from 
subjective cognitive decline (SCD) through mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to 
advanced AD.
RESULTS: Key markers and mechanisms were identified for each stage: initial 
neurophysiological deficits in SCD with compensatory metabolomic responses, 
gut-brain axis dysregulation in MCI, and extensive metabolic disruption and 
multisystem breakdown in AD. Using random forest models, we identified specific 
feature combinations that achieved predictive areas under the curve (AUCs) of 
0.78 for SCD, 0.84 for MCI, and 0.98 for AD, highlighting EEG as a particularly 
effective early screening tool.
DISCUSSION: This study elucidates AD's pathophysiological progression and 
highlights the potential of machine learning-assisted multimodal strategies for 
early detection and staging.
HIGHLIGHTS: Early electroencephalogram (EEG) changes and compensatory 
metabolomic responses define subjective cognitive decline (SCD) stage. In mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI), gut-brain axis dysfunction alters microbial 
diversity and functional pathways. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), systemic 
breakdown disruption enables near-perfect machine learning (ML) detection. 
Random forest models yield predictive areas under the curve (AUCs) of 0.78 
(SCD), 0.84 (MCI), 0.98 (AD). EEG is a convenient, cost-efficient marker for 
early screening.

BACKGROUND: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved three 
disease-modifying treatments for mild cognitive impairment and early Alzheimer's 
disease: aducanumab, lecanemab, and donanemab, which showed little efficacy, 
serious side effects, and are costly. Repetitive transcranial magnetic 
stimulation (rTMS) may overcome these difficulties by its safe, cheap, and 
potentially disease-modifying properties that extend beyond Aβ removal.
AIMS: We aim to compare the efficacy on cognitive function, tolerability, and 
acceptability of rTMS with aducanumab, lecanemab, and donanemab in people with 
mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.
METHODS: We systematically reviewed relevant randomized placebo-controlled 
trials in PubMed, the CENTRAL, the CINHAL, and the ClinicalTrials.gov and 
performed a random-effect network meta-analysis.
RESULTS: Nineteen randomized placebo-controlled trials with 6918 participants 
were included. rTMS was significantly more effective than placebo/sham 
stimulation. In addition, rTMS was significantly more effective than aducanumab, 
lecanemab, and donanemab. Furthermore, rTMS was not significantly inferior to 
placebo/sham stimulation in tolerability and acceptability, whereas aducanumab, 
lecanemab, and donanemab were significantly inferior to placebo/sham stimulation 
in tolerability and acceptability. rTMS was significantly superior to lecanemab 
and donanemab in acceptability. No significant differences were observed in the 
remaining comparisons.
CONCLUSIONS: rTMS may be more effective, tolerable, and acceptable than 
aducanumab, lecanemab, and donanemab. Long-term direct comparison studies are 
needed.

INTRODUCTION: Aging is the primary risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease. 
Chronic low-grade inflammation associated with aging drives cognitive impairment 
through multiple mechanisms involving oxidative stress, insulin resistance, and 
dysregulation of metabolic, immunologic, and hematologic systems.
METHODS: In a 7-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial 
(NCT04669028), we investigated the safety and activity of bezisterim, a 
first-in-class, oral, blood-brain barrier-permeable, anti-inflammatory agent on 
cognitive, molecular, biochemical, physiological, and biological aging 
parameters in a subset of 50 mild-to-moderate probable Alzheimer's disease 
participants. These participants had source-document-verified clinical measures 
and samples, and they completed the protocol. This study focuses on epigenetic, 
metabolic, biomarker, and cognitive measures in the exploratory biomarker 
population that completed the protocol.
RESULTS: Bezisterim was associated with non-significant directional improvements 
in multiple measures of cognitive and functional performance compared to 
placebo, with correlations to biological age (determined by DNA methylation 
"clocks") and to metabolism, inflammation, and dementia biomarkers. In addition, 
clinical measures correlated with the extent of DNA methylation of certain 
cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites in genes associated with metabolic 
inflammation and neurodegeneration.
DISCUSSION: The results suggest the possible use of bezisterim to target the 
multifactorial processes underlying dementia.

Latin America's diverse genetic landscape provides a unique opportunity to study 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). The Multi-Partner 
Consortium to Expand Dementia Research in Latin America (ReDLat) recruited 2,162 
participants with AD, FTD, or as healthy controls from six countries: Argentina, 
Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru. Participants underwent genomic 
sequencing and population structure analyses were conducted using Principal 
Component Analysis and ADMIXTURE. The study revealed a predominant mix of 
American, African, and European ancestries, with an additional East Asian 
component in Brazil. Variant curation identified 17 pathogenic variants, 
pathogenic C9orf72 expansion, and 44 variants of uncertain significance. Seventy 
families showed autosomal dominant inheritance, with 48 affected by AD and 22 by 
FTD. This represents the first large-scale genetic study of AD and FTD in Latin 
America, highlighting the need to consider diverse ancestries, social 
determinants of health, and cultural factors when assessing genetic risk for 
neurodegenerative diseases.

Brain atrophy may precede symptoms in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but it remains 
unclear whether atrophy in this preclinical stage falls within a distinct brain 
network or is associated with transitional cognitive changes. We investigated 
cortical thickness in cognitively unimpaired older adults with varying amyloid-β 
accumulation and estimated the connectivity of each individual's atrophy pattern 
using a large normative connectome (n = 1000). A distinct network was connected 
to atrophy patterns in amyloid-β-positive (n = 1242) versus negative (n = 536) 
participants. This preclinical AD network was similar to a previously published 
atrophy network associated with AD dementia (r = 0.8284, p = 0.016). In 
leave-one-out cross-validation, atrophy patterns connected to the preclinical AD 
network were associated with lower cognitive performance (p = 0.0018), greater 
subjective cognitive decline (p < 0.001), and amyloid-β levels (p < 0.001). 
Atrophy in preclinical AD maps to a network similar to AD dementia that is 
associated with amyloid-β and cognition, demonstrating an atrophy-related 
network across the continuum of AD.

Sex-specific penetrance in autosomal dominant Mendelian conditions is largely 
understudied. The neurodevelopmental disorder Pilarowski-Bjornsson syndrome 
(PILBOS) was initially described in females. Here, we describe the clinical and 
genetic characteristics of the largest PILBOS cohort to date, showing that both 
sexes can exhibit PILBOS features, although males are overrepresented. A mouse 
model carrying a human-derived Chd1 missense variant (Chd1 R616Q/+) displays 
female-restricted phenotypes, including growth deficiency, anxiety and 
hypotonia. Orchiectomy unmasks a growth deficiency phenotype in male Chd1 
R616Q/+ mice, while testosterone rescues the phenotype in females, implicating 
androgens in phenotype modulation. In the gnomAD and UK Biobank databases, rare 
missense variants in CHD1 are overrepresented in males, supporting a male 
protective effect. We identify 33 additional highly constrained autosomal genes 
with missense variant overrepresentation in males. Our results support 
androgen-regulated sexual dimorphism in PILBOS and open novel avenues to 
understand the mechanistic basis of sexual dimorphism in other autosomal 
Mendelian disorders.

PURPOSE: No longitudinal imaging biomarkers have been validated to capture early 
glymphatic changes during disease-modifying therapy (DMT) for Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). This study investigated whether the diffusion tensor imaging along 
the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) index can detect early treatment-related 
changes in participants with AD who initiate amyloid-targeting DMT.
METHODS: Thirteen participants with AD (mean age, 72 years; 8 women) who 
initiated lecanemab therapy prospectively underwent DTI at baseline and three 
months. Projection and association fiber regions of interest, predefined in the 
HCP-1065 atlas, were inversely warped to the native space with vector-aware 
linear and non-linear registration, enabling a fully automated DTI-ALPS index 
calculation. Within-participant variances were obtained from 23 healthy 
volunteers in the OASIS dataset and used to set an equivalence margin of ±0.05 
and determine a required sample size of 13. The primary end-point was 
equivalence of pre- and post-treatment DTI-ALPS indices (a two one-sided test; 
one-sided α = 0.05). Second, a paired t-test was used to assess the changes. The 
intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) of the DTI-ALPS indices were also 
evaluated in identical machine environments and between different environments.
RESULTS: Baseline and three-month DTI-ALPS indices were 1.515 and 1.513, 
respectively. The mean change was 0.002 (90% confidence interval: -0.049, 
+0.045), entirely within the pre-specified margin; both one-sided p-values were 
< 0.05, confirming statistical equivalence. A paired t-test showed no 
significant difference (p = 0.94). Automated processing yielded perfect 
within-platform reproducibility (ICC = 1.00) and excellent cross-platform 
reliability (ICC = 0.99).
CONCLUSION: The DTI-ALPS index, an imaging metric associated with glymphatic 
activity, did not change during the first three months of lecanemab therapy. 
Although this finding suggests that glymphatic alterations may not be detectable 
early after treatment initiation, larger cohorts and longer follow-up periods 
are required to clarify the temporal relationship between DTI-ALPS index 
dynamics and therapeutic effects.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) disproportionately affects racial and 
ethnic minoritized populations in the United States, yet these groups remain 
markedly underrepresented in clinical research. Phase III clinical trials are 
critical for informing regulatory decision and treatment guidelines, but the 
extent to which they report and include racial and ethnic diverse participants 
in the US context has not been systematically assessed.
METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive retrospective review of all US-based Phase 
III AD clinical trials from 1997 to 2023 using the Trialtrove database, 
cross-referenced with PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, and other public sources. We 
analyzed long-term trends in the reporting and representation of racial and 
ethnic groups across the longest observation period to date.
RESULTS: Of 88 identified trials, 71 (80.7%) had published data. Nearly half 
(49.3%) did not report any race or ethnicity information. Among those that did, 
most focused on White patients, with limited and inconsistent reporting for 
racial and ethnic minoritized groups. Median enrollment was 0.9% for Asian or 
Pacific Islander, 4.5% for Black (ethnicity unspecified), 7.2% for Black 
(non-Hispanic), 5.2% for Hispanic, and 0.4% for Native American participants, 
compared to nearly 90% for White participants. Only 4.2% of trials conducted 
subgroup analysis by race or ethnicity, and none reported detailed outcome 
differences. Terminology varied widely and no trials acknowledged 
underrepresentation or proposed corrective strategies. Notably, these patterns 
showed little to no improvement over time.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Racial and ethnic minoritized populations remain 
consistently underreported and underrepresented in Phase III AD trials in the 
US, limiting the generalizability of findings and risking the exacerbation of 
health inequities. Improving equity in AD research will require standardized 
reporting, inclusive recruitment practices, and intentional efforts to engage 
underrepresented communities.

Understanding the dynamic interaction between cardiovascular and cerebrovascular 
systems during exercise is essential to evaluate the mechanisms supporting brain 
perfusion. This study examined age- and sex-specific differences in 
cardiovascular and cerebrovascular kinetics and used systems modeling to assess 
physiological coupling during moderate intensity exercise. We recruited adults 
to complete a single session of moderate intensity exercise on a recumbent 
stepper. Middle cerebral artery blood velocity (MCAv), mean arterial pressure 
(MAP), heart rate (HR), and end-tidal CO2 (PETCO2) were continuously recorded. 
In 164 participants, the kinetic profiles were analyzed using mono-exponential 
modeling and functional data analysis. Granger causality within a 
subject-specific vector autoregression framework evaluated directional influence 
among physiological signals. Advancing age was associated with an attenuated 
dynamic response for MCAv, PETCO2, and HR while MAP was elevated. Older adults 
exhibited significantly smaller MCAv amplitude and slower time constants than 
young and middle-aged groups. While sex did not influence overall MCAv, MAP, or 
HR kinetics, men had significantly higher PETCO2 throughout exercise. Granger 
causality analysis revealed bidirectional coupling among MCAv, HR, MAP, and 
PETCO2. Prior PETCO2 levels significantly predicted MCAv while MAP had both 
short- and long-lag predictive effects on MCAv. MCAv also influenced subsequent 
changes in MAP and PETCO2, indicating feedback regulation. PETCO2 emerged as a 
dominant driver of MCAv, though systemic interactions reflect an integrated 
physiological network with multi-component feedback loops. This study advances 
understanding of cerebrovascular regulation and highlights the utility of 
systems modeling during exercise.

Among the more than 90 identified genetic risk loci for late-onset Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) and related dementias, the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) ε2/ε3/ε4 
polymorphism remains the longstanding benchmark for genetic disease risk with a 
consistently large effect across studies1-10. Despite this massive signal, the 
exact mechanisms for how ε4 increases and for how ε2 decreases dementia risk is 
not well-understood. Importantly, recent trials of anti-amyloid therapies 
suggest less efficacy and higher risks of severe side effects in s4 
carriers11-13, hampering the treatment of those with the highest unmet need. To 
improve our understanding of the genetic architecture of AD in the context of 
its main genetic driver, we performed genome-wide association studies (GWASs) 
stratified by ε4 and ε2 carrier status. Such insights may help to understand and 
overcome side effects, to impact clinical trial enrolment strategies, and to 
create the scientific basis for targeted mechanism-driven therapies in 
neurodegenerative diseases.

PURPOSE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) often coexists with other brain pathologies, 
and we aimed to classify people with AD using 18 F- 
Flouro-Deoxy-Glucose-Positron Emission Tomography (FDG-PET).
METHOD: Baseline FDG-PET data were collected as part of two large scale Phase 
III clinical trials of a novel tau aggregation inhibitor drug, 
Leuco-Methylthioninium (LMTX®). A total of 794, well-characterised probable AD 
subjects were included in the study and the images were classified into "typical 
AD"(temporoparietal hypometabolism) and "mixed" (patchy hypo-metabolism in other 
vascular territories of brain such as frontal and cerebellar regions along with 
temporo-parietal hypo-metabolism) patterns based on visual interpretation. The 
differences in the two groups were further assessed with region-of-interest 
based analysis of Standardized Uptake Value Ratio (SUVR) and automated 
classification using transfer learning with visual classification as the gold 
standard.
RESULTS: Of the total of 794 (438 female) participants, 533 (284 female) were 
classified as typical AD and 261 (154 female) participants classified as mixed. 
A subset of 50 images each from typical and mixed subtypes were used for 
transfer learning and sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for one of the 
cross-validation loops was 94.73%, 95.23% and 95% respectively. The average 
accuracy to distinguish the two subtypes after 5-fold cross validation was found 
to be 97.5%.
CONCLUSIONS: This study is first of its kind to distinguish two subtypes of AD 
through visual interpretation of FDG-PET images and exploring the findings with 
a semi-quantitative method followed by transfer learning, which has been used to 
predict the two subtypes with high accuracy, sensitivity and specificity.

Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and 
Huntington's diseases as well as ataxias and fronto-temporal disorders are all 
characterized by the progressive accumulation of protein aggregates (amyloids) 
into inclusions bodies. In addition, recent experimental evidence is challenging 
the conventional view of the disease by revealing the ability of some of these 
disease-relevant proteins to be transferred between cells by means of 
extracellular vesicles (EVs), allowing the mutant protein to seed oligomers 
involving both the mutant and wild type forms of the protein. Abnormal secretion 
and levels of EVs are closely related to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative 
diseases and contribute to disease progression. Numerous studies have proposed 
EVs as therapeutic targets or biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases. In this 
review, we summarize and discuss the role of small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) 
and autophagy in cellular quality control and turn-over of the major 
aggregation-prone proteins associated to neurodegenerative disorders. We also 
highlight the advanced research progress on mechanisms regulating unconventional 
secretion, secretory autophagy and EVs biogenesis and their contribution in the 
pathological processes underlining these diseases. Finally, we outline the 
latest research on the roles of EVs in neurodegenerative diseases and their 
potential diagnostic and therapeutic significance for the treatment of these 
clinically relevant conditions.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
challenging early diagnosis and treatment. Recent advancements in deep learning 
algorithms applied to multimodal brain imaging offer promising solutions for 
improving diagnostic accuracy and predicting disease progression.
METHOD: This narrative review synthesizes current literature on deep learning 
applications in Alzheimer's disease diagnosis using multimodal neuroimaging. The 
review process involved a comprehensive search of relevant databases (PubMed, 
Embase, Google Scholar and ClinicalTrials.gov), selection of pertinent studies, 
and critical analysis of findings. We employed a best-evidence approach, 
prioritizing high-quality studies and identifying consistent patterns across the 
literature.
RESULTS: Deep learning architectures, including convolutional neural networks, 
recurrent neural networks, and transformer-based models, have shown remarkable 
potential in analyzing multimodal neuroimaging data. These models can 
effectively process structural and functional imaging modalities, extracting 
relevant features and patterns associated with Alzheimer's pathology. 
Integration of multiple imaging modalities has demonstrated improved diagnostic 
accuracy compared to single-modality approaches. Deep learning models have also 
shown promise in predictive modeling, identifying potential biomarkers and 
forecasting disease progression.
DISCUSSION: While deep learning approaches show great potential, several 
challenges remain. Data heterogeneity, small sample sizes, and limited 
generalizability across diverse populations are significant hurdles. The 
clinical translation of these models requires careful consideration of 
interpretability, transparency, and ethical implications. The future of AI in 
neurodiagnostics for Alzheimer's disease looks promising, with potential 
applications in personalized treatment strategies.

The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been increasing continuously, 
representing a major issue for public welfare. Detecting cognitive impairment 
due to AD at its early stages is an urgent prerequisite for therapeutic 
treatment to slow or halt disease progression before major brain damage occurs. 
Event-related potentials (ERPs) are a noninvasive neurophysiological technique 
with the advantages of objectivity, ease of operation, and real-time reflection 
of cognitive processing in the brain. The purpose of this paper is to 
comprehensively assess the application value of ERP in AD. By systematically 
searching relevant literature in PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus databases, 
and merging and analyzing the literature included in the study, we explored the 
roles of various components of ERP in the diagnosis, disease monitoring and 
pathological mechanism research of AD, and provided a comprehensive overview of 
the current status and prospect of the application of ERP in AD.

Neuropsychiatric disorders present a multifaceted challenge, characterized by 
cognitive, social, and motor impairments with manifold underlying mechanisms. 
Recent attention has turned to epigenetic mechanisms, particularly histone 
lysine methyltransferases (HKMTs), such as G9a, in understanding fundamental 
pathogenesis. This review provides a concise overview of the structural and 
functional features of G9a and its involvement in neuropsychiatric disorders, 
including neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) like autism spectrum disorders 
(ASD) and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), schizophrenia (SZ), epilepsy, anxiety, 
depression, and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Furthermore, it highlights the 
biochemical mechanisms of G9a-mediated histone methylations and explores 
pharmacological interventions targeting G9a for potential therapeutic avenues. 
This current knowledge underlines G9a's significance as a therapeutic target and 
sets the stage for future investigations into its role in neuropsychiatric 
disorders.

Senile plaques, comprised of nanosized aggregates of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides in 
the brain, are a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). On the other 
hand, regular physical exercise is known to significantly reduce the risk of 
developing AD. Here, it is reported on the transformation and toxicity 
mitigation of Aβ amyloid aggregation by a spontaneous "corona" of β-endorphin, a 
major peptide hormone released upon exercise to suppress post-exercise pain. 
Given that both Aβ and β-endorphin co-localize extracellularly in the brain, it 
is postulated that β-endorphin may mitigate the toxicity of Aβ aggregation via 
direct molecular interactions, thereby contributing to an exercise-mediated 
reduction of AD risk. Combining biophysical characterizations in vitro with 
atomistic discrete molecular dynamics simulations in silico, a strong 
interaction is shown between β-endorphin and Aβ, where β-endorphins are located 
at the periphery to render a corona of their hetero-complexes with Aβ. Cell 
viability, immunofluorescence and western blotting assays further revealed that 
the corona shielded cellular exposure to Aβ aggregates and suppressed the 
toxicity of Aβ in vivo. This work offered a new molecular mechanism for the 
benefits of physical exercise, which may facilitate a rational design of future 
therapy and prevention strategies against AD and dementia.

PURPOSE: To further develop and begin to validate the Framework for 
Compassionate Use of Technology with Persons with Cognitive Decline and their 
Care Partners.
METHODS: We used an experience-based co-design approach. Phase 1 involved 
interviews with participants with cognitive decline and their care partners to 
increase our understanding of their perceptions of home monitoring technology 
use. Phase 2 involved Focus group meetings with participants with cognitive 
decline, their care partners, healthcare providers and technology researchers to 
seek feedback on the framework and develop tools to support a compassionate 
approach to the use of home monitoring technology.
RESULTS: Domains and categories identified during interviews were (a) Ethical 
Principles including Addressing Privacy Concerns, Considering Dignity, Balancing 
Risks with Benefits, and Supporting Autonomy; and (b) Usefulness and Preferences 
including Technology Utility, Need for Maintenance, and Preferences for 
Information Receipt. These findings along with focus group discussions aligned 
with and further elaborated the framework. Focus groups also informed the 
development of tools to support a compassionate approach to recommending and 
selecting home monitoring technology.
CONCLUSIONS: The study provides initial support for the framework. More research 
is needed to test applicability and the usefulness in practice settings.

Plain Language Summary: The Framework for Compassionate Use of Technology with 
Persons with Cognitive Decline and their Care Partners can be used to guide 
rehabilitation providers in selecting and recommending home monitoring 
technology with people with cognitive decline.Rehabilitation providers should 
adopt a family-centered approach to work collaboratively with both persons with 
cognitive decline and their care partners when selecting and recommending home 
monitoring technology.

Nano-chaperones represent an innovative therapeutic approach targeting amyloid 
aggregation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), two 
diseases linked by similar pathogenic mechanisms involving protein misfolding 
and insulin resistance. Current treatments primarily address symptoms, yet 
nano-chaperones can potentially intervene at the molecular level by mimicking 
natural chaperone proteins to prevent or reverse amyloid aggregation. In AD, 
nano-chaperones target amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, reducing neurotoxicity and 
preserving neuronal function, while in T2DM, they inhibit islet amyloid 
polypeptide (IAPP) aggregation, alleviating cytotoxic stress on pancreatic 
β-cells. These nanoparticles exhibit a dual capacity for cellular penetration 
and selectivity in interacting with misfolded proteins, showing promise in 
mitigating the shared amyloidogenic pathways of both diseases. Preclinical 
studies have demonstrated significant reductions in amyloid toxicity with 
potential applications in crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to enhance 
central nervous system (CNS) delivery. Nano-chaperones transformative role in 
developing multi-targeted precision therapies for complex diseases is 
highlighted, underscoring their capacity to modulate disease progression through 
targeted biomimetic interactions. Nano-chaperone designs for clinical 
application focus on enhancing therapeutic efficacy and safety. This innovative 
approach may redefine treatment paradigms for amyloid-related diseases, offering 
a new frontier in personalized medicine.

BACKGROUND: This study aims to assess the evolution of cognitive performances 
over a 5-year follow-up period in community-dwelling older people with negative 
plasma p-tau181 levels and to determine whether frailty could discriminate 
between those who experience cognitive decline and those who do not, in the 
p-tau negative groups.
METHODS: This is a 5-year analysis of the Multidomain Alzheimer Prevention Trial 
(MAPT) testing cognitive evolution among 503 community-dwelling individuals with 
available data on plasma p-tau181. Negative p-tau status was assigned according 
to 3 different cut-offs: amyloid-PET positivity (9.6 pg/mL), highest tertile for 
baseline p-tau181 distribution (10.9 pg/mL), and Alzheimer's disease diagnosis 
prediction (12.4 pg/mL) cut-offs. Cognition was measured using a validated 
composite cognitive score derived from the Z-scores of 4 cognitive tests. 
Longitudinal changes from baseline in the composite cognitive score according to 
plasma p-tau181 status were compared using linear mixed models.
RESULTS: In a population with an end-of-study median age of 79 years 
(interquartile range: 76-82), whatever the cut-off, the overall group with 
negative p-tau181 status did not develop cognitive decline over the follow-up. 
Among the p-tau181 negative groups, individuals who declined had a higher 
prevalence of frailty compared to those who did not decline.
CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive performance in older people with negative plasma p-tau181 
levels remains stable over a 5-year period. This may suggest that older age 
alone, in the absence of positive biomarkers for brain pathology (or frailty), 
is not associated with cognitive decline. Frailty may increase vulnerability to 
the neuropathological burden associated with Alzheimer's disease.

Trimethyltin hydrochloride (TMT) induces hippocampal neurodegeneration and 
learning and memory impairments, providing a useful experimental model for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) research. This study aimed to explore the 
neuroprotective effects of myricetin, a naturally occurring flavonoid with 
antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, against TMT-induced hippocampal 
damage and elucidate some of its underlying molecular mechanisms. Male NMRI mice 
(n = 32) were divided into four experimental groups: control, control 
+ myricetin, TMT, and TMT + myricetin. Neurodegeneration was induced by 
intraperitoneal TMT injection (2.8 mg/kg), followed by daily oral administration 
of myricetin (25 mg/kg) for 21 days. Learning and memory-related function was 
assessed using passive avoidance, novel object recognition, and Y-maze tests. 
After behavioral tasks, hippocampal levels of oxidative stress parameters 
(glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, malondialdehyde 
(MDA)), inflammatory markers (tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), 
interleukin-10 (IL-10)), and endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway proteins 
(GRP78, PERK, IRE1α, and CHOP) were evaluated. Histological examinations 
included Nissl staining to quantify neuronal degeneration in CA1 and dentate 
gyrus regions, as well as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) 
immunohistochemistry. Myricetin treatment attenuated TMT-induced learning and 
memory impairments and neuronal loss in the CA1 and dentate gyrus subfields. It 
significantly enhanced hippocampal levels of GSH, SOD and catalase activities, 
and IL-10 while reducing levels of MDA, TNF-α, and GFAP immunoreactivity. 
Moreover, myricetin alleviated the TMT-induced elevation of GRP78, PERK, IRE1α, 
and CHOP. These findings suggest that myricetin holds promise as a therapeutic 
candidate for AD and other neurodegenerative disorders by counteracting 
oxidative stress, suppressing neuroinflammation, and modulating endoplasmic 
reticulum stress pathways.

The development of novel therapies for central nervous system (CNS) diseases, 
particularly neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease (AD), is a 
critical global health priority. Biotherapeutics, such as monoclonal antibodies 
(mAbs) and RNA-based therapies, have shown potential for treating brain 
disorders. However, their clinical progress is limited by their difficult access 
to their brain targets. At the preclinical level, nanotechnology has been shown, 
to help these molecules overcome the biological barriers that imped their 
adequate brain delivery. This review highlights advances in this area and the 
challenges for the translation to the clinic. Key nanotechnology-based 
strategies, such as surface modifications utilizing endogenous protein corona, 
functionalization with targeting ligands, therapeutic ultrasound-mediated 
microbubble oscillation were particularly analyzed. Additionally, in line with 
the focus of the Special Issue, this review integrates the concept of 
chronotherapy, with a focus on AD treatment, highlighting the idea that, by 
aligning nanoparticle (NP)-based drug delivery with circadian rhythms, it may be 
possible to improve therapeutic outcomes. Finally, the article analyzes current 
strategies in CNS drug delivery in clinical trials and provides future 
directions within this frame, notably in the area of AD.

BACKGROUND: Aluminum (Al) exposure has been implicated in neurodegenerative 
disorders, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD). Due to their small size and 
increased bioavailability, Al oxide nanoparticles (Al-NP) exhibit greater 
neurotoxicity than bulk Al, leading to hippocampal damage, neuronal loss, and 
cognitive decline. This study investigates whether agmatine, a polyamine with 
neuroprotective properties, mitigates Al-NP-induced memory impairment and 
hippocampal neurodegeneration.
METHODS: Male Swiss mice (SWR/J) were randomly assigned to four groups: Control, 
Al-NP (10 mg/kg, oral), Al-NP + Agmatine (5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg, intraperitoneal). 
Cognitive function was assessed using the Novel Object Recognition (NOR) test. 
Stereological analysis quantified hippocampal volume, as well as the volume and 
cell number of the CA1 and dentate gyrus (DG) sub-regions. Apoptosis was 
evaluated via cleaved caspase-3, Bax, and Bcl-2 expression using western blot 
analysis.
RESULTS: Al-NP exposure significantly impaired memory performance, reduced 
hippocampal volume, and induced atrophy and neuronal loss in CA1 and DG. 
Molecular analysis revealed elevated cleaved caspase-3 expression, increased 
Bax, decreased Bcl-2, and an elevated Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, indicating activation of 
intrinsic apoptosis. Agmatine (10 mg/kg) effectively restored memory function, 
preserved hippocampal structure, and normalized apoptotic markers, suggesting 
its neuroprotective role.
CONCLUSION: Agmatine exerts potent neuroprotective effects against Al-NP-induced 
hippocampal toxicity by mitigating memory deficits, preventing neuronal loss, 
and suppressing apoptosis through downregulation of cleaved caspase-3 and 
modulation of Bax/Bcl-2 signaling. These structural and molecular changes may 
underlie its cognitive benefits. Given the role of hippocampal atrophy in AD, 
agmatine may be a promising candidate for preventing Al-related 
neurodegeneration and AD progression.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by neuronal damage, with poor prognosis and limited therapeutic 
options. Inhibition of neuronal ferroptosis has shown promise as a potential 
treatment for AD. Schisandrin B (Sch B), a major active component of Schisandra 
chinensis, exhibits potential neuroprotective effects. However, whether Sch B 
inhibits neuronal ferroptosis remains unclear.
PURPOSE: To investigate the mechanisms underlying the effects of Sch B on the 
GSK3β/Nrf2/GPX4 and FSP1 signaling pathways, which are the suppression of 
neuronal ferroptosis and the potential therapeutic intervention in AD.
METHODS: We employed the 3 × Tg mouse model in vivo, and utilized the 
erastin-induced ferroptosis model in SH-SY5Y/APP695swe cells in vitro. Nissl 
staining was conducted to facilitate histopathological assessment. Assessment of 
neuronal ferroptosis was performed utilizing a lipid peroxidation and 
ferroptosis marker assay kit. Furthermore, bioinformatic analysis was executed 
with the application of the GEO database. Immunofluorescence and Western blot 
analyses were performed to quantify protein expression levels within the 
cellular context. ELISA was utilized to determine cytokine concentrations within 
the supernatant of cell cultures. RT-PCR was executed to evaluate mRNA 
expression levels.
RESULTS: Sch B suppresses the activation of GSK3β, modulating the Nrf2/GPX4 
signaling pathway and consequently inhibiting ferroptosis in neurons, which 
results in amelioration of cognitive impairment and pathological damage in 3 × 
Tg mice. Sch B also inhibits GSK3β activation, thereby modulating the Nrf2/GPX4 
signaling pathway to prevent erastin-induced ferroptosis in SH-SY5Y695swe cells 
in vitro. Furthermore, Sch B modulates FSP1, enhancing its synergistic 
interaction with the GSK3β/Nrf2/GPX4 pathway to suppress neuronal ferroptosis. 
Sch B can also inhibit TNF-α release from neurons undergoing ferroptosis, thus 
impeding the activation of M1-type microglia, suggesting a multifaceted 
neuroprotective strategy against neuroinflammatory processes.
CONCLUSION: Sch B modulates the GSK3β/Nrf2/GPX4 pathway in conjunction with FSP1 
to inhibit neuronal ferroptosis and the subsequent microglial M1 polarization 
mediated by neuronal ferroptosis, thereby improving cognitive impairment and 
pathological damage in AD.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by cholinergic dysfunction, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, 
and memory impairment. The Salvia genus has been used since ancient times for 
its anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. In this study, we aimed to 
investigate the effects of Salvia aristata hydroalcoholic extract (SAHE) and 
dichloromethane extract (SADE) on various aspects of memory and AD.
METHODS: Column chromatography was utilized in the phytochemical analysis to 
isolate and purify bioactive compounds. The structures of the isolated compounds 
were determined through spectroscopic techniques, including 1D and 2D NMR, along 
with IR, UV, and HRESIMS for the new compound. Cholinesterase inhibitory 
activity was assessed using a modified Ellman's method. Additionally, the 
antioxidant activity and metal chelation capacity of SAHE and SADE were 
evaluated using the DPPH assay and spectroscopic methods, respectively. 
Moreover, the neuroprotective effects in PC12 cells were investigated using the 
AlamarBlue assay, and the ability to mitigate scopolamine-induced memory 
impairment in rats was assessed using the Morris water maze (MWM) test.
RESULTS: In this study, we isolated and structurally elucidated an undescribed 
compound, namely salvinarin (2), as well as four known compounds including 
linariin (1), pectolinarin (3), scutellarein 4'-O-methyl-7-O-rutinoside (4), and 
5-O-coumaroylquinic acid (5) from SAHE for the first time. In vitro analyses 
revealed that SAHE, SADE, and linariin exhibited significant neuroprotective 
effects against H2O2-induced cytotoxicity in PC12 cells. Notably, SAHE 
demonstrated potent acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition (IC50 = 322.83 ± 1.11 
µg/mL), significant antioxidant activity (IC50 = 99.16 ± 1.24 µg/mL), and strong 
metal chelating capacity toward Cu2+, Zn2+, and Fe2+. Moreover, oral 
administration of SAHE (400 mg/kg/day) significantly ameliorated memory 
impairment induced by scopolamine in a rat model. This improvement was evident 
in parameters such as traveled distance (p < 0.001), escape latency (p < 0.001), 
and time spent in the target quadrant (p < 0.01) in the Morris water maze test.
CONCLUSIONS: Considering all findings, including significant neuroprotective, 
antioxidant, and metal-chelating properties, alongside notable efficacy in 
enhancing memory in rat models, S. aristata could be a potential candidate for 
memory improvement.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition that 
causes a substantial decline in cognitive functions and affects memory, thinking 
abilities, and daily behavior. The most prominent hallmark of AD pathogenesis is 
the formation of amyloid-β plaques, among other associated pathways such as 
neurofibrillary tangles, mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and 
oxidative stress. Butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), an acetylcholine-degrading 
enzyme, plays a critical role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease, 
particularly through its involvement in amyloid-β plaque formation. Thus, the 
inhibition of BuChE is considered a valuable therapeutic strategy for the 
management of AD. The present study aimed to identify potential bioactive 
chemicals from naturally occurring dietary compounds that could improve 
neurocognitive function and appear as a viable treatment for AD by inhibiting 
the function of BuChE. A small library of 44 natural dietary chemicals from a 
variety of dietary plants was subjected to comprehensive in silico studies, 
including molecular docking, molecular mechanics generalized born surface area 
(MM-GBSA) calculations, pharmacokinetics assessments, toxicity profiles, 
molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, and density functional theory (DFT) 
analysis. These studies revealed that CID 129886986 and CID 115269 showed 
stronger binding affinities with drug-likeness and no toxicity than the 
FDA-approved standard drug, Donepezil. Additionally, they exhibited strong 
structural stability with fewer fluctuations throughout the simulation, making 
them promising candidates for Alzheimer's disease treatment.

The recent approval of anti-amyloid pharmaceuticals for the treatment of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) has created a pressing need for the ability to 
accurately identify optimal candidates for anti-amyloid therapy, specifically 
those with evidence for incipient cognitive decline, since patients with mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) may remain stable for several years even with 
positive AD biomarkers. Using fluorodeoxyglucose PET and biomarker data from 594 
ADNI patients, a neural network ensemble was trained to forecast cognition from 
MCI diagnostic baseline. Training data comprised PET studies of patients with 
biological AD. The ensemble discriminated between progressive and stable 
prodromal subjects (MCI with positive amyloid and tau) at baseline with 88.6% 
area-under-curve, 88.6% (39/44) accuracy, 73.7% (14/19) sensitivity and 100% 
(25/25) specificity in the test set. It also correctly classified all other test 
subjects (healthy or AD continuum subjects across the cognitive spectrum) with 
86.4% accuracy (206/239), 77.4% sensitivity (33/42) and 88.23% (165/197) 
specificity. By identifying patients with prodromal AD who will not progress to 
dementia, our model could significantly reduce overall societal burden and cost 
if implemented as a screening tool. The model's high positive predictive value 
in the prodromal test set makes it a practical means for selecting candidates 
for anti-amyloid therapy and trials.

IMPORTANCE: While many studies have shown that greater amounts or longer 
durations of walking are associated with a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) or cognitive decline in older adults, the neuropathological basis for this 
is not yet fully understood.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between walking intensity and duration 
and longitudinal changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related brain pathologies, 
including Aβ and tau accumulation, neurodegeneration, and white matter 
hyperintensity (WMH).
DESIGN: Data were drawn from the Korean Brain Aging Study for the Early 
Diagnosis and Prediction of AD, a longitudinal cohort study (initiated in 2014).
SETTING: Community and memory clinic setting.
PARTICIPANTS: One hundred fifty-one older adults.
MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Participants underwent baseline and 4-year follow-up 
neuroimaging assessments. Lifetime walking, as measured using the Lifetime Total 
Physical Activity Questionnaire, was categorized by intensity (high vs. low) and 
duration (short ≤360 min/week vs. long >360 min/week), forming four combined 
walking groups. Aβ and tau deposition, neurodegeneration, and WMH volume were 
assessed via PET/MRI.
RESULTS: Long-duration or high-intensity walking was associated with 
significantly reduced Aβ accumulation over 4 years. The high-combined walking 
group showed similar benefits, while medium-combined groups did not. The effect 
was significant only in the early life-initiated walking subgroup. No 
associations were found with tau, neurodegeneration, or WMH volume.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-duration, high-intensity walking may reduce brain Aβ 
accumulation, potentially lowering AD risk, particularly when initiated before 
late life.

This study introduces a novel joint technique combining "parallel peptide 
synthesis" and "de novo sequencing", which facilitates the high-throughput 
screening and structure validation of biological peptides derived from food and 
traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Sea cucumber (Stichopus japonicus) was used 
as a model organism, undergoing simulated gastrointestinal digestion followed by 
de novo sequencing to predict potential peptides. Subsequently, cost-effective 
filter pipette tips were innovatively employed as parallel reaction vessels, 
enabling efficient peptide synthesis through the microfluidic flow of amino acid 
solutions over the loaded resin. After high-throughput biological activity 
screening, peptide YPGQLT was identified as the most potent antioxidant and 
acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor. It was then subjected to a molecular 
docking study to further explore its potential ligand-receptor interactions. 
This synergistic effect highlights peptide YPGQLT as a promising candidate for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment, thereby enhancing the potential biomedical 
application of sea cucumber. Notably, de novo predicted sequences can be further 
verified by comparing their characteristics, such as retention time and MS/MS 
spectrum, with those from the standard reference synthesized using this parallel 
synthesis protocol.

Both neuronal and peripheral tissues become disrupted in Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). However, a comprehensive understanding of how AD impacts different tissues 
across the whole organism is lacking. Using Drosophila, we generated an AD Fly 
Cell Atlas (AD-FCA) based on whole-organism single-nucleus transcriptomes of 219 
cell types from flies expressing AD-associated proteins, either human amyloid-β 
42 peptide (Aβ42) or Tau, in neurons. We found that Aβ42 primarily affects the 
nervous system, including sensory neurons, while Tau induces accelerated aging 
in peripheral tissues. We identified a neuronal cluster enriched in Aβ42 flies, 
which has high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) expression. This LDH-high cluster is 
conserved in 5XFAD mouse and human AD datasets. We found a conserved defect in 
fat metabolism from both fly and mouse tauopathy models. The AD-FCA offers new 
insights into how Aβ42 or Tau systemically and differentially affects a whole 
organism and provides a valuable resource for understanding brain-body 
communication in neurodegeneration.

Over the past few decades, extensive research has delved into the health 
advantages of flavonoids, exploring their physiological effects through 
cell-based assays, epidemiological studies, and human intervention trials. The 
regular intake of plant-derived flavonoids has shown therapeutic potential 
against noncommunicable pathophysiological conditions, including carcinoma and 
various inflammatory disorders. Among the myriads of flavonoids, many have been 
shown to inhibit the aggregation of amyloid-beta peptides in Alzheimer's 
disease, while anthocyanins exhibit cardioprotective effects by improving 
endothelial function and lowering blood pressure. In addition, their efficacy is 
known to manage infectious communicable diseases caused by various bacteria and 
viruses, such as S. pneumoniae and SARS-CoV-2. Currently, flavonoids are being 
used to develop new drugs for both communicable and noncommunicable diseases 
because of their intricate metabolism and bioavailability, leveraging their 
anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. This concise review provides 
insights into the potential of flavonoids for therapeutics and disease 
management, particularly with respect to cardiovascular health, neuroprotection, 
and antimicrobial action. The implications of these findings underscore the 
necessity for further exploration of flavonoid-rich diets and their

Holothuria scabra (H. scabra), a marine organism traditionally known for its 
health benefits, has been utilized in both food and medicine. Our previous 
studies indicated that 2-butoxytetrahydrofuran (2-BTHF), which is isolated from 
H. scabra, possesses the potential to alleviate amyloid-β and α-synuclein 
accumulations associated with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases (AD and PD), 
respectively. However, the mechanisms through which 2-BTHF mitigates PD-related 
neurotoxicity remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of 
2-BTHF on a 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced Caenorhabditis elegans (C. 
elegans) model. Our results demonstrated that 2-BTHF recovered dopaminergic 
(DAergic) neurons from degeneration and restored dopamine-related behaviors. 
Furthermore, 2-BTHF reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, preserved 
mitochondrial fluorescence, and decreased both mitochondrial and cytoplasmic 
unfolded protein responses (UPRmt and UPRcyto) activation. Transcriptome 
sequencing analysis revealed the critical roles of various systems, including 
the immune system, nervous system, glutathione (GSH) metabolism, xenobiotics, 
terpenoids, energy metabolism, cell growth and death, and aging-related 
longevity pathways. Additionally, 2-BTHF showed potential interactions with 
stress resistance and detoxification transcription factors, promoting the 
nuclear translocation of DAF-16 and SKN-1, which in turn activated their 
targets, including SOD-3, CTL-2, GCS-1, and GST-4. Moreover, 2-BTHF increased 
total GSH levels and reduced the ced-3-related cascade. This study demonstrates 
that 2-BTHF holds promise as a therapeutic agent for treating 6-OHDA-induced 
DAergic neurodegeneration in the C. elegans model.

The progressive nature of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), such as Parkinson's 
disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis, presents substantial problems because current treatments are still 
obscure. Stem cell-based treatments are emerging as a viable solution to address 
the significant gaps in treating these severe diseases. This study provides a 
comprehensive analysis of the latest advancements in stem cell research, 
focusing on the treatment of NDs. Various types of stem cells, such as adult, 
induced pluripotent, and embryonic stem cells, and their potential applications 
in immunomodulation, neurotrophic factor release, and neuronal development are 
also discussed. Recent clinical studies reveal outcomes, challenges, and 
solutions, with advancements in disease-specific neural cell production, gene 
editing, and improved stem cell transplantation transport strategies. The review 
discussed future perspectives on developing more effective stem cell-based 
interventions. Biomaterials are being used for cell distribution and 
personalized medicine techniques to improve treatment outcomes, while exploring 
stem cell treatments for NDs and identifying areas for further research.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by hallmark pathological changes such as amyloid β (Aβ) plaques, 
neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) due to tau hyperphosphorylation, and 
neuroinflammation. Current therapeutic approaches focusing on single-target 
strategies exhibit limited efficacy, necessitating the exploration of novel 
multi-target approaches. Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) and SIRT2, as two types 
of cytosolic histone deacetylases, have emerged as promising targets for AD 
treatment. HDAC6 plays a role in tau protein phosphorylation, while SIRT2 is 
involved in Aβ production. Both enzymes regulate microtubule proteins, impacting 
the formation of NFTs and Aβ plaques. Inhibition of HDAC6 reduces tau 
hyperphosphorylation, improves microtubule stability, and mitigates 
neuroinflammation, whereas SIRT2 inhibition attenuates Aβ accumulation and 
neuroinflammation. Recent studies indicate that dual-targeted inhibition of 
HDAC6 and SIRT2 may exhibit synergistic effects, suggesting it as a promising 
strategy for AD treatment. This review summarizes the biological roles of HDAC6 
and SIRT2 in AD pathology and examines the development of dual-target 
inhibitors. It also discusses the challenges, including selectivity and 
toxicity, emphasizing that the development of combined HDAC6 and SIRT2 
inhibitors represents a new direction for future AD treatment.

Disruption of the Wnt signaling pathway (WSP), a highly conserved pathway 
essential for growth and organ development, has been proven to play a role in 
the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study focused on repurposing 
the FDA-approved drug, Voglibose to target the DKK1-LRP6 site with the goal of 
upregulating WSP in in vitro as well as rodent model of AD. Based on our 
previous computational approach, Voglibose was evaluated for the DKK1 binding, 
neuroprotective effects were examined using SHSY5Y cells, while WSP activation 
was analyzed through RTPCR in the HEK293/LRP6 cell line. Rodent model of AD was 
developed using intracerebroventricular administration of Aβ25-35. Male Wistar 
rats were randomly assigned to receive oral doses of Voglibose (1 and 10 mg/kg) 
for 28 days, after which behavioral assessments, biochemical analyses, RT-PCR, 
and histopathological evaluations were conducted. Voglibose showed significant 
reduction in the DKK1 binding, neuroprotective property in SHSY5Y as well as 
activation of WSP in LRP6 overexpressed HEK293 cells. There was a significant 
decrease in the island latency in rats treated with lower dose (p < 0.01) and 
higher dose (p < 0.05) of Voglibose when compared to the disease control rats. 
Similarly, in the behavioral tests, Voglibose significantly improved cognition. 
The deposition of amyloid plaques was found to be considerably more in the 
disease control rats which got reduced in the treatment groups as observed in 
the histopathological slides stained with Congo red. Significant alterations in 
mRNA levels and protein expression of glycogen synthase kinase-β (GSK-3β), 
β-catenin (β-cat) was observed in rat brain homogenates indicating upregulation 
of WSP. In conclusion, Voglibose demonstrated significant neuroprotective 
potential in a cell line study and showed potential cognitive benefits in a rat 
model of AD. Furthermore, its ability to activate WSP highlights its immense 
potential as AD therapeutic to enhance memory and modulate key neuroprotective 
mechanisms.

The assay of plasma biomarkers plays a role in the assessment of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) and the monitoring of treatments. One of the ultra-sensitive assay 
technologies is the so-called immunomagnetic reduction (IMR). According to 
published papers, plasma amyloid β1-42 peptide (Aβ1-42) and total tau protein 
(T-Tau) are crucial biomarkers. From a practical point of view, it is necessary 
to monitor the longitudinal assay results in individuals frequently. Hence, it 
is essential to investigate the time-course measured concentrations of Aβ1-42 
and T-Tau in control samples using IMR. In this work, the time-course measured 
concentrations of the control samples (Aβ1-42: 20 pg/ml; T-Tau: 50 pg/ml) in IMR 
from 2016 to 2024 are analyzed. In addition to control samples, the reported 
levels of Aβ1-42 and T-Tau in human plasma from 2016 to 2024 assayed with IMR in 
cognitively normal subjects are inspected. The results show that the slopes of 
the year-dependent measured concentrations of Aβ1-42 and T-Tau in control 
samples over the 8 years do not significantly deviate from zero (p > 0.05). The 
insignificant drift in the reported Aβ1-42 and T-Tau concentrations in human 
plasma over the 8 years is also found (p > 0.05). These results reveal high 
consistencies in measured Aβ1-42 and T-Tau concentrations from time to time 
using IMR.

Sporadic Alzheimer's disease (SAD) represents one of the major memory deficits 
that is characterized by tau hyperphosphorylation and amyloid beta (Aβ) 
deposition in the brain. Both are considered AD hallmarks which are mediated 
through neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and cholinergic circuit 
interruption. This study aimed to show how limettin and PD98059 exert a 
neuroprotective effect against SAD and the possible role of the extracellular 
regulated kinase (p-ERK1/2) and glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (p-GSK-3β) 
(Ser9)/cAMP-response element binding protein (p-CREB) (Ser133)/brain derived 
neurotrophic factor (BDNF) pathway. Control animals (Group I) received the 
vehicles, group II received PD98059 (10 mg/kg/i.p), while group III was 
administered limettin (15 mg/kg/i.p). Additionally, the other three groups 
received a single dose of streptozotocin (STZ; 3 mg/kg/ICV), where group IV 
served as the SAD group, while groups V and VI received PD98059 and limettin 
daily for 3 weeks, respectively. The SAD animals receiving PD98059 and limettin 
increased the number of arm entries, % alternations in Y-maze, with reduction in 
mean escape latency, increase in time spent in target quadrant and platform 
crossing in Morris Water Maze, compared to the SAD group. Additionally, PD98059 
and limettin administration to the STZ group downregulated persistent activation 
of p-ERK1/2 which in turn increased p-GSK-3β (Ser9), leading to enhanced p-CREB 
(Ser133) and BDNF expressions, as well as reducing inflammatory markers viz., 
nuclear factor-kappa B and interleukin-6, leading to decreased Aβ deposition. 
Both treatments reduced immunohistochemical p-tau expression, brain edema, and 
increased intact neuron cells remarkably. Thus, based on these findings, PD98059 
and limettin may have promising effects in protecting against SAD. Using 
blockers/inhibitory molecules are recommended to confirm effect through the 
corresponding pathway.

Microglial activation has emerged as a hallmark of neuroinflammation in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Central to this process is the formation and 
accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide and neurofibrillary tangles, both of 
which contribute to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal cell death. Aβ oligomers 
trigger microglial activation, leading to the release of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines, which further exacerbates neuroinflammation and neuronal damage. 
Importantly, the presence of activated microglia surrounding amyloid plaques is 
correlated with heightened production of cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1β 
and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), creating a vicious cycle of 
inflammation. While microglia play a protective role by clearing Aβ plaques 
during the early stages of AD, their chronic activation can lead to detrimental 
outcomes, including enhanced tau pathology and neuronal apoptosis. Recent 
studies have highlighted the dualistic nature of microglial activation, 
showcasing both inflammatory (M1) and anti-inflammatory (M2) phenotypes that 
fluctuate based on the surrounding microenvironment. Disruption in microglial 
function and regulation can lead to neurovascular dysfunction, further 
contributing to the cognitive decline seen in AD. Moreover, emerging biomarkers 
and imaging techniques are unveiling the complexity of microglial responses in 
AD, providing avenues for targeted therapeutics aimed at modulating these cells. 
Understanding the intricate interplay between microglia, Aβ, and tau pathology 
is vital for developing potential interventions to mitigate neuroinflammation 
and its impact on cognitive decline in AD. This review synthesizes current 
findings regarding microglial activation and its implications for AD 
pathogenesis, offering insights into future therapeutic strategies.

Neuroinflammation induced by the accumulation of amyloid beta plaques expedites 
the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Reducing Aβ plaques and associated 
neuroinflammation could potentially help to delay the progression of AD. 
Cannabidiol (CBD) is well-known for its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and 
neuroprotective nature, and the ApoE2 is effective in binding and clearing Aβ 
plaques in the brain. Therefore, codelivery of CBD and pApoE2 to the brain would 
be a promising therapeutic approach in developing effective therapeutics against 
AD. This research aims to design a nonviral delivery agent that delivers both 
drugs and genes to the brain through a noninvasive intranasal route. We have 
developed mPEG-PLGA nanoparticles coated with mannose, a brain-targeting ligand, 
to deliver CBD and pApoE2. The designed CBD-loaded coated nanoparticles showed 
an average diameter of 179.3 ± 4.57 nm and a zeta potential of 30.3 ± 6.45 mV. 
The coated nanoparticles prolonged the CBD release and showed a 93% release of 
its payload in 30 days. CBD-loaded nanoparticles, as compared to the free CBD, 
significantly reduced lipopolysaccharide and amyloid beta-induced inflammation 
in immortalized microglia cells. Cytotoxicity of the designed nanoparticles was 
assessed against brain endothelial cells (bEND.3) and found to be nontoxic in 
nature. The mannose-conjugated chitosan-coated nanoparticles were cationic and 
able to bind with the pApoE2, protecting the encapsulated pApoE2 from enzymatic 
degradation. Quantitative in vitro transfection efficiency study in primary 
astrocytes and primary neurons revealed that the ApoE2 expression level is 
significantly (P < 0.0001) higher for mPLGA-CBD-MC/pApoE2 than the control. The 
ApoE2 expression level in the brain of C57BL6/J mice was significantly (P < 
0.0001) increased after intranasal administration of mPLGA-CBD-MC/pApoE2. 
Henceforth, the mannose-conjugated chitosan-coated mPLGA nanoparticles could 
serve as a nonviral delivery system to deliver both drugs and genes to the brain 
through the intranasal route for the management of AD.

PurposeDelirium is a common yet preventable complication of hospitalization, 
surgery and illness that is associated with poor outcomes. Older adults with 
Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) are especially vulnerable to 
delirium and experience greater delirium severity, yet no existing assessment 
tool is specifically designed to evaluate this vulnerable population. This study 
will validate two new delirium severity instruments, the Delirium Severity 
(DEL-S) rating for all older adults and the Delirium Severity Rating in ADRD 
(DEL-S-AD) for patients with dementia.Design/Setting and ParticipantsThe Better 
ASsessment of ILlness II (BASIL II) study is an innovative prospective cohort 
study that measures cognitive function, delirium, delirium severity, 
demographics, clinical and functional variables and clinical outcomes. 
Participants include older adults from 3 unique yet complementary clinical 
sites: medical inpatients, elective surgery inpatients, or skilled nursing 
facility residents.MethodsPerformance of DEL-S and DEL-S-AD items in older 
adults with cognition ranging from no impairment to moderate impairment will be 
determined. Analyses will include psychometric characteristics of DEL-S and 
DEL-S-AD items, harmonization of the two scales and validation against reference 
standard diagnoses.Conclusions and ImplicationsResults from this study will help 
accurately measure delirium severity, a critically important, graded outcome. 
The DEL-S-AD instrument holds broad applications in persons with and without 
ADRD to monitor delirium severity in clinical settings, and as an outcome 
measure in future clinical treatment trials and pathophysiologic studies. 
Ultimately, the DEL-S and DEL-S-AD have the potential to improve health care for 
the vulnerable, growing population of older adults with cognitive impairment 
worldwide.

OBJECTIVE: Vortioxetine is a multimodal antidepressant approved for the 
treatment of major depressive episodes. As part of the overall European 
risk-management plan, we aimed to fill data gaps on relevant missing information 
such as the extent of vortioxetine use in special populations and assessment of 
selected potential risks.
METHODS: This non-interventional post-authorization safety study used 
longitudinal administrative claims/medical records data from 10,358 patients 
newly prescribed vortioxetine in Finland, Spain, and the Netherlands (EU-PAS 
register: EUPAS19199).
RESULTS: Elderly patients (≥75 years) accounted for 3-14% of the assessed 
populations, while off-label pediatric prescribing was low (0.1-0.5%). Patients 
with a comorbid diagnosis of mania/hypomania accounted for 0.4-10% of the 
population, while patients with comorbid neurological conditions accounted for 
≤3% of patients. The median prescribed daily vortioxetine dose was 10 mg and 
mean exposure was 72-238 days. The proportions of patients who had one of the 
events of interest (suicidal events, epilepsy, convulsions/seizures, severe 
renal or hepatic events) recorded during vortioxetine exposure were all ≤1%.
CONCLUSION: In this European healthcare database study, the extent and 
characteristics of vortioxetine use were in line with clinical trial experience 
and the current label. Analyses of events, including those of special interest, 
did not raise any new safety concerns.

Plain Language Summary: For people with major depressive disorder (MDD), it is 
crucial that antidepressant treatments, like vortioxetine, are safe and 
well-tolerated to ensure patients stick with their medication and achieve 
successful treatment outcomes. The European Medicines Authority often requires 
drug manufacturers to evaluate potential risks once a drug is in regular use. 
This evaluation, known as a “risk management plan”, looks at how the drug is 
used in everyday practice and assesses its safety, especially in vulnerable 
patients. As part of the European Vortioxetine Risk Management Plan, researchers 
used health data from Finland, Spain, and the Netherlands to: 1.Understand how 
vortioxetine is being used in patients who were not included in earlier clinical 
trials. This includes elderly people, children, stroke survivors, pregnant 
women, and those living with other long-term conditions like mania/hypomania, 
Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and severe kidney 
or liver problems.2.Look for rare safety risks such as suicide, seizures, kidney 
or liver side-effects, and the potential for drug abuse.The study analyzed data 
from over 10,000 patients treated with vortioxetine. It found that vortioxetine 
was generally used as recommended in the European prescribing guidelines, with 
an average daily dose of 10 mg in all three countries. Depression treatment 
guidelines recommend long-term use of antidepressants for at least 6–12 months 
to prevent relapse, and the study confirmed that vortioxetine is typically used 
for about 7–8 months on average. The analysis did not reveal any new safety 
concerns, supporting the established safety profile of vortioxetine.

BACKGROUND: We explored people with dementia and their family carers' 
experiences of future care planning, guided by Kukla's model of conscientious 
autonomy. This relational autonomy concept focuses on the alignment of 
self-managed health-care practices with people's authentic goals and values. It 
involves people adopting recommended practices for their own authentic reasons, 
questioning them where necessary, and being supported by the health and care 
system to understand their rationale and implement them effectively.
METHODS: In-depth interviews were conducted with 16 people recently diagnosed 
with dementia and 31 family carers, purposively and selectively sampled from a 
large research cohort on the basis of their 'conscientiousness,' using the 
indicator of already having had informal family conversations about future care. 
Data were analysed thematically using NVivo software and methods informed by 
interpretive grounded theory.
FINDINGS: Participants sought to feel secure by following recommended practices, 
manage uncertainty, avoid crises, share burdens within families, and avoid poor 
end-of-life experiences. However, support was often lacking. Many were unable to 
speak with specialists and described limited conversations with GPs, leaving 
them with unaddressed questions. Some described feelings of abandonment. Disease 
progression was commonly poorly explained, with some participants later 
encountering information they found confronting. Carers who continued 
researching the condition felt responsible but under-resourced for discussing 
disease progression with their relative and believed this should be undertaken 
by a professional. Formal processes-e.g. Lasting Power of Attorney (LPAs), 
advance care planning, Do Not Attempt Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation (DNACPR) 
could prompt informal discussions but gaining an overview was difficult, with 
confusion about how they would be utilised, what information to include and 
apparent overlap between processes. Misunderstandings about medical and 
end-of-life decision-making were commonplace.
CONCLUSION: If even those who are most conscientious about planning for future 
care struggle to access adequate support, others likely face greater challenges. 
Clearer communication, at an individual and public level, about disease 
progression, the practical challenges of medical and end-of-life 
decision-making, and palliative care options is urgently needed. Early group 
education sessions and communication strategies that engage with existing lay 
concepts and public discourse are likely to be helpful. Formal care planning 
processes should be clearer, more streamlined, and better aligned with the 
practical goals of people with dementia and their family carers.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains one of the most debilitating neurodegenerative 
disorders, with its pathological hallmark being progressive cognitive decline 
and memory loss. Recent research has illuminated the crucial role of the 
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the central nervous system (CNS), 
highlighting its impact on neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and neuronal 
survival. Dysregulation of the BDNF signaling axis, particularly the imbalance 
between its precursor form and mature BDNF, is strongly implicated in the 
pathophysiology of AD. This review explores the molecular mechanisms through 
which BDNF modulates AD neuropathology and presents novel therapeutic strategies 
to activate BDNF signaling. We focus on the potential of BDNF activators, such 
as TrkB agonists and mimetic molecules, to restore synaptic function and 
ameliorate cognitive deficits in AD. Furthermore, we examine the challenges in 
translating these findings into clinical practice, including issues with 
blood-brain barrier penetration and the need for precise receptor targeting. The 
review emphasizes the therapeutic potential of repurposed drugs, including 
statins and metformin, in enhancing BDNF signaling and offers new insights into 
the future of AD treatment. Ultimately, this work provides a compelling argument 
for BDNF-based therapies as a promising avenue for mitigating the cognitive 
decline associated with Alzheimer's disease, signaling a hopeful direction for 
future research and clinical trials.

The pathophysiological mechanisms driving disease progression of frontotemporal 
lobar degeneration (FTLD) and corresponding biomarkers are not fully understood. 
Here we leveraged aptamer-based proteomics (>4,000 proteins) to identify 
dysregulated communities of co-expressed cerebrospinal fluid proteins in 116 
adults carrying autosomal dominant FTLD mutations (C9orf72, GRN and MAPT) 
compared with 39 non-carrier controls. Network analysis identified 31 protein 
co-expression modules. Proteomic signatures of genetic FTLD clinical severity 
included increased abundance of RNA splicing (particularly in C9orf72 and GRN) 
and extracellular matrix (particularly in MAPT) modules, as well as decreased 
abundance of synaptic/neuronal and autophagy modules. The generalizability of 
genetic FTLD proteomic signatures was tested and confirmed in independent 
cohorts of (1) sporadic progressive supranuclear palsy-Richardson syndrome and 
(2) frontotemporal dementia spectrum clinical syndromes. Network-based 
proteomics hold promise for identifying replicable molecular pathways in adults 
living with FTLD. 'Hub' proteins driving co-expression of affected modules 
warrant further attention as candidate biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a rare 4-repeat tauopathy that causes 
behavioural, movement and cognitive abnormalities. We genotyped all available 
clinical and histopathological PSP cases in Spain and Portugal (N = 522), and 
conducted the largest PSP GWAS of the Iberian population to date. Genetic burden 
analysis revealed reduced diagnostic specificity in clinically diagnosed 
atypical PSP cases-when applying the 2017 MDS criteria-compared to Richardson's 
syndrome cases. We independently replicated eight PSP risk variants in seven 
known loci (MAPT, MOBP, EIF2AK3, STX6, SLCO1A2, DUSP10 and APOE), and identified 
a novel locus in NFASC/CNTN2 (rs12744678 C: OR[95%CI] = 0.83[0.78-0.89]; 
p = 4.15·10-08) after meta-analysis with a newly available Dutch cohort and 
publicly available summary statistics (3,099 PSP; 11,482 controls). Enrichment 
analysis and protein expression profiling highlighted oligodendrocyte function 
and myelination as likely contributors to PSP pathogenesis. Our findings broaden 
the genetic landscape of PSP and suggest potential therapeutic avenues focused 
on modulating neuron-oligodendrocyte interactions.

Alzheimer's disease (AD)is an age-related neurodegenerative disease 
characterized by memory decline and cognitive impairment .AD is common in people 
aged > 65 years, though most of AD cases are sporadic, which accounts for 95%, 
and 1-5% of AD is caused by familial causes . The causes of AD are aging, 
environmental toxins, and cardiometabolic factors that induce the degeneration 
of cholinergic neurons. It has been shown that the metabolic syndrome which is a 
clustering of dissimilar constituents including insulin resistance (IR), glucose 
intolerance, visceral obesity, hypertension, and dyslipidemia is implicated in 
the pathogenesis of AD. Metabolic syndrome disapprovingly affects cognitive 
function and the development in AD by inducing the development of oxidative 
stress, neuroinflammation, and brain IR. These changes, together with brain IR, 
impair cerebrovascular reactivity causing cognitive impairment and dementia. 
Nevertheless, the fundamental mechanism by which metabolic syndrome persuades AD 
risk is not entirely explicated. Accordingly, this review aims to discuss the 
connotation between metabolic syndrome and AD. In conclusion, metabolic syndrome 
is regarded as a possible risk factor for the initiation of AD neuropathology by 
diverse signaling pathways such as brain IR, activation of inflammatory 
signaling pathways, neuroinflammation, defective proteostasis, and dysregulation 
of lipid mediators.

OBJECTIVES: We hypothesised that there is substantial variation in acute 
myocardial infarction (AMI) treatment across English hospitals, particularly for 
people hospitalised for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and with 
reduced kidney function. This study aimed to describe this variation at the 
hospital and the individual level to understand treatment variation and 
potential disparities in AMI management among people with reduced kidney 
function.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
SETTING: Secondary care in England.
PARTICIPANTS: People hospitalised for AMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction 
(STEMI) or NSTEMI) in English hospitals and captured in the Myocardial Ischaemia 
National Audit Project, 2014 to 2019. Kidney function was defined using 
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) derived from the serum creatinine 
recorded within 24 hours of AMI admission.
OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcome was recorded invasive cardiac intervention 
(at least one of angiography, percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary 
artery bypass graft) compared with conservative management.
RESULTS: We included 361 259 people with a first hospitalisation for AMI (STEMI 
or NSTEMI) at 209 hospitals for hospital-level analyses and 292 572 people with 
complete covariable data at 207 hospitals for individual-level analyses. We 
found substantial variation in the mean proportion of people with NSTEMI managed 
invasively across hospitals in England. At the individual level, using 
multivariable logistic regression to derive adjusted predicted probabilities to 
describe the association between kidney function and AMI management (invasive vs 
conservative management), we found that people had a lower adjusted predicted 
probability of being treated with invasive cardiac management with worsening 
eGFR range, particularly for NSTEMI cases (eGFR range 2: 76.6% (95% CI 76.3 to 
76.8) vs eGFR range 5: 44.5% (95% CI 41.2 to 47.5)).
CONCLUSIONS: There is substantial AMI treatment variation across hospitals in 
England, particularly among people hospitalised for NSTEMI with reduced kidney 
function. Further research is needed to evaluate the comparative effectiveness 
of NSTEMI management strategies for complex patients.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative disease in humans, 
has been a major medical challenge. Lactoferrin (Ltf) in salivary glands might 
be identified as a potential detectable biomarker in AD and a therapeutic target 
for AD. Pharmaceutical studies directly addressing this biomarker, though, are 
scarce. Using a computational strategy for drug repurposing, we explored the 
proximal neighborhood of Ltf by exploring its interactome and regulatory 
constellations. We aimed to focus on the discovery of potential therapeutic 
agents for AD. Based on extensive analytical evaluation comprising structural 
congruence scales, profiling disease clusters, pathway enrichment analyses as 
well as molecular docking, SPR, in vivo studies, and immunofluorescence assays, 
our research identified three candidate repurposed drugs: Lovastatin, SU-11652, 
and SB-239063. Taken together, these results highlight strong binding affinities 
of the drug candidates to Ltf. In vitro studies showed that such compounds 
decrease β-amyloid (Aβ) production by increasing the fluorescence signal emitted 
by Ltf in N2a-sw cells, and that they act by modulating the expression of 
amyloidogenic pathway-associated enzymes (BACE1 and APH1α). In addition, in vivo 
studies showed a concomitant reduction in the expression levels of amyloidogenic 
pathway-related enzymes (BACE1 or APH1α). Thus, computational studies have 
focused on Ltf interactions that may recommend drug repurposing strategies and 
options for AD.

Progestogens in Menopausal Hormone Therapy: A Double-Edged Sword.

Ylikorkala O(1), Joensuu JM(1), Siitonen H(1), Mikkola TS(1).

Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.

Progestogens (norethisterone acetate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, 
dydrogesterone, micronized progesterone, levonorgestrel, drospirenone, and 
trimegestone) added to estrogen for endometrial protection are reviewed. They 
can be given orally or vaginally, norethisterone acetate can also be given 
transdermally, and levonorgestrel can be given through the intrauterine route. 
Sequential use of progestogens protects the endometrium if exposure lasts for at 
least 12 days/month; longer intervals are not safe. Continuous use of 
progestogens, whether oral, transdermal, or intrauterine, provides the most 
effective protection. Progestogen addition is accompanied with significant 
elevations in breast cancer risk, the largest drawback of progestogen use, and 
dydrogesterone, micronized progesterone, and a levonorgestrel intrauterine 
device may be safest in this regard. Progestogens also double deep vein 
thrombosis risk and diminish the positive effect of estrogen on colorectal 
cancer and vascular health. Recent data imply a neutral effect of progestogens 
in combination with estrogen on Alzheimer's disease risk, but the risk of 
vascular dementia is decreased. In conclusion, progestogens are a double-edged 
sword, effectively protecting the endometrium but causing several side effects 
and reducing many estrogen-induced benefits. With modern endometrial diagnostic 
tools, the safety of low-dose unopposed estrogen regimens should be assessed in 
a prospective controlled trial in women with an intact uterus.

OBJECTIVES: During conversations with families of critically ill patients in 
intensive care units (ICUs), clinicians' metaphoric language use may facilitate 
families' understanding, but also has potential drawbacks. We sought to obtain 
insights regarding how ICU clinicians use metaphors regarding patients' disease 
and treatment trajectory.
METHODS: We identified clinicians' metaphor use in N=101 audio-recorded 
neonatal, pediatric, and adult ICU family conversations about life-sustaining 
treatments. Using qualitative content analyses, each metaphor's semantic domain, 
disease phase, and dialogical function were coded. Overarching themes and 
patterns were analyzed.
RESULTS: Journey metaphors (N = 140 in N = 54 conversations) most frequently 
referred to the semantic domains boundary, path and bridge. Although most 
functioned to convey clinical information (72 %), metaphors were mainly 
presented in an emotionally charged way, serving to manage families' 
perceptions. As patients' conditions deteriorated, metaphors more often 
functioned to prepare families for medical limits. Metaphors were sometimes 
potentially unclear. Others suggested high patient agency, starkly contrasting 
with patients' unconscious state.
CONCLUSIONS: Metaphors related to ICU patients' disease and treatment trajectory 
are common. They may clarify information or strengthen clinicians' arguments but 
can also cause confusion and thereby hinder decision-making.
PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Enhancing clinicians' awareness about their metaphor use 
may promote more effective information exchange and decision-making.
