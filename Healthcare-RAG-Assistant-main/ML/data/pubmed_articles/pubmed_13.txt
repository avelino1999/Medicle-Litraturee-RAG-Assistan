Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition manifesting as 
cognitive decline, memory deterioration, and behavioral alterations. Late-onset 
AD accounts for most diagnosed cases, with the onset of symptoms usually 
occurring after 65 years. At present, there are no proven treatments that alter 
the course of AD. For early detection and intervention, it is crucial to 
understand the underlying mechanisms and identify promising biomarkers for AD. 
Research suggests that the pathological processes of AD initiate years before 
the emergence of noticeable symptoms, which makes the early diagnosis more 
challenging. While various biomarkers, such as cognitive tests, imaging, and 
biological markers in blood and cerebrospinal fluid, have been proposed for 
early detection, their reliability, as matched with symptomatic stages, varies 
significantly. As a component of the central nervous system, the retina has 
attracted attention as a potential site for studying AD-related changes. Studies 
from human and animal models have revealed structural, vascular, functional, and 
metabolic changes in the retina through the early phases of AD. Furthermore, 
advances in ophthalmic technologies have facilitated the identification and 
characterization of AD-related changes such as amyloid-β and tau-protein 
deposition. This review provides an overview and perspective on AD as they 
relate to the retina and highlights the importance of ocular changes as 
surrogates for understanding and diagnosing AD.

Cases of Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease-related dementia are 
expected to triple in the next thirty years. Consequences of the disease include 
a decline in emotional well-being, which was exacerbated by the isolation 
imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. This study examined the acceptability and 
potential effects of a digital, intergenerational music intervention delivered 
by adolescent musicians on the affect and emotions of older adults living with 
dementia. The study was exploratory, followed a pre- post- test design, and had 
14 participants. Affect was examined using the Positive and Negative Affect 
Schedule and emotion was observed using the Observed Emotion Rating Scale. 
Additionally, this study assessed acceptability by asking participants about 
their willingness to continue and gathering qualitative feedback in focus 
groups. Results showed an increase in positive affect and positive trends in 
duration of sustained pleasure and alertness, as well as a high percentage of 
willingness to continue and positive feedback. Digital, intergenerational music 
is a promising intervention to continue examining in future studies.

Neurological and psychiatric diseases pose a considerable global burden. 
Exploring additional potential prevention strategies and therapies is ongoing. 
As a prevalent natural product and nutraceutical from food, betaine's 
pharmaceutical applications suggest benefits for both health and disease in 
multiple organs. Recently, its efficacy on neurological and psychiatric health 
has been proposed and has drawn considerable attention. This review aims to 
provide an updated, critical, and comprehensive profile of the promising 
medicinal roles of betaine in these diseases. In addition to its well-known 
osmotic protection, due to methyl donation, it regulates metabolism, alleviates 
oxidative stress, and reduces inflammation. To manifest neurological and 
psychiatric health benefits, betaine acts by affecting gamma-aminobutyric acid 
associated with its transporters, related neurotransmitters, downstream and 
neurological pathways, and other specific mechanisms in the nervous system. 
Betaine demonstrates therapeutic potential against various neurological and 
psychiatric diseases, such as epilepsy, neurocognitive disorders (including 
Alzheimer's disease), Parkinson's disease, stroke, multiple sclerosis, traumatic 
brain injury, depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, 
sleep disorders, fetal alcohol syndrome, syringomyelia, neonatal brain injury, 
neuropathic pain, and motor dysfunction. Despite the promising role of betaine 
in the treatment, diagnosis, and prevention of neuropsychiatric disorders, much 
of the present evidence appears to be fragmentary. Further studies elucidating 
the underlying mechanisms and direct clinical applications are required to 
obtain a deeper understanding of betaine and its underutilized potential. 
Overall, this review highlights the potential of betaine as a promising agent 
with benefits for neurological and psychiatric diseases, aiming to offer clues 
to advance this field.

University, Makkah, Saudi Arabia.

Sleep disturbances are prevalent and commonly associated with Alzheimer disease 
(AD) and other forms of dementia, significantly impacting the quality of life 
for patients and their caregivers. These disturbances not only exacerbate 
cognitive decline but also contribute to the overall progression of 
neurodegenerative diseases. This review highlights the importance of managing 
sleep disturbances in patients with AD and dementia by analyzing completed 
clinical trials on this topic. A comprehensive search of the ClinicalTrials.gov 
database was performed on July 21, 2024, to identify all relevant clinical 
trials evaluating the efficacy of interventions for managing sleep disturbances 
in this population. Trials were included if they focused specifically on 
interventions for sleep disturbances in patients diagnosed with AD or dementia, 
were completed, and had results available. A total of 9 interventional and 
completed clinical trials related to sleep disturbance and AD were identified, 
involving 1139 participants. Three of the studies were nonpharmacological 
interventions, while 6 were pharmacological. Four studies were phase 2 clinical 
trials, and 1 was phase 3; the remaining were categorized as nonpharmacological. 
All studies were completed and had reported results. This review identifies a 
limited number of clinical trials addressing sleep disturbances in AD and 
dementia using either pharmacological or nonpharmacological interventions. 
Further clinical trials are recommended due to the impact of sleep disturbances 
on the quality of life for both patients and caregivers.

Lewy body dementia (LBD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a 
combination of progressive dementia and spontaneous parkinsonian symptoms. As 
the second most prevalent form of neurodegenerative dementia after Alzheimer’s 
disease (AD), LBD necessitates a deeper understanding of its pathogenesis to 
enable the development of targeted therapeutic interventions. While numerous 
reviews focus on documenting the clinical manifestations and therapeutic 
modalities for LBD, animal models provide valuable insights into the underlying 
mechanisms and potential therapeutic strategies. In this review, we 
systematically analyze the hallmarks of LBD pathogenesis, genetic risk factors, 
clinical features, and treatment strategies. Importantly, we emphasize and 
critically evaluate the pivotal role of animal models in LBD research in 
advancing our understanding of this disorder, offering a comprehensive framework 
to elucidate the interactions among misfolded proteins and their role in LBD 
pathogenesis. Our review proposes new directions for LBD therapeutic management 
and facilitates the development of innovative pharmacological interventions.

INTRODUCTION: Metabolic acidosis may create a pathway to cognitive impairment in 
chronic kidney disease (CKD) by contributing to cerebrovascular dysfunction. 
Trials examining the effect of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) on cognitive function 
are lacking.
METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study 
examining the effect of 12 months of NaHCO3 on cognitive function in 34 patients 
aged 50-80 years with CKD stage 3b-4 (eGFR 15-44 ml/min/1.73m2) with metabolic 
acidosis (serum bicarbonate level 16-22 mEq/L). Participants were randomized 1:1 
to NaHCO3 or placebo. The primary endpoint was change in overall cognition 
(Cognitive Function Composite score) assessed by the NIH Toolbox® Cognition 
Battery over 12 months. Secondary endpoints were change in cerebrovascular 
reactivity and pulsatility of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) assessed by 
Transcranial Doppler Ultrasonography over 12 months.
RESULTS: 33 patients completed the study. After 12 months of treatment with 
NaHCO3 therapy, the Cognitive Function Composite score increased significantly 
from baseline (mean ± SD, 47.3 ± 8.5 to 49.3 ± 11.0, p = 0.03), however, there 
was no difference compared to placebo (p = 0.39). NaHCO3 therapy resulted in a 
significant reduction in time to perform the Trail Making Test-A (median [IQR], 
31.3 [27.0, 36.3] to 29.0 [19.4, 38.2] seconds, p = 0.02), however there was no 
difference compared to placebo (p = 0.29). After 12 months of treatment, there 
was a significant increase in resting pulsatility index of the MCA in the 
placebo group, but there were no statistical differences between groups 
(p = 0.71). NaHCO3 treatment resulted in a significant decrease in baseline mean 
blood flow velocity of the MCA (p = 0.03), but there was no difference from 
placebo (p = 0.11).
CONCLUSIONS: Although there were trends supporting a role for sodium bicarbonate 
in having an effect on cognitive function, this was not significant in this 
underpowered study. A larger study is recommended.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by cognitive decline, 
amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulation, and tau hyperphosphorylation. Effective 
therapies remain limited; therefore, recent studies have explored microRNAs as 
potential therapeutic targets.
METHODS: miR-4536-3p inhibition was investigated using in vitro (SH-SY5Y cells) 
and in vivo (5xFAD mouse) AD models. Apoptosis, neuronal markers, and signaling 
pathways were assessed through functional assays. Cognitive effects were 
evaluated via the Morris water maze.
RESULTS: miR-4536-3p inhibition increased an expression of Drebrin1 (DBN1), a 
key regulator of synaptic plasticity, but it reduced Aβ deposition, tau 
phosphorylation, and apoptosis. The treatment improved neuronal marker levels 
and significantly enhanced the spatial learning and memory of 5xFAD mice. 
Mechanistically, miR-4536-3p inhibition activated the PI3K/Akt/GSK3β signaling 
pathway, suppressing apoptosis and mitigating AD pathology.
CONCLUSION: miR-4536-3p inhibition offers a promising therapeutic strategy for 
AD by restoring the DBN1 expression, reducing neurodegeneration, and improving 
cognitive outcomes through PI3K/Akt pathway modulation.

Cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) is the most common cause of vascular 
cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) and highly associated with Alzheimer's 
disease pathogenesis. There is an urgent need to establish relevant animal 
models for cSVD. As aging is the strongest risk factor for these diseases, 
cerebrovascular senescence is implicated in cSVD pathogenesis. We investigated 
how AAV-based expression of senescence marker CDKN2A/p16INK4A in cerebrovascular 
endothelial cells influences cSVD phenotypes in adult wild-type mice. A single 
intraperitoneal injection of the AAV carrying CDKN2A/p16INK4A caused blood-brain 
barrier impairments, neurovascular uncoupling, and reduction of cerebral blood 
flow, accompanied with behavioral changes in mice. While single cell 
RNA-sequencing and immunostaining revealed the upregulation of VCAM1 in 
cerebrovascular endothelial cells, in vivo two-photon excitation microscopy 
detected aggravated leukocyte adhesions to capillaries. Our findings demonstrate 
the contributions of p16INK4A in cerebrovascular endothelial cells to cSVD and 
VCID pathogenesis through new mouse model.

BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a clinical stage between the 
expected cognitive decline of healthy ageing and dementia. People with MCI 
experience functional decline, social isolation and emotional symptoms that may 
increase suicidal thoughts and behaviours (STB). We aimed to explore the 
relationship between MCI and STB, as well as clinical and socioeconomic factors 
that may contribute to it.
METHODS: To achieve our aims we carried out a comprensive systematic review of 
the existing scientific literature. We searched the following electronic 
databases up to June 2024: PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Web Of Science 
(WOS) and EMBASE. We employed the Cochrane Risk of Bias In Non-randomized 
Studies - of Exposure (ROBINS-E) and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to assess the 
quality of the eligible studies.
RESULTS: An initial search retrieved 1,176 publications; however, only 11 
studies met eligibility criteria to be included in the final analysis. The 
quality of these studies ranged from 3 to 8 out of a maximum score of 9 in the 
Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, with a median score of 6. People with a formal diagnosis 
of MCI showed a higher prevalence of STB than those without such condition or 
with a more severe cognitive impairment. Comorbid psychiatric disorders, such as 
depression, other health problems, such as cardiovascular diseases, and a low 
socioeconomic status and/or poor educational background seemed to contribute to 
suicide risk in people with MCI.
CONCLUSION: Our systematic review suggests that people suffering MCI may be at 
an increased risk of presenting STB. Suicide prevention programmes for older 
populations with MCI should advocate for integrated health and social care 
models to tackle the clinical and social burden of suffering MCI.

OBJECTIVE: Amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregates have been recognized as therapeutic targets 
for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Targeted alpha therapy (TAT) using α-particles has 
the potential to be applied as a novel treatment approach for AD by reducing the 
quantity of Aβ aggregates. In this study, we developed a novel 
astatine-211-labeled pyridyl benzofuran (PBF) derivative, [211At]APBF-2, as a 
small molecule-based Aβ-TAT agent and evaluated its potential for in vivo use.
METHODS: [211At]APBF-2 was synthesized in a one-step astatination process using 
the tributyltin precursor. In the Aβ aggregation inhibition assay, [211At]APBF-2 
was added to a sample containing Aβ1-42 monomers and thioflavin-T (ThT) and the 
mixture was incubated for 24 h. The quantity of Aβ aggregates was evaluated by 
measuring ThT fluorescence intensity. The biodistribution of [211At]APBF-2 
(25 kBq/100 μL) was evaluated using ddY mice (n = 5).
RESULTS: [211At]APBF-2 was synthesized in radiochemical yield of 57% with a 
radiochemical purity of over 95%. In the in vitro assay, [211At]APBF-2 showed a 
dose-dependent decrease in ThT fluorescence intensity, suggesting the ability of 
[211At]APBF-2 to inhibit Aβ aggregation. In the biodistribution study using 
normal mice, the initial brain uptake of [211At]APBF-2 was observed (2.95% 
injected dose/g at 2 min), demonstrating favorable Blood-brain barrier 
permeability.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest the feasibility of using [211At]APBF-2 as an 
Aβ-TAT agent for in vivo applications.

BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a modifiable risk factor for dementia, potentially 
influencing Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Understanding this relationship 
is essential for developing interventions to reduce dementia risk.
OBJECTIVES: We investigated cross-sectional and longitudinal associations 
between blood pressure and AD biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and 
amyloid (Aβ) positron emission tomography (PET) in cognitively unimpaired 
adults.
DESIGN: Prospective observational study.
SETTING: We analyzed data from cognitively unimpaired participants from three 
observational prospective European studies: ALFA+ (NCT02485730), EPAD-LCS 
(NCT02804789), and AMYPAD PNHS (EudraCT: 2018-002,277-22).
MEASUREMENTS: ALFA+ participants had either CSF biomarkers (CSF Aβ42, Aβ40, 
p-tau181, t-tau) and/or Aβ PET data. EPAD participants had CSF biomarkers (CSF 
Aβ42, p-tau181, t-tau), and AMYPAD participants had Aβ PET data. All 
participants had available data about diabetes, use of hypertensive medication, 
and waist-to-hip ratio. Multivariable linear regression models were used to 
analyze cross-sectional associations between systolic blood pressure (SBP), 
diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and pulse pressure (PP) with CSF biomarkers or 
Aβ PET (Centiloid units, CL); longitudinal associations were tested by means of 
delta CL scores between baseline and follow-up to assess Aβ PET changes over 
time.
RESULTS: We included 405 participants from ALFA+ (mean age 61.1 years; 60 % 
female), 1104 from EPAD (mean age 64.8 years; 59.1 % female), and 340 from 
AMYPAD (mean age 71.8 years; 60 % female). In ALFA+, DBP was negatively 
associated with CSF Aβ40 (p = 0.016) and p-tau181 (p = 0.050), while there was a 
non-significant trend towards a positive association between SBP and CL over 
time (p = 0.058). In EPAD, DBP was negatively associated with CSF Aβ42 (p < 
0.001) and p-tau181 (p = 0.014), while PP was positively associated with CSF 
Aβ42 (p = 0.024). In AMYPAD, SBP (p = 0.002) and PP (p = 0.003) were positively 
associated with CL at baseline, with a similar non-significant trend being found 
for DBP (p = 0.089). Higher DBP (p = 0.042) was significantly associated to 
increased CL over time, with a similar non-significant trend being found for SBP 
(p = 0.072). We did not find significant associations between blood pressure and 
longitudinal changes in CSF biomarkers.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated blood pressure was associated with increased Aβ PET 
accumulation in cognitively unimpaired individuals. Further research is 
warranted to elucidate potential mechanisms underlying the negative associations 
between DBP and CSF biomarkers, which do not reflect the typical AD molecular 
signature. These findings highlight the relevance of high blood pressure as a 
potential risk factor for cognitive decline.

The human gastrointestinal tract harbors a vast and diverse microbial community, 
with the gut microbiome playing a fundamental role in numerous biological 
processes that influence overall health and disease progression. Emerging 
evidence has identified bacterial lipopolysaccharides in the hippocampus of 
patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), highlighting the intricate relationship 
between the gastrointestinal tract, gut microbiome, and the central and enteric 
nervous systems-commonly referred to as the "microbiota-gut-brain axis." In this 
review, we explore the mechanisms by which the microbiota-gut-brain axis 
contributes to AD pathogenesis. We propose that sufficient levels of all-trans 
retinoic acid (ATRA), the bioactive form of vitamin A, enhance intestinal 
barrier integrity by upregulating tight junction proteins and modulating immune 
function through the induction of regulatory T-cell differentiation, thereby 
mitigating inflammation. Furthermore, dietary fiber complements this process by 
promoting the production of short-chain fatty acids, such as butyrate, via 
bacterial fermentation. Butyrate, in turn, acts as a histone deacetylase 
inhibitor, upregulating ATRA bioavailability by elevating aldehyde dehydrogenase 
gene expression. Our mechanistic framework is supported by the endotoxin 
hypothesis of AD, which maintains that the movement of infectious pathogens 
across the blood-brain barrier causes a vicious cycle of inflammation, a key 
factor of AD pathogenesis, leading to amyloid-β deposition, microglial 
activation, and CYP26A1-mediated ATRA degradation. Finally, we discuss 
microbiome-based therapeutic strategies and dietary interventions, including 
prebiotic compounds, probiotic bacteria, fecal microbiota transplantation, the 
Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet, and a 
combined approach featuring vitamins A/D and dietary fiber, as potential 
approaches to prevent progression to AD via the microbiota-gut-brain axis.

Huo-Luo-Xiao-Ling-Dan (HLXLD), a Chinese herbal medicine consisting of 11 herbs, 
has been shown to be effective in alleviating cognitive and memory impairment in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the underlying mechanisms require further 
investigation. This study aimed to clarify potential therapeutic mechanisms of 
HLXLD in the treatment of AD from a metabolic perspective. A rat model of AD 
induced by AlCl3 and D-gal was established, the Morris water maze (MWM) test and 
hippocampal histopathology were used to evaluate the pharmacological effect of 
the HLXLD on AD. Subsequently, untargeted metabolomics of brain tissues samples 
was performed by UHPLC-Q-Exactive-Orbitrap-MS, followed by multivariate 
statistical analysis. Targeted metabolomics by UHPLC-QQQ-MS was further employed 
to validate and supplement the untargeted metabolomics finding, involving 
neurotransmitters, amino acids, arachidonic acid and lipids, to elucidate the 
relationship between disease, herbal medicine and metabolism pathway. The study 
found that HLXLD could relieve the progression of AD and regulate metabolic 
imbalances. The levels of 26 metabolites decreased and 6 increased in brain 
tissues including lysine, taurine, fumaric acid, prostaglandin E2, choline and 
so on, these altered metabolites were primarily associated with amino acid 
metabolism, TCA cycle, arachidonic acid metabolism and lipid metabolism. The 
targeted metabolomics results showed that compared with the model group, the 
levels of 8 neurotransmitters, 21 amino acids, 7 arachidonic acids and 16 lipids 
in brain tissue, 9 neurotransmitters, 20 amino acids, 6 arachidonic acids and 2 
lipids in plasma were changed. In summary, HLXLD could improve the levels of 
endogenous metabolites by regulating multiple metabolic pathways and play a role 
in energy supply, anti-neuroinflammatory and neuroprotective effects in AD 
treatment.

Emerging evidence is challenging the long-standing notion that Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) is caused by increased γ-secretase function and overproduction of 
42-amino acid amyloid-beta (Aβ42). Cerebrospinal fluid levels of soluble 
monomeric Aβ42 in AD are reduced to about half of those in healthy individuals 
and drop even further at dementia onset in genetic forms (APP, PSEN1, PSEN2 
mutations) and in Down's syndrome. Findings supporting a revised AD 
pathophysiology include: (1) ∼90% of pathogenic PSEN1 mutations reduce 
γ-secretase activity and Aβ42 production; (2) lower γ-secretase activity is 
correlated with lower soluble Aβ42 levels, earlier onset of dementia, worse 
cognition, and faster progression; (3) higher soluble Aβ42 levels associate with 
preserved cognition and delayed dementia in amyloid-positive sporadic and 
familial AD; (4) apparent cognitive benefits from anti-amyloid monoclonal 
antibodies may involve increased soluble Aβ42 levels; and (5) monomeric Aβ42 
supports memory and other functions akin to a neuropeptide. These findings 
suggest that restoring, not reducing, γ-secretase activity and monomeric Aβ42 
levels above a compensation threshold could offer disease-modifying therapeutic 
benefits. Drugs that increase soluble Aβ42, some already approved for other 
indications and linked to reduced dementia risk, may be repurposed to test 
whether they can slow disease progression in familial and sporadic AD.

INTRODUCTION: Excessive alcohol use (EAU) elevates the risk of dementia through 
various mechanisms, yet its impact on the behavioural and psychological symptoms 
of dementia (BPSDs) remains uncertain.
METHODS: In this exploratory cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from the 
Standardizing Care for Neuropsychiatric Symptoms and Quality of Life in Dementia 
(StaN) study (ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT03672201), we included individuals with 
Alzheimer's disease and related dementias requiring BPSD treatment. We compared 
demographic characteristics and presentation of BPSDs (using the total and 
domain scores on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Clinician) in those with and 
without a lifetime history of EAU.
RESULTS: Among 193 participants [mean (SD) age: 80.6 (9.7) years, male: 48.4%], 
those in the EAU group (n = 17) and in the comparator group (n = 176) had severe 
and comparable cognitive impairment, with a median Functional Assessment Staging 
Tool for Dementia score of 6e. Participants with EAU were significantly younger 
than comparators [mean age (SD): 72.9 (7.1) years vs. 81.4 (9.5) years] 
(t = -3.678, df = 181, P < .001), and were more frequently male (76.5% [13 of 
17] vs. 46.6% [82 of 176]; P = .036). In a sensitivity analysis, there were no 
differences in the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Clinician total or individual 
domain scores between those with EAU and a subsample of those without EAU 
matched for age, sex, and recruitment site.
CONCLUSION: This exploratory study found that among individuals with Alzheimer's 
disease and related dementias and BPSDs, lifetime history of EAU is more 
frequent in younger males. Future studies may further examine the impact of EAU 
in individuals with BPSDs.

This study provided a preliminary examination of indices of obstructive sleep 
apnea (OSA) and sleep disruptions in adults with Down syndrome (DS), and their 
associations with Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology and symptomatology. 
Ninety-three adults with DS (aged 25-61 years) from the Alzheimer Biomarker 
Consortium - Down Syndrome completed cognitive assessments, MRI and PET scans 
(assessing amyloid-beta [Aβ] and tau), and a one-night home sleep study using 
the WatchPAT-300 device. Study partners also reported on depressive symptoms and 
diagnoses. Correlational analyses examined relationships between sleep 
variables, PET biomarkers, and AD symptomatology (cognitive functioning and 
depressive mood), controlling for sociodemographics. Eighty-one participants 
(87%) completed valid WatchPAT data. Of these, 60 (74%) screened positive for 
OSA, and an additional 11 had a prior OSA diagnosis and used CPAP during the 
test night. Nearly half (45%) of those screening positive for OSA had no prior 
diagnosis, indicating under-detection. Among the 22 participants using OSA 
treatment, 50% continued to show sleep-disordered breathing, suggesting 
suboptimal treatment effectiveness. Higher wake percentage and shorter total 
sleep time were associated with greater Aβ and tau burden. Cognitive performance 
was negatively associated with wake percentage, total sleep time, and 
oxygenation indices (minimum oxygen, desaturation, and time ≤ 88% oxygen). 
Depressive symptoms were negatively related to total sleep time. These findings 
add preliminary evidence linking sleep disruption and OSA with AD-related 
pathology and symptomatology. Larger, longitudinal studies are needed to confirm 
these associations and evaluate whether improving sleep quality and treating OSA 
may help delay AD onset in this high-risk population.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Persons living with dementia often rely upon a care 
partner as their surrogate medical decision maker, yet little is known about how 
dementia care dyads achieve advance care planning (ACP) concordance: when a care 
partner fully understands a care recipient's values and preferences as best they 
can. Examining data from a pilot study of the online Life-planning in Early 
Alzheimer's and other Dementias (LEAD) intervention to better understand how 
dyads achieve perceived ACP concordance, we hypothesized that: (1) engaging in 
ACP was associated with perceived ACP concordance, (2) perceived ACP concordance 
was associated with interpersonal connectedness, and (3) engaging in ACP was 
associated with interpersonal connectedness.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Dyads completed the LEAD intervention and answered 
open-ended survey questions. After aggregating data supporting and or not 
supporting each hypothesis, process codes and subcodes were used to identify the 
elements involved in each supported hypothesis (Cohen's Kappa .65-.82).
RESULTS: N = 48 community-based dyads completed the LEAD intervention, with 
N = 43 answering open-ended questions. Care recipients averaged 65.1 years of 
age (SD =14.8); care partners averaged 54.9 years (SD = 14.6) and were primarily 
spouses (n = 32, 66.7%) or children (n = 12, 25.0%). Engaging in ACP was 
associated with higher interpersonal connectedness and with perceived ACP 
concordance. Perceived ACP concordance was not associated with higher 
interpersonal connectedness.
DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: These findings suggest that clinicians should focus 
on facilitating ACP discussions with dyads, as these conversations appear 
crucial for fostering understanding and agreement between dyad members, 
ultimately leading to perceived ACP concordance.

Comorbid pathologies and their impact on progressive supranuclear palsy: current 
view.

Progressive supranuclear palsy, a four-repeat tauopathy, is clinically 
characterized by early postural instability and falls, vertical supranuclear 
palsy, levodopa poorly-responsive parkinsonism, pseudobulbar palsy, and 
cognitive impairment. It is morphologically featured by accumulation of 
hyperphosphorylated tau protein in neurons and glia predominantly in the basal 
ganglia, brainstem tegmentum and frontal cortex, associated with degeneration of 
the extrapyramidal system and cortical atrophy. Isolated PSP neuropathology is 
uncommon, with nearly 70% showing co-neuropathologies including Alzheimer-type, 
Lewy body, TDP-43 pathologies, argyrophilic grains, and other tauopathies and 
neurodegenerative disorders (Parkinson disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). 
The most common comorbid conditions are hypertension, cardiovascular and 
cerebrovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, polyneuropathies, muscular and 
urological disorders. Due the increased prevalence of comorbidities and their 
eminent impact on the progress and outcome of the disease, clinical trials 
should account for them in their design and selection. However, currently little 
is known about co-pathologies in these patients. In view of the eminent burden 
of comorbidities and resulting therapeutic consequences, the frequency of the 
different co-pathologies in PSP and their clinical impact will be discussed. It 
should provide insight into their pathogenic backgrounds as a basis for adequate 
treatment procedures to improve the quality of life of patients with this fatal 
disease.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques, tau tangles, and neuroinflammation, 
with emerging evidence highlighting a potential role for brain lymphatic 
dysfunction. Lymphovenous anastomosis (LVA), a microsurgical technique 
traditionally used in lymphedema management, offers a novel solution to enhance 
brain metabolite clearance by bypassing impaired lymphatic pathways and 
enhancing glymphatic outflow. By connecting lymphatic vessels to veins, LVA 
compensates for aging-related declines in lymphatic/glymphatic flow, with 
preliminary studies supporting this theory. This review evaluates the 
feasibility of LVA, emphasizing key anatomical targets such as cervical 
lymphatic vessels, while proposing robust patient selection criteria. It also 
aims to address the controversies in outcome measures including advanced 
imaging, biomarker analysis, and cognitive assessments. While early findings are 
promising, further research is essential to optimize surgical protocols, clarify 
biological mechanisms, and ensure safety. LVA represents a novel therapeutic 
strategy that may complement existing treatments, offering new hope for 
addressing the inevitable outcome of AD.

Endogenous Pigment Mimicking Engineered Nanovesicle Targets Extrasynaptic NMDA 
Receptors against Ca(2+)-Mediated Excitotoxicity in Alzheimer's Disease.

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), deposition of toxic Aβ42 oligomers causes excessive 
internalization of 2A subunit dominant NMDA receptors (GluN2A subtype) from the 
synaptic region. This causes a significant reduction of the synaptic glutamate 
interaction site. The absence of GluN2A propagates spillage of glutamate to the 
extrasynaptic space, where it interacts with the 2B subunit dominant NMDA 
receptor (GluN2B subtype). This interaction causes excessive Ca2+ influx and 
perturbation of autophagy, thus disrupting mitochondrial membrane potential and 
producing reactive oxygen species, causing neuronal death. In this context, our 
hypothesis suggests that selective inhibition of extrasynaptic GluN2B receptors 
could produce multifaceted outcomes against AD. Our aim is to devise a 
neuromelanin mimicking nanovesicle, particularly targeting extrasynaptic GluN2B. 
A conceptualized nanovesicle is designed to be larger than the synaptic cleft 
space (>100 nm) with the decoration of novel GluN2B targeting peptides. 
Therefore, we envision that this engineered nanomaterial will only inhibit the 
extrasynaptic GluN2B-mediated Ca2+ excitotoxicity and also revive homeostatic 
autophagy.

BACKGROUND: Individuals with mild anomia often have difficulty finding words 
during conversations, even when they get normal results on standard language 
evaluations. The high frequency and familiarity of target objects may lead to 
the insensitivity of some naming assessments, complicating diagnosis. This study 
aims to adapt the Test de dénomination de Québec-30 images (TDQ-30) into 
Turkish, develop normative data adapted to the Turkish population, and determine 
its validity in Turkish-speaking patients.
METHODS: Data were collected from a total of 464 participants (414 healthy 
controls, 25 with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 25 with mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI)) by using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Boston 
Naming Test (BNT), Detection Test for Language Impairments in Adults and the 
Aged-Turkish version (DTLA-Tr), and Test de dénomination de Québec-30-Turkish 
version (TDQ-30 Tr).
RESULTS: In Study 1, TDQ-30 was translated into Turkish and checked for cultural 
appropriateness for the Turkish community. In study 2, the adapted version, 
TDQ-30 tr, was applied to 414 healthy adults and elderly individuals to 
establish normative data for the test. In study 3, the analyses made known the 
validity of TDQ-30 Tr, and it was found that TDQ-30 can differentiate between 
healthy participants and those with AD and MCI, with healthy participants 
showing better results.
CONCLUSION: In summary, the TDQ-30 Tr is an effective and dependable tool for 
identifying mild anomia associated with neurological impairments in 
Turkish-speaking adults and the elderly. Its ease of use makes it a vital 
instrument for improving evaluation tools in research and clinical settings in 
Turkey.

Caregiving for family members with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias 
(ADRD) places significant burden on family members, leaving them at risk for a 
variety of mental and physical issues. While engaging in sufficient respite is 
generally considered an important resiliency factor for caregivers, recent 
research has demonstrated that caregivers are not satisfied with their respite 
and are not gaining much benefit during the limited respite time available to 
them.
OBJECTIVES: The current study examines whether goal-oriented respite planning, 
facilitated by a mobile intervention, can improve caregivers' subjective 
experience of their respite time-use.
METHOD: Caregivers (N = 85) used a mobile intervention to help them plan and 
evaluate their weekly respite time-use. Ecological Momentary assessments 
(weekly) monitored number of respite hours, respite goal achievement, and 
subjective assessment of their respite experience.
RESULTS: Respite goal achievement on a given week predicted improvements in 
participants' ratings of their respite time-use outcomes one week later. 
Specifically, one week after reporting improved respite goal achievement, 
caregivers' ratings on happiness with their respite activities, feeling that 
their respite made them a better caregiver, and feeling like they had enough 
respite all increased. These effects were independent of the number of respite 
hours they reported per week.
DISCUSSION: Engaging in weekly goal-setting and goal-review activities is 
associated with caregivers' subjective evaluation of their respite time-use. 
Interventions that help caregivers implement goal setting and achievement into 
their daily lives would likely benefit subjective evaluations and experiences 
with respite.

With the sustained growth of the economy and significant changes in social 
demographics, the issue of elderly-related diseases has increasingly drawn 
attention, particularly. Alzheimer's disease (AD), as a representative disease 
of neurodegenerative diseases, has become a major challenge, affecting the 
health and quality of life of the elderly population severely. In recent years, 
the incidence, prevalence and mortality rates of AD have increased in China, 
imposing substantial economic burdens on families, society and the entire 
healthcare system. To proactively address this challenge and respond to the 
national 'Healthy China Action' initiative, leading experts from authoritative 
institutions jointly authored the China Alzheimer Report 2025. Building on 
previous editions, this report updates epidemiological data on AD in China, 
thoroughly analyses the latest economic burdens of the disease and 
comprehensively evaluates the current status of AD diagnosis and treatment 
services, as well as the allocation of public health resources in our country. 
Its release reflects China's progress in AD research and prevention, underscores 
societal concern for elderly health and aims to provide scientific guidance and 
data support for AD prevention, diagnosis and treatment. It also facilitates 
academic exchanges and cooperation, enhancing public awareness and promoting 
active participation in elderly healthcare, towards achieving 'healthy ageing' 
in China.

Sex differences in cognitive reserve might contribute to females being 
disproportionately affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD). We investigated sex 
differences in the protective effects of cognitive reserve, and whether brain 
beta-amyloid accounts for differences. Older adults (n = 997 from the Australian 
Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle Study of Ageing) diagnosed as Cognitively 
Normal, Mild Cognitive Impairment, or AD at baseline were assessed every 
18 months for up to a maximum of seven visits. Cognitive reserve was calculated 
from the variance in episodic memory not explained by demographic or brain 
measures. Executive functioning (EF) intercept and slope were regressed onto the 
main and interaction effects of cognitive reserve x brain integrity x sex, plus 
covariates (age, number of APOE ε4 alleles). A three-way interaction was 
observed between cognitive reserve, brain integrity, and sex on the EF slope. 
Females benefitted more than males from the protective effects of cognitive 
reserve at low levels of brain integrity. Sex differences in the protective 
effect of cognitive reserve were not moderated by brain beta-amyloid burden.

Because of their biological qualities, the leaves of Diospyros kaki L., also 
known as persimmon, have long been used in traditional Chinese medicine for the 
treatment of ischemic stroke, angina, internal hemorrhage, hypertension, 
atherosclerosis, and some infectious diseases. It has also been used in 
cosmetics, as well as in refreshing drink preparations. In the present study, we 
have compared the aqueous extract effects of the leaves of the three Tunisian 
varieties of D. kaki, namely Triumph, Jiro, and Rojo Brillante, prepared by 
decoction and then filtered. The obtained filtrates were lyophilized and kept 
cold until analysis. Phytochemical profile and biological activities were 
performed on the freeze-dried fractions of the different varieties of D. kaki. 
Analysis of the results shows that the leaf extracts of the three varieties are 
rich in total phenols and flavonoids (ranking: Rojo Brillante > Triumph > Jiro) 
and have a high antioxidant activity (EC50 values of 3.8, 8.0 and 12.1 μg/mL 
respectively for Rojo Brillante, Triumph and Jiro). Using a quadrupole 
time-of-flight interface and high-resolution tandem liquid chromatography, 29 
secondary metabolites of D. kaki leaf decoctions were identified in the three 
varieties, including several polyphenols such as flavonoids, tannins, organic 
acids, and others. In addition, these extracts were found to inhibit the 
function of two key enzymes, acetylcholinesterase (IC50 values of 58, 96 and 
210 μg/mL respectively for Rojo Brillante, Triumph and Jiro) and inhibition 
percentages of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase were 61.44%, 57.35%, and 
46.28% for Jiro, Triumph, and Rojo Brillante, respectively. However, we noted 
that these different extracts had no cytotoxic effect on human liver or breast 
cancer cells in culture until 10 μg/mL. The results reveal that the D. kaki 
leaves are a potential matrix for the launch of future nutraceuticals, 
cosmetics, and pharmaceutical specialties such as drugs to combat Alzheimer's 
disease or to reduce cholesterol levels, as well as an attractive source of 
ingredients beneficial to health. Comparative analysis of D. kaki leaves showed 
that the Rojo Brillante variety has a higher content of secondary metabolites 
than the other two varieties, thus increasing its antioxidant activity and 
enzyme inhibitory effect, although it is not as cytotoxic as the other two 
varieties.

OBJECTIVE: The present study aims to analyze the clinical manifestations, 
laboratory results, neuroimaging features, treatment interventions, and outcomes 
in a cohort of patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy-related inflammation 
(CAA-ri), providing a deeper understanding of this rare subtype of CAA and 
enhancing diagnostic precision in clinical practice.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic retrospective review of clinical records from 
13 consecutive patients who met the diagnostic criteria for probable CAA-ri and 
were evaluated at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University between 
January 2021 and August 2024.
RESULTS: The study cohort comprised 13 patients (7 males, 6 females; mean age 
65.2 years, range 42-81), predominantly presenting with subacute onset (53.8%, 
n=7). Cognitive impairment (61.5%, n=8) emerged as the most frequent clinical 
manifestation, followed by headache (46.2%, n=6), epileptic seizures (30.8%, 
n=4), and focal neurological deficits (23.1%, n=3). Neuroimaging findings across 
all patients demonstrated asymmetric white matter hyperintensities in 
conjunction with cortical-subcortical cerebral microbleeds. A subset of patients 
exhibited cortical superficial siderosis lobar hemorrhage, and/or punctate acute 
infarction. Among the nine patients who underwent lumbar puncture, five showed 
elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure and protein levels. All four 
patients assessed for CSF Alzheimer's disease biomarkers showed reduced Aβ42 and 
Aβ40 levels, alongside elevated total tau and phosphorylated tau levels. 
Furthermore, over 70% of the patients who treated with immunosuppressive therapy 
achieved favorable clinical outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Clinical manifestations and neuroimaging abnormalities serve as 
pivotal non-invasive criteria for guiding clinicians in the diagnosis of CAA-ri. 
Timely initiation of immunosuppressive therapy in CAA-ri patients can lead to 
favorable outcomes.

Alzheimer's disease affects 6.9 million Americans aged 65 and older, a number 
expected to double by 2060. Eight FDA-approved drugs target Alzheimer's, but no 
cure is available, and most treatments are symptomatic. Drug repurposing, the 
use of FDA-approved drugs for new indications, is a promising strategy to 
address this lack of effective therapies. However, despite prior safety 
approval, repurposable drugs may still trigger unexpected side-effects in new 
contexts. This study introduces a network-based approach to minimize side-effect 
risk in drug repositioning, focusing on QT interval prolongation, a cardiac 
side-effect observed in Alzheimer's patients treated with acetylcholinesterase 
inhibitors. The method integrates Mode-of-Action and Random Walk with Restart 
analyses to identify repositioning candidates while assessing QT-related risk. 
This strategy identified promising compounds including acamprosate, tolcapone, 
sitagliptin, and diazoxide, with potential to mitigate disease pathology. Gene 
set enrichment analysis was used to computationally assess the compounds' 
ability to reverse disease-related gene expression signatures.

Chronic stress is a major risk factor for neuropsychiatric disorders, acting via 
increased neuroinflammation and disrupted synaptic plasticity. While 
non-invasive visual or audiovisual neurostimulation (AV flicker) at 40Hz has 
been shown to modulate brain immune signaling and improve cognitive performance 
in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease, its effects in the context of stress 
remain unknown. Here we show that AV flicker protects against stress-induced 
behavioral, microglial, astrocytic, and synaptic changes in a sex- and 
frequency-specific manner. Male and female mice underwent 28 days of chronic 
unpredictable stress with concomitant daily AV flicker exposure at 10Hz, 20Hz, 
or 40Hz. Stress-induced behaviors were most effectively mitigated by 10Hz AV 
flicker in males and 40Hz AV flicker in females. In the medial prefrontal 
cortex, AV flicker normalized the balance of mature and immature dendritic 
spines and counteracted stress-induced molecular changes in neurons, microglia, 
and astrocytes, including in key neuropsychiatric risk genes. These findings 
show that frequency optimized AV flicker induces resilience to chronic stress.

The CSF1R inhibitor PLX3397, an FDA-approved treatment for a rare cancer, has 
been shown to reduce microglia count, lower inflammation, and increase synaptic 
markers in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the effects of 
PLX3397 on neural function in AD remain largely unknown. Here, we characterized 
the effects of PLX3397 treatment in 5xFAD mice. While PLX3397 increased synaptic 
density, it reduced the percentage of neurons phase-locked to gamma 
oscillations. This neural decoupling was closely associated with gene expression 
changes related to synapse organization. We investigated whether Gamma 
ENtrainment Using Sensory (GENUS) stimulation could counterbalance the neural 
circuit alterations induced by PLX3397. GENUS + PLX3397 restored gamma 
phase-locking, reshaped gene expression signatures, and improved learning and 
memory better than either treatment alone in 5xFAD mice. These findings suggest 
that CSF1R inhibitors like PLX3397 may benefit from a multimodal approach 
combining microglial targeting with non-invasive sensory stimulation to support 
neural physiology and improve cognitive function in AD.

Cognitive deficits, including deficits in the ability to shift behavior 
following negative consequences, often precede the accumulation of canonical 
neuropathological markers (Aβ plaques and tauopathy) and severe dementia in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. The Tg-F344-AD rat model exhibits 
age-dependent AD pathology and memory deficits that recapitulate AD, However, it 
is unknown how medial prefrontal cortex activity is altered in awake and 
behaving AD rats during learning and/or flexible behavior. Here we determine the 
ability of in 6-7month-old TgF344-AD rats to learn reward predictive cues and to 
shift behavior away from reward-predictive cues following outcome devaluation 
while recording mPFC neurons. Specifically, AD rats (n=17) and wild-type 
littermates (n=17) were presented with two distinct cues as conditioned stimuli 
(CS+) predicting distinct outcomes. A conditioned taste aversion to one outcome 
was induced, after which the rats were tested post-devaluation to evaluate their 
ability to avoid the CS+ associated with the devalued outcome. We found a loss 
of motivated behavior during learning and a loss of flexible behavior during 
testing in 6-7-month-old AD rats relative to WT littermate controls. In 
addition, there was differential aberrant mPFC encoding of cue-outcome 
associations in AD rats during conditioning and following outcome devaluation. 
Specifically, AD animals show fewer neurons during conditioning that encode both 
the cue and the outcome than WT animals. Also, AD animals also showed a greater 
proportion of neurons that exhibited an excited response to reward predictive 
cues post-outcome devaluation. Together, these data contribute to our 
understanding of alterations in mPFC that may underline prodromal AD behavioral 
deficits to inform future treatments.

INTRODUCTION: Plasma-to-autopsy studies are essential to understand how tau 
blood biomarkers change in relation to Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain pathology 
and how they are influenced by brain co-pathologies and comorbidities.
METHODS: Plasma samples from 102 brain donors of the Vallecas Alzheimer Reina 
Sofia cohort were analyzed using a mass spectrometry method to measure the 
levels of six phosphorylated and two non-phosphorylated tau biomarkers.
RESULTS: In cases with high pathological burden of AD, phosphorylated tau 
(p-tau)217 showed associations with neurofibrillary tangle counts across all 
regions, while p-tau205 was primarily linked to the frontal cortex, and the 
non-phosphorylated tau peptides were linked to the temporal cortex. Plasma tau 
levels decreased as Lewy body pathology progressed, even among individuals at 
the same tau Braak stage. All plasma biomarkers correlated with creatinine 
levels, as a marker of renal dysfunction, but this effect was mitigated when 
using the ratios phospho/non-phospho.
DISCUSSION: Understanding how plasma tau biomarkers are influenced by 
co-pathologies and comorbidities is crucial for their accurate implementation.
HIGHLIGHTS: The plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau)217 ratio, followed by the 
p-tau205 ratio and p-tau217, were the best-performing biomarkers for detecting 
neuropathologically confirmed Alzheimer's disease (AD). In high AD cases, 
p-tau217 showed associations with neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) counts across all 
regions, while p-tau205 was primarily linked to the frontal cortex, and 
non-phosphorylated tau peptides were linked to the temporal cortex. We observed 
a decline in plasma tau levels as Lewy body pathology progressed, even among 
individuals at the same tau Braak stage. All plasma biomarkers correlated with 
creatinine levels, as a marker of renal dysfunction, but this effect was 
mitigated when using the ratios. Plasma p-tau199 displayed a distinct behavior 
compared to other p-tau species, showing no association with NFT counts in any 
brain region, but demonstrating significant correlations with brain volume and 
an effect on survival time.

INTRODUCTION: Isolated rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (iRBD), 
characterized by abnormal movements during REM sleep, is a prodromal stage of 
dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease (PD). While iRBD shows 
emerging brain changes, their impact on structural connectivity and network 
efficiency, and their predictive value, remain poorly characterized.
METHODS: In this international prospective study, 198 polysomnography-confirmed 
iRBD patients and 174 controls underwent diffusion magnetic resonance imaging 
and were analyzed. Cutting-edge diffusion tractography and network-based 
statistics were applied to reconstruct individual connectomes and assess network 
properties predicting DLB or PD.
RESULTS: Structural architecture was already disrupted in iRBD, with both 
reduced and compensatory increased connections. Global efficiency was decreased. 
Local efficiency in motor regions was altered and associated with early clinical 
symptoms. Altered local efficiency in the supramarginal gyrus predicted DLB 
only.
DISCUSSION: Early disruption of brain architecture in iRBD predicts progression 
to synucleinopathy-related dementia, offering a novel potential prognostic 
biomarker.
HIGHLIGHTS: Isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) patients 
show significant alterations in inter-regional structural connectivity. Global 
efficiency is reduced in iRBD compared to controls. Areas with increased local 
efficiency contribute to decreased global efficiency. Altered network efficiency 
is associated with emerging Parkinsonian features. Higher supramarginal 
efficiency predicts dementia with Lewy bodies in iRBD.

BackgroundHuntington's Disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative 
disorder. Clinical features encompass a broad spectrum of movement disorders, 
psychiatric and cognitive symptoms, often progressing to dementia and imposing a 
substantial burden on patients and their families. While cholinesterase 
inhibitors and memantine are often used for symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's 
Disease and other dementias, there is currently no approved medication for 
treating cognitive symptoms in HD.ObjectiveWe aim to review, summarize, and 
appraise evidence from the literature for the use of cholinesterase inhibitors 
and memantine in the treatment of cognitive symptoms in patients with 
HD.MethodsA searched was conducted in PubMed and SCOPUS, from inception until 
February 2024, for Randomized Clinical Trials (RCTs), open-label, and 
case-control studies. Quality appraisal was performed using ROBINS-I and ROB2 
for non-randomized studies and RCTs, respectively.ResultsFive eligible studies 
(three RCTs, one extension study, and one retrospective case-control), exploring 
the use of rivastigmine (n = 3), memantine (n = 1), and donepezil (n = 1) were 
found. Only two had a follow-up period longer than eight months. Previous 
cognitive functioning was not specified in three out of five studies. Cognitive 
measures varied widely, with Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale and 
Mini-Mental State Exam being used more frequently. None of the studies showed a 
significant improvement in cognitive function. Side effects occurred in up to 
50% of patients and were usually considered mild.ConclusionsThere is 
insufficient evidence in the literature to support the use of cholinesterase 
inhibitors or memantine for cognitive symptoms in patients with HD.

specifically targeting a modified form of β-amyloid found predominantly within 
plaques (characterized as N-terminal pyroglutamate Aβ). Recently, it has gained 
approval for the use in early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) encompassing mild 
cognitive impairment due to AD or mild AD with confirmed brain amyloid 
pathology.
AREAS COVERED: This drug profile discusses donanemab's function, clinical 
effectiveness, safety, tolerability, health economics, access challenges, and 
future prospects. This article is based on systematic review that was derived 
from PubMed.
EXPERT OPINION: Donanemab is the third monoclonal antibody introduced for the 
treatment of individuals in the early stage of AD. While critical dialog 
continues regarding the potential impacts and role of antibody therapies, its 
approval signifies considerable progress in addressing the underlying pathology 
of AD. The authors are confident in the potential of antibodies against Aβ as a 
promising treatment option and foresee exciting advancements. However, further 
research is needed on trials extending beyond 18 months of follow-up, 
postmarketing surveillance, and the application of donanemab in combination with 
existing treatments and lifestyle interventions. Additionally, significant 
knowledge gaps and implementation limitations persist and must be addressed.

Feline cognitive dysfunction syndrome (CDS; a.k.a. feline dementia) is an 
age-related neurodegenerative disorder, comparable to dementia in people, 
characterised by behavioural changes such as increased vocalisation, altered 
social interactions, sleep-wake cycle, disorientation and house-soiling. 
Although the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood, pathologies similar 
to those observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been identified in the brains 
of aged or CDS-affected cats, including brain atrophy, neuronal loss, 
amyloid-beta plaques, tau pathology and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. 
Neuroinflammation and synapse loss, other important hallmarks of AD, may also 
play important roles in feline ageing and CDS, but these are yet to be explored. 
Several mechanisms of synapse loss have been described in human AD and mouse 
models of amyloidopathy, including synaptic accumulation of amyloid-beta and the 
aberrant induction of synaptic engulfment by microglia and astrocytes. In this 
study, immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy were used to examine the 
parietal cortex of young (n = 7), aged (n = 10) and CDS-affected (n = 8) cats. 
Linear mixed effect modelling revealed that amyloid-beta accumulates within 
synapses in the aged and CDS-affected brain. Additionally, in the aged and CDS 
groups, there was microgliosis, astrogliosis and increased synaptic engulfment 
by microglia and astrocytes in regions with Aβ plaques. Further, microglia and 
astrocytes show increased internalisation of amyloid-beta-containing synapses 
near plaques. These findings suggest that amyloid-beta exerts a pathogenic 
effect in the feline brain, with mechanisms mirroring those seen in human AD. 
Importantly, these results support the use of feline CDS as a naturally 
occurring, translational model of Alzheimer's disease, offering valuable 
insights into AD pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets.

Cellular senescence is a major contributor to aging-related degenerative 
diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), but much less is known about the 
key cell types and pathways driving senescence mechanisms in the brain. We 
hypothesized that dysregulated cholesterol metabolism is central to cellular 
senescence in AD. We analyzed single-cell RNA-seq data from the ROSMAP and 
SEA-AD cohorts to uncover cell type-specific senescence pathologies. In ROSMAP 
snRNA-seq data (982,384 nuclei from postmortem prefrontal cortex), microglia 
emerged as central contributors to AD-associated senescence phenotypes among 
non-neuronal cells. Homeostatic, inflammatory, phagocytic, lipid-processing, and 
neuronal-surveillance microglial states were associated with AD-related 
senescence in both ROSMAP (152,459 microglia nuclei from six brain regions) and 
SEA-AD (82,486 microglia nuclei) via integrative analysis. We assessed top 
senescence-associated bioprocesses and demonstrated that senescent microglia 
exhibit altered cholesterol-related processes and dysregulated cholesterol 
metabolism. We identified three gene co-expression modules representing 
cholesterol-related senescence signatures in postmortem brains. To validate 
these findings, we applied these signatures to snRNA-seq data from iPSC-derived 
microglia（iMGs) exposed to myelin, Aβ, apoptotic neurons, and synaptosomes. 
Treatment with AD-related substrates altered cholesterol-associated senescence 
signatures in iMGs. This study provides the first human evidence that 
dysregulated cholesterol metabolism in microglia drives cellular senescence in 
AD. Targeting cholesterol pathways in senescent microglia is an attractive 
strategy to attenuate AD progression.

Extracellular release and uptake of pathogenic forms of the 
microtubule-associated protein tau contribute to the pathogenesis of several 
neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Defining the cellular 
mechanisms and pathways for tau entry to human neurons is essential to 
understanding tauopathy pathogenesis and enabling the rational design of 
disease-modifying therapeutics. Here, whole-genome, loss-of-function CRISPR 
screens in human iPSC-derived excitatory neurons, the major neuronal cell type 
affected in these diseases, provide insights into the different cellular 
pathways for uptake of extracellular monomeric and fibrillar tau. Monomeric and 
fibrillar tau are both taken up by human neurons by receptor-mediated 
endocytosis, but involve different routes of entry at the neuronal surface: the 
low-density lipoprotein LRP1 is the primary receptor for monomeric tau, but 
contributes less to fibrillar tau entry. Similarly, endocytosis of monomeric tau 
is dependent on the familial Parkinson's disease gene LRRK2, but not required 
for endocytosis of fibrillar tau. These findings implicate LRP1 and LRRK2 in the 
pathogenesis of tauopathies and Parkinson's disease, and identify LRRK2 as a 
potential therapeutic target for altering progression of these diseases.

Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease (AD), Parkinson disease, 
frontotemporal lobar degeneration and multiple system atrophy (MSA) are 
characterized pathologically by deposition of specific proteins in the brain. 
Five major neurodegenerative disease-associated proteins - amyloid-β (Aβ), tau, 
α-synuclein, TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43) and fused in sarcoma (FUS) - are 
commonly encountered, and the disease specificity and neurotoxicity of the 
fibrillar protein assemblies are determined by factors such as the protein type, 
fibril structure, degree of multimerization and post-translational 
modifications. This article reviews the latest advances in PET technologies 
aimed at visualizing neurodegenerative proteinopathies, and highlights the 
importance of these technologies for emerging diagnostic and therapeutic 
approaches. PET allows Aβ deposition to be visualized throughout the natural 
history of AD and following anti-Aβ immunotherapies. However, whether this 
technology can visualize specific Aβ assembly subspecies primarily targeted by 
the treatment remains inconclusive. Various PET radiotracers can capture AD-type 
tau deposits, although only a few are known to react with non-AD tau 
pathologies, and cryo-electron microscopy has revealed the mode of binding of 
these compounds to different tau protofibrils. High-contrast PET imaging of 
α-synuclein lesions in MSA is a recent development in the field, and gradual 
progress is being made towards visualization of other, less abundant α-synuclein 
pathologies. Imaging of TDP43 and FUS deposits presents particular challenges, 
which might be overcome by establishing public-private partnerships focused on 
biomarker development.

Many brain disorders involve mitochondrial alterations, but owing to the lack of 
suitable tools, the causal role of mitochondrial dysfunction in 
pathophysiological processes is difficult to establish. Heterotrimeric guanine 
nucleotide-binding (G) proteins are key regulators of cell functions, and they 
can be found within mitochondria. Therefore, we reasoned that the activation of 
stimulatory mitochondrial G proteins (Gs) could rapidly promote the activity of 
the organelle and possibly compensate for bioenergetic dysfunction. Here, we 
show that a mitochondria-targeted recombinant designer receptor exclusively 
activated by designer drugs (mitoDREADD-Gs) can acutely trigger 
intramitochondrial signaling to increase mitochondrial membrane potential and 
oxygen consumption. In vivo activation of mitoDREADD-Gs abolished memory 
alterations in cannabinoid-treated mice and in two mouse models of Alzheimer's 
disease and frontotemporal dementia. Thus, mitoDREADD-Gs enables the 
establishment of causal relationships between mitochondria and biological or 
disease-related processes and represents an innovative potential therapeutic 
approach for disorders associated with mitochondrial impairment.

Mitochondrial dysfunction is increasingly recognized as a unifying mechanism 
underlying aging and a wide range of age-related diseases. This special issue 
brings together recent advances that elucidate how impaired mitochondrial 
function contributes to neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, and metabolic 
disorders. The featured articles highlight molecular pathways of mitochondrial 
decline, its systemic consequences, and potential interventions aimed at 
restoring mitochondrial health. Collectively, these studies reinforce the 
concept that targeting mitochondrial integrity holds significant promise for 
promoting healthy aging and preventing chronic disease.

BACKGROUND: Scalable tools to efficiently identify individuals likely to have 
cognitive impairment (CI) are critical in the Alzheimer disease and related 
dementias field. The Everyday Cognition scale (ECog) and its short form (ECog12) 
assess subjective cognitive and functional changes and are useful in predicting 
CI. Recent advances in online technology have enabled the use of web-based 
cognitive tests and questionnaires to identify CI with greater convenience and 
scalability. While the effectiveness of the ECog has been demonstrated in 
clinical settings, its potential to detect CI in remote, unsupervised formats 
remains underexplored.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare the ability of the web-based ECog and the 
in-clinic ECog in distinguishing between individuals with CI and those who are 
cognitively unimpaired (CU), and to evaluate the effectiveness of the ECog12-the 
short version of the ECog-compared to the full-length ECog in a web-based 
setting.
METHODS: Participants were recruited from the Brain Health Registry (BHR; 
web-based) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; in-clinic) 
settings with available clinical diagnoses. The ability of the self-reported 
ECog (Self-ECog), study partner-reported ECog (SP-ECog), Self-ECog12, and 
SP-ECog12 to discriminate individuals with CI from CU was assessed using 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Area under the ROC curves (AUCs) 
between BHR and ADNI were compared using the DeLong test, as were AUCs between 
ECog12 and ECog in BHR.
RESULTS: Web-based Self-ECog and SP-ECog scores effectively discriminated CI 
from CU with AUCs of 0.722 and 0.818, respectively. Similarly, the abbreviated 
web-based versions, Self-ECog12 and SP-ECog12, also demonstrated discriminative 
ability (AUC=0.709 and 0.777, respectively). When compared to in-clinic ECog 
scores, there were no significant differences in the ability to distinguish CI 
from CU between web-based and in-clinic versions (BHR Self-ECog AUC=0.722 vs 
ADNI Self-ECog AUC=0.769, DeLong P=.06; BHR SP-ECog AUC=0.818 vs ADNI SP-ECog 
AUC=0.840, DeLong P=.50). Additionally, the comparison between web-based ECog 
and ECog12 showed no significant difference in AUCs (BHR Self-ECog AUC=0.722 vs 
BHR Self-ECog12 AUC=0.709, DeLong P=.18).
CONCLUSIONS: Web-based ECog scores, both the full-length and short-form, were as 
valid as in-clinic ECog scores for identifying clinically diagnosed CI. In 
addition, Self-ECog12 was as effective as full-length Self-ECog to identify CI 
in a web-based setting, offering a cost-effective and accessible screening tool 
for large-scale studies. These results highlight the value of the web-based ECog 
as a valid tool for identifying older adults with CI in a remote clinical study, 
facilitating early detection and referral for comprehensive evaluations for 
identifying potential candidates for disease-modifying therapy.

IMPORTANCE: Sex differences may contribute to disparities in dementia outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: To understand the association between sex and mortality and health 
care services use after dementia diagnosis.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This nationwide cohort study used Medicare 
enrollment data and took place from 2014 to 2021 with up to 8 years of 
follow-up. Analysis was performed from April 2024 to April 2025. This study 
included 5 721 711 patients 65 years or older with International Statistical 
Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision diagnosis 
codes for dementia with at least 1 year of prior fee-for-service Medicare 
enrollment.
EXPOSURES: Sex, determined from Medicare enrollment data, derived from Social 
Security Administration records.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was hazard of all-cause 
mortality, estimated with Cox proportional hazard regression. Secondary outcomes 
included hazards of use of common health care services, such as all-cause 
hospitalizations, skilled nursing facility stays, receipt of neuroimaging 
services, and physical/occupational therapy.
RESULTS: A total of 5 721 711 patients (3 302 579 female and 2 419 132 male) 
with incident dementia between 2014 and 2021 were included in the study. Female 
patients had lower crude 1-year mortality rates (21.8% vs 27.2% for male 
patients; P < .001) and lower rates of all-cause hospitalizations (46.9% vs 
50.5%; P < .001). The unadjusted hazard of death associated with male sex was 
1.30 (95% CI, 1.29-1.31; P < .001). After adjustment for age, race and 
ethnicity, Medicaid dual eligibility, medical comorbidity burden, and access to 
health care resources, the association was modestly attenuated (adjusted hazard 
ratio, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.23-1.26; P < .001). Similarly, the unadjusted hazard 
ratio of all-cause hospitalization associated with male sex was 1.13 (95% CI, 
1.12-1.14; P < .001); the adjusted hazard ratio was 1.08 (95% CI, 1.08-1.09; 
P < .001). Male patients also had increased hazards of hospice stay, 
neuroimaging services, and hospitalization for neurodegenerative disease 
diagnosis or behavioral disturbance.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, male patients with dementia had higher 
mortality rates and higher use of many health care services, especially hospital 
stays, than comparable female patients. Strategies to slow mortality and 
decrease health care use among male patients with dementia may be particularly 
impactful in limiting the burden of dementia. Given higher incidence of dementia 
among women, a focus on efforts to prevent dementia is necessary to achieve 
population-level health equity in dementia-attributable mortality by sex.

State anxiety involves transient feelings of tension and nervousness in response 
to threats, which can escalate into anxiety disorders if persistent. Despite 
treatments, 30%-50% of individuals show limited improvement, and 
neurophysiological mechanisms of treatment responsiveness remain unclear, 
requiring the development of objective biomarkers. In this study, multimodal 
electrophysiological parameters is monitored: heart rate variability (high 
frequency (HF), lowfrequency (LF), LF/HF ratio), EEG beta and alpha relative 
power, and brain-to-heart connectivity in participants with real-life state 
anxiety. Participants underwent a therapeutic intervention combining 
virtual-reality immersion, hypnotic script, and a breath control exercise. 
Real-life state anxiety is captured using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Form 
Y1 (STAI-Y1) scale before and after the intervention. It is observed reduced 
anxiety immediately after the intervention in 16 out of 27 participants. While 
all participants, independently of their STAI-Y1 score, showed increased heart 
rate variability (HRV) low frequency power, only treatment-responders displayed 
increased overall autonomic tone (high and low frequency HRV), increased midline 
beta power and brain-to-heart connectivity. Notably, the LF/HF ratio showed a 
significant linear relationship with anxiety reduction, with higher ratios 
linked to greater therapeutic response. These findings suggest that increased 
cognitive regulation of brain-to-heart connectivity can serve as a biomarker for 
therapeutic efficacy, with elevated midline beta power facilitating improved 
cardiac tone in responders.

Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are complex neurodegenerative 
disorders of which the genetic basis remains incompletely understood. 
Hippocampal volume loss is a core hallmark of AD. Hippocampal volume also has a 
strong heritable component and its genetic underpinnings may help us to 
understand the complex biological mechanism underlying ADRD. To identify shared 
genetic risk loci across late-onset ADRD and bilateral hippocampal volumes, we 
conducted a cross-trait analysis of existing GWAS data on the two traits using 
the conjunctional false discovery rate (conjFDR) framework. Functional 
annotation and phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) were performed on the 
identified shared loci to characterize their biological relevance. We identified 
11 unique lead genetic loci, of which 7 loci showed discordant directional 
effects (loci associated with increased risk for ADRD and smaller hippocampal 
volumes). We found that SHARPIN and TNIP1 genes play a role in ADRD by affecting 
hippocampal volumes. In addition, we observed 9 novel ADRD-hippocampus loci in 
genes previously implicated in AD (IGIP and ACE) and novel ADRD-genes (KCTD13, 
HINT1, SH3TC2, FAM53B, TPM1, IL34 and SSH2). PheWAS results show that most 
shared loci associated with neuroimaging measurements, white blood cell markers, 
red blood cell markers, and lipids. This study shows a shared genetic basis 
between ADRD and bilateral hippocampal volumes. By integrating summary 
statistics for these two traits, we identified both novel and previously 
reported ADRD-hippocampus loci. Functional analysis highlights the role of 
immune cells and lipid markers in the shared loci, suggesting a shared 
neurobiological basis for ADRD and bilateral hippocampal volumes.

This manuscript provides an outlook on using cognitive enhancers and their 
ethical implications. Cognitive enhancers, including prescription medications 
like modafinil and methylphenidate, over-the-counter supplements such as ginseng 
and caffeine, and novel nootropic agents like gene therapy and stem cell 
interventions, improve cognitive functions such as memory, focus, and learning. 
While they have shown efficacy in treating neurodegenerative disorders like 
Alzheimer's disease and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), their 
growing use by healthy individuals raises ethical concerns. This paper addresses 
the benefits of cognitive enhancers, such as improved academic and professional 
performance, and the associated risks, including addiction, dependence, and 
long-term health consequences. It also delves into social and ethical issues, 
including disparities in access, fairness, coercion in competitive environments, 
and distinguishing between genuine and substance-enhanced achievements. 
Additionally, the paper examines current regulations and proposes stronger legal 
frameworks to address the increasing use of cognitive enhancers. In conclusion, 
while cognitive enhancers have potential therapeutic benefits, a balanced 
approach is needed to regulate their use and ensure they are not misused to gain 
unfair advantages, particularly in non-medical settings.

Neurological disorders represent a significant burden on human health, 
particularly as global life expectancy continues to rise. Among these 
conditions, Alzheimer's disease is notably prevalent. Of greater concern, if 
left untreated or unaddressed, Alzheimer's disease can progress to dementia, 
leading to severe cognitive decline and a substantial reduction in quality of 
life. In this study, 15 novel benzofuran-azacyclic hybrids were designed and 
synthesized. The final compounds were evaluated for their inhibitory potency on 
AChE and BACE-1 enzymes, and in silico studies were performed to clarify their 
binding modes. Finally, structure-activity relationships (SARs) were proposed 
for future studies. The results indicated that the most promising compound is 
4m, which contains N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-piperazine and benzofuran moieties. These 
moieties effectively occupied the substrate channel of the AChE enzyme and the 
catalytic cleft of the BACE-1 enzyme. Additionally, compounds 4e (benzyl 
piperidine) and 4h (2-furoyl piperazine) showed dual inhibitory activity on both 
enzymes. In conclusion, the tubular form with a stopper group shows great 
potential for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, as it blocks the entrance 
cavity of the AChE active pocket for the substrate and increases the stability 
of the inactive BACE-1 enzyme. Moreover, electrolytes, specifically sodium ions 
in this case, play a crucial role in stabilizing the 4m-BACE-1 protein complex. 
For further studies, we suggest that the tubular form with a stopper can serve 
as a potential pharmacophore and an appropriate starting point for drug 
development.

BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a known risk factor for cognitive decline 
and Alzheimer's disease (AD), possibly due to insulin resistance and impaired 
cerebral glucose metabolism. Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission 
tomography-computed tomography (FDG PET-CT) imaging has shown AD-like 
hypometabolism patterns in diabetic individuals in various global studies. 
However, such data is lacking in the Indian population. This study investigated 
the presence of AD-like hypometabolism in Indian diabetic patients compared to 
non-diabetic controls.
AIM AND OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate whether the Indian diabetic 
patients show AD-like reduction in brain glucose metabolism, as several studies 
reported AD-like hypometabolism in the brain at very early stages before making 
a clinical diagnosis of probable AD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective, observational study was conducted on 78 
patients (39 diabetics and 39 non-diabetics; age range 43-87 years) at a 
tertiary care center. After excluding patients with a recent history of stroke, 
transient ischemic attack, or structural brain abnormalities, all participants 
underwent dedicated brain FDG PET-CT imaging just after a whole-body scan. Scans 
were analyzed using CORTEX-ID software (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA), 
comparing cerebral glucose metabolism to age-matched normative data. Regional 
hypometabolism was normalized to thalamic activity. Appropriate tests of 
significance were used, and P< 0.05 was considered statistically significant.  
Results: The study included 78 patients, 39 diabetics and 39 non-diabetic 
controls, matched for sex (19 males and 20 females in each group). Diabetic 
patients had a higher mean age (66.4 ± 10.6 years). The Mini-Mental State 
Examination (MMSE) score was lower in diabetics (25.3 ± 2.3) than in controls 
(26.8 ± 1.9). About 5.1% of diabetic patients showed an AD-like pattern, and the 
remaining 94.9% did not show an AD-like pattern on the FDG PET-CT scan. An 
AD-like pattern was not seen in any patient among the non-diabetic control 
group. No statistically significant association was found between the AD-like 
pattern in the brain on FDG PET-CT and diabetes (P = 0.494).
CONCLUSIONS: No significant incidence of "AD-like pattern" in the brain on 
PET-CT images using FDG was seen in this research study on the Indian diabetic 
populations. However, abnormal brain scans with no AD-like hypometabolism 
patterns possibly suggested other etiologies, likely depression. More 
prospective multicentric research studies on a large Indian diabetic population 
with age-matched non-diabetic control groups need to be explored for definite 
conclusions.

INTRODUCTION: Although hallmarked by β-amyloid plaques (Aβ) and neurofibrillary 
tangles (tau), Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial disorder that 
involves neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, and synaptic dysfunction. 
AD-associated biomolecular changes seem to be attenuated in carriers of the 
functionally advantageous variant of the KLOTHO gene (KL-VSHET). Independently, 
better cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is associated with better health outcomes 
related to AD pathology. Here we investigate whether the relationships between 
CRF (peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak)) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) core AD 
biomarkers and those of neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, and synaptic 
dysfunction differ for KL-VSHET compared to noncarriers (KL-VSNC).
METHODS: The cohort, enriched for AD risk, consisted of cognitively unimpaired 
adults (n = 136; MeanAGE(SD) = 62.5(6.7)) from the Wisconsin Registry for 
Alzheimer's Prevention and the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. 
Covariate-adjusted (age, sex, parental AD history, apolipoprotein E (APOE) 4+ 
status, and age difference between CSF sampling and exercise test) linear models 
examined the interaction between VO2peak and KLOTHO genotype on CSF core AD 
biomarker levels (phosphorylated tau 181 [pTau181], Aβ42/Aβ40, pTau181/Aβ42). 
Analyses were repeated for CSF biomarkers of neurodegeneration (total tau 
[tTau], α-synuclein [α-syn], neurofilament light polypeptide [NfL]), synaptic 
dysfunction (neurogranin [Ng]), and neuroinflammation (glial fibrillary acidic 
protein [GFAP], soluble triggering receptor expressed in myeloid cells [sTREM2], 
chitinase-3-like protein 1 [YKL-40], interleukin 6 [IL-6], S100 calcium-binding 
protein B [S100B]).
RESULTS: The interaction between VO2peak and KL-VSHET was significant for tTau 
(p = 0.05), pTau181 (p = 0.03), Ng (p = 0.02), sTREM2 (p = 0.03), and YKL-40 (p 
= 0.03), such that lower levels of each biomarker were observed for KL-VSHET who 
were more fit. No significant KL-VSxVO2peak interactions were observed for 
Aβ42/Aβ40, pTau181/Aβ42, α-syn, NfL, GFAP, IL-6 or S100B (all Ps>0.09).
CONCLUSIONS: We report a synergistic relationship between KL-VSHET and CRF with 
pTau181, tTau, Ng, sTREM2 and YKL-40, suggesting a protective role for both 
KL-VSHET and better CRF against unfavorable AD-related changes. Their 
potentially shared biological mechanisms require future investigations.
HIGHLIGHTS: KLOTHO KL-VSHET and higher cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) may 
protect against unfavorable Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related changes.Higher CRF 
attenuates neurodegeneration and synaptic dysfunction in KL-VSHET.More fit 
KL-VSHET also has lower levels of pTau and less neuroinflammation.

Alzheimer's disease presents a complex global health issue. It is characterized 
by a decline in cognitive function, starting with memory impairment, and 
extending to impact reasoning, language abilities, and spatial awareness. 
Despite decades of research, Alzheimer's disease remains a global challenge 
lacking long-term treatments. Institutions like the Karolinska Institutet, 
Columbia University, the University of California San Francisco (UCSF), and the 
University of Pittsburgh contribute significantly to Alzheimer's research, with 
a growth in publications in 2022 post-COVID-19. While current treatments offer 
symptomatic relief, there's a need for disease-modifying therapies targeting its 
mechanisms. This analysis aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the 
available research and medical literature on Alzheimer's disease by employing 
bibliometric methods to identify publication trends, leading research 
institutions, and the evolving focus from symptomatic treatments to

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by brain protein depositions, impaired 
synaptic transmission, and progressive cognitive decline. This clinical study, 
conducted at the tertiary memory clinic of Karolinska University Hospital in 
Stockholm, evaluates plasma pTau217 (in comparison to other plasma biomarkers) 
as a non-invasive marker for predicting brain amyloid load and cognitive 
impairment. Uniquely, it integrates plasma biomarkers with cognitive profiling 
and amyloid PET to assess diagnostic utility across disease stages in a 
real-world memory clinic setting. A total of 122 patients underwent extensive 
clinical examinations, including CSF analysis (used here for clinical diagnosis 
only), CT/MRI, neuropsychological (NP) testing (n = 80) and blood biomarker 
measurements. Prior to PET imaging, 74 patients were diagnosed with MCI among 
other diagnoses (AD, other dementia, no dementia). Following PET, patients were 
reclassified into diagnostic groups: MCI Aβ- (n = 29), MCI Aβ+ (n = 19), AD 
(n = 51), other dementias (n = 11). ROC analysis evaluated the ability of plasma 
biomarkers to predict Aβ-PET positivity. NP test z-scores were reduced into 
principal components (PCs) using PCA. Plasma pTau217 and pTau217/Aβ42 ratio were 
elevated in Aβ+ patients compared to MCI Aβ-patients. The ratio distinguished 
MCI Aβ+ from AD and, together with pTau217, showed the highest predictive value 
for Aβ positivity in the MCI group among the biomarkers analyzed (AUC 92.8% and 
91.4%). Plasma pTau217/Aβ42 ratio was associated with principal component PC2 
("memory encoding and recall") in MCI Aβ+ (ρ =0.64, p=0.01) and negatively 
correlated with RAVL retrieval (PC2) in the same group (ρ =-0.57 and -0.6, 
p=0.028 and 0.017, respectively). Additionally, pTau217 correlated with the 
"Information" z-score (PC4) in both AD (ρ = -0.50, p = 0.005) and MCI Aβ+ 
(ρ = 0.53, p = 0.042). Plasma pTau217/Aβ42 might be a valuable predictor of 
brain amyloid pathology and a potential marker of domain-specific cognitive 
impairment in AD.

Herein, a series of novel 5-hydroxymethylfuran incorporated thiazole-based furan 
derivatives are synthesized and characterized. The in vitro inhibitory 
potentials of the derivatives against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and 
butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) are evaluated. In addition, the inhibitory 
potential of the thiazole-based furan derivatives against AChE (4EY7) and BChE 
(4BDS) proteins is examined as in silico. For this purpose, the effects of the 
compounds on human metabolism are evaluated with absorption, distribution, 
metabolism, excretion, and toxicity programming. Furthermore, their antioxidant 
potential is assessed through 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 
2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) radical scavenging 
assays. The enzymatic inhibition studies reveal that all compounds exhibit 
inhibitory effects on both AChE and BChE. Among them, compound 2b demonstrates 
the most potent inhibition against AChE, with a KI value of 14.887 ± 1.054 μM, 
whereas compound 2f exhibits the highest inhibitory activity against BChE, with 
a KI value of 4.763 ± 0.321 μM. Compounds 2a (12.202% for DPPH and 56.842% for 
ABTS) and 2i (13.309% for DPPH and 31.842% for ABTS) are among the most active 
compounds for both radical scavenging tests. These findings highlight that the 
synthesized derivatives possess promising dual cholinesterase (ChE) inhibitory 
activity as well as radical scavenging potential. These activities emphasize 
their potential as therapeutic candidates for neurodegenerative disorders such 
as Alzheimer's disease.

INTRODUCTION: Much emphasis has been given to the biological activities of 
Fenugreek against various diseased conditions. This study investigated the 
effect of fenugreek leaf extract on behavioural and cognitive function of 
transgenic Drosophila having human Aβ-42 expression in the neurons, herein 
referred to as Alzheimer's disease model flies (AD flies).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: AD flies were exposed to four different doses of 
fenugreek leaf extract (FE) containing i.e., 0.005, 0.010, 0.015 and 0.02 g/ml 
for 30 days. Thereafter, behavioural and cognitive assessment was done using 
climbing ability, activity pattern, aversive phototaxis and odour choice 
indexes. The life span of different groups of flies was also recorded. The 
effect of FE on the oxidative stress markers, acetylcholinesterase, monoamine 
oxidase (MAO) and caspase 3 and 9 activities was determined. The deposition of 
Aβ-42 aggregates in the brain tissue of the flies was studied by performing 
immunostaining. Also, the metabolic profile of different groups of flies was 
studied by performing LC-MS/MS. Compared with control flies, 22 selected 
metabolites were found to be upregulated and downregulated among transgenic AD 
flies and FE exposed AD flies compared to control.
RESULTS: The findings of this study showed the neuroprotective role of fenugreek 
extract, which could be employed for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The 
AD flies exposed to FE showed a dose-dependent postponement in the decline of 
climbing ability, activity and cognitive impairments. A significant dose 
dependent increase in the life span was also noticed in the AD flies exposed to 
FE. A significant reduction in the oxidative stress, acetylcholinesterase, 
monoamine oxidase, and caspase-3&9 activities was also observed in a dose 
dependent manner. The results obtained from the immunostaining suggest the 
reduction in the deposition of Aβ-42 fibril, which was also confirmed by the 
docking studies showing the energetically favoured interaction useful for 
inhibiting the acetylcholinesterase and Aβ-42 aggregates.
DISCUSSION: This study demonstrates the neurological potency of fenugreek leaf 
extract (FE) in a Drosophila model of AD due to its antioxidantive, 
anti-cholinesterase, and neuroprotective properties. Using a combination of 
behavioral, biochemical, histological, and metabolomic approaches, we evaluated 
the therapeutic potential of FE in mitigating AD-like symptoms in transgenic 
flies expressing Aβ-42.
CONCLUSION: Fenugreek leaf extract may serve as a potential natural remedy for 
slowing down or alleviating the progression of AD.

Tau, a highly disordered protein, comprises four repeat domains (R1-R4) 
essential for tubulin binding and structural stability. Post-translational 
modifications, such as the phosphorylation of serine residues within these 
repeat domains, regulate the tau protein's association and dissociation with 
tubulin protein. Notably, the detachment of tau from tubulin following 
phosphorylation contributes to neurofibrillary tangle formation within neurons, 
a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Despite its significance, the structural 
alterations induced by phosphorylation and their impact on these domains remain 
poorly understood. The present in silico study investigates the structural 
effects of phosphorylation at Ser305 (R2 domain), adjacent to the PGGG motif, 
and Ser320 (R3 domain), near the regulatory KxGS motif, through docking and 
simulation studies. The findings indicate that phosphorylation at Ser305 
enhances tubulin binding more effectively than phosphorylation at Ser320. 
Alternatively, this finding was validated by binding the aggregator inducer, 
heparin, to tau. The results confirmed that Ser320-phosphorylated tau exhibited 
stronger binding than Ser305-phosphorylated tau protein. Altogether, these 
results suggest that Ser320-phosphorylated tau enhances the tau protein's 
propensity to aggregate more by strongly binding to heparin and activating the 
detachment process through weakly binding to tubulin. Thus, this study suggests 
that structural changes following phosphorylation at Ser305 might be 
non-pathogenic, whereas phosphorylation at Ser320 could be pathogenic, 
contributing to adverse effects. A deeper understanding of the role of 
phosphorylation in the tau-tubulin detachment mechanism could aid in the 
development of novel inhibitors to regulate tau aggregation and prevent 
neurofibrillary tangle formation.

Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder marked by 
cognitive decline, memory loss, and behavioral changes. Early diagnosis, 
particularly identifying Early Mild Cognitive Impairment (EMCI), is vital for 
managing the disease and improving patient outcomes. Detecting EMCI is 
challenging due to the subtle structural changes in the brain, making precise 
slice selection from MRI scans essential for accurate diagnosis. In this 
context, the careful selection of specific MRI slices that provide distinct 
anatomical details significantly enhances the ability to identify these early 
changes. The chief novelty of the study is that instead of selecting all slices, 
an approach for identifying the important slices is developed. The ADNI-3 
dataset was used as the dataset when running the models for early detection of 
Alzheimer's disease. Satisfactory results have been obtained by classifying with 
deep learning models, vision transformers (ViT) and by adding new structures to 
them, together with the model proposal. In the results obtained, while an 
accuracy of 99.45% was achieved with EfficientNetB2 + FPN in AD vs. LMCI 
classification from the slices selected with SSIM, an accuracy of 99.19% was 
achieved in AD vs. EMCI classification, in fact, the study significantly 
advances early detection by demonstrating improved diagnostic accuracy of the 
disease at the EMCI stage. The results obtained with these methods emphasize the 
importance of developing deep learning models with slice selection integrated 
with the Vision Transformers architecture. Focusing on accurate slice selection 
enables early detection of Alzheimer's at the EMCI stage, allowing for timely 
interventions and preventive measures before the disease progresses to more 
advanced stages. This approach not only facilitates early and accurate 
diagnosis, but also lays the groundwork for timely intervention and treatment, 
offering hope for better patient outcomes in Alzheimer's disease. The study is 
finally evaluated by a statistical significance test.

Exploring Vascular Contributions to Cognitive Impairment: Small-Vessel Disease 
of White Matter and Microplastics/Nanoplastics.

Cognitive impairment due to vascular pathology was recognized by Otto Binswanger 
in 1894, before Alois Alzheimer presented his findings in 1907. Vascular causes 
of cognitive impairment are likely due to a range of pathologies that are still, 
a hundred years later, unknown. Recent epidemiologic evidence from post-mortem 
human brains reports cases may be afflicted by Alzheimer disease, vascular 
disease, or both. Although it is well known that hypertension and diabetes 
affect vasculature throughout the body as well as brain, other types of 
underlying causes that primarily affect cerebral vessels are understudied. 
Consensus guidelines exist for histopathologic diagnosis of Alzheimer disease, 
but are limited for cerebrovascular diseases. Here, first, the anatomy of brain 
vasculature is reviewed. Next, a schema for categorization of vascular 
pathologies is proposed, followed by examples that illustrate these pathologies 
together with stains useful for their detection. Scoring pathologies across many 
cases according to this schema will subdivide vascular dementias into their 
underlying, potentially treatable, categories. The recent discovery of 
microplastics/nanoplastics in the brain and their association with vasculature 
will have a profound influence on how vascular-pathology-associated cognitive 
impairment is understood and diagnosed. Going forward, anatomic pathologists 
will need to apply this categorization to triage types of cerebrovascular 
pathology and begin to dissect its underlying causes, consequences, and 
potential treatments.

Enrichment strategies play a critical role in modern clinical trial design, 
especially as precision medicine advances the focus on patient-specific 
efficacy. By targeting biomarker-defined populations most likely to benefit, 
these strategies improve efficiency, reduce sample sizes and costs, accelerate 
timelines, and minimize unnecessary exposure to treatment-related risks and side 
effects. Recent developments in enrichment design have introduced biomarker 
randomness and accounted for the correlation structure between treatment effect 
and biomarker, resulting in a two-stage threshold enrichment design. However, 
existing methods are limited to a single continuous biomarker. While 
incorporating multiple biomarkers can improve the accuracy of target population 
identification, no study has examined how to incorporate multiple continuous 
biomarkers into enrichment designs due to the challenges in determining multiple 
thresholds. To fully utilize information from all relevant biomarkers, we 
propose novel two-stage enrichment designs capable of handling two or more 
continuous biomarkers. Our framework accommodates two popular treatment effect 
metrics including average treatment effect (ATE) and the standardized ATE. We 
illustrate our method using a hypothetical clinical trial involving early-stage 
Alzheimer's patients and assess the impact of stage one sample size on threshold 
estimation through a simulation study. Overall, our proposed two-stage 
enrichment designs offer researchers greater flexibility in integrating multiple 
continuous biomarkers. The findings from our study provide valuable insights for 
the advancement of enrichment trial methodology.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative disorder causing neuronal loss and 
cognitive deficits, which is associated with intestinal flora dysbiosis. Acori 
Tatarinowii Rhizoma (ATR) is the dried rhizome of Acorus tatarinowii Schott., 
and exhibits neuroprotective effects. We aimed to investigate the therapeutic 
mechanism of ATR in AD. AD rat models were constructed by 
intracerebroventricular injection of Aβ1-42, with gavage of ATR water extract 
(5, 10, and 20 mg/kg) for 21 days. Behavior tests, HE staining, 
immunohistochemistry, ELISA, immunofluorescence, and 16S rRNA sequencing were 
performed. In AD rats, ATR improved cognitive dysfunction and brain 
histopathological damage, with reduced Aβ1-42, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, tumor 
necrosis factor-α, malondialdehyde, ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule, 
and glial fibrillary acidic protein expression, and higher superoxide dismutase 
activity, indicating inhibition of neuroinflammation by ATR. Moreover, 
Ruminococcus was strongly associated with ATR treatment for AD, which mainly 
enriched in Carbohydrate metabolism, Amino acid metabolism, and Lipid 
metabolism. Meanwhile, Dorea was negatively correlated with behavioural 
indicators and positively correlated with inflammatory factors, whereas 
g_Adlercreutzia showed the opposite trend. These findings suggested that ATR may 
attenuate neuroinflammation and improved AD by modulating intestinal flora and 
inhibiting microglia and astrocyte activation, providing a scientific basis for 
its clinical application in AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a widespread central nervous system degenerative 
disease in the elderly population. This study aims to uniquely targets this 
sex-specific vulnerability by investigating the effects of 17β-E2 on the 
differentiation and migration capabilities of Aβ-damaged NSCs and its potential 
mechanisms-a critical gap for female-focused AD therapies. Primary NSCs isolated 
from neonatal SD rats were treated with Aβ25-35 (60 μM) to mimic AD pathology, 
followed by 17β-E2 (100 nM) with or without BX795 (a Wnt3a/β-catenin inhibitor). 
Results showed that Aβ significantly suppressed Wnt3a, LRP6, and β-catenin 
mRNA/protein levels while increasing GSK-3β expression. 17β-E2 treatment 
reversed these effects, enhancing phosphorylated GSK-3β (Ser9) and β-catenin, 
which were abolished by BX795. Transwell assays demonstrated that 17β-E2 rescued 
Aβ-damaged migration deficits, accompanied by elevated p-MLC and Cdc42 protein 
levels. Furthermore, 17β-E2 promoted neuronal differentiation, increasing 
MAP2 + and βIII-tubulin + cells with enhanced dendritic complexity, whereas 
BX795 counteracted these benefits. These findings indicate that 17β-E2 mitigates 
Aβ-damaged NSCs dysfunction by activating the Wnt3a/β-catenin pathway via GSK-3β 
phosphorylation, highlighting its therapeutic potential for AD by enhancing 
neurogenesis and NSC mobility.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common dementia, with rising global 
prevalence, still incomplete pathogenetic understanding and very limited 
effective therapies. Recent advances in biomarker identification of Aβ peptides 
and phospho-tau protein, and in anti-Aβ immunotherapy are suggesting that more 
early intervention will be more effective. Alternative therapeutic strategies to 
anti-Aß immunotherapy have received comparably less attention, yet one specific 
approach toward upstream neuroprotection by improvement of intracellular calcium 
homeostasis, activation of endogenous neuroprotection and restoration of 
autophagy through sigma-1 receptor activation recently demonstrated positive 
clinical data with oral blarcamesine in a phase IIb/III trial in 508 patients 
with early AD. AD-preventive approaches beyond lifestyle interventions become 
attractive candidates when meeting criteria of: (i) record of effective early 
intervention in mild disease, (ii) record of human safety, (iii) ease of 
administration, (iv) scalability to population level, (v) relative 
cost-effectiveness considering longer-term preventive use at population level. 
Here, we assessed blarcamesine's efficacy at preventing memory impairment and 
brain oxidative injury in the mouse preclinical model induced by 
intracerebroventricular injection of aggregated Aβ25-35 peptide, that permitted 
a clean preventive approach before administration of the pathology-inducing 
amyloidogenic Aβ fragment. We observed significant preventions of 
Aβ25-35-induced memory impairments, for both spatial working and contextual 
long-term memories, and of Aβ25-35-induced increase in lipid peroxidation in the 
mouse hippocampi. These new insights, together with blarcamesine's clinical 
record in early AD render blarcamesine an attractive candidate for AD 
pharmacological prevention.

Triptolide (TP) has shown its therapeutic effects on Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
via decreasing the overloading of β-amyloid protein (Aβ). However, the roles and 
mechanisms of TP in the pathogenesis of tau have not been revealed until now. To 
this end, the current study aimed to assess the effects of TP on AD via 
tau-associated mechanisms. In detail, TP treatment decreases the phosphorylation 
of tau, which results in attenuating the cognitive decline of PS19 mice. In the 
mechanisms, we found that TP treatment elevates the levels of insulin, which 
lowers the blood glucose, leading to superior performance in the glucose 
tolerance test, inhibition of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and the 
change of serum triglycerides and cholesterol. The in vitro studies 
demonstrating that TP increases insulin production via cAMP-response element 
binding protein (CREB)- and pancreatic-duodenal homeobox factor 1 
(PDX-1)-dependent mechanisms in MIN6 cells further supported the in vivo 
findings. By enhancing insulin production, TP upregulates protein O-GlcNAc 
modification and inhibits Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 2 (CaMK2) 
activity to reduce tau phosphorylation in both in vivo and in vitro experiments. 
Additionally, metabolic changes decrease the activity of the CCAAT/enhancer 
binding protein beta (C/EBPβ)/asparagine endopeptidase (AEP) signaling pathway, 
significantly reducing the associated neuroinflammation. Guided by these 
mechanisms, TP shows inhibitory effects on tau phosphorylation via an insulin 
secretion-dependent pathway.

The circadian clock, as a molecular timekeeper, influences most behavioural and 
physiological processes. Numerous symptoms associated with neurodegenerative 
diseases, such as sleep disorders, anxiety, and mood alteration, are linked to 
circadian clock dysregulation. Dysregulation of the circadian system is 
increasingly implicated in the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease, and 
emerging evidence highlights a bidirectional relationship between Alzheimer's 
disease and circadian clock disruption. A crucial point is that the circadian 
clock regulates adult neurogenesis, a process that is significantly impaired in 
Alzheimer's disease. Recent advancements suggest that the dynamic epigenetic 
mechanisms-including DNA and histone modifications as well as regulation by 
non-coding RNA-act as a critical regulation for circadian rhythms and 
neurogenesis. Therefore, research on circadian disruption and, particularly, 
focus on harmonising the circadian clock with neurogenesis in neurodegenerative 
diseases may also speed up the creation of innovative, circadian-based 
treatments to counteract the progress of neurological disorders from a new 
perspective. In this review, we explore potential epigenetic mechanisms linking 
the circadian system to neurodegenerative diseases, with a focus on Alzheimer's 
Disease.

Identifying new drug targets to enhance memory and learning is essential for 
treating neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. We previously 
showed that benzothiazole amphiphiles can improve memory and learning by 
increasing dendritic spine and synaptic density in both WT mice and in a 
transgenic Alzheimer's model mice. The cellular target for this class of 
compounds, however, was unknown. Using a photoaffinity-labeling approach, we 
identify fascin-1 as the major protein target in neurons for these compounds. 
These compounds enhance spine density by directly modulating actin dynamics, 
increasing the capability of fascin-1 to bundle actin filaments. Molecular 
docking and structure-guided mutagenesis studies reveal a distinct binding site 
on fascin-1, differing in both location and function from previously reported 
fascin-1-targeting molecules, opening exciting new avenues for selectively 
tuning fascin-1 activity in the brain.

INTRODUCTION: Although the relationship between psychiatric disorders and common 
auditory diseases has been discovered in observational studies, the causal 
linkage between them remains inconclusive.
METHODS: The bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was 
performed, drawing on the most recent and expansive genome-wide association 
studies (GWAS) data for seven psychiatric disorders and five common auditory 
diseases. Additionally, a mediation analysis was conducted using data on 731 
immune cell phenotypes and 1400 metabolite levels to explore potential mediating 
factors influencing the causal pathways.
RESULTS: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) could increase the risk of presbycusis 
(odds ratio [OR] = 1.161 [95 % confidence interval (CI), 1.042-1.295], 
P-value = 0.007) through CD25 on CD45RA- CD4 not regulatory T cell (Mediation 
effect β = 0.017), and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) could increase the risk 
of vertigo (OR = 1.215 [95 % CI, 1.043-1.415], P-value = 0.012) through CD33+ 
HLA DR+ CD14dim Absolute Count (Mediation effect β = 0.007). Alzheimer's Disease 
(AD) could reduce the risk of presbycusis through four metabolite levels related 
to lipid metabolism. And Bipolar Disorder I (BD I) could reduce the risk of 
vertigo, as well as sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) could reduce the 
risk of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).
CONCLUSION: This study underscores the intricate causal links between 
psychiatric disorders and auditory diseases. Mediation analyses indicate that 
immune cells are facilitators of positive effects, while metabolite levels play 
a protective role. These insights offer potential pathways for more effective 
clinical diagnosis and treatment.

Microglia play an important role in the immunity of the central nervous system, 
crucial in maintaining homeostasis. However, under diseased conditions, this 
cell accumulates Fe2+/3+, triggering inflammatory and neurotoxic effects that 
contribute to neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. 
Hence, the study of dysregulated microglial activation and overload of Fe2+/3+ 
is crucial in the context of neurodegenerative conditions. Emerging research has 
identified cold-sensitive ion channels, i.e., TRPM8 in microglia, which can 
regulate key subcellular functions. This study explores the regulatory function 
of the TRPM8 in Fe2+/3+ metabolism and its implications for potential 
ferroptosis in BV2 microglial cells. We used highly specific fluorescence 
probes, pharmacological modulators of TRPM8 and performed life cell imaging to 
understand the uptake of Transferrin-488, mitochondrial Fe2+-level, cellular 
Ca2+-levels in live BV2 cells under different experimental conditions. Our 
findings reveal that TRPM8 activation leads to enhanced Transferrin-488-mediated 
cytosolic Fe3+-uptake, disrupts mitochondrial superoxide levels, and promotes 
cell death. Interestingly, under inflammatory conditions induced by LPS 
treatment, TRPM8 exhibits a distinct functional role. These results position 
TRPM8 as an important regulator of microglial Fe2+/3+ metabolism. This study 
indicates the involvement of TRPM8 in overload of Fe2+/3+ leading to ferroptosis 
and potential for M1-M2 polarization in microglia. These findings impose TRPM8 
as a potential therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases, and aging.

The development of multi-targeted therapeutic agents has gained significant 
attention as a promising approach for managing Alzheimer's disease. This study 
reported the synthesis of a series of novel benzothiazole-piperazine derivatives 
and assessment of their efficacy against cholinesterase enzymes and 
anti-β-amyloid (Aβ) aggregation activity. Compound LB05 emerged as the most 
effective, demonstrating potent inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) with 
an IC50 = 0.40 ± 0.01 μM and an inhibition constant (Ki) of 0.28 μM. Enzyme 
kinetics and PI displacement assays revealed that LB05 acts as a mixed-type AChE 
inhibitor. LB05 demonstrated significant efficacy in preventing both 
self-induced and AChE-mediated aggregation of Aβ1-42. The isothermal 
calorimetric titration results indicated that LB05 exhibits a moderate binding 
affinity for Aβ. Additionally, compound LB15 demonstrated significant 
antioxidant activity, showing 50.72 % DPPH radical scavenging at a concentration 
of 25 μM along with notable metal-chelating capabilities. In-silico assessments 
suggested that these compounds possess favorable drug-like properties and 
blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability confirmed using the PAMPA-BBB assay. 
Notably, compound LB05 exhibited a strong safety profile in acute toxicity 
testing. It effectively alleviated cognitive and memory deficits in a 
scopolamine-induced amnesic model, demonstrating efficacy similar to that of 
Donepezil. Therefore, we propose that LB05 has the potential to be a promising 
lead candidate for further development as a therapeutic agent for Alzheimer's 
disease.

OBJECTIVE: This systematic review and meta-analysis examined sex and gender 
differences in caregiver burden among family caregivers of persons with dementia 
and explored variations by region and country income level.
METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive literature search was 
conducted in four databases (CINAHL, PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO), including 
studies up to December 2024. Forty-seven studies representing 24 countries were 
included in the systematic review, with 39 studies (41 effect sizes) included in 
the meta-analysis. A random-effects model was used to calculate pooled effect 
sizes (Cohen's d), and subgroup analyses were performed based on region and 
national income level.
RESULTS: Across the 47 studies, 14,919 family caregivers participated, of whom 
70 % were women. Most family caregivers were either spouses (44 %) or adult 
children (43 %). Care recipients were predominantly diagnosed with Alzheimer's 
disease. Female caregivers reported significantly greater burden than males 
(Cohen's d= 0.21, 95 % CI: 0.13-0.29, p< 0.001). Subgroup analyses showed higher 
burden in Asian countries (d= 0.27) compared to Western countries (d= 0.19), 
though the difference was not statistically significant. High-income countries 
showed greater disparities (d= 0.21) than middle-income countries (d= 0.16), 
with no significant difference. High heterogeneity was observed among Western 
and high-income countries.
CONCLUSION: Female family caregivers experience a higher burden than male 
caregivers across regions and economic settings. Although regional and 
income-level subgroup differences were not statistically significant, findings 
underscore the role of cultural and structural contexts in shaping caregiver 
burden. Gender-sensitive, context specific interventions are essential to 
address these disparities.

Atypical frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive inclusions 
(aFTLD-U) is a rare cause of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), 
characterized postmortem by neuronal inclusions of the FET family of proteins 
(FTLD-FET). The recent discovery of TAF15 amyloid filaments in aFTLD-U brains 
represents a significant step toward improved diagnostic and therapeutic 
strategies. However, our understanding of the etiology of this FTLD subtype 
remains limited, which severely hampers translational research efforts. To 
explore the transcriptomic changes in aFTLD-U, we performed bulk RNA sequencing 
on the frontal cortex tissue of 21 aFTLD-U patients and 20 control individuals. 
Cell-type deconvolution revealed loss of excitatory neurons and a higher 
proportion of astrocytes in aFTLD-U relative to controls. Differential gene 
expression and co-expression network analysis, adjusted for the shift in 
cell-type proportions, showed dysregulation of mitochondrial pathways, 
transcriptional regulators, and upregulation of the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) 
pathway, including the GLI1 transcription factor, in aFTLD-U. Overall, 
oligodendrocyte and astrocyte-enriched genes were significantly over-represented 
among the differentially expressed genes. Differential splicing analysis 
confirmed the dysregulation of non-neuronal cell types with significant splicing 
alterations, particularly in oligodendrocyte-enriched genes, including myelin 
basic protein (MBP), a crucial component of myelin. Immunohistochemistry in 
frontal cortex brain tissue also showed reduced myelin levels in aFTLD-U 
patients compared to controls. Together, these findings highlight a central role

Mutations in the genes encoding APP, Presenilin-1 (PSEN1), and PSEN2 result in 
early-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previous studies, using iPSC-derived 
neurons and/or knock-in mice, elucidated the characteristics of neurons 
expressing familial AD (fAD) mutations. Here, we employ biochemical and 
state-of-the-art fluorescence imaging assays and report the discovery of a 
unique subpopulation of wild-type neurons strikingly recapitulating key 
phenotypes previously identified in the fAD neurons, including the favored 
production of longer over shorter β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides, endo-lysosomal 
abnormalities, and increased vulnerability phenotypes in response to toxic 
insults. Importantly, mechanistic studies define inefficient γ-secretase and 
impaired endo-lysosomes as the upstream events of increased neuronal 
susceptibility. This discovery of the unique population of neurons with disease 
phenotypes would open a new avenue to develop novel therapeutics targeting 
neuronal vulnerability.

Advancements over the past decade in understanding vesicular monoamine 
transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitors highlight their key role in the treatment of 
movement and neuropsychiatric disorders. VMAT2 is crucial for packaging 
neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine into synaptic 
vesicles, facilitating their release and reuptake in synaptic transmission. 
VMAT2 inhibitors, such as tetrabenazine, deutetrabenazine, and valbenazine, show 
therapeutic efficacy in managing hyperkinetic movement disorders, including 
Huntington's disease, tardive dyskinesia, and Tourette's syndrome. These 
inhibitors modulate excessive synaptic activity by reducing neurotransmitter 
storage and release. Genetic variations, particularly in the cytochrome P450 
enzyme family, influence VMAT2 inhibitor metabolism, necessitating personalised 
dosing to optimise efficacy and minimise adverse events. Recent studies have 
provided further structural insights into VMAT2 inhibition mechanisms, paving 
the way for the development of inhibitors with enhanced potency and selectivity. 
Leveraging pharmacogenetics for precision medicine and exploring VMAT2 
inhibition in broader therapeutic contexts could revolutionise treatment 
frameworks for neurological and psychiatric conditions.

BACKGROUND: Recent studies have suggested an association between exosomal 
microRNAs (miRNAs) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, their effectiveness as 
clinical biomarkers has yet to be definitively established. This study aims to 
assess the diagnostic value of exosomal miRNAs in AD through a meta-analysis.
METHODS: As of June 10, 2025, a comprehensive literature search was conducted 
across eight databases using various search strategies to identify studies that 
met the inclusion criteria. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy 
Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool was employed to evaluate the quality of the included 
studies. Threshold heterogeneity was examined using Meta-DiSc 1.4 software. 
Stata/MP 18.0 software was used to synthesize effect sizes, including 
sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative 
likelihood ratio (NLR), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and the area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Subgroup analysis, 
meta-regression, and sensitivity analysis were conducted to explore potential 
sources of heterogeneity. Deek's funnel plot was used to assess publication 
bias.
RESULTS: A total of 14 articles (comprising 23 studies) were included, involving 
910 patients and 696 controls. The pooled SEN, SPE, PLR, NLR, DOR, and AUC were 
0.83 [95 % CI (0.77-0.88)], 0.84 [95 % CI (0.76-0.90)], 5.24 [95 % CI 
(3.32-8.26)], 0.20 [95 % CI (0.15-0.29)], 25.70 [95 % CI (12.79-51.62)] and 0.90 
[95 % CI (0.87-0.92)], respectively. The Spearman correlation coefficient was 
0.070 (P = 0.752 > 0.05), indicating an absence of threshold effect 
heterogeneity. The asymmetry test of Deek's funnel plot revealed no evidence of 
publication bias (P = 0.06 > 0.05). Subgroup analysis demonstrated enhanced 
diagnostic performance for AD using exosomal miRNAs in blood samples with a 
sample size of ≥ 50 and a specific cut-off value.
CONCLUSION: The findings of this study suggest that the expression levels of 
exosomal miRNAs are correlated with AD and may serve as potential diagnostic 
biomarkers for the disease.

To overcome the paucity of known tumor-specific surface antigens in pediatric 
high-grade glioma (pHGG), we contrasted splicing patterns in pHGGs and normal 
brain samples. Among alternative splicing events affecting extracellular protein 
domains, the most pervasive alteration was the skipping of ≤30-nt-long exons. 
Several of these skipped microexons mapped to L1-immunoglobulin cell adhesion 
molecule (IgCAM) family members, such as neuronal CAM (NRCAM). Bulk and 
single-nuclei short- and long-read RNA-seq revealed uniform skipping of NRCAM 
microexons 5 and 19 in virtually every pHGG sample. Importantly, the Δex5Δex19 
(but not the full-length) NRCAM proteoform was essential for pHGG cell migration 
and invasion in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. We developed a monoclonal 
antibody selective for Δex5Δex19 NRCAM and demonstrated that "painting" pHGG 
cells with this antibody enables killing by T cells armed with an FcRI-based 
universal immune receptor. Thus, pHGG-specific NRCAM and possibly other L1-IgCAM 
proteoforms are promising and highly selective targets for adoptive 
immunotherapies.

Studies have shown a connection between sleep disorders, mild cognitive 
impairment and dementia. In this context, the present systematic review aimed to 
determine in large studies whether sleep disturbances are modifiable risk 
factors for cognitive decline. Following the application of inclusion and 
exclusion criteria, this systematic review selected 15 studies, with large 
cohort of subjects included (more than 1000 participants), who were 
longitudinally observed. Studies predominantly used questionnaires and 
interviews to collect subjective data on sleep. Eleven studies were based on 
subjective measurements, one was based on the International Classification of 
Diseases - 9th Edition diagnosis codes, and three based on objective actigraphic 
measurements. No study used polysomnographic assessments for the evaluation of 
sleep disorders.The results of this systematic review showed that extreme sleep 
durations (either too short or too long), daytime sleepiness, circadian 
sleep-wake cycle disruption, and variation in sleep patterns are factors 
associated with an increased risk of developing cognitive decline and dementia. 
Actigraphy, as an objective instrument for monitoring the sleep-wake rhythm, 
provided further insights into the association between sleep problems and 
longitudinal cognitive decline. These findings emphasize the strong connection 
between sleep disturbances, circadian rhythm, and the risk of developing 
dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Sleep disorders may serve as an early 
indicator for cognitive decline, also considering that they may represent a 
modifiable risk factor for dementia. Therefore, recognition and treatment of 
sleep problems should be included in the prevention strategies against cognitive 
decline, opening up new opportunities for the prevention and treatment of 
cognitive impairment and AD.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Syringaresinol (SYR), a major lignan in food 
analogous TCM (Cinnamomum cassia (L.) J.Presl) possesses antioxidant, 
anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, and antiaging effects. However, its protective 
role and mechanisms in diabetes-related cognitive dysfunction (DM-AD) remain 
unclear.
AIM OF THE STUDY: We aimed to assess the protective effects of SYR on metabolic 
dysfunction associated cognitive decline through the modulation of oxidative 
stress, neuroinflammation and AMPK activation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study involved extraction of C. cassia bark and 
isolation of SYR, structurally characterized by HR-MS and 1H NMR. A DM-AD mouse 
model was established using HFD and STZ. In vivo assessments included body 
weight, food intake, fasting glucose, GTT, and ITT. Cognitive function was 
evaluated using Y-maze, MWM, and NOR tests. SYR's interaction with AMPK was 
examined through western blotting, molecular docking, and AMPK inhibitor 
experiments. Oxidative stress markers and neuroinflammatory cytokines were 
analyzed via biochemical assays and RT-PCR.
RESULTS: SYR treatments at 5 and 15 mg/kg significantly improved metabolic 
parameters by reducing body weight gain, enhancing glucose tolerance and insulin 
sensitivity, and restoring hepatic lipid balance. It also alleviated cognitive 
impairments with improved memory and learning. Mechanistically, SYR activated 
AMPK, supported by phosphorylation and molecular docking (-8.7 kcal/mol). In 
addition, SYR also enhanced antioxidant defense and suppressed neuroinflammatory 
and increased anti-inflammatory cytokines in the DM-AD brain. Co-treatment with 
the AMPK inhibitor abolished SYR's cognitive and anti-inflammatory benefits to 
confirm AMPK's key role in neuroprotective effects of SYR.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, SYR demonstrates metabolic and neuroprotective 
effects comparable to metformin, primarily through AMPK activation therefore it 
could be used as a promising natural therapeutic candidate for DM-associated AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a long-term neurological disorder associated with 
neuroinflammation and amyloid-beta (Aβ) aggregation, which leads to a decline in 
cognitive and behavioral changes. Rapamycin (Rapa) is an immunosuppressive drug 
effective in preventing organ rejection after a kidney transplant. In the last 
few years, orally delivered Rapa has emerged as a potential candidate for 
improving cognitive function in patients with AD. However, it is evident that 
long-term oral treatment of Rapa causes systemic toxicity, and although 
controversial, it may even trigger the aggregation of Aβ deposition. This study 
investigated the therapeutic potential of intranasally delivered brain-targeting 
polymeric micelles carrying Rapa. We successfully prepared Fibronectin CS1 
peptide-conjugated poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(D, L-lactic acid) 
(FibCS1-PEG-b-PLA) micelles carrying Rapa, which were 98.08 ± 1.15 nm in 
particle size with a polydispersity index of 0.21 ± 0.01. FibCS1-PEG-b-PLA 
micelles showed a significant improvement for nasal permeation of Rapa across 
RPMI-2650 epithelial cells. Behavioral studies such as corner, novel object 
recognition and Morris Water Maze tests showed promising results towards the 
improvement of cognitive function in a 3xTg-AD mice model when treated with 
intranasal FibCS1-PEG-b-PLA micelles carrying RAPA at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg 
(q4dx5). The western blot and ELISA results of the brain tissues of 3xTg-AD mice 
treated with intranasal FibCS1-PEG-b-PLA micelles carrying Rapa showed 
significant reductions in Aβ and two pro-inflammation markers (e.g. interleukin 
(IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α). Here, we conclude that brain-targeting 
FibCS1-PEG-b-PLA micelles carrying Rapa were effective in reaching the brain via 
intranasal route, reduced pro-inflammatory markers and Aβ, and improved 
cognitive function in AD-induced mice.

The brain-heart axis constitutes a critical interface in the pathogenesis of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD), yet no bioactive 
compound has been definitively identified to modulate both conditions 
simultaneously. In this study, we present the first integrative systems-level 
approach to identify and validate a multi-target natural compound from 10 South 
Korean spices targeting this axis. Among 1053 compounds curated from the spices, 
73 candidates were filtered using ADMET criteria to ensure central nervous 
system (CNS) compatibility. Target prediction analysis identified 399 genes 
associated with both AD and CVD, and subsequent topological network analysis 
prioritized five hub genes: STAT3, MAPK1, ESR1, SRC, and HSP90AA1. Artesin, a 
sesquiterpene lactone derived from ginger, showed the highest binding affinities 
(-8.0 to -8.3 kcal/mol) across all hub gene-encoded proteins. Molecular dynamics 
simulations and binding free energy analyses indicated stable interactions with 
ERα, HSP90AA1, and SRC, while MAPK1 and STAT3 exhibited greater structural 
flexibility and moderate binding affinities, reflecting their dynamic roles in 
signal transduction and transcriptional regulation. Functional module clustering 
grouped these hub genes into domains associated with inflammation, oxidative 
balance, lipid metabolism, and hormonal response, providing a mechanistic basis 
for artesin's multi-target effects. Overall, our findings suggest that artesin 
modulates convergent pathological pathways along the brain-heart axis via 
coordinated regulation of immune, metabolic, and stress-response processes. 
Further in vitro and in vivo studies are needed to validate these computational 
findings. This study highlights artesin as a promising integrative modulator of 
the brain-heart axis and underscores the utility of systems-level computational 
strategies in discovering bioactive compounds from natural products.

The currently approved drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) fail 
to address its interconnected pathological processes. Inhibition of 
butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and p38α mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38α 
MAPK) offers an innovative dual approach to mitigate two major drivers of 
neurodegeneration in AD: cholinergic deficit and neuroinflammation. Using 
structure-based drug design and a library of known p38α MAPK inhibitors, we 
developed first-in-class, selective dual BChE/p38α MAPK inhibitors with balanced 
activity against both targets. The X-ray crystal structures of the two most 
promising molecules bound to both enzymes were solved. Those ligands effectively 
reduced the production of proinflammatory markers in vitro and ex vivo in 
phytohemagglutinin/lipopolysaccharide neuroinflammation models. Remarkably, 
these compounds also significantly improved cognition in scopolamine- and 
lipopolysaccharide-induced models of cognitive dysfunction in mice. Because our 
dual-acting inhibitors target both the symptoms and the underlying 
neuropathology, they offer an innovative and comprehensive strategy to combat 
AD.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: African American individuals have a higher risk of 
Alzheimer disease (AD) and related dementia (ADRD) than non-Hispanic White 
individuals. Some cross-sectional studies with self-reported race and ethnicity 
have reported racial differences in circulating ADRD biomarkers, including 
phosphorylated tau181 (p-Tau181), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and 
neurofilament light (NfL). We aimed to examine the associations of genetically 
inferred African ancestry proportion with the longitudinal changes in these 
biomarkers and to evaluate the associations of previously identified 
ADRD-related genetic factors in European cohorts with these biomarkers in an 
African American cohort.
METHODS: This study used longitudinal data from the Family and Community Health 
Study, which was initiated in 1996, recruited and followed 889 African American 
families residing in Georgia and Iowa. Circulating p-Tau181, GFAP, and NfL were 
measured in serum samples collected in 2008 (wave 5) and 2019 (wave 8). Closely 
related individuals, genetically inferred to be third-degree relatives or 
closer, were excluded. Genetic ancestry proportions were inferred using the 
ADMIXTURE analysis. Multivariable regression analyses were performed to test the 
associations of African ancestry proportion with cross-sectional biomarker 
levels and their longitudinal changes over 11 years. We also tested the 
associations of selected genetic variants, polygenic scores, and APOE ε4 status 
with these biomarkers.
RESULTS: Our cross-sectional sample included 573 participants (mean age = 55.1 
years; 69% female), whereas our longitudinal sample included 225 (57.2 years; 
80% female). African ancestry proportion was not associated with cross-sectional 
biomarker levels but was inversely associated with the longitudinal change in 
p-Tau181 (β = -14.50 pg/mL, p = 0.02). The significant inverse association was 
robust to adjustment for age, sex, APOE ε4, socioeconomic status, physical 
activity, smoking, subjective cognitive decline, and various cardiovascular risk 
factors and comorbidities. Finally, genetic factors associated with AD and 
biomarkers in European cohorts were not associated with the 3 biomarkers in our 
African American cohort.
DISCUSSION: We found suggestive evidence that a higher African ancestry 
proportion is associated with an attenuated increase in the blood p-Tau181 level 
over time. More research is needed to characterize the longitudinal dynamics of 
ADRD biomarkers across ancestry and the driving biological or sociocultural 
factors.

BACKGROUND: The growing number of older people with Mild Cognitive Impairment 
(MCI) highlights the need for suitable and effective neuropsychological 
assessments. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment Basic (MoCA-B) is designed to 
identify MCI in individuals with lower literacy and education levels. This study 
seeks to validate the use of MoCA-B in the Persian-speaking population.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, the original English version of the 
MoCA-B test was translated into Persian using the forward-backward method. The 
study involved 60 cognitively healthy aging individuals, 30 with Alzheimer's 
disease, and 30 MCI patients. All participants met the MMSE, MoCA-B, DSM-5, and 
Albert's criteria.
RESULTS: MoCA-B scores in patients with AD were significantly lower than in the 
patients with MCI and healthy individuals (P < 0.001). They were significantly 
lower in MCI than individuals without cognitive impairment (P < 0.001). The 
cutoff score for discriminating between patients with AD/MCI and individuals 
without cognitive impairment was 20.5 (sensitivity = 95.0%, specificity = 88.3%, 
AUC = 0.972).
CONCLUSION: This study shows that the MoCA-B is a suitable screening tool for 
distinguishing persons with cognitive impairment (MCI and AD) in the 
Persian-speaking population.

Novel Thiazole-Based Compounds as Potential Beta-Site Amyloid Precursor Protein 
Cleaving Enzyme 1 Inhibitors for Alzheimer's Disease.

Alhomrani M, Alamri AS, Alsanie WF, Alsharif A, Abdulaziz O, Salih MM, Rafat BM, 
Alamri A, Chohan TA.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that causes 
significant cognitive impairment and memory loss. It is the leading cause of 
dementia on a global scale and is distinguished by the pathological build-up of 
amyloid-beta peptides and tau protein. This study presents the development of 
E-pharmacophore modeling, which utilizes reported co-crystal structure involving 
beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) to screen the 
eMolecules database.
METHODS: The present study comprehensively dealt with the virtual screening and 
structure-based prediction of thiazole compounds against BACE1 protein. To 
investigate the binding mode of virtual-screened hits (VS-hits), top 100 VS-hits 
were docked into BACE1 followed by in silico ADMET prediction. Top two VS-hits 
(CP1 and CP2) with highest docking scores along with co-crystalized ligand (CPZ) 
were further subjected to MESP, HOMO, LUMO, MD simulation, and MMGBSA analysis 
to inspect the dynamic stability of inhibitor-BACE1 complexes and the key 
molecular interaction responsible for their improved binding affinity toward 
BACE1.
RESULTS: This research identified CP1 and CP2 as top two potential novel BACE1 
inhibitors from the library of natural products, whose Glide docking scores 
range from -8.87 to -7.89 kcal/mol-1. Interestingly, both ligands were able to 
establish interactions with a set of conserved residues F108, I110, I118, L30, 
Q12, G13, G11, A335, S229, D228, G230, D32, G34, S35, and Y71. ADMET assessment 
of the selected compounds was also noted to be within acceptable ranges. The 
preliminary in-silico ADMET evaluation revealed encouraging results for all the 
modeled and in-house library compounds. The RMSD and RMSF analysis revealed that 
both ligands remained stable and maintained their interaction throughout the 
simulation time (100 nanoseconds). The MM/GBSA (ranging from -36.734 to -27.431 
kcal/mol) predicted binding affinities are in strong correlation with that of 
the docking score, which not only supports the docking results but also suggests 
that CP1 exhibits superior binding affinity towards BACE1.
CONCLUSIONS: Keeping in view these findings, CP1 might be a promising candidate 
for drug discovery against BACE1 inhibitors. The findings of this research have 
the potential to offer valuable recommendations for the advancement of novel, 
potent, and efficacious BACE1 inhibitors.

AA.

BACKGROUND: Bioinformatics, a relatively new discipline, is now widely used to 
characterize ADMET profiling and the pharmacological characteristics of real 
bio-molecules found in vegetal, helping in developing new drugs. The actual work 
aimed to simulate ADMET profile, pharmacological capacities, and cytotoxicity 
capacities of bioactive molecules identified in Tamarix africana seed extract.
METHODS: Anticholinesterase and free radical scavenging capacities with chemical 
composition and total phenol, total flavonoid, and hydrolyzable tannin of 
Tamarix africana extract seeds have been quantified. In addition, molecular 
docking methods were used against cholinesterase's enzymes. LC-MS analyses 
revealed that the presence of several compounds in T. africana extract were 
apigenin-7-O-glucoside, diosmin, neohespiridin, and rutin.
RESULTS: Acetone extract from seeds exhibited a large amount of phenolics, 
flavonoids, and hydrolyzable tannins of 703 ± 3.88 GAE/mg, 266.03 ± 3.09 QE/mg, 
and 533.77 ± 2.00 TAE/mg, respectively. T. africana extract had a significant 
inhibitory effect against DPPH (IC50 = 4.50 ± 0.66 µg/mL), which is lower than 
standards. However, extract had a modest impact against ABTS+ (IC50 = 25.45 ± 
1.74 µg/mL). Acetone extract of seeds showed higher IC50 of AChE (IC50 = 102 ± 
0.41 µg/mL), while the galantamine showed lower IC50 BChE (IC50 = 4.99 ± 1.33 
µg/mL). In silico study revealed that the biocompounds tested have notable 
cytotoxic effect.
CONCLUSIONS: Furthermore, these compounds may be pharmacologically useful. 
Molecular docking studies demon-strated that among the four tested plant-derived 
compounds, apigenin-7-O-glucoside, diosmin, neohesperidin, and rutin, 
apigenin-7-O-glucoside exhibited the highest binding affinity toward 
acetylcholinesterase (AChE), while diosmin showed the strongest interaction with 
butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). These findings underscore the therapeutic 
potential of selected plant bioactives as lead candidates in 
cholinesterase-targeted drug discovery. T. africana extract can be utilized as a 
possible source of substitute chemicals.

INTRODUCTION: Early life bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) leads to 
immediate estradiol loss and increased risk of late-life Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). We investigated risk and resilience (RandR) on the average of 5 years post 
BSO and their possible impact on subjective cognitive decline (SCD), and brain 
structure.
METHODS: A cohort in Canada (n = 333) included women with and without BSO of 
whom some reported SCD. We used multiple factor analysis, logistic regression, 
and magnetic resonance imaging to assess RandR, odds of SCD, and differences in 
gray matter volume (GMV).
RESULTS: BSO was a risk for worse neuropsychological performance, a 2-fold 
increase in the odds of SCD, and decreases in GMV in regions sensitive to 
estradiol, and important for mood, memory, and language. However, estradiol 
therapy (ETBSO), and verbal IQ mitigated this risk.
DISCUSSION: Risk of SCD exists for younger women with BSO, which affects GMV. 
Importantly, ETBSO and verbal IQ may shift that risk.
HIGHLIGHTS: Oophorectomy in early middle age may be a risk for subjective 
cognitive decline. Oophorectomy is associated with less gray matter volume in 
the prefrontal cortex. Estradiol therapy and verbal IQ might be resilience 
factors mitigating such risk.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The ketogenic diet has gained renewed attention as a 
nutritional intervention across a range of chronic diseases. This review 
evaluates the recent clinical evidence supporting ketogenic diet applications 
beyond epilepsy, with a focus on cardiometabolic, neurodegenerative, 
psychiatric, and oncological conditions.
RECENT FINDINGS: Ketogenic diet improves insulin sensitivity and glycemic 
control in obesity and type 2 diabetes, effect that are partly attributable to 
weight loss, but also include reduced postprandial glucose excursions, lower 
insulin levels, and altered substrate metabolism. In neurodegenerative diseases 
such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, ketogenic diet may increase 
substrate availability, cerebral perfusion and cognition function. Preliminary 
data from uncontrolled studies suggests potential benefits in severe mental 
illness. In oncology, ketogenic diet may influence tumor metabolism via glucose 
restriction, but clinical efficacy as an adjunct therapy remains unproven. 
Across studies, conclusions are limited by short intervention durations, 
inconsistent protocols, low dietary adherence, and high interindividual 
variability in metabolic response.
SUMMARY: Although emerging data suggest therapeutic potential of ketogenic diet 
across several conditions, routine clinical implementation is premature. Future 
trials should employ standardized dietary protocols and assess long-term, 
clinically relevant outcomes to establish safety and efficacy.

The aggregation and accumulation of oligomers of misfolded Aβ-amyloids in the 
human brain is one of the possible causes for the onset of the Alzheimer's 
disease in the early stage. We introduce and study a new ODE model for the 
evolution of Alzheimer's disease based on the interaction between monomers, 
proto-oligomers, and oligomers of Aβ amyloid protein in a small portion of the 
human brain, based upon biochemical processes such as polymerization, 
depolymerization, fragmentation and concatenation. We further introduce the 
possibility of controlling the evolution of the system via a treatment that 
targets the monomers and/or the oligomers. We observe that a combined optimal 
treatment on both monomers and oligomers induces a substantial decrease of the 
oligomer concentration at the final stage. A single treatment on oligomers 
performs better than a single treatment on monomers. These results shed a light 
on the effectiveness of immunotherapy using anti-Aβ antibodies, targeting 
monomers or oligomers. Several numerical simulations show how the oligomer 
concentration evolves without treatment, with single monomer/oligomer treatment, 
or with a combined treatment.

PURPOSE: Moderate-to-high intensity locomotor training (M-HIT) is strongly 
recommended in stroke rehabilitation, but outcomes are variable. This study 
aimed to identify baseline clinical characteristics that predict changes in 
walking capacity following M-HIT in chronic stroke.
METHODS: This analysis used data from the HIT-Stroke Trial (N = 55), which 
involved up to 36 sessions of either moderate- or high-intensity locomotor 
training. A prespecified model assessed how well baseline motor impairment 
(Fugl-Meyer lower limb motor scale [FM-LL]), comfortable gait speed (CGS), and 
balance confidence (Activities-specific balance confidence scale [ABC]) 
independently explain changes in 6-minute walk distance (∆6MWD), while 
controlling for the treatment group. Exploratory analysis tested additional 
baseline covariates using the all-possible regressions procedure. The predictive 
value of each potential covariate was assessed by its average contribution to 
the explained variance in ∆6MWD (∆pseudo-R2).
RESULTS: With the prespecified model, 8-week ∆6MWD was significantly associated 
with baseline FM-LL (β = 5.0 [95% CI: 1.4, 8.6]) and ABC (β = 0.7 [0.0, 1.4]), 
but not CGS (β = - 44.6 [-104.7, 15.6]). The exploratory analysis revealed that 
the top 7 covariates with the highest mean ∆pseudo-R2 were FM-LL, pain-limited 
walking duration, ABC, the use of an assistive device, fatigue, depression, and 
recent walking exercise history >2 days per week.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: On average, participants with less motor impairment 
and higher balance confidence exhibit greater walking capacity improvements 
after M-HIT in chronic stroke. Additional negative predictive factors may 
include pain-limited walking duration, use of an assistive device, fatigue,

Alzheimer's disease (AD) presents a formidable challenge in neurodegenerative 
medicine because of its complex pathophysiology and the absence of effective 
disease-modifying therapies. Emerging evidence suggests that impaired adult 
hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN), a dynamic process essential for cognitive 
plasticity, is a mechanistic contributor to AD progression. This review 
highlights the role of hippocampal neural stem cells (NSCs) in the pathogenesis 
of AD, including the molecular mechanisms underlying the neurogenic decline in 
AD and their potential impact on cognitive resilience. We summarize current 
therapeutic approaches, including pharmacological agents and non-pharmacological 
interventions (e.g. exercise, cognitive training, dietary strategies, and 
neurostimulation therapies), and explore their influence on neurogenesis. 
Additionally, we explore the potential application of NSCs in AD treatment, 
specifically through the use of NSC-derived extracellular vesicles (NSC-EVs) as 
a novel therapeutic modality. By integrating insights from AHN research and 
cutting-edge therapeutic advancements, this review emphasizes the therapeutic 
potential of promoting neurogenesis to address cognitive decline and advance 
treatment strategies for AD.

of Dentistry, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.

BACKGROUND: To examine whether the associations between periodontitis and 
multiple systemic conditions increase with increasing severity of periodontitis 
using a multi-center electronic health record (EHR) repository.
METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using EHR data from 9 dental 
schools in the United States. We included 264,913 adults (≥18 years) receiving 
periodontal therapy between 2013 and 2023. Periodontitis severity (no, 
mild/moderate, severe) was determined, and out of 98 systemic and behavioural 
conditions, associations with 24 conditions were evaluated using weighted uni- 
and multi-variate multinomial logistic regressions (with no periodontitis as 
reference) by 2 adjusted models accounting for age, sex, smoking, and diabetes. 
Model fit and assumptions were checked using Akaike information criterion (AIC), 
likelihood ratio test (LRT), false discovery rate (FDR) -adjusted p-values, and 
variance inflation factor (VIF) < 10. The manuscript was prepared following the 
Oral Health Statistical reporting guidelines (OHStat) and the Strengthening the 
Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines.
RESULTS: Among 264,913 adult patients, 166,207 had no periodontitis, and 98,706 
had periodontitis. In fully adjusted models of 24 selected systemic 
comorbidities, the odds ratios (ORs) for severe periodontitis consistently 
exceeded those for mild/moderate periodontitis. For instance, smoking showed ORs 
of 1.78 (mild/moderate) versus 5.21 (severe), diabetes (2.20 vs. 5.59), 
cardiovascular disease (1.53 vs. 2.21), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
(2.25 vs. 4.07), and Alzheimer's disease (1.84 vs. 3.20). Inverse correlations 
also strengthened with severity where asthma was 0.80 versus 0.72 in severe 
compared to mild/moderate periodontitis.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this population-based study demonstrate that as 
periodontitis severity escalates, positive and negative associations with 
systemic conditions become more pronounced.
PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: This study examined how various chronic health 
conditions may increase the likelihood of developing more severe gum disease, 
also known as periodontitis. Using electronic health record data from over 
260,000 adults treated at 9 U.S. dental schools, we investigated whether people 
with systemic diseases-like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-were more likely to have mild or severe 
periodontitis. The results showed that several conditions significantly 
increased the odds of having more severe gum disease. For instance, individuals 
with diabetes or cardiovascular problems had more than double the risk of severe 
periodontitis, while those with HIV or dementia showed even stronger 
associations. Some conditions, such as asthma or anorexia, were linked to lower 
odds of gum disease, suggesting that these relationships may be complex and 
deserve further study. Although this study cannot determine cause and effect, it 
highlights a pattern: people with chronic diseases are more likely to have more 
severe gum problems. This emphasizes the need for medical and dental care 
providers to work together when managing patients with chronic health issues, 
and it reinforces the importance of oral health as a part of overall well-being.

There is growing interest in the relationship between Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
and diabetes mellitus (DM), and the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) 
may be an important link between these two diseases. The role of GLP-1R in DM is 
principally to regulate glycemic control by stimulating insulin secretion, 
inhibiting glucagon secretion, and improving insulin signaling, thereby reducing 
blood glucose levels. In AD, GLP-1R attenuates the pathological features of AD 
through mechanisms such as anti-inflammatory effects, the reduction in 
amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition, the promotion of Aβ clearance, and improvements in 
insulin signaling. Notably, AD and DM share numerous pathophysiological 
mechanisms, most notably the disruption of insulin signaling pathways in the 
brain. These findings further underscore the notion that GLP-1R plays pivotal 
roles in both diseases. Taken together, these findings lead us to conclude that 
GLP-1R not only plays an important role in the treatment of DM and AD but also 
may serve as a bridge between these two diseases. Future research should focus 
on elucidating the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying the actions of 
GLP-1R in both diseases and exploring the development of GLP-1R agonists with 
dual therapeutic benefits for AD and DM. This could pave the way for innovative 
integrated treatment strategies to improve outcomes for patients affected by 
these intertwined conditions.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is heterogeneous and shows complex 
interconnected pathways at various biological levels. Risk scores contribute 
greatly to disease prognosis and biomarker discovery but typically represent 
generic risk factors. However, large-scale multi-omics data can generate 
individualized risk factors. Filtering these risk factors with brain-derived 
extracellular vesicles (EVs) could yield key pathologic pathways and vesicular 
vehicles for treatment delivery.
METHODS: A list of 460 EV-related genes was curated from brain tissue samples in 
the ExoCarta database. This list was used to select genes from transcriptomics, 
proteomics, and DNA methylation data. Significant risk factors included 
demographic features (age, sex) and genes significant for progression in 
transcriptomics data. These genes were selected using Cox regression, aided by 
the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), and were used to 
construct three risk models at different omics levels. Gene signatures from the 
significant risk factors were used as biomarkers for further evaluation, 
including gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and drug perturbation analysis.
RESULTS: Nine EV-related genes were identified as significant risk factors. All 
three risk models predicted high/low risk groups with significant separation in 
Kaplan-Meier analysis. Training the transcriptomics risk models on EV-related 
genes yielded better AD classification results than using all genes in an 
independent dataset. GSEA revealed Mitophagy and several other significant 
pathways related to AD. Four drugs showed therapeutic potential to target the 
identified risk factors based on Connectivity Map analysis.
CONCLUSION: The proposed risk score model demonstrates a novel approach to AD 
using EV-related large-scale multi-omics data. Potential biomarkers and pathways 
related to AD were identified for further investigation. Drug candidates were 
identified for further evaluation in biological experiments, potentially 
transported to targeted tissues via bioengineered EVs.

The PREVENT-AD is an investigator-driven study that was created in 2011 and 
enrolled cognitively normal older adults with a family history of sporadic AD. 
Participants are deeply phenotyped and have now been followed annually for more 
than 12 years [median follow-up 8.0 years,SD 3.1]. Multimodal MRI, genetic, 
neurosensory, clinical, cerebrospinal fluid and cognitive data collected until 
2017 on 348 participants who agreed to open sharing with the neuroscience 
community were already available. We now share a new release including 6 years 
of additional follow-up cognitive data, and additional MRI follow-ups, clinical 
progression, new longitudinal behavioral and lifestyle measures (questionnaires, 
actigraphy), longitudinal AD plasma biomarkers, amyloid-beta and tau PET, 
magnetoencephalography, as well as neuroimaging analytic measures from all MRI 
modalities. We describe the PREVENT-AD study, the data shared with the global 
research community as well as the model we created to sustain longitudinal 
follow-ups while also allowing new innovative data collection.

IMPORTANCE: The heterogeneous course of Alzheimer's disease makes it difficult 
to predict individuals' cognitive trajectories, which is particularly important 
in the era of disease modifying therapy. Identifying individuals more likely to 
have co-pathology and differing disease courses using clinically practical tools 
remains a critical gap.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate tau-clinical mismatch for identifying resilient and 
vulnerable individuals and compare levels of co-pathology and clinical 
trajectories between groups.
DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Participants were selected from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, inclusion from 2005-2024), Penn 
Alzheimer's Disease Research Center Cohort (Penn-ADRC, inclusion from 
2002-2025), and Penn Anti-amyloid Therapy Monitoring (Penn-ATM) cohort 
(inclusion from 2024-2025). All participants were amyloid-β positive, had 
clinical assessment, and measures of Tau-PET or plasma p-tau217 available.
EXPOSURES: Clinical assessment (CDR-SB) and tau burden (tau-PET or p-tau217) for 
mismatch group classification.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cross-sectional measures of neurodegeneration 
(medial temporal lobe volume and thickness, cortical thickness, TAR DNA-binding 
protein 43 [TDP-43] imaging signature), α-synuclein cerebrospinal fluid 
seed-amplification assay, longitudinal CDR-SB.
RESULTS: 365 ADNI Tau-PET participants (ages 55-93, 52.6% women) and 524 ADNI 
p-tau217 participants (ages 56-95, 49.0% women) were used to generate 
tau-clinical mismatch models with 55.6-57.1% classified as canonical (CDR-SB ~ 
Tau), 23.7-24.7% as resilient (CDR-SB < Tau), and 19.3-19.7% as vulnerable 
(CDR-SB > Tau). Groups showed diverging clinical courses with earlier cognitive 
impairment seen in vulnerable groups and later impairment in resilient groups. 
Vulnerable groups showed higher frequencies of co-pathology, with TDP-43 
neurodegeneration patterns and α-synuclein positivity. Similar findings were 
seen when applying these models to an independent dataset of 244 individuals 
(54-92 age, 57.0% women) in Penn-ADRC. Finally, these models were applied to a 
cohort receiving anti-amyloid therapy to show the utility of this method for 
predicting individual cognitive trajectories during therapy.
CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Tau-clinical mismatch identifies individuals more 
likely to harbor co-pathology and have diverging clinical trajectories. 
Plasma-based models produced similar results to Tau-PET models and could be 
replicated in independent datasets. These models provide an important tool that 
can be implemented in clinical practice to provide improved individualized 
prognosis and, potentially, monitoring of response to disease-modifying therapy.

Incremental Value of Plasma Biomarkers in Predicting Clinical Decline Among 
Cognitively Unimpaired Older Adults: Results from the A4 trial.

Khorsand B, Ghanbarian E, Rabin L, Sajjadi SA, Ezzati A.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the predictive utility of baseline plasma biomarkers and 
neuropsychological measures in identifying cognitively unimpaired older adults 
at risk of cognitive and functional decline over five years.
BACKGROUND: The clinical and biological heterogeneity observed in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) complicates design of trials and the identification of appropriate 
participants. Identifying practical tools to define more homogenous subgroups 
could enhance clinical trial enrichment and improve early detection.
METHODS: We analyzed data from the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic 
Alzheimer's Disease (A4) trial and its companion Evaluation of Amyloid Risk and 
Neurodegeneration (LEARN) observational study. The sample included 866 
cognitively unimpaired, amyloid-positive individuals from the A4 trial 
(comprising participants randomized to receive Solanezumab or placebo) and 343 
cognitively unimpaired, amyloid-negative individuals from LEARN. 
Cognitive/functional decline was defined as an increase of ≥0.5 in Clinical 
Dementia Rating-Global Score (CDR-GS) during a 240-week period. Using multiple 
logistic regression models, we evaluated the predictive value of demographic 
variables, APOE4 status, amyloid PET SUVR, plasma P-tau217, and Alzheimer's 
Disease Cooperative Study-Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite 
(ADCS-PACC) in three groups: A4-Solanezumab, A4-placebo and LEARN. In a 
sub-study including 656 participants with available data, we assessed the 
incremental value of additional plasma biomarkers (Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio, GFAP, and 
NfL).
RESULTS: Both plasma P-tau217 and ADCS-PACC significantly improved predictive 
performance over a base model with demographics and APOE4. The full model 
combining all predictor variables yielded the highest AUCs across A4 Solanezumab 
(0.80 ± 0.06), A4 Placebo (0.80 ± 0.06), and LEARN (0.78 ± 0.08). Adding other 
plasma biomarkers yielded small but consistent improvements in AUC (1-3%).
CONCLUSIONS: Plasma P-tau217 and ADCS-PACC, individually and in combination, 
improved prediction of cognitive/functional decline in asymptomatic older 
adults. Predictive models incorporating these scalable and non-invasive measures 
improved clinical trial enrichment and earlier identification of at-risk 
individuals preclinical AD.

BACKGROUND: Brain-derived tau (BD-tau) is a promising blood-based biomarker for 
neurodegeneration/brain injury in neurodegenerative and acute neurological 
disorders. However, widespread use is hampered by lack of commercial assays. We 
evaluated the analytical and clinical validity of the first commercial research 
use only BD-tau assay - the Quanterix® BD-tau Advantage PLUS.
METHODS: Using the Simoa® HD-X analyzer, we evaluated the assay's robustness, 
precision, dilution linearity, spike recovery, specificity, and limits of 
detection. Matrix effect was examined by comparing BD-tau levels in n=48 
plasma/serum and n=20 plasma/CSF sample pairs. Clinical performance was examined 
in a traumatic brain injury (TBI) cohort.
RESULTS: Twenty repeated measurements of three plasma samples gave intra- and 
inter-plate CVs ≤7.24%. A median drift of 8.00% (decrease) was observed from the 
start to the end of a full plate run. Analytically, BD-tau concentrations 
decreased linearly up to 16-fold dilution, spike recovery was 86-96%, and 
signals were highly specific to the CNS-abundant 2N4R but not the 
peripherally-enriched "big-tau" isoform. Moreover, signals were stable for up to 
four freeze/thaw cycles. Furthermore, significant correlations were observed in 
the plasma/serum (r=0.8392; p<0.0001) and plasma/CSF (r=0.6150; p=0.0039) pairs. 
Finally, CSF and plasma BD-tau was elevated in severe-acute TBI vs. 
chronic-mixed TBI and unaffected controls (p<0.0001; AUC=0.9986, and p<0.0001; 
AUC=1.000, respectively). In severe-acute TBI patients, plasma BD-tau was 
correlated with plasma p-tau217 (r=0.5761, p=0.0005), NfL (r=0.8910, p=0.0001), 
and GFAP (r=0.5424, p=0.0011). CSF BD-tau and CSF p-tau217 were strongly 
correlated (r=0.9667, p=0.0002).
CONCLUSION: BD-tau Advantage PLUS produces robust brain-derived tau-specific 
readings that demonstrate utility in detecting severe-acute TBI.

Dementia is a complex condition whose multifaceted nature poses significant 
challenges in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of patients. Despite the 
availability of large open-source data fueling a wealth of promising research, 
effective translation of preclinical findings to clinical practice remains 
difficult. This barrier is largely due to the complexity of unstructured and 
disparate preclinical and clinical data, which traditional analytical methods 
struggle to handle. Novel analytical techniques involving Deep Learning (DL), 
however, are gaining significant traction in this regard. Here, we have 
investigated the potential of a cascaded multimodal DL-based system (TelDem), 
assessing the ability to integrate and analyze a large, heterogeneous dataset 
(n=7,159 patients), applied to three clinically relevant use cases. Using a 
Cascaded Multi-Modal Mixing Transformer (CMT), we assessed TelDem's validity and 
(using a Cross-Modal Fusion Norm - CMFN) model explainability in (i) 
differential diagnosis between healthy individuals, AD, and three sub-types of 
frontotemporal lobar degeneration (ii) disease staging from healthy cognition to 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD, and (iii) predicting progression from 
MCI to AD. Our findings show that the CMT enhances diagnostic and prognostic 
accuracy when incorporating multimodal data compared to unimodal modeling and 
that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers play a key role in accurate model 
decision making. These results reinforce the power of DL technology in tapping 
deeper into already existing data, thereby accelerating preclinical dementia 
research by utilizing clinically relevant information to disentangle complex 
dementia pathophysiology.

BACKGROUND: Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) improve type 2 diabetes (T2D) 
prediction beyond clinical risk factors but perform poorly in non-European 
populations, where T2D burden is often higher, undermining their global clinical 
utility.
METHODS: We conducted the largest global effort to date to harmonize T2D 
genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analyses across five 
ancestries-European (EUR), African/African American (AFR), Admixed American 
(AMR), South Asian (SAS), and East Asian (EAS)-including 360,000 T2D cases and 
1·8 million controls (41% non-EUR). We constructed ancestry-specific and 
multi-ancestry PRSs in training datasets including 11,000 T2D cases and 32,000 
controls, and validated their performance in independent datasets including 
39,000 T2D cases and 126,000 controls of diverse ancestries. In the All of Us 
Research Program, we compared these PRSs to those from the Polygenic Score 
Catalog and assessed their ability to predict diabetes micro- and macrovascular 
complications.
FINDINGS: Ancestry-specific PRSs showed limited prediction power for T2D in AFR, 
AMR, and SAS compared to EUR and EAS. In contrast, multi-ancestry PRSs, built 
using GWAS data from five ancestries, substantially improved T2D prediction 
across all ancestries. Compared to those in the interquartile range, individuals 
at the 97·5th percentile of their PRSs had a 6-fold increased T2D risk in AMR, 
EAS, and EUR, and ≥3-fold in AFR and SAS. These PRSs were also associated with 
the development of microvascular complications and outperformed all previously 
reported PRSs for all ancestries.
INTERPRETATION: We developed and extensively validated the most up-to-date T2D 
PRSs across diverse ancestry groups. These PRSs are publicly available to 
support further evaluation of their clinical utility in diverse ancestries.

BACKGROUND: Amyloid removal has been used as a surrogate outcome in Alzheimer's 
disease trials, allowing accelerated approval of aducanumab and lecanemab. The 
A4 (Alzheimer's Clinical Trial Consortium A4/LEARN) trial's individual-level 
data supports novel methods to evaluate amyloid's validity as a surrogate for 
cognitive decline.
METHODS: In 812 participants, cognitive and functional change was measured using 
the CDR-SB score. Instrumental-variable analysis estimated the effect of amyloid 
reduction; mediation analysis quantified solanezumab's cognitive effect mediated 
by amyloid reduction.
RESULTS: Each 10 centiloid reduction due to randomization to treatment was 
associated with 0.026 higher CDR-SB (95% CI: -0.013, 0.065). 14.6% of 
solanezumab's effect on cognition was mediated by amyloid reduction (95% CI: 
-122%, 208%).
DISCUSSION: Estimates showing near-zero effects of amyloid reduction on 
cognitive decline suggest minimal impact of amyloid reduction in populations 
with little disease progression. Replication in anti-amyloid trials with larger 
treatment effects could guide treatment and regulatory decisions.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the progressive neurodegenerative diseases, 
memory impairments and multiple cognitive and behavioral deficits characterize 
that. We aimed to evaluate the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis 
of AD. It introduces the regenerative medicine approach as a novel therapeutic 
strategy based on the pathogenesis of AD that would be efficient. Our data was 
collected using databases such as the Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Google 
Scholar. We summarized the available therapeutic strategies to induce 
neurodegeneration that can increase the number of neurons and their survival and 
improve the plasticity of synapses and synaptic activity. There is a different 
approach to treatment. In first-line treatment, focusing declines the amyloid 
beta and hypophosphorylated tau protein accumulation. It inhibits 
acetylcholinesterase, but in regenerative medicine focusing on treatment via 
gene therapy, cell therapy, and tissue engineering. As a proposed solution for 
AD in recent years, the use of inhibitors of the pathogenesis of AD is known as 
a supportive therapeutic approach, but the multi-potential treatment of 
regenerative medicine has been able to provide promising results in treating 
neurodegenerative patients.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive brain disorder that affects 
neurological functioning specifically targeting cognition, memory and behaviour. 
Pathology starts with the accumulation of tau proteins which on phosphorylation 
can be destructive for brain function. With gold standard drugs like Donepezil, 
there have been several attempts made to discover adjuvant therapeutic molecules 
such as plant-based products that could not only ease the ill-toward effects of 
these drugs, but also lead to the betterment of the patients suffering from AD. 
These are crucial in the management of patients of AD, by associations with 
psychological vulnerabilities and the overall loss of health of such individuals 
'Resveratrol' is one such plant-based molecule which is a stilbene polyphenol 
present in many of the commonly occurring plants. Resveratrol is reported to 
have anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties which brings about the 
neuroprotection. Several studies have also been conducted that targets the 
signalling cascades involved during the progression of AD. This review attempts 
to give a collective information of its properties, its synthesis, metabolism 
and mechanisms that could drive researchers forward for its therapeutic 
applications during the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

Dietary protein is a critical regulator of metabolic health and aging in diverse 
species. Recent discoveries have determined that many benefits of a low protein 
diet are the result of reduced consumption of the three branched-chain amino 
acids (BCAAs), leucine, isoleucine, and valine. Intriguingly, each BCAA has 
distinct physiological and molecular effects, with restriction of isoleucine 
alone being sufficient to improve metabolic health and extend the lifespan of 
mice. While restriction of protein or all three BCAAs improves cognition in 
mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the impact of restricting each 
individual BCAA on the progression and development of AD is unknown. Here, we 
investigate the effect of restricting each individual BCAA on metabolic health, 
AD pathology, molecular signaling, and cognition in the 3xTg mouse model. We 
find that restriction of isoleucine and valine, but not leucine, promotes 
metabolic health. Restriction of each BCAA had distinct effects on AD pathology 
and molecular signaling, with transcriptomic analysis of the brain revealing 
both distinct and shared, and highly sex-specific, molecular impacts of 
restricting each BCAA. Restricting any of the three BCAAs improved short-term 
memory in males, with isoleucine restriction having the strongest effect, while 
restricting valine had the greatest cognitive benefits in females. We identify a 
set of significantly altered pathways strongly associated with reduced AD 
pathology and improved cognitive performance in males. Our findings suggest that 
restricting any of the BCAAs, particularly isoleucine or valine, may form the 
basis of a novel sex-specific approach to prevent or delay the progression of 
AD.

APOE4 genotype negates the benefits of 17β-estradiol on cerebrovascular 
endothelial and mitochondrial function.

Kehmeier MN, Famiano A, Cullen AE, Leonhardt T, Ferguson S, Snyder M, McCurdy 
CE, Tyrrell D, Alkayed NJ, Walker AE.

BACKGROUND: Postmenopausal females who carry an APOEε4 allele are at higher risk 
of late-onset Alzheimer's Disease compared to age-matched APOEε4 males. Estrogen 
deficiency predisposes females to an increased risk of vascular, cognitive, and 
metabolic impairments. While estrogen and APOE genotype are known to impact 
metabolic and mitochondrial function in the brain, their cerebrovascular effects 
are less understood. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine the 
interaction between APOE genotype and estrogen on cerebrovascular endothelial 
and mitochondrial function.
METHODS: Young female homozygous APOEε3 and APOEε4 mice (n=19-20/group; ~6 
months old) fed a high-fat diet were ovariectomized (OVX), OVX and supplemented 
with 17β-estradiol, or left intact.
RESULTS: In APOEε3 mice, OVX was associated with impaired posterior cerebral 
artery endothelium-dependent dilation, which was rescued by 17β-estradiol. 
However, in APOEε4 mice, there was no effect of OVX or 17β-estradiol on cerebral 
artery endothelial function. Carotid artery passive stiffness was greater with 
OVX and lower with 17β-estradiol treatment in APOEε3 mice, but there was no 
impact of OVX or 17β-estradiol in the APOEε4 mice. In cerebral arteries and 
arterioles, mitochondrial complexes I and I+II respiration were lower in APOEε4 
mice compared with APOEε3 mice. 17β-estradiol led to higher mitochondrial 
complex I respiration in APOEε3 but not APOEε4 mice. These functional 
differences were concomitant with group differences in mitochondrial DNA copy 
number, antioxidant enzymes, and pro-inflammatory factors. In contrast to other 
outcomes, we found that 17β-estradiol treatment was associated with lower 
cerebral artery stiffness in APOEε4 but not APOEε3 mice.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these results indicate that the APOE genotype modulates 
the impact of estrogen on the cerebral vasculature. We found that 17β-estradiol 
enhances cerebrovascular endothelial and mitochondrial function in APOEε3 mice 
but not in APOEε4 mice. The results suggest that 17β-estradiol supplementation 
has more cerebrovascular benefit for APOEε4 non-carriers.
NOVELTY & SIGNIFICANCE: What is known?: Females have twice the risk of 
Alzheimer's disease compared with males, and the APOE4 genetic variant is 
associated with a greater risk for Alzheimer's disease compared with the APOE3 
variant. The risk for Alzheimer's disease increases after menopause in females, 
suggesting that the loss of female sex hormones may play a role. There are 
highly inconsistent results among past studies examining the interaction of APOE 
genotype and estrogens on cognitive function and other brain outcomes. What new 
information does this article contribute?: Vascular outcomes were not measured 
in previous studies examining the interaction between APOE genotype and 
estrogens. As such, we aimed to determine the impact of APOE4 genotype on the 
cerebrovascular response to estradiol. We found that estradiol improved cerebral 
artery endothelial function and mitochondrial respiration in APOE3 mice 
following ovariectomy. In contrast, APOE4 mice were refractory to the beneficial 
effects of estradiol on cerebrovascular endothelial and mitochondrial function.
