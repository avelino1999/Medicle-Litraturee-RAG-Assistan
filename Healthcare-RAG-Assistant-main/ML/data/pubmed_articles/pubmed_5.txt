Alzheimer's disease, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, is characterized 
by a decline in brain volume and neuronal loss, with early symptoms often 
presenting as short-term memory impairment. Automated classification of 
Alzheimer's disease remains a significant challenge due to inter-patient 
variability in brain morphology, aging effects, and overlapping anatomical 
features across different stages. While traditional machine learning techniques, 
such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and various Deep Neural Network (DNN) 
models, have been explored, the need for more accurate and efficient 
classification techniques persists. In this study, we propose a novel approach 
that integrates Multi-Filter Stacking with the Inception V3 architecture, 
referred to as CASFI (Classifying Alzheimer's Severity using Filter 
Integration). This method leverages diverse convolutional filter sizes to 
capture multiscale spatial features, enhancing the model's ability to detect 
subtle structural variations associated with different Alzheimer's disease 
stages. Applied to MRI data, CASFI achieved an accuracy of 97.27%, outperforming 
baseline deep learning models and traditional classifiers in both accuracy and 
robustness. This approach supports early diagnosis and informed clinical 
decision-making, providing a valuable tool to assist healthcare professionals in 
managing and planning treatment for Alzheimer's patients.

Mental disorders represent a significant global health challenge, with a high 
prevalence and substantial impact on individual well-being. Neurodegenerative 
diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple 
sclerosis (MS) and various mood disorders, contribute significantly to the 
burden of neurological conditions worldwide. Identifying novel drug targets and 
exploring natural product-based molecules have become essential priorities in 
advancing treatment strategies for these complex diseases. Nanoencapsulation 
technology has emerged as a valuable tool to increase the stability, solubility, 
and bioavailability of natural products, thus improving their efficacy in 
treating neurological disorders. By encapsulating natural compounds such as 
ferulic acid (FA) in nanoscale delivery systems, researchers have aimed to 
overcome challenges related to poor solubility and bioavailability, ultimately 
enhancing therapeutic outcomes. In this review, we examine recent advancements 
focused on the therapeutic potential of FA in AD, PD, MS, brain cancer, 
depression (DP), anxiety (AX), and epilepsy (EP). Furthermore, we explored the 
use of nanoscale delivery systems to optimise the delivery of FA for improved 
treatment efficacy. We aim to inspire discoveries and innovative approaches to 
address neurological diseases by highlighting current progress and future 
directions in this field with FA.

We explore three emerging molecular pathways driving neuroinflammation in 
chronic and acute brain diseases: the EP2 receptor for prostaglandin E2, the 
CCR2 receptor for chemokine CCL2, and JAK/STAT signaling. Inflammation is now 
recognized as a causative factor in neurodegenerative disorders, with 
neuroinflammation preceding symptom onset in Alzheimer's disease and likely 
heralding the onset of epilepsy and Parkinson's disease. The EP2 receptor 
modulates immune cell activation and exacerbates inflammatory responses, while 
CCR2 regulates peripheral immune cell recruitment to sites of brain 
inflammation. JAK/STAT pathways regulate neuronal and glial function across 
brain regions and can both amplify and resolve neuroinflammatory processes. 
These three signaling pathways converge at multiple nodes-immune cell 
recruitment, cytokine amplification, and transcriptional regulation-establishing 
feedforward loops that sustain pathology in chronic diseases. Understanding 
these mechanisms and their complex interactions provides opportunities for novel 
therapeutic interventions in neurological conditions characterized by 
inflammation, potentially leading to disease-modifying treatments.

Nitric oxide (NO), an essential inorganic signaling molecule, involved in many 
physiological processes and has promising therapeutic potential Its oxidation 
product, peroxynitrite (ONOO¯), is cytotoxic, and elevated ONOO¯ levels induce 
nitroxidative stress, a factor implicated in the pathogenesis of 
neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Through 
pharmacological modulation of NO and ONOO¯ levels in human neural progenitor 
cell (hNPCs), this study explores the potential pharmaceutical interventions 
targeting the NO and the neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) pathway, 
(NO/nNOS), to prevent or reduce AD progression by restoring the [NO]/[ONOO¯] 
balance. To achieve this, metalloporphyrin nanosensors have been effectively 
employed for real-time, in-situ measurement of NO and ONOO¯ concentrations 
(200-300 nm diameter) were applied and precisely positioned 4-5 ± 1 μm from 
hNPCs membranes, enabling precise investigation of the [NO]/[ONOO¯] ratio. The 
[NO]/[ONOO¯] ratio emerged as a critical biomarker for the evaluation of nNOS 
coupling/uncoupling to the hNPC functioning/dysfunction. In healthy cells, this 
ratio was around 0.25 ± 0.005, While dysfunctional hNPCs treated to amyloid beta 
42 (Aβ42)-a hallmark of AD-caused a dramatic 94 % drop, signaling severe 
cellular dysfunction. Based on these findings, potential pharmacological 
interventions have been proposed to prevent or reduce AD progression by 
restoring the [NO]/[ONOO¯] balance. Notably, a co-treatment of sepiapterin 
(SEP), a cofactor precursor for NO synthesis, with VAS 2870 (an NADPH oxidase 
inhibitor) partially restored the ratio to 0.1, indicating improved nNOS 
function.

With the intensification of global aging, neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such 
as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease present a growing challenge, 
severely impacting patients' quality of life. Current treatments primarily offer 
symptomatic relief with limited efficacy and notable side effects, highlighting 
the need for novel therapeutic strategies. Oligosaccharides, 
low-molecular-weight carbohydrates derived from polysaccharide hydrolysis or 
synthesis, have emerged as promising multifunctional agents due to their diverse 
bioactivities. They exhibit unique advantages over conventional drugs by 
simultaneously targeting multiple pathological mechanisms: modulating gut-brain 
axis communication, suppressing neuroinflammation, enhancing autophagy, and 
inhibiting toxic protein aggregation. Their neuroprotective effects are strongly 
influenced by structural features, including glycosidic bond types, molecular 
size, and functional modifications, which collectively determine their 
biological activity and specificity. This review summarizes the therapeutic 
applications of oligosaccharides in NDs, elucidates their multifaceted 
mechanisms of action, and explores the key structure-activity relationships, 
providing a foundation for developing oligosaccharide-based interventions with 
disease-modifying potential for neurodegenerative pathologies.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a significant unmet clinical need due to its 
asymptomatic prodromal phase and multifaceted pathophysiology, which comprises 
amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques characterized by neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) of 
hyperphosphorylated tau. Conventional diagnostic methods, such as magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), detect AD only 
after extensive neuronal loss. Recent progress in chemical biology has enabled 
the creation of multifunctional small-molecule theranostic probes that integrate 
diagnostic imaging with therapeutic intervention. This review emphasizes the 
design and molecular engineering of new probes in particular, near-infrared 
(NIR) dyes, aryl quinolines, cyanine-based fluorophores, and curcumin 
derivatives, which are highly specific for Aβ and tau aggregates, penetrate the 
blood-brain barrier (BBB) effectively, and are amenable to multimodal imaging 
including near-infrared imaging (NIR) fluorescence, MRI, PET. These probes 
commonly contain donor-acceptor motifs and exhibit environment-sensitive 
fluorescence, allowing for the real-time imaging of pathological protein 
aggregation. Furthermore, we consider dual-mode probes, such as PiB-C and BTTA, 
which combine metal chelation therapy with imaging, providing a targeted 
approach to disaggregate Aβ plaques concurrently visualizing therapeutic 
effectiveness. Through the combination of synthetic chemistry, molecular 
imaging, and neurotherapeutics, this transdisciplinary approach outlines a 
promising new paradigm for early AD detection and treatment. The development of 
these small-molecule theranostics presents new opportunities for personalized 
medicine in treating neurodegenerative diseases.

Lipid-mediated effects play a crucial role in elucidating the pathological 
mechanisms linking the ε4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE ε4) to 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, traditional mediation analysis methods often 
suffer from insufficient statistical power in studies involving minority 
populations due to limited sample sizes. This study innovatively develops a 
high-dimensional mediation analysis model (TransHDM) based on a transfer 
learning framework. By leveraging information from source data with large-scale 
samples, it significantly enhances the ability to identify potential mediators 
in small sample target data. The method first constructs a high-dimensional 
regression model using aggregated data from the source data and target data, 
then applies transfer regularization to adjust for heterogeneity between the 
source and target domains, correcting for estimation bias in high-dimensional 
Lasso. Ultimately, it achieves parameter transfer across domains, addressing 
statistical bias and inferential uncertainty caused by small sample sizes. 
Simulation results demonstrate that, compared to traditional methods, this 
approach significantly improves the power in identifying true mediator variables 
while effectively controlling the family-wise error rate in multiple testing. 
When applied to the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort, TransHDM 
transferred large-scale data from white and other ethnic groups, identifying 
additional lipid metabolic pathways mediating the influence of the APOE ε4 
allele on AD pathological progression in African American populations compared 
to pre-transfer analysis. These pathways include glycerophospholipid metabolism, 
glycerolipid metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism, and ether lipid metabolism 
(false discovery rate < 0.05). The TransHDM framework not only provides a 
powerful methodological tool for small sample population research but also 
offers valuable insights for future research in exploring disease mechanisms and 
developing biomarkers for disease prediction.

BACKGROUND: Postoperative cognitive decline (POCD) and dementia are significant 
risks in older patients after surgery. Dexmedetomidine, an α2-adrenergic 
agonist, has shown neuroprotective properties in preclinical models, but its 
role in preventing dementia in postoperative patients remains unexplored.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from Taiwan's 
National Health Insurance Research Database from 2012 to 2020. The cohort 
included 59 194 older patients (≥70 years) who underwent hip fracture surgery. 
Patients were categorised based on postoperative dexmedetomidine use. The 
primary outcome was the incidence of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease 
(ad) and vascular dementia (VaD), assessed using multivariable Cox regression 
models adjusted for confounders. Competing risk analysis was also performed.
RESULTS: Patients administered dexmedetomidine postoperatively had a 
significantly lower risk of dementia compared to those who did not receive the 
drug [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 0.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45-0.60]. 
The reduction in ad risk was more pronounced (aHR 0.38, 95% CI 0.30-0.47) 
compared to VaD (aHR 0.58, 95% CI 0.49-0.68). These effects persisted after 
adjusting for confounders, including age, sex, comorbidities, and socioeconomic 
factors.
CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to provide clinical evidence supporting 
dexmedetomidine's potential in reducing dementia risk, particularly ad, in older 
postoperative patients. Further randomised trials are needed to confirm these 
findings and determine the optimal use of dexmedetomidine in postoperative care. 
If validated, dexmedetomidine could become a critical strategy in reducing the 
long-term cognitive burden in ageing populations.

The Quest for Cure of "Alzheimer's": Reimagining the Goal by Changing Culture.

Whitehouse P, George DR, Riegal C.

This essay explores personal and cultural meaning in dementia through the 
respective stories of biomedicine, public health, and alternative worldviews, 
using Indigenous perspectives as a critical example. Since Alzheimer's 
visibility as a biomedical illness intensified in the 1970s, the disease has 
generated powerful narratives of scientific cure that are now limiting public 
discourse and appropriate social and ecological action. In this essay, our 
approach is rooted in the recognition that stories in their many forms (oral, 
written, embodied, and visual) and their associated metaphors create the 
semantic webs of words and actions that endow human beings with meaning. New 
stories from less medicalized spaces can both challenge the often-unrecognized 
limits and damaging behaviors of profit-driven, scientific reductionism and 
revitalize public and ecological health approaches based on expanded worldviews 
of individual, social, environmental, and indeed planetary health.

Yoga, Meditation, and Mindfulness for Treatment of Traumatic Brain Injury: A 
Scoping Review.

Ehrhardt AC(1), Rogatzki MJ(2).

Author information:
(1)Duke University, Department of Surgery, Durham, North Carolina, USA.

Boone, North Carolina, USA.

Objective: The objective of this scoping review was to analyze research using 
yoga, meditation, and mindfulness (YMM) as a treatment for traumatic brain 
injury (TBI). Introduction: The rationale for this review was to provide an 
understanding of the methodology and outcome measures used in studies that 
include YMM as TBI treatment. There are currently no reviews that investigate 
how all three of these modalities are used in TBI treatment. This review is 
meant to draw attention to how this research is done and potentially improve 
future research study design. Inclusion Criteria: Criteria for studies included 
in this review were developed according to the participants, concept, and 
context framework. Specifically, participants must have experienced a TBI, the 
TBI had to be treated with yoga, mindfulness, meditation, or some combination of 
the three, subjects could not exclusively have had acquired brain injury such as 
stroke or Alzheimer's disease, and the study must have been published in the 
English language. Methods: PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science, 
Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, PsyArXiv, ProQuest, 
and LoveYourBrain were searched for articles that met our criteria. A total of 
72 articles were extracted to address 15 variables. Results: The majority of 
studies used either a pre-post or exploratory study design with no more than 29 
female Caucasian subjects in the age range of 45-54 years. Most subjects 
participated in the study one month since their mild to severe TBI. In order to 
treat TBI symptoms, most studies used mindfulness, with the treatment done in 
person. Sessions of treatment typically occurred on a weekly basis for 10-30 min 
over 7-8 weeks. Outcome measures used to determine efficacy of treatment were 
primarily quality of life, followed by cognitive function and depression. Most 
studies were conducted in the United States after 2010 in the journal Brain 
Injury with no type of funding. Conclusions: Studies using YMM for treatment of 
TBI are typically done on a single type of population with a wide range of 
outcome variables and no control group. Future research may aim to include a 
control group and a variety of outcome measures consistent with those used in 
previous studies for result comparisons.

nervous system, lncRNAs play crucial roles in neural development by modulating 
transcriptional, epigenetic, and post-transcriptional processes. This review 
summarizes recent advances in understanding how lncRNAs regulate the 
differentiation of stem cells, including embryonic stem cells and neural stem 
cells, by interacting with transcription factors, chromatin regulators, and 
microRNAs. LncRNAs influence neurogenesis by determining the fate of neural 
progenitors, controlling the timing of differentiation, and balancing 
self-renewal. In addition to their role in neural differentiation, lncRNAs also 
play critical roles in various neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's 
disease, Parkinson's disease, and glioblastoma, where their dysregulation 
contributes to neuroinflammation, synaptic dysfunction, and tumor progression. 
These findings highlight the potential of lncRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers and 
therapeutic targets for neurological disorders. Despite challenges in delivery 
and functional characterization, targeting disease-associated lncRNAs offers 
promise for regenerative medicine and precision treatments. A deeper 
understanding of lncRNA-mediated regulatory networks could lead to novel 
therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative and neuro-oncological diseases.

PURPOSE: Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is the main cause of the increasing end-stage 
renal disease (ESRD) patients worldwide. Podocytes are considered the crucial 
cells involved in the progression of NS, and their damage can directly lead to 
proteinuria. The objective of this study was to explore the protective effects 
of xanthohumol (XN) on podocyte injury.
METHODS: Adriamycin (ADR)-induced podocyte injury in vivo and in vitro models 
were established to explore the effects of XN on adriamycin nephropathy (AN) by 
urine and serum biochemical assay, periodic acid-schiff (PAS) staining, 
immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, western blot, and real-time 
quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR).
RESULTS: The results showed that XN could upregulate the expressions of podocyte 
specific marker Wilms' tumor protein 1 (Wt1), and glomerular filtration related 
functional proteins such as Nephrin, Synaptopodin, Zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1), 
and Crumbs2 (Crb2) as well as downregulate the expression of podocyte injury 
marker Desmin in ADR-treated podocytes to restrain the podocyte actin 
cytoskeleton disruption.
CONCLUSION: Our study showed that XN treatment significantly attenuated 
ADR-induced podocyte injury, suggesting that XN may be a potential therapy 
option for patients with NS.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by tau pathology, 
leading to neurodegeneration. Astrocytes regulate central nervous system 
homeostasis and influence AD progression. The APOE3-Christchurch (APOE3-Ch) 
variant is linked to AD resilience, but its protective mechanisms remain 
unclear.
METHODS: Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived astrocytes (APOE3-Ch and 
wild type) were used to assess tau uptake, clearance, lipid metabolism, and 
transcriptomic adaptations. Fluorescently labeled 2N4R-P301L tau oligomers were 
tracked, and pathway-specific inhibitors dissected tau clearance mechanisms. 
Lipidomic and transcriptomic analyses were performed to identify 
genotype-specific adaptations.
RESULTS: APOE3-Ch astrocytes exhibited enhanced tau uptake via heparan sulfate 
proteoglycan- and lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1-mediated pathways and 
superior clearance through lysosomal and proteasomal degradation. They exported 
less tau, limiting propagation. Transcriptomic analyses revealed upregulation of 
genes involved in cell projection assembly and endocytosis. Lipidomic profiling 
showed reduced ceramides and gamma-linolenic acid, linked to decreased 
neuroinflammation and ferroptosis.
DISCUSSION: APOE3-Ch astrocytes promote tau clearance and metabolic adaptations, 
providing insights into genetic resilience in AD and potential therapeutic 
targets.
HIGHLIGHTS: APOE3-Christchurch (APOE3-Ch) astrocytes exhibit significantly 
increased tau internalization compared to wild-type astrocytes, facilitated by 
upregulated heparan sulfate proteoglycan and low-density lipoprotein 
receptor-related protein 1 pathways. APOE3-Ch astrocytes demonstrate more 
efficient tau degradation via both lysosomal and proteasomal pathways, while 
exporting significantly less tau, potentially reducing tau propagation in the 
central nervous system. APOE3-Ch astrocytes show upregulation of genes involved 
in cell projection assembly and endocytosis, suggesting structural and 
functional modifications that enhance tau processing. Lipidomic profiling 
reveals reduced ceramide levels and gamma-linolenic acid downregulation in 
APOE3-Ch astrocytes, alterations linked to reduced neuroinflammatory and 
ferroptotic activity, contributing to the protective phenotype.

The aggregation of tau into amyloid fibrils is associated with Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) and related tauopathies. Since different tauopathies are 
characterized by the formation of distinct tau fibril morphologies, it is 
important to combine the search of tau aggregation inhibitors with the 
development of in vitro tau aggregation assays that recapitulate aggregation as 
it may occur in the brain. Here we address this problem by reporting an in vitro 
tau aggregation assay in which AD brain homogenates are used to seed the 
generation of first-generation tau fibrils in a polymorph-specific manner under 
quiescent conditions. These fibrils are then used to create amyloid seed 
libraries from which second-generation kinetic assays can be readily performed. 
Using this strategy, we illustrate an iterative machine learning method for the 
identification of small molecules for the polymorph-specific inhibition of the 
in vitro formation of tau fibrils. We further show that the small molecules 
selected by this procedure are potent inhibitors in a Drosophila tauopathy 
model.

Astrocytes and metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) have emerged as 
pivotal regulators of synaptic homeostasis and neural communication within the 
central nervous system (CNS). Although mGluR5 has long been considered 
neuron-specific, its functional expression in astrocytes is now recognized as 
essential for calcium (Ca2+) signaling, gliotransmission, and the modulation of 
synaptic plasticity. Dysregulation of astrocytic mGluR5 is increasingly 
implicated in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders 
including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), depression, 
anxiety, and schizophrenia (SCZ) by promoting neuroinflammation, excitotoxicity, 
and synaptic dysfunction. In this review, we explore the emerging role of 
astrocytic mGluR5 in mediating astrocyte-neuron communication and its 
maladaptive regulation in disease contexts. We also assess the therapeutic 
potential of targeting astrocytic mGluR5, highlighting advances in 
pharmacological modulators, gene therapy, and RNA-based strategies aimed at 
restoring homeostatic function. Despite recent progress, critical knowledge gaps 
remain, particularly regarding the regional specificity of astrocytic mGluR5 
effects, its crosstalk with other signaling pathways, and its contribution to 
chronic neuroinflammation. Addressing these challenges may unlock innovative 
astrocyte-targeted therapies to restore synaptic integrity and protect against 
neurodegeneration in CNS disorders.

There is a steadily increasing global burden of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) 
such as dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), and movement disorders 
like Parkinson's disease (PD), which emphasizes the importance of 
disease-modifying therapy (as opposed to symptomatic therapy). This review 
considers a new disease-modifying strategy through the so-called glucagon-like 
peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) in these NDs, and the mechanistic 
rationale and evidence base. The review considers a multi-targeting strategy, 
translational issues, and a future research agenda. Translational challenges for 
these agents are also discussed, particularly the need to understand how the 
timing of treatment may influence outcomes. The review also considers unwanted 
side effects like unintended weight loss, which may compromise "at-risk" patient 
groups. In conclusion, GLP-1 RAs are an intriguing multitarget treatment option 
for people with NDs, and future research should focus on optimizing treatment 
for clinical trials, evolved agonists that can penetrate the central nervous 
system (CNS), and combination therapies.

receptor expression.

Presenilin 2 (PSEN2) gene variants increase the risk of early-onset Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). AD patients with PSEN2 variants have increased risk of unprovoked 
seizures versus age-matched healthy controls, yet few studies have interrogated 
PSEN2 contributions to seizures, and fewer have done so with aging. PSEN2 
variant mice also do not exhibit amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation, allowing for the 
assessment of Aβ-independent contributions to seizure risk in AD. Critically, 
PSEN proteolytic capacity may regulate hippocampal kainate-type glutamate 
receptors (KARs), with PSEN deletion reducing KAR availability and synaptic 
transmission in vitro (Barthet et al 2022). Kainic acid (KA) is a naturally 
occurring KAR agonist that acutely evokes severe seizures in mice. We thus 
hypothesized that PSEN2 knockout (KO) mice would have reduced latency to acutely 
evoked seizures and status epilepticus (SE), increased convulsive SE burden, 
worsened 7-day survival, and altered hippocampal KAR expression vs age-matched 
wild-type (WT) mice. Using a repeated low-dose systemic KA administration 
paradigm, we quantified the latency to acute seizures and convulsive SE, then 
quantified neuropathology in 3-4-month-old and 12-15-month-old male and female 
PSEN2 KO versus WT mice. GluK2 and GluK5 KAR subunit expression was colocalized 
in astrocytes and neurons by immunohistochemistry 7 days after KA-SE or sham-SE 
to define the interaction between PSEN2 loss and acute seizures on hippocampal 
KARs. Regardless of sex, young PSEN2 KO mice were more susceptible to KA-induced 
acute seizures than WTs. Young PSEN2 KO mice of both sexes also entered SE 
sooner than age-matched WT mice. In aged mice, there was no significant 
difference in latency to first seizure or SE onset between genotypes in either 
sex. However, regardless of genotype, aged females entered SE sooner than young 
females and experienced greater mortality. This was not observed in males. Among 
young animals, there was no difference in KAR expression between genotypes and 
regardless of treatment group. In both genotypes, hippocampal CA3 astrocytes 
expressed GluK5 following KA-SE, however, astrocytic GluK2 expression only 
occurred in WT mice. GluK5 expression was significantly reduced in untreated 
aged PSEN2 KO mice versus untreated WT mice, while total GluK2 expression did 
not differ between genotypes or seizure groups. Following KA-SE, astrocytic 
GluK5 expression was only present in WT animals in CA3, while both genotypes 
presented with astrocytic GluK5 expression. This study highlights that KARs are 
an understudied contributor to seizures in aging and AD that warrant further 
investigation.

Cerebrovascular disease is a major but poorly understood feature of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). The strongest genetic AD risk factor, APOE4, is associated with 
cerebrovascular degeneration, including vascular amyloid deposition and 
fibrosis. To uncover how APOE4 promotes cerebrovascular pathology, we generated 
a single-cell transcriptomic atlas of human brain vasculature. In APOE4 
carriers, pericyte abundance was significantly reduced and accompanied by the 
emergence of a myofibroblast-like cell population co-expressing contraction and 
extracellular matrix genes. Immunostaining confirmed non-vascular myofibroblasts 
in APOE4 human and mouse brains. We show that APOE4 pericytes transition into 
myofibroblasts that secrete fibronectin, which promotes vascular amyloid 
accumulation. Computational and experimental analyses identified elevated TGF-β 
signaling as the driver of this pericyte-to-myofibroblast transition. Inhibition 
of TGF-β restored pericyte coverage and reduced vascular fibrosis and amyloid to 
APOE3 levels, revealing a targetable mechanism linking APOE4 to cerebrovascular 
pathology in AD.

Patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) often experience neuropsychiatric symptoms, 
particularly anxious-depressive symptoms and sleep disturbances. These symptoms 
are associated with various factors related to AD, including amyloid-β and tau 
pathology, neurodegeneration, and cognitive decline, at different stages of the 
disease. However, it remains unclear whether anxious-depressive symptoms and 
sleep disturbances are merely symptoms or contribute as risk factors in the 
development and progression of AD. Consequently, there is a pressing need for a 
timely and informed discussion regarding these disturbances in AD. Here we 
discuss the most recent developments in understanding the etiology of 
anxious-depressive symptoms and sleep disturbances in AD, with a focus on how 
these symptoms interact with AD biomarkers to influence cognitive decline. 
Furthermore, we propose models of connections between anxious-depressive 
symptoms and/or sleep disturbances, AD biomarkers and cognition, aiming to 
inspire potential treatment plans for addressing these symptoms and exploring 
their impact on AD pathology and cognitive decline.

An Update of the Treatment Landscape for Alzheimer's Disease: From Symptomatic 
Treatments to the Emergence of Amyloid-Targeting Therapies.

Several approved Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatments help manage its associated 
cognitive symptoms (e.g., donepezil and memantine) or non-cognitive symptoms. 
However, disease-modifying AD therapies have recently emerged. These treatments 
aim to slow disease progression by targeting the pathology associated with 
progressive neurodegeneration. Specifically, two amyloid-targeting therapies 
(ATTs) are currently approved and available for use in the United States: the 
monoclonal antibodies donanemab (Kisunla™) and lecanemab (Leqembi®). Both 
treatments can slow disease progression and cognitive and functional decline in 
patients with mild cognitive impairment/mild dementia due to AD, but they are 
associated with class-based safety concerns, notably amyloid-related imaging 
abnormalities (ARIA). Because advanced practice providers (APPs) such as 
physician assistants and advanced practice nurses are key to AD patient care, 
they should be familiar with the biological continuum of AD and with ATTs and 
understand how to monitor and manage patients receiving these treatments. 
Therefore, this review aims to educate APPs about these new therapies. 
Specifically, it summarizes the approved indications and dosing for donanemab 
and lecanemab, as well as key clinical evidence of efficacy and safety. It also 
outlines practical considerations around the monitoring and management of 
patients treated with ATTs, including recommendations about treatment duration, 
adverse reaction management, and patient counseling.

In the twenty-first century, cognitive impairment is a significant health 
problem. Function is substantially impaired by a number of neuropsychiatric and 
neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinsonism, schizophrenia, major 
depressive disorder, Alzheimer's disease and other types of cognitive 
impairment, cerebrovascular disabilities, seizure-related disorders, and brain 
traumas. Over time, a number of chemical messengers and signaling molecules have 
been identified as potential targets for treatment, and tests have been 
performed against these targets using both conventional and novel chemicals. 
Phytochemicals derived from medicinal plants are essential for preserving the 
chemical balance of the central nervous system because they change the activity 
of major inhibitory receptors that receive neurotransmitters. Many herbs have 
been used in conventional medicine to treat cognitive problems. Although the 
presence of receptors that are responsible or transporters for compounds called 
polyphenols and other phytochemicals in brain regions remains to be determined, 
multiple target substances seem to be a promising class of treatment options for 
treating disorders with multifactorial origins. Additional studies suggest that 
flavonoids possess significant anti-inflammatory properties in the brain, making 
them a promising therapeutic option for conditions such as ischemic or

BACKGROUND: With the progressive population aging, dementia is reaching epidemic 
dimensions worldwide. Non-pharmacological music-based interventions can have a 
positive impact on the rehabilitation of older adults with dementia. 
Nevertheless, there are few longitudinal cross-national studies testing their 
impact.
OBJECTIVES: This pilot study aims at shedding light on the effects of the SOUND 
person-centered music-based intervention on well-being, cognition, executive 
functions and mood of older adults with mild-moderate dementia in three European 
countries.
METHODS: An original intervention consisting in 12 sessions of active and 
passive music activities (singing, rhythmic exercises with Orff's tools, 
narratives elicited by music, etc.), led by a trained facilitator, was 
implemented in Italy, Portugal and Romania with 41 older adults with 
mild-moderate dementia attending elder facilities. Data on well-being, 
cognition, executive functions and mood of participants were collected before, 
at the end and two weeks after the intervention through psychometric tools. 
Temporal comparisons were assessed by T-test for paired samples.
RESULTS: The SOUND intervention significantly improved participants' well-being, 
cognition and executive functions over time and remained stable at the follow-up 
at cross-national level. The potential of the intervention on mood is not clear 
due to depression and anxiety increasing among Romanian participants.
CONCLUSIONS: Cross-national, longitudinal, multidisciplinary mixed-method 
studies demonstrating the effects of music-based rehabilitative interventions 
for older adults with mild-moderate dementia are encouraged to shape innovative 
treatments as well as to identify possible adverse effects on participants' mood 
linked to scarcity of coping capabilities as source of distress in older 
individuals.

BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that lipoprotein metabolism play a crucial role in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, their involvement in late-onset AD (LOAD) 
remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to uncover potential associations between 
lipoprotein metabolism and clinical LOAD diagnosis, cognitive function, and 
treatment.
METHODS: We performed a lipidomic analysis of plasma samples from 46 individuals 
with LOAD and 16 healthy controls to investigate the potential association 
between lipoprotein profiles, LOAD diagnosis and cognitive function. Then, we 
conducted a protein-protein interaction analysis to explore the potential 
therapeutic role of lipoprotein molecules in LOAD.
RESULTS: Our findings revealed that ApoA2 and HDL ApoA2 may be negatively 
associated with LOAD risk (odds ratio [OR] = 0.798, 95% confidence interval 
[CI] = 0.654-0.973, p = 0.026; OR = 0.785, 95% CI = 0.634-0.972, p = 0.026, 
respectively), while LDL-3 triglycerides showed a potential positive association 
(OR = 6.051, 95% CI = 1.789-20.470, p = 0.004). Additionally, HDL-4 ApoA1 may be 
positively correlated with cognitive function in LOAD (p = 0.047, r² = 0.087). 
Moreover, our findings suggest that ApoA2 may interact with targets of approved 
AD drugs.
CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies potential key lipoprotein alterations 
associated with LOAD diagnosis and cognitive function, emphasizing the role of 
lipidomic insights in understanding and treating LOAD.

BACKGROUND: Riboflavin (vitamin B2), a precursor of flavin mononucleotide (FMN) 
and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), is essential for mitochondrial function, 
redox balance, and neuronal viability. Impairments in riboflavin transport and 
metabolism contribute to a growing spectrum of neurological diseases.
OBJECTIVE: This review provides a comprehensive update on the therapeutic 
applications, metabolic mechanisms, and gene-based strategies involving 
riboflavin in neurological disorders.
METHODS: We systematically analyzed clinical and experimental studies published 
between 2012 and 2025, focusing on riboflavin-responsive conditions and 
molecular mechanisms relevant to neurological pathology.
RESULTS: Riboflavin supplementation-particularly in high doses-has demonstrated 
substantial efficacy in conditions such as riboflavin transporter deficiency 
(RTD), multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD), and migraine. Emerging 
data suggest potential benefit in Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, 
multiple sclerosis, and acute brain injury. Mechanistically, riboflavin supports 
mitochondrial bioenergetics, antioxidant systems, and epigenetic regulation. 
Recent advances in gene therapy and pharmacological chaperones targeting 
riboflavin-dependent pathways offer promising therapeutic directions.
CONCLUSION: Riboflavin is evolving from a conventional micronutrient into a 
multifaceted therapeutic agent in neurology. Integration of gene-based 
approaches, targeted delivery systems, and biomarker-guided interventions may 
establish riboflavin as a key component of precision medicine strategies for 
neurological disorders.

Background: Lysosomal dysfunction could be an underlying cause of Alzheimer's 
disease, with Tau oligomer being an important inducer or amplifier of lysosomal 
stress associated with the disease. Tau oligomer is a well-known substrate of 
autophagy, and selective degradation of Tau with Tau-specific autophagy degrader 
might be feasible. Methods: Tau-specific autophagic degraders were synthesized 
by combining leucomethylene blue, linkers and a lysosomal degradation tag 
(Autac). Tau clearance and changes of Tau-mediated lysosomal stress by these 
degraders were studied in vitro. In vivo effects of a Tau-specific degrader were 
investigated employing a combined Tau/Aβ mutant mouse model characterized by an 
accelerated onset of neurological deficits. Human relevance was investigated 
using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neuronal cells from an 
Alzheimer's disease patient. Results: Among Tau-specific Autac degraders, 
TauAutac-3 (TA-3) efficiently degraded Tau oligomer and monomer, an effect 
inhibited by bafilomycin A1, suggesting lysosomal Tau degradation. TA-3 
treatment induced LC3, K63, OPTN or NDP52 puncta, which was partially 
colocalized with Tau oligomer. Signs of lysosomal stress, such as galectin-3 
puncta, pHluorin fluorescence, altered lysosomal pH and CHMP2B recruitment, 
induced by Tau expression were reversed by TA-3. Autophagy impairment by Tau 
expression in vitro, likely due to lysosomal stress, was also reversed by TA-3. 
In vivo, TA-3 administration markedly reduced the accumulation of both Tau and 
Aβ in 6xTg mice, which was associated with amelioration of Tau-mediated 
lysosomal stress and autophagy impairment. Neuroinflammation characterized by 
increased numbers of GFAP+ glial cells and Iba1+ microglial cells, was also 
reduced following TA-3 administration. TA-3 remarkably improved neurologic 
deficits in 6xTg mice, such as impaired memory and reduced exploratory behavior. 
TA-3 reduced Tau and phospho-Tau accumulation in iPSC-derived neuronal cells 
from an Alzheimer's disease patient. Conclusion: These results suggest that 
Tau-specific autophagic (Autac) degraders could serve as novel therapeutic 
agents for Alzheimer's disease through reduction of Tau-mediated lysosomal 
stress.

Neurodegenerative disorder Alzheimer's disease (AD) has progressive 
characteristics and leads to severe cognitive impairment that reduces life 
quality. Disease management along with effective intervention depends on the 
detailed diagnosis conducted early. The proposed framework builds an ensemble 
system from ResNet-50 and EfficientNet-B3 to conduct automated AD diagnostics by 
processing high-resolution Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images. The proposed 
model uses ResNet-50 to extract features coupled with EfficientNet-B3 as its 
robust classifier which achieves high accuracy alongside generalization 
performance. A large, high-quality dataset comprising 33,984 MRI images was 
used, ensuring diverse representation of different disease stages: the study 
included participants with four dementia stages organized as Mild, Moderate, 
Non-demented, and Very Mild Demented. The research applied several comprehensive 
data preprocessing methods combining normalization steps with rescaling 
algorithms alongside noise elimination techniques to achieve enhanced 
performance. Performance tests on the model required examination of accuracy 
along with precision and recall metrics and F1-score and ROC curve area 
measurements. The ensemble model delivered remarkable overall accuracy reaching 
99.32% while surpassing separate deep learning architectures. The confusion 
matrix evaluation results showed superb classification results for Mild and 
Moderate stages along with non-dementia cases while maintaining minimal Wrong 
choices in Very Mild Demented cases. Experimental findings demonstrate the 
strength of deep learning algorithms to detect AD disease stages accurately. The 
robust and accurate performance of the proposed model indicates it has potential 
for use in medical environments to support radiologists in their work of 
early-stage AD screening and treatment development. Additional research in 
diverse clinical environments will strive to optimize and validate the model so 
it can meet real-world diagnostic requirements for medical use.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition and the most common 
form of dementia. Recent developments in AD treatment call for robust diagnostic 
tools to facilitate medical decision-making. Despite progress for early 
diagnostic tests, there remains uncertainty about clinical use. Structural 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as a readily available imaging tool in the 
current AD diagnostic pathway, in combination with artificial intelligence, 
offers opportunities of added value beyond symptomatic evaluation. However, MRI 
studies in AD tend to suffer from small datasets and consequently limited 
generalizability. Although ensemble models take advantage of the strengths of 
several models to improve performance and generalizability, there is little 
knowledge of how the different ensemble models compare performance-wise and the 
relationship between detection performance and model calibration. The latter is 
especially relevant for clinical translatability. In our study, we applied three 
ensemble decision strategies with three different deep learning architectures 
for multi-class AD detection with structural MRI. For two of the three 
architectures, the weighted average was the best decision strategy in terms of 
balanced accuracy and calibration error. In contrast to the base models, the 
results of the ensemble models showed that the best detection performance 
corresponded to the lowest calibration error, independent of the architecture. 
For each architecture, the best ensemble model reduced the estimated calibration 
error compared to the base model average from (1) 0.174±0.01 to 0.164±0.04, (2) 
0.182±0.02 to 0.141±0.04, and (3) 0.269±0.08 to 0.240±0.04 and increased the 
balanced accuracy from (1) 0.527±0.05 to 0.608±0.06, (2) 0.417±0.03 to 
0.456±0.04, and (3) 0.348±0.02 to 0.371±0.03.

OBJECTIVES: To explore the underlying mechanism of "Tongdu Qishen" acupuncture 
(dredging the Govern Vessel and normalizing mental activities) in treating SAMP8 
mice from the perspective of pyroptosis.
METHODS: Six-month-old male SAMP8 mice were randomly divided into model and 
"Tongdu Qishen" acupuncture (EA) groups, with 12 mice in each group. SAMR1 mice 
of the same age (n=12) were used as the normal group. In the EA group, EA (2 
Hz/50 Hz, 20 min) was applied to "Baihui" (GV20) and "Yintang" (GV24+), and 
pricking bleeding was applied to "Shuigou" (GV26). The treatment was performed 
once a day, for a total of 28 days. Morris water maze test was used to evaluate 
the learning and memory ability of mice, and HE staining was used to observe the 
morphology of cells in the hippocampus and cortex. Nissl staining was used to 
observe the number of neurons in the hippocampus and cortex. 
Immunohistochemistry was used to observe the expressions of Aβ1-40, interleukin 
(IL)-1β and IL-18 in the hippocampus and cortex. The co-staining of TUNEL and 
Caspase-1 was detected by immunofluorescence. Western blot and real-time 
quantitative PCR were used to observe the protein and mRNA expression levels of 
Nod-like receptor 3 (NLRP3), Caspase-1 and Gasdermin D (GSDMD) in the 
hippocampus and cortex, respectively.
RESULTS: Behavioral results showed that compared with the normal group, the 
escape latency was prolonged (P<0.001), the dwell time in the original platform 
quadrant and the times of crossing the original platform were considerably 
decreased (P<0.001) in the model group. In comparison with the model group, the 
escape latency was shortened (P<0.05, P<0.001, P<0.01), and the dwell time in 
the original platform quadrant was significantly increased (P<0.01) in the EA 
group. Following modeling, the number of neurons was decreased (P<0.001), the 
positive expression of Aβ1-40, IL-1β and IL-18 in the hippocampus and cortex, 
the co-expression of TUNEL and Caspase-1, and the protein and mRNA expression 
levels of NLRP3, Caspase-1, GSDMD were all increased (P<0.001) in the model 
group relevant to the normal group. After EA intervention, modeling induced 
increase and decrease of indexes mentioned above were completely reversed 
(P<0.01, P<0.05, P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: "Tongdu Qishen" acupuncture may improve the cognitive function of 
SAMP8 mice by regulating the NLRP3/Caspase-1/GSDMD pathway, relieving the 
release of inflammatory factors and reducing the content of Aβ1-40.

BACKGROUND: Adults with Alzheimer disease (AD) or Alzheimer disease and related 
dementias (ADRD) who require a wheelchair to accommodate disease-associated 
decline in mobility are at elevated risk for pressure injuries. More than half 
of residents in long-term care (LTC) facilities in the United States experience 
AD or ADRD. In LTC facilities, bed-based technologies exist to facilitate 
pressure injury prevention efforts, but similar technologies have not yet been 
widely evaluated to address sitting-related pressure injuries.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine preliminary design inputs from care 
providers for technology to address sitting-related pressure injury prevention 
in LTC settings. Specifically, we sought to (1) understand the types and use of 
sitting-related equipment used in LTC for residents with AD or ADRD, (2) 
identify challenges faced by nurses and other caregivers when repositioning 
seated residents, and (3) understand care provider preferences for features of 
future sitting-related feedback technologies designed to facilitate effective 
and timely repositioning.
METHODS: Surveys (n=30) and semistructured interviews (n=9) of administrative 
and direct care providers in LTC facilities were administered. Survey results 
were summarized, and we used thematic qualitative analysis of interview 
responses to develop themes around challenges experienced by care providers and 
their perceptions about how technologies could facilitate the prevention of 
sitting-related pressure injuries.
RESULTS: Survey respondents endorsed using many sitting surfaces for LTC 
residents with memory loss, such as padded reclining chairs, bedside or dining 
chairs, and wheelchairs with cushions. All indicated that shared equipment is 
provided by the facility, and 43% of respondents reported having access to a 
seating specialist at their facility. Sitting time was typically up to 12 hours 
per day. Themes related to pressure injury prevention in the LTC context, 
specific to those with memory loss, included (1) barriers to repositioning 
seated residents vary with the degree of memory loss, (2) care providers are 
aware of guidelines and policies around the 2-hour repositioning schedule, and 
(3) care providers are interested in technologies that have relative value over 
added burden. Care providers expressed interest in mobile health (mHealth) 
technologies that provide automatic repositioning in later stages of memory 
loss, delivery of cues for residents with mild memory loss to encourage 
independent repositioning, and tools to monitor resident sitting and 
pressure-related outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the complexity of addressing the 
repositioning needs of seated LTC residents with AD or ADRD using mHealth 
technologies due to changes as the disease progresses. mHealth technologies 
should encourage more independence by residents experiencing milder memory loss, 
with increasing automaticity in repositioning residents in later stages. Both 
approaches could potentially minimize care provider burden in repositioning 
seated residents throughout the day. Design, development, and implementation of 
technologies should carefully weigh benefit versus burden to care providers and 
residents and continue to engage with them for feedback as development 
progresses.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Corni fructus are the fruits of Cornus 
officinalis Sieb. et Zucc. and is widely used in traditional Chinese Medicine 
for the treatment of dementia. Cornuside, derived from Corni fructus, has been 
shown to be effective in improving cognition of AD mouse.
AIM: In the present study, we investigated the effect of cornuside on cognitive 
dysfunction and microglial NLRP3 inflammasome activation, as well as explored 
the underlying mechanism with respect to Sirt1 and autophagy.
METHODS: AD mice were established and then treated with cornuside (3, 10, and 
30 mg/kg) for 2 weeks. A series of behavioral tests were performed to assess 
cognition, including the Morris water maze, Y maze, nest building, step-down and 
step-through tests. Nissl staining was used to evaluate neuronal structural 
damage. LPS-stimulated BV2 cells were used for in vitro experiments. The 
anti-inflammatory effects of cornuside on cytokines and NLRP3 inflammasome 
activation were assessed using ELISA, RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, western 
blotting, and immunofluorescence assays. To further elucidate the relationship 
between Sirt1, autophagy, and NLRP3 inflammasome activation, EX527 and 3-MA were 
used to inhibit Sirt1 and block autophagy flux in vitro, respectively.
RESULTS: Cornuside significantly improved various behavioral performance and 
inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation in LPS-induced mice, as evidenced by 
decreased levels of NLRP3, ASC, pro-caspase1, caspase1, pro-IL-1β, IL-1β, GSDMD, 
GSDMD-NT and IL-18. Similar inhibitory effects of cornuside on NLRP3 
inflammasome activation was also detected in LPS stimulated BV2 cells. The 
involvement of Sirt1 and autophagy were further explored in-vivo and in-vitro, 
revealing that cornuside increased the expression of Sirt1 and enhanced 
autophagy, with decreased SQSTM1/p62 and increased LC3BII. However, the 
inhibitory effect of cornuside on NLRP3 inflammasome activation was abrogated by 
3-MA, and the effects of cornuside on promoting autophagy and inhibiting NLRP3 
inflammasome activation was abolished by EX527.
CONCLUSION: Cornuside exerts therapeutic effects on LPS induced AD mice by 
inhibiting microglial activation and NLRP3 inflammasome overactivation. And 
Sirt1 mediated autophagy activation is a vital mechanism by which cornuside 
degrades NLRP3 inflammasome, thereby alleviating neuroinflammation and improving 
cognitive function.

BackgroundPeople living with dementia (PWD) have poor executive function, which 
impacts their independence and fall risk. Exercise is a promising strategy but 
needs to be adapted for PWD in residential care settings. Thus, the feasibility, 
acceptability, and efficacy of adapted exercise on executive function need to be 
established.ObjectiveThe purpose of the 6-month assessor-blinded strENgth And 
BaLance exercise on Executive function in people living with Dementia (ENABLED) 
randomized controlled trial was to determine 1) the feasibility and 
acceptability, and 2) if the adapted physical therapist-led Otago Exercise 
Program (OEP) plus usual care would improve executive function (primary) and 
secondary cognitive, physical, and psychological function measures as well as 
falls compared to usual care only in PWD in residential care 
facilities.MethodsWe randomized PWD to the exercise (n = 21) or usual care group 
(n = 21) at two residential care facilities in our parallel, assessor-blinded 
RCT (1:1) [NCT05488951]. A physical therapist delivered our adapted OEP 3x/week 
over 6 months. We examined feasibility and acceptability. Participants completed 
a battery of assessments, with the Color-Word Stroop as our primary 
outcome.ResultsAttrition (19.0%), exercise adherence (60.2 ± 34.5%; 47/78 
sessions), and satisfaction were acceptable (4.2/5 points). We found no 
differences in the Color-Word Stroop, but better working memory, leg strength, 
and quality of life following exercise relative to usual care (p < 0.05). No 
differences in falls emerged.ConclusionsThis feasible and acceptable RCT 
indicates that exercise improves working memory, leg strength, and quality of 
life and has implications for the design of therapeutic intervention in PWD.

INTRODUCTION: Multiple TREM2 variants are associated with an increased risk of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). TREM2 H157Y is the only variant located at the 
proteolytic cleavage site that enhances TREM2 protein shedding. While this 
variant is associated with increased AD risk predominantly in the Chinese 
population, its impact on AD pathology is largely unknown.
METHODS: We conducted an in-depth study integrating clinical cases, neuroimaging 
data, and blood proteomic data.
RESULTS: TREM2 H157Y variant carriers with AD exhibit more severe AD pathology, 
more severe neurodegeneration, and more rapid clinical progression. Cognitively 
normal individuals carrying the variant show changes in blood proteins that are 
associated with neurodegeneration and inflammation. Moreover, the TREM2 H157Y 
variant is associated with altered immune and vascular processes irrespective of 
disease state.
DISCUSSION: These findings highlight the clinical implications of the TREM2 
H157Y variant and the use of blood proteomic data to investigate the effects of 
genetic variants on disease-related endophenotypes.
HIGHLIGHTS: The TREM2 H157Y variant is associated with more rapid clinical 
progression of Alzheimer's disease only in the presence of the apolipoprotein E 
(APOE) ε4 allele. The TREM2 H157Y variant is associated with neurodegeneration, 
irrespective of disease state. The TREM2 H157Y variant is associated with 
altered immune and vascular processes, irrespective of disease state. 
Cognitively normal TREM2 H157Y carriers show altered disease-associated blood 
proteins related to peripheral immune response. Blood proteomic data can be used 
to study the impacts of disease-associated genetic variants on disease outcomes 
and biological processes involved in pathogenesis.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative 
disorders, characterized by a progressive decline in cognitive function. 
Increasing evidence indicates that alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG), a key metabolite 
in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, can extend lifespan and healthspan across 
various animal models, raising interest in its potential neuroprotective effects 
in age-related disorders such as AD. Our previous research found that dietary 
supplementation with calcium alpha-ketoglutarate (CaAKG), a calcium derivative 
of AKG, enhances both lifespan and healthspan in mice. However, little is known 
about the neuroprotective role of AKG/CaAKG in AD. Here, we show that CaAKG 
could rescue synaptic deficits that are associated with AD. Treatment with AKG 
or CaAKG ameliorates long-term potentiation (LTP) at hippocampal CA1 synapses in 
APP/PS1 mice, with a more profound effect in female AD mice than in males. The 
effects of CaAKG were mediated through an NMDA receptor-independent mechanism 
involving L-type calcium channels (LTCC) and calcium-permeable AMPA receptors 
(CP-AMPARs). Analysis of protein expression showed that AD hippocampal slices 
treated with CaAKG exhibited increased LC3-II levels, indicating enhanced 
autophagy. Similarly, rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, also rescued LTP deficits in 
AD mice, suggesting that the observed increase in autophagy may contribute to 
neuroprotection. Interestingly, rapamycin showed differential effects, as it 
rescued LTP in AD mice but blocked LTP in WT mice. We also observed that CaAKG 
facilitated synaptic tagging and capture (STC), a widely studied cellular model 
for associative memory, indicating its potential to facilitate associative 
memory. Overall, our findings suggest that CaAKG has neuroprotective effects in 
APP/PS1 mice. We propose CaAKG as a promising therapeutic target not only for 
aging but also for AD and potentially other age-associated neurodegenerative 
diseases, highlighting geroprotective strategies as viable alternatives for the 
prevention and treatment of AD.

INTRODUCTION: Risk factors associated with sporadic non-amnestic and early-onset 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain underexamined.
METHODS: We investigated a large, clinically heterogeneous, AD cohort for 
frequencies of established risk factors (hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, 
diabetes mellitus) alongside novel factors (non-right-handedness, learning 
disability, seizures, autoimmune disease).
RESULTS: Early-onset AD possessed lower frequencies of established risk factors 
(hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, all p < 0.001) and 
higher frequencies of novel factors (non-right-handedness, learning disability, 
active seizure, all p < 0.001; remote seizure, p = 0.002; and autoimmune 
disease, p = 0.007). An age at onset < 70 maximally distinguished novel from 
typical factors. Principal component analysis loaded novel factors into two 
components, non-right-handedness and learning disability versus seizure and 
autoimmune disease, which combined, resulted in an exponential decrease in age 
at onset from one factor alone.
DISCUSSION: Identifying novel factors enriched in early-onset and non-amnestic 
AD introduces new theories of AD susceptibility and phenotypic heterogeneity, 
with significant implications for disease prediction and treatment.
HIGHLIGHTS: We identified a suite of novel factors overrepresented in 
early-onset and non-amnestic AD. These factors can be broadly conceptualized as 
neurodevelopmental (non-right-handedness and learning disability) and neural 
environmental (seizure and autoimmunity). The combination of these factors 
produced exponential decreases in AD age at onset, compared to each alone, 
supporting a new theoretical framework for understanding AD risk with 
implications for disease prediction, prevention, and therapeutic intervention.

Caudatin is a C21 steroidal glycoside isolated from many species of the genus 
Cynanchum, has been utilized by traditional medicine to treat cancer and 
inflammation which is increasingly being considered a drug candidate because of 
the pharmacological activity it displays. This review provides a discussion of 
caudatin's structure-activity relationship (SAR), pharmacology, and therapeutic 
uses along with a synthesis of future challenges. Caudatin is a potent 
anti-cancer therapeutic that has been shown to modulate several important 
signaling pathways, which include but are not limited to: Wnt/β-catenin, NF-κB, 
and PI3K/AKT pathway, induce apoptosis through ROS mediated mitochondrial 
dysfunction, reduce metastatic spread through inhibition of 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and have an anti-inflammatory effect 
through inhibition of JNK/AP-1/NF-κB signaling. Caudatin has also displayed 
neuroprotection in models of Alzheimer's disease by activating TFEB and the 
autophagosome-lysosomal pathway mechanism of action, while also modulating 
PPARα. Furthermore, pharmacokinetic studies indicate that caudatin is rapidly 
absorbed and is able to selectively tail hepatic tissue while having little to 
no toxicity or significant adverse events in pre- clinical animal studies. 
Structure-activity studies suggest that modifications on the C-3 hydroxyl 
position, primarily with nitrogen heterocycles and/or sugars greatly enhance the 
bioactivity and solubility. With caudatin being such a great scaffold for 
medicinal chemistry, there is great opportunity to take advantage of caudatin as 
a building block to generate novel therapies which bridge traditional medicine 
with modern drug discovery. The future is aimed primarily at a combination 
strategy of synthetic derivatives, translational studies, and formulations. In 
further exploring caudatin as a treatment for cancer and neurodegenerative 
diseases, and inflammation.

Protein palmitoylation is a reversible lipid modification in which palmitoyl 
esters are covalently attached to cysteine residues of proteins. It controls 
various cellular physiological processes and alters protein stability, 
conformation, localization, membrane binding, and interaction with other 
effector proteins. Palmitoylation is catalyzed by a group of zinc finger 
DHHC-containing proteins (ZDHHCs), while the acyl-protein thioesterase family 
mediates depalmitoylation. Emerging evidence suggests that palmitoylation is 
critical for inflammatory signaling pathways, where palmitoylation is 
particularly important in the membrane localization of inflammation-associated 
proteins. Notably, dysregulation of palmitoylation has been associated with a 
variety of inflammatory diseases. Here, we provide an overview of the regulatory 
mechanisms of palmitoylation, explore the emerging role of palmitoylation in 
inflammatory signaling pathways, and examine the link between dysregulated 
palmitoylation and the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases, including 
inflammatory bowel disease, autoimmune diseases, metabolic 
dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, sepsis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's 
disease, and diabetes. Finally, we discuss some of the challenges and 
opportunities facing the field. Targeting palmitoylation or its associated 
enzymes serves as a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of inflammatory 
diseases.

PURPOSE: Edaravone is a potent free-radical scavenger and antioxidant that has 
been widely investigated for its therapeutic potential in neurodegenerative 
diseases and oxidative stress-related conditions. Although previous studies have 
explored its molecular structure, pharmacological effects, and clinical 
applications, a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of its research trends and 
future directions remains lacking.
METHODS: This study employed bibliometric methods to analyze edaravone-related 
publications from 2000 to 2024, using the Web of Science Core Collection 
database. The analysis examined publication trends; contributions by countries, 
institutions, and authors; and keyword clustering. Data visualization tools, 
such as CiteSpace and VOSviewer, were utilized to identify research clusters and 
emerging trends in edaravone research.
RESULTS: The findings revealed a significant increase in edaravone-related 
publications, with China, Japan, and the United States as the leading 
contributors. Notable researchers, including Abe K and Yoshino H, have made 
substantial contributions to this field. Four major research clusters were 
identified: free radical scavenging, cerebral infarction, amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis, and oxidative stress. Emerging trends suggest a growing interest in 
edaravone dexbornel for acute ischemic stroke treatment, as well as its 
potential applications in blood-brain barrier interactions and Alzheimer's 
disease.
CONCLUSION: This bibliometric analysis highlights the growing interest in 
edaravone and its potential clinical application, particularly in 
neuroprotection. While this study provides valuable insights into current 
research trends, future studies should incorporate a broader range of sources 
and languages to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the impact and 
scope of edaravone.

INTRODUCTION: Focused transcranial ultrasound stimulation (fTUS) has emerged as 
a novel noninvasive technique with promising therapeutic potential for various 
neurological and psychiatric conditions. The aim of this review is to evaluate 
current research on fTUS, examining its mechanisms, therapeutic applications, 
challenges, and future potential in neurological and psychiatric disorders.
AREA COVERED: High-intensity fTUS leads to heat-induced thermoablation, which 
has shown efficacy in treating essential tremor and tremor-dominant Parkinson's 
disease, with promising outcomes in clinical trials. fTUS has been explored for 
blood-brain barrier opening, facilitating drug delivery for conditions like 
glioblastoma and Alzheimer's disease. Low-intensity fTUS can also be used as a 
novel neuromodulation tool which has shown potential in alleviating chronic 
pain, depression, and cognitive decline.
EXPERT OPINION: Challenges remain, including technical refinements, 
standardization of parameters, and optimization of therapeutic protocols. 
Emerging approaches like hyperthermia therapy, sonodynamic therapy, and 
sonothrombolysis hold promise for future applications. With ongoing research and 
collaboration, the next decade holds immense potential for further advancements 
in fTUS technology and its clinical integration.

Classical psychedelic drugs show promise as a treatment for major depressive 
disorder and related psychiatric disorders. This therapeutic efficacy stems from 
long-lasting psychedelic-induced neuroplasticity onto prefrontal cortical 
neurons and is thought to require the postsynaptic expression of serotonin 2A 
receptors (5-HT2AR). However, other cortical regions such as the granular 
retrosplenial cortex (RSG) - important for memory, spatial orientation, fear 
extinction, and imagining oneself in the future, but impaired in Alzheimer's 
disease - lack 5-HT2AR and are thus considered unlikely to benefit from 
psychedelic therapy. Here, we show that RSG pyramidal cells lacking postsynaptic 
5-HT2A receptors still undergo long-lasting psychedelic-induced synaptic 
enhancement. A newly engineered CRISPR-Cas-based conditional knockout mouse line 
reveals that this form of psychedelic-induced retrosplenial plasticity requires 
presynaptic 5-HT2A receptors expressed on anterior thalamic axonal inputs to 
RSG. These results highlight a broader psychedelic therapeutic utility than 
currently appreciated, suggesting potential for augmenting RSG circuit function 
in Alzheimer's disease, post-traumatic stress disorder, and other 
neuropsychiatric conditions, despite the lack of postsynaptic 5-HT2A receptors.

BACKGROUND: Despite recent approval of monoclonal antibodies that reduce amyloid 
(Aβ) accumulation, the development of disease-modifying strategies targeting the 
underlying mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is urgently needed.
METHODS: We demonstrate that mitochondrial complex I (mtCI) represents a 
druggable target, where its weak inhibition activates neuroprotective 
signalling, benefiting AD mouse models with Aβ and p-Tau pathologies. Rational 
design and structure‒activity relationship studies yielded mtCI inhibitors 
profiled in a drug discovery funnel designed to address safety, selectivity, and 
efficacy.
FINDINGS: The lead compound C458 is highly protective against Aβ toxicity, has 
favourable pharmacokinetics, and minimal off-target effects. C458 exhibited 
excellent brain penetrance, activating neuroprotective pathways with a single 
dose. Preclinical studies in APP/PS1 mice were conducted using functional tests, 
metabolic assessment, in vivo31P-NMR spectroscopy, blood cytokine panels, ex 
vivo electrophysiology, and Western blotting. Chronic oral administration 
improved long-term potentiation, reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, and 
enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis, antioxidant signalling, and cellular 
energetics. Efficacy against Aβ and p-Tau was confirmed in human organoids.
INTERPRETATION: These studies provide further evidence that the restoration of 
mitochondrial function in response to mild energetic stress represents a 
promising disease-modifying strategy for AD.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD), the leading cause of dementia, is characterized by 
complex pathological mechanisms that extend beyond amyloid-β plaques and tau 
tangles. This study investigates the dysregulation of lipids with a focus on 
phospholipids and sphingolipids, in human post-mortem AD brain tissue using 
lipidomics methodology. By employing a ZIC-HILIC LC-MS/MS platform, the lipidome 
of AD (N = 18) was compared to the control (N = 18). Out of 45 quantified lipid 
classes, 16 belonging to phospholipids and sphingolipids group are 
differentially expressed (p < 0.05; q < 0.05) in AD compared to control. Key 
findings include the upregulation of phosphatidylcholine (PC), 
phosphatidylglycerol (PG), ganglioside GD2 (GD2), phosphatidylinositol (PI), 
phosphatidylserine (PS), lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), lysophosphatidylcholine 
(LPC), and sphingomyelin (phSM), along with the downregulation of ganglioside 
GD1a in AD. The targeted analysis revealed that ganglioside GD1b exhibits a 
higher abundance than ganglioside GD1a across all sample groups. System biology 
analysis revealed that dysregulated lipids impact critical pathways, including 
glycerophospholipid biosynthesis and sphingolipid metabolism. Additionally, 
proteomics analysis on the samples showed that proteins such as Amyloid-β 
precursor protein, pleckstrin homology and SEC7 domain-containing protein 2 
(PSD2), and RAC-gamma serine/threonine-protein kinase (AKT) play a role in 
phospholipid and sphingolipid dysregulation observed in AD. The dysregulated 
lipids are predicted to be involved in neuronal cell death, necrosis, and 
apoptosis, advancing our understanding of AD pathogenesis. The study highlights 
phospholipids and sphingolipids as promising biomarkers and potential 
therapeutic targets for AD, paving the way for possible diagnostic tools and 
personalized treatments.

BackgroundDespite treatment guidelines for Alzheimer's disease (AD), access to 
AD medications varies significantly within the same health care 
setting.ObjectivePredictors influencing access to AD medication were assessed in 
a retrospective cohort study comprising most individuals diagnosed with AD in 
Stockholm 2013-2021.Methods14,884 individuals were included, with an incident AD 
diagnosis between 2013-2021 in Stockholm, Sweden. The primary outcome was the 
dispensation of AD-specific drugs (cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine) 
within 90 days before to 180 days after AD diagnosis. We used a generalized 
linear mixed-effects model (GLMM). Variables included patient-centered 
characteristics such as age and comorbidities, and characteristics of the 
primary care centers (PCC) where the individuals were listed, including Care 
Need Index (CNI).ResultsOverall, 77% of diagnosed patients were dispensed AD 
medications. Individuals listed at PCCs with high CNI score, indicative of lower 
socio-economic resources of the area, were less likely to receive a dispensation 
of any AD medication compared with low CNI score (76.2% versus 84.8%; OR 0.65, 
95% CI 0.50-0.86). The association between CNI score and likelihood of receiving 
AD medication was attenuated in subgroup analysis of individuals living in 
nursing homes. Also associated with lower likelihood of receiving AD medications 
were age ≥85 years (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.21-0.28), nursing home residency (OR 0.37, 
95% CI 0.34-0.41), and comorbidity (OR 0.63, 95% CI 
0.57-0.70).ConclusionsSocio-economic factors strongly influenced the likelihood 
of receiving AD medication, in addition to more established factors such as age 
and comorbidities. Interventions are needed to eliminate barriers to equal drug 
treatment in AD, particularly those related to socio-economic disadvantages.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder marked by 
synaptic dysfunction and neuronal loss, with glutamate excitotoxicity playing a 
central role in its pathology. The astrocytic glutamate transporter EAAT2, 
responsible for maintaining synaptic glutamate homeostasis, is significantly 
downregulated in AD. Restoration of EAAT2 expression presents a promising 
therapeutic strategy. This study explores the potential of modulating the 
Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway to enhance EAAT2 levels by targeting the 
Axin-1/β-catenin interaction. Through virtual screening of 120,993 compounds 
from the Asinex-CNS database, five lead candidates were identified based on 
molecular docking, MMGBSA scores, and drug-likeness parameters. Advanced 
in-silico analyses-including Principal Component Analysis, Dynamic 
Cross-Correlation Mapping, molecular dynamics simulations, and MM/PBSA binding 
free energy calculations-highlighted BAS 04937103 as the most promising compound 
for disrupting β-catenin degradation. In vitro validation using C6 glioma cells 
and primary astrocytic cultures demonstrated that BAS 04937103 enhanced 
β-catenin stabilization and nuclear translocation, reduced Axin-1 expression, 
and significantly upregulated EAAT2 levels. These molecular effects corresponded 
with decreased extracellular glutamate concentrations, improved glutamate 
uptake, and reduced oxidative stress. Collectively, these findings establish BAS 
04937103 as a novel modulator of the Axin/β-catenin interaction with therapeutic 
potential in mitigating glutamate-mediated neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease.

PURPOSE: Astrocyte reactivity is a key pathological feature and potential 
therapeutic target of Alzheimer's disease (AD), however, the optimal timing of 
its modulation remains unexplored. This study aims to combine 18F-SMBT-1 based 
molecular imaging with astrocyte-targeted intervention in 3xTg-AD mice to 
address this challenge.
METHODS: PET imaging with 18F-SMBT-1 was conducted in 3xTg-AD mice at 4, 6, 10, 
and 12 months of age, with age-matched wild-type (WT) mice as controls. The 
standardized uptake value ratio was calculated using cerebellum as the reference 
region by PMOD software. Immunofluorescence (IF) analysis was used to assess 
astrocyte reactivity ex vivo. Astrocyte-targeted intervention via Nrf2 
overexpression was performed in 4-month-old 3xTg-AD mice using adeno-associated 
virus vectors. Following intervention, PET imaging with 18F-SMBT-1 was performed 
to assess astrocyte reactivity, open field test and Morris water maze test were 
performed to evaluate cognitive function, and IF analysis was used to assess 
pathological feature of AD.
RESULTS: In 3xTg-AD mice of different ages, higher uptake of 18F-SMBT-1 was 
observed in the cortex and hippocampus compared to age-matched WT controls. IF 
analysis further confirmed the presence of reactive astrocytes activation in 
3xTg-AD mice. Both in vivo 18F-SMBT-1 imaging and ex vivo IF analysis identified 
early-onset astrocyte activation in 3xTg-AD mice. Based on these observations, 
we implemented early astrocyte-targeted intervention via Nrf2 overexpression at 
4 months of age in 3xTg-AD mice. Subsequent in vivo 18F-SMBT-1 PET imaging 
demonstrated a significant reduction in astrocyte reactivity following this 
intervention. Our findings also demonstrated that early astrocyte-targeted 
intervention might delay AD pathological progression in 3xTg-AD mice, as 
supported by attenuated anxiety-like behavior and ameliorated neuropathological 
features.
CONCLUSION: 18F-SMBT-1 PET imaging served as a diagnostic biomarker for 
monitoring astrocyte reactivity to guide therapeutic timing decisions, and as a 
therapeutic response indicator for evaluating treatment efficacy. Early 
astrocyte-targeted intervention demonstrated significant therapeutic potential. 
These findings highlighted the translational potential of molecular 
imaging-guided strategies and astrocyte-targeted therapies in AD.

INTRODUCTION: Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) is the second most common cause of 
neurodegenerative dementia after Alzheimer's disease, characterized by a complex 
combination of cognitive, neuropsychiatric, motor, autonomic, and sleep-related 
symptoms. Symptom fluctuation, polypharmacy risks, and high sensitivity to 
commonly used drugs present unique challenges for management.
AREAS COVERED: This review provides a comprehensive overview of the symptomatic 
management of DLB, organized by clinical domains. It critically evaluates 
current pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment strategies for 
cognitive impairment, hallucinations, parkinsonism, autonomic dysfunction, and 
sleep disturbances. Evidence is drawn from clinical trials, meta-analyses, and 
extrapolated findings from related disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and 
Parkinson's disease.
EXPERT OPINION: Effective DLB management requires an individualized, 
symptom-prioritized approach that carefully balances therapeutic benefit with 
potential adverse effects, particularly given the high risk of antipsychotic 
sensitivity and treatment-induced worsening of symptoms. Despite recent 
progress, evidence remains sparse for many symptom domains. Greater investment 
in DLB-specific clinical trials and development of targeted therapies is 
urgently needed to improve patient outcomes.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common forms of dementia, making up 
around two thirds of all dementia cases globally. Despite its high prevalence, 
it is estimated to remain undiagnosed in 41 million people with dementia, and 
with only about 25% of dementia individuals being clinically identified. AD is 
the major neurodegenerative disorder leading to dementia, characterized by 
neuronal atrophy and loss. The accumulation of toxic amyloid-beta (Aβ) 
oligomers, protein aggregates, along with the formation of neurofibrillary 
tangles (NFTs) within neurons, is the key pathological feature of AD. NFTs are 
composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. These abnormalities contribute to a 
decline in cerebral glucose metabolism in the brain, synaptic dysfunction, and 
mitochondrial impairment. The progression of AD occurs in three stages: (1) the 
presymptomatic stage, (2) mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and (3) the clinical 
stage of AD. Many biomarkers have been identified for diagnosing AD and 
differentiating it from atypical AD. It has emerged as a key area of research, 
offering significant potential for early detection of AD, prognostication, as 
well as planning drug therapy and monitoring.

INTRODUCTION: TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 3 is investigating donanemab in preclinical 
Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: This double-blind, placebo-controlled trial used a plasma 
phosphorylated tau-217 (p-tau217) assay to detect AD pathology for eligibility 
and a decentralized design to enhance screening and enrollment. After nine 
monthly infusions, clinical assessments continue every 6 months with a 
time-to-event primary outcome. A sub-study will evaluate longitudinal changes in 
amyloid and tau positron emission tomography (PET).
RESULTS: Participants 55-80 years of age were screened (N = 63,124). Plasma 
p-tau217-eligible participants were enrolled (N = 2196), with Clinical Dementia 
Rating (CDR) scale-Global score (CDR-GS) of 0 (n = 1202) and 0.5 (n = 664). 
Plasma p-tau217 eligibility increased with age, differing across races and 
ethnicities. Mean baseline amyloid levels were 63.2 (CDR-GS: 0) and 70.7 
Centiloids (CDR-GS: 0.5). Elevated global tau signal (standardized uptake value 
ratio ≥1.10) was observed in 15.1% and 26.3% of CDR-GS 0 and 0.5 subgroups, 
respectively.
DISCUSSION: Utilizing a unique decentralized design, the trial showed baseline 
data consistent with preclinical AD.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05026866, TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 
3 HIGHLIGHTS: TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 3 screened 63,124 participants in the United 
States and Japan Plasma phosphorylated tau-217 (p-tau217) was used to determine

BACKGROUND: Lecanemab is the first disease-modifying therapy for Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) approved in China. However, the factors affecting patient and 
caregiver willingness to adopt this novel treatment have not been assessed yet.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the factors influencing both treatment willingness and 
willingness-to-pay for lecanemab among Chinese AD patients and their caregivers.
METHODS: We surveyed 195 AD patients and their caregivers using structured 
questionnaires assessing key factors influencing treatment willingness, 
including efficacy (Wefficacy), adverse effects (Wadverse), inconvenience 
(Winconvenience), cost (Wcost), overall willingness to treat (Wtreat), and 
amount willing to pay (Wamount). Additional variables included income, cognitive 
and functional assessments, caregiver burden (ZBI), health status (HS), 
education levels (patient/caregiver: edu, edu.c), psychiatric symptoms (PSY), 
and satisfaction with conventional treatments (effect). Network analysis mapped 
variable inter-relationships.
RESULTS: Wtreat showed a strong direct association with Wcost (0.99). Wefficacy 
and Winconvenience indirectly influenced Wtreat through Wcost 
(Wefficacy-Winconvenience: 1.5, Winconvenience-Wcost: 1.12, Wcost-Wtreat: 0.99). 
Income (0.48) and effect (0.51) directly impacted Wtreat. Edu, edu.c, CDR, PSY, 
ZBI, and HS were indirectly correlated with Wtreat. Wamount was directly 
associated with Wtreat (0.31), Wcost (0.68), and Wadverse (0.16). Wefficacy and 
Winconvenience indirectly influenced Wamount through Wcost (Wefficacy- 
Winconvenience: 1.5, Winconvenience-Wcost: 1.12, Wcost-Wamount: 0.68). Network 
stability tests (CS >0.50) confirmed robustness.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that reducing payment barriers has a greater 
impact on real-world adoption of innovative therapies than clinical efficacy 
alone. Addressing financial constraints also enhances patients' willingness to 
pay. These findings provide evidence-based insights for developing 
patient-centered clinical decision pathways.

IMPORTANCE: Several sets of diagnostic criteria have been proposed for vascular 
cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). The International Society for Vascular 
Behavioural and Cognitive Disorders (VasCog) working group published 
comprehensive operationalized criteria in 2014. Considering subsequent advances 
in the field, a revision was needed.
OBJECTIVE: To update the VasCog criteria to achieve consensus on diagnosis of 
VCID.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: VasCog criteria and other published 
diagnostic guidelines, aided by literature review of recent developments in 
VCID, were used as reference points for an online Delphi survey (minimum 3 
rounds, ≥75% threshold for agreement), including operationalization of criteria 
and guidance on potential biomarkers. Seventy international experts from diverse 
international regions were invited to participate in 2023.
RESULTS: Three survey rounds included 49 to 54 participants that agreed on 
VasCog-2 diagnostic criteria for preclinical, mild, and major dementia levels of 
vascular cognitive impairment (under the overarching term VCID). Research 
guidelines, including the use of novel neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers, were 
also agreed on. The World Stroke Organization (WSO) endorsed the criteria, hence 
named VasCog-2-WSO.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The VasCog-2-WSO criteria update the VasCog criteria 
for the diagnosis of VCID, providing operationalization and additional guidance 
on potential neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers. VasCog-2-WSO should provide an 
international standard for VCID diagnosis, facilitating diagnostic consistency 
among clinicians and researchers.

This review summarizes recent advances in leveraging natural products from 
Chinese medicine to modulate the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling 
pathway for the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), 
focusing specifically on Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and 
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). NF-κB proteins regulate cellular biological 
activity by binding to promoter regions in the nucleus and transcribing various 
protein-coding genes. Emerging evidence indicates that NF-κB plays a pivotal 
role in driving key hallmarks of NDD progression, including neuroinflammation, 
oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and dysregulation of the cell 
cycle. Natural products from Chinese medicine exert modulatory effects on NF-κB 
signaling through diverse pharmacological mechanisms, ultimately improving 
cognitive and motor impairments in preclinical NDDs models. The pleiotropic 
nature of natural products derived from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM)-which 
operate through subunit-specific modulation of NF-κB-underscores their potential 
as next-generation therapeutics. Investigating the intricate regulation of NF-κB 
by natural products from Chinese medicine will not only enrich our understanding 
of the pathogenesis of NDDs but also establish a theoretical foundation for the 
development of new therapeutic drugs for NDDs, providing innovative strategies 
for prevention and treatment.

Epigenetic Dysregulation in Neurodegenerative Disease: Implications for 
Neuropathology and Therapy.

Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's 
disease (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD) are characterized by progressive 
neuronal dysfunction, yet their underlying mechanisms remain incompletely 
understood. Emerging evidence implicates epigenetic dysregulation as a central 
contributor to the pathogenesis of these disorders. A thematic literature review 
was conducted across major databases using targeted search terms related to 
epigenetics and neurodegeneration. Studies were selected based on relevance, 
methodological quality, and contribution to mechanistic understanding, in 
accordance with Scale for the Assessment of Narrative Review Articles (SANRA) 
guidelines. Across AD, PD, and HD, distinct yet overlapping patterns of 
epigenetic alterations were identified. In AD, dysregulated DNA methylation and 
histone acetylation affect genes linked to amyloid and tau pathology. In PD, 
hypomethylation of SNCA and altered histone acetylation contribute to 
α-synuclein overexpression and neuronal loss. In HD, mutant huntingtin protein 
disrupts chromatin remodeling by sequestering histone acetyltransferases and 
altering microRNA expression. These changes disrupt neuronal identity, synaptic 
function, and inflammatory responses, often forming feedback loops that 
exacerbate disease progression. Epigenetic mechanisms play a pivotal role in 
neurodegeneration by mediating gene-environment interactions and perpetuating 
neuropathological changes. Their reversible nature presents opportunities for 
therapeutic intervention, though challenges related to specificity, delivery, 
and timing remain. Continued research into epigenetic biomarkers and 
precision-targeted epigenetic therapies holds promise for advancing early 
diagnosis and disease modification in NDDs.

Neurodegenerative diseases represent a significant challenge due to their 
complex etiology, late diagnosis, and lack of effective treatments. 
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as promising carriers of disease 
biomarkers, especially proteins, but their low abundance in biological fluids 
complicates their detection. Here, we present a novel strategy for the 
multiplexed quantitative determination of EV-associated proteins in blood serum 
from APP/PS1 transgenic mice, a model of Alzheimer's disease. The method 
combines inductively coupled plasma-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ICP-ToFMS) 
with competitive immunoassays using metal nanocluster-labeled (AuNCs, PtNCs, 
IrNCs) antibodies targeting Alpha-Actinin 1 (ACTN), Galectin-3-binding protein 
(LG3BP), and Moesin (MSN). EVs were isolated using an optimized 
ultracentrifugation protocol to reduce the level of serum protein contamination. 
Proteomic screening identified target proteins with a known relevance to 
neurodegeneration, and the developed assay achieved detection limits in the low 
femtomolar range. The approach was applied to a pilot study on Zn 
supplementation in 16-month-old APP/PS1 mice, revealing sex-dependent and 
genotype-specific differences in protein expression but sex-independent patterns 
in regulatory mechanisms (especially for MSN and LG3BP). Among the studied 
markers, MSN levels showed statistically significant differences with Zn 
treatment in male homozygous mice. This work demonstrates the potential of 
ICP-MS for sensitive and multiplexed biomarker quantification in EVs, supporting 
its use in neurodegenerative research and supplementation studies.

INTRODUCTION: The growing prevalence of dementia calls for nonpharmacological 
interventions to reduce negative quality of life effects for those living with 
dementia and their caregivers. Brain and Body Fitness, a community-based 
collaborative group program, engages people living with dementia and their 
caregivers through a combination of physical, cognitive, and socialization 
strategies, to maximize health benefits for sustained functioning.
METHODS: Using an adapted form of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement 
Information System (PROMIS) Applied Cognition tool, ex post facto data were 
collected from both participants affected with Alzheimer's disease and related 
dementias and their caregivers during 12 biweekly sessions of the Brain and Body 
Fitness program conducted from 2017 through 2021.
RESULTS: Brain and Body Fitness program participants were affected by 4 quality 
of life indicators: anxiety, sleep, fatigue, and depression. Data reveal 
significant reductions in anxiety symptoms and significant improvements in 
fatigue for affected participants. Anecdotally, the program demonstrates 
nonsignificant trends of overall mood improvement.
CONCLUSIONS: Given the positive outcomes, communities may consider adopting a 
similar program to provide additional support for participants.

PURPOSE: Dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, poses complex challenges 
requiring health care providers to respond with empathy and skill. The current 
study examined whether a simulation-based dementia education intervention could 
enhance empathy in health care students.
METHODS: Using embedded mixed methods, one-group quasi-experimental design, 
empathy levels in 125 prelicensure nursing and graduate occupational therapy 
students were measured via the Kiersma-Chen Empathy Scale-Revised (KCES-R) 
before, immediately after, and 6 weeks post-simulation. In addition, 36 
post-debriefing focus groups explored student experiences qualitatively.
RESULTS: Findings showed significant empathy score increases across all time 
points (F[2,124] = 17.02, p < 0.001). Thematic analysis revealed five themes: 
The Illusion of Empathy, Developing Empathetic Skills, Confronting Uncomfortable 
Truths, The Eureka Moment: Transformative Realizations, and Empathy and Power 
Dynamics.
CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that simulation-based dementia experience improves 
empathy and motivates students to provide better care. Experiential learning is 
critical to preparing future health care professionals to meet the growing 
demands of dementia care.

BackgroundThe AFF006 trial (NCT01117818) provided unexpected evidence of 
benefits of the vaccine adjuvant AD04 (aluminum oxyhydroxide) in patients with 
early Alzheimer's disease (AD), compared with AD02, a vaccine consisting of a 
peptide that mimics the N-terminal region of human amyloid-β (Aβ) conjugated 
with keyhole limpet hemocyanin.ObjectiveThe objective of this post hoc analysis 
was to assess whether this unexpected benefit of AD04 was an artifact of 
multiple testing (i.e., type I error inflation) or a robust result.MethodsIn 
this post hoc assessment, we used permutation testing to estimate type I error 
inflation due to the evaluation of multiple outcomes in AFF006. Efficacy was 
assessed using a patient-level global statistical test combining composite 
endpoints of cognition, function, and global AD. In addition, we examined the 
observed treatment benefits of AD04 in the context of effects observed in trials 
of aducanumab, donanemab, and lecanemab, monoclonal anti-Aβ antibodies that 
received regulatory approval for AD.ResultsThe global statistical test suggested 
a treatment benefit of AD04 versus ineffective AD02 arms, even after accounting 
for multiplicity (primary methodology p-value, 0.03; permutation test p-value, 
0.02). The observed effect estimates for AD04 compared favorably with approved 
monoclonal antibodies.ConclusionsPost-hoc analyses are hypothesis generating 
rather than confirmatory. Adjusting for multiplicity using permutation testing 
can determine whether post-hoc effects are worth pursuing, or unlikely to be 
confirmed. These analyses have motivated a follow-up prospective randomized 
controlled trial, ADVANCE (EudraCT 2022-003532-73), in which optimized AD04 
dosing will be compared to placebo in early AD.

BackgroundActivation of NLRP3 inflammasome has been implicated in cognitive 
impairment. Melatonin, known for its anti-inflammatory properties and 
traditional use in regulating circadian rhythms, is the focus of this study. 
This study intended to investigate the role of melatonin in diabetic cognitive 
impairment model.ObjectiveThe present study aimed to investigate the underlying 
mechanism of melatonin in alleviating diabetic cognitive impairment by 
suppressing NLRP3/Caspase 1 signaling pathway.MethodsCognitive function was 
assessed using Morris water maze test and Novel Object Recognition test. 
Apoptosis rate of hippocampal neurons was evaluated by TUNEL staining. Western 
blot was used to evaluate NLRP3/Caspase 1 pathway expression. Double 
immunofluorescence labelling of GFAP, Iba-1 or NeuN with NLRP3 respectively 
showed the localization of NLRP3 in hippocampus of db/db mice. In vitro, HT-22 
cells treated with high glucose as cellular model were transfected with 
pc-DNA3.1-mNLRP3 or co-cultured with NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 to elucidate 
NLRP3/Caspase 1 pathway in neuronal apoptosis regulation.ResultsMelatonin 
treatment improved cognitive function and morphologic abnormalities of 
hippocampal neurons. The double immunofluorescence labelling revealed melatonin 
inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation in hippocampal neurons rather than 
microglia or astrocytes. TUNEL staining and western blot showed melatonin 
markedly reversed the upregulation of NLRP3/Caspase 1 signaling pathway against 
neuronal apoptosis.ConclusionsMelatonin attenuates diabetic cognitive impairment 
in db/db mice with down-regulation of NLRP3/Caspase 1 signaling pathway. In vivo 
and vitro studies supported that NLRP3 activation in hippocampal neurons was 
associated with diabetic cognitive impairment progression.

BackgroundEarly prevention and intervention for Alzheimer's disease (AD) are 
critical due to the absence of effective therapeutic treatment. However, a 
widely accepted risk prediction model for AD has yet to be 
established.ObjectiveTo develop a novel risk prediction model for AD by 
leveraging recent advances in identifying risk factors, focusing on multi-omics 
data.MethodsGenetic data from the UK Biobank were employed to calculate the 
polygenic risk score (PRS) using the clumping and thresholding (C + T) method. 
Univariate Cox regression and Elastic Net Cox models were utilized to identify 
significant predictors in the training cohort. Subsequently, a multivariate Cox 
regression model was developed to construct the prediction model, which was 
visualized using a nomogram. The performance of the model was evaluated through 
calibration curves, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and the 
Hosmer-Lemeshow test.ResultsTen risk factors, including age, education, family 
history of dementia, diabetes, depression, hypertension, anemia, coronary heart 
disease (CAD), falls and PRS, were identified as significant predictors through 
Cox regression and Elastic Net Cox model. The model demonstrated strong 
predictive performance, with area under the curves (AUCs) of 0.864 [95% CI: 
(0.814, 0.911)], 0.860 [95% CI: (0.842, 0.876)], and 0.842 [95% CI: (0.819, 
0.863)] at 5, 10, and 14 years, respectively, in the validation 
cohort.ConclusionsIncorporating colocalized single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs) into the PRS derived using the C + T method significantly enhances 
predictive accuracy. This study highlights the importance of integrating 
multimodal patient data, including colocalized genetic information, to refine AD 
risk prediction.

New 1,2,4-triazole compounds were synthesized in this study. These compounds 
(2,3,5,6 (a-f)) were characterized by IR, 1H-NMR, and 13C-NMR studies. Acarbose 
was used as a standard for alpha glycosidase and alpha amylase enzymes, while 
tacrine molecule was used as a standard for acetylcholinesterase enzyme. While 
the IC50 result of acarbose was found to be 6.430 ± 0.736, the IC50 values for 
α-gly and α-amly enzymes were 1.454 ± 0.087 µM-3.7973 ± 0.3352 µM and 
1.509 ± 0.161 µM-3.797 ± 0.335 µM, respectively. In addition, the IC50 values 
for AChE enzyme were found to be in the range of 
1.330 ± 0.118 µM-11.104 ± 3.463 µM. Except for molecules 5a, 5b and 5 f, all 
other molecules were found to be more active than the standard. Molecular 
docking simulations were conducted to explore the interactions of 3e and 3 f 
compounds with Human Acetylcholinesterase, using tacrine as a reference 
molecule, to evaluate binding affinities and key ligand-protein interactions.

IMPORTANCE: Advances in Alzheimer disease (AD) have shifted research focus to 
earlier disease stages, necessitating more scalable approaches to identify 
cognitively unimpaired individuals with amyloid β (Aβ) pathology.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the utility of plasma phosphorylated tau 217 (p-tau217) for 
classifying Aβ status in cognitively unimpaired individuals, both as a 
stand-alone test and in a 2-step approach where positive plasma results were 
confirmed using a second modality (Aβ positron emission tomography [PET] or 
cerebrospinal fluid [CSF]).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional cohort study used data 
collected between June 2009 and March 2024. We included 2916 cognitively 
unimpaired participants from 12 international independent observational cohorts 
in the US, Europe, Australia, and Canada with available plasma p-tau217 levels 
and CSF or PET Aβ biomarkers. Performance comparisons between mass spectrometry 
and immunoassay-based p-tau217 measurements were also performed (n = 964).
EXPOSURES: Plasma p-tau217 levels measured by immunoassay.
MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Aβ status, determined by CSF or Aβ PET biomarkers.
RESULTS: Participants had a mean (SD) age of 66.9 (9.9) years; 971 (33.3%) were 
Aβ positive by either CSF or PET, 1667 (57.2%) were women, and 1108 (38.1%) 
carried at least 1 APOE ε4 allele. As a stand-alone test, plasma p-tau217 
achieved a positive predictive value (PPV) of 79% (95% CI, 74-84) and an overall 
accuracy of 81% (95% CI, 80-82). In a 2-step workflow, the PPV and accuracy 
significantly increased to 91% (95% CI, 86-95). While this approach required 
screening of 677 individuals with plasma p-tau217 to identify 100 Aβ-positive 
individuals, compared to 536 participants when using PET alone, it reduced the 
need for PET testing to 124. Immunoassays demonstrated comparable PPVs to mass 
spectrometry (80% [95% CI, 74-86] vs 85% [95% CI, 81-90]; P = .12) but 
significantly lower overall accuracy (82% [95% CI, 79-84]% vs 88 [95% CI, 
86-90]; P < .001) and true Aβ-positive detection rate (49% [95% CI, 43-55] vs 
69% [95% CI, 64-75]; P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings highlight the potential of plasma 
p-tau217 as a stand-alone test-or when used in a sequential 2-step approach 
alongside PET or CSF testing-as a cost-effective, scalable, and minimally 
burdensome strategy for identifying preclinical AD. Tailored screening workflows 
that incorporate p-tau217 can improve efficiency in participant selection for 
preclinical AD trials and, in the future, help guide access to disease-modifying 
treatments.

Neurodegenerative diseases (ND), marked by progressive neuronal degeneration, 
often involve dysregulation of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), a key enzyme in 
cholinergic neurotransmission. AChE inhibition is a well-established therapeutic 
strategy for Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent ND, as it aims to 
restore impaired cholinergic function. However, the effects of calcineurin 
inhibitors (CNIs), primarily used as immunosuppressants, on AChE activity remain 
largely unexplored. Recent evidence suggests CNIs possess neuroprotective 
properties, highlighting their potential for ND treatment. This study evaluated 
the binding affinities of FDA-approved CNIs-Tacrolimus (Tac), Pimecrolimus 
(Pim), Cyclosporine A (Csa), and Voclosporin (Voc)-to AChE via molecular docking 
and molecular dynamic simulation. AChE inhibition was assessed in vitro using 
the Ellman method and in H2O2-induced degenerative neuron-like SH-SY5Y cells via 
ELISA and qRT-PCR. Neuroprotection was examined through MTT assays and neurite 
analysis. Additionally, the antiapoptotic effect was examined by ELISA analysis 
measuring caspase-3. Docking studies confirmed strong AChE binding for all CNIs, 
with Voc exhibiting the highest affinity. Voc demonstrated superior in vitro 
AChE inhibition, surpassing galantamine at low concentrations. Cellular assays 
showed that CNIs, particularly Voc, significantly inhibited AChE expression at 
the gene level. Moreover, Voc markedly restored cell viability and reduced 
neuronal degeneration in H2O2-treated cells. These findings suggest CNIs, 
especially Voc, as promising candidates for ND treatment, targeting AChE 
overactivity and oxidative stress.

The microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA) is an intricate bidirectional communication 
network that links intestinal microbiota with the central nervous system (CNS) 
through immune, neural, endocrine, and metabolic pathways. Emerging evidence 
suggests that dysregulation of the MGBA plays pivotal roles in the onset and 
progression of neurodegenerative diseases. This review outlines the key 
molecular mechanisms by which gut microbes modulate neuroinflammation, 
blood-brain barrier integrity, protein misfolding, and neuronal homeostasis. We 
discuss how microbial metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids, tryptophan 
derivatives, and bile acids, interact with host to influence CNS functions. 
Disease-specific features are described across Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's 
disease, Multiple sclerosis, and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, emphasizing the 
distinct and overlapping pathways through which gut dysbiosis may contribute to 
pathogenesis. We further explore the translational potential of 
microbiota-targeted therapies, including probiotics, fecal microbiota 
transplantation, dietary interventions, and small-molecule modulators. While 
preclinical results are promising, clinical trials reveal considerable 
variability, highlighting the need for personalized approaches and robust 
biomarkers. Challenges remain in deciphering causal relationships, accounting 
for inter-individual variability, and ensuring reproducibility in therapeutic 
outcomes. Future research should integrate multi-omics strategies, longitudinal 
human cohorts, and mechanistic models to clarify the role of the MGBA in 
neurodegeneration. Collectively, understanding the MGBA provides a 
transformative perspective on neurodegenerative disease mechanisms and offers 
innovative therapeutic avenues that bridge neurology, microbiology, and 
precision medicine.

Limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE) is a common 
substrate of dementia in the elderly. LATE and Alzheimer's disease (AD) share 
similar clinical features, and their underlying neuropathological 
changes-LATE-NC and ADNC-commonly co-occur. However, the histomorphological and 
molecular features of TDP-43 pathology in LATE-NC with or without coexisting 
ADNC are not yet well understood. We performed immunohistochemistry in 
paraffin-embedded tissue from the hippocampus, amygdala, and temporal and 
frontal cortices of 108 human autopsy cases including 20 cognitively unimpaired 
controls, 20 AD dementia cases with moderate-high severity of ADNC without 
LATE-NC (ADNC group), 34 AD dementia cases with LATE-NC (ADNC + LATE-NC group), 
17 dementia cases with LATE-NC but no/low ADNC (pure LATE-NC group), and 17 
FTLD-TDP Type A cases. We assessed TDP-43 aggregate morphology and composition 
using antibodies against different TDP-43 epitopes: pS409/410, pS403/pS404, and 
C- and N-terminal TDP-43. We also investigated nuclear clearance of 
physiological TDP-43 and cytoplasmic colocalization of TDP-43 and tau proteins. 
Pure LATE-NC cases were on average 10 years older at death than ADNC + LATE-NC, 
had less cognitive impairment, higher prevalence of argyrophilic grain disease 
(AGD) pathology, aging-related tau astrogliopathy (ARTAG), and APOEε2 allele. 
They also tended to show lower APOEε4 frequencies, but similar frequencies of 
hippocampal sclerosis and LATE-NC stages. Importantly, LATE-NC predominantly 
displayed a mesh-like neuritic TDP-43 pattern in the hippocampus, extending from 
CA1/2 to subiculum. This mesh-like pattern was present in 81% of pure LATE-NC 
cases and only in 18% of ADNC + LATE-NC. This pattern was also observed in 53% 
of FTLD-TDP Type A cases. Moreover, the aggregate composition differed in pure 
LATE-NC and ADNC + LATE-NC, with LATE-NC cases exhibiting increased burdens of 
several phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated TDP-43 species, while only the 
pS409/pS410 epitope was significantly associated with ADNC + LATE-NC in the 
amygdala. Nuclear clearance patterns also tended to differ between pure LATE-NC 
and ADNC + LATE-NC. Similar to ADNC + LATE-NC, TDP-43 and tau proteinopathies 
colocalized in pure LATE-NC with comorbid primary age-related tauopathy (PART) 
or low ADNC. These data suggest that LATE-NC tends to be modified in the 
presence of moderate-high ADNC. These differences may reflect upstream 
influences (age, genetics, and environmental risk factors), direct 
protein-protein interactions, and/or other impacts of ADNC-related mechanisms on 
TDP-43 proteinopathy, potentially relevant for clinical trial design and future 
therapeutic applications.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) represents a formidable challenge in neurology, 
characterized by progressive neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. 
Traditional therapeutic approaches have failed to deliver significant outcomes, 
underscoring the need for innovative paradigms such as precision medicine. The 
review explores integrating genomic, biomarker-driven, and individualized 
therapeutic strategies to tackle AD. It examines the role of key genetic 
factors, including APOE and MTHFR polymorphisms, in influencing disease 
susceptibility and treatment responses. Advances in biomarker technologies, such 
as blood-based and imaging biomarkers, are highlighted for their potential in 
early diagnosis and patient stratification. Additionally, the review underscores 
the importance of tailoring interventions across different stages of AD, 
incorporating lifestyle modifications and emerging tools like artificial 
intelligence & recent patented technologies. Precision medicine offers a 
transformative pathway, aiming to deliver personalized, effective care that 
addresses the complex and multifactorial nature of AD. The paradigm shift 
promises improved clinical outcomes and enhanced patient quality of life.

Blood-based biomarkers are an easily available and practical tool for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) screening and diagnosis. Plasma phosphorylated Tau217 
(p-tau217) is the front-runner candidate for AD diagnosis due to its strong 
correlation with core AD pathology determined either by cerebrospinal fluid 
biomarker (CSF) and positron emission tomography (PET) or postmortem 
examination. While plasma p-tau217 is firmly associated with AD pathology, it is 
crucial to evaluate its performance in distinguishing AD from mixed pathologies, 
as brain autopsies have shown the coexisting of AD pathology with other related 
types of dementia. Moreover, the measurement of AD biomarkers will be a crucial 
element in defining eligibility for disease-modifying treatment in clinical 
practice. Moreover, plasma p-tau217 is a highly efficacious biomarker in the 
early detection of Aβ pathology, making it a feasible test for AD screening in 
clinical practice. Several assays, including the ALZpath p-tau217 assay and the 
Fujirebio plasma p-tau217 assay, have been made commercially available for 
research use. A few studies analytically and clinically have validated these 
immunoassays as laboratory diagnostic tests for AD diagnosis and differentiating 
from non-AD neurodegenerative disorders in clinical practice.

INTRODUCTION: Cerebrovascular disease is elevated across the Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) continuum in adults with Down syndrome (DS), but regional change within 
individuals is unknown.
METHODS: Participants from the Alzheimer's Biomarker Consortium-Down Syndrome 
(ABC-DS) study (n = 187) had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans quantified 
for white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume. Annualized WMH change was assessed 
across cognitive diagnostic groups defined by progression or stability between 
two visits (78% remained cognitively stable (CS), 6% progressed from CS to mild 
cognitive impairment [MCI]-DS, 5% remained MCI-DS, 6% progressed from MCI-DS to 
AD, 4% remained AD).
RESULTS: Compared to those who remained CS, WMH changes, particularly in 
posterior regions, over time were faster in advanced diagnostic groups (i.e., 
MCI-DS to AD, AD at both timepoints). Monotonic increase across progressive 
diagnostic groups suggest an acceleration in WMH over time.
CONCLUSION: Posterior WMH accelerates with AD progression in adults with DS 
beginning at the progression from MCI-DS to AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: White matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume increased and decreased 
over time in adults with Down syndrome. WMH decreased over time in the 
cognitively stable group. WMH increased over time in advanced Alzheimer's 
disease diagnostic groups. Change in posterior WMH accelerated across 
progressive Alzheimer's disease groups.

The Efficacy and Safety of Amyloid Beta-Directed Monoclonal Antibodies for 
Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Phase III 
Randomized Controlled Trials.

Wei Y(1), Li H(1).

Author information:

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. 
One of the newer treatments for AD is amyloid beta (Aβ) directed monoclonal 
antibodies (mAbs). This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the 
efficacy and safety of this class of drugs.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted across Scopus, Web of 
Science, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library until January 30, 2025, focusing on 
phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating anti-Aβ mAbs.
RESULTS: Twelve RCTs with 24 arms were included. Anti-Aβ mAbs significantly 
reduced the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) score (mean 
difference (MD): -0.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) (-0.29, -0.04)), 
Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) score (MD: 
-0.87, 95% CI (-1.13, -0.60)), and amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) 
standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) (MD: -0.11, 95% CI (-0.19, -0.02)). They 
also significantly increased the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score (MD: 
0.31, 95% CI (0.15, 0.46)) and Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities 
of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) score (MD: 1.21, 95% CI (0.89, 1.53)). However, they 
were associated with a significant increase in complications, including 
amyloid-related imaging abnormalities-edema/effusion (ARIA-E) (odds ratio (OR): 
10.20, 95% CI (7.17, 14.50)), ARIA-hemosiderosis or microhemorrhage (ARIA-H) 
(OR: 1.75, 95% CI (1.22, 2.50)), and any adverse events (OR: 1.22, 95% CI (1.08, 
1.38), I2: 48.59%)). The subgroup analysis showed that treatment administered in 
the early/preclinical stages of AD resulted in a greater reduction in CDR-SB and 
ADAS-Cog scores, as well as in amyloid burden.
CONCLUSIONS: Anti-Aβ mAbs offer modest clinical benefits, and pose some serious 
complications, necessitating a cautious approach to their prescription.

INTRODUCTION: Oxidative stress may contribute to brain injury in the Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) continuum. The antioxidant glutathione (GSH) can be assessed with 
magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Because the relationship between GSH and 
vascular brain injury is unknown in the AD continuum, we address this gap in 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
METHODS: 3T Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/MRS data were obtained from 31 
patients with MCI. GSH and total N-acetylaspartate (tNAA; neuroaxonal integrity 
marker) were measured in posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and frontal white 
matter (FWM). Cerebrovascular injury was assessed using white matter 
hyperintensity (WMH) volume. Global and regional brain tissue integrity were 
assessed using normalized brain (NBV) and hippocampal volumes.
RESULTS: Significant associations were reported in FWM between GSH/total 
creatine (tCr) and tNAA/tCr, and between GSH and both WMH and NBV. tNAA, 
GSH/tCr, and tNAA/tCr were higher in PCC than in FWM.
DISCUSSION: Our results suggest that oxidative stress contributes to vascular 
brain injury in MCI.
HIGHLIGHTS: Neuronal, vascular, and oxidative injuries occur in the Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) spectrum. Glutathione (GSH) is the main endogenous antioxidant in 
the brain. Brain GSH can be measured with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). 
We measured brain GSH level in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Low 
GSH level was associated with vascular brain injury, neuroaxonal damage, and 
atrophy.

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have made significant progress in the treatment of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, mAbs are associated with adverse effects, 
including Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormality (ARIA), which manifests as edema 
or effusion (ARIA-E) and hemorrhage (ARIA-H). The mechanisms behind these 
effects are not yet fully understood. Moreover, spontaneous ARIA has been 
insufficiently explored, and mAb therapies, particularly lecanemab, have mainly 
focused on patients with the APOE-ε4 allele carrier. This review aims to address 
this gap by examining the mechanisms of spontaneous ARIA, ARIA induced by mAbs, 
and the influence of genetic variants on ARIA development. The 
autoantibody-Aβ-mediated immune response targets excessive Aβ deposits, 
increasing immune activity through microglial reactivity. The heightened immune 
response, driven by Aβ accumulation in blood vessels, promotes angiopathy and 
inflammation, potentially contributing to spontaneous ARIA. The APOE-ε4 allele 
carrier is more strongly associated with ARIA-E because it redistributes Aβ 
deposition from the brain to blood vessels, influencing microglial reactivity. 
The redistribution enhances vascular integrity and reduces the risk of ARIA-H. 
However, it also increases the likelihood of ARIA-E due to Aβ accumulation in 
the vasculature, triggering inflammation. In contrast, the development of ARIA-H 
is linked to increased TREM2 expression and microglial reactivity, leading to 
impaired vascular integrity and disrupted matrix remodeling, which worsens the 
condition. Additionally, the adverse effects of mAbs may extend beyond the 
APOE-ε4 allele, possibly impacting other genetic variants involved in microglial 
reactivity, Aβ redistribution, and vascular integrity.

Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, 
and Huntington's disease, are characterized by the progressive loss of neuronal 
function and structure, leading to severe morbidity and mortality. Current 
therapeutic approaches are ineffective at stopping or reversing disease 
progression. Stem cell therapy has emerged as a promising candidate in research 
and treatment. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are considered ideal candidates for 
regenerative medicine because of their high proliferation rate and 
multi-differentiation potential. MSCs can differentiate into neurons and glial 
cells, modulate immune responses, and reduce inflammation, and their exosomes 
can promote neural repair and regulate neuronal function; thus, MSCs offer 
unique advantages for treating neurodegenerative diseases. However, challenges 
remain in optimizing cell delivery methods, ensuring the long-term survival and 
integration of transplanted cells, and fully understanding their therapeutic 
effects. This article primarily outlines the functions of MSCs in 
neurodegenerative diseases, with the intention that further research will fully 
harness their potential and translate these findings into clinical applications, 
offering new hope for patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifaceted neurodegenerative disease for which 
effective disease-modifying therapies are lacking. Mesenchymal stem cell-derived 
exosomes (MSC-Exos) have emerged as a promising therapeutic approach due to 
their unique biological functions and favorable biocompatibility. This review 
systematically explores the mechanism of action of MSC-Exos in AD therapy, 
including the removal of β-amyloid via the delivery of degradative enzymes, 
modulation of neuroinflammation, and promotion of neural regeneration. 
Meanwhile, this paper summarizes recent advances in preclinical and clinical 
studies, and analyzes the challenges in production standardization, safety 
assessment, and long-term efficacy validation of exosome therapies. Finally, 
several innovative strategies are proposed to enhance the therapeutic potential 
of MSC-Exos, including exosome functionalization and targeting optimization, 
gene editing techniques. This aims to promote the translation of exosomes from 
basic research to clinical application.

Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that is 
characterized by toxic Amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles 
(NFTs). Treatment options include the use of human umbilical cord mesenchymal 
stem cell (hUC-MSC)-based therapy. Its secretome contains healing substances 
such as neprilysin (CD10), which breaks down Aβ42; anti-inflammatory cytokines, 
which lower inflammation; and growth factors, which promote neuronal 
regeneration. The aim of this study was to produce hUC-MSC secretomes 
preconditioned with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and/or interferon-gamma 
(IFN-γ) to enhance the secretion of these healing substances. hUC-MSCs were 
sub-cultured in T-25 flasks at a seeding density of 5×103 cells/cm2 in 10 mL 
xeno-free medium. hUC-MSCs were preconditioned with TNF-α only, IFN-γ only, and 
a combination of TNF-α and IFN-γ. This study used 10 ng/mL TNF-α and 20 ng/mL 
IFN- γ. The secretome was harvested after 48 hours of preconditioning and then 
filtered through a 0.22 µm filter. In vitro tests were conducted to assess the 
effects of the secretome on neuronal survival using the neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y 
cell line. These cells were differentiated with retinoic acid (RA) and then 
exposed to Aβ42 to mimic Alzheimer's disease neurons. Secretome therapy was 
applied at concentrations of 5%, 10%, and 20% to evaluate neuroprotective 
effects. Four types of secretome were tested: unpreconditioned, TNF-α 
preconditioned, IFN-γ preconditioned, and a combination of TNF-α and IFN-γ. High 
levels of CD10 (neprilysin) expression were observed in hUC-MSCs treated with 
IFN-γ and TNF-α, although they did not release sufficient soluble neprilysin 
(sNEP). Viability results indicated that secretomes preconditioned with IFN-γ at 
10% and 20% concentrations provided the highest increase in cell viability after 
72 hours post-therapy. The combination of TNF-α and IFN-γ preconditioned 
secretome exhibited synergistic effects, particularly at 5% and 10% doses at 24- 
and 72-hours post- therapy. In conclusion, preconditioned hUC-MSC secretome 
represents a promising therapeutic approach for Alzheimer's disease, as it 
enhances neuronal cell viability and promotes neuronal regeneration. However, 
further studies are required to optimize sNEP release and maximize therapeutic 
efficacy in in vivo models.

OBJECTIVE: To compare PET and plasma-based temporal modeling of amyloid and tau 
biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease.
METHODS: Longitudinal amyloid PET, 18F-flortaucipir tau-PET, and Fujirebio 
Lumipulse plasma p-tau217 from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) and University of Pennsylvania Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (Penn 
ADRC) were used to generate biomarker trajectory models using Sampled Iterative 
Local Approximation (SILA). SILA models using plasma p-tau217 were compared to 
amyloid and tau PET-based models to estimate tau onset age (ETOA) and estimate 
amyloid onset age (EAOA), and factors influencing ETOA and time from ETOA to 
dementia were evaluated for PET and plasma-based models.
RESULTS: Plasma-based models generated similar results to PET for EAOA and ETOA, 
with stronger model agreement for ETOA than EAOA. Accuracy of estimated onset 
age compared to actual onset age was high within modality with slightly greater 
error when comparing across modalities (i.e. plasma to PET). For both plasma and 
PET models, earlier ETOA was associated with younger EAOA, female sex, and ≥1 
ApoE ε4 allele. Earlier dementia onset after ETOA was associated with later ETOA 
for both plasma and PET models, while male sex was associated with shorter tau 
to dementia gap in plasma models.
INTERPRETATION: Temporal modeling of plasma biomarkers provides comparable 
information to PET-based models, particularly for tau onset age. Plasma-based 
temporal modeling can serve as a widely accessible tool for clinical assessment 
of biological disease duration that places the patient on the disease timeline, 
which may allow for improved discussion of prognosis and treatment decisions.

Poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) polymerase-1 (PARP1) has been implicated in DNA damage 
responses and neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet its role in 
amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology remains unclear. Here, we show that PARP1 activation 
drives Aβ pathology and neurodegeneration. Using a sensitive ELISA, we observed 
significantly elevated PAR levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients 
with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD compared to controls. In vitro, 
oligomeric Aβ1-42 activated PARP1 and induced DNA damage, while genetic or 
pharmacological inhibition of PARP1 conferred neuroprotection. In vivo, PARP1 
knockout in the 5XFAD mouse model of amyloidosis led to reduced amyloid plaque 
burden, preserved synaptic and neuronal integrity, attenuated glial activation 
and neuroinflammation, and rescued cognitive deficits. Mechanistically, PARP1 
deficiency decreased amyloid precursor protein (APP) and BACE1 levels, altered 
γ-secretase complex composition, and enhanced Aβ degradation via neprilysin. 
These findings position PARP1 as a critical mediator of Aβ toxicity and 
neurodegeneration, suggesting its inhibition as a promising therapeutic strategy 
for AD.

A hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is the 
progressive accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides across distinct brain 
regions. Anti-Aβ antibodies (Aβ-Abs) targeting specific Aβ variants are 
essential tools for AD research, diagnostics, and therapy. The monoclonal 
antibodies Aducanumab, Lecanemab, and Donanemab have recently been approved as 
the first disease-modifying treatments for early AD, highlighting the clinical 
importance of their exact binding profiles. In this study, we systematically 
characterized the binding and modification requirements of 20 Aβ-Abs, including 
biosimilars of Aducanumab, Lecanemab, and Donanemab, across monomeric, 
oligomeric, and aggregated Aβ forms. Array-based analysis of 20,000 modified Aβ 
peptides defined binding epitopes at single-residue resolution and revealed the 
impact of sequence variation, including familial AD mutations, as well as 
diverse post-translational modifications (PTMs). Notably, genetic variants such 
as H6R impaired binding of therapeutic Aβ-Abs like Aducanumab. Donanemab showed 
strong preference for pyroglutamate-modified AβpE3-10, while Lecanemab and 
Aducanumab exhibited aggregation- and sequence-context-dependent binding 
requirements. Comparison of peptide binding profiles with binding of full-length 
and aggregated Aβ via immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry, capillary 
immunoassays, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry on AD brain tissue 
revealed distinct aggregation-dependent binding behaviours. The valency- and 
context-dependence of Aducanumab binding, together with its preference for 
Ser8-phosphorylated Aβ, supports a dimerization-mediated binding mechanism. For 
Lecanemab, our data suggest that additional structural contributions beyond the 
minimal N-terminal epitope are required for binding to aggregated Aβ, which 
remain to be fully resolved. Together, this work provides the most comprehensive 
dataset to date on aggregation-dependent sequence and modification selectivity 
of Aβ-Abs. By integrating mutational, PTM, and aggregation contexts in a unified 
experimental framework, we establish a resource that enables rational selection 
of antibodies for research and diagnostic applications, and offers mechanistic 
insights that may inform the design and optimization of future therapeutic 
antibodies in AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), particularly its sporadic form (SAD, 95% AD patients), 
is strongly associated with the apolipoprotein E4 ApoE4 genotype and 
characterized by oxidative stress, iron dysregulation, and increased 
susceptibility to ferroptosis. Lithium, a well-established neuroprotective 
agent, has shown potential to mitigate several pathological mechanisms in AD, 
including ferroptosis. This study investigates the therapeutic potential of 
lithium chloride in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from a 
SAD patient with ApoE4/E4 genotype, and compared effects with those of isogenic 
gene-edited ApoE3/E3 control. Lithium treatment significantly improved cell 
viability in ApoE4/E4 iPSCs. It also reversed key ferroptosis phenotypes, 
including elevated cytosolic Fe²⁺, increased expression of divalent metal 
transporter 1, reduced level of glutathione peroxidase 4, enhanced lipid 
peroxidation, and excessive ROS production. Moreover, lithium normalized 
mitochondrial respiration and reduced proton leak, indicating preservation of 
mitochondrial function and protection against mitochondrial damage and cell 
death. Lithium also reduced the expression of type 1 InsP3 receptor (InsP3R-1) 
protein, a Ca²⁺ channel located on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. 
Together, these findings highlight lithium's inhibition of ferroptosis through 
modulation of iron metabolism, antioxidant defenses, and inhibition of disrupted 
Ca2+ signaling. Given its demonstrated efficacy in reversing ApoE4-driven 
cellular vulnerabilities, lithium salt warrants further investigation for the 
treatment of AD.

Alzheimer's and Parkinson disease pathology often co-occur, with amyloid-β and 
phosphorylated tau, found in 30-50% of idiopathic Parkinson disease cases. α 
-synuclein inclusions, a hallmark of Parkinson disease, are present in 50% of 
Alzheimer's cases and the co-expression of these pathologies is linked to faster 
cognitive decline and earlier death. Immune activation is a hallmark of both 
diseases, but current model systems primarily examine each pathology in 
isolation. As such, how these co-pathologies interact to drive inflammation and 
neuronal loss remain poorly understood. To address this, we developed a 
co-pathology mouse model combining tau, amyloid-β, and α-synuclein. Here, we 
show that co-pathologies synergistically trigger a distinct and amplified 
neuroimmune response, marked by robust expansion of CD4+ and CD8+ 
tissue-resident memory T cells and increased CD68+ microglia, a population of 
activated, phagocytosing microglia, compared to single pathology brains. These 
changes were abundant in the hippocampus and cortex, regions showing elevated 
amyloid-β protein pathology load and enhanced neuronal loss with co-pathology 
expression. Our findings demonstrate that co-pathologies act synergistically to 
enhance immune activation prior to neurodegeneration. This model provides a 
platform for assessing mixed-pathology mechanisms and identifies key immune cell 
populations that may drive disease acceleration across Alzheimer's, Parkinson 
disease and their related dementias.

Brain large artery dilatation increases the risk for Alzheimer's disease 
pathology.

Simpson D, Morrone CD, Wear D, Khani A, Liu F, Gutierrez J, Yu WH.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementia cases are increasing globally, 
emphasizing the urgent need to clarify disease mechanisms for translational 
application in diagnoses and treatment. Vascular alterations represent a major 
pathological feature of AD, and beyond the well-established roles of small 
vessel disease and large artery atherosclerosis, our group has previously 
demonstrated that brain large artery dilatation is associated with elevated risk 
of dementia and Alzheimer pathology. The most severe manifestation of this 
non-atherosclerotic arterial phenotype is dolichoectasia, an enlargement of 
large blood vessels (Gutierrez et al., 2019; Melgarejo et al., 2024). Despite 
consistent epidemiological evidence across populations, the mechanistic link 
between arterial dilatation and AD remains poorly understood. To address this 
gap, we induced dolichoectasia in App NL-G-F mice, a model of amyloid pathology, 
by injecting elastase into the cisterna magna. After three months, brains were 
examined using biochemical and immunohistochemical methods. Elastase-treated 
mice exhibited a significant increase in amyloid plaques in the hippocampus ( p 
= 0.021 ) and cortex ( p = 0.029 ) compared with vehicle-treated controls. 
Neuronal loss was evident in the CA1 region of the hippocampus ( p = 0.036 ), 
with a trend towards neurodegeneration in CA3 (p = 0.055). We also observed 
elevated p62 in the hippocampus and cortex ( p = 0.009 and p = 0.001 , 
respectively), suggesting impaired protein or autophagic-lysosomal clearance. 
Although no overt increase in neuroinflammation or astrogliosis was detected at 
this time point, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) levels were trending towards 
elevated levels (p = 0.058). Combined, these findings indicate successful 
elastase-induced brain arterial dilatation accelerates AD-related pathology in 
App NL-G-F mice, providing mechanistic evidence that large artery dilatation may 
contribute directly to Alzheimer's disease progression.

The Src homology 2 (SH2) domain containing inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase 
1 (SHIP1) is an immune cell specific enzyme that regulates 
phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-trisphosphate signaling at the plasma membrane 
following receptor activation. SHIP1 plays an important role in processes such 
as directed cell migration, endocytosis, and cortical membrane oscillations. 
Alterations in SHIP1 expression have been shown to perturb myeloid cell 
chemotaxis and differentiation. In the brain, SHIP1 regulate microglial cell 
behaviors, which has been linked to Alzheimer's disease. Understanding the 
structural and functional relationships of SHIP1 is critical for developing ways 
to modulate SHIP1 membrane localization and lipid phosphatase activity during 
immune cell signaling. Recently, we discovered that the N-terminal SH2 domain of 
SHIP1 suppresses lipid phosphatase activity. SHIP1 autoinhibition can be 
relieved through interactions with receptor-derived phosphotyrosine (pY) 
peptides presented on membranes or in solution. Using hydrogen-deuterium 
exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) we identified intramolecular contacts 
between the N-terminal SH2 domain and CBL1 motif of the C2 domain that limit 
SHIP1 membrane localization and activity. Single molecule measurements of 
purified SHIP1 on supported lipid bilayers and in neutrophil-like cells support 
a model in which the SH2 domain blocks membrane binding of the central catalytic 
module. Mutations that disrupt autoinhibition enhance the membrane binding 
frequency and increase the catalytic efficiency of SHIP1. Although dimerization 
of SHIP1 enhances membrane localization and the apparent phosphatase activity, 
it is not required for SHIP1 autoinhibition. Overall, our results provide new 
insight concerning SHIP1's structural organization, membrane binding dynamics, 
and the mechanism of autoinhibition.

INTRODUCTION: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are commonly 
prescribed for depression in Alzheimer's disease (AD), however their effects on 
glucose metabolism remain poorly understood. We conducted a systematic review 
and meta-analysis to evaluate SSRI effects on brain glucose metabolism and 
metabolic adverse events in AD patients.
METHODS: Following PRISMA 2020 guidelines, we searched multiple databases up to 
July 11, 2025 for studies investigating SSRI effects on glucose-related outcomes 
in AD patients. Despite significant heterogeneity in study designs and 
populations, we performed meta-analyses for adverse events and coordinate-based 
meta-analysis for neuroimaging data. We performed meta-analyses for adverse 
events and coordinate-based meta-analysis for neuroimaging data. Advanced 
Bayesian hierarchical modeling and Markov simulations projected long-term 
metabolic outcomes.
RESULTS: Twelve studies with total included 7143 participants met our inclusion 
criteria, including nine randomized controlled trials and three observational 
studies. Brain FDG-PET revealed SSRI use restored dorsal raphe nucleus 
hypometabolism (standardized mean difference 0.87, 95 % CI: 0.52-1.22, 
P-value = 0.001). Meta-analysis demonstrated increased gastrointestinal adverse 
events (risk ratio 2.15, 95 % CI: 1.68-2.76, P-value<0.001, with moderate 
between-study heterogeneity), with sertraline showing highest rates. Citalopram 
30 mg provided significant weight loss protection (risk ratio 0.13, 95 % CI: 
0.02-0.98, P-value = 0.02), though this exceeds the recommended 20 mg maximum 
dose for elderly patients due to cardiac safety considerations. Long-term 
diabetes incidence showed no increased risk (hazard ratio 0.75, 95 % CI: 
0.50-1.12, P-value = 0.15). Bayesian modeling revealed 85 % probability of 
beneficial brain metabolic effects and 89 % probability of citalopram 
superiority for weight protection.
CONCLUSIONS: SSRIs restore brain glucose metabolism in AD patients while causing 
manageable peripheral metabolic effects. Citalopram appears the best for 
weight-sensitive patients, while sertraline requires gastrointestinal 
monitoring. These findings support SSRI safety for metabolic outcomes in AD 
treatment, however longer-term studies with controlled metabolic outcomes are 
needed to confirm our findings. The observed citalopram weight protection 
benefit was documented at 30 mg daily, which exceeds recommended dosing limits 
for elderly patients due to cardiac safety concerns.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Neurological disorders are a group of diseases 
involving motor, sensory, cognitive, and autonomic functions, among which 
stroke, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD) are prevalent. 
Their management, especially in conditions with chronic courses or long-term 
sequelae, remains a substantial unmet need. With the growing comprehension of 
neuroscience, the development of digital technology, and the rising demand for 
quality of life, wearable devices offer a promising solution for disease 
management. The review aimed to evaluate the application and prospect of 
wearable devices in neurological disorders.
METHODS: We conducted the review by searching papers on the application of 
wearable devices and wearable technology in neurology and neurological disorders 
using multiple databases. We summarized the present development status of 
wearable devices, and outlined the potential value and future direction for 
further research.
KEY CONTENT AND FINDINGS: Existing wearable devices for neurological diseases 
can be applied to diagnosis and follow-up, as an electronic biomarker detector 
capturing subtle and objective changes in motor, sensory, and cognitive 
function. The devices can also be utilized for treatment and rehabilitation, 
mainly through exoskeletons and brain-computer interface. The application of 
wearable devices in neurology currently faces several critical limitations, 
including technical bottlenecks in the detection of fine motor and sensory 
functions, a lack of industry standards, and a limited sample size.
CONCLUSIONS: This review demonstrates the potential of wearable technology in 
people with neurological disorders, enabling disease management and clinical 
trials outside clinical settings in the future. Nevertheless, further research 
is required to develop lighter, more user-friendly devices with various 
functions. It is believed that with increasing demand and technical support, 
wearable devices would have a promising range of applications.

Neurodegenerative diseases-including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, 
Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-are characterized by 
progressive neuronal loss and complex pathological mechanisms such as protein 
aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation. Conventional 
therapies offer limited efficacy due to the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and lack 
of targeted delivery. Nanotechnology has emerged as a transformative strategy 
for precise brain-targeted treatment. This review summarizes recent advances in 
nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems, including polymeric nanoparticles, 
liposomes, inorganic nanomaterials, and biomimetic carriers, highlighting their 
design features, BBB-penetration mechanisms, and disease-specific applications. 
Emphasis is placed on stimuli-responsive nanocarriers that react to pH, reactive 
oxygen species, or enzyme activity, enabling site-specific drug release. 
Additionally, organelle-targeting strategies-particularly those directed at 
mitochondria and lysosomes-are explored for their role in subcellular precision 
therapy. The integration of diagnostic and therapeutic modalities in theranostic 
nanoplatforms is also discussed. By consolidating preclinical progress and 
emerging technologies, this review offers insights into the future of 
nanomedicine in treating neurodegenerative diseases and lays the groundwork for 
clinical translation.

The presented investigation attempts to unveil the structural characteristics, 
bioactivities, and potential application of Gymnopetalum cochinchinense-derived 
d-fructose-rich heteropolysaccharide (denoted as PS-HB5) for the treatment of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Structural analyses of the PS-HB5 evaluated by FT-IR, 
GC-MS, and NMR techniques reveal a novel repeating unit composed of d-glucose 
and d-fructose linked through (1 → 6)-glucosyl, (2 → 6)-fructosyl, and (2 → 
4)-fructosyl bonds, and possesses a molecular weight of 1.217 × 105 Da. The 
PS-HB5 exhibits strong antioxidant activity, as evidenced by its DPPH and ABTS 
radical scavenging rates of 84.12% and 74.14%, associated with the IC50 values 
of 0.80 and 3.06 mg.mL-1, respectively. In addition, the PS-HB5 shows an 
inhibition rate of 78.37% (IC50 = 221.96 μg.mL-1) toward nitric oxide (NO) 
production in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Cytotoxicity assays indicate selective 
inhibition of the PS-HB5 against HepG2 and KB cancer cell lines (IC50 = 449.95 
and 408.34 μg/mL), with minimal impact on MCF-7 and SK-LU-1. Interestingly, 
PS-HB5 demonstrates an outstanding AChE inhibitory effect, achieving 41.01% 
inhibition at 500 μg.mL-1, placing it among the most active AChE-inhibitory 
polysaccharides. These findings unveil the PS-HB5 potential as a candidate for 
the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by the deposition of senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and 
neuronal dysfunction, resulting in severe cognitive and memory decline. The root 
of the Scrophulariaceae plant Rehmannia glutinosa (Gaertn.) DC. (Rehmanniae 
radix; RR) and its product Rehmanniae radix praeparata (RRP) possess high 
nutritional and medicinal value. Both show therapeutic potential for AD in 
traditional medical settings. However, the differences in their bioactive 
components and the mechanisms of action underlying their anti-AD effects remain 
unclear.
METHODS: In this study, APP/PS1 mice were used as the animal model of AD. 
Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with Q-Exactive tandem mass 
spectrometry (MS/MS) (UPLC-QE-MS/MS), network pharmacology, proteomics, 
molecular docking, and 16S rRNA sequencing were used to investigate the 
differences in the medicinal components of RR and RRP and their mechanisms of 
action in the treatment of AD. The mechanisms of action of two identified 
critical components, ajugol and isoacteoside, were further verified in the 
D-galactose/AlCl3-induced Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mouse model of 
AD-with cognitive function evaluated using the Morris water maze and open-field 
tests-and the amyloid-beta (Aβ)-induced BV2 cell model of inflammation.
RESULTS: Ajugol and isoacteoside were identified as the key anti-AD bioactive 
compounds in RR and RRP, respectively, through UPLC-QE-MS/MS. Integrated network 
pharmacology, proteomics, and 16S rRNA sequencing implicated neuroinflammation, 
apoptosis, and autophagy as critical pathways for their anti-AD effects. 
Subsequently, in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrated that ajugol exerted 
its effects mainly by modulating the TLR/NF-κB/NLRP3 and BCL-2/BAX/cytochrome 
C/caspase-3 pathways, while isoacteoside primarily acted via the 
LC3-Ⅱ/P62/p-mTOR/mTOR pathway. Ajugol and isoacteoside mitigated cognitive 
impairment in AD models, decreased Aβ plaque accumulation in hippocampal 
tissues, and attenuated inflammatory injury-induced cytotoxicity in BV2 
microglia, thereby suppressing AD progression.
CONCLUSION: In this work, we systematically elucidated the differential 
mechanisms underlying the anti-AD effects of ajugol and isoacteoside. We found 
that ajugol primarily acts via the TLR/NF-κB/NLRP3 and BCL-2/BAX/cytochrome 
C/caspase-3 pathways, while isoacteoside acts via the LC3-II/P62/p-mTOR/mTOR 
pathway. These findings establish a foundation for developing RRP-based 
complementary medicines and functional foods.

INTRODUCTION: Extrasynaptic GluN2B N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (ES-GluN2B) 
are localized outside synapses and promote excitotoxic signaling, apoptosis, and 
long-term depression (LTD) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Polysialylated neural 
cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM) physiologically inhibits ES-GluN2B activity, 
and its downregulation is associated with impaired synaptic plasticity. However, 
the spatiotemporal changes of ES-GluN2B and PSA-NCAM during brain aging versus 
AD remain poorly understood.
METHODS: We investigated GluN2A, GluN2B, ES-GluN2B, and PSA-NCAM expression 
across brain regions in young and old Tg2576 AD and wild-type (WT) mice. 
Additional experiments included PSD-95 pulldown assays, analysis of GluN2B 
phosphorylation at Ser1480, CRISPRa-driven ST8Sia4 upregulation in IMR-32 
neuroblastoma cells, and Aβ treatment to assess effects on PSA-NCAM biosynthetic 
enzymes.
RESULTS: Normal aging was associated with decreased GluN2B, increased GluN2A, 
stable ES-GluN2B, and elevated PSA-NCAM levels. In contrast, AD aging showed 
elevated ES-GluN2B and reduced PSA-NCAM, particularly in the hippocampus and 
cortex, with no change in total NCAM expression. PSD-95 pulldown revealed 
increased extrasynaptic GluN2B in aged AD brains. AD aging was associated with 
elevated phosphorylation of GluN2B at Ser1480 by casein kinase 2 (CK2), 
promoting GluN2B redistribution to extrasynaptic sites. CRISPRa-driven ST8Sia4 
upregulation increased PSA-NCAM and reduced pGluN2B expression supporting a 
direct regulatory role for PSA-NCAM in GluN2B trafficking. Additionally, Aβ 
suppressed PSA-NCAM biosynthetic enzymes ST8Sia4 and UDP-E linking Aβ to 
impaired polysialylation.
DISCUSSION: These findings highlight distinct regulatory patterns of ES-GluN2B 
and PSA-NCAM in AD versus normal aging and support a model in which impaired 
PSA-NCAM buffering facilitates pathological ES-GluN2B signaling and plasticity 
loss in AD progression.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative 
disorder characterized by synaptic dysfunction and cognitive decline. Increasing 
evidence implicates systemic metabolic dysregulation in AD pathogenesis, yet it 
remains unclear whether modulation of peripheral lipid and glucose metabolism 
can alter disease progression.
METHODS: We investigated the effects of two FDA-approved metabolic 
agents-Alirocumab, a PCSK9 inhibitor that lowers LDL cholesterol, and 
Gliclazide, a sulfonylurea that enhances insulin secretion-in male 5xFAD mice, a 
transgenic model of AD. Animals received chronic treatment for five months. 
Behavioral testing, hippocampal electrophysiology, ELISA, lipidomics, and 
adipokine profiling were performed to assess cognitive, synaptic, and molecular 
outcomes.
RESULTS: Alirocumab significantly improved spatial working memory, restored 
hippocampal long-term potentiation, and normalized synaptophysin expression. 
Gliclazide reduced neuroinflammation and partially preserved glial and neuronal 
markers. Both treatments decreased amyloid burden and modulated adipokine 
levels, with Alirocumab elevating leptin and omentin in brain and serum. 
Lipidomic profiling of visceral adipose tissue revealed distinct lipid 
remodeling and highlighted candidate pathways linking systemic metabolism to 
central nervous system outcomes.
DISCUSSION: These findings demonstrate that systemic modulation of lipid and 
glucose metabolism can influence neurodegenerative and synaptic processes in AD. 
The results support metabolic interventions as a potential strategy to modify AD 
progression through peripheral-central metabolic crosstalk.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease has been considered one of the most dangerous 
neurodegenerative health problems. This disease, which is characterized by 
memory loss, leads to conditions that adversely affect daily life. Early 
diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment and is achieved through various 
imaging technologies. However, these methods are quite costly and their results 
depend on the expertise of the specialist physician. Therefore, deep learning 
techniques have recently been utilized as decision support tools for Alzheimer's 
disease.
METHODS: In this research, the detection of Alzheimer's disease was investigated 
using a deep learning model applied to electroencephalography signals, taking 
advantage of olfactory memory. The dataset comprises three categories: healthy 
individuals, those with amnestic mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's 
disease patients. The proposed model integrates three distinct feature types 
through a transformer-based fusion approach for classification. These feature 
vectors are derived from the Common Spatial Pattern, Covariance matrix-Tangent 
Space and a Tunable Q-Factor wavelet coefficient mapping.
RESULTS: The results demonstrated that subject-based classification of rose 
aroma attained a 93.14% accuracy using EEG-recorded olfactory memory responses.
CONCLUSION: This output has demonstrated superiority over EEG-based results 
reported in the literature.

OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aimed to synthesize current clinical evidence 
from randomized controlled trial (RCT) and meta-analyses on the efficacy and 
safety of TCM in the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease (AD).
METHODS: Systematic searches across eight biomedical databases (PubMed, Embase, 
Web of Science, Cochrane Library, CNKI, Wanfang, VIP, SinoMed) through October 
26, 2024 yielded an evidence matrix, which was analyzed through integrated 
narrative-graphic synthesis.
RESULTS: Our analysis encompassed 187 studies (141 RCTs and 46 systematic 
reviews/meta-analyses), demonstrating cyclical publication growth with recent 
contraction. Study characteristics included sample sizes of 50-100 participants 
and intervention durations of 4-24 weeks. Interventions included acupuncture, 
herbal decoctions, and proprietary medicines. Outcomes focused on clinical 
efficacy, scale scores, TCM syndrome scores, and safety. While TCM demonstrated 
therapeutic potential, prescription heterogeneity and diagnostic ambiguity 
constrained specificity. Methodological quality was generally low, with few 
high-quality systematic reviews or meta-analyses.
CONCLUSION: While TCM shows therapeutic potential in Alzheimer's disease, 
methodological limitations persist. Subsequent research requires enhanced trial 
designs with standardized outcome metrics and rigorous bias control protocols.

Focused ultrasound-induced blood-brain barrier opening (FUS-BBBO) is a 
well-established neuroimmune modulation and drug delivery enhancement tool 
capable of effecting cellular, cognitive, and pathological benefits in the 
brain. However, the cellular mechanisms underlying these bioeffects remain 
incompletely characterized, motivating the present study investigating the role 
of a critical glial cell type: astrocytes. Here, we use single-cell RNA 
sequencing and flow cytometry to characterize the phenotypic response of 
hippocampal astrocytes 2, 4, and 7 days after FUS-BBBO exposure in aged WT and 
Alzheimer's disease mice. The data presented herein indicate that FUS-BBBO 
increases gene expression related to synapse modification, neurogenesis, ion 
transport, and neuronal development. Taken together, these data elucidate a 
glioprotective role for hippocampal astrocytes following FUS-BBBO, offering 
mechanistic context and support for previously observed benefits of FUS-BBBO. 
This evidence critically deepens our understanding of the cellular effects of 
FUS-BBBO as clinical adoption becomes more widespread.

While some studies have suggested that autonomous sensory meridian response 
(ASMR) can relieve anxiety, whether ASMR relieves anxiety in trait-anxious 
individuals and its neural mechanisms remain a question worth exploring. We used 
the self-threatening n-back paradigm to elicit state anxiety and an ASMR video 
to relieve anxiety. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was used to 
monitor frontal and temporal lobe activity to explore the neurophysiological 
changes when watching ASMR videos and then further explore the mechanism of 
self-reported "feelings" of ASMR. During the anxiety arousal phase, the 
hemodynamic responses (HR) of the middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and prefrontal 
cortex (PFC) were significantly enhanced in participants with high trait 
anxiety. Those with low-trait anxiety had significantly reduced HR of the 
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Compared with the non-ASMR video, the HR 
of the MFG, PFC, and DLPFC were significantly lower in participants who watched 
the ASMR video. When the experience of ASMR was reported, the HR of the premotor 
and auxiliary motor cortices, middle frontal lobe, and DLPFC were significantly 
reduced. While watching an ASMR video, brain activity is the opposite of when 
anxiety is elicited in people with high trait anxiety. The activated area when 
the participants were watching the ASMR video, and when they reported 
experiencing ASMR, overlapped with the anxiety-related parts of the brain. This 
provides neurophysiological evidence of how an ASMR video can relieve anxiety.

BACKGROUND: Despite emerging therapeutic options, Alzheimer´s disease (AD) 
management remains suboptimal due to multimodal pathogenesis. We investigated 
curcumin-donepezil combination therapy, as curcumin demonstrates antioxidant, 
anti-inflammatory, and anti-amyloidogenic properties that may complement 
donepezil's cholinesterase inhibition.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We employed the elav-Gal4/UAS-hAPP-BACE-1 
Drosophila melanogaster model alongside molecular docking simulation and ADMET 
prediction to evaluate curcumin-donepezil combination versus monotherapy. Fruit 
flies received the treatment regimen, and were tested for survival, memory 
performance, and biochemical markers, including BACE-1 activity and oxidative 
stress parameters.
RESULTS: Combination therapy significantly improved survival rates and memory 
performance compared to individual treatment. The combination effectively 
modulated multiple AD-related pathways, demonstrating reduced BACE-1 activity 
and decreased oxidative stress markers. Molecular docking confirmed favorable 
drug interactions, and ADMET profiles supported therapeutic viability.
CONCLUSIONS: Curcumin-donepezil combination therapy shows promise as a 
multi-target approach for AD management. However, translation to clinical 
applications requires validation in higher-order models and human trials.

Plain Language Summary: Alzheimer’s disease is a brain condition that affects 
memory and thinking. Current medicines only help with some symptoms but don’t 
treat all the different problems that cause the disease, so patients still get 
worse over time. We studied combining two treatments: donepezil (a current 
Alzheimer’s medicine) with curcumin (a natural compound from turmeric spice). 
Curcumin can fight harmful substances in the brain and reduce swelling. We 
wanted to see if using both together works better than using each one alone.We 
used fruit flies that were specially bred to have brain problems similar to 
Alzheimer’s disease. We gave different groups of flies either donepezil alone, 
curcumin alone, or both medicines together. Then we measured how long they 
lived, how well they remembered things, and checked for harmful substances in 
their brains. We also used computer models to predict how the two medicines 
would work together. Flies that received both medicines together lived longer 
and had better memory than flies that got only one medicine. The combination 
treatment also reduced harmful brain substances better than single treatments. 
Our computer tests showed the two medicines work well together and should be 
safe.Using curcumin and donepezil together might be a better way to treat 
Alzheimer’s disease because it attacks the disease from different angles. 
However, we need more studies in people to confirm safety and effectiveness.

INTRODUCTION: Genetic variations in the microtubule-associated protein tau 
(MAPT) gene play a central role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Two 
major MAPT haplotypes, H1 and H2, show differential associations with tau 
expression and AD risk. However, data from Middle Eastern populations remain 
limited, restricting our understanding of population-specific disease 
susceptibility patterns and therapeutic responses.
METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive literature review using PubMed, Scopus, 
and Web of Science databases. Search terms included "MAPT haplotype," 
"Alzheimer's disease," "H1 H2," "tau pathology," and "pharmacogenetics." We 
analyzed peer-reviewed articles published between 2000 and 2024, focusing on 
studies reporting haplotype frequencies, MAPT expression levels, APOE 
interactions, and clinical outcomes. This review synthesizes published data 
without generating new experimental results.
RESULTS: The H1 haplotype consistently associates with increased MAPT 
expression, tau accumulation, and elevated AD risk, particularly in APOE ε4 
noncarriers. Conversely, the H2 haplotype appears protective, correlating with 
reduced tau burden and slower cognitive decline. Notably, recent reports reveal 
significant overrepresentation of the H2 haplotype in the Jordanian population 
compared to European and East Asian cohorts, where H2 frequency is substantially 
lower or absent. This distinct genetic architecture suggests altered regional AD 
risk profiles.
DISCUSSIONS: The elevated H2 frequency in Jordan represents a unique 
population-specific genetic signature that may influence regional AD 
susceptibility patterns. These findings challenge current risk models 
predominantly based on European populations and suggest the need for 
populationtailored approaches in neurodegenerative disease research. The 
naturally H2-enriched Jordanian cohort provides an exceptional opportunity to 
investigate protective mechanisms against tau pathology.
CONCLUSION: MAPT haplotype distributions show significant population variation 
with important implications for AD risk assessment and therapeutic targeting. 
The high H2 frequency in Jordan warrants integration into personalized medicine 
frameworks and population-specific disease models, potentially informing more 
effective regional prevention and treatment strategies.

Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis (ALS), represent major healthcare challenges worldwide. 
Despite advances in diagnosis and treatment, these conditions remain incurable, 
and there is a need for more effective management strategies. The integration of 
artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare has emerged as a promising solution, 
offering new approaches to diagnosis, personalized treatment, and patient care. 
This paper explores the potential of AI to revolutionize the management of 
neurodegenerative diseases, with a focus on its synergistic role in pharmacy. By 
leveraging AI in drug discovery, personalized treatment plans, and clinical 
decision-making, AI can enhance therapeutic outcomes and improve patient quality 
of life. The study reviews the current landscape of AI applications in 
neurodegenerative disease management, with a focus on pharmacy-related 
interventions. The review includes AI-driven approaches in genomics, biomarkers, 
drug repurposing, and clinical trials. It also examines AI's role in optimizing 
pharmaceutical care, improving medication adherence, and tailoring treatments 
based on individual genetic profiles. AI has demonstrated its capability to 
analyze vast datasets, from genetic information to clinical records, to identify 
novel drug targets and predict patient responses to specific therapies. The use 
of AI in precision medicine has enabled more accurate diagnosis and has 
facilitated the development of personalized treatments for neurodegenerative 
diseases. Additionally, AI tools are enhancing medication management by 
providing personalized therapy adjustments and improving adherence. AI offers 
transformative potential for the future of neurodegenerative disease management. 
Its integration into pharmacy practice promises more effective, individualized 
treatments, accelerating drug discovery, and optimizing patient care. As AI 
technologies continue to advance, their role in managing complex neurological 
disorders will become increasingly vital.

Parkinson's Disease.

Parkinson's disease is the second most frequent neurodegenerative disease after 
Alzheimer's disease, and the most common neurodegenerative disease that causes 
movement dysfunction. Without innovations in prevention and treatment, the 
incidence and prevalence of Parkinson's disease is projected to increase by 
> 30% by 2030, making the development of new treatments an urgent priority. We 
previously investigated the association between melatonin receptor agonists and 
Parkinson's disease using the US Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event 
Reporting System (FAERS). The results showed that ramelteon may reduce the 
incidence of Parkinson's disease. However, since the US FAERS relies on 
spontaneous reports, which are susceptible to reporting bias, further validation 
using real-world data is required. This study investigated the association 
between ramelteon use and risk of developing Parkinson's disease using the DeSC 
database, a Japanese claims database reported to be representative of the 
general Japanese population. The association was evaluated using sequence 
symmetry analysis, with the adjusted sequence ratio (ASR) serving as the 
evaluation index. Our DeSC database analysis showed a negative association 
between ramelteon use and Parkinson's disease (ASR: 0.959, 95% confidence 
interval: 0.955-0.964). Our results support previous reports suggesting that 
ramelteon may help suppress the onset of Parkinson's disease. However, even 
though this study used real-world data, these results should be interpreted with 
caution, as a sequence symmetry analysis cannot be adjusted for covariates. 
Therefore, additional pharmacoepidemiological studies are needed to further 
verify the potential risk of Parkinson's disease associated with ramelteon use.

Proteomics: Revealing Significant Proteoform Differences Between Healthy and 
Alzheimer's Disease Brains.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by 
cognitive decline and pathological protein aggregation. Comprehensive 
quantitative proteomics of brain tissues from AD patients is critical for 
pursuing a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that drive AD 
progression. Here, we present one of the first quantitative top-down proteomics 
(TDP) studies of postmortem cortex samples from AD patients and healthy controls 
to profile their proteoform differences by coupling capillary zone 
electrophoresis (CZE, liquid-phase ion mobility) to tandem mass spectrometry 
(MS/MS). We identified 3191 unique proteoforms and uncovered a drastic 
transformation in the proteoform profile in AD compared to healthy controls. 
Over 2200 proteoforms were exclusively identified in either AD or healthy 
control samples, and 157 proteoforms identified in both AD and control samples 
showed statistically significant abundance differences between the two 
conditions. Gene Ontology and pathway analysis of the genes associated with 
those proteoforms revealed broad changes in biological processes in AD brains, 
for example, telomere organization, substantia nigra development, amyloid fibril 
formation, microtubule cytoskeleton organization, progressive neurological 
disorders, long-term synaptic potentiation, and axogenesis. These biological 
processes are highly associated with the development of AD. Our study revealed a 
pool of potential novel proteoform biomarkers of AD in human brain samples for 
early diagnosis and therapy development. SUMMARY: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a 
chronic neurodegenerative disease, destroying brain cells and causing thinking 
ability and memory to decline over time. Proteins (e.g., amyloid and tau) play 
key roles in the development of AD. Global and accurate protein measurement of 
human brains of AD patients and healthy controls will shed new light on the 
molecular mechanisms driving AD progression and discover new biomarkers for AD 
diagnosis and therapeutic development. Here, we performed the first 
CZE-MS/MS-based quantitative top-down proteomics (TDP) of a small cohort of AD 
human brain samples and healthy controls (5 AD and 5 control) to determine the 
differentially quantified proteoforms between the two health conditions. Over 
3000 proteoforms were identified, and only about 700 proteoforms were detected 
in both conditions, indicating drastically different proteoform profiles between 
the two conditions. The differentially quantified proteoforms (e.g., tau, 
neurogranin, and calmodulin-1 proteoforms) are associated with biological 
processes relevant to AD development, for example, amyloid fibril formation, 
microtubule disruption, synaptic transmission, and axogenesis. The results offer 
a deep view of the proteoform transformation in the AD human brain compared to 
the healthy control, providing potential proteoform biomarkers for AD diagnosis 
and proteoform targets for therapeutic development.

INTRODUCTION: We sought to harmonize genotype data from the predementia AMYPAD 
(Amyloid Imaging to Prevent Alzheimer's Disease) Consortium, compute polygenic 
risk scores (PRS), and determine their association with global amyloid 
deposition.
METHODS: Genetic data from five AMYPAD parent cohorts were harmonized, and PRS 
were computed for Alzheimer's disease (AD) susceptibility, cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) amyloid beta (Aβ)42, and CSF phosphorylated tau181. Cross-sectional 
amyloid (Centiloid [CL]) burden was available for all participants, and 
regression models determined if PRS were associated with CL burden.
RESULTS: After harmonization, data for 867 participants showed that high CL 
burden was most strongly predicted by CSF Aβ42 PRS compared to traditional AD 
susceptibility PRS.
DISCUSSION: This work emphasizes the importance of data harmonization and 
pooling of cohorts for large-powered studies. Findings suggest a genetic 
predisposition to amyloid pathology that may predispose individuals early in the 
AD continuum. This validates the potential use of PRS in clinical (trial) 
settings as a non-invasive tool to assess AD risk.
HIGHLIGHTS: We developed a robust harmonization pipeline for multi-cohort 
genotype array data. Cerebrospinal fluid amyloid beta (Aβ)-specific polygenic 
risk scores (PRS) more strongly predicted global Aβ positron emission tomography 
burden than other PRS. Results suggest a strong genetic predisposition to early 
Aβ pathology. This work highlights the need for robust data harmonization and 
data pooling. This work also validates the potential use of PRS as a 
non-invasive tool to assess Alzheimer's disease risk.

Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's often exhibit 
complex, multivariate longitudinal outcomes that require advanced statistical 
methods to comprehensively evaluate treatment efficacy. The Longitudinal Rank 
Sum Test (LRST) offers a nonparametric framework to assess global treatment 
effects across multiple longitudinal endpoints without requiring multiplicity 
corrections. This study develops a robust methodology for power and sample size 
estimation specific to the LRST, integrating theoretical derivations, asymptotic 
properties, and practical estimation techniques under large sample conditions. 
Validation through numerical simulations demonstrates the accuracy of the 
proposed methods, while real-world applications to clinical trials in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) highlight their practical
