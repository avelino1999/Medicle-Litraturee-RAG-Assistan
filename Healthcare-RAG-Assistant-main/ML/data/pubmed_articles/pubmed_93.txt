Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that 
affects the elderly population globally and there is an urgent demand for 
developing novel anti-AD agents. In this study, a new series of indole-isoxazole 
carbohydrazides were designed and synthesized. The structure of all compounds 
was elucidated using spectroscopic methods including FTIR, 1H NMR, and 13C NMR 
as well as mass spectrometry and elemental analysis. All derivatives were 
screened for their acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) 
inhibitory activity. Out of all synthesized compounds, compound 5d exhibited the 
highest potency as AChE inhibitor with an IC50 value of 29.46 ± 0.31 µM. It 
showed significant selectivity towards AChE, with no notable inhibition against 
BuChE. A kinetic study on AChE for compound 5d indicated a competitive 
inhibition pattern. Also, 5d exhibited promising BACE1 inhibitory potential with 
an IC50 value of 2.85 ± 0.09 µM and in vitro metal chelating ability against 
Fe3+. The molecular dynamic studies of 5d against both AChE and BACE1 were 
executed to evaluate the behavior of this derivative in the binding site. The 
results showed that the new compounds deserve further chemical optimization to 
be considered potential anti-AD agents.

Preventative treatment for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is dire, yet mechanisms 
underlying early regional vulnerability remain unknown. In AD, one of the 
earliest pathophysiological correlates to cognitive decline is 
hyperexcitability, which is observed first in the entorhinal cortex. Why 
hyperexcitability preferentially emerges in specific regions in AD is unclear. 
Using regional, cell-type-specific proteomics and electrophysiology in wild-type 
mice, we uncovered a unique susceptibility of the entorhinal cortex to human 
amyloid precursor protein (hAPP). Entorhinal hyperexcitability resulted from 
selective vulnerability of parvalbumin (PV) interneurons, with respect to 
surrounding excitatory neurons. This effect was partially replicated with an APP 
chimera containing a humanized amyloid-beta sequence. EC hyperexcitability could 
be ameliorated by co-expression of human Tau with hAPP at the expense of 
increased pathological tau species, or by enhancing PV interneuron excitability 
in vivo. This study suggests early interventions targeting inhibitory neurons 
may protect vulnerable regions from the effects of APP/amyloid and tau 
pathology.

The orphan G protein-coupled receptor 37 (GPR37), widely associated with 
Parkinson's disease (PD), undergoes proteolytic processing under physiological 
conditions. The N-terminus domain is proteolyzed by a disintegrin and 
metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM-10), which generates various membrane receptor forms 
and ectodomain shedding (ecto-GPR37) in the extracellular environment. We 
investigated the processing and density of GPR37 in several neurodegenerative 
conditions, including Lewy body disease (LBD), multiple system atrophy (MSA), 
corticobasal degeneration (CBD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). The presence of ecto-GPR37 peptides in the 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of PD, MSA, CBD and PSP patients was assessed through 
an in-house nanoluciferase-based immunoassay. This study identified increased 
receptor processing in early-stage LBD within the PFC and striatum, key brain 
areas in neurodegeneration. In MSA only the 52 kDa form of GPR37 appeared in the 
striatum. This form was also significantly elevated in the striatum of AD 
necropsies. On the contrary, GPR37 processing remained unchanged in the brains 
of CBD and PSP patients. Furthermore, while CSF ecto-GPR37 increased in PD 
patients, its levels remained unchanged in MSA, CBD, and PSP subjects. 
Importantly, patients with PD with rapid progression of the disease did not have 
elevated ecto-GPR37 in the CSF, while those with slow progression showed a 
significant increase, suggesting a possible prognostic use of ecto-GPR37 in PD. 
This research underscores the distinctive processing and density patterns of 
GPR37 in neurodegenerative diseases, providing crucial insights into its 
potential role as an indicator of PD progression rates.

This article delves into Alzheimer's disease (AD), a prevalent neurodegenerative 
condition primarily affecting the elderly. It is characterized by progressive 
memory and cognitive impairments, severely disrupting daily life. Recent 
research highlights the potential involvement of microRNAs in the pathogenesis 
of AD. MicroRNAs (MiRNAs), short non-coding RNAs comprising 20-24 nucleotides, 
significantly influence gene regulation by hindering translation or promoting 
degradation of target genes. This review explores the role of specific miRNAs in 
AD progression, focusing on their impact on β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide accumulation, 
intracellular aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins, mitochondrial 
dysfunction, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and the expression of the 
APOE4 gene. Our insights contribute to understanding AD's pathology, offering 
new avenues for identifying diagnostic markers and developing novel therapeutic 
targets.

Herein, we describe the design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of 15 
Contilisant+Tubastatin A hybrids. These ligands are polyfunctionalized indole 
derivatives developed by juxtaposing selected pharmacophoric moieties of 
Contilisant and Tubastatin A to act as multifunctional ligands. Compounds 3 and 
4 were identified as potent HDAC6 inhibitors (IC50 = 0.012 μM and 0.035 μM, 
respectively), so they were further evaluated in Drosophila and human cell 
models of Parkinson's disease (PD). Both compounds attenuated PD-like 
phenotypes, such as motor defects, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial 
dysfunction in PD model flies. Ligands 3 and 4 were also studied in the 
transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans CL2006 model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Both 
compounds were nontoxic, did not induce undesirable animal functional changes, 
inhibited age-related paralysis, and improved cognition in the thrashing assay. 
These results highlight 3 and 4 as novel multifunctional ligands that improve 
the features of PD and AD hallmarks in the respective animal models.

Clinical management and therapeutics development for Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
have entered a new era, with recent approvals of monoclonal antibody therapies 
targeting the underlying pathophysiology of the disease and modifying its 
trajectory. Imaging and fluid biomarkers are becoming increasingly important in 
the clinical development of AD therapeutics. This review focuses on the evidence 
of fluid biomarkers from recent amyloid-β-targeting clinical trials, summarizing 
biomarker data across 12 trials. It further proposes a simple framework to put 
biomarker guidance in the context of amyloid-pathway-targeted disease 
modification, delineates factors that impact biomarker data in clinical trials, 
and highlights knowledge gaps and future directions. Increased knowledge and 
data on biomarkers in the context of disease progression and disease 
modification will help to better design future AD trials and guide the clinical 
management of patients on AD-modifying therapies, bringing us closer to the 
implementation of precision medicine in AD.

INTRODUCTION: For over 25 years, cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) have been the 
main symptomatic treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Several meta-analyses 
have supported their effectiveness in various neurocognitive, functional, and 
behavioral aspects of amnestic AD. Over 86% of cases of the logopenic variant of 
primary progressive aphasia (lvPPA), also named language variant AD, are caused 
by a similar pathologic process than AD, yet no study has examined the efficacy 
of ChEIs in this AD variant. We aimed to explore the efficacy of ChEIs in the 
treatment of lvPPA by comparing their evolution on the MMSE, and other 
functional and behavioral parameters, to that of treated amnestic AD patients.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed in 45 patients with lvPPA 
and 52 patients with amnestic AD. Both groups were similar in terms of age, 
level of education, and onset of symptoms. Drug history and MMSE scores, as well 
as functional (activities of daily living [ADLs] and instrumental activities of 
daily living [IADLs]), neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms were 
collected on several time points before and after the introduction of ChEIs. 
Data were analyzed using ANOVA and a generalized linear mixed model.
RESULTS: Patients with lvPPA showed a similar trajectory of decline than 
amnestic AD patients on serial MMSEs up to 12-24 months after the introduction 
of ChEIs. There was a significant impact on ADLs but not IADLs and 
neuropsychiatric symptoms remained stable over time.
CONCLUSION: This study provides preliminary evidence for efficacy of ChEIs in 
patients with lvPPA and suggests similar benefits to those seen in amnestic AD 
patients, hence reassuring patients and their physicians.
INTRODUCTION: For over 25 years, cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) have been the 
main symptomatic treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Several meta-analyses 
have supported their effectiveness in various neurocognitive, functional, and 
behavioral aspects of amnestic AD. Over 86% of cases of the logopenic variant of 
primary progressive aphasia (lvPPA), also named language variant AD, are caused 
by a similar pathologic process than AD, yet no study has examined the efficacy 
of ChEIs in this AD variant. We aimed to explore the efficacy of ChEIs in the 
treatment of lvPPA by comparing their evolution on the MMSE, and other 
functional and behavioral parameters, to that of treated amnestic AD patients.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed in 45 patients with lvPPA 
and 52 patients with amnestic AD. Both groups were similar in terms of age, 
level of education, and onset of symptoms. Drug history and MMSE scores, as well 
as functional (activities of daily living [ADLs] and instrumental activities of 
daily living [IADLs]), neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms were 
collected on several time points before and after the introduction of ChEIs. 
Data were analyzed using ANOVA and a generalized linear mixed model.
RESULTS: Patients with lvPPA showed a similar trajectory of decline than 
amnestic AD patients on serial MMSEs up to 12-24 months after the introduction 
of ChEIs. There was a significant impact on ADLs but not IADLs and 
neuropsychiatric symptoms remained stable over time.
CONCLUSION: This study provides preliminary evidence for efficacy of ChEIs in 
patients with lvPPA and suggests similar benefits to those seen in amnestic AD 
patients, hence reassuring patients and their physicians.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with limited 
therapeutic options. Accordingly, new approaches for prevention and treatment 
are needed. One focus is the human microbiome, the consortium of microorganisms 
that live in and on us, which contributes to human immune, metabolic, and 
cognitive development and that may have mechanistic roles in neurodegeneration. 
AD and Alzheimer's disease-related dementias (ADRD) are recognized as spectrum 
disorders with complex pathobiology. AD/ADRD onset begins before overt clinical 
signs, but initiation triggers remain undefined. We posit that disruption of the 
normal gut microbiome in early life leads to a pathological cascade within 
septohippocampal and cortical brain circuits. We propose investigation to 
understand how early-life microbiota changes may lead to hallmark AD pathology 
in established AD/ADRD models. Specifically, we hypothesize that antibiotic 
exposure in early life leads to exacerbated AD-like disease endophenotypes that 
may be amenable to specific microbiological interventions. We propose suitable 
models for testing these hypotheses.

Amyloidosis of amyloid-β (Aβ) triggers a cascade of events, leading to oxidative 
damage and neuronal death. Therefore, inhibiting Aβ amyloidosis or disrupting 
the matured fibrils is the primary target to combat progressive Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) pathogenesis. Here, we undertake optimization strategies to improve 
the antiamyloid efficiency of our previously reported NF11 (NAVRWSLMRPF) 
peptide. Among the series of peptides tested, nontoxic and serum-stable peptide 
1 or P1 containing an anthranilic acid residue shows immense potential in not 
only inhibiting the Aβ42 amyloid formation but also disrupting the mature Aβ42 
fibrils into nontoxic small molecular weight soluble species. Our studies 
provide high-resolution characterization of the peptide's mechanism of action. 
With a binding affinity within the micromolar range for both the monomer and 
aggregated Aβ42, this α/β hybrid peptide can efficiently modulate Aβ amyloidosis 
while facilitating the clearance of toxic aggregates and enforcing protection 
from apoptosis. Thus, our studies highlight that incorporating a β-amino acid 
not only imparts protection from proteolytic degradation and improved stability 
but also functions effectively as a β breaker, redirecting the aggregation 
kinetics toward off-pathway fibrillation.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) presents a significant challenge to global health. It 
is characterized by progressive cognitive deterioration and increased rates of 
morbidity and mortality among older adults. Among the various pathophysiologies 
of AD, mitochondrial dysfunction, encompassing conditions such as increased 
reactive oxygen production, dysregulated calcium homeostasis, and impaired 
mitochondrial dynamics, plays a pivotal role. This review comprehensively 
investigates the mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction in AD, focusing on 
aspects such as glucose metabolism impairment, mitochondrial bioenergetics, 
calcium signaling, protein tau and amyloid-beta-associated synapse dysfunction, 
mitophagy, aging, inflammation, mitochondrial DNA, mitochondria-localized 
microRNAs, genetics, hormones, and the electron transport chain and Krebs cycle. 
While lecanemab is the only FDA-approved medication to treat AD, we explore 
various therapeutic modalities for mitigating mitochondrial dysfunction in AD, 
including antioxidant drugs, antidiabetic agents, acetylcholinesterase 
inhibitors (FDA-approved to manage symptoms), nutritional supplements, natural 
products, phenylpropanoids, vaccines, exercise, and other potential treatments.

Various nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems for the treatment of 
neurological disorders have been widely studied. However, their inability to 
cross the blood-brain barrier hampers the clinical translation of these 
therapeutic strategies. Liposomes are nanoparticles composed of lipid bilayers, 
which can effectively encapsulate drugs and improve drug delivery across the 
blood-brain barrier and into brain tissue through their targeting and 
permeability. Therefore, they can potentially treat traumatic and nontraumatic 
central nervous system diseases. In this review, we outlined the common 
properties and preparation methods of liposomes, including thin-film hydration, 
reverse-phase evaporation, solvent injection techniques, detergent removal 
methods, and microfluidics techniques. Afterwards, we comprehensively discussed 
the current applications of liposomes in central nervous system diseases, such 
as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, and brain tumors. 
Most studies related to liposomes are still in the laboratory stage and have not 
yet entered clinical trials. Additionally, their application as drug delivery 
systems in clinical practice faces challenges such as drug stability, targeting 
efficiency, and safety. Therefore, we proposed development strategies related to 
liposomes to further promote their development in neurological disease research.

INTRODUCTION: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) segmentation algorithms make it 
possible to study detailed medial temporal lobe (MTL) substructures as 
hippocampal subfields and amygdala subnuclei, offering opportunities to develop 
biomarkers for preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: We identified the MTL substructures significantly associated with 
tau-positron emission tomography (PET) signal in 581 non-demented individuals 
from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-3). We confirmed our 
results in our UCLouvain cohort including 110 non-demented individuals by 
comparing volumes between individuals with different visual Braak's stages and 
clinical diagnosis.
RESULTS: Four amygdala subnuclei (cortical, central, medial, and accessory 
basal) were associated with tau in amyloid beta-positive (Aβ+) clinically normal 
(CN) individuals, while the global amygdala and hippocampal volumes were not. 
Using UCLouvain data, we observed that both Braak I-II and Aβ+ CN individuals 
had smaller volumes in these subnuclei, while no significant difference was 
observed in the global structure volumes or other subfields.
CONCLUSION: Measuring specific amygdala subnuclei, early atrophy may serve as a 
marker of temporal tauopathy in preclinical AD, identifying individuals at risk 
of progression.
HIGHLIGHTS: Amygdala atrophy is not homogeneous in preclinical Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). Tau pathology is associated with atrophy of specific amygdala 
subnuclei, specifically, the central, medial, cortical, and accessory basal 
subnuclei. Hippocampal and amygdala volume is not associated with tau in 
preclinical AD. Hippocampus and CA1-3 volume is reduced in preclinical AD, 
regardless of tau.

OBJECTIVES: The proportion of older transplant recipients has increased. 
Cognitive impairment is not rare after kidney transplant, but data on this issue 
in liver transplant recipients are scarse.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we evaluated all liver 
transplant recipients from a single center in Brazil from July 2018 to June 2020 
in terms of cognitive performance to determine the prevalence of neurocognitive 
disorder. We compared liver transplant recipients with neurocognitive disorder 
with liver transplant recipients without neurocognitive disorder. We also 
compared those with an alcoholic cause of liver transplant with other patients. 
The presence of depressive symptoms was assessed. We performed correlations of 
clinical data with cognitive scores.
RESULTS: In a sample of 100 recipients with median age of 62 years 
(interquartile range, 56.2-69 y), neurocognitive disorder was present in 21% of 
the group. Patients with cognitive impairment were older (68 y [61-72] vs 61 y 
[52-68]; P = .019) and had a trend to higher proportion of persistent kidney 
injury (33.3% vs 13.9%; P = .055) versus patients without cognitive impairment. 
Recipients with alcoholic cause of liver transplant exhibited worse cognitive 
performance in the Mini-Mental State Examination (score of 26 [23.7-28.2] vs 28 
[26-29]; P = .024) and the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive (score 
of 10.4 [8.6-14.2] vs 8 [6.3-10]; P = .008) than other patients. Weak negative 
correlations were shown in cognitive performance scores versus recipient age 
(Semantic Verbal Fluency test, r = -0.334 [P = .001]; Clock Drawing test, r = 
-0.209 [P = .037]; Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive, r = -0.323 [P = 
.001]).
CONCLUSIONS: Neurocognitive disorder was common in liver transplant recipients, 
in part due to increased age. This study also suggested a role for alcoholic 
cause of liver transplant and persistent kidney injury in the development of 
cognitive impairment.

BACKGROUND: Blood-based biomarkers offer a promising, less invasive, and more 
cost-effective alternative for Alzheimer's disease screening compared to 
cerebrospinal fluid or imaging biomarkers. However, they have been extensively 
studied only in memory clinic-based cohorts. We aimed to validate them in a more 
heterogeneous, older patient population from primary care.
METHODS: We measured plasma Aβ42/Aβ40, P-tau181, NfL, and GFAP in 1007 
individuals without dementia, aged 79-94 years, from the longitudinal, primary 
care-based German AgeCoDe study. We assessed the association with cognitive 
decline, disease progression, and the capacity to predict future dementia of the 
Alzheimer's type (DAT). We also evaluated biomarker dynamics in 305 individuals 
with a follow-up sample (∼8 years later).
FINDINGS: Higher levels of P-tau181 (HR = 1.32 [95% CI: 1.17-1.51]), NfL 
(HR = 1.19 [95% CI: 1.03-1.36]), and GFAP (HR = 1.36 [95% CI: 1.22-1.52]), and a 
lower Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio (HR = 0.80 [95% CI: 0.68-0.95]) were associated with an 
increased risk of progressing to clinically-diagnosed DAT. Additionally, higher 
levels of P-tau181 (β = -0.49 [95% CI: -0.71 to 0.26]), NfL (β = -0.29 [95% 
CI: -0.52 to 0.06]), and GFAP (β = -0.60 [95% CI: -0.83 to 0.38]) were linked to 
faster cognitive decline. A two-step DAT prediction strategy combining initial 
MMSE with biomarkers improved the identification of individuals in the prodromal 
stage for potential treatment eligibility. Biomarker levels changed over time, 
with increases in P-tau181 (β = 0.19 [95% CI: 0.14-0.25]), NfL (β = 2.88 [95% 
CI: 2.18-3.59]), and GFAP (β = 8.23 [95% CI: 6.71-9.75]). NfL (β = 2.47 [95% CI: 
1.04-3.89]) and GFAP (β = 4.45 [95% CI: 1.38-7.51]) exhibited a faster increase 
in individuals progressing to DAT.
INTERPRETATION: Evaluating plasma biomarkers, alongside brief cognitive 
assessments, might enhance the precision of risk assessment for DAT progression 
in primary care.

Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disease induced by multiple 
interconnected mechanisms. Peptide drug candidates with multi-modal efficacy 
generated from fusion strategy are suitable for addressing multi-facet 
pathology. However, clinical translation of peptide drugs is greatly hampered by 
their low permeability into brain. Herein, a hybrid peptide HNSS is generated by 
merging two therapeutic peptides (SS31 and S-14 G Humanin (HNG)), using a 
different approach from the classical shuttle-therapeutic peptide conjugate 
design. HNSS demonstrated increased bio-permeability, with a 2-fold improvement 
in brain distribution over HNG, thanks to its structure mimicking the design of 
signal peptide-derived cell-penetrating peptides. HNSS efficiently alleviated 
mitochondrial dysfunction through the combined effects of mitochondrial 
targeting, ROS scavenging and p-STAT3 activation. Meanwhile, HNSS with increased 
Aβ affinity greatly inhibited Aβ oligomerization/fibrillation, and interrupted 
Aβ interaction with neuron/microglia by reducing neuronal mitochondrial Aβ 
deposition and promoting microglial phagocytosis of Aβ. In 3× Tg-AD transgenic 
mice, HNSS treatment efficiently inhibited brain neuron loss and improved the 
cognitive performance. This work validates the rational fusion design-based 
strategy for bio-permeability improvement and efficacy amplification, providing 
a paradigm for developing therapeutic peptide candidates against 
neurodegenerative disease.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have gained attention as a promising therapeutic 
approach in both preclinical and clinical osteoarthritis (OA) settings. Various 
joint cell types, such as chondrocytes, synovial fibroblasts, osteoblasts, and 
tenocytes, can produce and release extracellular vesicles (EVs), which 
subsequently influence the biological activities of recipient cells. Recently, 
extracellular vesicles derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSC-EVs) have shown 
the potential to modulate various physiological and pathological processes 
through the modulation of cellular differentiation, immune responses, and tissue 
repair. This review explores the roles and therapeutic potential of MSC-EVs in 
OA and rheumatoid arthritis, cardiovascular disease, age-related macular 
degeneration, Alzheimer's disease, and other degenerative diseases. Notably, we 
provide a comprehensive summary of exosome biogenesis, microRNA composition, 
mechanisms of intercellular transfer, and their evolving role in the highlight 
of exosome-based treatments in both preclinical and clinical avenues.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the mechanism of Tu Fu Ling in 
treating Alzheimer's disease (AD) using network pharmacology and molecular 
docking.
METHODS: The TCMSP and Swiss target prediction databases were utilized to 
confirm the active components of Tu Fu Ling and their corresponding targets, 
with target gene names converted using the UniProt database. Genes related to AD 
were collected from DisGeNET, GeneCards, and the Open Target Platform databases. 
Common target genes between the disease and the drug were obtained using Venny 
2.1 tools and visualized using Cytoscape software. Protein-protein interaction 
(PPI) data were further analyzed to determine correlations between common target 
genes, and GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses were performed for 
intersecting genes. Finally, PYmol, AutoDock Tool, Discovery Studio 2020, and 
PyRx software were used for preliminary computer virtual verification and 
visualization of active drug ingredients and target proteins.
RESULTS: Nine active ingredients meeting the screening criteria yielded a total 
of 168 genes after removing duplicates. A total of 3833 target genes were 
collected, with 129 overlapping target genes identified. GO enrichment analysis 
identified 643 biological processes, 82 cellular components, and 147 molecular 
functions. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis also revealed a pathway closely 
related to AD (hsa05010: Alzheimer's disease). In molecular docking analysis, 
the binding affinity between the 9 active ingredients and 10 core targets ranged 
from -3.5 to -12.3 kcal/mol, indicating strong binding.
CONCLUSION: This study preliminarily verified the combination of Tu Fu Ling's 
screened active ingredient and the calculated core target, suggesting a 
potential mechanism of action to improve the symptoms of AD patients through 
multi-target and multi-pathway approaches. This provides a valuable reference 
for further exploration of the pharmacological mechanism of AD and the 
formulation of drug therapy.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common global dementia and is universally 
fatal. Most late-stage AD disease-modifying therapies are intravenous and target 
amyloid beta (Aβ), with only modest effects on disease progression: there 
remains a high unmet need for convenient, safe, and effective therapeutics. 
Senescent cells (SC) and the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) 
drive AD pathology and increase with AD severity. Preclinical senolytic studies 
have shown improvements in neuroinflammation, tau, Aβ, and CNS damage; most were 
conducted in transgenic rodent models with uncertain human translational 
relevance. In this study, aged cynomolgus monkeys had significant elevation of 
biomarkers of senescence, SASP, and neurological damage. Intermittent treatment 
with the senolytic navitoclax induced modest reversible thrombocytopenia; no 
serious drug-related toxicity was noted. Navitoclax reduced several senescence 
and SASP biomarkers, with CSF concentrations sufficient for senolysis. Finally, 
navitoclax reduced TSPO-PET frontal cortex binding and showed trends of 
improvement in CSF biomarkers of neuroinflammation, neuronal damage, and 
synaptic dysfunction. Overall, navitoclax administration was safe and well 
tolerated in aged monkeys, inducing trends of biomarker changes relevant to 
human neurodegenerative disease.

Ferroptosis, a form of cell death characterized by lipid peroxidation, is 
involved in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer´s disease (AD). Recent 
studies have shown that a first-line antimalarial drug artemisinin is effective 
to counteract AD pathology. In this study, we investigated the protective effect 
of artemisinin against neuronal ferroptosis and the underlying mechanisms. In 
hippocampal HT22 cells, pretreatment with artemisinin dose-dependently protected 
against Erastin-induced cell death with an EC50 value of 5.032 µM, comparable to 
the ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1 (EC50 = 4.39 µM). We demonstrated that 
artemisinin (10 μM) significantly increased the nuclear translocation of Nrf2 
and upregulated SLC7A11 and GPX4 in HT22 cells. Knockdown of Nrf2, SLC7A11 or 
GPX4 prevented the protective action of artemisinin, indicating that its 
anti-ferroptosis effect is mediated by the Nrf2-SLC7A11-GPX4 pathway. Molecular 
docking and Co-Immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) analysis revealed that artemisinin 
competitively binds with KEAP1, promoting the dissociation of KEAP1-Nrf2 complex 
and inhibiting the ubiquitination of Nrf2. Intrahippocampal injection of 
imidazole-ketone-Erastin (IKE) induced ferroptosis in mice accompanied by 
cognitive deficits evidenced by lower preference for exploration of new objects 
and new object locations in the NOR and NOL tests. Artemisinin (5, 10 mg/kg, 
i.p.) dose-dependently inhibited IKE-induced ferroptosis in hippocampal CA1 
region and ameliorated learning and memory impairments. Moreover, we 
demonstrated that artemisinin reversed Aβ1-42-induced ferroptosis, lipid 
peroxidation and glutathione depletion in HT22 cells, primary hippocampal 
neurons, and 3×Tg mice via the KEAP1-Nrf2 pathway. Our results demonstrate that 
artemisinin is a novel neuronal ferroptosis inhibitor that targets KEAP1 to 
activate the Nrf2-SLC7A11-GPX4 pathway.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, characterized by 
memory loss, cognitive decline, personality changes, and various neurological 
symptoms. The role of blood-brain barrier (BBB) injury, extracellular matrix 
(ECM) abnormalities, and oligodendrocytes (ODCs) dysfunction in AD has gained 
increasing attention, yet the detailed pathogenesis remains elusive. This study 
integrates single-cell sequencing of AD patients' cerebrovascular system with a 
genome-wide association analysis. It aims to elucidate the associations and 
potential mechanisms behind pericytes injury, ECM disorder, and ODCs dysfunction 
in AD pathogenesis. Finally, we identified that abnormalities in the pericyte 
PI3K-AKT-FOXO signaling pathway may be involved in the pathogenic process of AD. 
This comprehensive approach sheds new light on the complex etiology of AD and 
opens avenues for advanced research into its pathogenesis and therapeutic 
strategies.

Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), a rare Parkinsonian disorder, is 
characterized by problems with movement, balance, and cognition. PSP differs 
from Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other diseases, displaying abnormal 
microtubule-associated protein tau by both neuronal and glial cell pathologies. 
Genetic contributors may mediate these differences; however, the genetics of PSP 
remain underexplored. Here we conduct the largest genome-wide association study 
(GWAS) of PSP which includes 2779 cases (2595 neuropathologically-confirmed) and 
5584 controls and identify six independent PSP susceptibility loci with 
genome-wide significant (P < 5 × 10-8) associations, including five known (MAPT, 
MOBP, STX6, RUNX2, SLCO1A2) and one novel locus (C4A). Integration with cell 
type-specific epigenomic annotations reveal an oligodendrocytic signature that 
might distinguish PSP from AD and Parkinson's disease in subsequent studies. 
Candidate PSP risk gene prioritization using expression quantitative trait loci 
(eQTLs) identifies oligodendrocyte-specific effects on gene expression in half 
of the genome-wide significant loci, and an association with C4A expression in 
brain tissue, which may be driven by increased C4A copy number. Finally, 
histological studies demonstrate tau aggregates in oligodendrocytes that 
colocalize with C4 (complement) deposition. Integrating GWAS with functional 
studies, epigenomic and eQTL analyses, we identify potential causal roles for 
variation in MOBP, STX6, RUNX2, SLCO1A2, and C4A in PSP pathogenesis.

biological processes that have been separately shown to be affected in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we aimed to identify biomarker signatures 
reflecting these pathways in 108 memory clinic patients with subjective 
cognitive decline (SCD, N = 40), mild cognitive impairment (MCI, N = 39), and AD 
(N = 29). Participants were from the well-characterized Cortisol and Stress in 
Alzheimer's Disease (Co-STAR) cohort, recruited at Karolinska University 
Hospital. Salivary diurnal cortisol measures and 41 CSF proteins were analyzed. 
Principal component analysis was applied to identify combined biosignatures 
related to AD pathology, synaptic loss, and neuropsychological assessments, in 
linear regressions adjusted for confounders, such as age, sex, education and 
diagnosis. We found increased CSF levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), interferon 
γ-inducible protein (IP-10), thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC), 
intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and vascular cell adhesion 
molecule-1 (VCAM-1) in MCI patients. Further, markers of cortisol dysregulation 
(flattened salivary cortisol awakening response and flattened cortisol slope) 
correlated with increased levels of placental growth factor (PlGF), IP-10, and 
chitinase 3-like 1 (YKL-40) in the total cohort. A biosignature composed of 
cortisol awakening response, cortisol slope, and CSF IL-6 was downregulated in 
AD patients. Moreover, biomarker signatures reflecting overlapping 
pathophysiological processes of neuroinflammation and vascular injury were 
associated with AD pathology, synaptic loss, and worsened processing speed. Our 
findings suggest an early dysregulation of immune and cerebrovascular processes 
during the MCI stage and provide insights into the interrelationship of chronic 
stress and neuroinflammation in AD.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is an idiopathic neurodegenerative disorder with the 
second-highest prevalence rate behind Alzheimer's disease. The 
pathophysiological hallmarks of PD are both degeneration of dopaminergic neurons 
in the substantia nigra pars compacta and the inclusion of misfolded α-synuclein 
(α-syn) aggregates known as Lewy bodies. Despite decades of research for 
potential PD treatments, none have been developed, and developing new 
therapeutic agents is a time-consuming and expensive process. Computational 
methods can be used to investigate the properties of drug candidates currently 
undergoing clinical trials to determine their theoretical efficiency at 
targeting α-syn. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are biological drugs with high 
specificity, and Prasinezumab (PRX002) is an mAb currently in Phase II, which 
targets the C-terminus (AA 118-126) of α-syn. We utilized BioLuminate and PyMol 
for the structure prediction and preparation of the fragment antigen-binding 
(Fab) region of PRX002 and 34 different conformations of α-syn. Protein-protein 
docking simulations were performed using PIPER, and 3 of the docking poses were 
selected based on the best fit. Molecular dynamics simulations were conducted on 
the docked protein structures in triplicate for 1000 ns, and hydrogen bonds and 
electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions were analyzed using MDAnalysis to 
determine which residues were interacting and how often. Hydrogen bonds were 
shown to form frequently between the HCDR2 region of PRX002 and α-syn. Free 
energy was calculated to determine the binding affinity. The predicted binding 
affinity shows a strong antibody-antigen attraction between PRX002 and α-syn. 
RMSD was calculated to determine the conformational change of these regions 
throughout the simulation. The mAb's developability was determined using 
computational screening methods. Our results demonstrate the efficiency and 
developability of this therapeutic agent.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Integrated PET/MR allows the simultaneous acquisition of 
PET biomarkers and structural and functional MRI to study Alzheimer disease 
(AD). Attenuation correction (AC), crucial for PET quantification, can be 
performed by using a deep learning approach, DL-Dixon, based on standard Dixon 
images. Longitudinal amyloid PET imaging, which provides important information 
about disease progression or treatment responses in AD, is usually acquired over 
several years. Hardware and software upgrades often occur during a multiple-year 
study period, resulting in data variability. This study aims to harmonize PET/MR 
DL-Dixon AC amid software and head coil updates and evaluate its accuracy and 
longitudinal consistency.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tri-modality PET/MR and CT images were obtained from 329 
participants, with a subset of 38 undergoing tri-modality scans twice within 
approximately 3 years. Transfer learning was used to fine-tune DL-Dixon models 
on images from 2 scanner software versions (VB20P and VE11P) and 2 head coils 
(16-channel and 32-channel coils). The accuracy and longitudinal consistency of 
the DL-Dixon AC were evaluated. Power analyses were performed to estimate the 
sample size needed to detect various levels of longitudinal changes in the PET 
standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR).
RESULTS: The DL-Dixon method demonstrated high accuracy across all data, 
irrespective of scanner software versions and head coils. More than 95.6% of 
brain voxels showed less than 10% PET relative absolute error in all 
participants. The median [interquartile range] PET mean relative absolute error 
was 1.10% [0.93%, 1.26%], 1.24% [1.03%, 1.54%], 0.99% [0.86%, 1.13%] in the 
cortical summary region, and 1.04% [0.83%, 1.36%], 1.08% [0.84%, 1.34%], 1.05% 
[0.72%, 1.32%] in cerebellum by using the DL-Dixon models for the VB20P 
16-channel coil, VE11P 16-channel coil, and VE11P 32-channel coil data, 
respectively. The within-subject coefficient of variation and intraclass 
correlation coefficient of PET SUVR in the cortical regions were comparable 
between the DL-Dixon and CT AC. Power analysis indicated that similar numbers of 
participants would be needed to detect the same level of PET changes by using 
DL-Dixon and CT AC.
CONCLUSIONS: DL-Dixon exhibited excellent accuracy and longitudinal consistency 
across the 2 software versions and head coils, demonstrating its robustness for 
longitudinal PET/MR neuroimaging studies in AD.

Neurodegenerative diseases represent the most common cause of dementia. Protein 
aggregation is upstream in the pathological mechanisms and is a therapeutic 
target in the development of disease-modifying drugs in this patient population. 
Notably, α-synuclein or DNA-binding protein of 43kDa (TDP-43) is commonly 
involved in the pathomechanisms that contribute to non-Alzheimer 
neurodegenerative diseases. Several immunotherapy clinical trials on α-synuclein 
have progressed to phase 2, and small-molecule therapeutics are ongoing. With 
regard to TDP-43, immunotherapies that target protein aggregates are currently 
being developed, and research is underway to investigate several drugs that 
target the associated causative gene. Further research is warranted for deeper 
insight into both disease-modifying drugs; biomarker tests need to be developed 
to determine their efficacy. However, both proteins aggregate and accumulate in 
the brain in many neurodegenerative diseases and dementia; therefore, they are 
therapeutically significant, and future progress is expected in research and 
development.

The molecular pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been elucidated 
through the biochemical analysis of senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and 
pathological features of the brains of patients with AD. Genetic analysis, 
initiated with familial AD investigation, has revealed that Aβ aggregation and 
accumulation are crucial processes in AD pathogenesis. The success of lecanemab 
against aggregated Aβ is the result of these efforts. Meanwhile, research on tau 
as a causative molecule in AD and various other tauopathies is advancing 
gradually. Furthermore, genetic analysis has revealed that the inflammatory 
response of glial cells modifies AD pathophysiology; a novel therapeutic 
strategy for inflammation control is thus currently under consideration. This 
article summarizes the latest discoveries related to these new therapeutic 
strategies for AD.

Conventionally, APOE genetic testing has not been recommended as a component of 
the standard diagnostic and management practices for Alzheimer's disease. 
However, recent research highlights the importance of this test, particularly 
for assessment of the safety profile of anti-amyloid-β therapies. Therefore, the 
current United States guidelines for the administration of lecanemab explicitly 
advise APOE genetic testing. However, integration of this testing into clinical 
practice is associated with many clinical, ethical, legal, and economic 
challenges. It is important to initiate comprehensive discussions to address 
these multifaceted issues in Japan.

Amyloid PET plays a crucial role in the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease 
and the determination of the feasibility of disease-modifying therapies. It 
offers several advantages, including high sensitivity and specificity, minimal 
invasiveness, and the ability to provide spatial evaluation, all of which 
contribute to the optimization of dementia care. However, proper use and 
interpretation of the results require a thorough understanding of their 
limitations. Although careful consideration is necessary when using scans on 
asymptomatic individuals, clinical applications could broaden if preemptive 
treatments and high-precision individual risk assessments for the preclinical 
stage are developed.

Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) represent the most frequent adverse 
effect of lecanemab, a monoclonal antibody drug that targets amyloid beta. ARIA 
is observed in approximately 20% of patients who receive lecanemab. Most 
patients are asymptomatic; however, some develop serious neurological symptoms, 
and optimal management remains clinically challenging in such cases. In this 
review, I summarize the pathomechanism underlying ARIA and associated disorders, 
in addition to countermeasures for ARIA.

The launch of lecanemab (an anti-Aβ antibody) has introduced a new treatment for 
Alzheimer's disease. In contrast to conventional therapeutic approaches to 
dementia, this drug requires new concepts in diagnosis, evaluation, and adverse 
effects. Specifically, evaluation of the efficacy of lecanemab is extremely 
important because this drug does not prevent but only slows the rate of disease 
progression. In this report, I have discussed future issues, including my 
personal viewpoint and also described the guidelines for promotion of the 
optimal use of lecanemab issued by the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common dementia disorder in the elderly 
individuals, accounting for approximately 60-70% of all dementia cases. 
Recently, significant progress has been made in developing and approving 
anti-amyloid antibody drugs as one of the disease-modifying therapies (DMT) that 
aim to slow the progression of AD by targeting amyloid-beta accumulation in the 
brain. Notable drugs such as aducanumab, lecanemab, and donanemab have shown 
potential in clinical trials, leading to the approval of aducanumab and 
lecanemab, and approval is also expected for donanemab. Other anti-amyloid drugs 
such as remternetug and trontinemab are also under development. However, 
challenges remain, including adverse effects like amyloid-related imaging 
abnormalities (ARIA) and the need for addressing healthcare preparedness to 
support their use. This paper outlines the current status of DMT for AD, 
including the clinical trial results and current applications of these drugs. It 
also discusses the existing challenges to improve the safety and accessibility 
of DMTs.

Apolipoprotein E (apoE) has a pivotal role in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) 
pathophysiology. APOE4 has been recognized as a risk factor for developing 
late-onset AD. Recently, APOE4 homozygosity was regarded as a new familial 
genetic trait of AD. In this opinion paper, we summarized the potential 
pleiotropic antagonism role of APOE4 in children living under early life 
adversity and afflicted with enteric infection/malnutrition-related pathogenic 
exposome. APOE4 was found to be neuroprotective early in life despite its 
increasing risk for AD with aging. We call for awareness of the potential burden 
this can bring to the public health system when APOE4 carriers, raised under 
adverse environmental conditions in early life and then aging with unhealthy 
lifestyles in later life may be at special risk for cognitive impairments and 
acquired AD. We postulate the importance of anti-senescence therapies to protect 
these individuals and remediate aging-related chronic illnesses.

Aggregation and deposition of amyloid beta-protein 1-42 (Aβ42) in the brain, 
primarily owing to hydrophobic interactions between Aβ42 chains, is a common 
pathology in all forms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Hydrophilic oligosaccharides 
are widely present in the extracellular matrix and on the cytoplasmic membrane. 
To determine if oligosaccharides bind to Aβ42 or its aggregates and consequently 
affect their aggregation and cellular function, this study examined the 
interaction of typical functional oligosaccharides with Aβ42 or its aggregates. 
Isomaltooligosaccharides (IMOs), particularly isomaltotriose, panose, and 
isomaltotetraose, functioned as molecular chaperones for Aβ42 by binding 
directly to Aβ42, preserving Aβ42's active conformation and cytotrophic 
activity. Oral IMOs reduced total plasma Aβ level and indirectly caused a slight 
reduction in the load of Aβ42 spots/plaques in the brain of AD model mice 
(male). Another branched oligosaccharide, bianntennary core pentasaccharide 
(BCP), had a relatively high binding specificity for Aβ42 oligomers (Aβ42O) and 
acted as an antagonistic binding partner for Aβ42O. Free BCP effectively 
blocked/prevented further assembly of Aβ42O and their toxicity to neural and 
vascular endothelial cell lines. Since BCP is also a signaling component of 
membrane targets (glycolipids, glycoproteins or receptors), it seemed that BCP 
had two opposing effects on the binding of Aβ42O to target cells. This study's 
findings suggest that these branched oligosaccharides may be potential 
candidates for blocking or preventing Aβ42 aggregation and Aβ42O 
cytotoxicity/neurotoxicity, respectively, and that IMO-like or free BCP-like 
oligosaccharide deficiencies in the brain may be one of the underlying 
mechanisms for Aβ42 aggregation and Aβ42O cytotoxicity.

Recent advances in understanding Alzheimer's disease (AD) suggest the 
possibility of an infectious etiology, with Porphyromonas gingivalis emerging as 
a prime suspect in contributing to AD. P. gingivalis may invade systemic 
circulation via weakened oral/intestinal barriers and then cross the blood-brain 
barrier (BBB), reaching the brain and precipitating AD pathology. Based on the 
proposed links between P. gingivalis and AD, a prospective approach is the 
development of an oral nanovaccine containing P. gingivalis antigens for mucosal 
delivery. Targeting the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), the nanovaccine 
may elicit both mucosal and systemic immunity, thereby hampering P. gingivalis 
ability to breach the oral/intestinal barriers and the BBB, respectively. The 
present study describes the optimization, characterization, and in vitro 
evaluation of a candidate chitosan-coated poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) 
(PLGA-CS) nanovaccine containing a P. gingivalis antigen extract. The 
nanocarrier was prepared using the double emulsion solvent evaporation method 
and optimized for selected experimental factors, e.g. PLGA amount, surfactant 
concentration, w1/o phase ratio, applying a d-optimal statistical design to 
target the desired physicochemical criteria for its intended application. After 
nanocarrier optimization, the nanovaccine was characterized in terms of particle 
size, polydispersity index (PdI), ζ-potential, encapsulation efficiency (EE), 
drug loading (DL), morphology, and in vitro release profile, as well as for 
mucoadhesivity, stability under simulated gastrointestinal conditions, antigen 
integrity, in vitro cytotoxicity and uptake using THP-1 macrophages. The 
candidate PLGA-CS nanovaccine demonstrated appropriate physicochemical, 
mucoadhesive, and antigen release properties for oral delivery, along with 
acceptable levels of EE (55.3 ± 3.5 %) and DL (1.84 ± 0.12 %). The integrity of 
the encapsulated antigens remained uncompromised throughout NPs production and 
simulated gastrointestinal exposure, as confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western 
blotting analyses. Furthermore, the nanovaccine showed effective in vitro 
uptake, while exhibiting low cytotoxicity. Taken together, these findings 
underscore the potential of PLGA-CS NPs as carriers for adequate antigen mucosal 
delivery, paving the way for further investigations into their applicability as 
vaccine candidates against P. gingivalis.

About 20% of people in the general population have an impairment of the sense of 
smell. Impaired olfaction leads to diminished quality of life. This can be 
dangerous, as environmental hazards such as the smell of natural gas or smoke 
may not be appreciated; the sense of taste is intimately connected with the 
sense of smell, and diminished taste can also result in missed indications of 
danger, such as spoiled or contaminated food. Furthermore, impaired olfaction 
may be a warning sign for common neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer 
dementia and Parkinson disease. The most common causes of olfactory decline are 
sinonasal disease, viral infection, and nasofacial trauma. If there is a clear 
structural pathology in the nose or brain, treatment may be oriented toward the 
underlying lesion, such as functional endoscopic nasal surgery for chronic 
rhinosinusitis with polyposis or neurosurgical interventions for an anterior 
skull base tumor. In patients with damage to the olfactory epithelium and 
olfactory pathways due to inflammation, toxins, trauma, viral infection, or 
unknown causes, olfactory therapy may be appropriate. Medications such as 
corticosteroids for chronic rhinosinusitis and other inflammatory conditions may 
provide some relief from olfactory decline. Other options include sodium 
citrate, zinc, and vitamins, but their efficacy has not been definitively proven 
to date. A non-surgical and non-pharmacological approach to improve olfactory 
function is olfactory training, wherein patients expose themselves twice daily 
to different odors over the course of several months.  Several studies 
have described the efficacy of olfactory training. In many cases, however, the 
studies' findings are questionable due to the absence of appropriate control 
groups or the lack of a double-blinded experimental design. Moreover, some 
patients with olfactory dysfunction recover spontaneously. Up to 20% of patients 
with post-traumatic olfactory dysfunction and up to 60% of patients with 
post-infectious olfactory dysfunction demonstrate spontaneous resolution of 
symptoms.  Additionally, younger patients, patients with relatively 
well-preserved olfactory function, women, and non-smokers have a good chance of 
a spontaneous improvement of olfactory functioning. For patients who smoke, 
tobacco use should be discouraged because it is associated with diminished 
olfactory functioning, and continued use may thwart any attempt to improve the 
sense of smell. Olfactory training is comparatively simple, and so far, serious 
side effects have not been reported. Although its precise mechanism of action 
and efficacy are incompletely understood, olfactory training is increasingly 
applied in routine care for patients with olfactory dysfunction of varying 
etiologies.

Caring for Persons with Alzheimer's Disease during a Pandemic: An Integrative 
Literature Review.

Kokoszka L, Pariseault C, Pariseault CA, Hunter D.

The population experiencing Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their caregivers have 
been tremendously impacted by the global COVID-19 pandemic. Outpatient services 
became less accessible during the pandemic lockdown which caused increased 
caregiver burden more than usual. Further examination discovered that caregivers 
were unable to properly take care of themselves because of the need to provide 
around-the-clock care to loved ones, who pre-pandemic were able to receive 
supplemental caregiving services. The purpose of this integrative review was to 
provide a synthesis of information regarding caregiver experiences, during a 
time of limited resources, such as with the COVID-19 global pandemic. A 
comprehensive search of the literature databases Cumulative Index to Nursing and 
Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and Medline was completed yielding qualitative 
and mixed-methods studies. The literature search yielded 14 articles which met 
the criteria. Three themes emerged during this review. They include: Deprivation 
of self-care and social connectedness, Fragmented care and resources, and 
Improved policy development. Multiple gaps in caregiver needs have been 
identified throughout the literature. Outpatient services, home health aides, 
and respite care remain necessary elements of care for those with AD and for the 
relief of the caregiver. Forward planning should include government policies to 
support caregiving of those with AD, especially in the light of service 
restrictions or unavailable services.

INTRODUCTION: The prognostic role of plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL), 
phospho-tau, beta-amyloid, and GFAP is still debated in Parkinson's disease 
(PD).
METHODS: Plasma p-tau181, p-tau231, Aβ1-40, Aβ1-42, GFAP, and NfL were measured 
by SIMOA in 136 PD with 2.9 + 1.7 years of follow-up and 76 controls. 
Differences in plasma levels between controls and PD and their correlation with 
clinical severity and progression rates were evaluated using linear regression 
analyses.
RESULTS: Patients exhibited similar distribution of plasma biomarkers but higher 
P-tau181, P-tau231 and lower Aβ1-42 compared with controls. NfL and GFAP 
correlated with baseline motor and non-motor severity measures. At follow-up, 
NfL emerged as the best predictor of progression with marginal effect of GFAP 
and p-tau181 adjusting for age, sex, disease duration, and baseline motor 
severity.
CONCLUSION: The present findings confirmed plasma NfL as best predictor of 
progression in PD, with a marginal role of p-tau181 and GFAP.

BACKGROUND: Elevated neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels are associated with 
worse prognosis in Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). Our objectives were to 
determine the utility of serum NfL (sNfL), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/serum NfL 
ratio and NfL index as prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers for GBS.
METHODS: We measured NfL in serum and/or CSF obtained from 96 GBS patients 
between 1989 and 2014 in western Sweden. The sNfL Z-scores, NfL ratios and NfL 
indices were calculated. Outcome was determined with the GBS disability scale 
(GBSDS) at 3 and 12 months. NfL parameters in GBS were compared with healthy 
controls (HC), multiple sclerosis (MS), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
RESULTS: The sNfL Z-score was higher for GBSDS > 2 at 3 months (median [IQR], 
3.5 ng/L [3.2-4.0], vs 2.6 [1.7-3.4], p = 0.008) and at 12 months (3.6 ng/L 
[3.5-3.8] vs 2.6 [1.8-3.5], p = 0.049). NfL ratio and index were not associated 
with outcome. The area under the curve (AUC) for sNfL Z-score was 0.76 (95% CI 
0.58-0.93, p < 0.0001) for GBSDS > 2 at 3 months. NfL ratio and index were lower 
in GBS than HC, MS, and ALS. The AUC for the NfL ratio was 0.66 (95% CI 
0.55-0.78, p = 0.0018) and for the NfL index 0.86 (95% CI 0.78-0.93, 
p < 0.0001).
DISCUSSION: Our results confirm sNfL as prognostic biomarker for GBS and the 
precision was improved using the age-adjusted sNfL Z score. NfL index and Qalb 
are potential diagnostic biomarkers for GBS.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) currently lacks effective disease-modifying 
treatments. Recent research suggests that ferroptosis could be a potential 
therapeutic target. Mendelian randomization (MR) is a widely used method for 
identifying novel therapeutic targets.
OBJECTIVE: Employ genetic information to evaluate the causal impact of 
ferroptosis-related genes on the risk of AD.
METHODS: 564 ferroptosis-related genes were obtained from FerrDb. We derived 
genetic instrumental variables for these genes using four brain quantitative 
trait loci (QTL) and two blood QTL datasets. Summary-data-based Mendelian 
randomization (SMR) and two-sample MR methods were applied to estimate the 
causal effects of ferroptosis-related genes on AD. Using extern transcriptomic 
datasets and triple-transgenic mouse model of AD (3xTg-AD) to further validate 
the gene targets identified by the MR analysis.
RESULTS: We identified 17 potential AD risk gene targets from GTEx, 13 from 
PsychENCODE, and 22 from BrainMeta (SMR p < 0.05 and HEIDI test p > 0.05). Six 
overlapping ferroptosis-related genes associated with AD were identified, which 
could serve as potential therapeutic targets (PEX10, CDC25A, EGFR, DLD, LIG3, 
and TRIB3). Additionally, we further pinpointed risk genes or proteins at the 
blood tissue and pQTL levels. Notably, EGFR demonstrated significant 
dysregulation in the extern transcriptomic datasets and 3xTg-AD models.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides genetic evidence supporting the potential 
therapeutic benefits of targeting the six druggable genes for AD treatment, 
especially for EGFR (validated by transcriptome and 3xTg-AD), which could be 
useful for prioritizing AD drug development in the field of ferroptosis.

Several decades of research on cell and animal models contributed tremendously 
to understanding human diseases. Particularly, research on rodents and non-human 
primates revealed that animal research is a major and important component in 
biomedical research in learning complex pathophysiological processes. Further, 
animal research helped us to understand human diseases, such as Alzheimer's 
disease. In addition, animal research has also helped us to test hundreds of 
drugs and develop treatments for human use. Researchers can gain a better 
understanding of key biological and physiological processes in humans by 
comparing them to laboratory animals. Based on their relevance and resemblance 
to people, or even usual living conditions, scientists rationalize the use of 
particular animal models in their studies. It is suggested that in the National 
Institutes of Health and other agencies-funded research, animal models should be 
carefully selected to study the biology and pathophysiology of human health and 
diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. However, it is 
critical to use a minimum number of animals for human research. Further, it is 
also noted that the use and reuse of behavioral,  molecular, and biochemical 
data from wild-type (WT) control mice with mutant lines of disease models, as 
long as the genetic background is the same in both WT and disease mice. On the 
other hand, anonymous readers have challenged the use and reuse of WT mice data 
for comparison. In the current article, we discuss the minimum utility of 
animals, covering the 3Rs, Replacement, Reduction, and Refinement, and also 
discuss the use and reuse of behavioral, molecular, and biochemical data.

Lysophospholipid receptors in neurodegeneration and neuroprotection.

Birgbauer E(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Biology, Winthrop University, Rock Hill, SC 29733, USA.

The central nervous system (CNS) is one of the most complex physiological 
systems, and treatment of CNS disorders represents an area of major medical 
need. One critical aspect of the CNS is its lack of regeneration, such that 
damage is often permanent. The damage often leads to neurodegeneration, and so 
strategies for neuroprotection could lead to major medical advances. The G 
protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family is one of the major receptor classes, and 
they have been successfully targeted clinically. One class of GPCRs is those 
activated by bioactive lysophospholipids as ligands, especially 
sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). Research has been 
increasingly demonstrating the important roles that S1P and LPA, and their 
receptors, play in physiology and disease. In this review, I describe the role 
of S1P and LPA receptors in neurodegeneration and potential roles in 
neuroprotection. Much of our understanding of the role of S1P receptors has been 
through pharmacological tools. One such tool, fingolimod (also known as FTY720), 
which is a S1P receptor agonist but a functional antagonist in the immune 
system, is clinically efficacious in multiple sclerosis by producing a 
lymphopenia to reduce autoimmune attacks; however, there is evidence that 
fingolimod is also neuroprotective. Furthermore, fingolimod is neuroprotective 
in many other neuropathologies, including stroke, Parkinson's disease, 
Huntington's disease, Rett syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, and others that are 
discussed here. LPA receptors also appear to be involved, being upregulated in a 
variety of neuropathologies. Antagonists or mutations of LPA receptors, 
especially LPA1, are neuroprotective in a variety of conditions, including 
cortical development, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, stroke and 
others discussed here. Finally, LPA receptors may interact with other receptors, 
including a functional interaction with plasticity related genes.

We present a unique case of an 89-year-old male with Alzheimer's disease who 
developed hemorrhagic blisters on his palms, which ruptured with time and were 
followed by pruritic erythematous lesions across his chest, upper back, lower 
abdomen, and thighs. The patient was diagnosed with dyshidrosiform bullous 
pemphigoid (DBP), an uncommon variant of the autoimmune condition bullous 
pemphigoid characterized by cutaneous and mucosal blistering, which commonly 
appears as vesiculobullous eruptions in the palmoplantar areas and may spread to 
other parts of the body. Less than 100 cases of DBP have been documented in the 
medical literature. Since DBP is difficult to identify and treat due to its 
clinical appearance similar to pompholyx, we reviewed the treatment of DBP and 
included clinical images and direct immunofluorescence (DIF) staining technique 
images to better establish the diagnosis.

intervention, or a no-contact condition. Five-year effects were measured on 
immediate and delayed memory recall, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment screening 
test (MoCA), self-reported strategy use, and daily living difficulties.
RESULTS: At follow-up, participants who received cognitive training showed a 
smaller decline in delayed memory and maintained MoCA scores, contrasting with 
greater declines in the control groups. Cognitive training participants 
outperformed controls in both delayed memory and MoCA scores at the 5-year time 
point. No significant group differences were observed in self-reported strategy 
use or difficulties in daily living.
DISCUSSION: Cognitive training provides long-term benefits by mitigating memory 
decline and slowing clinical symptom progression in older adults with MCI.
HIGHLIGHTS: Cognitive training reduced the 5-year memory decline of persons with 
MCI.Cognitive training also reduced decline on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment 
(MoCA).No intervention effect was found on strategy use or activities of daily 
living.

Modifying Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology with photobiomodulation: model, 
evidence, and future with EEG-guided intervention.

This manuscript outlines a model of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathophysiology in 
progressive layers, from its genesis to the development of biomarkers and then 
to symptom expression. Genetic predispositions are the major factor that leads 
to mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent amyloid and tau protein 
accumulation, which have been identified as hallmarks of AD. Extending beyond 
these accumulations, we explore a broader spectrum of pathophysiological 
aspects, including the blood-brain barrier, blood flow, vascular health, 
gut-brain microbiodata, glymphatic flow, metabolic syndrome, energy deficit, 
oxidative stress, calcium overload, inflammation, neuronal and synaptic loss, 
brain matter atrophy, and reduced growth factors. Photobiomodulation (PBM), 
which delivers near-infrared light to selected brain regions using portable 
devices, is introduced as a therapeutic approach. PBM has the potential to 
address each of these pathophysiological aspects, with data provided by various 
studies. They provide mechanistic support for largely small published clinical 
studies that demonstrate improvements in memory and cognition. They inform of 
PBM's potential to treat AD pending validation by large randomized controlled 
studies. The presentation of brain network and waveform changes on 
electroencephalography (EEG) provide the opportunity to use these data as a 
guide for the application of various PBM parameters to improve outcomes. These 
parameters include wavelength, power density, treatment duration, LED 
positioning, and pulse frequency. Pulsing at specific frequencies has been found 
to influence the expression of waveforms and modifications of brain networks. 
The expression stems from the modulation of cellular and protein structures as 
revealed in recent studies. These findings provide an EEG-based guide for the 
use of artificial intelligence to personalize AD treatment through EEG data 
feedback.

The findings concerning the association between endocannabinoid system (ECS) and 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) exhibited inconsistencies when examining the expression 
levels of endocannabinoids. This study aimed to provide a comprehensive summary 
of the studies regarding alterations of the ECS in AD. Six databases were 
thoroughly searched for literature to select relevant studies investigating the 
ECS in AD, including changes in cannabinoid receptors (CB1R and CB2R), 
endocannabinoids (2-AG and AEA), and their associated enzymes (FAAH and MAGL). 
Traditional meta-analysis evaluated the expression levels of the ECS in AD, and 
the results showed no significant differences in ECS components between healthy 
controls and AD patients. However, subgroup analysis revealed significantly 
lower expression levels of CB1R in AD than in controls, particularly in studies 
using western blot (SMD = -0.88, p < 0.01) and in studies testing CB1R of 
frontal cortex (SMD = -1.09, p < 0.01). For studies using HPLC, the subgroup 
analysis indicated significantly higher 2-AG levels in AD than in controls 
(SMD = 0.46, p = 0.02). Network meta-analysis examined the rank of ECS 
alterations in AD compared to controls, and the findings revealed that 2-AG and 
MAGL exhibited the largest increase and CB1R showed the largest decrease 
relative to the control group. Based on the findings of traditional 
meta-analysis and network meta-analysis, we proposed that AD patients may 
present decreased expression levels of CB1R and increased expression levels of 
2-AG and its degrading enzyme MAGL. Our results may contribute to the growing 
body of research supporting the therapeutic potential of ECS modulation in the 
management of AD.

Background: Isoorientin (ISO), a flavone C-glycoside, is a glycogen synthase 
kinase 3β (GSK3β) substrate-competitive inhibitor. ISO has potential in 
treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). An excessive activation of GSK3β can lead 
to neuroinflammation causing neuronal damage. Microglia cells, as resident 
immune cells of the central nervous system, mediate neuroinflammation. Here, we 
studied the effects of ISO on microglial activation to alleviate 
neuroinflammation. Methods: Effects of ISO were observed upon the stimulation of 
mouse microglia BV2 or SIM-A9 cells by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Lithium 
chloride (LiCl) was the positive control as a GSK3β inhibitor. The release of 
TNF-α and NO were analyzed by ELISA and Griess assays, while expressions of 
COX-2, Iba-1, BDNF, GSK3β, NF-κB p65, IκB, Nrf2 and HO-1 were detected by 
Western blotting. In the co-culture model of SIM-A9 cells and differentiated 
SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells, effects of ISO on microglia-mediated neuronal 
damage were evaluated with the MTS assay. Results: ISO significantly inhibited 
the production of TNF-α (p < 0.01), NO (p < 0.001) and the expression of COX-2 
(p < 0.01) and Iba-1 (p < 0.05) induced by LPS, and increased BDNF. The cell 
viability of SH-SY5Y was inhibited by LPS in the co-culture, which was prevented 
by ISO pretreatment. ISO increased the expression of p-GSK3β (Ser9), IκB and 
HO-1 in the cytoplasm, decreased NF-κB p65 and increased Nrf2 in the nucleus 
compared with the LPS group. Conclusion: ISO attenuated the activation of 
microglia through regulating the GSK3β, NF-κB and Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathways 
to exert neuroprotection.

Communication as Healing Art in Caring for Persons with Alzheimer's and 
Dementia.

Hanna KJ, Jared B, Langford M, Rodoli WJ.

Communication is an essential aspect of care for all patients but is especially 
important for individuals with Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia. 
Nurses who care for persons living with dementia (PwD), as well as family 
members and caregivers, need understanding of verbal and nonverbal communication 
techniques and approaches that are effective throughout the stages of dementia. 
Spiritual assessment and care also are critical. This article provides 
evidence-based and biblical examples for communication as a healing art in 
caring for PwD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases 
characterized by cognitive and memory impairment. Metal ion imbalance and 
Mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to abnormal aggregation of β-amyloid protein 
(Aβ), are key factors in the pathogenesis of AD. Therefore, we designed a 
composite nanometer system of red blood cell (RBC) membranes-encapsulated 
Prussian blue nanoparticles (PB/RBC). Prussian blue nanoparticles (PBNPs) can 
chelate Cu2+ and reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS). The RBC membranes are a 
kind of natural long-lasting circulating carrier. At the same time, through NIR 
irradiation, the excellent photothermal ability of PBNPs can also temporarily 
open the blood-brain barrier (BBB), enhance the transmission efficiency of 
PB/RBC across the BBB, and depolymerize the formed Aβ deposits, thereby 
achieving the optimal therapeutic effect. In vitro and in vivo studies 
demonstrated that PB/RBC could inhibit Cu2+-induced Aβ monomers aggregation, 
eliminate the deposition of Aβ plaques, improve the quality of mitochondria, 
restore the phagocytic function of microglia, alleviate neuroinflammation in 
APP/PS1 mice, and repair memory damage. In conclusion, our biofilm-camouflaged 
nano-delivery system provides significant neuroprotection by inhibiting 
Cu2+-induced Aβ monomers aggregation, photothermally depolymerizing Aβ fibrils 
and reducing the level of ROS, thus effectively ameliorating and treating AD.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The dried rattan stem of Tinospora sinensis 
(Lour.) Merr. is valued for its efficacy of clearing heat and removing toxicity, 
calming and soothing the nerves. It is widely used in Tibetan medicine for the 
treatment of rheumatic and aging diseases. Studies have confirmed its 
anti-inflammatory and ameliorating effects on Alzheimer's disease; however, the 
anti-neuroinflammation efficacy and mechanism remain unclear.
AIM: This study aimed to explore the anti-neuroinflammation efficacy, major 
effective ingredients, and potential mechanism of extract of Tinosporae 
sinenisis (TIS).
METHODS: UPLC-Q-TOF/MS was used to identify the compounds of TIS and the plasma 
components of rats after gastric administration of TIS. C57BL/6 J mice were 
continuously intraperitoneally injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 
(250 μg/kg) for 14 d to establish a neuroinflammation model. The effects of TIS 
(4.5 g/kg, 9 g/kg) on the learning and memory abilities in mice with 
neuroinflammation was evaluated using spontaneous activity, novel object 
recognition, and Morris water maze tests. Pathological changes in the 
hippocampus were observed using hematoxylin and eosin staining. Gene and protein 
levels of inflammatory factors in the brain were detected using qRT-PCR and 
ELISA kits. Iba-1 levels in the brain were detected using immunofluorescence to 
assess the degree of microglial activation. Network pharmacology, based on the 
components absorbed into plasma of TIS, was used to predict potential targets 
and pathways. Proteomics was used to study the differentially expressed proteins 
and related pathways in the brain tissue of mice with neuroinflammation. 
Finally, correlation analysis was performed on the results of network 
pharmacology and proteomics, and proteins related the anti-neuroinflammatory 
effect of TIS were detected by western blot.
RESULTS: A total of 39 compounds were identified in TIS: genipingentiobioside, 
isocorydin, reticuline, (-)-argemonine, tinosineside A, tinosinenside A, and 
costunolide were absorbed into the plasma. After continuous intraperitoneal 
injection of LPS into C57BL/6 J mice, microglia in the brain tissue were 
activated and the gene and protein levels of IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, and iNOS were 
increased in the brain tissue, suggesting that the neuroinflammation model was 
successfully established. TIS reduced Iba-1 levels and gene expression and 
protein levels of inflammatory factors in the brain of mice with 
neuroinflammation. Furthermore, TIS improved the pathological changes in the 
hippocampus and learning and memory abilities caused by neuroinflammation. 
Network pharmacology has predicted that TNF, IL-1β, and IκBKB are closely 
related to neuroinflammation. Proteomics identified key differentially expressed 
proteins, including TNF, NF-κB2, NF-κBIA, and TLR4. Toll-like receptor (TLR), 
NF-κB, and NOD-like receptor (NLR) signaling pathways are involved in 
neuroinflammation-related pathways. Correlation analysis revealed TLR, TNF and 
NLR signaling pathways were closely related to the anti-neuroinflammatory 
effects of TIS. We observed that TIS alleviated neuroinflammation by inhibiting 
the TLR4/NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway.
CONCLUSION: Thirty-nine compounds were identified from TIS, among which seven 
were absorbed into the plasma as prototype components. TIS alleviated 
LPS-induced neuroinflammation in mice, and its mechanism was related to 
inhibition of TLR4/NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling pathway.

OBJECTIVE: SARS-CoV-2 vaccination can bring an important benefit for older 
people in terms of reduction of mortality and hospitalization; however, reports 
of rare adverse effects like altered consciousness and delirium among this 
demographic have raised concerns. This study aimed to assess delirium incidence 
post-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and its predictors in older residents across 60 
Italian long-term care facilities (LTCFs).
DESIGN: This is a prospective cohort study considering data from GeroCovid Vax, 
a multicenter cohort study jointly performed by the Italian Society of 
Gerontology and Geriatrics (SIGG) (Florence, Italy) and the Italian National 
Institute of Health (Istituto Superiore di Sanità-ISS, Rome, Italy), and 
sponsored by the Italian Medicines Agency (Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco-AIFA).
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: GeroCovid Vax enrolled LTCFs residents aged ≥60 who 
received at least 1 anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose.
METHODS: Baseline data covered sociodemographic details, chronic diseases, 
medications, nutritional status, cognitive and functional assessments, mobility, 
and frailty. Delirium was assessed post-first, second, and booster vaccine doses 
using DSM-5 criteria. Data analysis involved descriptive statistics, 
multivariate logistic regression, and network analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 2521 participants (mean age 83.10 ± 9.21 years, 70.7% 
female) were analyzed. Delirium incidence post-first, second, and booster doses 
was 3.5%, 1.6%, and 1.5%, respectively. Age, preexisting cognitive disorders, 
and frailty were significant predictors of delirium, with odds ratios (ORs) of 
1.70 (95% CI, 1.08-2.77), 2.05 (95% CI, 1.40-2.97), and 1.77 (95% CI, 
1.25-2.52), respectively. Prior use of antipsychotics (OR, 1.75; 95% CI, 
1.22-2.51) and antidepressants (OR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.25-2.52) correlated 
significantly with delirium. Network analysis indicated a strong association 
between anorexia and delirium.
CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Post-vaccination delirium is infrequent and 
decreases with subsequent doses. Timely assessments for frailty and cognitive 
impairment could aid in stratifying delirium risk among LTCF residents, 
facilitating enhanced prevention measures and close monitoring for delirium 
indicators.

The sex of the patient often affects the prevalence, progression, and severity 
of many psychiatric disorders. The incidence, progression, and severity of 
Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, the most common neurodegenerative 
diseases, also differ between the sexes. Sex differences in autism spectrum 
disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and anxiety are 
also observed in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Neuropsychiatric symptoms are 
one of the most important manifestations of TSC, and the multiple 
neuropsychiatric symptoms are collectively referred to as TSC-associated 
neuropsychiatric disorders (TAND). We created TSC model mice (Tsc2 conditional 
knockout [cKO] mice) that developed epilepsy and TAND. Sex-based differences 
were observed for hyperactivity and cognitive dysfunctions in Tsc2 cKO mice with 
TAND, indicating more severe symptoms in female mice than in male mice. TSC is 
thought to be caused by the hyperactivation of mechanistic target of rapamycin 
complex 1 (mTORC1), and mTORC1 inhibitors improve almost all TSC symptoms. 
Treatment with sirolimus, an mTORC1 inhibitor, improved TAND in Tsc2 cKO mice. 
We aimed to elucidate the mechanism underlying sex-based differences in TAND 
using Tsc2 cKO mice and sirolimus. We found that estradiol (E2) and estrogen 
receptor (ER)α are involved in sex differences in neuropsychiatric symptoms, and 
discovered a novel function of sirolimus. We showed that sirolimus ameliorated 
TAND by modulating brain steroid levels and regulating E2/ERα-dependent 
transcriptional activation. This indicates sirolimus may be beneficial for the 
treatment of TAND as well as diseases caused by sex-based differences and 
steroid levels.

neurological condition due to the loss of cholinergic neurons (ChNs), 
accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ), and abnormal phosphorylation of the TAU 
protein. Up to date, there are no effective therapies available. The need for 
innovative treatments for this illness is critical. We found that minocycline 
(MC, 5 μM) was innocuous toward wild-type (WT) PSEN1 ChLNs but significantly (i) 
reduces the accumulation of intracellular Aβ by -69%, (ii) blocks both abnormal 
phosphorylation of the protein TAU at residue Ser202/Thr205 by -33% and (iii) 
phosphorylation of the proapoptotic transcription factor c-JUN at residue 
Ser63/Ser73 by -25%, (iv) diminishes oxidized DJ-1 at Cys106-SO3 by -29%, (v) 
downregulates the expression of transcription factor TP53, (vi) BH-3-only 
protein PUMA, and (vii) cleaved caspase 3 (CC3) by -33, -86, and -78%, 
respectively, compared with untreated PSEN1 E280A ChLNs. Additionally, MC 
increases the response to ACh-induced Ca2+ influx by +92% in mutant ChLNs. 
Oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) and ferric ion-reducing antioxidant 
power (FRAP) analysis showed that MC might operate more efficiently as a 
hydrogen atom transfer agent than a single electron transfer agent. In silico 
molecular docking analysis predicts that MC binds with high affinity to Aβ (Vina 
Score -6.6 kcal/mol), TAU (VS -6.5 kcal/mol), and caspase 3 (VS -7.1 kcal/mol). 
Taken together, our findings suggest that MC demonstrates antioxidant, 
anti-amyloid, and anti-apoptosis activity and promotes physiological ACh-induced 
Ca2+ influx in PSEN1 E280A ChLNs. The MC has therapeutic potential for treating 
early-onset FAD.

BACKGROUND: Motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCR) is defined as the presence of 
slow gait-speed and subjective cognitive decline in older individuals without 
mobility disability or dementia. While some studies suggest that MCR is a 
pre-dementia syndrome and may help predict the risk of cognitive impairment and 
dementia, not all studies concur. The objective of this study is to 
comprehensively summarize and synthesize evidence to assess the association 
between MCR and cognitive impairment and dementia.
METHODS: Following a pre-specified protocol, two authors systematically searched 
PubMed, Embase, and The Cochrane Library from inception to 19 August 2024 for 
observational or randomized studies pertaining to the association between MCR 
and cognitive impairment and dementia. We favoured maximally adjusted hazards 
and odds ratios to determine the longitudinal and cross-sectional risk of 
cognitive impairment and dementia. We investigated for potential sources of 
heterogeneity and also conducted sensitivity and subgroup analyses by continent 
and the type of cognitive outcome. The quality of evidence was assessed using 
the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, 
Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework.
RESULTS: We included 20 studies comprising a combined cohort of 1206,782 
participants, of which 17 studies were included in the quantitative analysis. 
The pooled analysis outlined that individuals with MCR exhibited 2.20-fold 
higher risk of cognitive impairment and dementia, compared to controls (RR=2.20; 
95 %CI=1.91-2.53). These findings remained robust across all subgroup analyses, 
sensitivity analyses and assessments of publication bias.
CONCLUSION: MCR may be considered a predictive factor for long-term cognitive 
impairment and dementia. This should be taken into consideration when clinically 
evaluating the risk of cognitive impairment and dementia but further research is 
required to lend greater clarity to this association.

Brain iron homeostasis plays a vital role in maintaining brain development and 
controlling neuronal function under physiological conditions. Many studies have 
shown that the imbalance of brain iron homeostasis is closely related to the 
pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), such as Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Recent advances have revealed the importance 
of iron transporters and regulatory molecules in the pathogenesis and treatment 
of NDs. This review summarizes the research progress on brain iron overload and 
the aberrant expression of several key iron transporters and regulators in AD 
and PD, emphasizes the pathological roles of these molecules in the pathogenesis 
of AD and PD, and highlights the therapeutic prospects of targeting these iron 
transporters and regulators to restore brain iron homeostasis in the treatment 
of AD and PD. A comprehensive understanding of the pathophysiological roles of 
iron, iron transporters and regulators, and their regulations in NDs may provide 
new therapeutic avenues for more targeted neurotherapeutic strategies for 
treating these diseases.

BACKGROUND: Synaptic dysfunction, characterized by synapse loss and structural 
alterations, emerges as a prominent correlate of cognitive decline in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Actin cytoskeleton, which serves as the structural 
backbone of synaptic architecture, is observed to be lost from synapses in AD. 
Actin cytoskeleton loss compromises synaptic integrity, affecting glutamatergic 
receptor levels, neurotransmission, and synaptic strength. Understanding these 
molecular changes is crucial for developing interventions targeting synaptic 
dysfunction, potentially mitigating cognitive decline in AD.
METHODS: In this study, we investigated the synaptic actin interactome using 
mass spectrometry in a mouse model of AD, APP/PS1. Our objective was to explore 
how alterations in synaptic actin dynamics, particularly the interaction between 
PSD-95 and actin, contribute to synaptic and cognitive impairment in AD. To 
assess the impact of restoring F-actin levels on synaptic and cognitive 
functions in APP/PS1 mice, we administered F-actin stabilizing agent, 
jasplakinolide. Behavioral deficits in the mice were evaluated using the 
contextual fear conditioning paradigm. We utilized primary neuronal cultures to 
study the synaptic levels of AMPA and NMDA receptors and the dynamics of PSD-95 
actin association. Furthermore, we analyzed postmortem brain tissue samples from 
subjects with no cognitive impairment (NCI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 
and Alzheimer's dementia (AD) to determine the association between PSD-95 and 
actin.
RESULTS: We found a significant reduction in PSD-95-actin association in 
synaptosomes from middle-aged APP/PS1 mice compared to wild-type (WT) mice. 
Treatment with jasplakinolide, an actin stabilizer, reversed deficits in memory 
recall, restored PSD-95-actin association, and increased synaptic F-actin levels 
in APP/PS1 mice. Additionally, actin stabilization led to elevated synaptic 
levels of AMPA and NMDA receptors, enhanced dendritic spine density, suggesting 
improved neurotransmission and synaptic strength in primary cortical neurons 
from APP/PS1 mice. Furthermore, analysis of postmortem human tissue with NCI, 
MCI and AD subjects revealed disrupted PSD-95-actin interactions, underscoring 
the clinical relevance of our preclinical studies.
CONCLUSION: Our study elucidates disrupted PSD-95 actin interactions across 
different models, highlighting potential therapeutic targets for AD. Stabilizing 
F-actin restores synaptic integrity and ameliorates cognitive deficits in 
APP/PS1 mice, suggesting that targeting synaptic actin regulation could be a 
promising therapeutic strategy to mitigate cognitive decline in AD.

As the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its impact on healthcare 
systems increase, developing tools for accurate diagnosis and monitoring of 
disease progression is a priority. Recent technological advancements have 
allowed for the development of blood-based biomarkers (BBMs) to aid in the 
diagnosis of AD, but many questions remain regarding the clinical implementation 
of these BBMs. This review outlines the historical timeline of AD BBM 
development. It highlights key breakthroughs that have transformed the 
perspective of AD BBMs from theoretically ideal but unattainable markers, to 
clinically valid and reliable BBMs with potential for implementation in 
healthcare settings. Technological advancements like single-molecule detection 
and mass spectrometry methods have significantly improved assay sensitivity and 
accuracy. High-throughput, fully automated platforms have potential for clinical 
use. Despite these advancements, however, significant work is needed before AD 
BBMs can be implemented in widespread clinical practice. Cutpoints must be 
established, the influence of chronic conditions and medications on BBM levels 
must be better understood, and guidelines must be created for healthcare 
providers related to interpreting and communicating information obtained from AD 
BBMs. Additionally, the development of BBMs for synaptic dysfunction, 
inflammation, and cerebrovascular disease may provide better precision medicine 
approaches to treating AD and related dementia. Future research and 
collaboration between scientists and physicians are essential to addressing 
these challenges and further advancing AD BBMs, with the goal of integration in 
clinical practice.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Cognitive dysfunction associated with diabetes, 
known as diabetic encephalopathy (DE), is a grave neurodegenerative condition 
triggered by diabetes, and persistent inflammation plays a vital role in its 
development. The renowned traditional Chinese medicine Huang-Lian-Jie-Du 
Decoction (HLJDD) is clinically proven to manage diabetes mellitus and 
Alzheimer's disease and is famous for its heat-clearing and detoxifying effects. 
However, the underlying mechanisms through which HLJDD affects DE remain to be 
elucidated.
AIM OF THE STUDY: To explore the beneficial effects of HLJDD on improving 
cognitive dysfunction in DE mice.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A diabetic mouse was established through a high-fat 
diet and subsequent administration of streptozotocin over five consecutive days. 
After the animals were confirmed to have diabetes, they were treated with HLJDD. 
After oral administration of HLJDD or metformin for 14 weeks, behavioral tests 
were used to assess their cognitive capacity. Biochemical analyses were then 
performed to detect levels of glucose metabolism, followed by histological 
analyses to assess pathological damage. Furthermore, AGEs/RAGE/NF-κB axis 
related proteins were detected by Western blot or immunofluorescence techniques. 
An advanced UPLC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS/MS analytical technique utilizing a chemical 
derivatization strategy was employed for comprehensive metabolic profiling of 
carbonyl compounds in the plasma of DE mice.
RESULTS: Pharmacological assessment revealed that HLJDD effectively mitigated 
cognitive dysfunction, normalized glucose metabolic imbalances, and repaired 
neuronal damage in DE mice. It reduced neuroinflammation by attenuating carbonyl 
stress, deactivating astrocytes and microglia, and preserving dopaminergic 
neurons. Additionally, metabolomics analysis revealed 18 carbonyl compounds with 
marked disparities between DE and control mice, with 12 metabolites approaching 
normal levels post-HLJDD intervention. Further investigations showed that HLJDD 
regulated inflammation and pyroptosis through suppressing AGEs/RAGE/NF-κB 
pathways.
CONCLUSION: Our study indicated that HLJDD could ameliorate carbonyl stress via 
the regulation of carbonyl compound metabolism profiling, and inhibiting the 
AGEs/RAGE/NF-κB pathway, thereby alleviating inflammation and pyroptosis to 
exert beneficial effects on DE.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY RELEVANCE: Ayahuasca is a beverage obtained from the 
decoctions of Banisteriopsis caapi (Spruce ex Griseb.) Morton and Psychotria 
viridis Ruiz & Pav., used throughout the Amazon as a medicinal beverage for 
healing and spiritual exploration. The Banisteriopsis caapi extract consists of 
harmine, harmaline, and tetrahydroharmine (THH); which inhibit the isoforms of 
monoamine oxidase A and B. In the central nervous system (CNS), it can increase 
the norepinephrine (NE) concentration, produced in the Locus coeruleus (LC), 
reducing inflammation that is associated with some neurological disease, such as 
Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.
AIM OF THE STUDY: evaluate the effects of treatment with B. caapi extract on the 
neuroinflammatory profile in animals with selective LC lesions.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: male Wistar rats with LC lesions induced by 
6-hydroxydopamine were treated with B. caapi extract. Subsequently, behavioral 
tests were conducted, including the elevated plus maze, rotarod, and open field. 
Tyrosine hydroxylase positive (TH+) neurons and IBA-1 positive microglia were 
quantified from the LC inflammatory markers and free radical products were 
assessed.
RESULTS: Both 6-Hydroxydopamine hydrochloride and the Banisteriopsis caapi 
extract causes reduction of LC neurons, at the concentration and frequency used. 
The LC depletion and the treatment of B. caapi extract interfere with 
locomotion. B. caapi extract and the LC lesion increased the number and 
activation of inflammatory cells, such as microglia. B. caapi extract decreases 
IL-10 in the hippocampus and BDNF gene expression.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that B. caapi extract (at the concentration and 
frequency used) promotes noradrenergic neuron depletion and creates a 
proinflammatory environment in the CNS.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease 
characterized by memory impairment and cognitive dysfunction, which eventually 
leads to the disability and mortality of older adults. Although the precise 
mechanisms by which age promotes the development of AD remains poorly 
understood, mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role in the development of 
AD. Currently, there is no effective treatment for this debilitating disease. It 
is well accepted that exercise exerts neuroprotective effects by ameliorating 
mitochondrial dysfunction in the neurons of AD, which involves multiple 
mechanisms, including mitochondrial dynamics, biogenesis, mitophagy, transport, 
and signal transduction. In addition, exercise promotes mitochondria 
communication with other organelles in AD neurons, which should receive more

(±)-Elodeoidileons A-L (1-12), 12 pairs of previously undescribed filicinic acid 
based meroterpenoids were isolated from Hypericum elodeoides with unique linear 
or angular 6/6/6 ring core. Modern spectroscopic techniques, modified Mosher's 
method and quantum chemical calculations were used to identify the planner 
structures and configurations of 1-12. Additionally, the potential biosynthetic 
pathways for 1-12 were anticipated. Moreover, biological activity assessments 
suggested that 1a, 5a, and 11b could activate Retinoid X receptor-α (RXRα) 
transcription and enhance the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) 
protein's expression. Fluorescence titration assay suggested that 1a might have 
a direct interaction with the RXRα-LBD protein, with an estimated Kd value of 
5.85 μM. Moreover, molecular docking study confirmed the binding of 1a to RXRα 
and further validated by cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA). Thus, compound 1a 
may promote β-amyloid (Aβ) clearance by targeting RXRα and upregulating the 
expression of the ABCA1 protein, showing promise as anti-Alzheimer's agent.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia among the elderly, 
accounting for 60 %-70 % of cases. At present, the pathogenesis of this 
condition remains unclear, but the hydrolysis of acetylcholine (ACh) is thought 
to play a role. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) can break down ACh transmission from 
the presynaptic membrane and stop neurotransmitters' excitatory effect on the 
postsynaptic membrane, which plays a key role in nerve conduction. 
Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) can delay the hydrolysis of 
acetylcholine (ACh), which represents a key strategy for treating AD. Due to its 
complex etiology, AD has proven challenging to treat. Various inhibitors and 
antagonists targeting key enzymes and proteins implicated in the disease's 
pathogenesis have been explored as potential therapeutic agents. These include 
Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3β (GSK-3β) inhibitors, β-site APP Cleaving Enzyme 
(BACE-1) inhibitors, Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, Phosphodiesterase 
inhibitors (PDEs), N-methyl--aspartic Acid (NMDA) antagonists, Histamine 3 
receptor antagonists (H3R), Serotonin receptor subtype 4 (5-HT4R) antagonists, 
Sigma1 receptor antagonists (S1R) and soluble Epoxide Hydrolase (sEH) 
inhibitors. The drug development strategy of multi-target-directed ligands 
(MTDLs) offers unique advantages in the treatment of complex diseases. On the 
one hand, it can synergistically enhance the therapeutic efficacy of 
single-target drugs. On the other hand, it can also reduce the side effects. In 
this review, we discuss the design strategy of dual inhibitors based on 
acetylcholinesterase and the structure-activity relationship of these drugs.

Dysfunctional phagocytic clearance of β-amyloid (Aβ) in microglia and peripheral 
macrophages/monocytes has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease, but the 
mechanisms underlying this dysfunction are not yet well understood. In this 
study, we examined the role of glia maturation factor-γ (GMFG), an 
actin-disassembly protein, i.e. highly expressed in immune cells, in macrophage 
Aβ phagocytosis and in regulating type I class A scavenger receptor, a 
cell-surface receptor that has previously been implicated in Aβ clearance. GMFG 
knockdown-increased phagocytosis of Aβ42 in bone marrow-derived macrophages and 
RAW264.7 murine macrophages, while GMFG overexpression reduced Aβ42 uptake in 
these cells. Blocking with anti-type I class A scavenger receptor antibodies 
inhibited Aβ42 uptake in GMFG-knockdown cells, establishing a role for type I 
class A scavenger receptor in Aβ42 phagocytosis. GMFG knockdown-increased type I 
class A scavenger receptor protein expression under both basal conditions and in 
response to Aβ42 treatment via both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional 
levels in RAW264.7 macrophages. GMFG knockdown modulated Aβ42-induced K48-linked 
and K63-polyubiquitination of type I class A scavenger receptor, the 
phosphorylation of type I class A scavenger receptor and c-Jun N-Terminal kinase 
(JNK), suggesting that GMFG plays a role for intracellular signaling in the type 
I class A scavenger receptor--mediated uptake of Aβ. Further, GMFG-knockdown 
cells displayed increased levels of the transcriptional factor MafB, and 
silencing of MafB in these cells reduced their type I class A scavenger receptor 
expression. Finally, GMFG was found to interact with the nuclear pore complex 
component RanBP2, and silencing of RanBP2 in GMFG-knockdown cells reduced their 
type I class A scavenger receptor expression. Collectively, these data support 
the role of GMFG as a novel regulator of type I class A scavenger receptor in 
macrophage Aβ phagocytosis and may provide insight into therapeutic approaches 
to potentially slow or prevent the progression of Alzheimer's disease.

BACKGROUND: Phytocannabinoids inhibit the aggregation and neurotoxicity of the 
neurotoxic Alzheimer's disease protein β amyloid (Aβ). We characterised the 
capacity of five proprietary medical cannabis extracts, heated and non-heated, 
with varying ratios of cannabidiol and Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol and their parent 
carboxylated compounds to protect against lipid peroxidation and Aβ-evoked 
neurotoxicity in PC12 cells.
METHODS: Neuroprotection against lipid peroxidation and Aβ1-42-induced 
cytotoxicity was assessed using the thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) 
assay. Transmission electron microscopy was used to visualise phytocannabinoid 
effects on Aβ1-42 aggregation and fluorescence microscopy.
RESULTS: Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)/tetrahydrocannabinolic acid 
(THCA)-predominant cannabis extracts demonstrated the most significant overall 
neuroprotection against Aβ1-42-induced loss of PC12 cell viability. These 
protective effects were still significant after heating of extracts, while none 
of the extracts provided significant neuroprotection to lipid peroxidation via 
tbhp exposure. Modest inhibition of Aβ1-42 aggregation was demonstrated only 
with the non-heated BC-401 cannabis extract, but overall, there was no clear 
correlation between effects on fibrils and conferral of neuroprotection.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the variable neuroprotective activity of 
cannabis extracts containing major phytocannabinoids THC/THCA and cannabidiol 
(CBD)/cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) on Aβ-evoked neurotoxicity and inhibition of 
amyloid β aggregation. This may inform the future use of medicinal cannabis 
formulations in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and dementia.

Progressive gait impairment is common among aging adults. Remote phenotyping of 
gait during daily living has the potential to quantify gait alterations and 
evaluate the effects of interventions that may prevent disability in the aging 
population. Here, we developed ElderNet, a self-supervised learning model for 
gait detection from wrist-worn accelerometer data. Validation involved two 
diverse cohorts, including over 1000 participants without gait labels, as well 
as 83 participants with labeled data: older adults with Parkinson's disease, 
proximal femoral fracture, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive 
heart failure, and healthy adults. ElderNet presented high accuracy 
(96.43 ± 2.27), specificity (98.87 ± 2.15), recall (82.32 ± 11.37), precision 
(86.69 ± 17.61), and F1 score (82.92 ± 13.39). The suggested method yielded 
superior performance compared to two state-of-the-art gait detection algorithms, 
with improved accuracy and F1 score (p < 0.05). In an initial evaluation of 
construct validity, ElderNet identified differences in estimated daily walking 
durations across cohorts with different clinical characteristics, such as 
mobility disability (p < 0.001) and parkinsonism (p < 0.001). The proposed 
self-supervised method has the potential to serve as a valuable tool for remote 
phenotyping of gait function during daily living in aging adults, even among 
those with gait impairments.

BACKGROUND: Antipsychotic and other psychotropic medication use is prevalent 
among community-dwelling older adults with dementia despite the potential for 
adverse effects. Two Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) initiatives, 
the National Partnership to Improve Dementia Care ("the Partnership") and the 
Five Star Quality Rating System for antipsychotic use reporting, have been 
successful in reducing antipsychotic use in nursing home residents. We assessed 
if these initiatives had a spillover effect in antipsychotic and other 
psychotropic medication use among community dwellers with dementia due to 
potential overlap in prescribers across settings.
METHODS: Among community-dwelling older adults with dementia, we examined 
psychotropic medication class use (i.e., antipsychotics, antidepressants, 
anxiolytics, anticonvulsants/mood stabilizers, antidementia) in 2010-2017 
Medicare fee-for-service claims using interrupted time series analyses across 
three periods ("Pre-Partnership": July 1, 2010 to March 31, 2012; 
"Post-Partnership": April 1, 2012 to January 31, 2015; "Five Star Quality 
Rating": February 1, 2015 to December 31, 2017).
RESULTS: We included 1,289,401 community dwellers with dementia contributing 
26,609,697 person-months. The mean age was 80 years, most were female (70%), 
approximately 80% were non-Hispanic Whites, 10% were non-Hispanic Blacks, and 5% 
were Hispanic ethnicity. Antipsychotic use was declining pre-Partnership 
(β = -0.06, 95% CI: -0.08, -0.05) and post-Partnership (β = -0.02, 95% CI: 
-0.02, -0.01). Post-Five Star Quality Rating, antipsychotic use remained stable 
with a nearly flat slope (β = -0.01, 95% CI: -0.01, 0.00). Anticonvulsant and 
antidepressant use increased and anxiolytic and antidementia medication use 
decreased among community-dwelling older adults with dementia.
CONCLUSIONS: These two CMS policies on antipsychotic use for nursing home 
residents were not associated with a spillover effect to community-dwelling 
older adults with dementia. Strategies to monitor the appropriateness of 
psychotropic medication use may be warranted for community-dwellers with 
dementia.

The neuropsychiatric effects of probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics have been 
gaining attention since the rise of microbial-gut-brain axis research. 
Nevertheless, some of the findings are inconsistent, and few studies have 
analysed the similarities and differences in the neuropsychiatric effects of the 
three comprehensively. To reveal the respective neuropsychiatric effects of 
probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics and synthesise the similarities and 
differences among the three effects, 47 meta-analyses with 12 types of 
neuropsychiatric results were integrated under an umbrella review. Probiotics, 
prebiotics, and synbiotics intake might all be associated with improvements in 
some neuropsychiatric outcomes, including neuropsychological test outcomes 
(probiotic and prebiotic), hepatic encephalopathy outcomes (probiotic, 
prebiotic, and synbiotic), instant memory in patients with Alzheimer's disease 
(probiotic), depressive symptoms (probiotic, prebiotic and synbiotic), mood 
states and psychiatric distress (probiotic), overall mental health (probiotic), 
neurological function (probiotic), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) 
concentration (probiotic and synbiotic), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index 
(PSQI) score (probiotic). All three are similar in that the intake of 
probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics might be associated with improvements in 
hepatic encephalopathy outcomes and depressive symptoms, both probiotic and 
synbiotic intake might be associated with elevated BDNF concentrations, and both 
probiotic and prebiotic intake might be associated with improved 
neuropsychological test results. The difference between the three is that the 
neuropsychiatric effects of probiotics might be more widespread and be reflected 
in the fact that probiotic intake might also be associated with improvements in 
mood states and psychiatric distress, overall mental health, neurological 
function, Alzheimer's disease patients' instant memory, and PSQI score. 
Probiotics might be the best and most promising option for improving 
neuropsychiatric outcomes. In the future, in addition to requiring more 
high-quality meta-analyses, further preclinical studies are needed to explore 
specific relevant mechanisms and determine true causal relationships.

A multifaceted approach in treating Alzheimer's disease (AD), a 
neurodegenerative condition that poses health risks in the aging population is 
explored in this investigation via encapsulating Piper betle essential oil 
(PBEO) in chitosan nanoparticles (ChNPs) to improve solubility and efficacy of 
PBEO. PBEO-ChNPs mitigated AD-like features more effectively than free PBEO by 
delaying paralysis progression and reducing serotonin hypersensitivity, ROS 
levels, Aβ deposits, and neurotoxic Aβ-oligomers in the Caenorhabditis elegans 
AD model. PBEO-ChNPs significantly improved lifespan, neuronal health, 
healthspan, cognitive function, and reversed deficits in chemotaxis and 
reproduction. PBEO-ChNPs also induced stress response genes daf-16, sod-3, and 
hsp-16.2. The participation of the DAF-16 pathway in reducing Aβ-induced 
toxicity was confirmed by daf-16 RNAi treatment, and upregulation of autophagy 
genes leg-1, unc-51, and bec-1 was noted. This study is the first to demonstrate 
an alternative biopolymeric nanoformulation with natural PBEO and chitosan, in 
mitigating AD and its associated symptoms.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Research suggests that traditional Chinese 
medicine (TCM) holds promise in offering innovative approaches to tackle 
neurodegenerative disorders. In our endeavor, we conducted a comprehensive 
bibliometric analysis to delve into the landscape of TCM research within the 
realm of neurodegenerative diseases, aiming to uncover the present scenario, 
breadth, and trends in this field. This analysis presents potentially valuable 
insights for the clinical application of traditional Chinese medicine and 
provides compelling evidence supporting its efficacy in the treatment of 
neurodegenerative conditions.
AIM OF THE STUDY: The incidence of neurodegenerative diseases is on the rise, 
yet effective treatments are still lacking. Research indicates that TCM could 
offer novel perspectives for addressing neurodegenerative conditions. 
Nonetheless, the literature on this topic is intricate and multifaceted, with 
existing reviews offering only limited coverage. To gain a thorough 
understanding of TCM research in neurodegenerative diseases, we undertook a 
bibliometric analysis to explore the current status, scope, and trends in this 
area.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature search was carried out on April 1, 2024, 
utilizing the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC). Visualization and 
quantitative analyses were then performed with the assistance of CiteSpace, 
VOSviewer, and R software.
RESULTS: A total of 6856 articles were retrieved in the search. Research on TCM 
for neurodegenerative diseases commenced in 1989 and has exhibited a notable 
overall growth since then. Main research contributors include East Asian 
countries like China, as well as the United States. Through our analysis, we 
identified 15 highly productive authors, 10 top-tier journals, 13 citation 
clusters, 11 influential articles, and observed a progression in keyword 
evolution across 4 distinct categories. In 2020, there was a significant upsurge 
in the knowledge base, collaboration efforts, and publication output within the 
field. This field is interdisciplinary: network pharmacology emerges as the 
cutting-edge paradigm in TCM research, while Alzheimer's disease remains a 
prominent focus among neurodegenerative conditions due to its evolving etiology. 
A burst detection analysis unveils that in 2024, the focal points of research 
convergence between TCM and neurodegenerative diseases lie in two key biological 
processes or mechanisms: autophagy and microbiota.
CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, this study quantitatively and visually captures 
the evolution of TCM in addressing neurodegenerative diseases, showcasing a 
notable acceleration in recent years. Our findings underscore the pivotal role 
of interdisciplinary collaboration and the necessity for increased global 
partnerships. Network pharmacology, leveraging the advancements of the big data 
era, embraces a holistic and systematic approach as a novel paradigm in 
exploring traditional Chinese medicine and unraveling their fundamental 
mechanisms. Three ethnomedical plants-Tianma, Renshen, and Wuweizi-demonstrate 
the promise of their bioactive compounds in treating neurodegenerative 
disorders, bolstered by their extensive historical usage for such ailments. 
Moreover, our intricate analysis of the evolutionary trajectories of key themes 
such as targets and biomarkers substantially enriches our comprehension of the 
underlying mechanisms involved.

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), widely expressed in the human central 
nervous system (CNS), perform numerous physiological functions and play a 
significant role in the pathogenesis of diseases. Consequently, identifying key 
therapeutic GPCRs targets for CNS-related diseases is garnering immense interest 
in research labs and pharmaceutical companies. However, using GPCRs drugs for 
treating neurodegenerative diseases has limitations, including side effects and 
uncertain effective time frame. Recognizing the rich history of herbal 
treatments for neurological disorders like stroke, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 
Parkinson's disease (PD), modern pharmacological research is now focusing on the 
understanding of the efficacy of traditional Chinese medicinal herbs and 
compounds in modulating GPCRs and treatment of neurodegenerative conditions. 
This paper will offer a comprehensive, critical review of how certain natural 
products and compounds target GPCRs to treat neurological diseases. Conducting 
an in-depth study of herbal remedies and their efficacies against CNS-related 
disorders through GPCRs targeting will augment our strategies for treating 
neurological disorders. This will not only broaden our understanding of 
effective therapeutic methodologies but also identify the root causes of altered 
GPCRs signaling in the context of pathophysiological mechanisms in neurological 
diseases. Moreover, it would be informative for the creation of safer and more 
effective GPCR-mediated drugs, thereby establishing a foundation for future 
treatment of various neurological diseases.

Over the last fifteen years, numerous studies have sought to decipher the role 
of lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) in vascular 
inflammation-related diseases, notably atherosclerosis. Despite the 
disappointing results of clinical trials using the Lp-PLA2 inhibitor darapladib, 
new pathophysiological, epidemiological and genetic data have enabled the 
development of new inhibitors. Recent studies also show that Lp-PLA2 is involved 
in vascular inflammation-related diseases other than atherosclerosis (ischemic 
stroke, Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia, diabetes, cancers…), and 
inhibition of Lp-PLA2 could have beneficial therapeutic in these diseases. This 
review aims to present new data on Lp-PLA2 and to evaluate its current interest 
as a biomarker but also as a therapeutic target.

Homeostatic regulation of neuronal activity is essential for robust computation; 
set-points, such as firing rate, are actively stabilized to compensate for 
perturbations. The disruption of brain function central to neurodegenerative 
disease likely arises from impairments of computationally essential set-points. 
Here, we systematically investigated the effects of tau-mediated 
neurodegeneration on all known set-points in neuronal activity. We continuously 
tracked hippocampal neuronal activity across the lifetime of a mouse model of 
tauopathy. We were unable to detect effects of disease in measures of 
single-neuron firing activity. By contrast, as tauopathy progressed, there was 
disruption of network-level neuronal activity, quantified by measuring neuronal 
pairwise interactions and criticality, a homeostatically controlled, ideal 
computational regime. Deviations in criticality correlated with symptoms, 
predicted underlying anatomical pathology, occurred in a sleep-wake-dependent 
manner, and could be used to reliably classify an animal's genotype. This work 
illustrates how neurodegeneration may disrupt the computational capacity of 
neurobiological systems.

Progression of acute traumatic brain injury (TBI) into chronic neurodegeneration 
is a major health problem with no protective treatments. Here, we report that 
acutely elevated mitochondrial fission after TBI in mice triggers chronic 
neurodegeneration persisting 17 months later, equivalent to many human decades. 
We show that increased mitochondrial fission after mouse TBI is related to 
increased brain levels of mitochondrial fission 1 protein (Fis1) and that brain 
Fis1 is also elevated in human TBI. Pharmacologically preventing Fis1 from 
binding its mitochondrial partner, dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), for 2 weeks 
after TBI normalizes the balance of mitochondrial fission/fusion and prevents 
chronically impaired mitochondrial bioenergetics, oxidative damage, microglial 
activation and lipid droplet formation, blood-brain barrier deterioration, 
neurodegeneration, and cognitive impairment. Delaying treatment until 8 months 
after TBI offers no protection. Thus, time-sensitive inhibition of acutely 
elevated mitochondrial fission may represent a strategy to protect human TBI 
patients from chronic neurodegeneration.

INTRODUCTION: Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) result from a complex interplay 
of genetic, environmental and aging factors. A balanced diet and adequate 
physical activity (PA) are recognized as pivotal components among modifiable 
environmental factors. The independent impact on NDD incidence has been 
previously debated. This investigation seeks to delineate the association 
between PA and NDDs across various levels of adherence to a plant-based diet.
METHODS: In this study, a cohort of 368,934 participants from the UK Biobank was 
analyzed. Total physical activity (TPA) levels and healthful plant-based diet 
index (hPDI) were calculated and categorized. A multiple adjusted Cox model was 
utilized to evaluate the influence of TPA and hPDI on common NDDs, respectively.
RESULTS: Finally, 4602 identified cases diagnosed as Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
Parkinson's disease (PD) or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We found that 
higher TPA was significantly associated with a reduced risk of developing AD 
(Q3: HR 0.87; Q4: HR 0.78) and PD (Q3: HR 0.86; Q4: HR 0.81). The protective 
effect was further accentuated with adherence to a plant-based diet. However, 
these connections were not observed in the analysis of ALS regardless of dietary 
patterns.
CONCLUSION: Our findings underscore a significant association between higher TPA 
and reduced risks of AD and PD, with an enhanced effect observed in conjunction 
with a plant-based diet. This study contributes to addressing the knowledge gap 
regarding the combined impact of TPA and a plant-based diet on NDDs occurrence, 
providing insights into potential underlying mechanisms.

This study integrates bioinformatics and computer-aided drug discovery to assess 
suillin's therapeutic potential, particularly its interaction with 
acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Alzheimer's disease presents profound challenges, 
necessitating effective treatments to mitigate cognitive decline and improve 
patients' quality of life. Although current medications offer symptomatic 
relief, they often entail adverse effects and do not address the underlying 
disease progression. Natural sources, such as macrofungi mushrooms, hold promise 
for novel drug discovery due to their bioactive compounds' diverse therapeutic 
properties. Suillin, derived from Suillus luteus mushrooms, shows promise as a 
mixed-type AChE inhibitor, crucial for maintaining acetylcholine levels in 
neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease. Computational docking 
studies reveal suillin's distinctive interactions with AChE, suggesting 
potential modulation of enzyme function through various bonding mechanisms. The 
Molinspiration drug-likeness score further supports suillin's efficacy, 
indicating its suitability for enzyme inhibition. By combining computational and 
bioinformatics approaches, this study elucidates suillin's molecular 
interactions and underscores its potential as a therapeutic agent.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a brain illness that causes gradual memory loss. AD 
has no treatment and cannot be cured, so early detection is critical. Various AD 
diagnosis approaches are used in this regard, but Magnetic Resonance Imaging 
(MRI) provides the most helpful neuroimaging tool for detecting AD. In this 
paper, we employ a DenseNet-201 based transfer learning technique for diagnosing 
different Alzheimer's stages as Non-Demented (ND), Moderate Demented (MOD), Mild 
Demented (MD), Very Mild Demented (VMD), and Severe Demented (SD). The suggested 
method for a dataset of MRI scans for Alzheimer's disease is divided into five 
classes. Data augmentation methods were used to expand the size of the dataset 
and increase DenseNet-201's accuracy. It was found that the proposed strategy 
provides a very high classification accuracy. This practical and reliable model 
delivers a success rate of 98.24%. The findings of the experiments demonstrate 
that the suggested deep learning approach is more accurate and performs well 
compared to existing techniques and state-of-the-art methods.

Donepezil (DPZ), a piperidine-based reversible cholinesterase inhibitor, finds 
extensive use in treating Alzheimer's disease (AD). Originally designed as an 
oral formulation, DPZ encounters drawbacks such as a brief duration of action 
and reduced treatment effectiveness in elderly patients with memory impairment 
or difficulty swallowing medications. To address these issues and improve 
patient compliance, researchers are actively exploring alternative DPZ 
formulations. Consequently, reliable methods are necessary to quantitate DPZ in 
biological samples for in vivo assessment. Therefore, we propose an efficient, 
sensitive, wide-dynamic, and cost-effective method for quantitating DPZ in rat 
plasma. Our method employs liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) followed by liquid 
chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry, enabling in vivo evaluation of 
novel DPZ formulations. Notably, our method requires only 20 μL of rat plasma 
and employs icopezil as the internal standard-a cost-effective compound with 
chemical similarity to DPZ. We meticulously optimized LLE conditions, taking 
into account factor interactions through design of experiments (DOE). Our rapid 
and straightforward extraction and purification involved using 500 μL of pure 
methyl tert-butyl ether to extract DPZ from the sample within five minutes. The 
dynamic range of the method extends from 0.5 ng/mL to 1,000 ng/mL, demonstrating 
excellent sensitivity and suitability for pharmacokinetic studies across diverse 
DPZ formulations. Following the FDA guidelines, we rigorously validated the 
developed method, evaluating selectivity, linearity (with a coefficient of 
determination ≥0.9999), accuracy (ranging from 96.0% to 109.6%), precision 
(≤13.9%), matrix effect (92.2% to 103.8%), recovery (98.5% to 106.8%), the lower 
limit of quantitation (0.5 ng/mL), and stability. Finally, we effectively 
employed the validated method for the long-term pharmacokinetic assessment of a 
DPZ formulation. We expect that this approach will make a substantial 
contribution to the advancement of new DPZ formulations, ultimately benefiting 
individuals afflicted by AD.

BACKGROUND: Prior investigations have elucidated pathophysiological interactions 
involving blood coagulation and neurodegenerative diseases. These interactions 
pertain to age-related effects and a mild platelet antiaggregant function of 
exogenous α-Synuclein.
OBJECTIVE: Our study sought to explore whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels 
of tissue factor (TF), the initiator of the extrinsic pathway of hemostasis, 
differ between controls (CON) compared to patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) 
and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), considering that these conditions represent 
a spectrum of α-Synuclein pathology. We further investigated whether TF levels 
are associated with longitudinal progression in PD.
METHODS: We examined CSF levels of TF in 479 PD patients, 67 patients diagnosed 
with DLB, and 16 CON in order to evaluate potential continuum patterns among 
DLB, PD, and CON. Of the 479 PD patients, 96 carried a GBA1 variant (PD GBA1), 
while the 383 non-carriers were classified as PD wildtype (PD WT). We considered 
both longitudinal clinical data as well as CSF measurements of common 
neurodegenerative markers (amyloid-β 1-42, h-Tau, p-Tau, NfL, α-Synuclein). 
Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox regression analysis stratified by TF tertile 
levels was conducted.
RESULTS: Higher CSF levels of TF were associated with an older age at 
examination in PD and a significant later onset of postural instability in PD 
GBA1. TF levels were lower in male vs. female PD. DLB GBA1 exhibited the lowest 
TF levels, followed by PD GBA1, with CON showing the highest levels.
CONCLUSIONS: TF as representative of blood hemostasis could be an interesting 
CSF candidate to further explore in PD and DLB.

Plain Language Summary: Parkinson’s disease is a common age-related condition, 
primarily affecting older individuals. However, it shows a wide range of 
symptoms and clinical courses, influenced by genetic mutations, 
neuroinflammatory processes and lifestyle factors. Research into the disease’s 
mechanisms is important for developing new therapies that could potentially slow 
its progression. Early diagnosis is also essential, as new disease-modifying 
therapies are most effective when started at an early stage of the disease. In 
this paper, we focus on a protein called tissue factor, which plays a role in 
both blood coagulation and neuroinflammation. Proteins involved in 
blood-coagulation also exhibit an increase in blood-concentration with higher 
age. Also, a subtle platelet antiaggregant function of exogenous α-Synuclein was 
found, a protein which aggregates in the brain of patients with Parkinson’s 
disease. Additionally, higher tissue factor levels were found in plaques of 
proteins (amyloid-β 1-42) found in Alzheimer’s disease. Thus, tissue factor 
could be a promising biomarker candidate for neurodegenerative diseases. We 
analyzed the concentration of this protein in the cerebrospinal fluid of 479 
patients with Parkinson’s disease, 16 control participants, and 67 patients with 
dementia with Lewy bodies, a sub-type of Parkinson’s disease with exceptionally 
high levels of α-Synuclein in the brain. Our findings showed the lowest levels 
of tissue factor in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies, followed by those 
with typical Parkinson’s disease, and the highest levels in controls. 
Additionally, older patients had higher tissue factor levels than younger 
patients, and levels were lower in male patients compared to female patients. 
Thus, measuring tissue factor levels could help in diagnosing Parkinson’s 
disease. Further studies, especially with larger control groups, are needed to 
confirm these results. Additionally, exploring the connections between blood 
coagulation and Parkinson’s disease could improve our understanding of the 
disease’s mechanisms, potentially leading to new pharmaceutical developments.

Biomarkers that accurately identify mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are of 
greater importance for Alzheimer's disease (AD) management and treatment. On the 
other hand, blood-based biomarkers are not only more practical but also less 
invasive than the common cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers. In their report in the 
Journal of Alzheimer's Disease, Wang and collaborators identified 67 upregulated 
and 220 downregulated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). They further demonstrated 
that 4 of these lncRNAs could discriminate MCI from cognitively healthy 
individuals. Apart from their significance as potential biomarkers for MCI 
diagnosis, these lncRNAs can offer additional information on the cellular 
mechanisms of AD pathology.

BACKGROUND: Sigma-1 receptors are highly expressed in brain areas related to 
cognitive function and are a promising target for anti-amnesic treatments. We 
previously showed that activation of sigma-1 receptors by the selective agonist 
compound 
methyl(1 R,2 S/1 S,2 R)-2-[4-hydroxy-4-phenylpiperidin-1-yl)methyl]-1-(4-methylphenyl) 
cyclopropane carboxylate [(±)-PPCC] promotes a remarkable recovery in rat models 
of memory loss associated to cholinergic dysfunction.
OBJECTIVE: In this study, we sought to assess the role of (±)-PPCC on working 
memory deficits caused by noradrenergic depletion.
METHODS: Animals with a mild or severe working memory deficits associated to 
varying degrees of noradrenergic neuronal depletion were treated with the 
sigma-1 agonist just prior to the beginning of each behavioral testing session.
RESULTS: While (±)-PPCC alone at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day failed to affect working 
memory in lesioned animals, its association with the α2 adrenergic receptor 
agonist clonidine, completely blocked noradrenaline release, significantly 
improving rat performance. This effect, distinct from noradrenaline activity, is 
likely to result from a direct action of the (±)-PPCC compound onto sigma-1 
receptors, as pre-treatment with the selective sigma-1 receptor antagonist 
BD-1047 reversed the improved working memory performance. Despite such clear 
functional effects, the treatment did not affect noradrenergic neuron survival 
or terminal fiber proliferation.
CONCLUSIONS: Future studies are thus necessary to address the effects of 
long-lasting (±)-PPCC treatment, with or without clonidine, on cognitive 
abilities and Alzheimer's disease-like histopathology. Considering the already 
established involvement of sigma-1 receptors in endogenous cell plasticity 
mechanisms, their activation by selective agonist compounds holds promises as 
possibly positive contributor to disease-modifying events in neurodegenerative 
diseases.

BACKGROUND: Post-diagnostic care for people with vascular cognitive impairment 
(VCI) typically involves multiple professions and disjointed care pathways not 
specifically designed to aid VCI needs.
OBJECTIVE: Exploring perspectives of healthcare professionals on post-diagnostic 
care for people with VCI.
METHODS: We conducted a qualitative focus group study. We used purposive 
sampling to include healthcare professionals in different compositions of 
primary and secondary care professionals per focus group. Thematic saturation 
was reached after seven focus groups. Transcripts were iteratively coded and 
analyzed using inductive thematic analysis.
RESULTS: Forty participants were included in seven focus groups (4-8 
participants). Results showed knowledge and awareness of VCI as prerequisites 
for adequate post-diagnostic care, and for pre-diagnostic detection of people 
with VCI (theme 1). In light of perceived lack of differentiation between 
cognitive disorders, participants shared specific advice regarding 
post-diagnostic care for people with VCI and informal caregivers (theme 2). 
Participants thought current care for VCI was fragmented and recommended further 
integration of care and collaboration across settings (theme 3).
CONCLUSIONS: People with VCI and their caregivers risk getting stuck in a "no 
man's land" between post-diagnostic care pathways; challenges lie in 
acknowledgement of VCI and associated symptoms, and alignment between healthcare 
professionals. Education about the symptoms and consequences of VCI, to 
healthcare professionals, people with VCI and caregivers, may increase awareness 
of VCI and thereby better target care. Specific attention for symptoms common in 
VCI could further tailor care and reduce caregiver burden. Integration could be 
enhanced by combining expertise of dementia and stroke/rehabilitation pathways.

The increase in the incidence of dementia over the last century correlates 
strongly with the increases in post-reproductive lifespan during this time. As 
post-reproductive lifespan continues to increase it is likely that the incidence 
of dementia will also increase unless therapies are developed to prevent, slow 
or cure dementia. A growing body of evidence implicates age-related endocrine 
dyscrasia and the length of time that the brain is subjected to this endocrine 
dyscrasia, as a key causal event leading to the cognitive decline associated 
with aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD), the major form of dementia in our 
society. In particular, the elevations in circulating gonadotropins, resulting 
from the loss of gonadal sex hormone production with menopause and andropause, 
appear central to the development of AD neuropathology and cognitive decline. 
This is supported by numerous cell biology, preclinical animal, and 
epidemiological studies, as well as human clinical studies where suppression of 
circulating luteinizing hormone and/or follicle-stimulating hormone with either 
gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues, or via physiological hormone 
replacement therapy, has been demonstrated to halt or significantly slow 
cognitive decline in those with AD. This review provides an overview of past and 
present studies demonstrating the importance of hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal 
hormone balance for normal cognitive functioning, and how targeting age-related 
endocrine dyscrasia with hormone rebalancing strategies provides an alternative 
treatment route for those with AD.

Small Molecule Decoy of Amyloid-β Aggregation Blocks Activation of 
Microglia-Like Cells.

BACKGROUND: Aggregated forms of the amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides which form 
protofibrils and fibrils in the brain are signatures of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). Aggregates are also recognized by microglia, which in early phases may be 
protective and in later phases contribute to the pathology. We have identified 
several small molecules, decoys which interfere with Aβ oligomerization and 
induce other aggregation trajectories leading to aggregated macrostructures 
which are non-toxic.
OBJECTIVE: This study investigates whether the small-molecule decoys affect 
microglial activation in terms of cytokine secretion and phagocytosis of Aβ 
peptide.
METHODS: The effects of the decoys (NSC 69318, NSC 100873, NSC 16224) were 
analyzed in a model of human THP-1 monocytes differentiated to microglia-like 
cells. The cells were activated by Aβ40 and Aβ42 peptides, respectively, and 
after treatment with each decoy the secreted levels of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines and the Aβ phagocytosis were analyzed.
RESULTS: NSC16224, which generates a double-stranded aggregate of thin 
protofibrils, was found to block Aβ40- and Aβ42-induced increase in microglial 
secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. NSC 69318, selective for neurotoxicity 
of Aβ42, and NSC 100873 did not significantly reduce the microglial activation 
in terms of cytokine secretion. The uptake of Aβ42 was not affected by anyone of 
the decoys.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings open the possibility that the molecular decoys of Aβ 
aggregation may block microglial activation by Aβ40 and Aβ42 in addition to 
blocking neurotoxicity as shown previously.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The impact of dietary habits on cognitive function is 
increasingly gaining attention. The review is to discuss how caloric restriction 
(CR) and intermittent fasting (IF) can enhance cognitive function in healthy 
states through multiple pathways that interact with one another. Secondly, to 
explore the effects of CR and IF on cognitive function in conditions of 
neurodegenerative diseases, obesity diabetes and aging, as well as potential 
synergistic effects in combination with exercise to prevent cognitively related 
neurodegenerative diseases.
RECENT FINDINGS: With age, the human brain ages and develops corresponding 
neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and 
epilepsy, which in turn trigger cognitive impairment. Recent research indicates 
that the impact of diet and exercise on cognitive function is increasingly 
gaining attention. The benefits of exercise for cognitive function and brain 
plasticity are numerous, and future research can examine the efficacy of 
particular dietary regimens during physical activity when combined with diet 
which can prevent cognitive decline.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia among the elderly 
population, posing a significant public health challenge due to limited 
therapeutic options that merely delay cognitive decline. AD is associated with 
impaired energy metabolism and reduced neurotrophic signaling. The insulin-like 
growth factor (IGF) signaling pathway, crucial for central nervous system (CNS) 
development, metabolism, repair, cognition, and emotion regulation, includes 
IGF-1, IGF-2, IGF-1R, IGF-2R, insulin receptor (IR), and six insulin-like growth 
factor binding proteins (IGFBPs). Research has identified abnormalities in IGF 
signaling in individuals with AD and AD models. Dysregulated expression of IGFs, 
receptors, IGFBPs, and disruptions in downstream phosphoinositide 
3-kinase-protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 
pathways collectively increase AD susceptibility. Studies suggest modulating the 
IGF pathway may ameliorate AD pathology and cognitive decline. This review 
explores the CNS pathophysiology of IGF signaling in AD progression and assesses 
the potential of targeting the IGF system as a novel therapeutic strategy. 
Further research is essential to elucidate how aberrant IGF signaling 
contributes to AD development, understand underlying molecular mechanisms, and 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of IGF-based treatments.

Here we highlight the Alzheimer's Association's role since its inception, as a 
strategic collaborator with National Institutes of Health-National Institute on 
Aging in the development of the modern era of the Alzheimer's Movement and in 
making Alzheimer's disease (AD) a national priority in the United States by 
developing several initiatives to advance knowledge about the cause, diagnosis, 
and treatment of dementia. Among these collaborative undertakings, the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is an exemplary case, 
launched with groundwork by the Neuroimaging Working Group sponsored by the 
Association's Ronald and Nancy Reagan Research Institute on AD. The unique 
contribution of the Association to the development of ADNI includes 
participation as a member of ADNI's Private Partner Scientific Board and 
involvement in developing an AD biomarker standardization and validation 
subproject, which has led to a conceptual shift in the field to define AD based 
on its underlying biology. Furthermore, the creation of Worldwide ADNI (WW-ADNI) 
is highlighted, underscoring the global impact of these efforts. HIGHLIGHTS: The 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is a keystone undertaking in 
the evolving landscape of Alzheimer's disease (AD) research, and is now in its 
fourth iteration. The Alzheimer's Association has partnered with ADNI since its 
inception. ADNI 4 and the Association continue to collaborate, ensuring 
representation within the study population.

To search for novel anti-Alzheimer agents, multifunctional Fe3O4-based 
nanoparticles (FSSIO) is designed and prepared which contain ferulic acid (FA) 
and Simvastatin linked to the surface of Fe3O4 particles. In vitro tests 
confirmed that FSSIO possessed favorable biocompatibility and a pronounced 
ability to penetrate blood brain barrier. The FA moiety endowed the particles 
with remarkable antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, and effectively 
protected neuron cells from the toxicity induced by Aβ. Moreover, the 
Simvastatin pharmacophore assists the particles up-regulate the expression level 
of BDNF and significantly promotes the expression levels of p-TrkB, p-ERK, 
p-PI3K and Akt, which consequently leads to the neurite outgrowth via regulating 
PI3K/ATK and TrkB-mediated signaling pathway. More importantly, in the Morris 
water maze test, FSSIO shows excellent activity to enhance the learning and 
memory retention of AD model rats.

INTRODUCTION: Cardiovascular health is important for brain aging, yet its role 
in the clinical manifestation of autosomal dominant or atypical forms of 
dementia has not been fully elucidated. We examined relationships between Life's 
Simple 7 (LS7) and clinical trajectories in individuals with autosomal dominant 
frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD).
METHODS: Two hundred forty-seven adults carrying FTLD pathogenic genetic 
variants (53% asymptomatic) and 189 non-carrier controls completed baseline LS7, 
and longitudinal neuroimaging and neuropsychological testing.
RESULTS: Among variant carriers, higher baseline LS7 is associated with slower 
accumulation of frontal white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), as well as slower 
memory and language declines. Higher baseline LS7 associated with larger 
baseline frontotemporal volume, but not frontotemporal volume trajectories.
DISCUSSION: Better baseline cardiovascular health related to slower cognitive 
decline and accumulation of frontal WMHs in autosomal dominant FTLD. Optimizing 
cardiovascular health may be an important modifiable approach to bolster 
cognitive health and brain integrity in FTLD.
HIGHLIGHTS: Better cardiovascular health associates with slower cognitive 
decline in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Lifestyle relates to the 
accumulation of frontal white matter hyperintensities in FTLD. More optimal 
cardiovascular health associates with greater baseline frontotemporal lobe 
volume. Optimized cardiovascular health relates to more favorable outcomes in 
genetic dementia.

Biological and clinical heterogeneity is a major challenge in research for 
developing new treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD may be defined by its 
amyloid beta and tau pathologies, but we recognize that mixed pathologies are 
common, and that diverse genetics, central nervous system (CNS) and systemic 
pathophysiological processes, and environmental/experiential factors contribute 
to AD's diverse clinical and neuropathological features. All these factors are 
rational targets for therapeutic development; indeed, there are hundreds of 
candidate pharmacological, dietary, neurostimulation, and lifestyle 
interventions that show benefits in homogeneous laboratory models. Conventional 
clinical trial designs accommodate heterogeneity poorly, and this may be one 
reason that progress in translating candidate interventions has been so 
difficult. We review the challenges of AD's heterogeneity for the clinical 
trials enterprise. We then discuss how advances in repeatable biomarkers and 
digital phenotyping enable novel "single-case" and adaptive trial designs to 
accelerate therapeutics development, moving us closer to personalized research 
and medicine for AD. HIGHLIGHTS: Alzheimer's disease is diverse in its clinical 
features, course, risks, and biology. Typical randomized controlled trials are 
exclusive and necessarily large to attain arm comparability with broad outcomes. 
Repeated blood biomarkers and digital tracking can improve outcome measure 
precision and sensitivity. This enables the use of novel "single-case" and 
adaptive trial designs for inclusivity, rigor, and efficiency.

Parkinsonism in rats induced by the pesticide rotenone is one of the most 
adequate models of Parkinson's disease (PD). Isatin (indole-2,3-dione) is an 
endogenous regulator found in mammals and humans and exhibiting a wide range of 
biological activities mediated by numerous isatin-binding proteins, including 
those associated with neurodegenerative pathology. A course of rotenone 
administration to rats caused behavioral impairments and changes in the profile 
and relative content of isatin-binding proteins in the brain. In this study, we 
have investigated the delayed neuroprotective effect of isatin (5 days after 
completion of the course of rotenone administration) on behavioral reactions and 
the relative content of isatin-binding proteins in the brain of rats with 
rotenone-induced experimental parkinsonism. Although during this period the rats 
retained locomotor dysfunction, the proteomic analysis data (profile of 
isatin-binding proteins in the brain and changes in their relative content) 
differed from the results obtained immediately after completion of the course of 
rotenone administration. Moreover, all isatin-binding proteins with altered 
relative content changed during this period are associated to varying degrees 
with neurodegeneration (many with Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases).

Calcineurin inhibition prevents synaptic plasticity deficit induced by 
brain-derived tau oligomers.

Compelling evidence suggests that cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease is 
associated with the accumulation and aggregation of tau protein, with the most 
toxic aggregates being in the form of oligomers. This underscores the necessity 
for direct isolation and analysis of brain-derived tau oligomers from patients 
with Alzheimer's disease, potentially offering novel perspectives into tau 
toxicity. Alzheimer's brain-derived tau oligomers are potent inhibitors of 
synaptic plasticity; however, the involved mechanism is still not fully 
understood. We previously reported a significantly reduced incidence of 
Alzheimer's disease in ageing humans chronically treated with a Food and Drug 
Administration-approved calcineurin inhibitor, FK506 (tacrolimus), used as an 
immunosuppressant after solid organ transplant. Using a combination of 
electrophysiological and RNA-sequencing techniques, we provide here evidence 
that FK506 has the potential to block the acute toxic effect of brain-derived 
tau oligomers on synaptic plasticity, as well as to restore the levels of some 
key synaptic mRNAs. These results further support FK506 as a promising novel 
therapeutic strategy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease represents a substantial and escalating public 
health threat across Africa. Alzheimer's disease leads to substantial cognitive 
impairment and memory loss, placing a heavy burden on the affected individuals 
and their families, friends, and caregivers. It affects 2.67 million people in 
Africa, the majority of whom live in sub-Saharan Africa. The prevalence of this 
disease is expected to rise drastically to approximately 150 million individuals 
worldwide by 2050, as estimated by the WHO.
AIM: This paper offers an integrative profile of Alzheimer's disease in Africa, 
spanning known genetic and modifiable risks, discusses the existing challenges 
in diagnosis and treatment, projections on prevalence and disability-adjusted 
life year burden through 2050, and priority policy responses needed to rebalance 
the equation.
METHODS: This paper examines available literature to summarize current knowledge 
on risk factors, diagnosis, treatments, and burden of Alzheimer's disease in 
Africa. Gather epidemiological assessments, clinical guidelines, and commentary 
related to Alzheimer's disease in Africa.
RESULTS: The data reveals concerning realities regarding Alzheimer's disease 
diagnosis and care in Africa. Diagnostic infrastructure shortcomings, resource 
limitations, and knowledge gaps emerge as recurring barriers. Positron emission 
tomography scans, cerebrospinal fluid assays, and other mainstay detection 
modalities common in developed countries show restricted availability.
CONCLUSION: Addressing Africa's Alzheimer's disease crisis demands a 
multipronged strategy to uplift diagnostic capacities, treatment availability, 
specialist training, public awareness, and coordinated policymaking. 
Prioritizing biomarkers and imaging to confirm early neurodegeneration is 
foundational, alongside drug access expansion.

Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) in mammals, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
Parkinson's disease (PD), and transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), 
are characterized by the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the central 
nervous system (CNS). Despite the presence of these pathogenic proteins, the 
immune response in affected individuals remains notably muted. Traditional 
immunological strategies, particularly those reliant on monoclonal antibodies 
(mAbs), face challenges related to tissue penetration, blood-brain barrier (BBB) 
crossing, and maintaining protein stability. This has led to a burgeoning 
interest in alternative immunotherapeutic avenues. Notably, single-domain 
antibodies (or nanobodies) and aptamers have emerged as promising candidates, as 
their reduced size facilitates high affinity antigen binding and they exhibit 
superior biophysical stability compared to mAbs. Aptamers, synthetic molecules 
generated from DNA or RNA ligands, present both rapid production times and 
cost-effective solutions. Both nanobodies and aptamers exhibit inherent 
qualities suitable for ND research and therapeutic development. Cross-seeding 
events must be considered in both traditional and small-molecule-based 
immunodiagnostic and therapeutic approaches, as well as subsequent neurotoxic 
impacts and complications beyond protein aggregates. This review delineates the 
challenges traditional immunological methods pose in ND research and underscores 
the potential of nanobodies and aptamers in advancing next-generation ND 
diagnostics and therapeutics.

The formation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques is a neuropathological hallmark of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), however, these pathological aggregates can also be 
found in the brains of cognitively unimpaired elderly population. In that 
context, individual variations in the Aβ-specific immune response could be key 
factors that determine the level of Aβ-induced neuroinflammation and thus the 
propensity to develop AD. CD4+ T cells are the cornerstone of the immune 
response that coordinate the effector functions of both adaptive and innate 
immunity. However, despite intensive research efforts, the precise role of these 
cells during AD pathogenesis is still not fully elucidated. Both pathogenic and 
beneficial effects have been observed in various animal models of AD, as well as 
in humans with AD. Although this functional duality of CD4+ T cells in AD can be 
simply attributed to the vast phenotype heterogeneity of this cell lineage, 
disease stage-specific effect have also been proposed. Therefore, in this 
review, we summarized the current understanding of the role of CD4+ T cells in 
the pathophysiology of AD, from the aspect of their antigen specificity, 
activation, and phenotype characteristics. Such knowledge is of practical 
importance as it paves the way for immunomodulation as a therapeutic option for 
AD treatment, given that currently available therapies have not yielded 
satisfactory results.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) stands as the predominant contributor to dementia 
cases. The ongoing developments in our understanding of its pathogenesis have 
sparked the interest of researchers, driving them to explore innovative 
treatment approaches. Existing therapies incorporating cholinesterase inhibitors 
and/or NMDA antagonists have shown limited improvement in alleviating symptoms. 
This, in turn, highlights the urgency for the pursuit of more effective 
therapeutic options. Given the annual rise in the number of individuals affected 
by dementia, it is imperative to allocate resources and efforts towards the 
exploration of novel therapeutic options. This review aims to provide a 
comprehensive overview of the AD-related hypotheses, along with the 
computational approaches employed in research within each hypothesis. In this 
comprehensive review, the authors shed light on using various computational 
tools, including diverse case studies, in the pursuit of finding efficacious 
treatments for AD. The development of more sophisticated diagnostic techniques 
is crucial, enabling early detection and intervention in the battle against this 
challenging condition. The potential treatments investigated in this analysis 
are poised to assume ever more significant functions in both preventing and 
treating AD, ultimately enhancing the management of the condition and the 
overall well-being of individuals affected by AD.

AIMS: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with limited 
treatment options. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects of 
Ginkgo biloba leaf extract (GBE) on AD and explore its potential mechanisms of 
action.
METHODS: Key chemical components of GBE, including quercetin, luteolin, and 
kaempferol, were identified using network pharmacology methods. Bioinformatics 
analysis revealed their potential roles in AD through modulation of the 
PI3K/AKT/NF-κB signaling pathway.
RESULTS: Mouse experiments demonstrated that GBE improved cognitive function, 
enhanced neuronal morphology, and reduced serum inflammatory factors. 
Additionally, GBE modulated the expression of relevant proteins and mRNA.
CONCLUSION: GBE shows promise as a potential treatment for AD. Its beneficial 
effects on cognitive function, neuronal morphology, and inflammation may be 
attributed to its modulation of the PI3K/AKT/NF-κB signaling pathway. These 
findings provide experimental evidence for the application of Ginkgo biloba leaf 
in AD treatment and highlight its potential mechanisms of action.
