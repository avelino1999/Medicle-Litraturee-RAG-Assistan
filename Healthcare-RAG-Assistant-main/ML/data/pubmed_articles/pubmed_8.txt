Objective. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a promising 
neuromodulation therapy for treating diseases such as depression and Alzheimer's 
disease. However, its efficacy depends on precise magnetic field targeting. 
Current measurement methods face a trade-off between accuracy and complexity. 
Their intricate designs limit miniaturization, and they are typically confined 
to one-dimensional detection.Approach. This study proposes a miniaturized 
printed circuit board (PCB)-integrated coil array (11.10 mm × 9.10 mm × 1.60 mm) 
as a novel solution to replace complex probe systems for the synchronous 
measurement of three-dimensional magnetic field components (Bx,By,Bz) generated 
by a figure-8 coil.Results. Using this approach, we simulated and measured the 
magnetic field distribution produced by a self-made figure-8 coil, demonstrating 
consistency with relative errors below 5%, 10%, and 15% along the line of 
interest (LOI) in thex,y,zdirections, respectively. Variations in magnetic flux 
density from a commercial figure-8 coil were also measured at two specific 
spatial positions, showing consistent trends.Significance. The presented 
measurement probe enables feasible characterization of TMS-induced magnetic 
flux, with measured values aligning closely with simulated results. By 
integrating orthogonal coils into a compact PCB, it overcomes the traditional 
accuracy-complexity trade-off. Clinically, it assists in precise coil 
positioning during treatment, reducing off-target side effects via magnetic 
field validation. Technologically, its compact and cost-effective design 
accelerates testing of novel TMS coils, advancing the development of efficient 
neuromodulation devices.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is common in adults while 
myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD) is rare. 
Our previous machine-learning algorithm, using clinical variables, ≤6 brain 
lesions, and no Dawson fingers, achieved 79% accuracy, 78% sensitivity, and 80% 
specificity in distinguishing MOGAD from MS but lacked validation. The aim of 
this study was to (1) evaluate the clinical/MRI algorithm for distinguishing MS 
from MOGAD, (2) develop a deep learning (DL) model, (3) assess the benefit of 
combining both, and (4) identify key differentiators using probability attention 
maps (PAMs).
METHODS: This multicenter, retrospective, cross-sectional MAGNIMS study included 
scans from 19 centers. Inclusion criteria were as follows: adults with non-acute 
MS and MOGAD, with high-quality T2-fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and 
T1-weighted scans. Brain scans were scored by 2 readers to assess the 
performance of the clinical/MRI algorithm on the validation data set. A DL-based 
classifier using a ResNet-10 convolutional neural network was developed and 
tested on an independent validation data set. PAMs were generated by averaging 
correctly classified attention maps from both groups, identifying key 
differentiating regions.
RESULTS: We included 406 MRI scans (218 with relapsing remitting MS [RRMS], mean 
age: 39 years ±11, 69% F; 188 with MOGAD, age: 41 years ±14, 61% F), split into 
2 data sets: a training/testing set (n = 265: 150 with RRMS, age: 39 years ±10, 
72% F; 115 with MOGAD, age: 42 years ±13, 61% F) and an independent validation 
set (n = 141: 68 with RRMS, age: 40 years ±14, 65% F; 73 with MOGAD, age: 40 
years ±15, 63% F). The clinical/MRI algorithm predicted RRMS over MOGAD with 75% 
accuracy (95% CI 67-82), 96% sensitivity (95% CI 88-99), and specificity 56% 
(95% CI 44-68) in the validation cohort. The DL model achieved 77% accuracy (95% 
CI 64-89), 73% sensitivity (95% CI 57-89), and 83% specificity (95% CI 65-96) in 
the training/testing cohort, and 70% accuracy (95% CI 63-77), 67% sensitivity 
(95% CI 55-79), and 73% specificity (95% CI 61-83) in the validation cohort 
without retraining. When combined, the classifiers reached 86% accuracy (95% CI 
81-92), 84% sensitivity (95% CI 75-92), and 89% specificity (95% CI 81-96). PAMs 
identified key region volumes: corpus callosum (1872 mm3), left precentral gyrus 
(341 mm3), right thalamus (193 mm3), and right cingulate cortex (186 mm3) for 
identifying RRMS and brainstem (629 mm3), hippocampus (234 mm3), and 
parahippocampal gyrus (147 mm3) for identifying MOGAD.
DISCUSSION: Both classifiers effectively distinguished RRMS from MOGAD. The 
clinical/MRI model showed higher sensitivity while the DL model offered higher 
specificity, suggesting complementary roles. Their combination improved 
diagnostic accuracy, and PAMs revealed distinct damage patterns. Future 
prospective studies should validate these models in diverse, real-world 
settings.
CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class III evidence that both a 
clinical/MRI algorithm and an MRI-based DL model accurately distinguish RRMS 
from MOGAD.

Neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, 
Huntington's Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis pose 
significant challenges for treatment. Reasons for the difficulty in finding 
cures for these conditions include complications in early diagnosis, progressive 
and irreversible neuronal damage, and the presence of the blood-brain barrier 
(BBB), which hinders the delivery of drugs to the affected areas of the brain. 
Intranasal (INL) drug administration has increasingly gained popularity among 
researchers for targeting neurological conditions, because of its ability to 
bypass the BBB. However, chronic INL administration leads to nasal mucosa 
irritation. Additionally, rapid mucociliary clearance, a lack of targeted drug 
delivery, increased enzymatic degradation, and tight junctions that obstruct 
drug transport limit the clinical applicability of the INL route. To overcome 
these challenges, a unique region in the rodent nose, known as the Grueneberg 
Ganglion (GG), can be considered to be a novel site for INL drug administration. 
GG is a small structure housed under the snout cartilage of the nasal septum, 
approximately 1.5 mm from the nasal opening in mice. It is directly connected to 
the main olfactory bulb through axons. This Perspective aims to expand knowledge 
on why GG may be a viable option for INL delivery to combat neurological 
conditions. For better understanding, we have explained the INL administration 
in GG, using Alzheimer's Disease and INL insulin therapy as a role model for the 
current review.

Tauopathies encompass a large majority of dementia diagnoses and are 
characterized by toxic neuronal or glial inclusions of the 
microtubule-associated protein tau. Tau has a high propensity to induce 
prion-like spreading throughout the brain via a variety of mechanisms, making 
tauopathy a rapid and lethal form of neurodegeneration that currently lacks an 
effective therapy or cure. Tau aggregation and neuronal loss associated with 
this pathology are accompanied by robust neuroinflammation. Innate immune 
responses-particularly those involving microglial activation, altered lipid 
metabolism, and type I interferon signaling-have emerged as key drivers of tau 
hyperphosphorylation and aggregation. Recent advances also point to a 
significant role for the adaptive immune system in shaping tauopathy 
progression. This review examines the current understanding of innate immunity 
in tauopathies and highlights emerging evidence linking T cell responses to 
tauopathy progression. Last, we conclude with a discussion of potential ways in 
which the immune system can be harnessed to treat tauopathy.

INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused 
unprecedented disruptions to healthcare systems worldwide, significantly 
affecting patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). In this study, we 
evaluated the impact of the pandemic on healthcare-seeking behavior and CKD 
progression among patients in New York City.
METHODS: Using electronic health records from PCORnet's INSIGHT Clinical 
Research Network, we conducted a retrospective cohort study focused on 84,062 
patients with CKD aged 50 years or older with multiple chronic conditions seen 
between 2017 and 2022. Patients were identified using pre-pandemic CKD 
diagnostic codes, and confirmed by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 
measurements. Care disruption was defined as receiving fewer visits than 
recommended by Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines. We 
used linear mixed-effects models to estimate annual eGFR changes and analyze 
trends in care visits stratified by CKD stage and care disruption.
RESULTS: The study cohort had a mean age of 75.8 years, 43.2% were male, and 
mean pre-pandemic eGFR was 51.1 mL/min/1.73 m2. Care visits declined sharply in 
2020 across patients at all but the end stage, with incomplete recovery by 2022. 
Patients with adequate pre-pandemic care maintained their visits above KDIGO 
levels, while those with inadequate care increased visits during the pandemic. 
Pronounced eGFR decline occurred in 2020 (10.6%), with slower declines observed 
thereafter.
CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted CKD care, potentially leading to 
reduced healthcare-seeking behavior and accelerated kidney function decline in 
2020. Slower decline post-2020 may reflect improved healthcare utilization, 
better medication adherence, and new therapies, and other factors.

Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is hindered by the high cost, 
complexity, and centralization of current diagnostic platforms such as 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and single-molecule array (SIMOA). 
Here, an integrated point-of-care (PoC) biosensing platform is reported based on 
redox-active polyphenol red molecularly imprinted polymers (pPhR MIPs) deposited 
on highly porous gold (HPG) electrodes for the ultrasensitive, reagent-free 
detection of phosphorylated tau 181 (p-tau 181) in undiluted plasma and serum. 
The unique electrochemical interface combines the signal-enhancing properties of 
HPG with the redox functionality of pPhR, eliminating the need for external 
redox probes. The resulting sensor achieves a limit of detection (LOD) of 
980 fg mL-1 and sensitivity of 4.39 µA/(pg mL-1), rivalling high-end lab-based 
assays while operating at a fraction of the cost. The platform integrates a 
low-cost, handheld potentiostat and a machine learning (ML)-enabled web app for 
real-time data classification and regression, achieving 100% classification 
accuracy with zero false positives or negatives. The system demonstrates 
compatibility with both ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and 
heparin-treated samples and maintains accuracy in complex matrices. This work 
represents a step toward World Health Organization (WHO)-compliant, 
decentralized diagnostics for neurodegenerative disease, offering a scalable 
foundation for future multianalyte platforms targeting AD and related disorders.

BACKGROUND: Dementia insurance, a private insurance product covering the first 
diagnosis of dementia of the insured, may be beneficial for asymptomatic 
individuals who recognize their own high genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the cost-benefit of dementia insurance in 
cognitively unimpaired individuals, stratified by APOE ε4 genotype.
METHODS: A simulation study using 18 years of longitudinal data from National 
Alzheimer's Coordinating Center study to simulate the income and expenses of 
dementia insurance from the insured's perspective. Cognitively unimpaired 
participants at baseline (approximately n = 9000) were included, and the loss 
ratio (= total benefits gained / total premium paid) was calculated by APOE ε4 
subgroup, applying the premium rates of actual insurance products in Japan.
RESULTS: For individuals aged 60 or older with ≥ 10-year follow-up, the 
estimated loss ratio was highest in APOE ε4 homozygotes. However, even for this 
group, the 95% confidence interval for the loss ratio was either below or 
included 1.0, indicating no clear financial gain. Their loss ratio was 
approximately 3 to 4 times higher than for ε4-negative individuals, and 2 times 
higher than for ε4-heterozygotes.
CONCLUSIONS: Dementia insurance may be relatively more cost-beneficial for 
asymptomatic ε4-homozygotes in their 60 s or older compared to other genotypes 
over policy periods of 10 years or longer. However, it does not represent a 
clear financial gain for the insured, highlighting the need for careful 
consideration. Our study provides an important basis for further investigating 
the advantages and limitations of dementia insurance for individuals with 
high-risk gene.

Anticholinergic burden (ACB) and polypharmacy are poorly studied in the context 
of primary care in Brazil.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the ACB and polypharmacy of individuals with suspected 
dementia referred from primary care to tertiary dementia outpatient clinics in 
Brazil.
METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study in two tertiary dementia clinics. 
We included individuals with suspected dementia referred from primary care. 
Sociodemographic variables, number of drugs, ACB score, disease duration, Mini 
Mental State Examination (MMSE) were collected in the first evaluation. Final 
diagnosis received was also collected.
RESULTS: A total of 921 individuals were included, with a median (IQR) age of 72 
[64-78] years, 57.8% (532) women, 4 [2-7] years of formal education and 15 
[10-20] points in MMSE. Most patients had a final diagnosis of dementia (66%, 
616) and Alzheimer's disease (21.4%, 197), psychiatric disorders (16%, 147) and 
multifactorial dementia (14.8%, 136) were the most common diagnoses. Most 
individuals (68.1%, 627) were using at least one medication with anticholinergic 
effect, and in 44.6% (411) there was polypharmacy. ACB total score correlated 
with MMSE (rho=-0.13) and with total number of medications (rho=0.52). In 
multivariate regression, ACB score ≥1 was associated with MMSE and polypharmacy.
CONCLUSION: Most individuals referred from primary care in Brazil were using at 
least one medication with anticholinergic effect and this was correlated with 
cognitive severity. Educational measures for primary care physicians, focusing 
on the management of pharmacological treatment, are essential to reduce the 
anticholinergic load in this context.

Publisher: A carga anticolinérgica (CAC) e a polifarmácia são pouco estudadas no 
contexto da atenção primária no Brasil.
OBJETIVO: Avaliar a CAC e a polifarmácia de indivíduos com suspeita de demência 
encaminhados da atenção primária para clínicas ambulatoriais de demência 
terciárias no Brasil.
MÉTODOS: Foi realizado um estudo transversal em dois ambulatórios terciários de 
demência. Foram incluídos indivíduos com suspeita de demência encaminhados da 
atenção primária. Variáveis ​​sociodemográficas, número de medicamentos, escore 
CAC, duração da doença, Mini Exame do Estado Mental (MEEM) foram coletadas na 
primeira avaliação. O diagnóstico final recebido também foi registrado.
RESULTADOS: Um total de 921 indivíduos foram incluídos, com idade mediana (IIQ) 
de 72 [64–78] anos, 57,8% (532) mulheres, 4 [2–7] anos de educação formal e 15 
[10–20] pontos no MEEM. A maioria dos pacientes recebeu diagnóstico final de 
demência (66%, 616), sendo a doença de Alzheimer (21,4%, 197), transtornos 
psiquiátricos (16%, 147) e demência multifatorial (14,8%, 136) os diagnósticos 
mais comuns. A maior parte dos indivíduos (68,1%, 627) utilizava ao menos um 
medicamento com efeito anticolinérgico, e em 44,6% (411) foi observada 
polifarmácia. O escore total da CAC correlacionou-se com o MMSE (rho=- 0,13) e 
com o número total de medicamentos (rho=0,52). Na regressão multivariada, o 
escore CAC≥1 esteve associado ao MMSE e à polifarmácia.
CONCLUSÃO: A maioria dos indivíduos encaminhados da atenção primária no Brasil 
utilizava ao menos um medicamento com efeito anticolinérgico, e esse uso esteve 
correlacionado com a gravidade cognitiva. Medidas educativas voltadas a médicos 
de atenção primária, com foco no gerenciamento do tratamento farmacológico, são 
essenciais para reduzir a carga anticolinérgica nesse contexto.

Neurogenetics investigates the genetic basis of neurological disorders. It 
encompasses conditions ranging from neurodegenerative diseases with 
predominantly polygenic risk genes, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, to 
monogenic diseases and repeated expansion disorders within movement and 
neuromuscular disorders, such as Friedreich ataxia and muscular dystrophies. 
Significant advances in recent years that have revolutionized our understanding 
of disease mechanisms and paved the way for personalized medicine approaches are 
due to the field of neurogenetics, with its intricate relationship both with 
clinical and genetic research. Therefore, all neurologists, even in 
resource-limited settings, are aware of the critical genetic basis; standard 
molecular diagnostic techniques such as next-generation sequencing, whole exome, 
and whole genome sequencing; and possible therapeutic modalities of their field. 
This review will also touch on elements of the neurogenetic clinic in tertiary 
care, ethical considerations, and insight into ongoing research that would help 
improve patient care and enhance clinical outcomes.

of Hawai'i at Mānoa.

Health care workers with specialized knowledge and skills to work with people 
living with symptoms of dementia are needed in all sectors of the health care 
industry in Hawai'i as the number of people in the population diagnosed with 
Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) is expected to increase along 
with the overall number of older adults (ages 65+). This article provides a 
scoping review of relevant population data that suggest an urgency to address 
this need even as the state contends with an overall shortage of workers 
throughout the public health and health care industry. The authors then provide 
practical solutions, recommending a multi-pronged approach to introduce or 
enhance dementia-care competencies at various levels of education - from high 
school to graduate or professional studies - and through continuing education 
and professional development programs for practicing health professionals. 
Consistent with the public health philosophy of health equity, the authors 
propose that providing quality care to persons living with dementia is a social 
justice goal that can be achieved through this multi-pronged approach.

INTRODUCTION: Donanemab is an immunoglobulin G1 antibody that targets an 
N-terminal truncated form of amyloid beta present in mature plaques. 
Treatment-emergent (TE) anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) were quantified in 
donanemab-treated participants from two pivotal clinical trials, and effects of 
TE ADAs on donanemab pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety were assessed.
METHODS: Data were pooled from the phase 2 TRAILBLAZER-ALZ (NCT03367403) and 
phase 3 TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 trials (NCT04437511). Eligible participants were 
randomized 1:1 to donanemab (700 mg for the first three doses, 1400 mg 
thereafter) or placebo intravenously every 4 weeks up to 72 weeks. TE 
ADA-evaluable participants had a non-missing baseline ADA result and ≥ 1 
non-missing post-baseline ADA result. TE ADA incidence and effect of titer on 
pharmacokinetics, amyloid plaque reduction, clinical efficacy (measured by 
change from baseline of integrated Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale [iADRS] 
score and Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes [CDR-SB]), and safety were 
assessed.
RESULTS: Of 922 TE ADA-evaluable donanemab-treated participants, 56 (6.1%) had 
ADAs detected at baseline, and 812 (88.1%) were TE ADA positive. Donanemab 
clearance increased linearly with logarithm of ADA titer; however, titer did not 
affect maximum donanemab concentration. Amyloid plaque level was significantly 
reduced with donanemab versus placebo, irrespective of titer (P < 0.001 for 
all). No association was found between ADA presence or titer and donanemab 
efficacy by iADRS or CDR-SB. Eighty-four of 984 (8.5%) donanemab-treated 
participants and 4 of 999 (0.4%) placebo-treated participants reported 
infusion-related reactions (IRRs). All donanemab-treated participants reporting 
immediate IRRs developed ADAs at some point during the study; however, 90.5% of 
TE ADA-positive participants did not experience IRRs.
DISCUSSION: Most participants were TE ADA positive. TE ADAs increased donanemab 
clearance but did not have clinically meaningful impact on plaque reduction or 
efficacy. While all participants reporting IRRs developed ADAs at some point 
during the study, the majority of participants with ADAs did not experience 
IRRs.
HIGHLIGHTS: In pivotal trials, most donanemab-treated participants were 
treatment-emergent anti-drug antibody (TE ADA) positive.TE ADAs increased 
donanemab clearance but did not impact plaque reduction/efficacy.All 
participants reporting infusion-related reactions (IRRs) developed ADAs at some 
point during the study.However, the majority of participants with ADAs did not 
experience IRRs.

AIM: This review provides a systematic evaluation of 94 stem cell clinical 
trials to treat neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, 
Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington's disease.
METHODS: Data were collected from using relevant search terms, focusing 
exclusively on stem cell therapy. Of the 8000+ participants in these trials, 
nearly 70% were enrolled in AD-related studies. Only three Phase 3 studies were 
conducted, and most trials were in the early phases (Phases 1 and 2). 
Mesenchymal stem cells, neural stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, and 
embryonic stem cells are used the most to treat neurodegenerative diseases. This 
review also explores the emerging fields of preclinical and clinical 
investigations of stem cell-derived exosome-based therapies for 
neurodegenerative diseases.
RESULTS: Exosomes can cross the blood-brain barrier to deliver therapeutic 
molecules directly to the brain, offering a less invasive alternative to stem 
cell transplantation. Mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes, in particular, 
have demonstrated significant potential in preclinical models by reducing 
neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and promoting neuronal regeneration. 
Additionally, recent advances in exosome engineering, including surface 
modifications, therapeutic agent loading, and transgenic modifications, have 
improved targeting, stability, blood-brain barrier delivery, and neural cell 
interactions, enabling targeted and effective treatment. Exosome-based therapies 
are in the preliminary phases of clinical investigation, with only three 
clinical trials.
CONCLUSION: Given the increasing interest in exosome therapy, clinical 
investigations are expected to increase. This growth will be driven by ongoing 
advancements in exosome technology, a deeper understanding of their therapeutic 
potential, and escalating demand for innovative treatment strategies for 
neurodegenerative diseases.

In this study, the pharmacodynamic components and potential pharmacological 
functions of Danzhi Xiaoyao Formula in treating nervous system diseases were 
investigated by hippocampal component characterization and network pharmacology. 
After rats were administrated with Danzhi Xiaoyao Formula by gavage, high 
performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight tandem 
mass spectrometry(HPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS) was employed to explore the components in 
the hippocampus of rats. Fifty-seven components were identified in the 
hippocampus of rats by comparing the extract of Danzhi Xiaoyao Formula, herbal 
components in the hippocampus after administration, and blank samples. KEGG and 
GO analyses predicted 74 core targets including GSK3B, MAPK1, AKT, IL6. These 
targets were involved in PI3K/Akt, NF-κB, MAPK, JAK/STAT, Wnt, and other 
signaling pathways. The results indicated that Danzhi Xiaoyao Formula may 
ameliorate other nervous system diseases enriched in DO, such as 
neurodegenerative diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, and mental and emotional 
disorders by mediating target pathways, inhibiting inflammation, reducing 
neuronal damage, and alleviating hippocampal atrophy. The relevant activities 
exhibited by this formula in nervous system diseases such as Alzheimer's 
disease, Parkinson's disease, and diabetic neuropathy have extremely high 
development value and are worthy of further in-depth research. This study 
provides a theoretical basis and practical guidance for expanding the 
application of Danzhi Xiaoyao Formula in the treatment of nervous system 
diseases.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of caffeoylquinic acids from 
Erigeron breviscapus(EBCQA) on cognitive impairment and mitochondrial 
dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease(AD), and to explore its underlying 
mechanisms. The impacts of EBCQA on paralysis, β-amyloid(Aβ) oligomerization, 
and mRNA expression of mitophagy-related genes [PTEN-induced putative kinase 
1(PINK1) homolog-encoding gene pink-1, Parkin homolog-encoding gene pdr-1, Bcl-2 
interacting coiled-coil protein 1(Beclin 1) homolog-encoding gene bec-1, 
microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3(LC3) homolog-encoding gene lgg-1, 
autophagic adapter protein 62(p62) homolog-encoding gene sqst-1] were examined 
in the AD Caenorhabditis elegans CL4176 model, along with mitochondrial 
functions including adenosine triphosphate(ATP) content, enzyme activities of 
mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes Ⅰ,Ⅲ, and Ⅳ, and mitochondrial membrane 
potential. Additionally, the effects of EBCQA on the green fluorescent 
protein(GFP)/red fluorescent protein from Discosoma sp.(DsRed) ratio, the 
expression of phosphatidylethanolamine-modified and GFP-labeled 
LGG-1(PE-GFP::LGG-1)/GFP-labeled LGG-1(GFP::LGG-1), and GFP-labeled 
SQST-1(GFP::SQST-1) proteins were investigated in transgenic C. elegans strains. 
The effect of EBCQA on paralysis was further evaluated after RNA 
interference(RNAi)-mediated suppression of the pink-1 and pdr-1 genes in CL4176 
strain. An AD rat model was established through intraperitoneal injection of 
D-galactose and intragastric administration of aluminum trichloride. The effects 
of β-nicotinamide mononucleotide(NMN) and EBCQA on learning and memory ability, 
neuronal morphology, mitophagy occurrence, mitophagy-related protein 
expression(PINK1, Parkin, Beclin 1, LC3-Ⅱ/LC3-Ⅰ, p62), and mitochondrial 
functions(ATP content; enzyme activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain 
complexes Ⅰ, Ⅲ, and Ⅳ; mitochondrial membrane potential) were investigated in 
this AD rat model. The results showed that EBCQA delayed paralysis onset in the 
CL4176 strain, reduced Aβ oligomer formation, and upregulated the mRNA 
expression levels of lgg-1, bec-1, pink-1, and pdr-1, while downregulating 
sqst-1 mRNA expression. EBCQA also enhanced ATP content, mitochondrial membrane 
potential, and the activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes Ⅰ, Ⅲ, 
and Ⅳ. Furthermore, EBCQA improved the PE-GFP::LGG-1/GFP::LGG-1 ratio, reduced 
GFP::SQST-1 expression, and decreased the GFP/DsRed ratio. Notably, the ability 
of EBCQA to delay paralysis was significantly reduced following RNAi-mediated 
suppression of pink-1 and pdr-1 in CL4176 strain. In AD rats, the administration 
of NMN or EBCQA significantly improved learning and memory, restored neuronal 
morphology in the hippocampus, increased autophagosome numbers, and upregulated 
the expression of PINK1, Parkin, Beclin 1, and the LC3-Ⅱ/LC3-Ⅰ ratio, while 
reducing p62 expression. Additionally, the treatment with NMN or EBCQA both 
elevated ATP content, mitochondrial respiratory chain complex Ⅰ, Ⅲ, and Ⅳ 
activities, and mitochondrial membrane potential in the hippocampus. The above 
findings indicate that EBCQA improves cognitive impairment and mitochondrial 
dysfunction in AD, possibly through activation of PINK1/Parkin-mediated 
mitophagy.

Semaglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, is FDA-approved for managing type 2 
diabetes (T2D) and reducing cardiovascular risk. Its off-label use in weight 
management and other conditions has grown, prompting a review of its benefits 
and risks. This review evaluates evidence on semaglutide's effects, highlighting 
its therapeutic potential beyond approved indications. Studies from 2021-2024 
were reviewed via PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar. Semaglutide showed 
promise in managing PCOS-related obesity, insulin resistance, and demonstrated 
renoprotective effects in diabetics and chronic kidney disease (CKD). 
Additionally, it improves liver enzyme levels, steatosis, and stiffness, aiding 
in managing Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis in 
non-fibrotic patients. The FDA has approved it for reducing major adverse 
cardiovascular events, heart failure symptoms, and physical limitations in 
diabetic and non-diabetics. Preclinical studies suggest benefits in cognitive 
disorders associated with insulin resistance, including Alzheimer's disease, 
Parkinson's disease, and vascular dementia in animals. Although rare cases of 
thyroid cancer have been reported, no causal relationship has been established, 
emphasizing the need of caution in high-risk populations. GLP-1 therapy has also 
exerted protective effects against the risk of various types of cancer. However, 
ongoing human studies are essential to validate these findings and clarify 
semaglutide's association with cancer.

Plain Language Summary: Semaglutide is a medicine that helps people with type 2 
diabetes and can also lower the risk of heart problems. It might also help 
people with PCOS by making insulin work better and helping them lose weight. It 
may also protect the kidneys and make the liver healthier.Doctors use 
semaglutide to help people with heart problems even if they do not have 
diabetes. In some studies with animals, it has also helped with memory and 
thinking problems like in Alzheimer’s disease.There is no proof that semaglutide 
causes thyroid cancer, but doctors are careful with people at high risk. It 
might even lower cancer risk in people with diabetes but more research is 
needed. Scientists are still studying its safety and long-term effects.

Voltage-dependent anion channel 1 is an integral outer membrane protein of the 
mitochondria that governs apoptosis, enables metabolite exchange, and influences 
mitochondrial activity. In neurodegenerative diseases, such as amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and Alzheimer's 
disease, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction are 
frequent features. Voltage-dependent anion channel 1 is a key regulator of these 
processes. This review described the structure, membrane topology, and 
physiological function of voltage-dependent anion channel 1 in neurons and glial 
cells. We emphasize how it affects mitophagy, oxidative damage, and changes in 
mitochondrial permeability. Special attention is focused on how 
voltage-dependent anion channel 1 interacts with pathogenic proteins that damage 
mitochondrial integrity and cause neurotoxicity, including mutant huntingtin, 
phosphorylated tau, α-synuclein, amyloid-beta, and TAR DNA-binding protein 43. 
Furthermore, the paper examines the function of voltage-dependent anion channel 
1 in astrocytic dysfunction and microglial activation, highlighting its impact 
on neuroinflammation. In a nutshell, we assess treatment strategies that target 
voltage-dependent anion channel 1, such as VBIT-4, a selective inhibitor of 
voltage-dependent anion channel 1 oligomerization, and newer methods, including 
structure-based drug design and CRISPR/Cas9 regulation. Improved knowledge of 
the hinter voltage-dependent anion channel 1 of the molecular mechanism may 
allow for new therapeutic approaches in neurodegenerative diseases.

Alterations in RNA methylation may affect the initiation and development of 
Alzheimer's disease. However, the exact nature of the relationship between RNA 
methylation and Alzheimer's disease remains unclear. In this study, RNA 
methylation levels were analyzed by bulk transcriptomic and single-cell RNA 
sequencing. The expression levels of RNA methylation regulators were confirmed 
using molecular biology techniques. Co-expression network analysis was used to 
identify relevant long non-coding RNAs. Molecular subtypes related to RNA 
methylation were classified, and variations in clinical characteristics, 
biological behavior, and immune signatures between subtypes were assessed. 
Machine learning approaches were applied to identify methylation-associated long 
noncoding RNAs, which were used to construct a risk model and nomogram for 
Alzheimer's disease. Potential therapeutic agents for different risk groups were 
predicted, and in vitro experiments were conducted to identify key RNA 
methylation events. Single-cell analysis demonstrated enhanced RNA methylation 
in patients with Alzheimer's disease, particularly within T cells, B cells, and 
NK cells. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and 
western blot confirmed alterations in RNA methylation regulators in neurons 
treated with amyloid-β oligomers in vitro . This evidence supported the 
classification of patients with Alzheimer's disease into heterogeneous subtypes. 
Specifically, subtype 1 was identified as the immune-active subtype, while 
subtype 2 was characterized by a metabolic phenotype. Machine learning 
algorithms identified five significant methylation-associated long non-coding 
RNAs -LINC01007, MAP4K3-DT, MIR302CHG, VAC14-AS1, and TGFB2-OT1-that accurately 
predict clinical outcomes for patients with Alzheimer's disease. These patients 
were classified into low- and high-risk categories; the latter group displayed 
higher immune infiltration, upregulated immune regulatory gene expression, and 
elevated immune scores and responded better to treatment with 
arachidonic-trifluoroethane. These findings suggest that dysregulated RNA 
methylation alters the immune microenvironment in Alzheimer's disease and is 
closely associated with its progression. This phenomenon provides novel insights 
into potential therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's disease that target RNA 
methylation.

Neurodegenerative diseases are a class of disorders with the gradual loss of the 
central nervous system and peripheral nervous system. Neurodegenerative diseases 
manifest primarily as cognitive and behavioral disorders that adversely affect 
the lives of millions of people worldwide. Therefore, it is necessary to 
elucidate the mechanism of neurodegenerative diseases further and find effective 
new therapies. In recent years, increasing evidence has shown that the immune 
system plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative 
diseases and regulates this process. The central and peripheral immune systems 
exert different roles in the disease progression. The development of 
neurodegenerative diseases is influenced by interactions between them. This 
review focuses on how the immune system, including microglia mediated 
nucleotide-binding oligomerization domainlike receptor protein 3 inflammation 
activation and T cell-mediated neuroinflammation, interactions with 
neurodegenerative diseases by modulating protein aggregation and blood-brain 
barrier permeability. Besides, we gave particular attention to glial 
cell-centered multicellular interactions and the inflammatory signaling pathway. 
Insight into the immune system's functions and cellular interactions is 
essential for progressing disease research. In addition, the functions and 
mechanisms of these immune cells also suggest new ideas and targets for 
treatment. Therefore, this review summarizes some of the existing treatment 
strategies for amyloid-beta, tau, neuroinflammation, α-synuclein, associated 
microbiota, immune modulation, and neural injury repair. In addition, this 
review summarizes and compares animal models of different common 
neurodegenerative diseases and clinical research progress. In view of the 
current research status, new research directions and suggestions are proposed.

Bidirectional communication between the gut microbiota and the central nervous 
system.

In recent years, an increasing number of researchers have become interested in 
the bidirectional communication between the gut microbiota and the central 
nervous system. This communication occurs through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. 
As people age, the composition of the gut microbiota undergoes considerable 
changes, which are now known to play an important role in the development of 
many neurodegenerative diseases. This review aims to investigate the complex 
bidirectional signaling pathways between the gut and the brain. It summarizes 
the latest research findings on how the gut microbiota and its metabolites play 
critical roles in regulating inflammation, maintaining gut health, and 
influencing the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's 
disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The review also 
analyzes the current clinical applications of gut microbiota-based treatments 
for neurological disorders, including fecal microbiota transplantation, 
probiotics, and prebiotics. Many studies show that the gut microbiota affects 
the brain in several ways. For example, it can produce substances such as 
short-chain fatty acids and activate inflammatory pathways. Studies involving 
animals and laboratory models have demonstrated that adjusting the gut 
microbiota can help improve behavior and reduce neurological problems. Recent 
metagenomic and metabolomics studies have shown that the microbiota plays a 
crucial role in maintaining the organism's health. Microorganisms primarily 
colonize the gut and are involved in host nutrient metabolism, maintaining the 
structural integrity of the intestine, preserving the intestinal mucosal 
barrier, and modulating the immune system. The gut microbiota communicates with 
the brain through a bidirectional microbiota-gut-brain axis. The composition of 
the gut flora changes considerably with age, and ecological dysregulation has 
been recognized as one of the twelve most recent hallmarks of aging. Recent 
studies have linked these changes to a variety of age-related neurological 
disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 
Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and Huntington's disease. Specifically, 
the gut microbiota influences the brain through the production of key 
metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids and the activation of inflammatory 
and other relevant signaling pathways. In preclinical studies, targeted 
modulation of the gut microbiota, through methods such as fecal microbiota 
transplantation, probiotics, and prebiotics, has demonstrated potential in 
improving host behavioral outcomes. Therefore, gut microbiotabased treatments 
offer new hope for the treatment of nervous system diseases. However, due to the 
complexity of the gut microbiota and the potential adverse reactions associated 
with these therapies, researchers need to carefully assess their safety and 
efficacy before widespread clinical application.

Ferroptosis is a newly recognized form of programmed cell death characterized by 
iron overload-dependent lipid peroxidation. These pathological phenomena are 
often observed in neurodegenerative diseases. Aging is an irreversible process 
characterized by the deterioration of tissue and cell function. It has been 
shown to contribute to neurodegenerative diseases and increase susceptibility to 
ferroptosis. Therefore, ferroptosis may be involved in the progression of 
neurodegenerative diseases as a pathogenic factor, and aging is the common 
catalyst of both processes. The purpose of this review is to elucidate the 
latest progress on the mechanisms related to ferroptosis in neurodegenerative 
diseases, including iron overload, lipid peroxidation, antioxidant defense, cell 
membrane repair, and the regulation of autophagy and transcription factors. We 
also explored the relationship between ferroptosis and aging and reported that 
aging can induce ferroptosis by increasing iron overload, enhancing lipid 
peroxidation, and exacerbating autophagy disorders. Since ferroptosis is a 
pathogenic factor in neurodegenerative diseases, we screened gene bank databases 
and found that many genes associated with ferroptosis and neurodegenerative 
diseases overlap. Additionally, genes related to both the peroxidation pathway 
and ferroptosis are enriched. Ferroptosis occurs under conditions of age-related 
iron accumulation and lipid enrichment, as well as due to disorders in autophagy 
levels and transcription factors. Furthermore, in various neurodegenerative 
diseases, specific pathological changes or products can also contribute to the 
occurrence of ferroptosis. Finally, based on animal studies and clinical trials 
involving ferroptosis inhibitors, physical therapies, stem cell treatments, and 
exosome therapies in neurodegenerative diseases, it has been found that 
inhibiting ferroptosis can effectively reverse neurological dysfunction and 
cognitive impairment associated with these conditions. However, given various 
limitations, the conclusions of some animal studies and clinical trials have not 
been ideal, indicating that further large-scale research is necessary. Taken 
together, ferroptosis induces aging-related neurodegenerative diseases and 
neuronal cell death, triggering disease onset and progression. Ferroptosis 
inhibitors, physical therapies, stem cell treatments, and exosome therapies show 
great potential for inhibiting ferroptosis in neurodegenerative disease.

Neurodegenerative disorders are typically caused by harmful protein accumulation 
and nerve cell damage. A post-translational modification called O-linked 
N-acetylglucosamine ylation acts as a critical regulator in these disorders by 
controlling protein behavior, cell signaling, and energy balance. This 
modification is dynamically balanced through the cooperative actions of O-linked 
N-acetylglucosamine transferase and O-GlcNAcase. In healthy brains, 
O-GlcNAcylation supports nerve cell function and survival, but its imbalance 
contributes to disease progression. Notably, the effects of O-GlcNAcylation 
differ across disorders. This review reveals how O-GlcNAcylation bridges 
molecular mechanisms to neurodegeneration, as well as the prospects of targeted 
O-linked N-acetylglucosamine acylation therapy for neurodegenerative diseases. 
In Alzheimer's disease, it blocks toxic changes in key proteins like tau and 
amyloid-beta. In Parkinson's disease, it reduces the clumping of 
alpha-synuclein, yet may disrupt dopamine production. In amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis, it protects nerve fiber transport systems. Additionally, 
O-GlcNAcylation plays an indispensable part in other neurodegenerative 
conditions, including Huntington's disease, aging, Machado-Joseph disease, 
multiple sclerosis, and giant axonal neuropathy. New therapies targeting this 
mechanism include glucosamine supplements and O-GlcNAcase inhibitors, which show 
clinical promise but face translational challenges.

Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common dementing disorder, affecting 55 
million people worldwide. Brain MRI plays an integral role in the diagnostic 
evaluation of patients with cognitive symptoms. When interpreting brain MRI for 
cognitive impairment, radiologists should assess the following four key 
features: (1) white matter ischemic burden, (2) structural changes to suggest 
normal pressure hydrocephalus, (3) locoregional pattern of brain atrophy, and 
(4) presence of microhemorrhage or superficial siderosis, particularly for 
determining eligibility for anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody (MAB) treatment 
when appropriate. The recent approval and clinical adoption of anti-amyloid MAB 
expanded the role of neuroradiologists in evaluating eligibility and monitoring 
ARIA (amyloid-related imaging abnormality) among patients receiving anti-amyloid 
MAB. This advancement underscores the importance of standardized imaging 
protocols and effective communication between neuroradiologists and cognitive 
neurologists. Depending on the severity of ARIA and patients' symptoms, 
treatment may need to be suspended or discontinued. This review article explores 
brain MRI and FDG-PET/CT imaging abnormalities in patients with major cognitive 
and movement disorders associated with dementia. It aims to assist radiologists 
in providing differential diagnoses within a clinical context. Finally, the 
article emphasizes the importance of recognizing co-pathologies, since patients 
may have more than one neurodegenerative disease rather than viewing these 
neurodegenerative diseases as being mutually exclusive. KEY POINTS: Question 
Traditional regional patterns of brain atrophy on MRI by neuroradiologists may 
not be effective given the recent advances in understanding of neurodegenerative 
disease and recognition of co-pathologies. Findings The locoregional atrophy and 
the patterns of metabolic abnormality help in the differential diagnosis of 
neurodegenerative disease. Remember that brain MRI determines eligibility for 
anti-amyloid immunotherapy. Clinical relevance Understanding clinical history is 
vital for interpreting brain MRI for patients with cognitive impairment or 
memory loss. Newly recognized entities such as limbic-predominant age-related 
TDP43 encephalopathy (LATE) can mimic Alzheimer disease among extremely elderly 
patients with amnestic symptoms with mesial temporal lobe atrophy.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) substantially improves motor symptoms and quality 
of life in people with movement disorders such as Parkinson disease and 
dystonia, and it is also being explored as a treatment option for other brain 
disorders, including treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder, 
Alzheimer disease and depression. Two major developments are currently driving 
progress in DBS research: first, the framework of adaptive DBS, which senses 
brain activity to infer the momentary state of the symptoms of a patient and 
reacts by adapting stimulation settings, and second, the concept of connectomic 
DBS, which identifies brain circuits that should optimally be stimulated to 
reduce specific symptoms. In this Perspective, we propose a unified framework 
that combines these two concepts. Our approach, termed adaptive circuit 
targeting, decodes symptom severity from brain signals and adaptively activates 
the most relevant symptom-response circuits. We discuss the state of the art in 
the adaptive and connectomic DBS fields and the research gaps that need to be 
addressed to unify these concepts.

Cellular senescence and associated endothelial permeability are crucial factors 
in the dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in neurodegenerative 
diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nesfatin-1 (NF-1), a neuropeptide 
involved in regulating appetite and energy homeostasis, has not been extensively 
studied for its pathophysiological role in AD. In this study, we found that NF-1 
treatment improved cellular senescence in brain vascular endothelial bEnd.3 
cells by restoring the expression of hTERT and TERF2 against oligomerized 
Aβ1-42. Additionally, NF-1 reduced p53 and p21 protein levels in bEnd.3 cells 
exposed to oligomerized Aβ1-42. Notably, NF-1 reduced oligomerized 
Aβ1-42-induced endothelial monolayer permeability by maintaining 
transendothelial electric resistance (TEER) and the levels of tight junction 
proteins claudin 5 and ZO-1. Furthermore, NF-1 suppressed the expression of 
VEGF-R1 but not VEGF-R2 in bEnd.3 cells exposed to oligomerized Aβ1-42. 
Overexpression of VEGF-R1 negated the protective effects of NF-1 against 
oligomerized Aβ1-42-induced cellular senescence and increased endothelial 
monolayer permeability, indicating the involvement of VEGF-R1 in this process. 
Using a transgenic (Tg APPswe/PSEN1dE9) AD mouse model, we demonstrated that 
NF-1 administration lowered VEGF-R1 expression in the brain cortex of AD mice. 
Moreover, NF-1 mitigated BBB dysfunction and enhanced the expression of claudin 
5 and ZO-1 in the brains of AD mice. Our results suggest that NF-1 may be a 
potential therapeutic strategy for treating AD.

Addressing modifiable dementia risk factors requires reliable risk assessment 
methods. We aimed to synthesise knowledge on risk scores for all cause dementia, 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia, classify them according to 
target population, evaluate their content, cost, appropriateness of validation 
studies, and suitability for implementing risk reduction guidelines. A 
systematic search was conducted of PubMed, Cochrane Collaboration, ProQuest, 
Scopus, Embase, and PsycINFO databases using a pre-registered protocol. Data on 
risk factors, target population, predictive validity, cost, and alignment with 
WHO guidelines were extracted. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed. Of 45 
risk scores identified, 29 were for all-cause dementia, including 11 based on 
late-life cohorts, 6 on midlife, and 7 covering mid to late-life. The pooled 
C-statistic across development and validation studies of dementia risk scores 
was 0.69 (95 % CI: 0.67, 0.71). Development study AUCs were higher than 
validation study AUCs and dropped from 0.74 to 0.66 for risk scores developed 
for clinical samples and from 0.79 to 0.71 for AD specific scores (which include 
functional indicators non-independent of disease). There were no validated risk 
scores for vascular dementia. Dem-NCD, CogDrisk, ANU-ADRI and LIBRA risk scores 
incorporated most WHO-recommended risk factors and demonstrated accuracy 
comparable to the overall pooled C-statistic. We conclude that across the field, 
there are methodological limitations relating to validation, and inappropriate 
comparison of tools designed for different purposes or target populations. 
However, there are now several validated, risk scores for all-cause dementia and 
AD that assess modifiable factors and offer cost-effective dementia risk 
assessment and risk reduction advice.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by cognitive decline and memory impairment. The lack of effective 
therapeutic strategies underscores the urgent need for disease-modifying 
therapies. Baicalein (Bai), a natural compound, exhibits multi-target properties 
and diverse pharmacological activities, positioning it as a promising candidate. 
However, its therapeutic potential in AD is limited by low bioavailability and 
inadequate brain accumulation. To overcome these challenges, we developed 
mesenchymal stem cell membrane-functionalized vesicles for targeted Bai delivery 
(MSC-Bai-Lipo). Using Box-Behnken response surface methodology, we optimized 
preparation parameters to achieve high encapsulation efficiency. In AD model 
mice, MSC-Bai-Lipo demonstrated targeted delivery to lesions, exhibiting 
superior therapeutic effects by mitigating AD-associated neuronal damage and 
neuroinflammatory processes.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, poses 
significant therapeutic challenges due to its complex etiology and limited 
treatment options. Traditional pharmacotherapies targeting amyloid-β (Aβ) and 
cholinergic pathways offer modest benefits and are often associated with adverse 
effects. Emerging evidence implicates gut dysbiosis and the gut-brain axis in 
the pathogenesis and progression of AD. This review explores the multifactorial 
pathophysiology of AD and evaluates the therapeutic potential of gut-based 
interventions such as probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, metabiotics, 
postbiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in mitigating disease 
pathology. Emphasis has also been given on role of miRNA released from FMT in 
management of AD. Preclinical and clinical studies demonstrate that these 
strategies can restore microbial homeostasis, reduce neuroinflammation, enhance 
gut barrier integrity, and improve cognitive outcomes. The regulatory aspects 
with use of probiotics based products and FMT is also highlighted. The 
modulation of neuroimmune, neuroendocrine, and neural pathways through 
microbiota-derived metabolites offers a promising avenue for AD management. 
Despite encouraging findings, further research is needed to address 
interindividual microbiome variability, delivery challenges, and the requirement 
for large-scale, randomized trials. Personalized gut-targeted approaches may 
open new horizons for the prevention and treatment of AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of dementia worldwide, characterized 
by heterogeneous neuropathological changes and progressive cognitive decline. 
Despite the numerous studies, there are still no effective treatments beyond 
those that aim to slow progression and compensate the impairment. Neuroimaging 
techniques provide a comprehensive view of brain changes, with magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) playing a key role due to its non-invasive nature and 
wide availability. The T1-weighted MRI sequence is frequently used due to its 
prevalence in most MRI protocols, generating large datasets, ideal for 
artificial intelligence (AI) applications. AI, particularly machine learning 
(ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques, has been increasingly utilized to model 
these datasets and classify individuals along the AD continuum. This systematic 
review evaluates studies using AI to classify more than two stages of AD based 
on T1-weighted MRI data. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the most 
widely applied, achieving an average classification accuracy of 85.93 % (range: 
51.80-100 %; median: 87.70 %). These good results are due to CNNs' ability to 
extract hierarchical features directly from raw imaging data, reducing the need 
for extensive preprocessing. Non-convolutional neural networks and traditional 
ML approaches also demonstrated strong performance, with mean accuracies of 
82.50 % (range: 57.61-99.38 %; median: 86.67 %) and 84.22 % (range: 33-99.10 %; 
median: 87.75 %), respectively, underscoring importance of input data selection. 
Despite promising outcomes, challenges remain, including methodological 
heterogeneity, overfitting risks, and a reliance on the ADNI database, which 
limits dataset diversity. Addressing these limitations is critical to advancing 
AI's clinical application for early detection, improved classification, and 
enhanced patient outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Neuroinflammation is a pivotal defense mechanism against brain 
infections and injury; the dysregulation contributes to neurodegenerative 
diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease, and multiple 
sclerosis. Ardisia elliptica Thunb. (Primulaceae), known as Ram Yai or 
Pilangkasa in Thai traditional medicine, has been used to treat diarrhea with 
fever. However, the potential of A. elliptica fruit to modulate 
neuroinflammation remains unexplored.
PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the anti-neuroinflammatory properties 
of A. elliptica fruit extracts in activated microglia as well as their 
anti-amyloidogenic effects in vitro.
METHODS: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a potent inflammatory stimulus, was used to 
activate both BV2 microglia, a well-established model of neuroinflammation, and 
RAW264.7 macrophages. In the inflammatory studies, assays including qRT-PCR, 
Western blotting, and phagocytic activity were performed. In the amyloidogenic 
study, thioflavin T and atomic force microscopy assays were conducted.
RESULTS: A. elliptica fruit was extracted using ethanol and water. The extracts 
significantly reduced the mRNA and protein expression of IL-1β, TNF-α, and iNOS 
in LPS-activated BV2 cells and RAW264.7 cells. The 90 % ethanol extract of A. 
elliptica fruit exhibited greater efficacy compared to 50 % ethanol or water 
extracts. In addition, A. elliptica fruit extract significantly decreased the 
phosphorylation of JNK, ERK1/2, p38, and NF-κB, while markedly attenuating 
excessive phagocytic activity by reducing uptake of fluorescent beads and Aβ1-42 
fibrils in LPS-activated BV2 cells. Notably, the extracts inhibited Aβ1-42 
fibril formation and disassembled preformed fibril aggregates. Embelin was 
identified as a major bioactive constituent of the extracts, accounting for part 
of the identified activities.
CONCLUSION: Our study elucidates the mechanisms by which A. elliptica fruit 
extract suppresses inflammation through inhibition of JNK, ERK1/2, p38, and 
NF-kB pathways in LPS-activated microglia. A. elliptica fruit extracts exhibit 
both anti-inflammatory and anti-amyloidogenic activities, suggesting the 
potential as a promising multi-target candidate natural product for 
neuroinflammatory disorders such as AD.

BACKGROUND: Nearly all individuals with Alzheimer disease and related dementias 
(ADRD) experience behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), 
which include symptoms such as agitation, wandering, delusions, and 
hallucinations. Care partners (a person, often a family member, who provides 
care and support to someone with ADRD) struggle to manage BPSD, making symptom 
management a critical focus of intervention research. Our team has developed a 
mobile telehealth intervention (Brain CareNotes) to help care partners manage 
BPSD.
OBJECTIVE: This paper outlines a protocol for a randomized controlled trial of 
160 care partners of patients with ADRD to test the effect of Brain CareNotes on 
care partner burden and patients' BPSD.
METHODS: Participants will be recruited from partner health systems in Indiana, 
United States, by word of mouth, and through community outreach efforts. They 
will be randomly assigned to use either the Brain CareNotes mobile app 
intervention-which helps care partners manage BPSD through the support of a care 
coach, written and visual materials on developing care skills, and BPSD 
measurement and tracking-or an education-only mobile app control for 12 months. 
Data will be collected over the phone at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. 
Primary outcomes assessed for this trial are (1) care partner burden and (2) 
patients' BPSD. Secondary and exploratory outcomes assessed include care partner 
depressive symptoms, patient and care partner acute care use, intervention 
usability and acceptability, and intervention use. The trial will also collect 
patient and care partner demographics and measure care partner self-efficacy, 
care partner social support, patients' ADRD severity, and patients' functional 
abilities.
RESULTS: As of March 2025, we have enrolled 159 participants, and 42 have 
successfully completed the study.
CONCLUSIONS: Brain CareNotes is a unique mobile app intervention to support care 
partners in managing BPSD. Due to the scalability of mobile health 
interventions, if Brain CareNotes is shown to be effective in reducing caregiver 
burden and patients' BPSD, it has the potential for widespread adoption to 
support many ADRD care partners.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VD) are the two most common 
forms of dementia, and they share common mechanisms, especially in regard to 
neurovascular dysfunction. There has been increasing evidence that the 
disruption of the neurovascular unit (NVU), which consists of endothelial cells, 
pericytes, astrocytes, microglia, neurons, and basement membrane, is one of the 
key early events in both AD and VD. The objective of this review is to summarize 
the structure and physiological function of the NVU, then discuss the 
pathological remodeling of the NVU in AD and VD and finally, show emerging 
evidence of multi-target approaches that restore the NVU and neurovascular 
protection. We begin with a description of the structure, and dietary regulatory 
roles of the NVU in cerebral homeostasis, especially related to Aβ, the 
blood-brain barrier (BBB), and neurovascular coupling (NVC). The NVU is then 
related to the pathological events that cause AD and VD, specifically to 
impaired Aβ clearance, inflammatory cascades, oxidative stress, and 
neurovascular uncoupling. Finally, the discussion focuses on a multi-target 
approach involving exercise, estrogen therapy, mesenchymal stem cells/exosomes, 
remote ischemic conditioning (RIC), and mindfulness meditation, and analyzes its 
implications for recovering NVU structure and function. We also discuss the 
concept of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) approaches associated with NVU 
modulation with herbal formulas, traditional Chinese exercises and acupuncture, 
which has integrative pathways for MVU modulation. NVU dysfunction has a 
significant and converging impact on the development of both AD and VD. There is 
considerable support for multi-pathway neurovascular unit targeting, which 
should show a significant delay in cognitive decline. Incorporating multi-modal 
evidence from contemporary and traditional medical systems could offer new 
insights for individualized, neurovascular-targeted therapy for dementia.

BACKGROUND: One of the neuropathologic hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is 
amyloid plaques composed of fibrillar amyloid beta (Aβ) that accumulate in the 
hippocampus and cerebral cortex. The identification of molecular changes and 
interactions associated with Aβ-dependent cerebral amyloidosis is a need in the 
field. We hypothesize that structured datasets linking proteins to 
differentially abundant metabolites may provide an indirect but effective means 
of elucidating the processes and functions in which these metabolites are 
involved. The goal of this study was to identify core network modules related to 
AD-like cerebral amyloidosis to provide new insights into the molecular 
underpinnings of this brain disorder potentially associated with diet and 
microbiota modulation.
METHODS: We performed fecal bacterial genotyping and untargeted metabolomic 
analysis of plasma and feces from wild-type and McGill-R-Thy1-APP transgenic 
(Tg) rats, a model of AD-like cerebral amyloidosis, that were exposed to a 
high-fat diet protocol. To identify relevant proteins associated with the 
discriminant metabolites, we used several structured databases. 
Protein-metabolite associations (both physical and functional) were retrieved, 
and a collection of AD-associated protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks 
were built using a near-neighborhood approach.
RESULTS: A total of 44 bacterial genera and 636 plasma and 576 fecal metabolites 
were analyzed. From the discriminating metabolites of the Sparse Partial Least 
Squares Discriminant Analysis (sPLS-DA) models, 657 networks were collected and 
a subset of the top 20 exploratory networks was defined. The first ranked 
network in terms of seed protein enrichment and number of participating 
metabolites showed strong biological signals of innate and adaptive immunity 
processes, with CD36 emerging as a central hub, orchestrating immunity, 
metabolic pathways, and fatty acid trafficking.
CONCLUSIONS: The network biology approach enabled a precise definition of the 
metabolic pathways underlying the disease biology highlighting the role of 
immune system in the complex interaction of the brain-gut axis.

As viable pharmacotherapies and blood biomarkers emerge for dementia treatment 
and screening, there remains a great need for accurate, sensitive biomarkers of 
cognitive function. We have previously demonstrated that Fastball, a new 
Electroencephalography (EEG) method for the passive and objective measurement of 
recognition memory that requires no behavioural memory response or task 
comprehension, is sensitive to cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease. 
Here we present new evidence that Fastball is sensitive to amnestic dysfunction 
in an earlier stage of the dementia lifecourse, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). 
53 MCI patients and 54 healthy older adult (HOA) controls completed a 3-min 
Fastball task in which they passively viewed rapidly presented images while EEG 
captured their automatic ability to differentiate between images based on 
previous exposure. They also completed neuropsychological assessments of memory 
(Delayed Match to Sample-48), sustained attention (Psychomotor Vigilance Task), 
and general cognitive function (Addenbrookes Cognitive Exam-iii). Participants 
were re-tested after 1 year to establish the test-retest reliability of Fastball 
in HOAs, and the sensitivity of Fastball to cognitive decline in MCI patients, 
over a 1 year period. Amnestic MCI patients showed significantly reduced 
Fastball responses compared with non-amnestic MCI patients (P = 0.001, Cohen's d 
= 0.98) and HOA controls (P = 0.005, Cohen's d = 0.64). Regression analyses 
showed that Fastball EEG responses were selectively predictive of 
neuropsychological measures of recognition memory and not attention. Between 
baseline and year one follow-up Fastball showed moderate to good test-retest 
reliability in HOA controls, and the six MCI-dementia converters showed a trend 
for lower Fastball responses at baseline which will be confirmed with further 
longitudinal assessment. Fastball is further validated as a viable method for 
testing recognition memory in cognitively impaired populations. We have 
demonstrated that it is selectively predictive of memory dysfunction and not 
attention or other cognitive functions. It is passive, non-invasive, quick to 
administer and uses cheap, scalable EEG technology. Fastball is a viable 
functional biomarker that can help to advance cognitive assessment in MCI.

The term "neurodegenerative diseases" (NDDs) refers to a range of 
aging-associated conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, 
and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Unique clinical symptoms and underlying 
pathological mechanisms distinguish each of these illnesses. Although these 
conditions vary, they share chronic neuroinflammation as a defining 
characteristic. Protein aggregation and mitochondrial dysfunction are believed 
to play a role in initiating the neuroinflammatory response and, subsequently, 
the development and course of these illnesses. Apart from providing energy to 
the cells, mitochondria are involved in the immunoinflammatory response 
associated with neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's 
disease, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy. This involvement is attributed to 
controlling processes such as inflammasome activation and cell death. Under 
inflammatory conditions, the underlying regulatory mechanisms for these 
aging-associated disorders may include calcium homeostasis imbalance, 
mitochondrial oxidative stress, mitochondrial dynamics, and epigenetics. Various 
NDDs are linked to neuroinflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction. The linkages 
between these occurrences are becoming more apparent, but the etiology of these 
pathologic lesions is yet to be elucidated. This review examines the role of 
neuroinflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction in the growth and course of 
NDDs, emphasizing the possibility of identifying novel therapeutic targets to 
address aging-related neurodegenerative processes and retard the progression of 
these illnesses.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by cognitive decline, memory impairment, and the accumulation of 
amyloid-β plaques and tau tangles in the brain. Current treatments are 
predominantly symptomatic and do not alter the underlying pathological 
processes, which include amyloid aggregation, tau hyperphosphorylation, synaptic 
dysfunction, and neuroinflammation. Nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems 
have emerged as a promising strategy to address these challenges by facilitating 
the targeted delivery of therapeutics across the blood-brain barrier, enhancing 
drug bioavailability, and minimizing systemic toxicity and immunogenicity 
through biomimetic surface modifications, optimized physicochemical properties, 
and targeted delivery approaches. This review examines the multifaceted role of 
nanoparticles in AD therapy under various pathological mechanisms. Additionally, 
the review explores the diagnostic potential of nanoparticles in improving the 
detection of AD biomarkers, offering early diagnosis and real-time monitoring of 
disease progression. Despite these promising developments, the clinical 
translation of nanoparticle-based approaches faces challenges related to 
biocompatibility, long-term safety, and regulatory barriers. Ongoing research 
and innovation are essential to optimize nanoparticle formulations, ensure their 
safety, and bring these advanced technologies into clinical practice. 
Nanotechnology represents a paradigm shift in AD management, offering the 
potential for more effective treatments and improved patient outcomes.

Alzheimer's disease is a major cause of dementia, that affects approximately 
7-8% of people aged 65 years and older (according to WHO & Alzheimer's Disease 
International) and thus is a major concern in public health world-wide. This 
review chronicles the foundational research and translational trajectory leading 
to the development of donanemab, a monoclonal antibody targeting pyroglutamyl 
amyloid-β (Aβ3pE-X) peptides, recently approved for the treatment of early 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). We trace a 30-year arc from the biochemical 
identification of Aβ species to the recognition of Aβ3pE-42 as a predominant 
pathological isoform in AD and Down syndrome brains-a fact still underrecognized 
among clinicians and researchers. We highlight key breakthroughs in antibody 
generation, Aβ peptide biochemistry, and resistance to enzymatic degradation. 
Mechanistic distinctions between donanemab (Kisunla®), and lecanemab (Leqembi®) 
are also explored, along with therapeutic implications for targeting specific Aβ 
species at preclinical stages of disease. The review emphasizes how persistent 
biochemical research, fueled by intellectual curiosity, serendipity, and 
rigorous experimentation, has culminated in clinical proof-of-concept for the 
amyloid hypothesis. In addition to its molecular specificity, donanemab's 
development underscores a critical shift toward precision medicine in 
Alzheimer's care. Its clinical validation, though limited in scope, reinforces 
the need for scalable and affordable interventions that can address the growing 
global burden of dementia. We expect these therapeutic antibodies to contribute 
to reducing the global burden by ceasing the disease progression in a 
preclinical stage now that new methods for fluid biomarkers are becoming 
available. As the global population ages, understanding and addressing AD has 
become a top priority in neuroscience and public health.

BackgroundThe Models of Patient Engagement for Alzheimer's Disease (MOPEAD) 
project aimed to identify the most effective and cost-efficient recruitment 
model for detecting prodromal and mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) across five 
European countries.ObjectiveTo examine differences in cardiovascular risk 
factors and cognitive performance among countries and recruitment models using 
MOPEAD data.MethodsIndividuals aged 65-85 with a high risk for prodromal or mild 
AD were included. Four recruitment models were used: a web-based screening tool, 
an open house initiative (OHI), a primary care-based protocol for early 
detection of cognitive decline, and a tertiary care-based screening at a 
diabetologist clinic. Participants from Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, Sweden, 
and Slovenia were recruited. Cardiovascular risk factors were self-reported, and 
cognition was assessed using The Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of 
Neuropsychological Status (RBANS).ResultsA total of 414 individuals (mean age 
71.9, SD = 5.0) were included. Significant differences were observed in physical 
activity (p < 0.001), with individuals from Sweden and Slovenia being the most 
active. Dutch participants scored highest on most cognitive measures. 
Individuals recruited via web-based survey were youngest, most active (61.7%), 
and had the lowest rates of diabetes (12.0%) and heart disease (6.4%), as well 
as the best cognitive scores. Those recruited via diabetologist clinics 
displayed the highest cardiovascular risk and the lowest cognitive 
performance.ConclusionsThis study unveils significant disparities in 
cardiovascular health and cognition across recruitment strategies and European 
countries. The OHI shows promise for future recruitment in the context of 
disease-modifying AD treatments.

BackgroundThe relationship between blood pressure (BP) trajectories across early 
(∼40 years) into mid-life (∼55 years) and preclinical dementia has not 
previously been well studied using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging 
outcomes.ObjectiveTo examine the association between BP trajectories across 
early mid-life into mid mid-life and amyloid- and tau-PET burden in adults 
without clinical dementia.MethodsThis prospective cohort study included 
dementia-free Framingham Heart Study 3rd generation participants with data on 
remote BP (2002-2005) and recent BP (2016-2019) who participated in 
11C-Pittsburgh Compound-B (PiB)-PET and/or 18F-Flortaucipir (FTP)-PET scans 
between 2016 to 2022. Outcomes included global amyloid deposition (in the 
frontal, lateral temporal, parietal and retrosplenial cortices, FLR region) and 
entorhinal tau deposition.ResultsIn 410 participants (mean age 40 ± 8 years at 
remote exam, 56 ± 8 years recent exam), the mean time between the remote exam BP 
measurement and PET was 16 ± 2 years. A steep change (slope of ≥0.5 or 
≤-0.5 mmHg/year) in DBP over early to mid-life was associated with increased 
entorhinal tau-PET deposition (β = 0.02; 95% CI = 0.01, 0.04; p = 0.047), driven 
by a steep decline in DBP (β = 0.04; 95% CI = 0.01, 0.07; p = 0.01). Persistent 
hypertension, new-onset hypertension, resolved hypertension or a steep change in 
SBP were not associated with amyloid or tau burden.ConclusionsIn adults without 
clinical dementia, a steep DBP decline from early mid-life into mid-life was 
associated with tau deposition in the entorhinal cortex, one of the earliest 
affected regions in Alzheimer's disease. Maintaining normotension across the 
∼15-16 years mid-life period may reduce the future risk of tau-PET burden in the 
brain.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized 
by amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregation, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation, remains 
a significant global health challenge. This study investigates the therapeutic 
potential of flavonols-quercetin, kaempferol, myricetin, and fisetin-in 
targeting Aβ aggregation and mitigating AD pathology through diverse molecular 
mechanisms. Our findings reveal that flavonols effectively inhibit Aβ 
oligomerization and fibril formation, reduce oxidative stress via Nrf2/HO-1 
pathway activation, and suppress neuroinflammation by modulating microglial 
polarization. Additionally, these compounds enhance mitochondrial function, 
promote autophagy-mediated clearance of Aβ aggregates, and regulate key enzymes 
such as β-secretase (BACE1) and α-secretases (ADAM10/17), favoring 
non-amyloidogenic pathways. Quercetin demonstrated neuroprotective effects by 
activating TrkB signaling, reducing tau phosphorylation, and enhancing synaptic 
plasticity. Kaempferol prevented Aβ-induced apoptosis via the ER/ERK/MAPK 
pathway and inhibited acetylcholinesterase activity, improving cognitive 
outcomes. Myricetin ameliorated mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative damage 
through GSK3β/ERK2 signaling modulation and showed enhanced brain 
bioavailability when delivered via nanostructured lipid carriers. Fisetin 
reduced Aβ burden by upregulating neprilysin expression, suppressed 
neuroinflammation, and improved synaptic function by restoring synaptic protein 
levels. Overall, flavonols exhibit multi-targeted therapeutic potential against 
AD by addressing its complex pathogenesis. Their ability to cross the 
blood-brain barrier and low toxicity profiles position them as promising 
candidates for further clinical development. This study underscores the 
potential of flavonols as natural agents for AD treatment and highlights their 
role in advancing multi-mechanistic therapeutic strategies.

INTRODUCTION: In observational studies of preclinical AD, an arbitrary 
"baseline" can obscure where an individual is located along a theoretical 
continuum. Optimizing longitudinal trajectories can distill multiple, 
non-linearly distributed observations into a single metric and inform where an 
individual may be along the disease course.
METHODS: We developed a cognitive time (c-time) metric based on longitudinal 
cognitive data (mean = 7.4 years, range = 1.7-11.6) from 316 participants from 
the Harvard Aging Brain Study using non-linear least-squares optimization. We 
examined path analyses between a published time-to-amyloid beta (Aβ)+ metric 
(longitudinal Aβ positron emission tomography [PET]: mean = 6.3 years, 
range = 4.2-9.7) and c-time, including demographics, brain volume, cortical 
thickness, tau PET, and cardiovascular risk.
RESULTS: Time-to-Aβ+ and c-time were positively correlated, with time-to-Aβ+ 
possessing direct and indirect associations with c-time through regional tau 
PET, hippocampal volume, and cortical thickness.
DISCUSSION: Optimizing longitudinal multimodal data to estimate a theoretical 
continuum can provide unique and age-independent information about the distance 
an individual might be from disease-related events.
HIGHLIGHTS: Cognitive time (c-time) represents an individual's distance from a 
hinge point of cognitive decline. C-time and time-to-amyloid beta (Aβ)+ were 
moderately positively correlated. Inferior temporal tau and cortical thickness 
mediated the effect between c-time and time-to-Aβ+. C-time more closely 
associates with tau, brain atrophy, and cortical thickness.

Age is the main risk factor for many neurodegenerative diseases such as 
Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and frontotemporal dementia. Despite 
our limited understanding of cellular mechanisms of ageing-associated neuronal 
loss, an increasing number of studies demonstrate that oxidative stress and 
inflammation are key drivers. Epidemiological studies indicate that diet during 
middle adulthood can influence the risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases 
later in life, so it is important to investigate dietary interventions to combat 
oxidative stress and inflammation. In this study, we hypothesised that treatment 
with fucoxanthin, a marine carotenoid with strong antioxidant properties, 
prevents ageing-associated oxidative stress that is known to be related to 
natural brain ageing. Treatment with fucoxanthin protected rat primary 
hippocampal neurons against oxidative stress and ageing in vitro. In our in vivo 
study, middle-aged male Sprague-Dawley rats were gavaged with fucoxanthin (1 
mg/kg, 5 d/week, n 6) or vehicle (n 6) for 4 weeks. After supplementation was 
completed, brain samples were harvested and subjected to quantitative and 
bioinformatic analyses. Fucoxanthin was detected and shown to decrease lipid 
peroxidation in the brains of the animals supplemented with fucoxanthin. 
Microarray analysis showed that treatment with fucoxanthin changed 5602 genes. 
Together, our results suggest that treatment with fucoxanthin prevents 
ageing-associated oxidative stress and is capable of regulating genes that 
potentially ameliorate age-related changes to the brain.

BACKGROUND: Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) is a rare and severe 
neurodegenerative tauopathy characterized by diverse clinical phenotypes, 
including Richardson's syndrome (PSP-RS), PSP-parkinsonism (PSP-P), 
PSP-progressive gait freezing (PSP-PGF), and PSP-corticobasal syndrome 
(PSP-CBS). Significant geographic variation exists in prevalence, clinical 
presentations, and prognosis.
OBJECTIVES: This global review aims to systematically evaluate the 
epidemiological variation, clinical phenotypes, diagnostic practices, and 
management strategies for PSP, focusing on regional disparities and identifying 
influencing genetic and environmental factors.
METHODOLOGY: A comprehensive literature search following PRISMA guidelines was 
conducted, analyzing studies reporting PSP epidemiology, phenotypes, diagnostic 
criteria, risk factors, treatments, and prognoses. Data were categorized into 
epidemiology, risk factors, clinical presentations, diagnosis, treatment 
accessibility, and outcomes, considering geographic variation.
RESULTS: Global PSP prevalence ranges between 5-6.4 per 100,000, influenced by 
diagnostic criteria and healthcare infrastructure. Clinical manifestations 
commonly include supranuclear gaze palsy, frequent falls, cognitive impairment, 
and motor dysfunction. Prognosis significantly varies with subtype; PSP-RS shows 
rapid progression and shorter survival (5-7 years), whereas PSP-P has a milder 
clinical course (8-12 years). Regional variations highlight differences in 
genetic predispositions, notably the MAPT H1 haplotype, environmental risk 
factors such as dietary neurotoxins and industrial pollutants, and accessibility 
to comprehensive healthcare services. Diagnostic accuracy has improved with the 
adoption of MDS-PSP criteria, facilitating recognition of diverse phenotypes.
CONCLUSIONS: Regional disparities in PSP prevalence, phenotypic presentation, 
and healthcare accessibility underscore the importance of standardized 
diagnostic criteria, targeted genetic and environmental studies, and equitable 
healthcare strategies. Enhanced global collaboration is essential for improving 
PSP diagnosis, management, and patient outcomes worldwide.

Tau reduction is a promising therapeutic approach with the potential to slow the 
progression of Alzheimer's disease. Here, we propose adeno-associated viral 
(AAV) delivery of an artificial miRNA (amiRNA) targeting the 
microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) mRNA for sustained tau reduction with 
a single therapeutic injection. Out of 22 initial designs, we identified potent, 
accurately processed, and highly specific amiRNA candidates. Our lead, 
amiRTau01, significantly reduced pathological forms of phosphorylated tau in the 
brain and spinal cord of the Tau22 tauopathy mouse model. In a nonhuman primate 
study using the novel capsid AAV.GMU01, we demonstrated clear amiRTau01-mediated 
MAPT knockdown in individual neurons; however, vector biodistribution in the NHP 
brain was insufficient to drive MAPT reduction in bulk tissue. Our findings 
support amiRTau01 as a potent therapeutic amiRNA, warranting development of new 
capsids with improved brain biodistribution to facilitate clinical development 
for Alzheimer's disease.

INTRODUCTION: Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, sodium-glucose 
cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) 
inhibitors have potential beneficial effects in Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: We conducted pharmacoepidemiologic studies using two large-scale 
real-world databases. We fitted covariate-adjusted Cox models to compare the 
risks of AD among initiators of GLP-1 receptor agonists, SGLT-2 inhibitors, and 
DPP-4 inhibitors.
RESULTS: We identified GLP-1 receptor agonist initiation compared to DPP-4 
inhibitors initiation was associated with a reduced risk of AD (hazard ratio 
[HR] ≤ 0.69 and P value < 0.001) and SGLT-2 inhibitor initiation compared to 
DPP-4 inhibitor initiation was associated with a reduced risk of AD (HR ≤ 0.67 
and P value < 0.001).
DISCUSSION: GLP-1 receptor agonist initiation and SGLT-2 inhibitor initiation 
are associated with a reduced risk of AD. Randomized clinical trials are 
warranted to validate the causal beneficial effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists 
and SGLT-2 inhibitors in AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are significantly 
associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared to 
dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 
(SGLT-2) inhibitors are significantly associated with a reduced risk of AD 
compared to dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. Two GLP-1 receptor 
agonists (liraglutide and semaglutide) and three SGLT-2 inhibitors 
(dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, and empagliflozin) are associated with a reduced 
risk of AD in drug-specific sensitivity analyses.

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) risk and progression are significantly influenced by 
APOE genotype with APOE4 increasing and APOE2 decreasing susceptibility compared 
to APOE3. While the effect of those genotypes was extensively studied on blood 
metabolome, less is known about their impact in the brain. Here we investigated 
the impacts of APOE genotypes and aging on brain metabolic profiles across the 
lifespan, using human APOE-targeted replacement mice. Biocrates P180 targeted 
metabolomics platform was used to measure a broad range of metabolites probing 
various metabolic processes. In all genotypes investigated we report changes in 
acylcarnitines, biogenic amines, amino acids, phospholipids and sphingomyelins 
during aging. The decreased ratio of medium to long-chain acylcarnitine suggests 
a reduced level of fatty acid β-oxidation and thus the possibility of 
mitochondrial dysfunction as these animals age. Additionally, aging APOE2/2 mice 
had altered branch-chain amino acids (BCAA) profile and increased their 
downstream metabolite C5 acylcarnitine, indicating increased branched-chain 
amino acid utilization in TCA cycle and better energetic profile endowed by this 
protective genotype. We compared these results with human dorsolateral 
prefrontal cortex metabolomic data from the Religious Orders Study/Memory and 
Aging Project, and we found that the carriers of APOE2/3 genotype had lower 
markers of impaired BCAA katabolism, including tiglyl carnitine, methylmalonate 
and 3-methylglutaconate. In summary, these results suggest a potential 
involvement of the APOE2 genotype in BCAA utilization in the TCA cycle and 
nominate these humanized APOE mouse models for further study of APOE in AD, 
brain aging, and brain BCAA utilization for energy. We have previously shown 
lower plasma BCAA to be associated with incident dementia, and their higher 
levels in brain with AD pathology and cognitive impairment. Those findings 
together with our current results could potentially explain the AD-protective 
effect of APOE2 genotype by enabling higher utilization of BCAA for energy 
during the decline of fatty acid β-oxidation.

INTRODUCTION: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to 
synthesize the evidence on the association between herpesviruses, antiviral 
treatment, and the risk of dementia. We also aimed to explore the impact of time 
between herpesviruses and dementia on the reported associations.
METHODS: PubMed and Web of Science were searched along with reference lists of 
the included studies. We included studies that looked at clinical episodes or 
serology (IgG/IgM) of herpes simplex virus type 1/2 (HSV1/2) and/or varicella 
zoster virus (VZV), antiviral treatment and incident dementia (all-cause 
dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and vascular dementia). Study results were pooled 
with random effect meta-analyses.
RESULTS: We included 32 studies. The pooled hazard ratio for all-cause dementia 
was 1.36 [95% CI: 1.01, 1.83] following a clinical episode of HSV1/2, and 1.12 
[95% CI: 1.00, 1.25] following a clinical episode of VZV. The pooled estimate 
for all-cause dementia following antiviral treatment and VZV was 0.88 [95% CI: 
0.81, 0.96].
CONCLUSIONS: The present review of the scientific literature generally shows 
little evidence of an association between herpesviruses and risk of dementia. 
However, the review shows evidence of an association between antiviral treatment 
and a decreased risk of dementia. Because of considerable heterogeneity, future 
investigations could advantageously target certain subgroups.

BACKGROUND: Both cognitive dysfunction and sleep disturbances are individually 
linked to heightened risks of chronic illnesses and mortality. However, their 
combined impact on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality remains underexplored.
METHODS: This study utilized data from the National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2011 to 2014, focusing on participants 
aged ≥ 60 years who completed cognitive tests and sleep-related questionnaires. 
Cognitive function was evaluated using three standardized tests: The Consortium 
to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD), the Animal Fluency 
Test, and the Digit Symbol Substitution Test. Participants with global cognitive 
z-scores below - 1 were classified as having low cognitive function. Sleep 
disturbance was identified based on self-reported diagnoses of sleep disorders 
or complaints of trouble sleeping. Mortality data were sourced from the National 
Death Index. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate adjusted 
hazard ratios (aHR) for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, with adjustments 
for potential confounders.
RESULTS: A total of 3,170 participants ≥ 60 years of age were included for 
analysis. Participants with low cognitive function alone had an adjusted hazard 
ratio (aHR) of 1.59 (95% CI: 1.12-2.26) for all-cause mortality. The risk 
increased to an aHR of 1.73 (95% CI: 1.07-2.79) when both low cognitive function 
and sleep disturbances were present. Stratified analyses revealed that the 
associations between cognitive function, sleep disturbance, and mortality risks 
varied across sex, BMI, and chronic kidney disease status.
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of low cognitive function and sleep disturbances is 
associated with a higher risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, 
exceeding the risk of either condition alone. These findings emphasize the need 
to consider both factors together when assessing mortality risk in older adults.

Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, pose 
a significant and continuous burden on the healthcare system, urging the search 
for innovative therapeutical approaches targeting the central nervous system. 
Nowadays, no definitive treatment can effectively modulate the neuronal 
degeneration associated with such diseases. The current line of therapies is 
primarily symptomatic and suffers several drawbacks. Among these, phytochemicals 
are emerging for their potential in the management of neurodegenerative 
disorders. Indeed, plants produce secondary metabolites that provide defensive 
functions against abiotic and biotic stresses. These metabolites can target the 
neurons and represent a promising therapeutic intervention for neurological 
disorders. However, the polar nature of phytochemicals and their large size 
hinder their passage through the blood-brain barrier, a selective barrier 
separating blood and the brain. Emerging studies have shown that the therapeutic 
efficiency of phytochemicals has been enhanced following their encapsulation 
with engineered nanocarriers such as lipid nanoparticles. Recent research 
indicates that delivering phytochemicals through lipid nanoparticles improves 
their physiological stability, promotes their passage across the blood-brain 
barrier, and enhances their accumulation in brain tissue-resulting in more 
effective neuroprotective effects than their free, unencapsulated form. Hence, 
the aim of the present review is to highlight the application of lipid 
nanoparticles as carriers for phytoactives with neuroprotective properties, 
discuss the current challenges associated with such nanocarriers, and provide 
insights into potential future research work.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, chronic disease characterized by 
impaired cognitive function. Currently, there is no complete cure for ad; 
current treatments are aimed at reducing symptoms and slowing the progression of 
the disease. It is thought that the amount of fatty acid consumption and the 
balance between them may be protective against neurological diseases. In this 
study, it was aimed to determine the protective effects of Ω3/Ω6 polyunsaturated 
fatty acids ratios in Aβ1-42-induced ad model in human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) 
cells. The viability of cells was determined by MTT assay. The percentage of 
apoptotic cells was determined by FITC-conjugated Annexin-V/PI. ROS, MMP and 
cell cycle analysis were performed by flow cytometry. The amount of 
acetylcholinesterase enzyme was measured with a commercial kit. 48 h after the 
application, a statistically significant decrease was observed in the MTT test 
in the 1/1, 1/2 and 1/8 groups and in the amount of AChE in the 1/4, 1/8 and 
1/16 groups. According to apoptosis findings, all ratios were observed to reduce 
cell viability compared to the control group. ROS and MMP levels were detected 
to decrease in all groups compared to the control group. The highest 
neuroprotective effect against oxidative stress was observed at 1/1 dose. Aβ1-42 
induced blockade of the cell cycle was observed to be partially corrected by 1/8 
dose. As a result, it can be said that Ω6 and Ω3 fatty acids, when used in 1/4 
and 1/8 doses can provide a protective effect against Alzheimer's disease.

PURPOSE: The triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is a new 
therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease. However, its role in obstructive 
sleep apnea (OSA)-related cognitive impairment is still unclear. This study 
aimed to investigate the effect and regulatory mechanism of TREM2 on cognitive 
impairment related to OSA.
METHODS: Since intermittent hypoxia (IH) is the primary pathophysiologic 
characteristic of OSA, we conducted IH animal and BV2 cell model to investigate 
the mechanism. Trem2 knockdown and Trem2 overexpression cells were created by 
Lentivirus transfection. A disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17) is the 
primary enzyme for TREM2 shedding, we used TAPI-1 to inhibit its activity. 
Morris water maze, Nissl staining, real-time PCR, immunofluorescence, Western 
blotting, fluorometric assay kit, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were 
used to explore the molecular mechanism.
RESULTS: The TREM2 levels were decreased in BV2 cells exposed to IH for 
24 hours. IH elevated the levels of IL-1β, TNF-α and CD86 in BV2 cells, as well 
as the levels of p-Tau in conditioned media-cultured HT-22 cells. Conversely, IH 
reduced the levels of IL-10 and CD206 in BV2 cells. However, these effects were 
exacerbated in BV2 cells with Trem2 knockdown, whereas they were mitigated in 
those with Trem2 overexpression. Additionally, the ADAM17 activity and soluble 
TREM2 (sTREM2) levels were increased in BV2 cells subjected to IH. Treatment 
with TAPI-1, suppressed ADAM17 activity and restored TREM2 expression both in 
vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of ADAM17 led to a reduction in the expression of 
CD86, IL-1β, TNF-α and p-Tau levels, while enhancing the expression of CD206, 
IL10 and cognitive functions.
CONCLUSION: TREM2 played a protective role in IH-induced neuroinflammation and 
neuronal injury by promoting microglia M2 polarization. IH caused excessive 
activation of ADAM17 and resulted in augmented degradation of TREM2. Restoring 
TREM2 expression by inhibiting ADAM17 indicates a potentially promising 
therapeutic strategy for cognitive impairment in OSA.

INTRODUCTION: An assessment of the value of lecanemab for patients living with 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their care partners provides them and their 
health-care providers important information for deciding treatment initiation.
METHODS: We used data from a nationally representative sample of middle aged and 
older Americans combined with data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) on AD progression and data on lecanemab treatment effects from 
Clarity AD clinical trials. We use dynamic microsimulation modeling to quantify 
the long-term health and economic value of lecanemab for persons living with AD 
and their care partners.
RESULTS: We quantified five measures of value: quality of life of the persons 
living with AD and their care partners, medical costs, caregiving costs, and 
earnings, and estimated that lecanemab had a value of $21,398 relative to no 
treatment after 4 years and $37,943 after 10 years. Extending the treatment to 
48 months resulted in a value of $42,821 relative to no treatment after 4 years 
and $95,311 after 10 years. Forty-eight months of a similar next-generation 
therapy but with 50% efficacy in slowing cognitive and functional decline 
resulted in a value of $82,116 relative to no treatment after 4 years and 
$189,691 after 10 years.
DISCUSSION: Over time, lecanemab treatment reduced medical costs, hours of care 
required from care partners, and improved quality of life. There is much value 
to be gained with next-generation treatments that have a larger impact on 
slowing decline. Considering a wider range of outcomes in future assessments 
will provide a more complete understanding of value to support decision making 
about treatment initiation and about reimbursement for payers.
HIGHLIGHTS: There is significant value of lecanemab for persons with mild 
cognitive impairment or mild dementia.Over time, lecanemab reduces medical 
costs, caregiver hours, and improves the quality of life of persons living with 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their care partners.A next-generation treatment for 
AD with similar features to lecanemab but higher efficacy, more than doubles the 
value.Assessing therapy value supports decision making by patients and their 
health-care providers.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, 
characterized by amyloid-beta (Aβ) aggregation, tau hyperphosphorylation, 
oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation resulted the cognitive memory loss. 
Despite extensive research, effective therapeutic treatment remains elusive. 
Polyphenols, naturally occurring bioactive compounds, have emerged as promising 
neuroprotective agents due to their potent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and 
amyloid-modulating properties. Research indicated that these bioactive compounds 
have potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, have garnered 
significant attention for their potential role in combating AD by targeting its 
key pathological mechanisms. Preclinical studies highlight the efficacy of 
various polyphenols, such as resveratrol, curcumin, and epigallocatechin 
gallate, in improving cognitive function and reducing neurodegeneration. 
Moreover, in silico approaches, displayed polyphenols mechanistic interactions 
with key AD targets to reduce pathogenesis. These computational models 
accelerate drug discovery by predicting binding affinities, optimizing 
structural modifications, and identifying novel polyphenol derivatives with 
enhanced therapeutic potential. This review explores the multifaceted role of 
polyphenols in AD mitigation, emphasizing their impact on oxidative stress and 
neuroinflammation while integrating in silico evidence to reinforce their 
therapeutic relevance. Convincingly, through the suppression of key mediators of 
AD, including oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, amyloid-beta and tau 
proteins, polyphenols exhibited outstanding therapeutic potential to treat AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder primarily 
characterized by memory impairment and cognitive decline, for which no curative 
treatment is currently available. Existing therapeutic strategies, such as 
cholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists, 
can only provide limited symptomatic relief and fail to halt disease 
progression. In recent years, stem cell therapy has emerged as a promising 
approach for AD due to its multifaceted mechanisms of action. The therapeutic 
effects of stem cells in AD are mainly attributed to their ability to 
differentiate into functional neurons or glial cells, thereby replacing damaged 
cells and repairing neural networks. In addition, stem cells secrete 
neurotrophic and anti-inflammatory factors that contribute to the improvement of 
the brain microenvironment. Furthermore, they can regulate neuroinflammation, 
promote the clearance of β-amyloid (Aβ) deposits, and suppress 
neuroinflammation, thus potentially slowing disease progression. However, 
several challenges remain, including low cell survival rates, immune rejection, 
tumorigenic risks, and difficulties in crossing the blood-brain barrier. Looking 
ahead, the integration of advanced technologies such as organoid models, gene 
editing, artificial intelligence, and multi-omics approaches may drive 
substantial progress in the clinical translation of stem cell therapies for AD. 
Although still in its early stages, the future of this therapeutic strategy 
holds great promise.

Chronic alcohol use is a major modifiable risk factor for Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), yet the mechanisms by which it modulates AD pathophysiology remain 
unclear. Here, we examined circuit-level and pathological changes in two 
distinct AD mouse models, humanized Aβ knock-in (hAPP-KI) (Aβ-driven) and PS19 
(tau-driven), subjected to a chronic intermittent alcohol exposure paradigm. In 
hAPP-KI mice, alcohol increased Aβ accumulation and excitatory transmission in 
the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) while reducing corticostriatal transmission 
and striatal cholinergic output. These alterations were accompanied by enhanced 
recruitment of microglia around Aβ plaques. In contrast, alcohol-exposed PS19 
mice displayed elevated mPFC-to-dorsomedial striatum (DMS) glutamatergic 
transmission and increased tau phosphorylation without significant changes in 
microglial activation or local mPFC excitatory drive. In wild-type mice, 
microglial depletion enhanced glutamatergic transmission onto cortical neurons, 
suggesting a homeostatic role for microglia in maintaining excitatory balance. 
Together, these findings reveal pathology-specific effects of alcohol on circuit 
dysfunction and propose microglia as an important modulator of alcohol-induced 
synaptic remodeling in the early stage of AD.

BACKGROUND: Lower socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with increased risk 
of cognitive decline and dementia, yet reliance on singular indicators of SES 
limits understanding of these relationships. We examined multiple SES 
characteristics at the individual and area-levels simultaneously in association 
with diverse cognitive processes in a large, community-dwelling older adult 
sample.
METHODS: Data collected at three United States sites (Boston, Pittsburgh, Kansas 
City) included a comprehensive cognitive assessment comprising measures of 
episodic memory, executive function, processing speed, working memory, and 
visuospatial abilities. Multiple SES measures were obtained including area-level 
(Area Deprivation Index), subjective, and objective SES. We generated a novel 
objective SES latent factor from measures of income, savings, debt-adjusted 
savings, and financial stability using full information maximum likelihood to 
address missing data, and examined cross-sectional associations of SES 
indicators with each cognitive domain as outcome variables in multivariable 
regression models.
FINDINGS: This study included 648 cognitively unimpaired older adults (69.88 
(3.75) years; 71% female). Individual-level objective SES (processing speed, β 
[95% confidence interval (CI)] = 0.225 [0.152-0.299]; executive function, 0.210 
[0.137-0.283]; episodic memory, 0.113 [0.040-0.186]; working memory, 0.200 
[0.129-0.271]; visuospatial processing, 0.165 [0.093-0.238]) and subjective SES 
(processing speed, β [95% CI] = 0.148 [0.077-0.219]; executive function, 0.138 
[0.067-0.208]; episodic memory, 0.020 [-0.051 to 0.091]; working memory, 0.128 
[0.059-0.197]; visuospatial processing, 0.094 [0.023-0.164]) outperformed 
area-level SES in detecting cognitive deficits, and demonstrated widespread 
associations with poorer performance across cognitive domains. On average, 
individuals categorized into the lowest objective SES quartile performed between 
0.22 and 0.58 standard deviations lower than those in the highest quartile 
across domains (processing speed, pairwise adjusted mean difference [95% CI] = 
0.580 [0.304-0.856]; executive function, 0.556 [0.282-0.829]; episodic memory, 
0.223 [-0.054 to 0.499]; working memory, 0.516 [0.248-0.784]; visuospatial 
processing, 0.434 [0.161-0.706]). A novel objective SES composite showed robust 
associations with cognition above and beyond traditional SES measures. All 
findings are subject to missing at random assumptions.
INTERPRETATION: Standard measures of objective SES may underestimate the broad 
cognitive burden of socioeconomic inequity. Integrating multiple financial 
indicators into future studies may improve estimation of the public health 
impact of socioeconomic conditions in older adulthood.

Neurodegenerative diseases represent a significant and growing challenge to 
public health worldwide. Current therapeutic strategies often fall short in 
halting or reversing disease progression, highlighting the urgent need for novel 
approaches. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have garnered attention as potential 
therapeutic agents due to their role in intercellular communication and their 
ability to transport bioactive cargo, including proteins, nucleic acids, and 
lipids. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the biology of EVs, 
their involvement in neurodegenerative diseases, and the potential for EV-based 
therapies. We discuss the different types of EVs, their biogenesis, and their 
cargo composition, emphasizing their relevance to neurological processes such as 
protein misfolding, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress. Preclinical studies 
investigating EVs as carriers of therapeutic cargo and their ability to promote 
neuronal survival and regeneration are examined, with a focus on evidence from 
animal models of neurodegenerative disorders. We explore the use of EVs in the 
treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, including ongoing clinical trials, 
methods for EV isolation and modification, and future perspectives on 
personalized EV-based therapies designed to meet the unique needs of individual 
patients. Overall, this review highlights the potential of EVs as a promising 
avenue for neurodegenerative disease therapy, while also addressing key research 
gaps and translational hurdles that need to be overcome for their successful 
clinical implementation.

Medial temporal lobe Tau-Neurodegeneration mismatch from MRI and plasma 
biomarkers identifies vulnerable and resilient phenotypes with AD.

Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.

While tau pathology is closely associated with neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), our prior work using multi-modality imaging revealed that mismatch 
between tau (T) and neurodegeneration (N) may reflect contributions from non-AD 
processes. The medial temporal lobe (MTL), an early site of AD pathology, is 
also a common target of co-pathologies such as limbic-predominant age-related 
TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathologic change (LATE-NC), often following an 
anterior-posterior atrophy gradient. Given the susceptibility of MTL to 
co-pathologies, here we explored T-N mismatch specifically within MTL using 
plasma ptau 217 and MTL morphometry for identifying vulnerabilities and 
resilience in cognitively impaired or unimpaired AD patients. We parcellated the 
MTL into 100 spatially contiguous segments and calculated their T-N mismatch 
using plasma ptau 217 as a measure for T and thickness as a marker of N. Based 
on these mismatch profiles, we clustered 447 amyloid-positive individuals from 
ADNI cohort into data-driven T-N phenotypes. We characterized the T-N phenotypes 
by examining their cross-sectional and longitudinal atrophy both within the MTL 
and across the whole brain, as well as cognitive trajectories. This framework 
was replicated in an independent cohort and finally translated to a real-world 
clinical sample of 50 patients undergoing anti-amyloid therapy. Clustering 
identified three T-N phenotypes with different MTL T-N mismatch profiles, 
atrophy patterns, and cognitive outcomes, despite comparable AD severity. The 
"canonical" group, characterized by low T-N residuals (N ∼ T), showed AD-like 
neurodegeneration patterns. The "vulnerable" group, characterized by 
disproportionately greater neurodegeneration than tau (N > T), showed atrophy 
primarily in the anterior MTL that extended into temporal-limbic regions, both 
in cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. This group also exhibited 
neurodegeneration that preceded estimated tau onset and experienced faster 
cognitive decline across multiple domains, aligning with the typical 
characteristics of mixed LATE-NC with AD. In contrast, the "resilient" group (N 
< T) showed minimal atrophy and preserved cognitive function. These phenotypes 
were reproducible in an independent research cohort. Importantly, in a 
feasibility study applying the model developed from ADNI to a clinical cohort of 
patients receiving lecanemab, we identified vulnerable individuals with 
LATE-like atrophy patterns. This highlights its potential utility for 
identifying individuals with co-pathology in clinical settings. Our findings 
demonstrate that T-N mismatch within MTL using MRI and plasma biomarkers can 
reveal AD groups with varying vulnerability/resilience, with the vulnerable 
group displaying structural and cognitive outcomes suggestive of LATE-NC. This 
approach offers a cost-effective strategy for clinical trial stratification and 
precision medicine for AD therapeutics.

BACKGROUND: Timely identification of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is critical 
for maximizing early intervention opportunities in older adults at risk for 
dementia. This study evaluated the feasibility, acceptability, and validity of 
novel digital cognitive tests in primary care.
METHODS: In a two-phase pilot study across three clinics, 51 older adults 
completed digital cognitive assessments remotely on personal devices followed by 
supervised tablet-based cognitive screening in-clinic and the Montreal Cognitive 
Assessment (MoCA). Surveys and interviews assessed patient and provider 
acceptability. Digital test completion rates were examined to assess 
feasibility.
RESULTS: Completion rates ranged from 61.5% - 76% for the at-home assessments 
and 81.8% for in-clinic testing. Participants generally preferred at-home 
testing. Providers found in-clinic testing acceptable but identified barriers 
related to device access and EMR integration. All but one digital test showed 
moderate correlations with the MoCA.
CONCLUSION: Digital cognitive screening-whether remote or in-clinic-shows 
promise for primary care implementation.

Accelerated repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an effective 
treatment for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), with an FDA-cleared protocol 
utilizing 10 sessions of prolonged intermittent Theta Burst Stimulation (piTBS) 
per day for five days. However, it remains unclear how many sessions and pulses 
are necessary to achieve benefit. We examined efficacy of five stimulation 
sessions per day for five days ("5×5") of either piTBS or individualized, 
electroencephalogram-based "resonant frequency" (RF) stimulation. We compared 
MDD symptom improvement (PHQ-9) between two groups: 1) accelerated patients (N = 
40) undergoing 5×5 treatment (patients received piTBS or RF rTMS) and 2) 
conventional patients (N = 135) receiving standard once daily rTMS. Both 
protocols ameliorated MDD symptoms and there were no statistically significant 
differences in depression symptom changes (p = .07) between the accelerated 5×5 
protocol (mean PHQ-9: pre-rTMS = 17.68, post-rTMS = 10.98) and conventional 
once-daily treatment (mean PHQ-9: pre-rTMS = 17.83, post-rTMS = 8.97). There was 
no significant difference in improvement between the piTBS and RF 5×5 protocols 
(p = 0.9). A PHQ-9 median split of 5×5 patients revealed that the top half of 
patients showed robust depression improvement (69%) while the bottom half 
received no significant benefit (8%) by day 5. However, the bottom half showed 
significant improvement (36%) at two-to-four-week follow up (p = 0.001). These 
results suggest 5×5 accelerated rTMS treatment is as effective as once daily 
rTMS treatment and that the efficacy of accelerated treatment may not be 
accurately assessed until weeks after treatment completion.

Cognitive dysfunction in the elderly is not only a disease but also could be 
considered a preclinical condition of Alzheimer's disease (AD), one of the most 
common types of dementia in the elderly. Therefore, treatment such as early 
detection and management of risk factors that could slow and prevent the onset 
of dementia is necessary for the elderly. Estrogen reduces the risk of AD in 
postmenopausal women. It has also been shown to reduce amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology 
in animal models of AD and suppress Aβ secretion from neuronal tissue. Estrogen 
receptors are involved in cognitive processes such as learning and memory, the 
formation of the hippocampus, the amygdala, and the cerebral cortex. Hormone 
replacement therapy (HRT) could improve cognition and thus delay the development 
of AD. Giving HRT after 9 years has been shown to increase the risk of breast 
cancer two-fold and cardiovascular disease. Phytoestrogens are hormones found in 
plants that can be an alternative to HRT. One of the foods that contains 
phytoestrogens and is widely consumed in Indonesia is tempeh. Isoflavone is a 
dominant phytoestrogen, structurally an estrogen-like substance, and 
functionally similar to 17β-estradiol. In this review article, we will discuss 
the role of tempeh isoflavones in a mechanism pathway on cognition.

Longitudinal impact of cholinesterase inhibitors on cholinergic white matter 
integrity in mild cognitive impairment: A diffusion MRI study.

BACKGROUND: Early degeneration of the cholinergic nucleus basalis of Meynert 
contributes to cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Microstructural 
damage in downstream cholinergic tracts-the cingulum bundle (CGC), entorhinal 
cortex (EC), and uncinate fasciculus (UNC)-often precedes volumetric atrophy. 
While cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) can preserve cortical and hippocampal 
volume, their influence on white-matter integrity is unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether ChEIs slow microstructural decline in four 
cholinergic tracts (CGC, EC, UNC, posterior thalamic radiation [PTR]) in mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI), and whether baseline cognitive status modulates this 
effect.
METHODS: Diffusion-tensor imaging from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative was analyzed in 46 MCI participants receiving donepezil or 
rivastigmine and 62 untreated MCI controls, each scanned serially over two 
years. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) indexed tract 
integrity. Linear mixed-effects models tested time × medication × baseline 
cognition (ADAS-Cog13) interactions, adjusting for age, sex, APOE ε4, and 
white-matter hyperintensity burden.
RESULTS: Across groups, CGC showed progressive degeneration (FA↓, MD↑; 
p < 0.001). Significant three-way interactions emerged for MD in bilateral CGC, 
FA in right EC, and MD in left PTR (all p < 0.01). ChEI users with milder 
baseline impairment (lower ADAS-Cog13) exhibited attenuated FA loss and MD 
increase, indicating slower microstructural decline; those with greater initial 
impairment derived minimal benefit. No medication effect was detected in UNC.
CONCLUSIONS: ChEIs confer tract-specific, stage-dependent protection of 
cholinergic white matter, particularly in early MCI. The findings underscore the 
value of initiating ChEI therapy before substantial cognitive deterioration and 
highlight the need for stage-tailored interventions aimed at preserving 
white-matter integrity in prodromal AD.

Oropharyngeal dysphagia frequently occurs in persons living with Alzheimer's 
disease and related dementias (PLWD) and results in negative health 
consequences. Strength-based exercises may address swallowing biomechanical 
impairments. Expiratory muscle strength training (EMST) is an intervention 
examined in other neurodegenerative populations and has demonstrated promise for 
improving respiratory muscle strength and airway defense physiologic capacity, 
potentially improving swallowing safety. We describe a case of a patient with 
Alzheimer's disease who participated in five consecutive weeks of EMST. We 
demonstrate that EMST is a feasible intervention for PLWD. Further research 
should be conducted to assess efficacy and benefit of EMST for PLWD.

A thematic analysis of Lay knowledge and beliefs about dementia among 
first-generation Black African immigrants from West Africa living in London: 
Informed by a grounded theory approach.

Mokwenye RC(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Health Sciences, Brunel University London, UK.

BACKGROUND: Many Black Africans live in the UK. More than 850,000 people live 
with dementia in the UK, and more than 25,000 people with dementia are from 
Black and minority ethnic groups. The study explores themes of lay knowledge and 
beliefs about dementia.
DESIGN AND METHODS: This study employs a qualitative research design and methods 
to explore lay knowledge and beliefs about dementia amongst Black African 
populations living in London. The research is philosophically underpinned by 
social constructionism and sociological and anthropological lay concepts of 
health and illness. The researcher interviewed 31 adult respondents, male and 
female, from the Black African community in London to generate rich data. 
Participants were first-generation immigrants from West Africa living in London 
and were mainly carers. Thematic data analysis informed by a grounded theory 
approach was used to analyse the data.
RESULTS: The findings show that dementia is a complex biopsychosocial 
phenomenon. Four key themes with subthemes emerged and were developed: (i) 
Traditional views, (ii) Disease and illness, (iii) Help-seeking, and (iv) 
Caregiving and treatment. The group's understanding of dementia evolved from 
traditional views to a more medical perspective. This study added witchcraft to 
the dementia literature on BAME in the UK.
CONCLUSIONS: The study concluded that the group does not lack knowledge of 
dementia. Their understanding and beliefs about dementia are evolving, and 
further efforts are needed to enhance awareness through education, training, and 
outreach to support individuals with dementia and their families within the 
Black African community.

OBJECTIVE: We report a case of CSF1R-microglial encephalopathy associated with a 
rare intronic c.2654 + 1G>A mutation, featuring negative diffusion-weighted 
imaging (DWI) findings and a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker profile 
indicative of Alzheimer's disease-related changes, and we explore the 
associations between genetic mutations, CSF biomarker alterations, and 
neuroimaging manifestations.
METHODS: This study documents the demographic data, detailed medical history, 
and clinical manifestations of a patient with CSF1R-microglial encephalopathy. 
The medical histories of some family members were collected, and the proband 
underwent whole-exome sequencing (WES) for diagnostic confirmation.
RESULTS: The patient, a 53-year-old woman, presented with early-onset cognitive 
decline, personality changes, and behavioral abnormalities. Neuropsychological 
testing revealed severe cognitive impairment, and the CSF biomarker profile 
suggested Alzheimer's disease-related changes. Cranial MRI showed bilateral, 
symmetric deep white matter changes, brain atrophy (including corpus callosum 
thinning), and low signal intensity on DWI. Family history revealed that 3 out 
of 19 individuals across four generations, including the proband, her aunt, and 
her sister, developed dementia and progressed to severe cognitive impairment 
rapidly. WES analysis revealed a heterozygous c.2654 + 1G>A variant in the CSF1R 
gene (NM_005211.3), confirming a diagnosis of CSF1R-microglial encephalopathy 
caused by a dominant autosomal mutation in exon 20 of the CSF1R gene.
CONCLUSION: CSF1R-microglial encephalopathy is a progressive disorder with 
diverse early clinical presentations, making it prone to misdiagnosis and 
delayed treatment. This case suggests that, contrary to previous findings, 
negative DWI results should not exclude CSF1R-microglial encephalopathy. In 
addition, CSF biomarker profiles in patients with CSF1R-microglial 
encephalopathy may exhibit Alzheimer's disease-related changes. Early genetic 
testing is critical, and for genetically linked diseases, testing other family 
members can help ensure early diagnosis and intervention.

Early detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is crucial for timely interventions 
and optimizing treatment outcomes. Integrating multimodal neuroimaging datasets 
can enhance the early detection of AD. However, models must address the 
challenge of incomplete modalities, a common issue in real-world scenarios, as 
not all patients have access to all modalities due to practical constraints such 
as cost and availability. We propose a deep learning framework employing 
Incomplete Cross-modal Mutual Knowledge Distillation (IC-MKD) to model different 
sub-cohorts of patients based on their available modalities. In IC-MKD, the 
multimodal model (e.g., MRI and PET) serves as a teacher, while the 
single-modality model (e.g., MRI only) is the student. Our IC-MKD framework 
features three components: a Modality-Disentangling Teacher (MDT) model designed 
through information disentanglement, a student model that learns from 
classification errors and MDT's knowledge, and the teacher model enhanced via 
distilling the student's single-modal feature extraction capabilities. Moreover, 
we show the effectiveness of the proposed method through theoretical analysis 
and validate its performance with simulation studies. In addition, our method is 
demonstrated through a case study with Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) datasets, underscoring the potential of artificial 
intelligence in addressing incomplete multimodal neuroimaging datasets and 
advancing early AD detection.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a major neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by progressive cognitive decline, amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregation, tau 
pathology, oxidative stress, and chronic neuroinflammation. In recent years, the 
dietary flavonoid naringenin, abundant in citrus fruits, has gained attention as 
a multi-target neuroprotective agent with potential application in AD therapy. 
Preclinical studies demonstrate that naringenin exhibits robust antioxidant 
activity, notably through activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related 
factor 2 (Nrf2)/antioxidant response element (ARE) signaling pathway, which 
reduces ROS and preserves mitochondrial integrity. Furthermore, naringenin 
upregulates AMPK-mediated autophagy, aiding in the clearance of toxic Aβ 
peptides and promoting neuronal survival. Inflammatory cascades are 
significantly downregulated following naringenin treatment. Additionally, 
naringenin modulates estrogen receptor and PI3K/Akt signaling, contributing to 
enhanced neuronal viability and reduced apoptosis. Notably, its ability to 
inhibit acetylcholinesterase suggests promise for restoring cholinergic 
neurotransmission. Despite these benefits, naringenin's poor solubility and 
limited oral bioavailability hinder clinical translation. To address these 
challenges, advanced nanocarrier-based delivery systems have been engineered to 
facilitate blood-brain barrier penetration and sustained brain targeting, 
markedly improving cognitive outcomes in animal models. Safety profiles in 
rodents indicate low toxicity at therapeutic doses, reinforcing its viability as 
a candidate compound. This review highlights the multifaceted mechanisms and 
delivery strategies of naringenin in AD, and underscores the need for 
well-designed clinical trials to confirm its efficacy and safety in humans.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition that 
impairs memory and cognition, presenting a growing global healthcare burden. 
Despite major research efforts, no cure exists, and treatments remain focused on 
symptom relief. This narrative review highlights recent advancements in 
artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning (ML) and deep 
learning (DL), which enhance early diagnosis, predict disease progression, and 
support personalized treatment strategies. AI applications are reshaping 
healthcare by enabling early detection, predicting disease progression, and 
developing personalized treatment plans. In particular, AI's ability to analyze 
complex datasets, including genetic and imaging data, has shown promise in 
identifying early biomarkers of AD. Additionally, AI-driven cognitive training 
and rehabilitation programs are emerging as effective tools to improve cognitive 
function and slow down the progression of cognitive impairment. The paper also 
discusses the potential of AI in drug discovery and clinical trial optimization, 
offering new avenues for the development of AD treatments. The paper emphasizes 
the need for ongoing interdisciplinary collaboration and regulatory oversight to 
harness AI's full potential in transforming AD care and improving patient 
outcomes.

Exploring efficient and effective mammalian models for Alzheimer's disease.

Kayano M(1).

Author information:
(1)Research Center for Global Agromedicine, Obihiro University of Agriculture 
and Veterinary Medicine, Obihiro, Japan.

The aim of this study was to explore and discuss efficient and effective 
mammalian models for Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, efficient AD 
models are characterized by a small body size, a short lifespan, and rapid 
development of the main pathology including amyloid plaque formation. Effective 
AD models are expected to exhibit not only the main pathology, but also 
co-pathology associated with other neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Lewy body 
dementia), systemic disturbances such as disrupted central-peripheral 
homeostasis, and sleep-circadian failures. This reflects recent findings 
indicating that AD is far more multifactorial than previously assumed. Although 
further investigation is required, non-human primates, particularly common 
marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), and dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) are candidates 
of promising and effective AD models. Tree shrews (Tupaia belangeri), guinea 
pigs (Cavia porcellus), and evolutionary related species including degus 
(Octodon degus) constitute an alternative group of AD models that remain 
underexplored but potentially efficient and effective. These mammalian models, 
together with hypothesis-driven mouse models and advances in data science 
technologies including omics and imaging analyses, may lead to breakthroughs in 
AD research, resulting in the development of effective prevention and treatment 
for AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by the pathological aggregation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, 
particularly Aβ-42, which plays a central role in disease progression. Soluble 
Aβ dimers have been implicated as the primary neurotoxic species contributing to 
synaptic dysfunction and cognitive impairment. In this study, we employ a 
comprehensive computational framework integrating molecular dynamics (MD) 
simulations, neural relational inference (NRI) modeling, and largest Lyapunov 
exponent (LLE) analysis to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying Aβ-42 
dimerization and evaluate the inhibitory potential of small molecules, apigenin 
and caffeine. Our findings demonstrate that apigenin exhibits a stronger 
inhibitory effect on Aβ-42 aggregation compared to caffeine. MD simulations 
reveal that apigenin disrupts monomer-monomer interactions by destabilizing key 
aggregation-prone regions, particularly residues 29 and 30, as quantified by 
MM/GBSA binding-free energy calculations. The application of NRI modeling 
further confirms the role of apigenin in reducing residue-residue interaction 
strength, thereby preventing the formation of stable β-sheet structures. 
Additionally, LLE analysis highlights the ability of apigenin to mitigate 
chaotic fluctuations within Aβ-42 dynamics, stabilizing monomeric conformations 
while preventing dimerization. By integrating computational biophysics and 
mathematical modeling approaches, this study provides a novel mechanistic 
understanding of Aβ-42 aggregation and offers compelling evidence for apigenin 
as a promising therapeutic candidate for AD. These findings underscore the 
potential of natural small molecules in targeting early-stage Aβ-42 aggregation, 
paving the way for future experimental and clinical investigations.

The connection between the gut and brain forms a sophisticated two-way 
communication system where compounds produced by intestinal bacteria, especially 
short-chain fatty acids, play essential roles in brain-related disease 
processes. Evidence across multiple neurological disorders reveals convergent 
pathophysiological pathways involving SCFAs, which modulate neurological 
function via histone deacetylase inhibition, G-protein coupled receptor 
activation, and blood-brain barrier regulation. Clinical investigations 
demonstrate disorder-specific signatures: reduced butyrate-producing bacteria 
correlate with Parkinson's disease progression; Alzheimer's disease exhibits 
significant reductions in key SCFAs; and diminished butyrate production disrupts 
immunoregulatory homeostasis in multiple sclerosis. Additionally, 
neurodevelopmental disorders like autism show distinctive microbiome alterations 
affecting both gut and brain function. Beyond SCFAs, microbiota influence neural 
communication through immune modulation, neurotransmitter production, and vagus 
nerve signaling. Interventional studies targeting the microbiome through 
precision probiotics, prebiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation 
demonstrate preliminary efficacy, particularly in Parkinson's disease and 
autism. Methodological heterogeneity and challenges establishing causality 
remain significant limitations. Future priorities include longitudinal 
characterization of microbiome dynamics preceding symptom onset, development of 
personalized therapeutics, and implementation of predictive computational 
models. Progress in these domains could transform microbiome-based approaches 
from experimental interventions to precision medicine applications in 
neurological disease management.

TDP-linked proteinopathies, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), 
frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 
encephalopathy (LATE), are characterised by pathogenic deposits containing 
transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) in the brain and spinal 
cord of patients. These hallmark pathological features are associated with 
widespread neuronal dysfunction and progressive neurodegeneration. TDP-43's role 
as an essential RNA/DNA-binding protein in RNA metabolism and gene expression 
regulation is clear, but deciphering the intricate pathophysiological mechanisms 
underpinning TDP-43-mediated neurodegeneration is paramount for developing 
effective therapies and novel diagnostic tools for early detection before frank 
neuronal loss occurs. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, with highly conserved 
TDP-43 orthologue TDP-1, serves as a powerful genetic model to investigate the 
molecular underpinnings of TDP-43 proteinopathies. Here, we provide a brief 
overview of the structural and functional characteristics of TDP-43 and TDP-1, 
highlighting their conserved roles in RNA metabolism, stress responses, and 
neurodegeneration. We then delve into the pathobiology of TDP-43, drawing 
insights from C. elegans models expressing either monogenic TDP-43 variants or 
bigenic combinations with ALS-associated risk genes, and discuss how these 
models have advanced our understanding of the pathomechanisms of TDP-43 
proteinopathies. By employing its simplicity and genetic manipulability, we 
discuss how these models have helped identify chemical and genetic suppressors 
of TDP-43-induced phenotypes, including small molecules like Pimozide and the 
probiotic Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus HA-114, now in clinical trials. This 
review underscores the translational value of C. elegans in unraveling the 
biochemical pathways and interactions in TDP-43 proteinopathies that perturb 
cellular physiology, potentially facilitating mechanism-based therapy 
development.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of β 
-Amyloid and τ proteins in the brain that causes dementia. To date, there is no 
cure capable of eradicating AD, so it is necessary to study a performing 
therapy. The NECTAR project aims to investigate an extension of the conventional 
Boron Neutron Capture Therapy principles as a possible treatment for AD at 
different scales (protein, cells, animal).
PURPOSE: The present study focuses on a macroscopic scale and wants to propose 
an irradiation set-up for mice in the thermal column (TC) of the Triga Mark II 
reactor of Pavia University, in view of the forthcoming in vivo irradiation of 
healthy and transgenic AD mouse models.
METHODS: Monte Carlo simulations were carried out with the MCNP6 code to test 
different irradiation positions and study the least toxic treatment possible by 
modeling neutron shielding to preserve healthy tissue. A shielding prototype was 
built and tested by means of neutron activation measurements. A geometrical 
mouse model was developed with the aim of computing the dose-rates induced in 
each radiosensitive organ and thus to estimate possible irradiation times for 
future in vivo experiments.
RESULTS: The computational study showed that the safest irradiation condition 
involves placing the shielding 20 cm from the TC entrance and that the best 
performing shielding material is 6Li enriched lithium carbonate. Furthermore, 
taking into account the tolerance doses of each organ, the maximum animal 
irradiation time in an AD context is 45 min. The proposed set-up could also be 
used for preclinical studies on brain tumors; in this context, the maximum 
estimated irradiation time is 11 min.
CONCLUSION: The proposed work is pivotal in the study of a possible treatment 
for AD in a neutron irradiation context, paving the way for the next phase of 
the NECTAR project involving in vivo irradiation of AD mouse models and thus 
making it possible to assess its efficacy and its possible future extension to 
the human brain.

BACKGROUND: Neuroinflammation contributes to Parkinson's disease (PD) 
progression and motor dysfunction. Allogeneic human mesenchymal stem cells 
(allo-hMSCs) may reduce neuroinflammation and improve motor symptoms.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of repeated intravenous doses of 
10 × 106/kg allo-hMSCs in improving motor symptoms in patients with PD (PwP).
METHODS: In this phase 2, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (November 
2020-July 2023), mild-to-moderate PwP received either three allo-hMSC infusions, 
one placebo followed by two allo-hMSC infusions, or three placebo infusions at 
18-week intervals. Follow-up lasted 88 weeks. The primary outcome was a >70% 
posterior probability (PP) of a difference in the proportion of participants 
with ≥5-point improvement in OFF-medication Movement Disorder Society Sponsored 
Revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-Part III 
(MDS-UPDRS-III) at week 62. Bayesian analysis was conducted using R v4.2.0.
RESULTS: Forty-five PwP were enrolled. A larger proportion of subjects achieved 
a ≥5-point improvement in MDS-UPDRS-III in the three-infusion arm compared with 
placebo at week 62 (mean difference [MD]: 5.0%, PP = 93.7%), translating to a 
16.9-point improvement in MDS-UPDRS-III in the three-infusion arm compared with 
a 14.6-point improvement in the placebo arm. Conversely, fewer subjects in the 
two-infusion arm compared with placebo showed ≥5-point improvement at week 62 
(MD: -62.4%, PP ≥ 99.9%), translating to only a 3.9-point improvement in 
MDS-UPDRS-III in the two-infusion arm. However, improvement in MDS-UPDRS-III was 
seen across all treatment arms. Adverse events were mild and transient.
CONCLUSIONS: Three infusions of 10 × 106 allo-hMSCs/kg improved motor function 
in mild-to-moderate PwP, while two infusions showed less improvement than 
placebo. To address this discrepancy, future studies should conduct functional 
potency assays to understand batch-to-batch variability affecting clinical 
efficacy. © 2025 The Author(s). Movement Disorders published by Wiley

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology exhibits early 
accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques within the perforant pathway. This 
study explores how tenascin-R, a myelin-associated protein at nodes of Ranvier 
(NORs), modulates Aβ generation through Nav1.6 within this cortico-hippocampal 
circuit.
METHODS: We integrated genetic, electrophysiological, and microdialysis 
techniques in APP/PS1 mice and constructed tenascin-R gene fragments and GEDC 
motif to identify potential therapeutic sequences for AD treatment.
RESULTS: Stimulating the entorhinal cortex increased Aβ1-42 release along the 
perforant pathway through Nav-dependent mechanisms. Reducing tenascin-R 
decreased Aβ deposition and alleviated cognitive deficits. Overexpressing 
tenascin-R enhanced Nav1.6 currents and upregulated amyloid precursor protein 
and β-secretase. The GEDC motif within tenascin-R's epidermal growth factor-like 
domain controlled Nav1.6 activity.
DISCUSSION: Our findings demonstrate that NORs signaling modulates Aβ processing 
independently of synaptic mechanisms. Tenascin-R regulates Aβ pathogenesis via 
Nav1.6 at NORs, underscoring myelin proteins and Nav1.6 as therapeutic targets. 
The GEDC motif represents a potential peptide-based compound for AD therapy.
HIGHLIGHTS: Nodes of Ranvier-associated tenascin-R (Tn-R) regulate amyloid beta 
(Aβ) production in the perforant pathway of APP/PS1 mice. Tn-R enhances 
Nav1.6-mediated sodium currents, promoting amyloid precursor protein (APP) 
transcription and Aβ generation. Genetic downregulation of Tn-R mitigates Aβ 
deposition, restores synaptic integrity, and improves cognition. The conserved 
GEDC motif within Tn-R's epidermal growth factor-like domain is critical for 
modulating Nav1.6 activity and amyloidogenesis. The Tn-R/Nav1.6 axis represents 
a novel therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease, with GEDC-derived peptides 
offering translational potential.

The Keap1-Nrf2 pathway has emerged as a promising target for Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). This study employed in silico modeling to identify Nrf2 activators through 
Keap1 inhibition. The most promising quinazoline derivative, LMDP10, was then 
evaluated in a rat model of sporadic AD induced by Intracerebroventricular (ICV) 
streptozotocin (STZ). ICV STZ-induced rats were treated with LMDP10 (5-50 mg/kg, 
orally). Behavioral changes were assessed using the Morris water maze (MWM) and 
novel object recognition (NOR) tests. Additionally, neurochemical marker 
(oxidant/antioxidant), proinflammatory cytokine (TNF-α) levels, Nrf2 levels, and 
histopathological alterations were analyzed in both the hippocampus and cortex. 
An oral toxicity study of LMDP10 was performed according to the OECD Guideline 
425. LMDP10 treatment (50 mg/kg/day) significantly improved memory performance 
(increased percentage time spent in target quadrant in the MWM test and 
increased discrimination index in the NOR test; P < 0.001 for both). Notably, 
this dose also significantly increased Nrf2, SOD, and GSH levels while 
attenuating elevated MDA and TNF-α levels in both brain regions compared to 
those in vehicle-treated STZ rats. LMDP10 emerged as a potential therapeutic 
candidate for AD. LMDP10 improved memory function and increased Nrf2 signaling 
and antioxidant defenses while reducing neuroinflammation. These findings 
suggest that the neuroprotective effects of LMDP10 may involve Keap1-Nrf2 
pathway activation, warranting further investigation of its therapeutic 
potential in AD.

Alzheimer disease (AD) is a primary international health dilemma, especially in 
elderly populations, due to its progressive nature and its adverse cognitive 
impact. The dysfunction of lysosomes, which impairs protein degradation and 
leads to toxic accumulation in neurons, is a pivotal factor in AD. We explore 
phytochemicals that specifically target lysosomal dysfunction via the activation 
of autophagy, phagocytosis, and lysosome function, exhibiting anti-inflammatory 
and antioxidant properties. This study involves extracting and evaluating 
phytochemicals by exploring multiple databases, Google Scholar, PubMed, the 
Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE), and the China National Knowledge 
Infrastructure (CNKI), integrating contemporary biochemical evidence with TCM 
principles-highlighting the interconnected roles of deficiency, stasis, and 
phlegm-to provide a comprehensive therapeutic framework. Key 
phytochemicals-magnolol, trehalose, and salidroside- demonstrate notable promise 
in enhancing lysosomal function, reducing amyloid beta accumulation, and 
improving cognitive outcomes. Addressing traditional theory and modern science, 
we underline the potential for future research by clarifying the mechanisms of 
compounds and their effectiveness, which may delay the disease process.

The apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) allele is the strongest genetic risk factor for 
late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), associated with early brain metabolic 
dysfunction and gut microbiome alterations. Targeting these early changes 
through dietary interventions may reduce AD risk in asymptomatic carriers. This 
study evaluated whether a ketogenic diet (KD) could reshape the gut microbiome 
and enhance key brain metabolite levels in young APOE4 mice, using APOE3 mice as 
a neutral-risk comparison. Male and female APOE3 and APOE4 mice were fed either 
a control diet or KD for 16 weeks, starting at 12 weeks of age. We used shotgun 
metagenomics and targeted brain metabolomics to identify microbe-metabolite 
signatures linked to neuroprotection. KD increased beneficial species such as 
Lactobacillus johnsonii and Lactobacillus reuteri while reducing pathogenic 
Bacteroides intestinalis. These microbial shifts correlated with improved brain 
metabolites related to mitochondrial function, neurotransmitter balance, redox 
homeostasis, and lipid metabolism. Notably, Lactobacillus species and 
B. intestinalis exhibited inverse correlations with key brain metabolite levels, 
suggesting their roles as both modulators and biomarkers of brain health. APOE4 
females showed the greatest benefits, including restored microbiome diversity 
and normalization of brain metabolite levels. In contrast, APOE3 mice showed 
microbiome changes but limited brain metabolic responses. These findings 
highlight KD's potential to reprogram the gut-brain axis in a genotype- and 
sex-dependent manner, supporting its use as a precision nutrition strategy to 
reduce AD risk, particularly in asymptomatic female APOE4 carriers.

Understanding how amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques develop and lead to neurotoxicity in 
Alzheimer's disease remains a major challenge, particularly given the temporal 
delay and weak correlation between plaque deposition and cognitive decline. This 
study investigates how the evolving pathology of plaques affects the surrounding 
tissue, using a knock-in Aβ mouse model (AppNL-F/NL-F). We combined mass 
spectrometry imaging with stable isotope labeling to timestamp Aβ plaques from 
the moment of their initial deposition, enabling us to track their aging 
spatially. By integrating spatial transcriptomics, we linked changes in gene 
expression to the age of the plaques, independent of the mice's chronological 
age or disease stage. Here we show that older plaques were associated with 
reduced expression of synaptic genes. Additionally, when correlated with 
structure-specific dyes, we show that plaque age positively correlated with 
structural maturation. These more compact and older plaques were linked to 
greater synapse loss and increased toxicity.

Protein amyloid aggregation is a critical pathological process implicated in 
nearly 50 amyloid-related diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's 
diseases. This review highlights the potential of sulfonamides, a versatile 
class of compounds recognized for their diverse pharmacological properties, as 
modulators of protein aggregation. We provide an overview of studies examining 
the efficacy of sulfonamide derivatives in inhibiting the aggregation of various 
amyloidogenic proteins, including amyloid-beta, tau, alpha-synuclein, insulin, 
and transthyretin. In vitro assays, such as Thioflavin T fluorescence and 
high-resolution imaging techniques, have shown that certain sulfonamides can 
significantly inhibit fibril formation and promote the stabilization of 
non-aggregated protein states. The potential for sulfonamides to serve as 
multi-target agents offers new avenues for therapeutic development. By 
integrating findings from current research, we support a proposal that 
sulfonamide-based compounds could play a pivotal role in addressing the 
multifaceted nature of amyloid-related neurodegenerative diseases, paving the 
way for innovative therapeutic strategies.

Many of the drugs used in treatment today have been designed based on the 
"specificity paradigm". Resistance has developed against drugs designed using 
this approach, leading to a decrease in their effectiveness. In addition, it is 
well-documented in the literature that diseases with complex etiologies, such as 
Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and cancer are influenced by multiple genetic and/or 
environmental factors. As a result, specificity paradigm is often insufficient 
for treating these diseases. Therefore, there is a need to develop drugs that 
interact with multiple targets simultaneously through different mechanisms. This 
review aims to provide an overview of the methods used in multitarget drug 
design, the reactions employed in the synthesis of these drugs, their 
applications, and recent research conducted in this field.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by cognitive decline and memory impairment. Amyloid-beta (Aβ) 
peptide accumulation is one of the most important chatacteristics of AD that 
cause neuronal damage and neuroinflammation. Thymoquinone (TQ), a bioactive 
compound derived from Nigella sativa, has shown neuroprotective properties in 
previous studies. This study aimed to evaluate the ameliorative effects of TQ in 
an Aβ1-42-induced AD rat model. Male Wistar-Albino rats were divided into four 
groups: Control, AD, TQ-10 (10 mg/kg TQ), and TQ-30 (30 mg/kg TQ). TQ was 
administered orally for 7 days before and 10 days after Aβ1-42 injection into 
the hippocampus. Cognitive functions were assessed using the Passive Avoidance 
(PA) and Morris Water Maze (MWM) tests. After behavioral experiments, 
hippocampal cytokine (tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-1 beta 
(IL-1β)) levels, as well as astrocyte and microglial activation, are evaluated. 
TQ treatment reversed memory impairements in the AD group. Hippocampal TNF-α and 
IL-1β levels were elevated in the AD and reduced in TQ-treated groups. 
Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the increased reactivity of glial 
fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 
(Iba1) in the AD group was significantly attenuated by TQ treatment. Both 
10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg doses of TQ administration improved cognitive performance, 
reduced neuroinflammation, and mitigated glial activation in an Aβ-induced AD 
rat model. These findings suggest that TQ may serve as a promising 
neuroprotective agent for AD. Further studies are required to elucidate its 
molecular mechanisms and therapeutic potential in clinical settings.

Neurodegenerative disease represents a significant public health concern, with 
conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, being among the 
most prevalent. The primary risk factor for these neurodegenerative diseases is 
the process of aging. Key factors, such as oxidative stress and mitochondrial 
dysfunction, play a crucial role in initiating neurodegeneration. The 
progressive deterioration and neuronal loss in both the central and peripheral 
nervous systems are hallmark features of neurodegenerative diseases. 
Plant-derived natural products and their bioactive components, such as curcumin, 
resveratrol, genistein, marine algae, quercetin, apigenin, and luteolin, have 
shown promise as therapeutic agents for treating neurodegenerative diseases. 
There are various medications approved for the management of neurodegenerative 
diseases; their usage is primarily limited to providing symptomatic relief. The 
utilization of natural products holds significant promise for the prevention and 
treatment of neurodegenerative diseases (ND). The review provides evidence that 
natural products and their bioactive compounds could be beneficial in the 
treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. This article delineates the 
Keap1-Nrf2-ARE pathway's role in ND progression, shedding light on the 
therapeutic efficacy of natural products and their bioactive constituents that 
have demonstrated neuroprotective properties.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative "memory killer" demanding urgent 
global intervention, has long been shrouded in mystery regarding its core 
pathological mechanisms. Although the traditional amyloid-β (Aβ) hypothesis 
remains dominant, recent groundbreaking research has revealed that early 
activation of aberrant calcium (Ca2⁺) signaling pathways serves as the 
"initiating trigger" of AD pathogenesis-preceding even the formation of 
classical Aβ plaques-a discovery that fundamentally overturns the existing 
cognitive framework. This study systematically deconstructs, for the first time, 
the cascading regulatory network of the Ca2⁺/CaM-CaMKII signaling axis in AD 
pathology, elucidating its potential links with core AD mechanisms, including 
the Aβ hypothesis, tau hyperphosphorylation, Ca2⁺ dyshomeostasis, synaptic 
dysfunction, and neuronal loss. Furthermore, this pathway not only 
triggers neurotoxic cascades through spatiotemporally specific regulation of 
synaptic Ca2⁺ overload but also directly disrupts neuroplasticity-the physical 
basis of memory encoding-by reshaping the dynamic equilibrium between long-term 
potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD).Crucially, the research 
uncovers the dual role of CaMKII as a "molecular switch": while physiologically 
maintaining memory consolidation via Thr286 autophosphorylation, its 
pathological overactivation due to Ca2⁺ dyshomeostasis leads to a "memory 
solidification-toxicity cycle." These findings establish a theoretical 
foundation for developing innovative therapies based on precise calcium 
signaling modulation-including Ca2⁺ homeostasis intervention and CaMKII 
allosteric modulators-offering a potential breakthrough in overcoming the 
long-standing limitation of "symptom relief without targeting root causes" in AD 
treatment.

BackgroundAssessing amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition in individuals with mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) is critical for early Alzheimer's disease (AD) intervention. 
The Visual Cognitive Assessment Test (VCAT), a language-neutral visual-based 
tool, effectively identifies MCI, but its correlation with Aβ pathology remains 
unverified.ObjectiveThis study aimed to evaluate the ability of VCAT to 
distinguish between amyloid-positive (Aβ+) and amyloid-negative (Aβ-) people 
with different cognitive status and compare its performance with the Montreal 
Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).MethodsIn this cross-sectional analysis conducted at 
the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, 139 cognitively normal 
(CN) individuals and 231 patients with MCI were enrolled. Participants underwent 
baseline data registration, VCAT, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), 
Mini-Mental State Examination, Clinical Dementia Rating, amyloid PET 
assessments, and MRI scans. The main outcome measures considered the ability of 
the VCAT to distinguish between amyloid-positive and amyloid-negative MCI 
patients, as indicated by the area under the curve (AUC) values.ResultsVCAT and 
MoCA showed comparable efficacy in differentiating MCI from CN. For Aβ 
deposition discrimination, VCAT showed numerically higher accuracy than MoCA for 
detecting Aβ+ MCI (AUC 0.830 versus 0.797; sensitivity 72.7% versus 66.7%). 
VCAT's discriminative ability relied on memory and executive function domains. 
Shortened VCAT versions demonstrated reduced efficacy compared to the full 
VCAT.ConclusionsVCAT correlates well with PET-detected Aβ deposition and shows 
marginally superior performance to MoCA in identifying Aβ+ MCI. However, 
abbreviated VCAT versions are less effective for Aβ detection in MCI, 
highlighting the need for full-test administration in clinical practice.

The gamma secretase (GS) enzyme controls cell-cell adhesion, neural stem cell 
proliferation, neo-angiogenesis, spinal maturation, and metabolism of amyloid 
precursor proteins (APP). Pathological production of abnormal amyloid-beta 
isoforms and senile plaques serves as the basis for pathogenesis of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). GS enzyme inhibitors such as semagacestat and avagacestat were 
explored in AD but the studies were paused because of adverse events attributed 
to their influence on the Notch pathway.Crosstalk between Notch and Wnt 
signaling pathways created a potential role for GS inhibitors in the treatment 
of malignancies such as glioblastoma multiforme, pancreatic, and breast cancers. 
In a phase I study on nirogacestat among refractory solid malignancies, overall 
response rate (ORR) of 71.4% was observed in desmoid tumor (DT). The pivotal 
DeFi phase III trial established superiority of nirogacestat in terms of 
progression-free survival and ORR, reducing the likelihood of progression by 
71%. Emphasis was placed on patient-reported outcomes (PRO) including the 
DT-specific tool, GOunder/Desmoid Tumor Research Foundation DEsmoid Symptom 
Scale (GODDESS).Nirogacestat received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
approval in November 2023 and European Commission approval in August 2025 for 
adults with progressing desmoid tumors (DT) who require systemic treatment. 
Further studies are underway to investigate other GS inhibitors such as AL-102 
in the management of DT.

Plain Language Summary: The role of the enzyme gamma secretase (GS) was 
discovered in various processes of adhesion between various cells, formation of 
blood vessels and development of new nerve systems. This enzyme has been found 
to have a role in the onset and worsening of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), which is 
a type of dementia. Some clinical trials examined if GS-inhibiting drugs could 
help in the treatment of AD but were not pursued further due to significant side 
effects. However, in another study, it was discovered that the same class of 
medications was able to act against the rare disease known as desmoid tumor 
(DT). One of these drugs, nirogacestat, was initially examined in a small study 
which included patients with various cancers, including DT. The patients in this 
study had different types of cancers which had failed previous treatments. Among 
these patients, those with DT experienced good treatment outcome with 71.4% 
showing reduction in size of the tumor using nirogacestat. Being a rare disease, 
conducting trials with a greater number of patients was difficult in DT because 
of various reasons such as patients being scattered across countries, doctors 
being unaware of treatment options and the lesser efforts from the 
pharmaceutical industry. The patient advocacy group Desmoid Tumor Research 
Foundation (DTRF) came to the fore to help overcome these difficulties and act 
as a platform for the patients and physicians to help in collaborations and 
conduct further studies. Encouraging findings were obtained and finally the 
pivotal clinical trial (DeFi study) which demonstrated that nirogacestat was a 
new, superior treatment option for DT. Nirogacestat also improved the quality of 
life of the enrolled patients, which is an important factor in chronic diseases 
such as DT. The results of this study paved the way for the Food and Drugs 
Administration (FDA) approval of nirogacestat in the management of DT. We 
present the journey of these GS inhibitors, from the biological aspect to its 
role in the treatment of DT.

OBJECTIVE: Because of the complexity of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) clinical 
presentations across bio-psycho-social domains of functioning, data-reduction 
approaches, such as latent profile analysis (LPA), can be useful for studying 
profiles rather than individual symptoms. Previous LPA research has resulted in 
more precise characterization and understanding of patients, better clarity 
regarding the probability and rate of disease progression, and an empirical 
approach to identifying those who might benefit most from early intervention. 
Whereas previous LPA research has revealed useful cognitive, neuropsychiatric, 
or functional subtypes of patients with AD, no study has identified patient 
profiles that span the domains of health and functioning and that also include 
motor and sensory functioning.
METHODS: LPA was conducted with data from the Advancing Reliable Measurement in 
Alzheimer's Disease and cognitive Aging study. Participants were 209 older 
adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) or mild dementia of the 
Alzheimer's type (DAT). LPA indicator variables were from the NIH Toolbox® and 
included cognitive, emotional, social, motor, and sensory domains of 
functioning.
RESULTS: The data were best modeled with a 4-profile solution. The latent 
profiles were most differentiated by indices of social and emotional functioning 
and least differentiated by motor and sensory function.
CONCLUSIONS: These multi-domain patient profiles support and extend previous 
findings on single-domain profiles and highlight the importance of social and 
emotional factors for understanding patient experiences of aMCI/DAT. Future 
research should investigate these profiles further to better understand risk and 
resilience factors, the stability of these profiles over time, and responses to 
intervention.

Early diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
with mild dementia is becoming increasingly important to enable patients to 
receive appropriate treatment with available amyloid-targeting therapies. 
Reviews of AD prevalence and diagnostic and treatment patterns typically focus 
on global or western populations, but the situation in Asia, Australasia, and 
Pacific Nations (AAPN) countries is less clear. We performed a narrative review 
of literature for AD in several AAPN countries, focusing on patients with MCI or 
mild dementia who may benefit from early treatment. Published information 
regarding AD incidence and prevalence and current practice in AAPN countries is 
limited and the nature of available information differs between countries. 
However, AAPN countries include some of the most rapidly aging populations and 
show the associated increasing trend of all-cause dementia prevalence observed 
globally. Although lecanemab and donanemab are now approved for AD with MCI and 
mild dementia in several AAPN countries, the most appropriate diagnostic pathway 
for patients with MCI and early AD is not established. Even though the AAPN 
region includes countries with routine access to advanced technologies, concerns 
have already been raised about the ability of healthcare systems in Australia, 
New Zealand, and Korea to respond to approvals of new AD therapies, including 
the need to ensure availability of biomarker testing and dementia specialists to 
allow patients to receive the early diagnosis required to enable appropriate 
treatment. Guidelines and national policies also need updating to differentiate 
between dementia subtypes and include amyloid-targeting therapies for eligible 
patients with early AD.

Microplastic (MP) pollution has become a global environmental issue, but its 
potential health effect remains unknown. We aimed to investigate the effect of 
oral administration of polystyrene nanoplastics (PSNPs) on brain functions and 
behaviors. Five-week-old Sprague Dawley male rats were given 50 nm PSNPs orally 
at doses of 10 or 50 mg/kg thrice per week for four weeks. At 9-week-old after 
completion of oral exposure, novel object recognition test and open field test 
were performed. The hippocampus from each rat was collected to detect 
neurological, immunological, and antioxidative stress markers using ELISA, 
real-time RT-PCR and immunohistochemical analyses. High-dose PSNP-treated rats 
showed decreased exploration time with a novel object, and reduced entry time 
and time spent in the center. Increased glutamate concentration, decreased 
glutamate receptor NMDA subunits (NR1, NR2B) and transcription factors CREB1 and 
CaMKIV mRNAs and increased cFos and early growth response 1, reduced 
postsynaptic density protein-95, synaptophysin mRNAs, were observed in high-dose 
PSNP-treated rats. Moreover, antioxidative stress markers such as superoxide 
dismutase and catalase were significantly decreased whereas inflammatory 
cytokines (interleukin 1β, tumor necrosis factor-α) and microglial marker 
(ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1) were significantly higher in 
high-dose PSNP-treated rats. Our results indicate oral exposure to PSNPs induced 
anxiety-like behavior and learning, memory impairment by altering 
neuron-glia-immune cells interaction at synaptic regions in the rat hippocampus. 
This study would be helpful to understand the association between MP pollution 
and increasing neurological disorders like dementia, anxiety, and Alzheimer's 
disease in humans.

[Application of neural organoids containing microglia to neurodegenerative 
disease research].

[Article in Japanese]

In recent years, the "translational gap" has become problematic in drug 
development, wherein promising results from animal experiments and in vitro 
tests fail to demonstrate the expected efficacy and safety in clinical trials. 
This translational gap has also impacted on the development of therapeutic 
agents for brain diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). While microglia, 
which are immune cells in the brain, have gained attention as therapeutic 
targets of AD, the inter-species difference in microglia between humans and 
experimental model animals may cause this gap. To reveal the pathogenic 
mechanisms of AD and develop a therapeutic strategy, experimental models that 
appropriately reproduce pathological conditions using human-derived materials 
are required. Pluripotent stem cells can differentiate into various cells such 
as neurons and microglia. Therefore, it is expected that the creation of neural 
organoids from human pluripotent stem cells will enable the construction of a 
human-based analysis system that can reproduce three-dimensional brain 
structures and intercellular interactions, thereby overcoming the translational 
gap. Furthermore, combining patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells and 
gene editing technology with neural organoid technology is leading to 
cutting-edge research. In this review, we introduce global research trends aimed 
at developing neural organoids containing microglia derived from human 
pluripotent stem cells and applying them to elucidate the pathogenesis and to 
develop therapeutic drugs for AD.

More than half of chronic methamphetamine (METH) users exhibit multi-domain 
cognitive deficits, including impaired attention, executive function, and 
memory. MRI studies consistently demonstrate hippocampal atrophy and 
frontotemporal cortical thinning; these structural changes spatially overlap 
with glial activation, indicating the coexistence of morphological damage and 
ongoing neuroinflammation. To clarify causality, we developed a mouse model in 
which low-dose METH is micro-infused into the nucleus accumbens. The mice 
displayed cognitive dysfunction and hippocampal long-term potentiation deficits 
together with microglial activation and mRNA up-regulation of IL-1β and the 
complement component C1q. Suppressing microglial activation with minocycline 
normalized these soluble factors and restored cognitive function. Complement 
proteins drive microglia-mediated synaptic pruning, and their over-activation 
has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. Taken together, 
our findings suggest that METH-induced cognitive impairment is mediated by 
abnormal microglial pruning via complement signaling. This review summarizes the 
clinical phenotype of METH-related cognitive dysfunction, integrates preclinical 
findings, and proposes novel therapeutic avenues that target microglial 
activation.

[Insulin signaling and neuropathological changes in Alzheimer's disease].

[Article in Japanese]

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and the 
leading cause of dementia. Its pathological features include abnormal 
aggregation of amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau proteins, neuronal loss, and brain 
atrophy. The "amyloid hypothesis" suggests that Aβ accumulation triggers disease 
progression, leading to the development of anti-Aβ antibody therapies. However, 
their effectiveness is limited once dementia has developed, highlighting the 
need for early intervention in the preclinical stage. This review focuses on 
type 2 diabetes (T2D) and insulin resistance as acquired risk factors for AD, 
summarizing epidemiological and experimental evidence on their impact on AD 
neuropathology. While early postmortem studies produced inconsistent results 
regarding the association between T2D, insulin resistance, and Aβ deposition, 
recent amyloid PET imaging studies have clarified this relationship in the human 
brain. Additionally, animal studies suggest that diet-induced insulin resistance 
promotes Aβ accumulation. Conversely, genetic disruption of insulin signaling 
molecules significantly suppresses Aβ pathology. These seemingly contradictory 
findings suggest that while reduced brain insulin signaling may inhibit Aβ 
pathology, peripheral metabolic disturbances associated with worsening insulin 
resistance may accelerate Aβ deposition. Understanding the multifaceted roles of 
insulin signaling and the molecular basis of these complex interactions is 
crucial for identifying new preventive and disease-modifying therapeutic 
targets. Advancing this knowledge is essential for developing innovative AD 
treatments.

[Aβ Receptor PirB and its regulation by LOTUS].

[Article in Japanese]

of Medicine.

Over the years, research has accumulated a vast amount of knowledge about the 
pathogenesis of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, 
fundamental treatments for AD have not yet been established. In this article, we 
discuss an Aβ receptor, paired immunoglobulin like receptor B (PirB) and its 
endogenous regulator lateral olfactory tract usher substance (LOTUS), which are 
completely different novel drug target from existing drugs, and the possibility 
of endogenous inhibitors of PirB. PirB expressed in neurons is a negative 
regulator of neuronal plasticity, as loss or inhibition of PirB increases 
neuronal plasticity, leading to increased spine density and improved cognitive 
function. Furthermore, PirB is known to function as a receptor for Aβ, leading 
to reduced neuronal plasticity and cell death. These findingss suggest that PirB 
can be positioned as a novel drug target for the treatment of AD. The neuronal 
circuit-forming factor LOTUS, which binds to PirB and functions as an endogenous 
antagonist, has been shown to inhibit the neurotoxic effects of Aβ mediated by 
PirB. Namely, LOTUS is an endogenous molecule that inhibits Aβ receptor function 
of PirB and may have medicinal effects against Aβ pathology.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common degenerative disease of the nervous 
system. Studies have found that the 40 Hz pulsed magnetic field has the effect 
of improving cognitive ability in AD, but the mechanism of action is not clear. 
In this study, APP/PS1 double transgenic AD model mice were used as the research 
object, the water maze was used to group dementia, and 40 Hz/10 mT pulsed 
magnetic field stimulation was applied to AD model mice with different degrees 
of dementia. The behavioral indicators, mitochondrial samples of hippocampal CA1 
region and electrocardiogram signals were collected from each group, and the 
effects of 40 Hz pulsed magnetic field on mouse behavior, mitochondrial kinetic 
indexes and heart rate variability (HRV) parameters were analyzed. The results 
showed that compared with the AD group, the loss of mitochondrial crest 
structure was alleviated and the mitochondrial dynamics related indexes were 
significantly improved in the AD + stimulated group ( P < 0.001), sympathetic 
nerve excitation and parasympathetic nerve inhibition were improved, and the 
spatial cognitive memory ability of mice was significantly improved ( P < 0.05). 
The preliminary results of this study show that 40 Hz pulsed magnetic field 
stimulation can improve the mitochondrial structure and mitochondrial kinetic 
homeostasis imbalance of AD mice, and significantly improve the autonomic 
neuromodulation ability and spatial cognition ability of AD mice, which lays a 
foundation for further exploring the mechanism of ultra-low frequency magnetic 
field in delaying the course of AD disease and realizing personalized 
neurofeedback therapy for AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) was first described over a century ago. However, the 
mechanisms underlying the disease are not well understood to this day. This has 
negatively impacted our ability to create animal models to design and test 
targeted reliable treatments for the disease. Amyloid β plaque accumulation, 
aggregation of neurofibrillary tangles, neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, 
and, of course, cognitive decline, are few of the many observed pathological 
features associated with AD. However, there is a concern that the animal models 
of AD that are based on these frameworks may not be accurately representing AD 
in people. As such, the results from preclinical trials have not historically 
translated well to the clinic. In this article, we review the current major 
hypotheses to describe AD; we outline the major strengths and weaknesses of the 
commonly used rodent models used to replicate features of these hypotheses; and 
we provide a strategy for the field for future research.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Huanshaodan (HSD) is a Traditional Chinese 
Medicine Compound Prescription, traditionally used in the clinical treatment of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) in China. Nevertheless, its bioactive constituents and 
mechanistic basis remain poorly understood.
AIM OF THE STUDY: To identify the components derived from HSD that inhibit SIRT2 
and investigate the underlying mechanisms in mitigating AD pathogenesis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A luciferase reporter gene assay was employed to screen 
HSD for components that downregulate SIRT2 expression. The neuroprotective 
effects and the mechanisms of the screened component, ferulic acid (FA), was 
evaluated both in SAMP8 mice and HT22-APPswe cell using behavioral tests, H&E, 
immunohistochemistry, transmission electron microscopy, ELISA, MTT, Western 
blot, RT-qPCR, immunofluorescence and Co-immunoprecipitation, to assess its 
effect on SIRT2 expression, SIRT2-APP interaction, as well as the expression of 
proteins associated with APP proteolytic processing. SIRT2-overexpressing 
plasmids were transfected to assess FA's neuroprotection via SIRT2 modulation.
RESULTS: As a component in HSD, FA inhibited SIRT2 promoter-driven 
transcription, ameliorated cognitive deficits, protected neuronal and synaptic 
structures, reduced Aβ deposition in SAMP8 mice and Aβ level in HT22-APPswe 
cells. FA suppressed SIRT2 expression, inhibited SIRT2-APP interaction, 
modulated the expression levels of proteins involved in APP proteolytic 
processing, namely ADAM10, sAPPα, BACE1, sAPPβ, and CTFα in vitro and in vivo. 
Notably, the regulatory effects of FA on APP proteolytic processing in 
HT22-APPswe cells were completely abolished upon SIRT2 overexpression.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that FA is an active component in HSD that 
mitigates AD pathology, potentially by modulating APP proteolytic processing 
through SIRT2 downregulation.

Amyloid-β (Aβ), a key driver of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, possesses 
diverse harmful and clearance-resistant structures that present substantial 
challenges to therapeutic development. Here, we demonstrate that modulating Aβ 
morphology, rather than Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)-dependent microglia 
activation, is essential for effective phagocytosis of Aβ species by microglia. 
By developing a bifunctional mechanistic probe (P2CSKn) designed to remodel Aβ 
and activate TLR2, we show it restructures soluble Aβ (sAβ) and fibrillar Aβ 
(fAβ) into less toxic hybrid aggregates (hPAβ). Critically, this structural 
remodeling protects microglia from Aβ toxicity while enabling robust 
phagocytosis. Moreover, although TLR2 activation mildly enhances Aβ uptake, it 
concurrently triggers detrimental inflammation that negates its benefits. Our 
findings establish morphological remodeling as the critical determinant of 
effective Aβ clearance and suggest a morphology-focused strategy for developing 
safe therapeutics for Aβ-related diseases.

BACKGROUND: The dual burden of diabetes and Alzheimer's highlights the urgent 
need for multifunctional therapeutic agents. This study explores 
piperonal-derived Schiff base derivatives as potential dual-action enzyme 
inhibitors against α-amylase (AA), α-glucosidase (AG), acetylcholinesterase 
(AChE), and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), offers a promising strategy for 
managing both conditions.
METHODS: Schiff base derivatives of piperonal (heliotropin) were synthesized, 
structurally characterized, and explored against established drug targets of 
diabetes mellitus (DM) and Alzheimer's disease (AD).
RESULTS: Compounds 7 (IC50 = 5.73 ± 0.01; 3.52 ± 0.02 µM) and 17 
(IC50 = 10.91 ± 0.02; 7.38 ± 0.02 µM) showed potent inhibitory effects against 
AG and AA enzymes, in comparison to acarbose (IC50 = 14.98 ± 0.02 µM; 
14.64 ± 0.02 µM). However, analogs 7, 9, 10, 14, and 15, compounds 7 
(IC50 = 2.92 ± 0.02; 3.34 ± 0.02 µM) and 9 (IC50 = 8.16 ± 0.03; 7.19 ± 0.03 µM) 
showed remarkable inhibitory results against AChE and BChE, respectively, 
compared to standard donepezil chloride (IC50 = 37.89 ± 0.02 µM; 
41.56 ± 0.03 µM). Comprehensive kinetic analyses and molecular docking supported 
findings by in vitro studies. Synthesized derivatives were also checked for 
their antioxidant potential and demonstrated significant activity.
CONCLUSION: These complementary studies highlight several hit candidates for 
further development as therapeutic agents against DM and AD.

INTRODUCTION: Plasma biomarkers' utility for predicting incident mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) remains unclear. We evaluated associations of plasma 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers and amyloid positron emission tomography 
(PET) with transitions from cognitively unimpaired (CU) to MCI in the Mayo 
Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA) and BioFINDER-2 studies.
METHODS: Associations of continuous baseline plasma biomarker levels and amyloid 
PET Centiloid with progression to MCI, adjusting for age, sex, and education, 
were evaluated with Cox proportional hazards models.
RESULTS: The study included 381 MCSA and 584 BioFINDER-2 participants. Amyloid 
PET and percent phosphorylated to non-phosphorylated tau217 (%p-tau217) were 
strong predictors of progression to MCI in both cohorts: hazard ratios of 1.49 
and 1.23 in the MCSA and 1.72 and 1.65 in BioFINDER, respectively. Amyloid beta 
42/40 was a significant predictor in BioFINDER-2 only (hazard ratio 2.20).
DISCUSSION: Plasma %p-tau217 was associated with progression from CU to MCI in 
both cohorts, although differences in biomarker associations may be related to 
differences in the two cohorts.
HIGHLIGHTS: Mass-spectrometry-based plasma phosphorylated tau217 was associated 
with cognitively unimpaired to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) progression. 
Plasma amyloid beta 42/40 was a significant predictor in BioFINDER but not the 
Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA). Amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) 
was the strongest predictor of progression to MCI in the MCSA. Plasma had added 
value to amyloid PET in BioFINDER but not the MCSA. Biomarker performance may 
vary with cohort and biomarker measurement differences.
