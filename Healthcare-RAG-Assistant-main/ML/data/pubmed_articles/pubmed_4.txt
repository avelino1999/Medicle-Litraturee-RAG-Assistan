BackgroundAlzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by cognitive decline, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress. 
Current treatments are largely symptomatic, necessitating novel neuroprotective 
strategies.ObjectiveThis study aimed to investigate the anti-inflammatory and 
antioxidant effects of chitosan-cannabidiol (CS-CBD) nanoparticles in a 
streptozotocin (STZ)-induced rat model of AD.MethodsSixty male Wistar rats were 
randomly divided into five groups: control, AD model (STZ-induced), 
chitosan-treated, cannabidiol-treated, and CS-CBD-treated. AD was induced by 
intracerebroventricular injection of STZ (3 mg/kg). Treatments were administered 
intranasally for 21 days. Cognitive performance was assessed using the Morris 
water maze. After treatment, oxidative stress markers (NO, FRAP), liver enzymes 
(ALT, AST), and the expression of inflammatory and neuroprotective genes (IL1β, 
IL6, IL10, iNOS, PPARγ, BDNF) were evaluated by real-time PCR. Histological 
analysis of the hippocampus was also performed. Data were analyzed using one-way 
ANOVA and Tukey's post hoc test (p < 0.05).ResultsThe AD group showed 
significant impairments in memory and learning (p < 0.0001), increased oxidative 
stress, and upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes (IL1β, iNOS), with decreased 
neuroprotective markers (BDNF, PPARγ). CS-CBD treatment significantly improved 
cognitive function (p < 0.001), restored oxidative balance, reduced IL1β and 
iNOS expression, and elevated BDNF and PPARγ expression (p < 0.05). Histological 
analysis confirmed reduced neuronal degeneration and increased neuronal density 
in the CS-CBD group.ConclusionsCS-CBD nanoparticles exerted potent 
neuroprotective, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects in an STZ-induced 
rat model of AD. These findings support the potential of CS-CBD nanoparticles as 
a promising adjunctive therapy for AD, warranting further investigation.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to examine differences in Instrumental 
Activities of Daily Living (IADL) among young-onset dementia (YOD) diagnoses.
METHODS: Participants were included from Amsterdam Dementia and Longitudinal 
Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease (LEADS) cohorts, with diagnoses of typical 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), 
primary progressive aphasia (PPA), posterior cortical atrophy (PCA), or dementia 
with Lewy bodies (DLB) established in multidisciplinary meetings. We compared 
overall IADL scores and item level scores between groups using multiple 
regression analyses, adjusted for cohort, demographics, and disease severity.
RESULTS: We included 582 YOD patients (58.4 ± 4.2 years; 59%F), with overall 
moderate IADL problems (47.5 ± 8.57). DLB patients showed the most IADL 
difficulties (41.8 ± 7.8) compared to PCA, typical AD, bvFTD, and PPA (adjusted 
β range 4.62 to 14.14, all p < 0.01), whereas PPA patients showed the least IADL 
difficulties (55.8 ± 9.83), with item-specific differences.
CONCLUSION: We found differences in everyday functioning between YOD types. 
Understanding IADL in YOD types will assist in care planning.
HIGHLIGHTS: Patients with DLB showed the most IADL difficulties compared to PCA, 
typical AD, bvFTD, and PPA Patients with PPA showed the least IADL difficulties 
compared to DLB, PCA, typical AD, and bvFTD We identified diagnostic 
group-specific activity challenges. While 'working' was among the most commonly 
impaired activities across al groups, distinct functional challenges emerged per 
diagnosis: for example, DLB had high impairment in financial tasks, PCA patients 
in visual-spatial tasks, and bvFTD with planning and organizational activities 
(e.g. making appointments).

Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is characterized by 
progressive cognitive decline and neuropathological hallmarks, including 
amyloid-beta plaques and tau tangles. Emerging evidence implicates metabolic 
dysfunction as a critical contributor to the pathogenesis and pro-gression of 
AD. Impaired glucose metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, 
and lipid dysregulation are frequently observed in AD brains, suggesting that 
metabolic dysfunction may exacerbate neurodegeneration and cognitive deficits. 
This review explores the therapeutic potential of targeting met-abolic pathways 
to mitigate AD pathology. Key metabolic disruptions, including insulin 
resistance, re-duced cerebral glucose utilization, and mitochondrial 
inefficiency, are closely linked to neuronal energy deficits and synaptic 
dysfunction. Therapeutic approaches, such as insulin sensitizers, ketogenic 
diets, and mitochondrial-targeted antioxidants, have shown promise in 
preclinical and early clinical studies. Addi-tionally, strategies to modulate 
lipid metabolism, such as enhancing cholesterol efflux via APOE or re-ducing 
neurotoxic ceramides, offer potential avenues for intervention. The review also 
highlights the roles of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress as mediators of 
metabolic dysfunction in AD, underscoring the need for multifaceted approaches 
that target both metabolic and inflammatory pathways. The emerging field of 
precision medicine offers opportunities to tailor interventions based on 
individual metabolic pro-files, potentially enhancing treatment efficacy. 
Despite the growing recognition of metabolic dysfunction in AD, translating 
these insights into effective therapies remains challenging due to the disease's 
com-plexity and heterogeneity. Future research must focus on elucidating the 
interplay between metabolic pathways and AD pathology, identifying reliable 
biomarkers, and designing targeted interventions. By addressing the metabolic 
underpinnings of AD, this review underscores the potential of metabolic 
repro-gramming as a novel and integrative therapeutic strategy to slow or 
prevent disease progression and im-prove patient outcomes.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with a 
complex genetic basis involving both rare mutations and common variants. This 
review provides a comprehensive synthesis of established and emerging genetic 
risk factors implicated in AD pathogenesis. Mendelian forms are strongly 
associated with mutations in APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2, whereas the APOE ε4 allele 
remains the most robust genetic risk factor for late-onset AD. Recent Genome- 
Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have uncovered additional susceptibility loci, 
including TREM2, CLU, ABCA7, and SORL1, which reflect diverse biological 
pathways such as amyloid metabolism, lipid regulation, and immune response. The 
review also highlights the roles of epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA 
methylation and histone modifications, as well as geneenvironment interactions 
in modulating disease risk and progression. Although substantial progress has 
been made in identifying genetic contributors, translating these findings into 
clinical applications remains challenging. This article underscores the need for 
integrative, multi-omic approaches and population-diverse studies to enhance 
risk prediction and enable personalized interventions for prevention and therapy 
in AD.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease poses a major challenge as a widespread and 
fatal neurodegenerative disorder, primarily affecting the elderly population 
worldwide.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the potential protective and therapeutic 
effects of virgin olive oil and tiger nut essential oil on Alzheimer's dementia 
in male rats while also analyzing serum biomarker gene expression profiles in 
both Alzheimer's and control groups.
METHODS: Rats were fed basal diets supplemented with 5% virgin olive oil or 
tiger nut essential oil, along with high-fat meals containing trans fats, butter 
(25%), margarine (25%), and hydrogenated shorten oils (25%) to evaluate lipid 
profiles and serum biomarkers. Gene expression analysis revealed a significant 
upregulation of acetylcholinesterase, P53, BCL2, Mouse ICAM-1, PSEN, and BACE 
genes in the Alzheimer's disease group compared to controls. Real-time PCR 
analysis also identified inflammatory biomarkers and Alzheimer's 
disease-associated risk factors in high-fat diet-treated, virgin olive 
oil-treated, and control samples.
RESULTS: The study found significant correlations between serum biomarker 
levels, lipid profiles, and dietary treatments. The activities of 
acetylcholinesterase, glutathione, catalase, and superoxide dismutase differed 
notably between virgin olive oil and tiger nut essential oil treatments. 
High-fat dietary treatments resulted in substantial increases in serum lipid 
profiles due to trans-fat intake compared to the control group. Overall, both 
virgin olive oil and tiger nut essential oil demonstrated cognitive enhancement 
and potential therapeutic effects against Alzheimer's disease symptoms induced 
by trans-fat feeding, including inhibition of acetylcholines-terase activity, 
reduction of amyloid-beta accumulation, and mitigation of inflammation.
CONCLUSION: The study suggests that serum biomarker gene expression profiles 
could serve as valuable indicators for differentiating between Alzheimer's 
disease, virgin olive oil, and dietary treatments. Both virgin olive oil and 
tiger nut essential oil demonstrated protective effects, enhancing cognitive 
function and offering therapeutic potential against AD symptoms. These effects 
were achieved through the reduction of inflammation, the inhibition of AChE 
activity, and the reduction of amyloid-beta accumulation.

AIM: This study aims to systematically evaluate and synthesize preclinical 
evidence on the neuroprotective effects of Triptolide (Tri) in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) models, focusing on its impact on amyloid-beta accumulation, 
synaptic dysfunction, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, autophagy, and 
apoptosis.
INTRODUCTION: AD is the most common cause of dementia, yet current treatments 
largely target symptoms rather than underlying pathology. Tri, a bioactive 
compound from Tripterygium wilfordii, has shown promise due to its 
anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective properties.
METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science was conducted 
up to 16 March 2024. English-language in vivo and in vitro studies on Tri's 
effects in AD models were included. Methodological quality was assessed using 
SYRCLE and SciRAP tools. The review is registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024521822).
RESULTS: Out of 403 studies, 15 met the inclusion criteria (6 in vivo, 8 in 
vitro, 1 both). Tri reduced Aβ burden, enhanced memory and synaptic integrity, 
suppressed neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, and modulated autophagy and 
apoptosis.
CONCLUSION: Tri demonstrates significant multi-target neuroprotective effects in 
AD preclinical models. Further high-quality studies are warranted to optimize 
dosing, delivery, and safety for clinical translation.

INTRODUCTION: Cognitive decline in asymptomatic preclinical Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) is slow and variable, limiting detection of treatment effects. This study 
developed models to forecast trajectories and improve trial efficiency.
METHODS: Models were trained on longitudinal Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive 
Composite (PACC) data up to 240 weeks from the Phase III A4 study of 
solanezumab. Baseline inputs included demographics, apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4, 
clinical scores, amyloid positron emission tomography (PET), plasma pTau217, 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and tau PET (sub-study). Stochastic gradient 
boosting was used, with evaluation via cross-validation and trial simulations.
RESULTS: The best model without tau PET used pTau217, clinical, and MRI data 
(R2 = 0.32; area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for 
classifying a 0.5-point PACC decline = 78.6%). Replacing MRI with tau PET 
improved performance (R2 = 0.42; AUROC = 83.1%). Predicted trajectories as a 
prognostic covariate reduced sample sizes by 35% and increased power from 80% to 
94.7%.
DISCUSSION: Prognostic models can predict decline in preclinical AD and improve 
trial efficiency.
GOV IDENTIFIERS: NCT02008357 (Clinical Trial of Solanezumab for Older 
Individuals Who May be at Risk for Memory Loss (A4)) HIGHLIGHTS: Models forecast 
4.5-year cognitive decline in amyloid-positive preclinical Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). Plasma pTau217 and tau positron emission tomography (PET) standardized 
uptake value ratios (SUVRs) in early-accumulating regions are key predictors. 
Tau PET improves prediction beyond plasma, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and 
clinical measures. Forecasted decline as a prognostic covariate improves power 
and cuts sample size in trial simulations. Alternative models underperform yet 
retain practical utility when tau PET or pTau217 is unavailable.

Apathy in Neuropsychiatric Disorders: Clinical Characteristics, Neurobiological 
Mechanisms, and Therapeutic Strategies.

Totuk O(1), Şahin S(1).

Author information:

Sciences, Sancaktepe Sehit Prof. Dr. Ilhan Varank SUAM, Istanbul, Türkiye.

Apathy is a prevalent yet frequently underrecognized neuropsychiatric syndrome 
characterized by diminished motivation and reduced goal-directed behavior across 
multiple domains. It is strongly associated with poorer functional outcomes, 
increased caregiver burden, and decreased quality of life in various 
neuropsychiatric conditions. Despite its clinical importance, apathy remains 
underdiagnosed and undertreated, partly due to overlapping features with 
depression and cognitive impairment. This narrative review synthesizes current 
knowledge on conceptualization, neurobiological mechanisms, diagnostic criteria, 
and management strategies for apathy, adopting a transdiagnostic perspective 
across disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, 
frontotemporal dementia, multiple sclerosis, and major psychiatric conditions. 
This review distinguishes itself by integrating subtype-based approaches, 
biomarker insights, and emerging digital tools, providing a framework for more 
precise characterization and personalized intervention. This review is based on 
a nonsystematic literature search conducted in PubMed, Scopus, and Google 
Scholar for articles published between 2011 and 2025. Improved characterization 
and management of apathy are essential for optimizing patient outcomes, reducing 
caregiver burden, and guiding future research.

Cognitive deterioration in patients undergoing hemodialysis: how variations in 
age influence the development of new mechanisms and treatment approaches?

The mechanisms of age-related differences and innovative intervention strategies 
for cognitive dysfunction in hemodialysis patients are crucial for enhancing 
patient outcomes. This research thoroughly examined the varying pathological 
aspects of cognitive decline across different age groups. Children and 
adolescents experience heightened permeability of the blood-brain barrier during 
critical developmental phases, along with the disruptive effects of uremic 
toxins on neurotransmitters and synaptic plasticity, which result in diminished 
white matter integrity and abnormal functioning of the default mode network. 
Additionally, genomic variations, such as harmful CNVs, coexist with the central 
nervous system's high plasticity and susceptibility. In contrast, elderly 
patients face cognitive impairment due to the combined effects of vascular 
diseases (like small vessel disease and impaired cerebral blood flow regulation) 
and Alzheimer's-like pathology, exacerbated by dialysis-related hypotension, 
oxidative stress, and inflammation, which further contribute to reduced cerebral 
blood flow and neurodegeneration. Consequently, a life cycle-based layered 
intervention strategy is suggested: children should focus on safeguarding their 
neural development through collaborative gene-environment interventions and 
neural stem cell transplants, while elderly patients require standardized 
treatment for vascular diseases and comorbidities, including Alzheimer's 
disease. Evidence indicates that incremental dialysis, low temperature dialysis, 
and high-dose hemodiafiltration can significantly reduce inflammation and 
oxidative stress markers, slow cognitive decline across all ages, and offer new 
insights for targeted nephrology management due to their universal effects. 
Future multi-center cohort studies are necessary to confirm the long-term 
advantages of age-specific interventions and to support the development of 
personalized precision treatment systems.

PURPOSE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing global health burden, yet 
effective therapies remain elusive. Microglia-the brain's resident immune 
cells-have emerged as key players in AD, capable of both neuroprotection and 
neurotoxicity. To elucidate research progress and gaps, we conducted a 
bibliometric analysis of global studies on "microglia and AD" from 2010 to 2025, 
highlighting advances beyond prior reviews.
METHODS: We searched the Web of Science Core Collection for relevant 
publications (2010-2025). After screening and deduplication, 12,275 records were 
analysed with CiteSpace 6.2.R4 to generate co-citation networks, keyword 
clusters, citation-burst timelines, and collaboration maps at national, 
institutional, and author levels.
RESULTS: Annual output rose markedly, peaking in 2022. The United States and 
China led the field; Harvard University, the University of California System, 
and the Chinese Academy of Sciences were the most prolific institutions. 
Influential authors included Holtzman, Heneka, Zetterberg, and Colonna. 
Co-citation analysis revealed three dominant knowledge clusters: microglial 
activation, TREM2-mediated immune responses, and neuroinflammation. Keyword 
evolution showed growing attention to TREM2 variants, NLRP3 inflammasome, 
single-cell omics, and novel imaging techniques, reflecting a shift toward 
microglial heterogeneity and translational research.
CONCLUSION: Microglia occupy a central position in AD pathogenesis through 
intertwined molecular pathways and dynamic functional states. Future work should 
refine subtype-specific roles, integrate peripheral-central immune interactions, 
and accelerate the translation of mechanistic insights into targeted 
interventions. This bibliometric overview maps collaboration patterns and 
emerging themes, providing a strategic guide for researchers aiming to advance 
microglia-focused AD therapeutics.

BACKGROUND: The catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene is involved in brain 
catecholamine metabolism, but its association with Parkinson's disease (PD) risk 
remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to investigate the relationship between COMT genetic 
variants and PD risk across diverse ancestries.
METHODS: We analyzed COMT variants in 2251 PD patients and 2835 controls of 
European descent using whole-genome sequencing from the Accelerating Medicines 
Partnership-Parkinson Disease (AMP-PD), along with 20,427 PD patients and 11,837 
controls from 10 ancestries using genotyping data from the Global Parkinson's 
Genetics Program (GP2).
RESULTS: Using the largest case-control datasets to date, no significant 
enrichment of COMT risk alleles in PD patients was observed across any ancestry 
group after correcting for multiple testing. Among Europeans, no correlations 
with cognitive decline, motor function, motor complications, or time to 
levodopa-induced dyskinesia onset were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the need for increased representation of 
diverse ancestries to better understand the role of COMT variants in PD. © 2025

RATIONALE: Persistent hiccups following a stroke are a common complication that 
can adversely affect the patient's condition and rehabilitation. Certain 
refractory cases fail to respond adequately to pharmacological treatment. We 
report 2 cases of successful treatment of persistent hiccups with acupuncture 
and a medical electromagnetic device (trade name, TDP, an abbreviation of the 
Chinese phrase "Te-ding Dian-ci-bo Pu").
PATIENT CONCERNS: The first patient was a 94-year-old male who had experienced 
continuous hiccups for 7 days. His comorbidities included Alzheimer disease, 
cardiac arrhythmia following pacemaker implantation, chronic kidney disease, 
glaucoma, and recent COVID-19 infection complicated by pneumonia. The second 
patient was a 70-year-old male who had experienced hiccups for 10 days. He had a 
history of cerebellar and brainstem infarction, hypertension, and hypopharyngeal 
carcinoma.
DIAGNOSES: Both patients were diagnosed with persistent hiccups.
INTERVENTIONS: Both patients received combined treatment with acupuncture and 
TDP.
OUTCOMES: Following treatment, hiccups were alleviated to different degrees, and 
no recurrence was observed at follow-up.
LESSONS: Neuroexcitatory imbalance and thoracoabdominal pressure asymmetry are 
considered underlying causes of persistent hiccups. Acupuncture combined with 
TDP may modulate periumbilical arteriovenous networks and abdominal pressure, 
thereby relieving hiccups. This case series suggests a novel, easily 
implemented, well-tolerated therapeutic option for the management of persistent 
hiccups.

BACKGROUND: Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), like Alzheimer's disease, are 
characterized by progressive cognitive decline, with limited effective 
treatments available. Several screening tools are available for diagnosing 
various types of dementia, including the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), 
the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and the Dementia Rating Scale (DRS).
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of MoCA 
to determine its suitability as a screening tool.
METHODS: This study analyzed data from participants aged 55 and older, recruited 
from U.S. Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers (ADRCs), using a National 
Alzheimer Coordinating Center Uniformed Data Set (NACC-UDS). Participants were 
classified based on patient records into demented and non-demented groups, with 
the non-demented group further categorized into those with normal cognition and 
cognitive impairment (CI). This analysis examines the correlation between these 
classifications and MoCA scores.
RESULTS: This study utilized an initial dataset of 188,700 participant records 
from NACC. After applying inclusion criteria, 16,309 participants were included. 
The participants had complete diagnostic information, clinician-conducted 
cognitive assessments, and MoCA scores. The participants were categorized into 
three groups: 7,624 with no cognitive impairment (NoCI), 4,893 with CI, and 
3,792 with dementia. This study focused on MoCA scores, revealing significant 
differences among diagnostic groups. ROC analysis demonstrated the MoCA's strong 
diagnostic capability, with AUC values significantly above 0.5 (P <.001). 
Sensitivity and specificity were calculated in at the literature-recommended 
cutoff scores of 26 and 21, while the optimal cutoff scores were identified as 
(< 24) for detecting MCI and (< 21) for dementia based on the Youden index in 
reference to individuals with no cognitive impairment. Although PPV was 
generally low, the high NPV across comparisons underscores the MoCA's 
effectiveness in ruling out cognitive impairment.
CONCLUSION: The study confirms MoCA as an effective tool for detecting dementia, 
showing 83% sensitivity and 82% specificity at a cutoff value of 21. With a high 
NPV of 94%, MoCA is particularly reliable for ruling out dementia. Its ability 
to detect MCI is moderate, with a sensitivity of 77.3% at cutoff of 24 among 
normal population.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD)'s multifactorial nature stresses the role 
of epigenetics in affecting different pathological pathways. We demonstrated 
that one-carbon metabolism epigenetically impacts AD-like phenotype. Here, we 
investigated the crosstalk between methylation and microRNAs in AD.
METHODS: We altered one-carbon metabolism to induce hypo- and hyper-methylation, 
in SK-N-BE neuroblastoma cells and TgCRND8 mice. miRNAs were profiled through a 
polymerase chain reaction array, then we focused on miR-29a expression and 
methylation of its genomic locus. Finally, we assessed miR-29a expression and 
methylation in the brain of AD subjects.
RESULTS: MiR-29a was repressed in hypomethylating and expressed in 
hypermethylating conditions. The expression of miR-29a and of its target, BACE1, 
was inversely correlated.
DISCUSSION: We demonstrated for the first time that miR-29a is modulated by 
one-carbon metabolism through DNA methylation, disclosing the molecular 
mechanisms regulating BACE1 expression in AD. These data confirm miR-29a's 
protective role in AD and support miR-29a as a potential biomarker for AD.

AIM: To understand general practitioners' (GPs') experience of existing care 
pathways for people with moderate-severe Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and explore 
their attitudes towards potential modifications to these pathways.
DESIGN: Secondary thematic analysis of qualitative interviews, originally 
conducted with GPs to explore prescribing of memantine in general practice. The 
theoretical domains framework was used to structure the data.
SETTING: The study participants were recruited via an online survey completed by 
GPs across England.
PARTICIPANTS: Semi-structured, qualitative interviews were conducted with 
thirteen male and ten female GPs from a range of general practices in England.
PRIMARY OUTCOME: Insights into GPs' views and experiences regarding existing and 
possible care pathways for individuals with moderate to severe AD.
RESULTS: Gaps in GPs' current levels of knowledge and skill in respect of caring 
for patients with moderate-to-severe AD affect their confidence and ability to 
identify opportunities for additional treatments. While GPs emphasise their role 
as providers of holistic care, features of the current healthcare context, 
including a lack of additional funding, inhibit their willingness to assume 
additional responsibilities as part of a revised pathway.
CONCLUSION: A considerable knowledge, skills and confidence gap must be 
addressed to support the implementation of new care pathways that include 
revised responsibilities for GPs. GPs need appropriate support and resources to 
manage their patients' changing needs and to provide the best possible 
pharmacological management as the disease develops.

INTRODUCTION: Providing care management, treatment and support to patients with 
Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) is a difficult task for health 
systems. Over the past 20 years, interventions designed to improve outcomes for 
patients living in the community with dementia and their care partners have 
moved progressively, but separately, from large scale trials and pragmatic 
models of collaborative care. Given the projected increase in the number of 
people living with dementia coupled with the realignment of payment for services 
to be value-based and provided in the community, system-level approaches are 
needed to address the complex needs of patients with a dementia diagnosis and 
their care partners. We designed a statewide, pragmatic trial to evaluate 
virtual delivery of an evidence-based dementia collaborative care program on 
patient healthcare utilization and medication use.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Aging Brain Care Virtual (ABCV) program is a 12-month 
embedded, cluster randomized, usual care controlled trial designed to test the 
effectiveness of a virtual dementia collaborative care program in 24 Indiana 
University Health primary care clinics (12 intervention, 12 control) across the 
state of Indiana, enrolling 860 persons living with dementia (430 intervention, 
430 control) and their care partners. ABCV relies on a tailored approach in 
which dyad needs are identified during virtual visits and addressed with 
standardized protocols previously tested in a randomized controlled trial 
delivered in person. The ABCV trial will measure emergency department 
utilization (primary outcome) and appropriate medication use (secondary outcome) 
at 12 months using electronic medical record data. Additionally, this study will 
use semi-structured interviews with care partners and clinicians to explore the 
implementation context, process and outcomes of the ABCV program.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval was obtained from the Indiana 
University Institutional Review Board (20249). Research findings will be 
published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at scientific conferences.

Aging is a major risk factor for numerous chronic diseases, including 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), atherosclerosis (AS), type 2 
diabetes mellitus (T2DM), osteoarthritis (OA) and age-related macular 
degeneration (AMD). Galectin-3 (Gal-3), a unique β-galactoside-binding lectin, 
has emerged as a critical mediator in the pathogenesis of AD and other 
age-related disorders by modulating key mechanisms such as inflammation, 
oxidative stress, and apoptosis. While emphasizing neurological disorders (AD, 
PD), this review also examines Gal-3's role in systemic age-related conditions 
(T2DM, AS, OA, AMD) that frequently co-occur with or influence 
neurodegeneration. This review summarizes current knowledge on the expression 
patterns, molecular mechanisms, and therapeutic potential of Gal-3 in 
aging-related diseases. Elevated Gal-3 levels have been detected in the brain 
tissue and cerebrospinal fluid of AD patients, where it contributes to multiple 
pathological processes, including microglia-driven neuroinflammation, Aβ plaque 
deposition, tau hyperphosphorylation, oxidative damage, and neuronal apoptosis. 
Furthermore, Gal-3 upregulation is observed across various age-related diseases 
and correlates with disease progression, underscoring its potential as a 
diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target. Preclinical studies demonstrate 
that Gal-3-targeted interventions-including small-molecule inhibitors (e.g., 
TD-139), natural compounds (e.g., modified citrus pectin), and other 
pharmacological agents-exert neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, 
and anti-apoptotic effects by binding to Gal-3 and modulating its activity in 
animal models, offering promising avenues for multi-disease treatment. However, 
the dual roles and complex regulatory networks of Gal-3 present challenges for 
clinical translation, requiring context-specific therapeutic approaches tailored 
to distinct disease mechanisms. Future research should focus on elucidating 
tissue-specific mechanisms and optimizing combination therapies to enable 
precise targeting of aging-related pathologies.

Neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's are driven by protein aggregation, 
notably amyloid-β (Aβ) fibrillation and associated cytotoxicity. Here, we report 
the design of ampholytic carbon dots (ACDs) with red/green emission that 
bind/control amyloid fibrillation. These ACDs bind with amyloid structures via 
electrostatic and van der Waals interactions and effectively inhibit fibril 
formation as well as promote disintegration of mature fibrils. The fluorescence 
property of ACDs enable high-resolution fluorescence imaging of amyloid 
structures at intra/extracellular space. ACD-amyloid conjugates showed lysosomal 
entrapment with lower amyloid-induced cytotoxicity via the lowering of reactive 
oxygen species generation. Together, these results highlight the dual 
functionality of ACDs as imaging and antiamyloidogenic agents, offering a 
promising nanoplatform for the diagnosis and treatment of amyloid-associated 
neurodegenerative disorders.

The dysfunction of the lysosome and autophagy-lysosome system serves as a 
driving force for neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic disorders, inflammatory 
conditions, and other related diseases, closely influencing their onset and 
progression. Therefore, restoring the function of the lysosome or 
autophagy-lysosome system has become an increasingly crucial therapeutic 
strategy in disease management. In this review, we will introduce the lysosomal 
biogenesis, structure, and function, as well as the biological process of the 
autophagy-lysosome system. Various diseases closely associated with 
lysosomal/autophagic dysfunction are also reviewed, emphasizing the significance 
of targeting the function of the lysosome or autophagy-lysosome system in

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still a major unmet medical challenge, with limited 
treatment options and a critical need for early diagnostics. Exosomes, nanoscale 
extracellular vesicles with a lipid bilayer, are pivotal players in 
intercellular communication and promising tools for AD management. Their unique 
ability to cross the bloodbrain barrier, low immunogenicity, and ability for 
cargo delivery make them ideal candidates for targeted drug delivery. This 
review comprehensively examines the biology of exosomes-including their 
structure, biogenesis, release, and uptake-and evaluates advanced methods for 
their isolation, purification, and characterization. We highlight their dual 
role in AD pathogenesis, where they can propagate pathological proteins such as 
amyloid-β and tau, and in therapeutic applications, where engineered exosomes 
deliver neuroprotective agents. Furthermore, exosomal biomarkers in biofluids 
show significant potential for noninvasive early diagnosis. Recent advances in 
loading strategies and surface engineering have been discussed, alongside 
challenges in scalability and safety. This synthesis bridges current knowledge 
with future directions, emphasizing the translational potential of exosomes in 
AD therapeutics and diagnostics.

Hormonal contraceptives (HCs) are one of the most widely used classes of drug 
worldwide and are a critical part of women's health. Beyond their primary use 
for birth control, HCs exert many health benefits, including treatment of 
menstrual-related symptoms and reduced risk of certain types of cancers. Here, 
we focus on the role of HCs in promoting resilience to depression and 
Alzheimer's disease. Although risks for depression with HC use have been widely 
stated, HCs only increase risk for up to 10 % of users, and conversely improve 
mood and protect against depression for many others. Emerging evidence also 
suggests that HC use protects against age-related cognitive decline and 
Alzheimer's disease, even decades after HC use. We propose that these effects 
are due to modulatory effects of HCs on stress-related signaling and neuroimmune 
function. In this paper, we discuss how HCs interact with stress responsivity, 
neuroimmune signaling, and other individual differences to promote resilience or 
susceptibility to psychiatric and neurological disorders.

PURPOSE: We examined the relationship between state-level equity scores as it 
relates to protections and supports of sexual and gender minority (SGM) 
individuals at the state level and psychosocial caregiving outcomes among SGM 
caregivers of people living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias 
(ADRD).
METHOD: Data collected from SGM caregivers of people with ADRD were combined 
with publicly available state-level equity scores. We used mixed linear models 
to examine the relationships between equity scores and levels of family quality 
of life and depressive symptoms.
RESULTS: SGM caregivers living in low-equity states experienced significantly 
more microaggressions, poorer family quality of life, and greater levels of 
caregiver stigma and depressive symptoms. Equity score was a significant 
predictor of family quality of life.
CONCLUSION: Future research to understand the influence of the policy context in 
which SGM caregivers live is needed to create tailored supports to promote their 
well-being.

INTRODUCTION: Ferroptosis, a type of iron-dependent regulated cell death driven 
by lipid peroxidation, has emerged as a critical contributing factor to 
hippocampal neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Dysregulated iron 
homeostasis exacerbates oxidative injury, impairing cognitive function. This 
study provides experimental evidence that thymoquinone (TQ) exerts 
neuroprotective effects in an AD-related ferroptosis model by modulating iron, 
lipid, and glutathione metabolism.
METHODS: Thirty female C57BL/6 mice (8-10 weeks, 18-22 g) were randomly 
allocated into five groups: 1- Control, 2- artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF; 
20 ng/L), 3- RAS-selective lethal 3 (RSL3) (100 ng/10 µL in aCSF), 4- RSL3 + TQ 
(50 mg/kg in 1.0% w/v acacia gum), and 5- TQ alone (50 mg/kg in 1.0% w/v acacia 
gum). A bilateral hole was drilled according to the Bregma coordinates (0.5 mm 
back, 1 mm left-right, 2,5 mm deep) and a 10 µl Hamilton syringe was inserted 
perpendicularly from the skull to the brain. RSL3 (100 ng/10 µl) was infused 
with 4 µl (Intracerebral-IC). Cognitive and anxiety-like behaviors were assessed 
using the Morris Water Maze (MWM) and the Open Field Test (OFT). Hippocampal 
oxidative markers, total antioxidant status (TAS), and total oxidant status 
(TOS), were determined by spectrophotometric quantification. GPx4, XCT, and Fpn 
mRNA levels were measured by qRT-PCR. Protein expression and distribution were 
assessed by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Iron accumulation was 
visualized using Perl's Prussian blue staining method.
RESULTS: RSL3-induced ferroptosis impaired spatial learning and increased 
anxiety-like behavior, accompanied by elevated hippocampal iron accumulation, 
oxidative stress, and downregulation of GPx4, XCT, and Fpn. TQ treatment 
significantly restored TAS levels, reduced TOS, suppressed iron deposition, and 
reversed ferroptosis-associated molecular changes, upregulating GPx4 and Fpn 
while attenuating XCT downregulation (P < 0.05). Ferroptosis-induced behavioral 
deficits were significantly improved by TQ.
CONCLUSION: These findings identify TQ as a potent modulator of ferroptosis, 
acting through coordinated regulation of iron export, lipid peroxidation, and 
glutathione-dependent antioxidant defenses. TQ targeting convergent ferroptosis 
pathways is a promising therapeutic candidate to alleviate hippocampal 
neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in AD.

AD is a neurodegenerative disorder and is associated with the presence of 
amyloid-β plaques and neurofibrillary tangles leading to net loss of neurons, 
which demonstrates an urgent unmet need to develop new human health therapies 
based on the fundamental mechanisms of oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. 
This work is a computational assessment of the potential use of neolupenol, a 
triterpenoid produced in Pluchea lanceolata, as a pharmacologically active 
compound that exerted its beneficial effect through the modulation of the 
Keap1-Nrf2 axis, one of the central regulators of the antioxidant response. 
Using an integrated approach that combined network pharmacology, molecular 
docking, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we identified neolupenol as a 
high-affinity Keap1-binding molecule capable of activating the Nrf2-mediated 
neuroprotective pathway. Virtual screening of 25 phytochemicals from Pluchea 
lanceolata (retrieved from the PubChem database) with customized filters 
revealed neolupenol as the top candidate, showing strong binding affinity 
(- 8.22 kcal/mol; Ki = 1.45 µM) toward the Keap1 Kelch domain (PDB ID: 2FLU). 
The docked complex demonstrated hydrogen bonds with VAL463 (2.17 Å), THR560, and 
ILE559, along with hydrophobic interactions involving CYS513, ALA366, and 
VAL514, which collectively stabilized the ligand at the Neh2-binding interface. 
Network pharmacology yielded 30 of such common targets of AD-neolupenol (e.g., 
GSK3B, CASP3, TNF, and BACE1), enriched in pathways such as amyloid processing, 
tau phosphorylation, oxidative stress response, and lipid metabolism 
(FDR-adjusted p < 0.0001). Complex stability was verified by MD simulations 
(100 ns): RMSD of the backbone 2.34-3.84 = 2.34 Å, unchanged radius of gyration 
(17.8-18.0 Å), and stable inter-hydrogen bonding. Residues VAL561, PHE577, and 
SER602 were found to have an interaction occupancy of > 70%, providing a basis 
of dynamic stability. The triterpenoid cavity appeared in neolupenol 
contributing to pleasant PK, the ability to herald the blood-brain barrier, and 
suboptimal toxicity. These results position neolupenol as a potent, multi-target 
neuroprotective agent that disrupts Keap1-Nrf2 interaction, promoting Nrf2 
nuclear translocation and antioxidant gene activation. Future work warrants in 
vivo validation of its efficacy in mitigating AD pathology and clinical 
translation.

Activated microglia are considered to be closely related to brain senescence and 
the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) is 
widely used to treat cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease (AD). This 
study aims to investigate the active ingredients of GBE and the underlying 
molecular mechanisms. The active ingredients of GBE in AD treatment were first 
analyzed by network pharmacology, culminating in the identification of the key 
ingredient, quercetin, and its targeted protein, NQO1. GO function enriched the 
oxidative stress pathway, while KEGG enriched the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. 
Quercetin binding to NQO1 was verified by molecular docking and DARTS analysis. 
Cytotoxicity assay revealed no significant toxicity of GBE (0-1 mg/mL) and 
quercetin (0-0.4 μM) over 48 h. Subsequently, we constructed the microglial 
injury model by H2O2-induced HMC3 and BV2 cell lines. GBE and quercetin 
suppressed the senescence characteristics in H2O2-induced microglia. Further 
investigation revealed that the expression of NQO1 was downregulated in the 
injury model, and treatment with GBE and quercetin facilitated the protein 
expression of NQO1. In addition, silencing NQO1 reduced the promoting effect of 
quercetin on microglia viability and phosphorylation levels of PI3K, Akt, and 
mTOR. At the same time, it significantly increased the levels of p53, p21, p16 
and β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal). Collectively, GBE mitigated H2O2-induced 
microglial injury, which activated the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway through the 
quercetin/NQO1 axis. These findings highlight quercetin/NQO1 signaling as a 
possible therapeutic target for senescence-related neurodegeneration.

BACKGROUND: Tau-derived cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers correlate with 
amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques or tau tangles in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study 
assessed the effects of long-term anti-Aβ antibodies on amyloid plaques, tau 
tangles, and CSF tau species to determine the relationships between them.
METHODS: A post-hoc analysis of the DIAN-TU-001 trial (NCT01760005) examined 142 
participants at risk for dominantly inherited AD randomized to solanezumab 
(n = 50), gantenerumab (n = 52), or placebo (n = 40). High-resolution mass 
spectrometry quantified CSF tau species over four years.
RESULTS: Phosphorylated tau (p-tau) species (153, 181, 217, 231) increased early 
in preclinical AD but were reduced with gantenerumab-mediated Aβ plaque 
reduction. Nearly a decade later, MTBR-tau243 and p-tau205 increased, showing no 
association with Aβ reduction, aligning with tau tangle pathology progression.
DISCUSSION: Initially changing soluble p-tau species track Aβ plaque reduction, 
while ptau205 and MTBR-243 reflect tau tangle pathology, informing different 
pathways of therapeutic strategies.
HIGHLIGHTS: p-tau217 and p-tau231 correlate with Aβ-PET and respond to Aβ-plaque 
lowering therapies. Aβ immunotherapy trials support a direct link between p-tau 
changes and Aβ plaques Gantenerumab reduces Aβ plaques but does not affect tau 
NFT-related biomarkers. Blood-based p-tau217 assays may provide a non-invasive 
tool to monitor Aβ therapies. MTBR-tau243 strongly correlates with tau PET and 
tracks NFT pathology progression. Further studies are needed to validate tau 
biomarkers for tracking NFT-targeting therapies.

Primary progressive aphasia(PPA) is a rare neurodegenerative condition and 
variant presentation of Alzheimer's disease or Frontotemporal Dementia. It is 
characterized by progressive decline isolated to language functions. PPA 
provides a model for understanding the anatomy of language, where each cortical 
language center corresponds to distinct PPA subtypes. Understanding this anatomy 
and its corresponding PPA subtypes helps clinicians choose testing, interpret 
imaging, and tailor treatment. These subtypes are termed agrammatic/nonfluent, 
semantic, and logopenic PPA. Each subtype is probabilistically associated with 
three proteinopathies: the amyloid and tau of Alzheimer's disease and 
frontotemporal lobar degeneration due to Tau or TDP-43. We will discuss when 
biomarker testing is indicated and the nuances of choosing among the increasing 
array of biomarker tests to improve diagnostic certainty. While medical 
treatment is limited, there are increasing pharmacologic options for treating 
Alzheimer's disease. Non-pharmacologic strategies can also be tailored to the 
patient's specific subtype and caregivers' needs.

A Case Report Exploring Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease With No Known Family 
History.

Birmingham, GBR.

This case report conveys a rare presentation of early-onset Alzheimer's disease 
(EOAD) in a 58-year-old female with no family history of dementia. The patient 
demonstrates progressive cognitive decline with features of memory loss and 
associated severe language impairment, subsequently leading to a delay in the 
definite diagnosis. A systematic literature review using PubMed and Google 
Scholar was undertaken to explore the features of EOAD and how it differs from 
late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), focusing on risk factors, clinical 
presentation, investigation, and management. Although this patient was not known 
to have a family history of AD, evidence suggestive of EOAD could be observed 
within a series of neuroimaging and diagnostic tests such as magnetic resonance 
imaging scans, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and blood tests. Management of EOAD 
involves a combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions 
using a biopsychosocial approach. Overall, the case highlights challenges in 
recognition of EOAD in its early stages of presentation for patients with no 
family predisposition, whilst emphasizing the importance of early detection and 
management to help improve patient outcomes. It also focuses attention on the 
significant impact a condition such as EOAD can have on the family members 
involved. Further research would be required to potentially redefine diagnostic 
criteria and treatment strategies for conditions of such rarity.

Adiponectin Receptor Agonist Ameliorates Synaptic Dysfunction in 3xTg 
Alzheimer's Disease Mouse Model by Activation of AMPK.

AIM: The hormone adiponectin impacts various facets of brain function, including 
neurogenesis, energy homeostasis, and synaptic processes. The use of adiponectin 
or adiponectin receptor agonists may protect against Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
and reduce AD pathology. Here, we investigated the ability of the adiponectin 
receptor agonist, AdipoRon, to restore synaptic function in an AD mouse model 
and the underlying mechanism.
METHODS: Acute hippocampal slices from 3xTg-AD mice and age-matched controls 
were used to evaluate the ability of AdipoRon to rescue synaptic deficits in an 
AD model. Slices were incubated in AdipoRon or other pharmacological agents, 
followed by electrophysiological field recordings to evaluate synaptic function 
and plasticity. Signaling pathway alterations were evaluated by Western blot, 
with a focus on AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling.
RESULTS: Incubation of hippocampal slices with AdipoRon ameliorated long-term 
potentiation (LTP) and basal synaptic transmission deficits in 3xTg-AD mice. 
AdipoRon was unable to restore these parameters in the presence of the AMPK 
inhibitor, Compound C. AdipoRon altered presynaptic parameters by a mechanism 
that did not appear to be solely dependent on AMPK. AdipoRon slice incubation 
was associated with activation of AMPK, inhibition of GSK3β, and altered 
glutamatergic receptor subunit phosphorylation based on Western blot analysis.
CONCLUSION: Activation of adiponectin receptors restores synaptic function in an 
AD model in part through AMPK signaling. These results warrant further 
investigation into adiponectin receptor agonists as a novel approach for AD 
prevention or treatment.

Proteins exert biological functions not only depending on abundance but also on 
regulation. Lactylation is an important novel post-translational modification 
(PTM) that can affect protein structure and function, playing a crucial role in 
signal transduction, gene expression and cellular metabolism. Lactylation 
participates in the progression of various diseases, such as tumours, heart 
failure, myocardial infarction, renal fibrosis and Alzheimer's disease. These 
studies suggest that lactylation may mediate metabolic reprogramming and enhance 
cellular plasticity, providing new entry points for developing therapeutic 
approaches. This review introduces the progress on various aspects of 
lactylation, including mechanisms, regulations and disease associations, aiming 
to provide valuable insights and inspiration for further exploration of protein 
modification networks.

Neuroinflammation is a key pathological mechanism underlying neurodegenerative 
diseases, and intricately interacts with protein glycosylation. Emerging 
evidence suggests that aberrant glycosylation disrupts immune homeostasis, 
activates microglia, and promotes the release of inflammatory mediators, thereby 
exacerbating neuroinflammatory responses. In addition, the inflammatory 
microenvironment can further dysregulate glycosylation patterns, creating a 
vicious cycle that amplifies disease pathology. Although the regulatory role of 
glycosylation in neuroinflammation associated with neurodegenerative diseases 
has been recognized, the precise molecular and cellular mechanisms remain 
incompletely understood. This review systematically examines the complex 
crosstalk between glycosylation and neuroinflammation, with a particular focus 
on the critical roles of glycosylation in key neurodegenerative diseases, 
including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We explore how glycosylation abnormalities 
contribute to disease pathogenesis through effects on immune recognition, 
protein aggregation, and cellular functions. Understanding the molecular 
underpinnings of these diseases may pave the way for the development of 
therapeutic strategies targeting glycosylation pathways, ultimately improving 
clinical outcomes for patients.

Lipid alterations in the brain have been implicated in many neurodegenerative 
diseases. To facilitate comparative lipidomic research across brain diseases, we 
establish a data common named the Neurolipid Atlas that we prepopulated with 
isogenic induced pluripotent stem cell (iPS cell)-derived lipidomics data for 
different brain diseases. Additionally, the resource contains lipidomics data of 
human and mouse brain tissue. Leveraging multiple datasets, we demonstrate that 
iPS cell-derived neurons, microglia and astrocytes exhibit distinct lipid 
profiles that recapitulate in vivo lipotypes. Notably, the Alzheimer disease 
(AD) risk gene ApoE4 drives cholesterol ester (CE) accumulation specifically in 
human astrocytes and we also observe CE accumulation in whole-brain lipidomics 
from persons with AD. Multiomics interrogation of iPS cell-derived astrocytes 
revealed that altered cholesterol metabolism has a major role in astrocyte 
immune pathways such as the immunoproteasome and major histocompatibility 
complex class I antigen presentation. Our data commons, available online ( 
https://neurolipidatlas.com/ ), allows for data deposition by the community and 
provides a user-friendly tool and knowledge base for a better understanding of 
lipid dyshomeostasis in neurodegenerative diseases.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), caused by damage to the brain's nerve cells, is a 
progressive neurodegenerative disease that insidiously erodes cognitive 
function, and primarily affecting elderly adults. AD is associated with a 
considerable economic burden arising from multiple expenditure categories. The 
programed cell death, in normal cells, plays importance roles in biological 
processes, ensuring homeostasis and controlling development in multicellular 
organisms. However, AD is characterized by a high degree of pathological-related 
neuronal death, which is observable in various regions of the brain. This 
chapter aims to examine the diverse forms of cell death involved in AD, 
including apoptosis, necroptosis, autophagy-related cell death, and 
excitotoxicity; as well as elucidates the molecular mechanisms linking cell 
death to AD pathogenesis, including amyloid-beta, tau pathology, 
neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and genetic factors. Targeting 
these cell death pathways offers a promising avenue for future AD therapeutics 
and drug development.

Monoamine oxidase mainly includes two isoforms, monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) and 
monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B), of which MAO-B is a crucial metabolic enzyme, acts 
on dopamine and β-phenylethylamine and can be selectively inhibited by 
pargyline. MAO-B has emerged as a significant drug target for a variety of 
nervous system diseases. In the present work, a highly selective and sensitive 
fluorescent probe named 3-aminopropyl (3-oxo-3H-phenoxazin-7-yl) carbamate 
(AHPC) was designed and developed. AHPC showed good stability and cell membrane 
permeability in biological systems, and could detect endogenous MAO-B activity 
in real time, and accurately evaluate the changes of MAO-B under H2O2-induced 
oxidative stress. In addition, AHPC was able to detect the distribution of MAO-B 
in different organs. As MAO-B is an important drug target, we developed a 
high-throughput, visual screening system for MAO-B inhibitors based on AHPC. 
Glycyrrhizae radix et rhizome was screened from 272 kinds of Chinese medicine 
and displayed strong inhibitory effect toward MAO-B. After further separation of 
Glycyrrhizae radix et rhizome, it was found that Licoisoflavone B was the main 
active ingredient to inhibit MAO-B activity in different enzyme sources, and was 
expected to be a lead compound for the treatment of MAO-B-related diseases. In 
conclusion, with the advantages of fluorescent probe technology, we not only 
developed a handy molecular tool for real-time detection of MAO-B distribution 
and function in complex biosystems, but also established a high-throughput 
visualization method for screening MAO-B inhibitors from traditional Chinese 
medicine, which are promising for the treatment of many MAO-B-related diseases.

neuropsychiatric disorders: whether and how to apply?

Neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders are among the leading causes of 
mortality and disability worldwide, with current treatment modalities including 
traditional therapies, psychological and supportive interventions, and emerging 
therapeutic approaches. Photobiomodulation (PBM), a neuromodulatory technique 
using lasers and light-emitting diodes (LEDs), has emerged as a promising 
intervention for enhancing brain function by stimulating neural activity, 
thereby protecting brain tissue and restoring function. Despite its widespread 
application, the precise mechanisms underlying the selection of critical 
parameters and their associated therapeutic effects remain incompletely 
understood. This systematic review synthesizes data from multiples studies over 
the past decade, investigating the effects of PBM on neurological and 
neuropsychiatric disorders, including traumatic brain injury (TBI), spinal cord 
injury (SCI), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), generalized 
anxiety disorder (GAD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and healthy subjects. 
Emerging evidence suggests that the therapeutic mechanisms of PBM may involve 
enhanced energy metabolism, increased cerebral blood flow (CBF), modulation of 
oxidative stress, anti-inflammatory effects, neuroprotection and regeneration, 
enhanced synaptic plasticity, and regulation of resting-state brain networks. 
Regarding parameter selection, wavelength has emerged as a critical factor 
influencing penetration depth and the specific chromophore responsible for 
photon absorption and therapeutic efficacy. This review focuses on the 
characteristics of diverse wavelengths, as well as the roles of multiple 
chromophores and associated signaling pathways. Different irradiation 
modalities, including both non-invasive and invasive approaches, are examined, 
alongside optimal treatment windows for power and fluence. Additionally, less 
frequently addressed aspects, such as spot area and power density patterns, are 
considered.

Advancing Alzheimer's disease treatment: A literature review on senolytic 
intervention.

Francisco, CA, USA.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of dementia, currently affecting 
over 50 million people globally. Despite decades of research, therapeutic 
development has continued to face high failure rates due to an incomplete 
understanding of the underlying disease mechanisms. Current drugs like 
rivastigmine focus on managing cognitive symptoms since there is no known cure 
to halt the disease's progression. However, recent research has suggested that 
advanced biological age, particularly the accumulation of senescent cells, is 
the most significant risk factor for AD pathology, and targeting these aging 
mechanisms may prove more effective in altering the disease progression. 
Senescent cells accumulate with age, contributing to inflammatory states and 
neurodegenerative diseases such as AD. Senolytic drugs, such as dasatinib and 
quercetin (D + Q), have shown promise in animal models by clearing senescent 
cells, delaying aging-related decline, and improving AD-related outcomes. This 
literature review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the therapeutic 
potential of senolytic interventions for AD by examining the mechanisms of 
cellular senescence based on evidence of its accumulation in the human brain, 
critically analyzing the preclinical and clinical trials involving senolytic 
compounds, and discussing the implications and limitations of this approach. The 
findings from recent studies indicate that senolytics may pave the way for 
effective AD treatments, though further clinical validation is needed.

The accumulation of pathological markers, such as tau tangles and amyloid-beta 
(Aβ) plaques, and progressive cognitive dysfunction are the markers of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). The development of successful therapeutic plans 
requires exposure to the molecular mechanisms underlying AD development. The 
importance of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), such as circular RNAs (circRNAs), 
microRNAs (miRNAs), long ncRNAs (lncRNAs), and PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), 
in controlling gene expression and influencing the pathophysiology of disease 
has been brought to light by recent studies. With a focus on their role in 
important processes such tau hyperphosphorylation, neuroinflammation, and 
amyloid-beta formation, this study attempts to give a thorough overview of the 
several types of ncRNAs and their dysregulation in AD. The genetic variants that 
are associated with the function of ncRNA including single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) may influence ncRNA expression and activity, thereby 
impacting the susceptibility of individual towards AD. Furthermore, the impact 
of biomarkers of ncRNAs for early diagnosis and therapeutic option for 
intervention, highlighting most recent advancement in high-throughput 
technologies and bioinformatics facilitating ncRNA profiling has also being 
discussed. The integration of multi-omics approaches and artificial 
intelligence, new advancement for the complex relationship among ncRNAs and AD 
pathology are also discussed. The enhancement and understanding of ncRNAs could 
lead to the door for novel therapeutic concepts for the mitigation of AD 
progression, offering effective interventions in a disease that currently 
starves the curative treatments.

BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by a combination of motor 
and non-motor symptoms, which can fluctuate over time. Recognition of nonmotor 
fluctuations (NMF) as a distinct and relevant feature of PD is recent, and their 
impact on patients' health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and on caregivers' 
burden remains underexplored. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of NMF on 
patients' HRQoL and caregiver burden, and to compare it with the impact of motor 
complications (MC).
METHODS: Patients and caregivers were consecutively recruited from five Italian 
Movement Disorder centers. Assessments included the Non-Motor Fluctuation 
Assessment, the MDS-sponsored Unified PD Rating Scale, the Mini-Mental State 
Examination, the 39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39), and the 
Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI). Linear regression analyses examined associations 
between total NMF and MC scores with PDQ-39 and ZBI. Logistic regression 
estimated the odds of moderate-severe caregiver burden based on NMF.
RESULTS: 149 patients and 135 caregivers were included. Higher NMF scores were 
associated with worse HRQoL (PDQ-39: Beta = 0.318; p < 0.001), and correlated 
with most PDQ-39 domains, excluding stigma. MC also correlated with 
PDQ-39-(Beta = 0.338; p < 0.001), particularly in domains such as mobility, 
ADLs, communication, and bodily discomfort. Both NMF and MC scores were 
associated with caregiver burden (ZBI: Beta = 0.374 and 0.437, respectively; 
p < 0.001). Each additional NMF point increased the odds of caregiver burden by 
11.6% (OR = 1.116, 95% CI:1.043-1.194, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: NMF significantly affect both patient HRQoL and caregiver burden, 
with an impact comparable to that of MC. Systematic assessment and targeted 
interventions for NMF should be integrated into routine PD care.

The multifaceted nature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) paves the way for the 
development of multitarget-directed ligands (MTDLs) as potential therapeutic 
agents. Herein, we report a series of triazole-based ligands that function as 
MTDLs via a fragment splicing strategy (6a-6ah and 8a-8m). The synthesized 
ligands (6a-6ah and 8a-8m) were systematically screened for their 
neuroinflammatory and MAO-B inhibitory efficacy, among which, the 
pyrrole-appended triazole derivative 6a emerged as the most prominent candidate. 
Additionally, we analyzed the correlation of the in vitro efficacy with in 
silico studies and found that both align well. Also, 6a exhibited appreciable 
BBB permeability. Further, the multitargeted efficacy of 6a was evaluated via 
ROS scavenging ability, Aβ-induced neuroprotection, and mitigation of various 
pathogenic mechanisms, including metal dyshomeostasis, mitochondrial 
dysfunction, and neurodegeneration. Consequently, our findings established 6a as 
a novel multi-target-directed ligand, highlighting its potential as a modifiable 
agent for attenuating AD symptoms.

CONTEXT: Intranasal insulin has emerged as a promising potential treatment for 
cognitive decline. However, African American adults are under-represented in 
this research area, and unintentional weight loss is a possible detrimental side 
effect.
OBJECTIVE: We assessed effects of acute intranasal insulin exposure on food 
intake and appetite-related constructs among middle-aged, obese, cognitively 
normal African American adults. We hypothesized that intranasal insulin would 
result in fewer calories consumed, greater feelings of fullness, and less hunger 
compared to placebo.
METHOD: A total of 39 participants received intranasal doses of Novolin-R 
(40 IU) and a saline placebo on separate days in a double-blind, 
counterbalanced, crossover design, with 3-day, eucaloric, nutritionally balanced 
diets preceding each dose. Doses were preceded by a 4-hour fast and followed by 
a test lunch. Visual analog scales (VAS) were used to assess appetite 
immediately before and after each dose, and after each lunch. Mixed effects 
linear model t tests were used to compare questionnaires and lunch intake 
between insulin and placebo.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in food intake between 
conditions. However, feelings of fullness were significantly greater immediately 
after insulin compared to placebo. In addition, the desire to consume sweet 
foods decreased significantly more after insulin than after placebo.
CONCLUSION: Acute intranasal insulin was associated with a reduced desire for 
sweet foods and with increased feelings of fullness, but not reduced food 
intake, among middle-aged African American adults. Eating behavior and appetite 
changes should be explored further as possible side effects of intranasal 
insulin treatment for cognitive decline in diverse populations.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative condition 
involving a complex blend of disturbances in synaptic development and 
maintenance, neurovascular cross-talk, ionic and nutrient transport, and 
mitochondrial metabolism. The precise molecular profile of AD onset with insight 
for major pathological contributors remains unclear with corresponding 
impedances in therapeutic development. The current study sought two objectives, 
as (i) to resolve the molecular pathogenesis from cognitive impairment to the 
onset of AD-like neuropathology and (ii) whether the novel agent cannabidiol 
(CBD), noted for its neuroprotective effects, influences the molecular 
transition associated with AD onset.
METHODS: Dietary CBD was administered daily (80-100 mg/kg/day) in male 3xTg-AD 
mice and wild-type B6129SF2/J animals from 4.5 to 6.5 mo of age with inclusion 
of vehicle controls. RNA sequencing encompassed longitudinal and cross-sectional 
blood and brain samples, respectively. Metabolomics and behavioral analyses 
examined brain regions (cortex, hippocampus) and associated integrated 
neurocircuitry.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: There were >1,000 differentially expressed markers of AD 
onset, whereby >75% were either eliminated or reversed in the direction of 
expression in response to CBD. Signaling pathways encompassed synaptic 
development and plasticity (e.g., Foxp2), neurovascular interactions (Smad9, 
Angptl6), receptors and ion channels (Gria4, Chrna2, Rgs7/Rgs7bp), mitochondrial 
genes (Ndufa7, Cox7a2), immunity (Ncr1), oxidation-reduction (Esr1), lipid 
synthesis (Fasn, ApoE), and carbohydrate metabolism (Mafa, Mlxipl). As 
potentially addressable with CBD treatment, AD onset represents molecular 
integration of neurovascular interactions, channelopathies, metabolic 
disturbances, and aberrations in developmental genes with involvement of major 
pathological contributors such as inflammation, oxidative signaling, 
dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance.

INTRODUCTION: The behavioral health (BH) needs of older adults are unique, 
increasing, and, too often, poorly understood.
METHODS: Oregon established the first state-level center of excellence in the 
United States focused on the BH of older adults via a state-university-community 
partnership. Oregon's Center of Excellence for Behavioral Health and Aging 
(OCEBHA) was conceptualized by the state health authority and initially funded 
using a block grant from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services 
Administration.
RESULTS: OCEBHA seeks to expand the capacity of health and social programs and 
providers to deliver BH services for older adults with serious mental illness 
and substance use disorders through translational research, workforce 
development, and policy innovation.
CONCLUSION: This review article describes the United States' and Oregon's BH and 
aging landscape, highlighting the disconnects between research evidence, 
clinical treatment/intervention, and policy implementation. It outlines the 
rationale for establishing centers like OCEBHA, which was designed to bridge 
these gaps. By detailing OCEBHA's structure and focus areas-translational 
research, workforce development, and policy innovation-the article shows how 
this model can help align evidence-based practices with service delivery and 
policy. It also offers a roadmap for other states seeking to strengthen support 
for older adults with BH needs.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease 
characterized by memory deficits and cognitive decline. It is currently the most 
common cause of dementia globally and carries a significant disease burden, 
given the rising aging population worldwide. Although AD is debilitating for the 
patient, the complex nature of the disease is also a source of tremendous mental 
distress for caregivers. Finding, understanding, and evaluating the best 
treatments can be challenging and overwhelming when coping with a life-changing 
diagnosis of AD. Although there is currently no definite cure for AD, all the 
discussed treatments aim to improve a patient's quality of life and attenuate 
the time spent in disability. This study compiles and discusses the risks, 
benefits, and efficacy of all currently available treatments for AD, including 
treatments that target the control of cognitive and non-cognitive symptoms. 
Additionally, the manuscript discusses investigational therapeutics, including 
small molecules and immunotherapies in phase 2 or 3 clinical trials, and 
assesses non-pharmacological interventions that may alleviate disease burden.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative 
disorders globally, where early diagnosis plays a pivotal role in delaying 
disease progression and improving patient outcomes. In recent years, the rapid, 
multidisciplinary advances in molecular imaging and emerging technologies have 
significantly advanced our understanding of AD pathogenesis, early diagnosis, 
and intervention strategies. Imaging tools such as positron emission tomography 
(PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), alongside emerging technologies like 
retinal imaging, nanosensors, and quantum dots (QDs), are continuously enhancing 
AD diagnostic pathways. Studies on the gut microbiome and extracellular vesicles 
(EVs) offer novel insights into AD pathogenesis. Furthermore, AI-driven 
multimodal data fusion techniques hold great promise for improving diagnostic 
accuracy. Future research will increasingly focus on multi-target synergistic 
intervention strategies, standardization of multimodal imaging, and the 
integration of AI with molecular diagnostics and treatment to enable early 
detection and personalized precision therapy for AD.

Nanoparticles (NPs) play dual roles in neurodegeneration. Incidental NPs, 
generated unintentionally from environmental and industrial sources, are linked 
to oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and disruption of the blood-brain 
barrier in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Engineered NPs 
are designed for diagnosis and therapy using nanobodies, nanozymes, and other 
engineered nanoparticle (ENP) platforms that enable targeted delivery, 
modulation of neuroimmune pathways, and interference with pathological protein 
aggregation. This review aligns source-based classes (incidental versus 
engineered) with composition-based families (metal-based, carbon-based, and 
polymeric or inorganic), and summarizes routes of exposure, mechanistic 
toxicology, and engineered interventions relevant to AD and PD. We also evaluate 
current limitations, including biocompatibility, relevance to chronic exposure, 
and clinical benchmarking, and we outline priorities for translating 
nanotechnology into practical diagnostics and therapeutics for neurodegenerative 
disease.

Modeling Chelator Substituent Effects as Therapeutic Targets in 
Neurodegenerative Diseases.

Kimbrough CJ(1), Cundari TR(1).

76203, United States.

We explore disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) that focus on the front-end 
pathology of widespread neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). From recent studies, a promising DMT route is chelation therapy, which 
addresses disease initiation by redox-active biometals within the central 
nervous system (CNS) that produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and promote 
peptide aggregation. This research focuses on density functional theory (DFT) 
studies of chelator candidates based on tetradentate Schiff bases and 
investigates the physicochemical properties that contribute to effective 
therapeutic capabilities. A property of high interest is the chelate selectivity 
of Cu-(II) vs Zn-(II) vis-à-vis binding to amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides in diseased 
tissues. Design modifications of chelator candidates allow for the 
identification of crucial factors in binding affinity, selectivity, etc. This 
study reveals that electronic factors are much more influential than steric 
effects across the diverse analogue library. The sensitivity of Cu-(II)/Zn-(II) 
selectivity to ring substituent effects is significant, specifically through the 
implementation of complementary electronic pairing between a directing group and 
a ring moiety directly involved in chelation. Electron-donating substituents on 
the phenol ring and electron-withdrawing substituents on the pyridine ring 
enhance the desired Cu-(II)-Schiff base selectivity toward the therapeutic 
target.

BACKGROUND: Tau phosphorylation is associated with neuronal division and 
differentiation in the fetal brain, in neuroblastoma cells, in the hibernating 
brains of ground squirrels and black bears, and in post-mitotic neurons in the 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. The disassembly of the rigid microtubule 
structure of neurons for neuronal division and neurite remodeling requires the 
removal of the microtubule stabilizing protein tau via its phosphorylation.
OBJECTIVE: To determine if tau phosphorylation is required during neural 
embryogenesis.
METHODS: Using an in vitro human model of early embryonic development, human 
embryonic stem cells (hESC) were differentiated into embryoid bodies (EBs; akin 
to an early blastocyst) and then into neuroectodermal rosettes (akin to a 
rudimentary neural tube containing neuroectodermal precursor cells) upon 
treatment with progesterone. The neuroectodermal rosettes were then treated with 
and without LiCl (Cdk5 inhibitor) or roscovitine (GSK-3β inhibitor) and assayed 
for the expression of tau, P-tau, nestin (an early marker of neurogenesis), Cdk5 
and GSK-3β.
RESULTS: Tau was not expressed in hESC, but tau expression and its 
phosphorylation increase upon progesterone-induced differentiation of hESC into 
neuroectodermal rosettes. Both Cdk5 and GSK-3β, enzymes associated with tau 
phosphorylation, were expressed in hESCs, EBs, and neuroectodermal rosettes. The 
GSK-3β inhibitor LiCl, but not the Cdk-5 inhibitor roscovitine, prevented tau 
phosphorylation and nestin expression and the formation of neuroectodermal 
precursor cells.
CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results suggest that progesterone induces tau 
expression and its phosphorylation during the differentiation of neuroectodermal 
rosettes from hESC and suggest that tau and its phosphorylation is obligatory 
for neuronal precursor cell mitosis. The parallels between neural embryogenesis 
and neurodegeneration are discussed in the context of tau phosphorylation and 
the aberrant re-entry of neurons into the cell cycle in AD.

Alzheimer's Disease Dementia (ADD) prognosis is an unmet medical need. 
Mitochondrial dysfunction is an early AD etiopathogenic factor. The present 
study analyzed mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) methylation patterns in blood samples 
from patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who progressed to ADD (P), 
MCI remained stable (NP), and Cognitively Normal (CN) individuals. 
Differentially methylated sites were identified in the D-loop region in both CN 
vs. NP and NP vs. P comparisons, even before β-amyloid positivity. A Random 
Forest model was developed using mtDNA methylation data combined with cognitive 
and risk factor features. Model's performance was assessed by cross-validation 
and tested on an independent set, achieving 84.4% accuracy in training and 83.2% 
(95% CI: 75.2%-89.4%) in testing. For identifying P patients, sensitivity and 
specificity were 95.1% and 70.7%, respectively. The AUC-ROC was 90.3%. The 
developed model demonstrates predictive capacity in distinguishing cognitive 
decline and stability in MCI individuals, independently of their β-amyloid 
status.

scAGG: Sample-level embedding and classification of Alzheimer's disease from 
single-nucleus data.

Verlaan T, Bouland GA, Mahfouz A, Reinders MJT.

Identifying key cell types and genes in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is crucial for 
understanding its pathogenesis and discovering therapeutic targets. Single-cell 
RNA sequencing technology (scRNAseq) has provided unprecedented opportunities to 
study the molecular mechanisms that underlie AD at the cellular level. In this 
study, we address the problem of sample-level classification of AD using 
scRNAseq data, where we predict the disease status of entire samples from the 
gene expression profiles of their cells, which are not necessarily all affected 
by the disease. We introduce scAGG (single-cell AGGregation), a sample-level 
classification model that uses a sample-level pooling mechanism to aggregate 
single-cell embeddings, and show that it can accurately classify AD individuals 
and healthy controls. We then investigate the latent space learnt by the model 
and find that the model learns an ordering of the cells corresponding to disease 
severity. Genes associated with this ordering are enriched in AD-linked 
pathways, including cytokine signalling, apoptosis, and metal ion response. We 
also evaluate two attention-based models that perform on par with scAGG, but 
entropy analysis of their attention scores reveals limited interpretability 
value. As scRNAseq is increasingly applied to large cohorts and cell-level 
disease association annotations do not exist, our approach provides a way to 
classify phenotypes from single-cell measurements. The yielded cell- and 
sample-level severity scores may enable identification of AD-associated cell 
subtypes, paving the way for targeted drug development and personalized 
treatment strategies in AD. Code is available at:

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents a significant global healthcare 
challenge with increasing prevalence in aging populations. Traditional care 
models often focus primarily on symptom management with insufficient attention 
to holistic patient needs.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of an integrated care approach 
combining holistic nursing interventions, innovative technologies, and 
evidence-based practices for enhanced patient outcomes in AD.
METHODS: A mixed-methods quasi-experimental study involving 248 AD patients 
across 9 healthcare facilities over 24 months. The intervention group (n = 126) 
received an integrated care approach while the control group (n = 122) received 
usual care. Outcomes were assessed using validated instruments at baseline and 
6-month intervals.
RESULTS: Patients receiving integrated care showed significantly improved 
cognitive stability (ADAS-Cog change: 4.2 ± 3.1 vs. 7.8 ± 3.6 points, 
p < 0.001), enhanced quality of life (QoL-AD improvement: 3.8 ± 2.4 vs. 
-1.2 ± 2.9 points, p < 0.001), and reduced behavioral symptoms (NPI reduction: 
15.4 ± 10.2 vs. -6.8 ± 12.5 points, p < 0.001). Caregiver burden decreased 
significantly (ZBI reduction: 10.8 ± 7.4 vs. -6.2 ± 8.1 points, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The integrated care approach demonstrates significant benefits 
across multiple domains, supporting its implementation for improving AD patient 
and caregiver outcomes.

CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBPβ), a key transcription factor, plays 
a central role in regulating inflammasome signaling in neurodegenerative 
diseases (NDs). This review synthesizes the mechanisms by which C/EBPβ modulates 
neuroinflammation and its potential as a therapeutic target. We conducted a 
comprehensive systematic review spanning January 1995 to June 2025, 
systematically querying Google Scholar and PubMed with the following keywords: 
neuroinflammation, inflammasome activation, C/EBPβ, therapeutic targeting, and 
neurodegenerative diseases. C/EBPβ exists in three isoforms-LAP1, LAP2, and 
LIP-each with distinct functions in inflammasome activation. In Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), C/EBPβ drives tau cleavage and Aβ pathology through the AEP axis 
and exacerbates neuroinflammation by upregulating APOE4. In Parkinson's disease 
(PD), C/EBPβ silencing reduces α-synuclein aggregation and dopaminergic neuron 
loss by suppressing the NLRP3 inflammasome. In Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis 
(ALS), C/EBPβ is hypothesized to contribute to TDP-43-associated inflammasome 
activation, though this requires further validation. In Multiple Sclerosis (MS), 
C/EBPβ may influence microglial activation and neuroinflammation, as shown in 
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis models. Modulators of the 
C/EBPβ-inflammasome axis include endogenous regulators like gut-derived 
metabolites and pharmacological interventions such as small-molecule inhibitors. 
Therapeutic strategies targeting C/EBPβ hold promise for mitigating 
neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, though challenges remain in achieving 
isoform-specific targeting and blood-brain barrier penetration. Future 
directions include CRISPR-based editing and biomarker development for 
personalized therapies.

Neuropathy is a disorder defined by injury or dysfunction of the peripheral 
nerves, which causes a variety of symptoms, including pain, numbness, and 
weakness. Diabetes, autoimmune illnesses, infections, and chemotherapy are some 
of the possible underlying reasons. Polysaccharides, complex carbohydrates 
derived from diverse natural sources such as plants, fungi, algae, and microbes, 
have garnered a significant role for their multifaceted biological activities 
that have been shown in humans, such as the ability to bind nuclear receptors, 
control inflammation, and scavenge radicals and antioxidants. These properties 
make polysaccharides a potential therapeutic option for preventing and managing 
neuropathy. Many polysaccharides possess strong antioxidant properties, which 
can help protect neurons from oxidative stress. Moreover, they have a broad 
variety of biological actions, including antibacterial and anticancer 
properties, as well as preventive effects against neurological illnesses, 
including neuropathy, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease. Because of their 
diverse spectrum of biological functions, they have drawn a lot of attention for 
their potential as therapeutics, including nerve regeneration and repair, 
neuroprotective, antioxidants, and reducing inflammation. Several studies have 
emphasized the significant potential of polysaccharides for enhancing nerve 
regeneration. This review investigates numerous natural sources of 
polysaccharides, the mechanism of action, and their therapeutic potential for 
neuroprotective or neuropathy management, offering insights into their potential 
role in enhancing patient outcomes and quality of life. This review also 
underscores the therapeutic potential of polysaccharides as adjunct or 
alternative agents in neuropathy management and advocates for further clinical 
validation and mechanistic investigations.

INTRODUCTION: For a blood-based biomarker to be considered a confirmatory test 
for the detection of abnormal amyloid beta (Aβ) levels, the sensitivity and 
specificity must be equivalent to that of current cerebrospinal fluid tests.
METHODS: In the current study we assessed the ability of phosphorylated tau 
(p-tau)217 and Aβ42/40 from the Lumipulse G p-tau217 and β-amyloid ratio 
(1-42/1-40) tests, individually and combined, to predict Aβ positron emission 
tomography status in two sub-cohorts from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers, 
and Lifestyle Study of Ageing.
RESULTS: Testing an Alzheimer's disease continuum cohort, the area under the 
curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for the p-tau217/Aβ42 ratio 
reached 0.961, 93%, 92%, and 93%, respectively. Validation in an 
intention-to-treat cohort demonstrated similar AUC (0.959), with increased 
sensitivity (99%), decreased specificity (87%), and increased accuracy (95%). 
Dual cut-offs generating balanced 95% sensitivity/specificity result in 93% 
accuracy.
DISCUSSION: Combinations of plasma p-tau217 and Aβ42 demonstrate recommended 
performance, confirming the presence of Aβ positivity prior to selection for 
disease-modifying therapies.
HIGHLIGHTS: The phosphorylated tau (p-tau)217/amyloid beta (Aβ)42 ratio had high 
performance to detect Aβ positron emission tomography (PET) status, with > 90% 
sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. p-tau217/Aβ42 ratio dual cut-offs set at 
95% sensitivity and specificity found 10% to 15% of participants in the 
intermediate zone. Cut-offs derived for the intention-to-treat cohort meet 
confirmatory assay criteria for a disease-modifying therapy and can be used in 
clinical settings.

Ageing is the major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common 
neurodegenerative disorder. DNA damage is a hallmark of ageing, particularly 
when occurring at telomeres, genomic regions vulnerable to oxidative damage and 
often challenging for the cell to repair. Here, we show that brains of 3xTg-AD 
mice, an established AD model characterized by amyloid-β (Aβ)-induced pathology, 
exhibit increased activation of DNA damage response (DDR) pathways at telomeres. 
Exposure of mouse primary hippocampal neurons to 42-residue Aβ (Aβ42) oligomers, 
a significant pathogenetic contributor to AD, triggers telomeric DDR by 
increasing the levels of reactive oxygen species caused by calcium imbalance. 
Antisense oligonucleotides targeting non-coding RNAs generated at damaged 
telomeres in vivo (in 3xTg-AD mice) and in vitro reduce neurotoxicity in 
iPSC-derived human cortical neurons and mouse primary neurons while inhibiting 
Aβ42-induced telomeric DDR, and restore transcriptional pathways altered by Aβ 
and found dysregulated in AD patients. These results unveil an unexpected role 
of telomeric DNA damage responses in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, and 
suggest a novel target for the development of RNA-based therapies.

INTRODUCTION: Caregivers' decisions significantly influence Alzheimer's disease 
progression, yet research on the benefits of disease-modifying therapy (DMT) 
from their perspective is limited.
METHODS: This cross-sectional survey included 345 informal caregivers of 
lecanemab-treated patients. We collected online questionnaires from 37 tertiary 
hospitals across 31 provinces/autonomous regions/municipalities in China 
(2024/06/24 ∼ 2024/12/24).
RESULTS: Approximately 94.5% of the caregivers opined that the burden of care 
did not intensify (including remaining constant or being alleviated) subsequent 
to the administration of lecanemab, among which 25.8% of the caregivers stated 
that the burden of care was mitigated. Those caregivers with a higher annual 
family income (≥¥400,000, p < 0.01) and filial caregivers exhibited greater 
confidence in the therapeutic efficacy of lecanemab.
DISCUSSION: Most caregivers hold a positive attitude toward lecanemab, 
particularly filial caregivers. The application of lecanemab may alleviate the 
care burden on caregivers.
HIGHLIGHTS: We conducted the first China national survey on Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) caregiver decision-making and lecanemab experience, collecting 345 
questionnaires. The majority of caregivers in China hold a favorable attitude 
toward lecanemab. Higher education, younger age, and filial relationships are 
associated with reduced caregiver burden. Higher income is linked to increased 
caregiver confidence and better lecanemab adherence. There is a low adoption 
rate of blood-based AD biomarkers in caregiver decisions.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by 
amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulation, tau pathology, and chronic neuroinflammation, 
leading to cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. Currently available 
treatments are liable to provide symptomatic relief; hence, researchers are 
focused on finding some novel molecular targets for developing targeted 
therapies, and also some biomarkers for early detection. Emerging evidence 
suggests that Galectin-3 (Gal-3) serves as a key regulator of microglial 
activation, exhibiting both neuroprotective and neurotoxic effects, depending on 
the stage of disease. The overexpression of Gal-3 leads to increased 
neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction, accelerating 
disease progression while initially promoting Aβ clearance and suppressing 
immune response. Moreover, Gal-3 has been associated with tau 
hyperphosphorylation and aggregation, hence exacerbating synaptic dysfunction 
and neuronal damage. Elevated levels of Gal-3 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and 
serum correlate with disease severity, indicating its potential as a biomarker 
for early diagnosis and disease monitoring. Establishing Gal-3 inhibitors as a 
potential therapeutic target, several preclinical studies indicate their ability 
to lower Aβ and tau accumulation by regulating pro-inflammatory signaling and 
enhancing clearance mechanisms. This approach reduces neuroinflammation by 
suppressing microglial activation and improves cognitive function by preserving 
neuronal function and lowering oxidative stress. This review is intended to 
discuss the intricate role of Gal-3 in AD pathology, such as Aβ aggregation, tau 
pathology, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and microglial activation. 
Further, it explores the therapeutic strategies that Gal-3 could serve as a 
novel biomarker for tracing the disease, and reviews potential therapeutic 
approaches through Gal-3 inhibition for AD management.

In recent years facial recognition software has gone from an area of research to 
widespread adoption and broad public availability. Open-source face recognition 
packages are freely available on the internet for anyone to download, and 
several public websites allow users to run facial recognition on photos without 
needing any technical knowledge or equipment beyond internet access, making 
facial recognition accessible for anyone to use for any purpose. Previous 
research has demonstrated the ability of commercial software to identify a 
person based on facial content in brain imaging. In this study we tested two 
commercial facial recognition programs and a variety of popular open-source 
computer vision and facial recognition software packages to measure how 
accurately they could be used for reidentification of research participants in 
brain imaging studies. We tested a "population to sample" threat model, 
measuring the rates of success for which face recognition software selected the 
correct MRI-based face reconstruction from a set of 182 participants as its 
top-scoring match for input facial photographs. We found that the freely 
available open-source software packages we tested can reidentify a research 
participant with up to 59 % accuracy. This was less than the commercial 
packages, which were able to achieve much higher accuracies in the ranges of 92 
% and 98 % in identical testing scenarios, but it demonstrates the feasibility 
of re-identifying faces in research MRI even by individuals with access to only 
freely available software. As the trust and confidence of potential participants 
is essential to brain imaging research, especially with widespread and mandated 
data-sharing of brain scans, this further supports the need to replace 
identifiable face imagery in brain images to protect the privacy of research 
participants.

Neurodegenerative and neuroimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis (ALS) share a common pathologic hallmark i.e. loss of neurons in the 
central nervous system (CNS), despite diverse pathological manifestations. These 
diseases present major challenges to global health due to incurable or extremely 
difficult to treat, imposing a heavy burden on society and families. Stem cell 
therapy, as a novel promising approach for treating various neurological 
diseases, harnesses the regenerative potential of stem cells to repair damaged 
neural tissues and circuits, and has become the only hope for patients to 
recover their health or delay the deterioration of disease symptoms. In recent 
years, researchers have successfully generated neurons from multiple types of 
stem cells, and good curative effects have been achieved in their animal models 
and in clinical trials. This comprehensive review elaborates on the relevant 
content of stem cell biology, focuses on conducting an in-depth analysis of the 
current application status of various stem cells in major neurodegenerative and 
neuroimmune diseases including MS, AD, PD and ALS, kindling the hope for the 
development of stem cell-based cell therapies in neurological diseases.

Adult hippocampal neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus is well-defined in rodents, 
and its role in cognitive functions as well as its potential as a therapeutic 
target for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease remain a topic 
of great scientific interest. In this study, we evaluated the effects of a novel 
small molecule, OXS-N1, on neurogenesis and behavior in C57Bl/6 wild-type and 
5xFAD Alzheimer's disease model mice, which were tested independently at 
different ages. Modern, home-cage based set-ups were implemented for automated, 
voluntary animal behavioral testing. OXS-N1 failed to enhance hippocampal 
cognitive functions in either cohort as assessed by two hippocampus-dependent 
touchscreen tasks. Contrary to previous short-term assessments, OXS-N1 also had 
no significant treatment effect on adult hippocampal neurogenesis in both 
wild-type and 5xFAD mice. We further analyzed correlations between individual 
mouse neurogenesis levels and behavioral performance independent of treatment. 
The density of adult-born neurons in the dentate gyrus showed no significant 
correlation with spatial pattern separation or reversal learning ability in the 
Location Discrimination task and did not affect associative memory acquisition 
in the Paired-Associates Learning task in either wild-type or 5xFAD mice. Our 
results provide further critical evidence on the complex role of adult 
neurogenesis for hippocampal cognition in health and disease.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that effects memory and 
behaviour. The phytocannabinoid cannabidiol (CBD) has been found to reverse 
impairments of recognition as well as spatial memory deficits of AD transgenic 
mice but had only limited effects on disease-relevant brain pathologies. Recent 
evidence suggests that combining CBD with other cannabinoids including 
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) may lead to improved therapeutic outcomes. 
Thus, this study evaluated the chronic effects of combined treatment with 
3 mg/kg THC and 20 mg/kg CBD on 14.5-month-old APPSwe/PS1ΔE9 (APP/PS1) 
transgenic females and control littermates. Mice were treated with THCxCBD or 
vehicle (VEH) daily via intraperitoneal injections for 3 weeks before 
behavioural testing commenced. AD-relevant behavioural domains were analysed 
utilising Elevated Plus Maze (EPM), Open Field (OF), Novel Object Recognition 
Test (NORT), Social Interaction (SI), Y-Maze (YM), and Prepulse Inhibition Test 
(PPI). APP/PS1 females showed an anxiety-like phenotype and object recognition 
deficits that remained unchanged by cannabinoid treatment. Interestingly, some 
effects of THCxCBD appeared genotype-dependent with cannabinoid treatment 
causing an anxiogenic EPM response in APP/PS1 mice but having an anxiolytic-like 
effect in WT females. Moreover, THCxCBD administration disrupted the novel 
object preference of control females. Noteworthy, THCxCBD significantly 
decreased different fat depots and bodyweight of all mice across genotype. No 
other differences between genotypes or treatment groups were detected. In 
conclusion, the particular cannabinoid combination strategy utilised had no 
prominent therapeutic-like effect in 14.5-month-old APP/PS1 females.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative condition and 
continues to pose significant clinical and research challenges due to its 
complex causes and limited treatment success. Conventional therapies have 
primarily focused on amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau proteins, but these efforts have 
yet to produce optimal results. This review explores emerging interdisciplinary 
strategies that integrate artificial intelligence (AI), small molecule drugs, 
and precision treatments to tackle AD's intricacies. AI has significantly 
enhanced early detection, neuroimaging, and biomarker discovery using machine 
learning and deep learning. These state-of-art methods helps to analyze 
biomarker profiles and imaging data, thereby enabling tailored diagnostic and 
therapeutic strategies for individual patients. At the same time, computational 
methods have expedited the development of small molecules targeting Aβ buildup, 
tau pathology, and inflammation. Emerging treatments, including monoclonal 
antibodies, RNA-based therapies, and nanotechnology, provide promising 
alternatives to conventional approaches. The integration of AI with multi-omics 
and structure-guided drug design supports the creation of precise, 
individualized treatments. However, challenges in ethics, regulation, and 
clinical application persist. This review emphasizes the collaborative potential 
of AI, pharmacology, and biomedical engineering in revolutionizing AD treatment, 
highlighting the need for cross-disciplinary efforts to confront this urgent 
neurological condition.

7-Ketocholesterol (7-KC), a major oxysterol formed through cholesterol 
autoxidation, is increasingly recognized as a pathogenic mediator in ageing and 
chronic disease. Detected in atherosclerotic plaques, Alzheimer's cortex, aged 
retina, and lysosomal storage disorders, 7-KC actively drives oxidative stress, 
chronic inflammation, organelle dysfunction, and oxiapoptophagy. These 
mechanisms underpin its role in cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, and metabolic 
pathologies. Recent advances highlight nutritional antioxidants, pharmacological 
agents, microbial bioremediation, and nanotechnology as promising therapeutic 
avenues. Recognizing 7-KC as both a biomarker and therapeutic target offers 
opportunities for innovation in diagnostics and treatment of age-related and 
inflammatory disorders.

MRI plays an increasingly important role in the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. 
We discuss the expanded role of MRI in the 2024 McDonald diagnostic criteria for 
multiple sclerosis, which include the optic nerve as a fifth anatomical 
location, in addition to the periventricular, juxtacortical or cortical, 
infratentorial, and spinal cord regions. The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis can 
now be confirmed when the criteria of dissemination in space are fulfilled with 
the detection of typical lesions in at least four locations without additional 
evidence. We recommend appropriate imaging strategies and MRI acquisition 
protocols for all aspects of multiple sclerosis diagnosis, including 
fat-saturated sequences for detection of symptomatic optic nerve lesions. 
Diagnostic imaging should always cover the brain and spinal cord and include 
susceptibility-sensitive sequences for the assessment of the central vein sign 
and paramagnetic rim lesions, which can be especially helpful in cases when 
conventional imaging findings are insufficient to establish a diagnosis. We 
discuss how to handle the diagnosis of radiologically isolated presentations of 
multiple sclerosis, which are included in the 2024 criteria. We present 
recommendations for image interpretation and avoidance of misdiagnosis, and 
extend the recommendations to the use of MRI in the diagnosis of multiple 
sclerosis in older people, children, people with vascular comorbidities or 
migraine, and people living outside Europe and North America. Finally, we 
provide recommendations for standardisation of MRI acquisition and communication 
of results to enable an earlier diagnosis while maintaining high diagnostic 
specificity.

BACKGROUND: Neurofilaments are key axonal proteins, with neurofilament light 
(NfL) and heavy (NfH) chain recognised as promising biomarkers for 
neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, 
neurofilament medium chain (NfM) remained previously underexplored due to a lack 
of quantitative assays. In this study, we developed a sensitive immunoassay to 
measure NfM in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and analysed its levels in ALS, 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and Lewy body dementia 
(LBD). Correlations among neurofilaments and their diagnostic performance were 
also evaluated.
METHODS: In this study CSF levels of three neurofilament proteins were measured 
in 305 participants, including patients with ALS (n = 91), AD (n = 59), FTD (n = 
38), LBD (n = 18), non-neurodegenerative controls (CTRL, n = 51), and 48 
individuals initially evaluated for ALS but ultimately diagnosed with other 
conditions (CTRL.DD). NfM levels were quantified using a homemade sandwich 
ELISA, while NfL and NfH were measured using commercialised Ella cartridges.
FINDINGS: All three neurofilaments were significantly elevated in ALS compared 
to CTRL and CTRL.DD groups (p < 0.0001 for both), with NfM and NfL also 
increased in FTD (p < 0.0001 for both) and AD (NfM, p < 0.0001; NfL, p = 0.0001) 
compared to CTRL. NfH demonstrated the greatest distinction between ALS and FTD 
(p < 0.0001). Strong correlations were observed among neurofilament subunits, 
particularly between NfM and NfL (r = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.91-0.94, p < 0.0001). All 
neurofilaments effectively distinguished ALS from CTRL and CTRL.DD, with AUC 
values ranging from 0.92 to 0.99. NfM and NfL showed high accuracy in 
differentiating AD (NfM, AUC: 0.91; NfL, AUC: 0.89) and FTD (NfM, AUC: 0.91; 
NfL, AUC: 0.92) from CTRL, while NfH best separated ALS from FTD (AUC: 0.96).
INTERPRETATION: This study provides a quantitative comparison of NfM with NfL 
and NfH in a neurodegenerative cohort, highlighting its potential diagnostic 
value. Further research with larger cohorts, longitudinal studies, and 
investigations into neurofilament distribution in different compartments is 
needed to clarify the distinct roles of NfM, NfL, and NfH in the diagnosis and 
treatment of neurological diseases.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, places a significant 
burden on individuals and society. In line with the doctrines of Chinese medical 
practice, kidney deficiency and insufficient marrow cannot nourish the brain, 
leading to insufficient blood, cerebral dysfunction, and ultimately dementia. 
Erjing Pills contain wolfberry and Polygonati Rhizoma, which tonify the kidneys 
and improve the essence. Although pharmacological studies have demonstrated that 
Erjing Pills can be used to prevent and treat AD, the detailed action mechanism 
is yet to be determined. To comprehensively reveal the mechanism of action of 
Erjing Pills in the prevention and treatment of AD, three pharmacodynamic 
evaluations, the water maze test, both hematoxylin-eosin and immunohistochemical 
techniques were utilized to assess the effects of Erjing Pills on AD rats. 
Furthermore, plasma and hippocampus metabolomics were conducted by various 
statistical analyses combined with UPLC-Q/TOF-MS were employed for a 
comprehensive and accurate analysis of the in vivo anti-AD effects of Erjing 
Pills. Erjing Pills enhanced learning and memory capacity decreased hippocampal 
Aβ deposition expression, and enhanced hippocampal morphology in AD rats. After 
Erjing Pills treatment, 38 plasma metabolites and 15 hippocampal metabolites of 
AD rats were regressed to levels similar to those of controls. Moreover, 
pathways impacted by Erjing Pills on AD included arachidonic acid metabolism, 
retinol metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, and caffeine metabolism. 
Additionally, adrenaline, leukotriene B4, retinol, and paraxanthine clearly 
distinguished the Erjing Pills group from the AD group. These findings 
significantly enhance our comprehension of the metabolic pathways implicated in 
AD and shed light on the therapeutic mechanisms of Erjing Pills in alleviating 
symptoms in rats with AD.

Alzheimer's disease is an advanced neurodegenerative illness that disturbs 
cognitive behavior. Multiple factors are responsible for the etiology of 
Alzheimer's disease and one of the cores neuropathologic finding is generation 
of hyper-phosphorylated tau. GSK-3β or Glycogen synthase kinase-3β a kinase 
leads to the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein at multiple sites and 
aggregates into neurofibrillary tangles in AD patient's brain. Tideglusib is a 
drug which is under second phase of clinical trial (NCT01350362), impedes the 
GSK-3β at therapeutically concentration that has been established through 
various in silico techniques like scaffold morphing, pharmacokinetic, molecular 
docking and dynamic simulations studies. The Tideglusib based analogues showed 
good interactions with the catalytic dyed residue (Cys199) of GSK-3β GSK-3β, the 
main amino acid responsible for its tau hyperphosphorylation activity. Also, the 
designed analogues of Tideglusib are analyzed for its Multi targeting potential 
with three main receptors (GSK-3β, AChE, BACE) through molecular docking and 
molecular dynamic simulation approaches. SG-09 stands out with the best binding 
affinity and the stable ligand-protein interaction analogues in the time 
interval of 100 ns can be used as Multitargeting drug with further in silico, in 
vitro and in vivo clinical evaluation. This design strategy could thus reap 
considerable clinical and economic rewards.

The high sensitivity and accuracy of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) detection could 
provide strong support for early diagnosis, monitoring of disease progression, 
and effective treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Improving the specificity 
and affinity of sensing materials for Aβ is key to detecting Aβ. Herein, an 
electrochemical sensor based on an unmodified homochiral MOF, Zn-BPIleBp, was 
developed for the first time for the detection of Aβ1-40, with an ultralow 
detection limit of 1.7 pM (7.36 pg/mL). The Zn-BPIleBp sensor also displays 
high-efficiency enantioselectivity and ultrasensitivity in identifying 
diphenylalanine (PhePhe) corresponding to the core recognition motif of Aβ1-40, 
with a high peak current ratio (IL/ID) of 2.78, large potential difference (EL - 
ED) of 140 mV, and ultralow detection limit of 34 fM for l-PhePhe. The sensor 
has been successfully applied for the ultrasensitive quantification of l-PhePhe 
and Aβ1-40 in racemic mixtures, artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) and fetal 
bovine serum (FBS). According to structural and spectral analysis, the high 
sensitivity and affinity of homochiral MOF toward Aβ1-40, without the 
involvement of any biomolecular modifications such as antibodies or aptamers, 
stem from the structural, hydrophobic, and chiral matching between the framework 
and Aβ1-40. This sensor proffers a fast, highly stable, reproducible, 
ultrasensitive, and accurate detection method for Aβ1-40, demonstrating great 
potential in the clinical application of AD. This work also opens up new 
perspectives for designing sensing platforms using MOFs as sensing materials and 
expanding their functionality and applications to the fields of biological and 
medical analysis.

Neurological disorders including gliomas and neurodegenerative diseases are 
characterized by dysregulation of the central nerve system (CNS). Despite recent 
advances in disease-modifying treatments, pharmacological approaches for 
neurological disorders still face limitations due to the complexity of these 
diseases and the challenges in targeting the underlying mechanisms. Magnetic 
hyperthermia, an approach that utilizes magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) to 
generate localized heat in target cells and tissues by responding to an 
alternating magnetic field (AMF), has been developed as a non-pharmacological 
treatment approach for targeting tumor cells or pathogens, primarily through 
thermal inactivation. Recently, beyond its traditional application in thermal 
therapies, magnetic hyperthermia has been increasingly explored for neurological 
diseases. Importantly, recent studies demonstrate the ability of magnetic 
hyperthermia in eliciting various biological effects by means of triggering heat 
shock protein (HSP) signaling, enhancing immune responses, and activating 
heat-sensitive ion channels in neurons. This review highlights the current 
understanding of magnetic hyperthermia in stimulating molecular and cellular 
effects on brain tissue and further discusses its potential in the treatment of 
neurological disorders including Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM), Alzheimer's 
Disease (AD), Parkinson's Disease (PD). The studies discussed in this review 
were selected by using the search tool on PubMed with the suggested key words.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the mechanism of Dihuang Yinzi (DHYZ) in the treatment of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) by integrating metabolomics and experimental 
verification.
METHODS: Forty-eight male APP/PS1 mice were divided into model, high- (DHYZ-H), 
medium- (DHYZ-M), and low-dose DHYZ (DHYZ-L) groups (12 mice per group) 
according to a random number table. Mice in DHYZ groups were gavaged with DHYZ 
6.34, 12.68, and 25.35 g/(kg·d), respectively. Twelve C57BL/6 mice were gavaged 
with distilled water as the blank group. Metabolomics was used to analyze 
differential metabolites in the brains of mice. Morris water maze test was used 
to detect the memory abilities of mice. The hematoxylin-eosin staining and 
transmission electron microscopy were used to observe the general morphology and 
ultrastructure of neurons. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to 
detect the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), reactive oxygen species (ROS), 
and amyloid β -protein 1-42 (A β1-42). The real-time quantitative polymerase 
chain reaction was used to detect the mRNA expressions of density-regulated 
protein 1 (DRP1), fission 1 (FIS1), mitofusin-1 (MFN1), and optic atrophy 
protein 1 (OPA1). Western blot was used to detect the protein expressions of 
cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), protein kinase A (PKA), cAMP response 
binding protein (CREB), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), synapsin 1 
(SYN1), synaptophysin (SYP), and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95).
RESULTS: A total of 82 differential metabolites were identified in the brains of 
APP/PS1 mice, among which 7 differential metabolites could be regulated by DHYZ. 
After DHYZ intervention, the memory abilities of mice significantly increased 
(P<0.05 or P<0.01), the number of synapses and neurons in the hippocampus 
increased, and the mitochondrial morphology and structure were relatively 
intact. The DHYZ groups exhibited a significant reduction in hippocampal ROS and 
A β1-42 levels, along with a significant elevation in SOD level (P<0.05 or 
P<0.01). The mRNA expressions of DRP1 and FIS1 were reduced, while the mRNA 
expressions of MFN1 and OPA1 were increased after DHYZ treatment (P<0.05 or 
P<0.01). The cAMP/PKA/CREB-BDNF pathway was activated, and the expressions of 
SYN1, SYP and PSD95 proteins were significantly increased in the DHYZ-H group 
(P<0.05 or P<0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: DHYZ could improve mitochondrial dynamics and synaptic plasticity 
in APP/PS1 mice, inhibit oxidative stress, and thereby enhancing learning and 
memory abilities in APP/PS1 mice. Its mechanism might be related to activation 
of the cAMP/PKA/CREB-BDNF signaling pathway.

BACKGROUND: The protein-metabolite interactions play a pivotal role in the 
pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the causal significance of 
these interactions in AD pathogenesis remains elusive.
METHODS: We integrated datasets of protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL), 
metabolite quantitative trait loci (mQTL), and genome-wide association study 
(GWAS) for AD. Initially, we performed MR analysis to identify proteins and 
metabolites causally associated with AD risk. To guarantee the robustness of 
these findings, Bayesian colocalization analysis was employed to confirm shared 
genetic signals. Meanwhile, Steiger filtering was utilized to verify the 
directionality of causal effects. Sensitivity analyses were further carried out 
to assess potential pleiotropy and bias. Moreover, we employed MR analysis to 
assess the causal relationships between proteins and metabolites, identifying 
protein-metabolite pairs that are associated with AD. Finally, we evaluated the 
druggability of these causal proteins as potential therapeutic targets.
RESULTS: Proteomic and metabolomic MR analyses identified 14 proteins and 50 
metabolites causally associated with AD. Among these, five proteins (BIN1, C1R, 
SHPS1, LILRB1, and TMEM106B) passed Bayesian colocalization analysis 
(PPH4 ≥ 80%). Notably, LILRB1 exhibited a protective effect against AD, while 
BIN1, C1R, SHPS1, and TMEM106B were implicated as risk factors for the disease. 
Of the 50 metabolites, 38 passed sensitivity and Steiger filtering analyses and 
were utilized for further protein-metabolite pair analysis. Subsequent MR 
analysis revealed 13 protein-metabolite pairs associated with AD, involving four 
proteins (BIN1, C1R, SHPS1, and LILRB1) and 12 metabolites. Notably, drugs 
targeting BIN1, including M344, L-type calcium channel blockers, and BIN1 
monoclonal antibodies, have been reported as potential treatments for AD. For 
the remaining three drug targets, medications used for other diseases were 
identified as potentially applicable.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight four proteins as potential drug targets for 
AD, and suggest their corresponding protein-metabolite pairs should be 
prioritized for analysis of potential mechanistic pathways.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder strongly associated 
with aging, and Dauricine (DAU) has demonstrated significant 
neuropharmacological properties for AD treatment. However, its bioavailability 
is significantly limited when administered orally, leaving the mechanisms 
underlying its effects on AD largely unexplored. In this study, a DAU-loaded 
thermosensitive gel was formulated for delivery via the nasal-nerve route, and 
its potential to enhance the bioavailability of DAU in rat plasma and 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was assessed through a pharmacokinetic study. The 
anti-Alzheimer's disease (AD) mechanism of DAU was investigated using network 
pharmacology approaches, molecular docking, and dynamics simulations, 
complemented by in vivo experimental validation. DAU can be effectively 
incorporated into a thermosensitive gel and administered to the brain within 
30 min via intranasal delivery. Following nasal administration, the 
pharmacokinetic parameters of DAU in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma were 
significantly elevated compared to oral administration (**P < 0.01), indicating 
a substantial improvement in bioavailability at equivalent doses. Behavioral 
studies demonstrated that DAU (dose of 1 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg in gel) enhanced 
cognitive function in intracerebroventricular-streptozotocin (ICV-STZ) rats and 
decelerated aging processes by reversing oxidative stress and mitigating 
neuronal apoptosis. Additionally, DAU contributed to lowering blood glucose 
levels, increasing insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) content, and reducing 
insulin resistance. Network pharmacological analysis, molecular docking, 
molecular dynamics simulations, and in vivo experiments collectively suggested 
that DAU exerted significant therapeutic effects on Alzheimer's disease by 
inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Our study demonstrates a significant 
enhancement in the bioavailability of DAU in the brain via nasal-nerve delivery 
route and also this research is the first to report that DAU ameliorates 
cognitive impairment in ICV-STZ rats through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Our 
findings contribute to the scientific understanding of DAU's potential in 
Alzheimer's disease treatment and offer a novel experimental foundation for the 
development of anti-Alzheimer's drugs.

This chapter focuses on how advanced computational techniques can reveal common 
pathways and interactions seemingly between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and breast 
cancer (BC). It also highlights their roles in bridging the gap between 
neurodegenerative and oncogenic processes by analyzing gene networks and 
identifying essential genes such as GAPDH, HSP90AA1, and HSPA8, which show 
differential regulation in AD and BC. These genes are upregulated in AD and 
downregulated in BC, illustrating their involvement in both disease contexts. A 
significant aspect of the analysis is the role of hub-bottleneck proteins within 
critical pathways. These hub-bottleneck proteins, including those involved in 
estrogen signaling, Alzheimer's disease pathways, neurodegeneration, and cancer 
pathways, serve as central nodes in the PPI networks. Their positioning 
underscores their crucial role in mediating disease mechanisms and influencing 
the progression of both AD and BC. The chapter emphasizes integrating gene 
expression data with PPI networks to uncover these critical nodes and 
interactions contributing to both diseases. Using network-based analysis and 
transcriptomics integration tools, it provides a detailed understanding of how 
shared genetic markers and their interactions influence disease mechanisms. This 
approach enables the identification of potential biomarkers and therapeutic 
targets by revealing underlying molecular connections and critical pathways 
involving hub-bottleneck proteins. The insights gained from gene overlap and PPI 
networks can serve as valuable input data for future studies focused on 
structural analysis. By laying the groundwork for understanding shared pathways 
and protein interactions, the research sets the stage for more detailed 
structural investigations and the development of precision medicine strategies 
tailored to the specific molecular features of Alzheimer's and breast cancer, 
inspiring the development of more effective treatments.

The pathophysiological scenario of Alzheimer's disease (AD) includes the 
misfolding and mis-sorting of two cellular proteins: Amyloid-β as plaques and 
microtubule-associated protein Tau as intracellular neurofibrillary tangles 
(NFTs). The protein oligomers are the short-lived but, highly reactive species 
which mediate toxicity, synaptic loss, neurodegeneration and ultimately 
cognitive decline. Tau oligomers can propagate through various pathway viz. the 
exosomal pathway, neurotransmission, cell-to-cell junction, bulk endocytosis and 
receptor-mediated internalization etc. The preparation, isolation and detection 
of oligomers were of immense importance in the current field for designing 
therapeutics and diagnostics. Microglia are the prime immune cells in brain 
which maintain the homeostasis via synaptic surveillance and tissue-remodeling. 
But, the senescent microglia mediate pro-inflammation, oxidative damage and 
phagocytosis in diseased brain. The extracellular Tau oligomers were found to 
interact with microglial purinergic receptor P2Y12 which then led to microglial 
migration, activation and phagocytosis via various remodeled actin structure. 
P2Y12 receptor mediates Tau oligomers-induced microglial chemotaxis by 
localizing with migratory actin structures such as- filopodia, lamellipodia, 
podosome etc. These beneficial roles of P2Y12 in microglial chemotaxis, actin 
remodeling and Tau clearance can be intervened as a therapeutic target in AD.

Research on the Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been going on for over 100 years, 
but there is yet to be found an effective cure that has passed all the clinical 
trials. However, many compounds have been explored for their effects on AD 
patients, compounds that could help ease the disease symptoms or help slow down 
the disease progression or reverse the effects of the disease. Small molecules 
like toluidine blue and melatonin are seen to be useful against AD. Natural 
compounds were seen to have an exceptional potential as therapeutics for AD. 
Highly branched polymers, dendrimers were also seen to be effective Tau and AD 
therapeutics as drug-delivery systems and on their own. Metal complexes and 
metal nanoparticles also showed success against AD. Synthesis of a bifunctional 
compound that was an effective chelating agent for Cu, useful against Tau and 
Amyloid-β (Aβ) and was catalysed by excess Cu metal present in association with 
Aβ was also done. It is necessary to take forward the effective therapeutics to 
further levels of clinical trials.

OBJECTIVES: Grounded in life course theory, this study examines the long-term 
impact of childhood grandparent co-residence on self-perception of aging (SPA) 
and depressive symptoms in older adulthood, comparing young-old adults 
(65-74 years) and old-old adults (75+ years) in the United States.
METHODS: Data were drawn from the Health and Retirement Study across three time 
points (T1: 2008/2010, T2: 2012/2014, and T3: 2016/2018), with a sample of 9,070 
adults aged 65 and older. Longitudinal mediation analysis was employed to 
explore the relationships between childhood grandparent co-residence, SPA, and 
depressive symptoms, stratified by age group.
RESULTS: Childhood grandparent co-residence was positively associated with SPA 
(B = .06, ρ < .05) and depressive symptoms (B = .14, ρ < .001) among young-old 
adults. SPA partially mediated this relationship (B = -.03, bias-corrected 
CI = [-.04, -.02]), buffering the detrimental impact on depressive symptoms. 
These associations were not significant among old-old adults. SPA was negatively 
associated with depressive symptoms in both young-old (B = -.46, ρ < .001) and 
old-old adults (B = -.45, ρ < .001).
DISCUSSION: Given the significant association between SPA and depressive 
symptoms, SPA-targeted interventions can help reduce depressive symptoms in both 
groups. Special attention should be given to young-old adults with childhood 
grandparent co-residence experiences. Cognitive behavioral therapy may help 
reinterpret these experiences by reshaping negative thoughts and encouraging a 
more positive view of family dynamics. Further research is needed to address the 
specific needs of old-old adults to promote their well-being.

Lipid droplets (LDs) are dynamic organelles central to cellular lipid 
homeostasis. Emerging evidence implicates LDs in Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
pathogenesis, though their cell-type-specific roles remain poorly defined. Here, 
we investigated the effects of amyloid-beta oligomers (AβOs) on LDs 
accumulation, oxidative stress, and inflammatory activation in primary 
astrocytes and neurons. We found that AβOs selectively triggered robust LDs 
formation in astrocytes, accompanied by significant increases in triglyceride 
(TG) and cholesterol (TC) content, and upregulation of the LD-associated protein 
perilipin 2 (PLIN2). Furthermore, AβOs induced pronounced oxidative stress, 
evidenced by elevated Malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), and 
promoted inflammatory activation via increased secretion of tumor necrosis 
factor α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in astrocytes. By contrast, neurons 
showed no significant changes in lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, or 
inflammatory responses under identical treatment conditions. Our results 
underscore the central role of astrocytes in AβO-induced metabolic and 
inflammatory dysregulation, revealing a cell-type-specific vulnerability with 
potential implications for AD pathogenesis. These in vitro findings provide a 
mechanistic basis for lipid-focused therapeutic strategies, pending further in 
vivo validation.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder of the 
central nervous system that causes cognitive decline, memory loss, and 
neuropsychiatric symptoms. The condition is characterized by the buildup of 
β-amyloid plaques (Aβ), neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), and persistent 
neuroinflammation. Despite ongoing research, current therapeutic strategies 
remain palliative and fail to halt or reverse disease progression, underscoring 
the need for novel treatment approaches. Recent evidence highlights neutrophils, 
the most abundant blood cells, as key contributors to AD pathology. These cells 
cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) via specific molecular pathways and 
accumulate in brain regions such as the cortex and hippocampus, particularly 
near Aβ plaques and NFTs. Once in the brain, neutrophils release reactive oxygen 
species (ROS), generate neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) via NETosis, and 
secrete proinflammatory cytokines and granule components. This cascade 
contributes to BBB disruption, increased Aβ deposition, glial activation, 
chronic inflammation, neurodegeneration, and cognitive impairment in AD. This 
review highlights the molecular mechanisms underlying both lytic and non-lytic 
NET formation (NETosis), explores peripheral neutrophil alterations and their 
migration pathways across the BBB, and discusses the role of intracerebral 
neutrophils, NETs, and NETosis in AD pathophysiology. Finally, we explore 
emerging therapeutic strategies targeting NETs, neutrophils, and NETosis as 
potential disease-modifying approaches in AD.

In previous studies, it has been demonstrated that lipoprotein-mimicking 
nanoparticles with a solid lipid core of cholesteryl oleate, a lecithin coating 
and adsorptively bound apolipoprotein E3 (ApoE) may serve as a potential vehicle 
for drug delivery to the central nervous system. In this study, the impact of 
drug characteristics, particularly lipophilicity, was evaluated to achieve a 
stable incorporation of model drugs into these lipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs). 
This study explored the lipophilicity of flurbiprofen, a potential drug in the 
treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and its prodrug flurbiprofenaxetil across 
varying pH levels. Our findings highlight how flurbiprofen's lipophilicity was 
influenced by its protonation state, affecting its incorporation into LNPs and 
consequently its release behaviour under physiological conditions, while 
flurbiprofenaxetil showed minimal variations due to its chemical structure. We 
also investigated the interaction between lipoprotein mimicking nanoparticles 
and primary porcine brain capillary endothelial cells to improve drug delivery 
across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Permeation studies indicated that 
modification with ApoE enhanced the bidirectional permeability of LNPs across 
the BBB through receptor-mediated transcytosis. Furthermore, we demonstrated and 
identified the uptake mechanism involving the low density lipoprotein 
receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), allowing these LNPs to be recognized by the 
same receptors as endogenous lipoproteins. Overall, these findings highlight the 
potential of ApoE modified LNPs as a promising strategy for targeted drug 
delivery to the brain.

Recently, the role of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in 
neurodegenerative activities has garnered significant attention, yet the role in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unclear. Based on our previous single-cell RNA 
sequencing data sets of PBMCs from healthy controls and AD patients, we 
identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between healthy individuals and 
AD patients. These DEGs are involved in pathways related to apoptosis 
regulation, cognition, synaptic organization, and other AD pathology-associated 
biological processes using Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and 
Genomes analysis. JUN, CHCHD10, HSPA8, RETN, S100A8, ITGA2B, HBG2, PPBP, and 
HLA-DQA2 have high correlation with these pathways. To further investigate the 
role of PBMCs in AD, PBMCs from 9- or 6-month-old wild-type mice were, 
respectively, injected into 9- or 6-month-old AD mice; we found that PBMCs could 
reduce Aβ plaques and phosphor-tau deposition and improve cognitive function in 
AD mice without side effects. Additionally, intersection analysis with AD 
pathogenic genes, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction validation, 
and receiver operating characteristic curves demonstrated increased JUN 
expression in PBMCs of AD patients with higher specificity in the diagnosis of 
AD, with no significant sex- and age-dependent differences observed in its 
expression. This study provides a critical theoretical foundation for the 
clinical application of PBMCs and identifies JUN as a key regulatory gene within 
PBMCs.

BackgroundDepression in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) is 
common, disabling and difficult to treat. Pathological protein deposition in PD 
and AD has been associated with late-life depression, and inflammatory and 
vascular changes have been proposed as key mechanisms underlying depression in 
neurodegenerative disorders. Monoclonal antibody therapies (mAbs) effectively 
clear pathological protein aggregates in PD and AD but are associated with 
cerebral inflammation and microvascular damage.ObjectiveWe conducted a 
systematic review and meta-analysis to determine whether mAb treatment 
influences the risk or severity of depression in AD and PD.MethodsCochrane, Ovid 
MEDLINE/PubMed, PsycINFO and Embase databases were searched for articles 
published from inception to 8 April 2025. Randomized controlled trials of mAbs 
for PD or AD reporting a validated measure of depressive symptoms, or depression 
incidence were included and meta-analyzed.ResultsWe identified 13 studies 
including 8603 participants (treatment arm: n = 4690, placebo arm: n = 3913). 
All studies reported depression incidence as an adverse event, but none assessed 
changes in depressive symptom severity using standardized mood scales. 
Meta-analysis revealed no significant difference in the incidence of depression 
with mAb therapy (log risk ratio: -0.24, 95% CI (-0.52, 0.04), 
p = 0.09).ConclusionsWe observed no significant association between mAb therapy 
and risk of depression in PD or AD. However, the absence of validated symptom 
assessments in these trials represents a critical gap in outcome reporting. 
Future trials should incorporate standardized depressive symptom measures as 
outcomes to evaluate the potential neuropsychiatric risks of these therapies.

The ERM protein family, comprising ezrin, radixin, and moesin, mediates 
membrane-cytoskeleton interactions, regulating key cellular functions. This 
study investigated the expression of ERM proteins in microglia surrounding 
amyloid plaques in AppNL-F knock-in mice and their role in inflammatory 
responses. Moesin was predominantly localized to plaque-associated microglia, 
and in vitro knockdown experiments revealed distinct roles of ERM proteins in 
cytokine regulation. These findings suggest that each ERM protein contributes to 
microglial function through distinct mechanisms. Further elucidating the roles 
of individual ERM proteins in microglial function may lead to the identification 
of novel therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative diseases.

BackgroundAmyloid-β (Aβ) and Aβ plaques can disrupt synaptic plasticity, leading 
to abnormalities in sensory function and cognition in Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
The whisker sensorimotor system is crucial for tactile perception, providing 
rodents with spatial and textural features information about their surroundings. 
Sensory inputs from whiskers have a clear topological localization in the barrel 
cortex.ObjectivePrevious studies have suggested that sensory stimulation can 
effectively ameliorate the pathology of AD mice and improve cognitive 
performance. However, it remains unknown whether tactile stimulation via 
whiskers can activate cortical sensory areas, protect synaptic structure and 
function.MethodsHere, we established a whisker deprivation (WD) model in the 
5×FAD mouse.ResultsWe found that WD aggravated the deposition of Aβ1-42, 6E10 
and fibrotic Aβ in the cortex, hippocampus and thalamus. Simultaneously, changes 
in dendritic morphology were consistent with the decreased pCreb levels in the 
hippocampal dentate gyrus region. WD also reduced axonal projections from layer 
L4/L5a to L2/3 in the barrel cortex, as well as projections from the entorhinal 
cortex to the DG, which may disrupt the integration of information in cortical 
functional columns and weaken the efficiency of information transmission. 
Additionally, we observed sex differences in effects of WD on AD pathology in 
5×FAD mice, with female mice being more sensitive to WD treatment. Ultimately, 
WD impaired working memory, spatial memory and social behavior in 5×FAD 
mice.ConclusionsOur study suggested that WD exacerbated the progression of AD 
pathology in 5×FAD mice, which implicated with Aβ aggravation and synaptic 
dysfunction.

Exosomes, small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) that range in Size from 30 to 150 
nm in diameter, have emerged as crucial mediators of intercellular communication 
within the central nervous system (CNS). They play significant roles in the 
pathogenesis and progression of various neurological and psychiatric disorders, 
including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, ischemic stroke, depression, 
bipolar disorder, and autism spectrum disorder. Exosomes carry a diverse cargo 
of proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and other bioactive molecules that can 
influence neuronal function and synaptic plasticity. In disease states, exosomes 
derived from stressed neurons or glial cells can propagate neuroinflammation, 
synaptic dysfunction, and cognitive decline. They may also mediate the spread of 
abnormal proteins or microRNAs, disrupting neuronal connectivity and 
neurotransmitter signaling and contributing to the development of 
proteinopathies and neurotoxicity. Owing to their presence in bodily fluids such 
as blood plasma, cerebrospinal fluid, and saliva, exosomes hold promise as 
biomarkers for these disorders. Moreover, their regulatory roles present new 
opportunities for developing novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic 
interventions. This review provides an overview of the multifaceted roles of 
exosomes in neurological and psychiatric disorders. We delve into their 
contributions to disease pathogenesis, their potential as diagnostic biomarkers, 
and the innovative therapeutic strategies leveraging exosome-based delivery 
systems. By exploring the current state of research, we aim to highlight the 
translational potential of exosomes in revolutionizing the diagnosis and 
treatment of these disorders.

INTRODUCTION: Most individuals with isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior 
disorder (iRBD) develop dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) or Parkinson's disease 
(PD). Brain biomarkers predicting specific phenoconversion trajectories are 
lacking.
METHODS: In this multicenter diffusion magnetic resonance imaging study (261 
iRBD, 177 controls), free water (FW) was measured in the nucleus basalis of 
Meynert (NBM) and posterior substantia nigra (SN). Among 230 iRBD patients with 
follow-up, 64 converted (16 DLB, 38 PD). Time-to-event analyses were performed 
to assess differential phenoconversion.
RESULTS: Phenoconverters had higher FW in the NBM and posterior SN. Only FW in 
the NBM predicted conversion to DLB over PD. NBM volume predicted DLB 
conversion, but only FW remained significant when both were modeled. FW in the 
NBM correlated with lower MoCA scores in iRBD.
DISCUSSION: FW in the NBM is a sensitive biomarker of cognitive decline and DLB 
progression in iRBD, outperforming volume and supporting its use in early 
stratification.
HIGHLIGHTS: FW in the NBM specifically identifies conversion to DLB. Increased 
FW in the NBM is associated with lower global cognition in iRBD. FW in the SN in 
iRBD does not relate more to DLB than PD. FW in the NBM is a biomarker of 
differential phenoconversion in iRBD.

INTRODUCTION: The impact of chronic kidney disease (CKD) on Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) plasma biomarkers is poorly understood. We tested whether kidney function 
decline affects the predictive accuracy of plasma biomarkers on 
neuropsychological or neuroimaging outcomes.
METHODS: Three hundred thirty-three non-demented older adults were included. 
Linear regressions related plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein, neurofilament 
light chain (NfL), amyloid beta 42, and phosphorylated tau231, with a 
blood-based biomarker x estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) interaction 
term, to cross-sectional and longitudinal (mean follow-up time = 6.4 ± 2.8 
years) neuropsychological and neuroimaging outcomes.
RESULTS: Plasma NfL interacted with eGFR on the longitudinal trajectory of 
nearly all neuropsychological outcomes (p values < 0.02) and several 
neuroimaging outcomes (p values < 0.02). Associations were stronger in 
individuals with no CKD/stage 1 and stage 2 CKD, while associations were weaker 
or not significant in individuals with stage 3 CKD.
DISCUSSION: Among older adults free of severe CKD, the ability of plasma NfL to 
predict key AD-related biomarker outcomes was moderated by renal function.
HIGHLIGHTS: Reduced kidney function was associated with increased blood 
biomarker levels. The predictive accuracy of neurofilament light chain was 
reduced in participants with kidney dysfunction. Even mild kidney dysfunction 
can affect blood biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease.

INTRODUCTION: Dementia is a progressive neurocognitive disorder affecting aging 
populations worldwide. Understanding its incidence trends is essential for 
planning preventive strategies and healthcare services, particularly in 
countries with aging demographics like Canada. This study aimed to examine 
national trends in the age-standardized incidence rates of newly diagnosed 
dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, among Canadians aged 65 years or older 
from 2007 to 2022.
METHODS:  We conducted a retrospective, population-based trend analysis using 
the Canadian Chronic Disease Surveillance System (CCDSS), administered by the 
Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC). The CCDSS aggregates de-identified 
administrative health data supplied by provincial and territorial health 
ministries, including physician billing claims, hospital discharge abstracts, 
and health insurance registry data. Dementia cases were ascertained using 
validated International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9/ICD-10 diagnostic 
codes for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias applied to physician and 
hospital records (case definition and code list per CCDSS protocols). The study 
period covered fiscal years 2007-2008 through 2021-2022, with supplementary data 
for 2022-2023 where available. Age-standardized incidence rates were calculated 
using the 2011 Canadian standard population. Data completeness for physician 
billing and hospital discharge records exceeded 95% in participating 
jurisdictions; however, some provinces/territories had partial or missing 
submissions in certain years. All analyses used aggregated, de-identified counts 
provided by CCDSS; no individual-level records were accessed.
RESULTS: In 2022, the crude incidence rate of newly diagnosed dementia among 
Canadians aged 65 years and older was 1,323 per 100,000 population per year 
(95%CI: 1315-1331). By sex, females had a higher crude incidence (1,437 per 
100,000 population per year; 95%CI: 1425-1449) than males (1,194 per 100,000 
population per year; 95%CI: 1183-1206). Incidence increased markedly with 
advancing age: 610 per 100,000 population per year (95%CI: 604-617) in those 
aged 65-79, and 3,669 per 100,000 population per year (95%CI: 3640-3697) among 
individuals aged more than 80. Regional disparities were observed: Nunavut had 
the highest age-standardized rate (1,700 per 100,000 population per year; 95%CI: 
921-2969) while Saskatchewan had the lowest (1,154 per 100,000 population per 
year; 95%CI: 1108-1203). From 2007 to 2022, the age-standardized incidence 
declined overall; this pattern may potentially reflect improvements in 
prevention, risk-factor control, or early detection, although causal attribution 
cannot be established from these data alone.
CONCLUSION: Although the age-standardized incidence of newly diagnosed dementia 
in Canada declined modestly between 2007 and 2022, substantial sex, age, and 
regional disparities remain. The findings emphasize the need for ongoing 
investment in dementia prevention, equitable diagnostic access, and 
region-specific interventions. With the aging population, coordinated public 
health strategies remain essential to sustain progress and reduce the future 
burden of dementia on individuals, caregivers, and healthcare systems.

Hypoxia and psychedelics, despite their distinct origins, both induce altered 
states of consciousness and promote neuroplasticity, suggesting a shared 
underlying mechanism relevant to neuropsychiatric treatment and neurological 
recovery. Terminal lucidity, the transient resurgence of cognitive function in 
late-stage dementia, highlights the brain's latent capacity for rapid 
reorganization, a phenomenon that may be driven by transient hypoxia. Similarly, 
acute intermittent hypoxia and pharmacological agents like HypoxyStat, which 
modulate oxygen availability, have emerged as potential strategies for enhancing 
neural adaptability. This perspective explores the hypothesis that controlled 
reductions in oxygen availabilitywhether through psychedelics, near-death 
experiences, meditation, holotropic breathwork, or hypoxia therapiestrigger 
calcium signaling pathways that promote synaptogenesis and the formation of new 
neural circuits. Rather than restoring damaged connections, this process may 
enable functional rerouting, thereby supporting cognitive resilience and 
behavioral compensation in conditions such as stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and 
psychiatric disorders. By integrating insights from psychedelic research, 
hypoxia-based therapies, and neuroplasticity studies, we propose a unifying 
framework that leverages altered oxygen homeostasis as a novel therapeutic 
strategy for neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases.

Age-related cognitive decline, a hallmark of neurodegenerative disorders such as 
Alzheimer's disease, has been increasingly associated with metabolic 
dysregulation. Targeting metabolic pathways to enhance brain function and slow 
neurodegeneration presents a novel therapeutic approach. This review discusses 
key metabolic interventions that may reverse or delay cognitive decline. 
Mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and impaired energy metabolism are 
central to neurodegenerative progression. Therapies aimed at boosting 
mitochondrial biogenesis, such as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) 
precursors, adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activators, 
and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) 
modulators, have shown promise in improving neuronal energy balance and reducing 
oxidative damage. Metabolic interventions like caloric restriction, intermittent 
fasting, and ketogenic diets have demonstrated neuroprotective effects by 
enhancing insulin sensitivity, promoting autophagy, and shifting the brain's 
energy reliance toward ketone bodies, which improves cognitive function. These 
strategies also mitigate neuroinflammation, a key driver of neuronal damage, by 
modulating immune responses and reducing the accumulation of toxic protein 
aggregates. Lipid metabolism also plays a crucial role in maintaining neuronal 
integrity. Enhancing lipid turnover, optimizing fatty acid profiles, and 
regulating cholesterol homeostasis may improve synaptic plasticity and reduce 
neuroinflammation, offering additional therapeutic avenues. By integrating 
current insights into metabolic regulation, this review underscores the 
potential of metabolic therapies to reverse or mitigate the cognitive decline 
associated with aging. Advancing our understanding of the intricate relationship 
between metabolism and neurodegeneration may pave the way for novel treatments 
targeting age-related cognitive impairment.

Alzheimer's Disease is a growing health concern, with no available 
disease-modifying treatments. A previous report suggested that a Delta Opioid 
Receptor (DOR) antagonist could prevent Alzheimer's-like pathology; however, no 
DOR antagonists are clinically approved. We thus expanded on our previous 
structure-activity relationship work on morphinan scaffold DOR antagonists to 
generate and evaluate new DOR antagonist ligands. We identified a lead compound 
12 (SRI-22136) with sub-nM DOR potency, high selectivity, and high inhibition of 
β-secretase activity. We further evaluated 12 in CD-1 mice, finding full 
antagonist efficacy at 1 mg/kg by the intraperitoneal route. We then tested the 
ability of 12 to prevent Alzheimer's-like pathology in a 5XFAD transgenic mouse 
model, with daily treatment from 2 to 5 months of age. This treatment completely 
prevented Alzheimer's-like pathology, including memory deficits, β-secretase 
activity, Aβ1-42 accumulation, and brain inflammatory markers. Together these 
results suggest 12 as a potential new lead compound to prevent Alzheimer's 
Disease.

Background: Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is the second most common type 
of cognitive impairment in the world after Alzheimer's disease (AD). At present, 
there is no specific drug for VCI. This study aims to confirm the role of 
electroacupuncture (EA) preconditioning in improving the long-term potentiation 
(LTP) of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) rats with human embryonic stem 
cell (hESC)-derived medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) neural progenitor 
transplantation and to investigate its possible mechanism. Methods: Rats with 
two-vessel occlusion (2VO) were selected as models for the study of VCI. The 
rats in the 2VO + cell + EA group were given EA for 7 days after modeling. On 
the 7th day, MGE neural progenitors were transplanted into the hippocampus of 
CCH rats. 2 weeks after transplantation, we detected the expressions of Iba1, 
CX3CL1/CX3CR1, Bcl2/Bax, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and tyrosine 
receptor kinase B (TrkB) in the hippocampus of rats by western blot. 
Immunofluorescence staining was used to observe the morphologies of microglia 
and the survival and differentiation of transplanted cells. Microglial 
morphologies were quantitatively analyzed using the AnalyzeSkeleton. 8 weeks 
after transplantation, the LTP in the hippocampus of brain slices was detected 
to evaluate the learning and memory function of the rats with CCH. Results: 2 
weeks after transplantation, we observed that MGE neural progenitors survived 
and differentiated into neurons in the hippocampus of CCH rats. Inflammation and 
apoptosis appeared in the hippocampus of rats after the interruption of cerebral 
blood flow. EA preconditioning notably alleviated the inflammatory response and 
inhibited cell apoptosis in the hippocampus. Moreover, we detected that the 
expressions of BDNF and TrkB were increased in the hippocampus of rats in the 
2VO + cell group and 2VO + cell + EA groups, especially in the 2VO + cell + EA 
groups. 8 weeks after transplantation, the electrophysiological experiment 
results showed that the LTP value in the 2VO group was 103.1% ± 2.316%. Compared 
with the 2VO group, LTP value increased in the 2VO + cell group and 
2VO + cell + EA group, which were 136.2% ± 1.603% and 170.8% ± 15.82%, 
respectively. The increase of LTP value in the 2VO + cell + EA group was more 
obvious. Conclusion: MGE neural progenitor transplantation improves the LTP of 
CCH rats, and EA preconditioning can enhance the efficacy of cell 
transplantation. This enhancement mechanism may be attributed to the effect of 
EA preconditioning on ameliorating the ischemic microenvironment.

A 52-year-old male with early-stage Alzheimer's disease and long-standing 
anxiety received 30 repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation sessions over 8 
months and 20-month Mediterranean diet intervention. Neuropsychological 
assessments [Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Mini-Mental State Examination 
(MMSE), Clinical Dementia Rating, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA), Hamilton 
Depression Rating Scale (HAMD), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) and 
resting-state electroencephalogram (rsEEG) were conducted at baseline, during 
treatment, and at 6-month follow-up. After treatment, MoCA and MMSE scores 
improved by 6 and 5 points; HAMA and HAMD scores declined by 7 and 3 points. 
rsEEG showed progressive increases in individual alpha peak frequency (8.69 to 
10.22 Hz), enhancement of alpha power, and reduction in theta power. 
Cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-β42 levels also normalized. The patient reported 
marked mental well-being.

Alzheimer's disease poses intricate challenges, affecting cognition and 
behavior, notably marked by agitation. The FDA's approval of brexpiprazole, an 
atypical antipsychotic, stands as a milestone, representing the first treatment 
for Alzheimer's-related agitation. brexpiprazole's modulation of 
serotonin-dopamine activity has proven effective in clinical trials, reducing 
agitation as measured by CMAI scores. Gradual dosage escalation is recommended, 
with potential side effects including nasopharyngitis, urinary tract infections, 
dizziness, somnolence, headache, and insomnia. Also useful for schizophrenia and 
treatment-resistant depression, providing ongoing treatment and potential 
well-being enhancement by managing agitation and other symptoms.

Protein quality control systems in neurodegeneration - culprits, mitigators, and 
solutions?

A key hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) is the formation of 
neurotoxic protein aggregates, which are considered to reflect inadequate 
protein quality control (PQC). In agreement with this fundamental 
pathophysiologic characteristic, the two main cellular systems responsible for 
cellular protein removal - the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy - 
have been extensively studied in the context of NDD. The involvement of these 
proteolytic machineries was interpreted in different ways - some pointed them as 
dysfunctional systems that may underlie pathogenesis, while others suggested 
they fulfill protective roles which delay the clinical presentation of these 
diseases. Perhaps not surprisingly, the growing body of knowledge concerning the 
different types of NDD portrays a more complex picture, and no distinct 
generalization can be made regarding the contribution of either the neurotoxic 
protein substrate(s) or proteolytic system(s) to the development of NDD. For 
instance, in Parkinson's disease, the toxic aggregation of α-synuclein, 
Parkinson's canonical culprit protein, can stem from seemingly unrelated events. 
Among them, alterations in α-synuclein itself, a mutation in Parkin - an E3 
ubiquitin ligase targeting proteins and organelles to proteasomal and lysosomal 
degradation, respectively, as well as a mutation in LRRK2 - a kinase postulated 
to be linked with α-synuclein through their common removal by chaperone-mediated 
autophagy. Also, in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar 
degeneration (FTLD), the toxic aggregation of one protein - TDP-43 - can result 
from defects in other proteins, some of which are related to proteostasis, such 
as the shuttle protein Optineurin and the E3 ubiquitin ligase VCP. In contrast, 
ALS and FTLD demonstrate how common abnormalities leading to neurotoxic 
aggregate formation, may present clinically in profoundly different ways, from 
motor dysfunction to behavioral changes. In Alzheimer's Disease, the leading 
cause for dementia, rare cases were linked directly with PQC as they are caused 
by a mutation in one of the genes encoding ubiquitin itself, while the majority 
of cases were not directly linked to components of the two main proteolytic 
systems. All-in-all, the UPS and autophagy are heavily intertwined with NDD, 
either as part of the problem or as mitigating factors, and hopefully - as 
platforms for future therapeutics. In this review, we shall dissect NDDs from 
the perspective of protein turnover pathways, aiming to track both common and 
unique patterns of PQC failure in this group of diseases, which differ 
significantly from one another both in their clinical manifestations and 
affected anatomic regions, yet share the common trait of abnormal protein 
accumulation. We shall review some of the mechanistic understandings concerning 
protein aggregation in NDDs, describing the interactions of aggregated proteins 
with the UPS and autophagy, discuss recent controversies around the protein 
aggregates' hypothesis, and point to implications for developing therapeutic 
strategies.

The importance of neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) has attracted 
increasing attention, and the functions of the STAT1 signaling pathway have also 
generated widespread interest. However, the role of STAT1 in AD-related 
neuroinflammation and memory impairment is unclear. Therefore, this study was 
undertaken to elucidate the roles of the STAT1 signaling pathway in the brain 
tissue of AD patients and mouse of an AD model. Our results revealed that STAT1 
phosphorylation was largely colocalized with the neuronal marker NeuN. Compared 
with that in control (non-AD) brain tissues, STAT1 phosphorylation was 
significantly upregulated in the brain cortex and hippocampus of both AD 
patients and FAD mice. Intraventricular injection of creatine (STAT1 signaling 
inhibitor) significantly reduced the level of neuronal STAT1 phosphorylation in 
the brain cortex and markedly alleviated cognitive impairment in FAD mice. 
Furthermore, intraventricular creatine treatment also reduced the number of Aβ 
plaques and the level of IBA1 expression in IBA1-positive microglia in FAD mice. 
These findings indicate that STAT1 phosphorylation may play an important role in 
AD-related neuroinflammation and memory impairment. The alleviation effects of 
intraventricular creatine in FAD mice may suggest that STAT1 is a potential 
therapeutic target for the treatment of AD in humans.

INTRODUCTION: An essential component of the endocannabinoid system, cannabinoid 
receptor type 1 (CB1) is primarily expressed in the central nervous system, 
where it regulates several neurophysiological activities. Neurotransmitter 
release, synaptic plasticity, mood modulation, and cognitive processes are all 
influenced by CB1 receptors. The CB1 receptor is closely linked to a wide range 
of brain-related disorders, and regulating its activity may be a way to treat 
several brain-related diseases.
METHODS: Literature search across Google Scholar, Scopus, PubMed, and Web of 
Science, covering publications from 1985 to 2025, aimed to gather extensive 
information on the pharmacological role of the CB1 receptor in various brain 
illnesses. Using keywords such as "CB1," "Brain," "Epilepsy," "Alzheimer's," 
"Parkinson's disease," "Neuroprotection," and "Neurodegeneration," this review 
consolidates existing knowledge and identifies potential avenues for future 
research.
RESULTS: This study incorporates pre-clinical evidence and highlights the 
involvement of the CB1 receptor in etiologies, symptoms, and treatments related 
to distinct brain-related disorders.
DISCUSSIONS: Potential treatment strategies that target the endocannabinoid 
system and the intricate relationship between CB1 receptor activity and its 
consequences in several brain disorders, including Parkinson's disease, 
Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, depression, anxiety, etc., have been 
discussed. Additionally, the difficulties and disputes related to CB1 receptor 
modulation, including the contradictory actions of CB1 receptor agonists and 
antagonists, are also addressed.
CONCLUSION: The CB1 receptor is a promising therapeutic target for brain 
disorders due to its key role in regulating various physiological functions in 
the CNS, suggesting potential for the treatment of several brain disorders.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurological ailment characterized by the 
degeneration of neurons in specific areas of the brain, resulting in memory 
loss, cognitive decline, and eventually dementia. AD is both lethal and 
currently incurable since the demise of brain cells cannot be reversed or 
stopped; however, ongoing advancements and research offer hope, aiming to 
uncover effective clinical and therapeutic strategies that could slow down the 
progression and improve patient outcomes. Surveys indicate that the treatment of 
AD is significantly expensive, with the global annual cost of treating AD 
amounting to US$1 trillion. Therefore, the early identification of this 
condition is of the utmost importance, as it can assist in slowing down the 
advancement of Alzheimer's and enable proper diagnosis. Biosensors are 
analytical instruments utilized for the early identification of AD and are in 
great demand due to their exceptional selectivity, sensitivity, and 
affordability. Biosensors integrated with transition-metal dichalcogenides 
(TMDCs) enhance the efficiency of a biosensor by significantly amplifying 
biosensing signals. This study examines AD and its underlying biochemical 
mechanisms, explicitly focusing on several hypotheses linked to AD, the 
biomarkers involved, and the use of TMDC-based biosensors for early detection of 
the illness with greater precision.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The objectives for amyloid brain PET/CT and PET/MRI 
fusion images are to determine the agreement between visual interpretations of 
amyloid PET and to compare the results of visual interpretation with 
quantitative analysis as measured by the Centiloid (CL) scale.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred sixty-seven clinical amyloid brain PET/CT 
scans were reviewed by 3 readers blinded to the original reports. Readers 
interpreted the amyloid PET scans as negative (0), positive (1), or 
indeterminate (2) for amyloid deposition. For quantitative analysis, 2 
additional readers analyzed amyloid PET images using MIMNeuro to generate CL 
scores and regional standardized uptake ratios. Reader agreement was determined 
for visual and quantitative assessment. Using positive scan cutoffs of CL ≥ 40, 
we determined visual assessment-versus-quantitative assessment for scans 
consistently interpreted as positive by all 3 readers and for each reader.
RESULTS: Fifty-three scans (31.74%) were rated amyloid-positive by all readers, 
while 62 scans (37.13%) were rated as amyloid-negative by all readers. The 
remaining 52 scans had inconsistent ratings with an agreement rate of 69.46%. 
Most (99/167; 59.28%) scans had CL scores above the CL-positive cutoff (CL ≥ 
40), and 47/167 (28.14%) were CL-negative scans (CL <10). The lowest CL score to 
achieve visual positivity among all 3 readers was 57, while the lowest CL score 
to receive at least 1 indeterminate score was 11. The readers had a high degree 
of interreader reliability when rating scans as either positive (κ = 0.62) or 
negative (κ = 0.66) but were inconsistent when rating scans as indeterminate (κ 
= 0.17). Optimal cut-points were CL <3.6 for consistent negative and CL ≥28.8 
for consistent visual positivity.
CONCLUSIONS: Given the emergence of antiamyloid monoclonal therapies for 
early-stage Alzheimer disease, reliable detection of amyloidosis is critical for 
patient care. This study suggests that visual reads of amyloid PET may be 
insensitive when amyloidosis is milder but are spread across multiple regions 
(CL ranging from 40 to 59). Quantification of amyloid PET using the CL scale may 
help guide treatment of patients with mild amyloidosis who are under 
consideration for antiamyloid disease-modifying therapeutics.

In our previous study, we systematically compared various extraction methods and 
identified the 80% ethanolic extract of Curcuma longa L. (CL-80) as the most 
effective in protecting neurons from stress-induced damage in both in vitro and 
in vivo models. Although curcumin, a major constituent of C. longa, has 
demonstrated neuroprotective effects, the role of ar-turmerone, a bioactive 
sesquiterpenoid also derived from C. longa, remains underexplored in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) models. In this study, we evaluated the anti-inflammatory and 
cognitive-protective effects of CL-80 and ar-turmerone in both in vitro and in 
vivo models of amyloid-β (Aβ)-induced neurotoxicity. Primary cultured rat 
hippocampal neurons exposed to Aβ25-35 showed significantly increased expression 
of TNF-α, IFN-β, and iNOS, all of which were dose-dependently attenuated by 
CL-80 or ar-turmerone. Furthermore, both compounds suppressed Aβ-induced 
activation of the TLR4/NF-κB signaling axis at mRNA and protein levels. In an 
Aβ1-42-injected mouse model, oral administration of CL-80 or ar-turmerone 
significantly improved learning and memory performance in the Morris water maze 
and passive avoidance tests. Biochemical analyses of hippocampal tissues 
revealed reduced TLR4 expression and NF-κB activation, decreased 
acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, and restoration of acetylcholine (ACh) 
levels following treatment. Collectively, these findings suggest that both CL-80 
and ar-turmerone exert neuroprotective effects by inhibiting TLR4/NF-κB-mediated 
neuroinflammation and preserving cholinergic function in an AD animal model. 
This study offers novel insight into the therapeutic potential of C. longa 
constituents for the treatment of AD.
