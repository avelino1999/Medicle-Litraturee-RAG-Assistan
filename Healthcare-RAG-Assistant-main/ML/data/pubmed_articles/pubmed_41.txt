BackgroundLecanemab, a monoclonal antibody targeting amyloid-β plaques, is 
FDA-approved for early Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment. However, safety data 
from daily clinical practice is limited.ObjectiveThis study aims to assess the 
adverse events (AEs) linked to lecanemab using the FDA Adverse Event Reporting 
System (FAERS) to inform better safety management.MethodsA retrospective 
pharmacovigilance study was conducted using FAERS data from Q1 2023 to Q2 2024. 
Disproportionality analysis, including reporting odds ratio (ROR), proportional 
reporting ratio (PRR), Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN), 
and multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS), was applied to evaluate AEs where 
lecanemab was the primary suspect drug.ResultsFrom Q1 2023 to Q2 2024, 917 AEs 
related to lecanemab were recorded in the FAERS database, with 67.2% of patients 
aged between 65 and 85 years and 54.5% involving women. Disproportionality 
analysis identified significant AEs across 22 organ systems, particularly 
nervous system and psychiatric disorders. Common AEs included headache, 
amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, and infusion-related reactions, while 
sleep-related issues like somnolence, abnormal dreams, and poor-quality sleep 
were notable. Median onset time was 48 days, with serious outcomes in 14.3% of 
cases, including 70 hospitalizations and 15 deaths.ConclusionsThis 
pharmacovigilance analysis confirms known AEs of lecanemab and highlights new 
safety concerns, particularly its impact on sleep. These findings underscore the 
importance of ongoing monitoring and research to enhance lecanemab's safety 
profile in AD treatment. However, due to the limitations of FAERS, our analysis 
is imperfect in terms of important AEs such as therapy-related brain loss and 
death.

BackgroundAlzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by cortical atrophy, 
glutamatergic neuron loss, and cognitive decline. However, large-scale 
quantitative assessments of cellular changes during AD pathology remain 
scarce.ObjectiveThis study aims to integrate single-nuclei sequencing data from 
the Seattle Alzheimer's Disease Cortical Atlas (SEA-AD) with spatial 
transcriptomics to quantify cellular changes in the prefrontal cortex and 
temporal gyrus, regions vulnerable to AD neuropathological changes 
(ADNC).MethodsWe mapped differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and analyzed their 
interactions with pathological factors such as APOE expression and Lewy bodies. 
Cellular proportions were assessed, focusing on neurons, glial cells, and immune 
cells.ResultsRORB-expressing L4-like neurons, though vulnerable to ADNC, 
exhibited stable cell numbers throughout disease progression. In contrast, 
astrocytes displayed increased reactivity, with upregulated cytokine signaling 
and oxidative stress responses, suggesting a role in neuroinflammation. A 
reduction in synaptic maintenance pathways indicated a decline in astrocytic 
support functions. Microglia showed heightened immune surveillance and 
phagocytic activity, indicating their role in maintaining cortical 
homeostasis.ConclusionsThe study underscores the critical roles of glial cells, 
particularly astrocytes and microglia, in AD progression. These findings 
contribute to a better understanding of cellular dynamics and may inform 
therapeutic strategies targeting glial cell function in AD.

BackgroundStudies suggest that plasma Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers may 
aid in the overall diagnosis of AD, but their utility among patients with 
atypical clinical presentations of AD are unknown.ObjectiveThe main objective of 
this study was to determine the relationship between amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau 
plasma biomarkers and PET measures of both Aβ and tau in atypical AD. The 
secondary objective was to determine if plasma biomarkers could differentiate 
patients with different atypical AD phenotypes and whether they were related to 
measures of disease severity.MethodsWe assessed whether plasma p-tau 181 and 
Aβ42/40 were associated with Aβ and tau PET uptake, clinical phenotype and 
severity in 77 patients with PET biomarker-confirmed atypical AD.ResultsPlasma 
Aβ42/40 ratio showed positive associations with tau PET uptake, with higher 
(more normal) Aβ42/40 ratio associated with higher tau uptake; the ratio was not 
associated with Aβ PET. No associations were noted with plasma p-tau 181. Plasma 
Aβ42/40 ratio and p-tau 181 concentrations were not associated with AD phenotype 
or cognitive severity.ConclusionPlasma Aβ42/40 ratio and p-tau 181 
concentrations are not associated with amyloid or tau PET or with clinical 
severity among individuals presenting with atypical AD.

Neurodegenerative diseases display synaptic deficits, mitochondrial defects, and 
protein aggregation. We show that intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) 
regulates axoplasmic viscosity and protein aggregation in mammalian neurons. 
Decreased intracellular ATP upon mitochondrial inhibition leads to axoterminal 
cytosol, synaptic vesicles, and active zone component condensation, modulating 
the functional organization of mouse glutamatergic synapses. Proteins involved 
in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) condensed and underwent ATP-dependent liquid 
phase separation in vitro. Human inducible pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons 
from patients with PD and ALS displayed reduced axoplasmic fluidity and 
decreased intracellular ATP. Last, nicotinamide mononucleotide treatment 
successfully rescued intracellular ATP levels and axoplasmic viscosity in 
neurons from patients with PD and ALS and reduced TAR DNA-binding protein 43 
(TDP-43) aggregation in human motor neurons derived from a patient with ALS. 
Thus, our data suggest that the hydrotropic activity of ATP contributes to the 
regulation of neuronal homeostasis under both physiological and pathological 
conditions.

Neurodegenerative diseases are age-related disorders characterized by the 
cerebral accumulation of amyloidogenic proteins, and cellular senescence 
underlies their pathogenesis. Thus, it is necessary for preventing these 
diseases to remove toxic proteins, repair damaged neurons, and suppress cellular 
senescence. As a source for such prophylactic agents, we selected zizyphi 
spinosi semen (ZSS), a medicinal herb used in traditional Chinese medicine. Oral 
administration of ZSS hot water extract ameliorated Aβ and tau pathology and 
cognitive impairment in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal 
dementia. Non-extracted ZSS simple crush powder showed stronger effects than the 
extract and improved α-synuclein pathology and cognitive/motor function in 
Parkinson's disease model mice. Furthermore, when administered to normal aged 
mice, the ZSS powder suppressed cellular senescence, reduced DNA oxidation, 
promoted brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression and neurogenesis, and 
enhanced cognition to levels similar to those in young mice. The quantity of 
known active ingredients of ZSS, jujuboside A, jujuboside B, and spinosin was 
not proportional to the nootropic activity of ZSS. These results suggest that 
ZSS simple crush powder is a promising dietary material for the prevention of 
neurodegenerative diseases and brain aging.

ObjectiveTo analyse the benefits of virtual reality in the management of balance 
and gait disorders in people with Alzheimer's disease and cognitive 
impairment.Data sourcesPubMed, PEDro, Cochrane Library, Science Direct, Google 
Scholar and Epistemonikos.Review methodThis study is a systematic review 
(PROSPERO Registration number: CRD42023486083). The inclusion criteria were: 
randomised, cross-sectional, quasi-experimental controlled clinical trials 
involving patients diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, dementia and 
Alzheimer's disease with a score of ≤23 on the MMSE test and age ≥60 years, and 
interventions conducted with virtual reality and conventional physiotherapy for 
the treatment of balance and gait disorders. The methodological quality and risk 
of bias assessment was performed with the PEDro scale.Results12 studies were 
included in the review (n = 476). Three studies applied virtual reality to both 
experimental and control groups, six applied virtual reality to the experimental 
group and conventional physiotherapy to the control, and three investigations 
applied virtual reality to the experimental group and no treatment to the 
control group. Virtual reality based rehabilitation significantly improved 
balance and gait, as well as cognitive level, functionality, postural control 
and mood of the patients compared to those participants who received 
conventional physiotherapy or no treatment.ConclusionStudies suggest that 
interventions based on virtual environments in older adults with early 
Alzheimer's disease can improve balance and gait impairments, postural control 
and executive function, delaying the deterioration caused by the disease. 
Furthermore, this therapy has a positive impact on cognitive and motivational 
performance in these patients.

PURPOSE: These guidelines aim to support magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
diagnosis in patients receiving anti-amyloid β (Aβ) antibody treatment without 
restricting treatment eligibility.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: These guidelines were collaboratively established by 
Japan Radiological Society, The Japanese Society of Neuroradiology, and Japanese 
Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine by reviewing existing literature and 
the results of clinical trials.
RESULTS: Facility standards should comply with the "Optimal Use Promotion 
Guidelines" of Japan, and physicians should possess comprehensive knowledge of 
amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) and expertise in brain MRI 
interpretation. The acquisition of knowledge regarding amyloid-related imaging 
abnormalities, brain MRI, anti-Aβ antibody introduction, and post-treatment 
diagnosis are also recommended.
CONCLUSION: These guidelines facilitate the accurate diagnosis and effective 
management of ARIA; ensure the safe administration of anti-Aβ drugs; and provide 
a framework for MRI facilities, includes staffing requirements and the use of 
MRI management systems.

Due to progressive cognitive loss and subsequent incapability of daily life, the 
development of novel therapeutics is urgently needed for dementia patients. We 
performed a two-sample bi-directional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis 
using summary-level statistics to identify causality between peripheral and 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins and the risk of dementia. Genetic variants 
were subtracted from the Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) results. Wald 
ratio (WR) and inverse-variance weighted (IVW) ratio were utilized to estimate 
the causal effects of plasma and CSF proteins on dementia. Reverse MR, Steiger 
filtering, Bayesian co-localization phenotype scanning, and external validation 
were integrated to strengthen the robustness of primary MR results. After 
sensitivity analysis, six circulating proteins were identified in three dementia 
classifications, whereas no causality was found in frontotemporal dementia 
(FTD). Elevated levels of circulating C1R protein increased the odds of 
developing Alzheimer's disease (AD), while PILRA and CELA2A were estimated to 
protect against the pathogenesis of AD; genetically predicted increase of 
α-synuclein and APOE elevated the occurrence of Dementia of Lewy Bodies (DLB); 
elevated level of circulating CRP was assessed to increase the onset of vascular 
dementia (VD). Our MR analyses identified a genetically predicted association 
between circulating C1R, PILRA, and CELA2A and the risk of AD, causal estimates 
between α-syn, APOE protein, and the onset of DLB, and a robust correlation 
between CRP and the etiology of VD. This study might guide the discovery of 
disease etiology and build up a novel disease-modifying paradigm of dementia.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition 
characterised by cognitive decline and memory impairment. Recent research 
highlights the important role of hypoxia, a state of insufficient oxygen 
availability, in exacerbating AD pathogenesis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Through the use of a number of different search engines 
like Scopus, PubMed, Bentham, and Elsevier databases, a literature review was 
carried out for investigating the role of hypoxia mediated pathobiology in AD. 
Only peerreviewed articles published in reputable journals in English language 
were included. Conversely, non-peer-reviewed articles, conference abstracts, and 
editorials were excluded, along with studies lacking experimental or clinical 
relevance or those unavailable in full text.
CONCLUSION: Hypoxia exacerbates core pathological features such as oxidative 
stress, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, amyloid-beta (Aβ) 
dysregulation, and hyperphosphorylation of tau protein. These interlinked 
mechanisms establish a self-perpetuating cycle of neuronal damage, accelerating 
disease progression. Addressing hypoxia as a modifiable risk factor offers 
potential for both prevention and treatment of AD. Exploring hypoxia and the HIF 
signalling pathway may help counteract the neuropathological and symptomatic 
effects of neurodegeneration.

The present study aimed to assess the pharmacological mechanism of Salvia 
officinalis in Neurodegenerative disorders using a network pharmacology approach 
followed by molecular docking analysis. Phytoconstituents of S.officinalis were 
obtained from various databases, followed by the screening of active ingredients 
using the Swiss ADME web tool. Potential targets of active ingredients were 
identified using PubChem & SwissTargetPrediction. Genes related to Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD) were 
gathered using online databases. Besides, the correlation between active 
ingredient targets and disease-associated genes was linked. Networks were 
constructed, visualized, and analyzed using Cytoscape. Gene Ontology (GO) and 
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis were 
performed using DAVID database. Decisively, Autodock was used for molecular 
docking. The results of network analysis identified 9 key active ingredients 
based on topological analysis of the active ingredient-candidate targets 
network. Also, the analysis revealed a shared target of 9 key active ingredients 
of S. officinalis that interacted with 133 AD-related targets whereas only 6 
active ingredients interacted with 85 and 58 targets of PD and HD respectively. 
The core genes from the network were AKT1, BACE1, CASP3, MAPK1, TNF, and IL6. 
Furthermore, GO and KEGG enrichment analysis showed that FOXO, TNF, MAPK, 
PI3K-Akt, Rap 1, and neurotrophin signalling pathways as enriched, which were 
further evaluated by molecular docking suggesting the protective role of S. 
officinalis in neurodegenerative diseases. Our research reveals the therapeutic 
benefits of S. officinalis, which might play a crucial role in modulating 
neurodegenerative diseases.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to investigate pain network and 
periaqueductal gray matter (PAG) functional connectivity (FC) in participants 
with acute post-traumatic headache (PTH) due to mild traumatic brain injury 
(mTBI) compared to healthy controls (HC).
METHODS: Ninety-eight participants with acute PTH and 85 HC underwent 3 T 
magnetic resonance imaging. Static FC among regions of the pain matrix and 
between PAG to the rest of the brain were examined. Correlations between FC and 
clinical parameters were investigated using linear regression. PTH outcomes 
(improved or not improved) were determined at 3 months post-enrollment.
RESULTS: Stronger FC between the PAG and right somatosensory and left lingual 
areas, and weaker FC between left thalamus and left caudate were found in the 
PTH group compared to HC. Whole-brain analysis showed increased PAG FC, 
primarily with somatosensory, motor, and occipital areas of participants with 
PTH relative to HC. These differences had associations with headache frequency, 
state anxiety, and time since mTBI. A PAG FC model for PTH improvement at 
3 months had a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 100%. Participants with 
PTH who did not improve at 3 months had stronger baseline FC from the PAG to the 
right temporal region and the left insula relative to the improved group or to 
HC.
CONCLUSION: PAG FC could serve as an early biomarker identifying participants 
with acute PTH at risk of developing persistent PTH.

Cell-derived, nanoscale extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as promising 
tools in diagnostic, therapeutic, and vaccine applications. Their unique 
properties including the capability to encapsulate diverse molecular cargo as 
well as the versatility in surface functionalization make them ideal candidates 
for safe and effective vehicles to deliver a range of biomolecules including 
gene editing cassettes, therapeutic proteins, glycans, and glycoconjugate 
vaccines. In this review, we discuss recent advances in the development of EVs 
derived from mammalian and bacterial cells for use in a delivery of 
carbohydrate-based protein therapeutics and vaccines. We highlight key 
innovations in EVs' molecular design, characterization, and deployment for 
treating diseases including Alzheimer's disease, infectious diseases, and 
cancers. We discuss challenges for their clinical translation and provide 
perspectives for future development of EVs within biopharmaceutical research and 
the clinical translation landscape.

INTRODUCTION: White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are strongly linked to 
cardiovascular risk factors and other health conditions such as Alzheimer's 
disease. However, there is a dearth of research on this topic in low-income 
countries and underserved populations, especially in the Democratic Republic of 
Congo (DRC) where the population is aging rapidly with increasing cardiovascular 
risk factors and dementia-related diseases. This study evaluates health factors 
associated with WMH in the elderly Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), specifically 
Congolese adults.
METHODS: In a cross-sectional study of 77 people from the DRC, participants 
underwent neuroimaging to analyze WMHs volume and completed clinical evaluation, 
laboratory-based blood exams, self-reported questionnaires, and interviews. A 
simple linear regression model was conducted to test the association between 
WMHs and potential predictors (dementia, age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, 
tobacco abuse, stroke, high cholesterol, cardiovascular medication, and alcohol 
abuse). Stepwise selection and backward elimination analyses were performed to 
obtain the final model. Finally, a multiple linear regression model was 
conducted to assess the association between WMHs and variables retained in the 
final model (dementia, sex, and age).
RESULTS: Of the 77 individuals, 47 (61%) had dementia, 40 (52.6%) were males, 
and the mean age was 73 years (± 8.0 years standard deviation). In simple linear 
regression models, WMHs was significantly associated with dementia 
(expβ1 = 1.75, 95% CI = 1.14-2.71, p-value = 0.01) though it had a weak 
association with age (expβ1 = 1.03, 95% CI = 1.00-1.05, p-value = 0.05) and sex 
(male) (expβ1 = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.43-1.01, p-value = 0.05). In multiple linear 
regression models, WMHs was statistically significantly associated with dementia 
(expβ1 = 1.97, 95% CI = 1.31-2.95, p-value =0.001), male sex (expβ2 = 0.54, 95% 
CI = 0.36-0.80, p-value = 0.003), and age (expβ3 = 1.03, 95% CI = 1.00-1.06, 
p-value = 0.03). However, WMHs was not significantly associated with common 
cardiovascular risk factors, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, tobacco use, 
obesity, and high cholesterol levels.
DISCUSSION: WMHs is significantly associated with dementia, sex, and age in the 
Congolese population. Understanding these predictors may improve our ability to 
diagnose, assess, and develop preventative treatments for white matter disease 
in SSA/DRC populations, where neuroimaging is difficult to obtain.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prominent neurodegenerative ailment 
characterized by the constraints of conventional therapies stemming from 
insufficient medication transport to the brain. This review examines the 
function of polymeric nanocarriers (PNCs) in improving therapeutic efficacy for 
Alzheimer's disease treatment.
METHODS: We analyze the principal obstacles to Alzheimer's disease drug 
delivery: the blood-brain barrier, the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier, and 
multidrug resistance proteins. The review examines three categories of PNCs: 
polymeric nanoparticles, polymeric micelles, and dendrimers, and their capacity 
to surmount these obstacles. Literature investigations used search engines like 
Pub- Med, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect.
RESULTS: PNCs exhibit superior drug delivery via better biocompatibility, 
regulated release, and targeted delivery mechanisms. Recent studies demonstrate 
the effective delivery of several pharmaceuticals, including rivastigmine and 
galantamine, resulting in enhanced cognitive outcomes in Alzheimer's disease 
models. Patent research indicates an increase in innovation for PNC-based 
Alzheimer's disease treatments.
CONCLUSION: Despite ongoing hurdles in biocompatibility and scalability, PNCs 
exhibit significant potential to transform Alzheimer's disease treatment by 
improving medication delivery across biological barriers. Current investigations 
in nanotechnology and combinatorial medicines indicate a favorable outlook for 
PNC-based medicinal strategies.

The Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB), a dynamic and highly selective interface, 
regulates the exchange of molecules between the circulatory system and the 
Central Nervous System (CNS). While it protects the brain from toxins and 
pathogens, it also restricts the delivery of therapeutic agents, posing a 
significant challenge in treating CNS disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, 
Parkinson's disease, and glioblastoma. This manuscript explores the structural 
and functional complexity of the BBB, including the roles of tight junctions, 
adherens junctions, astrocytes, pericytes, and endothelial cells. It highlights 
the influence of drug physicochemical properties, such as lipophilicity, 
molecular weight, and hydrogen bonding, on BBB penetration. Current strategies 
to enhance drug delivery include nanotechnology-based carriers (liposomes, solid 
lipid nanoparticles, polymer-based carriers), receptor-mediated transcytosis, 
and cell-penetrating peptides. Emerging approaches like focused ultrasound with 
microbubbles, intranasal delivery, and exosome-mediated transport demonstrate 
significant potential for bypassing BBB constraints. Gene therapy, employing 
both viral and nonviral vectors, offers promise for addressing genetic CNS 
disorders. Despite advances, limitations, such as offtarget effects, limited 
delivery efficiency, and potential toxicity, remain critical barriers to 
clinical translation. Future research must prioritize multidisciplinary 
approaches integrating nanotechnology, personalized medicine, and enhanced 
understanding of BBB biology. Innovations in non-invasive, targeted delivery 
systems are essential to overcoming existing challenges and enabling effective 
treatment of CNS disorders. This review underscores the need for further 
exploration of these technologies to achieve sustained, site-specific drug 
delivery, thereby advancing therapeutic interventions for neurological diseases. 
The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a critical interface that protects the brain 
but limits drug delivery, posing challenges in treating CNS disorders. Advancing 
multidisciplinary approaches and innovative delivery systems is essential to 
overcome these limitations and enable effective therapies for neurological 
diseases.

Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is the enzyme targeted by drugs used for the 
symptomatic treatment of cognitive decline associated with Alzheimer's disease. 
While in vitro data suggest the AChE inhibitory potential of A. fruticosa 
extracts and components such as rotenoids, in-depth mechanistic investigations 
are missing. A wide array of computational techniques, including ligand-based 
approaches, molecular docking, molecular dynamics, and machine learning-assisted 
toxicity prediction were enrolled in the current study, highlighting the 
rotenoid 6α,12α-dehydrodeguelin as a promising lead for the development of AChE 
inhibitors.

Cognitive resilience (CR) contributes to the variability in risk for developing 
and progressing in Alzheimer's disease (AD) among individuals. Beyond genetics, 
recent studies highlight the critical role of lifestyle factors in enhancing CR 
and delaying cognitive decline. DNA methylation (DNAm), an epigenetic mechanism 
influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, including CR-related 
lifestyle factors, offers a promising pathway for understanding the biology of 
CR. We studied DNAm changes associated with the Resilience Index (RI), a 
composite measure of lifestyle factors, using blood samples from the Healthy 
Brain Initiative (HBI) cohort. After corrections for multiple comparisons, our 
analysis identified 19 CpGs and 24 differentially methylated regions 
significantly associated with the RI, adjusting for covariates age, sex, APOE 
ε4, and immune cell composition. The RI-associated methylation changes are 
significantly enriched in pathways related to lipid metabolism, synaptic 
plasticity, and neuroinflammation, and highlight the connection between 
cardiovascular health and cognitive function. By identifying RI-associated DNAm, 
our study provided an alternative approach to discovering future targets and 
treatment strategies for AD, complementary to the traditional approach of 
identifying disease-associated variants directly. Furthermore, we developed a 
Methylation-based Resilience Score (MRS) that successfully predicted future 
cognitive decline in an external dataset from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), even after accounting for age, sex, APOE ε4, 
years of education, baseline diagnosis, and baseline MMSE score. Our findings 
are particularly relevant for a better understanding of epigenetic architecture 
underlying cognitive resilience. Importantly, the significant association 
between baseline MRS and future cognitive decline demonstrated that DNAm could 
be a predictive marker for AD, laying the foundation for future studies on 
personalized AD prevention.

    Res Sq. 2025 Feb 24:rs.3.rs-6038641. doi: 10.21203/rs.3.rs-6038641/v1.

BACKGROUND: The epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are derivatives of the 
arachidonic acid metabolism with anti-inflammatory activities. However, their 
efficacy is limited due to the rapid hydrolysis by soluble epoxide hydrolase 
(sEH). Inhibition of sEH has been shown to stabilize the EETs and reduce 
neuroinflammation in Aβ mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the 
role of the sEH-EET signaling pathway in other CNS cell types and 
neurodegenerative conditions are less understood.
METHODS: Here we investigated the mechanisms and functional role of the sEH-EET 
axis in tauopathy by treating PS19 mice with a small molecule sEH inhibitor TPPU 
and by crossing the PS19 mice with Ephx2 (gene encoding sEH) knockout mice. This 
was followed by single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq), biochemical and 
immunohistochemical analysis, and behavioral assessments. Additionally, we 
examined the effects of the sEH-EET pathway in primary microglia cultures and 
human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons exhibiting 
seeding-induced Tau inclusions.
RESULTS: sEH inhibition improved cognitive function, rescued neuronal cell loss, 
and reduced Tau pathology and microglial reactivity. snRNA-seq revealed that 
TPPU treatment upregulated genes involved in actin cytoskeleton and excitatory 
synaptic pathways. Treatment of human iPSC-derived neurons with TPPU enhanced 
synaptic density without affecting Tau accumulation, suggesting a 
cell-autonomous neuroprotective effect of sEH blockade. Furthermore, sEH 
inhibition reversed disease-associated and interferon-responsive microglial 
states in PS19 mice, while EET supplementation promoted Tau phagocytosis and 
clearance in primary microglia cultures.
CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that sEH blockade or EET augmentation 
confers therapeutic benefit in neurodegenerative tauopathies by simultaneously 
targeting neuronal and microglial pathways.

Serotonin (5-HT) receptors and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) have both 
been implicated in stress-induced psychiatric disorders. However, there is a 
paucity of studies evaluating the effectiveness of novel combinatorial 
pharmacological treatments to treat stress-related disorders. Here, we evaluated 
whether administration of combinatorial (R,S)-ketamine, an NMDAR antagonist and 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved anesthetic, and prucalopride, a 5-HT 
type IV receptor (5-HT4R) agonist and FDA-approved drug for chronic idiopathic 
constipation (CIC), would have additional effects when administered after 
stress. A single injection of saline (Sal), (R,S)-ketamine (K), prucalopride 
(P), or a combined dose of (R,S)-ketamine and prucalopride (K + P) was 
administered for 1x, 2x, or 7x per week for 2 weeks after either contextual fear 
conditioning (CFC), learned helplessness (LH), stress enhanced fear learning 
(SEFL), or chronic corticosterone (CORT) stress in both sexes. Drug efficacy was 
assayed using assays to measure fear, behavioral despair, perseverative, and/or 
hyponeophagia. Combinatorial drug administration was also tested using 
intranasal delivery. We found that combinatorial K + P exerted additional 
effects, compared to either drug alone, in reducing a variety of stress-induced 
behaviors in both sexes. Moreover, intranasal dosing was also effective. Our 
results indicate that chronic administration of K + P has extended benefits for 
combating stress-induced pathophysiology. Our findings provide strong evidence 
that future clinical studies using this chronic treatment strategy may prove 
advantageous in decreasing a broad range of stress-induced psychiatric 
disorders.

Early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial for 
effective treatment. While the integration of deep learning techniques for AD 
classification is not entirely new, this study introduces CAPCBAM-a framework 
that extends prior approaches by combining Capsule Networks with a Convolutional 
Block Attention Module (CBAM). In CAPCBAM, standardized preprocessing of MRI 
images is followed by feature extraction using Capsule Networks, which preserve 
spatial hierarchies and capture intricate relationships among image features. 
The subsequent application of CBAM, employing both channel and spatial attention 
mechanisms, refines the feature maps to highlight the most clinically relevant 
regions. This dual-attention strategy offers clear advantages over conventional 
CNN methods, particularly in enhancing model generalization and mitigating 
information loss due to pooling. On the ADNI dataset, CAPCBAM achieved an 
impressive accuracy of 99.95%, with precision and recall both at 99.8%, an AUC 
of 0.99, and an F1-Score of 99.92%. Although the use of Capsule Networks and 
attention mechanisms has been explored previously, CAPCBAM distinguishes itself 
by its robust integration of these components. The study's advantages include 
improved feature extraction, faster convergence, and superior classification 
performance, making it a promising tool for the early detection of Alzheimer's 
disease.

OBJECTIVES: To observe the effect of electroacupuncture(EA) on histone 
deacetylase 3 (HDAC3), synaptic plasticity and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) 
receptors in the hippocampus of mice with Alzheimer's disease(AD), so as to 
explore the underlying mechanism of EA in treatment of AD.
METHODS: 5XFAD mice were randomly divided into EA group, model group and 
sham-acupuncture group, with 13 mice in both the EA group and the model group, 
and 7 mice in the sham-acupuncture group. Thirteen wild-type mice from the same 
litter were taken as the normal control group. The mice in the EA group received 
EA at "Baihui" (GV20)and "Dazhui" (GV14) for 15 min once daily, 6 times a week 
for 4 weeks. The mice in the sham-acupuncture group received sham EA, i.e., the 
needle was inserted into the rubber clay which was placed on the surface of the 
corresponding acupoints. The novel object recognition(NOR), Y-maze and Morris 
water maze(MWM) tests were used to observe the cognitive functions of mice. 
Electrophysiological technique was used to detect long-term potentiation (LTP) 
of the hippocampal neurons and Western blot was used to detect the relative 
expressions of HDAC3 and NMDAR-related receptors (NMDAR1, NMDAR2A, NMDAR2B) in 
the hippocampus.
RESULTS: Compared with the normal control group, 5XFAD mice in the model group 
showed decreased(P<0.01, P<0.05) preference index for new object recognition, 
alternative arm ratio (AAR), number of times crossing the original platform, 
percentage of time and distance traveled in the target quadrant, NMDAR2B, 
NMDAR2A and NMDAR1 protein expression levels, with prolonged(P<0.01) escape 
latency, and increased (P<0.05) protein relative expression of HDAC3. At the 
same time, with high-frequency stimulation, the slope of fEPSP was 
decreased(P<0.01, P<0.05)in the 5XFAD mice. After EA intervention, comparison 
between the EA and the model groups revealed that, the preference index for new 
object recognition, AAR were increased (P<0.01, P<0.05) in the EA group, the 
escape latency was shortened (P<0.05), and the number of times crossing the 
platform, percentage of time and distance traveled in the target quadrant, the 
slope of fEPSP, and the protein relative expressions of NMDAR2B, NMDAR2A and 
NMDAR1 in the hippocampus were increased (P<0.01, P<0.05), while the protein 
relative expression of HDAC3 decreased (P<0.01). Compared with sham-acupuncture 
group, the above indexes improved to different degree in the EA group (P<0.01, 
P<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: EA of GV20 and GV14 can restore the impaired LTP and improve the 
cognitive impairment, which may be related to increasing the expressions of 
NMDA-related receptor proteins and down-regulating the expression of HDAC3 in 
the hippocampus of 5XFAD mice.

The applicability of video calls in counseling people with dementia and their 
caregivers in a home setting was examined.First-time enquirers for advice in a 
Dementia Network were offered an online appointment (video call) with the 
caregiver in the presence of the person with dementia (PWD) by a psychiatrist 
and a social worker from a Geriatric Psychiatry Outpatient Clinic. 
Socio-demographic data, an assessment of current symptoms and the current burden 
on relatives were collected and subsequently evaluated by the BZ.The 24 
inquiries resulted in 9 video calls. Selected results, e. g. the caregivers 
burden and the evaluation by the users, are reported.The Caregivers seeking 
advice and, with them, the PWD use the format like a face-to-face meeting. 
Advantages include the simultaneous involvement of several family members in a 
conference call or overcoming the immobility of the PWD due to illness.

BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety coexist with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 
Parkinson's disease (PD), yet their progression trajectories vary, necessitating 
a thorough examination of prescription patterns for antidepressants and 
anti-anxiety drugs pre- and post-diagnosis.
OBJECTIVES: To systematically compare the prescriptions of antidepressant and 
anti-anxiety drugs across AD and PD over 10 years before and after initial 
diagnosis in the UK and France.
METHODS: Data on 19,954 patients with AD, 25,267 with PD from the UK, 17,463 
with AD, 10,333 with PD from France were extracted from The Health Improvement 
Network database. For both countries, we compared the odds of prescribed 
antidepressants and anti-anxiety drugs for each diagnosis group, over 10 years 
before and after diagnosis, using logistic regressions adjusting for age, sex, 
and drug prescriptions for chronic diseases.
RESULTS: Antidepressant prescriptions showed a significant rise from 25 % 
5-10 years before the initial AD diagnosis to 50 % within the first 5 years 
post-diagnosis. AD Patients were more likely to be prescribed antidepressants 
than PD patients [Odds ratios ranging from 1.02 to 1.13 in the UK and 1.09-1.36 
in France] and conversely PD patients were more likely to be prescribed 
anti-anxiety drugs [0.83-0.84 in the UK and 0.85-0.90 in France] several years 
before their diagnosis. AD patients sustained elevated antidepressant 
prescriptions up to 5 years after diagnosis.
CONCLUSION: These findings offer insights into disease-specific psychological 
impacts and underscore the necessity for further investigation into prescription 
patterns and their implications on patient outcomes.

Alzheimer's disease (ALZ) is a chronic disease that affects the brain neurons 
leading to dementia. Donepezil (DPZ), a first-line treatment for ALZ is a potent 
symptomatic therapeutic agent. However, the oral and transdermal route 
represents non-targeted delivery, causing various adverse effects. This study 
presents the successful incorporation of a DPZ-loaded lipid microsphere (DPZ-LM) 
system into a thermosensitive-mucoadhesive gel (TMG), thereby enhancing the 
delivery of DPZ through the nose-to-brain route. To optimize the formulations, 
several evaluations were conducted, resulting in an optimized formulation of LM 
using Compritol® exhibited particle size of 8.75 µm, 98.44% of DPZ entrapped, 
and 93.40% of DPZ loaded in the system with a sustained release manner in the in 
vitro studies. The TMG-DPZ-LM was prepared using Pluronic® F127 and F68, as the 
gelling agents, with the addition of sodium alginate, as the mucoadhesive 
polymer. Following incorporation into TMG-DPZ-LM, the system exhibited excellent 
physicochemical properties and effective nasal delivery in ex vivo permeation 
has found that 88.58 ± 12.53 µg/cm2 and retention studies with a mean 
concentration of 0.0077 mg of retention DPZ in porcine nasal mucosa. The in vivo 
pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that the administration of TMG-DPZ-LM via 
the nose-to-brain route resulted in a significant (p < 0.05) increase in the 
Cmax, with 207.24 ± 5.16 µg/cm3 of DPZ in the brain that exhibited a 
significantly different profile compared to the other route and formulation. The 
TMG-DPZ-LM system that was developed in this study was considered to have 
improved its efficacy in the treatment of ALZ.

This study was conducted to investigate the mechanism of the potential and 
anti-inflammatory properties of nitrogen-substituted oleanolic acid derivatives 
that can be used to treat neuroinflammatory diseases. Nitrogen-containing 
oleanolic acid derivatives have been evaluated for their anti-neuroinflammatory 
effects in vitro in neuronal and monocytic cell lines at nontoxic doses, and the 
production of cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-17), the inflammatory enzyme induced 
nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and NF-κB signalling under LPS-stimulated 
conditions, and the expression of genes associated with Alzheimer's disease have 
been assessed. In addition, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation 
assessments are conducted in silico. Key protein markers of neurodegenerative 
diseases, especially Alzheimer's disease and neuroinflammation, TAU protein 
levels, and microglial activation, as well as ionised calcium-binding adaptor 
protein-1 (IBA1) levels, were significantly reduced with the addition of 
oleanolic acid derivatives. LPS-induced NF-κB luciferase reporter activity and 
iNOS activity were significantly inhibited, approaching the levels in uninduced 
controls. The mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines critical for 
neuroinflammation, such as TNF-α, NF-κB, IL-6 and IL-17, was reduced twofold to 
sevenfold. Furthermore, the molecular docking and MD simulation analyses 
revealed potential interactions with the TNF-α and NF-κB proteins. These 
findings underscore the potential of oleanolic acid derivatives, particularly 
compound 16, as candidates for further development as therapeutic agents for 
neurodegenerative diseases associated with chronic inflammation.

BackgroundNeuroinflammation actively contributes to the pathophysiology of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the value of neuroinflammatory biomarkers for 
disease-staging or predicting disease progression remains unclear.ObjectiveTo 
investigate diagnostic and prognostic utility of inflammatory biomarkers in 
combination with conventional AD biomarkers.MethodsData from 258 participants in 
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) with cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) biomarkers of amyloid-β (Aβ), tau, and inflammation were analyzed. 
Clinically meaningful cognitive decline (CMCD) was defined as a ≥ 4-point 
increase on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive Subscore 11. 
Predictor variables included demographics (D: age, sex, education), APOE4 status 
(A), inflammatory biomarkers (I), and classic AD biomarkers of Aβ and p-tau181 
(C). Models incorporating inflammatory biomarkers assessed their contribution to 
improving baseline diagnostic classification and 1-year CMCD 
prediction.ResultsAt 1-year follow-up, 27.1% of participants experienced CMCD. 
Adding inflammatory biomarkers to models with D and A variables (DA model) 
improved classification of cognitively normal (CN) versus mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) and CN versus Dementia (p < 0.001). Similarly, inflammatory 
markers enhanced classification in models including C (DAC model), for CN versus 
MCI (p < 0.01) and CN versus Dementia (p < 0.001). Predictive performance for 
CMCD was improved in individuals with MCI and dementia in both models (all 
p < 0.05). In addition, the DAI model outperformed the DAC model in predicting 
CMCD for MCI and Dementia groups (both p < 0.05).ConclusionsAddition of CSF 
inflammatory biomarkers to biomarkers of AD improves diagnostic accuracy of 
clinical disease stage at baseline and add incremental value to AD biomarkers 
for prediction of cognitive decline.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by cognitive decline, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and 
mitochondrial dysfunction. Despite extensive research efforts, effective 
curative treatments remain elusive, emphasizing the need for innovative 
therapeutic strategies. Grounding, or earthing, involves direct physical contact 
with the Earth's surface to facilitate the absorption of negatively charged 
electrons into the body. This practice has gained attention for its potential to 
reduce inflammation, oxidative stress, and cortisol dysregulation, which are 
significant contributors to AD pathology. This review examines the biological 
mechanisms by which grounding may influence AD, including its antioxidative 
effects that mitigate oxidative stress and its anti-inflammatory properties that 
reduce neuroinflammation. Grounding may also improve sleep quality and stress 
management, factors known to exacerbate AD progression. Evidence from 
preclinical and clinical studies highlights its potential to protect neuronal 
health by targeting oxidative and inflammatory pathways. Additionally, the 
safety, feasibility, and cost-effectiveness of grounding are discussed, making 
it a practical complementary approach to existing AD therapies. While the 
preliminary evidence is promising, the review emphasizes the need for robust 
clinical trials to validate grounding's efficacy specifically in AD populations. 
By integrating grounding into standard care protocols, it may be possible to 
enhance the overall therapeutic outcomes and improve the quality of life for 
individuals with AD. Grounding represents a novel, non-pharmacological 
intervention that could complement existing treatments by addressing both the 
physiological and psychological aspects of this complex disease.

40 Hz sensory stimulation ("flicker") has emerged as a new technique to 
potentially mitigate pathology and improve cognition in mouse models of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. However, it remains unknown how 40 Hz 
flicker affects neural codes essential for memory. Accordingly, we investigate 
the effects of 40 Hz flicker on neural representations of experience in the 
hippocampus of the 5XFAD mouse model of AD by recording 1,000s of neurons during 
a goal-directed spatial navigation task. We find that an hour of daily exposure 
to 40 Hz audio-visual stimulation over 8 d leads to higher coordination between 
hippocampal subregions CA3 and CA1 during navigation. Consistent with CA3's role 
in generating sequential activity that represents future positions, 40 Hz 
flicker exposure increased prospective coding of future positions. In turn, 
prospective coding was more prominent during efficient navigation behavior. Our 
findings show how 40 Hz flicker enhances key hippocampal activity during 
behavior that is important for memory.

Presently approved Alzheimer's Disease (AD) therapeutics are designed for 
targeted removal of the AD-related toxic protein aggregate amyloid-β (Aβ) and 
have only shown moderate efficacy at slowing disease progression. Reversal of 
cognitive decline requires both removal of toxic aggregates and repair of the 
cellular systems damaged by decades of exposure to these aggregates. Adult 
hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) is one such system that is known to be affected 
early and severely in the development of AD. Moreover, preserved AHN is 
associated with cognitive resilience to AD neuropathology. Therefore, targeted 
therapies to improve or enhance neurogenesis should be considered in addition to 
the removal of toxic protein aggregates. Photobiomodulation (PBM) using 670 nm 
LED light has been shown to induce synaptic resilience to and removal of 
AD-related toxic protein aggregates. In this study, we aimed to assess the 
effect of PBM on a mouse model of advanced AD neuropathology. Transgenic 3xTg-AD 
mice (15- to 17-month old) were randomized to receive PBM or SHAM therapy for 
one month, followed by neuropathological assessments. Our results show that one 
month of PBM therapy reduces hyperphosphorylated tau burden and partially 
rescues AHN in aged 3xTg-AD mice as compared to SHAM-treated transgenic mice. 
These data support the notion that PBM has the potential to be an effective 
non-invasive therapy to help preserve AHN and reduce cognitive dysfunction in 
moderate to advanced AD.

Neurological disorders, including Down syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, and autism 
spectrum disorders, involve intricate disruptions in brain function and 
development. DYRK1A (Dual-Specificity Tyrosine Phosphorylation-Regulated Kinase 
1A) has become an essential target in these diseases because it helps neurons 
grow, differentiate, and change shape. Overexpression of DYRK1A is connected to 
problems with neurodevelopment, memory loss, and tauopathies, which makes it an 
essential target for therapy. Therefore, inhibiting the DYRK1A protein aids in 
maintaining the normal brain molecular mechanism. Herein, we have identified 
three major natural compounds, ZINC000043552589, ZINC000001562130, and 
ZINC000059779788, as potential inhibitory candidates. These compounds exhibited 
a strong binding affinity with the DYRK1A protein during virtual screening and 
molecular docking. During the virtual screening analysis, the binding scores of 
these compounds were more than -11.0 kcal/mol. Further, hydrogen and hydrophobic 
interactions strengthen their binding with the DYRK1A protein. The MD simulation 
analysis also confirmed the structural dynamic stability of the compounds. 
Moreover, the total free binding energy calculated via the MM/GBSA method was 
found to be -54.06 kcal/mol for ZINC000043552589, -39.01 kcal/mol for 
ZINC000001562130 and -50.26 kcal/mol for ZINC000059779788. These values further 
confirm the binding affinity strength of the compounds with the target protein. 
DFT analysis revealed distinct HOMO-LUMO energy gaps and orbital distributions 
across the compounds, highlighting their varied electronic characteristics and 
charge-transfer potentials. Network pharmacology analysis further highlighted 
multiple potential gene targets for the selected compounds, providing insights 
into their broader therapeutic implications. This analysis suggests these 
natural compounds may modulate additional pathways relevant to 
neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases.

BackgroundCerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a form of cerebral small vessel 
disease (SVD) associated with Alzheimer's disease, intracerebral hemorrhage, and 
cognitive decline. Despite its clinical significance, no reliable serum 
biomarker exists for early diagnosis or monitoring of disease 
progression.ObjectiveThis study hypothesizes that α1-acid glycoprotein (α1-AGP) 
and other serum biomarkers can aid CAA diagnosis and assessment using gel-based 
mass spectrometry. A comparative analysis was performed to investigate 
associations between serum biomarkers and radiological scores.MethodsSerum 
proteins from individuals with probable or possible CAA (n = 10), classified 
using the modified Boston criteria, and age-matched controls (n = 10) were 
analyzed via two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and 
matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight tandem mass 
spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS). Candidate proteins were validated using 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Outcome measures included biomarker 
diagnostic accuracy, assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve 
analysis, and correlations between α1-AGP levels and CAA-SVD scores.ResultsFour 
proteins-hemopexin, complement C3, complement C9, and α1-AGP-were significantly 
elevated, while apolipoprotein A-1 was reduced in the CAA group. ELISA confirmed 
higher α1-AGP levels in individuals with CAA (p < 0.0001). ROC analysis 
demonstrated that α1-AGP could indicate the presence of CAA with a sensitivity 
and specificity of 1.00 (95%CI: 1.000, 1.000). Additionally, α1-AGP levels 
correlated with the CAA-SVD score (R² = 0.783).Conclusionsα1-AGP may serve as a 
novel serum biomarker for CAA. Larger cohorts and external validation are 
required to substantiate these findings and determine their clinical relevance.

BackgroundSubjective cognitive decline represents an early stage of mild 
cognitive impairment, with the Cognitive Function Instrument (CFI) serving to 
subjectively evaluate the decline in daily living activities associated with 
this minor cognitive decline.ObjectiveTo examine how CFI scores change with 
apolipoprotein E ε4 (ApoE4) carriage, objective cognitive decline, and dementia 
prevention intervention. We aimed to assess CFI's usefulness in the early 
dementia risk identification.MethodsThis study involved 196 older adults with 
normal cognition in a randomized controlled intervention trial. CFI was assessed 
every six months from baseline to 18 months, using the Alzheimer's Disease 
Cooperative Study-Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (ADCS-PACC) to 
measure cognitive decline. We employed a mixed model for repeated measures to 
compare the CFI scores at 18 months in the ApoE4, ADCS-PACC, and allocation 
groups.ResultsCFI scores increased in ApoE4 carriers and decreased in the 
intervention group, with significant differences observed in the CFI score 
changes at 18 months between carriers and non-carriers and among the allocation 
groups (p = 0.002, p = 0.026, respectively). However, there was no significant 
difference in the CFI score change among ADCS-PACC groups 
(p = 0101).ConclusionsWe observed CFI scores worsening over time in individuals 
with ApoE4 and showing a tendency to deteriorate over time in those with 
objective cognitive decline. These findings suggest that the CFI may be able to 
identify high-risk individuals for dementia at an early stage. Furthermore, the 
improvement in the CFI score is considered a significant finding when 
considering future measures for subjective cognitive decline.

BackgroundDespite technological advances and earlier and more confident 
diagnoses, there is a lack of post-diagnosis support for couples navigating the 
challenges of early dementia. Clinically elevated emotional distress is common 
for both partners after diagnosis, and interferes with the health, 
relationships, and adjustment of both partners if not addressed.ObjectiveOur 
objective was to gather in-depth information on couples' preferences to inform 
the development of a proposed dyadic intervention addressing emotional distress 
early (within 6 months) after one partners' receipt of a dementia 
diagnosis.MethodsWe recruited couples after a recent dementia diagnosis (N = 16 
dyads; 32 participants) from a large academic medical center via direct provider 
referrals for 60-min virtual dyadic interviews. Data were analyzed using a 
hybrid inductive-deductive approach to thematic analysis.ResultsWe identified 
themes within 3 a-priori determined domains. For dyadic intervention format 
(domain 1), couples preferred to participate in sessions together and to have 
flexible options for telehealth and in-person participation. Preferences for 
intervention content (domain 2) included information on dementia, skills to 
reduce distress and promote resiliency, and support to communicate about the 
diagnosis and related stress. Barriers and facilitators (domain 3) included 
denial or hesitation, resource constraints, and interests in learning skills and 
connecting to others.ConclusionsWe gathered comprehensive information that could 
be used to adapt existing dyadic interventions and to tailor support to match 
couples' preferences early after dementia diagnoses. Early interventions should 
prioritize flexible delivery of information and skills to couples to support 
adaptive coping following dementia diagnoses.

Obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is a sleep-related respiratory 
disorder that poses a global threat to human health. Chronic intermittent 
hypoxia (CIH) is its main pathological feature. With the advancements in medical 
research, the study of CIH-induced neural injury has gained increasing 
attention. Studies have shown that CIH can lead to or aggravate 
neuroinflammation and apoptosis by increasing blood-brain barrier (BBB) 
permeability, promoting oxidative stress, activating glial cells, and triggering 
multiple signaling pathways, ultimately resulting in neural injury. These 
processes contribute to the development of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's 
disease, and stroke. This review aims to summarize the progress in CIH-induced 
neural injury and explore various underlying mechanisms, with the goal of 
providing new insights for the development of therapeutic interventions 
targeting CIH-related neural damage.

BackgroundDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, older adults experienced health declines 
due to isolation. Group singing is known to enhance social, emotional, and 
physical well-being, but its feasibility in virtual formats was 
unclear.ObjectiveTo assess the feasibility of virtual group singing for 
cognitively healthy (CH) adults and individuals with neurocognitive disorders 
(NcD) during the pandemic.MethodTwo teleconferencing programs were conducted for 
participants aged >55: (1) a sing-along series with 52 weekly sessions of 
familiar music and (2) a choir program with structured weekly rehearsals 
culminating in a virtual concert. Retrospective surveys assessed anxiety 
reduction, social connection, and physical well-being using Likert scales and 
participants provided open-ended responses. Quantitative data were analyzed with 
ordinal regression and probability modeling, while qualitative themes were 
explored with Fisher's exact test.ResultsParticipants reported high levels of 
satisfaction across all measures. Sing-along programs provided greater 
satisfaction, particularly through reminiscence (p = 0.003). Choir participants 
noted enhanced intellectual well-being (p = 0.017). NcD participants were less 
satisfied with social connection but showed similar overall satisfaction levels 
compared to CH participants.ConclusionsVirtual group singing was feasible during 
periods of isolation as supported by satisfaction of the participants with 
pertaining to anxiety reduction, social connection and physical well-being. 
Sing-along programs provided emotional satisfaction through reminiscence 
(connection to past), while choir programs offered intellectual stimulation 
through multiple rehearsals. These findings highlight the potential of virtual 
singing to promote stability, connection, and well-being for older adults during 
times of disruption.

The forkhead family of transcription factors of class O (FOXOs) consisting of 
four functionally related proteins, FOXO1, FOXO3, FOXO4, and FOXO6, are 
mammalian homologs of daf-16 in Caenorhabditis elegans and were previously 
identified as tumor suppressors, oxidative stress sensors, and cell survival 
modulators. Under normal physiological conditions, FOXO protein activities are 
negatively regulated by phosphorylation via the phosphoinositide 3-kinase 
(PI3K)-Akt pathway, a well-known cell survival pathway: Akt phosphorylates FOXOs 
to inactivate their transcriptional activity by relocalizing FOXOs from the 
nucleus to the cytoplasm for degradation. However, under oxidative stress or 
absent the cellular survival drive of growth factors, FOXO proteins translocate 
to the nucleus and upregulate a series of target genes, thereby promoting cell 
growth arrest and cell death and altering mitochondrial homeostasis. FOXO gene 
expression is also regulated by other transcriptional factors such as p53 or 
autoregulation by their activities and end products. Here we summarize the 
structure, posttranslational modifications, and translocation of FOXOs linking 
to their transcriptional control of cellular functions, survival, and death, 
emphasizing their role in regulating the cellular response to some acute insults 
and chronic neurological disorders. This review will conclude with a brief 
section on potential therapeutic interventions that can be used to modulate 
FOXOs' activities when treating acute and chronic neurological disorders.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by cognitive decline, memory impairment, and neuroinflammation, 
with no definitive cure currently available. The NLRP3 inflammasome, a key 
mediator of neuroinflammation, has emerged as a critical player in AD 
pathogenesis, contributing to the accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques, tau 
hyperphosphorylation, and neuronal damage. This review explores the mechanisms 
by which the NLRP3 inflammasome is activated in AD, including its interactions 
with Aβ, tau, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and pyroptosis. Additionally, it 
highlights the role of the ubiquitin system, ion channels, autophagy, and gut 
microbiota in regulating NLRP3 activation. Therapeutic strategies targeting the 
NLRP3 inflammasome, such as IL-1β inhibitors, natural compounds, and novel small 
molecules, are discussed as promising approaches to mitigate neuroinflammation 
and slow AD progression. This review underscores the potential of NLRP3 
inflammasome inhibition as a therapeutic avenue for AD.

PURPOSE: Administration routes and dosage significantly impact Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) treatment effectiveness, as compliance in older patients depends on 
interactions between concomitant treatments, complex dosages, adverse effects, 
or medication tolerance. This study aims to describe patient and caregiver 
preferences concerning treatment with rivastigmine twice-weekly transdermal 
patches from the neurologists' and geriatricians' perspectives.
METHODS: VIITAL-2S was an ecological study based on aggregated data. A total of 
250 Spanish neurologists and geriatricians answered a survey on the use, 
adherence, patient and caregiver satisfaction, and safety (skin tolerability) of 
twice-weekly rivastigmine patches.
RESULTS: Most participating physicians reported having over 11 years of 
experience in their specialty. According to their responses, patients with AD 
attending Neurology and Geriatrics were usually in mild-moderate condition, and 
a mean of 61.4% received rivastigmine. Around 60% of patients lived with a 
family member, and over 80% had a caregiver, mainly their partner/spouse or 
other relative. Of note, more than half of patients attending Neurology and 
nearly 75% of patients in Geriatrics received 4-10 medications daily. Both 
specialists recommended the transdermal formulation to patients receiving 
rivastigmine. In 33.8% and 41.0% of patients receiving daily patches, 
neurologists and geriatricians, respectively, recommended switching to 
twice-weekly patches, considering higher administration comfort and caregiver 
preferences. Physicians reported high/very high satisfaction with twice-weekly 
patches in nearly 80% of patients. Comparing twice-weekly to daily patches, they 
observed higher comfort, more caregiver satisfaction, and enhanced adherence. 
Both specialists manifested preferring twice-weekly rivastigmine patches over 
daily ones, especially to increase caregivers' comfort, for patients without 
full-week caregiver support, and in cases of poor compliance with previous 
treatments.
CONCLUSION: Neurologists and geriatricians consider the twice-weekly 
rivastigmine patch formulation beneficial for AD treatment in terms of treatment 
compliance, skin tolerability, satisfaction and comfort for patients and 
caregivers.

OBJECTIVE: To identify the levels of loneliness and the factors associated with 
the prevalence of loneliness in caregivers of patients with dementia.
METHODS: An observational cross-sectional study was conducted, including unpaid 
caregivers of patients with dementia who were receiving home care in Bogotá, 
Colombia. The prevalence of loneliness was estimated using the UCLA Loneliness 
Scale. Participants were also assessed regarding their satisfaction with 
providing care and whether they felt they received the necessary emotional 
support from family and friends. The association between loneliness and the 
patient's clinical variables, as well as the sociodemographic characteristics of 
the caregiver, was evaluated by calculating the odds ratio (OR) between the 
groups.
RESULTS: A total of 52 caregivers of patients with dementia were included. 
Severe loneliness was present in 5.77% of caregivers, while 26.92% experienced 
moderate loneliness. All caregivers reported feeling satisfied with providing 
care to their relatives, and 71% felt that their family or friends provided the 
emotional support they required. Loneliness was more common among caregivers of 
patients with total functional dependence (OR: 4.061, p= 0.0278). Conversely, 
the perception of receiving emotional support from family and friends was 
identified as a potential protective factor against loneliness (OR: 0.184, p= 
0.0104).
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of loneliness in this study is lower than that 
reported in previous studies. All caregivers reported satisfaction in providing 
care; most perceived adequate emotional support from family and friends. These 
factors could be contributing to the lower prevalence of loneliness observed.

Publisher: OBJETIVO: Identificar los niveles de soledad y los factores asociados 
en cuidadores de pacientes con demencia.
MÉTODOS: Estudio observacional de corte transversal que incluyó cuidadores no 
remunerados de pacientes con demencia en atención domiciliaria en Bogotá, 
Colombia. La prevalencia de soledad se estimó mediante la aplicación de la 
escala de soledad de la UCLA. Se evaluó si los participantes se encontraban 
satisfechos con el cuidado y si sentían que recibían el apoyo emocional que 
requerían de familiares y amigos. La asociación de la soledad con las variables 
clínicas del paciente y sociodemográficas del cuidador se evaluó calculando el 
OR entre ambos grupos.
RESULTADOS: Se incluyeron 52 cuidadores de pacientes con demencia, El 5.77% de 
cuidadores presentaron soledad severa y 26.92% moderada. Todos los cuidadores 
reportaron sentirse satisfechos al brindar cuidado a sus familiares, y 71% 
consideraba que su familia o amigos les brindaban el apoyo emocional que 
requerían. La soledad fue más frecuente en los cuidadores de pacientes con 
dependencia funcional total (OR: 4.061, p= 0.0278). Por otro lado, la percepción 
de apoyo emocional por parte de familiares y amigos se encontró como posible 
factor protector para soledad (OR: 0.184, p= 0.0104).
CONCLUSIONES: La prevalencia de soledad encontrada en este estudio es menor 
comparada con la reportada en estudios previos. Todos los cuidadores reportaron 
sentirse satisfechos al brindar cuidado y la mayoría percibía adecuado apoyo 
emocional de familiares y amigos. Estos factores podrían estar relacionados con 
menores niveles de soledad encontrados en el presente estudio.

CRISPR/Cas9 technology has revolutionized genetic and biomedical research in 
recent years. It enables editing and modulation of gene function with an 
unparalleled precision and effectiveness. Among the various applications and 
prospects of this technology, the opportunities it offers in unraveling the 
molecular underpinnings of a myriad of central nervous system diseases, 
including neurodegenerative disorders, psychiatric conditions, and developmental 
abnormalities, are unprecedented. In this review, we highlight the applications 
of CRISPR/Cas9-based therapeutics as a promising strategy for management of 
Alzheimer's disease and transformative impact of this technology on AD research. 
Further, we emphasize the role of CRISPR/Cas9 in generating accurate AD models 
for identification of novel therapeutic targets, besides the role of 
CRISPR-based therapies aimed at correcting AD-associated mutations and 
modulating the neurodegenerative processes. Furthermore, various delivery 
systems are reviewed and potential of the non-viral nanotechnology-based 
carriers for overcoming the critical limitations of effective delivery systems 
for CRISPR/Cas9 is discussed. Overall, this review highlights the promise and 
prospects of CRISPR/Cas9 technology for unraveling the intricate molecular 
processes underlying the development of AD, discusses its limitations, ethical 
concerns and several challenges including efficient delivery across the BBB, 
ensuring specificity, avoiding off-target effects. This article can be helpful 
in better understanding the applications of CRISPR/Cas9 based therapeutic 
approaches and the way forward utilizing enormous potential of this technology 
in targeted, gene-specific treatments that could change the trajectory of this 
debilitating and incurable illness.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are representative 
neurodegenerative diseases with abnormal energy metabolism and altered 
distribution and deformation of mitochondria within neurons, particularly in 
brain regions such as the hippocampus and substantia nigra. Neurons have high 
energy demands; thus, maintaining a healthy mitochondrial population is 
important for their biological function. Recently, exosomes have been reported 
to have mitochondrial regulatory potential and antineurodegenerative properties. 
This review presents the mitochondrial abnormalities in brain cells associated 
with AD and PD and the potential of exosomes to treat these diseases. 
Specifically, it recapitulates research on the molecular mechanisms whereby 
exosomes regulate mitochondrial biogenesis, fusion/fission dynamics, 
mitochondrial transport, and mitophagy. Furthermore, this review discusses 
exosome-triggered signaling pathways that regulate nuclear factor 
(erythroid-derived 2)-like 2-dependent mitochondrial antioxidation and hypoxia 
inducible factor 1α-dependent metabolic reprogramming. In summary, this review 
aims to provide a profound understanding of the regulatory effect of exosomes on 
mitochondrial function in neurons and to propose exosome-mediated mitochondrial 
regulation as a promising strategy for AD and PD.

BackgroundAs more individuals with cognitive impairment and dementia (CID) 
remain at home, greater needs arise, necessitating additional 
support.ObjectiveTo examine ethnic differences in the needs of individuals with 
CID among Mexican American (MA) and non-Hispanic White (NHW) 
participants.MethodsAdults 65 + with possible cognitive impairment (Montreal 
Cognitive Assessment score < 26), and their caregivers living in Nueces County, 
Texas, were included. We used the Camberwell Assessment of Need for the Elderly 
(CANE) tool to study the needs (accommodations, self-care, continence, physical 
health, emotional well-being, social relationships, and availability of support 
networks) and their domains of individuals with CID including environmental, 
physical, psychological and social needs. Using negative binomial and Poisson 
regressions, ethnic differences were examined within each domain.ResultsA total 
of 473 participants were included. NHW participants (N = 150) were slightly 
older (75.5 versus 72.7 years) and had higher rates of MCI and dementia (55% 
versus 47%) compared to MA participants (N = 323). All participants reported 
high levels of needs (met or unmet). Furthermore, although NHW participants 
reported having fewer social needs (met or unmet) compared to MA participants 
(Incident Rate Ratio [IRR]=-0.79; 97.5%CI:0.63-0.98), NHW participants had a 
greater level of unmet needs when it came to social needs compared to MA 
participants (IRR = 1.85; 97.5%CI:1.33-2.57).ConclusionsFindings indicate high 
levels of needs among individuals with CID. There also exist ethnic differences, 
with NHW participants having greater unmet needs in social areas. Enhancing 
access to resources and support systems is essential for equitable support for 
individuals with CID across various ethnic backgrounds.

Throughout humanity's existence, dance and creative movement have been used to 
express concepts, attitudes, and emotions, as well as to develop skills. Dance 
offers a paradigm to investigate neuroplasticity associated with learning 
sensorimotor interactions, and how these interactions enhance health, 
psychosocial, cognitive, and motor function, including for older individuals 
with neurotrauma and neurodegenerative disease. This collection explores the 
science of learning to move and its impact on cognition, how the 
neuropsychological aspects of the creative movement process is manifested in the 
brain, and how creative movement or dance can be harnessed to enhance health, 
cognitive function, and quality of life.

BackgroundDementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the second most common dementia 
after Alzheimer's disease. Currently, no specific therapeutic agents are 
available for DLB. However, evidence of cholinergic deficits suggests that 
enhancing central cholinergic function may be a viable therapeutic 
approach.ObjectiveTo assess cognitive changes in DLB patients treated with 
cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) in a real-world setting.MethodsThis 
retrospective study in a prospective database analyzed data from three dementia 
clinics between May 2012 and December 2022. Patients with DLB were divided into 
two groups: those treated with ChEIs and those untreated. Differences in changes 
in multiple cognitive-related scales between the two groups were 
analyzed.ResultsThe study included 204 DLB patients, with 133 (65.2%) in the 
ChEIs group and 71 (34.8%) in the non-ChEIs group. Initial demographic and 
clinical characteristics were similar between groups. Over time, patients in the 
ChEIs group showed significantly higher scores on the Mini-Mental State 
Examination and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment compared to the non-ChEIs 
group, indicating improved cognitive function. No significant differences were 
observed in activities of daily living scores.ConclusionsChEIs improved 
cognitive symptoms in DLB patients in the "real world" study. These findings are 
consistent with those from a previous small-sample randomized controlled trial. 
Longitudinal data indicate sustained benefits with continuous ChEIs use in three 
years. Overall, ChEIs show substantial potential for improving cognitive 
symptoms in DLB patients.

The ApoE-ε4 gene is a well-established genetic risk factor for neurodegenerative 
diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis, which are 
characterized by axonal demyelination in the central nervous system. Recent 
studies have implicated ApoE-ε4 in age-related hearing loss (ARHL), suggesting a 
potential role of APOE4 isoform in peripheral nervous system degeneration. 
However, the role of APOE4 in ARHL are still unclear. In this study, we explored 
the potential role of APOE4 in axonal demyelination of spiral ganglion neurons 
(SGNs). ApoE-ε4/ε4 (APOE4) and ApoE-ε3/ε3 (APOE3) mice were used to characterize 
SGNs. The effect of APOE4 on phagocytosis and autophagy as well as intracellular 
cholesterol level was evaluated in resident cochlear macrophages (RCMs) and 
mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). The results showed that 
significant axonal demyelination was observed in SGNs of 10-month-old APOE4 
mice, accompanied by the presence of myelin debris engulfed by RCMs. Meanwhile, 
inhibited phagocytosis of myelin debris and impaired lipophagy were detected in 
APOE4 RCMs and APOE4 BMDMs with an aberrant accumulation of lipid droplets 
(LDs), which could be reversed by trehalose treatment. This study provided a 
deep insight into the pathogenesis of APOE4-induced axonal demyelination of SGNs 
associated with the impaired lipophagy in RCMs, which helped to elucidate the 
underlying mechanism of ApoE-ε4 in ARHL.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD) is a common cognitive disease 
in Japan. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is regarded as an early, but abnormal 
state of cognitive impairment, and amnestic MCI (aMCI) as a precursor of ADD. 
The Revised Hasegawa Dementia Scale (HDS-R) and the similar Mini-Mental State 
Examination (MMSE) are quick cognitive assessments widely used in Japan. 
Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are commonly assessed 
using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q). However, when the 
different types of BPSD appear and how they progress with the progression of ADD 
is not clear.
METHODS: A total of 553 outpatients with ADD or aMCI participated. We divided 
the patients into six cognitive function groups. We examined the relationship 
between the individual NPI-Q domain scores and cognitive function to reveal the 
appearance and progression of BPSD. We also examined the relationship of the 
NPI-Q domains with the HDS-R and MMSE domains to reveal the cognitive functions 
that affect the BPSD.
RESULTS: Our results suggested that hallucinations, agitation/aggression, 
anxiety, irritability/lability appeared in association with high MMSE scores and 
progressed slowly. Apathy/indifference and aberrant motor behaviors appeared in 
association with middle MMSE scores and progressed slowly. Delusions and 
nighttime behavior disturbances appeared in association with high MMSE score and 
progressed consistently with the ADD. Memory and orientation were the cognitive 
functions most related to NPI-Q domain scores and thus to progression of BPSD.
CONCLUSIONS: Memory and orientation may be the most important cognitive 
functions related to the progression of BPSD in patients with ADD.

Caregiving Activities and Outcomes Among Family Caregivers of Individuals With 
and Without Parkinson's Disease and Lewy Body Dementia in California Caregiver 
Resource Centers.

Whitney RL, Bell JF, Ogugu E, Bhurtel S, Link BM, Tonkikh O, Kelly K, Young HM.

PURPOSE: To describe characteristics and outcomes of family caregivers for 
persons with Parkinson's disease and Lewy body dementia (PD/LBD) and compare 
them to those of other family caregivers.
METHOD: Using a California statewide database, we examined caregiver 
characteristics and outcomes (strain, loneliness, worse health, and depressive 
symptoms) and compared them by care recipient diagnosis (PD/LBD, Alzheimer's 
disease and related dementias, or other chronic conditions) using descriptive 
statistics and multivariable logistic regression.
RESULTS: PD/LBD caregivers were more likely to identify as female, married, and 
college-educated; engage in high-intensity caregiving; and report their care 
recipient wakes them or others up at night. In multivariable models, PD/LBD 
caregiving was associated with worse health. Among PD/LBD caregivers, performing 
medical/nursing tasks was associated with higher odds of strain, loneliness, 
worse health, and depressive symptoms.
CONCLUSION: PD/LBD caregivers are a distinct group who often experience 
high-demand caregiving. Tailored support can help address the unique needs of 
this population.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Disturbances in brain catecholamine activity may be 
associated with symptoms after exposure to repetitive head impacts (RHIs) or 
related chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). In this article, we studied CSF 
catecholamines in former professional and college American football players and 
examined the relationship with football proxies of RHI exposure, CTE 
probability, cognitive performance, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and parkinsonism.
METHODS: In this observational cross-sectional study, we examined male former 
American football players, professional ("PRO") or college ("COL") level, and 
asymptomatic unexposed male ("UE") individuals from the DIAGNOSE CTE Research 
Project. Catecholamines-norepinephrine (NE) and its metabolite, 
3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG), and dopamine (DA) and its precursor, 
3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA), and metabolite, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic 
acid (DOPAC)-were measured in CSF with high-performance liquid chromatography 
and compared across groups with analysis of covariance. Multivariable linear 
regression models tested the relationship between CSF catecholamines and proxies 
of RHI exposure (e.g., total years of playing American football), factor scores 
for cognition, and neurobehavioral dysregulation (explosivity, emotional 
dyscontrol, impulsivity, affective lability), as well as depressive/anxiety 
symptoms, measured with the Beck Depression/Anxiety Inventories. CTE probability 
and parkinsonism were assessed using the National Institute of Neurological 
Disorders and Stroke consensus diagnostic criteria for traumatic encephalopathy 
syndrome (TES), and biomarkers were compared among different diagnostic groups.
RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 120 former American football players (85 PRO 
players, 35 COL players) and 35 UE participants (age 45-75). Former players had 
significantly lower levels of NE (mean difference = -0.114, 95% CI -0.190 to 
-0.038), l-DOPA (-0.121, 95% CI -0.109 to -0.027), and DOPAC (-0.116, 95% CI 
-0.177 to -0.054) than UE participants. For NE and DOPAC, these overall group 
differences were primarily due to differences between the PRO and UE cohorts. No 
significant differences were found across TES-CTE probability subgroups or 
TES-parkinsonism diagnostic groups. Within the COL cohort, tested as post hoc 
analyses, higher CSF NE and l-DOPA were associated with higher neurobehavioral 
dysregulation factor scores, BAI total score, and worse executive functioning 
and processing speed. CSF DHPG and DOPAC were associated with impulsivity only 
in this subgroup.
DISCUSSION: We observed reduced CSF catecholamine concentrations in former elite 
American football players, although the relationship with degree of RHI exposure 
and the clinical impact needs further study.

Transcranial pulse stimulation (TPS) is a noninvasive neuromodulation therapy 
with Conformité Européenne (CE) marking for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). Initial pilot studies have demonstrated promising effects on cognitive 
function. This article focuses on the procedure for treating patients with AD 
using an MRI-guided, neuro-navigated TPS device. The protocol to be followed for 
this is described in detail, including the necessary procedures and device 
settings. A brief overview of the representative clinical results published to 
date is also provided. In addition to significant clinical improvements in 
cognition and affect, adverse events (AE) and possible adverse device events 
(ADE) are presented to provide safety data. Finally, the method is critically 
discussed. In the future, randomized controlled trials should be conducted to 
rule out any placebo effects. There is also currently a lack of long-term 
studies with a larger number of patients. Despite these unresolved questions, 
TPS has the potential as an adjunct treatment for Alzheimer's patients when used 
in a controlled, scientifically guided setting.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer disease (AD) is a severe neurological brain disorder. 
While not curable, earlier detection can help improve symptoms substantially. 
Machine learning (ML) models are popular and well suited for medical image 
processing tasks such as computer-aided diagnosis. These techniques can improve 
the process for an accurate diagnosis of AD.
OBJECTIVE: In this paper, a complete computer-aided diagnosis system for the 
diagnosis of AD has been presented. We investigate the performance of some of 
the most used ML techniques for AD detection and classification using 
neuroimages from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) and 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) datasets.
METHODS: The system uses artificial neural networks (ANNs) and support vector 
machines (SVMs) as classifiers, and dimensionality reduction techniques as 
feature extractors. To retrieve features from the neuroimages, we used principal 
component analysis (PCA), linear discriminant analysis, and t-distributed 
stochastic neighbor embedding. These features are fed into feedforward neural 
networks (FFNNs) and SVM-based ML classifiers. Furthermore, we applied the 
vision transformer (ViT)-based ANNs in conjunction with data augmentation to 
distinguish patients with AD from healthy controls.
RESULTS: Experiments were performed on magnetic resonance imaging and positron 
emission tomography scans. The OASIS dataset included a total of 300 patients, 
while the ADNI dataset included 231 patients. For OASIS, 90 (30%) patients were 
healthy and 210 (70%) were severely impaired by AD. Likewise for the ADNI 
database, a total of 149 (64.5%) patients with AD were detected and 82 (35.5%) 
patients were used as healthy controls. An important difference was established 
between healthy patients and patients with AD (P=.02). We examined the 
effectiveness of the three feature extractors and classifiers using 5-fold 
cross-validation and confusion matrix-based standard classification metrics, 
namely, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, F1-score, and area under 
the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Compared with the 
state-of-the-art performing methods, the success rate was satisfactory for all 
the created ML models, but SVM and FFNN performed best with the PCA extractor, 
while the ViT classifier performed best with more data. The data 
augmentation/ViT approach worked better overall, achieving accuracies of 93.2% 
(sensitivity=87.2, specificity=90.5, precision=87.6, F1-score=88.7, and 
AUROC=92) for OASIS and 90.4% (sensitivity=85.4, specificity=88.6, 
precision=86.9, F1-score=88, and AUROC=90) for ADNI.
CONCLUSIONS: Effective ML models using neuroimaging data could help physicians 
working on AD diagnosis and will assist them in prescribing timely treatment to 
patients with AD. Good results were obtained on the OASIS and ADNI datasets with 
all the proposed classifiers, namely, SVM, FFNN, and ViTs. However, the results 
show that the ViT model is much better at predicting AD than the other models 
when a sufficient amount of data are available to perform the training. This 
highlights that the data augmentation process could impact the overall 
performance of the ViT model.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is irreversible, progressive, and refractory in nature 
and is managed very poorly clinically due to very limited treatment outcomes. 
Unfortunately, most of the multiple clinical trials involving AD patients were 
unsuccessful in improving the disease prognosis. At the cellular level, many 
signaling pathways have been proposed to be involved in the sterile/refractory 
behavior of degenerating neurons in AD. Due to the involvement of p38MAPK in the 
pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, numerous investigations have attempted to 
determine the beneficial effects of MAPK targeting on memory, inflammatory 
programming of the brain, and synaptic plasticity. In view of this, various 
clinical trials involving several MAPK inhibitors (with good safety profiles and 
few side effects) have yielded positive results in AD patients, suggesting that 
MAPK targeting may be effective for reducing the pathogenesis of AD, but due to 
selectivity, dosing, and patient stratification, this aspect still needs further 
development. In view of their selectivity and off-target effects, only a few 
MAPK inhibitors have been employed in clinical trials against AD, indicating the 
scope of their development in this area. Therefore, this study focused on 
MAPK-based interventions as an upcoming and innovative approach for alleviating 
AD, with a special emphasis on clinical studies.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is regarded as a neurodegenerative disease, and it has 
been proposed that AD may be a systemic disease. Studies have reported 
associations between non-neurological diseases and AD. The correlations between 
AD pathology and systemic (non-neurological) pathological changes are intricate, 
and the mechanisms underlying these correlations and their causality are 
unclear. In this article, we review the association between AD and disorders of 
other systems. In addition, we summarize the possible mechanisms associated with 
AD and disorders of other systems, mainly from the perspective of AD pathology. 
Regarding the relationship between AD and systemic pathological changes, we aim 
to provide a new outlook on the early warning signs and treatment of AD, such as 
establishing a diagnostic and screening system based on more accessible 
peripheral samples.

BACKGROUND: In Down syndrome (DS) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), nerve growth 
factor precursor protein (proNGF) accumulates in the brain. However, its 
non-invasive detection using neuron-derived extracellular vesicles (NDEVs) from 
plasma remains unexplored.
METHODS: We included 139 adults with DS (45 asymptomatic [aDS], 94 symptomatic 
for AD [sDS]) and 37 healthy controls. NDEVs were isolated from plasma. ProNGF 
and tetraspanin (CD81) were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We 
assessed proNGF/CD81 changes with age, along the AD continuum (aDS and sDS), and 
associations with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), plasma biomarkers, episodic memory, 
and basal forebrain volume.
RESULTS: In DS, proNGF/CD81 levels increased with age and were higher in NDEVs 
from asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals compared to controls, with the 
highest levels in the symptomatic group. ProNGF correlated with CSF 
phosphorylated tau (p-tau)181, plasma p-tau217, neurofilament light chain, and 
episodic memory.
DISCUSSION: ProNGF/CD81 levels in NDEVs increase along the AD continuum in DS 
and parallel tau pathology, indicating the potential as a promising biomarker 
for monitoring disease progression in plasma.
HIGHLIGHTS: Nerve growth factor precursor protein (ProNGF)/tetraspanin (CD81) 
ratio increased in the third decade of life, 20 years before Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) symptom onset in Down syndrome (DS). proNGF/CD81 concentrations were 
significantly higher in individuals with DS compared to controls and were 
notably elevated in individuals with DS and symptomatic AD compared to 
asymptomatic AD. proNGF/CD81 concentrations were associated with tau pathology 
and neuronal injury.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that is 
still incurable. Therapy with stem cell or extracellular vesicles is a promising 
strategy for AD treatment. Therefore, we evaluated whether stem cell-derived 
extracellular vesicles could improve cognitive function and pathological 
features in AD model mice.
METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and The Cochrane Library were searched 
for studies reporting stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles treatment of AD 
mice from the establishment of each database to 1st August 2023. SYRCLE was used 
to assess the risk of bias. The extracted data were analyzed using RevMan 5.4 
and Stata 15 software.
RESULTS: 19 studies were included in the analysis. Meta-analysis showed that 
treatment with stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles significantly improved 
cognitive performance of AD mice in the Morris water maze test and the novel 
object recognition test, reduced β-amyloid deposition, alleviated 
neuroinflammation and decreased levels of the proinflammatory cytokines and 
glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in the brain of AD mice. However, stem 
cell-derived extracellular vesicle did not affect the level of brain 
phosphorylated tau (p-Tau).
CONCLUSIONS: stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles may promote the 
degradation of β-amyloid plaques in the brain, regulate immunity and protect 
nerves, which result in cognitive improvement in AD mice.

Periodontitis is a chronic infectious inflammatory disease primarily caused by 
periodontal pathogenic bacteria, which poses a significant threat to human 
health. The pathogenic mechanisms associated with Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. 
gingivalis), a principal causative agent of periodontitis, are particularly 
complex and warrant thorough investigation. The extensive array of virulence 
factors released by this bacterium during its growth and pathogenesis not only 
inflicts localized damage to periodontal tissues but is also intricately linked 
to the development of systemic diseases through various mechanisms. The outer 
membrane vesicles (OMVs) produced by P. gingivalis play a key role in this 
process. These OMVs serve as important mediators of communication between 
bacteria and host cells and other bacteria, carrying and delivering virulence 
factors to host cells and distant tissues, thereby damaging host cells and 
exacerbating inflammatory responses. The ability of these OMVs to disseminate 
and deliver bacterial virulence factors allows P. gingivalis to play a 
pathogenic role far beyond the confines of the periodontal tissue and has been 
closely associated with the development of a variety of systemic diseases such 
as cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes 
mellitus, non-alcoholic hepatitis, and cancer. In view of this, it is of great 
pathophysiological and clinical significance to deeply investigate its 
pathogenic role and related mechanisms. This will not only help to better 
understand the pathogenesis of periodontitis and its related systemic diseases 
but also provide new ideas and more effective and precise strategies for the 
early diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of these diseases. However, the 
current research in this field is still insufficient and in-depth, and many key 
issues and mechanisms need to be further elucidated. This article summarizes the 
recent research progress on the role of P. gingivalis OMVs (P. g-OMVs) in 
related diseases, with the aim of providing a theoretical basis and direction 
for future research and revealing the pathogenic mechanism of P. g-OMVs more 
comprehensively.

Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's 
disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Huntington's disease 
(HD), are defined by aberrant protein accumulation, brain atrophy, and gradual 
decline of neuronal function. Despite the considerable endeavors devoted to 
discovering treatments for NDs in recent decades, the demand for efficient 
therapeutic agents persists. Sertoli cells (SCs) play a crucial role in 
providing a supportive structure and environment for the development of germ 
cells. SCs, whether transplanted as xenogeneic or allogeneic cells, present a 
viable choice for enhancing graft persistence via the release of 
immunomodulatory and trophic factors, including neurturin (NTN), 
platelet-derived growth factor, Fas (CD95) ligand (FasL), glial-derived 
neurotrophic factor, interleukin 1 (IL1), brain-derived neurotrophic factor, 
interleukin 6 (IL6), transforming growth factors, and vascular growth factor, 
that protect replaced cells and tissues from the immune system. However, there 
is currently no cohesive evidence regarding the neuroprotective influence of the 
transplantation of SCs on NDs. Therefore, this review focuses on assessing stem 
cells' neuroprotective impact on neurodegenerative diseases in pre-clinical 
settings and presenting cohesive information. A comprehensive search was 
conducted between 2000 and 2022. In the identification stage, after a 
comprehensive search across databases, including Web of Science, Scopus, and 
PubMed/Medline, 103 papers were obtained. The search conducted in the present 
study yielded a total of nine relevant papers on the therapeutic effect of the 
transplantation of SCs on NDs. It was found that the transplantation of SCs 
exhibits a promising impact on enhancing the symptoms of neurological diseases 
in rats. The findings highlight the need for multiple standardized pre-clinical 
trials to find reliable information to confirm the utilization of the 
transplantation of SCs and the reduction of the symptoms of neurodegenerative 
diseases.

Current therapeutic regimens approved to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD) provide 
symptomatic relief by replenishing the acetylcholine levels in the brain by 
inhibiting AChE. However, these drugs don't halt or slow down the progression of 
Alzheimer's disease, which remains a major challenge. Evidence suggests a 
significant increase in BuChE activity with a decrease in AChE activity as the 
AD progresses along with the Aβ1-42 aggregation. To address this unmet need, we 
rationally developed sulfenylated 5-aminopyrazoles (3a-3o) via electro-organic 
synthesis in good to excellent yields (68-89%) and duly characterized them using 
spectrophotometric techniques. The compounds were tested for 
acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) inhibition, with 
3b (4-NO2) showing the highest potency. It exhibited IC50 values of 1.634 ± 
0.066 μM against AChE and 0.0285 ± 0.019 μM against BuChE, outperforming 
donepezil and tacrine. Admittedly, 3b effectively inhibited Aβ1-42 aggregation 
and enhanced working memory, as indicated by the Y-maze test, besides portraying 
no cytotoxicity. The outcome was further corroborated using in silico 
techniques, leading to the elucidation of plausible inhibition and metabolism 
mechanisms.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive dementia, is one of the most common 
neurodegenerative diseases. Clinical trial results of amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau 
regulators based on the pretext of straightforward amyloid and tau immunotherapy 
were disappointing. There are currently no effective strategies for slowing the 
progression of AD. Herein, we spotlight the dysregulation of lipid metabolism, 
particularly the elevation of ceramides (Cers), as a critical yet underexplored 
facet of AD pathogenesis. Our study delineates the role of Cers in promoting 
microglial pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death distinct from apoptosis 
and necroptosis, characterized by cellular swelling, and membrane rupture 
mediated by the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway. Utilizing both in vivo experiments 
with amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin 1 (PS1) transgenic mice and 
in vitro assays with BV-2 microglial cells, we investigate the activation of 
microglial pyroptosis by Cers and its inhibition by icariin (ICA), a flavonoid 
with known antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Our findings reveal a 
significant increase in Cers levels and pyroptosis markers (NOD-like receptor 
family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), apoptosis-associated speck-like 
protein containing a caspase recruitment domain, caspase-1, gasdermin D 
(gasdermin D (GSDMD)), and interleukin-18 (IL-18)) in the brains of AD model 
mice, indicating a direct involvement of Cers in AD pathology through the 
induction of microglial pyroptosis. Conversely, ICA treatment effectively 
reduces these pyroptotic markers and Cer levels, thereby attenuating microglial 
pyroptosis and suggesting a novel therapeutic mechanism of action against AD. 
This study not only advances our understanding of the pathogenic role of Cers in 
AD but also introduces ICA as a promising candidate for AD therapy, capable of 
mitigating neuroinflammation and pyroptosis through the cyclooxygenase-2 
(COX-2)-NLRP3 inflammasome-gasdermin D (GSDMD) axis. Our results pave the way 
for further exploration of Cer metabolism disorders in neurodegenerative 
diseases and highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting microglial 
pyroptosis in AD.

The gliotransmitter adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) and its enzymatic 
degradation product adenosine play a major role in orchestrating in the 
hippocampus cognitive and affective functions via P2 purinoceptors (P2X, P2Y) 
and P1 adenosine receptors (A1, A2A). Although numerous reviews exist on 
purinoceptors that modulate these functions, there is an apparent gap relating 
to the involvement of astrocyte-derived extracellular ATP. Our review focuses on 
the following issues: An impeded release of ATP from hippocampal astrocytes 
through vesicular mechanisms or connexin hemichannels and pannexin channels 
interferes with spatial working memory in rodents. The pharmacological blockade 
of P2Y1 receptors (P2Y1Rs) reverses the deficits in learning/memory performance 
in mouse models of familial Alzheimer's disease (AD). Similarly, in mouse models 
of major depressive disorder (MDD), based on acute or chronic stress-induced 
development of depressive-like behavior, a reduced exocytotic/channel-mediated 
ATP release from hippocampal astrocytes results in the deterioration of these 
behavioral responses. However, on the opposite, the increased stimulation of the 
microglial/astrocytic P2X7R-channel by ATP causes neuroinflammation and in 
consequence depressive-like behavior. In conclusion, there is strong evidence 
for the assumption that gliotransmitter ATP is intimately involved in the 
pathophysiology of cognitive and affective neuron/astrocyte-based human 
illnesses opening new diagnostic and therapeutic vistas for AD and MDD.

Virchow-Robin spaces (VRS) are perivascular compartments in the brain lined by 
the pia mater, surrounding penetrating arteries and veins. They play a crucial 
role in interstitial fluid drainage within the glymphatic system and may 
contribute to immune responses. Typically small and asymptomatic, these spaces 
can sometimes enlarge, forming dilated Virchow-Robin spaces, which are often 
identified incidentally on MRI, especially in elderly individuals. Their 
clinical significance has been increasingly recognized due to their potential 
link with neurodegenerative diseases. We present the case of a 60-year-old 
retired firefighter who experienced recurrent syncopal episodes along with 
progressive neurological symptoms, including bradykinesia and memory impairment. 
Brain MRI revealed extensive cystic dilation of periventricular spaces, 
predominantly in the lenticulostriate region, characteristic of dilated VRS. 
This case underscores the importance of understanding the mechanisms underlying 
VRS dilation, distinguishing it from other brain lesions such as lacunar 
infarcts, neoplasms, and infectious diseases, and highlights the role of MRI in 
diagnosis. Additionally, we review the literature on dilated VRS and its 
potential implications in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's 
disease and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).

Natural products have long served as versatile templates for discovering lead 
molecules against various targets of pharmacological interest. Kojic acid, a 
fungal metabolite epitomizes this versatility as it elicits broad-spectrum 
biological properties. Described herein is a series of heteroaryl thiol-linked 
kojic acid derivatives that demonstrate potent acetylcholinesterase (AChE) 
inhibition along with anti-amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregation activity and blood brain 
barrier (BBB) permeability highlighting their potential as a novel class of 
Anti-Alzheimer's therapeutics. Seventeen kojic acid derivatives, synthesized by 
incorporating three different heterocyclic thiols, were evaluated for in vitro 
AChE inhibition employing Ellman's method. The most potent analogs identified 
from the AChE inhibition studies were further evaluated for binding to the 
peripheral anionic site (PAS) of AChE using the propidium iodide (PI) 
displacement assay, anti-amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregation inhibition using the 
thioflavin T assay, and BBB permeability using the PAMPA-BBB assay. Obtained 
findings indicated that two compounds MS 21-05 and MS 21-11 bearing a 
5-methoxybenzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)thio moiety and 5-phenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazol- 
2-yl)thio moiety, respectively, elicited potent AChE inhibition (IC₅₀ < 5 µM), 
moderate anti-Aβ aggregation effects and good BBB permeability. The molecular 
docking studies of compound MS 21 - 11 along with its molecular dynamics 
simulations at peripheral anionic site (PAS) of enzyme AChE provided structural 
insights into the binding mode of these derivatives. Taken together, the 
findings of this study establish heteroaryl thiol-linked kojic acid derivatives 
as a valuable molecular framework for developing anti-Alzheimer's therapeutics 
that target both cholinergic dysfunction and amyloid-β aggregation.

tool with significant therapeutic potential for age-related diseases, including 
Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, cardiovascular disorders, and 
osteoporosis. This study presents a bibliometric analysis of CRISPR-Cas9 
research in age-related diseases, identifying key contributors, major research 
hotspots, and critical technological advancements. While promising applications 
have been demonstrated in gene repair, functional regulation, and molecular 
interventions, significant barriers persist, including off-target effects, low 
delivery efficiency, and limited editing in non-dividing cells. Ethical concerns 
over germline editing and gaps in long-term safety data further complicate 
clinical translation. Future directions emphasize the development of 
high-precision Cas9 variants, homology-directed repair-independent tools, and 
efficient delivery systems, alongside the establishment of international 
regulatory frameworks and multicenter clinical trials. These efforts are 
essential to fully realize the potential of CRISPR-Cas9 in addressing the global 
health challenges of aging.

The bidirectional modulation of cerebral neurons in the brain possesses 
enhancement and inhibition of neural activity, which is of great interest in the 
treatment of motor nerve disorders and emotional disorders, and cognitive 
defects. However, existing approaches usually rely on electrical/electrochemical 
stimulations, which show low security by implanting metal probes and 
unidirectional currents with single modulation. Herein, an implantable 
in-hydrogel wireless supercapacitor-activated neuron system consisting of the 
coil, diode bridge circuit, in-hydrogel supercapacitor, and stimulation 
electrodes is fabricated, which provides a bidirectional and adjustable ion 
diffusion current to safely and effectively excite and inhibit brain neurons. 
The designed in-hydrogel supercapacitor exhibits a high storage charge ability 
of ≈90 times larger than the devices without hydrogel encapsulation, owing to 
the in situ radical addition mechanism. Moreover, the in-hydrogel electrodes are 
implanted into the thalamus, amygdala, and prefrontal lobes of the brain to 
evoke the corresponding changes in potential intensity and frequency through the 
external chargeable coil and diode bridge circuit, which verifies the potential 
of the multimodule supercapacitor in amelioration and treatment Parkinson's, 
severe depression, and Alzheimer's disease.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a significant global health challenge, 
characterized by its progressive neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. The 
urgent need for early diagnosis and effective treatment necessitates the 
identification of reliable biomarkers that can illuminate the underlying 
pathophysiology of AD. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the 
latest advancements in biomarker research, focusing on their applications in 
diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic development. We delve into the 
multifaceted landscape of AD biomarkers, encompassing molecular, imaging, and 
fluid-based markers. The integration of these biomarkers, including amyloid-β 
and tau proteins, neuroimaging modalities, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and 
genetic risk factors, offers a more nuanced understanding of AD's complex 
etiology. By leveraging the power of precision medicine, biomarker-driven 
approaches can enable personalized treatment strategies and enhance diagnostic 
accuracy. Moreover, this review highlights the potential of biomarker research 
to accelerate drug discovery and development. By identifying novel therapeutic 
targets and monitoring disease progression, biomarkers can facilitate the 
evaluation of experimental treatments and ultimately improve patient outcomes. 
In conclusion, this review underscores the critical role of biomarkers in 
advancing our comprehension of AD and driving the development of effective 
interventions. By providing a comprehensive overview of the current 
state-of-the-art, this work aims to inspire future research and contribute to 
the goal of conquering AD.

To date, there are limited empirical data to inform various approaches to 
communication with patients receiving information on Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
risk or diagnosis during the pre-symptomatic or minimally symptomatic stages. 
This article explores the ethical implications of psychological responses known 
as self-fulfilling prophecies that may impact cognitive decline among 
individuals diagnosed with or at risk for AD. We describe questions these 
potential effects raise about the ways clinicians communicate with patients, as 
well as how caregivers may interact with patients. Recent advancements in 
biomarkers and treatment for AD underscore the urgency of understanding these 
phenomena and developing appropriate responses.

BACKGROUND: Adults with Down syndrome (DS) have an elevated risk and early age 
of onset for Alzheimer's disease (AD). To support upcoming clinical AD trials, 
there is a critical need to establish cognitive outcome measures that can be 
used to capture intervention effects. One measure that has successfully been 
used to detect AD-related cognitive decline in the DS population is a measure of 
episodic memory, the modified Cued Recall Test (mCRT). Demonstrated utility of 
the mCRT warrants further investigation into comparisons between the A and B 
versions, free versus cued recall and changes in performance over time to better 
understand sensitivity for tracking memory decline over time based on age and AD 
clinical status.
METHOD: Participants were 272 adults with DS aged 25-81 (mean age = 43.12 years, 
SD = 9.79). Study procedures were completed at three cycles of data collection: 
baseline, 16-month follow-up and 32-month follow-up. Participants were enrolled 
in the Alzheimer Biomarker Consortium-Down Syndrome longitudinal study and 
completed the mCRT as part of a multiday evaluation. Comparisons were made 
between the A and B versions of the mCRT in recall and intrusion scores. 
Participants' ratio of free relative to cued recall was also examined at 
baseline and longitudinally. Participant performance was compared by age group, 
clinical AD status (cognitively stable [CS], mild cognitive impairment [MCI] or 
AD dementia) and premorbid level of intellectual disability (ID).
RESULTS: Version differences were identified, with the most salient differences 
in the moderate and severe/profound ID groups. The mCRT free recall declined 
with age in CS participants. Free and cued recall scores were lower in those 
with MCI and AD dementia, with the exception of the mild ID MCI group, whose 
cued recall scores were not significantly different from the CS group. Decline 
across 32 months (mCRT total score decline of 1.29 points/year) was observed for 
CS participants beginning at ≥ 50 years old, with more pronounced declines in 
adults with DS with an MCI or AD dementia diagnosis (3.36 and 4.20 points/year, 
respectively).
CONCLUSION: Characterising test version differences and participant free versus 
cued recall performance on the mCRT is important for understanding performance 
under testing conditions and to maximise the sensitivity of clinical 
interventions to capture meaningful effects. Our findings suggest that clinical 
AD trials for DS should be cautious about using both versions of the mCRT. 
Examining the profile of free relative to cued recall may enhance sensitivity 
for detecting treatment benefits for adults with DS across the range of 
premorbid ID levels.

Evidence indicates that Poria cocos polysaccharide (PCP) improves cognitive 
impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, its underlying mechanism, 
particularly its relationship with the gut microbiota, remains unclear. In the 
current study, we aimed to investigate the mechanism of PCP in improving 
cognitive impairment in AD. The results demonstrated that PCP markedly enhanced 
cognitive function and mitigated AD-related pathological alterations in 3 × 
Tg-AD mice. PCP treatment reversed the age-dependent gut microbiota dysbiosis in 
3 × Tg-AD mice by 16S rDNA sequencing. The contents of propanoic acid, butanoic 
acid and isohexanoic acid were increased by short-chain fatty acid 
determination. In addition, PCP could restore both the intestinal barrier and 
the blood-brain barrier, as demonstrated by immunofluorescence staining of tight 
junction proteins. Furthermore, PCP alleviated systemic inflammation and 
neuroinflammation, as evidenced by reduced LPS levels in circulation and 
decreased IL-6 levels in the brain, likely by inhibiting the TLR4/NF-κB 
signaling pathway. In conclusion, PCP can reshape gut microbiota to regulate 
short-chain fatty acids and alleviate neuroinflammation-related cognitive 
impairment in AD mice.

Protective immunity, essential for brain maintenance and repair, may be 
compromised in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, using high-dimensional 
single-cell mass cytometry, we find a unique immunometabolic signature in 
circulating CD4+ T cells preceding symptom onset in individuals with familial 
AD, featured by the elevation of CD38 expression. Using female 5xFAD mice, a 
mouse model of AD, we show that treatment with an antibody directed to CD38 
leads to restored metabolic fitness, improved cognitive performance, and 
attenuated local neuroinflammation. Comprehensive profiling across distinct 
immunological niches in 5xFAD mice, reveals a high level of disease-associated 
CD4+ T cells that produce IL-17A in the dural meninges, previously linked to 
cognitive decline. Targeting CD38 leads to abrogation of meningeal TH17 immunity 
and cortical IL-1β, breaking the negative feedback loop between these two 
compartments. Taken together, the present findings suggest CD38 as an 
immunometabolic checkpoint that could be adopted as a pre-symptomatic biomarker 
for early diagnosis of AD, and might also be therapeutically targeted alone or 
in combination with other immunotherapies for disease modification.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder and the 
leading cause of senile dementia. The key risk factor for a more common (&gt;95% 
of cases) sporadic form of AD is age. So far, there are no effective methods for 
AD prevention or treatment. A growing body of evidence indicates that the 
development of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases is associated with the 
activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, and JNK 
signaling pathway is considered as a potential target for the prevention and 
treatment of AD. However, the information on alterations in its activity in 
ontogenesis, which are evaluated by changes in the phosphorylation of its 
components, is extremely limited. The aim of this study was to compare 
age-related changes in the activity of JNK signaling pathway in the hippocampus 
of Wistar rats and senescence-accelerated OXYS rats (which spontaneously develop 
the key symptoms of AD-like pathology) and to evaluate the effect of the 
selective JNK3 inhibitor IQ-1S (11H-indeno[1,2-b]quinoxalin-11-one oxime sodium 
salt). The ability of IQ-1S to suppress accelerated brain aging in OXYS rat has 
been proven previously, but the effect of this inhibitor on the JNK activity has 
not been studied. Here, we showed that with age, the activity of the JNK 
signaling pathway increased in the hippocampus of rats of both strains. At the 
same time, the manifestation and active progression of AD-like pathology in OXYS 
rats was accompanied by the increase in the phosphorylation level of the key 
kinase of this signaling pathway, JNK3, and its target proteins compared to 
Wistar rats, which allowed us to suggest JNK3 as a potential target for 
interventions aimed at preventing neurodegenerative processes. This suggestion 
was supported by the fact that the neuroprotective effect of the selective JNK3 
inhibitor IQ-1S and its ability to suppress the development of neurodegenerative 
processes in OXYS rats were associated with a decrease in the phosphorylation 
levels of JNK3, c-Jun, APP, and Tau in the hippocampus.

Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are a specialized extracellular matrix in the central 
nervous system. They are widely distributed in the brain, with distribution 
patterns varying by brain region. Their unique structure and composition allow 
them to play an important role in a range of physiological and pathological 
activities. In this article, we review the composition and structure of PNNs 
across different life stages, and provide a detailed analysis and comparison of 
the region-specific distribution patterns of PNNs in different brain areas. We 
also discuss the specific mechanisms by which PNNs are involved in plasticity, 
memory, and neuroprotection. Furthermore, we describe the abnormal changes in 
PNNs in aging and various brain diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, 
Parkinson's disease, drug addiction, and schizophrenia. Finally, we review 
emerging and established therapeutic strategies targeting PNNs to modulate brain 
function and address neurological disorders from three perspectives: gene 
therapy, nanotechnology, and biomaterials. This review summarizes the 
physiological roles of PNNs at different stages of life and the mechanisms by 
which PNNs abnormalities contribute to various brain diseases, providing 
insights for potential therapeutic approaches.

The role that neurotrophins, such as nerve growth factor, play in the 
pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases has long been appreciated. However, 
the neuregulin (NRG) family of growth factors and/or their v-erb-B2 avian 
erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog (ERBB) receptors have also been 
implicated in the pathogenesis of conditions, such as Alzheimer disease (AD), 
frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
(ALS). In this review, we consider i) the structural variability of NRG isoforms 
generated by alternative RNA splicing, the use of multiple promoters and 
proteolysis, and the impact that this structural variability has on neuronal and 
glial physiology during development and adulthood. We discuss ii) the NRG 
receptors ERBB2, ERBB3, and ERBB4, how activation of each of these receptors 
further diversifies NRG actions in the central nervous system, and how 
dementia-related proteins, such as γ-secretase modulate the action of NRGs and 
their ERBB receptors. We then iii) turn to the abnormalities in NRG and ERBB 
expression and function evident in human AD and mouse AD models, how these 
abnormalities affect brain function, and attempts to use NRGs to treat AD. 
Finally, iv) we discuss NRG effects on the survival and function of neurons 
relevant to FTLD and ALS, alterations in NRG/ERBB signaling identified in these 
conditions, and the recent discovery of multiple human pedigrees in which 
autosomal dominant FTLD/ALS potentially results from point mutations in ERBB4.

Aberrant activation of tau kinases (tauK) has been proposed as a major step in 
tau hyperphosphorylation and misfolding, and subsequent formation of 
neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, evidence of 
tauK hyperactivation in actual AD brains is scarce and inconsistent, and their 
role in age-related cognitive decline remains undocumented. We evaluated 
activated/inhibited species of CDK5/p35/p25, GSK3α/β, and ERK1/2 as well as ten 
tau/phospho-tau (ptau) peptides (mapping Ser202, Thr217, Ser262, Ser305, and 
Ser404 phospho-residues) by Western blot or selected reaction monitoring 
proteomics, respectively, in postmortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) 
and hippocampal samples of 150 participants from the Rush Memory and Aging 
Project (MAP). Regression models and mediation analyses assessed the 
contributions of these variables to tau phosphorylation, NFT deposition and 
antemortem cognitive status of MAP participants. Surprisingly, greater p25 and 
p35 (indices for CDK5 activation) and lower pSer21/9-GSK3α/β (inhibited species) 
immunodensities were associated with lower ptau peptide amounts. Individuals 
with higher p25 cortical densities displayed better cognitive outcomes, 
particularly working memory. Statistical mediation analyses indicated that the 
beneficial effect of CDK5/p25 on cognition was mediated by lower densities of 
phospho-Thr217-tau and NFT deposition in DLPFC, and also identified Thr217 and 
Ser262 as the ptau sites with greatest influence in both NFT accumulation and 
cognitive impairment. The present data suggest that tau hyperphosphorylation, 
tangle deposition, and the subsequent cognitive impairment do not rely on 
aberrant activation of major tauKs. Additionally, novel evidence was provided 
for the beneficial contribution of cortical CDK5/p25 to the maintenance of 
working memory.

OBJECTIVES: This study presents findings from IDEA Café, for older adults aged 
50 and older living with early dementia, dementia, Alzheimer's Disease or 
cognitive impairment (ED/CI) with no informal caregiver or care partner. IDEA 
Café is a group adaptation of Innovations in Dementia Empowerment and Action 
(IDEA) (built upon the foundation of RDAD). It was tested with sexual and gender 
minority (SGM) older adults, as an underserved population.
METHOD: Employing a two-group randomized controlled pilot trial, thirty 
participants were randomly assigned to IDEA Café (n = 15) or routine medical 
care (RMC; n = 15). Feasibility and acceptability were assessed. We conducted 
pre- and post-treatment assessments of primary and secondary outcomes.
RESULTS: IDEA Café was feasible (attendance, participation), acceptable 
(helpfulness of the program), and met enrollment goals, with 85% of participants 
reporting treatment as helpful. The treatment group showed significant 
improvement in physical functioning (p = 0.04), depressive symptomology 
(p = 0.03), quality of life (p = 0.04), and a reduction in microaggressions 
(p = 0.05) and social exclusion (p = 0.03). The RMC showed no statistical change 
from pretest to posttest.
CONCLUSION: A future randomized controlled trial is needed to test the efficacy 
and sustainability of the intervention and to bring the intervention to scale.

BACKGROUND Diabetes mellitus was the first non-communicable disease to be 
recognized as a 21st century pandemic. Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) results from 
increased insulin resistance (IR) or relative insulin deficiency. IR impairs 
glucose disposal, leading to a compensatory hyper-insulinemic state. Increased 
iron stores as reflected by high serum ferritin (SF) have been associated with 
the development T2DM and affect glucose homeostasis by impairing tissue response 
to insulin. Iron overload (IO) is quite common in essential hypertension (HTN). 
The first clinical effect of epinephrine on SF was reported in 2024, showing 
that epinephrine resulted in normalization of SF and recovery from severe 
COVID-19 infection. CASE REPORT A patient with T2DM, HTN, and dyslipidemia 
associated with hyperferritinemia received the conventional treatment of T2DM 
and HTN, with a poor control of hyperglycemia and HTN. Since the patient had 
elevated SF, we obtained informed written consent for epinephrine's use to lower 
SF. Epinephrine 0.6 mcg/kg was injected subcutaneously under hemodynamic 
monitoring, and the results showed normalization of SF and complete recovery of 
T2DM and HTN. CONCLUSIONS Epinephrine can normalize elevated SF by its iron 
chelating effect; therefore, it can relieve IO and alleviate IR associated with 
T2DM and HTN. Epinephrine has an anti-inflammatory and scavenging properties 
that can inhibit ferroptosis. As a new clinical indication, extensive studies 
are required for further assessment and possible therapeutic uses in IO 
disorders such as hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), Alzheimer disease (AD), 
Parkinsonian disease (PD), and multiple sclerosis (MS).

Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) are becoming a 
global health concern because of their progressive nature and the extent of the 
disability they cause to the affected individuals. Existing therapies for 
neurodegenerative diseases are primarily limited to symptomatic management and 
have shown diminishing efficacy over time, often leading to resistance. 
Therefore, there is an urgent need for novel therapeutic interventions that 
offer improved effectiveness with fewer side effects. A promising approach that 
has been suggested in neurodegenerative diseases, especially AD, is the 
prevention of tau phosphorylation by using kinase inhibitors. CDC2-like kinase 
1 (CLK1) is a dual-specificity proline-directed protein kinase that is involved 
in both tau phosphorylation and splicing regulation and is thus a potential drug 
target. Currently, there are several small molecular CLK1 inhibitors, but 
problems like drug resistance and side effects still exist. In this study, we 
have used a structure-guided virtual screening approach to screen the bioactive 
phytoconstituents of Indian medicinal plants for potential CLK1 inhibitors. The 
systematic virtual screening involving molecular docking, density functional 
theory (DFT), and pharmacokinetic profiling, pinpointed Hernandonine and 
Anolobine as promising compounds due to their druglike properties and high 
binding affinity with CLK1. To assess the stability and interaction of these 
compounds with CLK1, all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and essential 
dynamics were performed for 500 ns. The results indicate that Hernandonine and 
Anolobine have a high potential for CLK1 inhibition and can be used as promising 
leads for developing novel effective drugs against neurodegeneration. This work 
underlines the importance of the combined use of virtual screening and MD 
simulations in the search for phytochemical-based CLK1 inhibitors, which can 
lead to the development of new therapeutic approaches in the treatment of 
neurodegenerative diseases such as AD.

Following the recent approvals of anti-amyloid immunotherapies as 
"first-in-kind" disease-modifying agents for Alzheimer's disease (AD), there is 
an emerging emphasis in combination therapies, given the complex and 
multifactorial etiopathogenesis and pathophysiology of the disease. The EU/US 
CTAD Task Force met in Madrid in October 2024, to discuss biological rationale 
and methodological issues and outline potential directions for future research 
in combination therapies. The Task Force agreed on the necessity and urgency of 
advancing combination therapies for AD treatment. As of January 1, 2024, in the 
drug development pipeline, there were 21 combination trials (13 % of all 
trials). The combination of anti-amyloid and anti-tau therapies could become a 
central focus of the field. Combinations involving anti-inflammatory and immune 
mechanisms with anti-amyloid or other therapies also have promise. To facilitate 
the development and implementation of combination therapies, collaborations 
between sponsors and public-private partnerships are essential. Optimizing the 
likelihood of success primarily requires leveraging the use of biomarkers and a 
clearer understanding of the biological mechanisms underpinning AD and their 
interactions, especially those involving amyloid, tau, and inflammation, that 
lead to cognitive decline and progression.

This study aims to prepare, characterize, and evaluate the potential of 
chitosan-coated bovine serum albumin nanoparticles (CS-BSANPs) loaded with 
resveratrol (RES) to enhance the therapeutic properties of RES and target 
Alzheimer's disease in elderly females. As confirmed by morphological analysis, 
the BSANPs were synthesized using desolvation techniques, resulting in spherical 
and smooth nanoparticles. Both RES-BSANPs and CS-RES-BSANPs exhibited stability 
for 90 days at ambient refrigerated temperatures. Through optimization using a 
Box-Behnken design, RES-BSANPs with favorable colloidal properties were 
achieved. Differential scanning calorimetry and powder X-ray diffraction 
confirmed the amorphous dispersion of RES within the nanocarriers. In vitro drug 
release studies demonstrated a biphasic release pattern aligned with the 
Korsmeyer-Peppas model, exhibiting both burst and sustained release phases. 
Stability tests indicated that RES-BSA-NPs and CS-RES-NPs remain stable at 4 °C. 
Ex vivo studies verified the safety of RES-loaded nanoparticles, and behavioral 
tests on the Wistar rat model showed that intranasally administered 
CS-RES-BSANPs were more effective than plain RES dispersion. These results 
emphasize the potential of biodegradable and mucoadhesive CS-RES-BSANPs as 
effective drug carriers for intranasal delivery to the brain, offering safety 
and high tolerability for Alzheimer's disease treatment.

BACKGROUND: Published results of our Phase I safety and feasibility trial of 
accelerated intermittent theta burst stimulation (a-iTBS) in mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease showed a large effect-size 
improvement in cognition.
OBJECTIVE: Further demonstrate target engagement by identifying whether changes 
in local and network-level functional connectivity relate to the observed 
cognitive improvement.
METHODS: Eighteen patients with MCI received 3-day a-iTBS (8 sessions/day) to 
the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex at Beam F3 (14,400 total pulses) and 
completed MRI and cognitive testing at pre- and post-treatment. Based on 
electric field models, we selected 3 stimulated target regions of interest 
(ROIs) which belonged to the frontoparietal (FPN), default mode (DMN), and 
ventral attention (VAT) networks (3 target networks). Metrics of resting-state 
functional connectivity were computed at the ROI level (within-network degree: 
number of connections) and network level (segregation: strength of connectivity 
within-network relative to other networks). We correlated changes in cognition 
and connectivity of the target ROIs and networks; off-target ROI (primary 
visual) and networks served as negative controls.
RESULTS: Improvements in cognition were associated with connectivity changes in 
the target ROIs and networks, but not in off-target negative controls. Positive 
associations were observed for degree of the l-DMN and segregation of target 
networks overall, with significant effects for DMN and VAT.
CONCLUSION: Cognitive improvement following a-iTBS in MCI may be attributable to 
local and network-level reconfigurations in functional connectivity. These 
findings will inform larger trials designed to further evaluate the neural 
mechanisms of a-iTBS for cognition in MCI.

INTRODUCTION: Glucagon-like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) and Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 
receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) administration has been associated with 
neuroprotective effects in neurodegenerative disorders. We conducted a 
comprehensive synthesis of known effects of GLP-1 and GLP-1 RAs on the 
cognitive, cellular, and molecular changes in neurodegenerative diseases.
METHODS: We examined preclinical and clinical paradigms that investigated 
changes in neurodegenerative disease pathology following administration of GLP-1 
and GLP-1 RAs. Relevant articles were retrieved through OVID (MedLine, Embase, 
AMED, PsychINFO, JBI EBP Database), PubMed, and Web of Science from database 
inception to September 27th, 2024. Primary studies investigating the 
aforementioned changes following GLP-1 and GLP-1 RA administration were 
retrieved for analysis (n = 62).
RESULTS: GLP-1 and GLP-1 RAs (i.e. dulaglutide, exenatide, liraglutide, 
lixisenatide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide) improved cognitive and motor 
function in neurodegenerative diseases in preclinical and clinical paradigms. 
Additionally, GLP-1 and GLP-1 RAs were associated with modulating changes in 
neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and proliferative pathways.
DISCUSSION: We observed that GLP-1 and GLP-1 RAs modulate molecular and cellular 
changes known to govern the phenomenology of neurodegenerative diseases. Future 
research should examine the interaction between signaling molecules, neuronal 
subpopulations, and cognitive effects affected by GLP-1 and GLP-1 RA 
administration.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is a chronic neurodegenerative 
disorder, is marked by the progressive deteriorations in learning and memory 
capabilities. The microbiota-gut-brain axis has come to be regarded as a crucial 
element in relation to the pathogenesis as well as the treatment of AD. 
Eucommiae cortex polysaccharides (EPs), being among the most plentiful 
substances present in the Eucommiae cortex, show the potential to exert 
immunomodulatory and neuroprotective function. However, whether EPs are 
protective against AD and their mechanism of action remain to be investigated 
OBJECTIVES: We hypothesize that EPs can regulate brain glutamine metabolism 
through gut microbiota and the butyric acid metabolized by them, improve 
oxidative stress and autophagy in the brain, and thus alleviate AD.
METHODS: In the present study, we used EPs (0.25 % w/w in food) and fecal 
microbiota transplantation, as well as butyrate supplementation (0.1 M in 
water), to intervene in AD mice. Multi-omics were used to determine the 
mechanism by which EPs improve AD-related learning and memory impairments.
RESULTS: Our results suggest that EPs, functioning as a prebiotic, alleviated 
learning and memory impairments in AD mice. Mechanistically, EPs are able to 
reshape the gut microbiota, promote the growth of gut microbiota involved in 
short-chain fatty acid metabolism, particularly butyrate-producing microbes. The 
butyrate produced by these microbes improves the brain microenvironment by 
modulating oxidative stress and autophagy mediated by brain glutamate 
metabolism, improving learning and memory impairments in AD mice, and inhibiting 
the formation and deposition of beta-amyloid proteins. Fecal microbiota 
transplantation (FMT) and butyrate supplementation further confirm this 
conclusion.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlighted that EPs can alleviate learning and memory 
impairments in AD with a gut microbiota-dependent manner and that butyric acid 
metabolized by butyric acid-metabolizing bacteria in the gut plays a central 
role in regulating brain glutamine metabolism to improve brain 
microenvironmental homeostasis. Meanwhile, the present study provides new 
insights into the treatment of AD with natural products.

Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) is a promising target for addressing 
various neurological disorders and melanoma. Our discovery of a series of 
truncated pyridinylbenzylamines has yielded potent, selective, and membrane 
permeable inhibitors of human neuronal nitric oxide synthase. By implementing an 
efficient synthetic procedure using the Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction, 
we were able to rapidly identify a potent inhibitor. This new inhibitor (18, 
6-(2,3-difluoro-5-((methylamino)methyl)phenyl)-4-methylpyridin-2-amine 
dihydrochloride) exhibits excellent potency, with Ki values of 30 nM for human 
nNOS and 40 nM for rat nNOS. It also demonstrates high isoform selectivity, 
showing an 821-fold preference for human nNOS over human endothelial NOS (eNOS) 
and a 75-fold selectivity over human inducible NOS (iNOS). Additionally, 
inhibitor 18 displays high permeability (Pe = 10.7 × 10-6 cm s-1) in an 
artificial membrane permeability assay. The crystal structures of several 
NOS-inhibitor complexes provide valuable structural insights into the potency 
and selectivity of this series of novel inhibitors. A particularly notable 
finding is the unexpected role of a Cl- anion bound to heNOS, which contributes 
to the high isoform selectivity of these inhibitors and explains why heNOS binds 
Cl-, while hnNOS does not. This unique Cl- binding site could be important in 
future inhibitor design, opening new avenues for the development of more 
selective NOS inhibitors. Additionally, the presented crystal structures reveal 
the key factors required to maintain both high potency and selectivity in the 
simplified inhibitors discussed in this study. Abbreviations: NO, nitric oxide;

Fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) are a family of small proteins involved in 
fatty acid (FA) subcellular trafficking. In the adult central nervous system, 
FABP7, one of the members of this family, is highly expressed in astrocytes and 
participates in lipid metabolism, regulation of gene expression, and energy 
homeostasis. Reactive astrocytes in Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis animal models upregulate FABP7 expression. This upregulation may 
contribute to the pro-inflammatory phenotype that astrocytes display during 
neurodegeneration and is detrimental for co-cultured neurons. Here, we explore 
how FABP7 expression modulates astrocyte response to inflammatory stimuli. Our 
results showed that silencing FABP7 expression in astrocyte cultures before 
treatment with different inflammatory stimuli decreases the expression of a 
luciferase reporter expressed under the control of NF-κB -response elements. 
Correspondingly, FABP7-silenced astrocytes display decreased nuclear 
translocation of the NF-κB-p65 subunit in response to these stimuli. Moreover, 
silencing FABP7 decreases the toxicity of stimulated astrocytes toward 
co-cultured motor neurons. Similar results were obtained after silencing FABP7 
in human astrocytes differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells. Finally, 
knockdown of astrocytic FABP7 expression in vivo reduces glial activation in the 
cerebral cortex of mice after systemic bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 
administration. In addition, whole transcriptome RNA sequencing analysis from 
the cerebral cortex of LPS-treated mice showed a differential inflammatory 
transcriptional profile, with attenuation of NF-κB-dependent transcriptional 
response after FABP7 knockdown. Together, our results highlight the potential of 
FABP7 as a target to modulate neuroinflammation in the central nervous system.

Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), composed of tau protein fibrils, together with 
brain inflammation and synaptic loss, are neuropathological hallmarks of several 
neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Compared with tau 
fibrils, more water-soluble assemblies of either recombinant or patient-derived 
tau have been reported to exert relatively potent rapid synaptotoxic effects, 
including inhibition of synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) in the 
hippocampus. Less is known regarding the action of exogenous tau soluble 
assemblies on the opposite form of synaptic plasticity, long-term depression 
(LTD). We compared the synaptic plasticity actions of two relatively standard 
preparations of soluble recombinant tau assemblies, (i) fibril-derived soluble 
sonicated tau aggregates (SτAs) and (ii) oligomer-enriched tau (oTau) prepared 
from monomers. Consistent with previous findings, intracerebroventricular 
injections of either SτAs or oTau acutely inhibited high-frequency 
stimulation-induced LTP at CA3-to-CA1 synapses in the anaesthetized rat 
hippocampus. However, LTP inhibition by oTau, but not SτAs, was prevented by 
co-injection with the conformational anti-tau monoclonal antibody, TOMA1. 
Furthermore, in contrast to SτAs, which inhibited LTD, injection of oTau 
potently facilitated LTD, decreasing the threshold for LTD induction by 
low-frequency stimulation. To test the role of pro-inflammatory cytokines in 
mediating the disruptive effects of the two forms of soluble tau on synaptic 
plasticity we pre-injected etanercept, a decoy receptor for tumor necrosis 
factor alpha (TNFα). Etanercept reduced the disruption of synaptic plasticity by 
oTau but not by SτAs. Moreover, injection of exogenous TNFα mimicked the 
facilitation of LTD by oTau, consistent with a role of this pro-inflammatory 
cytokine in LTD facilitation.These data provide evidence that preparations of 
soluble tau containing either monomer- or fibril-derived assemblies disrupt LTP 
and LTD via different mechanisms. Intriguingly, when oTau and SτAs were applied 
together, LTD block predominated. Thus, if similar synaptotoxic soluble tau 
assemblies are present together later during the disease process, as seems 
likely, inhibition of synaptic weakening processes is predicted to predominate. 
Equally, reducing TNFα would be expected to be more effective when the 
monomer-derived soluble tau assemblies are the dominant synaptotoxic species. We 
conclude that oTau and SτAs provide useful means to explore ways of targeting 
different synaptotoxic soluble tau species in tauopathies.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of 
amyloid beta-42 (Aβ-42) in the brain, causing various adverse effects. Thus, 
therapies that reduce Aβ-42 toxicity in AD are of great interest. One promising 
approach is to use extracellular vesicles from human induced pluripotent stem 
cell-derived neural stem cells (hiPSC-NSC-EVs) because they carry multiple 
therapeutic miRNAs and proteins capable of protecting neurons against 
Aβ-42-induced toxicity. Therefore, this in vitro study investigated the 
proficiency of hiPSC-NSC-EVs to protect human neurons from Aβ-42 oligomers 
(Aβ-42o) induced neurodegeneration.
METHODS: We isolated hiPSC-NSC-EVs using chromatographic methods and 
characterized their size, ultrastructure, expression of EV-specific markers and 
proficiency in getting incorporated into mature human neurons. Next, mature 
human neurons differentiated from two different hiPSC lines were exposed to 1 µM 
Aβ-42o alone or with varying concentrations of hiPSC-NSC-EVs. The protective 
effects of hiPSC-NSC-EVs against Aβ-42o-induced neurodegeneration, oxidative 
stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired autophagy, and tau phosphorylation 
were ascertained using multiple measures and one-way ANOVA with Newman-Keuls 
multiple comparisons post hoc tests.
RESULTS: A significant neurodegeneration was observed when human neurons were 
exposed to Aβ-42o alone. Neurodegeneration was associated with (1) elevated 
levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial superoxide, 
malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyls (PCs), (2) increased expression of 
proapoptotic Bax and Bad genes and proteins, and genes encoding mitochondrial 
complex proteins, (3) diminished mitochondrial membrane potential and 
mitochondria, (4) reduced expression of the antiapoptotic gene and protein 
Bcl-2, and autophagy-related proteins, and (5) increased phosphorylation of tau. 
However, the addition of an optimal dose of hiPSC-NSC-EVs (6 × 109 EVs) to human 
neuronal cultures exposed to Aβ-42o significantly reduced the extent of 
neurodegeneration, along with diminished levels of ROS, superoxide, MDA and PCs, 
normalized expressions of Bax, Bad, and Bcl-2, and autophagy-related proteins, 
higher mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondria, enhanced expression of 
genes linked to mitochondrial complex proteins, and reduced tau phosphorylation.
CONCLUSIONS: An optimal dose of hiPSC-NSC-EVs could significantly decrease the 
degeneration of human neurons induced by Aβ-42o. The results support further 
research into the effectiveness of hiPSC-NSC-EVs in AD, particularly their 
proficiency in preserving neurons and slowing disease progression.

Alzheimer disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease of the brain 
due to extracellular accumulation of Aβ. In addition, intracellular accumulation 
of hyperphosphorlyated tau protein which form neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) is 
associated with progressive neuronal injury and the development of AD. Aβ and 
NFTs interact together to induce inflammation and oxidative stress which further 
induce neurodegeneration in AD. The exact relationship between Aβ and tau, the 
two proteins that accumulate within these lesions, has proven elusive. A growing 
body of work supports the notion that Aβ may directly or indirectly interact 
with tau to accelerate NFTs formation. Aβ can adversely affect distinct 
molecular and cellular pathways, thereby facilitating tau phosphorylation, 
aggregation, mislocalization, and accumulation. Aβ may drive tau pathology by 
activating specific kinases, providing a straightforward mechanism by which Aβ 
may enhance tau hyperphosphorylation and NFT formation. Many cellular signaling 
pathways such as protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), glycogen synthase kinase 3β 
(GSK3β), and phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) are intricate in AD 
neuropathology. PP2A which involved in the dephosphorylation of tau protein is 
deregulated in AD, and correlated with cognitive impairment. PTEN is a critical 
regulator of neuronal growth, survival, and development, improving synaptic 
plasticity and axonal regeneration. Nevertheless, mutated PTEN is associated 
with the development of cognitive impairment by inhibiting the expression and 
the activity of PP2A. Furthermore, dysregulation of GSK3β affects Aβ, tau 
protein phosphorylation, synaptic plasticity and other signaling pathways 
involved in the pathogenesis of AD. Therefore, there is a close interaction 
among GSK3β, PTEN, and PP2A. GSK3β exaggerates AD neuropathology by inhibiting 
PP2A and activates the expression of PTEN. These findings specified a related 
interaction among GSK3β, PTEN, and PP2A, and modulation of the single component 
of this axis may not produce an effective effect against AD neuropathology. 
Modulation of this axis by metformin and statins can reduce AD neuropathology. 
Therefore, this review aims to discuss the role of GSK3β/PTEN/PP2A axis in AD 
neuropathology and how targeting of this axis by metformin and statins can 
produce effective therapeutic strategy in the management of AD. In conclusion, 
inhibition of GSK3β and PTEN and activation of PP2A may be more suitable than 
modulation of single signaling pathway. Metformin and statins by activating PP2A 
and inhibiting of GSK3β and PTEN attenuate the development and progression of 
AD.

protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1). This study investigates the inhibitory 
potential of phytochemicals derived from Bacopa monnieri, a plant renowned for 
its cognitive-enhancing properties, in comparison to established synthetic 
inhibitors such as Atabecestat, Lanabecestat, and Verubecestat. Utilizing 
molecular docking and advanced computational simulations, we demonstrate that 
Bacopaside I exhibits superior binding affinity and a unique interaction profile 
with BACE1, suggesting a more nuanced inhibitory mechanism. Our findings 
highlight the promising role of Bacopa monnieri phytochemicals as viable 
alternatives to synthetic drugs, emphasizing their potential to overcome 
limitations faced in clinical settings. Furthermore, the development of the 
SIMANA ( https://simana.streamlit.app/ ) platform enhances the visualization and 
analysis of protein-ligand interactions, facilitating a deeper understanding of 
the dynamics involved. This research not only underscores the therapeutic 
promise of natural compounds in AD treatment but also advocates for a paradigm 
shift towards integrating traditional medicinal knowledge into contemporary drug 
discovery efforts.

The risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease increases with advancing age. 
Elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol and non-high-density 
lipoprotein (non-HDL)-cholesterol levels remain predictive of incident 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular events among individuals older than 75 years. 
Risk prediction among older individuals is less certain because most current 
risk calculators lack specificity in those older than 75 years and do not adjust 
for co-morbidities, functional status, frailty, and cognition which 
significantly impact prognosis in this age group. Data on the benefits and risks 
of lowering LDL-cholesterol with statins in older patients without 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease are also limited since most primary 
prevention trials have included mostly younger patients. Available data suggest 
that statin therapy in older primary prevention patients may reduce 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular events and that benefits from lipid-lowering with 
statins outweigh potential risks such as statin-associated muscle symptoms and 
incident type 2 diabetes mellitus. While some evidence suggests the possibility 
that statins may be associated with incident cognitive impairment in older 
adults, a preponderance of literature indicates neutral or even protective 
statin-related cognitive effects. Shared decision-making which is recommended 
for all patients when considering statin therapy is particularly important in 
older patients. Randomized clinical trial data evaluating the use of non-statin 
lipid-lowering therapy in older patients are sparse. Deprescribing of 
lipid-lowering agents may be appropriate for select patients older than 75 years 
with life-limiting diseases. Finally, a patient-centered approach should be 
taken when considering primary prevention strategies for older adults.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of aducanumab at its updated price 
for treating patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild Alzheimer's 
disease (AD).
DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis.
SETTINGS: A five-state Markov model was constructed using 10 000 virtual 
patients to assess the cost-effectiveness of aducanumab from the perspective of 
the US healthcare system. The model employed a one-year cycle time and a 
lifetime time horizon. Transition probabilities and mortality rates were derived 
from a literature review. To address uncertainty and generalise the base case 
results, both one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted.
PARTICIPANTS: 10 000 virtual patients with MCI and mild AD.
INTERVENTIONS: The study group consisted of patients using aducanumab, while the 
control group consisted of those using a placebo.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes included costs and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). In line with the healthcare system 
perspective, only direct medical costs were included. Drug costs were obtained 
from official records, while other medical costs were derived from literature 
reviews. Utilities used to calculate QALYs were also obtained from the 
literature. Incremental analysis was conducted to assess cost-effectiveness in 
the base case analysis by comparing the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) against the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold. A discount rate of 3% was 
applied to both costs and effectiveness.
RESULTS: From the perspective of the US healthcare system, compared with the 
control group, the study group had an incremental cost of US$143 821.1 and an 
incremental QALY of 0.10. The ICER of patients using aducanumab compared with 
those using placebo was US$1 012 219.0 per QALY gained, which was much greater 
than the WTP threshold of US$50 000 to US$150 000, indicating that using 
aducanumab was not cost-effective. One-way sensitivity analysis showed the five 
most sensitive parameters were relative risk of progressing from MCI to mild AD, 
the utility of MCI, initial age, discount rate and the price of aducanumab. In 
the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, when the WTP was the WTP threshold of 
US$150 000, the probability of aducanumab being cost-effective was 0%. In 
addition, when the probability of aducanumab being cost-effective was 50%, the 
WTP was US$1 180 000, and when the probability of aducanumab being 
cost-effective was 95%, the WTP was US$1 906 000.
CONCLUSIONS: Even with the updated price being half of the original, aducanumab 
is still not cost-effective, underscoring the need for affordable, 
evidence-based AD treatments.

In this scoping review, we examine the role of wearable devices in diagnosing, 
treating, and monitoring Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI). It identifies various devices, including fitness trackers, smartwatches, 
electroencephalographic equipment, and sensors, which are used for monitoring 
physical activity, sleep patterns, and cognitive functions. Our review 
highlights the potential of these devices for early diagnosis and treatment, 
improving patient autonomy and quality of life. However, challenges, such as 
data privacy, device adherence, and technical limitations, remain. Future 
research should focus on integrating wearable devices with advanced diagnostic 
tools and validating their effectiveness across diverse populations.

BACKGROUND: The study aimed to evaluate Plumbagin's neuroprotective potential 
against scopolamine-induced Alzheimer's disease, proposing that its effects may 
involve GSK-3β inhibition, a key factor in tau hyperphosphorylation, to promote 
neuroprotection in Wistar rats.
METHODS: Alzheimer's was induced in male Wistar rats. After acclimatization, the 
rats were subjected to daily intraperitoneal treatment with scopolamine 
(0.7 mg/kg) and oral administration of Plumbagin (10 mg/kg) for 13 days. The 
cognitive function of treated rats was evaluated using the Morris water maze 
test, along with assessments of locomotor activity, acetylcholinesterase 
activity (AChE), protein levels, antioxidant parameters, cytokines and 
Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and brain histopathology (hippocampus).
RESULTS: The Plumbagin (10 mg/kg, oral) as given orally significantly improved 
neurobehavioral alterations compared to Alzheimer's induced group. Scopolamine 
impaired cognitive function and increased locomotor activity (#P < 0.05). 
Treatments improved Morris water maze performance, reducing Escape latency time 
and increasing Time spent in the target quadrant (*P < 0.05). Biochemically, 
treatments significantly improved BDNF (*P < 0.05), decreased AChE activity, 
oxidative stress, reduced Interleukin-6 and Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha 
(*P < 0.05) and reversed Scopolamine induced hippocampal neuronal loss 
(##P < 0.01). Plumbagin showed significant (*P < 0.05) neuroprotective effects, 
improving cognitive function, reducing AChE activity, Malondialdehyde, oxidative 
stress, and neuroinflammatory markers exceeding individual treatments in the 
scopolamine-induced Alzheimer's disease model. These improvements suggest a 
possible mechanism through the inhibition of GSK-3β, which may contribute to the 
observed neuroprotective effects.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that Plumbagin's neuroprotective effects in 
scopolamine-induced Alzheimer's disease may involve GSK-3β inhibition. Plumbagin 
shows significant therapeutic potential for Alzheimer's treatment, warranting 
further investigation of its mechanism.

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is a progressive neurological 
disorder characterized by normal intracranial pressure, ventriculomegaly, gait 
disturbances, cognitive impairment, and urinary dysfunction, with an unknown 
etiology and predominantly affecting elderly populations. iNPH frequently 
coexists with Alzheimer disease (AD), and differentiating dementia-subtype iNPH 
from AD remains clinically challenging. In this review, we demonstrate that 
cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers may aid differential diagnosis, correlate with 
cognitive impairment, and predict shunt surgery outcomes. The cerebrospinal 
fluid biomarkers investigated include AD-associated markers (amyloid-β and tau 
proteins). Our analysis integrates bibliometric methodologies to map research 
trends. Advancements in understanding amyloid-β and tau pathology may offer 
novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for iNPH.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease 
affecting upper and lower motor neurons. Neurodegeneration in ALS might be 
driven by proteotoxicity or neuroinflammation, which have also been proposed to 
be promoted by toxic components of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We 
investigated the possible toxicity of ALS CSF on healthy induced pluripotent 
stem cells (iPSC)-derived integrated, inducible, and isogenic lower motor 
neurons (i3LMNs). CSFs were obtained from ALS patients homozygous for the risk 
UNC13A rs12608932 single nucleotide polymorphism (CC) and for the corresponding 
major allele (AA), ALS patients with C9ORF72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion, 
and individuals affected by normal pressure hydrocephalus as non-disease 
controls (ND). A chronic and low-dose sodium arsenite (ARS) treatment was used 
as positive control of oxidative stress. We found that 10 % ALS CSF treatment 
for 48 h was not sufficient to induce significant alterations in viability, 
autophagic flux, axonal degeneration, DNA damage, and Golgi apparatus integrity 
in healthy i3LMNs, in contrast to ARS treatment. Only UNC13A CC CSF 
significantly increased protein aggregation and Golgi apparatus fragments 
dimension. RNA-sequencing revealed that all ALS and ND CSFs induced expression 
changes of few genes, while chronic ARS deregulated the expression of thousands 
of genes, mostly involved in inflammation and synapse biology. In this work, we 
demonstrated that in our experimental settings only CSF from UNC13A CC patients 
induced some ALS-associated pathological features in healthy i3LMNs. Further 
studies will be required to elucidate the mechanistic link between the risk 
UNC13A genotype and CSF composition and toxicity.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate whether the biomarkers 
neuron-specific enolase (NSE), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), 
neurofilament light chain (NfL), and tau (total [t] and brain-derived [BD]) are 
elevated in plasma preoperatively; if there is a dynamic biomarker response to 
surgery; and if the biomarker levels are related to long-term outcome in chronic 
subdural hematomas (CSDHs).
METHODS: Eighty-five CSDH patients surgically treated between 2022 and 2023 at 
Uppsala University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden, were included in this prospective, 
observational study. NSE, GFAP, NfL, t-tau, and BD-tau were evaluated in plasma 
pre- and postoperatively (6-24 hours after surgery) and in the CSDH fluid. 
Health-related quality of life was evaluated using the 5-level EQ-5D (EQ-5D-5L) 
at 6 months postoperatively.
RESULTS: GFAP, NfL, and tau levels decreased after CSDH surgery (p < 0.02). NSE 
and BD-tau levels also decreased, but not significantly. Older age and larger 
CSDH volume were associated with higher preoperative GFAP, NfL, and BD-tau 
levels (p < 0.05). Higher preoperative values and greater dynamics (Δ 
[postoperative value - preoperative value]) of GFAP, NfL, and BD-tau correlated 
significantly with worse levels of several EQ-5D-5L domains (p < 0.05). A higher 
preoperative NfL level in plasma was independently associated with a lower 
EQ-5D-5L visual analog scale score (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Surgical CSDH patients exhibit ongoing central nervous system 
cellular injury, demonstrated via increased fluid biomarkers for brain injury 
preoperatively, which immediately improved after surgery and was strongly 
related to long-term outcome. The extent of preoperative biomarker elevation 
could aid in the decision-making for surgical indication and urgency.

IMPORTANCE: Subjective report of cognitive and functional decline from 
participant-study partner dyads can efficiently assess risk of cognitive 
impairment and clinical progression. Accuracy of self-report subjective 
cognitive decline may be limited by lack of awareness about one's own cognitive 
abilities in adults with MCI and dementia, and the extent to which discordance 
between self- and study partner-report is associated with diagnosis of cognitive 
impairment is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between discordance between self- and 
study partner-reported cognitive and/or functional decline and MCI diagnosis.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multisite, cross-sectional study used 
baseline data from 2 longitudinal, observational studies. A total of 921 
participant-study partner dyads enrolled in the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) from December 2016 to July 2022, and 279 dyads enrolled in the 
Brain Health Registry Electronic Validation of Online Methods Study (eVAL) from 
January 2020 to July 2023 were included.
EXPOSURES: Participants and study partners completed the Everyday Cognition 
Scale (ECog). Participants completed a demographics survey and the Geriatric 
Depression Scale-Short Form (GDS).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The model selection procedure in ADNI identified 
variables, which were included in a model that was externally validated in the 
eVAL cohort. The primary outcome was MCI vs cognitively unimpaired (CU) among 
participants.
RESULTS: ADNI participants (921 dyads) had a mean (SD) age of 71 (7) years and 
mean (SD) of 17 (3) years of education; 485 (53%) were female, 30 (3%) were 
Asian, 105 (11%) were Black, and 756 (82%) were White. eVAL participants (279 
dyads) had a mean (SD) age of 71 (8) years and mean (SD) of 17 (2) years of 
education; 151 (54%) were female, 17 (6%) were Asian, 12 (4%) were Black, and 
245 (88%) were White. The model distinguished CU vs MCI in the validation cohort 
with an area under the curve of 0.87 (95% CI, 0.88-0.96), sensitivity of 0.50 
(95% CI, 0.49-0.80), and specificity of 0.97 (95% CI, 0.95-0.99) based on a 
regression model. The model included 4 discordance metrics, participant 
demographics (gender, age, and education), study partner demographics (gender 
and cohabitation), and depressive symptoms (GDS score).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study of 1200 dyads, measures 
of ECog score discordance helped distinguish CU from MCI individuals with high 
specificity. Participant and study partner agreement on lack of observed changes 
in the participant was associated with lower likelihood of MCI, highlighting the 
value of dyadic discordance metrics for ruling out MCI in diverse settings.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is primarily caused by abnormal protein accumulation, 
such as β-amyloid plaques and tau tangles, leading to neuronal damage via 
oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, synaptic dysfunction, and progressive brain 
atrophy. It is crucial to address and explore alternative therapeutic 
candidates. Based on traditional reports, the present study investigates the 
phytochemicals presented in Benincasa hispida (Thunb.) Cogn. seeds and their 
potency against AD. Primarily, four different solvent systems have been used for 
crude extraction, and simultaneously 51 phytochemicals (BH_P1-BH_P51) have been 
selected through chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for further study. 
Five putative AD-associated targets, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), 
butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), serotonin 
transporter (SERT), and D2 dopamine receptor (DRD2), were used to explore the 
individual therapeutic efficacy in the form of docking score using the PyRx 
0.8-AutoDock 4.2 platform. According to the docking score (kcal/mol), BH_P19, 
BH_P20, BH_P30, BH_P18/BH_P31, and BH_P17 are promising ones. Furthermore, the 
drug-likeness profiles and ligand stability with AChE for 100 nanoseconds in the 
molecular dynamics simulation study revealed that BH_P19 was the lead 
therapeutic candidate among all. Overall, the integration of spectral techniques 
and computational investigations together highlights and encourages the 
exploration of natural regimens for AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that has 
been strongly associated with changes in corticoid receptor function and HPA 
axis dysregulation. This review gives an overview of the complex role of GC and 
MC receptors in AD, especially how chronic exposure to elevated cortisol 
contributes to hippocampal degeneration, oxidative stress, and cognitive 
decline. Specific emphasis lies with cortisol, brought to the attention of 
neurotoxicity, and relates it to Cushing syndrome with chronic hyper-cortisolism 
simulating cognitive and structural impairments seen in AD. The impact of HPA 
axis over-activity in AD pathology is presented, demonstrating its contribution 
to neuro-inflammation and possible utilization as a biomarker for disease 
progression. This review further includes pharmacological strategies that 
modulate corticoid receptors for the reduction of GC-induced neurotoxicity and 
includes selective GR antagonists and MR agonists. Lifestyle modifications, 
which modulate HPA activity, are the other non-pharmacological approach to 
managing AD. Finally, novel drugs and interventions targeting the regulation of 
GC, anti-inflammatory pathways, as well as attenuation of oxidative stress are 
emerging strategies. Such a strategy implies that it is possible that receptor 
activity balance can delay or arrest AD progression.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Hypertension is the predominant modifiable cardiovascular 
risk factor. This cohort study assessed the association of risk with the 
percentage of time that the ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) is within the target 
range (PTTR) proposed by the 2024 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) 
guidelines for blood pressure (BP) management.
METHODS: In a person-level meta-analysis of 14 230 individuals enrolled in 14 
population cohorts, systolic and diastolic ABPs were combined to assess 24-h, 
daytime, and nighttime PTTR with thresholds for non-elevated ABP set at <115/65, 
<120/70, and <110/60 mmHg, respectively.
RESULTS: Median 24-h PTTR was 18% (interquartile range 5-33) corresponding to 
4.3 h (1.2-7.9). Over 10.9 years (median), deaths (N = 3117) and cardiovascular 
endpoints (N = 2265) decreased across increasing 24-h PTTR quartiles from 21.3 
to 16.1 and from 20.3 to 11.3 events per 1000 person-years. The standardized 
multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios for 24-h PTTR were 0.57 (95% confidence 
interval 0.46-0.71) for mortality and 0.30 (0.23-0.39) for cardiovascular 
endpoints. Analyses of daytime and nighttime ABP, cardiovascular mortality, 
coronary endpoints and stroke, and subgroups produced confirmatory results. The 
2024 ESC non-elevated 24-h PTTR, compared with the 2018 ESC/European Society of 
Hypertension non-hypertensive 24-h PTTR, shortened the interval required to 
reduce relative risk for adverse outcomes from 60% to 18% (14.4-4.3 h). Office 
BP, compared with 24-h PTTR, misclassified most participants with regard to BP 
control.
CONCLUSIONS: Longer time that ABP is within the 2024 ESC target range is 
associated with reduced adverse outcomes; PTTR derived from ABP refines risk 
prediction and compared with office BP avoids misclassification of individuals 
with regard to BP control.

Lipid droplets are ubiquitous yet distinct intracellular organelles that are 
gaining attention for their uses outside of energy storage. Their formation, 
role in the physiological function, and the onset of the pathology have been 
gaining attention recently. Their structure, synthesis, and turnover play 
dynamic roles in both lipodystrophy and neurodegeneration. Factors like 
development, aging, inflammation, and cellular stress regulate the synthesis of 
lipid droplets. The biogenesis of lipid droplets has a critical role in reducing 
cellular stress. Lipid droplets, in response to stress, sequester hazardous 
lipids into their neutral lipid core, preserving energy and redox balance while 
guarding against lipotoxicity. Thus, the maintenance of lipid droplet 
homeostasis in adipose tissue, CNS, and other body tissues is essential for 
maintaining organismal health. Insulin resistance, hypertriglyceridemia, and 
lipid droplet accumulation are the severe metabolic abnormalities that accompany 
lipodystrophy-related fat deficit. Accumulation of lipid droplets is detected in 
almost all neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, 
Huntington's, and Hereditary spastic paraplegia. Hence, the regulation of lipid 
droplets can be used as an alternative approach to the treatment of several 
diseases. The current review summarizes the structure, composition, biogenesis, 
and turnover of lipid droplets, with an emphasis on the factors responsible for 
the accumulation and importance of lipid droplets in lipodystrophy and 
neurodegenerative disease.
