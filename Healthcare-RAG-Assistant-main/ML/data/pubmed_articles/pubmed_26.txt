The most common form of dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severely 
debilitating neurodegenerative disorder that afflicts over 50 million people 
globally. Despite extensive its research using various animal models, nearly all 
promising AD treatments have failed in clinical trials. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) 
have recently emerged as a valuable alternative to traditional (rodent) models 
of AD, possessing conserved neurotransmitter systems and disease pathways with 
humans, as well as orthologs for key genes associated with neurodegenerative 
disease. Here, we review recent advances and applications of zebrafish to study 
the pathogenesis of AD, and discuss the advantages, limitations, and potential 
future directions of research utilizing zebrafish AD models. This paper is 
dedicated to the late Professor Mikhail I. Aghajanov (1939-2024), a prominent 
Armenian neurochemist and a true crusader for fundamental AD research.

PURPOSE: Falls and fall-related injuries are highly prevalent among older 
adults. Falls negatively impact functional independence and quality of life, and 
are associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Sleep 
disorders in the older adults are a common phenomenon, with sleep quality 
gradually deteriorating as age increases. Cognitive frailty(CF) refers to the 
presence of both physical frailty(PF) and mild cognitive impairment(MCI) without 
simultaneous diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease(AD) or other dementia. 
Epidemiological studies have confirmed the association between falls and sleep 
disorders, as well as CF. However, no studies have yet investigated the 
relationship between falls, sleep disorders and CF in hospitalized older adults 
with hypertension. Our study is to explore the relationship between falls and 
both sleep disorders and CF in hospitalized older adults with hypertension, 
providing a basis for fall prevention.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Demographic characteristics were collected from 
hypertensive patients aged 65 and above who were hospitalized in the Department 
of Geriatrics at Huaihe Hospital of Henan University, from July 2022 to June 
2024. These patients were assessed for history of falls, sleep quality, CF, 
depression and nutritional status. Logistic regression analysis was used to 
examine the correlation between falls and both sleep disorders and CF.
RESULTS: A total of 266 older adults with hypertension were surveyed in this 
study, of whom 108 reported having fallen once or more in the past year. Both 
sleep disorders and CF were significantly associated with an increased risk of 
falls (sleep disorders: OR=2.625, 95% CI 1.214-5.678, P=0.014; CF: OR=5.920, 95% 
CI 2.632-13.314, P<0.001). Other significant risk factors included: 
Age (OR=1.119, 95% CI 1.055-1.188, P<0.001), Comorbidities (OR=2.855, 95% CI 
1.353-6.024, P=0.006), Polypharmacy (OR=4.126, 95% CI 1.937-8.793, P<0.001), 
Compared to hospitalized older adults with hypertension with good nutritional 
status, those with malnutrition had a 4.698-fold higher risk of falls (95% CI 
1.724-12.800, P=0.002).
CONCLUSION: The incidence of falls was higher among hospitalized older adults 
with hypertension. Both sleep disorders and CF were strongly associated with 
falls in this patient population.

Promising therapeutic interventions that target the underlying pathophysiology 
are changing the landscape of Alzheimer's disease (AD) research. The AD care 
pathway must be transformed to meet the challenge of bringing these new 
therapies to the increasing number of people living with AD within the existing 
healthcare framework. Challenges include identifying patients who may benefit 
from treatment interventions early in the course of the disease, ensuring that 
diagnostic tools are accessible and accurate, and developing capabilities to 
monitor the effectiveness of interventions over time. These challenges must be 
addressed at all levels, from primary care settings to tertiary treatment 
centers; this will require collaborative efforts between health systems, drug 
manufacturers, and research institutions to navigate this evolving landscape and 
ensure system readiness for patients and their families with AD. The Spring 2024 
Alzheimer's Association Research Roundtable (AARR) meeting gathered industry 
representatives and clinicians to discuss insights, challenges, and solutions 
that will help researchers and health systems identify patients in the early 
stages of AD and deliver emerging therapies efficiently and safely. In this 
paper, we provide highlights from the Spring 2024 AARR meeting.

INTRODUCTION: Increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) release through 
physical activity (PA) is thought to underlie protective effects of PA on brain 
aging. The BDNF Val66Met single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs6265) reduces 
activity-dependent BDNF release and has been linked to early Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) pathology and cognition. We examined whether BDNF genotype influences the 
association of PA with plasma markers of AD, axonal degeneration, and 
neuroinflammation, along with consequences for cognition, in older adults 
without dementia.
METHODS: One hundred eighty older adults (Mage = 73.1; SDage = 9.1; 61% female; 
42% BDNF Met allele carriers) from the University of California San Francisco 
(UCSF) Memory and Aging Center completed 30 days of actigraphy monitoring, 
plasma assays of phosphorylated tau (p-tau181), neurofilament light chain (NfL), 
glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and BDNF Val66Met genotyping. One 
hundred twenty-three of the sample completed comprehensive neuropsychological 
evaluation. Habitual PA levels were operationalized via average daily step 
count. Composite z-scores were calculated for cognitive domains of memory and 
executive functioning.
RESULTS: BDNF genotype moderated the relationship between PA and plasma 
p-tau181, whereby higher PA was associated with lower plasma p-tau181 
concentration in Val/Val participants only. In moderated mediation analyses 
examining cognitive outcomes, plasma p-tau181 selectively mediated the 
relationship between PA and executive function in Val/Val participants. In 
analyses including sex as a biological factor, there was a three-way interaction 
of PA, BDNF genotype, and sex on plasma GFAP concentration, whereby higher PA 
was associated with lower plasma GFAP only in Val/Val male participants.
DISCUSSION: The Val/Val BDNF genotype may facilitate the neuroprotective 
relationships of PA, including lower AD-relevant biology and better executive 
function. We further show there may be a sex-specific negative relationship of 
PA with neuroinflammation in Val/Val males. These results further elucidate 
sources of individual variation observed in relationships between PA and brain 
health and will contribute to guiding personalized neurotrophic treatments for 
older adults.
HIGHLIGHTS: Higher physical activity (PA) is associated with lower 
phosphorylated tau (p-tau181) in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) 
Val66Met Val/Val carriers.In Val/Val carriers, p-tau181 mediated the association 
of PA and executive function.There was a negative association of PA and glial 
fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in Val/Val male, but not female 
participants.The neuroprotective benefits of PA may be more pronounced in BDNF 
Val/Val carriers.There may be a sex-specific PA pathway for neuroinflammation in 
Val/Val males.

INTRODUCTION: CT1812 (zervimesine) is an orally dosed modulator of the sigma-2 
receptor (S2R) currently in clinical development for the treatment of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). CT1812 has been shown in preclinical and early 
clinical trials to selectively prevent and displace binding of amyloid beta 
oligomers from their synaptic receptors and has improved cognitive function in 
animal models of AD.
METHODS: SEQUEL (NCT04735536) is a completed Phase 2, randomized, 
placebo-controlled 4-week crossover trial in adults with mild-to-moderate AD 
that investigated the effect of CT1812 on safety, synaptic function using 
quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG), and biomarkers. CT1812 improved 
established qEEG markers of spontaneous brain activity, suggesting improved 
neuronal and synaptic function. In the present study, cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF)-based tandem mass tag mass spectrometry (TMT-MS) was performed on 
participant samples to investigate proteomic effects and identify potential 
biomarkers of CT1812.
RESULTS: Biomarkers found through proteomics analyses to be significantly 
differentially abundant in CT1812- versus placebo-treated participants supported 
pathway engagement and proof of mechanism for CT1812. Impacted proteins support 
a role for CT1812 at synapses, in vesicle trafficking, and in lipoprotein 
biology. Biomarkers correlated with the previously reported improvements in 
qEEG-based functional connectivity (inferred through alpha band Amplitude 
Envelope Correlations) with CT1812 treatment were also identified and may be 
potential early surrogate biomarkers of efficacy for CT1812. The processes and 
functions supported by biomarkers were congruent with those previously revealed 
in CSF proteomics analyses from phase 1 and 2 AD clinical trials with CT1812.
DISCUSSION: After 1 month of treatment, the identification of biomarkers 
supporting pathway engagement, the replication of biomarker findings from prior 
trials, and the discovery of molecular correlates of improved functional 
connectivity with CT1812 treatment bolster support for and expound upon the 
mechanism of action for CT1812 in displacing Aβ oligomers at neuronal synapses, 
as well as underscores the CT1812 relevance to AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: Exploratory proteomics identified candidate CSF biomarkers of CT1812 
in SEQUEL.Molecular correlates of functional brain connectivity (qEEG) were 
identified.Proteins impacted by 1 month CT1812 treatment support target 
engagement.Pharmacodynamic changes found in synapse, immune, vesicle, and 
lipoprotein biologies.SEQUEL proteomics findings replicated previous trial 
findings with CT1812.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by cognitive decline, memory impairment, and the accumulation of 
pathological markers such as amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. 
Recent evidence suggests a role for dysregulated iron metabolism in the 
pathogenesis of AD, although the precise molecular mechanisms remain largely 
undefined.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: To address the role of iron metabolism in AD, we utilized 
an integrative bioinformatics approach that combines weighted gene co-expression 
network analysis (WGCNA) with machine learning techniques, including LASSO 
regression and Generalized Linear Models (GLM), to identify hub genes associated 
with AD. We used transcriptomic data derived from postmortem prefrontal cortex 
samples (GSE132903, comprising 97 AD cases and 98 controls). To assess changes 
in the immune microenvironment, single-sample gene set enrichment analysis 
(ssGSEA) was employed. Furthermore, pathway enrichment analysis and gene set 
variation analysis (GSVA) were performed to uncover the underlying biological 
mechanisms driving these alterations. Protein validation was carried out in 
APP/PS1 transgenic mice through Western blotting.
RESULTS: Three genes related to iron metabolism-MAP4, GPT, and HIRIP3-are 
identified as strong biomarkers. The GLM classifier showed high diagnostic 
accuracy (AUC=0.879). AD samples had increased immune activity, with more M1 
macrophages and neutrophils, indicating neuroinflammation. MAP4 and GPT were 
linked to Notch signaling and metabolic issues. In APP/PS1 mice, MAP4 decreased, 
while GPT and HIRIP3 increased.
DISCUSSION: This analysis highlights these genes as diagnostic biomarkers and 
therapeutic targets, connecting iron balance, neuroinflammation, and metabolic 
problems in AD. The immune profile suggests potential for immunomodulatory 
treatments, enhancing understanding of AD and aiding precision diagnostics and 
therapies.

PURPOSE: Various neuropsychological or cognitive assessments are often conducted 
before rehabilitation to ascertain patients' function, disability, and 
environment. However, adequate assessments are not conducted for persons with 
dementia under the assumption that assessments would burden them. Therefore, 
this study investigated the perceptions of persons with dementia and their 
family caregivers regarding cognitive function assessments during hospital 
rehabilitation and reconsidered the significance of such assessments according 
to the opinions of those involved.
METHODS: This cross-sectional observational study was conducted over a 3-month 
period at a hospital-based rehabilitation center. We administered a 
semi-structured questionnaire to 31 older persons with dementia (13 men and 18 
women; mean age [± SD]: 77 [± 5.7] (range: 66-87 years); mean years of education 
[± SD]: 12 [± 2.3]; (range: 9-16 years); Alzheimer's disease: 15; mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI): 15; corticobasal degeneration: 1) and 49 family caregiver 
dyads (24 men and 25 women, mean age [± SD]: 67 [± 11] years; age range: 46-90 
years). The data were interpreted by employing descriptive statistics, and the 
χ2, Fisher's exact, and Kruskal-Wallis tests.
FINDINGS: Both groups acknowledged the value of neuropsychological assessments, 
with 94% (95% CI 84.9-100%) of persons with MCI/dementia and 83% (95% CI 
73.3-94.0%) of their family caregivers linking them directly to enhanced 
treatment and care quality. Their positive attitudes were significantly 
associated with the belief that such evaluations are integral for personalizing 
and optimizing rehabilitation strategies.
IMPLICATIONS: Most individuals with MCI/dementia and their caregivers value 
detailed neuropsychological assessments for understanding rehabilitation needs, 
highlighting the importance of integrating comprehensive evaluations into 
dementia care. However, the single-center nature of our study limits 
generalizability. Future research with diverse participants is needed to develop 
scalable, inclusive rehabilitation strategies.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disease leading to dementia, lacks 
a single definitive diagnosis. While current medications only manage symptoms, 
the ideal treatment would restore cognition. Traditional therapies targeting 
beta-amyloid haven't yielded significant results, while new approaches target 
tau protein tangles, protein degradation pathways, inflammation, and 
neurotrophic factor depletion. Autophagy, a cellular degradation and recycling 
process, has emerged as a crucial hallmark and contributor to the pathogenesis 
of AD. Notably, autophagy induction has emerged as a promising therapeutic 
approach, with inducers like celastrol and caudatin promoting the degradation of 
toxic protein aggregates. Additionally, innovative drug formulations, such as 
nanoparticles, are being explored for targeted drug delivery. Research is 
increasingly focusing on neuroinflammation and developing multi-targeted drugs 
to address various aspects of AD, potentially leading to preventive strategies 
in the early stages. This review summarizes the current state and emerging 
trends in AD drug development.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative 
condition that is influenced by multiple factors along with neuroinflammation 
and oxidative stress. Our previous study proved that Lithocarpus polystachyus 
Rehd. aqueous extract (sweet tea aqueous extract, STAE) effectively inhibits 
hydrogen peroxide-induced neuronal cell injury. However, it is not clear whether 
STAE can protect against AD, and its underlying mechanisms are still uncertain. 
Therefore, the present study was designed to evaluate the possible behavioral 
and neurochemical effects of STAE on Aβ 25-35-induced AD rats administered STAE 
(20, 40, 80 mg/mL) for 14 days. We showed that STAE administration significantly 
and dose-dependently ameliorated the cognitive deficits in the AD rat models, 
assessed in the Morris water maze (MWM) test, Y-maze test, and novel object 
recognition (NOR) test. The results of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and 
Nissl staining showed that after treatment with STAE, the pathological damage to 
the hippocampal CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus (DG) neurons of rats was 
significantly improved. Furthermore, STAE dose-dependently inhibited microglia 
and astrocyte activation in the hippocampus of rats accompanied by increased 
protein expression of silent mating-type information regulation 2 homolog 6 
(SIRT6) and decreased protein expression of nod-like receptor thermal protein 
domain-associated protein 3 (NLRP3) and its downstream pyroptosis-related genes 
after following Aβ 25-35. In summary, our findings indicate that STAE 
effectively inhibits Aβ 25-35-induced learning and memory impairment in rats, 
and the mechanism is, at least partially, related to the regulation of 
SIRT6/NLRP3 signaling pathway.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), a primary neurodegenerative disorder, is characterized 
by amyloid-β plaques and tau hyperphosphorylation-induced neurofibrillary 
tangles. Current treatments only alleviate symptoms, and Aβ monoclonal 
antibodies raise safety concerns in clinical use. Natural components (NCs) of 
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) (eg, curcumin, quercetin, berberine, 
resveratrol) exhibit multi-target neuroprotective effects in AD, but poor 
blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration and low bioavailability limit clinical 
use. Recent strategies to enhance TCM delivery include NP-based nanoparticle 
(NP) drug delivery systems (NDDS), structural modifications, and combination 
therapies. NDDS demonstrate superior performance in enabling brain-targeting 
delivery via passive (paracellular/transcellular) and active 
(adsorption-/receptor-/carrier-mediated transcytosis) approaches, improving NCs' 
stability, controlled release, and bioavailability. With NCs of TCM delivery via 
NDDS, it is possible to develop intelligent therapeutic systems that combine 
multi-target regulation with precise drug delivery. This review summarizes the 
diverse neuroprotective effects of NCs of TCM in AD treatment and discusses the 
commonly used types of NPs for AD therapy. It particularly focuses on these NCs 
of TCM delivery via NDDS, covering aspects such as NPs types, fabrication 
techniques, characteristics, administration routes, and advantages. Finally, the 
challenges and potential solutions for NCs of TCM were examined, along with 
comparative advantages and limitations among different NPs and future research 
directions. Collectively, NCs of TCM delivery via NDDS demonstrate promising 
therapeutic potential for AD treatment.

Dementia is a progressive neurodegenerative condition, primarily caused by 
Alzheimer's disease, predominantly affecting elderly individuals. Under these 
circumstances, dementia care focuses on assisting patients with daily living, 
either in nursing facilities or at home. The condition imposes substantial 
economic burdens on patients, caregivers, and healthcare systems, particularly 
in Europe and North America, where precise cost assessments are essential. This 
review examines the economic impact of dementia care by integrating diverse cost 
estimation sources to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of preventive care for 
high-risk individuals and providing meta-analytic estimates of annual medical, 
non-medical, and informal care costs per patient, and compares these costs with 
care effectiveness. The analysis focuses on Europe and the United States, with a 
greater emphasis on Europe, aiming to encourage further research on preventive 
strategies and caregiver support. Dementia presents a significant economic 
challenge globally, driven by rising healthcare costs and an aging population. 
The disparities between direct and indirect costs in the US and Europe highlight 
the impact of healthcare systems and cultural practices on dementia care costs. 
Preventive measures could significantly reduce long-term treatment costs, making 
them a crucial investment to alleviate future financial burdens.

Cognitive impairment, a prevalent neurological disorder characterized by 
multisystem dysregulation within the nervous system, has prompted substantial 
scientific inquiry into complementary therapies. This scientometric 
investigation systematically examines the evolving bilingual (Chinese-English) 
research paradigm of acupuncture interventions for cognitive impairment through 
comparative analysis of 510 publications from the China National Knowledge 
Infrastructure (CNKI) and 633 articles from Web of Science Core Collection, 
processed via CiteSpace 6.4.R2. Our multidimensional analysis reveals three 
principal dimensions: (1) Spatiotemporal evolution demonstrating that scholarly 
contributions in this domain are predominantly clustered within China. 
Longitudinal bibliometric analysis demonstrates sustained scholarly productivity 
in this domain, with annual bilingual (Chinese-English) publication outputs 
consistently exceeding 40 peer-reviewed articles per annum throughout the 
2000-2025 observation window, establishing a robust baseline for continuous 
knowledge advancement; (2) Network analysis atlas of the research institutions 
and authors reveals that both research output density and institutional 
affiliations concentrated in Chinese academic hubs and most authors come from 
China; (3) Divergent thematic trajectories between linguistic cohorts - Chinese 
studies emphasize vascular mechanisms, oxidative stress modulation, and 
pharmacological synergies, whereas English literature prioritizes gut-brain axis 
interactions, postoperative cognitive recovery, and neuroinflammatory pathways. 
These findings provide evidence-based insights into acupuncture's therapeutic 
mechanisms in cognitive impairment while establishing a conceptual framework to 
guide future translational studies and clinical protocol optimization in 
integrative neurology.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by cognitive decline and behavioral disturbances. Buyang Huanwu 
Decoction (BYHWD), a traditional Chinese herbal formulation, has demonstrated 
potential neuroprotective effects. This study aims to evaluate the therapeutic 
impact of BYHWD on cognitive impairments in 3×Tg mice and to investigate its 
underlying mechanism through modulation of the gut microbiota-C/EBPβ/AEP 
signaling pathway.
METHODS: In two independent experiments, we assessed the effects of BYHWD and 
its derived fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT-BYHWD) on behavioral 
performance, neuropathological alterations, and signaling pathways in 3×Tg mice.
RESULTS: Treatment with BYHWD significantly improved cognitive function in 3×Tg 
mice and mitigated AD-like pathological changes. By suppressing the C/EBPβ/AEP 
signaling pathway, BYHWD reduced pathological Aβ plaque deposition, diminished 
tau hyperphosphorylation, and inhibited the release of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines. Further analysis revealed that BYHWD restored gut microbiota balance 
and suppressed the activation of the C/EBPβ/AEP pathway in the hippocampus. 
Moreover, transplanting FMT-BYHWD from BYHWD-treated mice to germ-free 3×Tg mice 
also ameliorated their cognitive deficits and AD-like pathology, suggesting that 
the anti-AD effects of BYHWD are mediated through the gut-brain axis by 
regulating the interplay between gut microbiota and the C/EBPβ/AEP signaling 
pathway.
CONCLUSION: This study uncovers the mechanism by which BYHWD improves cognitive 
deficits and neuropathological changes in 3×Tg mice via the gut-brain axis, 
mediated by the modulation of the gut microbiota-C/EBPβ/AEP signaling pathway, 
providing a novel therapeutic strategy for AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a serious health condition that exacerbates with 
age. Among various AD biomarkers, the measurement of the Aβ 42/40 ratio (i.e., 
ratio of Aβ 42 and Aβ 40 concentrations) has garnered prominence for the early 
identification of AD patients and the development of disease-modifying 
treatments. Approaches such as positron emission tomography examinations and 
biomarker measurements in cerebrospinal fluid and blood plasma face constraints 
related to expense and procedural complexity. To address these issues, we 
developed and evaluated the efficacy of a portable platform for detecting 
amyloid beta (Aβ) 40 and 42 in plasma, utilizing photooxidation-induced 
fluorescence amplification (PIFA). We conducted a comparative analysis of Aβ 
42/40 measurements between the PIFA and single-molecule immunoassay (SiMoA) 
platforms. By measuring 38 cases of subjective cognitive decline (SCD), 24 cases 
of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and 46 cases of AD dementia 
samples, we observed a significant difference in Aβ 42/40 ratios between the SCD 
and aMCI groups. The PIFA platform demonstrated an area under the curve compared 
to that of the SiMoA platform, which is currently the most precise method for Aβ 
42/40 ratio measurement. Consequently, the PIFA platform presents a viable 
cost-effective tool for detecting the Aβ 42/40 ratio.

BackgroundAmyloid aggregation of α-Synuclein is a defining feature of several 
neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD), Lewy body 
dementia (LBD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). While there have been many 
attempts to reduce the α-Synuclein burden of neuronal cells through direct 
targeting of the protein, the conformationally dynamic nature of α-Synuclein 
make it a particularly difficult target to drug. Given the correlation between 
α-Synuclein levels and both familial and environmentally induced 
synucleinopathies, targeting the α-Synuclein mRNA transcript offers an 
alternative therapeutic avenue.ObjectiveTo develop and evaluate protein-based 
RNA-binding therapeutics (PROTEIMERs) that selectively bind the 5' untranslated 
region (UTR) of α-Synuclein mRNA and inhibit its translation to reduce 
α-Synuclein levels.MethodsWe employed high-throughput phage display to identify 
novel RNA-binding PROTEIMER candidates targeting the 5'UTR of α-Synuclein mRNA. 
Binding affinities were assessed via surface plasmon resonance (SPR). 
Computational structural predictions were used to evaluate PROTEIMER-RNA 
interactions relative to known regulatory proteins IRP1 and IRP2. RNase domains 
were fused to the lead PROTEIMERs, and their RNA degradation activity was tested 
in vitro.ResultsThree PROTEIMERs were identified that bind the α-Synuclein 5'UTR 
with high affinity. Structural predictions supported specific interactions with 
the structured RNA region. RNase-fused PROTEIMERs demonstrated targeted RNA 
degradation and induced decay of α-Synuclein mRNA in vitro, indicating 
translational suppression capability.ConclusionsOur findings demonstrate the 
feasibility of using engineered protein therapeutics to target α-Synuclein mRNA 
via the 5'UTR. These PROTEIMERs represent a promising new strategy for reducing 
α-Synuclein levels and mitigating neurodegenerative progression in LBD, PD, and 
AD.

BackgroundAlzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized 
by pathogenesis involving numerous factors. Recent research has highlighted the 
significant role of autoimmunity in the initiation and progression of AD, with 
autoantibodies emerging as a pivotal area of investigation. Nevertheless, the 
influence of autoantibodies in AD is marked by substantial heterogeneity, they 
may either mitigate disease progression by clearing pathogenic protein 
aggregates or exacerbate the pathological process through mechanisms such as the 
activation of inflammatory responses or the induction of neuronal 
damage.ObjectiveThis review aims to synthesize the various roles of 
autoantibodies in AD, examine the factors that influence their functions, and 
assess their potential application in precision immunotherapy.MethodsPubMed and 
Web of Science databases were searched for English-language papers (2015-2025). 
Peer-reviewed human, animal and cell studies, systematic reviews and 
meta-analyses were screened independently by two reviewers.ResultsA total of 87 
studies were selected for inclusion, spanning human, animal, and cellular 
research. The findings indicated that certain autoantibodies, such as those 
targeting amyloid-β, tau, or 4-hydroxynonenal, may confer neuroprotective 
effects. Conversely, other autoantibodies, including those against BACE1, 
aquaporin-4, or HuD, may exacerbate AD pathology. Importantly, some 
autoantibodies were found to exhibit dual roles, contingent upon their specific 
modifications or the context of the disease.ConclusionsAutoantibodies constitute 
a double-edged immune axis in AD. Their impact hinges on antigen class, disease 
stage, isotype affinity and glycosylation. Precision strategies-like CAAR-T cell 
therapy, glycosylation modulation, and affinity optimization-offer therapeutic 
promise but require further validation.

INTRODUCTION: We compared visual assessments and quantification methods for tau 
positron emission tomography (PET) staging and evaluated plasma biomarkers and 
cognitive trajectories across amyloid and tau (AT) staging.
METHODS: Tau PET scans from 289 Korea-Registries to Overcome Dementia and 
Accelerate Dementia Research (K-ROAD) participants were analyzed visually and 
quantitatively, with validation in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) cohort (n = 870). Plasma biomarkers and cognitive measures 
were evaluated across AT stages.
RESULTS: FreeSurfer without partial volume correction (PVC) achieved the highest 
area under the curve (AUC) for tau positivity (0.918), based on visual 
interpretation. The temporal meta-region excelled in moderate tau staging 
(AUC = 0.856), while the temporoparietal region performed best for advanced 
staging (AUC = 0.828). Quantification methods detected phosphorylated tau217 
changes during intermediate transitions (e.g., A+/T- to A+/Tmod+) more 
effectively. Plasma biomarkers and cognitive measures progressively changed 
across AT stages, with consistent results in K-ROAD and ADNI cohorts.
DISCUSSION: The complementary strengths of visual and quantification methods 
enhance tau PET staging by effectively capturing biomarker changes and cognitive 
trajectories.
HIGHLIGHTS: Quantification partially outperformed visual assessments in 
detecting early tau burdens. Meta-temporal and temporoparietal regions of 
interest excelled in early and late tau staging. Quantification methods 
correlated with plasma phosphorylated tau217 and cognitive decline. Findings 
were validated across two independent cohorts (Korea-Registries to Overcome 
Dementia and Accelerate Dementia Research and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative). The study highlights the complementary roles of visual and 
quantification methods.

INTRODUCTION: In EMERGE (NCT02484547), participants receiving aducanumab had 
significantly less progression versus placebo on all prespecified clinical 
endpoints at week 78. Here, we explicate the clinical meaningfulness of these 
treatment effects by analyzing item-level data and the persistence of treatment 
benefit.
METHODS: Participants with early Alzheimer's disease (AD) were stratified by 
apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 status and randomized (1:1:1) to receive low- or 
high-dose aducanumab, or placebo. Prespecified principal component analyses 
(PCAs) per the Statistical Analysis Plan were followed by post hoc examination 
of individual domains/items across all five clinical endpoints. Progression 
analysis assessed reduction in clinical decline.
RESULTS: High-dose aducanumab demonstrated clinically meaningful slowing of 
progression across clinical endpoints measuring cognition, daily function, and 
behavioral symptoms. Delay of progression over 18 months was consistent across 
measures; treatment effects increased over time.
DISCUSSION: Across multiple analyses aducanumab slowed cognitive decline, 
prolonged functional independence, and attenuated behavioral symptoms in 
participants with early AD. These outcomes comprise the elements of a clinically 
meaningful response to treatment.
HIGHLIGHTS: Endpoints in EMERGE assessed different aspects of cognition, daily 
function, and behavioral symptoms. Treatment benefits were observed across 
subdomains on all five clinical endpoints. Aducanumab meaningfully slowed 
disease progression in participants with early AD.

Making outcome measures matter: Why should "what matters to people living with 
dementia" matter to dementia researchers?

This article provides an overview of evidence to support a call to action for 
dementia researchers to ensure that "what matters to people living with 
dementia" should be at the heart of any decision-making around the choices and 
design of outcome measures. There have been sufficient reviews observing how the 
outcome measures that have been used in previous research have not been those 
that have been valued by people living with dementia or their carers. If 
researchers continue to use existing measures that are not valued by people 
living with dementia, they will waste limited research resources by using 
measures that are not sufficiently sensitive to detect changes that might be 
attributed to interventions. It is time for researchers to collaborate 
internationally to ensure that resources are invested in designing and 
validating new approaches for measurement of psychosocial outcomes for those 
living with dementia. HIGHLIGHTS: Outcome measures that have been used in 
previous research have not been those that have been valued by people living 
with dementia or their carers. Existing outcome measures have been shown not to 
be fit for purpose and tend to focus on symptom reduction or broad 
conceptualizations of quality of life. Dementia researchers will need to 
collaborate internationally to ensure that resources are invested in designing 
and validating new approaches for measurement of psychosocial outcomes for those 
living with dementia.

Low-intensity ultrasound combined with microbubbles is a promising, non-invasive 
treatment strategy for enhancing vascular permeability and targeted 
intracellular drug or gene delivery. Following ultrasound insonification, cells 
can undergo reversible sonoporation, involving adaptation and recovery, or 
irreversible sonoporation, marked by a loss of cell viability. To design 
effective sonoporation-based therapeutic delivery strategies, it is critical to 
identify the biological responses that determine these distinct cell fates. 
Here, we developed a custom-built high-resolution multicolour imaging device and 
applied a single pulse of ultrasound (267 kHz frequency, 20 μs duration, 
and ∼110 kPa peak negative pressure) to trigger targeted microbubble-mediated 
reversible and irreversible sonoporation events within a confluent monolayer of 
cultured Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) II cells. We found that intracellular 
calcium levels rose rapidly and peaked within 10 s in both types of sonoporated 
cells, although the levels declined differently. In reversibly sonoporated 
cells, these levels gradually returned to baseline, whereas in irreversibly 
sonoporated cells, they dropped rapidly, falling well below baseline within 
7.9 ± 3.0 min (mean ± s.d.). Using single-vesicle imaging, we further found that 
vesicles containing the tight junction protein claudin-5 remained mobile with 
subtly reduced movement in reversibly sonoporated cells, whereas they almost 
stalled in irreversibly sonoporated cells. The underlying microtubule network 
was partially disrupted in the reversibly sonoporated cells, recovering fully 
within 3.2 ± 2.9 min (mean ± s.d.). In contrast, in irreversibly sonoporated 
cells, the entire microtubule network collapsed within 4.0 ± 2.4 min 
(mean ± s.d.). Whilst in reversibly sonoporated cells, the uptake of the model 
drug propidium iodide was mild-to-moderate, without drastic cell size changes up 
to about 1 h post-sonication, irreversibly sonoporated cells presented with 
substantially higher propidium iodide uptake and completely shrank within 
43.2 ± 10.5 min (mean ± s.d.). Together, our study identified distinct 
spatiotemporal sequences of interconnected biological responses underlying the 
different fates of sonoporated cells, providing a framework for identifying 
processes that could be manipulated for safe and effective sonoporation-based 
drug delivery.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative 
disorders and substantially impacts cognitive health and quality of life. Qingke 
β-glucan (Q) and its combination with Lactobacillus (Q&P) demonstrated a notable 
ability to alleviate anxiety behaviors and improve cognitive and learning memory 
deficits in APP/PS1 mice, a widely used model for AD. Q&P effectively reduced 
amyloid-β accumulation and Tau phosphorylation, protecting neurons from 
degeneration. Additionally, it increased the mRNA expression of BDNF and SYP, 
reduced synaptic damage, and suppressed neuroinflammation by decreasing the mRNA 
levels of IL-6, IL-17 A, and IL-22. Q&P also activated the Nrf2 signaling 
pathway, enhanced SOD activity, mitigated oxidative damage, and restored gut 
microbiota dysbiosis. Metabolomic and 16S rRNA sequencing analyses revealed 
significant modulation of the intestinal microbiome and metabolic pathways, with 
key roles identified for Lactobacillus, Muribaculum, Candidatus_Stoquefichus, 
and Coriobacteriaceae_UCG-002. These microbiota adjustments influence tryptophan 
and linoleic acid metabolism, contributing to reduced inflammation and oxidative 
stress and improving neuronal health. By enhancing the intestinal 
microenvironment and regulating metabolic and microbial profiles, Q&P offers a 
sustainable and effective approach for preventing cognitive decline and 
promoting overall brain health in AD patients.

As a sheddase, ADAM10 plays a critical role in various physiological and 
pathological processes because of its widespread distribution and proteolytic 
functions. Dysregulation of ADAM10 is associated with multiple diseases, 
including cancer. Despite significant research, a comprehensive synthesis of its 
structural characteristics, activation mechanisms, regulatory pathways, and 
involvement in disease remains lacking. This review provides an in-depth 
analysis of ADAM10, focusing on its molecular structure, mechanisms of 
activation and regulation, and roles in normal physiology and disease, 
particularly cancer. By elucidating ADAM10's interactions and pathways, this 
review aims to identify potential therapeutic targets and strategies to modulate 
its activity in disease contexts, offering insights for researchers and 
clinicians.

Human neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease 
are characterized by the formation and deposition of toxic protein species which 
exacerbate neuronal dysfunction, impacting the structure and function of the 
healthy brain. Deciphering the mechanisms underlying protein (mis)folding and 
aggregation is not only essential for a more coherent view of neurodegeneration, 
but also crucial for the development of novel therapeutics targeting this family 
of disorders. Key pathological drivers of neurodegeneration, such as 
alpha-synuclein and tau proteins, have traditionally proved extremely 
challenging to characterize structurally due to their intrinsic and widespread 
structural plasticity. Hydrogen-Deuterium eXchange Mass Spectrometry has emerged 
as a powerful tool to help circumvent this, owing to its ability to capture 
protein intrinsic disorder in solution, in addition to the transient structural 
conformations that typify protein aggregation pathways. This review brings 
together the most recent research where Hydrogen-Deuterium eXchange Mass 
Spectrometry has shed light on mechanisms of neurodegeneration. We highlight how 
the technique has been successfully integrated into therapeutic development 
workflows targeting some of the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases.

Neurodegenerative disorders (ND) are accompanied by neuronal death because of 
progressive destruction in neuronal structure and function. Due to various 
neurological conditions, there is a significant number of deaths every year 
around the world. The healthcare burden is also increasing each year. 
Development and progress in nanotechnology enable the creation of nanocarriers 
that transport drugs to the site of disease, thereby enhancing the therapeutic 
performance of the drug. However, the transport of nanocarrier-based 
therapeutics to the brain is restricted by barriers such as the Blood-Brain 
Barrier (BBB) and Blood-Cerebrospinal Fluid Barrier (BCFB), which are further 
impeded by P-glycoproteins. Hence, current research and development focus on 
overcoming these obstacles. A biomimetic drug delivery system is one of the best 
ways to overcome these challenges. One of the promising biomimetic drug delivery 
systems is cell membrane-coated nanoparticles. In this review, we have 
comprehensively reviewed the recent progress and development in various cell 
membrane coated nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems for the effective 
management of a range of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease, 
Parkinson's Disease, Glioblastoma, Ischemic Stroke, Huntington's Disease, 
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Glioma, Peripheral Nerve Injury, and Motor Neuron 
Disorder. We also reviewed the challenges associated with cell membrane-coated 
nanoparticles, such as biosafety hurdles, toxicity, regulatory requirements, and 
clinical translation. Ultimately, we provided the conclusions and future 
research directions that must be investigated to overcome the current 
limitations.

OBJECTIVE: Extremely low frequency magnetic fields (ELF-MF) have been confirmed 
to have potentially positive effects on Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the 
therapeutic effects are influenced by the exposure mode and the pathological 
process. Currently, there is no optimized treatment plan for the pathological 
process of AD. This study aims to optimize the exposure mode of ELF-MF to 
improve the therapeutic effect on AD mice with different degrees of dementia.
METHOD: This study employed 40 Hz, 10mT continuous pulsed ELF-MF stimulation, 
intermittent (stimulating for 30 min every 12 h) and continuous (stimulating for 
60 min every 24 h) ELF-MF exposure. Through calculating various behavioral data, 
the changes in spatial working memory (SWM) of each group of mice were compared; 
the time-frequency distribution analysis method was applied to compare the 
changes in the theta band and gamma band neural oscillations of local field 
potentials (LFPs) signals in the CA1 region of the hippocampus during the object 
location task (OLT) of each group of mice; by analyzing the immunofluorescence 
images of Amyloid-beta 42 (Aβ42) and dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) in the 
hippocampal region of each group of mice, the changes in Aβ42 and Drp1 contents 
were compared.
RESULTS: ELF-MF stimulation can improve the SWM ability of AD model mice. Among 
them, intermittent stimulation in the adult group shows a better effect, while 
continuous stimulation in the aged group is superior. Further LFPs analysis 
reveals that AD leads to a decrease in theta and gamma frequency band energy in 
the CA1 area of the hippocampus, while ELF-MF stimulation can significantly 
enhance its energy. Moreover, in the adult group, the improvement of theta and 
gamma frequency bands under intermittent stimulation is more obvious, and in the 
aged group, the improvement of theta frequency band under continuous stimulation 
is more significant. The results of immunofluorescence detection indicate that 
ELF-MF stimulation can reduce the abnormal accumulation of Aβ42 and Drp1 in the 
hippocampus, and the effect of intermittent stimulation in the adult group is 
more significant.
CONCLUSION: Intermittent ELF-MF exposure may be an effective therapeutic 
strategy, especially in adult AD mice. This study highlights the potential 
significance of the ELF-MF exposure pattern in AD treatment and reveals the 
heterogeneous effects of ELF-MF exposure on the physiological and pathological 
conditions of AD mice, which has important guiding significance for the 
formulation of personalized treatment plans in the future.

OBJECTIVE: Drug repurposing offers a cost-effective strategy to accelerate drug 
development by identifying new therapeutic uses for approved medications. 
Knowledge graphs (KGs) that capture large amounts of biomedical knowledge have 
recently been used for drug repurposing, however, KGs are inherently incomplete 
due to our limited biomedical knowledge.
METHODS: We propose KGiA, an inductive graph augmentation method that supports 
semi-inductive reasoning-allowing models to generalize to previously unseen 
biomedical entities. KGiA enhances KGs using counterfactual relationships mined 
from disease-specific topological patterns. We apply it to a state-of-art 
biomedical KG constructed from six datasets including biomedical relationships 
extracted from biomedical literature, which comprised 1,614,801 triples and 
100,563 entities, including 30,006 diseases.
RESULTS: Across five augmented architectures, KGiA improves generalizability by 
up to 24×in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and outperforms the state-of-the-art 
KG-based drug repurposing model by up to 32%. We applied KGiA in four case 
studies of diseases including Alzheimer's Disease and showed its promise in 
identifying novel repurposed candidate drugs.
CONCLUSION: We showed that leveraging counterfactual relationships derived from 
disease-specific graph structures to augment existing knowledge graphs improved 
performance in KG-based drug repurposing.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) presents a growing public health challenge that 
urgently requires effective disease-modifying therapies. Active immunotherapy 
appears to be a promising strategy in AD drug development, offering advantages 
over passive immunization in terms of prophylactic potential and 
cost-effectiveness. We systematically reviewed anti-Aβ and anti-tau active 
immunization strategies over the past 25 years, identifying 577 unique antigenic 
formulations. Only 3.5 % have progressed to clinical trials, with none yet 
approved. Notably, only three strategies targeted both Aβ and tau epitopes 
(Aβ1-11 and tau2-18), despite the potential of multi-target approaches for AD's 
multifactorial pathology. Given the synergistic role of Aβ and tau in disease 
progression, dual-target vaccines remain a critical and underinvestigated area 
with significant therapeutic promise. This review underscores the need to expand 
research into multi-target immunotherapies that better address AD's complexity, 
potentially improving prevention and treatment outcomes.

Chronic cerebral ischemia (CCI) induced hyperphosphorylated Tau has been 
associated with an increased risk of neurodegenerative disorders such as 
Alzheimer's and vascular dementia. This study investigated the neuroprotective 
effects of Antroquinonol (AQ), an ubiquinone derivative from Antrodia camphorata 
with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Bilateral internal carotid 
artery ligation (BICAL) in male Wistar rats and mixed rat primary neuron/glia 
co-cultures exposed to a hypoxia and hypoglycemia (HH) environment were used as 
experimental CCI models to investigate the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of 
AQ. AQ was administered daily at low or high doses for 28 days after BICAL 
induction. Two and four weeks after BICAL surgery, the functional and cognitive 
outcomes were evaluated by rotarod test, open field test (OFT), novel object 
recognition (NOR) and Y-maze test. Nissl, TUNEL, IHC and ICC staining, and 
Western blot analysis were used to evaluate the effects and underlying 
mechanisms of AQ in the treatment of CCI. The results showed that both low and 
high doses of AQ treatment significantly ameliorated motor deficits, 
anxiety-like behavior, and cognitive impairments in BICAL rats at 2 or 4 weeks 
post-CCI. Histological and molecular analyses revealed that AQ reduced neuronal 
injury, microglia activation, apoptosis, and Tau hyperphosphorylation in the 
cortex and hippocampus regions. We also found that AQ inhibited HH-induced 
hyperphosphorylation of Tau by modulating protein kinases (p-GSK3β Y216 and 
p-mTOR), LC3II, and p-NRF2 proteins in cultured cells, suggesting roles in 
kinase regulation, autophagy, and antioxidation. These findings support AQ as a 
promise therapeutic candidate for treating CCI-related neurodegenerative 
disorders.

Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis pose considerable therapeutic challenges, not only 
due to their complex pathophysiology, but also because any effective drug must 
be capable of penetrating the brain. Inflammation is a key feature of NDDs. 
Increasingly, the complement system, long studied in the context of host 
defence, has emerged as a central player in the brain, with roles extending far 
beyond its classical immune functions. Complement contributes to synaptic 
pruning and immune surveillance, but when dysregulated, it can drive chronic 
inflammation, synapse loss, and neurodegeneration. Complement is also implicated 
in neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric diseases, including schizophrenia and 
mood disorders, where overactivation of the cascade impacts brain maturation and 
circuit stability. In this review, we take a broad view of roles of the 
complement system in both health and disease in the central nervous system 
(CNS). We summarise key mechanisms through which complement contributes to 
pathology, discuss emerging therapeutic strategies, and consider major hurdles 
in CNS drug development, including brain delivery and the need for patient 
stratification. As our understanding of the pathological roles of the complement 
system in the brain advances, it is becoming clear that complement therapeutics 
may offer a novel approach in slowing neurodegeneration, and in addressing a 
broader spectrum of disorders affecting the brain.

This study reported the profiling and the in-silico analysis of the therapeutic 
potential of proteins/peptides (for Alzheimer disease) isolated from Tinospora 
cordifolia, Evolvulus alsinoides, Centella asiatica and Convolvulus pluricaulis. 
The proteins/peptides were extracted by using four different pH based buffer 
solutions. The trypsin digested proteins/peptides were analyzed by LC-MS/MS 
based peptide mass fingerprinting which showed the presence of high number of 
proteins/peptides involved in regulating the oxidative stress. The sequential 
purification with 10 kDa and 3 kDa cut-off ultrafiltration membranes for buffer 
based extracted proteins/peptides was performed. The evaluation of crude and 
these filtrates revealed the highest antioxidant potential for 3 kDa cut-off 
filtrate of 0.1 M Tris HCl buffer (pH 8.0) from FRAP, DPPH, ABTS and NOS assays. 
The presence of peptides in 3 kDa cut-off filtrates was detected by HPLC, 
identified by MALDI-TOF MS and the fragmentation pattern was obtained by 
LC-MS/MS. The in-silico docking study revealed that the identified peptides 
showed the highest binding affinity against the Alzheimer targets (BACE1, nAChR, 
Aβ, AChE, GSK-3β, JNK). Thus, the findings of this study provided the 
preliminary evidence for the antioxidant and neuroprotective potential of the 
selected medicinal plants, by supporting their relevance in delaying the onset 
of neurodegeneration and highlighting their prospects for drug development.

Multitargeted directed ligands (MTDLs) represent an appealing tactic to treat 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder. In this 
study, the pyrazolopyridine scaffold was used to design three different series 
of integrated MTDLs that could inhibit the main causes of AD. They possess 
common structure features essential for such a goal. The planar pyrazolopyridine 
core allows binding with the catalytically active site of cholinesterase enzymes 
and intercalating between the residues of Aβ and tau protein. In addition, the 
planar ring is attached to different linkers and hydrophobic side chains to prop 
interaction with the peripheral anionic site of AChE, preventing Aβ1-42 
aggregation. They also provide tools for binding with hGSK3β hydrophobic tails 
responsible for tau hyperphosphorylation and NFTs formation. Moreover, basic 
nitrogen atoms are also present, which chelate biometals, hindering their 
oxidative damage to the brain. Compounds 15 and 23 fulfilled all the mentioned 
anticipated activities. Furthermore, compound 31, which is the possible 
metabolite of the ethyl ester 23, appeared as MTDL, proving that compound 23 
would have a long duration of action. Finally, compounds 15 and 23 exhibited a 
wide safety range upon WI-38 cell line, obeyed Lipinski's rule of five, and 
could virtually penetrate the blood-brain barrier.

BACKGROUND: The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) degeneration and subsequent 
retinal atrophy are hallmarks of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). 
Amyloid-beta (Aβ), the primary component of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), is also present within drusen and is considered a critical factor 
contributing to RPE degeneration in AMD. Recent findings indicate that 
Aβ-induced inflammation plays a role in RPE degeneration. The aim of this study 
was to explore the molecular players and the precise mechanisms involved in this 
process, particularly the potential role of the absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2)-like 
receptors (ALRs) inflammasome.
METHODS: An animal model of Aβ1-40-induced RPE injury was established. Fundus 
photography, electrophysiology and hematoxylin-eosin staining were used to 
evaluate the morphological and functional RPE damage. Transcriptome sequencing 
was used to detect the differentially expressed genes between Aβ1-40 group and 
control group. The transcriptional and protein expression levels of AIM2 pathway 
and RIPK family members were detected. Adeno-associated virus vector 2/2 
(AAV2/2)-shAIM2 was constructed to knockdown AIM2 expression in mice RPE cells. 
Aβ1-40-treated ARPE-19 cells and hRPE cells were employed to analyze the 
regulatory effects of RIPK family on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) release and AIM2 
pathway activation.
RESULTS: Aβ induces RPE damage through stimulation of AIM2 inflammasome and 
augmentation of caspase-1 and interleukin-1β (IL-1β). Knocking down AIM2 
inhibits the release of inflammatory cytokines and alleviates the degeneration 
of the retina and RPE. Simultaneously, Aβ triggers the activation of RIPK1/RIPK3 
kinases, as manifested by heightened protein expression and phosphorylation. 
Inhibiting RIPK1/RIPK3 phosphorylation dampens AIM2 inflammasome activity and 
curtails IL-1β secretion. Mechanistically, RIPK1/RIPK3 inhibition attenuates 
Aβ-induced Drp1(S616) hyperphosphorylation, consequently reducing mitochondrial 
fission and the efflux of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) into the cytosol. The 
diminished mtDNA release is responsible for attenuated AIM2 activation and 
subsequent inactivation of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING)/nuclear 
factor-kappa-B (NF-κB) signaling cascade.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first to validate AIM2's contribution in 
Aβ-induced RPE pathology and underscore the significance of the 
RIPK1/RIPK3-induced mtDNA release in modulating inflammatory responses, shedding 
light on the underlying mechanisms and potential therapeutics of AMD.

BACKGROUND: Edaravone-Dexborneol (EDB) presents therapeutic effects due to its 
anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-apoptotic properties, and has been 
widely used in ischemic stroke. However, the detailed efficacy and potential 
target of EDB in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are still elusive.
METHODS: Male APPswe/PS1dE9 mice were administered with EDB intraperitoneally 
from 3.5 to 8 months of age. The cognition of mice was assessed by behavioral 
tests. Synaptic alternations in the hippocampus were detected by 
electrophysiology and Golgi staining. β-amyloid (Aβ) pathology was mainly 
observed by immunofluorescence. Oxidative stress-related indicators were 
evaluated by dedicated kits, while quantitative PCR and ELISA were used to 
detect pro-inflammatory factors. Proteomics analysis further identified the 
potential target of EDB.
RESULTS: EDB was capable of delaying the cognitive decline and ameliorating the 
synaptic loss in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. In addition to the anti-inflammation and 
anti-oxidation effects, EDB treatment mightily ablated the Aβ plaque by 
promoting microglial phagocytosis. Particularly, we first discovered that EDB 
could directly bind to S100A9, a pathological molecule that aggravates Aβ 
pathology and induces oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. EDB inhibited the 
expression, functional threonine phosphorylation and self-assembly of S100A9.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that EDB can improve cognitive function and 
slow down AD progression, and it may serve as a potential agent for AD and other 
S100A9-related diseases.

BACKGROUND: Recently developed blood test of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been 
recognized as a promising alternative to CSF and PET, as it is noninvasive, 
cost-effective, and more accessible. Particularly, plasma p-tau217 shows high 
sensitivity in detecting β-amyloid (Aβ) and tau positivity in early AD. However, 
the potential value of p-tau217 in revealing Aβ and tau distribution and 
predicting future development has not been studied.
OBJECTIVES: We investigated the dose-response associations between p-tau217 and 
regional Aβ and tau measured by PET, as well as the longitudinal prediction of 
p-tau217 for prospective Aβ and tau accumulation measured by longitudinal PET.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses.
SETTING: We used data in Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's 
disease (A4) study (N = 333) for primary analyses and Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (N = 410) for validation.
PARTICIPANTS: Cognitively unimpaired older adults (N = 333) from A4 study and 
cognitively unimpaired older adults (N = 222), mild cognitive impairment (N = 
114), and dementia (N = 74) from ADNI.
MEASUREMENTS: Plasma p-tau217 was measured using Lilly (A4) and Fujirebio (ADNI) 
assays. 18-FFlorbetapir PET and 18-FFlortaucipir PET measured regional Aβ and 
tau.
RESULTS: Plasma p-tau217 was associated with concurrent Aβ in most cortical 
regions and tau in temporo-parietal cortices. Longitudinally, p-tau217 predicted 
brain-wide tau accumulation in widespread cortical regions in preclinical AD, 
but not Aβ change anywhere.
CONCLUSIONS: Plasma p-tau217 shows dose-response, brain-wide relationships with 
concurrent Aβ and future tau development in preclinical AD, suggesting its 
potential in disease trajectory monitoring and large-scale screening for 
individuals approaching certain biological stages of AD in clinical trials.

Galectin-3 (Gal-3) has emerged as a critical regulator of neuroinflammation and 
a promising therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nevertheless, the 
development of brain-penetrant small-molecule Gal-3 inhibitors poses a 
significant challenge. To address this, we employed an artificial intelligence 
(AI)-driven drug discovery platform, identifying FJMU1887 as a novel Gal-3 
inhibitor possessing optimized pharmacokinetic properties and favorable 
blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. Following AI-based virtual screening and 
structure prioritization, FJMU1887 demonstrated direct binding to Gal-3 with an 
affinity (Kd) of 1.55 μM, determined by microscale thermophoresis (MST). 
Crucially, mechanistic studies revealed that FJMU1887 disrupts the Gal-3-TREM2 
interaction, as evidenced by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and 
fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) assays. In vitro, FJMU1887 
suppressed inflammatory responses in BV-2 microglial cells, inhibiting TNF-α 
with an IC₅₀ of 2.36 ± 0.37 μM, without inducing cytotoxicity. Pharmacokinetic 
assessments via parallel artificial membrane permeability assay for BBB 
(PAMPA-BBB) and in situ brain perfusion revealed effective blood-brain barrier 
penetration by FJMU1887, though partial P-glycoprotein-mediated efflux was 
observed. In vivo, 30-day oral administration of FJMU1887 to 14-month-old 5 ×FAD 
mice significantly reduced Gal-3 expression, attenuated microglial activation 
and neuroinflammation, decreased amyloid-β burden, and restored synaptic 
integrity. Notably, FJMU1887 improved cognitive performance in both 5 ×FAD and 
oligomeric Aβ-induced cognitive impairment mouse models across multiple 
behavioral paradigms. Collectively, FJMU1887 represents a brain-penetrant 
small-molecule Gal-3 inhibitor with dual anti-neuroinflammatory and 
cognition-enhancing effects, establishing it as a promising lead compound for AD 
therapy.

Neuroinflammation is closely linked to Alzheimer's disease, where the deposition 
of amyloid-beta activates microglia, triggering multiple processes that lead to 
neuronal damage and cognitive decline. However, studies have shown that water 
extract of Pinellia ternata can improve cognitive function and reduce 
inflammatory response in the brain injury of mice. Herein, a water-soluble 
polysaccharide, PTTBP-2-2, with a molecular weight of 11.7 kDa, consisting of 
D-Glc, D-Gal, D-Xyl, and L-Ara was isolated from P. ternata. Methylation 
analysis, partial acid hydrolysis, and nuclear magnetic resonance revealed that 
the of PTTBP-2-2 backbone consisted of →4)-α-D-Glcp-(1→, →4,6)-α-D-Glcp-(1→, and 
→6)-α-D-Galp-(1→ residues, with side chains substituted at O-2, O-3, and O-6 
positions of →4)-α-D-Glcp-(1→. In vitro experiments demonstrated that PTTBP-2-2 
significantly reduced nitric oxide levels in BV2 microglia cells and suppressed 
the expression of pro-inflammatory genes, including COX2, iNOS, TNF-α, IL-1β, 
and IL-6. These factors are key mediators of neuroinflammation. Mechanistic 
investigations revealed that the anti-neuroinflammatory activity of PTTBP-2-2 
was mediated through the regulation of NF-κB and Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathways. 
Overall, PTTBP-2-2 shows potential as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of 
neuroinflammation.

Nine undescribed alkaloids (1, 3, 4, 7, 8 and 10-13) and four undescribed 
natural products (2, 5, 6 and 9), together with eight known components, were 
isolated from the tubers of Pinellia pedatisecta Schott. Their structures were 
elucidated based on spectroscopic data, Rh2(OCOCF3)4-induced ECD spectral 
analysis, DP4+ analysis, ECD analysis and interpretation of their optical 
rotation data. The protective effects of all compounds against Aβ25-35-induced 
PC-12 cell injury were tested by MTT method, and the results indicated that 
compounds 1, 2, 5-10 and 16-20 exhibited obviously protective effects. In 
addition, the action mechanisms of compounds 2 and 5 were investigated by flow 
cytometry and cellular immunofluorescence, and the results indicated that 
compounds 2 and 5 ameliorated Aβ25-35-induced PC-12 cell injury via the 
NMDAR/p-CamK II/PKG signaling pathway. This study provided experimental basis 
for researching the chemical composition of P. pedatisecta and developing 
natural medicines for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease in the future.

A chemical investigation of the stems and leaves of Pinellia pedatisecta Schott 
afforded forty norsesquiterpenes, including eleven undescribed compounds (1-6, 
10-13, and 23) and twenty-nine known analogues. Their structures were elucidated 
using detailed spectroscopic and comparative literature data analysis. The 
Mo2(OAc)4-induced ECD spectral analysis, DP4+ and ECD analysis were used to 
determine the absolute configuration of undescribed isolates. In addition, the 
results of the bioactivity evaluation indicated that components 3-6, 8-10, 12, 
14, 15, 17-19, 21-22, 25-29, 33, and 39 significantly improved Aβ25-35-induced 
PC-12 cell damage. The network pharmacology results showed that STAT3, NFKB1, 
HIF1A, EGFR, CASP3 were the correlated targets of compounds 3-6, 10, and 12 
against AD, with Ras, PI3K-Akt, and MAPK as the potential signaling pathways. 
This study provided experimental basis for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease 
and we will further explore mechanisms in cells and mice to find accurate 
targets and pathways in the future.

Chronic neuroinflammation is a major contributor to neuronal dysfunction and 
neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent 
neurodegenerative disorder worldwide. In this study, bioinformatic analyses 
identified differentially expressed inflammatory response genes across multiple 
AD-affected brain regions. Among these, epithelial membrane protein 3 (EMP3), a 
putative regulator of macrophage and T cell immune responses, was found to be 
dysregulated in both human AD brain tissues and in AD animal models, including 
3 × Tg-AD mice. Functional validation using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated EMP3 knockout 
in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells demonstrated that EMP3 deletion attenuated 
Aβ-induced suppression of cell proliferation and apoptosis. Western blot 
analysis further revealed a reduction in GSK3β phosphorylation in EMP3-deficient 
cells following Aβ exposure, possibly by effected its upstream regulator. 
Notably, GSK3β overactivation has been associated with memory impairment, tau 
hyperphosphorylation, and enhanced Aβ production in AD. Transcriptomic profiling 
via RNA sequencing uncovered altered expression of several inflammatory genes 
involved in the downstream response to Aβ, including key regulators such as 
TLR2, S100A10, and CD44. The association between EMP3 and inflammatory pathways 
was further supported by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) 
and immune infiltration analysis. Collectively, these findings suggest that EMP3 
may serve as a critical modulator of neuroinflammatory processes in AD 
pathogenesis and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target for future 
interventions.

Advances in biomarkers and pathophysiology of vascular contributions to 
cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) are expected to bring greater 
mechanistic insights, more targeted treatments, and potentially 
disease-modifying therapies. The 2025 Annual Workshop of the Albert Research 
Institute for White Matter and Cognition, sponsored by the Leo and Anne Albert 
Charitable Trust since 2015, focused on novel biomarkers for VCID. The meeting 
highlighted the complexity of dementia, emphasizing that the majority of cases 
involve multiple brain pathologies, with vascular pathology typically present. 
Potential novel approaches to diagnosis of disease processes and progression 
that may result in VCID included measures of microglial senescence and retinal 
changes, as well as artificial intelligence (AI) integration of multimodal 
datasets. Proteomic studies identified plasma proteins associated with cerebral 
autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and 
leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL; a rare genetic disorder affecting brain vessels) 
and age-related vascular pathology that suggested potential therapeutic targets. 
Blood-based microglial and brain-derived extracellular vesicles are promising 
tools for early detection of brain inflammation and other changes that have been 
associated with cognitive decline. Imaging measures of blood perfusion, oxygen 
extraction, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow were discussed as potential VCID 
biomarkers, in part because of correlations with classic pathological 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers. MRI-visible perivascular spaces, which may 
be a novel imaging biomarker of sleep-driven glymphatic waste clearance 
dysfunction, are associated with vascular risk factors, lower cognitive 
function, and various brain pathologies including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and 
cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). People with Down syndrome are at high risk 
for dementia. Individuals with Down syndrome who develop dementia almost 
universally experience mixed brain pathologies, with AD pathology and 
cerebrovascular pathology being the most common. This follows the pattern in the 
general population where mixed pathologies are also predominant in the brains of 
people clinically diagnosed with dementia, including AD dementia. Intimate 
partner violence-related brain injury, hypertension's impact on dementia risk, 
and the promise of remote ischemic conditioning for treating VCID were 
additional themes.

The design of efficacious nanotherapeutics for neurodegenerative disorders 
necessitates the development of precisely targeted delivery systems capable of 
transversing the blood-brain barrier (BBB) while sustaining therapeutic 
efficacy. Here, we introduce a novel brain-targeted nanocomposite system 
comprising carboxymethylated pullulan-magnesium oxide (CMP-MgO) matrix 
encapsulating trans-ferulic acid (TFA) and last surface-functionalized with 
lactoferrin (Lf) to facilitate receptor-mediated transcytosis. Comprehensive 
physicochemical characterization, including dynamic light scattering (DLS), 
proton-nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR), fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), 
high resolution-transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), atomic force 
microscopy (AFM), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), thermogravimetric analysis 
(TGA), and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, confirmed the structural 
integrity functionalization, and stability of the nanocomposites. DLS studies 
exhibited a hydrodynamic diameter of 386 ± 5.06 nm, a polydispersity index of 
0.087 ± 0.008, and a zeta potential of -20.5 ± 0.19 mV of the Lf-TFA-CMP-MgO. 
Morphological analysis confirmed spherical particles with a smooth surface, and 
CD spectroscopy confirmed the perpetuation of the native structure of Lf after 
conjugation with the nanocomposite. The antioxidant assay highlighted 
significant free radical scavenging activity, reflecting the antioxidant 
potential of TFA and TFA-loaded nanocomposites. In vitro studies demonstrated 
excellent biocompatibility and enhanced cellular internalization due to Lf 
functionalization. Notably, the nanocomposite inhibited amyloid fibril formation 
by interacting with hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL). Furthermore, intranasal 
delivery achieved efficient nose-to-brain transport, with permeability of 415.45 
μg/cm2 at 6 h, highlighting its mucoadhesive properties and noninvasive 
therapeutic capability for Alzheimer's disease (AD).

The challenges in the current treatment landscape for Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
underscore the urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies targeting multiple 
pathological pathways. Recent studies have implicated iron in ROS-dependent 
neuronal injury through ferroptosis. Additionally, overexpression of monoamine 
oxidase B (MAO-B) induces oxidative stress and decreases cognitive function. In 
this study, we presented the novel dual inhibitors of ferroptosis and MAO-B for 
AD management, aiming to address both the symptomatic and neurodegenerative 
aspects of this disease. Compound 21d emerged as a promising candidate, 
exhibiting potent and selective MAO-B inhibitory activity (IC50 = 87.47 nM, SI > 
229), as well as excellent antiferroptosis activity through modulation of the 
iron metabolic pathway and GSH-GPX4 axis in vitro. Importantly, 21d normalized 
cognitive and memory impairments in a 3×Tg (APP/Tau/Ps1) AD mouse model and 
reduced levels of AD-related proteins, including amyloid precursor protein and 
phosphorylated Tau protein, in the brains of AD mice.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive age-related 
neurodegenerative disorder. There is currently no promising cure for AD; the 
available treatments can only alleviate the symptoms.
OBJECTIVES: The Benzofuran-Enaminone derivative 
'(E)-1-(benzofuran-2-yl)-3-((2-hydroxyphenyl)amino)prop-2-en-1-one (5)' was 
synthesized as a potential anti-AD candidate in Aluminum chloride 
(AlCl3)-induced AD in rats.
METHODS: In vivo and in vitro acute and chronic studies were conducted to 
examine the potential toxicity, as well as the antioxidant and 
anti-acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities of compound 5. Then, rats were 
divided into four groups: (1) negative control; (2) AD-induced rats; (3) 
AD-induced rats treated with compound 5; and (4) AD-induced rats treated with 
Donepezil. Behavioral, biochemical, and molecular investigations were conducted. 
The expression of insulin 1 gene, apoptotic genes, and the AD-related genes were 
estimated.
RESULTS: The selected dose of compound 5 (10 mg/kg) was based on an acute 
toxicity test, then it was applied for a chronic study for 1 month; no 
toxicological features were stimulated. In vitro, compound 5 demonstrated 
antioxidant and anti-AChE activities. The expression of apoptotic genes (Bcl-2, 
Bax, and Caspase-3), AD-related genes (Amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Tau), 
and the insulin 1 gene were altered in AD-induced rats versus control rats. 
Treatment of AD rats with compound 5 counteracted the AlCl3-induced 
neurotoxicity.
CONCLUSION: This study could be regarded as an initial step in drug discovery 
for testing this new chemical entity as a potent anti-AD therapeutic agent.

BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence suggests that senescent microglia play a role in 
β-amyloid (Aβ) pathology and neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Targeting senescent cells with naturally derived compounds exhibiting minimal 
cytotoxicity represents a promising therapeutic strategy.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate whether delphinidin, a naturally 
occurring anthocyanin, can alleviate AD-related pathologies by mitigating 
microglial senescence and to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms.
METHODS: We employed APP/PS1 mice, naturally aged mice, and an in vitro model 
using Aβ42-induced senescent BV2 microglia. Delphinidin's effects were evaluated 
through assessments of cognitive function, synaptic integrity (synapse loss), Aβ 
plaque burden, senescent microglia gene signatures, and cellular senescence 
markers (including senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, SASP factor 
expression, oxidative stress, and cyclin p21/p16 levels). Mechanistic studies 
involved analyzing the AMPK/SIRT1 signaling pathway, testing direct 
delphinidin-SIRT1 interaction, and using the AMPK inhibitor Compound C.
RESULTS: Delphinidin treatment significantly alleviated cognitive deficits, 
synapse loss, Aβ peptides plaques of APP/PS1 mice via downregulated senescent 
microglia gene signature, prevented cell senescence, including 
senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, senescence-associated secretory 
phenotype (SASP), oxidative stress, cyclin p21 and p16. And delphinidin 
treatment also prevented microglial senescence in naturally aged mice. In vitro, 
delphinidin treatment attenuated cell senescence induced by Aβ42 in BV2 
microglia cells. Further research indicated that delphinidin treatment enhanced 
the AMPK/SIRT1 signaling pathway. Additionally, delphinidin was found to 
directly interact with SIRT1. It's noteworthy that AMPK inhibitor Compound C 
inversed the protective effect of delphinidin against microglial senescence.
CONCLUSION: Our study reveals for the first time that delphinidin effectively 
improved cognitive deficits, alleviated synapse loss and Aβ pathology in APP/PS1 
mice by mitigating microglial senescence. These findings highlight delphinidin 
as a promising natural anti-aging agent against the development of aging and 
age-related diseases.

This study aimed to isolate and characterize an acetylcholine-producing 
probiotic strain and to evaluate its potential anti-Alzheimer properties in 
D-galactose rat model. Nine Lactobacillus isolates were isolated and purified on 
MRS agar, with six demonstrating acetylcholine (ACh) production capability. 
Among these, Lactiplantibacillus sp. AM2 showed the highest ACh production (78.4 
pg/mL) and was identified as Lactiplantibacillus plantarum through 
morphological, biochemical, 16S rRNA sequencing and matrix-assisted laser 
desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). The 
in-vitro probiotic characterization of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum AM2 
included tolerance testing for acidic conditions and bile salts, viability under 
simulated digestive conditions, antimicrobial activity assessment, and 
sensitivity testing to antibiotics. Behavioral and biochemical tests were 
conducted in a D-galactose-induced cognitive impairment rat model to evaluate 
cognitive performance, serum glucose levels, oxidative stress markers, and 
antioxidant capacity. Histopathological evaluations of the hippocampus were also 
performed. Lactiplantibacillus plantarum AM2 demonstrated strong tolerance to 
acidic conditions and bile salts, maintaining over 80% viability after exposure 
to simulated gastric and pancreatic juices. The strain showed hydrophobicity 
toward hexadecane, octane, and xylene. It also exhibited significant 
antimicrobial activity against pathogenic bacteria and was sensitive to multiple 
antibiotics. In cognitive impairment tests, rats administered with 
Lactiplantibacillus plantarum AM2 showed reduced time latency in the Morris 
Water Maze, suggesting cognitive enhancement. Biochemical analyses revealed 
improvements in serum glucose levels, reduced oxidative stress markers, and 
increased glutathione and total antioxidant capacity. Histopathological analyses 
showed mitigation of hippocampal damage, promoting recovery of normal cellular 
architecture. These findings highlight Lactiplantibacillus plantarum AM2 as a 
promising probiotic candidate with neuroprotective potential and notable ACh 
production. Further research is warranted to explore its application in 
therapeutic contexts.

Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease initiated by plaque 
microorganisms, with the regulatory mechanisms of its progression being a 
primary research focus. Ferroptosis, a unique form of cell death driven by 
iron-dependent lipid peroxidation, has been increasingly recognized for its 
crucial role in modulating chronic inflammation. This study focused on the 
molecular mechanisms by which plaque microorganisms and the inflammatory 
microenvironment trigger ferroptosis in periodontal cells, elucidating how 
ferroptosis in these cells promotes periodontitis progression. Additionally, the 
potential exacerbation of periodontitis through ferroptosis in systemic diseases 
such as Alzheimer's disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease, and type 2 diabetes is discussed. This review aims to provide 
new theoretical foundations and strategies for the treatment of periodontitis.

Epigenetic reprogramming has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for 
neurodegenerative diseases by targeting reversible gene expression changes 
without altering the underlying DNA sequence. This review explores key 
epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, 
non-coding RNAs, and chromatin remodeling, that contribute to neurodegeneration 
in Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease 
(HD). Pharmacological interventions such as DNA methylation modulators, histone 
deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, and non-coding RNA therapies have shown potential 
in restoring normal gene function. Advanced approaches, including CRISPR-dCas9 
epigenetic editing, synthetic transcription factors (STFs), and Yamanaka 
factor-mediated cellular rejuvenation, offer precise control over 
disease-associated gene expression. Despite these advancements, several 
challenges and controversies remain, including off-target effects, delivery 
limitations, long-term safety concerns, and ethical implications. Emerging 
research focuses on multi-target combination therapies, integrating epigenetic 
interventions with stem cell therapy, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and 
AI-driven precision medicine. Future directions involve the development of 
non-invasive drug delivery systems, AI-powered biomarker discovery, and 
personalized epigenome-based treatments to enhance therapeutic outcomes. As 
research advances, epigenetic reprogramming holds the potential to revolutionize 
neurodegenerative disease treatment, providing more effective, individualized, 
and disease-modifying interventions.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) yields a dramatic burden on patients and their 
families, with no complete cure yet. Our group has previously found that 
AD-related cognitive impairment (ARCI) could be alleviated after luteolin and 
exercise combination treatment (Lut + Exe), but the potential mechanisms require 
further exploration. This work used untargeted metabolomics to uncover the 
mechanisms Lut + Exe protects against ARCI. Utilizing an 
Aβ1-42-oligomers-induced AD model, the Morris water maze (MWM) test was 
performed. Metabolomics of plasma was performed to identify differential 
metabolites. KEGG and MetaboAnalyst were used to enrich the metabolic pathways. 
Then, the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) was utilized to verify the 
potential role of autophagy in the Lut+ Exe efficacy against ARCI. The results 
showed that Lut + Exe alleviated the ARCI in mice. The in-depth analysis showed 
that Lut + Exe could significantly affect purine metabolism, retinol metabolism, 
thiamine metabolism, histidine metabolism, and cysteine and methionine 
metabolism, indicating that the energy metabolism disorder was alleviated. Based 
on the close relationship between autophagy and energy metabolism, further study 
found that Lut + Exe could reverse the significant reduction of key autophagy 
proteins of AD model mice, while the effects of it on the MWM performance and 
neurogenesis of AD model mice could be blocked by CQ. This study reveals the 
crucial role of autophagy in the mechanisms of Lut + Exe against ARCI using 
untargeted metabolomics. Our work provides a novel paradigm to promote the use 
of combination treatment in curing AD.

This paper explores the therapeutic potential of DMT in neuroprotective 
strategies, particularly concerning ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) and 
neurodegenerative disorders. Besides its potent serotonin receptor actions, DMT 
is also an endogenous agonist of the sigma-1 receptor (Sig-1R). Sigma receptors 
are a unique family of proteins with high expression in the brain and spinal 
cord and have been involved in the etiology, symptom course and treatment of 
several central nervous system disorders. Our previous theoretical and 
experimental work strongly suggest that targeting sigma (and serotonin) 
receptors via DMT may be particularly useful for treatment in a number of 
neurological conditions like stroke, global brain ischemia, Alzheimer's disease, 
and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In this article, we briefly overview the 
function of Sig1-R in cellular bioenergetics with a focus on the processes 
involved in IRI and summarize the results of our previous preclinical (in vitro 
and in vivo) DMT studies aiming at mitigating IRI and related cellular 
neuropathologies. We conclude that the effect of DMT may involve a universal 
role in cellular protective mechanisms suggesting therapeutic potentials against 
different components and types of IRIs emerging in local and generalized brain 
ischemia after stroke or cardiac arrest. The multiple neuroprotective mechanisms 
facilitated by DMT may position it as a model molecule for developing 
pharmacological treatments for neurodegenerative disorders.

BACKGROUND: Plasma biomarkers associated with Alzheimer's disease could improve 
prognostic assessment for people with Down syndrome in both clinical practice 
and research settings. We aimed to identify the plasma biomarkers that most 
accurately predict longitudinal changes in Alzheimer's disease-related pathology 
and cognitive functioning in individuals with Down syndrome.
METHODS: This longitudinal cohort study included data from 258 adults (aged ≥25 
years) with Down syndrome who were followed up prospectively every 16 months as 
part of the longitudinal Alzheimer's Biomarker Consortium-Down Syndrome study 
(recruited from seven university sites in the USA and UK between July 13, 2016, 
and Jan 15, 2019). Participants had baseline and longitudinal assessments of 
plasma tau phosphorylated at threonine 217 (p-tau217), glial fibrillary acidic 
protein (GFAP), amyloid β (Aβ)42/40, neurofilament light (NfL), or total tau 
(t-tau). Associations of baseline plasma biomarkers and longitudinal changes in 
plasma biomarkers with changes in global cognitive functioning (Down Syndrome 
Mental Status Examination [DS-MSE] scores), Aβ-PET, and tau-PET were examined 
using linear regression models. Plasma biomarker-associated risk of progression 
to dementia was assessed using Cox regression analysis.
FINDINGS: Baseline p-tau217, as well as GFAP, NfL, or t-tau, were individually 
associated with longitudinal changes in DS-MSE, Aβ-PET, and tau-PET, and with 
progression to dementia. However, in combined models, only baseline p-tau217 
remained associated with changes in DS-MSE (β -0·30 [95% CI -0·45 to -0·15], 
p=0·0001, n=220), tau-PET (0·42 [0·14 to 0·70], p=0·0039, n=88), and progression 
to dementia (hazard ratio 3·51 [95% CI 1·76-7·00], p=0·0004, n=194), whereas 
baseline p-tau217 (0·29 [0·14-0·45], p=0·0003) and GFAP (0·37 [0·18-0·56], 
p=0·0003) were associated with changes in Aβ-PET (n=106 for both). Similar 
associations were shown between longitudinal p-tau217 or GFAP and changes in 
DS-MSE (p-tau217: β -0·33 [95% CI-0·52 to -0·13], p=0·0015, n=133), tau-PET 
(p-tau217: 0·61 [0·40 to 0·83], p<0·0001, n=87), and Aβ-PET (p-tau217: 0·35 
[0·19 to 0·50], p<0·0001; GFAP: 0·49 [0·27 to 0·70], p<0·0001, n=88).
INTERPRETATION: Baseline and longitudinal plasma p-tau217 were associated with 
subsequent decline in global cognition, progression to dementia, and increased 
tau burden, whereas baseline p-tau217 and GFAP were associated with Aβ 
accumulation. These findings suggest that plasma p-tau217 and GFAP might be 
valuable for prognostic assessment of Alzheimer's disease in people with Down 
syndrome in both clinical and research contexts. The results further support 
evaluation of these biomarkers for monitoring disease progression in clinical 
trials of Down syndrome-related Alzheimer's disease.

BACKGROUND: α-synuclein seed amplification assay (SAA) positivity has been 
proposed as a diagnostic biomarker for Parkinson's disease. However, studies of 
the prognostic value of this biomarker have been limited to small, single-centre 
studies over short follow-up periods. We aimed to assess the diagnostic and 
prognostic value of quantitative CSF α-synuclein SAA kinetic measures in 
Parkinson's disease.
METHODS: In this longitudinal cohort study, we collected and analysed data from 
participants with Parkinson's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and 
healthy controls enrolled in three cohorts: the UK parkinsonism cohort, the 
Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) international observational 
study, and the Tübingen Parkinson's disease cohort. Baseline CSF α-synuclein SAA 
data and longitudinal clinical data were collected between Jan 1, 2005, and Nov 
1, 2023. The following seeding kinetic measures were calculated from the 
α-synuclein SAA curve for each SAA-positive sample: time to threshold (TTT) for 
a positive SAA result; maximum Thioflavin T fluorescence during the reaction 
time (MaxThT); and area under the fluorescence curve during the reaction time 
(AUC). We compared seeding kinetic measures between sporadic Parkinson's disease 
and progressive supranuclear palsy, and between sporadic Parkinson's disease and 
monogenic Parkinson's disease. We used time-to-event analyses to assess the 
ability of α-synuclein SAA kinetic measures to predict an unfavourable outcome 
in Parkinson's disease, adjusting for sex, age, and disease duration at SAA 
testing.
FINDINGS: We analysed data from 1631 participants: newly generated data from the 
UK parkinsonism cohort (Parkinson's disease, n=66; progressive supranuclear 
palsy, n=52; controls, n=9) and previously generated data from the PPMI 
(Parkinson's disease, n=1036; controls, n=239) and Tübingen (Parkinson's 
disease, n=229) cohorts. In the UK parkinsonism cohort, α-synuclein SAA was 
positive in 63 (96%) of 66 Parkinson's disease samples and eight (15%) of 52 
progressive supranuclear palsy samples, with six (75%) of eight positive 
progressive supranuclear palsy samples having distinct low and slow seeding 
kinetics (low MaxThT and high TTT) as a marker of Lewy body co-pathology. TTT 
was faster in GBA1-associated Parkinson's disease compared with sporadic 
Parkinson's disease in both the PPMI (p=0·04) and Tübingen (p=0·01) cohorts. In 
the PPMI cohort, after excluding individuals who had an unfavourable outcome at 
the time of baseline SAA testing, an unfavourable outcome was observed in 593 
(73%) of 810 participants with α-synuclein SAA-positive Parkinson's disease 
during a median follow-up period of 4·5 years (IQR 2-9). TTT at baseline 
predicted only cognitive decline (Montreal Cognitive Assessment score ≤21) as a 
component of an unfavourable outcome in Parkinson's disease in both the PPMI 
(n=824, hazard ratio [HR] 2·36 [95% CI 1·60-3·46], p=0·001) and Tübingen (n=135, 
2·17 [1·07-4·41], p=0·03) cohorts. TTT also predicted cognitive decline in a 
subgroup of participants with Parkinson's disease in the PPMI cohort who were 
Alzheimer's disease biomarker negative (n=355, HR 1·80 [95% CI 1·03-3·18], 
p=0·04).
INTERPRETATION: Assessing α-synuclein SAA kinetic measures might aid in the 
diagnostic differentiation of Parkinson's disease from progressive supranuclear 
palsy with Lewy body co-pathology. Furthermore, faster seeding kinetics are 
found in GBA1-Parkinson's disease and predict cognitive decline in Parkinson's 
disease independently of Alzheimer's disease co-pathology.

Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are a promising tool for studying 
neurological diseases and developing therapies for neurodegenerative diseases. 
Differentiation of hiPSCs into neurons can be achieved by dual SMAD inhibition 
(dSMADi) or by induced neurogenin 2 (NGN2) overexpression ("iNGN2"). Starting 
directly from hiPSCs, iNGN2 shortens the time to a neuronal stage but leads to 
neurons partially resembling peripheral or posterior fates while dSMADi more 
faithfully recapitulates telencephalic development. To modify the iNGN2 
approach, we applied an accelerated induction paradigm that is dependent on the 
inhibition of BMP, MEK, and WNT pathways ("BMWi"), to commit hiPSCs into a 
telencephalic fate before iNGN2. The resulting neurons showed strong expression 
of telencephalic markers, with decreased levels of peripheral and posterior 
marker genes compared to iNGN2 alone. The resulting telencephalic neurons are 
suitable for a tau aggregation assay. Furthermore, we could demonstrate that 
during BMWi treatment, the cells are amenable to additional regional patterning 
cues. This allowed the generation of neurons from different regions of the CNS 
and peripheral nervous system (PNS), which will significantly facilitate in 
vitro modeling of a range of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a gradually worsening neurological 
condition that involves memory loss, brain inflammation, and impaired 
mitochondrial function. The NLRP3 inflammasome activation in microglia plays a 
pivotal role in promoting neuroinflammation and worsening disease progression. 
Mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired mitophagy further create a detrimental 
feedback loop of oxidative stress and inflammation. Despite extensive research, 
pharmacological agents capable of simultaneously targeting both NLRP3 
inflammasome activation and impaired mitophagy remain scarce.
METHODS: We explored the therapeutic potential of Ciliatoside A (CA), a novel 
natural compound isolated from Peristrophe japonica, utilizing comprehensive 
cellular and animal models. In lipopolysaccharide/nigericin (LPS/Nig)-stimulated 
BV-2 microglial cells, the impact of CA on inflammasome activation, pyroptosis, 
mitochondrial health, and oxidative stress was assessed. Mechanistic evaluations 
were conducted using Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and advanced 
mitophagy assays. Furthermore, the efficacy of CA was validated in 
Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) models expressing human amyloid-beta (Aβ) 
and the well-established 3xTg-AD mouse model.
RESULTS: Our results demonstrate CA effectively inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome 
activation, reduces microglial pyroptosis, and mitigates oxidative 
stress-induced mitochondrial impairment in BV-2 cells. Notably, we identified 
the AMPK/ULK1 and PINK1/Parkin pathways as novel targets through which CA 
robustly activates mitophagy. Consistent therapeutic effects were observed in 
vivo, with CA significantly reducing Aβ-induced paralysis, ROS generation, and 
enhancing autophagy in worms. In 3xTg-AD mice, CA markedly improved cognitive 
function, diminished Aβ plaque deposition, alleviated neuroinflammation, and 
preserved neuronal integrity.
CONCLUSION: For the first time, this study reveals that CA offers dual 
neuroprotective benefits by promoting mitophagy while inhibiting NLRP3 
inflammasome-mediated neuroinflammation. These novel insights highlight the 
innovative therapeutic potential of CA, suggesting its promising application in 
slowing AD progression and mitigating its pathological features.

The discovery of new therapeutic agents for the treatment of neurodegenerative 
diseases-particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD) -remains one of the most 
challenging areas in medicinal chemistry. Given the multifactorial nature of 
these disorders, the rational design of multitarget-directed ligands (MTDLs) is 
gaining increasing attention, underscoring the importance of exploring novel 
target combinations. In this study, we report the design of the first-in-class 
multitarget compounds that function as dual GPR40 agonists and HDAC6 
inhibitors-a novel strategy aimed at modulating neuroinflammation in AD. Among 
them, compound 4e exhibited potent activity, with an EC50 of 22 nM for GPR40 
activation and an IC50 of 73 nM for HDAC6 inhibition. This balanced dual profile 
was corroborated in cell-based assays, where compound 4e significantly increased 
acetylated tubulin and ERK phosphorylation levels in SH-SY5Y cells. Furthermore, 
compound 4e demonstrated immunomodulatory effects on microglia, highlighting its 
potential as a chemical starting point for targeting neuroinflammation and, 
ultimately, neurodegeneration.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in 
ageing adults worldwide. As CVD substantially increases the risk of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) through shared pathophysiological mechanisms involving the 
heart-brain axis, bidirectional regulation of this axis holds promise for 
disease prevention. Saudi Arabian spices have long been used not only as 
culinary ingredients, but also as traditional medicines due to their diverse 
activities with fewer side effects. The present study aimed to identify 
preventive bioactive candidates from ten Saudi Arabian spices using network 
pharmacology and molecular simulations to uncover key hub genes and shared 
disease pathways in AD and CVD. A total of 51 compounds were selected based on 
optimized ADMET properties, and 661 overlapping genes were identified as 
potential targets. Protein-protein interaction analysis prioritized AKT1, SRC, 
and TP53 as hub genes and transcription factor/miRNA network analyses further 
supported their regulatory relevance. Kaempferol, apigenin and myristic acid 
were identified as regulators of these hub genes, targeting insulin signaling, 
microglial activation, RAGE-mediated vascular dysfunction, vascular smooth 
muscle cell proliferation, and apoptosis. Docking and molecular dynamics 
simulations revealed stable and specific binding interactions between these 
compounds and hub gene encoded proteins. These findings suggest that our active 
compounds have strong interactions with key hub genes in the heart-brain axis, 
providing novel insights into potential biomarkers and preventive candidates for 
AD and CVD.

OBJECTIVES: Patients with progressive apraxia of speech (PAOS) often develop 
atypical parkinsonian features suggestive of corticobasal syndrome (CBS) or 
progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and typically have an underlying 4-repeat 
tauopathy at autopsy. We describe three cases of PAOS with underlying Pick's 
disease, a 3-repeat tauopathy, who lacked CBS or PSP features during life.
METHODS: We reviewed patients enrolled in the Neurodegenerative Research Group's 
ongoing studies on speech and language disorders and identified those with PAOS 
who had autopsy-confirmed Pick's disease. All patients had comprehensive 
neurologic, speech-language, and neuropsychological assessments, as well as 
multimodal neuroimaging, during life.
RESULTS: Three female patients presented with phonetic PAOS without 
parkinsonism. Patient 1 had speech onset at age 54, later developed behavioral 
variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), and died at 64. Patient 2 had speech 
onset at 47, early bvFTD features, prominent frontal and temporal involvement, 
and died at 53. Patient 3 had speech onset at 58, minimal behavioral changes, 
primarily frontal involvement on imaging, and died at 63.
CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight that Pick's disease can present with PAOS and 
may be distinguished from 4R-tau PAOS by an absence of motoric CBS/PSP features 
and, in some cases, by prominent temporal hypometabolism with bvFTD development. 
These atypical features may prove useful in the antemortem identification of 
Pick's disease as a cause of PAOS.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are the most common 
neurodegenerative disorders, primarily characterized by cognitive decline and 
motor dysfunction, respectively. The comorbidity of AD and PD further increases 
disease complexity and presents significant challenges for clinical diagnosis 
and treatment. Due to substantial clinical overlaps in the advanced stage of AD 
and PD, comorbid cases are frequently misdiagnosed as a single disease, which 
hinders early recognition and timely intervention. Based on pathological 
observations from patients with comorbidity of AD and PD, this review discusses 
the prevalence and clinical features of AD-PD comorbidity, the spatiotemporal 
progression and potential interactions of key pathological proteins, including 
β-amyloid (Aβ), phosphorylated tau (pTau), and α-synuclein (α-syn). The aim of 
this review is to update potential new insights and strategies to improve 
diagnostic accuracy, advance personalized therapeutic approaches, and guide 
future research into the underlying mechanisms of comorbidity.

IMPORTANCE: Cancer-related cognitive impairment is a common concern after breast 
cancer treatment. However, the association between breast cancer survivorship 
and the risk of Alzheimer dementia (AD) remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the risk of AD among breast cancer survivors compared 
with cancer-free controls and examine the potential association of cancer 
treatments with AD risk.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study used data 
from the Korean National Health Insurance Service. A total of 70 701 patients 
who underwent breast cancer surgery between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 
2016, were included and matched with cancer-free controls (1:3). Participants 
were followed up for a median (IQR) of 7.3 (5.7-9.0) years. Data analysis was 
performed from January 2024 to June 2024.
EXPOSURES: Breast cancer diagnosis, surgery, and subsequent treatments, 
including anthracycline chemotherapy and radiation therapy.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the incidence of AD. 
Subdistribution hazard ratios (SHRs) and 95% CIs were calculated using competing 
risk regression models, adjusting for sociodemographic factors and 
comorbidities.
RESULTS: Among 70 701 breast cancer survivors (mean [SD] age, 53.1 [8.5] years), 
1229 cases of AD were detected, with an incidence rate of 2.45 per 1000 
person-years. Survivors exhibited a slightly lower risk of AD compared with 
cancer-free controls (SHR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.86-0.98), especially among 
individuals 65 years or older (SHR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.85-0.99). However, landmark 
analyses found that this lower risk did not persist beyond 5 years of survival. 
Cancer treatment with radiation therapy (adjusted HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.68-0.87) 
was associated with reduced risk of AD among survivors.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study of breast cancer survivors found a 
lower risk of AD compared with cancer-free controls, despite common concerns 
about cognitive decline after treatment. The findings suggest certain cancer 
treatments potentially have benefits for lower AD risk. Further research is 
needed to assess the long-term risk of AD in this population.

Numerous neurological conditions impact the brain, spinal cord, and nerves, 
including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's 
disease, autoimmune disorders like Multiple sclerosis, seizure disorders such as 
Epilepsy, and neuropsychiatric disorders like Schizophrenia and Autism spectrum 
disorders. Neural stem cells (NSCs) exhibit developmental abnormalities linked 
to the dysregulation of signaling pathways associated with diverse neurological 
disorders. NSCs can self-renew and differentiate into various neural cell types. 
NSC holds enormous therapeutic potential for targeting anomalous neural 
networks, traumatic brain injuries, and stroke. NSC differentiation programs are 
regulated by multiple elements, comprising growth factors, neurotransmitters, 
and extracellular matrix components, with intricate orchestration of cellular 
and molecular signaling pathways. This review aims to provide current 
information regarding the critical mechanisms of neural signaling circuits with 
interacting proteins involved in regular neural differentiation programs. The 
pivotal complex communication channels include the Notch, Wnt, BMP, RA, FGF, 
EGF, and Hippo signaling pathways. These circuits are implicated in the 
processes of NSC maintenance, proliferation, and differentiation, which 
collectively govern neural fate determination. This information can be used to 
initiate and promote neural regeneration. Based on the contributing factors in 
each signaling pathway, novel methods can be formulated and implemented for 
better and more robust neural differentiation programs. Hence, innovative 
approaches to treating neural disorders through an enhanced understanding of 
neural differentiation signaling pathways are paving the way for more effective 
therapeutic strategies.

Neurological disorders represent a leading cause of mortality and disability 
worldwide, encompassing a broad spectrum of prevalent conditions such as 
Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and stroke. In recent years, natural compounds 
have garnered increasing attention as potential therapeutic and preventive 
agents for neurological disorders. Galangin, a naturally occurring flavonoid 
primarily derived from Alpinia officinarum Hance, exhibits diverse biological 
properties, including notable neuroprotective, anti-tumor, and anti-inflammatory 
effects. Emerging evidence indicates that galangin exerts significant 
neuroprotective effects through multiple mechanisms. This review systematically 
summarizes the in vivo metabolism and pharmacokinetics of galangin, elucidates 
its mechanism of action, and highlights recent advances in its application for 
neurological disorders. Furthermore, the prospect of nanodrug carriers for 
enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of galangin is explored. Additionally, this 
review addresses the current research limitations and outlines future research 
directions to provide a theoretical foundation for its clinical application in 
neurological disorders. Collectively, the findings underscore the extensive 
pharmacological properties and therapeutic potential of galangin, highlighting 
its promise as a novel candidate for the treatment and prevention of 
neurological disorders and warranting further in-depth investigation and 
development.

Aging is the greatest risk factor for learning and memory disorders; dementia 
prevalence significantly increases with age due to numerous molecular changes in 
the body. Although research has consistently shown that aging leads to learning 
and memory impairments, the molecular mechanisms linking aging to these 
cognitive deficits remain incompletely understood. Previous studies have 
revealed that complement C3 levels increase with age in humans, monkeys, and 
mice; elevated C3 expression is also observed in the brains of dementia 
patients. These data suggest that C3 plays critical roles in initiating learning 
and memory impairments. To investigate whether C3 contributes to these deficits 
during aging, we developed a transgenic mouse model with elevated C3 expression 
to simulate age-related increases. Mice with increased C3 expression showed 
impaired learning and memory, along with synaptic loss, neuronal loss, and 
astrocytosis. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction microarray and cellular 
assays revealed that C3 elevation may impair cognitive functions by affecting 
insulin signaling pathways. Notably, antibody therapy targeting complement C3 in 
SAMP8 mice, which naturally exhibit increased brain C3 levels, alleviated their 
learning and memory deficits. These findings suggest that age-related complement 
C3 elevation drives memory impairments and associated neuropathologies; 
targeting complement C3 may alleviate these deficits.

As the global population ages, the health of older adults has become a growing 
concern. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common ailment affecting older adults, 
but the diagnosis and treatment of AD are difficult given our insufficient 
understanding of the disease. This review aims to provide reliable information 
for patients and their families by presenting a detailed overview of the 
pathogenic factors, diagnostic methods, and clinical manifestation of AD, as 
well as advances in drug and physical therapies. The information presented here 
should help provide a more comprehensive understanding of AD for patients and 
their families and encourage family- or self-screening based on clinical 
manifestations, thus improving early AD detection. In addition, the current 
treatment methods for AD are summarized. Although a gold-standard treatment for 
AD is yet to be developed, controlled-release therapies and medications that 
slow disease progression or improve cognitive function are available. The 
appropriate treatment method depends on the patient's diagnosis and the local 
medical level, and the effectiveness of the treatments may vary. Therefore, 
improving our understanding of AD and cognition-related symptoms in the public 
is necessary to improve early AD diagnoses. This review provides information 
that will facilitate self-screening for AD based on clinical manifestations, 
which can improve the early clinical diagnosis rate.

Protein aggregation is a normal response to age-related exposures. According to 
the thermodynamic hypothesis of protein folding, soluble proteins precipitate 
into amyloids (pathology) under supersaturated conditions through a process 
similar to crystallization. This soluble-to-insoluble phase transition occurs 
via nucleation and may be catalyzed by ectopic surfaces such as lipid 
nanoparticles, microbes, or chemical pollutants. The increasing prevalence of 
these exposures with age correlates with the rising incidence of pathology over 
the lifespan. However, the formation of amyloid fibrils does not inherently 
cause neurodegeneration. Neurodegeneration emerges when the levels of functional 
monomeric proteins, from which amyloids form, fall below a critical threshold. 
The preservation of monomeric proteins may explain neurological resilience, 
regardless of the extent of amyloid deposition. This biophysical framework 
challenges the traditional clinicopathological view that considers amyloids 
intrinsically toxic, despite the absence of a known mechanism of toxicity. 
Instead, it suggests that chronic exposures driving persistent nucleation 
consume monomeric proteins as they aggregate. In normal aging, replacement 
matches loss; in accelerated aging, it does not. A biophysical approach to 
neurodegenerative diseases has important therapeutic implications, refocusing 
treatment strategies from removing pathology to restoring monomeric protein 
homeostasis above the threshold needed to sustain normal brain function.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) has a long preclinical phase in which 
individuals may accumulate amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau pathology without 
noticeable cognitive impairment. Subjective cognitive impairment reports can 
provide early insights into cognitive decline.
METHODS: In the A4 Study, 339 cognitively unimpaired, Aβ-positive individuals 
underwent tau positron emission tomography imaging. Tau status was classified 
based on medial temporal lobe tau standardized uptake value ratios (tauMTL). 
Participants and study partners assessed cognitive changes using the 15-item 
Cognitive Function Index (CFI) questionnaire. We explored the relationship among 
tauMTL, hippocampal volume (HVa), and CFI reports.
RESULTS: Higher tauMTL was associated with participant-reported concerns about 
memory and navigation, and with study partner-reported difficulty remembering 
appointments. Lower HVa showed a marginal association with participant-reported 
driving difficulty.
DISCUSSION: These findings support the utility of participant- and study 
partner-reported concerns as early indicators of preclinical AD pathology, with 
potential value for early detection and trial enrichment strategies.
HIGHLIGHTS: Higher tau in the medial temporal lobe (tauMTL) was linked to 
participant-reported memory and orientation decline such as needing reminders or 
getting lost.Higher tauMTL was associated with increased memory-related 
concerns, such as needing help with appointments and asking repetitive 
questions.Lower hippocampal volume was associated with spatial memory and 
navigation such as driving difficulties and greater memory decline as reported 
by study partners.

INTRODUCTION: Cognitive impairment that exceeds age-related cognitive decline is 
a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. As the older adult 
population is notably increasing every year, significant efforts are being made 
to preserve cognitive function in older adulthood. Non-pharmaceutical approaches 
such as music interventions have noticeable benefits for cognition. Music 
engagement utilizes multiple brain regions dually involved in higher cognitive 
functions. Yet the neurobiology of music-induced cognitive change remains 
understudied. Complex human behavior and cognition likely depend on continuous 
communication across brain regions rather than localized activity in one region. 
Given that music creativity engages a wide range of mental processes, 
whole-brain network indices quantifying the brain's tendency to create 
functional communities (modularity) and then dynamically reorganize these 
communities (flexibility) may be relevant for assessing music-related cognitive 
change. Using a semi-randomized clinical trial design (ClinicalTrials.gov; 
NCT04137913), we examined whether (1) music creativity altered whole-brain 
network indices (modularity, flexibility) and (2) whether music-related effects 
on cognition depended on whole-brain network indices.
METHODS: Fifty-two older adults (Mean age = 75 years; 54% female; 84% White) 
were randomized to a 6-week music creativity intervention (n = 25) or a 
no-treatment control condition (n = 27) and completed resting-state fMRI scans 
and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment at baseline and follow-up 
(post-intervention).
RESULTS: The music creativity intervention did not alter network flexibility or 
modularity over time. However, the relationship between group assignment and 
change in global cognitive function depended on baseline flexibility: music 
creativity improved global cognition more than the control condition, only among 
individuals who had higher than average network flexibility.
DISCUSSION: Findings suggest that having a dynamic brain network, which has 
previously been linked to better executive functioning performance, may be 
necessary for music-related benefits on cognition. This pilot study is 
innovative as it is among the first to identify possible neural mechanisms 
underlying why music creativity interventions confer a more significant 
cognitive benefit for some older adults than others.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by 
progressive decline in cognitive function and emotional disturbances. The 
amygdala is an important connectivity structure in the brain and is responsible 
for emotional responses. 5-HT is involved in various neurodevelopmental 
processes in the brain. In this study, correlation study of 5-HT in brain with 
cognitive function and anxious-like behavior was investigated in APP/PS1 
transgene mice. Multiple behavioral tests were performed to examine the 
cognitive function and anxiety behavior of AD mice. In vivo hippocampus 
long-term potentiation (LTP) was recorded to reflect synaptic plasticity. 5-HT 
levels in hippocampus and amygdala were determined. Further, we explored the 
correlation between 5-HT levels in hippocampus and amygdala and long-term 
cognitive behaviors and anxiety behaviors in the AD mice using linear regression 
analysis. Our results demonstrated that there was close linear correlation 
between 5-HT level in brain and spatial cognition and anxiety behavior of 
APP/PS1 transgene mice. 5-HT influences spatial learning and memory by 
regulating the synaptic plasticity in hippocampus of APP/PS1 transgenic mice. 
These results indicate that 5-HT might be potentially beneficial in the 
treatment of AD.

BackgroundVentricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was analysed peri- and 
postoperatively to elucidate the pathophysiology of Idiopathic normal pressure 
hydrocephalus (iNPH).ObjectiveTo capture the dynamics of biomarkers and their 
relation to clinical symptoms.MethodsIn 113 consecutively diagnosed patients, 
the Hellström iNPH scale was used to quantify symptom burden pre- and 
postoperatively. CSF was collected at shunt insertion and postoperatively by 
shunt reservoir puncture, and analyzed for concentrations of GFAP, YKL40, MCP-1, 
NfL, Aβ40, sAβPPα, sAβPPβ, GAP43, Alzheimer's disease biomarkers Aβ42, Aβ42/40, 
total tau (T-tau), phosphorylated tau (P-tau), and 
neurogranin.ResultsConcentrations increased postoperatively for Aβ40 (134%), 
Aβ42 (106%), sAβPPα (112%), sAβPPβ (83%), NfL (128%), YKL40 (86%), GAP43 (124%), 
and MCP-1 (5%) (p < 0.001, MCP-1 (p = 0.03)), while mean concentration 
reductions were seen in T-tau (32%), GFAP (31%), neurogranin (49%), and Aβ42/40 
(10%) (p < 0.001). A higher perioperative concentration of AβPPβ correlated with 
less pronounced gait disturbance (Rp 0.20 (0.01-0.38) (95% CI)), whereas higher 
levels of NfL (-0.23 (-0.41-(-)0.04) and MCP-1 (-0.21 (-0.37-(-)0.01)) 
correlated with impaired cognition. Higher MCP-1 correlated with a lower balance 
domain score (-0.20 (-0.37-(-)0.01)). Postoperative increases in levels of Aβ40 
(Rs 0.27 (0.05-0.46)), Aβ42 (Rs 0.24 (0.02-0.44)) and YKL40 (Rs 0.22 
(-0.00-0.43)) correlated with gait improvement, and a postoperative increase in 
Aβ40 (Rs 0.36 (0.05-0.60)) was associated with improvement in urinary continence 
(p 0.01-0.05).ConclusionsCSF biomarker concentrations change after shunt 
insertion. These changes, seen as increased concentrations for some biomarkers 
and decreased concentrations for others, are associated with improvement in core 
clinical symptoms and may illustrate reversibility of pathophysiological 
mechanisms in iNPH.

The term "amyloid-removal-related pseudo-atrophy" has recently been proposed for 
the accelerated brain volume loss caused by anti-Alzheimer's antibody therapies, 
although most trials seem to neglect it. As with 'amyloid-related imaging 
abnormalities' (ARIAs), this is downplaying yet another side effect of passive 
antibody therapy that cannot be justified until its impact on brain function is 
fully understood. ARIAs and accelerated volume loss are likely due to 
antibody-induced brain tissue damage, making amyloid-PET imaging an unreliable 
indicator of amyloid removal. Therefore, approval of antibody therapy based on 
presumed amyloid removal should be suspended until this looming possibility has 
been fully investigated.

The demand for genetic testing and counseling services continues to grow as 
there is a utility to guide diagnosis and treatment for a range of genetic 
conditions. Genetic counseling (GC) is a medical practice that provides 
information and counseling to patients and relatives at risk of recurrence of a 
genetic disease and helps them understand and adapt to the medical, 
psychological, and familial implications of the genetic information of the 
disease. Health professionals working in this field need reliable measurement 
tools to evaluate the results of their interventions, intending to ensure 
quality service improvements and planning successful disease management 
strategies. The Genetic Counseling Outcome Scale (GCOS-24) is a brief 
self-reported questionnaire of 24 questions administered to assess GC 
interventions and the outcomes of the use of these services in patients and 
caregivers of individuals with genetic diseases. It has been translated and 
validated in many languages, but not in the Greek language, despite the 
increased need for GC services in Greece. Thus, the questionnaire was translated 
into Modern Greek, and the reverse translation method was followed. 257 people 
participated in the research (63.6% women, 67.8% between 20 and 40 years, 45.9% 
University education of a high educational level). The construct validity of the 
questionnaire was examined through exploratory factor analysis and internal 
consistency through Cronbach's alpha. A significant difference in GCOS from the 
original scale is the fewer items-19 as opposed to 24. Greek GCOS is constructed 
of a two-factor structure and is a reliable tool (α = 0.79) for assessing 
patient empowerment in GC. With empowerment serving as an end measure, as it is 
focused on patient-centered care, this study adds to the international 
validation process of the GCOS-24 with the eventual objective of utilizing this 
instrument as a PROM to assess and enhance the services of GC in diverse 
clinical genetics settings.

INTRODUCTION: Accurately assessing the temporal order of cognitive decline 
across multiple domains is critical in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Existing 
literature presents controversial conclusions likely due to the use of a single 
cohort and different analytical strategies.
METHODS: Harmonized composite cognitive measures in memory, language, and 
executive functions from 13 cohorts in the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing 
Project Phenotype Harmonization Consortium (ADSP-PHC) were used. A double 
anchoring events-based sigmoidal mixed model was developed using time to 
incident AD diagnosis as the time scale.
RESULTS: In general, decline in memory occurred before decline in language, 
followed by decline in executive function. This temporal order generally 
persisted within each subgroup of apolipoprotein E ε4 carrier status, sex, and 
race/ethnicity.
DISCUSSION: This study demonstrated the use of harmonized data across multiple 
cohorts to characterize the temporal order of cognitive decline along AD 
progression. Using time to incident AD diagnosis as the time scale can enhance 
research reproducibility and clinical practice.
HIGHLIGHTS: Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project Phenotype Harmonization 
Consortium's harmonized composite cognitive measures from 13 cohort studies 
fitted with a novel double anchoring event-based sigmoidal mixed model reveal 
the following temporal order of cognitive decline toward AD progression: memory, 
language, and executive function. If only investigated using individual cohort 
studies, the temporal order of cognitive decline would vary due to the 
underlying heterogeneities across studies. This temporal order generally 
persisted within each subgroup of apolipoprotein E ε4 carrier status, sex, and 
race/ethnicity.

INTRODUCTION: The rising prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias 
(ADRD) in California's aging population necessitates a well-trained dementia 
care workforce.
METHODS: This study evaluated a multi-week, competency-based, online training 
for caregivers in California's Medicaid-funded In-Home Supportive Services 
(IHSS) program. Using a quasi-experimental design, we assessed caregivers' 
dementia knowledge, self-efficacy, distress, depression, and care recipients' 
healthcare use before and after the intervention.
RESULTS: The training significantly improved caregivers' dementia knowledge and 
self-efficacy but did not reduce caregivers' distress and depression, nor 
decrease care recipients' emergency room visits and hospitalizations.
DISCUSSION: The findings highlight the value of specialized dementia training in 
enhancing caregiver knowledge and skills, which could be implemented outside 
California. Clinical implications include bolstering caregiver well-being to 
improve the quality of their support of care recipients with cognitive 
impairment. Policy implications include expanding access to training programs 
and bolstering workforce development initiatives that improve caregiver and care 
recipient outcomes.
HIGHLIGHTS: Multiweek online training improved home care workers' dementia 
caregiving skills. Home care workers' dementia knowledge improved significantly 
post-training. Self-efficacy to manage care recipients' dementia symptoms 
improved significantly.

INTRODUCTION: As life expectancy improves for people with Down syndrome (DS) in 
Africa, the risk of developing DS-associated Alzheimer's disease (DSAD) will 
rise. There is a pressing need to plan for this emerging challenge, particularly 
in the context of existing health and social disparities.
METHODS: This work emerged from a pan-African collaboration, including 
discussions at the Brain Ageing and Dementia in Low- and Middle-Income Countries 
conference held in Nairobi in 2024, where stakeholders identified regional 
priorities for DS and dementia care.
RESULTS: Limited epidemiological, cognitive, biomarker data, delayed diagnoses, 
and gaps in specialized services may impact access to care. However, innovative 
solutions, such as mobile biomarker sampling and culturally adapted cognitive 
assessments, offer promising strategies.
DISCUSSION: Integrating global advances in DSAD research with Africa's strengths 
in community-based care offers opportunities. By prioritizing research, capacity 
building, and health system integration, this work advocates for the inclusion 
of DS in Africa's dementia strategies.
HIGHLIGHTS: Projected increases in life expectancy for individuals with Down 
syndrome (DS) in Africa will lead to a substantial rise in DS-associated 
Alzheimer's disease (DSAD), necessitating urgent planning and response. There is 
a critical lack of epidemiological, cognitive, and biomarker data on adults with 
DS in Africa, hindering accurate diagnosis, care planning, and inclusion in 
global research. Innovative, scalable solutions-such as mobile biomarker 
sampling and culturally adapted cognitive assessments-offer an opportunity to 
integrate scientific advances with Africa's strengths in community-based care. 
Investment in research and capacity building is essential to address current 
gaps, reduce disparities, and ensure equitable access to emerging diagnostics 
and treatments for DSAD across the continent.

Neurodegenerative dementias including Alzheimer disease severely impair 
cognitive and social abilities and are a major cause of mortality with no causal 
treatment yet. Autoimmune mechanisms have been increasingly considered to 
contribute to disease progression, e.g. by enhancing protein misfolding or 
pro-inflammatory immune responses. Understanding this contribution may lead to 
novel treatment options beyond removing neurodegeneration-associated proteins. 
We hypothesized that CD4+ TH cells against synaptic proteins may play a role in 
dementia, given the profound changes of synaptic proteins in the disease. We 
investigated TH cell frequencies and phenotypes after antigen-reactive T cell 
enrichment (ARTE) using three important synaptic antigens known to play a role 
in cognitive function, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptor (NMDAR), Leucine-rich, 
glioma inactivated 1 (LGI1) and metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5). Our 
data revealed that synaptic autoantigen-specific TH cells occurred in all 
cohorts and were similarly frequent in patients with dementia and sex- and 
age-matched controls. However, they were significantly reduced compared to young 
healthy subjects, indicating strong age-related effects ('immune senescence'). 
Compared to the ubiquitously available Candida albicans antigen, synaptic 
autoantigen-specific TH cell responses were strongly driven by IFNγ-producing T 
cells, expression of which markedly decreased with age. Patients with dementia 
had significantly less IL-17-producing synaptic autoantigen-specific TH cells 
than aged healthy controls. This first direct ex vivo quantitative and 
qualitative analysis of circulating T cells autoreactive to three synaptic 
autoantigens in dementia shows no correlation with cognitive impairment. It 
suggests that synaptic autoantigen-specific TH cells decline with age and are 
not a major driver of dementia development.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder marked by 
β-amyloid (βA) accumulation, neuroinflammation, excessive synaptic pruning, and 
cognitive decline. Despite extensive research, effective treatments remain 
elusive. Here, we identify potassium channel-interacting protein 3 (KChIP3) as a 
key driver of AD pathology using the 5XFAD mouse model. KChIP3 levels were 
significantly elevated in the hippocampus of 5XFAD mice, correlating with βA 
burden and neuroinflammation. This upregulation was triggered by inflammatory 
signaling via the NLRP3 inflammasome and Caspase-1 activation. Notably, genetic 
deletion of KChIP3 (5XFAD/KChIP3-/-) markedly reduced βA plaque deposition, 
pro-inflammatory cytokines, reactive gliosis, and expression of 
inflammation-related proteins (APO, CLU, MDK). Transcriptomic and proteomic 
analyses revealed restored synaptic markers (CD47, CD200, CACNB4, GDA) and a 
shift of the disease-associated microglial (DAM-1) phenotype. Mechanistically, 
we propose that KChIP3 amplifies AD pathology through two key mechanisms: (1) 
sustaining neuroinflammation by upregulating pro-inflammatory genes and (2) 
impairing synaptic integrity by repressing genes critical for neuronal function. 
Consistently, KChIP3 deletion enhanced dendritic complexity, synaptic 
plasticity, and cognitive performance in 5XFAD mice. These findings position 
KChIP3 as a potential therapeutic target for mitigating neuroinflammation and 
synaptic dysfunction in AD and highlight its potential as a biomarker for 
disease progression.

Amyloid-β-directed monoclonal antibody therapies may lead to amyloid-related 
imaging abnormalities (ARIA). Clinical trials that formed the basis for the ARIA 
radiographic severity grading scale adopted by the approved drugs' labels 
utilized T2* gradient recalled echo (T2*-GRE) images for ARIA-hemorrhagic 
(ARIA-H) assessment. Little is known about the application of 
susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) to ARIA-H assessment. We exploited 
comparative studies on the usage of SWI instead of 2D T2*-GRE and simulated the 
impact of SWI's higher sensitivity on the derived ARIA-H severity distribution 
for three approved drugs. The simulations indicated that the two sequences are 
not equivalent when grading ARIA-H severity and that the rate of therapy 
discontinuation would increase by more than 50% compared to the rates reported 
in the drugs' prescribing information. This should be taken into consideration 
whenever SWI is applied for ARIA safety monitoring. Appropriate imaging 
guidelines are needed to enhance management of amyloid-β-directed antibody 
therapies.

BACKGROUND: Previous proteomic work has identified the somatodendritic protein 
MAP2 as a new candidate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker for amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis (ALS).
METHODS: We measured CSF levels of MAP2 and neurofilament light chain (NFL) in a 
retrospective cohort of 251 patients with ALS and 108 neurological controls 
(NCs).
RESULTS: Patients with ALS had a higher median CSF MAP2 level compared with NCs, 
leading to an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.7080 (p<0.0001). They also had a 
higher median CSF NFL level (p<0.0001), resulting in an excellent diagnostic 
performance (AUC=0.9641; p<0.0001). Among patients with ALS, CSF MAP2 correlated 
with disease progression rate (DPR) (r=0.3099; p<0.0001) and was negatively 
associated with survival (HR=3.174). CSF NFL also correlated with DPR (r=0.4936; 
p<0.0001) and was negatively associated with survival (HR=2.759). The 
association of MAP2 with DPR was independent from NFL (p=0.0037). Stratifying 
patients based on median levels of both biomarkers resulted in significant 
differences in median survival times (low NFL/low MAP2, 66 months; high NFL/low 
MAP2 and vice versa, 35 months; high NFL/high MAP2, 26 months; p<0.0001). MAP2 
was also associated with genetic status in patients with ALS, as patients with 
no mutations in C9ORF72 or in SOD1, as well as C9ORF72-positive ones, had higher 
median levels compared with NCs (p<0.0001), while patients with SOD1 mutations 
did not significantly differ from NCs (p>0.9999).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that the somatodendritic protein MAP2 is a

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha is a member of the nuclear 
hormone receptor superfamily and functions as a transcription factor involved in 
regulating cellular metabolism. Previous studies have shown that PPARα plays a 
key role in the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. 
Consequently, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha agonists have 
garnered increasing attention as potential treatments for neurological 
disorders. This review aims to clarify the research progress regarding 
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha in nervous system diseases. 
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha is present in all cell types 
within adult mouse and adult neural tissues. Although it is conventionally 
believed to be primarily localized in the nucleus, its function may be regulated 
by a dynamic balance between cytoplasmic and nuclear shuttling. Both endogenous 
and exogenous peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha agonists bind to 
the peroxisome proliferator-activated response element to exert their biological 
effects. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha plays a significant 
therapeutic role in neurodegenerative diseases. For instance, peroxisome 
proliferator-activated receptor alpha agonist gemfibrozil has been shown to 
reduce levels of soluble and insoluble amyloid-beta in the hippocampus of 
Alzheimer's disease mouse models through the autophagy-lysosomal pathway. 
Additionally, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha is essential for 
the normal development and functional maintenance of the substantia nigra, and 
it can mitigate motor dysfunction in Parkinson's disease mouse models. 
Furthermore, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha has been found to 
reduce neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in various neurological diseases. 
In summary, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha plays a crucial 
role in the onset and progression of multiple nervous system diseases, and 
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha agonists hold promise as new 
therapeutic agents for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, providing 
new options for patient care.

In Alzheimer's disease, microglial phagocytosis is engaged in the pathogenesis 
as it clears abnormal protein accumulations, debris, and apoptotic cells in the 
early stages of Alzheimer's disease, but fuels neuroinflammation and accelerates 
disease progression in later stages. In vivo parabiosis experiments in aged 
animals have demonstrated that blood-born factors modulate synaptic plasticity, 
neurogenesis, and microglial responses. We hypothesize that peripheral factors 
can modulate microglial function and thereby possibly influence Alzheimer's 
disease pathology. The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of 
Alzheimer's disease serum on microglial phagocytosis. Here, we use an 
immortalized human microglial cell line in an in vitro parabiosis assay to 
investigate the impact of the serum from individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer's 
disease ( n = 30) and age-matched controls ( n = 30) (PRODEM study) on 
microglial phagocytosis. Exposure to Alzheimer's disease serum increased 
microglial phagocytic uptake of pH-sensitive fluorescent particles and 
downregulated expression of the lysosomal master regulator transcription factor 
EB ( TFEB ) and of ATPase H + transporting lysosomal V1 subunit B2 ( ATP6V1B2 ), 
a component of the vacuolar ATPase. To identify serum components that may relate 
to changes in phagocytosis, serum samples of the Three-City Study (3C Study) 
were used. In the 3C Study, blood samples were collected up to 12 years before 
the onset of cognitive decline or dementia and their serum metabolome is 
well-defined. Microglia exposed to the serum of future Alzheimer's disease 
patients from the 3C Study displayed an increased phagocytic uptake compared 
with the serum of matched controls, depending on the presence of the 
apolipoprotein E ε4 allele in the Alzheimer's disease patients. Furthermore, 
microglial phagocytosis correlated inversely with serum levels of the omega-3 
fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid. We confirmed this inverse correlation between 
eicosapentaenoic acid and phagocytosis in the serum samples of the PRODEM 
cohort. In addition, in vitro testing of eicosapentaenoic acid on microglial 
phagocytosis showed a concentration-dependent decrease in phagocytic uptake. In 
conclusion, following incubation with Alzheimer's disease blood serum, we 
observed increased microglial phagocytic uptake and the downregulation of TFEB 
and ATP6V1B2 , possibly indicating lysosomal dysfunction. Furthermore, 
microglial phagocytosis was inversely correlated with serum eicosapentaenoic 
acid levels, suggesting an important role for dietary eicosapentaenoic acid in 
microglial function.

Neuroinflammation contributes to a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases 
including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and 
multiple sclerosis. It is driven by non-neuronal glial cells, mainly microglia 
and astrocytes. Microglia are the resident immune cells of the central nervous 
system, while astrocytes are the main support cells for neuronal functions but 
can also participate in neuroimmune responses. Both these glial cell types can 
become reactive upon detection of certain endogenous intracellular molecules 
that appear in the extracellular space under specific circumstances; these can 
be pathology-associated abnormal structures, such as amyloid β proteins, or 
damage-associated molecular patterns released from injured cells, including 
their mitochondria. Once in the extracellular space, damage-associated molecular 
patterns act as ligands for specific pattern recognition receptors expressed by 
glia inducing their reactivity and neuroimmune responses. This review considers 
the following mitochondrial damage-associated molecular patterns: heme, 
cytochrome c, cardiolipin, adenosine triphosphate, mitochondrial DNA, 
mitochondrial transcription factor A, N-formyl peptides, and the tricarboxylic 
acid cycle metabolites: succinate, fumarate, and itaconate. We describe their 
well-established functions as damage-associated molecular patterns of the 
peripheral tissues before summarizing available evidence indicating these 
molecules may also play significant roles in the neuroimmune processes of the 
central nervous system. We highlight the pattern recognition receptors that 
mitochondrial damage-associated molecular patterns interact with and the 
cellular signaling mechanisms they modulate. Our review demonstrates that some 
mitochondrial damage-associated molecular patterns, such as cytochrome c, 
adenosine triphosphate, and mitochondrial transcription factor A, have already 
demonstrated significant effects on the central nervous system. In contrast, 
others including cardiolipin, mitochondrial DNA, N-formyl peptides, succinate, 
fumarate, and itaconate, will require additional studies corroborating their 
roles as damage-associated molecular patterns in the central nervous system. For 
all of the reviewed mitochondrial damage-associated molecular patterns, there is 
a shortage of studies using human cells and tissues, which is identified as a 
significant knowledge gap. We also assess the need for targeted research on the 
effects of mitochondrial damage-associated molecular patterns in the central 
nervous system pathologies where their roles are understudied. Such studies 
could identify novel treatment strategies for multiple neurodegenerative 
diseases, which are characterized by chronic neuroinflammation and currently 
lack effective therapies.

Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of cognitive disorder, and there is 
an urgent need to develop more effective, targeted and safer therapies for 
patients with this condition. Deep brain stimulation is an invasive surgical 
treatment that modulates abnormal neural activity by implanting electrodes into 
specific brain areas followed by electrical stimulation. As an emerging 
therapeutic approach, deep brain stimulation shows significant promise as a 
potential new therapy for Alzheimer's disease. Here, we review the potential 
mechanisms and therapeutic effects of deep brain stimulation in the treatment of 
Alzheimer's disease based on existing clinical and basic research. In clinical 
studies, the most commonly targeted sites include the fornix, the nucleus 
basalis of Meynert, and the ventral capsule/ventral striatum. Basic research has 
found that the most frequently targeted areas include the fornix, nucleus 
basalis of Meynert, hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and rostral intralaminar 
thalamic nucleus. All of these individual targets exhibit therapeutic potential 
for patients with Alzheimer's disease and associated mechanisms of action have 
been investigated. Deep brain stimulation may exert therapeutic effects on 
Alzheimer's disease through various mechanisms, including reducing the 
deposition of amyloid-β, activation of the cholinergic system, increasing the 
levels of neurotrophic factors, enhancing synaptic activity and plasticity, 
promoting neurogenesis, and improving glucose metabolism. Currently, clinical 
trials investigating deep brain stimulation for Alzheimer's disease remain 
insufficient. In the future, it is essential to focus on translating preclinical 
mechanisms into clinical trials. Furthermore, consecutive follow-up studies are 
needed to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of deep brain stimulation 
for Alzheimer's disease, including cognitive function, neuropsychiatric 
symptoms, quality of life and changes in Alzheimer's disease biomarkers. 
Researchers must also prioritize the initiation of multi-center clinical trials 
of deep brain stimulation with large sample sizes and target earlier therapeutic 
windows, such as the prodromal and even the preclinical stages of Alzheimer's 
disease. Adopting these approaches will permit the efficient exploration of more 
effective and safer deep brain stimulation therapies for patients with 
Alzheimer's disease.

Neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative illnesses constitute a global health 
issue and a foremost economic burden since they are a large cause of incapacity 
and death worldwide. Altogether, the burden of neurological disorders has 
increased considerably over the past 30 years because of population aging. 
Overall, neurological diseases significantly impair cognitive and motor 
functions and their incidence will increase as societies age and the world's 
population continues to grow. Autism spectrum disorder, motor neuron disease, 
encephalopathy, epilepsy, stroke, ataxia, Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease represent a 
non-exhaustive list of neurological illnesses. These affections are due to 
perturbations in cellular homeostasis leading to the progressive injury and 
death of neurons in the nervous system. Among the common features of 
neurological handicaps, we find protein aggregation, oxidative stress, 
neuroinflammation, and mitochondrial impairment in the target tissues, e.g., the 
brain, cerebellum, and spinal cord. The high energy requirements of neurons and 
their inability to produce sufficient adenosine triphosphate by glycolysis, are 
responsible for their dependence on functional mitochondria for their integrity. 
Reactive oxygen species, produced along with the respiration process within 
mitochondria, can lead to oxidative stress, which compromises neuronal survival. 
Besides having an essential role in energy production and oxidative stress, 
mitochondria are indispensable for an array of cellular processes, such as amino 
acid metabolism, iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis, calcium homeostasis, 
intrinsic programmed cell death (apoptosis), and intraorganellar signaling. 
Despite the progress made in the last decades in the understanding of a growing 
number of genetic and molecular causes of central nervous diseases, therapies 
that are effective to diminish or halt neuronal dysfunction/death are rare. 
Given the genetic complexity responsible for neurological disorders, the 
development of neuroprotective strategies seeking to preserve mitochondrial 
homeostasis is a realistic challenge to lastingly diminish the harmful evolution 
of these pathologies and so to recover quality of life. A promising candidate is 
the neuroglobin, a globin superfamily member of 151 amino acids, which is found 
at high levels in the brain, the eye, and the cerebellum. The protein, which 
localizes to mitochondria, is involved in electron transfer, oxygen storage and 
defence against oxidative stress; hence, possessing neuroprotective properties. 
This review surveys up-to-date knowledge and emphasizes on existing 
investigations regarding neuroglobin physiological functions, which remain since 
its discovery in 2000 under intense debate and the possibility of using 
neuroglobin either by gene therapy or its direct delivery into the brain to 
treat neurological disorders.

by enhancing neutrophil mitocytosis.

Current treatments for cerebral amyloid angiopathy are mainly symptomatic and 
have limited efficacy, and there is a lack of targeted therapies. Mesenchymal 
stem cell transplantation improves cognitive and motor function in conditions 
such as Alzheimer's disease, acute ischemic stroke, and Parkinson's disease. In 
addition, mesenchymal stem cell therapy modulates the immune system, reduces 
neuroinflammation, and improves resolution of brain lesions by cells of the 
macrophage lineage. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy and Alzheimer's disease share 
similar pathologic changes involving amyloid-beta deposition, which contributes 
to the progression of both diseases and exacerbates cognitive deficits through 
impaired vascular integrity and neuroinflammation. Therefore, we hypothesized 
that mesenchymal stem cell therapy could also ameliorate the pathological 
changes seen in cerebral amyloid angiopathy by modulating the immune response. 
In this study, we show that bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells have a protective 
effect in a mouse model of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (Tg-SwDI/B). Bone marrow 
mesenchymal stem cell treatment improved cognitive function, reduced 
neuroinflammation, and maintained blood-brain barrier integrity in Tg-SwDI/B 
mice. Mechanistically, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell treatment enhanced the 
expulsion of damaged mitochondria from neutrophils via migrasomes, in a process 
known as mitocytosis, thereby preserving mitochondrial quality within the 
neutrophils. Mitochondrial damage in neutrophils leads to cellular injury, 
including the generation of reactive oxygen species and the formation of 
neutrophil extracellular traps. Neutrophils activate mitocytosis to promote 
mitochondrial renewal, which further enhances their own clearance by macrophage 
lineage cells. Our findings demonstrate that bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells 
are a promising therapeutic candidate for cerebral amyloid angiopathy, as they 
play a significant role in migrasome-dependent mitochondrial quality control in 
neutrophils.

Metabolic breakdown: Linking insulin resistance and mitochondrial dysfunction to 
neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease.

and Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.

The increasing prevalence of metabolic disorders and neurodegenerative diseases 
has uncovered shared pathophysiological pathways, with insulin resistance and 
mitochondrial dysfunction emerging as critical contributors to cognitive 
decline. Insulin resistance impairs neuronal metabolism and synaptic function, 
fostering neurodegeneration as observed in Alzheimer's disease and Down 
syndrome. Indeed, Down syndrome, characterized by the triplication of the APP 
gene, represents a valuable genetic model for studying early-onset Alzheimer's 
disease and accelerated aging. Building on the link between metabolic 
dysfunctions and neurodegeneration, innovative strategies addressed brain 
insulin resistance as a key driver of cognitive decline. Intranasal insulin has 
shown promise in improving cognition in early Alzheimer's disease and type 2 
diabetes, supporting the concept that restoring insulin sensitivity can mitigate 
neurodegeneration. However, insulin-based therapies risk desensitizing insulin 
signaling, potentially worsening the disease. Incretins, particularly 
glucagonlike peptide 1 receptor agonists, offer neuroprotective benefits by 
enhancing insulin sensitivity, metabolism, and synaptic plasticity while 
reducing oxidative distress and neuroinflammation. This review focuses on 
current knowledge on the metabolic and molecular interactions between insulin 
resistance, mitochondrial dynamics (including their roles in energy metabolism), 
and oxidative distress regulation, as these are pivotal in both Alzheimer's 
disease and Down syndrome. By addressing these interconnected mechanisms, 
innovative treatments may emerge for both metabolic and neurodegenerative 
disorders.

Neurodegenerative diseases are a group of illnesses characterized by the gradual 
deterioration of the central nervous system, leading to a decline in patients' 
cognitive, motor, and emotional abilities. Neuroinflammation plays a significant 
role in the progression of these diseases. However, there is limited research on 
therapeutic approaches to specifically target neuroinflammation. The role of T 
lymphocytes, which are crucial mediators of the adaptive immune response, in 
neurodegenerative diseases has been increasingly recognized. This review focuses 
on the involvement of T lymphocytes in the neuroinflammation associated with 
neurodegenerative diseases. The pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases is 
complex, involving multiple mechanisms and pathways that contribute to the 
gradual degeneration of neurons, and T cells are a key component of these 
processes. One of the primary factors driving neuroinflammation in 
neurodegenerative diseases is the infiltration of T cells and other neuroimmune 
cells, including microglia, astrocytes, B cells, and natural killer cells. 
Different subsets of CD4 + T cells, such as Th1, Th2, Th17, and regulatory T 
cells, can differentiate into various cell types and perform distinct roles 
within the neuroinflammatory environment of neurodegenerative diseases. 
Additionally, CD8 + T cells, which can directly regulate immune responses and 
kill target cells, also play several important roles in neurodegenerative 
diseases. Clinical trials investigating targeted T cell therapies for 
neurodegenerative diseases have shown that, while some patients respond 
positively, others may not respond as well and may even experience adverse 
effects. Targeting T cells precisely is challenging due to the complexity of 
immune responses in the central nervous system, which can lead to undesirable 
side effects. However, with new insights into the pathophysiology of 
neurodegenerative diseases, there is hope for the establishment of a solid 
theoretical foundation upon which innovative treatment strategies that target T 
cells can be developed in the future.

Amid the rising relevance of early and non-invasive markers for 
neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, this study addresses 
the relationship between two promising candidates: electrophysiology and plasma 
markers. Specifically, functional connectivity, which underlies cognitive 
function, with p-tau231 (i.e., a marker of incipient Aβ pathology) and 
neurofilament light chain (NfL, i.e., a neurodegeneration marker) were 
considered. Seventy-five cognitively unimpaired individuals underwent a blood 
extraction and two magnetoencephalography recordings, approximately 3 years 
apart. First, correlation analyses were conducted to examine the association 
between the pathology markers' concentration and FC. Subsequently, longitudinal 
FC changes were assessed, and their relationship with the markers' concentration 
was evaluated. Default mode network regions, including the middle temporal 
gyrus, precuneus, hippocampus, and inferior parietal lobe, presented a positive 
association between their alpha FC and p-tau231 positively. In contrast, NfL 
levels were negatively associated with theta FC in frontotemporal regions. 
Moreover, these areas exhibit a longitudinal theta FC decrease. Importantly, the 
theta FC reduction was more pronounced as NfL concentrations increased. The 
described alpha FC alterations do not follow a maturation trajectory and are 
age-independent. Thus, the alpha FC increase associated with p-tau231 levels 
could constitute an early electrophysiological biomarker of Aβ pathology. In 
contrast, the longitudinal theta FC decrease, enhanced by NfL, could constitute

Olfactory impairment is a recognized early indicator of neurodegenerative 
diseases (NDs), such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Intracellular aggregates of 
hyperphosphorylated tau protein, referred to as neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), 
are a hallmark of AD. NFTs are found in the olfactory bulb (OB) and entorhinal 
cortex (EC), both crucial for processing olfactory information. We explored the 
hypothesis that typical tau lesions could appear early and progress along 
olfactory regions to reach connected areas critically affected in AD (e.g., EC 
and hippocampal formation). To that end, we used transgenic PS19 mice expressing 
mutated human tau protein (1N4R isoform, P301S mutation). They recapitulate 
major phenotypes of AD, such as accumulation of NFTs, synaptic dysfunction, 
cognitive impairment, and neuronal loss. The presence of pathological 
hyperphosphorylated human tau protein (pTau) was monitored in olfactory regions: 
olfactory epithelium (OE), OB, piriform cortex (PC), and in connected regions of 
the hippocampal formation (hippocampus and EC). pTau was detected in the OE's 
middle stratum and in the OB's olfactory nerve layer (ONL) at 1.5 months. At 
6 months of age, tau accumulations were found in the PC and EC, along with the 
CA3 region and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. We found that olfactory 
function remained unaffected in PS19 mice, despite the presence of tau pathology 
in key regions of the olfactory system. Targeted treatments (ZnSO4 and AAVs) 
were applied at the OE level to assess the impact on tau pathology in the CNS. 
Complete stripping of the OE by intranasal administration of ZnSO4 led to a 
significant reduction in pretangle-like tau pathology within the PC, amygdala, 
and EC of 6-month-old PS19 mice. Finally, we observed in human postmortem 
samples that pTau signal was present in the olfactory regions (OE and OB) of 
patients at early Braak stages (I/II). Based on these observations, we propose 
that pTau could appear, due to aging or environmental agents, in the OE and 
subsequently spread in a prion-like manner to the hippocampal formation along 
neuroanatomical connections. These findings also indicate the interest of the OE 
as a target for intervention aimed at mitigating the progression of tauopathy in 
the CNS.

Neuroinflammation has been described as one of the multiple clinical 
manifestations of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases (PD and AD). Moreover, it 
was reported that amyloid-β deposition is associated with cognitive decline in 
PD. Here, Cola acuminata (CA) extract was used to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome in 
THP-1 macrophages in vitro. CA showed significant anti-inflammatory effect by 
inhibiting nitric oxide (NO) release from cells after stimulation with LPS and 
Nigericin. Phagocytosis of amyloid-β by THP-1 cells showed that at 100 µg/ml, CA 
increases phagocytic activity of macrophages in vitro. Moreover, activation of 
NLRP3 inflammasome and subsequent treatment with CA showed a reduction of IL1-β 
and IL-18 cytokines release in ELISA assay. Furthermore, NLRP3, caspase-1, IL1-β 
and NF-kB expressions were significantly inhibited at the gene and protein 
levels as shown by RTqPCR and western blot assays respectively. Interestingly, 
colocalization analysis of activated inflammasome confirmed our results 
suggesting that CA disaggregates inflammasome assembly. Mass spectrometry 
analysis of CA has identified epicatechin, catechin, chlorogenic acid, quercetin 
and stigmasterol known as inflammasome inhibitors among the extract chemical 
constituents. Together, our results indicate that CA can inhibit inflammasome 
activation in macrophage, thereby opening future perspectives for PD treatment.

Aegle marmelos (L.) Corrêa, commonly known as the bael fruit tree, is a member 
of the Rutaceae family and holds significance in Ayurvedic herbal medicine due 
to its myriad therapeutic properties. This paper seeks to delve into the diverse 
benefits offered by the bael fruit tree, exploring various plant parts, 
including leaves, fruit, bark, and seeds, all of which contain bioactive 
compounds with therapeutic potential. The bael fruit, with its diverse 
phytochemical profile, exhibits potential health benefits ranging from 
radioprotection and antibacterial properties to antioxidant and hepatoprotective 
effects. Additionally, this review highlights the limited preclinical studies on 
AMs' efficacy in treating neurological disorders, emphasizing the need for more 
clinical trials to validate its potency and safety. Specifically, the effects 
and mechanisms of AM extract in addressing Alzheimer's disease, anxiety, 
depression, epilepsy and Parkinson's disease are explored. In conclusion, AM 
emerges as a plant of considerable nutritional and pharmacological value, with 
the potential to contribute significantly to the treatment of neurological 
disorders. Despite its promising attributes, the limited preclinical studies 
necessitate further clinical trials to confirm its efficacy. This review 
consolidates relevant studies, offering insights into AMs' ethnobotany, chemical 
constituents, pharmacological properties and potential application in 
neurological disorders. The comprehensive examination underscores the need for 
continued research to unlock the full therapeutic potential of this versatile 
plant.

Background: C. religiosa has traditionally been applied to treat heart disease, 
chronic weight loss, improved digestion, memory loss, convulsion and epilepsy, 
psychological problems, and neurologic pains. Purpose: Prior studies have 
already elucidated the potential therapeutic effects of C. religiosa. However, 
in this work, the bark extract of C. religiosa was studied systematically to 
investigate its antioxidant, anticholinesterase, and antiproliferative 
activities, focusing on potential applications in treating Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) and cancer. Study Design and Methods: The dried coarse powder of C. 
religiosa bark was cold-extracted in methanol and evaporated to dryness. It was 
then successively fractionated into petroleum ether (PEF), dichloromethane 
(DMF), and ethyl acetate (EEF) fractions. The Folin-Ciocalteu reagent and AlCl3 
approaches were utilized to evaluate the total phenol and flavonoid contents, 
respectively, and the DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) and phosphomolybdenum 
assays were employed to determine the antioxidant activity of each fraction. The 
DMF was tested against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase 
(BChE) by employing the Ellman method, while all fractions were tested for 
antiproliferative activity against HepG2 and A549 cell lines by MTT assay. 
Results: The DMF displayed the highest phenolic content (124.8 ± 17.5 mg gallic 
acid equivalent/g of dry extract) and flavonoid content (211.1 ± 4.8 mg 
quercetin equivalent/g of dry extract). In the phosphomolybdenum assay, its 
antioxidant IC50 value was 25 ± 1 µg/mL. Additionally, the DMF fraction 
exhibited significant inhibition activity against AChE and BChE, with IC50 
values of 455 ± 1 and 450 ± 1 μg/mL, respectively. In terms of 
anti-proliferative activity, the DMF exhibited an IC50 value of 29.2 µM against 
the HepG2 cell line, while the EAF showed IC50 values of 24.7 µM in the A549 
cell line. Conclusion: The potent activity of C. religiosa as an antioxidant, 
along with its significant inhibition of AChE and BChE, positions it as a 
promising candidate for Alzheimer's disease treatment. Furthermore, its robust 
inhibition of human liver and lung cancer cells suggests its potential as a 
therapeutic agent against cancer.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Dementia leads to substantial social and economic impacts 
in older adults. Due to the unprecedented rate of population aging, the number 
of dementia cases has increased in South Korea. Managing risk factors is crucial 
for delaying or preventing the progression of dementia, as existing treatments 
have uncertain effectiveness. Despite the importance of health behaviors in 
maintaining cognitive function and the well-known association between cognitive 
decline and dementia, research regarding preventive health behaviors for 
dementia is limited. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the effects of 
social activity on dementia in older South Koreans.
METHODS: Data from the 2018 and 2020 Korean Longitudinal Study of Ageing 
(n = 6156 older Koreans) were included in this study. Social activity was the 
primary independent variable. The dependent variable was the presence of 
Alzheimer's or vascular dementia or dementia due to brain tumors or 
hypothyroidism. A Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was performed.
RESULTS: Individuals who did not participate in any social activities had a 
significantly higher risk of developing dementia than those who were socially 
active (hazard ratio: 2.36; 95% confidence interval = 1.29-4.32). Younger 
participants exhibited a lower risk of dementia than participants > 75 years of 
age. The beneficial effects of social activity were more pronounced among urban 
participants.
CONCLUSION: Engagement in at least one social activity significantly reduced the 
risk of dementia among older adults. These data will be helpful for the 
formulation of future public health policies and preventive strategies in Korea.

PURPOSE: High temporal resolution cine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the 
1.5T Elekta Unity MR-Linac system currently relies on a balanced contrast 
sequence for motion monitoring (MM) and tumor tracking. Despite its high 
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), a balanced contrast sequence does not always 
provide the ideal contrast for tumor imaging in all situations. Thus, the 
investigation of other contrast high temporal resolution cine MRI sequences is 
needed.
METHODS: Experiments were conducted to validate the T1-weighting and SNR on a 
cine MRI sequence with a frame rate of 4 frames-per-second (fps) and sufficient 
image quality. A ModusQA Quasar MRI4D motion phantom and Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) phantom were used to confirm adequate motion 
tracking, contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), SNR, and T1 weighting of the new cine 
MRI sequence. Target tracking success using Elekta's Comprehensive Motion 
Management (CMM) algorithm was assessed on in vivo patient images, and the CNR 
was measured for the patients with liver tumors which are one of the most 
challenging sites for visualization using the balanced cine MRI sequence.
RESULTS: The T1-weighted cine MRI sequence exhibited consistent CNR, SNR and 
T1-weighting over the duration of the scan while maintaining the ability to 
capture target motion within 1 mm at 4 fps. In-vivo analysis showed that the 
T1-weighted sequence had an average tracking success rate of 99.3% ± 1.12% 
versus the 83.3% ± 23.4% success rate of the bTFE sequence using Elekta's CMM 
algorithm for all anatomical sites investigated and better CNR compared to the 
bTFE sequence for all liver tumors investigated.
CONCLUSION: The proposed T1-weighted cine MRI sequence can produce quality 
T1-weighted images capable of tracking tumor motion over time. This demonstrates 
the sequence's potential in motion monitoring tasks as an alternative to the 
bTFE sequence when necessary.

OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer's disease poses a significant threat to human health. 
Currenttherapeutic medicines, while alleviate symptoms, fail to reverse the 
disease progression or reduce its harmful effects, and exhibit toxicity and side 
effects such as gastrointestinal discomfort and cardiovascular disorders. The 
major challenge in developing machine learning models for 
anti-acetylcholinesterase peptides discovery is the limited availability of 
active peptide data in public databases. This study primarily aims to address 
this challenge and secondarily to discover novel, safer, and less toxic 
anti-acetylcholinesterase peptides for better Alzheimer's disease treatment.
METHODS: A Random Forest Classifier model was constructed from a hybrid dataset 
of non-peptide small molecules and peptides. It was applied to screen a custom 
peptide library. The binding affinities of the predicted peptides to 
acetylcholinesterase were assessed via molecular docking, and top ranked 
peptides were selected for experimental assay.
RESULTS: The top six peptides (IFLSMC, WCWIYN, WIGCWD, LHTMELL, WHLCVLF, and 
VWIIGFEHM) were selected for experimental validation. Their inhibitiory effects 
on acetylcholinesterase were determined to be 0.007, 3.4, 1.9, 10.6, 1.5, and 
3.9 μmol/L, respectively.
DISCUSSION: Predicting anti-acetylcholinesterase peptides is challenging due to 
the absence of a comprehensive, publicly accessible peptide database. 
Traditional approaches using only non-peptide small molecules for model 
construction often have poor performance on predicting active peptides. Here, we 
developed a machine-learning model from a hybrid dataset of non-peptide small 
molecules and peptides, which find six potent peptides. This model was 
as/superior accuracy compared to small-molecule-only models reported before, but 
has a significant higher capability of discriminating active peptides. Our work 
shows that hybrid datasets can boost machine-learning model prediction in 
peptide drug discovery.

BackgroundThe introduction of new Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatments 
necessitates updated health utilities for economic evaluations.ObjectiveMeasure 
health utilities of US adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD and 
their caregivers.MethodsWe conducted a web-based survey using the EuroQol 
EQ-5D-5L and Quality of Life in AD (QoL-AD), stratified by disease stage and 
care setting. Individuals with MCI or mild Alzheimer's dementia self-reported 
their utilities. Caregivers randomly received either a proxy survey to complete 
on behalf of the person with moderate to severe AD they cared for, or a 
caregiver survey that asked them to self-report their own utilities.ResultsWe 
received 241 patient responses and 176 caregiver responses. Patient EQ-5D-5L 
scores decreased monotonically as disease severity increased, with a 0.55 
utility difference between individuals with MCI and severe AD in the community 
setting. EQ-5D-5L values were generally lower for individuals residing in 
nursing homes (0.04 to 0.78) compared to those in community settings (0.22 to 
0.77). Patients' QoL-AD scores did not exhibit a consistent association with 
their disease severity. Similarly, caregivers' EQ-5D-5L scores did not exhibit a 
monotonic trend with the patient's disease severity, although caregiver 
utilities were generally higher for those caring for someone in a nursing home 
than for those caring for patients in the community.ConclusionsOur results 
contribute to improving AD economic evaluations by reflecting the lived 
experience of more contemporary populations and facilitating the value 
assessment of novel therapies that delay progression from MCI to more severe 
disease stages.

BACKGROUND: The increasing prevalence of dementia poses significant challenges 
for emergency department (ED) care, as persons living with dementia (PLWD) more 
frequently experience adverse outcomes such as delirium, prolonged stays, and 
higher mortality rates. Despite advancements in care strategies, a critical gap 
remains in understanding how ED interventions impact outcomes in this vulnerable 
population. This systematic review aims to identify evidence-based ED care 
interventions tailored to PLWD to improve outcomes.
METHODS: A systematic review was conducted in Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane Library 
(Wiley), Scopus (Elsevier), and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global through 
September 2024. The review protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42024586555). 
Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials, observational studies, 
and quality improvement initiatives focused on ED interventions for PLWD. Data 
extraction and quality assessment were performed independently by two reviewers, 
with disagreements resolved through discussion. Outcomes included patient 
satisfaction, ED revisits, functional decline, and mortality.
RESULTS: From 3305 screened studies, six met the inclusion criteria. 
Interventions included nonpharmacologic therapies (e.g., music and light 
therapy), specialized geriatric ED units, and assessment tools, such as for 
pain. Tailored interventions including geriatric emergency units and community 
paramedic care transitions were effective in reducing 30-day ED revisits and 
hospitalizations. However, heterogeneity in study designs and outcomes precluded 
meta-analysis. Risk of bias ranged from low to moderate.
CONCLUSION: This review underscores the urgent need for standardized and 
evidence-based interventions in ED settings for PLWD. Approaches including 
multidisciplinary care models and nonpharmacologic therapies demonstrated 
potential for improving outcomes. Future research should prioritize consistent 
outcome measures, interdisciplinary collaboration, and person-centered care 
strategies to enhance the quality and equity of ED services for PLWD.

INTRODUCTION: Red blood cells (RBCs) are crucial for oxygen delivery to active 
tissues and endure significant mechanical forces in the microcirculatory bed. 
The enrichment of mechanosensitive Piezo1 channels, linked to the cytoskeleton, 
aids RBCs in navigating the narrow capillaries. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
impaired brain microcirculation may necessitate enhanced Piezo1 function in 
RBCs.
METHODS: With micropipette aspiration and flow cytometry technics, we evaluated, 
using the specific Piezo1 agonist Yoda1, AD-related alterations in the 
biomechanical properties of RBCs from cognitively healthy patients (HC) and 
individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD.
RESULTS: We show that beta-amyloid (Aβ) peptides alter the biomechanical 
properties of RBCs. We observed significantly higher Yoda1-induced calcium 
responses in RBCs in individuals with MCI and AD compared to RBCs from 
age-matched HC.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that Yoda1-induced Ca2+ flux through Piezo1 channel 
emerges as a measurable indicator associated with and improves the detection of 
AD-related dementia.
HIGHLIGHTS: Piezo1 channels aid the navigation of red blood cells (RBCs) through 
narrow capillaries. Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients show increased 
Yoda1-induced activation of Piezo1 in RBCs. Incorporation of Yoda1-induced 
Piezo1 readouts improved the detection of AD-related dementia. Investigating 
Yoda1-induced Piezo1 activity associated with early AD.

The cattle tick Rhipicephalus microplus, which is distributed worldwide, causes 
significant economic loss to the livestock industry. A sphingomyelinase (SMase) 
D-like protein was previously identified in R. microplus saliva (RmSMase) and 
characterized in terms of its cofactors, optimum pH, and products generated from 
sphingomyelin hydrolysis. SMases are present in the venom of spiders from 
Loxosceles spp. and in the digestive system of non-venomous spiders from 
Uloborus spp. and are secreted by pathogenic bacteria. In this study A peptide 
library was screened using Phage Display technology and two out of the three 
peptides synthesized showed inhibitory activity against RmSMase with 
sphingomyelin as the substrate. Two of the three synthesized peptides showed 
inhibitory activity against RmSMase. Docking analysis suggested that the 
peptides block access of the substrate to the catalytic site. The RWLWWLW 
peptide showed competitive behavior (Ki = 5.35 ± 0.46 μM), whereas WLSWLW showed 
competitive inhibition behavior (Ki = 29.54 ± 6.11 μM). Both RWLWWLW and WLSWLW 
also inhibited the activity of SMase C from the bacterial pathogen Bacillus 
cereus, presenting IC50 values of 4.99 ± 0.07 and 16.94 ± 8.71 μM, respectively. 
Because SMases have been suggested to be involved in the development of 
Alzheimer's disease, major depression, and cerebral ischemia, the discovery and 
characterization of new SMase inhibitors may contribute to the development of 
alternative treatments. This is the first study to identify peptide inhibitors 
against tick SMase using phage display technology.

The progressive aggregation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides is central to the 
development of Alzheimer's disease, contributing to memory loss, cognitive 
decline, and neuronal degeneration. Transition metal complexes, owing to their 
tunable oxidation states and diverse coordination geometries, have been explored 
as chemical modulators to disrupt the aggregation pathways of Aβ peptides. Their 
biological applications, however, are often constrained by inherent toxicity and 
potential metal release. Herein, we report the selection and preparation of 
cobalt complexes with macrocyclic 1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane (Cyclam) and 
1,8-dimethyl-1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane (DMC) ligands, 
[Co(Cyclam)(NO3)](NO3), [Co(Cyclam)(Cl)2]Cl, [Co(DMC)(H2O)2](NO3)2, and 
[Co(DMC)(Cl)2]Cl, adopting either trans-III or cis-V geometry as relatively 
stable chemical reagents for controlling the assembly and toxicity profiles of 
Aβ peptides. Our mechanistic investigations reveal that these cobalt complexes 
can form adducts with Aβ peptides and, subsequently, redirect their aggregation 
pathway away from the canonical on-pathway process towards the formation of 
amorphous clusters and shorter fibrils. Furthermore, cobalt complexes mitigate 
Aβ-induced toxicity with minimal intrinsic toxicity in living cells. Overall, 
our study illustrates a guidance for selecting metal complexes as chemical 
modulators against Aβ amyloidogenesis by integrating the characteristics of both 
metal centers and ligand scaffolds.
