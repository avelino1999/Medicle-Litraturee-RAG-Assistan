Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia among older adults, slowly 
destroys memory and thinking skills. In recent years, scientists have made 
tremendous progress in understanding Alzheimer's disease, still, they do not yet 
fully understand what causes the disease. This article proposes a novel etiology 
for Alzheimer's disease. Our hypothesis developed from a review of nuclear 
medicine scans, in which the authors observed a significant increase in nasal 
turbinate vasodilation and blood pooling in patients with hypertension, sleep 
apnea, diabetes and/or obesity, all risk factors for Alzheimer's disease. The 
authors propose that nasal turbinate vasodilation and resultant blood pooling 
lead to the obstruction of normal nasal lymphatic clearance of cerebrospinal 
fluid and its waste products from the brain. The nasal turbinate vasodilation, 
due to increased parasympathetic activity, occurs alongside the well-established 
increased sympathetic activity of the cardiovascular system as seen in patients 
with hypertension. The increased parasympathetic activity is likely due to an 
autonomic imbalance secondary to the increase in worldwide consumption of highly 
processed food associated with dysregulation of the glucose regulatory system. 
The authors' hypothesis offers a novel mechanism and a new paradigm for the 
etiology of Alzheimer's disease and helps explain the rapid worldwide rise in 
the disease and other dementias which are expected to double in the next 
20 years. This new paradigm provides compelling evidence for the modulation of 
the parasympathetic nervous system as a novel treatment strategy for Alzheimer's 
disease and other degenerative brain diseases, specifically targeting nasal 
turbinate lymphatic flow.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with a higher risk 
incidence in females than in males, and there are also differences in AD 
pathophysiology between sexes. The role of sex in the pathogenesis of AD may be 
crucial, yet the cellular and molecular basis remains unclear. Here, we 
performed a comprehensive analysis using four public transcriptome datasets of 
AD patients and age-matched control individuals in prefrontal cortex, including 
bulk transcriptome (295 females and 402 males) and single-nucleus RNA sequencing 
(snRNA-seq) data (224 females and 219 males). We found that the transcriptomic 
profile in female control was similar to those in AD. To characterize the key 
features associated with both the pathogenesis of AD and sex difference, we 
identified a co-expressed gene module that positively correlated with AD, sex, 
and aging, and was also enriched with immune-associated pathways. Using 
snRNA-seq datasets, we found that microglia (MG), a resident immune cell in the 
brain, demonstrated substantial differences in several aspects between sexes, 
such as an elevated proportion of activated MG, altered transcriptomic profile 
and cell-cell interaction between MG and other brain cell types in female 
control. Additionally, genes upregulated in female MG, such as TLR2, MERTK, 
SPP1, SLA, ACSL1, and FKBP5, had high confidence to be identified as biomarkers 
to distinguish AD status, and these genes also interacted with some approved 
drugs for treatment of AD. These findings underscore the altered immune response 
in female is associated with sex difference in susceptibility to AD, and the 
necessity of considering sex factors when developing AD biomarkers and 
therapeutic strategies, providing a scientific basis for further in-depth 
studies on sex differences in AD.

Background: Gastrointestinal symptoms are now detected early in the clinical 
course of many dementia patients, and studies of the microbiome-gut-brain axis 
have confirmed bidirectional interactions between the gut and the brain. 
However, the causal relationship between gut microbiota and cognitive impairment 
has not been fully established. Therefore, this study conducted a bidirectional 
Mendelian randomization study to elucidate the potential causal relationship of 
gut microbiota to cognitive impairment. Objective: Using Mendelian randomization 
to identify gut flora with a genetic causal effect on the development of 
cognitive impairment. Methods: This study utilized publicly available 
genome-wide association study summary data to perform MR analysis, with gut 
microbiota as the exposure and various cognitive function indicators as well as 
scores for Alzheimer's disease as outcomes. This study selected single 
nucleotide polymorphisms as instrumental variables based on p-values, 
F-statistics, and r2. Bidirectional Mendelian randomization was conducted using 
methods such as inverse variance weighted, MR-Egger, simple mode, and weighted 
mode to assess the causal relationship. Concurrently, this study carried out 
Cochran's Q test, MR-Egger intercept test, and leave-one-out analysis to 
identify potential heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy. Results: This study 
identified a total of 31 gut microbes that have a causal relationship with 
cognitive impairment, which include 1 phylum, 4 classes, 3 orders, 2 families, 
and 21 genera. Conclusions: This study unveiled specific gut microbiota 
associated with cognitive impairment, offering new insights and approaches for 
the prevention and treatment of cognitive impairment through gut microbiota such 
as Bifidobacterium and Ruminococcus gnavus group.

BACKGROUND: A deep knowledge of the healthcare system and the organization of 
neurology departments is important for planning and optimizing changes to 
facilitate the successful implementation of anti-amyloid antibodies treatments.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the necessary changes prior to introducing these 
therapies in our setting.
METHODS: We conducted a key informant survey among heads of departments of 
neurology from 16 hospitals in Spain. The questionnaire comprised questions 
about changes in the organization and functioning of the departments of 
neurology with the introduction of anti-amyloid drugs, changes in diagnosis and 
patient care, use of diagnostic techniques, patients, families and public 
information, resources allocation, and research.
RESULTS: Sixteen key informants completed the survey. They strongly agreed that 
the introduction of anti-amyloid drugs will impact the functioning of neurology 
services, especially in hospitals with dementia units. Consensus was reached 
regarding referring all Alzheimer's disease patients eligible for therapy to 
dementia units. There was also agreement on the need to expand the neurology 
services, day hospital units, extend visit durations, and hire more 
professionals, especially neurologists, neuropsychologists, and nuclear medicine 
physicians. Furthermore, consensus was achieved on increasing the use of MRI, 
amyloid PET, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, APOE genotyping, and the necessity 
of advancing blood biomarkers and tau tracers.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the need for extensive changes within Spanish 
neurological departments to effectively integrate anti-amyloid antibodies. 
Implementing these changes is essential for the timely and equitable adoption of 
novel therapies.

BACKGROUND: Recent research suggests that selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors (SSRIs) may reduce mortality in COVID-19 patients; however, research 
into their benefits for elderly Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients remains 
limited.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between SSRIs therapy and the 
mortality risk after COVID-19 infection in elderly patients with and without AD.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study leveraged a large database containing 
over 100 million electronic health records in the US from the TriNetX platform 
to compare the hazard rates of mortality after COVID-19 infection in elderly AD 
patients prescribed SSRIs versus propensity-score matched individuals prescribed 
other antidepressants. This study was also conducted in separate cohorts of 
patients without AD to compare the findings.
RESULTS: When compared with non-SSRI antidepressants, SSRIs were associated with 
lower risk for mortality after COVID-19 infection in elderly patients without AD 
over early, middle, and later stages of the pandemic with HRs of 0.84 (95% CI: 
0.75-0.93), 0.86 (95% CI: 0.79-0.93), and 0.77 (95% CI: 0.71-0.33), 
respectively. When comparing SSRIs with non-SSRI antidepressants for mortality 
risk following COVID-19 among patients with AD, HRs of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.71-1.27), 
0.80 (95% CI: 0.61-1.06), and 0.99 (95% CI: 0.75-1.32), were found respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the use of SSRIs is significantly 
associated with reduced mortality risk following COVID-19 in elderly patients 
without AD compared to other antidepressants. While a lower mortality risk was 
also observed among AD patients, the association was not statistically 
significant.

BACKGROUND: Effect of education attainment and nutritional status on the 
development of cognitive impairment in Chinese elderly has not been reported.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of education and nutrition in preventing 
cognitive impairment in the hospitalized Chinese elderly.
METHODS: Cognitive function was examined using the scoring system of Mini-Mental 
State Examination (MMSE) domains performed under instruction of Physicians of 
Geriatrics. Generalized linear mixed-effect regression was used for analyzing 
the association of demographic factors (age and gender), socioeconomic factors 
(education attainment and monthly income), as well as health-related factors 
(nutritional status, comorbidity, anxiety, and depression) and MMSE scores.
RESULTS: Total 246 hospitalized Chinese elders were enrolled into this study. Of 
them, 96 participants were 60-70 years old, 65 participants were 71-80 years 
old, and 85 of them were 81 years or older. Of the examined factors, we found 
that age, education attainment, and nutritional status were significantly 
associated with the outcome of MMSE scores, while monthly income and health 
condition (comorbidity, anxiety, and depression) were not significantly 
associated with MMSE score. Furthermore, education attainment was significantly 
associated with majority of the MMSE domains, including orientation, 
registration, attention and calculation, recall, and most of language 
sub-domains.
CONCLUSION: Education attainment and nutritional status were significantly 
associated with MMSE scores in the hospitalized Chinese elderly. Higher 
education and better nutritional status are protective factors for the 
development of cognitive impairment in the hospitalized elderly Chinese 
population.

BACKGROUND: Clinical and preclinical studies have shown that extra virgin olive 
oil (EVOO), a major component of the Mediterranean diet, has beneficial effects 
on brain aging and cognition. Individuals with Down syndrome develop 
age-dependent cognitive decline and synaptic dysfunction. However, whether EVOO 
intake is beneficial in Down syndrome is not known.
OBJECTIVE: In this study, by implementing a mouse model of Down syndrome, we 
aimed to investigate the effect that chronic administration of EVOO has on 
memory, synaptic function, and neuroinflammation.
METHODS: Starting at 4 months of age Ts65dn mice were randomized to receive EVOO 
for 5 months in their diet, after which they were tested for learning and memory 
impairment. After euthanasia, synaptic function was measured in freshly obtained 
hippocampal slices, whereas brain tissues were assessed for inflammatory 
biomarkers.
RESULTS: Compared with controls, mice receiving EVOO had a significant 
improvement in learning and spatial memory. Additionally, field potential 
recordings showed that treated mice had an improvement in synaptic function. 
Finally, array analysis showed that EVOO modulated the expression levels of 
several inflammatory biomarkers.
CONCLUSIONS: Chronic administration of EVOO to a mouse model of Down syndrome 
has beneficial effects on memory impairments, synaptic function deficits and 
neuroinflammation. Our findings provide additional support for the potential 
therapeutic effects of EVOO also in individuals with Down syndrome.

BACKGROUND: Bilateral oophorectomy (BO) confers immediate estradiol loss. We 
examined prevalence and predictors of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in women with 
early BO comparing their odds ratios of AD to those of women with spontaneous 
menopause (SM).
METHODS: A cohort from UK Biobank (n = 34,603) included women aged 60 + at 
baseline with and without AD who had early BO or SM. AD was determined based on 
AD related ICD-10 or ICD-9 code. We used logistic regression to model the 
association of menopause type with AD. Model predictors included age, education, 
age at menopause, hormone therapy (HT), APOE4, body mass index (BMI), cancer 
history, and smoking history.
RESULTS: Those with early BO had four times the odds of developing AD 
(OR = 4.12, 95% CI [2.02, 8.44]) compared to those with SM. APOE4 (OR = 4.29, 
95% CI [2.43, 7.56]), and older age (OR = 1.16, 95% CI [1.05, 1.28]) were 
associated with increased odds of AD in the BO group. Greater years of education 
were associated with reduced odds of AD for both BO (OR = 0.91, 95% CI [0.85, 
0.98]), and SM (OR = 0.95, 95% CI [0.90, 0.99]), while ever use of HT was 
associated with decreased odds of AD only for the BO group (OR = 0.43, 95% CI 
[0.23, 0.82]).
CONCLUSIONS: Women with early BO, particularly with an APOE4 allele, are at high 
risk of AD. Women with early BO who use HT and those with increased education 
have lower odds of developing AD.

We comment on the importance of the novel tablet-based screening tool for 
cognitive decline recently studied in Nigeria by Ogbuagu et al. TabCAT-BHA was 
administered on an iPad in urban and rural settings and was found to be a 
sensitive and culturally appropriate tool for assessing cognitive function and 
impairment. With accuracy, portability, speed, and ease of use, this study shows 
that such tests, computerized or online, have the potential to improve the 
screening of cognitive decline in diverse countries such as Nigeria, to 
facilitate early treatment and improved care and quality of life.

BACKGROUND: Individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) have a heightened risk of 
epilepsy. However, the underlying mechanisms are not well-understood.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to elucidate the role of the glutamate-glutamine cycle in 
this mechanism and test the effect of ceftriaxone, a glutamate transporter-1 
(GLT-1) enhancer, on seizure susceptibility in the Tg2576 mouse model of AD.
METHODS: First, we assessed expression levels of key proteins in the 
glutamate-glutamine cycle in Tg2576 (n = 7) and wild-type littermates (n = 7), 
and subsequently in the kindling model of epilepsy (n = 6) and sham (n = 6). 
Then, kindling susceptibility was assessed in three groups: 200 mg/kg 
ceftriaxone-treated Tg2576 (Tg-Ceft, n = 9); saline-treated Tg2576 (Tg-Sal, 
n = 9); and saline-treated wild-type (WT-Sal, n = 15). Mice were treated for 
seven days before kindling, and seizure susceptibility compared between groups.
RESULTS: Protein levels of GLT-1 (p = 0.0093) and glutamine synthetase 
(p = 0.0016) were reduced in cortex of Tg2576 mice, compared to WT. Kindling 
increased GLT-1 (cortex: p < 0.0001, hippocampus: p = 0.0075), and glutaminase 
(cortex: p = 0.0044) protein levels, compared to sham. Both Tg-Ceft and WT-Sal 
displayed Class IV seizures in response to the first stimulation (p > 0.99), 
while Tg-Sal displayed Class V seizure (p = 0.0212 versus WT-Sal). Seizure 
susceptibility of Tg-Ceft was not different from Tg-Sal (p > 0.05), and kindling 
rates did not differ between groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Disruptions to key components of the glutamate-glutamine cycle are 
observed in models of AD and epilepsy. However, increasing GLT-1 through 
ceftriaxone treatment did not influence seizure susceptibility in Tg2576 mice, 
suggesting this is not an effective strategy to lower seizure susceptibility in 
AD, or a higher dosage is needed.

This commentary offers a detailed examination of a newly published paper on the 
effects of small molecule decoys of amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregation on microglial 
activation. It was discovered that the NSC16224 decoy peptide inhibited 
proinflammatory cytokines TNFα and IL6 release from microglia in response to 
Aβ40 and Aβ42 treatment. The research addresses the potential of blocking a 
sequence of events that lead to the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Here, we discuss the significance of these results in neuroinflammation, 
highlighting the greater implications for how decoy peptides would be 
interesting for the research and development of new drugs for AD therapy.

Recent studies indicate that gut microbiota may play a crucial role in cognitive 
function. Individuals with cognitive impairment tend to have fewer beneficial 
gut bacteria and lower microbial diversity. Therefore, gut microbiota could be a 
potential biomarker for cognitive vulnerability. Further research is needed to 
understand the mechanisms and lifestyle factors affecting both microbiota 
composition and cognitive health. While the direct impact of microbiota and diet 
on cognitive impairment remains unconfirmed, this area holds promise for 
developing new preventive and treatment strategies.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and irreversible 
neurological disorder that gradually deteriorates an individual's ability to 
carry out even the simplest tasks.
OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to investigate the potential therapeutic 
efficacy of a novel bithiophene in a rat model of aluminum-induced AD pathology.
METHODS: A total of 108 adult male albino rats weighing 160 ± 20 g, were 
randomly assigned to six groups: (1) a control group administered DMSO, (2) 
group receiving a high dose of bithiophene (1 mg/kg), (3) a model group received 
AlCl3 (100 mg/kg), those rats were then treated by either (4) bithiophene low 
dose (0.5 mg/kg), (5) high dose (1 mg/kg), or (6) memantine (20 mg/kg).
RESULTS: Low dose bithiophene treatment was a promising strategy for mitigating 
oxidative stress and improving synaptic plasticity. This was demonstrated by 
reductions in malondialdehyde level, and increased activities of superoxide 
dismutase and catalase, and elevated glutathione content. Likewise, low dose 
bithiophene enhanced synaptic plasticity through a reduction in excitatory 
glutamate and norepinephrine levels, while increasing dopamine. Moreover, 
bithiophene significantly downregulated the expression of GSAP, GSK3-β, and p53, 
which are implicated in AD progression. This treatment also decreased caspase 3 
and amyloid-β (Aβ1-42) accumulation in the hippocampus. Finally, behavioral 
assessments revealed that low dose bithiophene significantly enhanced learning 
abilities, as proved by Morris water maze.
CONCLUSIONS: Low dose bithiophene mitigated AD through ameliorating oxidative 
stress, promoting synaptic plasticity, inhibiting the Aβ accumulation, and 
enhancing the cognitive functions in a rat model.

Alzheimer disease (AD) remains a significant global health concern. The 
progression from preclinical stages to overt dementia has become a crucial point 
of interest for researchers. This paper reviews the potential of 
neurophysiological biomarkers in predicting AD progression, based on a 
systematic literature search following PRISMA guidelines, including 55 studies. 
EEG-based techniques have been predominantly employed, whereas TMS studies are 
less common. Among the investigated neurophysiological measures, spectral power 
measurements and event-related potentials-based measures, including P300 and 
N200 latencies, have emerged as the most consistent and reliable biomarkers for 
predicting the likelihood of conversion to AD. In addition, TMS-based indices of 
cortical excitability and synaptic plasticity have also shown potential in 
assessing the risk of conversion to AD. However, concerns persist regarding the 
methodological discrepancies among studies, the accuracy of these 
neurophysiological measures in comparison to established AD biomarkers, and 
their immediate clinical applicability. Further research is needed to validate 
the predictive capabilities of EEG and TMS measures. Advancements in this area 
could lead to cost-effective, reliable biomarkers, enhancing diagnostic 
processes and deepening our understanding of AD pathophysiology.

BACKGROUND: . The present study aimed at deriving regression-based reliable 
change indices (RCIs) for the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in an Italian 
cohort of non-demented Parkinson's disease (PD) patients.
METHODS: N = 33 consecutive, non-demented PD patients were followed-up at a 
5-to-8-month interval (M = 6.6; SD = 0.6) with the MoCA. Practice effects and 
test-retest reliability were assessed via dependent-sample t-tests and 
intra-class correlation (ICC) coefficients, respectively. RCIs were derived 
separately for raw and demographically adjusted MoCA scores according to a 
standardized regression-based approach by accounting for both baseline 
confounders (i.e., demographics, disease duration and Unified Parkinson's 
Disease Rating Scale scores) and retest interval.
RESULTS: No practice effects were found (t(32) = 0.29; p = .778), with 
acceptable test-retest reliability being detected (ICC = 0.67). MoCA scores at 
T0 proved to be the only significant predictor of T1 MoCA performances within 
both the model addressing raw scores and that addressing adjusted scores 
(ps < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides Italian practitioners and researchers 
with regression-based RCIs for the MoCA in non-demented PD patients, which can 
be reliably adopted for retest interval ≥ 5 and ≤ 8 months without encountering 
any practice effect.

Increased activity of the NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3 
(NLRP3) inflammasome-IL-1β pathway is observed in obesity and contributes to the 
development of type 2 diabetes and its complications. In this review, we 
describe the pathological activation of IL-1β by metabolic stress, ageing and 
the microbiome and present data on the role of IL-1β in metabolism. We explore 
the physiological role of the IL-1β pathway in insulin secretion and the 
relationship between circulating levels of IL-1β and the development of diabetes 
and associated diseases. We highlight the paradoxical nature of IL-1β as both a 
friend and a foe in glucose regulation and provide details on clinical 
translation, including the glucose-lowering effects of IL-1 antagonism and its 
impact on disease modification. We also discuss the potential role of IL-1β in 
obesity, Alzheimer's disease, fatigue, gonadal dysfunction and related disorders 
such as rheumatoid arthritis and gout. Finally, we address the safety of NLRP3 
inhibition and IL-1 antagonists and the prospect of using this therapeutic 
approach for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and its comorbidities.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is considered one of the most common neurological 
conditions associated with memory and cognitive impairment and mainly affects 
people aged 65 or above. Even with tremendous progress in modern neuroscience, a 
permanent remedy or cure for this crippling disease is still unattainable. 
Polyphenols are a group of naturally occurring potent compounds that can 
modulate the neurodegenerative processes typical of AD. The present 
comprehensive study has been conducted to find out the preclinical and clinical 
potential of polyphenols and elucidate their possible mechanisms in managing AD. 
Additionally, we have reviewed different clinical studies investigating 
polyphenols as single compounds or cotherapies, including those currently 
recruiting, completed, terminated, withdrawn, or suspended in AD treatment. 
Natural polyphenols were systematically screened and identified through 
electronic databases including Google Scholar, PubMed, and Scopus based on in 
vitro cell line studies and preclinical data demonstrating their potential for 
neuroprotection. A total of 63 significant polyphenols were identified. A 
multimechanistic pathway for polyphenol's mode of action has been proposed in 
the study. Out of 63, four potent polyphenols have been identified as promising 
potential candidates, based on their reported clinical efficacy. Polyphenols 
hold tremendous scope for the development of a future drug molecule as a 
phytopharmaceutical that may be incorporated as an adjuvant to the therapeutic 
regime. However, more high-quality studies with novel delivery methods and 
combinatorial approaches are required to overcome obstacles such as 
bioavailability and blood-brain barrier crossing to underscore the therapeutic 
potential of these compounds in AD management.

A previous epidemiological study in Northern Europe showed that the A673T 
mutation (Icelandic mutation) in the amyloid precursor protein gene (APP) can 
protect against Alzheimer's disease (AD). While the effect of the A673T mutation 
on APP processing has been investigated primarily in vitro, its in vivo impact 
has not been evaluated. This is mainly because most existing AD mouse models 
carry the Swedish mutation. The Swedish and Icelandic mutations are both located 
near the β-cleavage site, and each mutation is presumed to have the opposite 
effect on β-cleavage. Therefore, in the AD mouse models with the Swedish 
mutation, its effects could compete with the effects of the Icelandic mutation. 
Here, we introduced the A673T mutation into App knock-in mice devoid of the 
Swedish mutation (AppG-F mice) to avoid potential deleterious effects of the 
Swedish mutation and generated AppG-F-A673T mice. APP-A673T significantly 
downregulated β-cleavage and attenuated the production of Aβ and amyloid 
pathology in the brains of these animals. The Icelandic mutation also reduced 
neuroinflammation and neuritic alterations. Both sexes were studied. This is the 
first successful demonstration of the protective effect of the Icelandic 
mutation on amyloid pathology in vivo. Our findings indicate that specific 
inhibition of the APP-BACE1 interaction could be a promising therapeutic 
approach. Alternatively, the introduction of the disease-protective mutation 
such as APP-A673T using in vivo genome editing technology could be a novel 
treatment for individuals at high risk for AD, such as familial AD gene mutation 
carriers and APOE ε4 carriers.

[Possibility of short synthetic peptides with activities of suppressing amyloid 
β aggregation and resolving its aggregated form as therapeutic drugs for 
Alzheimer's disease].

[Article in Japanese]

Lecanemab is a new anti-amyloid antibody being developed as a treatment for 
Alzheimer's disease. It is expected to delay the progression of the disease by 
reducing the accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) in the brain. However, no drug 
has been developed that can completely eliminate Aβ and improve symptoms. A 
representative Catalytide, JAL-TA9 (YKGSGFRMI), cleaves Aβ42 and improves 
symptoms in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model, suggesting that JAL-TA9 is a 
promising candidate for treating Alzheimer's disease by effectively eliminating 
Aβ. The catalytic center of JAL-TA9 is GSGFR. To identify better Catalytides for 
Alzheimer's treatment, we analyzed the structure-activity relationship of 21 
point-mutated GSGFR derivatives. In this process, we discovered two peptides, 
GSGFK and GSGNR, that not only inhibit Aβ25-35 aggregation but also dissolve 
aggregated Aβ25-35. Intracerebroventricular administration of GSGFK protected 
mice against Aβ25-35-induced short-term memory deficits and promoted microglial 
phagocytic activity. Like Lecanemab, GSGFK targets Aβ, but it has advantages 
such as safety, administration method, and cost. In this talk, we will discuss 
the potential of GSGFK as a therapeutic candidate for Alzheimer's disease.

[Delivery of JAL-TA9 to the brain by nasal application].

Sciences, Tohoku University.

We have reported on two Catalytides (Catalytic peptides), JAL-TA9 (YKGSGFRMI) 
and ANA-TA9 (SKGQAYRMI). Both peptides belong to the Tob/BTG family proteins and 
cleave Aβ42. Although Catalytides must be delivered to the brain parenchyma to 
treat Alzheimer's disease, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) limits their entry into 
the brain from the systemic circulation. Thus, we evaluated the direct route of 
ANA-TA9 from the nasal cavity to the brain to bypass the BBB. In this study, we 
present our findings on JAL-TA9. Animal studies using rats and mice clarified 
that the plasma clearance of JAL-TA9 was more rapid than its in vitro 
degradation in plasma, whole blood, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). After nasal 
administration of JAL-TA9, brain concentrations were significantly higher than 
after intraperitoneal administration, despite much lower plasma concentration. 
This observation strongly suggests direct delivery of JAL-TA9 to the brain from 
the nasal cavity. Similar findings were observed for its transport to CSF after 
nasal and intravenous administration. The concentration of JAL-TA9 in the 
olfactory bulb peaked at 5 ‍min, while those in the frontal brain peaked at 
30 ‍min and in the occipital brain at 60 ‍min. In conclusion, JAL-TA9 was 
efficiently delivered to the brain by nasal application compared to other 
routes.

Many studies have been conducted to find an effective drug for Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) treatment. However, no effective drug applicable for clinical use 
has been developed. Recently, the FDA approved Lecanemab, an antibody drug that 
acts as an aggregation inhibitor against Amyloid-beta (Aβ), for AD treatment. 
However, there are still no fundamental drugs for AD. In this study, we present 
a strategy for AD treatment that removes Aβ by cleavage reaction using one of 
the Catalytides, JAL-TA9 (YKGSGFRMI). A single dose of JAL-TA9 administered into 
the CA1 region of the hippocampus and the intraventricular space improved the 
deficits in short-term memory of APP-knock-in mice. It also improved the memory 
of Aβ25-35-induced model mice, as evaluated by the Y-maze and objective 
recognition tests. These data strongly suggest that JAL-TA9 could be effective 
in treating AD. However, these administration methods are difficult to apply 
clinically due to their high invasiveness. Thus, we tested the improvement 
effects of dementia by administering JAL-TA9 nasally. It is very interesting and 
exciting that the dementia of Aβ25-35 induced AD model mice was improved by four 
applications once every three days. These results strongly suggest that JAL-TA9 
is the best candidate for AD treatment because it is effective even in the late 
stage of AD.

[Article in Japanese]

Amyloid-β (Aβ) 42, one of the causes of Alzheimer's disease (AD), is produced by 
the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β- or γ-secretases. Since 
Aβ42 oligomers exhibit strong neurotoxicity, Aβ42 is predicted to be a 
potentially efficient target for drug therapies. Recently, we screened peptides 
that activate MMP7 using our peptide library and found that the synthetic 
peptide JAL-TA9 (YKGSGFRMI), which is derived from the BoxA region of Tob1 
protein, showed proteolytic activity. It is generally accepted that an enzyme 
should be a large molecular protein consisting of more than thousands of amino 
acids. Thus, this is the first finding that a small synthetic peptide has 
protease activity, and we termed Catalytide as the general name of peptides with 
protease activity. In this study, we demonstrate the cleavage activity of 
JAL-TA9 not only against the authentic soluble form of Aβ42 but also against the 
solid type of Aβ42 in the central region. In addition, we demonstrated the 
cleavage activity using brain slices of AD patients. JAL-TA9 decreased the 
amount of accumulated Aβ42 in the brain of Alzheimer's patients. Taken together, 
JAL-TA9 is an attractive seed for the development of peptide drugs with a new 
strategy for Alzheimer's disease.

Chemical-Driven Amyloid Clearance for Therapeutics and Diagnostics of 
Alzheimer's Disease.

Kim HY, Kim Y.

A century ago, German neurologist Alois Alzheimer documented the first case of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), illuminating cognitive impairments associated with the 
presence of abnormal protein clusters, including amyloid plaques and tau 
tangles, within the brain. In a typical physiological state, the equilibrium of 
amyloid-β (Aβ) levels is maintained, but aging can precipitate disruptions in 
the homeostasis of Aβ due to its overproduction, impaired clearance, and other 
factors, ultimately leading to its accumulation. Although the link between Aβ 
aggregates and neurodegeneration has long made Aβ a promising target for AD, 
decades without successful drug development targeting Aβ have generated 
skepticism regarding the efficacy of this strategy for AD therapy. However, 
recent approvals of anti-Aβ antibody drugs by the FDA, including aducanumab 
(Aduhelm), lecanemab (Leqembi), and donanemab (Kisunla), have prompted a 
re-evaluation of this perspective. These therapies have demonstrated efficacy in 
reducing brain Aβ levels, thereby decelerating disease progression and 
reaffirming Aβ as a key target. Despite advancements, immunotherapies are 
accompanied by considerable disadvantages, including adverse effects, high 
costs, and cumbersome administration. To address these limitations, our research 
has focused on developing small molecules that can mitigate the challenges of 
antibody treatments while offering practical and accessible options. We 
identified 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazine propanesulfonic acid (EPPS) as a 
promising compound that significantly reduces aggregated Aβ in the brain and 
enhances behavior in AD rodent models. Following administration, EPPS penetrates 
the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and binds to toxic Aβ aggregates, subsequently 
breaking them down into nontoxic monomers. This leads to two significant 
outcomes: a reduction of Aβ aggregates in the brain and a subsequent increase in 
Aβ monomers in blood. The monomeric Aβ, unlike its aggregated form, can now 
traverse the BBB and enter the bloodstream. This mechanism provides an 
innovative approach to AD treatment and diagnosis. By detaching cerebral Aβ 
aggregates, EPPS facilitates Aβ clearance and addresses a key pathological 
feature of AD. Concurrently, the increase in blood Aβ levels offers a potential 
biomarker for monitoring treatment efficacy and disease progression, thereby 
revolutionizing both AD treatment and diagnosis. Investigating the detailed mode 
of action of drug candidates requires structural information about a target 
protein. Unfortunately, the unstable and heterogeneous nature of Aβ aggregates, 
which form larger clusters, complicates the identification of these structures. 
Therefore, we developed new tools for screening small molecules by immobilizing 
monomeric Aβ and its fragments on plates. This allows us not only to identify 
novel compounds that target Aβ but also to elucidate their mechanisms of action, 
enabling the development of Aβ-targeting therapeutic avenues in AD. We believe 
that our work on chemical-driven amyloid clearance through small molecules 
represents an advance in AD research, offering chemical diversity and 
straightforward, economical development processes. In clinical practice, we 
anticipate that these findings will contribute to the development of 
patient-friendly therapeutic and diagnostic interventions, including 
self-administered and orally available options, thereby enhancing disease 
management and overall quality of life for individuals with AD. Furthermore, 
this research extends beyond AD, potentially offering insights into other 
neurodegenerative diseases characterized by protein aggregation.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: CSF biomarkers of Aβ42 and phosphorylated tau 
(p-tau181) are used clinically for the detection of Alzheimer disease (AD) 
pathology during life. CSF biomarker validation studies have largely used 
clinical diagnoses and/or amyloid PET imaging as the reference standard. The few 
existing CSF-to-autopsy studies have been restricted to late-stage AD. This 
CSF-to-autopsy study investigated associations between CSF biomarkers of AD and 
AD neuropathologic changes among brain donors who had normal cognition at the 
time of lumbar puncture (LP).
METHODS: This was a retrospective study of brain donors from the National 
Alzheimer's Coordinating Center who had normal cognition at the time of LP and 
who had measurements of CSF Aβ42 and p-tau181 performed with Lumipulse assays. 
All brain donors were from Washington University Knight ADRC. Staging of AD 
neuropathologic change (ADNC) was made based on National Institute on 
Aging-Alzheimer's Association criteria. For this study, participants were 
divided into 2 categories: "AD-" (no AD/low ADNC) and "AD+" (intermediate/high 
ADNC). Accuracy of each biomarker for discriminating AD status was evaluated 
using area under the curve (AUC) statistics generated using predicted 
probabilities from binary logistic regressions that controlled for age, sex, 
APOE ε4, and interval between LP and death.
RESULTS: The average age at LP was 79.3 years (SD = 5.6), and the average age at 
death was 87.1 years (SD = 6.5). Of the 49 brain donors, 24 (49%) were male and 
47 (95.9%) were White. 20 (40.8%) had autopsy-confirmed AD. The average interval 
from LP until death was 7.76 years (SD = 4.31). CSF p-tau181/Aβ42 was the 
optimal predictor of AD, having excellent discrimination accuracy (AUC = 0.97, 
95% CI 0.94-1.00, p = 0.003). CSF p-tau181 alone had the second-best 
discrimination accuracy (AUC = 0.92, 95% CI 0.84-1.00, p = 0.001), followed by 
CSF Aβ42 alone (AUC = 0.92, 95% CI 0.85-1.00, p = 0.007), while CSF t-tau had 
the numerically lowest discrimination accuracy (AUC = 0.87, 95% CI 0.76-0.97, p 
= 0.005). Effects remained after controlling for prevalent comorbid 
neuropathologies. CSF p-tau181/Aβ42 was strongly associated with CERAD ratings 
of neuritic amyloid plaque scores and Braak staging of NFTs.
DISCUSSION: This study supports Lumipulse-measured CSF Aβ42 and p-tau181 and, 
particularly, the ratio of p-tau181 to Aβ42, for the early detection of AD 
pathophysiologic processes.
CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that Lumipulse 
measures of p-tau181/Aβ42 in the CSF accurately discriminated cognitively normal 
participants with and without Alzheimer disease neuropathologic change.

IMPORTANCE: Interventions that substantially slow neurodegeneration are needed 
to address the growing burden of Alzheimer disease (AD) to societies worldwide. 
Elevated brain iron observed in AD has been associated with accelerated 
cognitive decline and may be a tractable drug target.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the brain-permeable iron chelator deferiprone 
slows cognitive decline in people with AD.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This phase 2, double-masked, 
placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial of 12-month duration was conducted 
at 9 sites in Australia between August 2, 2018, and April 1, 2023. Patients 
older than 54 years with amyloid-confirmed mild cognitive impairment or early AD 
(a Mini-Mental State Examination score of 20 or higher) were screened. 
Randomization was 2:1 and masked to participants and all study staff.
INTERVENTIONS: Deferiprone 15 mg/kg twice a day or placebo administered orally 
for 12 months.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was a composite cognitive 
measure assessed at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months using a neuropsychological 
test battery (NTB) of memory, executive function, and attention tasks. Secondary 
outcomes included change in brain iron burden measured by quantitative 
susceptibility mapping (QSM) magnetic resonance imaging (target engagement), 
brain volume changes (secondary efficacy measure), and adverse events (safety 
analysis).
RESULTS: Of 167 patients screened for eligibility, 81 were included, with 53 
randomly assigned to the deferiprone group (mean [SD] age, 73.0 [8.0] years; 29 
male [54.7%]) and 28 to the placebo group (mean [SD] age, 71.6 [7.2] years; 17 
male [60.7%]); 54 participants completed the study (7 [25.0%] withdrew from the 
placebo group and 20 [37.7%] from the deferiprone group). In an 
intention-to-treat analysis, participants in the deferiprone group showed 
accelerated cognitive decline on the NTB primary outcome (β for 
interaction = -0.50; 95% CI, -0.80 to -0.20) compared with placebo (change in 
NTB composite z score for deferiprone, -0.80 [95% CI, -0.98 to -0.62]; for 
placebo, -0.30 [95% CI, -0.54 to -0.06]). Secondary analysis revealed that this 
result was driven by worsening performance on executive function tests. The QSM 
confirmed that deferiprone decreased iron in the hippocampus compared with 
placebo (change in hippocampal QSM for deferiprone, -0.36 ppb [95% CI, -0.76 to 
0.04 ppb]; for placebo, 0.32 ppb [95% CI, -0.12 to 0.75 ppb]; β for 
interaction = -0.68 [95% CI, -1.27 to -0.09]). Longitudinal hippocampal volume 
loss was not affected by deferiprone, but exploratory analysis of other brain 
regions revealed increased volume loss with deferiprone in frontal areas. The 
frequency of the adverse effect of neutropenia (4 participants [7.5%] in the 
deferiprone group) was higher than in similar studies (1.6%-4.4%).
CONCLUSIONS: These trial findings show that deferiprone 15 mg/kg twice a day 
decreased hippocampal QSM and accelerated cognitive decline in patients with 
amyloid-confirmed early AD, suggesting that lowering iron with deferiprone is 
detrimental to patients with AD.

The main pathological mechanisms of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) are extracellular 
senile plaques caused by β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition and intracellular 
neurofibrillary tangles derived from hyperphosphorylated Tau protein (p-Tau). 
However, it is difficult to obtain a good curative effect because of the poor 
brain bioavailability of drugs, which is attributed to the blood-brain barrier 
(BBB) restriction and complicated brain conditions. Herein, HM-DK was proposed 
for synergistic therapy of AD by using hollow mesoporous manganese dioxide (HM) 
as a carrier to deliver an Aβ-inhibiting peptide and a Dp-peptide inhibitor of 
Tau-related fibril formation synergistically. Inspired by 4T1 cancer cells 
promoting BBB penetration during brain metastasis, a prospective biomimetic 
nanocarrier (HM-DK@CM) encapsulated by 4T1 cell membranes was designed. After 
crossing the BBB, HM-DK@CM inhibited Aβ aggregation and prevented Tau 
phosphorylation simultaneously. Moreover, by taking advantage of the 
catalase-like activity of HM, HM-DK@CM relieved oxidative stress and altered the 
microenvironment associated with the development of AD. Compared with the single 
therapeutic drug, HM-DK@CM restored nerve damage and improved AD mice's learning 
and memory abilities by decreasing Aβ oligomer, p-Tau protein, and inflammation 
through various pathways for synergistic therapy, which has broad prospects for 
the effective treatment of AD.

BACKGROUND: Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) for Alzheimer's disease (AD) are 
emerging following successful clinical trials of therapies targeting amyloid 
beta (Aβ) protofibrils or plaques. Determining patient eligibility and 
monitoring treatment efficacy and adverse events, such as Aβ-related imaging 
abnormalities, necessitates imaging with MRI and PET. The Canadian Consortium on 
Neurodegeneration in Aging (CCNA) Imaging Workgroup aimed to synthesize evidence 
and provide recommendations on implementing imaging protocols for AD DMTs in 
Canada.
METHODS: The workgroup employed a Delphi process to develop these 
recommendations. Experts from radiology, neurology, biomedical engineering, 
nuclear medicine, MRI and medical physics were recruited. Surveys and meetings 
were conducted to achieve consensus on key issues, including protocol 
standardization, scanner strength, monitoring protocols based on risk profiles 
and optimal protocol lengths. Draft recommendations were refined through 
multiple iterations and expert discussions.
RESULTS: The recommendations emphasize standardized acquisition imaging 
protocols across manufacturers and scanner strengths to ensure consistency and 
reliability of clinical treatment decisions, tailored monitoring protocols based 
on DMTs' safety and efficacy profiles, consistent monitoring regardless of 
perceived treatment efficacy and MRI screening on 1.5T or 3T scanners with 
adapted protocols. An optimal protocol length of 20-30 minutes was deemed 
feasible; specific sequences are suggested.
CONCLUSION: The guidelines aim to enhance imaging data quality and consistency, 
facilitating better clinical decision-making and improving patient outcomes. 
Further research is needed to refine these protocols and address evolving 
challenges with new DMTs. It is recognized that administrative, financial and 
logistical capacity to deliver additional MRI and positron emission tomography 
scans require careful planning.

Aβ42 aggregation was implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
without effective treatment available currently. Future efforts in clinical 
trials should instead focus on applying those antiamyloid treatment strategies 
to the preclinical stage and "the earlier, the better". How to identify and 
inhibit Aβ42 oligomers in the different stages of aggregation is therefore 
becoming the key to controlling primary aggregation and consequent AD 
development. Aggregation-induced emission probe DNTPH was demonstrated recently, 
enabling detection of amyloid at wavelengths up to 710 nm and exhibiting strong 
inhibitory effects on Aβ fibrosis at low dose. However, the detection and 
inhibition mechanisms of Aβ oligomers at various early stages of aggregation 
remain unknown. To this end, we built four different morphologies of Aβ42 
pentamers characterized by products in monomeric aggregate (PM), primary 
nucleation (PP), secondary nucleation (PS), and fibril stages (PF) to explore 
the distinguishable ability and inhibition mechanisms of DNTPH with different 
concentrations upon binding. The results showcased that DNTPH does detect the 
four different Aβ42 oligomers with conspicuous fluorescence (λPM = 657 nm, λPP = 
639 nm, λPS = 630 nm, and λPF = 648 nm) but fails to distinguish them, 
indicating that additional improvements are required further for the probe to 
achieve it. The inhibition mechanisms of DNTPH on the four Aβ42 aggregation are 
however of amazing differences. For PM and PP, aggregation was inhibited by 
altering the secondary structural composition, i.e., by decreasing the β-sheet 
and toxic turn (residues 22-23) probabilities, respectively. For PS, inhibition 
was achieved by segregating and keeping the two disordered monomeric species 
(PSM) away from the ordered secondary seed species (PSF) and consequently 
blocking further growth of the PSF seed. The inhibition mechanism for PS is 
first probed and proposed so far, as far as we know, and the corresponding 
aggregation stage of PS is the most important one among the four stages. The 
inhibition of PF was triggered by distorting the fibril chains, disrupting the 
ordered fibril surface for the contact of monomers. In addition, the optimal 
inhibitory concentrations of DNTPH for PM, PP, and PF were determined to be 1:3, 
while for PS, it was 1:5. This outcome offers a novel perspective for designing 
drugs targeting Aβ42 oligomers at different aggregation stages.

OBJECTIVES: Korean-American primary family caregivers of individuals with 
Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) may face unique stress, 
attributable to the distinctive characteristics of Korean-Americans, including 
their immigration history, culture, and language. Using narrative inquiry, we 
explored caregiving experiences, focusing on stress, and identified factors 
contributing to stress among Korean-American family caregivers providing in-home 
care to individuals with ADRD.
METHOD: We conducted one-on-one, semi-structured interviews with 15 
Korean-American family caregivers of individuals with ADRD. We analyzed the 
participants' stress in the context of temporality (i.e. timelines of their 
caregiving), sociality (i.e. cultural and familiar contexts), and place (i.e. 
various life settings).
RESULTS: The majority of participants were female (73%), Korean-born immigrants 
(93%), and had relatively high levels of education with an average of 16 years 
of education. We found that 1) caregivers' stress continued but varied along the 
ADRD caregiving trajectory, 2) cultural expectations and relationship dynamics 
amplified stress levels, and 3) maintaining a Korean identity while living in 
the United States limited caregivers' social connections.
CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the nuances of stress among Korean-American 
ADRD family caregivers. Specific support needs should be addressed in the 
development of culturally tailored stress reduction interventions for this 
understudied population.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive chronic age-related neurodegenerative 
brain disorder characterized by the loss of memory and other cognitive 
functions. The exact etiology of AD is still under investigation, however 
several factors such as low level of neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh), 
aggregation of amyloid beta (Aβ) in the form of Aβ plaques, hyperphosphorylation 
of tau protein into neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), oxidative stress, and metal 
ion imbalance are the major hallmarks of this disease. Of the multiple 
hypotheses for AD, the amyloid-β (Aβ) and cholinergic hypothesis are the main 
targeting hypotheses for AD. Some researchers hypothesized that the primary 
event associated with the cholinergic neurotransmitter (acetylcholine) is memory 
loss and cognitive impairment. Due to the disease's complicated pathogenesis, 
long-term therapy with a single target candidate is futile. As a result, 
multitargeted and multifunctional therapies have emerged. Various research teams 
are concentrating on addressing multiple disease factors through hybridization 
techniques. Consequently, this hybridization approach has been applied to all 
core scaffolds, including galantamine. In this article, we tried to provide a 
thorough overview of the most recent developments on galantamine, a prospective 
AChE inhibitor, and its hybrid analogs as possible therapeutic agents for 
treating AD. Furthermore, we also provided the design, synthesis, and SAR 
analysis of the galantamine-based compounds used in the last decades for the 
management of AD.

Early detection of Alzheimer's disease is vital for timely treatment. Existing 
biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease reflect amyloid- and tau-related pathology, 
but it is unknown whether the disease can be detected before cerebral 
amyloidosis is observed. N-glycosylation has been suggested as an upstream 
regulator of both amyloid and tau pathology, and levels of the N-glycan 
structure bisecting N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) correlate with tau in blood and 
CSF already at pre-clinical stages of the disease. Therefore, we aimed to 
evaluate whether bisecting GlcNAc could predict future cognitive decline in 
patients from a memory clinic cohort, stratified by amyloid/tau status. We 
included 251 patients (mean age: 65.6 ± 10.6 years, 60.6% female) in the GEDOC 
cohort, from the Memory Clinic at Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, 
Sweden. Patients were classified as amyloid/tau positive or negative based on 
CSF biomarkers. Cognitive decline, measured by longitudinal Mini-Mental State 
Examination scores, was followed for an average of 10.7 ± 4.1 years and modelled 
using non-linear mixed effects models. Additionally, bisecting GlcNAc levels 
were measured in hippocampus and cortex with lectin-based immunohistochemistry 
in 10 Alzheimer's disease and control brains. We found that CSF bisecting GlcNAc 
levels were elevated in tau-positive individuals compared with tau-negative 
individuals, but not in amyloid-positive individuals compared with 
amyloid-negative individuals. In the whole sample, high levels of CSF bisecting 
GlcNAc predicted earlier cognitive decline. Strikingly, amyloid/tau 
stratification showed that high CSF bisecting GlcNAc levels predicted earlier 
cognitive decline in amyloid-negative patients (β = 2.53 ± 0.85 years, P = 
0.003) and tau-negative patients (β = 2.43 ± 1.01 years, P = 0.017), but not in 
amyloid- or tau-positive patients. Finally, histochemical analysis of bisecting 
GlcNAc showed increased levels in neurons in hippocampus and cortex of 
Alzheimer's disease compared with control brain (fold change = 1.44-1.49, P < 
0.001). In conclusion, high CSF levels of bisecting GlcNAc reflected neuronal 
pathology and predicted cognitive decline in amyloid- and tau-negative 
individuals, suggesting that abnormal glycosylation precedes cerebral 
amyloidosis and tau hyper-phosphorylation in Alzheimer's disease. Bisecting 
GlcNAc is a promising novel early biomarker for Alzheimer's disease.

Neurological disorders (NDs) encompass a range of debilitating conditions that 
affect the nervous system, including prevalent illnesses such as Alzheimer's 
disease, Parkinson's disease, and ischemic stroke. Despite significant ongoing 
studies, effective therapeutic strategies to halt or slow down the progression 
of these illnesses are still lacking. Stilbenes, a class of natural polyphenols, 
have shown potential as candidates for therapeutic strategies due to their 
capacity to protect the nervous system. Preclinical studies have provided strong 
evidence that stilbenes can regulate many cellular pathways implicated in 
neurodegeneration, with resveratrol being a well-studied compound that has shown 
the ability to reduce oxidative damage, promote neurogenesis, and enhance 
mitochondrial function - crucial for maintaining brain health. In preclinical 
animal models, initial research has also shown promise in additional substances 
such as piceatannol and pterostilbene. Furthermore, clinical studies have 
explored the therapeutic benefits of stilbenes in NDs. Despite promising results 
in preclinical research, the use of stilbenes in clinical trials is currently 
limited, with most studies focusing on resveratrol. Although several clinical 
studies have demonstrated the beneficial impact of resveratrol supplementation 
on brain health and degenerative consequences, other investigations have yielded 
ambiguous findings, underscoring the urgent need for more comprehensive and 
precisely planned clinical research. This study delves into the potential 
benefits of stilbenes as neuroprotective agents for NDs. It emphasizes the need 
for more clinical research to enhance our understanding of their therapeutic 
effectiveness in specific patient groups.

PURPOSE: Syphilis, caused by Treponema pallidum, presents a diagnostic challenge 
due to its diverse clinical manifestations. Neurosyphilis has seen a resurgence 
in recent years, particularly among men who have sex with men and those living 
with HIV. Diagnosis of neurosyphilis in emergency settings is challenging due to 
its varied neurological presentations. This study aims to serve as a reference 
for dermatologists and neurologists in diagnosing and treating neurosyphilis.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed patients who presented 
with neuropsychiatric symptoms and were ultimately diagnosed with neurosyphilis. 
These patients were collected from the emergency department in Peking Union 
Medical College Hospital between January 2018 and November 2023. The medical 
history, clinical symptoms, laboratory examinations, cranial MRI 
characteristics, and treatment regimens of these patients were investigated.
RESULTS: Among the included 12 neurosyphilis patients, memory deterioration was 
observed in 8 out of the 12 neurosyphilis patients. Diagnosis often resulted in 
delays, with misdiagnoses mainly including Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and 
epilepsy. Neuroimaging revealed various abnormalities, predominantly affecting 
ventricular and temporal regions. Treatment with penicillin-based regimens 
varied in compliance, with only a minority of patients adhering to guidelines. 
Treatment outcomes were inconsistent, with some patients experiencing 
irreversible neurological damage and fluctuating serum rapid plasma reagin (RPR) 
titers.
CONCLUSION: Diagnosis of neurosyphilis in the emergency department remains 
challenging, necessitating awareness of its varied neurological presentations. 
Enhanced diagnostic strategies are imperative to accelerate treatment initiation 
and improve outcomes for affected individuals.

Tech University, Lubbock, TX, USA.

BACKGROUND: Plasma biomarker assays provide an opportunity to reassess whether 
Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD), and dementia with Lewy 
bodies (DLB) plasma biomarkers are diagnostically useful.
OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that immunomagnetic reduction (IMR) of plasma 
biomarkers could differentiate between patients with PDD and DLB and healthy 
patients when combined with established clinical testing measures.
METHODS: Plasma samples from 61 participants (12 PDD, 12 DLB, 37 controls) were 
analyzed using IMR to quantify amyloid-β 42 (Aβ42), total tau (t-tau), 
phosphorylated tau at threonine 181 (p-tau181), and α-synuclein (α-syn). 
Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was used to obtain 
sensitivity, specificity, and area under the ROC curve. Biomarker results were 
combined with clinical measures from the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating 
Scale (UPDRS), Montreal Cognitive Assessment, and Hoehn-Yahr stage to optimize 
diagnostic test performance.
RESULTS: Participants with PDD had higher α-syn than those with DLB and healthy 
participants and were distinguishable by their biomarker products Aβ42×p-tau181 
and Aβ42×α-syn. Patients with DLB had higher p-tau181 than those with PDD and 
healthy participants and were distinguishable by their concentrations of 
α-syn×p-tau181. Plasma α-syn plus UPDRS versus either test alone increased 
sensitivity, specificity, and AUC when healthy patients were compared with those 
with PDD and DLB. Combined clinical examination scores and plasma biomarker 
products demonstrated utility in differentiating PDD from DLB when p-tau181 was 
combined with UPDRS, α-syn was combined with UPDRS, and α-syn×p-tau181 was 
combined with UPDRS.
CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study, IMR plasma p-tau181 and α-syn may discriminate 
between PDD and DLB when used in conjunction with clinical testing.

and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sunchon National University, Suncheon, 57922 
Republic of Korea.

This study was to identify the molecular pathways that may explain 
sulforaphane's Alzheimer's disease (AD) benefits using multiple advanced in 
silico approaches. We found that sulforaphane regulates 45 targets, including 
TNF, INS, and BCL2. Therefore, it may help treat AD by reducing 
neuroinflammation, insulin resistance, and apoptosis. The important 
relationships were co-expression and pathways. 45 targets were linked to the 
midbrain, metabolite interconversion enzymes, 14q23.3 and 1q31.1 chromosomes, 
and modified residues. "Amyloid precursor protein catabolic process", 
"regulation of apoptotic signaling pathway", and "positive regulation of nitric 
oxide biosynthetic process" were the main pathways, while NFKB1, SP1, RELA, 
hsa-miR-17-5p, hsa-miR-16-5p, and hsa-miR-26b-5p were transcription factors and 
miRNAs implicated in sulforaphane In AD treatment, miRNA sponges, dexibuprofen, 
and sulforaphane may be effective. Furthermore, its unique physicochemical, 
pharmacokinetic, and biological qualities make sulforaphane an effective AD 
treatment, including efficient gastrointestinal absorption, drug-like 
properties, absence of CYP450 enzyme inhibition, not being a substrate for 
P-glycoprotein, ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, glutathione 
S-transferase substrate, immunostimulant effects, and antagonistic 
neurotransmitter effects. Sulforaphane is a promising compound for AD 
management. Further work is needed to elucidate its therapeutic effects based on 
our findings, including genes, miRNAs, molecular pathways, and transcription 
factors.

This study aimed to explore the protective effects of Euonymus alatus (EA) 
leaves and its compounds on hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced neuronal cell 
death. EA effectively reversed the H2O2-induced decrease in HT22 cell viability. 
Anti-apoptotic marker poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase significantly increased with 
EA treatment, whereas BAX/BCL2 and cleaved caspase-3/procaspase-3 ratios, which 
represent apoptotic markers, were dose-dependently decreased by EA treatment. 
Additionally, EA effectively decreased β-secretase production, acetylcholine 
esterase activity, and Tau phosphorylation, pathological features observed in 
Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, EA significantly increased the protein levels 
of NRF2 and HO-1, as well as the gene expression of antioxidant enzymes, 
including catalase, superoxide dismutase 1, and glutathione peroxidase. LC-MS/MS 
and HPLC analyses revealed the presence of chlorogenic acid and leucosides in 
EA. Both chlorogenic acid and leucosides showed protective effects against 
H2O2-induced neuronal cell death. This study highlights the potential of EA and 
its compounds as functional edible agents for neuroprotection against oxidative 
stress.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major neurological disorder and a leading cause of 
dementia, which is characterized by progressive cognitive decline. Emerging 
research highlights the link between AD and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), 
suggesting that shared pathophysiological mechanisms, such as insulin 
resistance, inflammation, and oxidative stress, contribute to both conditions. 
This connection has led to the concept of type 3 diabetes. Given these overlaps, 
antidiabetic drugs are being explored for repurposing as potential AD 
treatments. Intranasal insulin, metformin, thiazolidinediones, and GLP-1 analogs 
like liraglutide have shown promise in reducing amyloid-beta levels and 
inflammation, and improving cognitive functions. Despite encouraging preclinical 
and early clinical results, challenges remain in translating these findings into 
safe and effective treatments. Continued research could lead to innovative 
therapies that address both AD and T2DM, offering improved patient outcomes.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a gradual neurodegenerative ailment that lacks any 
disease-modifying intervention. Our objective was to pinpoint pharmacological 
targets with a focus on amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau to treat and prevent AD in the 
European population. A proteome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was 
carried out to estimate the associations between proteins and cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) Aβ-42 and phosphorylated Tau (p-Tau). We utilized colocalization and 
MR analysis to investigate whether the identified proteins were associated with 
the risk of AD. Additionally, we expanded our investigation to include non-AD 
phenotypes by conducting a phenome-wide MR analysis of 1646 disease traits based 
on the FinnGen and UK Biobank databases to explore potential side effects. We 
identified 11 proteins that were genetically associated with both CSF Aβ-42 and 
p-Tau levels. The genetically predicted levels of three proteins, GAL3ST2, 
POLR1C, and BIN1, were found to be associated with an increased risk of AD with 
high colocalization. In the phenome-wide MR analysis, two out of the three 
biomarkers were associated with at least one disease, except for GAL3ST2, which 
was not associated with any disease under the threshold of FDR <0.1. POLR1C was 
found to be associated with the most disease traits, and all disease 
associations with genetically inhibited BIN1 were protective. The proteome-wide 
MR investigation revealed 11 proteins that were associated with the level of CSF 
Aβ-42 and p-Tau. Among them, GAL3ST2, POLR1C, and BIN1 were identified as 
potential therapeutic targets for AD and warrant further investigation.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains one of the hardest neurodegenerative diseases 
to treat due to its enduring cognitive deterioration and memory loss. Despite 
extensive research, few viable treatment approaches have been found; these are 
mostly due to several barriers, such as the disease's complex biology, limited 
pharmaceutical efficacy, and the BBB. This presentation discusses current 
strategies for addressing these therapeutic barriers to enhance AD treatment. 
Innovative drug delivery methods including liposomes, exosomes, and 
nanoparticles may be able to pass the blood-brain barrier and allow medicine to 
enter specific brain regions. These innovative strategies of medicine 
distribution reduce systemic side effects by improving absorption. Moreover, the 
development of disease-modifying treatments that target tau protein tangles, 
amyloid-beta plaques, and neuroinflammation offers the chance to influence the 
course of the illness rather than only treat its symptoms. Furthermore, gene 
therapy and CRISPR-Cas9 technologies have surfaced as potentially groundbreaking 
methods for addressing the underlying genetic defects associated with AD. 
Furthermore, novel approaches to patient care may involve the utilization of 
existing medications having neuroprotective properties, such as those for 
diabetes and cardiovascular conditions. Furthermore, biomarker research and 
personalized medicine have made individualized therapy approaches possible, 
ensuring that patients receive the best care possible based on their unique 
genetic and molecular profiles.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is one of the most devastating age-related disorder 
causing significant social and economic burden worldwide. It affects the 
cognitive and social behavior of individuals and characterized by accumulation 
of Aβ, phosphorylated tau and cytokines formation. The synthesis and release of 
cytokines are regulated by specific groups of immune and non-immune cells in 
response to microglia or astrocyte activation through multiple pathways. 
Physiologically, microglia assert an anti-inflammatory, quiescent state with 
minimal cytokine expression and little phagocytic activity in motion to carry 
out their housekeeping role to eliminate pathogens, aggregated Aβ and tau 
protein. However, they develop a phagocytic nature and overexpress cytokine gene 
modules in response to certain stimuli in AD. Microglia and astrocytes upon 
chronic activation release an enormous amount of inflammatory cytokines due to 
interaction with formed Aβ and neurofibrillary tangle. Gut microbiota dysbiosis 
also stimulates the release of inflammatory cytokines contributing to AD 
pathogenesis. In addition, the dysregulation of few signaling pathways 
significantly influences the development of disease, and the pace of advancement 
also rises with age. This review sheds light on multiple pathways results into 
neuroinflammation triggered by activated cytokines worsening AD pathology and 
making it an appropriate target for AD treatment. This review also included 
drugs targeting different neuroinflammation pathways under clinical and 
preclinical studies that are found to be effective in attenuating the disease 
pathology.

Recent studies pointed out the modulation of imidazoline I2 receptors (I2-IR) by 
selective ligands as a putative strategy to face neurodegenerative diseases. 
Foregoing the classical 2-imidazoline/imidazole-containing I2-IR ligands, we 
report a family of bicyclic α-iminophosphonates endowed with high affinity and 
selectivity upon I2-IR and we advanced a representative compound B06 in 
preclinical phases. In this paper, we describe the synthetic possibilities of 
bicyclic α-iminophosphonates by exploring its ambivalent reactivity, leading to 
unprecedented molecules that showed promising activities as I2-IR ligands in 
human brain tissues and good BBB permeation capabilities. After in silico ADME 
prediction studies, we assessed the neuroprotective properties of selected 
compounds and beneficial effect in an in vitro model of Alzheimeŕs and 
Parkinson's disease. Along with their neuroprotective effect, compounds showed a 
potent anti-inflammatory response when evaluated in a neuroinflammation cellular 
model. Moreover, this is the first time that the neuroprotective effects of 
imidazoline I2-IR ligands in a transgenic Alzheimer's disease Caenorhabditis 
elegans strain are investigated. Using a thrashing assay, we found a significant 
cognition improvement in this in vivo model after treatment with the new 
bicyclic α-phosphoprolines. Therefore, our results confirmed the need of 
exploring structurally new I2-IR ligands and their potential for therapeutic 
strategies in neurodegeneration.

Cognitive decline, an important comorbidity of type 2 diabetes (T2D), is 
attributed to oxidative stress and impaired cholinergic signaling in the brain. 
The α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) is densely distributed in the 
hippocampus and cortex, and exerts neuroprotective and procognitive actions. 
Ethyl gallate (EG), a natural phenolic antioxidant compound, showed high 
in-silico binding affinity towards α7nAChR and brain penetrability. Therefore, 
the present study aimed to evaluate the involvement of α7nAChR in the potential 
of EG to ameliorate T2D-induced Alzheimer's disease-like condition. T2D was 
induced by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of streptozotocin (35 mg/kg) in rats 
on high-fat diet. Diabetic animals were treated with EG (10 and 20 mg/kg, i.p.) 
for four weeks, and their learning and memory performance was evaluated by the 
Morris water maze (MWM). Further, the brains were subjected to biochemical 
analysis of antioxidants like glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and 
catalase (CAT), and oxidative stress marker malonaldehyde (MDA). While diabetic 
rats showed a significant decline in cognitive performance in the MWM, a 
substantial improvement was noticed following EG treatment. Further, the 
diabetes-associated reductions in GSH, SOD, and CAT levels, along with increased 
MDA contents in the brain, were effectively restored by EG. Interestingly, 
pre-treatment with α7nAChR antagonist methyllycaconitine (1 mg/kg, i.p.) 
attenuated the effects of EG on behavioral and biochemical parameters. The 
results suggest that EG may augment cholinergic signaling in the brain via 
α7nAChR to mitigate oxidative stress, consequently alleviating T2D-associated 
dementia. Therefore, EG could be a potential candidate for addressing cognitive 
impairment comorbid with T2D.

The health care system is insufficiently capitalizing on the benefits of 
physical exercise in America's aging population. Few tools exist to help 
clinicians incorporate physical activity into their clinical care, and barriers 
limit older adults from initiating and maintaining exercise programs. The 
Lifestyle Empowerment for Alzheimer's Prevention (LEAP! Rx) Program has been 
designed to support providers and participants in lifestyle change. LEAP! Rx 
uses two forms of participant enrollment: physician referrals through electronic 
health records and self-referrals to test the efficacy of delivering a 
community-based exercise and healthy lifestyle program to older adults. After 
referral into the program, participants are randomized to receive the LEAP! Rx 
Program or are placed in a standard-of-care group to receive the program later. 
The LEAP! Rx program consists of a personalized and structured exercise program, 
lifestyle education, and mobile health monitoring. This includes a 12-week 
Empowerment phase with coaching and supervised exercise training, followed by a 
40-week Lifestyle phase with intermittent supervised exercise and coaching. 
Lifestyle education includes monthly, evidence-based classes on optimal aging. 
The evaluation of LEAP! Rx focuses on 1) the assessment of implementation and 
scalability of the LEAP!Rx Program for clinicians and patients 2) the effect of 
the LEAP! Rx Program on cardiorespiratory fitness, 3) the impact of the LEAP! Rx 
Program on secondary intervention outcome measures of chronic disease risk 
factors, including insulin resistance, body composition, and lipids. If 
successful, this study's findings could advance future healthcare practices, 
providing a new and practical approach to aging and chronic disease prevention.

Cannabidiol (CBD), a cannabinoid that does not create psychoactive activities, 
has been identified as having a multitude of therapeutic benefits. This study 
delves into the chemical properties, pharmacokinetics, safety and toxicity, 
pharmacological effects, and most importantly, the association between the 
therapeutic potential of CBD and the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 
(Nrf2) signaling pathway. The relationship between Nrf2 and CBD is closely 
linked to certain proteins that are associated with cardiovascular dysfunctions, 
cancers, and neurodegenerative conditions. Specifically, Nrf2 is connected to 
the initiation and progression of diverse health issues, including 
nephrotoxicity, bladder-related diseases, oral mucositis, cancers, obesity, 
myocardial injury and angiogenesis, skin-related inflammations, psychotic 
disorders, neuropathic pain, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, 
Parkinson's disease, neuroinflammation, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and 
Multiple Sclerosis. The association between CBD and Nrf2 is a zone of great 
interest in the medical field, as it has the potential to significantly impact 
the treatment and prevention of wide-ranging health conditions. Additional 
investigation is necessary to entirely apprehend the mechanisms underlying this 
crucial interplay and to develop effective therapeutic interventions.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) accounts for the majority of dementia cases, with aging 
being the primary risk factor for developing this neurodegenerative condition. 
Aging and AD share several characteristics, including the formation of amyloid 
plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, synaptic loss, and neuroinflammation. This 
overlap suggests that mechanisms driving the aging process might also promote 
AD; however, the underlying processes are not yet fully understood. In this 
narrative review, we will focus on the role of mitochondria, not only as the 
"powerhouse of the cell", but also in programmed cell death, immune response, 
macromolecular synthesis, and calcium regulation. We will explore both the 
common changes between aging and AD and the differences between them. 
Additionally, we will provide an overview of interventions aimed at maintaining 
mitochondrial function in an attempt to slow the progression of AD. This will 
include a discussion of antioxidant molecules, factors that trigger 
mitochondrial biogenesis, compounds capable of restoring the fission/fusion 
balance, and a particular focus on recent techniques for mitochondrial DNA gene 
therapy.

Dietary supplementation with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids improves cognitive 
performance in several animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD), an effect 
often associated with reduced amyloid-beta and/or tau pathologies. However, it 
remains unclear to what extent eicosapentaenoic (EPA) provides additional 
benefits compared to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Here, male and female 3xTg-AD 
mice were fed for 3 months (13-16 months of age) the following diets: (1) 
control (no DHA/EPA), (2) DHA (1.1g/kg) and low EPA (0.4g/kg), or (3) DHA 
(0.9g/kg) with high EPA (9.2g/kg). The DHA and DHA + EPA diets respectively 
increased DHA by 19% and 8% in the frontal cortex of 3xTg-AD mice, compared to 
controls. Levels of EPA, which were below the detection limit after the control 
diet, reached 0.14% and 0.29% of total brain fatty acids after the DHA 
and DHA + EPA diet, respectively. DHA and DHA + EPA diets lowered brain 
arachidonic acid levels and the n-6:n-3 docosapentaenoic acid ratio. Brain 
uptake of free 14C-DHA measured through intracarotid brain perfusion, but not of 
14C-EPA, was lower in 3xTg-AD than in NonTg mice. DHA and DHA + EPA diets in 
3xTg-AD mice reduced cortical soluble phosphorylated tau (pS202) (-34% 
high-DHA, -34% DHA + EPA, P < 0.05) while increasing p21-activated kinase (+58% 
and +83%, P < 0.001; respectively). High EPA intake lowered insoluble 
phosphorylated tau (-31% vs. DHA, P < 0.05). No diet effect on amyloid-beta 
levels was observed. In conclusion, dietary intake of DHA and EPA leads to 
differential changes in brain PUFA while altering cerebral biomarkers consistent 
with beneficial effects against AD-like neuropathology.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a global burden to the healthcare system with no 
viable treatment options till date. Rodents and primates have been extensively 
used as models for understanding AD pathogenesis and identifying therapeutic 
targets. However, the focus is now shifting towards developing alternate models. 
Zebrafish is emerging as a preferred model for neurodegenerative conditions 
because of its simple nervous system, highly conserved genome and short duration 
required to model disease condition. The present study is aimed to develop 
streptozotocin (STZ)-induced model of sporadic AD (sAD) in zebrafish. STZ was 
administered to adult zebrafish (4-6 mo) at different doses (1 to 50 mg/kg body 
weight, intracerebroventricularly). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed time 
and dose dependent mortality in the zebrafish administered with STZ. Based on 
survival analysis, 1 to 10 mg/kg body weight of STZ was selected for 
behavioural, molecular and histological studies. STZ administered fish had 
anxiety-like and stress behaviour in novel tank and light/dark preference tests. 
STZ-induced cognitive and memory deficits assessed using novel object 
recognition and spatial alternation tests. Further, expression of markers of 
amyloidogenic pathway (appa and bace1) were increased in terms of mRNA and 
protein levels in a time and dose dependent manner following STZ administration. 
However, expression of non-amyloidogenic pathway mediator (adam10) was reduced 
at both mRNA and protein level. Histological assessment using hematoxylin and 
eosin, and Nissl stain revealed loss of neurons in STZ administered fish. The 
ratio of phosphor-tauser396/total-tau was increased in STZ administered fish. 
Based on these findings, 5 mg/kg body weight of STZ was found to be most 
appropriate dose to exhibit sAD phenotype. Mass spectrometric analysis confirmed 
the presence of amyloid beta oligomers in brains of STZ administered fish. 
Transmission electron microscopy also showed the presence of higher order 
insoluble amyloid fibrils with twists. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed 
amyloid beta deposits in brain of STZ administered fish. Golgi-cox staining 
indicated decreased number of dendrites, whereas microglia had increased 
density, span ratio, soma area and lacunarity. The results of the present study 
demonstrate presence of AD hallmarks and phenotype in zebrafish 7 days post STZ 
administration (5 mg/kg). The study validates the potential of STZ-induced sAD 
in zebrafish as a reliable model for studying pathophysiology and rapid 
screening of therapeutic molecules against sAD.

Large retrospective cohort studies have consistently shown that people who 
exercise regularly are at a markedly reduced risk of dementias such as 
Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Animal studies have also found that exercise can 
prevent cognitive decline, and recent studies have identified possible 
mechanisms. However, randomized controlled trials of exercise interventions in 
AD and mild cognitive impairment have not reached a consensus regarding the 
efficacy of this treatment, hampering clinical adoption of this technique. This 
review examines these randomized controlled trials to assess potential causes 
for the variability in the measured outcomes. We posit that great variance in 
the methods used in these studies may account for some of the differences seen 
in outcomes. We determined that aerobic exercise led to the most benefits, that 
many cognitive domains improve with exercise, and that aerobic exercise enhances 
the ability for independent living. However, cognitive improvements were more 
pronounced and consistent in patients with mild cognitive impairment than AD, 
suggesting a narrow window of opportunity for exercise intervention.

INTRODUCTION: Dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) present both health 
and economic challenges on a global scale, thus affecting millions of people, 
and is projected to increase significantly by the year 2050. Early language 
processing deficits are evident in those diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and 
MCI. Recent advances in pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions, 
including cognitive rehabilitation and training, show promising effects on 
cognitive functions. Articulation training, particularly, is highlighted for its 
potential in addressing the communication difficulties which those experiencing 
dementia and MCI face, based on the transmission deficit hypothesis. This study 
aimed to perform a voxel-wise comparison of morphological changes in grey matter 
volume as well as white matter integrity to represent the plastic changes in 
response to articulation training among older, healthy Japanese adults.
METHODS: Forty older, healthy Japanese adults were randomized into either a 
cognitive training group or a control group. The study involved comprehensive 
behavioral assessments, neuroimaging (including 3D anatomy, fMRI and Diffusion 
Tensor Imaging), and a structured verbal articulation training regimen. The 
training included reading tasks which focused on enhancing both articulation and 
phonological skills. Neuroimaging data were acquired using a 3 Tesla Siemens MR 
scanner, with the FSL tool being used for white matter analysis and the CAT12 
toolbox for grey matter analysis.
RESULTS: Significant increases in grey matter volume were observed in certain 
regions, including the left Supplementary motor area, Postcentral gyrus, and 
bilateral Superior frontal gyrus among those in the training group. Correlations 
were noted between reading abilities and cortical volume in areas such as the 
left Middle temporal gyrus, pulvinar, and Middle occipital gyrus. White matter 
integrity also improved, as evidenced by increased fractional anisotropy in 
tracts such as the superior longitudinal fasciculus, corona radiata, and 
internal capsule. These findings suggest a link between articulation training 
and enhanced neuroplasticity in both grey and white matter regions related to 
language processing.
CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates that a 4-week verbal articulation training 
intervention period can lead to significant improvements in grey matter volume 
in the left Supplementary motor area, the left Postcentral gyrus, and the 
bilateral Superior frontal gyrus, as well as the integrity of white matter 
tracts associated with language processing among older adults. These results 
suggest that such training could be a valuable tool in enhancing cognitive 
functions related to language in older populations.

Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) are a type of common chronic progressive 
disorders characterized by progressive damage to specific cell populations in 
the nervous system, ultimately leading to disability or death. Effective 
treatments for these diseases are still lacking, due to a limited understanding 
of their pathogeneses, which involve multiple cellular and molecular pathways. 
The triggering of an immune response is a common feature in neurodegenerative 
disorders. A critical challenge is the intricate interplay between 
neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, and immune responses, which are not yet 
fully characterized. In recent years, the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase 
(cGAS)-stimulator of interferon gene (STING) pathway, a crucial immune response 
for intracellular DNA sensing, has gradually gained attention. However, the 
specific roles of this pathway within cellular types such as immune cells, glial 
and neuronal cells, and its contribution to ND pathogenesis, remain not fully 
elucidated. In this review, we systematically explore how the cGAS-STING 
signaling links various cell types with related cellular effector pathways under 
the context of NDs for multifaceted therapeutic directions. We emphasize the 
discovery of condition-dependent cellular heterogeneity in the cGAS-STING 
pathway, which is integral for understanding the diverse cellular responses and 
potential therapeutic targets. Additionally, we review the pathogenic role of 
cGAS-STING activation in Parkinson's disease, ataxia-telangiectasia, and 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We focus on the complex bidirectional roles of 
the cGAS-STING pathway in Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and 
multiple sclerosis, revealing their double-edged nature in disease progression. 
The objective of this review is to elucidate the pivotal role of the cGAS-STING 
pathway in ND pathogenesis and catalyze new insights for facilitating the 
development of novel therapeutic strategies.

Aging-induced hepatic dysfunction can impair cholesterol metabolism, reducing 
the availability of cholic acid (CA, bile-acid) in brain. CA is reported to have 
neuroprotective characteristics in preclinical investigations of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). Our aim is to probe the causal-connectivity between the players: 
amyloid, cholic acid and cerebral-blood-flow, and thereby explore therapeutic 
applicability in AD. From AD neuroimaging initiative biospecimen platform, we 
evaluated serum cholic-acid (182 healthy/136 AD individuals). We also assessed 
50 healthy/50 Alzheimer's subjects containing MRI-ASL scanning (cerebral 
blood-flow, CBF) and PET-AV45 scanning (amyloid-load). We performed 
computational causal connectivity to determine the cause-effect relationship 
among the parameters. Serum cholic acid in AD subjects substantially decreased 
to half of controls. Causal-connectivity revealed two novel causative pathways: 
(i) Decreasing serum CA markedly increased amyloid-load; (ii) Increasing 
amyloid-load distinctly decreased CBF. We substantiated these two causation 
pathways respectively with collateral available preclinical observations: (a) 
increased cholic acid reduces amyloid formation by diminishing gamma-secretase; 
(b) this decreased amyloid induces capillary-flow enhancement by relaxing 
vascular pericytes. Indeed, cholic acid can increase amyloid-clearance factor. 
Neuroimaging-based causal connectivity analysis showed that repositioned 
pharmacological modulation by cholate derivatives may have appreciable potential 
as novel window for therapeutic approach to AD. Indicative clinical validation 
is furnished from available therapeutic trial leads.

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) have a profound 
impact on patients' quality of life (QoL), with progressive declines occurring 
as the disease advances. This systematic review aims to summarize the published 
evidence on patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in individuals with MCI due to AD 
and mild AD dementia. Comprehensive searches were conducted across five major 
databases to identify studies reporting on utility values, disutilities, and QoL 
measures in these patient populations. A total of 23 studies were included that 
utilized various QoL assessment tools, including EQ-5D (n = 14), SF-36/SF-12 
(n = 4), and QOL-AD (n = 11). Reported EQ-5D scores ranged from 0.81 to 0.92 for 
patients with MCI and from 0.67 to 0.85 for those with mild AD, indicating a 
noticeable decline in QoL as the disease progresses. QOL-AD scores ranged from 
33.8 to 42.5 for MCI and from 32.4 to 38.1 for mild AD, equally reflecting the 
greater impairment in QoL with disease advancement. Interventions were generally 
associated with smaller declines in PROs compared to placebo, suggesting a 
positive impact of treatment in mitigating QoL deterioration. The findings 
underscore the significant QoL differences between MCI and mild AD, emphasizing 
the potential benefit of early intervention to preserve QoL and delay disease 
progression. This review highlights the importance of continued research to 
better understand QoL in patients with MCI and mild AD dementia, particularly in 
terms of capturing comprehensive patient-reported outcomes and evaluating the 
effectiveness of interventions over time. These findings can contribute to a 
more informed approach in clinical practice and support decision-making in the 
management of early-stage AD.

It has been shown recently, without an explanation of the possible molecular 
mechanisms involved, that 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinepropanesulphonic (EPPS) 
acid effectively protects from the neurotoxicity induced by oligomers and 
plaques formed by the protein amyloid-β protein. Here we report the same 
protective effect, obtained in vitro (HT22-diff cell line) and ex vivo 
(hippocampal slices) models, against amyloid neurotoxicity induced by oligomers 
of salmon Calcitonin (sCT), which has been shown to be a good model for the 
study of neurodegenerative diseases. Based on biophysical studies focusing on 
the protein aggregation kinetic and the interaction of the aggregates with model 
membranes, we propose a possible molecular mechanism underlying the protective 
effects. Taken together, our results indicate that EPPS is able to counteract 
the direct association (primary aggregation) of harmless low-molecular weight 
aggregates (dimers and trimers) or their aggregation catalysed by surfaces 
present in the solution (secondary aggregation). Thus, EPPS stabilizes harmless 
aggregates and hinders the formation of toxic and metastable prefibrillar 
oligomers. Overall, our data demonstrate that EPPS is an excellent drug 
candidate for the treatment of neurodegeneration due to misfolded proteins, such 
as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease.

In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), barriers such as low system 
readiness, contextual mismatches, and resource limitations impede effective 
implementation of evidence-based interventions. This commentary offers insights 
into overcoming these challenges with a case study of the PRISM project, 
designed to reduce behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia in older 
adults living in Thailand. The case highlights how combining two evidence-based 
models - the Reducing Disability in Alzheimer's Disease clinical intervention 
and the Getting To Outcomes implementation science process enhances program 
success. Using interviews with stakeholders across various health system levels, 
we identify factors critical to successful program implementation: (1) 
integrating interventions into policy frameworks, (2) empowering local 
implementers, (3) fostering collaborative learning, and (4) adapting 
interventions to local contexts. The case demonstrates that building system 
readiness through local engagement and ownership is central to scaling up health 
programs in LMICs. This commentary's contribution lies in its emphasis on the 
role of implementation science as a vehicle for translating research into 
practice. It presents a practical, adaptive model for embedding interventions 
into routine health systems, thereby offering a pathway for successfully scaling 
up evidence-based programs in LMICs. Such findings provide lessons for 
overcoming barriers to implementation in resource-limited environments.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are neurodegenerative 
disorders that significantly impact well-being. Hyperoside (HYP), a flavonoid 
found in various plant species, particularly within the genus Hypericin, 
exhibits diverse pharmacological properties. However, the precise mechanisms 
underlying the anti-AD and anti-PD effects of HYP remain unclear. This 
systematic review consolidated existing preclinical research on HYP by 
conducting a comprehensive literature survey and analysis. The objective was to 
corroborate the therapeutic efficacy of HYP in AD and PD models and to 
synthesize its potential therapeutic mechanisms. Searches were conducted in the 
PubMed, CNKI, and Web of Science databases. Reliability assessment of the 17 
included studies confirmed the credibility of the mechanisms of action of HYP 
against AD and PD. We systematically assessed the neuroprotective potential of 
HYP in in vivo and in vitro models of AD and PD. Our findings indicated that HYP 
can mitigate, intervene in, and treat AD and PD animal models and associated 
cells through various mechanisms, including anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, 
anti-apoptotic, anti-Aβ aggregation, and cholinesterase inhibitory activities. 
Therefore, HYP potentially exerts anti-AD and anti-PD effects through diverse 
mechanisms, making it a promising candidate for therapeutic intervention in both 
AD and PD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of neurodegeneration that 
results in memory disorders and cognitive impairment. The present study 
investigated the neuroprotective effects of the synthesized 
thiazolidine-2,4-dione derivative, 
(E)-5-(4-chlorobenzylidene)-3-(2-oxo-2-phenylethyl)thiazolidine-2,4-dione 
(TZ4C), an inhibitor of p-Tau and memory impairment, using a SH-SY5Y cell model 
of methamphetamine-induced tauopathy and a scopolamine-induced memory impairment 
model in Wistar rats. In the present study, the neuroprotective effect of TZ4C 
was studied in a SH-SY5Y cellular model of methamphetamine-induced (2 mM) 
tauopathy and a scopolamine-induced (1.5 mg/kg/day) memory impairment model in 
male Wistar rats (n = 48). The memory functions and learning abilities of the 
rats were evaluated using the Morris water maze (MWM) and passive avoidance 
tests. Additionally, AChE activity in the rat hippocampus was quantified, and 
the expression of p-Tau, HSP70, and caspase-3 in both in vitro and in vivo 
samples was evaluated through Western blot analysis. TZ4C (0.1-1000 µM) did not 
exhibit significantly toxic effects on SH-SY5Y cell viability. Western blot 
results indicated that TZ4C led to reduced expression of p-Tau, HSP70, and 
cleaved caspase-3 in SH-SY5Y cells (3 and 10 µM) and the rat hippocampus (2 and 
4 mg/kg). Additionally, the findings suggested that TZ4C enhanced memory 
function in rats with scopolamine-induced impairment and decreased 
acetylcholinesterase (AChE) specific activity. The comprehensive analysis of in 
vitro and in vivo experiments underscores the neuroprotective potential 
(improved neuropathology and reduced memory impairment) of TZ4C. These findings 
highlight the promise of TZ4C as a candidate for drug discovery programs to 
identify effective therapies for AD.

Protein homeostasis (proteostasis) refers to the plethora of mechanisms that 
safeguard the proper folding of the newly synthesized proteins. It entails 
various intricately regulated cues that demolish the toxic protein species to 
prevent their aggregation. The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is recognized 
as a salient protein degradation system, with a substantial role in maintaining 
proteostasis. However, under certain circumstances the protein degradation 
capacity of the UPS is overwhelmed, leading to the accumulation of misfolded 
proteins. Several neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, 
Parkinson's disease, Huntington disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis are 
characterized with the presence of protein aggregates and proteinopathy. 
Accordingly, enhancing the 26S proteasome degradation activity might delineate a 
pioneering approach in targeting various proteotoxic disorders. Regrettably, the 
exact molecular approaches that enhance the proteasomal activity are still not 
fully understood. Therefore, this review aimed to underscore several signaling 
cascades that might restore the degradation capacity of this molecular machine. 
In this review, we discuss the different molecular components of the UPS and how 
26S proteasomes are deleteriously affected in many neurodegenerative diseases. 
Moreover, we summarize different signaling pathways that can be utilized to 
renovate the 26S proteasome functional capacity, alongside currently known 
druggable targets in this circuit and various classes of proteasome activators.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Multi-targeted drug therapy has received 
substantial attention for the treatment of diseases of multifactorial origin, 
such as neurodegenerative diseases. Manasamitra vatakam (MMV) is a traditional 
Ayurvedic formulation used to improve cognitive impairment and mental illness. 
Here we have used a unique method for leveraging the barrier properties of the 
intestinal and blood-brain barrier (BBB) to screen and identify the bioactive 
molecules against Alzheimer's disease (AD). The current method exemplifies a 
facile method to expedite drug discovery from traditional formulations.
AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study aimed to identify the phytoconstituents of 
MMV that reach the brain tissue and to predict major bioactive constituents by 
computational docking studies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: After oral administration of the formulation, brain 
samples from male Sprague Dawley rats were collected at different time intervals 
and analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to identify the 
phytoconstituents. In silico molecular docking studies were carried out to 
analyze the binding affinity of the compounds to the target proteins of AD using 
Schrodinger Maestro. The molecular dynamic studies were carried out for all the 
docked complexes having higher docking scores.
RESULTS: 34 phytoconstituents were identified by LC-MS analysis of brain 
homogenates. In the in silico docking study, the phytoconstituents chrysin, 
convolvin, rutin, galangin, palmatoside G, isoliquiritigenin, quercetin, and 
naringenin showed higher docking score against the target proteins of AD. These 
compounds may serve as the primary bioactive compounds responsible for the 
neuroprotective activity of the herbal formulation. Furthermore, molecular 
dynamic studies indicated that the galangin-acetylcholinesterase enzyme complex 
has the highest stability among these eight compounds.
CONCLUSION: The study, together with previous in vivo and in vitro efficacy 
results, suggests that BBB-permeable compounds with high binding affinities for 
the target proteins of AD might be responsible for the effectiveness of MMV 
against AD.

Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is the key enzyme in the 
salvaging synthesize pathway of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). The 
neuroprotective roles of NAMPT on neurodegeneration have been explored in aging 
brain and Alzheimer's Disease. However, its roles in Parkinson's Disease (PD) 
remain to be elucidated. We found that the dopaminergic neurons in substantia 
nigra expressed higher levels of NAMPT than the other types of neurons. Using 
conditional knockout of the Nampt gene in dopaminergic neurons and utilizing a 
NAMPT inhibitor in the substantia nigra of mice, we found that the NAMPT 
deficiency triggered the time-dependent loss of dopaminergic neurons, the 
impairment of the dopamine nigrostriatal pathway, and the development of PD-like 
motor dysfunction. In the rotenone-induced PD mouse model, nicotinamide ribose 
(NR), a precursor of NAD, rescued the loss of dopaminergic neurons, the 
impairment of dopamine nigrostriatal pathway, and mitigated PD-like motor 
dysfunction. In SH-SY5Y cells, NAD suppression induced the accumulation of 
reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial impairment, and cell death, which 
was reversed by N-acetyl cysteine, an antioxidant and ROS scavenger. Rotenone 
decreased NAD level, induced the accumulation of ROS and the impairment of 
mitochondria, which was reversed by NR. In summary, our findings show that the 
ablation of NAMPT in dopaminergic neurons leads to neurodegeneration and 
contributes to the development of PD. The NAD precursors have the potential to 
protect the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, and offering a therapeutic 
approach for the treatment of PD.

OBJECTIVE: To characterize all Portuguese public hospitalizations of patients 
aged < 65 years with a primary or secondary diagnosis of dementia, based on 
ICD-9-CM coding.
METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted using a nationwide 
database encompassing all hospitalizations occurred in Portuguese mainland 
public hospitals with discharge from 2008 to 2015. Hospitalizations of patients 
aged 35-64 years with primary or secondary diagnoses of dementia were selected 
based on ICD-9-CM codes 290.1X-290.4X, 291.2, 292.82, 294.1X, 294.2X, 331.0, 
331.1X, 331.82, 333.4 and 046.1, excluding diagnostic codes 317-319, 330.X, 343, 
758.0-758.3 and 759.3. Information on age, sex, primary diagnosis, comorbidities 
(secondary diagnosis), type of admission, length of stay (LoS), in-hospital 
mortality, suicide attempts, discharge destination, readmissions and dementia 
etiology was collected.
RESULTS: From 7971 hospitalizations, for 5682 inpatients, the median age was 
57.3 years (SD±6.5) and 61.8% were of male patients. Vascular dementia was the 
most prevalent etiology, followed by Alzheimer's disease. Most admissions were 
urgent and had a primary diagnosis of 'Delirium, dementia and other cognitive 
disorders', followed by pneumonia and alcohol-related disorders. Dementia, 
cerebrovascular disease and diabetes were the most common comorbidities. 
Overall, 55.4% of admissions were first-time admissions during the study period 
and the median LoS was 10.0 days (Q1;Q3: 5.0;20.0). Suicide attempts were 
recorded in 0.6% of the episodes. The in-hospital mortality rate was 9.2% and 
most patients were discharged home (80.2%).
CONCLUSIONS: This study describes the complexity and strain of young-onset 
dementia hospitalizations providing a detailed overview and recommendations for 
further research and tailored interventions.

Alzheimer's Disease(AD) is the most common type of dementia. It is a progressive 
disease beginning with mild memory loss and possibly leading to loss of the 
ability to carry on a conversation and respond to the environment. This study 
investigates the relationship between the chemical structure of potential AD 
drugs and their therapeutic efficacy using Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) 
techniques including The approach for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal 
Solution (TOPSIS) and Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) method. A comprehensive 
dataset comprising molecular descriptors and corresponding pharmacological 
properties, i.e., melting point, boiling point, molecular weight and density of 
AD drugs was compiled from diverse sources. Topological indices were calculated 
to capture the structural characteristics of these compounds. Application of 
TOPSIS and SAW through Entropy method helps obtain optimal drugs for curing AD. 
Quantitative Structure Property Relationships (QSPR) analysis has been done 
between properties and topological indices of AD's drug structures. Results 
revealed significant relations between specific topological indices and drug 
efficacy, providing insights into the structural features crucial for AD 
treatment efficacy. This approach offers a promising avenue for rational drug 
design and optimization in the quest for novel AD therapeutics.

Alzheimer´s disease (AD) is characterized by neuronal function loss and 
degeneration. The integrity of the axon initial segment (AIS) is essential to 
maintain neuronal function and output. AIS alterations are detected in human 
post-mortem AD brains and mice models, as well as, neurodevelopmental and mental 
disorders. However, the mechanisms leading to AIS deregulation in AD and the 
extrinsic glial origin are elusive. We studied early postnatal differences in 
AIS cellular/molecular mechanisms in wild-type or APP/PS1 mice and combined 
neuron-astrocyte co-cultures. We observed AIS integrity alterations, reduced 
ankyrinG expression and shortening, in APP/PS1 mice from P21 and loss of AIS 
integrity at 21 DIV in wild-type and APP/PS1 neurons in the presence of APP/PS1 
astrocytes. AnkyrinG decrease is due to mRNAs and protein reduction of retinoic 
acid synthesis enzymes Rdh1 and Aldh1b1, as well as ADNP (Activity-dependent 
neuroprotective protein) in APP/PS1 astrocytes. This effect was mimicked by 
wild-type astrocytes expressing ADNP shRNA. In the presence of APP/PS1 
astrocytes, wild-type neurons AIS is recovered by inhibition of retinoic acid 
degradation, and Adnp-derived NAP peptide (NAPVSIPQ) addition or P2X7 receptor 
inhibition, both regulated by retinoic acid levels. Moreover, P2X7 inhibitor 
treatment for 2 months impaired AIS disruption in APP/PS1 mice. Our findings 
extend current knowledge on AIS regulation, providing data to support the role 
of astrocytes in early postnatal AIS modulation. In conclusion, AD onset may be 
related to very early glial cell alterations that induce AIS and neuronal 
function changes, opening new therapeutic approaches to detect and avoid 
neuronal function loss.

Aging is associated with a number of physiologic changes including perturbed 
circadian rhythms; however, mechanisms by which rhythms are altered remain 
unknown. To test the idea that circulating factors mediate age-dependent changes 
in peripheral rhythms, we compared the ability of human serum from young and old 
individuals to synchronize circadian rhythms in culture. We collected blood from 
apparently healthy young (age 25-30) and old (age 70-76) individuals at 14:00 
and used the serum to synchronize cultured fibroblasts. We found that young and 
old sera are equally competent at initiating robust ~24 hr oscillations of a 
luciferase reporter driven by clock gene promoter. However, cyclic gene 
expression is affected, such that young and old sera promote cycling of 
different sets of genes. Genes that lose rhythmicity with old serum entrainment 
are associated with oxidative phosphorylation and Alzheimer's Disease as 
identified by STRING and IPA analyses. Conversely, the expression of cycling 
genes associated with cholesterol biosynthesis increased in the cells entrained 
with old serum. Genes involved in the cell cycle and transcription/translation 
remain rhythmic in both conditions. We did not observe a global difference in 
the distribution of phase between groups, but found that peak expression of 
several clock-controlled genes (PER3, NR1D1, NR1D2, CRY1, CRY2, and TEF) lagged 
in the cells synchronized ex vivo with old serum. Taken together, these findings 
demonstrate that age-dependent blood-borne factors affect circadian rhythms in 
peripheral cells and have the potential to impact health and disease via 
maintaining or disrupting rhythms respectively.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia globally, 
affecting around 50 million people and marked by cognitive decline and the 
accumulation of β-amyloid plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau. The limited 
treatment options and numerous failed clinical trials targeting β-amyloid (Aβ) 
highlight the need for novel approaches. Lowered proteasome activity is a 
consistent feature in AD, particularly in the hippocampus. Impaired proteasome 
function in AD is hypothesized to stem from direct inhibition by β-amyloid or 
hyperphosphorylated tau, disrupting critical neuronal processes such as memory 
formation and synaptic plasticity.
OBJECTIVES: This study tests the hypothesis that AD related deficits are driven 
in part by impaired proteasome function as a consequence of inhibition by Aβ. We 
evaluated how proteasome function is modulated by Aβ and the capacity of two 
proteasome-activating compounds, TAT1-8,9-TOD and TAT1-DEN to rescue Aβ-induced 
impairment in vitro, as well as survival deficits in cell culture and Aβ-induced 
cognitive deficits in Drosophila and mouse models.
RESULTS: Our study demonstrates that oligomeric β-amyloid binds to the 20S 
proteasome and impairs its activity and conformational stability. The oligomers 
also destabilize the 26S proteasome to release the free 20S proteasome. 
Treatment with proteasome activators TAT1-8,9TOD and TAT1-DEN rescue the 20S 
proteasome function and reduces cell death caused by Aβ42 toxicity in SK-N-SH 
cells. In Drosophila models overexpressing Aβ42, oral administration of 
proteasome agonists delayed mortality and restored cognitive function. Chronic 
treatment with TAT1-DEN protected against deficits in working memory caused by 
Aβ42 in mice and in hAPP(J20) mice with established deficits, acute TAT1-DEN 
treatment significantly improved spatial learning, with treated mice performing 
comparably to controls.
CONCLUSIONS: Aβ has dual impacts on 20S and 26S proteasome function and 
stability. Proteasome activation using TAT1-8,9TOD and TAT1-DEN shows promise in 
mitigating AD-like deficits by protecting against amyloid toxicity and enhancing 
proteasome function. These findings suggest that targeting proteasome activity 
could be a viable therapeutic approach for AD, warranting further investigation 
into the broader impacts of proteasome modulation on AD pathology.

40 Hz sensory stimulation ("flicker") has emerged as a new technique to 
potentially mitigate pathology and improve cognition in mouse models of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. However, it remains unknown how 40 Hz 
flicker affects neural codes essential for memory. Accordingly, we investigate 
the effects of 40 Hz flicker on neural representations of experience in the 
hippocampus of the 5XFAD mouse model of AD by recording 1000s of neurons during 
a goal-directed spatial navigation task. We find that an hour of daily exposure 
to 40 Hz audio-visual stimulation over 8 days leads to higher coordination 
between hippocampal subregions CA3 and CA1 during navigation. Consistent with 
CA3's role in generating sequential activity that represents future positions, 
40 Hz flicker exposure increased prospective coding of future positions. In 
turn, prospective coding was more prominent during efficient navigation 
behavior. Our findings show how 40 Hz flicker enhances key hippocampal activity 
during behavior that is important for memory.

Neuroinflammation is one of the main mechanisms contributing to the pathogenesis 
of Alzheimer's disease (AD), although its key role and the immune cells involved 
have not yet been identified. Blood monocytes appear to play a role in the 
clearance of AD-related amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau protein. This retrospective study 
evaluated a possible correlation between blood monocytes; the concentrations of 
Aβ, total tau (t-Tau), and phosphorylated tau (p-Tau) in the cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF); and cognitive decline assessed according to the Montreal Cognitive 
Assessment (MoCA). We collected data from 33 patients with AD or mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) due to AD (15 men and 18 women) and found, along with a 
significant reduction in the concentration of blood monocytes in women (p-value 
= 0.083),significant correlations between the number of blood monocytes and the 
concentration of t-Tau in CSF (p-value = 0.045) and between blood monocytes and 
MoCA score (p-value = 0.037). These results confirm the role of blood monocytes 
in the pathogenesis of AD, provide further evidence of a gender difference in 
the neuroinflammatory process underlying AD, and show that blood monocyte count 
may reflect the cognitive impairment of AD patients.

Growth and aging are fundamental elements of human development. Aging is defined 
by a decrease in physiological activities and higher illness vulnerability. 
Affected by lifestyle, environmental, and hereditary elements, aging results in 
disorders including cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and neurological diseases, 
which accounted for 16.1 million worldwide deaths in 2019. Stress-induced 
cellular senescence, caused by DNA damage, can reduce tissue regeneration and 
repair, promoting aging. The root cause of many age-related disorders is 
inflammation, encouraged by the senescence-associated secretory phenotype 
(SASP). Aging's metabolic changes and declining immune systems raise illness 
risk via promoting microbiome diversity. Stable, individual-specific skin and 
oral microbiomes are essential for both health and disease since dysbiosis is 
linked with periodontitis and eczema. Present from birth to death, the human 
microbiome, under the influence of diet and lifestyle, interacts symbiotically 
with the body. Poor dental health has been linked to Alzheimer's and Parkinson's 
diseases since oral microorganisms and systemic diseases have important 
interactions. Emphasizing the importance of microbiome health across the 
lifetime, this study reviews the understanding of the microbiome's role in 
aging-related diseases that can direct novel diagnosis and treatment approaches.

Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) holds significance in Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
where cognitive impairment correlates with insufficient acetylcholine levels. 
AChE's role involves the breakdown of acetylcholine, moderating cholinergic 
neuron activity to prevent overstimulation and signal termination. Hence, 
inhibiting AChE emerges as a potential treatment avenue for AD. A library of 
2500 compounds, derived from 25 traditionally used medicinal plants, was 
constructed using the IMPAAT database of traditional medicinal plants. The 
canonical SMILES of these compounds were collected and underwent virtual 
screening based on physicochemical properties, with subsequent determination of 
IC50 values for the screened compounds followed by analysis using machine 
learning (ML). Subsequently, a molecular docking study elucidated both binding 
affinity and interactions between these compounds and AChE. The top three 
compounds, exhibiting robust binding affinities, underwent MM-GBSA analysis for 
molecular docking validation, succeeded by pharmacokinetics and toxicity 
evaluations to gauge safety and efficacy. These three compounds underwent MD 
simulation studies to assess protein-ligand complex conformational stability. 
Additionally, Density Functional Theory (DFT) was employed to ascertain HOMO, 
LUMO, energy gap, and molecular electrostatic potential. Among 2500 compounds, 
physicochemical properties-based virtual screening identified 80 with good 
properties, of which 32 showed promising IC50 values. Molecular docking studies 
of these 32 compounds revealed various binding energies with AChE, with the best 
three compounds (CID 102267534, CID 15161648, CID 12441) selected for further 
analysis. MM-GBSA studies confirmed the promising binding energies of these 
three compounds, validating the molecular docking study. Further, the MD 
simulation studies have confirmed the structural and conformational stability of 
these three protein-ligand complexes. Finally, DFT calculations revealed 
favorable chemical features of these compounds. Thus, we can conclude that these 
three compounds (CID 102267534, CID 15161648, CID 12441) may inhibit the 
activity of AChE and can be useful as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative 
disorder characterized by cognitive decline, memory loss, and impaired daily 
functioning. Despite significant research, AD remains incurable, highlighting 
the critical need for early diagnosis and intervention to improve patient 
outcomes. Timely detection plays a crucial role in managing the disease more 
effectively. Pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on 
large-scale datasets, such as ImageNet, have been employed for AD 
classification, providing a head start for developing more accurate models.
METHODS: This paper proposes a novel hybrid deep learning approach that combines 
the strengths of two specific pretrained architectures. The proposed model 
enhances the representation of AD-related patterns by leveraging the feature 
extraction capabilities of both networks. We validated this model using a large 
dataset of MRI images from AD patients. Performance was evaluated in terms of 
classification accuracy and robustness against noise, and the results were 
compared to several commonly used models in AD detection.
RESULTS: The proposed hybrid model demonstrated significant performance 
improvements over individual models, achieving an accuracy classification rate 
of 99.85%. Comparative analysis with other models further revealed the 
superiority of the new architecture, particularly in terms of classification 
rate and resistance to noise interference.
DISCUSSION: The high accuracy and robustness of the proposed hybrid model 
suggest its potential utility in early AD detection. By improving feature 
representation through the combination of two pretrained networks, this model 
could provide clinicians with a more reliable tool for early diagnosis and 
monitoring of AD progression. This approach holds promise for aiding in timely 
diagnoses and treatment decisions, contributing to better management of 
Alzheimer's disease.

PURPOSE: The abnormal central glucose metabolism in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is 
related to the brain-gut axis. This study aims to explore the target of 
Danggui-Shaoyao-San (DSS) in improving cognitive impairment.
METHOD: This study analyzed the differences in mice intestinal flora by 16S rRNA 
sequencing. The cognitive protective effects of DSS were observed through the 
Morris water maze and the new object recognition. The mitigation effects of DSS 
on Aβ and p-tau, regulatory effects on glucose metabolism targets, and 
intestinal structure effects were observed through brain and colon slices 
staining. The differences in neural ultrastructure were compared by transmission 
electron microscopy.
FINDING: The results showed that DSS affected the composition of intestinal 
dominant bacteria and bacteria genera and regulated the abundance of intestinal 
bacteria in AD mice. DSS improved the behavior of AD mice, alleviated the 
deposition of AD pathological products in the brain and colon, regulated the 
expression of glycometabolism-related proteins, and improved the colon barrier 
structure and neural ultrastructure in the brain of mice with AD.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that DSS may affect AD central glucose 
metabolism and improve cognition by regulating the gut-brain axis.

BACKGROUND: Perivascular space (PVS) enlargement in ageing and Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) and the drivers of such a structural change in humans require 
longitudinal investigation. Elucidating the effects of demographic factors, 
hypertension, cerebrovascular dysfunction, and AD pathology on PVS dynamics 
could inform the role of PVS in brain health function as well as the complex 
pathophysiology of AD.
METHODS: We studied PVS in centrum semiovale (CSO) and basal ganglia (BG) 
computationally over three to four annual visits in 503 participants (255 
females; meanage = 70.78 ± 5.78) of the ongoing observational multicentre "DZNE 
Longitudinal Cognitive Impairment and Dementia Study" (DELCODE) cohort. We 
analysed data from subjects who were cognitively unimpaired (n = 401), had 
amnestic mild cognitive impairment (n = 71), or had AD (n = 31). We used linear 
mixed-effects modelling to test for changes of PVS volumes in relation to 
cross-sectional and longitudinal age, as well as sex, years of education, 
hypertension, white matter hyperintensities, AD diagnosis, and 
cerebrospinal-fluid-derived amyloid (A) and tau (T) status (available for 
46.71%; A-T-/A + T-/A + T + n = 143/48/39).
RESULTS: PVS volumes increased significantly over follow-ups (CSO: B = 0.03 
[0.02, 0.05], p < 0.001; BG: B = 0.05 [0.03, 0.07], p < 0.001). PVS enlargement 
rates varied substantially across subjects and depended on the participant's 
age, white matter hyperintensities volumes, and amyloid and tau status. PVS 
volumes were higher across elderly participants, regardless of region of 
interest (CSO: B = 0.12 [0.02, 0.21], p = 0.017; BG: B = 0.19 [0.09, 0.28], 
p < 0.001). Faster BG-PVS enlargement related to lower baseline white matter 
hyperintensities volumes (ρspearman = -0.17, pFDR = 0.001) and was more 
pronounced in individuals who presented with combined amyloid and tau positivity 
versus negativity (A + T +  > A-T-, pFDR = 0.004) or who were amyloid positive 
but tau negative (A + T +  > A + T-, pFDR = 0.07). CSO-PVS volumes increased at 
a faster rate with amyloid positivity as compared to amyloid negativity 
(A + T-/A + T +  > A-T-, pFDR = 0.021).
CONCLUSION: Our longitudinal evidence supports the relevance of PVS enlargement 
in presumably healthy ageing as well as in AD pathology. We further discuss the 
region-specific involvement of white matter hyperintensities and neurotoxic 
waste accumulation in PVS enlargement and the possibility of additional factors 
contributing to PVS progression. A comprehensive understanding of PVS dynamics 
could facilitate the understanding of pathological cascades and might inform 
targeted treatment strategies.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic disease among people aged 65 and older. As 
the aging population continues to grow at a rapid pace, AD has emerged as a 
pressing public health issue globally. Early detection of the disease is 
important, because increasing evidence has illustrated that early diagnosis 
holds the key to effective treatment of AD. In this work, we developed and 
refined a multi-layer cyclic Residual convolutional neural network model, 
specifically tailored to identify AD-related submicroscopic characteristics in 
the facial images of mice. Our experiments involved classifying the mice into 
two distinct groups: a normal control group and an AD group. Compared with the 
other deep learning models, the proposed model achieved a better detection 
performance in the dataset of the mouse experiment. The accuracy, sensitivity, 
specificity and precision for AD identification with our proposed model were as 
high as 99.78%, 100%, 99.65% and 99.44%, respectively. Moreover, the heat maps 
of AD correlation in the facial images of the mice were acquired with the class 
activation mapping algorithm. It was proven that the facial images contained 
AD-related submicroscopic features. Consequently, through our mouse experiments, 
we validated the feasibility and accuracy of utilizing a facial image-based deep 
learning model for AD identification. Therefore, the present study suggests the 
potential of using facial images for AD detection in humans through deep 
learning-based methods.

The hypothalamus plays an important role in aging, but it remains unclear 
regarding the underlying epigenetics and whether this hypothalamic basis can 
help address aging-related diseases. Here, by comparing mouse hypothalamus with 
two other limbic system components, we show that the hypothalamus is 
characterized by distinctively high-level DNA methylation during young age and 
by the distinct dynamics of DNA methylation and demethylation when approaching 
middle age. On the other hand, age-related DNA methylation in these limbic 
system components commonly and sensitively applies to genes in hypothalamic 
regulatory pathways, notably oxytocin (OXT) and gonadotropin-releasing hormone 
(GnRH) pathways. Middle age is associated with transcriptional declines of genes 
which encode OXT, GnRH and signaling components, which similarly occur in an 
Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like model. Therapeutically, OXT-GnRH combination is 
substantially more effective than individual peptides in treating AD-like 
disorders in male 5×FAD model. In conclusion, the hypothalamus is important for 
modeling age-related DNA methylation and developing hypothalamic strategies to 
combat AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative neurological disorder that 
chronically and irreversibly affects memory, cognitive function, learning 
ability, and organizational skills. Numerous studies have demonstrated BACE1 as 
a critical therapeutic target for AD, emphasizing the need for specific 
inhibition of BACE1 to develop effective therapeutics. However, current BACE1 
inhibitors have certain limitations. Therefore, the aim of this study was to 
identify potential novel candidates derived from natural products that can be 
utilized for the treatment of AD. To achieve this, 80,617 natural compounds from 
the ZINC database were subjected to virtual screening and subsequently filtered 
according to the rule of five (RO5), leading to the identification of 1,200 
compounds. Subsequently, the 1,200 compounds underwent molecular docking studies 
against the BACE1 receptor, utilizing high-throughput virtual screening (HTVS), 
standard precision (SP), and extra precision (XP) techniques to identify 
high-affinity ligands. Of the 50 ligands that exhibited the highest G-Scores in 
HTVS, further analysis was conducted using SP docking and scoring methods. This 
analysis led to the identification of seven ligands with enhanced binding 
affinities, which were then subjected to additional screening via XP docking and 
scoring. Finally, the stability of the most promising ligand in relation to 
BACE1 was assessed through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The 
computational screening demonstrated that the docking energy values for seven 
ligands binding to target enzymes ranged between - 6.096 and - 7.626 kcal/mol. 
Among these, ligand 2 (L2) exhibited the best binding energy at -7.626 kcal/mol 
with BACE1. MD simulations further confirmed the stability of the BACE1-L2 
complex, emphasizing the formation of a robust interaction between L2 and the 
target enzymes. Additionally, pharmacokinetic and drug-likeness evaluations 
indicated that L2 is non-carcinogenic and able to permeate the blood-brain 
barrier (BBB). The findings of this study will contribute to narrowing down the 
selection of candidates for subsequent in vitro and in vivo testing.

Alzheimer's disease, characterized by cognitive decline and memory loss, is 
associated with decreased acetylcholine levels due to acetylcholinesterase 
(AChE) activity. Compounds containing a coumarin heterocyclic core coupled with 
thiazole exhibit excellent acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity. In this 
work, we designed and synthesized a series of 4-(benzo[d]thiazole-2-yl) phenols 
based on 4-hydroxycoumarin. The compounds were synthesized and their inhibitory 
activities were evaluated through in vitro biological assays. Of the compounds 
investigated, 3i exhibited the strongest inhibitory activity, with an IC50 value 
of 2.7 µM. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations were employed to 
elucidate the binding interactions and stability of the synthesized compounds 
with AChE. The results demonstrated promising inhibitory activity, suggesting 
potential therapeutic applications for Alzheimer's disease. This research 
contributes to the development of coumarin-based heterocyclic compounds as 
effective AChE inhibitors.

Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are leading platforms for in vivo delivery of 
gene therapies, with six licensed AAV-based therapeutics attributed to their 
non-pathogenic nature, low immunogenicity, and high efficiency. In the realm of 
gene-based vaccines, one of the most vital therapeutic areas, AAVs are also 
emerging as promising delivery tools. We scrutinized AAVs, focusing on their 
virological properties, as well as bioengineering and chemical modifications to 
demonstrate their significant potential in gene vaccine delivery, and detailing 
the preparation of AAV particles. Additionally, we summarized the use of AAV 
vectors in vaccines for both infectious and non-infectious diseases, such as 
influenza, COVID-19, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer. Furthermore, this review, 
along with the latest clinical trial updates, provides a comprehensive overview 
of studies on the potential of using AAV vectors for gene vaccine delivery. It 
aims to deepen our understanding of the challenges and limitations in nucleic 
acid delivery and pave the way for future clinical success.

Lecanemab (Leqembi©, Biogen), a humanized anti-amyloid-beta monoclonal antibody, 
has been approved for early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) in several countries, 
including the US and Japan. However, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) 
recently issued a negative opinion on its marketing authorization, reflecting 
concerns over the clinical value and manageability of anti-amyloid treatments. 
This decision highlights the ongoing disconnect between research advancements 
and clinical practice, where the focus on biological markers over tangible 
clinical improvements remains contentious. Despite promising biological effects, 
lecanemab's clinical outcomes have been modest, raising questions about its 
therapeutic role. The EMA's refusal underscores the need to address doubts 
surrounding the real-world effectiveness and safety of such treatments, 
especially concerning amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIAs), a common 
side effect observed in clinical trials. The recent approval of lecanemab by the 
UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, despite the National 
Institute for Health and Care Excellence's rejection on cost-effectiveness 
grounds, further fuels the debate on the feasibility of anti-amyloid therapies. 
This commentary emphasizes the importance of real-world data on lecanemab's 
impact on cognitive decline, daily functioning, and side-effect management. As 
the global clinical use of lecanemab increases, continuous and standardized 
reporting on its outcomes is crucial for guiding future regulatory decisions and 
for potentially bridging the gap between research and practice in AD treatment.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
posing challenges to patients, caregivers, and society. Accessible and accurate 
information is crucial for effective AD management.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy, comprehensibility, 
clarity, and usefulness of the Generative Pretrained Transformer's (GPT) answers 
concerning the management and caregiving of patients with AD.
METHODS: In total, 14 questions related to the prevention, treatment, and care 
of AD were identified and posed to GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 in Chinese and English, 
respectively, and 4 respondent neurologists were asked to answer them. We 
generated 8 sets of responses (total 112) and randomly coded them in answer 
sheets. Next, 5 evaluator neurologists and 5 family members of patients were 
asked to rate the 112 responses using separate 5-point Likert scales. We 
evaluated the quality of the responses using a set of 8 questions rated on a 
5-point Likert scale. To gauge comprehensibility and participant satisfaction, 
we included 3 questions dedicated to each aspect within the same set of 8 
questions.
RESULTS: As of April 10, 2023, the 5 evaluator neurologists and 5 family members 
of patients with AD rated the 112 responses: GPT-3.5: n=28, 25%, responses; 
GPT-4: n=28, 25%, responses; respondent neurologists: 56 (50%) responses. The 
top 5 (4.5%) responses rated by evaluator neurologists had 4 (80%) GPT 
(GPT-3.5+GPT-4) responses and 1 (20%) respondent neurologist's response. For the 
top 5 (4.5%) responses rated by patients' family members, all but the third 
response were GPT responses. Based on the evaluation by neurologists, the 
neurologist-generated responses achieved a mean score of 3.9 (SD 0.7), while the 
GPT-generated responses scored significantly higher (mean 4.4, SD 0.6; P<.001). 
Language and model analyses revealed no significant differences in response 
quality between the GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models (GPT-3.5: mean 4.3, SD 0.7; GPT-4: 
mean 4.4, SD 0.5; P=.51). However, English responses outperformed Chinese 
responses in terms of comprehensibility (Chinese responses: mean 4.1, SD 0.7; 
English responses: mean 4.6, SD 0.5; P=.005) and participant satisfaction 
(Chinese responses: mean 4.2, SD 0.8; English responses: mean 4.5, SD 0.5; 
P=.04). According to the evaluator neurologists' review, Chinese responses had a 
mean score of 4.4 (SD 0.6), whereas English responses had a mean score of 4.5 
(SD 0.5; P=.002). As for the family members of patients with AD, no significant 
differences were observed between GPT and neurologists, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, or 
Chinese and English responses.
CONCLUSIONS: GPT can provide patient education materials on AD for patients, 
their families and caregivers, nurses, and neurologists. This capability can 
contribute to the effective health care management of patients with AD, leading 
to enhanced patient outcomes.

AI-Enabled Ultra-large Virtual Screening Identifies Potential Inhibitors of 
Choline Acetyltransferase for Theranostic Purposes.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias are among the primary 
neurological disorders and call for the urgent need for early-stage diagnosis to 
gain an upper edge in therapeutic intervention and increase the overall success 
rate. Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) is the key acetylcholine (ACh) 
biosynthesizing enzyme and a legitimate target for the development of biomarkers 
for early-stage diagnosis and monitoring of therapeutic responses. It is also a 
theranostic target for tackling colon and lung cancers, where overexpression of 
non-neuronal ChAT leads to the production of acetylcholine, which acts as an 
autocrine growth factor for cancer cells. Theranostics is a hybrid of 
diagnostics and therapeutics that can be used to locate cancer cells using 
radiotracers and kill them without affecting other healthy tissues. Traditional 
virtual screening protocols have a lot of limitations; given the current rate of 
chemical database expansion exceeding billions, much faster screening protocols 
are required. Deep docking (DD) is one such platform that leverages the power of 
deep neural network (DNN)-based virtual screening, empowering researchers to 
dock billions of molecules in a speedy, yet explicit manner. Here, we have 
screened 1.3 billion compounds library from the ZINC20 database, identifying the 
best-performing hits. With each iteration run where the first iteration gave 
∼116 million hits, the second iteration gave ∼3.7 million hits, and the final 
third iteration gave 168,447 hits from which further refinement gave us the top 
5 compounds as potential ChAT inhibitors. The discovery of novel ChAT inhibitors 
will enable researchers to develop new probes that can be used as novel 
theranostic agents against cancer and as early-stage diagnostics for the onset 
of AD, for timely therapeutic intervention to halt the further progression of 
AD.

Increased endothelial cell proliferation is a hallmark of arteriovenous 
malformations (AVMs) in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). Here, we 
report a cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6)-driven mechanism of cell cycle 
deregulation involved in endothelial cell proliferation and HHT pathology. 
Specifically, endothelial cells from the livers of HHT mice bypassed the G1/S 
checkpoint and progressed through the cell cycle at an accelerated pace. 
Phosphorylated retinoblastoma (pRB1)-a marker of G1/S transition through the 
restriction point-accumulated in endothelial cells from retinal AVMs of HHT mice 
and endothelial cells from skin telangiectasia samples from HHT patients. 
Mechanistically, inhibition of activin receptor-like kinase 1 signaling 
increased key restriction point mediators, and treatment with the CDK4/6 
inhibitors palbociclib or ribociclib blocked increases in pRB1 and retinal AVMs 
in HHT mice. Palbociclib also improved vascular pathology in the brain and 
liver, and slowed cell cycle progression in endothelial cells and endothelial 
cell proliferation. Endothelial cell-specific deletion of CDK6 was sufficient to 
protect HHT mice from AVM pathology. Thus, clinically approved CDK4/6 inhibitors 
might have the potential to be repurposed for HHT.

BACKGROUND: Despite the high clinical role of delusions as a transnosological 
psychopathological phenomenon, the number of experimental studies on the 
different types of delusions across schizophrenia spectrum is still relatively 
small, and their results are somehow inconsistent. We aimed to understand the 
current state of knowledge regarding the structural and functional brain 
alterations in delusions to determine whether particular types of delusions are 
associated with specific brain changes and to identify common alterations 
underlying the formation and persistence of delusions regardless of their 
content.
METHODS: For this systematic review, we followed PRISMA guidelines to search in 
PubMed for English papers published between 1953 and September 30, 2023. The 
initial inclusion criteria for screening purposes were articles that 
investigated delusions or subclinical delusional beliefs in schizophrenia 
spectrum disorders, high clinical or genetic risk for schizophrenia using fMRI, 
sMRI or/and dwMRI methods. Exclusion criteria during the screening phase were 
articles that investigated lesion-induced or substance-induced delusions, 
delusions in Alzheimer's disease and other neurocognitive disorders, single case 
studies and non-human studies. The publication metadata were uploaded to the 
web-tool for working on systematic reviews, Rayyan. For each of the studies, a 
table was filled out with detailed information.
RESULTS: We found 1752 records, of which 95 full-text documents were reviewed 
and included in the current paper. Both nonspecific and particular types of 
delusions were associated with widespread structural and functional alterations. 
The most prominent areas affected across all types of delusions were the 
superior temporal cortex (predominantly left language processing areas), 
anterior cingulate/medial prefrontal cortex and insula. The most reproducible 
findings in paranoia may be alterations in the functioning of the amygdala and 
its interactions with other regions. Somatic delusions and delusional 
infestation were mostly characterized by alterations in the insula and thalamus.
DISCUSSION: The data are ambiguous; however, in general the predictive 
processing framework seems to be the most widely accepted approach to explaining 
different types of delusions. Aberrant prediction errors signaling during 
processing of social, self-generated and sensory information may lead to 
inaccuracies in assessing the intentions of others, self-relevancy of ambiguous 
stimuli, misattribution of self-generated actions and unusual sensations, which 
could provoke delusional ideation with persecutory, reference, control and 
somatic content correspondingly. However, currently available data are still 
insufficient to draw conclusions about the specific biological mechanisms of 
predictive coding account of delusions. Thus, further studies exploring more 
homogeneous groups and interaction of diagnoses by types of delusions are 
needed. There are also some limitations in this review. Studies that investigate 
delusions induced by lesions, substance abuse or neurodegeneration and studies 
using modalities other than fMRI, sMRI or dwMRI were not included in the review. 
Due to the relatively small number of publications, we systematized them based 
on a certain type of delusions, while the results could also be affected by the 
diagnosis of patients, the presence and type of therapy, illness duration etc.

Current therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) do not delay its progression, 
therefore, novel disease-modifying strategies are urgently needed. Recently, an 
increasing number of compounds from natural origin with protective properties 
against AD have been identified. Mixtures or extracts obtained from natural 
products containing several bioactive compounds have multifunctional properties 
and have drawn the attention because multiple AD pathways can be simultaneously 
modulated. This study evaluated the in vitro and in vivo effect of the essential 
oil (EO) obtained from the hydrodistillation of Eucalyptus globulus leaves, and 
an extract obtained from the hydrodistillation residual water (HRW). It was 
observed that EO and HRW have anti-inflammatory effect in brain immune cells 
modeling AD, namely lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and amyloid-beta (Aβ)-stimulated 
microglia. In cell models that mimic AD-related neuronal dysfunction, HRW 
attenuated Aβ secretion and Aβ-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Since the 
HRW's major components did not cross the blood-brain barrier, both EO and HRW 
were administered to the APP/PS1 transgenic AD mouse model by an intranasal 
route, which reduced cortical and hippocampal Aβ levels, and to rescue memory 
deficits and anxiety-like behaviors. Finally, HRW and EO were found to regulate 
cholesterol levels in aged mice after intranasal administration, suggesting that 
these extracts can reduce hypercholesterolemia and avoid risk for AD 
development. Overall, findings support a protective role of E. globulus extracts 
against AD‑like pathology and cognitive impairment highlighting the underlying 
mechanisms. These extracts obtained from underused forest biomass could be 
useful to develop nutraceutical supplements helpful to avoid AD risk and to 
prevent its progression.

BACKGROUND: GLP-1 receptor agonists, traditionally used for treating type 2 
diabetes mellitus and obesity, have demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties. 
However, their potential neuroprotective effects in neurodegenerative disorders 
remain unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of GLP-1 receptor agonists on the risk of 
developing various neurodegenerative conditions in obese patients.
METHODS: This comprehensive retrospective cohort study analyzed data from 
5,307,845 obese adult patients across 73 healthcare organizations in 17 
countries. Propensity score matching was performed, resulting in 102,935 
patients in each cohort. We compared the risk of developing neurodegenerative 
disorders between obese patients receiving GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy and 
those who were not.
RESULTS: Obese patients treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists showed 
significantly lower risks of developing Alzheimer's disease (RR = 0.627, 
95 %CI = 0.481-0.817), Lewy body dementia (RR = 0.590, 95 %CI = 0.462-0.753), 
and vascular dementia (RR = 0.438, 95 %CI = 0.327-0.588). The risk reduction for 
Parkinson's disease was not statistically significant overall (RR = 0.784, 
95 %CI = 0.580-1.058) but was significant for semaglutide users (RR = 0.574, 
95 %CI = 0.369-0.893). Semaglutide consistently showed the most pronounced 
protective effects across all disorders. Additionally, a significant reduction 
in all-cause mortality was observed (HR = 0.525, 95 %CI = 0.493-0.558).
CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that the effects of GLP-1 receptor 
agonists may extend beyond their known metabolic and cardioprotective benefits 
to include neuroprotection, associated with a decreased risk of developing 
various neurodegenerative disorders. These findings suggest the potential for 
expanding the therapeutic applications of GLP-1 receptor agonists to improve 
neurocognitive outcomes. Further research is warranted to elucidate the 
mechanisms underlying these neuroprotective effects and to explore their 
clinical applications in neurodegenerative disease prevention and treatment.

Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), a key enzyme in the cyclooxygenase family, is pivotal 
in producing pro-inflammatory prostaglandins, driving chronic inflammation and 
related disorders. Targeting COX-2 with selective inhibitors can mitigate these 
conditions while avoiding the gastrointestinal and hepatotoxic/nephrotoxic side 
effects of traditional NSAIDs. However, the selectivity towards COX-2 inhibition 
has been associated with cardiovascular risks, necessitating the discovery of 
novel molecular scaffolds avoiding CVS side effects. This review focuses on 
advancements in Indole-based COX-2 inhibitors from 2013 to 2024, emphasizing 
their potential in treating inflammation, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease. The 
Indole scaffold, known for its versatility, allows for comprehensive 
structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis, facilitating the development of 
molecules with enhanced selectivity and potency. Molecules having different 
substituents attached to the Indole scaffold supported by molecular modeling 
data, is explored in detail. This review provides an concise overview of the 
pharmacophore profiles of Indole-based chemotherapeutics, contributing to the 
development of advanced strategies for selective COX-2 inhibition and addressing 
the challenges and opportunities in the field.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) presently stands as the most prevalent 
neurodegenerative disease. Existing research underscores the pivotal role of 
insulin signaling in the progression of AD. Acorus tatarinowii Schott (SCP), a 
traditional Chinese herbal, is employed for AD treatment in China. The volatile 
oil of Acorus tatarinowii Schott (SCP-oil) is the active component. However, its 
impact on AD-associated insulin resistance (AD-IR) remains inadequately 
investigated.
PURPOSE: This study used network pharmacology and experimental to investigate 
the effects and mechanisms of SCP-oil on cognitive improvement in AD by 
inhibiting IR.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: GC-Q/TOF-MS was employed to analyze the chemical 
composition of SCP-oil, while network pharmacology predicted the targets 
associated with SCP-oil in treating AD-IR to identify its regulatory mechanism. 
IR in the brain was simulated by intracerebroventricular streptozotocin 
administration (ICV-STZ). The neuroprotective and cognitive improvement effects 
of SCP-oil were assessed using the Morris water maze and hematoxylin and eosin, 
as well as Nissl staining. The expression levels of Neun and proteins related to 
p-tau, tau, amyloid-beta (Aβ), apoptosis, and the phosphatidylinositol 
3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) pathway were measured using 
immunohistochemistry and Western blotting, respectively. Dexamethasone 
(DXM)-induced HT22 cells were used for IR modeling. Chemical analysis determined 
the glucose consumption rate, and periodic acid Schiff staining was employed to 
detect glycogen deposition. Western Blots were utilized to investigate the 
expression of characteristic AD proteins, apoptosis-related proteins, and 
PI3K/AKT pathway-related proteins. The apoptosis rate was detected by flow 
cytometry. Reverse validation was further performed using LY294002 to evaluate 
the pharmacodynamic effects of SCP-oil after PI3K/AKT pathway inhibition.
RESULTS: A total of 25 chemical constituents were identified in SCP-oil. The 
network pharmacology findings indicated that SCP-oil holds the potential to 
ameliorate IR in the brain by activating the PI3K/AKT pathway, thereby improving 
AD. SCP-oil significantly improved ICV-STZ-induced cognitive dysfunction and 
pathological damage, reduced neuronal loss, Aβ deposition, and tau protein 
hyperphosphorylation, inhibited cell apoptosis, and activated the PI3K/AKT 
signaling pathway. Neuron loss, Aβ deposition, and tau protein 
hyperphosphorylation and cell apoptosis were further enhanced following 
treatment with LY294002, while the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was further 
inhibited, and the protective effect of SCP-oil was weakened.
CONCLUSION: SCP-oil exhibited the potential to ameliorate brain IR, inhibiting 
cell apoptosis by activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, thereby improving 
learning and memory ability.

Dementia describes a set of symptoms that occur when the brain is affected by 
certain diseases or conditions. These symptoms, such as memory loss and 
aggression, can cause distress to patients and their families, and can lead to 
long-term social care needs. Previous NICE guidelines (NG23, 2015) concluded 
that the likelihood of HRT in menopausal women affecting the risk of dementia 
was unknown. Recent media focus on this area has highlighted the need to clarify 
this. The current updated evidence review examined this question.

89. Early menopause: Menopause (update): Evidence review I.

London: National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE); 2024 Nov.

Menopause occurring between the age of 40 to 45 years is defined as early 
menopause and is experienced by around 8% of women. In the short-term early 
menopause may cause symptoms and psychological distress. Whether early menopause 
affects long-term health is uncertain, but it has been proposed as a risk factor 
for adverse outcomes such as cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis. Early 
menopause may also reduce the risk of breast cancer. The relative risks and 
benefits of HRT after early menopause are poorly understood and this review aims 
to quantify the impact of HRT on long-term health in people with early 
menopause.

The accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) and overactivation of microglia contribute to 
the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the interaction between 
microglial activation and Aβ deposition in AD remains elusive. Here we revealed 
that Aβ activates microglia and promotes the release of Galectin-9 (Gal-9), a 
member of the β-galactoside-binding family of lectins. The levels of Gal-9 in 
the cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissues of AD patients are higher than those 
in control subjects. Gal-9 interacts with Aβ and promotes its aggregation, 
generating Gal-9-Aβ fibrils with enhanced seeding activity and neurotoxicity. 
The expression of Gal-9 increases with age in the brains of APP/PS1 transgenic 
mice. Knockout of Gal-9 in APP/PS1 mice substantially reduced Aβ sedimentation, 
neuroinflammation, and cognitive impairment. Moreover, depletion of Gal-9 
inhibited the seeding activity of brain homogenates from APP/PS1 mice. These 
findings reveal a mechanism by which microglia-derived Gal-9 accelerates Aβ 
aggregation and seeding in AD. Thus, strategies aimed at inhibiting Gal-9 may 
hold promise as a disease-modifying therapy to alleviate AD pathology.

Cognition-oriented treatments (COTs) are a group of non-pharmacological 
treatments aimed at maintaining or improving cognitive functioning. Specific 
recommendations on the use of these interventions in people living with dementia 
(PLwD) are included in the Italian Guideline on the Diagnosis and Treatment of 
Dementia and Mild Cognitive Impairment, developed by the Italian National 
Institute of Health. This systematic review and meta-analysis, based on the 
GRADE methodology, is part of the guideline. Considered outcomes included the 
cognitive functions, quality of life, and functional abilities of PLwD, taking 
into account disease severity, modality and system of delivery, and form of the 
intervention. The effectiveness of these interventions on caregivers' outcomes 
was also assessed. Both group and individual cognitive stimulation were reported 
as effective in supporting cognitive functions in PLwD at any degree of 
severity. Individual cognitive training and group cognitive training were 
reported as effective in improving global cognitive functions in people with 
mild dementia. Cognitive rehabilitation appeared to be effective only in 
improving the functional abilities of people with mild dementia. Cognitive 
rehabilitation appeared to be the most effective in improving caregivers' 
outcomes, with results suggesting a reduction in care burden. The observed 
differences in the effectiveness of these interventions in people with different 
disease severity can be explained by the intrinsic characteristics of each 
intervention. Despite the large number of available studies, a high clinical, 
statistical, and methodological heterogeneity was observed. More 
methodologically rigorous studies are needed to clarify the effectiveness of 
each protocol and modality of intervention.

Deficits in memory, language, and other cognitive domains that impact an 
individual's ability to perform necessary tasks of daily living are symptoms of 
dementia, which is a major cause of death and disability in older adults. As the 
global population continues to age, deepening our understanding of dementia is 
crucial. Alzheimer's disease is the leading cause of dementia and accounts for 
between 60% and 80% of total dementia cases. Declines in episodic memory are 
considered a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease and occur early in disease 
progression. The cognitive effects of Alzheimer's disease differ from the 
cognitive changes expected in nonpathological or normal aging. While some 
cognitive changes are expected as a part of the aging processes, the declines in 
cognition associated with Alzheimer's disease are to a degree that the 
individual diagnosed with the disease is unable to function independently in 
activities of daily living. In this review, we will discuss how cognition is 
impacted by both normal and pathological aging, with a focus on Alzheimer's 
disease. We describe the progressive nature of Alzheimer's disease, as well as 
the effects of each stage of the disease on cognition.

Adults with Down syndrome represent the population with the highest risk of 
developing Alzheimer's disease worldwide. The cholinergic system is known to 
decline in Alzheimer's disease, with this decline responsible for many of the 
cognitive deficits that develop. The integrity of the cholinergic system across 
the lifespan in individuals with Down syndrome is not well characterized. Small 
fetal and infant post-mortem studies suggest an intact cholinergic projection 
system with a potential reduction in cholinergic receptors, while post-mortem 
studies in adults with Down syndrome reveal an age-related decrease in 
cholinergic integrity. Advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron 
emission tomography (PET) over the last 20 years have allowed for studies 
investigating the changes in cholinergic integrity across aging and during the 
development of Alzheimer's disease. One large cross-sectional study demonstrated 
reduced cholinergic basal forebrain volume measured by MRI associated with 
increasing Alzheimer's disease pathology. In a small cohort of adults with Down 
syndrome, we have recently reported that PET measures of cholinergic integrity 
negatively correlated with amyloid accumulation. New disease-modifying 
treatments for Alzheimer's disease and treatments under development for 
Alzheimer's disease in Down syndrome have the potential to preserve the 
cholinergic system, while treatments targeting the cholinergic system directly 
may be used in conjunction with disease-modifying therapies to improve cognitive 
function further. A greater understanding of cholinergic neuronal and receptor 
integrity across the lifespan in individuals with Down syndrome will provide 
insights as to when targeting the cholinergic system is an appropriate 
therapeutic option and, in the future, maybe a valuable screening tool to 
identify individuals that would most benefit from cholinergic interventions.

BACKGROUND: The advancement of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions in early 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) has demanded the economic evaluation of such 
interventions. Resource utilization and cost estimates in early AD and, more 
specifically, the amyloid-positive population are still lacking. We aimed to 
provide cost estimates in AD in relation to disease severity and compare these 
with the control population. We also aimed to provide cost estimates for a 
subset of the AD population with both clinical diagnosis and amyloid-positive 
confirmation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective longitudinal analysis of 
resource utilization using data from national registries. A cohort from the 
national Swedish registry for cognitive/dementia disorders (SveDem) includes all 
clinically diagnosed AD between 2013 and 2020. The study population included 
31,951 people with AD and 63,902 age- and sex-matched controls (1:2). The 
population was followed until death, the end of December 2020, or 2 years from 
the last clinic visit. Direct medical and social costs were estimated from other 
national registries. Direct medical costs include costs for medications and 
inpatient and outpatient clinical visits. Direct social costs include costs for 
institutionalization, home care, short-term care, support for daytime 
activities, and housing support. Mean annual costs and 95% confidence intervals 
were obtained by bootstrapping, presented in 2021 Swedish Krona (SEK) (1 
SEK = 0.117 USD, 1 SEK = 0.0985 EUR in 2021), and disaggregated by AD severity, 
cost component, sex, age group, and care setting.
RESULTS: Mean annual costs for individuals with clinically diagnosed AD were SEK 
99,906, SEK 290,972, SEK 479,524, and SEK 795,617 in mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI), mild, moderate, and severe AD. The mean annual costs for the population 
with both clinical diagnosis and amyloid-positive AD confirmation (N = 5610) 
were SEK 57,625, SEK 179,153, SEK 333,095, and SEK 668,073 in MCI, mild, 
moderate, and severe AD, respectively. The mean annual costs were higher in 
institutionalized than non-institutionalized patients, females than males, and 
older than younger age groups. Inpatient and drug costs were similar in all AD 
severity stages, but outpatient costs decreased with AD severity. Costs for 
institutionalization, home care, support for daytime activities, and short-term 
care increased with AD severity, whereas the cost of housing support decreased 
with AD severity.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study estimating annual costs in people with AD 
from MCI to severe AD, including those for the amyloid-positive population. The 
study provides cost estimates by AD severity, cost components, care settings, 
sex, and age groups, allowing health economic modelers to apply the costs based 
on different model structures and populations.

Comment on
    JAMA Neurol. 2024 Dec 1;81(12):1245-1246. doi: 10.1001/jamaneurol.2024.3766.

IMPORTANCE: Since 2018, a movement has emerged to define Alzheimer disease (AD) 
as a purely biological entity based on biomarker findings. The recent revision 
of the Alzheimer's Association (AA) criteria for AD furthers this direction. 
However, concerns about a purely biological definition of AD being applied 
clinically, the understanding of AD by society at large, and the translation of 
blood-based biomarkers into clinical practice prompt these International Working 
Group (IWG) updated recommendations.
OBJECTIVE: To consider the revised AA criteria and to offer an alternative 
definitional view of AD as a clinical-biological construct for clinical use. The 
recommendations of the 2021 IWG diagnostic criteria are updated for further 
elaborating at-risk and presymptomatic states.
EVIDENCE REVIEW: PubMed was searched for articles published between July 1, 
2020, and March 1, 2024, using the terms "biomarker" OR "amyloid" OR "tau" OR 
"neurodegeneration" OR "preclinical" OR "CSF" OR "PET" OR "plasma" AND 
"Alzheimer's disease." The references of relevant articles were also searched.
FINDINGS: In the new AA diagnostic criteria, AD can be defined clinically as 
encompassing cognitively normal people having a core 1 AD biomarker. However, 
recent literature shows that the majority of biomarker-positive cognitively 
normal individuals will not become symptomatic along a proximate timeline. In 
the clinical setting, disclosing a diagnosis of AD to cognitively normal people 
with only core 1 AD biomarkers represents the most problematic implication of a 
purely biological definition of the disease.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The ultimate aim of the field was to foster effective 
AD treatments, including preventing symptoms and dementia. The approach of 
diagnosing AD without a clinical and biological construct would be unwarranted 
and potentially concerning without a clear knowledge of when or whether symptoms 
will ever develop. It is recommended that those who are amyloid-positive only 
and, more generally, most biomarker-positive cognitively normal individuals, 
should not be labeled as having AD. Rather, they should be considered as being 
at risk for AD. The expansion of presymptomatic AD is viewed as a better 
diagnostic construct for those with a specific pattern of biomarkers, indicating 
that they are proximate to the expression of symptoms in the near future.

BACKGROUND: Mediterranean diet may enhance cognitive function and delay the 
progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We conducted a systematic review to 
investigate the effect of oleocanthal (OC) from extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) on 
amyloid-β (Aβ) burden in preclinical models of AD, considering the 
anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects of EVOO biophenols, which are key 
components of the Mediterranean dietary model.
METHODS: The literature was searched through six electronic databases until 
February 2023. Screening of 52 retrieved articles for inclusion criteria 
resulted in 7 preclinical reports evaluating the effect of an OC-supplemented 
diet on AD trajectories by means of Aβ load or clearance in affected models. 
Reports were appraised for risk of bias using the SYRCLE's RoB tool. A protocol 
was registered on PROSPERO.
RESULTS: Case control prevailed over the case-crossover design, and the 
geographical distribution was uniformly American. The study population mostly 
included 5xFAD, otherwise TgSwDI or wild-type C57BL/6 mouse models. We found a 
role of OC in reducing Aβ load in the hippocampal parenchyma and microvessels 
compared with controls. An increased cerebral clearance of Aβ through the 
bloodbrain barrier and a substantial improvement in metabolic and behavioral 
parameters were also reported in preclinical models under an OC-enriched diet. 
The risk of bias was shown to be moderate overall.
CONCLUSION: Preclinical data are promising about the effects of OC from the 
Mediterranean diet's EVOO in relieving the burden of Aβ in AD; however, further 
evidence is needed to corroborate the efficacy of this biophenol and strengthen 
the speculated causal pathway.

BACKGROUND: Trazodone, an antidepressant drug is also largely used in several 
medical contexts. Insomnia, behavioral disorders, and anxiety may be underlying 
symptoms for prescribing trazodone. This cross-sectional study aims to identify 
reasons for trazodone prescription, assess the efficacy, as well as identify any 
related side effects in older persons living in long term care facilities 
(LTCFs).
METHODS: Older adults aged ≥ 60 years, at risk of or affected with Covid-19 and 
enrolled in the GeroCovid Observational study from LTCFs, and using trazodone 
were included. A structured questionnaire was administered to treating 
physicians regarding reasons for trazodone prescription, discontinuation, 
possible adverse events and benefits.
RESULTS: Thirty-seven out 74 LTCFs participating in both the GeroCovid and 
GeroCovid Vax studies completed the questionnaire regarding trazodone use. Of 
the 427 participants included in this study analysis, we found that 43% had 
diagnoses of dementia and depression, 33% had dementia, no behavioral and 
psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) and no depression, 14% had dementia 
with BPSD and no depression, and < 11% had only depression. The main reasons for 
trazodone prescription included agitation, insomnia, depression and anxiety. 
Trazodone use was reported as partially or totally effective in more than 90% of 
participants using the drug. Falls were the most frequent adverse event (30% of 
participants).
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that trazodone behaves as an eclectic 
antidepressant that, in the clinical practice, may also be used for BPSD and 
insomnia, especially in older people with dementia.

Tauopathies are neurodegenerative diseases that manifest with intracellular 
accumulation and aggregation of tau protein. These include Pick's disease, 
progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration and argyrophilic grain 
disease, where tau is believed to be the primary disease driver, as well as 
secondary tauopathies, such as Alzheimer's disease. There is a need to develop 
effective pharmacological therapies. Here we tested >1,400 clinically approved 
compounds using transgenic zebrafish tauopathy models. This revealed that 
carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitors protected against tau toxicity. CRISPR 
experiments confirmed that CA depletion mimicked the effects of these drugs. CA 
inhibition promoted faster clearance of human tau by promoting lysosomal 
exocytosis. Importantly, methazolamide, a CA inhibitor used in the clinic, also 
reduced total and phosphorylated tau levels, increased neuronal survival and 
ameliorated neurodegeneration in mouse tauopathy models at concentrations 
similar to those seen in people. These data underscore the feasibility of in 
vivo drug screens using zebrafish models and suggest serious consideration of CA 
inhibitors for treating tauopathies.

Thrombosis, the formation of blood clots in arteries or veins, poses a 
significant health risk by disrupting the blood flow. It can potentially lead to 
major cardiovascular complications such as acute myocardial infarction or 
ischemic stroke (arterial thrombosis) and deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary 
embolism (venous thrombosis). Nevertheless, over the course of several decades, 
researchers have observed an association between different cardiovascular events 
and neurodegenerative diseases, which progressively harm and impair parts of the 
nervous system, particularly the brain. Furthermore, thrombotic complications 
have been identified in numerous clinical instances of neurodegenerative 
diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple 
sclerosis, and Huntington's disease. Substantial research indicates that 
endothelial dysfunction, vascular inflammation, coagulation abnormalities, and 
platelet hyperactivation are commonly observed in these conditions, collectively 
contributing to an increased risk of thrombosis. Thrombosis can, in turn, 
contribute to the onset, pathogenesis, and severity of these neurological 
disorders. Hence, this concise review comprehensively explores the correlation 
between cardiovascular diseases and neurodegenerative diseases, elucidating the 
cellular and molecular mechanisms of thrombosis in these neurodegenerative 
diseases. Additionally, a detailed discussion is provided on the commonly 
employed antithrombotic medications in the context of these neuronal diseases.

Brain connectivity arises from interactions across biophysical scales, ranging 
from molecular to cellular to anatomical to network level. To date, there has 
been little progress toward integrated analysis across these scales. To bridge 
this gap, from a unique cohort of 98 individuals, we collected antemortem 
neuroimaging and genetic data, as well as postmortem dendritic spine 
morphometric, proteomic and gene expression data from the superior frontal and 
inferior temporal gyri. Through the integration of the molecular and dendritic 
spine morphology data, we identified hundreds of proteins that explain 
interindividual differences in functional connectivity and structural 
covariation. These proteins are enriched for synaptic structures and functions, 
energy metabolism and RNA processing. By integrating data at the genetic, 
molecular, subcellular and tissue levels, we link specific biochemical changes 
at synapses to connectivity between brain regions. These results demonstrate the 
feasibility of integrating data from vastly different biophysical scales to 
provide a more comprehensive understanding of brain connectivity.
