Phosphatidylcholine (PC), a choline-containing phospholipid abundant in chicken 
eggs, is widely consumed as a dietary supplement. Epidemiological studies 
suggest that PC intake may improve cognitive function in patients with 
neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, although the underlying 
mechanisms remain largely unclear. In this study, we investigated the 
anti-inflammatory effects of PC and its molecular mechanisms using an in vitro 
inflammation model involving lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated MG6 mouse 
microglial cells. PC significantly suppressed the LPS-induced expression of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), 
interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Mechanistically, PC inhibited 
the phosphorylation of inhibitor kappa Bα (IκBα), thereby preventing the nuclear 
translocation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). PC also reduced the phosphorylation 
of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase 
(MAPK), and suppressed the nuclear translocation of activator protein-1 (AP-1), 
composed of c-Fos and c-Jun. These findings indicate that PC attenuates 
LPS-induced microglial inflammation via the NF-κB and JNK/p38 MAPK signaling 
pathways. Given the proposed role of chronic neuroinflammation in the 
progression of neurodegenerative diseases, the anti-inflammatory properties of 
PC demonstrated here may provide new insights into its potential contribution to 
maintaining brain health.

OBJECTIVE: The treatment of dementia is increasingly likely to focus on 
dementia-related biomarkers. Unfortunately, there is variability with regard to 
biomarker-related effects. This analysis tests an algorithm capable of 
identifying persons adversely impacted by any dementia-related biomarker in this 
case, amyloidopathy as estimated by positron emission tomography (PET).
METHOD: N = 1,737 subjects of the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative 
were assigned to amyloidopathy-affliction classes. Moderation effects were 
tested by chi-square difference.
RESULTS: 39.3% of subjects with (+) PET results were assigned to the afflicted 
class. The afflicted subjects had greater dementia severity and higher amyloid 
burdens. These effects persisted at 36 months. Furthermore, the association 
between amyloid burden and dementia severity was moderated by affliction class. 
Afflicted nondemented cases with positive PET findings were more likely to 
convert to clinical "Alzheimer's disease" over 48 months, by Cox's F: F(312, 
154) = 1.27, p = .05. PET assessed amyloid burden was not related to dementia 
severity in resilient PET (+) cases.
CONCLUSION: Our approach could allow for more accurate prediction of biomarker 
effects and guide precision interventions against specific biomarkers. (PsycInfo

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease marked by 
cognitive decline, neuronal degeneration, and the accumulation of intracellular 
neurofibrillary tangles, extracellular amyloid plaques, and neuroinflammation. 
Current treatment strategies, such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) 
and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists, offer symptomatic relief but fail 
to stop disease progression. The development of multi-target-directed ligands 
(MTDLs) has gained attention as a method to address the complex pathology of AD. 
This review provides a detailed account of the journey of AChE inhibitors from 
single-target ligands to MTDLs, emphasizing the structural changes that improve 
target specificity, blood-brain barrier penetration, and therapeutic impact. By 
exploring these advancements, the review highlights the potential of MTDLs to 
overcome the limitations of traditional single-target approaches and contribute 
to the discovery of more effective anti-Alzheimer therapies along with 
discussing potential pitfalls.

IMPORTANCE: With increased payer coverage and the advent of antiamyloid 
therapies, clinical use of amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) is likely 
to increase to help guide the diagnosis and treatment of patients with cognitive 
impairment. However, unlike most previous research studies, in clinical 
practice, scan acquisition is less standardized, interpretation typically relies 
purely on visual reads rather than scan quantification, and patients have more 
frequent comorbidities, all of which might compromise test accuracy.
OBJECTIVE: To compare visual interpretation of amyloid-PET in real-world 
clinical settings to scan interpretation based on central quantification, in 
order to assess the accuracy of clinical reads.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional quality improvement 
study used data from the Imaging Dementia-Evidence for Amyloid Scanning study, 
collected between February 2016 and January 2018 and analyzed between December 
2021 and April 2023. The setting included 294 imaging facilities in the US. 
Medicare beneficiaries 65 years or older with cognitive decline for whom 
Alzheimer disease was a diagnostic consideration were recruited by dementia 
specialists from their clinical practices.
EXPOSURES: Amyloid-PET with [18F]florbetapir, [18F]florbetaben, or 
[18F]flutemetamol.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: PET scans were visually interpreted as positive or 
negative by local radiologists or nuclear medicine physicians following approved 
guidelines. Independently, scans were centrally processed and quantified using 
the standardized Centiloid (CL) scale. We applied an a priori autopsy-based 
threshold of 24.4 CL to quantitatively define scan positivity.
RESULTS: Of 18 293 participants included in the parent study, scan images were 
available for 10 774 (59%), of which Centiloids were successfully calculated for 
10 361 (96%). Median (IQR) patient age was 75 (71-80) years; 5245 patients (51%) 
were female, 6500 (63%) had mild cognitive impairment, and 3861 (37%) had 
dementia). Participants self-reported the following races and ethnicities: 1 
Alaska Native (0%), 23 American Indian (0.2%), 188 Asian (1.8%), 316 Black 
(3.1%), 449 Hispanic or Latino (4.3%), 8 Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific 
Islander (0.1%), and 9125 White (88.2%). A total of 6332 scans (61%) were 
visually read as positive, and 6121 (59%) were quantitatively positive. 
Agreement between visual reads and quantitative classification was 86.3% (95% 
CI, 85.7%-87.0%; Cohen κ = 0.72; 95% CI, 0.70-0.73). A total of 5519 (53%) scans 
were positive visually and quantitatively (V+/Q+), 3416 (33%) were negative by 
both (V-/Q-), 813 (8%) were V+/Q-, and 602 (6%) were V-/Q+. Female sex (female: 
4581/5241 [87.4%]; male: 4354/5109 [85.2%]; P =.001), White race (White race: 
7900/9125 [86.6%]; non-White race: 1035/1225 [84.5%]; P =.046), and use of 
[18F]flutemetamol and [18F]florbetaben ([18F]flutemetamol: 559/628 [89.0%]; 
[18F]florbetaben: 2664/3032 [87.9%]; [18F]florbetapir: 5712/6690 [85.4%]; P 
<.001), compared with [18F]florbetapir, were associated with higher 
visual-quantitative concordance. Scans within a 10- to 40-CL borderline 
positivity zone were more likely to be discordant.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cross-sectional study found high concordance 
between local visual reads and central quantification of clinical amyloid-PET 
scans, supporting the validity of amyloid-PET visual reads in real-world 
clinical practice.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that causes progressive 
neurodegeneration and a variety of cognitive deficits. Of note, mitochondrial 
malfunctions occur early in the disease's development. Mitophagy impairment 
leads to the build-up of damaged mitochondria inside the cells, causing 
malfunction and eventual death of the cells. This review summarizes the 
mechanisms linking mitochondrial damage and autophagy dysregulation to AD and 
highlights potential therapeutic opportunities. We summarize how mitochondrial 
dysfunction contributes to AD, including defects in mitochondrial biogenesis, 
impaired dynamics, the impact of AD-related protein aggregates on mitochondrial 
integrity, and defective axonal transport. We also explore the roles of 
mitophagy in AD, including its function in the removal of harmed proteins and 
organelles. Finally, we highlight the therapeutic strategies for the treatment 
of AD, targeting molecular components involved in mitochondrial damage and 
autophagy dysregulation in AD, i.e., antioxidants, mitochondrial modulators, and 
mitophagy enhancers.

As the most common neurodevelopmental and mental disorder around the world, 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) affects primarily children and 
adolescents. Both genetic (polygenicity) and environmental variables interplay 
in the etiology of this disorder. The Wnt signaling pathway, which regulates 
proliferation and differentiation during neurodevelopment, has been implicated 
in ADHD. Clinically, individuals with ADHD may exhibit delays in structural and 
functional brain development. Available evidence suggests that methylphenidate 
(MPH) treatment can potentially improve these delays. However, the molecular and 
cellular mechanisms underlying ADHD and the therapeutic targets of MPH are not 
yet completely elucidated. In a pilot investigation, the proliferation of neural 
stem cells (NSCs) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) was 
significantly lowered in ADHD male patients. Yet, we did not observe any 
variations in proliferation rates during the iPSC stage. To extend the earlier 
results, we increased the sample size to include females, explored whether MPH 
may improve NSC proliferation in ADHD and clarified the role of the Wnt pathway. 
To do so, iPSC and NSC proliferation from five ADHD patients and five controls 
was assessed. The results corroborated our previous findings of decreased 
proliferation in ADHD NSCs. Conversely, ADHD NSC proliferation was modestly 
regulated by MPH treatment at 10 nM, which also showed modulatory effects on Wnt 
signaling in this group. Interestingly, no increase in proliferation was seen 
when DKK1 blocked Wnt signaling before MPH treatment. These findings suggest MPH 
regulates the canonical Wnt pathway and may partially explain ADHD-related 
neurodevelopmental abnormalities and MPH-specific benefits.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition marked by 
cognitive decline, particularly in memory and reasoning, which often culminates 
in severe dementia. Despite extensive research, the precise mechanisms 
underlying AD remain elusive. One of the key contributors to AD pathogenesis is 
the dysfunction of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), an organelle involved in 
protein folding, calcium regulation, and lipid metabolism. When ER function is 
compromised, it leads to ER stress, a condition increasingly associated with AD 
development. ER stress activates the unfolded protein response (UPR), a cellular 
mechanism that, when overstressed, can result in neuronal death. Further 
research has revealed how ER stress interacts with other hallmark features of 
AD, including amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaque accumulation and tau 
hyperphosphorylation. Emerging evidence suggests that targeting ER stress and 
its associated pathways could present new therapeutic avenues for AD. This 
review examines the role of the ER in AD, outlining the mechanisms through which 
ER dysfunction accelerates disease progression and evaluating novel therapeutic 
strategies designed to restore ER balance and mitigate AD symptoms.

Excessive fat consumption increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
potentially through diet-induced neuroinflammation. Microglia, the brain's 
immune cells, are affected by obesity and diet. Phytosterols (PS), plant-derived 
cholesterol-like compounds, accumulate in the brain with age, and their content 
correlates with dietary intake. We hypothesize that the accumulation of PS 
modulates microglial activation and exerts anti-inflammatory effects. We 
investigated the effects of a normal diet (ND), high-fat diet (HFD), HFD with 2% 
PS (HFD+2% PS), and HFD with 4% PS (HFD+4% PS) on neuroinflammation in female 
and male C57BL/6J mice. Flow cytometry (FC) of microglia showed no significant 
regulation of pro- (IFN-γ, IL-1β, TNF-α) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokines 
due to diet, but sex- and age-dependent differences were observed. 
Immunofluorescence staining showed no TREM2 upregulation, indicating a lack of 
microglial activation in response to HFD. PS supplementation significantly 
reduced HFD-induced weight gain, suggesting metabolic effects. Contrary to 
existing research, we found no evidence of HFD-induced neuroinflammation or 
microglial activation. However, the reduction in weight gain with PS 
supplementation suggests potential metabolic benefits, which could have 
implications for the treatment of obesity. The potential effects on 
neuroinflammation remain unclear.

In Vivo and Bioinformatics Evaluation of Nine Traditional Chinese Medicine 
Compounds Targeting Acetylcholinesterase and Butyrylcholinesterase Enzymes in 
Alzheimer's Disease.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by cholinergic dysfunction 
and oxidative stress, creating a need for the development of new therapeutic 
agents. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) compounds, such as hainanolidol and 
norwogonin, have shown potential neuroprotective activity.
OBJECTIVES: This study investigates the inhibitory action of these compounds on 
cholinesterase enzymes and their possible therapeutic application in an AD-like 
rat model generated by lead acetate (PbAc), a well-known neurotoxicant that 
mimics AD-associated oxidative damage and cognitive decline.
METHODS: The cholinesterase inhibitory activity of nine TCM compounds was 
assessed in vitro against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase 
(BuChE), with donepezil and tacrine as controls. Hainanolidol and norwogonin, 
identified as the most potent inhibitors, were further evaluated in a 
PbAc-induced AD rat model to assess their neuroprotective effects. Oxidative 
stress biomarkers malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), cholinesterase 
activity, and in silico molecular interactions were analyzed, including docking 
studies, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and ADME-toxicity profiling.
RESULTS: Hainanolidol and norwogonin showed strong nanomolar-range inhibition of 
both AChE and BuChE, with considerable IC50 values superior to those of standard 
inhibitors. In the PbAc-induced AD model, both compounds significantly reduced 
MDA levels and increased GSH levels, indicating oxidative stress mitigation.The 
level of cholinesterase activity inhibition was as effective as, or more 
effective than, the suppression achieved by standard treatments, particularly 
regarding AChE, thus suggesting enhanced therapeutic potential compared to 
donepezil. Molecular docking and MD simulations confirmed stable binding 
interactions with key catalytic residues of AChE and BuChE, reinforcing their 
inhibitory mechanisms. ADME-toxicity analysis further demonstrated favorable 
pharmacokinetics and safety profiles.
CONCLUSIONS: This study concludes that both hainanolidol and norwogonin are 
worthy of being regarded as dual cholinesterase inhibitors with antioxidant 
properties, which may serve as alternative therapeutics for AD. The use of PbAc 
as an AD model underscores the role of environmental neurotoxins in disease 
pathogenesis, offering insights into novel intervention strategies. Advanced 
preclinical and clinical studies are needed for further validation.

PURPOSE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by cognitive decline and 
memory impairment, amyloid plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). Current 
therapies provide symptomatic treatment but do not address the exact cause of 
the disease. Caraway oil, derived from Carum carvi, is rich in carvone and 
limonene with reported anticholinesterase, antioxidant, and neuroprotective 
properties. This study aimed to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of caraway 
oil in an aluminum chloride-induced rat model of neurotoxicity.
METHODS: Albino Wistar rats were randomized into five groups: normal control, 
disease control (aluminum chloride, 100 mg/kg), standard (donepezil, 1 mg/kg), 
and caraway oil treatment groups (100 and 200 mg/kg). Treatments were 
administered orally for 42 days. Behavioral assessments included locomotor 
activity, the Morris water maze, the elevated plus maze, and passive avoidance 
tests. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and oxidative stress markers were 
assessed in the hippocampus and cortex.
RESULTS: Caraway oil administration significantly improved locomotor activity 
and spatial memory in rats at 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg. The oil showed a 
significant effect on oxidative stress parameters in the hippocampus and cortex. 
AChE activity was also improved significantly (p<0.001) after caraway oil 
treatment.
CONCLUSION: Caraway oil demonstrated significant neuroprotective effects in 
aluminum chloride-induced neurotoxicity, improving cognitive and behavioral 
functions and reducing oxidative stress. These findings suggest that caraway oil 
may have therapeutic potential in the management of AD.

BACKGROUND: Tanshinone ⅡA (Tan ⅡA) is a monomer extracted from Salvia 
miltiorrhiza Bunge. Animal studies have demonstrated its potential in providing 
cognitive protection in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the overall effects remain 
inconclusive, and its multiple mechanisms have not been systematically 
summarized.
OBJECTIVE: This systematic review and meta-analysis (SR/MA) aimed to evaluate 
the overall effects of Tan ⅡA on cognitive function in AD animal models and to 
summarize the mechanisms.
METHODS: Seven databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, China National 
Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Biological Medical Disc, Chongqing VIP, and 
Wanfang databases) and grey literature were retrieved. Risk of bias was 
evaluated following the Systematic Review Center for Laboratory Animal 
Experiments. The mean difference (MD) or standard mean difference (SMD) with 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) were used to evaluate the effect of Tan ⅡA on 
cognitive function, neuropathology, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, 
apoptosis, and neural/synaptic plasticity, with P < 0.05 considered a 
significant difference. The effect and potential mechanisms of Tan ⅡA were 
demonstrated by performing multiple subgroup analyses.
RESULTS: Nineteen studies involving 581 AD animals were identified. The included 
studies showed satisfactory reporting quality but had certain risks of bias in 
methodology. Tan ⅡA ameliorated cognitive deficits, evidenced by reducing escape 
latency (MD = -17.94 s; 95% CI: -22.92 to -12.96) and increasing time spent in 
the target quadrant (MD = 10.69 s; 95% CI: 7.32-14.07). It attenuated 
neuropathological damage by reducing amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques in thioflavine S 
staining (SMD = -3.46; 95% CI: -5.65 to -1.26) and increasing neuronal density 
in Nissl staining (SMD = 2.82; 95% CI: 2.11-3.52) and NeuN staining (SMD = 2.89; 
95% CI: 1.71-4.08). Tan ⅡA also demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects through 
downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines [tumor necrosis factor-alpha 
(TNF-α), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6)] and antioxidant 
stress properties by increasing superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione 
peroxidase (GSH-Px) levels while reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and 
malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. Additionally, it exhibited antiapoptotic effects 
by increasing the B-cell lymphoma-2/Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bcl-2/Bax) ratio 
and decreasing Caspase-3 expression. Moreover, treatment improved 
neuronal/synaptic plasticity by upregulating postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95) 
and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels.
CONCLUSION: Tan ⅡA could improve cognitive function and neuropathology through 
multiple mechanisms. This suggests that Tan IIA may serve as a viable candidate 
for the development of therapeutic strategies for AD.

BACKGROUND: Patients with Alzheimer's disease or dementia are at increased risk 
for COVID-19 hospitalization and mortality. However, no study has examined 
whether memory function is associated with COVID-19 outcomes in general older 
adults.
METHODS: Data were obtained from SHARE (the Survey of Health, Ageing and 
Retirement in Europe), HRS (the Health and Retirement Study), and ELSA (the 
English Longitudinal Study of Ageing), three prospective and representative 
cohorts of non-institutionalized adults aged 50 years and older in 25 European 
countries plus Israel, the United States, and the United Kingdom, respectively. 
Memory function was measured with immediate and delayed 10-words recall tests. 
Associations of 10-words recall with COVID-19 hospitalization and mortality were 
assessed using logistic models adjusted for age, sex, race, body mass index, 
smoking, physical activity, household income, education level, and chronic 
conditions.
RESULTS: A total of 4,062 participants with COVID-19 infection from SHARE, 1349 
from HRS, and 278 from ELSA were included in the analysis. 610 (15.0%) in SHARE, 
142 (10.5%) in HRS, and 39 (14.0%) in ELSA were hospitalized, and 102 (2.5%) 
died of COVID-19 or related complications in SHARE. The adjusted odds ratios 
(aORs) for COVID-19 hospitalization were 1.15 (95% CI, 1.09-1.22) in SHARE, 1.07 
(95% CI, 0.94-1.21) in HRS, and 1.34 (95% CI, 1.02-1.77) in ELSA, per word 
decrease in immediate 10-words recall. For delayed 10-words recall, the 
corresponding aORs were 1.11 (95% CI, 1.06-1.17), 1.12 (95% CI, 1.01-1.24), and 
1.25 (95% CI, 1.01-1.55), respectively. The aORs for COVID-19 mortality were 
1.06 (95% CI, 0.93-1.20) and 1.14 (95% CI, 1.01-1.28) per word decrease in 
immediate and delayed 10-words recall in SHARE, respectively. Results were 
relatively robust to missing data of covariates, exclusion of cases based on 
symptoms alone, or exclusion of cases with Alzheimer's disease or dementia.
CONCLUSION: This study shows that low memory performance, as measured by 
10-words recall, is independently associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 
hospitalization and mortality in adults aged 50 years and older.

Mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles, as carriers for 
intercellular communication, are rich in bioactive substances such as proteins 
and nucleic acids, and show unique potential in the treatment of 
neurodegenerative diseases. Their vesicular structure, with a diameter of 30-150 
nm, can penetrate the blood-brain barrier and modulate the activity of microglia 
and astrocytes by delivering functional molecules. This process inhibits the 
release of pro-inflammatory factors and enhances the expression of 
anti-inflammatory mediators, thereby alleviating neuroinflammation in the 
pathological process of neurodegenerative diseases. As natural drug carriers, 
extracellular vesicles can improve the targeted delivery efficiency of 
therapeutic molecules. However, their specific anti-inflammatory mechanisms 
remain not fully understood and require further exploration. This article 
discusses the anti-inflammatory effects in the context of neurodegenerative 
diseases and provides a summary and outlook on the anti-inflammatory actions 
associated with extracellular vesicles from past research.

Neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, 
Alzheimer's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frequently present with 
vestibular dysfunction and balance disturbances, significantly impacting 
patients' quality of life and increasing the risk of falls. Vestibular 
impairments in these conditions can manifest as dizziness, unsteadiness, and 
difficulty maintaining postural control, further complicating the motor and 
cognitive deficits typical of these diseases. As a result, the assessment and 
management of balance dysfunction in neurodegenerative disorders have become 
crucial components of care. Posturography, an objective method for evaluating 
postural stability and balance control, has emerged as a valuable tool in the 
vestibular evaluation of patients with neurodegenerative conditions. By 
providing precise, quantitative measurements of balance deficits, posturography 
allows for a detailed analysis of postural control mechanisms that may be 
compromised due to vestibular involvement. This technique not only aids in 
diagnosing vestibular dysfunction but also plays a key role in developing 
targeted rehabilitation strategies. When integrated into vestibular 
rehabilitation (VR) programs, posturography can guide individualized therapy 
aimed at mitigating fall risk, improving functional mobility, and enhancing 
patients' overall quality of life. VR exercises, tailored to address specific 
balance deficits identified through posturographic analysis, can be particularly 
beneficial in promoting compensatory mechanisms and optimizing patients' 
functional abilities. This review highlights the significance of posturography 
as both a diagnostic and therapeutic tool in managing vestibular impairments 
associated with neurodegenerative diseases, offering the potential for improved 
outcomes through more personalized and effective rehabilitation interventions.

Autophagy is a crucial cellular process responsible for the degradation and 
recycling of damaged or unnecessary components, maintaining cellular homeostasis 
and protecting against stress. Dysregulation of autophagy has been implicated in 
a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, including multiple sclerosis, 
Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and 
Huntington's disease. Various types of autophagy exist, each with distinct 
mechanisms, such as macroautophagy, mitophagy, lipophagy, and chaperone-mediated 
autophagy. These processes are essential for the removal of toxic substrates 
like protein aggregates and dysfunctional mitochondria, which are vital for 
neuronal health. In neurodegenerative diseases, the impairment of these 
clearance mechanisms leads to the accumulation of harmful substances, which 
accelerate disease progression. Modulating autophagy has emerged as a promising 
therapeutic strategy, with ongoing studies investigating molecules that can 
either stimulate or regulate this process. However, despite its potential, 
significant challenges remain in translating preclinical findings into 
clinically effective treatments. In this review, we will explore the different 
types of autophagy, their roles in neurodegenerative diseases, and the 
therapeutic potential associated with modulating these processes.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) remains a significant global health challenge, 
characterized by progressive neurodegeneration and a decline in cognitive 
abilities such as memory and learning. Despite being the main cause of dementia 
worldwide, the precise mechanisms that underlie neuronal dysfunction and 
synaptic plasticity impairment in AD remain elusive. However, while genetic 
mutations, dietary factors, and immune dysregulation are implicated in AD 
pathogenesis, the current therapeutic approaches are largely centered around 
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs). Nevertheless, this cholinergic 
hypothesis of AD is no longer satisfactory in describing this disease and has 
demonstrated a limited efficacy. Hence, new treatment approaches should be 
developed, and that requires us to view AD from a new perspective. Herein, in 
our review, we present the latest studies that discussed possible AD pathologies 
and pharmacotherapies. Additionally, we highlight that the emerging treatments 
that precisely targets brain regions associated with enhancing neuroplasticity 
have delivered promising results and seem to be more effective than older 
treatments. Finally, by viewing AD as a complex interplay of various factors 
that ultimately cause synaptic dysfunction and cognitive decline, we can develop 
more effective therapeutic interventions and ultimately alleviate the 
significant burden of this debilitating disease for both patients and their 
families.

INTRODUCTION: We evaluated the impacts of brexpiprazole treatment on patient 
neuropsychiatric symptoms and caregiver distress in Japanese patients with 
agitation in Alzheimer's dementia (AAD).
METHODS: In a phase 2/3 multicenter, double-blind study, patients were 
randomized to receive brexpiprazole 1 or 2 mg/day, or placebo (3:4:4) for 10 
weeks. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) was used for evaluation. The areas 
of patient symptoms and caregiver distress were defined as NPI and NPI-Distress, 
respectively.
RESULTS: At Week 10, the differences of brexpiprazole 1 and 2 mg versus placebo 
for NPI total score were -1.2 (p = 0.5891) and -8.4 (p < 0.0001), and those for 
NPI-Distress total score were -1.1 (p = 0.2292) and -3.9 (p < 0.0001), 
respectively. In brexpiprazole 2 mg versus placebo, NPI and NPI-Distress 
agitation/aggression score showed ≥ 2 and ≥ 1 point improvement, respectively.
DISCUSSION: Brexpiprazole is suggested to improve patient symptoms and to reduce 
caregiver distress in the treatment of AAD in Japanese patients.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT03620981 HIGHLIGHTS: 
Brexpiprazole improved symptoms of patients with agitation in Alzheimer's 
dementia. The improvements included not only agitation, but also various 
behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia scores. The improvements of 
patient symptoms led to the reduction of caregiver distress. Our study suggests 
that brexpiprazole is beneficial for both patients and caregivers.

INTRODUCTION: African American (AA) individuals are underrepresented in 
biomarker studies for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Biomarkers that reflect the 
heterogeneity of AD and achieve the greatest accuracy across populations are 
sorely needed.
METHODS: Untargeted proteome measurements were obtained using the SomaScan 7k 
platform to identify novel plasma biomarkers for AD in AA participants with 
clinical diagnoses of AD dementia (n = 181) and cognitively unimpaired (CU, 
n = 142). Machine learning was used to identify a set of plasma proteins that 
yielded the best classification accuracy.
RESULTS: A set of 36 proteins achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.94 to 
classify AD dementia versus CU, a 16% improvement over age, sex, and 
apolipoprotein E (APOE). This finding was replicated in multiple plasma and 
brain datasets (AUCs 0.73-0.97). Our findings underscore the importance of 
matrisome and cerebrovascular dysfunction in AD pathophysiology.
DISCUSSION: This study demonstrates the potential of biomarker discovery through 
untargeted plasma proteomics and machine learning.
HIGHLIGHTS: Conducted large-scale plasma proteomics in Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
versus cognitively unimpaired controls. Machine learning biomarker discovery was 
replicated in an independent cohort. Novel set of proteins distinguishes AD 
versus controls with high accuracy (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.94). Achieved

INTRODUCTION: Network hyperexcitability (NH) is observed in patients with 
early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD), emerging decades before cognitive decline. 
A key molecular determinant of NH is voltage-gated Na+ channel 1.6 (Nav1.6), 
which mediates action potential firing in CA1 hippocampal neurons. Ameliorating 
NH through inhibition of the glycogen-synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β/Nav1.6 complex 
may provide immediate benefits to cognition and memory and slow AD progression.
METHODS: Hight-throughput virtual screening and multiple in vitro biological 
assays were utilized to identify compound 1063. Patch-clamp electrophysiology 
and electroencephalogram recordings were utilized to functionally assess 1063 in 
models of AD neuropathology.
RESULTS: Building on previous studies identifying GSK3β as a modulatory protein 
binding to the Nav1.6 C-terminal domain (CTD), we identified 1063, a 
brain-penetrant small molecule that inhibits GSK3β/Nav1.6 complex assembly and 
reduces NH in AD rodent models.
DISCUSSION: These results demonstrate the potential of the GSK3β/Nav1.6 complex 
as a therapeutic target for NH in early-stage AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: The glycogen synthase kinase 3-β (GSK3β)/Nav1.6 complex is a 
potential target for hyperexcitability in early Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Compound 1063 dose-dependently decreases GSK3β/Nav1.6 complex assembly. Compound 
1063 is functionally specific for Nav1.6 over other central nervous system (CNS) 
Nav isoforms. Ex vivo functional studies provide evidence for target engagement. 
1063 dose-dependently reduces epileptiform activity in AD rodent model.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common progressive neurodegenerative disease 
characterized by abnormal deposition of amyloid-β protein (Aβ) and the formation 
of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). Although there are drugs available for 
clinical treatment, they do not fundamentally cure AD, so early diagnosis and 
intervention for AD are essential. In recent years, near-infrared fluorescent 
(NIRF) probes have been widely used in diagnosing AD due to their advantages of 
high tissue penetration, low autofluorescence interference, and 
non-invasiveness. This paper reviewed the recent progress of NIRF probes in AD. 
We described the effects of NIRF probes on AD biomarkers, including Aβ protein, 
Tau tangles, mitochondrial viscosity, reactive oxygen species, copper ions, zinc 
ions, and so on. In detail, we also described the optical properties, in vitro 
detection, and in vivo imaging of NIRF probes based on different dyes and their 
derivatives, such as curcumin, Boron dipyrromethene, Quinoline, and 
Donor-Acceptor. Despite significant progress, NIRF probes remain challenging in 
imaging and treating AD in vivo. Their selectivity and sensitivity need to be 
improved due to the complex structure of brain tissue and interfering factors. 
In conclusion, studying NIRF probes provides us with new ideas. Through further 
optimization, these probes may be used for early diagnosis and treatment 
detection of AD to better cope with the challenges brought by AD.

BackgroundThe risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
patients undergoing anticoagulation (AC) remains unclear.ObjectiveThis 
nationwide cohort study assessed ICH risk in AC-treated AD patients.MethodsUsing 
Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database, we identified 1638 
AC-treated AD patients and established four matched cohorts: AD with AC, AD 
without AC, non-AD with AC, and non-AD without AC. We applied inverse 
probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) and competing risks regression (CRR) 
to adjust for confounders and mortality risk. Cox proportional hazards 
regression estimated ICH risk.ResultsThe ICH incidence per 100 person-years was 
2.21 in AD patients with AC, 1.03 without AC, 1.71 in non-AD with AC, and 0.28 
in non-AD without AC. After IPTW adjustment, compared to non-AD without AC, AD 
patients with AC had the highest ICH risk (aHR 1.94, 95% CI: 1.44-2.61), 
followed by non-AD with AC (aHR 1.84, 95% CI: 1.51-2.23) and AD without AC (aHR 
1.74, 95% CI: 1.42-2.11). ICH risk in AC-treated AD patients was comparable to 
non-AD with AC. Subgroup analysis showed higher ICH risk in females and those 
with hyperlipidemia, diabetes, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, or 
cancer.ConclusionsAD is associated with increased ICH risk, which is further 
elevated by AC use. These findings highlight the need for individualized 
risk-benefit evaluation, particularly in high-risk populations.

BackgroundPeople living with Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia are 
vulnerable to medicine-related problems. More research is needed to support 
achieving quality use of medicines in people living with dementia.ObjectiveTo 
determine the top 10 unanswered quality use of medicines questions for people 
living with dementia, as prioritized by Australians living with dementia, their 
carers, and healthcare professionals.MethodsThe James Lind Alliance Priority 
Setting Partnership method was used. This manuscript reports the second half of 
the priority setting process. Using a quantitative survey, consumers (people 
living with dementia, their carers and family and friends) and healthcare 
professionals selected up to ten research questions about quality use of 
medicines that they felt were most important. The research questions were 
informed by a previous national qualitative survey and evidence checking process 
to identify those that were unanswered. An online workshop was then conducted 
with consumers and healthcare professionals to prioritize the unanswered 
questions, resulting in a top 10 list.Results171 consumers and 67 healthcare 
professionals completed the survey and the workshop included 17 participants. 
The top 10 priorities related to shared decision making, education of healthcare 
professionals, communication between healthcare professionals, reducing the use 
of unnecessary and harmful medicines, managing medicines safely at home, 
medicine reviews, residential aged care facilities and managing pain, behavioral 
changes, depression and anxiety.ConclusionsTargeting research efforts towards 
these identified consumer and healthcare professional priorities will ensure 
research funds are being directed to the most urgent areas of need in practice.

BackgroundObesity increases the risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other 
dementias. Obesity causes structural brain injury, and it has been suggested 
that this may contribute to the development of AD pathology. Neurodegeneration 
in AD results from the aggregation of misfolded and dysfunctional tau and 
amyloid-β. However, it remains unknown whether adiposity-related brain injury 
acts through tau and amyloid deposition or as an independent cause of 
neurodegeneration.ObjectiveHere, we tested whether obesity, cerebrovascular 
disease, and obesity-related metabolic risk score were associated with 
structural brain and cognitive changes via the same mechanisms as AD or 
independent of them.MethodsWe used the UK Biobank sample of over 33,000 
individuals aged 64 years on average. We tested the influence of the 
microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) and apolipoprotein E (APOE) risk 
alleles involved in tau and amyloid-β synthesis, folding, and clearance, as well 
as AD polygenic risk score (PRS) to define genetic risk of AD. Specifically, we 
investigated whether these genetic risk factors moderated the relationship 
between obesity and brain structure and cognition.ResultsWe found that MAPT and 
APOE status and AD PRS did not moderate the relationship between obesity and 
brain atrophy. We also found limited evidence for the moderation of MAPT and 
APOE of the cerebrovascular disease-brain structure relationship as well as the 
metabolic risk score-brain structure relationship.ConclusionsWe conclude that 
the mechanisms linking obesity with brain atrophy are most likely independent of 
the ones governing AD-related protein deposition.

BACKGROUND: Transthyretin (TTR) is a highly conserved protein with crucial and 
broadly protective physiologic roles across organ systems and diseases. Evidence 
shows that TTR contributes to neuroprotection, cognition, glucose regulation, 
pregnancy, muscle development, and bone mineralization. In several disease 
states, including diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, Lewy body dementia, 
cerebrovascular disease, and osteoporosis, higher TTR levels may be protective. 
Numerous studies have shown that low levels of TTR are associated with increased 
mortality overall and in relation to cardiovascular disease and several 
malignancies.
PURPOSE: There is a growing portfolio of approved and investigational 
transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) treatments that differ in their mechanisms and 
effects on circulating TTR. When selecting an ATTR therapy, clinicians must 
decide whether to stabilize and preserve TTR and its functions or knockdown and 
drastically reduce TTR. This review summarizes the vital physiologic roles of 
TTR in health and disease. We consider the potential effects on normal biologic 
pathways that may occur while therapeutically suppressing TTR and discuss 
clinical decisions concerning ATTR therapies in the context of the summarized 
literature.
DISCUSSION: TTR is essential for a broad range of physiologic processes and may 
confer clinically protective effects in neurologic and other organ systems. 
While a link between low TTR and severe disease and mortality is well 
established, it remains unclear whether long-term TTR suppression via ATTR 
therapies increases risk of disease. Clinical decisions in ATTR, however, should 
reflect the current understanding of the roles of TTR and the patient's clinical 
history.
CONCLUSION: TTR serves vital physiologic roles across organ systems. Given its 
clinically protective properties, continued investigation into the potential 
long-term impact of TTR suppression via knockdown or gene editing therapies is 
prudent. ATTR treatment selection should reflect an awareness of the physiologic 
importance of TTR, as well as consideration of the potential long-term impact of 
chronic TTR suppression.

Neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's 
disease are hallmarked by neuronal loss with the pathogenic impetus of oxidative 
stress, neuroinflammation, and perturbed cell survival signaling. Alfalfa 
(Medicago sativa), a flavonoid-, saponin-, and phytoestrogen-rich bioactive 
legume, has been under the spotlight due to its presumed neuroprotective 
activity. This review discusses the function of Alfalfa in sustaining oxidative 
stress control, neuroinflammation reduction, and regulation of crucial molecular 
processes of neuronal survival and apoptosis. We detail how Alfalfa antioxidants 
inhibit reactive oxygen species (ROS) and amplify endogenous processes for 
preventing oxidative damage. We also discuss anti-inflammatory actions of the 
plant by inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines and pathways like NF-κB and MAPK. 
Furthermore, we present novel evidence for Alfalfa's role in neuronal survival 
pathways such as PI3K/Akt, Nrf2/ARE, and BDNF signaling. By combining data from 
in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies, this review tries to outline the 
therapeutic potential of Alfalfa in neurodegeneration and provide a basis for 
future studies on its possible application as a neuroprotective agent.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid beta 
(Aβ) plaques, leading to neuronal death. Notably, there are no therapeutically 
efficacious treatments for this disorder. This study investigates the 
neuroprotective mechanisms of curcumin. In vitro experiments demonstrated that 
curcumin significantly promoted the proliferation of neural stem cells (NSCs) 
derived from E16 mouse embryos. Additionally, in the APP/PS1 transgenic mouse 
model, curcumin improved cognitive function, as evidenced by a shorter escape 
latency and increased platform crossing frequency in the Morris water maze test 
and enhanced novel object recognition. Histological analysis showed that 
curcumin reduced Aβ accumulation in the hippocampal and cortical regions. 
Molecular studies revealed that curcumin upregulated the expression of BDNF and 
enhanced phosphorylation of CREB. Collectively, these findings indicate that 
curcumin exerts neuroprotective effects through multiple mechanisms, including 
promoting NSC proliferation, reducing Aβ accumulation, and the potential 
modulation of the BDNF-CREB signaling pathway.

This study explores the potential of adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) to 
deliver therapeutic genes directly into the memory circuit throughout the 
olfactory bulb (OB), a critical memory and sensory processing region. Using 
convection-enhanced delivery (CED) of AAV9 encoding green fluorescent protein 
(GFP), we mapped the extensive neural connectivity from the OB to key 
memory-related brain regions, including the entorhinal cortex (EC) and 
hippocampus. Our findings reveal significant transduction of neural pathways and 
underscore the potential of targeting the OB connectome for therapeutic 
interventions in progressive neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's 
disease or mild cognitive impairment. Targeting the OB connectome will pave the 
way for new therapeutic strategies to preserve neuronal function and slow the 
progression, offering a promising avenue beyond symptomatic relief to address 
the underlying mechanisms of the disease.

Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) predict an individual's genetic risk for complex 
diseases, yet their utility in elucidating disease biology remains limited. We 
introduce scPRS, a graph neural network-based framework that computes 
single-cell-resolved PRSs by integrating reference single-cell chromatin 
accessibility profiles. scPRS outperforms traditional PRS approaches in genetic 
risk prediction, as demonstrated across multiple diseases including type 2 
diabetes, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, Alzheimer disease and severe COVID-19. 
Beyond risk prediction, scPRS prioritizes disease-critical cells and, when 
combined with a layered multiomic analysis, links risk variants to gene 
regulation in a cell-type-specific manner. Applied to these diseases, scPRS 
fine-maps causal cell types and cell-type-specific variants and genes, 
demonstrating its ability to bridge genetic risk with cell-specific biology. 
scPRS provides a unified framework for genetic risk prediction and mechanistic 
dissection of complex diseases, laying a methodological foundation for 
single-cell genetics.

Impaired brain insulin signaling is a risk factor for the pathogenesis of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). FoxO1 and HMGA1 transcription factors are involved in 
the pathogenesis of both type 2 diabetes (T2D) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
This study aimed to assess the effect of vanadyl sulfate (VS) on impaired memory 
and hippocampal FoxO1 and HMGA1 RNA expression in sporadic AD (sAD) model in 
rats. Thirty-two male Wistar rats (250 ± 10 g) were divided into sham, AD, and 
VS 0.5 and 0.75 treated groups. The animals were subjected to two bilateral 
intracerebroventricular (icv) injections of either citrate buffer or 
streptozotocin (STZ) at 72-hour intervals. The VS-treated groups were treated 
with either 0.5 or 0.75 mg/ml oral VS for 3 weeks. The target quadrant entry 
latency, path length, and time and distance traveled in the target quadrants 
were assessed with the Morris water maze (MWM). Hippocampal tissues were 
analyzed for FoxO1 and HMGA1 RNA expressions. Group differences and group‒time 
interactions were analyzed via mixed two-way repeated-measures ANOVA. VS 
treatment in icv STZ rats restored impaired spatial memory. Hippocampal FOXO1 
and HMGA1 RNA expressions were significantly lower in VS-treated and sham groups 
compared to AD control. VS can restore impaired spatial memory in sAD rats, 
possibly via the repression of FoxO1 and HMGA1 RNA expression in hippocampus.

The collapse of Gaza's health system has rendered traditional models of health 
planning and humanitarian coordination functionally obsolete. With fewer than 
half of Gaza's hospitals partially operational and over 90% of health 
infrastructure damaged or destroyed, the territory is no longer capable of 
delivering essential services such as dialysis, obstetric care, or oncology 
treatment. This letter argues that a permanent, internationally managed 
cross-border health corridor-anchored via the Rafah crossing-offers a feasible 
and urgent solution to provide structured, rights-based care amid systemic 
collapse. Drawing on precedents from Syria, the Democratic Republic of Congo, 
and global humanitarian law, we outline the legal, operational, and political 
frameworks necessary to establish such a corridor. The corridor model is 
presented as not only a response to Gaza's immediate crisis but also a 
replicable framework for other protracted conflict zones where national health 
systems have irreversibly failed.

Therapeutic successes in mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) largely fail 
to translate into clinical trials, with experimental drugs rarely validated in 
human models before being administered to humans. To address this, we developed 
an accessible method to culture commercially available primary human neurons and 
astrocytes, along with an amyloid-beta 1–42 (Aβ)-based in vitro AD model. This 
system enables to reliably culture primary neurons to mature stages of 
development, essential to model the adult brain and neurodegenerative diseases 
such as AD. The absence of a blood–brain barrier (BBB) in this model permits 
evaluation of drug mechanisms of action independently of BBB permeability, 
thereby informing the feasibility of developing fully BBB-penetrant therapeutics 
for CNS interventions based on validated senolytic pathways. Using this 
platform, we evaluated two senolytic regimens previously shown to be effective 
in AD mouse models: Navitoclax (NAV), which targets the Bcl-2 family of 
anti-apoptotic proteins, and the dasatinib–quercetin (DQ) cocktail, which 
inhibits tyrosine kinases and AKT signaling, among other pathways. We also 
assess the natural killer cell line NK92 to model emerging immune-mediated 
senescent cell ablation therapies. In synaptically mature cultures, we show that 
NK92 cells preferentially—but not exclusively—targeted Aβ-treated neurons and 
astrocytes with senescent-like phenotypes. DQ demonstrated a safe profile for 
human neurons, but Navitoclax exhibited non-selective neurotoxicity. These 
findings highlight potential risks associated with developing BBB-permeable 
therapies based on the mechanisms of NAV and NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Our 
work underscores the critical need for human-relevant models in the AD 
drug-development pipeline to improve safety and clinical translatability.

BACKGROUND: Alterations to brain macrostructure, assessed via T1-weighted 
magnetic resonance imaging are observed in preclinical models of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), reflecting susceptibility, prodromal stages of AD or correlates of 
early AD pathophysiology. While changes in cingulate and medial temporal lobe 
structures may be functionally implicated in cognitive decline, little is known 
about the viability of brain-based biomarkers that support autonomic functions 
implicated in preclinical AD risk such as the brainstem.
METHODS: In a series of multiple linear regressions, we assess the volume of the 
brainstem in two asymptomatic at-AD-risk samples, assessed via the presence of 
either mild cognitive impairment (MCI, N = 148), or extremely high polygenic 
risk (N = 13) with matched demographics (mean age = 67 [range 58-76], in both 
cases). We further determine the strength of the association, compared to 150 
other structural MRI features.
RESULTS: We observed brainstem volume reductions (MCI: b = -0.29, P = 0.018; 
Genetic risk: b = -1.29, P = 0.002) in both samples. The magnitude of each 
preclinical AD marker (MCI / AD-polygenic risk)- brainstem association was 
empirically larger (Z > 2.3, P < 0.05, in both cases) than 150 frequently 
segmented MRI features. We further replicate the negative AD-polygenic risk 
score- brainstem association in UK Biobank (N = 31968; b = -0.002, P = 0.03), 
with weaker evidence that the association was larger than all other MRI features 
(Z = 1.622; P = 0.052).
CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest that AD risk, assessed via the presence 
of MCI or extremely high AD-polygenic risk score is linked to reduced brainstem 
volume before most typically observed morphological brain alterations. This 
conforms with evidence implicating the brainstem as one of the earliest sites of 
morphological neurodegeneration and provides a plausible biological mechanism 
linking prodromal autonomic symptoms to AD risk in later life. These 
observations warrant future investigation into the molecular correlates of 
AD-linked brainstem dysfunction, assessment as a candidate biomarker, and the 
exploration of brainstem mediated treatment strategies in AD prevention.

We present the case of a 74-year-old woman with behavioral variant 
frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) linked to a pathogenic TANK-binding kinase 1 
(TBK1) mutation (c.1349_1352del; p.Ile450Lysfs*15). During clinical workup, the 
patient underwent comprehensive biomarker analysis, including tau positron 
emission tomography (PET) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) seed amplification assay 
(SAA) for α-synuclein (αSyn). While CSF biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease were 
normal, the αSyn SAA was clearly positive, indicating misfolded αSyn aggregates. 
Tau PET revealed increased [18F]PI-2620 uptake in the basal ganglia. Genetic 
testing confirmed autosomal dominant TBK1-associated FTD. The patient's 
condition deteriorated over the following year, with rapid cognitive decline and 
the emergence of cortical signs. Post-mortem neuropathological analysis 
confirmed multiple proteinopathies: FTLD-TDP43 (subtype A), Lewy body disease 
(limbic type, Braak stage 5), argyrophilic grain disease (AGD), aging-related 
tau astrogliopathy (ARTAG), and primary age-related tauopathy (PART). This is 
the first reported TBK1-FTD case with in vivo detection of αSyn pathology via 
SAA and in vivo monitoring of tau pathology. The case expands the clinical and 
neuropathological spectrum of TBK1-associated FTD. Our findings support a 
broader interpretation of TBK1-associated neurodegeneration and highlight the 
importance of multimodal diagnostic approaches that integrate molecular, 
genetic, imaging, and neuropathological tools. This case also underscores the 
utility of αSyn SAA and tau PET in detecting co-pathologies that may otherwise 
remain clinically silent and illustrates the need for further studies exploring 
the molecular cross-talk between TBK1, tau, and αSyn pathologies.

INTRODUCTION: Using the ATN framework, we evaluated the potential of plasma 
biomarkers to identify abnormal brain amyloid-beta (Aβ) positron emission 
tomography (PET), tau-PET and neurodegeneration in a socioeconomically 
disadvantaged population-based cohort.
METHODS: Community-dwelling dementia-free (n = 113, including 102 (91%) 
cognitively normal) participants underwent ATN neuroimaging and plasma biomarker 
assessments.
RESULTS: Plasma Aβ42/Aβ40, p-tau181, and p-tau217 showed significant 
associations with Aβ-PET status, (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] of 1.74*10-24, 1.47, 
and 3.43*103, respectively (p-values < 0.05), with p-tau217 demonstrating the 
highest classification accuracy for Aβ-PET status (AUC = 0.94). Plasma p-tau181 
and p-tau217 showed significant associations with tau-PET status (AOR: 1.50 and 
22.24, respectively (p-values < 0.05), with comparable classification accuracies 
for tau-PET status (AUC = 0.74 and 0.70, respectively). Only plasma NfL showed 
significant association with neurodegeneration based on cortical thickness 
(AOR = 1.09, p-value < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the potential of plasma p-tau217 as a 
biomarker for brain Aβ and tau pathophysiology, p-tau181 for tau abnormalities, 
and NfL for neurodegeneration in the community.

Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) and their exosomes (MSC-Exos) have great 
potential for tissue repair and regenerative medicine, which can improve the 
symptoms and prognosis of aging-related diseases and potentially slow the aging 
process through multiple pathways. This comprehensive review summarizes the 
characterization of MSCs and MSC-Exos from various tissue sources and their 
applications in treating diseases associated with aging, such as premature 
ovarian failure (POF), Alzheimer's disease (AD), atherosclerosis (AS), and 
osteoporosis (OP). MSCs exert therapeutic effects through multiple mechanisms, 
including differentiation into various cell types, secretion of bioactive 
molecules, and immune response regulation. MSC-Exos, which contain a diverse 
array of proteins, miRNAs, and other biomolecules, can deliver MSC-derived 
bioinformatics to target cells and demonstrate comparable therapeutic benefits 
to MSCs. This review highlights the signaling pathways and molecular mechanisms 
underlying the therapeutic efficacy of MSCs and MSC-Exos in age-related 
diseases, and further discusses the importance of MSC and MSC-Exo tissue source 
selection for specific disease applications and the potential of combination 
therapies and preconditioning strategies to enhance their therapeutic outcomes. 
Despite promising preclinical and clinical results, challenges such as uneven 
distribution, in vivo environmental maladaptation, apoptosis, and immune 
responses need to be addressed before widespread clinical application. Future 
research requires multidisciplinary collaboration to further elucidate the 
mechanisms of action and develop optimized therapeutic strategies for the 
prevention and treatment of age-related pathologies using MSCs and MSC-Exos.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid plaques, tau 
tangles, and neuronal loss. Progranulin (PGRN) is a secreted immune regulator, 
lysosomal chaperone, and neuronal survival factor. Genetic polymorphisms that 
reduce PGRN levels are associated with an increased risk for AD and other 
neurodegenerative disorders. The receptor sortilin binds and targets PGRN for 
lysosomal degradation, resulting in a reduction of extracellular PGRN. AL101 
(GSK4527226) is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the sortilin receptor and is 
being developed as a potential PGRN-elevating therapy for AD.
METHODS: Cell-based in vitro studies examined the interaction of AL101 with 
sortilin and its effect on PGRN levels. In vivo studies evaluated the safety, 
pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of AL101 in rats and nonhuman 
primates. A phase 1 study in healthy volunteers assessed PK, safety, 
tolerability, and PD biomarkers after intravenous or subcutaneous dosing of 
AL101.
RESULTS: Cell-based assays showed that AL101 increased PGRN levels by decreasing 
cell surface sortilin levels and partially blocking the sortilin-PGRN 
interaction. Preclinical studies in rats and monkeys demonstrated that AL101 
decreased cell surface sortilin levels on white blood cells and increased PGRN 
levels by up to 2-fold in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and up to 4-fold in blood. 
In the phase 1 study in healthy volunteers, both single and multiple doses of 
AL101 led to significant increases in plasma and CSF PGRN levels, providing 
additional support for its potential as a PGRN-elevating therapy.
LIMITATIONS: The first-in-human dose-finding study was aimed at investigating 
the safety and tolerability of AL101 and was not sufficiently powered to detect 
changes in exploratory outcomes, such as neurodegeneration biomarkers. Clinical 
studies are needed to evaluate AL101 in AD patients.
CONCLUSIONS: AL101 was shown to bind sortilin and decrease cell surface sortilin 
levels, leading to consistent elevations of PGRN across in vitro, preclinical, 
and human studies. These results support continued development of AL101 and its 
investigation as a potential treatment for AD and other neurodegenerative 
conditions where PGRN could play a role.

BACKGROUND: It is largely unknown how alcohol use affects the risk of 
Alzheimer`s disease (AD). Therefore, studies on the influence of alcohol use on 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for the earliest preclinical phase of AD 
are needed.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional cohort study. The sample (n = 301) was 
derived from the 2014-2016 examinations of the Gothenburg H70 Birth Cohort 
Studies. The study cohort consisted of 301 70-year-old women and men, where of 
246 cognitively unimpaired and 55 with mild cognitive deficits. Information on 
alcohol consumption (g/week and type of alcohol) was collected and CSF 
amyloid-β1-42 (Aβ42), total-tau (T-tau), tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 
(P-tau181), neurofilament light protein (NfL) and neurogranin (Ng) were 
measured. We tested the association between the CSF biomarkers and alcohol 
consumption types using correlation and linear regression, adjusting for 
possible confounders when necessary according to the performed sensitivity 
analysis.
RESULTS: There were no correlations between weekly alcohol consumption and any 
of the CSF markers studied in the total sample of cognitively unimpaired 
participants (n = 246). After adjustments for multiplicity with FDR, there was 
an association between white wine and Ng in women with CDR = 0 (β:0.254, CI: ( 
0.069: 0.439), p = 0.0076, FDR = 0.0455). Interaction analysis between female 
sex and red wine intake was a significant predictor of high Ng levels (β:0.410, 
CI: ( 0.099: 0.721), p = 0.0100, FDR = 0.0500). There were no correlations 
between consumption of specific types of alcohol (spirits, white wine, red wine, 
fortified wine, and beer) and any of the biomarkers studied in the total sample 
of cognitively unimpaired participants.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that higher alcohol use in older cognitively 
unimpaired women correlates with a biomarker of synaptic dysfunction in AD, 
which is an important observation in a time when alcohol use is increasing among 
women.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major neurodegenerative disorder that causes 
severe cognitive decline and poses a significant burden on global health 
systems. Despite extensive research, effective treatments to stop 
neurodegeneration or promote neuronal regeneration in AD remain elusive. 
Psychoactive substances as modulators of neurophysiological functions, have 
received increased attention in research. The main psychoactive agents, such as 
central nervous system depressants and stimulants, cannabinoids, psychedelics, 
opioids and ketamine, are being explored for their abilities to enhance learning 
and cognitive performance and potential neurorestorative functions. In this 
paper, we review the molecular mechanisms and therapeutic potential of 
psychoactive substances in AD, in the aim to guide future research directions.

Recent studies report reduced dementia risk following shingles vaccination, 
suggesting that varicella-zoster virus (VZV) latency contributes to neuroimmune 
vulnerability. We propose that subclinical VZV reactivation acts as a renewable 
peripheral immune stressor, amplifying microglial priming in aging brains. 
Shingles vaccination may suppress this viral reservoir, reducing cumulative 
inflammatory tone. In this opinion article we contrast this mechanism with 
trained immunity and highlight how pathogen-specific and systemic effects may 
converge. Finally, we discuss the role of innate phagocytosis and resolution, 
suggesting that impaired clearance, rather than activation alone, sustains 
neuroinflammatory risk. Vaccination may thus modulate innate responsiveness and 
preserve neuroimmune balance in later life.

Neuroinflammation is characterized by activation of the immune response in the 
central nervous system (CNS). In Alzheimer's disease (AD), this involves 
stimulation of glial cells, including microglia and astrocytes, that surround 
senile plaques and affected neurons. The complement system is a crucial 
component of the innate immune system, responsible for rapidly eliminating 
pathogens and dead or dying cells, while also influencing the magnitude and 
duration of the inflammatory immune response. Moreover, the complement system 
plays both neuroprotective and neurodestructive roles. In AD, dysregulation of 
the complement system contributes to excessive microglial phagocytosis of 
synapses, with such synaptic loss representing the major correlate to cognitive 
decline in the course of the disease. However, the detailed mechanism for 
complement activation in AD had remained poorly understood until the discovery 
that complement factors were aberrantly S-nitrosylated, representing a 
redox-mediated posttranslational modification that controls the complement 
cascade. Nitrosative stress, caused by excessive generation of reactive nitrogen 
species (RNS), including nitric oxide (NO)-related species, had been recognized 
as a critical factor in the pathogenesis and progression of AD. Recent 
publications highlighted in this review support the notion that the NO-related 
species support aberrant S-nitrosylation of complement proteins, leading to 
pathological activation of the complement system, thus contributing to synaptic 
loss in AD.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY RELEVANCE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a widely occurred 
neurodegenerative disease and Notch1/Hes1 pathway based neural stem cell (NSC) 
proliferation and neurogenesis are very crucial to restore cognitive ability. 
Cornus officinalis Sieb. et Zucc, a famous traditional Chinese herb remedy was 
widely used to tonify kidney and essence to ameliorate AD symptoms. Morroniside 
(MOR), a prominent bioactive component of Cornus officinalis Sieb. et Zucc has 
demonstrated promising neuroprotective properties, while its function of 
neurogenesis to improve cognitive ability largely remains unclear.
AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to reveal the role of MOR promoting 
neurogenesis and improving cognitive function via Notch1/Hes1 pathway thus to 
discover more neuropharmacological merit of MOR for AD treatment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: An AD model was induced in C57BL/6 mice by bilateral 
intracerebroventricular injection of streptozotocin (ICV-STZ). The mice were 
divided into control, model, low-dose, high-dose, DAPT + MOR, and donepezil 
groups. Cognitive functions were assessed using open field test, novel object 
recognition test, and Morris water maze (MWM). Histopathological changes were 
evaluated by Nissl and hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. Immunofluorescence 
double-labeling was performed to detect the expression of neurogenesis 
biomarkers in dentate gyrus. qRT-PCR and Western blotting were employed to 
measure the mRNA levels and Notch1, Hes1 expression. Molecular docking and 
dynamics simulations were performed to assess the binding affinity and stability 
between MOR and Notch1/Hes1 proteins. Proteomic analysis combined with Gene 
Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were integrated 
to verify the effects of MOR on including Notch1/Hes1 pathway for neurogenesis.
RESULTS: MOR (20 and 40 mg/kg) significantly improved cognitive function of 
ICV-STZ mice from the behavioral tests. Histological analysis showed that MOR 
enhanced neuronal survival in the hippocampus, improved cellular arrangement and 
structure, and reduced oxidative stress. Immunofluorescence results indicated 
that MOR promoted NSC proliferation and neurogenesis, as evidenced by the 
elevated number of BrdU/Nestin and DCX/Ki67 double-positive cells. 
Mechanistically, MOR upregulated the mRNA and protein expression of Notch1 and 
Hes1 in the hippocampus and increased the expression of downstream Cyclin D1 and 
CDK4. Molecular docking and dynamics simulations further supported stable 
binding of MOR to Notch1 and Hes1. Proteomics combined with GO and KEGG 
enrichment further confirmed MOR (40 mg/kg, ∗P < 0.05) could significantly 
regulated multiple signaling pathways including Notch1 to ameliorate AD 
symptoms.
CONCLUSION: This work demonstrated MOR could promote neural stem cell 
proliferation and neurogenesis by activating Notch1/Hes1 pathway, thereby 
enhancing learning and memory abilities in ICV-STZ mice. Such findings will 
further promote the clinical application of MOR for AD treatment.

Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) is a viable drug target to alleviate the symptoms 
of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We recently developed and biologically evaluated 
racemic N-benzylpiperidine-based naphthalene-2-sulfonamide 2, a nanomolar BChE 
inhibitor with procognitive effects. To optimize it, we performed a chiral 
switch. Using semi-preparative chiral HPLC, we isolated the pure enantiomers 
(R)-(-)-2 and (S)-(+)-2 and confirmed that (R)-(-)-2 is the eutomer and 
(S)-(+)-2 is the distomer with respect to human (h)BChE inhibition. Notably, 
(R)-(-)-2 is a less potent inhibitor of human acetylcholinesterase (hAChE) than 
both racemate 2 and (S)-(+)-2, which is advantageous, since AChE inhibition is 
associated with undesirable peripheral parasympathomimetic adverse effects. The 
crystal structures of hBChE in complexes with each enantiomer revealed distinct 
binding poses. The crystal structure of hBChE in complex with (R)-(-)-2 
confirmed our previous hypothesis that only the (R)-(-)-2 is bound in the active 
site of hBChE when the racemate is crystallized. The synthesis of (R)-2 
hydrochloride has a higher overall yield (73 %) than the synthesis of racemate 2 
hydrochloride (64 %) and is safer as it avoids the use of LiAlH4. (R)-(-)-2 has 
in vivo efficacy in mice with scopolamine-induced AD-like symptoms, and 
(R)-(-)-2 is less toxic in mice (LD50 = 169 mg/kg) than racemate 2 
(LD50 = 112 mg/kg). These results support the chiral switch from racemate 2 to 
(R)-(-)-2 as a safer and more selective lead compound in the anti-AD drug 
development pipeline.

Myelin, a lipid-rich sheath that insulates axons, is essential for efficient 
neural signal transmission and the modulation of neural circuits. Its formation, 
maintenance, and regeneration are tightly regulated processes that shape 
neurodevelopment, cognition, and emotional stability. Recent evidence positions 
the gut microbiota as a critical modulator of myelination, orchestrating 
metabolic signaling, immune homeostasis, and neuroinflammatory responses. 
Notably, the synchronized development and remodeling of gut microbiota and 
myelin across key life stages suggest a dynamic and bidirectional interplay 
essential for sustaining neurological health. Disruptions in this axis are 
increasingly recognized as contributing factors in dysmyelination-related 
disorders, including autism spectrum disorder, Alzheimer's disease, and multiple 
sclerosis. Harnessing microbiota-targeted interventions-such as fecal microbiota 
transplantation, dietary modulation, and probiotic therapies-holds promise for 
restoring myelin integrity and mitigating disease pathology. This review 
provides a comprehensive synthesis of the gut microbiota-myelin interface, 
delineating mechanistic insights and translational opportunities for 
microbiome-based therapeutic strategies in neuroprotection.

BACKGROUND: During post-stroke locomotor rehabilitation, repeated fast walking 
practice improves walking capacity and gait biomechanics. Faster training speed 
appears to be a key mediator of these effects, but it remains untested whether 
training at maximal speeds could lead to even more pronounced biomechanical 
adaptations.
OBJECTIVES: This secondary analysis investigated longitudinal changes in 
spatiotemporal gait parameters after maximal versus moderate-speed locomotor 
training in chronic stroke, comparing short-burst high-intensity interval 
training (HIIT) versus moderate-intensity aerobic training (MAT). Compared to 
MAT, short-burst HIIT was hypothesized to exhibit greater improvement in 
non-paretic step length.
METHODS: The HIT-Stroke Trial randomized 55 participants with chronic stroke to 
short-burst HIIT (N = 27) or MAT (N = 28) for 45-minutes of walking practice, 
3-times weekly, over 12-weeks. This secondary analysis compared mean 
spatiotemporal gait changes between groups, averaging 4-week, 8-week, and 
12-week estimates minus baseline. The primary measure of interest was 
non-paretic step length.
RESULTS: Non-paretic step length increased significantly more with HIIT (+4.4 cm 
[95 % CI, 1.9, 6.9]) compared to MAT (+0.1 [-2.5, 2.7]; HIIT vs. MAT p = .01). 
Both groups demonstrated significant increases in cadence and bilateral single 
support time, and decreases in the coefficient of variation (CV) for stride 
velocity, time, and length. Changes in step length symmetry were only apparent 
when assessing individuals with baseline asymmetry.
CONCLUSIONS: Greater increases in non-paretic step length with short-burst HIIT 
suggest maximal speed training may yield greater increases in paretic 
propulsion, a marker of walking efficiency. Both MAT and HIIT appear to reduce 
spatiotemporal variability, possibly indicating improved gait stability.

BACKGROUND: Caregiver-assisted medication management plays a critical role in 
promoting medication adherence and quality of life for people living with 
Alzheimer disease or related dementias (ADRD). The current landscape of digital 
and nondigital interventions to support medication management does not meet 
caregivers' needs, contexts, and levels of technological proficiency. 
Intervention development can be facilitated using personas or data-driven 
archetypes that represent end users' traits relevant to solution design.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand the strategies and unmet needs of ADRD 
caregivers who manage medications and use this understanding to create personas 
that can inform customized caregiver interventions.
METHODS: Participants were self-identified primary caregivers of people with 
ADRD living with or near the care recipient. Virtual contextual inquiry was 
completed in three stages: (1) enrollment interview, (2) virtual observation 
over a 1-week period, and (3) postobservation interview. Codebook thematic 
analysis of interview transcripts was used to identify dimensions of caregivers' 
approaches to medication management. A reflexive, team-based affinity 
diagramming approach was used to identify attributes within these dimensions and 
group attributes into personas.
RESULTS: Participants (N=25) were aged 62.32 (SD 11.86) years on average, and 17 
(68%) of them were female. Caregivers varied across 6 dimensions relevant to 
medication management: strategies for medication acquisition, medication storage 
and organization, medication administration, monitoring the care recipient for 
symptoms, communication with care network regarding medication, and acquiring 
information about medication. Three personas were created to represent the 
observed strategies, unmet needs, and levels of technology use related to 
medication management: Checklist Cheryl, in Control; Social Sam, Keeps it 
Simple; and Responsive Rhonda, Stays Relaxed.
CONCLUSIONS: Caregivers in this study demonstrated a range of characteristics 
and values that informed their approach to medication management. They used a 
combination of technology-based strategies and strategies situated in their 
physical environments to manage medications. The personas created can be used to 
inform interventions, such as digital tools, that address caregivers' unmet 
needs.

This study aimed to assess the therapeutic efficacy of syringaldehyde (SYD) in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to investigate its potential underlying molecular 
mechanisms. The potential of SYD for AD treatment was first explored through a 
network pharmacology approach. APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) transgenic mice were 
treated with SYD via intraperitoneal injection for 9 weeks, and cognitive and 
behavioral functions were evaluated using the Y-maze, Morris water maze, and 
novel object recognition tests. Histopathological analysis was conducted to 
assess neuronal changes and amyloid plaque deposition in the hippocampus using 
immunofluorescence, hematoxylin and eosin staining, Nissl staining, and Congo 
red staining. RNA sequencing and transcription factor prediction analyses were 
utilized to identify the potential molecular mechanisms underlying SYD's 
therapeutic effects. In addition, in vitro experiments were performed on HT22 
hippocampal neuronal cells, including ROS assay, TUNEL assay, and quantitative 
reverse transcription PCR, to validate the mechanisms suggested by the in vivo 
results. The results demonstrated that SYD treatment significantly reduced 
amyloid plaque deposition in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice, promoted neuronal 
repair, and improved cognitive performance. Further analysis indicated that 
these therapeutic effects were mediated by SYD's ability to enhance resistance 
to oxidative stress, alleviate neuronal damage, and inhibit the 
NF-κB/IL-1β/NLRP3 inflammatory pathway, thereby counteracting neuroinflammation 
induced by neuronal activation. In conclusion, this study provides strong 
evidence for the potential of SYD to ameliorate cognitive impairment and reduce 
amyloid plaque deposition in AD, highlighting its promising role as a 
therapeutic agent in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

In this study, we integrated HSQC-based DeepSAT with UPLC-MS/MS to guide the 
isolation of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid derivatives (PUFAs) from marine 
resources. Through this approach, four new (1-4) and nine known (5-13) PUFA 
analogues were obtained from large-scale cultures of the marine dinoflagellate 
Prorocentrum lima, with lipidomic profiling identifying FA18:5 (5), FA18:4 (7), 
FA22:6 (8), and FA22:6 methyl ester (11) as major constituents of the algal oil 
extract. Structural elucidation was achieved through integrated spectroscopic 
analyses of IR, 1D and 2D NMR, and HR-ESI-MS data. Given the pivotal role of 
microglia in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, we further evaluated the 
neuroprotective potential of these PUFAs by assessing their regulatory effects 
on critical microglial functions in human microglia clone 3 (HMC3) cells, 
including chemotactic migration and amyloid-β42 (Aβ42) phagocytic clearance. 
Pharmacological evaluation demonstrated that FA20:5 butanediol ester (1), FA18:5 
(5), FA18:4 (7), FA22:6 (8), and (Z)-10-nonadecenoic acid (13) significantly 
enhanced HMC3 migration in a wound-healing assay. Notably, FA18:4 (7) also 
significantly promoted Aβ42 phagocytosis by HMC3 microglia while maintaining 
cellular viability and avoiding pro-inflammatory activation at 20 μM. 
Collectively, our study suggests that FA18:4 (7) modulates microglial function 
in vitro, indicating its potential to exert neuroprotective effects.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by β-amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary 
tangles, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress-pathological features that pose 
significant challenges for the development of therapeutic interventions. Given 
these challenges, this review comprehensively evaluates the neuroprotective 
mechanisms of bioactive compounds derived from red algae, including 
polysaccharides and phycobiliproteins, which are considered a promising source 
of natural therapeutics for AD. Red algal constituents exhibit neuroprotective 
activities through multiple mechanisms. Sulfated polysaccharides (e.g., 
carrageenan, porphyran) suppress NF-κB-mediated neuroinflammation, modulate 
mitochondrial function, and enhance brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) 
expression. Phycobiliproteins (phycoerythrin, phycocyanin) and peptides derived 
from their degradation scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activate 
antioxidant pathways (e.g., Nrf2/HO-1), thus mitigating oxidative damage. 
Carotenoids (lutein, zeaxanthin) improve cognitive function through the 
inhibition of acetylcholinesterase and pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, 
IL-1β), while phenolic compounds (bromophenols, diphlorethol) provide protection 
by targeting multiple pathways involved in dopaminergic system modulation and 
Nrf2 pathway activation. Emerging extraction technologies-including microwave- 
and enzyme-assisted methods-have been shown to optimize the yield and maintain 
the bioactivity of these compounds. However, the precise identification of 
molecular targets and the standardization of extraction techniques remain 
critical research priorities. Overall, red algae-derived compounds hold 
significant potential for multi-mechanism AD interventions, providing novel 
insights for the development of therapeutic strategies with low toxicity.

Alzheimer's Disease-Thrombosis Comorbidity: A Growing Body of Evidence from 
Patients and Animal Models.

Medical School, University of Hull, Hull HU6 7RX, UK.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: A growing body of evidence is amassing in the literature 
suggesting a correlation between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and thrombotic 
vascular complications, which led to the suggestive hypothesis that thrombosis 
may contribute to AD onset and progression by damaging the neurovasculature and 
reducing the cerebral blood flow. In turn, low cerebral blood flow is likely to 
contribute to neurodegeneration by reducing nutrient and oxygen supply and 
impairing toxic metabolite removal from the brain tissue.
METHODS: We searched the literature for studies in animal models of AD or 
patients diagnosed with the disease that reported circulating markers of 
platelet hyperactivity or hypercoagulation, or histological evidence of brain 
vascular thrombosis.
RESULTS: Platelet hyperactivity and hypercoagulability have been described in 
multiple animal models of AD, and histological evidence of neurovascular 
thrombosis has also been reported. Similarly, clinical studies on patients with 
AD showed circulating markers of platelet hyperactivity and hypercoagulation, or 
histological evidence of neurovascular thrombosis collected from post-mortem 
brain tissue samples.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, a convincing picture is emerging that suggests a 
strong correlation between systemic or neurovascular thrombosis and AD. 
Nonetheless, a mechanistic role for haemostasis dysregulation and neurovascular 
damage in the onset or the progression of AD remains to be proven. Future 
research should focus on this important question in order to clarify the 
mechanisms underlying AD and identify a treatment for this disease.

Neuroprotective Effects of Metformin Through the Modulation of Neuroinflammation 
and Oxidative Stress.

Epidemiological studies have shown that individuals with type 2 diabetes have an 
increased risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases. These diseases and type 
2 diabetes share several risk factors. Meanwhile, the antidiabetic drug 
metformin offers promising neuroprotective effects by reducing oxidative stress 
and neuroinflammation, two significant factors in neurodegenerative diseases. 
This review examines the mechanisms by which metformin mitigates neuronal 
damage. Metformin reduces neuroinflammation by inhibiting microglial activation 
and suppressing proinflammatory cytokines. It also triggers the nuclear factor 
erythroid-2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) pathway to combat oxidative stress, an 
essential regulator of antioxidant defenses. These outcomes support the possible 
neuroprotective roles of metformin in type 2 diabetes-related cognitive decline 
and conditions like Alzheimer's disease. Metformin's therapeutic potential is 
further supported by its capacity to strengthen the blood-brain barrier's 
(BBB's) integrity and increase autophagic flux. Metformin also offers several 
neuroprotective effects by targeting multiple pathological pathways. Moreover, 
metformin is being studied for its potential benefits beyond glycemic control, 
particularly in the areas of cognition, Alzheimer's disease, aging, and stroke 
management. Evidence from both clinical and preclinical studies indicates a 
complex and multifaceted impact, with benefits varying among populations and 
depending on underlying disease conditions, making it an appealing candidate for 
managing several neurodegenerative diseases.

Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is essential for effective 
treatment; however current diagnostic methods are often complex, costly, and 
unsuitable for point-of-care testing. Graphene-based biosensors offer an 
alternative due to their affordability, versatility, and high conductivity. 
However, graphene's conductivity can be compromised when its carbon lattice is 
oxidized to introduce functional groups for biomolecule immobilization. This 
study addresses this challenge by developing an electrochemical immunosensor 
using carboxyl-modified commercial graphene foam (COOH-GF) electrodes. The 
conductivity of graphene is preserved by enabling efficient COOH modification 
through π-π non-covalent interactions, while antibody immobilization is 
optimized via EDC-NHS carbodiimide chemistry. The immunosensor detects tau-441, 
an AD biomarker, using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), achieving a 
detection range of 1 fM-1 nM, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.14 fM both in 
PBS and human serum. It demonstrates high selectivity against other AD-related 
proteins, including tau-217, tau-181, amyloid beta (Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42), and 1% 
BSA. These findings underscore its potential as a highly sensitive, 
cost-effective tool for early AD diagnosis.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: As the term limbic-predominant age-related transactive 
response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) encephalopathy (LATE) was coined in 
2019, more than 200 articles addressing the subject were published. This review 
aims to provide an updated synthesis of knowledge regarding LATE-NC as a cause 
of age-related neurodegeneration and cognitive decline while addressing the 
challenges posed by overlapping neuropathologies in aging populations.
RECENT FINDINGS: LATE-NC is marked by TDP-43 deposition in limbic structures, 
such as the amygdala and hippocampus, and is often associated with cognitive 
decline resembling Alzheimer's disease, though with a slower progression in 
isolated cases. The frequent coexistence of LATE-NC with other neuropathologies, 
particularly Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic changes (ADNC) and Lewy body 
dementia (LBD), exacerbates dementia severity and complicates diagnosis and 
treatment. Recent efforts have established clinical criteria for in-vivo 
diagnosis, including neuroimaging markers like hippocampal atrophy and limbic 
hypometabolism. Genetic studies have identified key risk genes, including GRN, 
TMEM106B, SORL1, and APOE, while biomarker development in cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) and blood remains in its early stages.
SUMMARY: The review highlights the importance of multidisciplinary research and 
clinical approaches in addressing the complexities of neurodegenerative diseases 
involving TDP-43 proteinopathy, enhancing diagnostic accuracy, and developing 
effective treatments tailored to individual patient profiles.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Late-life depression (LLD) is a prevalent condition and 
frequently complicated by higher rates of medical comorbidities and cognitive 
decline. We review the current evidence implicating inflammation in the 
pathophysiology of LLD and the potential of related molecules and pathways to be 
used as biomarkers or pharmacological targets.
RECENT FINDINGS: A growing body of evidence implicates chronic low-grade 
inflammation in the pathophysiology and progression of LLD. Inflammatory 
cytokines, stress-related neuroendocrine pathways, oxidative stress, 
mitochondrial dysfunction, and blood-brain barrier permeability all synergize 
with aging to worsen depressive symptoms. Moreover, LLD presents marked 
biological heterogeneity, with inflammation-related subtypes exhibiting worse 
clinical outcomes. Several biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets, including 
cytokines, gut microbiota, and mitochondrial DNA, are identified.
SUMMARY: Inflammation is a key modifiable contributor to LLD and may serve as 
both a biomarker and therapeutic target. Although current clinical trials of 
anti-inflammatory treatments show promise, findings remain inconsistent. Future 
research should focus on identifying inflammatory subtypes of LLD and validating 
personalized, mechanism-based interventions to improve treatment outcomes in 
aging populations.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurological disorder characterized by a spectrum 
of symptoms such as memory loss and cognitive decline. AD is a multifaceted 
disease, and designing multipotent ligands is an effective strategy for AD 
treatment. In this regard, the pharmacophore moiety of clioquinol (CQ, metal 
chelator) was employed to design the multifunctional phenol-triazole derivatives 
4(a-p). In particular, 4k with an o-I group on the phenyl ring displayed a 
noteworthy higher inhibition (inhibition efficiency 4k = 90.5%, IC50 = 6.51 ± 
0.01 μM) against Aβ42 aggregation as compared to 38.1% noted for CQ. 
Furthermore, 4k significantly disassembled the preformed Aβ42 fibrils (Aβf, 
92.5%), chelated Cu2+ ions, and inhibited Cu2+-mediated Aβ42 aggregation. 
Compound 4k ceases the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as it acts as 
an antioxidant due to the presence of a phenolic hydroxyl group. Compound 4k has 
a sufficient safety-efficacy profile and alleviates the cytotoxicity by Aβ42 
aggregates in PC-12 cells. For studying the modulation in the fibrillary 
architecture, hydrodynamic size, and structural transition of Aβ42 in the 
presence of 4k, we resorted to transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic 
light scattering (DLS), and circular dichroism (CD), respectively. The molecular 
dynamics (MD) simulations depicted a notable reduction in the conformational 
transformations in the Aβ42 monomer (Aβm) and Aβf on the incorporation of 4k. 
Compound 4k modulates Aβ42 fibrillation by maintaining a helix conformation and 
simultaneously reduces the sampling of β-sheet structures in Aβm, consistent 
with the CD results. The molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area 
(MM-PBSA) analysis depicted a favorable binding of 4k to Aβm (-42.12 ± 7.14 
kcal/mol) and Aβf (-74.42 ± 4.98 kcal/mol) with a significant contribution of 
van der Waals interactions to the binding free energy. The 4k-induced 
deformation in Aβf chains noted in the conformational snapshots depicts its 
destabilization potential against Aβf. Finally, our results uncovered the 
potential of phenol-triazole derivatives as a promiscuous ligand for targeting 
various pathological conditions in AD. The key insights into the prevention of 
conformational transitions in Aβm and destabilization of Aβf by 4k illuminated 
by experimental and computational studies are central to unraveling the 
molecular understanding of amyloid aggregation as well as designing future 
therapeutic candidates against multifaceted AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, 
predominantly affecting the aging population. Early detection through biomarkers 
is essential for early intervention. Recent sub-classification of AD through 
extensive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomic analyses revealed distinct 
characteristics of each subtype, necessitating tailored therapeutic strategies. 
While CSF proteomics has identified potential biomarkers, the need for 
non-invasive and cost-effective substitutions highlights the importance of 
blood-based biomarkers (BBMs). This review is a comprehensive review that 
categorizes potential BBMs based on neuronal hyperplasticity (subtype 1), 
underlining their role in refining subtype classification and enabling precision 
medicine. Early AD is often marked by cortical and hippocampal hyperactivity, 
followed by hypoactivity during later stages of neurodegeneration. While the 
exact mechanisms remain unclear, factors like Ca2+, glutamate, amyloid beta, 
tau, genetic factors, and impaired glial function play a role. Advancements in 
blood-based diagnostics would improve detection, individual treatment 
strategies, and evaluation of therapeutic response, eventually reducing the 
burden of AD on health-care systems. HIGHLIGHTS: Alzheimer's disease (AD; 
subtype 1) exhibits neuronal hyperplasticity, mild cortical atrophy, and 
moderate microglial activation. The neuronal hyperplasticity subtype of AD is 
characterized by an upregulation of synaptic and plasticity-related proteins, 
distinguishing it from other AD subtypes. Identifying biomarkers specific to 
neuronal hyperplasticity would enable real-time monitoring of therapeutic 
responses, allowing for individualized therapy as opposed to a 
"one-size-fits-all" strategy. The treatments based on neuronal hyperactivity 
reduction, restoration of synaptic plasticity, and anti-inflammation/metabolic 
dysfunction would be useful in this AD subtype. Blood-based biomarkers offer a 
cost-effective and accessible alternative to cerebrospinal fluid and 
neuroimaging methods.

BACKGROUND: Informal caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and 
related dementias (ADRD) face significant physical and psychological demands. 
Chronic caregiving is linked to mental health challenges, poor cardiovascular 
health, and accelerated cellular aging, reflected in telomere shortening, with 
Black caregivers disproportionately affected.
METHODS: This secondary analysis used data from Black caregivers from a 
randomized control trial. Telomere length was measured by qPCR. Questionnaires 
assessed perceived stress, sleep, depression, anxiety, and coping strategies. 
Salivary cortisol, inflammatory, and cardiometabolic biomarkers were measured. 
Pearson correlations and linear regression analyses controlled for demographic 
and health factors.
RESULTS: Shorter telomeres were linked to stress, poor sleep, inflammation, and 
cardiometabolic markers. Perceived stress was associated with negative coping 
strategies, anxiety, and depressive symptoms.
DISCUSSION: More research is needed to uncover mechanisms linking caregiver 
stress to cardiovascular health, guiding tailored interventions to reduce stress 
and improve cardiovascular health in Black caregivers of persons with ADRD.
HIGHLIGHTS: Chronic stress in Black caregivers: Chronic caregiving stress was 
linked to accelerated cellular aging, inflammation, and poor cardiometabolic 
health. Perceived stress associations: Higher perceived stress was associated 
with negative coping strategies, poor sleep quality, anxiety, depression, and 
reduced telomere length. Telomere length and cardiometabolic risk: Shorter 
telomere length was significantly associated with elevated cardiometabolic risk 
markers, including insulin resistance and increased blood pressure. Need for 
interventions: Findings emphasize the importance of culturally tailored 
interventions aimed at reducing stress and mitigating health risks in Black 
caregivers of persons living with Alzheimer's disease.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by cognitive decline and behavioral changes. Emerging evidence 
suggests that the gut microbiota influences central nervous system function. 
Probiotic interventions may offer a promising therapeutic approach by modulating 
the gut microbiota composition and potentially improving cognitive outcomes in 
AD patients. This meta-analysis aimed to assess the effects of probiotic 
supplementation on cognitive function in AD patients by analyzing randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs). Following PRISMA 2020 guidelines and registered with 
PROSPERO (CRD42024508725), we conducted a comprehensive search across PubMed, 
Embase, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov through April 9th, 2024. Only 
double-blind RCTs comparing probiotic supplementation to placebo in patients 
aged 65 or older with clinically diagnosed AD were included. Primary outcomes 
were cognitive function scores from validated tools like MMSE and TYM. Our 
stringent inclusion criteria identified four double-blind RCTs with 251 
participants aged 65 or older with clinically diagnosed AD. Statistical analysis 
using a random-effects model revealed significant cognitive improvement in 
probiotic-treated groups compared to placebo controls (Standardized Mean 
Difference [SMD] = 0.67; 95% CI [0.14, 1.19]; P < 0.05), though substantial 
heterogeneity was observed (I2 = 79.16%). Subgroup analyses indicated that 
probiotic formulation type, dosage, and baseline AD severity may influence 
cognitive outcomes. While these findings suggest probiotics may offer cognitive 
benefits for AD patients, the high heterogeneity and limited study number 
necessitate additional well-designed clinical trials to confirm these promising 
results and establish optimal treatment protocols for clinical implementation.

INTRODUCTION: A granular understanding of the mechanisms linking tau pathology 
to cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease is crucial. We investigate mediating 
effects of medial temporal lobe (MTL) and neocortical neurodegeneration on 
tau-induced domain-specific cognitive impairment in amyloid-beta (Aβ) positive 
cognitively normal and impaired adults.
METHODS: We assessed magnetic resonance imaging-derived MTL and neocortical 
volume/thickness and 18F-Flortaucipir positron emission tomography in 319 
Aβ-positive individuals. Cognitive functions across six domains were isolated by 
adjusting for other cognitive measures.
RESULTS: MTL tau correlated with memory subdomains, neocortical tau with 
executive function, and both with semantic fluency. Specific structural measures 
partially mediated these tau-cognition associations: Brodmann area 35 mediated 
tau-immediate and tau-delayed recall, posterior hippocampus tau-recognition, and 
inferior temporal cortex tau-semantic fluency associations.
DISCUSSION: Our findings provide a nuanced understanding of region-specific 
macrostructural atrophy as one pathway of tau-induced cognitive changes, 
aligning with known tau spread patterns. Additionally, isolating cognitive 
functions is a promising approach for future research.
HIGHLIGHTS: Medial temporal lobe tau was related to memory domains; neocortical 
tau to executive function. Both tau positron emission tomography measures were 
associated with semantic fluency. Specific regional atrophy partially mediated 
tau-induced cognitive changes. Other mechanistic links between tau and cognitive 
subdomains require investigation. Isolated cognitive domains should be explored 
as future avenues of research.

Down syndrome (DS) is a leading genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). Although prevention and treatment of AD are well documented for those 
without DS, less is known about individuals with DS. This review evaluates the 
efficacy of AD and dementia interventions in people with DS. It includes 26 
articles with 1417 participants ages 18-69 in the qualitative synthesis and 17 
articles with 1118 participants in the meta-analysis. Four types of 
interventions demonstrated small-to-moderate effects: pharmacological (n = 19), 
exercise (n = 5), environmental (n = 1), and cognitive training (n = 1). 
Significant treatment effects were observed across interventions (t(66) = 4.67, 
p < 0.0001, d = 0.29, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.16-0.40); however, high 
heterogeneity (I2 = 93.8% CI = 92.8-94.7) was noted, which was not explained by 
intervention type or outcome. The meta-analysis indicates that interventions 
enhance AD-related cognitive and behavioral outcomes, emphasizing the need for 
further research to address heterogeneity. This review was registered with 
PROSPERO: CRD42024567026. HIGHLIGHTS: This study is the first to comprehensively 
review both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) in individuals with Down syndrome (DS), extending 
previous reviews by including a meta-analysis and examining key mediating 
variables. Donepezil, the most studied pharmacological treatment, showed 
significant cognitive and behavioral improvements in individuals with DS, 
especially with longer treatment periods. However, further trials are needed to 
explore its efficacy in combination with non-pharmacological interventions. All 
seven non-pharmacological studies reported significant improvement, suggesting 
that even small doses of exercise and cognitive training can be effective and 
feasible for individuals with DS. Online formats may enhance scalability and 
reduce barriers to participation. Significant heterogeneity in cognitive 
assessments across studies highlights the need for standardized, sensitive 
assessments to enable meaningful comparisons of intervention effects. Additional 
studies are required to determine the long-term efficacy of pharmacological 
interventions like Donepezil and to assess the sustained impact of 
non-pharmacological interventions on key AD-related cognitive domains such as 
memory, language, and executive function.

BACKGROUND: Cytokines and immune markers are critical in mediating inflammation 
associated with neurodegenerative disease. This review analyzes the role of 
inflammatory cytokines and immune markers in neurodegeneration among African 
populations.
METHODS: Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses guidelines, we conducted a systematic review of studies examining 
cytokine levels in neurodegenerative diseases, focusing on populations of 
African ancestry.
RESULTS: Cytokines like interleukin (IL)-6, soluble tumor necrosis factor 
receptor 1, plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and IL-8. IL-6 emerged as 
a key pro-inflammatory marker linked to neurodegenerative diseases and cognitive 
decline, showing stronger correlations in African ancestry populations compared 
to Caucasians. Genetic findings revealed triggering receptor expressed on 
myeloid cells 2 variants and Fc fragment of IgG receptor IIb rs1050501 genotypes 
as influential in Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related inflammation, alongside a 
unique correlation between immunoglobulin G index inflammatory markers and AD in 
African ancestry populations.
DISCUSSION: The findings emphasize the crucial role of cytokines in the 
pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases. Understanding their variations 
among African populations can inform targeted therapeutic strategies and improve 
patient outcomes.
HIGHLIGHTS: Interleukin (IL)-6 was identified as a key pro-inflammatory marker, 
consistently linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease, and 
dementia, underscoring its significant role in neurodegenerative disease 
progression. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels were associated with 
improved cognitive performance, particularly in African American participants. 
Observational studies identified sex-based differences in IL-10 levels, 
particularly among older African American women. The review highlights notable 
ethnic differences in cytokines like IL-8, IL-1β, and soluble tumor necrosis 
factor receptors, emphasizing their roles in neurodegeneration and cognitive 
decline in people of African descent. Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid 
cells 2 variants, immunoglobulin GM allotypes, and Fc fragment of IgG receptor 
IIb rs1050501 genotypes were found to influence AD-related inflammation and 
progression in African ancestry populations.

INTRODUCTION: Neuroinflammation, a key player in Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
pathogenesis, may be differentially involved in young-onset (YOAD) compared to 
late-onset (LOAD) AD.
METHODS: Using proximity extension assay technology, we examined 737 
inflammatory markers in the CSF of 26 healthy controls (63.9 ± 8.7; 12♀), 57 
patients with YOAD (60.8 ± 4.9 y/o; 40♀), and 33 with LOAD (76.6 ± 4.5 y/o; 
18♀). We also assessed biomarkers of AD pathology (Aβ42, p-tau181, t-tau) and 
neurodegeneration (neurofilament light-chain [NfL]).
RESULTS: Compared to controls, SCRN1 and MMP10 were increased in LOAD and YOAD, 
but 16 markers showed YOAD-specific increases. Forty-six markers were 
significantly associated with NfL. P-tau181 and t-tau mediated the association 
between inflammatory markers and NfL in YOAD. In LOAD we could not identify a 
direct or indirect relationship between neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.
DISCUSSION: Using a proteomics approach, we observed an exacerbation of 
neuroinflammatory changes and a differential contribution of neuroinflammation 
to AD pathology and neurodegeneration in YOAD compared to LOAD.
HIGHLIGHTS: Olink's Proximity Extension Assay was used to compare the 
inflammatory profile of 26 healthy controls and 90 Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
patients. AD patients were further stratified into young-onset (YOAD, n = 57) 
and late-onset (LOAD, n = 33) AD. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of MMP10 and 
SCRN1 were increased in both YOAD and LOAD, but 16 proteins were only increased 
in YOAD. Tau mediated the association between inflammatory markers and 
neurodegeneration in YOAD. Neuroinflammation may be differentially involved in 
the pathogenesis of YOAD compared to LOAD.

OBJECTIVE: We summarized the existing clinical evidence of repetitive 
transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for Parkinson's Disease (PD) and 
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and conducted a series of dose-response meta-analyses 
to determine the curve relationship between the number of pulses and the effect 
size of the treatment.
METHODS: Existing evidence was retrieved from five databases, and relevant 
outcome data on rTMS treatment for motor and non-motor symptoms of PD and AD 
were collected. Data were analyzed using R software to assess effect size using 
standardized mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). 
Heterogeneity testing was performed to assess differences in efficacy among the 
evidence, and restricted cubic spline (RCS) was used to fit the dose-response 
curves.
RESULTS: A total of 51 publications were included, involving 1,938 subjects. We 
found that for PD patients, the total number of rTMS pulses showed significant 
bell-shaped curves in TUG (χ2 = 6.87, df = 2, p = 0.03), FOGQ (χ2 = 15.17, df = 
2, p = 0.001), BDI (χ2 = 14.33, df = 2, p = 0.001), HAMD (χ2 = 12.63, df = 2, p 
= 0.001), and HAMA (χ2 = 6.06, df = 2, p = 0.04). For AD patients, the total 
number of rTMS pulses demonstrated significant bell-shaped curves for MMSE (χ2 = 
8.76, df = 2, p = 0.01) and MoCA (χ2 = 6.79, df = 2, p = 0.03).
CONCLUSION: Our dose-response meta-analysis results show that rTMS demonstrates 
significant efficacy in certain motor and non-motor symptoms of PD and AD. The 
number of rTMS pulses presents a typical bell-shaped curve for these symptoms, 
indicating that more number of rTMS pulses is not always better; beyond a 
certain threshold, increasing the number of rTMS pulses correlates negatively 
with therapeutic efficacy.

INTRODUCTION: Age-related cognitive decline occurs, in part, due to diminishing 
white matter integrity. Higher cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is associated 
with better cognitive performance, but the neurobiological mechanisms underlying 
this association remain uncertain. Previous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
studies have suggested that CRF-related changes in white matter microstructure 
might prevent or slow age-related cognitive decline, but have been limited by 
small sample sizes and methodological limitations. Specifically, most prior 
studies used tensor-based diffusion-weighted MRI metrics, which are insensitive 
to complex white matter architectures, including crossing fibers.
METHODS: Here, we leveraged a novel analysis framework capable of resolving 
individual fiber populations at the within-voxel level-fixel-based analysis 
(FBA)-to analyze three metrics of white matter organization from 
diffusion-weighted MRI scans: fiber density (FD), fiber cross-section (FC), and 
their combined measure (FDC). Using a cross-sectional sample of 636 cognitively 
unimpaired older adults aged 65 to 80 years (mean age = 69.8 years; 71% female), 
we hypothesized that FBA metrics would be associated with CRF and that this 
variation in FBA metrics would mediate associations between CRF and cognitive 
performance.
RESULTS: In whole-brain analyses, higher CRF was associated with greater FD, FC, 
and FDC. Furthermore, these FBA-derived metrics statistically mediated the 
relationship between CRF and cognitive performance in the domains of 
visuospatial abilities, processing speed, working memory, and executive 
function/attentional control, but not episodic memory.
DISCUSSION: These findings highlight the potential for CRF in the preservation 
of multiple aspects of cognition as a function of white matter micro- and 
macro-structural properties. Our results provide novel insights into the 
neurobiological mechanisms of fitness-related cognitive resilience.
HIGHLIGHTS: Higher cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is linked to better white 
matter integrity in older adults.Fixel-based analysis reveals CRF associations 
with fiber density and cross-section.White matter properties mediate CRF effects 
on cognition, excluding episodic memory.Findings suggest CRF supports cognitive 
resilience via white matter organization.

With the global population aging, the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases 
(NDs), such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease 
and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, has been progressively increasing. However, 
effective therapeutic strategies and clinical drugs for these disorders remain 
scarce. Curcumin, a natural polyphenolic compound primarily derived from the 
herbaceous plant Curcuma longa L., has been proposed as a promising candidate 
for ND treatment based on the excellent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and 
neuroprotective properties. Its pharmacological activities encompass scavenging 
reactive oxygen species, mitigating toxic protein aggregation and cytotoxicity, 
repairing mitochondrial dysfunction, and inhibiting excessive neuronal 
apoptosis. Compared with synthetic drugs, curcumin demonstrates a more favorable 
safety profile with fewer side effects. Nevertheless, its clinical application 
is substantially hindered by poor bioavailability, which stems from low aqueous 
solubility, inefficient intestinal absorption, and rapid metabolism and systemic 
elimination. Conventional administration methods often fail to achieve effective 
concentrations in vivo. Further clinical trials are also required to validate 
the therapeutic efficacy and potential adverse effects in human subjects. This 
article systematically reviews the pathogenesis of NDs and the knowledge on 
curcumin including pharmacological effects, neuroprotective mechanisms, 
functions across specific NDs and advanced strategies to enhance the 
bioavailability, with the aim of promoting the development and clinical 
translation of curcumin-based therapeutics for NDs.

This case report explores the therapeutic potential of lymphovenous bypass (LVB) 
surgery performed at the neck in neurodegenerative diseases, specifically 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. The subject is a 58-year-old woman who was 
previously healthy but began experiencing unexplained memory decline and 
frequent disorientation in the past 7 years, leading to an AD diagnosis. Despite 
ongoing pharmaceutical therapy, her symptoms progressed to severe dementia 
accompanied by behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). Her 
Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) 
scores were both 0/30, and 18 F-AV-45 PET/CT revealed abnormal brain amyloid 
load. For salvage therapy, she underwent LVBs on her neck bilaterally. 
Postoperatively, she got better MMSE and MoCA scores with dramatic improvement 
in communication and activity. 18 F-AV-45 PET/CT scans 4 months after surgery 
indicated a reduction in abnormal brain amyloid deposits. This case report 
highlights the potential effectiveness of LVB surgery in reducing brain amyloid 
load and attenuating cognitive impairment and BPSD. Further research with animal 
experiments and clinical trials is necessary to confirm these findings.

BACKGROUND: With the emergence of disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), there is an urgent need for scalable, accurate, and well-validated 
blood test alternatives to positron emission topography (PET) and lumbar 
punctures for identifying amyloid pathology to facilitate identification of 
candidates for therapy. Plasma p-Tau 217 has emerged as a plasma-based biomarker 
with sufficient sensitivity and specificity to both rule out and rule in amyloid 
pathology with high confidence, potentially serving as a readily scalable 
non-invasive test to aid AD diagnosis. In this report, we describe robust 
analytical and clinical validation of a lab developed test for plasma p-Tau 217 
suitable for clinical diagnostic use.
METHODS: A high sensitivity digital immunoassay using single molecule array 
(Simoa) technology was developed for plasma p-Tau 217 utilizing a 2-cutoff 
approach. The assay was analytically validated with industry standard protocols 
and clinically validated across 873 symptomatic individuals from two independent 
clinical cohorts using PET or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers as 
comparators.
RESULTS: The assay exhibited acceptable analytical characteristics with an 
analytical sensitivity enabling measurement of plasma p-Tau 217 in all clinical 
samples. Excluding results between the two cutoffs, clinical sensitivity, 
specificity, and agreement with comparator methods (accuracy) were >90%, with 
30.9% of the samples falling in the intermediate zone between the two cutoffs.
DISCUSSION: The performance characteristics of the Simoa p-Tau 217 assay align 
with current accuracy recommendations for blood-based biomarker test performance 
for diagnostic use, making the test suitable for clinical use under the Clinical 
Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA) as a diagnostic plasma test to aid in 
Alzheimer's diagnosis.

Perioperative neurocognitive disorder is a major concern in aged individuals, 
and currently, treatment options are limited. Chronic intermittent propofol 
(CIP) has been shown to have neuroprotective effects in aged mice and in a mouse 
model of Alzheimer's disease. Here, we investigated whether CIP could reverse 
surgery-induced cognitive deficits and propose a mechanism of action. Male and 
female mice (21-24 months old) underwent exploratory laparotomy under isoflurane 
anesthesia. Animals were administered either CIP (75 mg/kg i.p.) or vehicle 
every fifth day throughout the experiment. Cognitive function was assessed using 
a battery of behavioral tests: the Y-maze test (spatial working memory), the 
novel object recognition test (recognition memory), the Morris water maze 
(spatial learning and memory), and trace and contextual fear conditioning 
(nondeclarative associative memory). Expression of α5-GABAA receptors, markers 
of apoptosis, and a microglial activation marker were assessed in the 
hippocampus using western blotting. The amount of α5-GABAA receptor subunits in 
cell-surface membranes was determined by biotinylation followed by western 
blotting. CIP induced a sustained redistribution of α5-GABAA receptors to the 
cell-surface membranes. Laparotomy led to an increased expression of the 
microglial activation marker Iba-1 and of proapoptotic markers, and impaired 
cognitive functions. CIP prevented these molecular and cognitive changes. 
Perioperative CIP redistributes α5-GABAA receptors to cell-surface membranes and 
thus prevents or reverses surgery-induced increases in markers of microglial 
activation, apoptosis, and cognitive dysfunction. Increasing the number or 
activity of α5-GABAA receptors on cell-surface membranes may be an effective 
therapeutic strategy to reduce postoperative morbidity in elderly patients.

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family of membrane proteins 
in eukaryotes, with nearly 800 genes coding for these proteins. They are 
involved in many physiological processes, such as light perception, taste and 
smell, neurotransmitter, metabolism, endocrine and exocrine, cell growth and 
migration. Importantly, GPCRs and their ligands are the targets of approximately 
one third of all marketed drugs. GPCRs are traditionally known for their role in 
transmitting signals from the extracellular environment to the cell's interior 
via the plasma membrane. However, emerging evidence suggests that GPCRs are also 
localized on mitochondria, where they play critical roles in modulating 
mitochondrial functions. These mitochondrial GPCRs (mGPCRs) can influence 
processes such as mitochondrial respiration, apoptosis, and reactive oxygen 
species (ROS) production. By interacting with mitochondrial signaling pathways, 
mGPCRs contribute to the regulation of energy metabolism and cell survival. 
Their presence on mitochondria adds a new layer of complexity to the 
understanding of cellular signaling, highlighting the organelle's role as not 
just an energy powerhouse but also a crucial hub for signal transduction. This 
expanding understanding of mGPCR function on mitochondria opens new avenues for 
research, particularly in the context of diseases where mitochondrial 
dysfunction plays a key role. Abnormalities in the phase conductance pathway of 
GPCRs located on mitochondria are closely associated with the development of 
systemic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity and 
Alzheimer's disease. In this review, we examined the various types of GPCRs 
identified on mitochondrial membranes and analyzed the complex relationships 
between mGPCRs and the pathogenesis of various diseases. We aim to provide a 
clearer understanding of the emerging significance of mGPCRs in health and 
disease, and to underscore their potential as therapeutic targets in the 
treatment of these conditions.

Neuroinflammation, characterised by an overactive immune system in the brain and 
spinal cord, has now been tied to several neurodegenerative diseases. Here, 
immune cells invade into the brain, activating astrocytes and microglia. 
Neuroinflammation is a common symptom of many neurodegenerative illnesses, 
including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis (ALS). This inflammatory reaction occurs within the central 
nervous system (CNS). Neurological dysfunction results from the inflammatory 
response, which arises in reaction to any kind of brain injury. Regulating 
neuroinflammation can be useful for controlling brain disorders associated with 
neuroinflammation. Several targeted drug delivery systems attempt to treat 
neuroinflammation caused by neurodegenerative illnesses or brain tumours by 
targeting the microglia and other immune cells in the central nervous system. 
Therefore, biodegradable and biocompatible NPs (nanoparticles) could be 
developed as a treatment for neurodegenerative diseases caused by 
neuroinflammation or as a less invasive means of transporting other drugs across 
the blood-brain barrier. Numerous applications of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) in 
the treatment of neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 
Parkinson's disease (PD), are studied in this article. To prevent 
neuroinflammation and microglia over-activation, some NPs have recently been 
found to be effective anti-inflammatory medication carriers that cross the 
blood-brain barrier.

AIMS: Albiflorin, a key compound from Paeonia lactiflora, has shown therapeutic 
potential in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders (NPDs and NDDs), 
especially depression and Alzheimer's disease (AD). This review aimed to 
summarize its pharmacological effects, mechanisms, pharmacokinetics, and 
therapeutic prospects.
DISCUSSION: Albiflorin exhibits multi-target actions, including modulation of 
monoamine neurotransmitters, inhibition of neuroinflammation, and enhancement of 
neuroplasticity. In AD, it reduces Aβ accumulation, improves mitochondrial 
function, and activates MAPK/ERK and Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathways. In 
depression, it restores phospholipid and tryptophan metabolism, regulates HPA 
axis function, and increases BDNF expression. Albiflorin crosses the blood-brain 
barrier (BBB) and may act indirectly via the gut-brain axis through its 
metabolite benzoic acid. Though brain concentrations are low, its 
pharmacological effects remain significant. Albiflorin also shows potential 
benefits in conditions like cerebral ischemia and hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. 
Toxicological data indicate low systemic toxicity and good safety margins in 
vivo and in vitro.
CONCLUSIONS: Albiflorin demonstrates promising therapeutic potential for NPDs 
and NDDs via multi-pathway regulation. However, further studies are needed to 
optimize brain delivery, understand gut microbiota interactions, and confirm 
efficacy through clinical trials. The advancement of formulation strategies and 
pharmacokinetic research will be considered key to achieving clinical 
translation.

We retrospectively reviewed 20 consecutive patients with Alzheimer's disease who 
switched from lecanemab to donanemab. No new amyloid-related imaging 
abnormalities (ARIA) or significant adverse events were observed during the 
first five donanemab infusions. Prior exposure to lecanemab may reduce ARIA 
risk. Cognitive function remained stable. These preliminary observations suggest 
that switching between anti-amyloid therapies may be safe in the short term, 
though larger prospective studies are warranted.

Chronic neuroinflammation, driven by M1-polarized microglia, is a core 
pathological mechanism of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Elevated expression levels 
of miR-199a-3p and pro-inflammatory cytokines were detected in the hippocampi of 
AD transgenic mice and in LPS-stimulated BV2 microglial cells. We hypothesized 
that miR-199a-3p exacerbates neuroinflammation by promoting M1 microglial 
polarization in AD progression. M1 （AD） 。 AD LPS BV2 miR-199a-3p 。 miR-199a-3p 
AD M1 。 OBJECTIVE: To explore the role of miR-199a-3p in AD-associated 
neuroinflammation. miR-199a-3p AD 。 METHODS: AD transgenic (APPswe/PSEN1dE9) 
mice and LPS-treated BV2 cells were used to assess miR-199a-3p effects in vivo 
and in vitro. Inflammatory cytokines and markers for microglial cell typing were 
detected. Transcriptome sequencing was performed on miR-199a-3p-modulated BV2 
cells, and the sequencing data were cross-analyzed with public databases to 
predict miR-199a-3p-mediated pathways.AD （APPswe/PSEN1dE9） LPS BV2 miR-199a-3p 
。。 miR-199a-3p BV2 ，， miR-199a-3p 。 RESULTS: Intracerebroventricular 
administration of miR-199a-3p agomir exacerbated amyloid deposition and impaired 
cognitive function in AD mice, and promoted microglial polarization toward the 
M1 phenotype. Conversely, treatment with miR-199a-3p antagomir attenuated AD 
pathology and suppressed M1 polarization. In LPS treated BV2 cells, miR-199a-3p 
mimics promoted M1 polarization, while inhibitors reversed this effect. 
Transcriptome analysis revealed that miR-199a-3p downregulated WDR76, 
subsequently suppressing cell cycle-associated pathways, IL-17 signaling, and 
FOXO pathways, resulting in an increase in the proportion of M1 type microglia.

Brief rationale: dementia and osteoporosis share risk factors and are rising in 
aging populations.
MAIN RESULTS: osteoporosis significantly increases the risk of all-cause 
dementia, Alzheimer's disease dementia, and vascular dementia in Korean older 
women. Significance of the paper: early detection and treatment of osteoporosis 
may reduce dementia risk.
PURPOSE: Dementia and osteoporosis share common risk factors and are increasing 
in prevalence in the aging population. This study aimed to investigate the 
impact of osteoporosis on dementia and its subtypes in women using data from a 
population-based, health-screening cohort, with a follow-up period of more than 
10 years.
METHODS: This retrospective study included 66-year-old Korean women who 
participated in the "National Screening Program for Transitional Ages" from 2010 
to 2011. Participants were categorized based on spine bone mineral density 
T-scores into three groups: normal (T-score ≥ - 1.0 standard deviation [SD]; 
18.7%), osteopenia (- 2.5 SD < T-score < - 1.0 SD; 42.5%), and osteoporosis 
(T-score ≤ - 2.5 SD; 38.8%). Incident dementia cases were evaluated until 2021 
using national healthcare claims databases. Fine-Gray subdistribution hazard 
models were used to assess the risks of all-cause dementia including Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) dementia and vascular dementia (VaD), accounting for death as a 
competing risk.
RESULTS: The study included 131,872 dementia-free women aged 66 years. Over an 
average follow-up of 10.4 ± 1.8 years, 9399 individuals developed all-cause 
dementia (7.1%). Osteoporosis was associated with increased risks for all-cause 
dementia (adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio [asHR] 1.14; 95% confidence 
interval [CI] 1.08-1.21; p < 0.001), AD dementia (asHR 1.14; 95% CI 1.08-1.22; 
p < 0.001), and VaD (asHR 1.42; 95% CI 1.08-1.87; p = 0.013), compared to 
normal.
CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight an association between osteoporosis and 
increased risks of developing all-cause dementia, AD dementia, and VaD. Further 
research is needed to explore the effects of early identification and treatment 
of osteoporosis in preventing dementia.

Acquisition and consolidation of recognition memory involves dopaminergic 
activity, which is determined to be dysregulated in Alzheimer disease (AD). 
Aromatic turmerone (Ar-tur), one of the major bioactive components of Curcuma 
longa, has been identified to protect dopaminergic neurons from various 
pathological insults. We have computationally investigated the drug-like nature 
and the therapeutic potential of Ar-tur in treating AD and have compared its 
targets with FDA-approved AD drugs. Cheminformatics, pharmacokinetics, toxicity, 
and system pharmacology studies were performed in predicting the drug-like 
properties, protein targets, toxicity profiles, target's functional association, 
and enrichment analysis of Ar-tur. Notably, Ar-tur had targeted 94 proteins, and 
29 proteins of these proteins were among the top 15 targets of the 20 
FDA-approved drugs. These targets were identified to be dysregulated in the 
hippocampus and entorhinal cortex in the AD brain, signifying that targets of 
Ar-tur play roles in disease modification and regulation. Based on gene ontology 
analysis, KEGG, Reactome, and WikiPathways, we identified that Ar-tur regulates 
dopamine neurotransmitter receptor activity and dopamine binding activity. 
Dopamine receptors (DRs), DR2 and DR4, were among its top 15 targets of Ar-tur. 
Molecular docking of DRs with dopamine, cariprazine, brexpiprazole, RO-10-5824, 
CP226269, and donepezil connotes that Ar-tur behaves like an agonist of DR2 and 
DR4 by binding to the active site residues like the dopamine and DR agonists. 
This is the first report stating the impressive drug-like properties of Ar-tur 
and holds the potential to rescue the vulnerable dopaminergic system by 
regulating DRs.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), the leading cause of dementia, involves microglial 
activation, pro-inflammatory cytokine release, and impaired insulin signaling 
via insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) inhibition. Brain insulin resistance 
(BIR) is a key factor in AD progression, disrupting synaptic plasticity and 
neuronal function. Additionally, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and gastric 
inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) signaling, which regulate insulin pathways, are 
compromised in AD. GLP-1/GIP receptor activation or their analogs, such as 
tirzepatide, show potential in mitigating AD neuropathology. However, the 
precise neuroprotective mechanisms of tirzepatide remain unclear. This 
mini-review explores tirzepatide's potential therapeutic effects in AD, focusing 
on its role in restoring insulin signaling, reducing neuroinflammation, and 
improving cognitive function. Understanding these mechanisms could offer new 
insights into AD treatment strategies.

BACKGROUND: Lack of vitamin D is associated with cognitive decline and 
Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, we examined the relationship between plasma 25 
hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and plasma phosphorylated-tau 181 (p-tau 181) and 
neurofilament light chain (NfL) in older adults with memory complaints.
METHODS: This is a cross-sectional analysis of 'Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive 
Trial' baseline data. Subjects were 519 French community-dwelling adults aged 
70+ years at risk of dementia with baseline data on plasma 25(OH)D and plasma 
p-tau 181 and 311 individuals with baseline data on plasma 25(OH)D and plasma 
NfL. Plasma 25(OH)D, p-tau 181 and NfL were measured using high-sensitivity 
immune-based assays and associations were explored using adjusted regression 
analyses.
RESULTS: Subjects had a mean (SD) age of 75.2 years (4.3) and 67.6 % were 
female. The mean (SD) plasma 25(OH)D concentration was 23.5 ng/ml (11.3). The 
mean (SD) concentrations of plasma p-tau 181 and plasma NfL were 9.9 pg/ml (4.5) 
and 81.1 pg/ml (34.1) respectively. We did not find significant cross-sectional 
associations between baseline plasma 25(OH)D and plasma p-tau 181 (Model 3: 
β-coefficient, 0.0003, 95 % CI: -0.0036, 0.0042, p = 0.879) or plasma 25(OH)D 
and plasma NfL (Model 3: β-coefficient, -0.0012, 95 % CI: -0.0055, 0.0032, 
p = 0.599). Age, cognitive status, sex, cardiovascular risk or apolipoprotein ε4 
genotype did not modify these non-significant associations.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide evidence that plasma 25(OH)D is not 
associated with plasma p-tau 181 or plasma NfL in older adults with heightened 
dementia risk. Longitudinal replication studies are essential to validate these 
cross-sectional results.

In recent years, the impact of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) on the nervous 
system, particularly on neurodegenerative diseases, has garnered widespread 
attention. Epidemiological studies have shown that exposure to PM2.5 is closely 
associated with the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
However, the mechanisms through which PM2.5 exacerbates AD remain unclear. 
Scorpion venom heat-resistant synthetic peptide (SVHRSP) is a pharmacologically 
active product synthesised from the amino acid sequence of scorpion venom 
heat-resistant peptide. In this study, we investigated the mechanism through 
which PM2.5 exposure aggravates neuronal pyroptosis and validated the protective 
effects of SVHRSP against AD. PC12 and HT22 neuronal cells were used to 
construct in vitro models of AD. Mice were stereotactically injected with 
Aβ25-35 protein to induce AD. Subsequently, PM2.5 exposure-induced changes in ER 
stress, pyroptosis, and oxidative stress in AD models, were detected through in 
vivo and in vitro experiments. The results indicated that PM2.5 exposure 
aggravated cognitive impairment, ER stress, and pyroptosis in mice with AD. 
Conversely, treatment with SVHRSP counteracted the damage induced by PM2.5 
exposure. At a mechanistic level, PM2.5 might enhance oxidative stress and 
trigger pyroptosis by suppressing the expression of Nrf-2. These findings offer 
novel insights into the mechanisms through which PM2.5 exposure hastens the 
progression of AD and propose a promising strategy for the pharmacological 
treatment of AD.

BACE1 as an early biomarker and its relevance to risk factors for Alzheimer's 
disease.

USA. Electronic address: masuo.ohno@nki.rfmh.org.

While the β-secretase BACE1 is responsible for the rate-limiting initial step to 
generate amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides, BACE1 inhibitor clinical trials have been 
halted due to a lack of efficacy and/or safety concerns at symptomatic/prodromal 
stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). These trials were often targeted at high 
levels of BACE1 inhibition (>70 %) and ended up with signs of mild cognitive 
worsening instead of expected improvement. BACE1 concentration and activity are 
elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid and plasma/serum as well as brains of 
patients with mild cognitive impairment and AD dementia. Interestingly, recent 
evidence suggests that these fluid-based biomarkers reflective of BACE1 
elevation may be associated with yet asymptomatic pathological changes in 
preclinical AD populations who are at high-risk for developing AD. Consistent 
with these findings, it has been demonstrated that exposures to major 
environmental and genetic risks such as diabetes, sleep disturbances, seizure, 
vascular disorders, stress, apolipoprotein E4, etc. converge on BACE1 elevation 
in humans and animal models, which may contribute to triggering sporadic AD. 
Moreover, vicious cycles exist between BACE1/Aβ elevations and certain 
prognostic conditions, further accelerating disease progression. Conversely, 
protective factors for AD are associated with reduced BACE1 level/activity. This 
review provides an overview of BACE1 alterations as common responses to a broad 
battery of AD risk and protective factors. The findings validate BACE1 as a 
biomarker for preclinical AD status that may be useful for earlier diagnosis and 
identifying subpopulations of individuals under AD risks who would benefit from 
preventive low-dose BACE1 inhibitor treatment with a higher probability.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulation that leads to synaptic 
dysfunction and neuronal death. Ponicidin, a natural diterpenoid, possesses 
anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. However, its potential effects 
on Aβ-induced neurotoxicity remain unclear. This study investigated whether 
ponicidin ameliorates Aβ1-42-induced hippocampal neuronal injury by modulating 
SIRT1 and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways.
METHODS: HT22 cells were exposed to Aβ1-42 to establish an in vitro AD model, 
followed by treatment with ponicidin. Cell viability, apoptosis, oxidative 
stress, and inflammatory responses were assessed using MTT assay, flow 
cytometry, ROS detection, and ELISA. Western blotting and qRT-PCR were performed 
to evaluate the expression of SIRT1, the components of the PI3K/Akt pathway, and 
neuroinflammation.
RESULTS: Ponicidin significantly attenuated Aβ1-42-induced cytotoxicity, reduced 
oxidative stress, and suppressed apoptosis and inflammatory cytokine release. 
Mechanistically, ponicidin upregulated SIRT1 expression and activated PI3K/Akt 
pathway. The protective effects of ponicidin were reversed by the PI3K/Akt 
inhibitor EX-527, confirming the involvement of this pathway.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that ponicidin exerts neuroprotective effects 
against Aβ1-42-induced hippocampal injury by enhancing SIRT1 and activating 
PI3K/Akt signaling, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic candidate for 
AD.

BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a transitional stage before 
Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRD). The link between AD and 
increased health care resource utilization (HCRU) and costs is well established 
but not the economic burden of MCI.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incremental economic burden of individuals with MCI 
in the United States.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study that derived data from the 
MarketScan Commercial and Medicare Supplemental Databases. The observation 
period was from January 1, 2014, through December 31, 2019. Included individuals 
were (1) aged at least 50 years, (2) had at least 2 years of pre-index (ie, date 
of their first MCI diagnosis) continuous health plan enrollment, and (3) had at 
least 1 year of post-index continuous health plan enrollment. Individuals were 
excluded if they had (1) at least 1 claim with a diagnosis of Parkinson disease 
at any time during the study period, (2) at least 1 claim with a diagnosis of 
ADRD at any time before the index date, or (3) at least 1 pharmacy claim for an 
ADRD medication (donepezil, memantine, memantine/donepezil, galantamine, or 
rivastigmine) at any time before the index date. Outcomes included all-cause 
HCRU and health care costs for incident MCI individuals (MCI cohort) and matched 
individuals without MCI or dementia (control cohort) during the 12-month 
follow-up period. Controls were matched at a 3:1 ratio by age, sex, region, and 
index year.
RESULTS: In total, 5,185 individuals met the criteria for the MCI cohort and 
15,555 for the control cohort. Mean age at baseline was 67 years and 57.7% were 
female in both cohorts. The MCI cohort had a higher comorbidity burden compared 
with the control cohort (1.5 vs 1.0 and 2.6 vs 1.8, respectively; P < 0.0001) 
All comorbidities assessed at baseline were more prevalent in the MCI cohort 
than in the control. Adjusted all-cause HCRU for all points of service and 
adjusted all-cause mean costs in total ($32,318 vs $13,894; mean ratio 
[MR] = 2.33, 95% CI = 2.23-2.43), for emergency department ($4,460 vs $3,849; 
MR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.08-1.25), outpatient ($16,054 vs $7,265; MR = 2.21, 95% 
CI = 2.12-2.30), and pharmacy ($5,503 vs $2,933; MR = 1.88, 95% CI = 1.78-1.97) 
(all P < 0.0001) were significantly higher for the MCI cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: The economic burden of MCI was more than double that for similar 
individuals without MCI or dementia. Timely diagnosis and intervention are key 
to delaying progression to AD and reducing associated costs.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The APOE (apolipoprotein E) ε4 allele is the 
strongest known genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer disease (AD) and for 
brain amyloidosis, an early marker of disease pathophysiology. However, APOE ε4 
is present in only 25% of the general population and is by itself inadequate for 
explaining susceptibility to amyloid accumulation or AD diagnosis. Existing 
studies have been limited by potential confounding due to inclusion of 
individuals carrying APOE ε4 or ε2 (which has a modest protective association). 
We hypothesized that genome-wide association study (GWAS) and genetic risk score 
(GRS) analyses in APOE ε3/ε3 individuals would uniquely identify novel 
predictors of β-amyloid pathology in older adults.
METHODS: We analyzed data from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA), 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), and Rush Religious Orders 
Study and Memory and Aging Project. Frequency of APOE ε3/ε3 in those samples 
ranged from 48% to 61%. A GWAS was performed across 1,496 individuals with 
amyloid PET to identify candidate variants for GRS generation. Postmortem 
neuropathologic data (N = 710) were used to refine the variant list to capture 
high-likelihood true associations. An independent sample (N = 641) with plasma 
p-tau181 data was used for validation.
RESULTS: The GWAS identified previously implicated (e.g., PICALM and RBFOX1) and 
novel potential associations with amyloid PET burden. A non-APOE GRS of top 
variants was strongly associated with amyloid PET levels in the MCSA (p = 4.34 × 
10-9, β = 5.88) and ADNI (p = 1.87 × 10-8, β = 12.1) cohorts. In both cohorts, 
this non-APOE amyloid GRS outperformed a comparator GRS (based on variants 
associated with clinically diagnosed AD dementia risk) in explaining phenotypic 
variation. The non-APOE amyloid GRS was also associated with postmortem 
neuropathologic β-amyloid and neurofibrillary tangle burden and in an 
independent sample was associated with plasma p-tau181 concentrations (a robust 
indicator of cerebral amyloidosis).
DISCUSSION: Our non-APOE amyloid GRS, which appropriately includes variants 
associated with amyloid deposition in APOE ɛ4/ɛ2 noncarriers, may advance 
personalized prediction of genetic susceptibility to β-amyloid accumulation 
within the large segment of the population that is APOE ε3/ε3. This may have 
future implications for risk modification, trial enrollment, and treatment 
selection.

BackgroundMild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a critical stage with higher 
progression to Alzheimer's disease, yet effective interventions are still 
lacking.ObjectiveSome empirical studies have shown that transcranial 
photobiomodulation (tPBM) may be effective in enhancing cognitive function. To 
further investigate its effectiveness, a controlled experiment was 
conducted.MethodsIn this study, 36 community-dwelling older adults with MCI were 
assigned to receive either real tPBM (experimental group; n = 25) and others 
without intervention (control group; n = 11) over three weeks. Participants 
underwent comprehensive assessments before and after the intervention, including 
neuropsychological tests, measurements of oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO) using 
function near-infrared spectroscopy during a visual working memory task, 
saccadic movement measurement using an eye-tracking device, and a questionnaire 
assessing depressive symptoms.ResultsCompared to the control group, the 
experimental group demonstrated significant improvements. They showed enhanced 
cognitive efficiency, as evidenced by improved visual working memory 
performance, reduced anti-saccade latency, higher scores in the Montreal 
Cognitive Assessment, and faster completion time in the Shape Trail Test B. In 
addition, significantly more participants in the experimental group showed 
improvement in depressive symptoms after the intervention.ConclusionsThese 
findings provide preliminary evidence that tPBM may effectively improve 
neuropsychological, physiological, and psychological outcomes in individuals 
with MCI. This trial was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry 
(http://www.chictr.org.cn, registration number: ChiCTR2400090408).

BackgroundIt is increasing recognized that care for people with neurocognitive 
disorders (NCDs) is costly, and cost of NCDs can be highly context 
dependent.ObjectiveTo evaluate the healthcare utilization and economic costs of 
NCDs in Hong Kong, cross referencing with other Asian metropolitan 
cities.Methods461 older adults aged ≥60 (major NCD: 68, mild NCD: 264, normal 
cognition: 129) were recruited from a population-based cross-sectional survey, 
Hong Kong Mental Morbidity Survey for Older People. Healthcare utilization was 
collected by Resource Utilization of Dementia. Per person cost was estimated 
from a societal perspective and expressed in 2022 US dollars. Cost-associative 
factors were explored. Our findings were compared to cost-of-illness evidence in 
major Asian metropolitan cities by a systematic review.ResultsAnnual costs per 
community-living adult with mild and major NCD were US$5677 (95%CI: 4985-6465) 
and US$12,841 (9940-16,590) in Hong Kong. For those with major NCD, costs 
doubled in severer stages, and diagnosed cases incurred nearly 30% more costs 
than hidden cases. Dementia cost in Hong Kong was lower than other high-income 
Asian economies and mainland China, mainly due to methodological heterogeneities 
and lower utilization of social care services.ConclusionsThe great economic 
burden of NCDs in Hong Kong reflects a striking social and care needs, 
particularly in moderate and severe stages. Care planning should prepare for the 
blowout needs being revealed by hidden cases and the diversified needs by 
different stages and family caregivers. Region- and population-specific studies 
with rigor design are warranted to estimate cost-effectiveness of upcoming 
treatment strategies.

BackgroundAlzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
frequently associated with dysphagia, leading to malnutrition, dehydration, and 
aspiration pneumonia. The Eating Assessment Tool-10 (EAT-10) is widely used for 
dysphagia screening; however, its reliability in advanced AD, where cognitive 
impairments hinder self-reporting, remains uncertain.ObjectiveThis study aimed 
to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of EAT-10 in detecting dysphagia and 
aspiration across different AD stages.MethodsThe study included 30 AD patients 
classified into mild, moderate, and advanced stages based on Clinical Dementia 
Rating (CDR) scores. Dysphagia was assessed using EAT-10 and validated through 
Videofluoroscopic Swallowing Study (VFSS) and the Penetration-Aspiration Scale 
(PAS). Statistical analyses included the Mann-Whitney U test, Spearman 
correlation, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis 
(p < 0.05).ResultsEAT-10 scores significantly differed across AD stages 
(p = 0.001), with mean scores of 3.11 ± 1.17 (mild), 11.70 ± 4.64 (moderate), 
and 18.00 ± 6.90 (advanced). Unsafe swallowing and aspiration were observed in 
43.3% and 23.3% of patients, respectively, with higher prevalence in advanced 
AD. ROC analysis determined an EAT-10 cut-off score of 15 for unsafe swallowing 
(AUC: 0.96, sensitivity: 88%, specificity: 77%) and 18 for aspiration (AUC: 
0.81, sensitivity: 81.2%, specificity: 75%). Strong correlations were found 
between EAT-10 and PAS scores (r = 0.812, p < 0.001).ConclusionsEAT-10 is an 
effective screening tool for dysphagia and aspiration risk in early and moderate 
AD stages. However, in advanced AD, objective assessments like VFSS remain 
essential to complement EAT-10 results. Integrating EAT-10 into routine 
evaluations may enhance early detection, enabling timely interventions and 
improved clinical outcomes.

Neurodegenerative disorders are characterised by the chronic progressive 
degeneration of specific neuronal subtypes, neuroinflammation, myelin damage and 
synaptic loss. Despite their growing incidence, advancements in effective 
treatments remain limited, because of lack of knowledge for the aetiology of the 
diverse pathophysiology to design systematic therapies. Several studies 
highlight the role of neurotrophic factors (NTFs) as potential neuroprotective, 
regenerative therapies for these disorders. Although NTFs hold protective and 
regenerative potential for chronic neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative 
conditions, major hurdles impair their clinical use, such as optimising the 
dosage of NTFs, minimising the invasiveness of delivery methods, overcoming 
blood-brain-barrier (BBB) impermeability and managing side effects. In the last 
two decades our group have synthesised and screened a large chemical library of 
steroidal analogues of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), an endogenous steroid 
hormone, for their ability to mimic neurotrophin neuroprotective and neurogenic 
actions. Interestingly, DHEA was shown to interact with all neurotrophin 
receptors, acting most probably as an ancestral neurotrophin early in evolution. 
However, its chronic pharmacological use is questioned by its action as a major 
precursor of steroidogenesis. This review highlights the findings of numerous 
preclinical studies on these synthetic, non-toxic, BBB permeable DHEA 
derivatives, named microneurotrophins (MNTs), deprived of endocrine actions, 
activators of specific neurotrophin receptors. The multimodal actions of MNTs 
against neuronal death and activation of microglia, in addition to their 
beneficial effects in synaptogenesis and neurogenesis, place them as interesting 
lead molecules in the armamentarium of therapeutics for neurodegeneration.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
in the elderly, characterized by extracellular amyloid β‑ (Aβ) plaque deposition 
and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Impaired autophagy, the 
cellular pathway for degrading damaged organelles and misfolded proteins, and 
cellular senescence, permanent cell cycle arrest with proinflammatory 
secretions, have emerged as key contributors to AD pathogenesis.
METHODS: We performed a narrative review of recent mechanistic and preclinical 
studies investigating (1) autophagic flux and its role in Aβ and tau clearance; 
(2) the accumulation and secretory phenotype of senescent cells in the aging 
brain; (3) interactions between autophagy impairment and senescence; and (4) the 
efficacy of autophagy enhancers (e.g., rapamycin and metformin) and senolytic 
agents in rodent models of AD.
RESULTS: Defective autophagosome-lysosome fusion in AD causes autophagic vacuole 
buildup with amyloid precursor protein and β‑secretase, boosting Aβ generation 
and hindering tau clearance, promoting neurofibrillary tangles. In AD models, 
senescent neurons and microglia release pro‑inflammatory cytokines (SASP), 
fueling neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction. Decline in autophagy induces 
senescence and blocks clearance in a vicious cycle. Rapamycin and metformin 
restore autophagic flux, reduce Aβ and tau pathologies, and improve memory. 
Senolytics clear senescent cells, reduce inflammation, and rescue cognition.
CONCLUSION: Dysregulated autophagy and cellular senescence interact to drive the 
progression of AD. Targeting these pathways with autophagy-boosting drugs and 
senolytic agents holds promise for disease-modifying therapies aimed at halting 
or reversing neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease.

Mitophagy is a selective type of autophagy that removes damaged mitochondria to 
maintain mitochondrial homeostasis and regulate the antiviral immune response. 
Despite increasing evidence that herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection 
causes mitochondrial damage, the regulatory mechanisms governing mitochondrial 
homeostasis and its biological implications in the context of HSV-1 infection 
and viral encephalitis remain unclear. In our recent work, we find that HSV-1 
infection causes the accumulation of damaged mitochondria via defective 
mitophagy in vitro and in brain tissue of mice. The viral proteins ICP34.5 and 
US11 inhibit the EIF2S (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit 
alpha)-ATF4 (activating transcription factor 4) axis to transcriptionally 
suppress PRKN/Parkin expression and subsequently impede PRKN-dependent 
mitophagy. Consequently, modulation of mitophagy significantly affects HSV-1 
infection and NFKB/NF-κB-mediated neuroinflammation, as well as the severity of 
viral encephalitis in mice. Moreover, taurine, a metabolite differentially 
regulated by HSV-1 infection, transcriptionally promotes PRKN-mediated 
mitophagy, thereby limiting HSV-1 infection both in vitro and in vivo. This work 
reveals a protective function of mitophagy in restricting viral encephalitis and 
highlights the ATF4-PRKN axis as a potential therapeutic approach for the 
treatment of neurotropic virus-related diseases.Abbreviations: Aβ: amyloid β

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifaceted neurodegenerative 
disorder with a complex etiology that extends beyond the well-documented 
amyloid-β and tau pathologies. Growing evidence implicates cerebrovascular 
dysfunction, particularly brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) 
dysfunction, as an early contributor to AD pathogenesis. However, how BMECs 
influence on neighboring astrocytes needs to be further explored.
METHODS: We employed a multi-omics approach integrating bulk RNA sequencing of 
human BMECs with proteomic analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from AD 
patients and cerebrovascular endothelial extracellular vesicles (CEEVs). The 
role of identified candidate proteins was investigated in vitro and in vivo 
utilizing CEEVs transplantation and BMEC-astrocyte co-cultures. Endothelial 
cell-specific knockdown or treatment with a monoclonal antibody was used to 
assess the functional consequences on cognitive impairment and AD pathology via 
two-photon imaging and behavioral experiments on APP/PS1 mice.
RESULTS: The elevated endothelium-specific protein Endoglin (ENG) was identified 
in the brain and serum of AD individuals and APP/PS1 mice, and the supernatant 
of injured BMECs. ENG was released and delivered to adjacent astrocytes via 
CEEVs, and subsequently upregulated TGFBRI/Smad3 pathway in astrocytes, leading 
to astrocyte reactivity and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. 
Endothelial cell-specific ENG knockdown or treating with ENG monoclonal antibody 
Carotuximab significantly suppressed reactive astrocytes, reduced 
neuroinflammation, and improved cognitive performance of APP/PS1 mice.
CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals a novel mechanism by which BMECs-derived ENG, 
delivered via CEEVs, drives astrocyte reactivity. These findings redefine the 
role of cerebrovascular dysfunction in AD pathogenesis and identify ENG as both 
a potential biomarker and a promising therapeutic target for AD.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) typically presents in early to middle adulthood, but 
owing to advancements in health care, many individuals with MS now live a normal 
lifespan, and approximately half of the people currently living with MS are 
≥50 years of age. As people living with MS age, their diagnosis, treatment and 
disease management become more complex owing to the effects of ageing, 
immunosenescence and comorbidities. Furthermore, diagnosis of late-onset MS 
(onset above 50 years of age) often requires additional tests, such as spinal 
cord imaging and cerebrospinal fluid analysis, to differentiate the disease from 
age-associated conditions such as cerebrovascular disease. Monitoring disease 
progression also becomes more complicated with increasing age, as physiological 
age-related changes can confound MRI findings and measurements of disability and 
cognition. Treatment decisions in older people with MS are also challenging, as 
high-efficacy treatments carry increased risks with ageing and their benefits 
can be reduced, yet little evidence is available to guide treatment in older 
adults. In this Consensus statement, we present the outcomes of an International 
Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials (IACCT) in MS workshop on ageing and MS; 
we review the current status of the field and identify knowledge gaps, and 
provide recommendations to advance the areas of unmet need.

Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), a redox-sensitive member of the 
mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) family, is a master 
regulator of neuronal apoptosis as well as neuroinflammation in 
neurodegenerative disorders (NDs). Under oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum 
stress conditions, ASK1 sets off a series of pathways, ultimately leading to 
impairment of cellular functions and the cell's demise. The comprehensive review 
focuses on the diverse contributions of ASK1 to neurodegeneration driven by 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and multiple sclerosis (MS). Human and 
animal evidence links dysregulated ASK1 signaling is related to amyloid 
deposition, tau hyperphosphorylation, neuroinflammation, abnormal protein 
folding, and subsequent neurodegeneration. ASK1 plays a role in tau 
hyperphosphorylation and amyloid-beta-induced neurotoxicity in AD. ASK1-mediated 
apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons caused by oxidative stress and aggregation of 
α-synuclein contributes to PD. Furthermore, ASK1 activation is associated with 
motor neuron degeneration in ALS related to endoplasmic reticulum stress caused 
by mutant SOD1. Moreover, the pathogenesis of HD involves the activation of ASK1 
by the cellular stress caused by mutant huntingtin protein. ASK1 signaling 
potentiates inflammatory signals in MS because it is involved in demyelination 
and neuronal injury. Nonetheless, obstacles persist such as developing 
brain-targeted therapies, reducing adverse systemic effects, and defining 
disease-stage-specific functions of ASK1. This review aims to comprehensively 
examine the role of ASK1 signaling in major NDs, discuss its upstream and 
downstream regulatory mechanisms, and evaluate the current and emerging 
therapeutic strategies targeting ASK1.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions 
worldwide. In the absence of effective treatment options, early diagnosis is 
crucial for initiating management strategies to delay disease onset and slow 
down its progression. In this study, we propose Retformer, a novel 
transformer-based architecture for detecting AD using retinal imaging 
modalities, leveraging the power of transformers and explainable artificial 
intelligence. The Retformer model is trained on datasets of different modalities 
of retinal images from patients with AD and age-matched healthy controls, 
enabling it to learn complex patterns and relationships between image features 
and disease diagnosis. To provide insights into the decision-making process of 
our model, we employ the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping algorithm to 
visualise the feature importance maps, highlighting the regions of the retinal 
images that contribute most significantly to the classification outcome. These 
findings are compared to existing clinical studies on detecting AD using retinal 
biomarkers, allowing us to identify the most important features for AD detection 
in each imaging modality. The Retformer model outperforms a variety of benchmark 
algorithms across different performance metrics by margins of up to 11%.

Alzheimer's disease is the most frequent neurodegenerative disease and the 
leading cause of dementia worldwide. With disease-modifying treatments highly 
requested, numerous aptamers have been experimentally selected, showing high 
affinity and specificity binding to the main drivers in the pathology. Still, 
more studies are needed to compare the biochemical properties and target 
interactions to streamline the generation of high-efficacy therapeutics. With 
recent improvements in bioinformatics, we predicted the 2D and 3D structures of 
known aptamers based on literature-derived sequences, followed by molecular 
dynamics, molecular docking, and MM/PBSA binding affinity simulations of the 
aptamer-target complexes. We observed a strong correlation between experimental 
affinity values and predicted binding free energies, demonstrating the value of 
implementing computational strategies to streamline the selection process. We 
identified DNA aptamers as most promising due to their high predictability 
compared to RNA aptamers and the low docking scores of peptide aptamers. 
Furthermore, we identified hydrophobic and basic amino acids most frequently 
contributing to the interaction, with the basic amino acids, arginine, 
histidine, and lysine accounting for most interactions in all groups. This 
suggests that forming hydrophobic pockets and ionic interactions mediates 
aptamer binding, allowing a more directed targeting of Alzheimer's disease and 
providing the basis for future modifications.

There is no cure for Alzheimer's disease (AD) with the currently suggested 
therapies. Thus, designing and synthesis of new drugs for the treatment of 
Alzheimer's disease for safe and effective therapy have become an important 
task. Metal ions such as Zn2+, Cu2+, and Fe3+ are known to increase the rate of 
Aβ aggregation and exist in amyloid plaques at high concentrations. Aβ 
oligomers, whether formed on the way to amyloid fibril formation or formed 
off-pathway due to the interaction of Aβ monomers with Zn2+, are considered to 
be the most neurotoxic aggregates. Using NMR and SPR, this study reports the 
methylsulfonamide inhibition of Zn2+-induced Aβ1-16 dimer formation via 
methylsulfonamide coordination of Zn2+ within the Zn2+ binding region of Aβ, 
(11EVHH14) and inhibit the H14-Zn2+ coordination between the 11EVHH14 regions of 
two Aβ peptides, preventing their interactions and hence the Aβ dimer formation. 
According to the results of this study, methylsulfonamide has the potential to 
be used as a drug in Alzheimer's disease for the prevention of the formation of 
the Zn2+-induced toxic Aβ oligomers formed during Aβ aggregation.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition with marked cognitive 
loss and impaired thinking abilities as well as spatial memory, working memory, 
and communication skills. Numerous studies have found that both type 1 and type 
2 diabetes lead to neuropathological and neurobehavioral problems, which lead to 
notable cognitive dysfunction and deterioration in memory. The aims of this 
study are to find out the neuroprotective potential of eupalitin on memory in 
streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats and to evaluate its in silico binding 
affinity on acetylcholinesterase by using molecular docking studies. Eupalitin 
(dose 1 mg/kg/day) was used to study the behavior model and other biochemical 
parameters measurement in acute as well as chronic streptozotocin (STZ)-induced 
diabetic rats. Eupalitin treatment increased the level of acetylcholinesterase 
(AChE) and lipid peroxidation and decreased glutathione in STZ-infused diabetic 
rat's brain tissue, suggesting that this substance may modulate cognitive 
function that is altered by oxidative stress. Results were comparable to 
standard drugs metformin and donepezil. Docking score and molecular mechanics 
generalized born surface area (MMGBSA) study results of eupalitin in comparison 
with donepezil possess superior predicted binding affinity toward AChE. The 
level of Aβ (1 - 42) was considerably lower in the eupalitin-treated group than 
in the STZ-treated group during both the acute and chronic phases of treatment, 
but results were more prominent in the case of chronic-level treatment. In 
silico studies showed the binding affinity toward AChE. This result concluded 
that eupalitin antioxidant potential may be utilized as a therapy for diabetes 
mellitus (DM)-related cognitive impairment.

Amyloid beta (Aβ42) aggregation plays a key role in the progression of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), contributing to neuronal damage and cognitive 
impairment. This research examines ovalene, a structurally defined model of 
graphene quantum dots (GQDs), for its potential to inhibit Aβ42 aggregation. 
Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that ovalene interferes with Aβ42 
protofibril stability in a concentration-dependent manner by disrupting key 
hydrophobic and aromatic interactions, thus hindering β-sheet formation and 
fibril growth. Additionally, ovalene prevented Aβ42 dimerization, an early step 
in amyloid aggregation. Experimental assays, including Thioflavin T fluorescence 
and circular dichroism, confirmed that ovalene reduces fibril formation while 
maintaining Aβ42 in its monomeric state. Cytotoxicity studies demonstrated that 
ovalene counteracts Aβ42-induced toxicity in Neuro-2a cells, with no harmful 
effects on normal or cancerous cells. In a Drosophila AD model, ovalene 
significantly lowered amyloid levels, showing the strongest effect at 2 mg/mL. 
These results support GQD's potential as an anti-amyloid therapy.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents the most prevalent neurodegenerative 
disorder worldwide. Recent studies highlights that mitochondrial dysfunction 
drives alterations in microglial function, serving as a pivotal mechanism in the 
pathogenesis and progression of AD. Increasingly, there is evidence that 
mitochondrial dysfunction encompasses energy metabolism deficits, heightened 
oxidative stress, impaired mitochondrial dynamics, disrupted autophagy, and 
calcium homeostasis imbalances. These impairments modulate microglial activation 
states, precipitating exacerbated neuroinflammation, altered phagocytic 
capacity, and increased cellular apoptosis, collectively contributing to 
microglial dysfunction. This paper presents a narrative review on the 
relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction and AD, elucidating the impact of 
mitochondrial impairment on microglia. It summarizes therapeutic strategies that 
target mitochondria to modulate microglial function, aiming to prevent and treat 
AD. The goal is to provide new perspectives and insights for AD research and 
treatment, contributing to improving patients' quality of life and prognosis.

    Res Sq. 2023 Feb 06:rs.3.rs-2536079. doi: 10.21203/rs.3.rs-2536079/v1.

OBJECTIVE: By leveraging real-world electronic health record (EHR) data, this 
study set out to estimate individualized treatment effects (ITE) in longitudinal 
observational settings to advance personalized medicine, addressing key 
challenges that are often observed in real-world clinical scenarios and pose 
statistical challenges, including hidden confounding and dynamic treatment 
regimens.
METHODS: We propose the Variational Temporal Deconfounder Network (VTDNet), a 
novel framework designed to account for time-varying hidden confounding using a 
variational recurrent transformer-based autoencoder. Specifically, VTDNet 
comprises three critical components: a temporal Encoder-Decoder structure to 
capture hidden representation, a Treatment Block that captures interdependencies 
among multiple treatments, and a Potential Outcome Block that predicts both 
factual and counterfactual outcomes. We assess the effectiveness of the proposed 
framework using a synthetic dataset and two real-world datasets: MIMIC-III, an 
EHR dataset focusing on intensive care settings, and NACC, emphasizing 
neurodegenerative disease, collected using a standardized protocol from 
participants enrolled in Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) clinical 
cores.
RESULTS: Experimental results on the synthetic dataset demonstrate superior 
accuracy under varying levels of confounding. On real-world EHR datasets, VTDNet 
achieves lower root mean squared error, mean absolute error, and influence 
function precision in the estimation of heterogeneous effects compared to 
existing state-of-the-art methods.
CONCLUSION: The proposed VTDNet offers a robust framework for estimating 
individualized treatment effects in longitudinal settings, effectively 
accommodating irregular time points and high-dimensional data while addressing 
hidden confounders through a deep generative approach. It holds significant 
potential to advance personalized medicine and support real-world evidence 
generation. Future work will aim to extend VTDNet to continuous treatment 
scenarios, such as dose-response analysis, to further broaden its applicability 
in clinical practice.

BACKGROUND: The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is crucial for cognitive 
control and a primary target for transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, understanding the distribution of TMS-induced 
electric field (E-field) across different targeting methods remains limited, as 
does its relationship to therapeutic outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: This study assesses differences in TMS-induced E-field using 
functional versus anatomical targeting methods for DLPFC stimulation.
METHODS: Functional and anatomical targets were identified in 30 (11 M/19F) AD 
patients and 30 (13 M/17F) age-matched healthy controls (HCs) using T1 and fMRI 
data. E-field characteristics, including magnitude (EROI) and normal component 
(E⊥), were calculated via SimNIBS software for comparisons across stimulation 
targets.
RESULTS: Functional targeting showed greater spatial dispersion compared to 
anatomical targeting in both groups. Significant E-field differences were 
observed between the functional target and adjacent anatomical regions when the 
coil was positioned over the functional target in both groups. Optimal coil 
orientation exhibited directional specificity: parallel alignment with the LOI 
E-field produced higher field intensity in the functional target compared to the 
anatomical target (AD patients: P < 0.001; HCs: P = 0.052), while perpendicular 
orientation maintained functional stability with reduced anatomical interference 
(both groups: P < 0.001). And significant variations in E-field ratios were 
observed across coil orientations.
CONCLUSION: This study reveals key E-field disparities across DLPFC targeting 
approaches and establishes coil orientation optimization as a critical strategy 
to improve TMS precision, offering actionable insights for developing 
personalized protocols in AD therapy that may enhance treatment efficacy while 
minimizing adverse effects.
