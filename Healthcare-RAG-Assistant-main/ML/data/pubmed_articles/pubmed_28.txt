The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is widely utilised as a live vertebrate model in 
research on neurological development and nervous system diseases. This species 
exhibits various distinctive attributes that render it well-suited for 
investigating neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Zebrafish 
and humans have a genetic similarity of around 70%, and approximately 84% of the 
genes associated with human diseases have zebrafish equivalents. The genetic 
similarities and presence of neurotransmitters like dopamine allow scientists to 
study PD genes and proteins. Zebrafish are often challenged with neurotoxins to 
induce Parkinsonian symptoms, allowing researchers to evaluate attendant 
biochemical pathways. Zebrafish can also repair damaged organs, increasing their 
potential value in PD research. Because of their regenerative capacity and 
genetic resemblance to humans, these species can be used to study dopamine 
neurodegeneration and prospective PD treatments. In addition to PD, zebrafish 
are helpful models for studying Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, 
epilepsy, depression, schizophrenia, and anxiety disorders. This article 
emphasizes significant findings of relevance to PD using the zebrafish model, 
describing its challenges and benefits. The investigation of key genes, protein 
pathways, and neurotoxins provides the opportunity to facilitate understanding 
of the role of dopamine neurotransmitters in PD and expedite the development of 
potentially promising therapeutic strategies.

INTRODUCTION: We evaluated the independent and combined efficacies of MindMoves 
(24-week physical activity and cognitive training) on cognition and serum 
neurotrophic biomarkers in older women with cardiovascular disease (CVD).
METHODS: This 2 × 2 factorial design randomized controlled trial (NCT04556305) 
tested efficacies of Mind (cognitive training) and Move (lifestyle physical 
activity) on change in cognition (global composite derived from three domains) 
and four serum biomarkers at baseline, 24, 48, and 72 weeks post-baseline in 
older women with CVD without cognitive impairment.
RESULTS: Of 253 participants randomized (mean age = 72.8; 57% non-Hispanic 
White), 87% completed the trial, though health-behavior adherence was low (Mind 
45%, Move 33%). Interventions were not significant for global cognition. There 
were Mind x Move interaction effects for semantic memory and one biomarker, but 
these were counter to the hypothesized synergistic effects.
DISCUSSION: Mind and Move, alone or in combination, were not associated with 
improved cognition in this sample. Future research should emphasize adherence.
CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT04556305.
HIGHLIGHTS: This trial evaluated the efficacy of a lifestyle intervention in 
women with cardiovascular disease. The trial did not show a significant 
difference in global cognition. There were significant effects of physical 
activity on secondary outcomes. Future research should focus on adequate 
intervention adherence and intensity.

of Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review the association between Alzheimer pathology and 
dementia and the role of mAbs targeting amyloid in the treatment of people with 
dementia and mild cognitive impairment.
RECENT FINDINGS: There is an association, but Alzheimer pathology explains less 
than 40% of the attributable risk of dementia when other pathologies such as 
vascular, Lewy Body and TDP-43 are accounted. Recent trials of passive 
immunization with MABs, including Aducanumab Lecanemab and Donanemab, have 
demonstrated some benefits but the effects are small in size and may be due to 
bias. The side effect of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) is common 
and potentially serious. The costs of assessments for treatment and actual 
treatment costs are large compared with potentially modest benefits.
SUMMARY: It is still uncertain about the place of MABs in the treatment of 
Alzheimer's dementia. Further research is required regarding the long-term 
benefits and risks.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent type of dementia, negatively 
affecting the overall quality of life. Targeting the nuclear factor erythroid 
2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway, a regulator of protective genes, offers 
potential AD therapies. Inhibiting Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), 
which suppresses Nrf2, may help reduce neuronal damage. Rhizophora mucronata, a 
mangrove known for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, contains 
rutin, which is a promising potential AD therapy. The study aimed to explore the 
potential of rutin, a compound from R. mucronata leaves, to inhibit the 
Keap1-Nrf2. The study analyzed the metabolomic profile of R. mucronata leaves 
and evaluated their compound, rutin, as AD therapeutic potential via the 
Keap1-Nrf2 pathway using in silico molecular docking. R. mucronata was extracted 
using 96% ethanol. Metabolomic analysis employed liquid chromatography-high 
resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). The in silico simulations used BIOVIA 
Discovery Studio and AutoDock Tool 1.5.7 for docking rutin and donepezil with 
the Keap1. Docking results were evaluated based on binding energy scores and 
inhibition constant. HRMS identified hundreds of compounds, with quercetin and 
rutin as major flavonoids. Molecular docking indicated rutin and donepezil had a 
binding energy of -6.97 ± 0.16 kcal/mol and -7.63 ± 0.04 kcal/mol, respectively. 
Their amino acid interaction was similar. R. mucronata leaf extract, 
particularly rutin, showed promise as an AD therapeutic agent through the 
Keap1-Nrf2 pathway, warranting further research.

Comparison between treatment-placebo difference and saved time measures to 
assess treatment effect in Alzheimer's disease.

Author information:

BACKGROUND: The estimated treatment-placebo difference from fitted statistical 
models is often used to evaluate the treatment effect. In addition, we may use 
time saving as an alternative measure to assess the treatment benefit to 
patients. Two methods were developed to estimate saved time based on the placebo 
or treatment disease progression curve.
OBJECTIVE: In this article, we are interested in comparing the performance of 
the traditional model and saved time measures with regards to the statistical 
hypothesis testing.
METHODS: By mimicking data from the Phase 2 and 3 donanemab trials, we studied 
three different treatment disease progression trajectories.
RESULTS: The traditional treatment-placebo difference model often has higher 
statistical power values than the saved time methods when sample size is small 
to medium. As sample size goes up, saved time methods have similar statistical 
power and they could be more powerful than the traditional model in some cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Saved time methods may be considered in future Alzheimer's disease 
trials to improve the efficiency in drug discovery.

Rarer dementias are associated with atypical symptoms and younger onset, which 
result in a higher burden of care. We provide a review of the global literature 
on longitudinal decline in activities of daily living (ADLs) in dementias that 
account for less than 10% of dementia diagnoses. Published studies were 
identified through searches conducted in Medical Literature Analysis and 
Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE), Excerpta Medica Database (Embase), Excerpta 
Medica Care (Emcare), PsycINFO, and Cumulative Index in Nursing and Allied 
Health Literature (CINAHL). The search criteria included terms related to 'rarer 
dementias', 'activities of daily living' and 'longitudinal or cross-sectional 
studies' following a predefined protocol registered. Studies were screened, and 
those that met the criteria were citation searched. Quality assessments were 
performed, and relevant data were extracted. 20 articles were selected, of which 
19 focused on dementias within the frontotemporal dementia/primary progressive 
aphasia spectrum, while one addressed posterior cortical atrophy. Four studies 
were cross-sectional and 16 studies were longitudinal, with a median duration of 
2.2 years. The Disability Assessment for Dementia was used to measure decline in 
8 of the 20 studies. The varied sequences of ADL decline reported in the 
literature reflect variation in diagnostic specificity between studies and 
within-syndrome heterogeneity. Most studies used Alzheimer's disease staging 
scales to measure decline, which cannot capture variant-specific symptoms. To 
enhance care provision in dementia, ADL scales could be deployed postdiagnosis 
to aid treatment and planning. This necessitates staging scales that are 
variant-specific and span the disease course from diagnosis to end of life.

In this comprehensive review, we delve into the significant body of research on 
single-cell transcriptomics in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to understand 
neurological diseases with autoimmune, neurodegenerative, infectious, or 
oncogenic origins. We thoroughly examine all published studies in these areas, 
with a particular focus on multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and 
Parkinson's disease. For these diseases, we review findings related to immune 
cells that infiltrate the brain, based on postmortem brain tissue analyses and 
include CSF cytometry findings. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), 
single-cell T cell receptor sequencing (scTCR-seq), and single-cell B cell 
receptor sequencing (scBCR-seq) are increasingly vital tools for studying CSF to 
understand various aspects of neurological diseases. These advanced techniques 
allow researchers to explore the etiopathogenesis of these conditions by 
identifying the roles and interactions of different immune cells. scRNA-seq 
provides detailed insights into the gene expression profiles of individual 
cells, revealing how specific cell types contribute to disease progression. 
scTCR-seq and scBCR-seq enable the study of clonal expansion in T and B cells, 
respectively, and facilitate antigen prediction, helping to uncover the nature 
of antigens that trigger adaptive immune responses. By integrating these 
technologies, scientists can define new therapeutic targets and categorize 
patients, leading to more personalized and effective treatments. This review 
highlights the promising advancements and addresses the current limitations of 
single-cell transcriptomics in the context of CSF and neurological diseases, 
setting the stage for future breakthroughs.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasingly recognized as a disorder not solely of 
amyloid and tau accumulation but also of chronic immune dysregulation. Emerging 
evidence highlights the critical role of neuroinflammation, characterized by 
sustained activation of microglia and astrocytes, cytokine release, and 
inflammasome activation in accelerating AD progression. Genome-wide studies have 
further identified key inflammatory genes and immune pathways associated with 
increased disease risk. This review critically evaluates the mechanistic 
underpinnings of neuroinflammation in AD, focusing on glial cell behavior, 
immune signaling, and their contribution to neuronal dysfunction. Importantly, 
the review highlights recent advances in anti-inflammatory therapeutic 
approaches, including modulators of IL-1β, TNF-α, TREM2, and CB2 pathways. By 
integrating mechanistic and therapeutic insights, this work underscores the 
potential of immunomodulatory strategies as viable interventions in AD and 
provides a novel framework for future research in targeted 
anti-neuroinflammatory treatments.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is mainly manifested by cognitive dysfunction, 
accompanied by excessive β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition and neuroinflammation. The 
regulation of vagus nerve (VN) signal transmission is crucial for influencing 
the pathological progression of AD and exploring new therapeutic approaches. Two 
doses of 2'-fucosyllactose (2'-FL, 500 and 1000 mg kg-1) were administered 
orally to AD model mice. 2'-FL rescued spatial and recognition memory deficits 
in AD mice. Moreover, 2'-FL reduced Aβ deposition and neuroinflammation. 2'-FL 
enhances c-Fos expression in the solitary tract nucleus (NTS). This suggested 
that 2'-FL alleviated AD-related cognition by enhancing VN afferent activity. 
Vagotomy demonstrated that the alleviation of AD-related cognition by 2'-FL 
depended on the presence of VN. Moreover, 2'-FL enhanced gut barrier function 
and alleviated gut inflammation. Notably, 2'-FL also reshaped the gut microbiota 
composition, increasing the relative abundance of Intestinimonas, Muribaculum, 
and others. Moreover, 2'-FL promoted the production of short-chain fatty acids 
(SCFAs). Correlation analysis showed that propionate was highly correlated with 
other related indicators. After vagotomy, although 2'-FL promoted SCFA 
production, it did not alleviate cognitive impairment. This suggested that the 
neuroprotective effect of SCFAs could also be partially dependent on the VN. 
2'-FL rescued the cognitive deficits in AD mice, which was partly explained by 
changes in gut microbial composition, production of SCFAs, and the presence of 
VN.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable neurodegenerative disorder that 
debilitates an overwhelming number of people in the aging population worldwide. 
The aggregated forms of the amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide play an important role in 
the onset of AD. Small molecules that can bind to Aβ are useful for in vitro 
assays, in vivo imaging, and in therapeutic research. Herein, a series of 
compounds that can target Aβ aggregates and inhibit their formation were 
developed. The interaction of several compounds with the Aβ peptide was found to 
modulate the formation of aggregates. These N-alkylamino stilbene compounds 
offer selectivity toward Aβ species against other in situ proteins and have 
potential for aiding the development of soluble Aβ aggregate selective AD 
probes.

Disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) accompanies many brain diseases, 
including stroke, neurodegenerative diseases, and brain tumors, leading to 
swelling, increased neuroinflammation, and neuronal death. In recent years, it 
has become clear that the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway is 
involved in disruption of the structural integrity of the BBB. Activation of the 
JNK signaling pathway has a negative effect on the functioning of the cellular 
elements of the neurovascular unit that form the BBB. The aim of this review is 
to assess the role of the JNK signaling pathway in the disruption of the 
structural integrity of the BBB in animal models of stroke (MCAO/R, middle 
cerebral artery occlusion with reperfusion), Alzheimer's disease, and brain 
tumors and to analyze the effects of compounds of various natures that directly 
or indirectly affect the activity of the JNK signaling pathway. These compounds 
can reduce damage to the BBB and brain edema, reduce neuroinflammation and 
oxidative stress, reduce the expression of proapoptotic factors, and increase 
the expression of tight junction proteins. Certain compounds mitigate BBB 
dysfunction, being promising candidates for neuroprotective therapies. These 
agents exert their effects, in part, through inhibition of the c-Jun N-terminal 
kinase (JNK) signaling pathway, a mechanism linked to reduced neuronal damage 
and improved BBB integrity.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is considered one of the main pathologies of our time, 
whose incidence and prevalence are suggested to be strongly underestimated. AD 
presents as a complex neurodegenerative condition characterized by marked 
neuroinflammation and a significant decline in the cognitive and mnemonic 
functions of affected patients. Recognized AD pathological hallmarks include 
amyloid beta plaque and neurofibrillary tangle formation, synaptic dysfunction 
with considerable apoptosis of cholinergic and dopaminergic neurons, and high 
levels of oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. The available pharmacological 
treatments are represented by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors to treat the mild 
to moderate form of the disease and N-methyl-D-aspartate inhibitors alone or in 
combination with the previously cited ones in the late stage of the 
neurodegenerative condition. Furthermore, emerging drug therapies such as 
monoclonal antibodies are promising agents in AD management. Although scientific 
evidence highlights these chemicals as effective in slowing down disease 
progression, significant limitations behind their employment derive from the 
notable dose-dependent side effects and the single-target mechanism of action. 
In this context, two well-studied phytotherapeutics, W. somnifera (W. somnifera) 
and fungi belonging to the genus Cordyceps, have gained attention for their 
chemical composition regarding their neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory 
effects. Ashwagandha (obtained principally from the roots of W. somnifera) is an 
adaptogen that relieves stress and anxiety. It contains several ergostane-type 
steroidal lactones-such as withanolides and withaferin A-and various alkaloids, 
contributing to its antioxidant and neuroprotective effects. Likewise, 
cordycepin is the main bioactive principle found in Cordyceps fungi. This 
natural nucleoside has been reported to possess therapeutic potential as an 
anti-cancer, immunomodulatory, and anti-inflammatory agent, with some studies 
suggesting a beneficial role in AD treatment. The purpose of the present review 
is to investigate the pharmacological properties of W. somnifera and Cordyceps 
species in the context of AD treatment and explore the therapeutic potential of 
the constitutive bioactive molecules in preclinical models mimicking this 
neurodegenerative condition.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by 
considerable cognitive decline and functional impairment, primarily due to the 
progressive alteration of neurons, microglia, and astrocytes. Pathological 
manifestations of AD include the loss of synaptic plasticity, reduction in 
synaptic strength by amyloid-beta, aggregation, and neurotoxicity from tau 
protein post-translational modifications, all contributing to the disruption of 
neural networks. Despite its current pharmacological treatment for AD, different 
approaches to treat such disease are being developed, from a microbiome 
perspective. The microbiome encompasses a diverse microorganism, including 
beneficial bacteria that create a positive impact to diminish AD pathogenesis. 
Growing evidence suggests that probiotic, prebiotic, synbiotic, and postbiotics 
can positively modulate the gut-brain axis, reducing systemic inflammation, 
restoring neurotransmitter balance, and improving gut health, thereby possibly 
mitigating AD pathogenesis. Moreover, there is paraprobiotics as the most 
recently developed biotherapeutic with beneficial effects. This review explores 
the correlation between AD and gut-brain axis as a novel biotherapeutic target. 
The underlying mechanism of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in AD is examined. 
Novel insights into the current applications as potential treatment and its 
limitations are highlighted.

Iron-Mediated Overexpression of Amyloid Precursor Protein via Iron Responsive 
mRNA in Alzheimer's Disease.

University, Riyadh 11533, Saudi Arabia.

Iron accumulation in the brain is widespread in Alzheimer's disease (AD), the 
most common cause of dementia. According to numerous studies, too much iron 
triggers the development of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and amyloid-β (Aβ) 
plaques, both of which accelerate the onset of AD. Iron sequestration and 
storage were disrupted by high iron, and the pattern of interaction between iron 
regulatory proteins (IRPs) and iron-responsive elements (IREs) was altered. The 
5'-untranslated regions (5'-UTRs) of their APP mRNA transcripts have an IRE 
stem-loop, which is where iron influx enhances the translation of the amyloid 
precursor protein (APP). Iron regulated APP expression via the release of the 
repressor interaction of APP mRNA with IRP1 by a pathway similar to the iron 
control translation of the ferritin mRNA by the IREs in their 5'-UTRs. This 
leads to an uncontrolled buildup of redox active Fe2+, which exacerbates 
neurotoxic oxidative stress and neuronal death. Fe2+ overload upregulates the 
APP expression and increases the cleavage of APP and the accumulation of Aβ in 
the brain. The level of APP and Aβ, and protein aggregates, can be downregulated 
by IRPs, but are upregulated in the presence of iron overload. Therefore, the 
inhibition of the IRE-modulated expression of APP or Fe2+ chelation offers 
therapeutic significance to AD. In this article, I discuss the structural and 
functional features of IRE in the 5'-UTR of APP mRNA in relation to the cellular 
Fe2+ level, and the link between iron and AD through the amyloid translational 
mechanism. Although there are currently no treatments for AD, a progressive 
neurodegenerative disease, there are a number of promising RNA inhibitor and 
Fe2+ chelating agent therapeutic candidates that have been discovered and are 
being validated in April 2025 clinical trials. Future studies are expected to 
further show the therapeutic efficacy of iron-chelating medications, which 
target the APP 5'-UTR and have the ability to lower APP translation and, 
consequently, Aβ levels. As a result, these molecules have a great deal of 
promise for the development of small-molecule RNA inhibitors for the treatment 
of AD.

Serotonin (5-HT) is a neurotransmitter that also plays an important role in the 
regulation of vascular tone and angiogenesis. This review focuses on the 
involvement of the 5-HT system in pathological processes leading to the 
development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). There is evidence that damage or 
dysfunction of the 5-HT system contributes to the development of AD, and 
different subtypes of 5-HT receptors are a potential target for the treatment of 
AD. A link has been established between AD, depression, stress, and 5-HT 
deficiency in the brain. There are new data on the role of circadian rhythms in 
modulating stress, depression, and the 5-HT system; amyloid β (Aβ) plaque 
clearance; and AD progression. Circadian disruption inhibits Aβ plaque clearance 
and modulates AD progression. The properties and functions of 5-HT, its 
receptors, and serotonergic neurons are presented. Special attention is paid to 
the central role of 5-HT in brain development, including neurite outgrowth, 
regulation of somatic morphology, motility, synaptogenesis, control of dendritic 
spine shape and density, neuronal plasticity determining its role in network 
regeneration, and changes in innervation after brain damage. The results of 
different studies indicate that the interaction of amyloid β oligomers (AβO) 
with mitochondria is a sufficient trigger for AD-related neurodegeneration. The 
action of 5-HT leads to an improvement in mitochondrial quality and the 
restoration of brain areas after traumatic brain injury, chronic stress, or 
developmental disorders in AD. The role of a healthy lifestyle and drugs acting 
on serotonin receptors in the prevention and treatment of AD is discussed.

Neurodegenerative diseases are a group of conditions that have in common the 
progressive damage and degeneration of neurons in the central nervous system. 
This group includes Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and multiple 
sclerosis, among others. In recent years, increasing evidence has pointed to the 
important role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of these conditions. The 
occurrence of inflammation in the brain, which is often triggered by 
pro-inflammatory activation of microglia or astrocytes, can consequently lead to 
a chronic inflammatory response that contributes to the development of 
neurodegenerative processes. Inflammatory processes themselves, both within the 
nervous system and throughout the human body, appear to be central to the 
initiation and progression of neuronal damage. Understanding the role of 
inflammation in these diseases may open up new perspectives and opportunities in 
the future in the development of effective therapies to improve patients' 
quality of life as the vast majority of cases of patients affected by 
neurodegenerative diseases continue to be treated symptomatically since causal 
treatments are lacking. In this review, we provide information on the impact of 
inflammation on the pathogenesis, course, and potential therapeutic options for 
selected neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, this article provides a 
general description of neuroinflammation and the involvement and role of 
specific cells in the central nervous system.

BACE1 Inhibition Protects Against Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus by Restoring Insulin 
Receptor in Mice.

β-secretase 1 (BACE1), known for its role in amyloid-β production associated 
with Alzheimer's disease (AD), has also been suggested to be elevated in 
patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Notably, BACE1 could cleave the 
insulin receptor (InsR), leading to reduced InsR levels, which may impair 
insulin signaling and contribute to insulin resistance. Presently, we observed 
decreased InsR levels and impaired glucose disposal in the livers of mice with 
systemic overexpression of BACE1 (HUBC mice). This suggests that elevated BACE1 
could contribute to insulin resistance by shedding membrane InsR. Additionally, 
mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD), a well-established model of T2DM, displayed 
increased BACE1 levels and decreased InsR. To further investigate whether 
inhibiting BACE1 could enhance insulin sensitivity and alleviate symptoms of 
diabetes, we treated HFD mice with the BACE1 inhibitor Elenbecestat. Remarkably, 
the administration of Elenbecestat restored InsR levels and improved their 
downstream signaling pathways, leading to increased insulin sensitivity and 
enhanced glucose tolerance. In summary, our findings suggest that inhibiting 
BACE1 can restore InsR expression and improve insulin-signaling sensitivity, 
ultimately resulting in enhanced diabetic phenotypes.

Neurodegenerative diseases are characterised by the progressive loss of neurons, 
leading to a decline in specific brain functions. Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 
Parkinson's disease (PD) are the most prevalent, affecting approximately 60 
million people worldwide. The pathogenesis of these diseases is complex, 
combining inflammatory, oxidative, and excitotoxic processes that result in 
neuronal dysfunction and death. Despite recent advances, there is currently no 
cure for AD and PD. Available therapies demonstrate limited efficacy, 
highlighting the continuing need for novel therapeutic approaches. Ergolide, a 
naturally occurring sesquiterpene lactone from the Inula brittanica plant, has 
shown immunoregulatory properties in systemic immune cells and potential 
applications in certain cancers. This study examines whether the therapeutic 
effects of ergolide extend to the brain. We explored its mechanisms of action in 
vitro, and its capacity to restore behavioural integrity in zebrafish models of 
inflammation and neurotoxicity in vivo. We report the ability of ergolide to 
attenuate inflammatory cytokine and nitric oxide (NO) production from microglia 
in response to toll-like receptor activation. We further propose a role for the 
NFκB and cysteinyl leukotriene (CysLT) pathways in ergolide-mediated regulation 
of microglial activation. Ergolide did not protect against oxidative-induced 
neuronal death in vitro or mitigate seizure activity in zebrafish. Instead, we 
revealed a pro-oxidant and cytotoxic effect on neuroblastoma cells. Importantly, 
ergolide improved survival and alleviated the dysfunction in sensorimotor 
behaviour in a zebrafish model of inflammation. Our findings reveal a 
neuroprotective effect of ergolide, likely stemming from its immunoregulatory 
capacity. We also support further investigation of the CysLT pathway as a 
therapeutic target for neuroinflammatory-related disease.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is 
characterized by amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulation and neuroinflammation. A 
previous multicenter, phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial randomized 
179 participants into placebo or resveratrol over 52 weeks. Sub-analysis of CSF 
biomarkers of neuronal damage, inflammation, and microglial activity was 
performed in a subset of patients treated with a placebo (n = 21) versus 
resveratrol (n = 30). Markers of neuronal damage, including neuron-specific 
enolase and hyperphosphorylated neurofilaments, were reduced. Microglial 
activation was measured via a triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 
(TREM)-2 at baseline and after resveratrol treatment. Resveratrol significantly 
reduced CSF TREM2 levels and decreased inflammation and tissue damage, including 
matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-9. Cathepsin D, a lysosomal marker of autophagy, 
was reduced in the resveratrol group compared with placebo, while angiogenin, a 
marker of vascular angiogenesis, was increased. These data suggest that 
resveratrol may exert anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects in AD by 
reducing CSF TREM2 and other markers of neuronal damage. Further research is 
needed to assess the significance of these biomarker changes on clinical 
outcomes in patients with neurodegenerative diseases.

Pathophysiological differences separating small vessel disease (SVD) from 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) may alter treatment approach. Investigating 
peak-arterial and late-capillary perfusion may differentiate SVD from AD. 14 
Subjects with MoCA scores of 11-24 were divided into 2 groups. Group one: 6 AD 
likely subjects positive for 1 or 2 copies of APOE 4+. Group two: 8 SVD likely 
subjects APOE-. Group three: 7 age-matched controls (MoCA 26-30). All underwent 
3D PASL MRI, FLAIR, and SWI axial MRI. Arterial phase peak amplitude and 
latency, late capillary inflow/clearance rates, and anatomic abnormalities 
quantitated using microhemorrhage count, Fazekas, Koedam, and Schelton scales 
were compared. Arterial perfusion demonstrated no statistical differences among 
SVD, AD, and controls, suggesting normal arterial flow. Late phase perfusion 
showed significant localized reduction in capillary flow/clearance rates in SVD 
and AD compared to controls. Absent arterial phase but significant capillary 
inflow/clearance differences from controls suggest SVD and AD share common 
impaired blood-brain barrier origins.

: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder closely associated 
with aging, and its pathogenesis involves the interaction of multidimensional 
pathophysiologic processes. This review outlines the core mechanisms linking 
aging and AD. The amyloid cascade hypothesis emphasizes that abnormal deposition 
of amyloid-β (Aβ) triggers neuronal damage and synaptic dysfunction, which is 
exacerbated by aging-associated declines in protein clearance. 
Neuroinflammation, a synergistic pathogenetic factor in AD, is mediated by 
microglia activation, creating a vicious cycle with Aβ and tau pathology. The 
cholinergic hypothesis states that the degeneration of cholinergic neurons in 
the basal forebrain can lead to acetylcholine deficiency, which is directly 
associated with cognitive decline. Endothelial disorders promote 
neuroinflammation and metabolic waste accumulation through blood-brain barrier 
dysfunction and cerebral vascular abnormalities. In addition, glutamate-mediated 
excitotoxicity and mitochondrial dysfunction (e.g., oxidative stress and energy 
metabolism imbalance) further lead to neuronal death, and aging-associated 
declines in mitochondrial autophagy exacerbate such damage. This review also 
explores the application of animal models that mimic AD and aging in studying 
these mechanisms and summarizes therapeutic strategies targeting these pathways. 
Future studies need to integrate multi-targeted therapies and focus on the role 
of the aging microenvironment in regulating AD pathology in order to develop 
more effective early diagnosis and treatment options.

Bacopa monnieri, also known as Brahmi or Waterhyssop, is a plant used in 
Ayurveda for its memory-enhancing properties and control of blood sugar levels. 
It contains active compounds such as alkaloids, saponins, and cucurbitacins, 
which have various biological activities. The plant has been studied for its 
potential in treating Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, attention 
deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and depression. Animal studies have shown 
promising results in reducing symptoms and protecting against neurodegeneration. 
Concerning safety, Bacopa monnieri has been found to be generally non-toxic, 
with no serious side effects reported. However, interactions with certain 
medications and contraindications in conditions like hyperthyroidism should be 
considered. Further research is needed to determine optimal dosages and ensure 
safety, especially for pregnant and breastfeeding women.

As life expectancy continues to increase, it becomes increasingly important to 
extend healthspan by targeting mechanisms associated with aging. Cellular 
senescence is recognized as a significant contributor to aging and 
neurodegenerative disorders. This review examines the emerging role of 
nutraceuticals and functional foods as potential modulators of cellular 
senescence, which may, in turn, influence the development of neurodegenerative 
diseases. An analysis of experimental studies indicates that bioactive 
compounds, including polyphenols, vitamins, and spices, possess substantial 
antioxidants, anti-inflammatory and epigenetic properties. These nutritional 
senotherapeutic agents effectively scavenge reactive oxygen species, modulate 
gene expression, and decrease the secretion of senescence-associated secretory 
phenotype factors, minimizing cellular damage. Nutraceuticals can enhance 
mitochondrial function, reduce oxidative stress, and regulate inflammation, key 
factors in aging and diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Furthermore, 
studies reveal that specific bioactive compounds can reduce senescence markers 
in cellular models, while others exhibit senostatic and senolytic properties, 
both directly and indirectly. Diets enriched with these nutraceuticals, such as 
the Mediterranean diet, have been correlated with improved brain health and the 
deceleration of aging. Despite these promising outcomes, direct evidence linking 
these compounds to reducing senescent cell numbers remains limited, highlighting 
the necessity for further inquiry. This review presents compelling arguments for 
the potential of nutraceuticals and functional foods to promote longevity and 
counteract neurodegeneration by exploring their molecular mechanisms. The 
emerging relationship between dietary bioactive compounds and cellular 
senescence sets the stage for future research to develop effective preventive 
and therapeutic strategies for age-related diseases.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is characterized by complex brain alterations leading 
to progressive cognitive decline and neuropsychiatric disturbances. This 
narrative review explores these changes and the potential of diet and exercise 
as modifiable lifestyle factors to mitigate AD's impact. While some dietary 
components (e.g., B vitamins, ketogenic diet) and physical activity, 
particularly aerobic exercise, show promise for improving cognitive function and 
managing symptoms, evidence for consistent benefits remains limited and requires 
further investigation. Dietary and exercise research in AD faces significant 
limitations, including intervention complexity, study design challenges, disease 
heterogeneity, and difficulties in measuring long-term effects. Addressing these 
limitations is crucial to fully realize the therapeutic potential of these 
lifestyle interventions in combating AD.

The gut microbiota (GM) may play a crucial role in the development and 
progression of central nervous system (CNS) diseases. Microecologics and 
exercise can influence the composition and function of GM, thereby exerting 
positive effects on the CNS. Combined interventions of exercise and 
microecologics are expected to more comprehensively and effectively address CNS 
diseases through the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA), potentially outperforming 
single interventions. However, there is currently a lack of relevant reviews on 
this topic. In this review, we examine the associations between changes in the 
microbiota and CNS diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's 
disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We 
also summarize studies on various types of microecologics (such as probiotics, 
prebiotics, synbiotics, and postbiotics) and exercise in improving CNS disease 
symptoms. Although current individual studies on microecologics and exercise 
have achieved certain results, the mechanisms underlying their synergistic 
effects remain unclear. This review aims to explore the theoretical basis, 
potential mechanisms, and clinical application prospects of combined 
interventions of microecologics and exercise in improving CNS diseases through 
the MGBA, providing a scientific basis for the development of more comprehensive 
and effective therapeutic interventions.

Objective: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that 
severely impairs cognitive function across various age groups, ranging from 
early to late sixties. It progresses from mild to severe stages, so an accurate 
diagnostic tool is necessary for effective intervention and treatment planning. 
Methods: This work proposes a novel AD classification architecture that 
integrates depthwise separable convolutional layers with traditional 
convolutional layers to efficiently extract features from structural magnetic 
resonance imaging (sMRI) scans. This model benefits from excellent feature 
extraction and lightweight operation, which reduces the number of parameters 
without compromising accuracy. The model learns from scratch with optimized 
weight initialization, resulting in faster convergence and improved 
generalization. However, medical imaging datasets contain class imbalance as a 
major challenge, which often results in biased models with poor generalization 
to the underrepresented disease stages. A hybrid sampling approach combining 
SMOTE (synthetic minority oversampling technique) with the ENN (edited nearest 
neighbors) effectively handles the complications of class imbalance issue 
inherent in the datasets. An explainable activation space occlusion sensitivity 
map (ASOP) pixel attribution method is employed to highlight the critical 
regions of input images that influence the classification decisions across 
different stages of AD. Results and Conclusions: The proposed model outperformed 
several state-of-the-art transfer learning architectures, including VGG19, 
DenseNet201, EfficientNetV2S, MobileNet, ResNet152, InceptionV3, and Xception. 
It achieves noteworthy results in disease stage classification, with an accuracy 
of 98.87%, an F1 score of 98.86%, a precision of 98.80%, and recall of 98.69%. 
These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model for 
classifying stages of AD progression.

Aging is a systemic process marked by progressive multi-organ dysfunction, 
metabolic dysregulation, and chronic low-grade inflammation ("inflammaging"), 
which collectively drive neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease 
(AD) and Parkinson's Disease (PD). Emerging evidence underscores the 
brain-muscle-liver axis as a central hub for maintaining energy homeostasis and 
neuroimmune crosstalk during aging. Here, we elucidate how exercise orchestrates 
inter-organ communication to counteract age-related decline through metabolic 
reprogramming, immunomodulation, and neuroprotection. Mechanistically, exercise 
enhances mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative capacity in skeletal muscle via 
AMPK/PGC-1α signaling, restoring fatty acid oxidation and glucose metabolism 
while producing myokines (e.g., BDNF and IL-6) that promote neuronal survival 
and synaptic plasticity. Concurrently, hepatic SIRT1 activation promotes lipid 
metabolism, mitigates insulin resistance, and reduces systemic inflammation, 
hence preserving brain energy supply. In the aging brain, exercise stimulates 
neurogenesis, suppresses neuroinflammation via NF-κB inhibition, and elevates 
BDNF levels, which synergistically enhance cognitive resilience. vitally, 
exercise modulates the neuro-immunometabolic axis by balancing pro- and 
anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6's hormetic role), optimizing immune cell 
function, and enhancing autophagy-mediated clearance of toxic aggregates (Aβ, 
α-synuclein). These adaptations are further amplified by epigenetic 
reprogramming, including but not limited to Nrf2-driven antioxidant responses 
and circadian rhythm synchronization. Our synthesis highlights exercise as a 
pleiotropic intervention that transcends single-organ influences, instead 
leveraging multi-tissue networks to delay aging and neurodegeneration. 
Unresolved challenges-personalized exercise regimens, molecular biomarkers for 
efficacy prediction, and combinatorial therapies with pharmacologic 
agents-underscore the need for translational studies integrating omics 
technologies and circadian biology. By bridging mechanistic insights with 
clinical applications, this review positions exercise as a cornerstone of 
precision medicine for aging populations.

BACKGROUND: Huntington's disease (HD) is an incurable hereditary disorder caused 
by an expansion of CAG repeats in exon 1 of the Huntingtin gene (HTT). HD is 
characterized by motor dysfunction and cognitive decline. The pathophysiology of 
HD begins in cortico-striatal circuits and later spreads to other brain regions, 
notably the hippocampus. At the cellular level, structural changes in synapses 
have been observed prior to neuronal degeneration, significantly disrupting the 
formation and maintenance of neuronal circuits. The postsynaptic density protein 
95 (PSD-95, hereafter Dlg4/PSD95) is a key synaptic plasticity protein reduced 
in HD and other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Epigenetic silencing of plasticity and memory genes contributes to AD pathology 
and cognitive impairment. To restore endogenous Dlg4/PSD95 expression in AD, we 
previously developed an epigenetic editing strategy where a zinc finger 
DNA-binding domain targeting the Dlg4/PSD95 gene promoter was fused to the 
transactivation domain VP64 and driven under a CMV promoter. AAV-PhP.B-mediated 
delivery of this artificial transcription factor (ATF) CMV-PSD95-6ZF-VP64 
improved cognition in an AD mouse model. Here, we assessed the therapeutic 
potential of AAV9-mediated delivery of the synapsin-driven ATF PSD95-6ZF-VP64 in 
the R6/2 HD mouse model.
RESULTS: Consistent with the previous studies, R6/2 mice exhibited reduced 
hippocampal Dlg4/PSD95 mRNA and protein levels in young adulthood (7 weeks), 
which persisted into early adulthood (14 weeks). Starting at adolescents 
(4 weeks), the R6/2 mice also displayed motor (i.e., accelerated rotarod) and 
cognitive (i.e., Barnes maze and object location memory) impairments. In 
wild-type primary hippocampal cultures, AAV9-PSD95-6ZF-VP64 led to an increase 
in synaptic PSD-95 clusters and spine size. Intracerebroventricular injections 
of neonatal R6/2 mice with AAV9-PSD95-6ZF-VP64 elevated hippocampal Dlg4/PSD95 
expression levels to those observed in control non-transgenic mice. Importantly, 
AAV9-PSD95-6ZF-VP64 effectively improved hippocampal-dependent deficits in 
spatial learning and memory in young adult HD mice, as well as impairments in 
motor coordination and motor skill learning, with these benefits persisting into 
adulthood.
CONCLUSION: This work validates Dlg4/PSD95 as a key player in the prodromal 
phase of HD pathology and establishes the ATF PSD95-6ZF-VP64 as an attractive 
therapeutic tool for treating the disease's early phase.

INTRODUCTION: The societal impact of anti-amyloid treatment (AAT) for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) depends largely on patient eligibility. Estimates 
suggest that 1% to 18% of individuals with AD may qualify for AAT; however, data 
from everyday clinical practice remain limited. This study assessed AAT 
eligibility in patients at a tertiary memory clinic.
METHODS: We included 1309 new patients (63 ± 8 years, 45% women, Mini-Mental 
State Examination [MMSE] 25 ± 5) who presented to the Alzheimer Center Amsterdam 
(2020-2022) for standardized diagnostic workup. Eligibility for AAT was based on 
lecanemab's approved label guidelines.
RESULTS: Of 1309 new patients, 514 (39% of new patients) had clinical mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD. Of these, 108 (8% new patients/21% clinical 
MCI/AD) met Clinical Dementia Rating/MMSE criteria, were amyloid positive, and 
had < 4 microbleeds/superficial siderosis. After further excluding 
apolipoprotein E ε4/ε4 homozygotes and anticoagulant users, 79 patients (6% new 
patients/15% clinical MCI/AD) remained eligible.
DISCUSSION: Findings indicate limited eligibility for AAT in tertiary memory 
clinics.
HIGHLIGHTS: Initial eligibility for lecanemab was 8% of all patients and 21% of 
those with clinical mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
based on approved guidelines in a tertiary memory clinic population. After 
strict exclusions (such as apolipoprotein E ε4/ε4 homozygosity and anticoagulant 
use), eligibility dropped to 6% of all patients and 15% of those with clinical 
MCI or AD. The study highlights the limited real-world applicability of 
anti-amyloid treatment under current guidelines.

Exercise's protective effects in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are well recognized, 
but cell-specific contributions to this phenomenon remain unclear. Here we used 
single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to dissect the response to exercise 
(free-wheel running) in the neurogenic stem-cell niche of the hippocampal 
dentate gyrus in male APP/PS1 transgenic AD model mice. Transcriptomic responses 
to exercise were distinct between wild-type and AD mice, and most prominent in 
immature neurons. Exercise restored the transcriptional profiles of a proportion 
of AD-dysregulated genes in a cell type-specific manner. We identified a 
neurovascular-associated astrocyte subpopulation, the abundance of which was 
reduced in AD, whereas its gene expression signature was induced with exercise. 
Exercise also enhanced the gene expression profile of disease-associated 
microglia. Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells were the cell type with the highest 
proportion of dysregulated genes recovered by exercise. Last, we validated our 
key findings in a human AD snRNA-seq dataset. Together, these data present a 
comprehensive resource for understanding the molecular mediators of 
neuroprotection by exercise in AD.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a global health crisis, with sporadic AD (sAD) 
accounting for more than 95 % of all cases. The lack of effective 
disease-modifying therapies for sAD, driven by its complex pathogenesis 
involving genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors, underscores the urgent 
need for novel treatments. Masitinib, an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor 
originally developed for cancer treatment, has shown potential to regulate mast 
cells and neuroinflammation, making it a promising candidate against AD. In this 
study, we investigated the therapeutic effects of masitinib (60 mg/kg/day) in 
acrolein-induced sAD mouse model. A comprehensive series of behavioral tests, 
including the buried food pellet tests, Morris water maze, Y-maze, open field, 
and elevated plus maze, along with Western blot, immunofluorescence and 
Golgi-Cox staining were used to evaluate pathological changes. The results 
showed that masitinib significantly improved acrolein-induced olfactory 
deficits, cognitive dysfunction, particularly in learning and memory, and 
anxiety-like behaviors. Additionally, masitinib not only reduced p-Tau levels, 
increased PSD95 expression and restored dendritic spine density, but also 
suppressed neuroinflammation by inhibiting the NF-κB/NLRP3/caspase-1 
inflammatory pathway and microglial activation. These findings demonstrate that 
masitinib, for the first time, attenuates sAD pathology through dual mechanisms 
of cognitive enhancement and neuroprotection. Our study provides strong 
preclinical evidence to support further clinical development of masitinib as a 
disease-modifying therapy for sAD.

The development of effective cholinesterase inhibitors remains a critical 
strategy in the search for novel therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease (AD). In 
this work, a series of novel 3-substituted pyrazino[1,2-a]indol-1(2H)-one 
derivatives were rationally designed, synthesized, and fully characterized 
through comprehensive spectral analyses. The cholinesterase inhibitory 
activities of the compounds were systematically evaluated, demonstrating potent 
inhibition against both acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase 
(BChE) at nanomolar concentrations. Notably, compound 16g emerged as the most 
promising candidate, exhibiting 14.28-fold and 9.7-fold greater potency against 
AChE compared to tacrine and donepezil, respectively, and 3.39-fold and 2.3-fold 
higher activity against BChE. Molecular docking studies elucidated key binding 
interactions within the active sites of the enzymes, supporting the observed 
biological activities and providing mechanistic insights. Furthermore, in silico 
drug-likeness and pre-ADMET profiling confirmed the favorable predicted 
pharmacokinetic properties of compound 16g, underscoring its potential as a lead 
compound. These findings collectively highlight the 
pyrazino[1,2-a]indol-1(2H)-one core as a promising structural framework for 
developing next-generation cholinesterase inhibitors aimed at combating AD.

IMPORTANCE: Numerous studies indicate that the traditional categorical 
classification of severe mental disorders (SMD), such as schizophrenia, bipolar 
disorders, and major depressive disorders, does not align with the underlying 
biology of those disorders as they frequently overlap in terms of symptoms and 
risk factors.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify transdiagnostic patient clusters based 
on disease severity and explore the underlying biological mechanisms 
independently of the traditional categorical classification.
DESIGN: We utilized data from 443 participants diagnosed with SMD of the 
PsyCourse Study, a longitudinal study with deep phenotyping across up to four 
visits. We performed longitudinal clustering to group patients based on symptom 
trajectories and cognitive performance. The resulting clusters were compared on 
cross-sectional variables, including independent measures of severity as well as 
polygenic risk scores, serum protein quantification, miRNA expression, and DNA 
methylation.
RESULTS: We identified two distinct clusters of patients that exhibited marked 
differences in illness severity but did not differ significantly in age, sex, or 
diagnostic proportions. We found 19 serum proteins significantly dysregulated 
between the two clusters. Functional enrichment pointed to a convergence of 
immune system dysregulation and neurodevelopmental processes.
CONCLUSION: The observed differences in serum protein expression suggest that 
disease severity is associated with the convergence of immune system 
dysregulation and neurodevelopmental alterations, particularly involving 
pathways related to inflammation and brain plasticity. The identification of 
pro-inflammatory proteins among the differentially expressed markers underscores 
the potential role of systemic inflammation in the pathophysiology of SMD. These 
results highlight the importance of considering illness severity as a core 
dimension in psychiatric research and clinical practice and suggest that 
targeting immune-related mechanisms may offer promising new therapeutic avenues 
for patients with SMD.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Longan Arillus (LA) is the aril of Dimocarpus 
longan Lour. of the Sapindaceae family, commonly known as Guiyuan, whose first 
documentation can be traced back to the ancient book "Shen Nong's herbal 
classic". Since ancient times, LA has been commonly used in combination with 
other herbs or ingredients to make a variety of formulas and medicinal products, 
which were used to treat diseases such as insomnia, forgetfulness, neurasthenia, 
overthinking, fatigue, and deficiency of qi and blood, e.g., "Gui Spleen Tang", 
"Yu Ling Cream", "An Shen Ding Zhi Pill", etc. AIM OF THE REVIEW: This paper 
presents a comprehensive review encompassing LA's traditional usage, quality 
control, botany, phytochemical constituents, pharmacological activities, 
toxicological profiles, pharmacokinetic properties, and clinical applications. 
The aim is to provide an extensive overview of the current research landscape, 
facilitating further exploration and utilization of LA resources.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This article uses "Dimocarpus longan Lour." and "Longan 
Arillus" as the keywords and collects relevant information on LA from different 
databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, X-mol, Sci-finder, SCI-HUB, CNKI, 
Chinese Masters and Doctoral Dissertations, Wanfang Data, Baidu Scholar, Google 
Scholar, ancient material medica and the Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic 
of China (2020).
RESULTS: To date, a total of 378 compounds have been identified in LA, including 
12 sugars, 28 polyphenols, 234 volatile components, 12 terpenes and steroids, 28 
organic acids, 15 lipids, 11 nucleosides, 32 amino acids and 6 others compounds. 
Among them, polysaccharides and polyphenols are its main active ingredients. LA 
has a variety of biological activities, such as immunoregulatory activity, 
inhibition of Alzheimer's disease, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, antioxidant, 
and inhibition of osteoporosis. In particular, immunomodulatory effects have 
received much attention. Pharmacological studies have shown that LA enhances 
immunomodulatory activity through signaling pathways such as MAPK, PI3K/Akt, 
NF-κB, and MyD88/TRAF6. In addition, this paper reveals the shortcomings of 
current LA research and its possible future research directions.
CONCLUSIONS: This paper provides a comprehensive review of LA and highlights its 
multiple pharmacological activities, particularly immunomodulatory effects. 
However, the current in vivo and clinical studies of LA are relatively limited. 
Consequently, the scope of in vivo and clinical studies should be expanded in 
the future. In addition, it is highly recommended that further research efforts 
be directed towards pharmacokinetics and quality control of LA, and a reference 
for future studies on clinical application and new product development of LA.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Piper kadsura (Choisy) Ohwi (P. kadsura), 
locally known as "Haifengteng", is a traditional East Asian herb with over 2000 
years of ethnomedicinal use. It exhibits traditional therapeutic effects, 
including dispelling rheumatism, dredging meridians, and alleviating arthralgia, 
and is primarily used to prevent and treat rheumatic diseases.
AIM OF THE STUDY: This paper reviews the research progress on the botany, 
traditional uses, phytochemistry, pharmacology, and quality control of P. 
kadsura to provide a scientific basis for its rational utilization and further 
research.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The information on P. kadsura was obtained from books 
related to traditional Chinese medicine and electronic databases, including Web 
of Science, PubMed, Google Scholar, and CNKI.
RESULTS: P. kadsura has shown significant efficacy in preventing and treating 
rheumatic diseases when used alone, in herbal formulations, or in traditional 
Chinese medicated diets. To date, 208 compounds, including phenylpropanoids, 
alkaloids, terpenoids, steroids, flavonoids, and others, as well as 379 
essential oils, have been identified in P. kadsura. Pharmacological studies have 
confirmed that its extracts and compounds exhibit diverse activities, including 
anti-platelet activating factor, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antioxidant, 
neuroprotective effects against Alzheimer's disease, anticancer, antiviral, and 
harmful biological control effects.
CONCLUSIONS: P. kadsura exhibits a diverse chemical composition and a wide range 
of pharmacological activities. Despite recent research progress, there are still 
some deficiencies, including limited isolation studies of new compounds, 
incomplete elucidation of some pharmacological mechanisms, significant gaps in 
pharmacokinetic research, and the need for standardized quality control 
measures. Future research should address these issues to fully realize its 
medicinal potential and value.

Tauopathies are a class of nearly 20 neurodegenerative diseases, classified into 
primary and secondary tauopathies. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a type of 
secondary tauopathy in which abnormal phosphorylation of tau proteins takes 
place, which is linked to the kinase activity of dual-specificity 
tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A). Overexpression of DYRK1A 
hyperphosphorylates the tau protein, leading to its aggregation. Inhibiting 
DYRK1A activity can be a promising strategy to prevent tau hyperphosphorylation. 
In this study, we conducted a virtual screening of natural bioactive compounds 
from the ZINC database to identify potential small-molecule inhibitors of 
DYRK1A. The analyses revealed two compounds, ZINC08300244 and ZINC08964763, 
which showed a high binding affinity with DYRK1A and appropriate pharmacokinetic 
properties. Density functional theory (DFT) analysis of these two compounds was 
performed, and their stability of interaction with DYRK1A was further analysed 
by all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for 1 μs. Analysis of the MD 
trajectories was also performed using MM/PBSA and per-residue binding free 
energy decomposition. The results indicated the stable complex formation of 
DYRK1A with the two selected molecules for DYRK1A inhibition to prevent 
tau-hyperphosphorylation. This study highlights the use of virtual screening and 
MD simulations in finding natural product-based inhibitors of DYRK1A, which may 
lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for treating 
neuroinflammatory diseases.

Memory decline is a prominent hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Scopolamine-induced amnesia is a pharmacological paradigm in AD research to 
model these cognitive insults. AD represents the most prevalent type of dementia 
among the elderly, depicted by impaired cognition and memory. AD pathogenesis is 
an interplay among cholinergic signaling disruption, neuroinflammation, and 
oxidative stress. Recently, autophagy modulation has been proven to display a 
beneficial effect against several diseases. l-Theanine (LTA), found in green 
tea, possesses neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antiaging 
properties. Hence, this study investigated LTA's potential to alleviate AD 
symptoms, elaborating the role of autophagy. 45 mice were classified into five 
groups: the control, where animals received phosphate-buffered saline, while the 
other groups received scopolamine (Scop; 1 mg/kg; i.p.), inducing amnesia; then 
they were categorized as follows: group II represented the model one, group III 
was treated with donepezil (DON; 5 mg/kg; p.o.), while group IV was treated with 
LTA (20 mg/kg; p.o.), and group V received chloroquine (CQ; 10 mg/kg; p.o.), an 
autophagy blocker, followed by LTA. LTA stimulated AMP-activated protein kinase 
(AMPK), microtubule-associated protein-1 light chain-3II (LC3II), and beclin 1 
but lowered phosphorylated levels of protein kinase B (p-AKT) and mammalian 
target of rapamycin (p-mTOR). Furthermore, LTA elevated the brain-derived 
neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and downregulated caspase-3 expression. Noteworthily, 
LTA increased glutathione and reduced malondialdehyde and tumor necrosis 
factor-alpha levels. In conclusion, LTA ameliorated histopathological changes, 
reduced amyloid-β, and enhanced learning and memory performance in novel object 
recognition, Y-maze, and Morris water maze. LTA boosted autophagy, promoted 
neuronal survival, and attenuated oxidative stress. LTA almost displayed similar 
effects to the DON group, while CQ abolished LTA-enhanced memory via blocking 
autophagy. Consequently, LTA-mediated autophagy represents a promising approach 
to alleviating Scop-induced amnesia in mice.

Emergency Department Visits by Adults Age 65 and Older With Alzheimer Disease: 
United States, 2020-2022.

Santo L, Schappert SM, Ward BW.

INTRODUCTION: In 2022, Alzheimer disease was the seventh leading cause of death 
in the United States and affected an estimated 6.5 million adults age 65 and 
older. Adults with Alzheimer disease have been shown to rely on emergency 
departments (EDs) as a source for care. This report describes ED visits by 
adults age 65 and older with Alzheimer disease according to selected patient and 
visit characteristics and compares them with visits by adults without Alzheimer 
disease.
METHODS: Data in this report are from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical 
Care Survey, a nationally representative annual survey of nonfederal general and 
short-stay hospitals. Results are presented by combining data for 2020, 2021, 
and 2022 for more detailed subgroup analyses. Estimates and their corresponding 
variances were calculated using SAS-callable SUDAAN software and were based on 
3-year annual averages. Differences between rates and percentages were evaluated 
using two-sided significance  t  tests at the 0.05 level.
KEY FINDINGS: During 2020-2022, the annual ED visit rate by adults age 65 and 
older with Alzheimer's disease was 36.1 visits per 1,000 adults and increased 
with age. ED visit rates were highest among Black non-Hispanic people. Ambulance 
arrival was more frequent for ED visits by adults with Alzheimer's disease 
(61.0%) compared with visits by those without Alzheimer's disease (34.9%). About 
one-third (29.6%) of ED visits by adults with Alzheimer's disease were made by 
nursing home residents, higher than the corresponding percentage of visits by 
adults without Alzheimer's disease (5.9%). Approximately 37.2% of ED visits made 
by adults with Alzheimer's disease resulted in hospital admission, which was 
higher than the corresponding percentage of visits by those without Alzheimer's 
disease (28.6%).

The process of ageing is extremely variable in progression and phenotypic 
features including significant variations in disease milestones, such as 
cognitive impairment, frailty, or recurrent falls. Our aim was to analyze the 
influence of lifestyle factors on motor and cognitive performance in a 
longitudinal ageing study in older people on healthy ageing. We conducted a 
longitudinal analysis in a cohort of 744 older participants (mean 70 years) over 
an 8-year period. Cognitive performance was assessed using the Consortium to 
Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERADplus) test battery, including 
the Trail Making Test (TMT) for executive function. Gait performance was 
evaluated by measuring gait velocity. Dual-task performance was assessed by 
measuring gait velocity while checking boxes. Body Mass Index (BMI) was also 
recorded. Symptoms of depression were examined using Beck's Depression Inventory 
(BDI-II). We observed higher cognitive functions in individuals adhering to a 
high-frequency physical activity regimen and a resilient plant-based diet. 
Additionally, these individuals exhibited lower BDI-II scores and experienced 
mitigated cognitive decline. Participants who combined high physical activity, a 
high intake of plant-based foods, and extensive education-referred to as having 
a high "successful ageing index" -maintained nearly constant CERADplus total 
scores over the 8-year period. Protective lifestyle factors are linked to better 
cognitive and motor performance and a slower decline in cognitive function, 
indicating healthy ageing. Since the factors diet and exercise are modifiable, 
adopting them may enhance cognitive performance and autonomy in older adults.

INTRODUCTION: Claims data typically lack clinical parameters such as dementia 
severity, limiting insights into disease progression and related healthcare 
utilization and costs. Although diagnoses, prescriptions, and utilization 
patterns may serve as proxies, their validity is unclear. This study aimed to 
identify and validate these parameters to distinguish early from severe dementia 
stages.
METHODS: Baseline data from 737 patients with dementia were analyzed. Dementia 
severity was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination and classified as 
early (≥ 27), mild (20-26), and moderate to severe (0-19). Healthcare 
utilization was recorded via structured interviews. Diagnoses, long-term care 
levels, and prescribed medications were extracted from physicians' files. 
Ordinal logistic regression evaluated associations between predictors and 
severity, with average marginal effects (AME) quantifying impact. Sensitivity, 
specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value 
(NPV) were computed for key predictors.
RESULTS: Among the sample (56% female patients, mean age 80), 18% were in the 
early stages, 43% mild, and 39% moderate to severe. Antipsychotic prescriptions 
(odds ratio (OR) 3.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.94-5.95), antidementia 
drugs (OR 2.31, 95% CI 1.56-3.40), and higher long-term care levels (OR 5.59, 
95% CI 2.23-13.99 for level ≥ 4) were associated with advanced severity. AME 
analysis revealed that antipsychotic use reduced early-stage probability by 14% 
and increased severe-stage probability by 21%. Similarly, antidementia drugs 
lowered early-stage probability by 9% and raised severe-stage probability by 
13%. Increasing care levels were associated with a 2-16% decline in early-stage 
probability and a 3-34% rise in severe-stage probability. The combined model 
showed high specificity (99.6%) and PPV (84.6%) for severe dementia, but 
sensitivity and NPV for early stage were low.
CONCLUSION: Antidementia drugs, antipsychotics, and long-term care level serve 
as robust predictors of moderate to severe dementia, whereas early-stage 
detection remains challenging. Future studies should validate these markers and 
explore additional predictors to improve early detection in claims data.

Microtubule affinity-regulating kinase (MARK), particularly MARK4, are involved 
in the pathological phosphorylation of tau, contributing to neurodegenerative 
diseases and conditions such as cancer, inflammation, and atherosclerosis. The 
β-carboline family, specifically Harmane, exhibits broad biological activity, 
including neuroprotective effects. We investigated the inhibitory potential of 
Harmane against MARK4 using both computational and experimental approaches. The 
interaction between Harmane and MARK4 was studied using a combination of 
computational and experimental approaches. Molecular docking was carried out to 
understand the binding of Harmane to the binding pocket of MARK4, focusing on 
key interactions. Molecular dynamics simulations further assessed the stability 
of the MARK4-Harmane complex. Enzyme inhibition assays were conducted to assess 
Harmane's inhibitory potential on kinase, and a fluorescence quenching assay was 
complemented to validate the binding affinity of Harmane with MARK4. Molecular 
docking revealed that Harmane binds to the active site of MARK4, a finding 
supported by molecular dynamics simulations, demonstrating increased stability 
of the MARK4-Harmane complex. Structural analysis further highlighted the 
specificity of this interaction. Enzyme inhibition assays estimated Harmane's 
IC50 (half-maximal inhibitory concentration) value as 2.72 µM against MARK4, 
while fluorescence spectroscopy measured a binding constant (Ka) of 0.1 × 105 
M- 1. These results strengthen the idea that Harmane can be a potent MARK4 
inhibitor, offering therapeutic promise for neurodegenerative diseases and 
cancer.

[Benefits and risks of gabapentinoids in geriatric psychiatry].

[Article in German; Abstract available in German from the publisher]

BACKGROUND: Gabapentinoids (gabapentin, pregabalin) are increasingly being 
prescribed and frequently in off-label indications. This applies also to older 
people.
OBJECTIVE: This article provides a current overview regarding the pharmacology, 
safety and tolerability and efficacy of gabapentinoids in psychogeriatric 
indications, particularly behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia 
(BPSD).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A selective literature search was carried out in the 
databases PubMed and ScienceDirect using the search terms "gabapentin", 
"pregabalin", "dementia" and "elderly".
RESULTS: The precise mechanism of action of the gabapentinoids is unclear but is 
based on inhibition of the α2δ subunits of presynaptic voltage-gated calcium 
channels. Rapid onset of action, principally good tolerability, negligible 
hepatic metabolization, low interaction potential and efficacy in relevant 
comorbid disorders such as epilepsy, neuropathic pain syndrome and anxiety 
disorders can be beneficial in gerontopsychiatric patients; however, in older 
patients there is an increased risk of falls and fractures, respiratory 
depression and pneumonia, cognitive and functional impairments and possibly 
atrial fibrillation. Regarding BPSD only one randomized controlled trial (RCT, 
pregabalin), systematic reviews and case series/case reports are available, 
predominantly reporting good efficacy and tolerability of gabapentinoids. In 
addition, a positive RCT (pregabalin) concerning generalized anxiety disorder 
(GAD) in older patients exists.
CONCLUSION: Currently, sufficient evidence for a recommendation on 
gabapentinoids for the treatment of BPSD (or other off-label indications in 
geriatric psychiatry) or GAD in older patients is not available. In the case of 
insufficient efficacy of nonpharmacological interventions and substances with 
better evidence, gabapentinoids can be considered for the treatment of BPSD and 
GAD in older patients, particularly when the specific characteristics of 
gabapentinoids can be beneficial in a particular case; however, the specific 
risks should be considered.

Publisher: ZUSAMMENFASSUNG: HINTERGRUND: Gabapentinoide (Gabapentin, Pregabalin) 
werden zunehmend häufiger und oft in zulassungsüberschreitender Anwendung 
verordnet, auch bei älteren Personen.
ZIEL DER ARBEIT: Es wird eine aktuelle Übersicht über Pharmakologie, Sicherheit 
und Verträglichkeit sowie Wirksamkeit der Gabapentinoide in 
gerontopsychiatrischen Indikationen, insbesondere psychischen und 
Verhaltenssymptomen bei Demenz (BPSD), gegeben.
MATERIAL UND METHODEN: Es erfolgte eine selektive Literaturrecherche in den 
Datenbanken PubMeb und ScienceDirect mit den Suchwörtern „gabapentin“, 
„pregabalin“, „dementia“ und „elderly“.
ERGEBNISSE: Der genaue Wirkmechanismus der Gabapentinoide ist unbekannt, beruht 
aber auf einer Hemmung der α2δ-Untereinheiten präsynaptischer 
spannungsabhängiger Kalziumkanäle. Rascher Wirkungseintritt, grundsätzlich gute 
Verträglichkeit, vernachlässigbare hepatische Metabolisierung, geringes 
Interaktionspotenzial und Wirksamkeit bei relevanten komorbiden Störungen wie 
Epilepsie, neuropathischen Schmerzsyndromen und Angststörungen können bei 
gerontopsychiatrischen Patienten vorteilhaft sein. Bei älteren Patienten besteht 
allerdings ein erhöhtes Risiko für Stürze und Frakturen, Atemdepression und 
Pneumonie, kognitive und funktionelle Beeinträchtigungen sowie möglicherweise 
für Vorhofflimmern. Hinsichtlich BPSD sind lediglich eine RCT (Pregabalin), 
systematische Übersichtsarbeiten und Fallserien/Fallberichte verfügbar, die 
überwiegend eine gute Wirksamkeit und Verträglichkeit der Gabapentinoide bei 
BPSD berichten. Daneben existiert eine positive RCT (Pregabalin) zu 
generalisierter Angststörung (GAS) bei älteren Patienten.
SCHLUSSFOLGERUNGEN: Gegenwärtig ist keine ausreichende Evidenz für eine 
Therapieempfehlung für Gabapentinoide bei BSPD (oder anderen 
zulassungsüberschreitenden gerontopsychiatrischen Indikationen) oder GAS bei 
älteren Patienten verfügbar. Bei unzureichender Wirksamkeit 
nichtpharmakologischer Maßnahmen und Substanzen mit besserer Evidenz können 
Gabapentinoide zur Behandlung von BPSD und GAS bei älteren Patienten erwogen 
werden, insbesondere wenn sich die spezifischen Merkmale der Gabapentinoide im 
konkreten Fall vorteilhaft auswirken können; die spezifischen Risiken sollten 
jedoch beachtet werden.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Inhibiting γ-secretase-mediated Notch signaling has been 
explored as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease and cancer. However, 
clinical trials have revealed that this approach can lead to side effects, such 
as gut inflammation. Notch signaling has been shown to be a key mediator of 
intestinal epithelial homeostasis. We aimed to investigate the molecular 
mechanisms of γ-secretase inhibition-associated colitis.
METHODS: Mice and small intestinal organoids were treated with γ-secretase 
inhibitors and analyzed for intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) differentiation and 
inflammation-associated markers using different molecular and histological 
approaches, along with transcriptomic and proteomic analyses. To evaluate the 
role of the microbiome in colitis development, mice undergoing pharmacological 
γ-secretase inhibition were treated with antibiotics. Additionally, inflammatory 
bowel disease (IBD) patient samples and control samples were analyzed to assess 
the expression of Notch signaling pathway components in IECs.
RESULTS: This study shows that pharmacological γ-secretase inhibition induces 
inflammation in both the small and large intestine of mice, a phenotype that 
could be rescued upon microbiota depletion. Inhibiting the γ-secretase induced 
structural disruption of the epithelium and inflammatory cytokine release. On a 
molecular level, epithelial organoids exhibited disrupted IEC differentiation 
and impaired proliferation, associated with defective Notch signaling. Finally, 
analysis of IBD patients revealed deregulation of Notch pathway components 
within IECs.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, systemic use of γ-secretase inhibitors disrupts 
epithelial cell function by impairing IEC differentiation and triggering gut 
inflammation in mice. These findings should be considered when designing future 
therapeutic interventions involving γ-secretase inhibitors.

India.

OBJECTIVES: This study explores the potential inhibitory effects of Synta-66 at 
doses of 1 and 5 mg/kg, with a particular emphasis on the role of ORAI-I in 
amyloidogenesis, a common mechanism that underlies type-2 diabetes mellitus 
(T2DM) and Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: Induction of T2DM-induced AD by the high-fat diet (HFD)-Streptozotocin 
(STZ)-Aβ25-35 model. Assessment of behavioral parameters like polydipsia, 
polyphagia, Morris water maze, and passive avoidance test; biochemical 
estimation of glucose, insulin, oxidative stress (superoxide dismutase (SOD), 
glutathione (GSH), catalase (Cat), and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances 
(TBARS)), neuroinflammation (interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), 
tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κβ)), Aβ 
level, through ELISA technique, and calcium levels via atomic absorption 
spectrometer.
KEY FINDINGS: Synta-66 (5 and 10 mg/kg) results in a reduction in food and water 
intake, as well as a reduction in memory impairment in the Morris water maze and 
passive avoidance test. Furthermore, it normalizes glucose, insulin, and 
antioxidant elements (SOD, GSH, and Cat) level, while decreasing TBARS levels. 
In addition, ELISA data demonstrated a reduction in neuroinflammation 
(downregulation of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and NF-κβ), Aβ accumulation, and calcium 
levels by Synta-66 (5 and 10 mg/kg).
CONCLUSION: Consequently, ORAI can play a crucial role in the mediation of 
amyloidogenesis induced by T2DM, thereby establishing a connection between T2DM 
and AD. Therefore, Synta-66 has the potential to treat and prevent the 
progression of T2DM to AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders 
characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide and phosphorylated 
tau protein in the brain. Despite intensive efforts, early diagnosis and 
monitoring of AD remain challenging due to the lack of reliable biomarkers that 
can detect the disease in its preclinical stages. As a result, there exists a 
requirement for novel approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of the disease. 
Extracellular vesicles provide the transfer of Aβ peptides and tau proteins 
between the cells and participates in the spreading/propagation of disease 
pathology. Neuron-derived extracellular vesicles (NDEVs) that are found in 
plasma have emerged as promising candidates, especially for biomarker studies on 
neurodegenerative diseases because they are reachable and comparable with 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies. In addition to known proteins, synaptic 
proteins, transcription factors, or microRNAs have been suggested as new 
biomarkers, aiming to help differential or early diagnosis. Beyond their 
involvement in AD pathology, NDEVs also play essential roles in neurodevelopment 
and aging by mediating cell-to-cell communication and regulating processes such 
as synaptic formation, neuronal differentiation, and neuroinflammation. 
Age-related alterations in EV composition and secretion may contribute to the 
decline in neuroplasticity, thereby increasing susceptibility to 
neurodegenerative diseases like AD. Several challenges such as heterogeneous 
isolation of NDEVs limit the widespread clinical application of them as 
biomarkers for AD. Furthermore, the lack of standardized protocols for vesicle 
isolation and molecular analysis poses a barrier to reproducibility and clinical 
validation. The aim of this review is to elucidate the role of NDEVs in AD 
pathogenesis in comparison with their functions in neurodevelopment and aging, 
evaluate their potential as biomarkers for early diagnosis, while addressing the 
challenges in their isolation, characterization, and clinical application.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) encompasses a range of intricate pathologies 
characterized by aberrant protein aggregation, atypical accumulation of metal 
ions, increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), oxidative stress, 
neuroinflammation, and synaptic dysfunction. These collectively contribute to a 
decline in learning, memory, and cognitive abilities, broadly classified as 
dementia. AD accounting for most of the dementia cases remains a significant 
health challenge. Despite extensive research, therapeutic advancements for AD 
and other neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) have achieved modest success. In 
this context, our study presents a hybrid drug design approach involving 
strategic and tactical repurposing of the structural and functional 
pharmacophores of current or failed drugs and biologically active compounds by 
integrating them into a single structural framework to concurrently target key 
pathological hallmarks viz., amyloid beta (Aβ), tau, metal ions, ROS, and 
neuroinflammation (NLRP3 inflammasome). The evaluation of in vitro and cellular 
models of Aβ, tau, and microglia highlights the efficacy of the 
fluoro-derivative DM4 in mitigating multiple etiological factors. DM4 exhibits 
excellent blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and biocompatibility. DM4 
effectively reduced the amyloid burden, neuroinflammation, synaptic dysfunction, 
and neurodegeneration in the APP/PSEN1 transgenic AD mouse model. Behavioural 
assessments corroborated the rescue of learning and memory deficits, thereby 
presenting a viable strategy for the treatment of neurodegeneration and its 
associated cognitive decline.

Brain-derived extracellular vesicles (BDEVs) carry tau filaments and promote tau 
transmission in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, how APOE ε4 allele, a key 
genetic risk factor for AD, may change BDEV molecular structures thereby 
facilitate disease progression is poorly understood. Here we report 
comprehensive analyses of BDEVs isolated from human E3/3 and E4/4 AD brains with 
a biological multi-omics approach. E4/4 BDEVs significantly enhanced tau 
propagation in aged human MAPT (Tau) knock-in and APP NL-G-F: Tau double 
knock-in mouse brains in vivo and increased neuronal uptake and excitability in 
induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons (iNeurons) compared to E3/3 BDEVs 
in vitro. Notably, correlation analysis of BDEV-lipidome and proteome exhibited 
synergistic enrichment in unsaturated free fatty acid (FFA)18:2, a precursor of 
inflammatory w6 FFA, and neural cell adhesion molecule 1 (NCAM1). Treatment of 
iNeurons with FFA 18:2 induces NCAM1 expression, recruits tau into EVs and 
enhance their tau seeding activity, which is blocked by NCAM1 antibody in vitro. 
Finally, intracerebroventricular injection of NCAM1 antibody significantly 
alleviated pathological tau accumulation and glial inflammation in PS19 
tauopathy mouse brains, which had previously been reported to exhibit increased 
level of 18:2 FFA. This highlights novel pathological mechanism in tau transfer 
mediated by E4/4 BDEVs and emphasizes strong therapeutic potential of targeting 
EV molecules in AD progression.

Repurposing existing medicines to target disease-associated genes represents a 
promising strategy for developing new treatments for complex diseases. However, 
progress has been hindered by a lack of viable candidate drug targets identified 
through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Gene-based association tests 
provide a more powerful alternative to traditional single nucleotide 
polymorphism (SNP)-based methods, yet current approaches often fail to leverage 
shared heritability across populations and to effectively integrate functional 
genomic data. To address these challenges, we developed GenT and its various 
extensions, comprising a framework of gene-based tests utilizing summary-level 
GWAS data. Using GenT, we identified 16, 15, 35, and 83 druggable genes linked 
to Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, major depression, 
and schizophrenia, respectively. Additionally, our multi-ancestry gene-based 
test (MuGenT) uncovered 28 druggable genes associated with type 2 diabetes that 
previous trans-ancestry or ancestry-specific GWAS had missed. By integrating 
brain expression and protein quantitative trait loci (e/pQTLs) into our 
analysis, we identified 43 druggable genes (e.g., RIPK2, NTRK1, RIOK1) 
associated with AD that had supporting xQTL evidence. Notably, experimental 
assays demonstrated that the NTRK1 protein inhibitor GW441756 significantly 
reduced tau hyper-phosphorylation (including p-tau181 and p-tau217) in AD 
patient-derived iPSC neurons, thus providing mechanistic support for our 
predictions. Overall, our findings underscore the power of gene-based 
association testing as a strategic tool for informed drug target discovery and 
validation based on human genetic and genomic data for complex diseases.

Sleep disturbances exacerbate Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, accelerating 
cognitive decline and impairing hippocampal memory functions. This study 
explores the therapeutic potential of transcranial near-infrared (tNIR) therapy 
in mitigating hippocampal dysfunction caused by chronic sleep deprivation (SD) 
in a tauopathy mouse model of AD. Using targeted 808 nm tNIR therapy, we 
observed restored cerebral blood flow, enhanced metabolic reprogramming favoring 
oxidative phosphorylation, and reestablished ionic homeostasis. These effects 
improved hippocampal oscillatory dynamics, including enhanced theta, gamma, and 
delta power, synchronized sharp-wave ripples (SWRs), and improved the 
phase-locking of place cell activity to theta and awake SWR oscillations. tNIR 
therapy also refined spatial encoding precision and reorganized sleep 
architecture, promoting slow-wave sleep while reducing REM disturbances. These 
findings position tNIR therapy as a promising non-invasive approach for 
addressing SD-driven cognitive and neural impairments, offering a novel 
intervention for sleep-related neurodegeneration in AD.

BACKGROUND: Exercise is widely employed to prevent functional decline in 
individuals with Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. Exercise 
interventions are often supervised by physiotherapists, particularly in Western 
countries. However, adherence to exercise-based interventions remains 
suboptimal, particularly among nursing home residents.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the needs and preferences of nursing home residents 
with mild to moderate dementia concerning physiotherapy and exercise 
interventions.
METHODS: Semi-structured individual interviews were conducted with 12 residents 
from various nursing homes who had been diagnosed with mild to moderate 
dementia, were proficient in Dutch, and capable of providing informed consent. 
Data from the interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis.
RESULTS: Four key themes were identified: perceptions of physiotherapy and 
preferences for physiotherapy sessions, defining physiotherapy and exercise, 
exercise without physiotherapist supervision, and communication. In general, 
residents preferred physiotherapy that incorporated exercise and guidance aimed 
at preserving their independent physical functioning. Physiotherapy was 
perceived as more intensive than general exercise classes, and not necessarily 
suitable for all residents. Participants indicated that, provided safety and 
quality were maintained, they were willing to perform exercises independently. 
Residents expressed a desire for their family caregivers to be kept informed 
about their therapy, although they largely preferred to exercise with another 
person.
CONCLUSIONS: Nursing home residents with mild to moderate dementia expressed 
distinct preferences regarding physiotherapy sessions, communication, and family 
caregiver involvement. Addressing these preferences may improve adherence to and 
the effectiveness of exercise interventions. Additionally, the findings suggest 
a potential shift toward a more supervisory role for physiotherapists, rather 
than the traditional hands-on approach.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most prevalent condition that impacts the aging 
population, with no effective treatment or singular underlying causal factor 
identified. As a complex disease, characterizing the genetic risk of developing 
AD has proven to be difficult; polygenic scores (PGS) exclusively use common 
variants which fail to fully capture disease heterogeneity. This study used 
univariate and multivariate approaches to characterize AD risk. Genome-, 
transcriptome-, and proteome-wide association studies (GWAS, TWAS, and PWAS) 
were conducted on 15,480 individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing 
Project (ADSP) R4 release to identify AD-associated signals, followed by pathway 
enrichment analysis. Integrative risk models (IRMs) were developed using 
genetically-regulated components of gene and protein expression and clinical 
covariates. Elastic-net logistic regression and random forest classifiers were 
evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC), area 
under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), F1-score, and balanced accuracy. These 
IRMs were compared against baseline PGS and covariate models. We identified 104 
genomic, 319 transcriptomic, and 17 proteomic associations with AD under 
significant thresholds. Putatively novel associations were enriched in 
signaling, myeloid differentiation, and immune pathways. The best-performing 
IRM, random forest with transcriptomic and covariate features, achieved an AUROC 
of 0.703 and AUPRC of 0.622, significantly outperforming PGS and baseline 
models. Integrating univariate discovery approaches with multivariate modeling 
enhances AD risk prediction and offers insights into underlying biological 
processes.

BACKGROUND: In mild cognitive impairment and dementia due to Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), postmortem and in vivo neuroimaging studies have demonstrated significant 
neuronal loss in the basal forebrain cholinergic system (BFCS), which provides 
the primary cholinergic input to the cerebral cortex. Within this region, 
atrophy is most prominent in the nucleus basalis of Meynert (nbM), a group of 
posteriorly clustered magnocellular neurons in the BFCS. However, less is known 
surrounding the relationship between amyloid deposition, BFCS atrophy, and 
medial temporal lobe (MTL) volume loss in the preclinical stages of AD. The 
current study investigates the relationship between sub-structural BFCS volume 
and cortical Aβ burden in cognitively unimpaired middle-aged individuals at 
varying genetic risk for AD.
METHODS: Cognitively unimpaired participants aged 50-65 with a first-degree 
family history for AD were genetically screened to select three groups: APOE 
genotype ε4ε4 (n=15), ε3ε4 (n=15), and ε3ε3 (n=15), matched for age and sex. 
Participants underwent imaging with [11C]PiB PET and structural 3T MRI. 
Distribution volumes ratios (DVR) with a whole cerebellum reference region were 
calculated for [11C]PiB PET analyses. BFCS sub-structural volumes were obtained 
from the SPM8 Anatomy Toolbox (Cholinergic nuclei [Ch] 1-3, Ch4). MTL 
subregional volumes (entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, parahippocampal 
gyrus) were extracted using Freesurfer.
RESULTS: BFCS amyloid burden was highest among APOE ε4 homozygotes (Ch1-3, F(2, 
42)=3.26, P=0.048; Ch4, F(2, 42)=3.82, P= 0.03). Ch4 (nbM), but not Ch1-3 
volume, was found to be inversely associated with global Aβ burden (Pearson 
r=-0.40, P=0.007). MTL subregional volumes were not associated with global Aβ 
burden in the pooled sample. Exploratory analyses in groups stratified by 
amyloid positivity demonstrated reduced Ch4 volume (P=0.032) and significant 
inverse associations between Ch4 volume and amyloid burden (Pearson r = -0.70, 
P=0.02) in Aβ+ participants.
CONCLUSIONS: We observed nbM (Ch4), but not MTL volume, to be significantly 
inversely associated with cortical amyloid burden in cognitively unimpaired, 
Aβ+, middle-aged adults at varying genetic risk for AD. These findings provide 
further in vivo evidence suggesting that nbM atrophy is an early structural 
correlate of AD pathogenesis, potentially preceding MTL atrophy.

We constructed a polygenic protective score specific to Alzheimer's disease (AD 
PPS) based on the current literature among the participants enrolled in five 
studies of healthy aging and extreme longevity in the US, Europe, and Asia. This 
AD PPS did not include variants on Apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene. Comparisons of 
AD PPS in different data sets of healthy agers and centenarians showed that 
centenarians have stronger genetic protection against AD compared to individuals 
without familial longevity. The current study also shows evidence that this 
genetic protection increases with increasingly older ages in centenarians 
(centenarians who died before reaching age 105 years, semi-supercentenarians who 
reached age 105 to 109 years, and supercentenarians who reached age 110 years 
and older). However, the genetic protection was of modest size: the average 
increase in AD PPS was approximately one additional protective allele per 5 
years of gained lifetime. Additionally, we show that the higher AD PPS was 
associated with better cognitive function and decreased mortality. Taken 
together, this analysis suggests that individuals who achieve the most extreme 
ages, on average, have the greatest protection against AD. This finding is 
robust to different genetic backgrounds with important implications for 
universal applicability of therapeutics that target this AD PPS.

Neurofibrillary tangles are dynamic neuropathologic hallmarks of Alzheimer's 
disease with a hypothesized lifespan morphologically-defined by three maturity 
levels: pretangles, mature tangles, and ghost tangles. To better understand the 
progression of tangle pathophysiology, we characterized tangle maturity level 
predilection of 15 tau antibodies recognizing a broad range of linear, 
phosphorylation, conformational, and truncation epitopes in the hippocampus of 
24 postmortem brains. We developed the tangle maturity scoring system to 
semi-quantitatively evaluate each tangle maturity level. Based on proportions of 
tangle maturity levels, we classified antibodies as "early" (mostly pretangles 
and mature tangles), "middling" (mature tangles with pretangles and ghost 
tangles), and "advanced" (mostly ghost tangles and mature tangles) tangle 
maturity markers. To summarize tangle maturity predilection, we developed the 
tangle maturity scale to integrate individual tangle maturity scores. 
Correlations showed stronger relationships between tangle maturity scale and 
subsector thickness for more advanced tangle maturity markers in CA1 and 
subiculum, whereas Braak tangle stage remained consistently correlated 
throughout markers of the tangle lifespan. To aid in scoring hippocampi, we used 
machine learning to recognize tangle maturity levels, which performed comparably 
to a domain expert and showed similar relationships by Spearman correlation. 
Pattern recognition software was used to assess tangle and neuritic tau burden 
separately, which generally correlated with Braak stage and neuronal counts. 
However, tangle-derived tau burden more consistently correlated with hippocampal 
subsector thickness. In conclusion, we developed manual and automated scoring 
systems to evaluate tangle maturity levels, demonstrating early 4R, 
phosphorylated, and oligomeric tau accumulation preceding more advanced 3R and 
truncated tau. Our study provides supportive evidence of disease-relevant 
ordering of tau posttranslational modifications in the brain, which may have 
implications for theragnostic development. These findings underscore the promise 
of computerized quantitative analyses (i.e., pathomics) for high-throughput 
feature extraction from whole-slide images to enhance our understanding of 
microscopically observed morphologic changes.

In addition to dementia, Alzheimer's patients suffer from sleep impairments and 
aberrations in sleep-dependent brain rhythms. Deficits in inhibitory GABAergic 
interneuron function disrupt one of those rhythms, slow oscillation in 
particular, and actively contribute to Alzheimer's progression. We tested the 
degree to which transplantation of healthy donor interneuron progenitors would 
restore slow oscillation rhythm in young APP mice. We harvested medial 
ganglionic eminence (MGE) progenitors from mouse embryos and transplanted them 
into host APP mutant cortices. 3D light-sheet and structured illumination 
microscopy revealed that transplanted MGE progenitors survived and matured into 
healthy interneurons. In vivo multiphoton calcium imaging and voltage-sensitive 
dye imaging showed functional integration and slow oscillation rescue in absence 
or presence of optogenetic stimulation. Our work provides proof-of-concept 
evidence that stem cell therapy may serve as a viable strategy to rescue 
functional impairments in cortical circuits of APP mice and potentially those of 
Alzheimer's patients.

The gut microbiome modulates metabolic, immune, and neurological functions and 
has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD), though the specific mechanisms 
remain poorly defined. The bacterial metabolite imidazole propionate (ImP) has 
been previously associated with several AD comorbidities, such as type 2 
diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Here, we show that elevated plasma ImP 
levels are associated with lower cognitive scores and AD biomarkers in a cohort 
of >1,100 cognitively unimpaired individuals. Metagenomic profiling identified 
gut bacteria encoding putative orthologs of the ImP-synthesizing enzyme, 
urocanate reductase (UrdA), whose abundance correlated with both cognitive 
measures and multiple AD biomarkers. Chronic ImP administration to mice 
activated neurodegenerative pathways, worsened AD-like neuropathology, and 
increased blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. Complementary in vitro studies 
showed that ImP compromised the integrity of human brain endothelial cells. 
Collectively, these findings implicate ImP in AD progression via both 
neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular mechanisms, identifying it as a potential 
target for early intervention.

TREM2 Activation by First-in-Class Direct Small Molecule Agonists: DEL 
Screening, Optimization, Biophysical Validation, and Functional 
Characterization.

Nada H, El Gaamouch F, Cho S, Kuncewicz K, Calvo-Barreiro L, Gabr MT.

Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is a key regulator of 
microglial function, and its loss-of-function variants are linked to Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) and neurodegenerative disorders. While TREM2 activation is a 
promising therapeutic strategy, no small molecule agonists acting via direct 
TREM2 binding have been reported to date. Here, we describe the discovery of 
first-in-class, direct small molecule TREM2 agonists identified through 
DNA-encoded library (DEL) screening. The DEL hit ( 4a ) demonstrated TREM2 
binding affinity, as validated by three biophysical screening platforms (TRIC, 
MST, and SPR), induced Syk phosphorylation, and enhanced microglial 
phagocytosis. Preliminary optimization yielded 4i , which maintained TREM2 
engagement with improved selectivity over TREM1 and no cytotoxicity. Molecular 
dynamics simulations revealed that 4a stabilizes a transient binding pocket on 
TREM2, suggesting a novel mechanism for receptor activation. These findings 
provide the first proof-of-concept for direct pharmacological TREM2 agonism, 
offering a foundation for developing therapeutics against AD and related 
disorders.

INTRODUCTION: Gamma oscillations in the brain are necessary for normal cognitive 
function, sensory processing, and memory consolidation, and are reduced in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). In a 6 month, randomized, feasibility trial in 
participants with mild-to-moderate AD (OVERTURE [NCT03556280], n = 76), a 
non-invasive method for sensory-evoked brain gamma oscillations outperformed 
sham on the secondary outcomes of slowing decline on the Alzheimer's Disease 
Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) functional scale, 
magnetic resonance imaging measures of whole brain volume and the Mini-Mental 
State Examination (MMSE) cognitive outcome, despite not showing statistical 
significance on the primary outcome (Mild and Moderate Alzheimer's Disease 
Composite [MADCOMS]), a composite cognitive-functional score. In this post hoc 
analysis of OVERTURE, we evaluated the effects of investigational sensory-evoked 
gamma oscillation treatment in terms of time saved, as an estimate of slowing in 
disease progression, on ADCS-ADL, MMSE, and whole-brain volume.
METHODS: Disease trajectories based on the ADCS-ADL, MMSE, and whole-brain 
volume changes from baseline within each treatment group were constructed using 
mixed-effects models. Horizontal projection from active to sham arm yielded time 
saved from baseline at each visit. Data from the open label extension (OLE) 
phase of the OVERTURE study have also been used to analyze the time-saving 
effect of active treatment in an extended period.
RESULTS: Compared to sham, time savings of 4.83, 4.59, and 4.09 months over 6 
months of active treatment on ADCS-ADL, MMSE, and whole-brain atrophy were 
observed in the randomized controlled trial phase. When including the OLE phase, 
time savings of 8.66, 10.00, and 7.48 months over 14.64, 15.98, and 13.46 months 
of active treatment on ADCS-ADL, MMSE, and whole-brain atrophy were observed 
relative to the sham group.
DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that further exploration of the effect of 
evoked gamma oscillations in participants with mild-to-moderate AD, as well as 
the evaluation of treatment effects using time saved, is merited.
HIGHLIGHTS: Evoked gamma oscillation slows functional loss and brain atrophy in 
Alzheimer's disease.Slowing of functional and cognitive decline and brain 
atrophy worsening can be expressed as time saved.Evoked gamma oscillation saves 
4.83 months of progression in activities of daily living, 4.59 months of 
progression in Mini-Mental State Examination, and 4.09 months of decline in 
whole-brain volume over 6 months.

Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), produced mainly by gut microbes, might play a 
role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We examined the SCFAs 
profile in 28 individuals with cognitive impairment due to AD (CI-AD), 29 with 
cognitive impairment not due to AD (CI-NAD), and 10 cognitively unimpaired (CU). 
CI-AD showed higher levels of acetate and valerate and lower levels of butyrate 
than CU and CI-NAD (p < 0.018). Acetate separated CI-AD from CI-NAD with 
AUC = 0.95 while the best neurodegeneration-related biomarker was GFAP with 
AUC = 0.79. SCFAs use for diagnosis and as treatment target in AD deserve 
further studies.

INTRODUCTION: Temporal cortical microstructural changes precede cortical atrophy 
during memory decline. We used neurite orientation dispersion and density 
imaging (NODDI) to assess such early microstructural change.
METHODS: Cognitively unimpaired (CU, n = 725) and mildly cognitively impaired 
(MCI, n = 111) participants from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging underwent 3T 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including NODDI and neuropsychological 
evaluation for calculation of memory z scores. Linear mixed effects modelling 
assessed the relationship between temporal cortical Neurite Density Index (NDI), 
Orientation Dispersion Index (ODI), and both baseline and mean annual change in 
memory z scores.
RESULTS: NDI was significantly associated with both baseline memory z scores and 
mean annual change of memory z scores, in the hippocampi and amygdalae. Similar 
significant associations with ODI were seen in hippocampi, parahippocampal, and 
fusiform gyri.
DISCUSSION: Temporal cortical NDI and ODI are early imaging biomarkers of 
cortical microstructural integrity that may predict memory decline in CU and MCI 
individuals.
HIGHLIGHTS: We imaged 836 participants in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, who 
were either cognitively unimpaired (CU) or suffered from mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI). Neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) is 
an advanced diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique We found 
significant associations between new NODDI imaging biomarkers of microstructural 
integrity and memory function in CU and MCI individuals These relationships were 
both cross-sectional in nature and associated with future memory decline Future 
application of NODDI imaging biomarkers in the setting of anti-amyloid 
monoclonal antibody therapy may provide greater insight into memory decline than 
current cortical atrophy measures.

INTRODUCTION: Longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs), "dementia" 
diagnostic codes, and genetic data from All of Us were used to see if there is a 
higher risk of dementia and an attenuated impact of apolipoprotein ε4 (APOE4) on 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk in Black and Hispanic/Latino groups.
METHODS: Participants included 9,784 Hispanic/Latinos, 14,937 Non-Hispanic 
Blacks (NHB), and 60,388 Non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs) ≥age 60 without an initial 
dementia diagnosis.
RESULTS: There was a significantly higher risk of developing a dementia 
diagnosis in Hispanic/Latino and NHB participants than NHW participants and 
comparably increased dementia hazard ratios in the Hispanic/Latino, NHB, and NHW 
APOE4 carriers than non-carriers (hazard ratio [HR] [95% confidence interval 
{CI}] 1.54 [1.25-1.91], 1.25 [1.00-1.57], and 1.55 [1.40-1.72]).
DISCUSSION: Compared to NHW individuals, Hispanic/Latino and NHB individuals are 
at higher risk of developing a "dementia diagnosis" and comparably higher risk 
in APOE4 carriers than non-carriers. Plasma AD biomarkers could clarify the 
proportion of dementia cases with and without AD and the impact of APOE4 on AD 
in these groups.
HIGHLIGHTS: Hispanic/Latino and non-Hispanic Black individuals have a higher 
risk of all-cause dementia. The impact of apolipoprotein ε4 (APOE4) on dementia 
risk was similar in the studied ethnoracial groups. Plasma biomarkers could 
inform the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and impact of APOE4 in these groups.

INTRODUCTION: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is crucial for dementia diagnosis 
and a pre-requisite for amyloid-lowering therapies in Alzheimer's disease. 
Despite guidelines, many patients never undergo MRI due to limited scanner 
availability. Shorter scan times would reduce costs and patient burden. We 
developed and tested a fast MRI protocol incorporating highly accelerated 
sequences.
METHODS: We compared blinded neuroradiologist assessments of a fast protocol 
with the standard-of-care protocol in a prospective real-world study. We 
estimated agreement coefficients to evaluate reliability.
RESULTS: The fast protocol cut scan times by 63% and showed non-inferior 
reliability measures for diagnosis, visual scale ratings, and disease-modifying 
therapy eligibility assessment. Between scan-type, intra-rater reliability for 
diagnosis was greater than inter-rater reliability on the standard-of-care 
protocol (ratio of 1.37, 95% confidence interval: 1.21-1.58).
DISCUSSION: This study proposed and applied a way of showing non-inferiority of 
a highly accelerated dementia protocol. Ultra-fast protocols could improve MRI 
access and patient equity and support the implementation of disease-modifying 
therapies.
HIGHLIGHTS: The fast dementia protocol with four core sequences reduced 
acquisition time by 63%. The fast scan showed non-inferior reliability for 
diagnosis and visual ratings. Assessment for disease-modifying therapy 
eligibility was similar between scan types. Fast protocols may improve access to 
magnetic resonance imaging and diagnosis in dementia.

OBJECTIVES: Cognitive disorders are common in older persons with seizures (PWS). 
Cognitive disorders are often associated with impaired Instrumental Activities 
of Daily Living (IADLs). However, the effects of seizures on IADLs remain 
unexplored. This study (9/2005-3/2024) from 42 US Alzheimer's Disease Research 
Centers examined baseline and longitudinal IADL decline in cognitively normal 
and cognitively impaired participants grouped as active seizures (past 
12 months), remote seizures (history but none in 12 months), and controls (no 
seizures).
METHODS: Pfeffer Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) measured IADLs. ANOVA 
compared individual and total FAQ by seizure and cognitive status. Multivariable 
linear regression adjusted FAQ for seizure status, age, sex, and education. 
ANOVA compared the rate of longitudinal FAQ decline across seizure groups. Post 
hoc analyses identified group differences.
RESULTS: Among 20,486 cognitively normal participants (average age = 69.7 years, 
female = 65% [N = 13,370]), IADLs were worse among 114 active seizure 
participants (adjusted-mean-difference [95% confidence interval (CI)]: active 
vs. remote = 0.69 (0.23, 1.14), p = 0.0011, active vs. controls = 0.85 (0.46, 
1.24), p < 0.001). Among 30,238 cognitively impaired participants (average 
age = 72.2 years, female = 52% [N = 15,632]), IADLs were worse among 735 active 
seizure participants (adjusted-mean-difference (95% CI): active vs. 
remote = 6.85 (5.59, 8.10), p < 0.001, active vs. controls = 8.93 (8.06, 9.80), 
p < 0.001). Longitudinally, IADLs in cognitively normal adults declined faster 
in active seizure participants than in controls (p = 0.0396). Active seizure 
participants struggled most with managing taxes, traveling, paying bills, and 
remembering appointments.
INTERPRETATION: Active seizures are associated with worse baseline IADLs and a 
faster rate of longitudinal decline in IADLs. These findings highlight the 
significant need to assess IADLs in routine clinical care in older PWS 
regardless of their cognition to identify those needing assistance.

Myelinating oligodendrocytes and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) make up 
half the cells in the central nervous system and are affected by and contribute 
to all neurological diseases. The pathology of myelinating oligodendrocytes is 
fundamentally characterized by myelin disruption and loss, termed demyelination, 
whereas that of OPCs is principally defined by remyelination and repair in the 
form of regeneration of myelinating oligodendrocytes. Demyelination is generally 
associated with white matter diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, although 
oligodendroglial pathology is a major factor in most neuropathologies, including 
Alzheimer's disease, ischaemic injury, and traumatic injury. Oligodendroglial 
changes are often driven by neuroinflammatory factors and involve oxidative 
stress, metabolic malfunction, and excitotoxicity. Understanding the 
complexities of demyelination and remyelination pathogenesis is essential for 
the development of new therapeutic strategies. In this chapter, we summarise the 
key features of demyelination and remyelination, discuss factors underlying a 
remyelination failure, and compare the differences between humans and mice. We 
propose some perspectives on treatment strategies for remyelination in the hope 
that future advances will provide solutions to the challenges associated with 
demyelinating diseases.

Despite the success of fructose as a low-cost food additive, epidemiological 
evidence suggests that high fructose consumption during pregnancy or adolescence 
is associated with disrupted neurodevelopment1-3. An essential step in 
appropriate mammalian neurodevelopment is the phagocytic elimination of newly 
formed neurons by microglia, the resident professional phagocyte of the central 
nervous system4. Whether high fructose consumption in early life affects 
microglial phagocytosis and whether this directly affects neurodevelopment 
remains unknown. Here we show that offspring born to female mice fed a 
high-fructose diet and neonates exposed to high fructose exhibit decreased 
phagocytic activity in vivo. Notably, deletion of the high-affinity fructose 
transporter GLUT5 (also known as SLC2A5) in neonatal microglia completely 
reversed microglia phagocytic dysfunction, suggesting that high fructose 
directly affects neonatal development by suppressing microglial phagocytosis. 
Mechanistically, we found that high-fructose treatment of mouse and human 
microglia suppresses phagocytosis capacity, which is rescued in GLUT5-deficient 
microglia. Additionally, we found that high fructose drives significant 
GLUT5-dependent fructose uptake and catabolism to fructose 6-phosphate, rewiring 
microglial metabolism towards a hypo-phagocytic state in part by enforcing 
mitochondrial localization of the enzyme hexokinase 2. Mice exposed to high 
fructose as neonates develop anxiety-like behaviour as adolescents-an effect 
that is rescued in GLUT5-deficient mice. Our findings provide a mechanistic 
explanation for the epidemiological observation that high-fructose exposure 
during early life is associated with increased prevalence of adolescent anxiety 
disorders.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder featuring 
cognitive impairment with loss of memory, with implications of Amyloid-β plaques 
and hyperphosphorylated tau tangles. Recent studies suggest that ferroptosis, an 
iron-dependent form of cell death characterized by the accumulation of lipid 
peroxides, may play a key role in the molecular and cellular pathways underlying 
neurodegeneration in AD. Dysregulation of iron stability is correlated to 
oxidative pressure and neuronal damage, especially within the hippocampus and 
cortex region, promoting a vicious cycle of neurodegeneration. This review 
focuses on summarizing major recent findings on ferroptosis towards cognitive 
impairment in AD involving major regulatory genes such as HIF1α and GPX4, in 
neuroprotection or as a risk factor of the disease. The predictive power of gene 
expression models based on autopsies and blood samples further highlights the 
importance of ferroptosis-related pathways, such as autophagy, which influences 
iron homeostasis and lipid degradation, and mTOR signaling, which regulates 
oxidative stress responses and cell survival, in shaping AD pathology and 
progression. Moreover, the review sheds light on novel therapeutic strategies 
targeting ferroptosis, such as ferroptosis inhibitors, iron chelation, and 
several antioxidant therapies, which hold promise for alleviating cognitive 
deficits and advance treatment paradigms in AD. Investigating the role of 
ferroptosis in AD may uncover new therapeutic strategies that target the 
interconnected processes of cognitive decline and neurodegeneration.

Sirtuin 2 (SIRT2), a NAD+-dependent deacetylase, has been implicated in aging 
and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). While global 
SIRT2 inhibition has shown promise in reducing amyloid-beta pathology and 
cognitive deficits in different mouse models of AD, peripheral SIRT2 inhibition 
has been associated with adverse effects, such as increased inflammation. This 
suggests that targeted inhibition of specific cellular populations within the 
brain may represent a more precise and effective approach for the treatment of 
AD. To explore this hypothesis, we generated a conditional microglial SIRT2 
knockout mouse model in the context of AD. Our results reveal that microglial 
SIRT2 reduction does not confer protective effects in the APP/PS1 model; rather, 
it aggravates cognitive decline, accelerates amyloid plaque deposition, and 
increases levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines at early stages of AD pathology. 
Transcriptomic analysis further indicates that SIRT2-deficient microglia exhibit 
altered expression of genes associated with aging and synaptic dysfunction. This 
phenotype was accompanied by increased phagocytosis of PSD95 and impaired 
long-term potentiation. These findings suggest that while SIRT2 inhibition in 
some contexts may be beneficial, targeted inhibition within microglia could 
accelerate AD progression, underscoring the need for cell-specific approaches 
when considering SIRT2 as a therapeutic target.

Imagine a world where memories fade, loved ones become strangers, and the sense 
of self dissolves. This is the harsh reality for nearly 50 million people 
worldwide suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive 
neurodegenerative disorder marked by memory loss, cognitive decline, and 
behavioral changes. With global prevalence on the rise, the demand for effective 
therapies is urgent. Yet, despite decades of research, a cure remains out of 
reach, and current treatments offer only temporary relief, failing to address 
the root causes of the disease. AD's complex pathology, including amyloid-β 
plaque accumulation, tau protein tangles, oxidative stress, and neurotransmitter 
deficits, calls for innovative, multitargeted therapeutic approaches. In this 
pursuit, heterocyclic compounds have emerged as promising candidates. These 
molecules, defined by ring structures containing heteroatoms, exhibit broad 
biological activity. Among them, quinoline and indole derivatives have shown 
particular promise for their anti-Alzheimer's potential. This review explores 
the therapeutic relevance of these 2 heterocyclic scaffolds, examining their 
ability to counter key AD hallmarks and highlighting the link between their 
chemical structure and biological efficacy. By analyzing structure-activity 
relationships, we aim to spotlight compounds with the greatest potential to 
advance AD treatment. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Quinoline and indole derivatives 
showed strong dual cholinesterase inhibition and good blood-brain barrier 
permeability. Piperazine- and piperidine-based hybrids improved bioavailability 
and central nervous system penetration. Heterocyclic fusion and bioisosteres 
improved metabolic stability and solubility.

Everyday technologies, like smartphones, might improve care of persons living 
with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (PLWADRD) and reduce burden among 
care partners. However, care partners often report inadequate technical skills 
for using technology-based strategies. To address this need, we developed a 
manualized behavioral intervention called Technology Assistance in Dementia 
(Tech-AiD). We gathered feedback on the intervention concept from invested 
partners (10 care partners and 10 healthcare professionals) in a multimethod 
study. Quantitative results suggested very high intervention acceptability 
(4.55/5), appropriateness (4.36/5), and feasibility (4.11/5). Qualitative 
responses indicated a willingness to participate in Tech-AiD if available, 
described the program as a good fit for the needs of persons living with ADRD 
and care partners, and suggested that Tech-AiD's delivery format was convenient. 
Qualitative responses also included specific suggestions to improve Tech-AiD 
(e.g., creation of a technology helpline, booster sessions). Results provide 
evidence of Tech-AiD's readiness for a pilot trial.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) research worldwide 
indicate that it is more common in Indigenous than in non-Indigenous 
populations. We examined the relationship of depression and diabetes, alone and 
together, with incident ADRD in a large sample of American Indian and Alaska 
Native (AIAN) peoples.
METHODS: We examined a sample of 65,801 AIAN peoples aged ≥ 45 years in fiscal 
year 2007 who were ADRD-free between FY2007-09. Cox proportional hazard models 
were employed to estimate associations between ADRD risk and baseline depression 
and diabetes, adjusting for potential confounding variables.
RESULTS: We found 2.3% received an ADRD diagnosis during FY2010-13. Compared to 
persons with neither depression nor diabetes, the fully adjusted hazard ratio 
(HR) for those aged ≥ 45 years with depression and diabetes was 1.82 (95% CI 
1.53-2.16) for ADRD and those with depression only had a hazard ratio of 1.70 
(95% CI 1.44-2.00). A significant relationship was not found between diabetes 
only and ADRD risk. Compared with women without depression, the adjusted risk of 
ADRD was 50% higher (HR = 1.50, 95% CI 1.30-1.73) for women with depression, 
while 115% higher (HR = 2.15, 95% CI 1.76-2.61) for men with depression.
CONCLUSIONS: Depression is associated with a substantially higher risk of ADRD 
among adult AIAN peoples. This association varies by sex and age, with the 
strongest association observed among relatively young men. Helpful future 
efforts include ensuring clinical and behavioral services for AIAN peoples 
provide regular mental health screening and any needed treatment.

Tirzepatide (TRZ) is a dual agonist of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and 
gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) receptors that were recently approved for 
the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity. Of note is that T2D and 
obesity, by inducing peripheral low-grade inflammation and oxidative stress, 
provoke the development of central neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. 
Together, T2D and obesity are regarded as potential risk factors implicated in 
the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is the most 
common neurodegenerative disease and represents the most typical cause of 
dementia. Hence, targeting low-grade inflammation and oxidative stress in T2D 
and obesity by TRZ may reduce AD neuropathology. In addition, TRZ can inhibit 
the production of amyloid beta (Aβ) and associated neuroinflammation, oxidative 
stress, and neuronal apoptosis. However, the underlying neuroprotective 
mechanism of TRZ against AD is not entirely explained. Consequently, this 
mini-review aims to discuss the possible molecular mechanism of TRZ in AD.

To investigate how dysregulated transient receptor potential canonical channels 
(TRPCs) are associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), we challenged primary 
neurons with amyloid-β (Aβ). Both the naturally secreted or synthetic Aβ 
oligomers (AβOs) induced long-lasting increased TRPC3 and downregulated the 
TRPC6 expression in mature excitatory neurons (CaMKIIα-high) via a 
Ca2+-dependent calcineurin-coupled NFAT transcriptionally and calpain-mediated 
protein degradation, respectively. The TRPC3 expression was also found to be 
upregulated in pyramidal neurons of human AD brains. The selective 
downregulation of the Trpc6 gene induced synaptotoxicity, while no significant 
effect was observed from the Trpc3-targeting siRNA, suggesting potentially 
differential roles of TRPC3 and 6 in modulating the synaptic morphology and 
functions. Electrophysiological recordings of mouse hippocampal slices 
overexpressing TRPC3 revealed increased neuronal hyperactivity upon the TRPC3 
channel activation by its agonist. Furthermore, the AβO-mediated synaptotoxicity 
appeared to be positively correlated with the degrees of the induced dendritic 
Ca2+ flux in neurons, which was completely prevented by the co-treatment with 
two pyrazole-based TRPC3-selective antagonists Pyr3 or Pyr10. Taken together, 
our findings suggest that the aberrantly upregulated TRPC3 is another ion 
channel critically contributing to the process of AβO-induced Ca2+ overload, 
neuronal hyperexcitation, and synaptotoxicity, thus representing a potential 
therapeutic target of AD.

Most approved drugs for Alzheimer's disease (AD) are indicated for early to 
moderate stages and primarily target amyloid-beta or neurotransmitter systems. 
While these treatments may slow cognitive decline, they do not halt disease 
progression and are often limited by high cost and modest efficacy. Natural 
compounds are increasingly being explored as alternative interventions. Our 
previous study showed that oral administration of Avenanthramide-C (Avn-C), a 
natural polyphenol from oats, for 14 days from early AD stages improved 
cognition and reduced neuroinflammation in AD mice. To assess its long-term 
potential, in this study we extended Avn-C treatment to three months starting 
from early disease stages in 5xFAD and Tg2576 models. Sustained administration 
preserved recovered long-term potentiation (LTP) by maintaining AMPK activation 
and inhibiting caspase-3 and GSK3β, thereby reducing amyloid accumulation and 
tau hyperphosphorylation in the hippocampus. Avn-C also maintained 
anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing NF-κB-mediated proinflammatory cytokine 
release and preventing chronic microglial activation. This promoted microglial 
coverage of plaques in vivo and enhanced phagocytosis in vitro. Our findings 
suggest that early and sustained Avn-C treatment preserves cognitive function, 
modulates multiple pathological pathways, and may slow or prevent AD progression 
by targeting early neurodegenerative processes before irreversible damage 
occurs.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the leading causes of death in the elderly 
population. Currently, there is no available therapy that can stop the disease 
progression. Situations are much worse due to a lack of a clear understanding of 
disease pathogenesis and the unavailability of an appropriate biomarker for 
early diagnosis. Higher ceramide levels were strongly linked to an increased 
risk of AD. However, the effect of increased ceramide concentration on the 
spatiotemporal organization and dynamics of neuronal membranes in diseased 
conditions is poorly understood. Based on the lipidomics data, we have modeled 
biologically relevant neuronal model membranes for healthy brain (HB) and 
diseased condition AD brain (ADB). The effects of the increase in ceramides and 
the lowering of sphingomyelin on the overall membrane organization, fluidity, 
stability, and dynamics of membrane microdomains have been investigated through 
extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Healthy neuronal membranes are 
less curved than the ADB. In ADB, cholesterols exhibit a higher local enrichment 
around cholesterol, but its enrichment decreases significantly around ceramide. 
In contrast, ceramides are enriched around themselves in the ADB. Enhancement in 
the ceramide content promotes cholesterol-sphingomyelin-enriched but 
ceramide-deficient microdomains. At the same time, ceramides tend to coalesce 
and form ceramide-enriched microdomains with a significantly longer residence 
time. The AD neuronal membrane has a higher number of highly stable 
ceramide-exclusive microdomains. Ceramide-enriched microdomains are known to 
enhance amyloidogenic processing. The study provides insight into the role of 
ceramides and sphingomyelins in AD disease pathogenesis and enhances the 
potential of lipid-based biomarkers for early detection.

BACKGROUND: Agitation in Alzheimer's dementia has a substantial impact on 
patients, caregivers/family, and healthcare systems. As new evidence surrounding 
the treatment of agitation emerges, a roundtable of multispecialty experts 
convened to review published literature (from a PubMed database search on 1 
October 2024) and provide evidence-based clinical practice consensus 
recommendations for the diagnosis and management of agitation in Alzheimer's 
dementia for US-based primary care providers.
AIM: The main objective of this article is to summarize key recommendations from 
the roundtable on identification, differential diagnosis, current clinical 
practice, nonpharmacologic interventions, pharmacologic interventions, and 
treatment and communication considerations for residential care facilities/home 
care settings and caregivers.
RESULTS: Active communication between healthcare providers, patients, and 
caregivers/family is critical for early recognition, accurate diagnosis, and 
appropriate management and prevention of agitation. The foundation of treatment 
always begins with individualized psychoeducation and nonpharmacologic 
interventions based on the patient's personality, interests, and level of 
functioning. Pharmacologic interventions are strongly considered when agitated 
behaviors become highly intense, disturbing, and disruptive or if major safety 
concerns cannot be otherwise addressed, and only when the healthcare provider is 
confident that the agitation can be sufficiently managed or mitigated with a 
pharmacologic intervention possessing a favorable individual risk-benefit 
profile. While several pharmacologic agents have been studied in high-quality 
clinical trials for the treatment of agitation in Alzheimer's dementia, 
brexpiprazole is the only US Food and Drug Administration - approved treatment 
and it can be prescribed if warranted. Interventions should be continuously 
evaluated to optimize treatment and monitor and minimize potential side effects. 
A patient-centered approach that includes a strong partnership with 
caregivers/family as a vital part of the patient's larger care team is 
encouraged.
CONCLUSION: Following these recommendations for timely detection, accurate 
diagnosis, and appropriate management of agitation in patients with Alzheimer's 
dementia is likely to improve outcomes for most patients and caregivers.

BACKGROUND: Residual immune activation is common in people living with HIV (PWH) 
despite antiretroviral therapy (ART) and may be associated with HIV-specific, as 
well as lifestyle-related factors.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate markers of immune activation and neuronal 
injury in PWH on ART compared with controls with similar lifestyle.
METHODS: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood were collected from 50 men who have 
sex with men (MSM) with HIV on ART, 50 HIV-negative MSM on preexposure 
prophylaxis (PrEP), and 25 HIV-negative controls without PrEP. β2-microglobulin, 
neopterin, and neurofilament light protein (NfL) were analyzed. Cytomegalovirus 
and herpes simplex virus-2 serostatus, as well as sexually transmitted bacterial 
infections were registered.
RESULTS: Serum and CSF β2-microglobulin and neopterin did not differ 
significantly between MSM with HIV and MSM on PrEP. However, both groups had 
significantly higher serum levels of β2-microglobulin and neopterin compared 
with HIV-negative controls without PrEP. Age-adjusted CSF NfL levels were also 
similar in MSM with HIV and MSM on PrEP, but higher than in controls without 
PrEP. A recent syphilis infection was associated with increased immune 
activation in CSF and blood.
CONCLUSION: Increased levels of immune activation and neuronal injury markers 
were found in virologically suppressed MSM with HIV and MSM on PrEP compared 
with controls. These findings imply that other factors than HIV contribute to 
the residual immune activation and impact on neurons observed in MSM with HIV on 
ART, and emphasize the importance of appropriate controls with similar lifestyle 
in studies of biomarkers in PWH.

BACKGROUND: Several amyloid targeting therapies have been approved for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), including lecanemab (Leqembi). However, real-world 
implementation of these drugs has uncovered significant challenges.
METHODS: We conducted a national cross-sectional survey of healthcare 
professionals from multiple disciplines participating in the Veteran's Health 
Administration (VHA) AD Therapeutics Community of Practice. The goal of the 
survey was to identify facilitators and barriers to the implementation of 
lecanemab within their respective medical centers. The web-based survey was open 
from September 17, 2024 to October 4, 2024.
RESULTS: Surveys were sent to 128 healthcare team members with 44 responders 
(34% response rate). Of the responders, the majority were physicians (59%, 
n = 26) or pharmacists (25%, n = 11). In all, 41% indicated that they were 
currently administering lecanemab (n = 18), 32% were planning on administering 
lecanemab (n = 14), 20% were unsure if they would be administering lecanemab 
(n = 9), and 7% did not plan on offering the medication (n = 3). The five most 
common facilitators to implementation of lecanemab included pharmacist support 
(57%, n = 25), infusion center access and support (57%, n = 25), having a 
program champion (43%, n = 19), collaboration with other VHA medical centers 
implementing lecanemab (43%, n = 19), and access to advanced imaging such as 
amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) scans (43%, n = 19). The most common 
barrier to implementation of lecanemab identified by 45% of participants 
(n = 20) was lack of staff to monitor treatment. Other common barriers included 
challenges with stakeholder engagement (27%, n = 12), issues with identifying 
patients who qualify for lecanemab (27%, n = 12), lack of access to advanced 
imaging (25%, n = 11), and lack of neuroradiology support (23%, n = 10).
CONCLUSIONS: Attention to identified facilitators and barriers may be helpful 
for facilities implementing amyloid targeting therapy for AD.

Indocyanine green (ICG) is a small molecule approved by the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) for liver function imaging and angiography. ICG can be used 
not only for near-infrared imaging but also for photodynamic and photothermal 
therapy. However, the hydrophilicity of ICG leads to a relatively short blood 
circulation time, and it is easily cleared by organs such as the liver. 
Moreover, it lacks the targeting ability to the diseased sites. By using the 
natural porous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as the carrier, high-efficiency 
loading of ICG molecule can be achieved, which has significantly broadened its 
biomedical applications. This review comprehensively summarizes the research 
work in recent years regarding the utilization of MOF as a carrier to load ICG 
in the bioapplication such as malignant cancer inhibition, antibacterial 
treatment, and the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. It focuses on summarizing 
the design concepts of different types of MOF carriers for loading ICG 
molecules. Meanwhile, it emphasizes the enhanced therapeutic effects achieved 
when multiple treatment modalities realized through post-modification are 
combined with ICG-mediated phototherapy. It is expected that through the summary 
of this review, the biomedical applications of ICG in the field of disease 
treatment can be further promoted.

BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment is a decline in people's ability to think, 
learn, and remember, which has some impact on an individual's daily activities 
or social functioning. Microbial toxins and metabolites from dysregulated gut 
microbiota directly interact with the intestinal epithelium. This interaction 
triggers neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in the central nervous system, 
ultimately impairing cognitive function. It has been found that modulation of 
gut flora can be an effective intervention to improve cognitive dysfunction. 
This study is the first to summarize and outline the global research status and 
trends in this field from a bibliometric perspective, providing reference and 
guidance for future research in this field.
METHODS: Based on the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database, 
Literature on gut flora and cognitive impairment published between 1999-2025 was 
searched. Bibliometric analysis was performed using VOSviewer and CiteSpace 
software to analyze the data on countries, institutions, authors, journals, 
keywords, citations, and to generate visual maps.
RESULTS: A total of 1,702 pieces of related literature were retrieved. The 
overall trend of publication is increasing. China has published the largest 
number of papers, and Huazhong University of Science & Technology and Kim, 
Dong-Hyun were the institutions and individuals with more publications. The most 
frequently cited journal is SCI REP-UK. The most frequent keywords are gut 
microbiota, followed by Alzheimer's disease, cognitive impairment, Brain, 
oxidative stress and Inflammation.
CONCLUSION: In recent years, the research application of gut flora in the 
treatment of cognitive impairment has made remarkable progress. Oxidative stress 
and inflammatory response have become the main research hotspots for gut flora 
to improve cognitive impairment in patients. The gut-brain axis plays an 
important role in the study of the mechanism of action. Short-chain fatty acids 
are the focus of research on gut microbial metabolism. Fecal microbial 
transplantation technology is increasingly being used as an emerging method for 
the application of intestinal flora. Modifying the gut flora by modifying diet 
and exercise may be an effective strategy to prevent and improve cognitive 
dysfunction in the future. Future studies may focus more on gender differences 
in the role of gut flora in the modulation of cognitive function.

BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization highlighted the potential protective 
role of exercise against cognitive decline, all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), and vascular dementia in healthy individuals. We have previously 
shown that exercise is particularly beneficial for older, cognitively unimpaired 
apolipoprotein E4 (APOE ε4) carriers. A key unanswered question is whether a 
long-term, high-intensity aerobic exercise intervention initiated in a cohort of 
previously inactive older individuals at genetic risk for AD has neuroprotective 
properties.
DESIGN: CYCLE-AD is a randomized, single-blind, single-center, controlled trial 
of a home-based, high-intensity exercise intervention involving 150 older ε4 
carriers (ages 65-80 years) who are healthy, cognitively unimpaired, and 
physically inactive. Participants are randomized into two groups: indoor cycling 
(IC) or usual and customary care (UCC) (target of 75 each). IC participants 
exercise 3×/week on an upright stationary cycle ergometer at a moderate-vigorous 
intensity for 18 months. Those in the UCC group are expected to maintain 
enrollment levels of activity.
OUTCOMES: Comparison of IC and UCC groups on change in primary and secondary 
outcomes over baseline, 9-month, and 18-month evaluations. Primary outcomes are 
VO2peak (Fitness), 5-trial total recall on the Rey Auditory Verbal List Learning 
Test (Episodic Memory), and total hippocampal volume derived from structural MRI 
(Brain Atrophy). Secondary outcomes include comprehensive neurocognitive and 
physical function test batteries, MRI scans including structural and functional 
connectivity measures, and blood-based biomarkers.
HYPOTHESES: Over an 18-month interval, physically inactive ε4 carriers who 
engage in high-intensity aerobic exercise will demonstrate less cognitive 
decline and hippocampal atrophy than physically inactive ε4 carriers who did not 
participate in a formal exercise program.
CONCLUSION: Successful demonstration of a scalable, home-based, high-intensity 
aerobic exercise intervention in altering the trajectory of AD pathophysiology 
and its effects on cognitive functioning will transform AD treatment, improve 
patient outcomes and quality of life, and reduce healthcare costs.

BACKGROUND: Clinical trials targeting preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
require accurate cognitive assessments to detect subtle changes over time. Audio 
review of assessment sessions has been proposed as a quality assurance (QA) and 
control (QC) measure, yet evidence regarding its effectiveness remains limited.
OBJECTIVE: We aim to investigate how audio review contributes to the QA/QC 
process.
METHODS: In the Japanese Trial-Ready Cohort (J-TRC) onsite study, 194 
Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite (PACC) sessions were audio-recorded 
and independently reviewed. Examiners were certified psychometrists who had 
undergone pre-training. Audio reviewers issued "queries" for scoring deviations 
warranting score amendments and "comments" for procedural deviations or 
recommended improvements. Mixed-effects models analyzed associations between the 
number of queries/comments and (1) cumulative PACC examination experience and 
(2) cumulative received feedback for individual examiners.
RESULTS: Of 194 reviewed sessions, 63.4% contained at least one query, and 84.5% 
included one or more comments. A higher cumulative number of PACC sessions by 
each examiner was associated with fewer queries and smaller score changes over 
time. Notably, the cumulative number of feedback reports was significantly 
associated with a lower number of comments, suggesting targeted feedback helped 
refine examiners' testing manner. However, cumulative feedback was not clearly 
linked to the frequency of scoring deviations (queries).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that audio review can serve as an effective 
QA/QC measure by reducing non-adherence to assessment standards.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the first cause of dementia worldwide 
without any current curative treatment. Facing an increasing prevalence and its 
associated costs, AD represents a public health challenge. Usual diagnostic 
methods still rely on extended interviews and paper tests provided by an 
exterior examiner. We aim to create a novel, quick cognitive-screening tool on a 
numerical tablet.
METHODS: This pilot program, built and edited with Unity®, runs on Android® for 
the Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 FE®. Composed of seven tasks inspired by the 
Mini-Mental Status Examination and the Montréal Cognitive Assessment, it browses 
several cognitive functions. The architectural design of this tablet application 
is distinguished by its multifaceted capabilities, encompassing not only 
seamless offline functionality but also a mechanism to ensure the singularity of 
data amalgamated from diverse sites. Additionally, a paramount emphasis is 
placed on safeguarding the confidentiality of patient information in the 
healthcare domain. Furthermore, the application empowers individual site 
managers to access and peruse specific datasets, enhancing their operational 
efficacy and decision-making processes. We performed a preliminary usability 
assessment among young, healthy subjects.
RESULTS: Twenty-four participants were included with a final F-SUS 'excellent' 
score. Participants perceived the tool as simple to use and achieved the test in 
a mean time of 142 s. No technical errors occurred.
CONCLUSION: These preliminary results suggest that our new assessment on a 
numerical tablet might be usable and acceptable for a short cognitive screening 
but requires further studies among older populations.

PURPOSE: The Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) Gene Curation Expert Panels have 
historically focused on specific organ systems or phenotypes; thus, the ClinGen 
Syndromic Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel (SD-GCEP) was formed to address 
an unmet need.
METHODS: The SD-GCEP applied ClinGen's framework to evaluate the clinical 
validity of genes associated with rare syndromic disorders. A total of 111 
gene-disease relationships (GDRs) associated with 100 genes spanning the 
clinical spectrum of syndromic disorders were curated.
RESULTS: From April 2020 through March 2024, 38 precurations were performed on 
genes with multiple disease relationships and were reviewed to determine if the 
disorders were part of a spectrum or distinct entities. A total of 14 genes were 
lumped into a single disease entity, and 24 were split into separate entities, 
of which 11 were curated by the SD-GCEP. A full review of 111 GDRs for 100 genes 
followed, with 78 classified as Definitive, 9 as Strong, 15 as Moderate, and 9 
as Limited, highlighting cases in which further data are needed. All diseases 
involved 2 or more organ systems, whereas the majority (88/111 GDRs, 79.2%) had 
5 or more organ systems affected.
CONCLUSION: The SD-GCEP addresses a critical gap in gene curation efforts, 
enabling inclusion of genes for syndromic disorders in clinical testing and 
contributing to keeping pace with the rapid discovery of new genetic syndromes.

BACKGROUND: The rapid aging of the population in China has led to a significant 
increase in the incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This escalating trend has 
resulted in a substantial economic burden, posing a formidable challenge to 
society.
METHODS: The study population comprised inpatients with AD in Hubei Province 
from January 2019 to December 2021. Comprehensive patient information was 
extracted from the provincial inpatient electronic system database. The data 
collected included age, gender, occupation, insurance type, method of hospital 
admission, diagnosis, length of stay (LOS), total medical expenses (TME), and 
discharge condition. Multiple linear regression analysis was employed to 
identify and analyze the factors influencing LOS and TME among AD patients.
RESULTS: The study encompassed a total of 22,301 AD patients. The mean age of 
the patients was 79.58 ± 10.12 years, with over 90% of the AD patients being 
65 years or older. Male patients constituted 49.94% of the study population. The 
average LOS was determined to be 19.35 days. The mean TME per patient was 
calculated at US$2,593.38. A positive correlation was observed between medical 
expenses and patient age. Notably, the medical expenses for patients aged 
85 years and above were 2.14 times higher than those for patients under 
65 years. Of the total expenses, 57.04% were allocated to medication and service 
fees. Regarding comorbidities, infections, fractures, and cardiovascular 
diseases were identified as the top three cost drivers for AD inpatient 
hospitalization.
CONCLUSION: Age and insurance type were identified as key determinants of both 
LOS and TME. To address these issues, strategies should be implemented to expand 
medical insurance coverage and enhance daily care for AD patients. Furthermore, 
it is crucial to prioritize the prevention of infections, fractures, and 
cardiovascular diseases among AD patients. The implementation of comprehensive 
health policies focusing on drug pricing, diagnostic procedures, and service 
costs is essential to mitigate the economic burden associated with AD.

BACKGROUND: Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal syndrome (CBS) 
are neurodegenerative disorders with disabling postural instability, falls and 
cognitive impairment associated with 4-repeat tau protein neuropathology. The 
low prevalence (6/100,000 inhabitants) is estimated with data only from North 
American, European countries or Japan.
OBJECTIVE: A multicenter initiative for studying the epidemiology and tau 
biology of Argentinean patients with PSP and CBS and their ovelaps, Consorcio 
Argentino de Investigación Traslacional en Tauopatias Primarias (CAITauP).
METHODS: A prospective observational cohort of people with PSP (PwPSP), CBS and 
PSP/CBS overlaps will be longitudinally studied aiming at recruitment of 75 
patients in 3 years. Deep clinical phenotyping, neurocognitive testing every 
12 months, and biosamples collection at baseline are planned. Disease severity 
will be assessed every 6 months and history of environmental exposures will be 
assessed at baseline.
RESULTS: 33/75 expected patients with PSP (19) and CBS (14) have been enrolled. 
Female gender is 56%, mean age 76, with estimated disease duration of 
4.73 years. More than 60% of enrolled patients have completed first visit and 
biosamples collection, one patient underwent brain donation, pathological 
diagnosis of PSP, clinical Richardson syndrome. Environmental exposures of a 
preliminary subsample are reported.
CONCLUSIONS: The CAITauP enrolled a cohort of Argentinean PwPSP for deep 
clinical phenotyping and biobanking. Despite the rarity of PSP/CBS, we highlight 
the feasibility of establishing local cohorts in developing countries for 
translational research. The consortium aims to address underrepresented groups 
of Argentinean to improve diagnosis, treatment, and to create trial-ready 
cohorts.

The role of the oral microbiome, host response, and periodontal disease 
treatment in Alzheimer's disease: A primer.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of cognitive 
impairment and dementia in elderly patients worldwide. There is increasing 
evidence that periodontal disease may have an important role in the complex, 
multifactorial pathogenesis of AD.
AIM: This narrative review aims to (1) highlight the current understanding of 
the role of periodontal disease in AD, including molecular and immunological 
evidence, epidemiological studies, and biological mechanisms linking periodontal 
disease to AD; and (2) explore the potential impact of periodontal therapy as 
part of an individualized, multitherapeutic approach to AD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature search of the PubMed database was conducted 
using Boolean search strategies to identify publications related to the 
potential connections between periodontal disease and AD.
RESULTS: Most of the evidence for a link between periodontal disease and AD is 
limited to preclinical research and epidemiological investigations. A direct 
causal link has not yet been demonstrated in human clinical studies, but 
periodontal pathogenic bacteria have been detected in brain tissue and 
cerebrospinal fluid of patients with AD. Further, colocalization of gingipain 
proteases secreted by Porphyromonas gingivalis has been found in AD pathological 
lesions. Epidemiological studies support associations between periodontal 
disease and increased risk/prevalence of cognitive decline, AD, and AD 
mortality. Two mechanistic theories have been proposed to explain the connection 
between periodontitis and AD: the "microbial involvement" theory focuses on 
periodontal disease-associated pathogenic bacteria, whereas the "inflammatory 
cascade" theory focuses on proinflammatory mediators as drivers of 
neuroinflammation that may exacerbate pathologic lesions associated with AD. 
Preclinical studies of periodontal therapies targeting oral microbiota or their 
byproducts have investigated small-molecule gingipain inhibitors and novel 
therapeutics that restore oral microbial homeostasis (e.g., probiotic 
bacteriocin nisin). In animal models, gingipain inhibitors and nisin showed 
inhibitory effects on formation of pathological lesions of AD or 
neuroinflammation and microbiome changes, respectively; however, no impact on 
cognition was found with use of gingipain inhibitors in patients with 
mild-to-moderate AD.
CONCLUSIONS: Additional studies are needed to better understand the potential 
causal relationship between periodontal disease and AD, including further 
exploration of therapies targeting the oral-brain axis.

INTRODUCTION: Understanding the neurometabolic changes associated with amyloid-β 
(Aβ) deposition is important for early Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis, but 
their spatial relationships remained unexplored due to technical limitations.
METHODS: We investigated the relationship between Aβ deposition and neuronal and 
glial metabolites using high-resolution 3D magnetic resonance spectroscopic 
imaging (MRSI) (8-min scan, 2 × 3 × 3 mm3 resolution) and Aβ-positron emission 
tomography (Aβ-PET) imaging. N-acetylaspartate, myo-inositol, and creatine maps 
were obtained from 174 participants: 39 controls, 65 mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI), and 70 AD patients.
RESULTS: N-Acetylaspartate levels were negatively correlated with Aβ, while 
myo-inositol levels were positively correlated globally. Regional associations 
with Aβ include N-acetylaspartate reductions in frontal cortex, anterior 
cingulate cortex, and precuneus, and myo-inositol increases in precuneus, 
lateral temporal, and lateral parietal cortices. Combined MRSI and PET 
biomarkers achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy for MCI and AD .
DISCUSSION: Hybrid high-resolution 3D MRSI and Aβ-PET imaging provides valuable 
insights into Aβ's impact on neurometabolic changes, improving early AD 
diagnosis.
HIGHLIGHTS: Hybrid 3D magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging-positron emission 
tomography (MRSI-PET) imaging reveals Aβ deposition impact on neurometabolism in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). N-acetylaspartate (NAA) as a neuronal metabolic marker 
is negatively associated with Aβ globally and locally. Myo-inositol (mI) as a 
glial metabolic marker is positively associated with Aβ globally and locally. 
Combining 3D magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) and PET biomarkers 
improves diagnostic accuracy for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD.

INTRODUCTION: Neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia (NPS) collectively refer to 
behavioral and psychological symptoms affecting individuals with mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's disease or related dementia (ADRD). NPS are 
among the most troubling aspects of living with dementia but their treatments 
have limited efficacy. We aim to investigate genetic variants contributing to 
NPS to identify new therapeutic targets.
METHODS: We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for nine NPS 
domains measured by the Neuropsychiatric Symptom Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) 
in 12,800 participants from Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers across the 
United States. We performed a replication analysis in two independent cohorts.
RESULTS: We found genome-wide significant signals for agitation, anxiety, 
apathy, delusions, and hallucinations that were driven by the apolipoprotein E 
(APOE) ε4 allele. We replicated these findings in ADNI and BioVU cohorts. 
Mediation analyses revealed that, except for apathy, MCI/ADRD severity only 
partially mediated the GWAS signals.
DISCUSSION: These findings suggest the APOE ε4 allele influences several NPS 
independently of and beyond its effect on ADRD.
HIGHLIGHTS: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are common in mild cognitive 
impairment and dementia. Effective NPS treatments are pressingly needed, and 
genetic studies can inform treatment targets to develop effective therapeutics. 
We conducted a genome-wide association study of NPS in over 12,800 individuals 
and a replication analysis in two independent cohorts. We found apolipoprotein E 
(APOE) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with multiple NPS 
domains beyond their effects on cognitive impairment.

are reliable predictors of future AD risk. We investigated whether pre-clinical 
changes in AD CSF biomarkers are reflected in blood DNA methylation (DNAm) 
levels in cognitively normal participants.
METHODS: We profiled blood-based DNAm with the EPIC array in participants 
without a diagnosis of cognitive impairment in the Emory Healthy Brain Study 
(EHBS; N = 495), Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (N = 122), and 
Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (N = 118) cohorts. Their CSF amyloid 
beta 42, total tau (t-tau), and phosphorylated tau181 levels were quantified 
using Elecsys immunoassays. We conducted epigenome-wide association studies to 
assess associations between DNAm and CSF biomarkers of AD.
RESULTS: In EHBS, no loci were Bonferroni significant after adjusting for 
confounding factors. In the meta-analysis of all three cohorts, DNAm in 
cg22976567 (LMNA) was significantly associated with higher CSF t-tau levels.
DISCUSSION: Our study showed little evidence of an association between 
differential blood-based DNAm and pre-clinical AD CSF biomarkers.
HIGHLIGHTS: We conducted one of the largest (n = 735) blood DNA methylation 
(DNAm) studies of Alzheimer's disease cerebrospinal fluid (AD CSF) biomarkers. 
This is the first epigenome-wide association study in cognitively normal 
participants examining AD CSF biomarkers. Limited associations between blood 
DNAm and AD CSF biomarkers were identified.

Protein misfolding and conformational instability drive protein conformational 
disorders, causing either accelerated degradation and loss-of-function, as in 
inherited metabolic disorders like lysosomal storage disorders, or toxic 
aggregation and gain-of-function, as in neurodegenerative diseases like 
Alzheimer's disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Classical homocystinuria 
(HCU), an inborn error of sulfur amino acid metabolism, results from 
cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency. CBS regulates methionine 
conversion into metabolites critical for redox balance (cysteine, glutathione) 
and signaling (H2S). Pathogenic missense mutations in the CBS gene often impair 
folding, cofactor binding, stability or oligomerization rather than targeting 
the key catalytic residues of the CBS enzyme. Advances in understanding of CBS 
folding and assembly as well as CBS interactions with cellular proteostasis 
network offer potential for therapies using pharmacological chaperones (PCs), 
i.e., compounds facilitating proper folding, assembly or cellular trafficking. 
This review discusses progress in identifying PCs for HCU, including chemical 
chaperones, cofactors, and proteasome inhibitors. We outline future directions, 
focusing on high-throughput screening and structure-based drug design to develop 
CBS-specific PCs. These could stabilize mutant CBS, enhance its stability and 
restore activity, providing new treatments for HCU and possibly other conditions 
related to dysregulated CBS, such as cancer or Down's syndrome.

AIMS: Lecanemab, an Alzheimer's disease US Food and Drug Administration-approved 
monoclonal antibody, was previously reported to have a high affinity against 
intermediately sized amyloid-β aggregates. Subsequently, it was observed by 
immunogold labelling that lecanemab can also bind to human type I amyloid-β 
fibrils. To determine whether lecanemab binds to amyloid-β fibril structures 
other than type I, we analysed its binding capacity to various structurally 
defined and pathologically relevant amyloid-β fibrils.
METHODS: We performed immunogold labelling with lecanemab on extracted amyloid-β 
fibril preparations from six different Alzheimer´s disease mouse models whose 
structures were previously solved by cryo-EM and quantified the relative binding 
affinities of lecanemab to the different fibril polymorphs.
RESULTS: Our results show that lecanemab exhibits high binding affinity to 
amyloid-β fibril structures that have a flexible N-terminus in common, as is the 
case for type I, type II and murine type III amyloid-β fibril polymorphs, which 
resemble or are identical to human structures observed in sporadic and familial 
cases of Alzheimer's disease, including a case with the Arctic (E22G) mutation. 
In contrast, only weak lecanemab binding was observed for murine amyloid-β 
fibrils with a fixed and ordered N-terminus.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings may also explain the low incidence of ARIA-E with 
lecanemab in clinical trials. This is because human meningeal amyloid-β fibrils 
derived from cerebral amyloid angiopathy affected brain tissue also contain a 
fixed and ordered N-terminus, most likely preventing lecanemab binding.
SUMMARY: Lecanemab binds to Aβ fibrils from several Alzheimer's disease tg-mice 
whose structures resemble the type I, type II and Arctic folds found in 
Alzheimer's patients, all of which share a flexible, unstructured N-terminus. 
Lecanemab is therefore expected to be active against all common familial and 
sporadic Alzheimer's cases containing these folds. Lecanemab binding ability is 
unaffected by and tolerates the Arctic E22G mutation, at least in type I or 
Arctic folds. Only weak, if any, lecanemab binding was observed to Aβ fibrils 
derived from tg-SwDI mice, whose structures DI1, DI2 and DI3 all share 
structured and fixed N-termini. Since the fixed N-termini of tg-SwDI DI1 fibrils 
and human meningeal Aβ40 fibrils derived from CAA-affected brain are identical, 
most likely preventing lecanemab binding, treatment with lecanemab may be less 
effective or ineffective against CAA, but may explain the reported beneficial 
low ARIA-E frequency with this antibody.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to examine association patterns of white matter 
hyperintensities (WMH) with neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in men versus women.
METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of data acquired from the 
National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center database. Cognitively unimpaired 
participants aged ≥ 50 years with data on WMH severity were studied. Using 
Cardiovascular Health Study scores, WMH were coded as no to mild (score: 0-4), 
moderate (score: 5-6) or extensive (score: 7-8). NPS were quantified on the 
Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire. For the purposes of the main analysis, 
participants were dichotomized for presence of each NPS (0: absent; 1: present). 
Adjusted binary logistic regression models estimated the odds of having each of 
12 NPS by sex-WMH status. To confirm the validity of our findings, the 
correlations between NPS severity and WMH burden were also separately explored 
in men and women.
RESULTS: Among 4617 participants with normal cognition, there were 1502 men and 
2685 women with no to mild WMH changes, 102 men and 274 women with moderate WMH 
changes and 19 men and 35 women with extensive WMH changes. Greater WMH burden 
(especially extensive changes) was related to increased odds of lability 
symptoms (agitation, disinhibition, irritability) and apathy in men but not 
women. Elation and appetite disorders followed the same trend but failed to 
achieve statistical significance. The exploratory analysis revealed positive 
correlations between these symptoms' severity with WMH burden in men but not in 
women.
CONCLUSIONS: WMH burden was differentially associated with NPS in older men 
versus women with normal cognition.

Cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) affects a significant proportion of 
cancer patients and survivors, impacting their memory, focus, mood, and quality 
of life. While non-pharmacological interventions have shown effectiveness in 
managing this condition, some studies have also explored various pharmacological 
agents, including donepezil, a reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. This 
compound demonstrated beneficial effects on cognition in Alzheimer's disease; 
however, its effectiveness in CRCI remains unknown. This systematic review and 
meta-analysis aims to evaluate the efficacy of donepezil in improving cognitive 
outcomes in cancer patients. We conducted a search of PubMed/Medline, Embase, 
Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the International Clinical Trials 
Registry Platform. Both randomized controlled trials and observational studies 
were included. We extracted data on cognitive outcomes of donepezil treatment, 
including the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R), Trail Making Test 
(TMT), and Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWA), as well as reported 
adverse events (AEs). Out of 896 identified records, nine studies involving 837 
patients met the inclusion criteria, including five RCTs and four observational 
studies. Donepezil failed to demonstrate significant improvements in cognitive 
outcomes in HVLT-R, TMT, and COWA. Fatigue, measured as a secondary outcome, 
also showed no significant improvement. AEs, such as insomnia and headache, were 
more prevalent in adults than children. Donepezil did not increase the risk of 
AEs compared to placebo. This meta-analysis found that donepezil does not 
provide cognitive improvements for CRCI patients. Given the complex and 
multifactorial nature of CRCI, the lack of efficacy suggests that donepezil may 
not address the underlying mechanisms of the condition.

BACKGROUND: The apolipoprotein ε4 allele (APOE4) is associated with decreased 
longevity and increased vulnerability to age-related declines and disorders 
across multiple systems. Interventions that promote healthspan and lifespan 
represent a promising strategy to attenuate the development of APOE4-associated 
aging phenotypes. Here, we studied the ability of the longevity-promoting 
intervention 17α-estradiol (17αE2) to protect against impairments in APOE4 
versus the predominant APOE3 genotype using early middle-aged mice with knock-in 
of human APOE alleles.
METHODS: Beginning at age 10 months, male APOE3 or APOE4 mice were treated for 
20 weeks with 17αE2 or vehicle then compared body-wide for indices of 
middle-aged phenotypes.
RESULTS: Across peripheral and neural measures, APOE4 associates with poorer 
outcomes. Notably, 17αE2 treatment generally improves outcomes in a 
genotype-dependent manner, favoring APOE4 mice, including reductions in body 
weight, plasma leptin, hepatic steatosis, learning and memory, and oxidative 
damage in the brain. Plasma lipidomics and microglial transcriptomics show 
reductions in genotype-specific differences with 17αE2 treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that APOE4 promotes systemic and neural 
aging phenotypes linked to AD and that 17αE2-mediated healthspan actions show a 
positive APOE4 bias. Collectively, the findings suggest that longevity-promoting 
interventions may be useful in mitigating deleterious age-related risks 
associated with the APOE4 genotype.

Plain Language Summary: People with a particular sequence in a part of their DNA 
called APOE (named APOE4) are more likely to have a reduced lifespan and have a 
higher risk of developing some age-related disorders, including Alzheimer’s 
disease. We tested whether a drug that extends lifespan and healthy aging in 
mice, called 17α-estradiol (17αE2), reduces the aging effects of APOE4. We 
compared male mice with different APOE sequences for 20 weeks during early 
middle age. As expected, we found that mice with the APOE4 sequence showed more 
signs of aging, but that 17αE2 improved several health-related measures, often 
with a bigger effect in mice with APOE4. These results suggest that treatments 
that promote healthy aging may be especially helpful for people with APOE4, 
potentially reducing their risk for age-related diseases such as Alzheimer’s 
disease.

BACKGROUND: Blood tests for the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are 
emerging as alternative to amyloid PET scans and analysis of cerebrospinal 
fluid. (CSF). However, their economic value, which depends on test accuracy as 
well as effect on clinical decision-making, remains unclear.
METHODS: We use a Markov model to estimate the value-based price of a blood test 
with sensitivity of 88 % and specificity of 89 %, if labeled for triage and 
confirmation of the AD pathology in primary and specialty care. The value-based 
price was defined as price of the test, at which overall diagnostic cost per 
true positive case of early-stage AD would equate that under standard of care 
(identification in primary care and referral to specialty care based on the 
results of a brief cognitive test). Assumptions for the effect of test use on 
clinical decisions came from a structured expert consultation process.
RESULTS: If used in primary care, the value-based price would be $290 for a 
triage and $1150 for a confirmatory test, respectively, as use of PET or CSF 
testing would decline by 47 % and 86 %, respectively. If used in specialty care, 
i.e., after confirmation of early-stage cognitive impairment, the overall number 
of blood tests would decline. Consequently, the value-based price would increase 
to $450 for a triage test and $1950 for a confirmatory test.
CONCLUSIONS: The results project substantial cost savings from implementing a 
blood test for AD pathology within the diagnostic pathway based on modeling 
results, which future research should confirm with actual data.

BACKGROUND: Higher fitness levels have been reported to protect against 
Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). However, the association 
between changes in fitness over time and ADRD risk remains unknown. This study 
aims to identify clusters of metabolic equivalents (METs) trajectories and 
examine their correlation with incident ADRD.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted among Veterans with ≥3 
standardized exercise treadmill tests (ETT) between 2000 and 2017. The exposure 
was change in fitness expressed in metabolic equivalents (METs). METs are based 
on treadmill speed, grade, and time. One MET is equivalent to 3.5 ml per kg of 
body weight per minute. The outcome was incident ADRD after the final ETT test, 
identified by diagnosis codes. Standardized METs scores were generated using 
mean and standard deviation for each age and sex stratum. Latent class growth 
analysis (LCGA) identified trajectory clusters. We assessed the association 
between clusters and ADRD using unadjusted Kaplan-Meier curves (overall and by 
age groups) and a multivariate Cox regression model adjusted for baseline 
characteristics at the first ETT.
RESULTS: A total of 75,851 veterans were included. The average number of ETTs 
was 4.0 ± 1.8, with the average time gap of 6.5 ± 3.8 years between first and 
last test. We identified five trajectory clusters: Group 1 (n = 22,485), Group 2 
(n = 22,694), Group 3 (n = 6691), Group 4 (n = 19,386), and Group 5 (n = 4595). 
All groups, except for Group 3, showed a stable and slight improvement or 
decline over time, differing only in their initial standardized METs scores: 
Group 5 had the highest initial score, Group 1 had the lowest initial score, 
while Group 3 started out with a score almost as high as Group 4 and dropped to 
as low as Group 1. Compared to Group 1, Group 3 had a 12 % reduced risk of 
developing ADRD (HR = 0.88; 95 % CI: 0.77 - 1.01; p = 0.0660), with a greater 
reduction than Group 2 (10 %) but less than Group 4 (17 %) or Group 5 (24 %).
DISCUSSION: Our findings underscore the potential benefits of maintaining 
fitness to reduce the risk of ADRD with age. Although declining fitness levels 
are associated with an increased risk, the initial higher baseline fitness 
provides a degree of ongoing protection against ADRD.

BackgroundAlzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
that significantly impairs cognitive function, emotional health, and daily 
living activities. Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) is a 
multidisciplinary approach designed to optimize health outcomes in older adults, 
but its effectiveness in managing AD remains to be fully elucidated.ObjectiveTo 
evaluate the impact of CGA intervention on serum S100β levels and clinical 
outcomes in patients with AD.MethodsIn this prospective study, 120 patients 
diagnosed with AD were randomly assigned to either a Control group or an 
Intervention group. The Control group received standard treatment and routine 
care, while the Intervention group received individualized care plans based on 
CGA in addition to standard management. Primary outcomes included serum S100β 
levels, Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog), 
Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire (NPI-Q), Geriatric Depression Scale 
(GDS) scores, Mini-Nutritional Assessment (MNA) scores, Activities of Daily 
Living (ADLs), Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs), and Parkinson's 
Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) scores, assessed at baseline and during 
follow-up.ResultsSerum S100β levels remained stable in the Control group but 
significantly decreased in the Intervention group at 6 months. ADLs and IADLs 
scores were consistently higher in the Intervention group. Although ADAS-Cog and 
NPI-Q scores improved in both groups, the Intervention group demonstrated 
significantly lower NPI-Q scores at 6 months.ConclusionsCGA intervention 
effectively enhances cognitive function, emotional well-being, mobility, and 
social interaction in patients with AD.

In this review, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the role of natural 
peptides-particularly those derived from amphibian skin secretions-as 
multitarget-directed ligands (MTDLs) in the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Given the multifactorial nature of AD, where cholinergic dysfunction intersects 
with amyloid-β aggregation, tau hyperphosphorylation, oxidative stress, metal 
ion imbalance, and monoamine oxidase dysregulation, therapeutic strategies 
capable of modulating several pathological pathways simultaneously are urgently 
needed. We begin by revisiting the cholinergic hypothesis and its molecular and 
structural underpinnings, emphasizing the relevance of key binding sites such as 
the catalytic active site (CAS) and the peripheral anionic site (PAS) of 
cholinesterases. The central axis of this review lies in the exploration of 
naturally occurring peptides that have demonstrated dual or multiple activities 
against AD-related targets. We highlight our group's pioneering work on 
amphibian-derived peptides such as Hp-1971, Hp-1935, and BcI-1003, which exhibit 
non-competitive inhibition of AChE and BChE, MAO-B modulation, and antioxidant 
properties. Furthermore, we describe additional peptide-rich extracts and 
bioactive sequences from various amphibians and other animal or plant sources, 
expanding the landscape of natural molecules with neuroprotective potential. We 
also delve into peptide modification strategies-such as amino acid substitution, 
cyclization, D-amino acid incorporation, and terminal/side-chain 
functionalization-that have been employed to enhance peptide stability, 
blood-brain barrier permeability, and target affinity. These strategies not only 
improve the pharmacokinetic profiles of native peptides but also open the door 
for the rational design of next-generation peptide therapeutics. Overall, this 
review underscores the vast potential of natural peptides as scaffolds for the 
development of multifunctional agents capable of intervening in the complex 
cascade of Alzheimer's pathology.

BACKGROUND: Defining the progression of blood biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) is essential for targeting treatments in patients most likely to benefit 
from early intervention. We delineated the temporal ordering of blood biomarkers 
a decade prior to the onset of AD, explored associations with AD brain 
pathology, and examined the relationship between reactive astrocytosis in the 
brain and plasma in a transgenic mouse model.
METHODS: We analyzed plasma blood biomarkers using the Quanterix HD-X instrument 
in case-control and postmortem cohorts from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on 
Aging (BLSA). We assessed plasma and cortical reactive astrocytosis, measured by 
glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), in 5xFAD transgenic and wild-type mice.
FINDINGS: In AD-converters (N = 158, 377 samples), higher plasma GFAP levels are 
observed 10 years prior to the onset of cognitive impairment due to AD compared 
with individuals who remain cognitively unimpaired (N = 160, 379 samples). 
Plasma GFAP levels are highest in neuropathologically confirmed AD, intermediate 
in asymptomatic AD, and lowest in cognitively unimpaired and associated with 
severity of neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. GFAP-labeled 
immunoreactive astrocytes in the cortex of 3- and 7-month-old 5xFAD transgenic 
mice increased relative to wild-type mice and higher blood GFAP concentration 
was associated with more GFAP-expressing astrocytes.
CONCLUSIONS: Reactive astrocytosis, assessed by elevated GFAP levels, is an 
early event in the progression of blood biomarker changes in preclinical AD, may 
be an early marker of AD pathogenesis, and a promising therapeutic target.

BACKGROUND: As the global prevalence of Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM) continues to 
rise, it becomes increasingly critical to delve into the systemic understanding 
of the disease. T2DM is widely acknowledged as a multifaceted condition 
characterized by numerous pre-existing and subsequent comorbidities. These 
complications, spanning both pre- and post-diabetic phases, are interconnected 
through shared genes or variants, often indicating underlying genetic 
correlations. While various studies have touched upon individual complications 
in relation to T2DM, there remains a gap in comprehensive research that 
systematically analyzes the evidence supporting the association of all these 
complications with T2DM.
METHODOLOGY: In this study, we employed a network-based system biology approach 
to build a Disease-Disease Association (DDA) network specific to T2DM. This 
network identifies numerous comorbidities based on gene sharing among various 
diseases. Subsequently, these linked diseases were categorized into different 
disease classes and further into pre- and post-diabetes complications for 
detailed investigation. We then conducted functional enrichment analysis on a 
core set of genes associated with diabetes to identify underlying domain 
activities, including biological processes, molecular functions, and pathways 
linked to the disease. Additionally, we analyzed variants within this core gene 
group to gain deeper insights into the genetic landscape of diabetes.
RESULTS: We identified 2140 diseases directly associated with T2DM, each sharing 
at least 27 common genes, by applying the Jaccard Index for Genes (JIg) filter 
with a threshold of 0.01. Among these, 244 most prominent diseases with JIg ≥0.1 
were classified into 18 disease classes - including cardiovascular, 
neurological, metabolic, and inflammatory, etc - based on MeSH terms, and 
further linked to pre- and post-diabetic complications. Obesity, Hypertensive 
Disease, Metabolic Syndrome X, and Hyperglycemia were the top four among 27 
prediabetic conditions, while Cardiovascular Disease, Atherosclerosis, 
Arteriosclerosis, Alzheimer, and Coronary Artery Disease led the 85 
post-diabetic complications, all showing strong associations with T2DM. 
Furthermore, Enrichment analysis of the core genes revealed critical pathways, 
including PI3K-Akt signaling, along with biological processes associated with 
different stimulus response and regulation activities, and molecular functions 
involving different signaling receptors and binding activities, as well as other 
significant domain entities-highlighting their pivotal roles in T2DM development 
and progression.
CONCLUSION: Our study presents a significant advancement in understanding T2DM 
and its comorbidities. Employing a network-based methodology, we identified 
diseases linked to T2DM based on genetic similarities, subsequently classifying 
them into pre- and post-diabetes complications. Functional enrichment analysis 
of diabetes-associated genes elucidates key biological processes and pathways, 
offering insights into potential therapeutic targets. Our findings facilitate 
personalized treatment strategies and early interventions, contributing to 
addressing the global burden of T2DM and improving patient outcomes.
