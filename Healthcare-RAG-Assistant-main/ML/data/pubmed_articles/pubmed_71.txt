BACKGROUND: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with the 
development of dementia. However, the link between PTSD and preclinical 
Alzheimer's disease pathology (amyloid β [Aβ]) remains controversial. Moreover, 
the correlation between the severity of PTSD with Aβ levels remains unknown.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study sought to investigate the associations of 
PTSD symptoms with global and regional brain Aβ burden. To this end, data were 
obtained from participants in the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic 
Alzheimer's Disease (A4) Study. In addition, we explored the association between 
the severity of PTSD symptoms and Aβ levels.
RESULTS: A total of 4,228 participants aged 65 to 85 years were included in the 
final analysis. The results showed that PTSD symptoms were significantly 
associated with higher global Aβ levels (1.15 ± 0.20 vs. 1.09 ± 0.19; β = 0.056; 
p < 0.001), after adjusting for covariates. The association between PTSD 
symptoms and Aβ levels was not affected by sex, age, ApoE genotype, or 
psychiatric diseases. Similarly, PTSD symptoms were significantly associated 
with Aβ levels in all subregions, including the anterior cingulate, posterior 
cingulate, parietal cortex, precuneus, temporal cortex, and frontal cortex. In 
addition, the group with severe PTSD symptoms (1.22 ± 0.24) exhibited higher 
global Aβ levels than the groups with moderate (1.14 ± 0.19) or mild 
(1.12 ± 0.20) symptoms or the control (1.08 ± 0.18), with p < 0.001.
CONCLUSION: The findings imply a close relationship between PTSD and brain Aβ 
levels, irrespective of sex, age, ApoE genotype, or psychiatric diseases. More 
well-designed studies are needed to further explore the relationship and 
mechanism underlying the association between PTSD and Aβ burden.

BACKGROUND: Efficacy data on nonpharmacotherapy-based interventions such as 
cognitive retraining and mindfulness meditation on improving neuropsychological 
functioning in early Alzheimer's disease (AD) are sparse in Indian literature.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to quantify the effect of cognitive 
retraining (CR) versus mindfulness training (MT) on neuropsychological test 
performance in patients with early AD.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: We administered CR and MT strategies in two prospectively 
enrolled groups of individuals (N = 34) who met the criteria for mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) due to AD. Inclusion was based on patient choice and informed 
consent. One group of 20 patients was imparted supervised CR, and the other 
group included 14 patients who opted for MT as open-labeled interventions, with 
group allocation based on participant choice.
RESULTS: Paired t test was performed with assessment of baseline and 
postintervention neuropsychological scores of CR and MT groups. The CR group 
revealed significant improvement on scores at 3 months (P < 0.05) for 
Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination (ACE) subcomponents, particularly total 
score, memory, visuospatial, and language subscores as well as on Clinical 
Dementia Rating (CDR) scale. The MT group showed no significant differences on 
these tests post-intervention with a trend toward improvement on recall scores, 
and none of the other test scores demonstrated a declining trend.
CONCLUSIONS: This proof-of-concept study demonstrated significant benefit of CR 
in improving neuropsychological test performance in patients with MCI due to AD 
and need to be studied in long-term, multicenter, randomized controlled trials 
in harmonized groups of patients with MCI and early AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major neurodegenerative disease, affecting more 
than two-third cases of dementia in the world. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used anti-inflammatory analgesic agents, representing 
7.7% of worldwide prescriptions, of which 90% are in patients over 65 years old. 
Based on mixed findings by different randomized clinical trials (RCTs), a 
systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to develop a better 
understanding of the protective role of NSAIDs in AD. Database search was 
Pubmed, WebScience, and Embase. RCTs investigating the effect of NSAIDs on AD or 
test scores assessing cognitive function in people without AD at baseline were 
included. Two indicators were the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) Score and 
Hazard Ratio. 09 studies were included in the present Meta-analysis. For the 
MMSE score difference, the pooled effect size was - 0.06 (-0.22, 0.10) which was 
not statistically significant (P value = 0.47). For the MMSE score, the pooled 
effect size was - 0.0036(-0.0320, 0.0248), which was also not statistically 
significant (P value = 0.87). For Hazard Ratio (HR), the pooled HR calculated 
using the random effect model was 1.20 (95% CI: 0.95, 1.51), which was not 
statistically significant (P value = 0.15). Present meta-analysis shows that 
NSAIDs, in general, are not effective in the treatment of AD. They also have no 
protective effect against the development of AD on their sustained use.

BACKGROUND: Hericium erinaceus mycelium and its constituents, erinacines A and 
S, have shown neuroprotective effects in APP/PS1 transgenic mice; however, the 
precise mechanisms by which they modulate microglial phenotypes remain unclear. 
Our study is the first to explore the effect of erinacines on microglia 
morphology and the underlying mechanisms using a novel primary mixed glia cell 
model and advanced bioinformatic tools. Furthermore, we emphasize the clinical 
relevance by evaluating erinacines in a metabolically stressed APP/PS1 mouse 
model, which more accurately reflects the complexities of human Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), where metabolic syndrome is a common comorbidity.
METHODS: Rat primary mixed glial cultures were used to simulate the spectrum of 
microglial phenotypes, particularly the transition from immature to mature 
states. Microarray sequencing, along with Connectivity Map, ConsensusPathDB, and 
Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, identified pathways influenced by erinacines. The 
therapeutic efficacy was further evaluated in metabolically stressed APP/PS1 
mice.
RESULTS: Erinacines significantly promoted the development of a ramified, 
neuroprotective microglial phenotype. Bioinformatics revealed potential 
modulation of microglia via histone deacetylase inhibition, actin filament 
dynamics, and synaptic structure modification-pathways not previously linked to 
erinacines in AD. Importantly, erinacines significantly lower fasting blood 
glucose and insulin levels while reducing amyloid-beta plaque burden, 
suppressing hyperactivated glial responses, and enhancing neurogenesis in the 
metabolically stressed APP/PS1 mice.
CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate the dual action of erinacines in modulating 
microglia morphology and phenotype while providing neuroprotection in a model 
that closely mimic the complexities of human Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, 
this study provides the foundation for understanding the potential mechanisms of 
action of erinacines, highlighting their promise as a novel treatment approach 
for Alzheimer's, particularly in cases complicated by metabolic dysfunction.

Cellular senescence (CS) is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the 
mechanisms through which CS contributes to AD pathogenesis remain poorly 
understood. We found that CS level in AD was higher compared with the healthy 
control group. Transcriptome-based differential expression analysis identified 
113 CS-related genes in blood and 410 in brain tissue as potential candidate 
genes involved in AD. To further explore the causal role of these genes, an 
integrative mendelian randomization analysis was conducted, combining AD 
genome-wide association study summary statistics with expression quantitative 
trait loci (eQTL) and DNA methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL) data from 
blood samples, which identified five putative AD-causal genes (CENPW, EXOSC9, 
HSPB11, SLC44A2, and SLFN12) and 18 corresponding DNA methylation probes. 
Additionally, integrative analysis between eQTLs and mQTLs from blood uncovered 
two genes and 12 corresponding regulatory elements involved in AD. Furthermore, 
two genes (CDKN2B and ITGAV) were prioritized as putative causal genes in brain 
tissue and were validated through in vitro experiments. The multi-omics 
integration study revealed the potential role and underlying biological 
mechanisms of CS driven by genetic predisposition in AD. This study contributed 
to fundamental understanding of CS in AD pathogenesis and facilitated the 
identification of potential therapeutic targets for AD prevention and treatment.

Neurological disorders, encompassing conditions such as Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis (ALS), pose a significant global health challenge, affecting 
millions worldwide. With an aging population and increased life expectancy, the 
prevalence of these disorders is escalating rapidly, leading to substantial 
economic burdens exceeding trillions of dollars annually. Animal models play a 
crucial role in understanding the underlying mechanisms of these disorders and 
developing effective treatments. Various species, including rodents, non-human 
primates, and fruit flies, are utilized to replicate specific aspects of human 
neurological conditions. However, selecting the ideal animal model requires 
careful consideration of its proximity to human disease conditions and its 
ability to mimic disease pathobiology and pharmacological responses. An Animal 
Model Quality Assessment (AMQA) tool has been developed to facilitate this 
selection process, focusing on assessing models based on their similarity to 
human conditions and disease pathobiology. Therefore, integrating intrinsic and 
extrinsic factors linked to the disease into the study's objectives aids in 
constructing a biological information matrix for comparing disease progression 
between the animal model and human disease. Ultimately, selecting an ideal 
animal disease model depends on its predictive, face, and construct validity, 
ensuring relevance and reliability in translational research efforts.

INTRODUCTION: Older adults with serious mental illness (SMI) experience higher 
rates of medical comorbidities, mortality, hospital readmissions, and total 
healthcare spending when compared with Medicare beneficiaries without SMI. 
Although telehealth provides an opportunity to overcome barriers to behavioral 
healthcare access, older adults face unique challenges when accessing and 
utilizing telehealth services. We present Author Health's care model, which 
integrates virtual-first behavioral health care with an interdisciplinary 
approach to health-related social needs (HRSN) screening and intervention in 
older adults.
METHODS: We launched an innovative behavioral healthcare delivery model in 
collaboration with primary care for Medicare Advantage recipients with SMI, 
substance use disorders (SUD), and dementia. All patients completed an intake 
with an MD/NP and were offered screening for HRSN at entry using the Accountable 
Health Communities HRSN tool. Primary diagnosis was assigned and categorized 
into SMI/SUD/dementia and non-SMI. Logistic regression was used to quantify the 
odds of food, housing, and transportation insecurity explained by 
SMI/SUD/dementia versus non-SMI behavioral health conditions.
RESULTS: A total of 2301 patients completed an intake from January 2023 to March 
2024. Moderate/severe depression (40%) was the most common primary target 
condition at intake, followed by dementia/Alzheimer's disease (12%) and bipolar 
disorder (5%). The rates of housing insecurity, food insecurity, and 
transportation insecurity were 27%, 30%, and 21%, respectively. Within our 
sample of Medicare Advantage participants in Florida, patients with 
SMI/SUD/dementia were 1.42 times (p < 0.05) and 1.58 times (p < 0.01) more 
likely to report housing insecurity and food insecurity, respectively, when 
compared with those with mild/moderate behavioral health conditions.
CONCLUSION: Author Health provides a blueprint for behavioral health services 
that remove barriers and provide tenacious, consistent, and whole-person 
virtual-first behavioral health care tailored to the unique needs of older 
adults. Our sample of Medicare Advantage participants in Florida suggests 
SMI/SUD/dementia may be a predictor for HRSN independent of socioeconomic status 
and race/ethnicity.

BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) has been recognised as a 
potential risk factor for cognitive decline, yet its precise relationship with 
dementia remains uncertain. This study aimed to determine the risk of dementia 
among individuals with and without OSAS.
METHODS: Data derived from 2.3 million adults (aged ≥18 years) were extracted 
from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (2000-2022), a nationally 
representative primary care electronic health records database in the UK. 
193 600 individuals with OSAS were propensity score-matched to 536 701 
individuals without OSAS. Cox proportional hazard regression models were applied 
to quantify the risk of developing all-cause dementia, vascular dementia and 
Alzheimer's disease between individuals with and without OSAS.
RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 4.0 (IQR 1.8-7.5) years, 2802 and 6211 
individuals developed all-cause dementia in those with and without OSAS, 
corresponding to crude incidence rates of 2.47 and 2.34 per 1000 person-years, 
respectively. The presence of OSAS was associated with higher risks of all-cause 
dementia (adjusted HR (aHR) 1.12, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.17), vascular dementia (1.29, 
95% CI 1.19 to 1.41) and unchanged risk of Alzheimer's disease (1.07, 95% CI 
0.99 to 1.16). Individuals with OSAS who had received continuous positive airway 
pressure (CPAP) treatment exhibited a similar risk of all-cause dementia as 
their matched counterparts (0.99, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.32).
CONCLUSION: OSAS is associated with higher risks of all-cause dementia and some 
of its subtypes. Further investigation is needed to investigate the clinical 
benefits of screening for cognitive impairment in people with OSAS and to 
further evaluate the impact of CPAP on cognitive decline and dementia risk.

Aluminum chloride (AlCl3), a known neurotoxic and Alzheimerogenic metal disrupts 
redox homeostasis which plays a pivotal role in pathophysiology of 
neurodegenerative disorders, particularly cognitive decline. The current study 
was designed to unveil the long-term neuroprotective outcomes and efficacy of 
CoQ10 and curcumin low dose (100 mg/kg each) combination in 18-months old 
geriatric male Balb/c mice subjected to AlCl3-prompted memory derangements 
(200 mg/kg in water bottles) for 28 days. The neuroprotective properties driven 
by antioxidant mechanisms were assessed via observing cellular pathology in 
key-memory related brain regions including the cornuammonis (CA3 and DG) and 
cortex 2/3 layer. Our outcomes revealed that AlCl3 exposure significantly 
reduced spatial learning and memory. In contrast, CoQ10 and curcumin 
combinatorial regime markedly mitigated cognitive deficits Vs. individual 
high-dose in AlCl3-treated animals as demonstrated by their improved performance 
in neurobehavioral tests such as the Y-maze, novel object recognition, passive 
avoidance and Morris-water maze test. Additionally, CoQ10 and curcumin 
co-administration restored redox balance by significantly reducing the levels of 
oxidative stressor (MDA) and increasing the anti-oxidant capacity (SOD,GPx). 
AchE is an enzyme involved in acetylcholine breakdown which negatively impacts 
acetylcholine levels and memory function. AlCl3 exposure elevated AchE levels in 
mice brains vs. treatment. This neurochemical alteration was notably reversed in 
the dual-treatment group. Furthermore, CoQ10 and curcumin ameliorated 
AlCl3-induced neurotoxicity by preserving neuronal cytoarchitecture in both 
cortical and hippocampal regions. In conclusion, CoQ10 and curcumin combination 
might attenuate memory loss induced by AlCl3-intoxication via restoring aberrant 
AchE activity, enhanced anti-oxidant defenses and salvaging the deleterious 
neuronal damage.

Reduced somatostatin (SST) and SST-expressing GABAergic neurons are 
well-replicated findings in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and are associated with 
cognitive deficits. SST cells inhibit pyramidal cell dendrites through α5-GABA-A 
receptors (α5-GABAA-R). α5-GABAAR positive allosteric modulation (α5-PAM) has 
procognitive and neurotrophic effects in stress and aging models. We tested 
whether α5-PAM (GL-II-73) could prevent cognitive deficits and neuronal spine 
loss in early stages, and reverse them in late stages of β-amyloid deposition in 
the 5xFAD model (N = 48/study; 50 % female). Acute administration of GL-II-73 
prevented spatial working memory deficits in 5xFAD mice at 2 months of age, 
while chronic administration reversed the deficits at 5 months of age. Chronic 
GL-II-73 treatment prevented 5xFAD-induced loss of spine density, spine count 
and dendritic length at both time points, despite β-amyloid accumulation. These 
results demonstrate procognitive and neurotrophic effects of GL-II-73 in early 
and late stages of Alzheimer-related β-amyloid deposition. This suggests α5-PAM 
as a novel β-amyloid-independent symptomatic therapeutic approach.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of resistance exercise on the risk of falls, 
fear of falling, muscle strength, neuropsychiatric symptoms and ability to 
perform activities of daily living in people with Alzheimer's disease (AD).
DESIGN: Single-blinded randomised controlled trial.
SETTING: Five aged care centres specialising in AD, located in Andalucía, Spain.
PARTICIPANTS: Sixty people diagnosed with AD were assigned at random to either 
the intervention group (n = 30) or the control group (n = 30).
INTERVENTIONS: The intervention group completed three weekly resistance exercise 
sessions for 12 weeks, in addition to cognitive training, until completion of 
the study. The control group undertook cognitive training alone.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Main outcome measure: risk of falls (Short Physical 
Performance Battery).
SECONDARY OUTCOMES: muscle strength (hand dynamometry), neuropsychiatric 
symptoms (Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire), fear of falling 
(Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale) and ability to perform activities 
of daily living (Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale).
RESULTS: The analysis demonstrated differences in favour of the intervention 
group, in both the short and medium term, for risk of falls [post-treatment: 
mean difference (MD) 1.5, 95% CI of the difference 0.9 to 2.0; 3-month follow 
up: MD 1.1, 95% CI of the difference 0.6 to 1.6]; fear of falling 
(post-treatment: MD 1.5, 95% CI of the difference 4.0 to 7.7; 3-month follow up: 
MD 6.3, 95% CI of the difference 4.3 to 8.2); activities of daily living 
(post-treatment: MD 0.2, 95% CI of the difference -0.01 to 0.4; 3-month follow 
up: MD 0.3, 95% CI of the difference 0.01 to 0.5); neuropsychiatric symptoms 
(post-treatment: MD -2.2, 95% CI of the difference -3.3 to -1.0; 3-month follow 
up: MD -2.4, 95% CI of the difference -3.7 to -1.2); and dynamometry 
(post-treatment: MD 3.1, 95% CI of the difference 2.5 to 3.7; 3-month follow up: 
MD 2.6, 95% CI of the difference 1.9 to 3.3).
CONCLUSION: Resistance exercise effectively reduces the risk of falls, fear of 
falling and neuropsychiatric symptoms, and improves muscle strength in people 
with AD in both the short and medium term. CONTRIBUTION OF THE PAPER.

In recent decades, Alzheimer's disease (AD) has garnered significant attention 
due to its rapid global prevalence. The cholinergic hypothesis posits that the 
degradation of acetylcholine by acetylcholinesterase (AChE) contributes to AD 
development. Despite existing anti-AChE drugs, their adverse side effects 
necessitate new agents. This study analyzed 150 bioactive phytochemicals from 
Trachyspermum ammi using structure-based drug design and various in-silico tools 
to identify potent anti-AChE compounds. Compounds were screened for 
drug-likeness (QEDw ≥50%) and bioavailability (≥55%) and underwent toxicity 
profiling via the ProTox-II server. Selected compounds were prepared for 
molecular docking with the human AChE protein as the receptor. Viridifloral, 
2-Methyl-3-glucosyloxy-5-isopropyl phenol, Alpha-Curcumene, and Sterol emerged 
as top candidates with high AChE affinity. These results were validated by 
molecular dynamics simulations, confirming stable interactions. The hit 
compounds were further evaluated for drug-likeness using Lipinski's rule and 
ADMET properties, confirming favorable pharmacokinetic profiles. DFT 
optimization analyzed frontier molecular orbitals and electrostatic potential, 
demonstrating favorable chemical reactivity and stability. This study suggests 
that these identified compounds could be novel nature-derived AChE inhibitors, 
potentially contributing to AD treatment. However, further in-vitro and in-vivo 
studies are necessary to confirm their efficacy in biological systems. Future 
research will focus on developing these compounds into safe and effective drugs 
to combat Alzheimer's disease.

BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with increased dementia risk, 
yet its role in postoperative neurocognitive disorders is unclear. Here, we 
studied whether the severity of untreated obstructive sleep apnea is associated 
with the severity of postoperative neurocognitive disorder.
METHODS: In this single-center prospective cohort study, older noncardiac 
surgery patients aged 60 years and above underwent preoperative home sleep apnea 
testing, and pre- and postoperative delirium assessments and cognitive testing. 
Sleep apnea severity was determined using the measured respiratory event index 
(REI). Global cognitive change from before to 6 weeks (and 1 year) after surgery 
was used to measure postoperative neurocognitive disorder severity. 
Postoperative changes in individual cognitive domain performance along with 
subjective cognitive complaints and/or deficits in instrumental activities of 
daily living were used to measure postoperative neurocognitive disorder 
incidence.
RESULTS: Of 96 subjects who completed home sleep apnea testing, 58 tested 
positive for sleep apnea. In univariable analyses, sleep apnea severity was not 
associated with increased postoperative neurocognitive disorder severity at 6 
weeks (global cognitive change ; [95% confidence interval [CI], -0.02 to 0.03]; 
P = .79) or 1-year after surgery (; [95% CI, -0.02 to 0.03]; P = .70). Adjusting 
for age, sex, baseline cognition, and surgery duration, sleep apnea severity 
remained not associated with increased postoperative neurocognitive disorder 
severity at 6 weeks (; [95% CI, -0.02 to 0.04]; P = .40) or 1-year after surgery 
(; [95% CI, -0.02 to 0.04]; P = .55). In a multivariable analysis, sleep apnea 
severity was not associated with postoperative neurocognitive disorder (either 
mild or major) incidence at 6 weeks (odds ratio [OR] = 0.89, [95% CI, 
0.59-1.14]; P = .45) or 1-year postoperatively (OR = 1.01, [95% CI, 0.81-1.24]; 
P = .90). Sleep apnea severity was also not associated with postoperative 
delirium in univariable analyses (delirium incidence OR = 0.88, [95% CI, 
0.59-1.10]; P = .37; delirium severity ; [95% CI, -0.02 to 0.03]; P = .79) or in 
multivariable analyses (delirium incidence OR = 1.07, [95% CI, 0.81-1.38]; P = 
.74; delirium severity OR = 0.95, [95% CI, 0.81-1.10]; P = .48).
CONCLUSIONS: In this older noncardiac surgery cohort, untreated sleep apnea was 
not associated with increased incidence or severity of postoperative 
neurocognitive disorder or delirium.

Continued methodological advances have enabled numerous statistical approaches 
for the analysis of summary statistics from genome-wide association studies. 
Genetic correlation analysis within specific regions enables a new strategy for 
identifying pleiotropy. Genomic regions with significant 'local' genetic 
correlations can be investigated further using state-of-the-art methodologies 
for statistical fine-mapping and variant colocalisation. We explored the utility 
of a genome-wide local genetic correlation analysis approach for identifying 
genetic overlaps between the candidate neuropsychiatric disorders, Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia, 
Parkinson's disease, and schizophrenia. The correlation analysis identified 
several associations between traits, the majority of which were loci in the 
human leukocyte antigen region. Colocalisation analysis suggested that 
disease-implicated variants in these loci often differ between traits and, in 
one locus, indicated a shared causal variant between ALS and AD. Our study 
identified candidate loci that might play a role in multiple neuropsychiatric 
diseases and suggested the role of distinct mechanisms across diseases despite 
shared loci. The fine-mapping and colocalisation analysis protocol designed for 
this study has been implemented in a flexible analysis pipeline that produces 
HTML reports and is available at:

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the propagation and spreading of CNS tau pathology 
closely correlates with cognitive decline, positioning tau as an attractive 
therapeutic target. Amyloid beta (Aβ) has been strongly implicated in driving 
tau spread, whereas primary tauopathies such as primary age-related tauopathy 
(PART)-which lack Aβ pathology-exhibit limited tau spread and minimal-to-no 
cognitive decline. Emerging evidence converges on a trans-synaptic mechanism of 
tau spread, facilitated by the transfer of misfolded tau aggregates (e.g. 
soluble oligomers). However, it is unclear whether Aβ oligomers modulate the 
binding and internalization of tau oligomers in human synapses. Our 
translationally focused paradigms utilize post-mortem brain specimens from 
Control, PART, and AD patients. Synaptosomes isolated from the temporal cortex 
of all three groups were incubated with preformed recombinant tauO 
(rtauO), ± preformed recombinant AβO (rAβO), and oligomer 
binding/internalization was quantified via flow cytometry following proteinase K 
(PK) digestion of surface-bound oligomers. TauO-synapse interactions were 
visualized using EM immunogold. Brain-derived tau oligomers (BDTO) from AD and 
PART PBS-soluble hippocampal fractions were co-immunoprecipitated and analyzed 
via mass spectrometry to compare synaptic tauO interactomes in primary and 
secondary tauopathies, thereby inferring the role of Aβ. AD synaptosomes, 
enriched in endogenous Aβ pathology, exhibited increased rtauO internalization 
compared to PART synaptosomes. This observation was mirrored in Control 
synaptosomes, where recombinant rAβO significantly increased rtauO binding and 
internalization. PK pre-treatment abolished this effect, implicating synaptic 
membrane proteins in AβO-mediated tauO internalization. While both PART and AD 
BDTO were broadly enriched in synaptic proteins, AD BDTO exhibited differential 
enrichment of endocytic proteins across pre- and post-synaptic compartments, 
whereas PART BDTO showed no significant synaptic enrichment. This study 
demonstrates that Aβ oligomers enhance tau oligomer binding and drive its 
internalization through synaptic membrane proteins. These findings offer novel 
mechanistic insights underlying pathological tau spreading directly within human 
synapses and emphasize the therapeutic potential of targeting Aβ-tau 
interactions.

The gut microbiome, which comprises symbiotic bacteria colonizing the human 
digestive tract, undergoes dynamic changes during the lifespan, as evidenced by 
the fact that the number of species and the diversity of their composition 
decrease significantly with age. The aim of this review is to illuminate 
bilateral neuroimmunological pathways that determine the role of gut microbiome 
dysbiosis, not only as a cause but also as a byproduct of many neurodegenerative 
diseases of the CNS, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease 
(PD), but also in the frame of several behavioral and psychiatric pathological 
conditions such as depressive and anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, and autism 
spectrum disorder (ASD). Dysbiosis, in particular, reveals a model of 
"deceptive" mimicry of host molecules that might cause abnormal folding 
("misfolding") and pathological aggregation of Aβ-peptide, leading to its 
dispersion through the gut-brain axis, precipitating microglia cell activation. 
By controlling myelination at the prefrontal cortex (PFC), a crucial area for 
multifaceted cognitive behavior, forecasting, and decision-making, the 
gut/microbiome-brain axis influences mood and social behavior, since major 
depressive disorder is correlated to white matter disturbance in the PFC, due to 
disregulations in the expression of myelin-related mRNA in this area. The gut 
microbiome is altered in psychosis compared to healthy controls, while 
medication with antipsychotics may result in reduced microbial community 
diversity. The vagus nerve, as a key element of the parasympathetic nervous 
system, regulating immune responses, may "detect" gut microbiome metabolites and 
transfer this intestinal information to the CNS, through its afferents, as in a 
"pseudo-neurotransmission" process. Scientific interest towards microbiome-based 
therapies increases as psychobiotics (which are strains of probiotics/prebiotics 
with specific properties to influence the gut-brain axis) appear to be able to 
exercise a beneficial effect in many CNS disorders. Lifestyle modifications, 
such as dietary interventions via psychobiotics intake that might enhance the 
gut microbiome's ability to produce beneficial metabolites that exert 
therapeutic effects on intestinal permeability, cognitive function, and 
immunity, may reveal new research pathways and therapeutic directions leading to 
a radical change of the "epistemology paradigm" as far as prevention and 
treatment of major neuro-psychiatric disorders is concerned.

The current number of dementia cases in Europe stands at 7.7 million, a figure 
projected to double by 2050. Caregivers of individuals with dementia experience 
a heightened burden compared to those caring for other chronically ill 
individuals, increasing the risk of depression and stress disorders. This 
systematic literature review, following PRISMA guidelines, explores the 
prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms in dementia caregivers. Searches 
in academic databases, restricted to studies from the last 15 years, identified 
85 articles with 16 meeting the inclusion criteria. Results indicate significant 
caregiver burden, diminished self-reported quality of life, and a propensity for 
clinical depression. Depression and anxiety symptoms were more pronounced among 
female caregivers. Caregiver depression correlated with increased emergency 
department utilization by dementia patients, with a surge in depressive symptoms 
reported during the COVID-19 pandemic. Caregiving for dementia patients was 
associated with burnout, adversely impacting caregiver quality of life. 
Depression and anxiety symptoms in caregivers correlated with substance use. 
Sociodemographic variables, including low socioeconomic status, high 
urbanization levels, and older age, were associated with caregiver depression. 
Caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's disease reported higher anxiety, 
burden, and depression scores compared to those assisting individuals with other 
dementias, particularly when neuropsychiatric symptoms were evident. The 
identification of the factors that are linked to the mental burden of caregivers 
allows mental health professionals to enhance symptom detection and provide 
tailored support, ultimately alleviating caregiver burden and improving dementia 
care quality. Systematic professional assistance and training opportunities 
through health policies can effectively alleviate caregiver burden.

Drug development for Alzheimer's disease is extremely challenging, as 
demonstrated by the repeated failures of amyloid-β-targeted therapeutics and the 
controversies surrounding the amyloid-β cascade hypothesis. More recently, 
advances in the development of Lecanemab, an anti-amyloid-β monoclonal antibody, 
have shown positive results in reducing brain A burden and slowing cognitive 
decline in patients with early-stage Alzheimer's disease in the Phase III 
clinical trial (Clarity Alzheimer's disease). Despite these promising results, 
side effects such as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) may limit its 
usage. ARIA can manifest as ARIA-E (cerebral edema or effusions) and ARIA-H 
(microhemorrhages or superficial siderosis) and is thought to be caused by 
increased vascular permeability due to inflammatory responses, leading to 
leakages of blood products and protein-rich fluid into brain parenchyma. 
Endothelial dysfunction is an early pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease, 
and the blood-brain barrier becomes increasingly leaky as the disease 
progresses. In addition, APOE4, the strongest genetic risk factor for 
Alzheimer's disease, is associated with higher vascular amyloid burden, 
increased ARIA incidence, and accelerated blood-brain barrier disruptions. These 
interconnected vascular abnormalities highlight the importance of vascular 
contributions to the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease. Here, we will 
closely examine recent research evaluating the heterogeneity of brain 
endothelial cells in the microvasculature of different brain regions and their 
relationships with Alzheimer's disease progression.

Most of the existing SERS systems failed to achieve satisfactory results in 
early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease owing to a lack of effective signal 
transduction. Herein, we developed a dual signal amplification strategy for SERS 
detection of amyloid-β oligomers based on proximity hybridization-triggered 
catalyzed hairpin assembly (CHA) and hybridization chain reaction (HCR). In the 
presence of the target protein and two DNA-labeled antibodies, a proximate 
complex formed in a homogeneous solution. Each of the AβO-DNA complexes served 
as a catalyst to trigger and accelerate numerous hybridization processes between 
MB1 and MB2. Subsequently, the single-strand fragment on the electrode surface 
initiated HCR, resulting in the hybridization reaction to form double-strand DNA 
concatemers on the substrate surface. The surface became negatively charged and 
allowed the absorption of silver ions on the DNA skeleton. After chemical 
reduction by hydroquinone, the formed silver nanoparticles could be further 
grown with a silver enhancement step to amplify the detectable SERS signal by 
absorbing rhodamine 6G as a SERS reporter on the silver nanoparticle surface. 
This biosensing platform had potential applications in molecular diagnostics of 
AD serum samples.

BACKGROUND: Much remains to be learned about patients with heart failure with 
improved ejection fraction (HFimpEF).
OBJECTIVE: This study sheds light on the characteristics and clinical outcomes 
of HFimpEF patients, including the consequences of halting guideline-directed 
medical therapy (GDMT).
METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted on patients diagnosed with heart 
failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) who underwent a second 
echocardiogram at least 6 months apart between January 2009 and February 2023. 
The primary outcomes were major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), including 
all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalization. The second outcome was 
recurrent HFrEF.
RESULTS: Of 4,560 HFrEF patients were included, 3,289 (72.1%) achieved HFimpEF 
within a median follow-up period of 3.4 years (IQR: 1.8 - 5.9 years). Among 
these HFimpEF patients, recurrent HFrEF was observed in 941 (28.6%) patients 
during a median follow-up period of 2.3 years (IQR: 0.8-4.6 years). The 
proportion of patients who halted GDMT was 70.4%, 53.2%, 59.8% and 63.8% for 
MRA, beta-blockers, ACEI/ARB/ARNI and SGLT-2 inhibitors. Multivariable Cox 
analysis revealed ischemic heart disease, chronic kidney disease, coronary heart 
disease, lower left ventricular ejection fraction, larger left ventricular 
diastolic dimension and non-use GDMT are associated with recurrent HFrEF. 
Individuals without GDMT use exhibited lower chances of persistently recovering 
ejection fraction and high risks of MACEs compared to those who continue use.
CONCLUSIONS: HFimpEF is a common condition across all clinical follow-ups. 
Prevalent discontinuation of GDMT medications may contribute significantly to 
recurrent HFrEF, placing patients at a higher risk for poor prognosis.

BACKGROUND: Falls and extremity fractures often occur in people living with 
Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (ADRD). In post-fracture care, these 
patients are cared for either at rehabilitation facilities or their homes. The 
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic limited the utilization of 
rehabilitation facilities. In areas with provider shortages, this trend poses a 
risk of disability and caregiver burdens, particularly in racial minorities who 
under-utilize rehabilitation facilities.
OBJECTIVE: To assess racial disparities in post-acute care (PAC) at 
rehabilitation facilities among people living with ADRD and extremity fractures 
during the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: We summarized the PAC locations by (1) rehabilitation facilities 
(skilled nursing facilities and inpatient rehabilitation facilities) and (2) 
homes (homes with self-care and homes with services) for each study year. We 
observed the yearly percentage trends in PAC at rehabilitation facilities over 
the total post-acute discharge period. We assessed demographics (age, sex, and 
race), clinical comorbidities (fracture sites), utilization factors (pay source 
and hospital location), and COVID-19 pandemic status (pre-/post-pandemic years). 
We used multivariate logistic regression to estimate the association between 
these factors and PAC in the rehabilitation facilities.
RESULTS: The proportion of individuals receiving PAC declined in rehabilitation 
facilities, whereas the proportion of individuals receiving PAC at home with 
services continuously increased. Being Hispanic, presence of cerebrovascular 
disorder (CVD), use of Medicaid services, and the COVID-19 pandemic were 
associated with lower probabilities of utilizing rehabilitation facilities.
CONCLUSION: Among the individuals with ADRD and extremity fractures, the 
proportion of those who underutilized rehabilitation facilities was higher in 
Hispanics compared with other races. Caregiving for Hispanics, presence of CVD, 
and use of Medicaid services were associated with the risk of disability and 
caregiver burden, due to shifting trends from rehabilitation facilities to homes 
with services. Geriatric workforce education should be prioritized to enhance 
the competencies of healthcare providers serving these individuals to relieve 
caregiver burdens in areas with provider shortage.

Plant alkaloids are used in a variety of medicines, such as anti-cancer drugs 
and analgesics. Among these plant alkaloids, galanthamine is an Amaryllidaceae 
type alkaloid with acetylcholinesterase inhibition activity used in the 
treatment of neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Although the 
chemical synthesis of galanthamine has been successfully achieved, Narcissus 
tazetta is the main source of its production. Research shows that the 
galanthamine content varies not only with the type of daffodil but also with the 
stage of development and the part of the plant. Pharmaceutical companies seek 
plant species with higher galanthamine content to increase pharmaceutical 
availability. In this study, we were able to rapidly confirm the presence of 
alkaloids, such as galanthamine, lycorine, and tazettine in the N. tazetta 
sample using the probe electrospray ionization coupled with quadrupole 
time-of-flight type mass spectrometry. After confirmation of the components, we 
then visualized the distribution of the alkaloids by mass spectrometry imaging 
using the atmospheric pressure matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass 
spectrometer. In our method, we can provide qualitative data and visualized data 
immediately.

This study investigates adverse events following vaccination in patients with 
four neurodegenerative diseases: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), 
Alzheimer's disease, Multiple Sclerosis (MS), and Parkinson's disease. We 
applied advanced data processing techniques to analyze symptom patterns and 
severity scores across these disease groups. Patients were identified through 
filtering, and symptom clusters were extracted to group similar symptoms into 
distinct clusters, and severity scores were computed based on hospitalization 
and death reports. A chi-squared test was performed to assess the statistical 
significance of adverse event distributions among the diseases for different 
vaccines. The results reveal that ALS patients exhibit severe respiratory 
symptoms post-vaccination, while Alzheimer's patients report significant 
respiratory and gastrointestinal issues. MS patients commonly experience general 
symptoms such as fatigue, while Parkinson's patients face exacerbated motor 
symptoms. Notably, our analysis showed no significant difference in adverse 
event reporting rates between COVID-19 and pneumococcal vaccines across these 
disease groups. This research provides new insights into disease-specific 
responses to vaccines, emphasizing the importance of personalized monitoring and 
treatment strategies to mitigate risks and improve clinical outcomes in these 
vulnerable populations.

New conjugates of amiridine and salicylic derivatives (salicylamide, 
salicylimine, and salicylamine) with different lengths of alkylene spacers were 
designed, synthesized, and evaluated as potential multifunctional central 
nervous system therapeutic agents for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Conjugates 
demonstrated high acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) 
inhibition (IC50: AChE, 0.265-4.24 μM; BChE, 0.01-0.64 μM) but poor activity 
against off-target carboxylesterase (CES). Specifically, conjugates with a 
(CH2)8 spacer showed the highest AChE and BChE inhibition: 3-16 times more 
effective than amiridine. Salicylamides 7b and 7c had the maximum BChE/AChE 
selectivity ratios: 193 and 138, respectively. Conjugates were mixed-type 
reversible inhibitors of both cholinesterases and displaced propidium from the 
AChE peripheral anionic site (PAS) at the level of donepezil. All conjugates 
inhibited Aβ42 self-aggregation in the thioflavin test; inhibition increased 
with spacer elongation, being greatest for (CH2)8. The results agreed with 
molecular docking to AChE, BChE, and Aβ42. Conjugates exhibited high 
2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS)•+-scavenging 
activity comparable to the standard antioxidant Trolox, and they showed the 
ability to bind Cu2+, Fe2+, and Zn2+. Conjugates had favorable predicted 
intestinal absorption and blood-brain barrier permeability. Altogether, the 
results indicate that the new conjugates possess potential for further 
development as multifunctional anti-AD drug candidates.

Clear-cut evidence has linked defective autophagy to Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Recent studies underscore a unique hurdle in AD neuronal autophagy: impaired 
retrograde axonal transport of autophagosomes, potent enough to induce 
autophagic stress and neurodegeneration. Nonetheless, pertinent therapy is 
unavailable. Here, a novel combinational therapy composed of siROCK2 and 
lithospermic acid B (LA) is introduced, tailored to dredge blocked axonal 
autophagy by multi-mitigating microtubule disruption, ATP depletion, oxidative 
stress, and autophagy initiation impediments in AD. Leveraging the recent 
discovery of multi-interactions between polyphenol LA and siRNA, 
ε-Poly-L-lysine, and anionic lipid nanovacuoles, LA and siROCK2 are successfully 
co-loaded into a fresh nano-drug delivery system, LIP@PL-LA/siRC, via a 
ratio-flexible and straightforward fabrication process. Further modification 
with the TPL peptide onto LIP@PL-LA/siRC creates a brain-neuron targeted, 
biocompatible, and pluripotent nanomedicine, named "Nano-dredger" 
(T-LIP@PL-LA/siRC). Nano-dredger efficiently accelerates axonal retrograde 
transport and lysosomal degradation of autophagosomes, thereby facilitating the 
clearance of neurotoxic proteins, improving neuronal complexity, and alleviating 
memory defects in 3×Tg-AD transgenic mice. This study provides a fresh and 
flexible polyphenol/siRNA co-delivery paradigm and furnishes conceptual proof 
that dredging axonal autophagy represents a promising AD therapeutic avenue.

The excessive up-regulation of receptor for advanced glycation end products 
(RAGE), a well-known pathological marker, drives the onset and progression of 
Alzheimer's disease. Although lysosome-targeting protein degradation has emerged 
as an effective therapeutic modality, the limited lysosome-sorting efficacy 
greatly hindered the degradation efficiency of target proteins. Herein, a 
lysosome-shuttle-like nano-chimera (endoTAC) is proposed based on polyvalent 
receptor binding mode for enhanced RAGE degradation as well as precise drug 
delivery. The endoTAC shows a high affinity to RAGE and enhances RAGE 
degradation due to its polyvalent-interaction with RAGE. Additionally, endoTAC 
features increased accumulation in diseased brain and shows promise as a precise 
brain delivery system. After loading with simvastatin, the SV@endoTAC proves to 
successfully reverse pathological features both in vitro and in vivo. The work 
proposes that the combination of a lysosome-targeting chimera and an effective 
drug delivery system can be promising in Alzheimer's disease therapy.

BACKGROUND: Plant-based diets may protect against cognitive impairment; however, 
observational data have not been consistent.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the association between plant-based 
dietary patterns and cognitive function.
METHODS: The study recruited 937 participants who were asked to complete food 
frequency questionnaires to assess the quality of their plant-based diets using 
the overall plant-based diet index (PDI), the healthful PDI (hPDI), and the 
unhealthful PDI (uPDI). Cognitive function evaluated using the Montreal 
Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test. Logistic regression was used to explore the 
association between plant-based dietary patterns and the prevalence of mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI), while multiple linear regression was used to analyze 
the association between plant-based dietary patterns and cognitive scores.
RESULTS: The prevalence of MCI was 26% among the 937 participants. There was a 
significant association between higher uPDI scores and higher odds of MCI, with 
Quintile 4 compared with Quintile 1 showing an odds ratio of 2.21 (95% 
confidence interval 1.35, 3.60). Higher uPDI scores were associated with a lower 
total MoCA score and poorer performance in various cognitive domains. There were 
no significant associations between the PDI, the hPDI, and cognitive function. 
Consuming whole grains, nuts, and eggs once a week or more were associated with 
a lower risk of MCI, whereas frequently consumption of pickled vegetables was 
associated with an increased risk of MCI.
CONCLUSIONS: Unhealthy plant-based diets were associated with cognitive 
impairment, while whole grains, nuts, and eggs may protect cognitive function; 
pickled vegetables are associated with cognitive impairment.

BACKGROUND: Gantenerumab is a fully human anti-amyloid-β (Aβ) immunoglobulin G1 
monoclonal antibody for subcutaneous (SC) administration. The efficacy and 
safety of low-dose (105 mg or 225 mg) gantenerumab were investigated in SCarlet 
RoAD (SR; NCT01224106), a Phase III, double-blind (DB), placebo-controlled study 
in participants with prodromal Alzheimer's disease. Following a pre-planned 
futility analysis, SR was converted into an open-label extension (OLE) study.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term safety and tolerability of SC gantenerumab at 
doses of up to 1200 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W) in OLE participants who previously 
received placebo or gantenerumab in the DB part of SR.
METHODS: Participants of the DB part of SR, who met the eligibility criteria for 
the OLE, were offered the opportunity to receive gantenerumab up-titrated to 
1200 mg Q4W according to prespecified titration regimens. Safety and 
tolerability were assessed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), physical and 
neurologic examinations, and adverse event monitoring.
RESULTS: Overall, 154 participants were rolled over from the DB part of SR and 
received at least one dose of gantenerumab in the SR OLE. The median duration of 
treatment was 2.9 years (152.9 weeks). Forty-seven (30.5%) participants had an 
amyloid-related imaging abnormalities - edema (ARIA-E) MRI finding, and 51 
(33.1%) had an ARIA - hemorrhage MRI finding. Most ARIA-E findings were 
asymptomatic and manageable by MRI monitoring and dose intervention. There were 
no unexpected safety findings.
CONCLUSIONS: SC gantenerumab at doses of up to 1200 mg Q4W was well tolerated 
with no unexpected safety findings in participants with prodromal Alzheimer's 
disease.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT01224106.

BACKGROUND: It has been hypothesized that insulin resistance is pivotal in 
mediating amyloid and tau dysregulations in Alzheimer's disease (AD).
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of different antidiabetic agents, their 
daily dosage intake, and treatment duration on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD 
biomarkers among patients with type 2 diabetes.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study selected patients between 50 and 80 years 
with diabetes and CSF AD biomarkers screened between 2017 and 2023 in the 
VALCODIS Cohort. CSF biomarkers were total tau (t-tau), phosphorylated tau 181 
(p-tau), and amyloid-β 42 (Aβ42). Analytical variables were obtained. 
Antidiabetic prescriptions were recorded in defined daily doses (DDD), according 
to the ATC/DDD 2021 system, and years of drug exposure duration before lumbar 
puncture. Logistic regressions were performed to establish the correlations 
between drug usage and AD biomarker alteration.
RESULTS: Among patients with diabetes, Insulin consumption was associated with 
lower odds of abnormal Aβ42 levels (OR 0.36 [95% CI 0.15, 0.76]) and tau 
pathology (OR 0.49 [95% CI 0.24-0.98]). Metformin was related to lower odds of 
pathological p-tau when diabetes was uncontrolled, acting on t-tau and 
t-tau/Aβ42 ratio when it was concomitant with insulin, and patients had 
controlled diabetes. Lower odds of pathological levels of tau were observed when 
additional oral antidiabetic drugs were added among metformin users. iSGLT2 was 
associated with tau pathology.
CONCLUSIONS: The impact of antidiabetics on AD-related pathological biomarkers 
may depend on diabetes management.

BACKGROUND: Blood pressure (BP) variability (BPV) and time in target range (TTR) 
are emerging vascular risk factors for dementia, independent of traditionally 
targeted mean BP.
OBJECTIVE: Determine whether BPV or TTR is most strongly associated with 
cognitive risk.
METHODS: In this post hoc analysis of the SPRINT trial, 8034 participants 
underwent repeated BP measurement and cognitive testing at baseline and 
follow-up. Visit-to-visit BPV was calculated as average real variability. TTR 
was the percent of time in desired treatment arm target range (standard: 
120-140 mmHg systolic BP; intensive: 110-130 mmHg systolic BP). Adjudicated 
clinical outcomes were no cognitive impairment, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 
and probable dementia. We investigated a direct comparison of BPV and TTR in 
predicting cognitive risk, stratified by BP treatment group.
RESULTS: Elevated BPV was associated with increased risk for MCI (adjusted HR: 
1.21 [95% CI 1.10, 1.33], p < 0.001) and MCI/dementia (HR: 1.17 [95% CI 1.07, 
1.27], p < 0.001) in the standard group, and dementia (HR: 1.17 [95% CI 1.01, 
1.36], p = 0.039) in the intensive group. Higher TTR was related to lower 
dementia risk (HR: 0.72 [95% CI 0.60, 0.86], p < 0.001) in the intensive group 
only.
CONCLUSIONS: Visit-to-visit BPV outperformed TTR in predicting risk for MCI and 
MCI/dementia. TTR was more strongly associated with dementia risk under 
intensive treatment. Findings were independent of mean BP in a cohort with 
rigorously controlled BP and suggest newer aspects of BP control may be 
harnessed to further reduce cognitive risk.

BACKGROUND: Amyloid-β (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau are crucial biomarkers in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, interacting synergistically to accelerate 
disease progression. While Aβ initiates cascades leading to tau 
hyperphosphorylation and neurofibrillary tangles, PET imaging studies suggest a 
sequential progression from amyloidosis to tauopathy, closely linked with 
neurocognitive symptoms.
OBJECTIVE: To analyze the complex interactions between Aβ and tau in AD using 
probabilistic graphical models, assessing how regional tau accumulation is 
influenced by Aβ burden.
METHODS: Data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and 
Anti-Aβ Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's (A4) study were utilized, 
involving participants across various cognitive stages and employing both 
Florbetapir and Flortaucipir as tracers. Tau standardized uptake value ratio 
values were harmonized across studies, and participants were stratified into 
quantile groups based on Aβ levels. A LASSO regularized Gaussian graphical model 
analyzed partial correlations among brain regions to discern patterns of tau 
accumulation across different Aβ levels.
RESULTS: Statistical analyses revealed significant differences in tau structure 
among low, medium, and high Aβ groups in both ADNI and A4 cohorts, with graph 
metrics, such as small-world coefficient, indicating increased tau efficiency as 
Aβ burden increased.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that tau accumulates more efficiently with 
increasing Aβ burden, highlighting an interplay that could inform development of 
dual-targeting therapies in AD. This study underscores the importance of Aβ and 
tau interactions in AD progression and supports the hypothesis that targeting 
both pathologies could be crucial for therapeutic interventions.

Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia and mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI) are currently underdiagnosed in the community, and early detection of 
cognitive deficits is crucial for timely intervention. FACEmemory®, the first 
completely self-administered online memory test with voice recognition, has been 
launched as an accessible tool to detect such deficits. This study aims to 
investigate the neuropsychological associations between FACEmemory subscores and 
cognitive composites derived from traditional paper-and-pencil 
neuropsychological tests and to develop an optimal algorithm using FACEmemory 
data and demographics to discriminate cognitively healthy (CH) individuals from 
those with MCI. Methods: A total of 669 participants (266 CH, 206 non-amnestic 
MCI [naMCI], and 197 amnestic MCI [aMCI]) were included. Multiple linear 
regression analyses were conducted using a cognitive composite as the dependent 
variable and FACEmemory subscores and demographic data (age, sex, and schooling) 
as independent variables. Machine learning models were compared to identify an 
optimal algorithm for distinguishing between CH and MCI (whole MCI, aMCI, and 
naMCI). Results: Multiple regression analyses showed associations between 
FACEmemory scores and the domains of memory (ρ = 0.67), executive functions (ρ = 
0.63), visuospatial/visuoperceptual abilities (ρ = 0.55), language (ρ = 0.43), 
praxis (ρ = 0.52), and attention (ρ = 0.31). An optimal algorithm distinguished 
between CH and aMCI, achieving a FACEmemory cutoff score of 44.5, with 
sensitivity and specificity values of 0.81 and 0.72, respectively. Conclusions: 
FACEmemory is a promising online tool for identifying early cognitive 
impairment, particularly aMCI. It may contribute to addressing the 
underdiagnosis of MCI and dementia in the community and in promoting preventive 
strategies.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), a leading neurodegenerative disorder, is closely 
associated with the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides in the brain. The 
enzyme β-secretase (BACE1), pivotal in Aβ production, represents a promising 
therapeutic target for AD. While bioactive peptides derived from food protein 
hydrolysates have neuroprotective properties, their inhibitory effects on BACE1 
remain largely unexplored. In this study, we evaluated the inhibitory potential 
of protein hydrolysates from gliadin, whey, and casein proteins prepared using 
bromelain, papain, and thermolysin. Through in vitro and cellular assays, 
bromelain-hydrolyzed gliadin (G-Bro) emerged as the most potent BACE1 inhibitor, 
with an IC50 of 0.408 mg/mL. G-Bro significantly reduced BACE1 expression and 
amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing in N2a/PS/APP cell cultures, 
suggesting its potential to attenuate Aβ aggregation. The unique peptide profile 
of G-Bro likely contributes to its inhibitory effect, with proline residues 
disrupting β-sheets, lysine residues introducing positive charges that hinder 
aggregation, hydrophobic residues stabilizing binding interactions, and 
glutamine residues enhancing solubility and stability. These findings highlight 
gliadin hydrolysates, particularly G-Bro, as potential natural BACE1 inhibitors 
with applications in dietary interventions for AD prevention. However, further 
studies are warranted to elucidate specific peptide interactions and their 
bioactivity in neural pathways to better understand their therapeutic potential.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by 
progressive memory loss and other cognitive disturbances. Patients with AD can 
be vulnerable to vascular damage, and damaged vessels can lead to cognitive 
impairment. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) treatment has shown potential in 
ameliorating AD pathogenesis, but its effect on vascular function remains 
unclear. This study aimed to improve cognitive function by alleviating 
atherosclerosis-induced vessel damage using MSCs in mice with a genetic AD 
background. In this study, a 5xFAD mouse model of AD was used, and 
atherosclerotic vessel damage was induced by high-fat diets (HFDs). MSCs were 
injected into the tail vein along with mannitol in 5xFAD mice on an HFD. MSCs 
were detected in the brain, and vascular damage was improved following MSC 
treatment. Behavioral tests showed that MSCs enhanced cognitive function, as 
measured by the Y-maze and passive avoidance tests. Additionally, muscle 
strength measured by the rotarod test was also increased by MSCs in AD mice with 
vessel damage induced by HFDs. Overall, our results suggest that stem cells can 
alleviate vascular damage caused by metabolic diseases, including HFDs, and 
vascular disease in individuals carrying the AD gene. Consequently, this 
alleviates cognitive decline related to vascular dementia symptoms.

Mitragyna speciosa Korth. Havil (MS) has a traditional use in relieving pain, 
managing hypertension, treating cough, and diarrhea, and as a morphine 
substitute in addiction recovery. Its potential in addressing Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), a neurodegenerative condition with no effective treatments, is 
under investigation. This study aims to explore MS mechanisms in treating AD 
through network pharmacology, molecular docking, and in vitro studies. Using 
network pharmacology, we identified 19 MS components that may affect 60 
AD-related targets. The compound-target network highlighted significant 
interactions among 60 nodes and 470 edges, with an average node degree of 15.7. 
The KEGG enrichment analysis revealed Alzheimer's disease (hsa05010) as a 
relevant pathway. We connected 20 targets to tau and β-amyloid proteins through 
gene expression data from the AlzData database. Docking studies demonstrated 
high binding affinities of MS compounds like acetylursolic acid, 
beta-sitosterol, isomitraphylline, and speciophylline to AD-related proteins, 
such as AKT1, GSK3B, NFκB1, and BACE1. In vitro studies showed that ethanolic 
(EE), distilled water (DWE), and pressurized hot water (PHWE) extracts of 
MS-treated 100 μM H2O2-induced SH-SY5Y cells significantly reduced oxidative 
damage. This research underscores the multi-component, multi-target, and 
multi-pathway effects of MS on AD, providing insights for future research and 
potential clinical applications.

Metabolomics has come to the fore as an efficient tool in the search for 
biomarkers that are critical for precision health approaches and improved 
diagnostics. This review will outline recent advances in biomarker discovery 
based on metabolomics, focusing on metabolomics biomarkers reported in cancer, 
neurodegenerative disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and metabolic health. In 
cancer, metabolomics provides evidence for unique oncometabolites that are 
important for early disease detection and monitoring of treatment responses. 
Metabolite profiling for conditions such as neurodegenerative and mental health 
disorders can offer early diagnosis and mechanisms into the disease especially 
in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. In addition to these, lipid biomarkers 
and other metabolites relating to cardiovascular and metabolic disorders are 
promising for patient stratification and personalized treatment. The gut 
microbiome and environmental exposure also feature among the influential factors 
in biomarker discovery because they sculpt individual metabolic profiles, 
impacting overall health. Further, we discuss technological advances in 
metabolomics, current clinical applications, and the challenges faced by 
metabolomics biomarker validation toward precision medicine. Finally, this 
review discusses future opportunities regarding the integration of metabolomics 
into routine healthcare to enable preventive and personalized approaches.

Historically, microglial activation has been associated with diseases of a 
neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory nature. Some, like Alzheimer's disease, 
Parkinson's disease, and multiple system atrophy, have been explored 
extensively, while others pertaining to metabolism not so much. However, 
emerging evidence points to hypothalamic inflammation mediated by microglia as a 
driver of metabolic dysregulations, particularly insulin resistance and type 2 
diabetes mellitus. Here, we explore this connection further and examine pathways 
that underlie this relationship, including the IKKβ/NF-κβ, IRS-1/PI3K/Akt, 
mTOR-S6 Kinase, JAK/STAT, and PPAR-γ signaling pathways. We also investigate the 
role of non-coding RNAs, namely microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs, in insulin 
resistance related to neuroinflammation and their diagnostic and therapeutic 
potential. Finally, we explore therapeutics further, searching for both 
pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions that can help mitigate 
microglial activation.

Euphrasia officinalis L., commonly known as eyebright, is a medicinal plant used 
in folk medicine for eye disorders and memory loss. Due to its abundance of 
compounds with proven neuroprotective properties, there has been growing 
interest in exploring eyebright's potential health benefits, particularly for 
preventing or treating neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease. 
Here, seven distinct extracts were generated using solvents of different 
polarities, consecutively, from plants grown in Greece. The extracts were 
chemically characterized and assessed for their antioxidant, anticholinesterase, 
and anti-neurotoxic potentials. Our findings demonstrated eyebright's notable 
antioxidant capacity with five extracts exhibiting significant anti-neurotoxic 
properties by enhancing cell viability by 17.5 to 22.6% in human neuroblastoma 
cells exposed to neurotoxic amyloid-beta peptides. The ethyl acetate and 
butanolic extracts were the most effective across all assays, likely due to 
their high concentrations of active compounds. Therefore, eyebright may be 
harnessed for developing functional foods, supplements, and pharmaceuticals with 
potential benefits against Alzheimer's disease. This study marks the first 
identification of neuroprotective properties in a Euphrasia species, 
highlighting its broader therapeutic potential and paving the way for further 
research.

Mitochondrial dynamics significantly play a major role in the pathogenesis of 
neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. 
The dysregulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and function, characterized by 
impaired fission and fusion processes mediated by a number of proteins, in 
particular, Drp1, Mfn1, Mfn2, Opa1, and PGC-1α, contributes to neuronal 
vulnerability and degeneration. Insufficient mitophagy and disrupted 
mitochondrial transport exacerbate oxidative stress and neurotoxicity. Emerging 
therapeutic strategies that target mitochondrial dynamics, including various 
pharmacological agents, demonstrate potential for restoring mitochondrial 
balance and enhancing neuroprotection. This growing body of research underscores 
the importance of mitochondrial health in developing effective interventions for 
neurodegenerative conditions. This review highlights well-established links 
between the disruption of mitochondrial dynamics and the development of 
neurodegenerative processes. We also discuss different therapeutic strategies 
that target mitochondrial function in neurons that have been proposed as 
perspective neuroprotective treatments.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), a complex neurodegenerative disease (ND), is the most 
predominant cause of dementia among the elderly. Generally, elderly people have 
multiple chronic health conditions, like hypertension, arthritis, diabetes, 
insomnia, bowel problems, and depression. Although prescribed medications have 
beneficial therapeutic compositions, some may have side effects that could 
hinder cognitive function or worsen cognitive decline. Hence, we should evaluate 
those medications to guarantee their safety. In the present mechanistic review, 
we discussed frequently used categories of medication (analgesics, 
anticholinergics, benzodiazepines, proton pump inhibitors, and statins), 
concerning their possible involvement in increasing AD and dementia risks. This 
review summarized the results of various observational studies, meta-analyses, 
randomized case-control studies, and systematic reviews. As the results were 
contradictory, it was difficult to ascertain the clear associations between 
medication usage and increased risks of dementia or AD. The blood-based 
biomarkers (BBMs) offer a low-cost and accessible alternative for early 
diagnosis of AD. Systematic reviews combined with meta-analysis would be crucial 
tools for accurately assessing and summarizing the efficacy of health 
interventions, yet randomized clinical trials have always been the best way to 
help with clinical care decisions. Thus, an open discussion is necessary to help 
individuals determine whether the advantages of utilizing medications outweigh 
the possible drawbacks.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative pathology covering about 70% of 
all cases of dementia. It is associated with neuroinflammation and neuronal cell 
death, which are involved in disease progression. There is a lack of effective 
therapies, and halting this process represents a therapeutic challenge. Data in 
the literature suggest several neuroprotective effects of low-frequency, 
low-energy pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMFs) on biological systems, and 
clinical studies report that PEMF stimulation is safe and well tolerated. The 
aim of this work is to investigate the effects of PEMF exposure on oxidative 
stress and cell death in in vitro-injured cellular models of neurons and 
microglia. SH-SY5Y cells were stimulated by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or 
amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide, and N9 microglial cells were activated with 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or Aβ peptide. Reactive oxygen production, 
mitochondrial integrity, and cell death modulation were investigated through 
2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA) and 
5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1',3,3'-tetraethylbenzimidazolocarbo-cyanine iodide 
(JC-1) biochemical assays, fluorescence, and MTS experiments. Cells were exposed 
to PEMFs producing a pulsed signal with the following parameters: pulse duration 
of 1.3 ms and frequency of 75 Hz. The outcomes demonstrated that PEMFs defended 
SH-SY5Y cells against Aβ peptide- or H2O2-induced oxidative stress, 
mitochondrial damage, and cell death. Furthermore, in microglia activated by LPS 
or Aβ peptide, they reverted the reduction in mitochondrial potential, oxidative 
damage, and cell death. Overall, these findings imply that PEMFs influence the 
redox state of the cells by significantly boosting antioxidant levels in both 
injured microglia and neuronal in vitro cells mimicking in vitro AD.

A Novel 14mer Peptide Inhibits Autophagic Flux via Selective Activation of the 
mTORC1 Signalling Pathway: Implications for Alzheimer's Disease.

During development, a 14mer peptide, T14, modulates cell growth via the α-7 
nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7 nAChR). However, this process could become 
excitotoxic in the context of the adult brain, leading to pathologies such as 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent work shows that T14 acts selectively via the 
mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). This pathway is essential for 
normal development but is overactive in AD. The triggering of mTORC1 has also 
been associated with the suppression of autophagy, commonly observed in ageing 
and neurodegeneration. We therefore investigated the relationship between T14 
and autophagic flux in tissue cultures, mouse brain slices, and human 
Alzheimer's disease hippocampus. Here, we demonstrate that T14 and p-mTOR s2448 
expression significantly increases in AD human hippocampus, which was associated 
with the gradual decrease in the autophagosome number across Braak stages. 
During development, the reduction in T14 positively correlated with pTau 
(Ser202, Thr205) and two selective autophagy receptors: p62 and optineurin. In 
vitro studies also indicated that T14 increases p-mTOR s2448 expression, 
resulting in the aggregation of polyubiquinated substances. The effective 
blockade of T14 via its cyclic variant, NBP14, has been validated in vitro, in 
vivo, and ex vivo. In this study, NBP14 significantly attenuated p-mTOR s2448 
expression and restored normal autophagic flux, as seen with rapamycin. We 
conclude that T14 acts at the α-7 receptor to selectively activate the mTORC1 
pathway and consequently inhibit autophagic flux. Hence, this study describes a 
further step in the process by which T14 could drive neurodegeneration.

Multi-target-directed ligands (MTDLs) represent a promising frontier in tackling 
the complexity of multifactorial pathologies like Alzheimer's disease (AD). The 
synergistic inhibition of MAO-B, MAO-A, and AChE is believed to enhance 
treatment efficacy. A novel coumarin-based molecule substituted with 
O-phenylpiperazine via three- and four-carbon linkers at the 5- and 7-positions, 
has been identified as an effective MTDL against AD. Employing a medicinal 
chemistry approach, combined with molecular docking, molecular dynamic 
simulation, and ΔGbind estimation, two series of derivatives emerged as potent 
MTDLs: 8-acetyl-7-hydroxy-4-methylcoumarin (IC50: 1.52-4.95 μM for hAChE, 
6.97-7.65 μM for hMAO-A) and 4,7-dimethyl-5-hydroxycoumarin (IC50: 1.88-4.76 μM 
for hMAO-B). They displayed binding free energy (ΔGbind) of -76.32 kcal/mol (11) 
and -70.12 kcal/mol (12) against AChE and -66.27 kcal/mol (11) and -62.89 
kcal/mol (12) against MAO-A. It is noteworthy that compounds 11 and 12 
demonstrated efficient binding to both AChE and MAO-A, while compounds 3 and 10 
significantly reduced MAO-B and AChE aggregation in vitro. These findings 
provide structural templates for the development of dual MAO and AChE inhibitors 
for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

Numerous experimental studies suggest the potential for resveratrol (RVT) to be 
useful in the Alzheimer's disease treatment, but its low bioavailability limits 
its application. This study aimed to assess the potential of resveratrol-loaded 
micelles as a neuronal delivery platform to protect rats from 
scopolamine-induced memory impairment. Resveratrol was incorporated into 
Pluronic micelles, and the effects of micellar (mRVT) and pure resveratrol (RVT) 
were compared in the model of scopolamine-induced dementia in male Wistar rats. 
Memory performance was assessed by a T maze test. The effect of the treatment on 
specific neurotransmitter levels and protein expression in the cortex and the 
hippocampus were evaluated biochemically. Our results revealed that the 
polymeric micelles were in nanoscale (approximately 33 nm) and reached 79% 
encapsulation efficiency. The treatment with mRVT demonstrated better spatial 
memory protective effect. The biochemical assays showed that mRVT in a dose of 
10 mg/kg enhanced the effects of the pure drug in regard to noradrenalin 
neurotransmission and acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity in the 
hippocampus. Furthermore, micellar resveratrol increased the cAMP-response 
element-binding protein expression in the cortex and hippocampus of rats as well 
as the Bcl2/BAX ratio, which indicated an anti-apoptotic effect in the 
experimental dementia model. In conclusion, our results indicated the potential 
of a micellar system loaded with resveratrol for neurodegenerative diseases 
treatment.

Amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregates accumulate in the brains of individuals with 
Alzheimer's disease and are thought to potentially act as prions, promoting 
further aggregation. Consequently, the biochemistry of Aβ has emerged as a 
promising target for Alzheimer's disease. CAC-717, a suspension of calcium 
bicarbonate mesoscopic structures derived from natural sources, has been shown 
to inactivate various pathogens, including prions. This study examined the 
effects of CAC-717 on both the formation and degradation/dissociation of Aβ 
aggregates using thioflavin T fluorescence and enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assays. Aggregates of Aβ(1-42) peptide were generated by incubation at 37 °C for 
24 h, and the effect of introducing CAC-717 on the aggregates was evaluated 
after further incubation at 25 °C for 30 min. Moreover, CAC-717 was also tested 
for its ability to inhibit the initial aggregation of Aβ. The results showed 
that CAC-717 significantly degraded and/or dissociated Aβ aggregates in a 
concentration-dependent manner. Specifically, CAC-717 treatment for 5 min 
disrupted Aβ aggregates to give Aβ monomer and oligomer concentrations as high 
as 130 nM compared to ~10 nM for the water control. In addition, CAC-717 
degraded and/or dissociated aggregates within 10 s at 37 °C, and pre-treatment 
with CAC-717 significantly inhibited aggregation. These results suggest that 
CAC-717 not only degrades and/or dissociates Aβ aggregates but also inhibits 
their formation, highlighting its potential as a disinfectant for Alzheimer's 
disease.

The tryptophan-kynurenine (KYN) pathway has long been recognized for its 
essential role in generating metabolites that influence various physiological 
processes. Traditionally, these metabolites have been categorized into distinct, 
often opposing groups, such as pro-oxidant versus antioxidant, 
excitotoxic/neurotoxic versus neuroprotective. This dichotomous framework has 
shaped much of the research on conditions like neurodegenerative and 
neuropsychiatric disorders, as well as cancer, where metabolic imbalances are a 
key feature. The effects are significantly influenced by various factors, 
including the concentration of metabolites and the particular cellular milieu in 
which they are generated. A molecule that acts as neuroprotective at low 
concentrations may exhibit neurotoxic effects at elevated levels. The oxidative 
equilibrium of the surrounding environment can alter the function of KYN from an 
antioxidant to a pro-oxidant. This narrative review offers a comprehensive 
examination and analysis of the contemporary understanding of KYN metabolites, 
emphasizing their multifaceted biological functions and their relevance in 
numerous physiological and pathological processes. This underscores the pressing 
necessity for a paradigm shift in the comprehension of KYN metabolism. 
Understanding the context-dependent roles of KYN metabolites is vital for novel 
therapies in conditions like Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and 
cancer. Comprehensive pathway modulation, including balancing inflammatory 
signals and enzyme regulation, offers promising avenues for targeted, effective 
treatments.

Current and Potential Use of Biologically Active Compounds Derived from Cannabis 
sativa L. in the Treatment of Selected Diseases.

Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, Pomorska Street141/143, 90-236

Cannabis sativa L. contains numerous compounds with antioxidant and 
anti-inflammatory properties, including the flavonoids and the cannabinoids, 
particularly Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). Cannabinoids 
have an effect on the endocannabinoid system (ECS), a cellular communication 
network, and are, hence, widely studied for medical applications. Epidiolex®, a 
99% pure oral CBD extract, has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of 
epilepsy. Nabiximols (Sativex) is an oromucosal spray containing equal volume of 
THC and CBD, and it is commonly used as an add-on treatment for unresponsive 
spasticity in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Several in vitro and in vivo 
studies have also shown that cannabinoids can be used to treat various types of 
cancer, such as melanoma and brain glioblastoma; the first positive clinical 
trials on the anticancer effect of a THC:CBD blend with temozolomide (TMZ) in 
the treatment of highly invasive brain cancer are very promising. The 
cannabinoids exert their anticancer properties in in vitro investigations by the 
induction of cell death, mainly by apoptosis and cytotoxic autophagy, and the 
inhibition of cell proliferation. In several studies, cannabinoids have been 
found to induce tumor regression and inhibit angiogenic mechanisms in vitro and 
in vivo, as well as in two low-numbered epidemiological studies. They also 
exhibit antiviral effects by inhibiting ACE2 transcription, blocking viral 
replication and fusion, and acting as anti-inflammatory agents; indeed, prior 
CBD consumption (a study of 93,565 persons in Chicago) has also been associated 
with a much lower incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections. It is postulated that 
cannabis extracts can be used in the treatment of many other diseases such as 
systemic lupus erythematosus, type 1 diabetes, or various types of neurological 
disorders, e.g., Alzheimer's disease. The aim of this review is to outline the 
current state of knowledge regarding currently used medicinal preparations 
derived from C. sativa L. in the treatment of selected cancer and viral 
diseases, and to present the latest research on the potential applications of 
its secondary metabolites.

Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, ALS, and 
Huntington's, remain formidable challenges in medicine, with their relentless 
progression and limited therapeutic options. These diseases arise from a web of 
molecular disturbances-misfolded proteins, chronic neuroinflammation, 
mitochondrial dysfunction, and genetic mutations-that slowly dismantle neuronal 
integrity. Yet, recent scientific breakthroughs are opening new paths to 
intervene in these once-intractable conditions. This review synthesizes the 
latest insights into the underlying molecular dynamics of neurodegeneration, 
revealing how intertwined pathways drive the course of these diseases. With an 
eye on the most promising advances, we explore innovative therapies emerging 
from cutting-edge research: nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems capable 
of navigating the blood-brain barrier, gene-editing tools like CRISPR designed 
to correct harmful genetic variants, and stem cell strategies that not only 
replace lost neurons but foster neuroprotective environments. Pharmacogenomics 
is reshaping treatment personalization, enabling tailored therapies that align 
with individual genetic profiles, while molecular diagnostics and biomarkers are 
ushering in an era of early, precise disease detection. Furthermore, novel 
perspectives on the gut-brain axis are sparking interest as mounting evidence 
suggests that microbiome modulation may play a role in reducing 
neuroinflammatory responses linked to neurodegenerative progression. Taken 
together, these advances signal a shift toward a comprehensive, personalized 
approach that could transform neurodegenerative care. By integrating molecular 
insights and innovative therapeutic techniques, this review offers a 
forward-looking perspective on a future where treatments aim not just to manage 
symptoms but to fundamentally alter disease progression, presenting renewed hope 
for improved patient outcomes.

Neurodegenerative diseases, characterized by neuron loss, are a group of 
neurological disorders that adversely affect the lives of millions of people 
worldwide. Although several medicines have been approved for managing 
neurodegenerative diseases, new therapies allowing for a significant slowdown in 
the progression of neurodegenerative syndromes are constantly being sought. 
Magnesium (Mg), a crucial mineral necessary for the functioning of organisms, is 
important to normal central nervous system (CNS) activity. Although the effects 
of this bioelement on the CNS are relatively well recognized, its role in the 
pathophysiology of neurological disorders in humans is not yet well 
characterized. Therefore, the main goal of this review is to collect data about 
a possible association between Mg and neurodegenerative disorders such as 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's Disease (PD), and Amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis (ALS) in humans. Hence, the levels of Mg in blood, cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF), urine, and hair from subjects with AD, PD, and ALS are compiled to detect 
possible variations in the levels of this mineral in the biological specimens of 
people with neurodegenerative illnesses. Additionally, the findings from an 
animal model are summarized to offer the reader a deeper insight into studies on 
Mg in the context of neuroprotection and neurodegeneration. Data provided in the 
present review indicate that Mg, due to its neuroprotective, antioxidant, 
anti-inflammatory, and mitochondrial-supportive properties, could be a potential 
therapeutic agent for AD, PD, and ALS. However, more epidemiological studies 
with standardized methods of dietary assessment and Mg measurement are necessary 
to recognize its exact role in neurodegenerative disorders. Moreover, extensive 
well-designed clinical trials are also needed to establish definitive 
therapeutic protocols and optimal dosages, and to ensure long-term safety of 
this mineral supplementation in AD, PD, and ALS patients.

Amyloid beta (Aβ) is a neuronal metabolic product that plays an important role 
in maintaining brain homeostasis. Normally, intensive brain Aβ formation is 
accompanied by its effective lymphatic removal. However, the excessive 
accumulation of brain Aβ is observed with age and during the development of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) leading to cognitive impairment and memory deficits. 
There is emerging evidence that plasmalogens (Pls), as one of the key brain 
lipids, may be beneficial for AD and cognitive aging. Here, we studied the 
effects of Pls on cognitive functions and the lymphatic clearance of Aβ from the 
brain of AD mice and mice of different ages. The results showed that Pls 
effectively reduce brain Aβ levels and facilitate learning in aged but not old 
mice. In AD mice, Pls improve the lymphatic clearance of Aβ that is accompanied 
by an increase in general motor activity and an improvement of the emotional 
status and learning ability. Thus, these findings suggest that Pls could be a 
promising candidate for the alternative or concomitant therapy of AD and 
age-related brain diseases to enhance the lymphatic clearance of Aβ from the 
brain and cognitive functions.

This review explores recent advancements in gene therapy as a potential 
treatment for neurodegenerative diseases, focusing on intervention mechanisms, 
administration routes, and associated limitations. Following the PRISMA 
procedure guidelines, we systematically analyzed studies published since 2020 
using the PICO framework to derive reliable conclusions. The efficacy of various 
gene therapies was evaluated for Parkinson's disease (n = 12), spinal muscular 
atrophy (n = 8), Huntington's disease (n = 3), Alzheimer's disease (n = 3), and 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (n = 6). For each condition, we assessed the 
therapeutic approach, curative or disease-modifying potential, delivery methods, 
advantages, drawbacks, and side effects. Results indicate that gene therapies 
targeting specific genes are particularly effective in monogenic disorders, with 
promising clinical outcomes expected in the near future. In contrast, in 
polygenic diseases, therapies primarily aim to promote cell survival. A major 
challenge remains: the translation of animal model success to human clinical 
application. Additionally, while intracerebral delivery methods enhance 
therapeutic efficacy, they are highly invasive. Despite these hurdles, gene 
therapy represents a promising frontier in the treatment of neurodegenerative 
diseases, underscoring the need for continued research to refine and personalize 
treatments for each condition.

Glutamate: Molecular Mechanisms and Signaling Pathway in Alzheimer's Disease, a 
Potential Therapeutic Target.

Gamma-glutamate is an important excitatory neurotransmitter in the central 
nervous system (CNS), which plays an important role in transmitting synapses, 
plasticity, and other brain activities. Nevertheless, alterations in the 
glutamatergic signaling pathway are now accepted as a central element in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology. One of the most prevalent types of 
dementia in older adults is AD, a progressive neurodegenerative illness brought 
on by a persistent decline in cognitive function. Since AD has been shown to be 
multifactorial, a variety of pharmaceutical targets may be used to treat the 
condition. N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR) antagonists and 
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) are two drug classes that the Food and 
Drug Administration has authorized for the treatment of AD. The AChEIs approved 
to treat AD are galantamine, donepezil, and rivastigmine. However, memantine is 
the only non-competitive NMDAR antagonist that has been authorized for the 
treatment of AD. This review aims to outline the involvement of glutamate (GLU) 
at the molecular level and the signaling pathways that are associated with AD to 
demonstrate the drug target therapeutic potential of glutamate and its receptor. 
We will also consider the opinion of the leading authorities working in this 
area, the drawback of the existing therapeutic strategies, and the direction for 
the further investigation.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) has long proven to be a complex neurodegenerative 
disorder, with cholinergic dysfunction, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation 
being just a few of its pathological features. The complexity of the disease 
requires a multitargeted treatment covering its many aspects. In the present 
investigation, an arylhydrazone derivative of 5-methoxyindole-2-carboxylic acid 
(5MeO), with in vitro strong antioxidant, neuroprotective and monoamine oxidase 
B-inhibiting effects, was studied in a scopolamine-induced Alzheimer-type 
dementia in rats. Using behavioral and biochemical methods, we evaluated the 
effects of 5MeO on learning and memory, and elucidated the mechanisms of these 
effects. Our experiments demonstrated that 5MeO had a beneficial effect on 
different types of memory as assessed by the step-through and the Barnes maze 
tasks. It efficiently restored the decreased by scopolamine brain-derived 
neurotrophic factor and acetylcholine levels and normalized the increased by 
scopolamine acetylcholine esterase activity in hippocampus. Most effective 5MeO 
was in counteracting the induced by scopolamine oxidative stress by decreasing 
the increased by scopolamine levels of lipid peroxidation and by increasing the 
reduced by scopolamine catalase activity. Blood biochemical analyses 
demonstrated a favorable safety profile of 5MeO, prompting further 
pharmacological studies suggesting 5MeO as a safe and efficient candidate in a 
multitargeted treatment of AD.

This study focuses on the use of three isostructural N6O donor ligands, 
specifically known to form complexes with copper ions, to chelate Cu(II) from 
aqueous solutions. The corresponding Cu(II) complexes feature a dinuclear copper 
core mimicking the active site of natural superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzymes 
while also creating a coordination environment favorable for catalase (CAT) 
activity, being thus appealing as catalytic antioxidant systems. Given the 
critical role of copper dysregulation in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), these complexes may help mitigate the harmful effects of free 
Cu(II) ions: the goal is to transform copper's reactive oxygen species 
(ROS)-generating properties into beneficial ROS-scavenging action. This study 
investigates the speciation, chelating efficiency, and metal selectivity of 
these ligands, as well as the antioxidant activity of the resulting complexes 
under aqueous and physiologically relevant conditions. Additionally, the 
ligands, equipped with functional groups for attaching targeting moieties, are 
conjugated with a small peptide that may act as an anti-aggregating agent of 
β-amyloid peptides, aiming to develop a multifunctional therapeutic strategy 
against Alzheimer's disease.

Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease 
(PD), and Huntington's disease (HD) have become a major global health burden, 
but the detailed pathogeneses of neurodegenerative diseases are still unknown, 
and current treatments are mainly aimed at controlling symptoms; there are no 
curative treatments for neurodegenerative diseases or treatments for the 
progressive cognitive, behavioral, and functional impairments that they cause. 
Studies have shown that some plant extracts with pungent flavor components have 
a certain neuroprotective effect in neurodegenerative diseases, and their 
mechanisms mainly involve inhibiting neuronal apoptosis, promoting neuronal 
regeneration, reducing mitochondrial degeneration, and reducing the production 
of oxides such as reactive oxygen species in cells, which are of great 
significance for exploring the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. In this 
review, we searched the PubMed database for relevant literature collected in the 
past 15 years. Finally, we summarized the protective effects of pungent flavor 
components such as capsaicin, piperine, curcumin, cannabinoids, allicin, and 
nicotine on the nervous system, focusing on the molecular mechanisms and 
signaling pathways that they activate. In addition, we also compiled and 
summarized the laboratory experiments, preclinical experiments, and effects of 
various pungent flavor components in neurodegenerative diseases. The goal is to 
further explore their potential as effective drugs for the treatment of 
neurodegenerative diseases and provide new ideas for further research on the 
specific protective mechanisms of these substances for the treatment of 
neurodegenerative diseases and the targets of drug action in the future.

Diversity of Microglia-Derived Molecules with Neurotrophic Properties That 
Support Neurons in the Central Nervous System and Other Tissues.

Microglia, the brain immune cells, support neurons by producing several 
established neurotrophic molecules including glial cell line-derived 
neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Modern 
analytical techniques have identified numerous phenotypic states of microglia, 
each associated with the secretion of a diverse set of substances, which likely 
include not only canonical neurotrophic factors but also other less-studied 
molecules that can interact with neurons and provide trophic support. In this 
review, we consider the following eight such candidate cytokines: oncostatin M 
(OSM), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), activin A, colony-stimulating factor 
(CSF)-1, interleukin (IL)-34, growth/differentiation factor (GDF)-15, fibroblast 
growth factor (FGF)-2, and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-2. The available 
literature provides sufficient evidence demonstrating murine cells produce these 
cytokines and that they exhibit neurotrophic activity in at least one neuronal 
model. Several distinct types of neurotrophic activity are identified that only 
partially overlap among the cytokines considered, reflecting either their 
distinct intrinsic properties or lack of comprehensive studies covering the full 
spectrum of neurotrophic effects. The scarcity of human-specific studies is 
another significant knowledge gap revealed by this review. Further studies on 
these potential microglia-derived neurotrophic factors are warranted since they 
may be used as targeted treatments for diverse neurological disorders.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The genus Ferula has been traditionally used for the 
treatment of various illnesses, but the potential of Ferula persica var. 
latisecta against different Alzheimer's disease (AD) hallmarks has never been 
achieved.
METHODS: In this work, a pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) method was 
optimized to extract F. persica L. aerial parts and roots. Four different 
solvents (water, ethanol, ethyl acetate (EtAc), and cyclopentyl methyl ether 
(CPME)) were first tested, and the extraction yield, total phenolic content, 
reactive oxygen species scavenging capacity, and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) 
inhibition activity were evaluated.
RESULTS: The results indicated that EtAc and CPME were the best solvents to be 
used, with the results obtained from the aerial parts being better than those 
obtained from the root samples. Thereafter, the PLE method was further optimized 
by combining these solvents in different percentages (100% EtAc, 100% CPME, and 
50:50% (v/v) EtAc:CPME) and temperatures (50, 115, and 180 °C). Response surface 
methodology was then applied to analyze the data, and two optimum extraction 
conditions were obtained: EtAc:CPME (79:21%) at 180 °C for the aerial parts and 
100% CPME at 180 °C for the roots. At these conditions, the total flavonoid 
content (TFC) and the inhibitory capacities against butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) 
and lipoxygenase (LOX) enzymes were also evaluated, indicating that the aerial 
part extracts had higher TFC and LOX inhibitory capacity than the root extracts 
but lower activity against BChE. The comprehensive LC/GC-MS chemical 
characterization allowed for the tentative identification of 222 compounds 
belonging to 66 chemical subclasses, the abundancies of which widely varied 
depending on the matrix and the extraction conditions used.
CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained together with the application of advanced 
statistical analysis and molecular docking simulations suggested several 
sesquiterpenoids, such as selina-3,7(11)-diene, guaiol acetate, α-cyperone, and 
farnesyl acetate, as the molecules responsible of the in vitro results observed, 
with good neuroprotective potential against AD.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common 
neurodegenerative diseases, for which a definitive cure is still missing. 
Recently, natural compounds have been investigated for their possible 
neuroprotective role, including the bioactivated product of glucoraphanin (GRA), 
the sulforaphane (SFN), which is highly rich in cruciferous vegetables. It is 
known that SFN alleviates neuronal dysfunction, apoptosis, and oxidative stress 
in the brain. In the light of this evidence, the aim of this study was to 
investigate the molecular effects of SFN pre-treatment in differentiated SH-SY5Y 
neurons exposed to β-amyloid (Aβ).
METHODS: To this end, we first evaluated first cell viability via the Thiazolyl 
Blue Tetrazolium Bromide (MTT) assay, and then we analyzed the transcriptomic 
profiles by next-generation sequencing (NGS). Finally, we used a network 
analysis in order to understand which biological processes are affected, 
validating them by Western blot assay.
RESULTS: SFN pre-treatment counteracted Aβ-induced loss of cell viability. The 
network-transcriptomic analysis revealed that SFN upregulates genes associated 
with DNA repair, such as ABRAXAS1, BRCA1, BRCA2, CDKN1A, FANCA, FANCD2, FANCE, 
NBN, and XPC. Finally, SFN also increased the phosphorylation of AKT, which is 
associated with DNA repair and cell survival.
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that SFN is a natural compound that could be 
suitable in the prevention of AD, thanks to its neuroprotective role in 
increasing cell survival, potentially restoring DNA damage induced by Aβ 
exposure.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Alzheimer's disease (AD), a leading cause of dementia, 
lacks effective long-term treatments. Current therapies offer temporary relief 
or fail to halt its progression and are often inaccessible due to cost. AD 
involves multiple pathological processes, including amyloid beta (Aβ) 
deposition, insulin resistance, tau protein hyperphosphorylation, and systemic 
inflammation accelerated by gut microbiota dysbiosis originating from a leaky 
gut. Given this context, exploring alternative therapeutic interventions capable 
of addressing the multifaceted components of AD etiology is essential.
METHODS: This study suggests D-Pinitol (DPIN) as a potential treatment modifier 
for AD. DPIN, derived from carob pods, demonstrates insulin-sensitizing, tau 
hyperphosphorylation inhibition, and antioxidant properties. To test this 
hypothesis, we studied whether chronic oral administration of DPIN (200 
mg/kg/day) could reverse the AD-like disease progression in the 5×FAD mice.
RESULTS: Results showed that treatment of 5×FAD mice with DPIN improved 
cognition, reduced hippocampal Aβ and hyperphosphorylated tau levels, increased 
insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) expression, enhanced pro-cognitive hormone 
circulation (such as ghrelin and leptin), and normalized the PI3K/Akt insulin 
pathway. This enhancement may be mediated through the modulation of 
cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5). DPIN also protected the gut barrier and 
microbiota, reducing the pro-inflammatory impact of the leaky gut observed in 
5×FAD mice. DPIN reduced bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and LPS-associated 
inflammation, as well as restored intestinal proteins such as Claudin-3. This 
effect was associated with a modulation of gut microbiota towards a more 
balanced bacterial composition.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore DPIN's promise in mitigating cognitive 
decline in the early AD stages, positioning it as a potential disease modifier.

Sirtuins (SIRTs), nicotine adenine dinucleotide (+)-dependent histone 
deacetylases, have emerged as critical regulators in many signalling pathways 
involved in a wide range of biological processes. Currently, seven mammalian 
SIRTs have been characterized and are found across a number of cellular 
compartments. There has been considerable interest in the role of SIRTs in the 
brain due to their role in a plethora of metabolic- and age-related diseases, 
including their involvement in learning and memory function in physiological and 
pathophysiological conditions. Although cognitive function declines over the 
course of healthy ageing, neurological disorders including Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) can be associated with progressive cognitive impairments. This review aimed 
to report and integrate recent advances in the understanding of the role of 
SIRTs in cognitive function and dysfunction in the context of AD. We have also 
reviewed the use of selective and/or natural SIRT activators as potential 
therapeutic agents and/or adjuvants for AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex multifactorial neurodegenerative disease. 
With the escalating aging of the global population, the societal burden of this 
disease is increasing. Although drugs are available for the treatment of AD, 
their efficacy is limited and there remains no effective cure. Therefore, the 
identification of safe and effective prevention and treatment strategies is 
urgently needed. Functional factors in foods encompass a variety of natural and 
safe bioactive substances that show potential in the prevention and treatment of 
AD. However, current research focused on the use of these functional factors for 
the prevention and treatment of AD is in its initial stages, and a complete 
theoretical and application system remains to be determined. An increasing 
number of recent studies have found that functional factors such as polyphenols, 
polysaccharides, unsaturated fatty acids, melatonin, and caffeine have positive 
effects in delaying the progression of AD and improving cognitive function. For 
example, polyphenols exhibit antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective 
effects, and polysaccharides promote neuronal growth and inhibit inflammation 
and oxidative stress. Additionally, unsaturated fatty acids inhibit Aβ 
production and Tau protein phosphorylation and reduce neuroinflammation, and 
melatonin has been shown to protect nerve cells and improve cognitive function 
by regulating mitochondrial homeostasis and autophagy. Caffeine has also been 
shown to inhibit inflammation and reduce neuronal damage. Future research should 
further explore the mechanisms of action of these functional factors and develop 
relevant functional foods or nutritional supplements to provide new strategies 
and support for the prevention and treatment of AD.

The present study investigates the chemical profile and biological activities of 
Polygonum istanbulicum M. Keskin, a species endemic to Turkey, aiming to explore 
its potential applications in pharmacology. We assessed its phenolic and 
flavonoid content by employing ethyl acetate, methanol, and water as extraction 
solvents. The methanol extract demonstrated the highest concentrations of these 
compounds, with liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass 
spectrometry (LC-MS-qTOF) analysis identifying a wide range of bioactive 
substances, such as derivatives of quercetin and myricetin. Antioxidant capacity 
was evaluated using 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 
2,2'-Azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS), 
cupric-reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC), ferric-reducing antioxidant power 
(FRAP), and phosphomolybdenum assays, with the methanol extract showing the most 
potent activity (DPPH: 892.22 mg Trolox equivalent (TE)/g; ABTS: 916.21 mg TE/g; 
CUPRAC: 1082.69 mg TE/g; FRAP: 915.05 mg TE/g). Enzyme inhibition assays 
highlighted the efficacy of P. istanbulicum extracts against key enzymes, with 
potential implications for managing Alzheimer's disease, hyperpigmentation, and 
type 2 diabetes. Cytotoxicity tests against various cancer cell lines showed 
notable activity, particularly with the aqueous extract on the HGC-27 cell line 
(IC50: 29.21 µg/mL), indicating potential for targeted anti-cancer therapy. 
Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations further supported the 
binding affinities of quercetin and myricetin derivatives to cancer-related 
proteins, suggesting significant therapeutic potential. This study underscores 
the value of P. istanbulicum as a source of bioactive compounds with 
applications in antioxidant, anti-cancer, and enzyme-inhibitory treatments.

The Azorean Cryptomeria japonica forest operations and wood industry generate 
considerable foliage biomass residues that are used for local essential oil (EO) 
production. However, research on seasonal variation of C. japonica EO remains 
scarce. In this study, the EOs from fresh Azorean C. japonica foliage (Az-CJF) 
collected in autumn (Aut) and spring (Spr) were obtained via hydrodistillation 
and investigated for their physical properties, yield, chemical composition, and 
bioactivities. Both EOs presented a strong odor, a yellowish color, a density 
around 0.9 g·mL-1, and similar yields (approximately 1% v/w, dry matter). 
Nevertheless, the GC-MS analyses showed a decrease in monoterpene hydrocarbons 
(MH) and an increase in oxygenated sesquiterpenes (OS) contents in Spr-EO 
compared with Aut-EO (16% vs. 35% for MH and 45% vs. 31% for OS, respectively). 
In addition, the predominant components were kaur-16-ene (23%) for Spr-EO and 
phyllocladene (19%) for Aut-EO, revealing that both EOs were rich in diterpene 
hydrocarbons (29% vs. 26%). Concerning its toxicity against brine shrimp, a low 
mortality (0-38%) was observed at a concentration range of 100-180 μg·mL-1. 
Regarding the anti-cholinesterase properties, both EOs were inactive against 
acetylcholinesterase but showed anti-butyrylcholinesterase activity superior to 
(-)-α-pinene, a major compound of Az-CJF EO (IC50 values: 84, 148, and 648 
μg·mL-1 for Spr-EO, Aut-EO, and α-pinene, respectively). Overall, the results 
indicate the potential benefit of both seasonal EOs in Alzheimer's disease 
treatment. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that season strongly 
influences the Az-CJF EO quantitative composition and thus its bioactivity, 
aiding in the selection of the most high-quality raw materials for use in 
Azorean C. japonica EO aromatherapy industry.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), a major neurodegenerative disorder, is characterized 
by the progressive accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, leading to cognitive 
decline. Despite the existing treatments, their limited efficacy highlights the 
urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies. The present study investigates the 
neuroprotective effects of a grape seed polyphenol extract (GSPE) on transgenic 
Caenorhabditis elegans models specifically expressing human Aβ proteins. The 
obtained results show that GSPE not only significantly attenuates Aβ-induced 
paralysis but also extends the lifespan and improves sensory responses in these 
models, suggesting improved neural function and overall health. Additionally, 
GSPE treatment reduces proteasomal activity, which could lead to a reduction in 
the accumulation of misfolded proteins. It also modulates the expression of key 
genes involved in autophagy and proteostasis, thereby enhancing cellular 
mechanisms to manage protein aggregation and combat oxidative stress. On the 
whole, these findings support the potential of grape seed procyanidins (the main 
components in the extract) to be used as an effective dietary approach to 
mitigate Alzheimer's disease pathology through the modulation of critical 
neuroprotective pathways.

Viral infections leading to inflammation have been implicated in several common 
diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and type 1 diabetes (T1D). Of note, 
herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) has been reported to be associated with AD. We 
sought to identify the transcriptomic changes due to HSV-1 infection and 
anti-viral drug (acyclovir, ACV) treatment of HSV-1 infection in dissociated 
cells from human cerebral organoids (dcOrgs) versus stem cell-derived pancreatic 
islets (sc-islets) to gain potential biological insights into the relevance of 
HSV-1-induced inflammation in AD and T1D. We observed that differentially 
expressed genes (DEGs) in HSV-1-infected sc-islets were enriched for genes 
associated with several autoimmune diseases, most significantly, T1D, but also 
rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, Crohn's disease, and multiple sclerosis, 
whereas DEGs in HSV-1-infected dcOrgs were exclusively enriched for genes 
associated with AD. The ACV treatment of sc-islets was not as effective in 
rescuing transcript perturbations of autoimmune disease-associated genes. 
Finally, we identified gene ontology categories that were enriched for DEGs that 
were in common across, or unique to, viral treatment of dcOrgs and sc-islets, 
such as categories involved in the transferase complex, mitochondrial, and 
autophagy function. In addition, we compared transcriptomic signatures from 
HSV-1-infected sc-islets with sc-islets that were infected with the coxsackie B 
virus (CVB) that had been associated with T1D pathogenesis. Collectively, this 
study provides tissue-specific insights into the molecular effects of 
inflammation in AD and T1D.

Enhancement of neuronal plasticity by small-molecule therapeutics protects 
cognitive skills and also ameliorates progressive neurodegenerative pathologies 
like Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia. One such compound, a novel histone 
deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) inhibitor named JRM-28, was shown here to enhance 
dendritic strength, augment spine density, and upregulate post-synaptic 
neurotransmission in hippocampal neurons. The molecular basis for this effect 
correlates with JRM-28-induced upregulation of the transcription of cAMP 
response element-binding protein(CREB), induction of its transcriptional 
activity, and subsequent stimulation of expressions of CREB-dependent 
plasticity-associated genes, such as those encoding N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) 
receptor subunit NR2A and the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic 
acid (AMPA) receptor subunit GluR1. Specifically, JRM-28 stimulated the NMDA- 
and AMPA-receptor-sensitive ionotropic calcium influx in hippocampal neurons. 
Interestingly, JRM-28 did not induce NMDA- and AMPA-sensitive calcium influx in 
hippocampal neurons once the expression of CREB was knocked down by creb siRNA, 
suggesting the critical role of CREB in JRM-28-mediated upregulation of synaptic 
plasticity. Finally, JRM-28 upregulated CREB mRNA, CREB-dependent 
plasticity-associated markers, and ionotropic calcium influx in iPSC-derived AD 
human neurons, indicating its therapeutic implications in the amelioration of AD 
pathologies.

Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly 
population (aged 65 years and over), followed by vascular dementia, Lewy body 
dementia, and rare types of neurodegenerative diseases, including frontotemporal 
dementia. There is an unmet need to improve diagnosis and prognosis for patients 
with dementia, as cycles of misdiagnosis and diagnostic delays are challenging 
scenarios in neurodegenerative diseases. Neuroimaging is routinely used in 
clinical practice to support the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. 
Clinical neuroimaging is amenable to errors owing to varying human judgement as 
the imaging data are complex and multidimensional. Artificial intelligence 
algorithms (machine learning and deep learning) enable automation of 
neuroimaging interpretation and may reduce potential bias and ameliorate 
clinical decision-making. Graph convolutional network-based frameworks 
implicitly provide multimodal sparse interpretability to support the detection 
of Alzheimer's disease and its prodromal stage, mild cognitive impairment. In 
patients with amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, radiologists had 
significantly better detection performances with both ARIA-E (sensitivity higher 
in the assisted/deep learning method [87%] compared to unassisted [71%]) and for 
ARIA-H signs (sensitivity was higher in assisted [79%] compared to unassisted 
[69%]). A convolutional neural network method was developed, and external 
validation predicted final clinical diagnoses of Alzheimer's disease, dementia 
with Lewy bodies, mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease, or 
cognitively normal with FDG-PET. The translation of artificial intelligence to 
clinical practice is plagued with technical, disease-related, and institutional 
challenges. The implementation of artificial intelligence methods in clinical 
practice has the potential to transform the diagnostic and treatment landscape 
and improve patient health and outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Regular physical activity plays a crucial role in modulating 
cellular metabolism and mitigating the progression of neurodegenerative diseases 
such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Multiple Sclerosis.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review is to evaluate the molecular mechanisms 
by which exercise influences cellular metabolism, with a focus on its potential 
as a therapeutic intervention for neurological disorders.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature review was conducted using peer-reviewed 
scientific articles, with a focus on the period between 2015 and 2024, to 
analyze the effects of exercise on mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, and 
metabolic health.
RESULTS: The findings indicate that exercise promotes mitochondrial biogenesis, 
enhances oxidative phosphorylation, and reduces reactive oxygen species, 
contributing to improved energy production and cellular resilience. These 
metabolic adaptations are associated with delayed disease progression and 
reduced symptoms in patients with neurodegenerative conditions. Additionally, 
integrating exercise with nutritional strategies may further enhance therapeutic 
outcomes by addressing metabolic disturbances comprehensively.
CONCLUSIONS: This review concludes that personalized exercise protocols should 
be developed to optimize metabolic benefits for patients with neurological 
diseases, while future research should focus on biomarker development for 
individualized treatment approaches. These findings highlight the importance of 
non-pharmacological interventions in managing neurodegenerative diseases.

The immune system plays a major part in neurodegenerative diseases. In some, 
such as multiple sclerosis, it is the primary driver of the disease. In others, 
such as Alzheimer disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinson disease, 
it has an amplifying role. Immunotherapeutic approaches that target the adaptive 
and innate immune systems are being explored for the treatment of almost all 
neurological diseases, and the targets and approaches are often common across 
diseases. Microglia are the primary immune cells in the brain that contribute to 
disease pathogenesis, and are consequently a common immune target for therapy. 
Other therapeutic approaches target components of the peripheral immune system, 
such as regulatory T cells and monocytes, which in turn act within the CNS. This 
Review considers in detail how microglia, monocytes and T cells contribute to 
the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer disease, amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis and Parkinson disease, and their potential as shared therapeutic 
targets across these diseases. The microbiome is also highlighted as an emerging 
therapeutic target that indirectly modulates the immune system. Therapeutic 
approaches being developed to target immune function in neurodegenerative 
diseases are discussed, highlighting how immune-based approaches developed to 
treat one disease could be applicable to multiple other neurological diseases.

Sensitive and accurate detection of the amyloid-β (Aβ) monomer is of fundamental 
significance for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Herein, inspired 
by the specific Cu-Aβ monomer coordination, a cutting-edge colorimetric assay 
based on single-atom Cu anchored N-doped carbon nanospheres (Cu-NCNSs) was 
developed for Aβ monomer detection and an amyloidogenesis study. By directly 
pyrolyzing Cu2+-incorporated covalent organic frameworks (COFs), the resulting 
Cu-NCNSs with a high loading of Cu (8.04 wt %) exhibited outstanding 
peroxidase-like activity. The strong binding affinity of Aβ monomer to Cu-NCNSs 
effectively inhibited their catalytic activity, providing the basis for the 
colorimetric assay. The Cu-NCNSs-based sensor showed a detection limit of 
1.182 nM for Aβ monomer, surpassing traditional techniques in terms of 
efficiency, accuracy and simplicity. Moreover, the system was successfully 
utilized for Aβ monomer detection in rat cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Notably, the 
distinct inhibitory effects of monomeric and aggregated Aβ species on the 
catalytic activity of Cu-NCNSs were allowed for monitoring of the dynamic 
aggregation process of Aβ. Compared to thioflavin T (ThT), the most widely used 
amyloid dye, the detection system exhibited greater sensitivity towards toxic Aβ 
oligomers, which was crucial for early AD diagnosis and treatment. Our work not 
only sheds light on the rational design of highly active single-atom nanozymes 
from COFs but also expands the potential applications of nanozymes in early 
disease diagnosis.

Microorganisms in the gut play a pivotal role in human health, influencing 
various pathophysiological processes. Certain microorganisms are particularly 
essential for maintaining intestinal homeostasis, reducing inflammation, 
supporting nervous system function, and regulating metabolic processes. 
Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are a subset of fatty acids produced by the gut 
microbiota (GM) during the fermentation of indigestible polysaccharides. The 
interaction between GM and SCFAs is inherently bidirectional: the GM not only 
shapes SCFAs composition and metabolism but SCFAs also modulate microbiota's 
diversity, stability, growth, proliferation, and metabolism. Recent research has 
shown that GM and SCFAs communicate through various pathways, mainly involving 
mechanisms related to inflammation and immune responses, intestinal barrier 
function, the gut-brain axis, and metabolic regulation. An imbalance in GM and 
SCFA homeostasis can lead to the development of several chronic diseases, 
including inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal cancer, systemic lupus 
erythematosus, Alzheimer's disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. This review 
explores the synergistic interactions between GM and SCFAs, and how these 
interactions directly or indirectly influence the onset and progression of 
various diseases through the regulation of the mechanisms mentioned above.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: In the realm of traditional Chinese medicine, 
Panax quinquefolius L. has garnered significant attention for its potential to 
treat various ailments associated with deficiencies, including qi, blood, and 
kidneys. As its primary bioactive constituent, Panax quinquefolius saponins 
(PQS) have the potential therapeutic role of Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment, 
but with unclear mechanisms of action. Meanwhile, AD is considered as a common 
dementia disease with kidney insufficiency and deficiency by traditional 
medicine, and often accompanied by autophagy in modern medical research.
AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects of PQS 
on AD through the regulation of mitophagy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The chemical constituents of PQS were characterized using 
the UPLC-QTOF-MS technique. After that, the HT22 cell line was used to establish 
the D-galactose-induced cell model, and the SAMP8 mice model of AD was also 
employed. Cell viability was assessed using the CCK-8 assay, ROS detection, JC-1 
staining, Mito-tracker Red and LC3 staining, and Mito-tracker Green and 
Lyso-tracker Red staining were used to assess levels of mitophagy. The Morris 
Water Maze (MWM) was used for the experimental evaluation of learning and memory 
abilities in mice. Subsequently, the mechanism was studied by pathological 
staining and western blotting.
RESULTS: Fifty-eight triterpenoid saponins were identified from PQS, and PQS 
alleviated D-galactose-induced HT22 cell death and increased intracellular 
levels of mitochondrial autophagy-related factors. In vivo, PQS significantly 
improved cognitive deficits and mitigated AD-like pathological features by 
activating the mitophagy mechanism. Furthermore, PQS may promote 
Pink1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy by activating the AMPK/mTOR/ULK1/DRP1 and 
SIRT1/PGC-1α pathways.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, PQS have demonstrated the potential to mitigate 
mitochondrial dysfunction and enhance cognitive function in AD through the 
activation of mitophagy. This promising strategy holds great promise for the 
treatment of AD.

Hypertension poses a significant risk to cognition-related disorders like 
dementia. As the global population ages, age-related neurological illnesses such 
as Alzheimer's disease are becoming increasingly prevalent. The primary 
hypertension treatments, angiotensin receptor blockers, and 
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, exhibit neuroprotective properties. 
However, observational studies suggest that they may independently contribute to 
cognitive decline and dementia. Some of these medications have shown promise in 
reducing cognitive impairment and amyloid buildup in Alzheimer's models. While 
direct comparisons between the two drug classes are limited, angiotensin 
receptor blockers have been associated with less brain shrinkage, lower dementia 
incidence, and slower cognitive decline compared to angiotensin-converting 
enzyme inhibitors. Both types of medications can influence cognition by passing 
the blood-brain barrier, with angiotensin receptor blockers potentially offering 
superior neuroprotective effects due to their selective blockade of the 
angiotensin type 1 receptor.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has had a profound global impact. The 
emergence of several variants during the pandemic has presented numerous 
challenges in preventing and managing this disease. The development of vaccines 
has played a pivotal role in controlling the pandemic, with a significant 
portion of the global population being vaccinated. This, along with the 
emergence of less virulent SARS-CoV-2 variants, has led to a reduction in the 
severity of COVID-19 outcomes for the overall population. Nevertheless, 
individuals with immunocompromising conditions continue to face challenges given 
their suboptimal response to vaccination and vulnerability to severe COVID-19. 
This expert review synthesizes recent published evidence regarding the economic 
and human impact of COVID-19 on such individuals. The literature suggests that 
rates of hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, and mechanical 
ventilation use were high during the pre-Omicron era, and remained high during 
Omicron and later, despite vaccination for this population. Moreover, studies 
indicated that these individuals experienced a negative impact on their mental 
health and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) compared to those without 
immunocompromising conditions, with elevated levels of anxiety, depression, and 
distress reported. Further, these individuals with immunocompromising conditions 
experienced substantial costs associated with COVID-19 and loss of income during 
the pandemic, though the evidence on the economic burden of COVID-19 in such 
individuals is limited. Generally, COVID-19 has increased healthcare resource 
use and costs, impaired mental health, and reduced HRQoL in those with varied 
immunocompromising conditions compared to both those without COVID-19 and the 
general population-underscoring the importance of continued real-world studies. 
Ongoing research is crucial to assess the ongoing burden of COVID-19 in 
vaccinated individuals with immunocompromising conditions who are still at risk 
of severe COVID-19 outcomes to ensure their needs are not disproportionately 
worse than the general population.

Understanding molecular motifs that can interfere with amyloid fibrillation 
through non-covalent interactions is essential for addressing abnormal protein 
aggregation and associated human diseases. The pursuit of efficient diagnostic 
and treatment approaches for Alzheimer's disease (AD) has resulted in the 
development of M8HQ, a multifaceted small molecule turn-on probe derived from 
8-hydroxyquinoline with versatile capabilities. M8HQ shows a strong affinity for 
amyloid beta (Aβ) fibrils, and its ability to target lysosomes enhances 
therapeutic precision by localizing within these organelles. This localization 
is essential for restoring cellular balance and maintaining LAMP1 expression, 
both of which are crucial for addressing AD. It also displays the ability to 
disaggregate Aβ fibrils and inhibit their formation, thus addressing therapeutic 
processes in AD progression. M8HQ further blocks reactive oxygen species 
(ROS)-mediated apoptosis, providing neuroprotective effects. Additionally, it 
chelates metal ions like Cu(II) and Fe(III), mitigating metal-induced 
aggregation and oxidative stress. Molecular docking and simulation studies have 
elucidated the interactions between M8HQ and Aβ, confirming its binding efficacy 
and stability. These combined properties highlight M8HQ's potential as a 
comprehensive diagnostic and therapeutic tool for AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurological condition that worsens over time and 
causes linguistic difficulties, cognitive decline, and memory loss. Since AD is 
a complicated, multifaceted illness, it is critical to identify drugs to combat 
this degenerative condition. Histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) represents a 
promising epigenetic target for neurodegenerative diseases. So, for this study, 
we chose HDAC2 as the targeted protein. Repurposing drugs has many advantages, 
including reduced costs and high profits. There is a lower probability of 
malfunction because the unique drug candidate has previously completed numerous 
investigations. In this study, we have taken 58 clinically approved food and 
drug administration (FDA) drugs utilized in clinical trials for AD. Molecular 
docking was carried out for the 58 compounds. The telmisartan drug has the 
highest binding score of -9.4 kcal mol-1. The angiotensin II receptor blocker 
(ARB) telmisartan has demonstrated some promise in AD research as of the last 
update in January 2022. However, its exact significance in treating or 
preventing AD is still being studied. Molecular dynamics (MD) and molecular 
mechanics with generalized born and surface area solvation (MM-GBSA)/interaction 
entropy (IE) calculations were carried out to study the structural stability of 
the complexes. Umbrella sampling (US) techniques are a cutting-edge drug 
development method to understand more about the interactions between protein and 
ligand. π-π stacking interactions play a major role in helping the ligand to 
bind in the zinc bounding domain of the protein. From these analyses, we 
conclude that telmisartan, which is a cardiovascular drug, is more potent than 
the other drugs to treat AD. The anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, and 
blood-brain barrier-crossing qualities of telmisartan make it a promising 
therapeutic agent for AD; however, more research, including larger clinical 
trials, is needed to determine the drug's precise role in treating AD.

Plasma phosphorylated-tau217 (p-tau217) has been shown to be one of the most 
accurate diagnostic markers for Alzheimer's disease. No studies have compared 
the clinical performance of p-tau217 as assessed by the fully automated 
Lumipulse and single molecule array (SIMOA) AlZpath p-tau217. The study included 
392 participants, 162 with Alzheimer's disease, 70 with other neurodegenerative 
diseases with CSF biomarkers and 160 healthy controls. Plasma p-tau217 levels 
were measured using the Lumipulse and ALZpath SIMOA assays. The ability of 
p-tau217 assessed by both techniques to discriminate Alzheimer's disease from 
other neurodegenerative diseases and controls was investigated using receiver 
operating characteristic analyses. The p-tau217 levels measured by the two 
techniques demonstrated a strong correlation, showing a consistent relationship 
with CSF p-tau181 levels. In head-to-head comparison, Lumipulse and SIMOA showed 
similar diagnostic accuracy for differentiating Alzheimer's disease from other 
neurodegenerative diseases [area under the curve (AUC) 0.952, 95% confidence 
interval (CI) 0.927-0.978 versus 0.955, 95% CI 0.928-0.982, respectively] and 
healthy controls (AUC 0.938, 95% CI 0.910-0.966 and 0.937, 95% CI 0.907-0.967 
for both assays). This study demonstrated the high precision and diagnostic 
accuracy of p-tau217 for the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease using 
fully automated or semi-automated techniques.

The two-way communication between intestinal microbiota and the central nervous 
system (the microbiota-gut-brain axis) is involved in the regulation of brain 
function, neurodevelopment, and aging. The microbiota-gut-brain axis dysfunction 
may be a predisposition factor for Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and other neurological diseases. However, 
it is not clear whether gut microbiota dysfunction contributes to 
neuropsychiatric disorders. Changes in the gut microbiota may modulate or modify 
the effects of environmental factors on neuropsychiatric disorders. Factors that 
impact neuropsychiatric disorders also influence the gut microbiota, including 
diet patterns, exercise, stress and functional gastrointestinal disorders. These 
factors change microbiome composition and function, along with the metabolism 
and immune responses that cause neuropsychiatric disorders. In this review, we 
summarized epidemiological and laboratory evidence for the influence of the gut 
microbiota, metabolism and environmental factors on neuropsychiatric disorders 
incidence and outcomes. Furthermore, the role of gut microbiota in the two-way 
interaction between the gut and the brain was also reviewed, including the vagus 
nerve, microbial metabolism, and immuno-inflammatory responses. We also 
considered the therapeutic strategies that target gut microbiota in the 
treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders, including prebiotics, probiotics, Fecal 
microbiota transplant (FMT), and antibiotics. Based on these data, possible 
strategies for microbiota-targeted intervention could improve people's lives and 
prevent neuropsychiatric disorders in the future.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment are often 
difficult to differentiate due to their progressive nature and overlapping 
symptoms. The lack of reliable biomarkers further complicates early diagnosis. 
As the global population ages, the incidence of cognitive disorders increases, 
making the need for accurate diagnosis critical. Timely and precise diagnosis is 
essential for the effective treatment and intervention of these conditions. 
However, existing diagnostic methods frequently lead to a significant rate of 
misdiagnosis. This issue underscores the necessity for improved diagnostic 
techniques to better identify cognitive disorders in the aging population.
METHODS: We used Graph Neural Networks, Multi-Layer Perceptrons, and Graph 
Attention Networks. GNNs map patient data into a graph structure, with nodes 
representing patients and edges shared clinical features, capturing key 
relationships. MLPs and GATs are used to analyse discrete data points for tasks 
such as classification and regression. Each model was evaluated on accuracy, 
precision, and recall.
RESULTS: The AI models provide an objective basis for comparing patient data 
with reference populations. This approach enhances the ability to accurately 
distinguish between AD and MCI, offering more precise risk stratification and 
aiding in the development of personalized treatment strategies.
CONCLUSION: The incorporation of AI methodologies such as GNNs and MLPs into 
clinical settings holds promise for enhancing the diagnosis and management of 
Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment. By deploying these advanced 
computational techniques, clinicians could see a reduction in diagnostic errors, 
facilitating earlier, more precise interventions, and likely to lead to 
significantly improved outcomes for patients.

In recent years, probiotics, as a class of biologically active microorganisms, 
have increasingly attracted attention for their potential in treating 
neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs). To comprehensively assess the effects of 
probiotics on clinical symptoms and systemic inflammation regulation in various 
NDDs, this systematic review conducted a detailed search of the Cochrane 
Library, Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science databases, ultimately including 22 
eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs), with 4 RCTs for Alzheimer's 
Disease (AD), 10 RCTs for Parkinson's Disease (PD), 2 RCTs for Multiple 
Sclerosis (MS), and 2 RCTs for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and intervention 
durations ranging from 4 to 16 weeks. The comprehensive analysis indicates that 
probiotics help improve clinical symptoms related to NDDs, including 
gastrointestinal function, cognitive function, quality of life, and mental 
health. Additionally, probiotics generally have a positive effect on reducing 
systemic inflammation and enhancing antioxidant capacity in patients. In 
conclusion, existing evidence supports the promising potential of probiotics in 
treating NDDs. However, further large-scale, high-quality studies are needed to 
explore specific differences in efficacy among various probiotic strains, 
dosages, and modes of administration. Moreover, considering that lifestyle and 
dietary habits may modulate the effects of probiotics, these external factors 
should also be included in research considerations to gain a more comprehensive 
understanding of the mechanisms and application strategies of probiotics in NDDs 
treatment.

Human musicality might have co-evolved with social cognition abilities, but 
common neuroanatomical substrates remain largely unclear. In behavioural variant 
frontotemporal dementia, social cognitive abilities are profoundly impaired, 
whereas these are typically spared in Alzheimer's disease. If musicality indeed 
shares a neuroanatomical basis with social cognition, it could be hypothesized 
that clinical and neuroanatomical associations of musicality and social 
cognition should differ between these causes of dementia. We recruited 73 
participants from the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort (n = 30 female; aged 50-78), of 
whom 23 had behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, 22 Alzheimer's disease 
and 28 were healthy controls. Musicality was assessed using a music-emotion 
recognition test, melody, tempo, accent and tuning subscores, a musicality 
summed score, the identification of auditory hedonic phenotypes and music 
emotion induction using skin conductance responses. Social cognition was 
assessed across multiple levels, including emotion recognition, theory of mind, 
socio-emotional sensitivity and understanding of social norms. We used ANCOVA to 
investigate subgroup differences in musicality and social cognition and linear 
regressions to investigate associations between musicality and social cognition. 
All analyses were adjusted for age, sex, musical training and mini mental state 
examination. Finally, we performed voxel-based morphometry analyses on 
T1-weighted MRI to study whether regions for musicality and social cognition 
overlapped anatomically. We found that patients with behavioural variant 
frontotemporal dementia performed worse on music-emotion recognition (all P < 
0.001) and tempo recognition (all P < 0.05) compared with Alzheimer's disease 
and on musicality summed score (all P = 0.02) compared to controls only. 
Furthermore, patients with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia had lower 
mean skin conductance responses during emotion-inducing music, compared to 
Alzheimer's disease (all P < 0.045). Worse music emotion recognition scores were 
associated with worse facial emotion recognition (P < 0.0001), worse theory of 
mind (P = 0.0005) and worse understanding of social norms (P = 0.01). Melody and 
tempo recognition were associated with facial emotion recognition and theory of 
mind, and accent recognition was associated with the theory of mind. Music 
emotion recognition and tempo recognition were also associated with executive 
functions. Worse music emotion recognition, melody recognition, tempo 
recognition, facial emotion recognition and theory of mind scores were all 
related to atrophy in the anterior temporal regions and the fusiform gyri, which 
play a role in multisensory integration, and worse tempo recognition was 
associated with atrophy of the anterior cingulate cortex. These results support 
the idea that musicality and social cognition may share a neurobiological basis, 
which may be vulnerable in behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia.

Update in
    Alzheimers Dement. 2025 Sep;21(9):e70593. doi: 10.1002/alz.70593.

BACKGROUND: This study aims to elucidate ancestry-specific changes to the 
genomic regulatory architecture in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived 
oligodendroglia, focusing on their implications for Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
This work addresses the lack of diversity in previous iPSC studies by including 
ancestries that contribute to African American (European/African) and 
Hispanic/Latino populations (Amerindian/African/European).
METHODS: We generated 12 iPSC lines-four African, four Amerindian, and four 
European- from both AD patients and non-cognitively impaired individuals, with 
varying APOE genotypes (APOE3/3 and APOE4/4). These lines were differentiated 
into neural spheroids containing oligodendrocyte lineage cells. Single-nuclei 
RNA sequencing and ATAC sequencing were employed to analyze transcriptional and 
chromatin accessibility profiles, respectively. Differential gene expression, 
chromatin accessibility, and Hi-C analyses were conducted, followed by pathway 
analysis to interpret the results.
RESULTS: We identified ancestry-specific differences in gene expression and 
chromatin accessibility. Notably, numerous AD GWAS-associated genes were 
differentially expressed across ancestries. The largest number of differentially 
expressed genes (DEGs) were found in European vs. Amerindian and African vs. 
Amerindian iPSC-derived oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). Pathway 
analysis of APOE4/4 carriers vs APOE3/3 carriers exhibited upregulation of a 
large number of disease and metabolic pathways in APOE4/4 individuals of all 
ancestries. Of particular interest was that APOE4/4 carriers had significantly 
upregulated cholesterol biosynthesis genes relative to APOE3/3 individuals 
across all ancestries, strongest in iOPCs. Comparison of iOPC and iOL 
transcriptome data with corresponding human frontal cortex data demonstrated a 
high correlation (R2 > 0.85).
CONCLUSIONS: This research emphasizes the importance of including diverse 
ancestries in AD research to uncover critical gene expression differences 
between populations and ancestries that may influence disease susceptibility and 
therapeutic interventions. The upregulation of cholesterol biosynthesis genes in 
APOE4/4 carriers of all three ancestries supports the concept that APOE4 may 
produce disease effects early in life, which could have therapeutic implications 
as we move forward towards specific therapy for APOE4 carriers. These findings 
and the high correlation between brain and iPSC-derived OPC and OL 
transcriptomes support the relevance of this approach as a model for disease 
study.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate hippocampal volume changes in moderate to severe 
traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients compared to healthy controls and assess 
their association with post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE), focusing on age-related 
effects.
METHODS: Imaging and demographic data for TBI patients were obtained from the 
Epilepsy Bioinformatics Study for Antiepileptogenic Therapy (EpiBioS4Rx) 
database; healthy controls matched by age and sex were sourced from Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), the National Institute of Mental Health 
(NIMH) Intramural Healthy Volunteer Dataset, the Parkinson's Progression Markers 
Initiative (PPMI), and the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE). MRI 
images for TBI subjects were obtained within 14-32 days post-injury. MRI data 
were preprocessed and segmented using FreeSurfer's recon-all pipeline and the 
hippocampal subfield segmentation module.
RESULTS: TBI patients showed significantly smaller average hippocampal volumes 
than controls (β = -191.0, p = 8.33e-04, FDR p = 1.47e-03, Cohen's d = -0.36), 
notably in the right and left CA1 head regions. No significant hippocampal 
volume differences were found between TBI+ and TBI- patients overall. In 
patients aged 60+, TBI+ patients had significantly larger volumes in the right 
CA1 head than TBI- patients (β = 57.43, p = 0.0300, FDR p = 0.040; Cohen's d = 
1.06).
CONCLUSION: Hippocampal atrophy is evident in TBI patients but not directly 
linked to PTE development in most age groups. In patients over 60, hypertrophy 
in the right CA1 head may be associated with PTE, suggesting age and regional 
hippocampal changes influence epilepsy risk post-TBI. These findings highlight 
the complexity of hippocampal involvement in PTE and suggest potential shared 
mechanisms with neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.

Guangzhou, China.

Stroke is a significant health concern impacting society and the health care 
system. Reperfusion therapy for acute ischemic stroke and standard 
rehabilitative therapies may not always be effective at improving post-stroke 
neurological function, and developing alternative strategies is particularly 
important. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a treatment option currently 
approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for intractable epilepsy, 
refractory depression, primary headache disorders, obesity, and moderate to 
severe upper-limb motor dysfunction in chronic ischemic stroke patients. 
Moreover, VNS has demonstrated potential efficacy in various conditions, 
including autoimmune diseases, disorders of consciousness, Alzheimer's disease, 
Parkinson's disease, traumatic brain injury, stroke, and other diseases. 
Although the popularity and application of VNS continue to increase rapidly, the 
field generally lacks a consensus on the optimal stimulation parameters. The 
stimulation parameters for VNS are directly related to the clinical outcome, and 
determining the optimal stimulation conditions for VNS has become an essential 
concern in its clinical application. This review summarizes the current evidence 
on VNS for stroke in preclinical models and clinical trials in humans, paying 
attention to the current types and stimulation parameters of VNS, highlighting 
the mechanistic pathways involved in the beneficial effects of VNS, critically 
evaluating clinical implementation challenges and proposing some suggestions for 
its future research directions. Achieving safe and effective clinical 
transformation of VNS requires further animal and clinical studies to determine 
the optimal stimulation parameters and therapeutic mechanisms.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, with its 
prevalence doubling approximately every decade. It is a significant contributor 
to disability-adjusted life-years in individuals aged 50 and older, impacting a 
substantial portion of this population globally. The pathophysiology of AD is 
primarily explained by two hypotheses: the amyloid cascade hypothesis and the 
tau hypothesis. While the amyloid cascade hypothesis is widely accepted as the 
main contributor to AD, both mechanisms promote neuroinflammation by driving the 
formation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles, which are key features 
of the neurodegenerative process. Recent studies highlight the critical role of 
the gut microbiome (GMB) in the progression of AD. Gut dysbiosis has been linked 
to neuroinflammation, altered Aβ metabolism, blood-brain barrier disruption, and 
changes in neuroactive metabolites. Targeting the GMB offers potential 
therapeutic avenues aimed at restoring microbial balance and mitigating the 
effects of dysbiosis. The gut-brain axis, crucial for neurological health, 
remains underexplored in AD, especially since current research is limited to 
animal models and small human studies, leaving uncertainty about specific gut 
bacteria's roles in AD. Currently, pharmacological treatments for AD include 
cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine. This review discusses newer and 
emerging treatments targeting Aβ and tau pathology, alongside microbiome-based 
interventions. Larger, human-based studies with diverse populations are 
essential to establish the therapeutic efficacy of these microbiome-targeted 
treatments and their long-term impact on AD management.

An Isoindolinedione-benzamide pyridinium derivatives were designed through a 
structure-based strategy and synthesized as novel multifunctional anti-Alzheimer 
agents. The inhibitory activities of all 17 derivatives against 
acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase were evaluated. Results exhibited 
that compound 7j displayed promising AChE inhibitory activity with an IC50 value 
of 0.26 ± 0.07 μM, and compound 7c exhibited an IC50 value of 0.08 ± 0.01 μM 
against BChE with 132-fold better inhibitory activity in comparison with 
positive control. Next, the enzyme kinetics studies and detailed binding mode 
via molecular docking were performed for the most potent compounds. 
Additionally, molecular dynamics simulations were accomplished to further 
investigate the potent compound's interaction, orientation, and conformation 
over the related enzymes. The neurotoxicity of the most potent derivative was 
executed against SH-SY5Y, and the mRNA levels of GSK-3α and GSK-3β after 
treatment with 7c on SH-SY5Y were evaluated. Results exhibited the mRNA levels 
of GSK-3β were decreased compared to the control group. All these results 
indicate that 7c is a good starting point for developing a multifunctional 
anti-Alzheimer compound.

The treatment of brain diseases has always been the focus of attention. Due to 
the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), most small molecule drugs are 
difficult to reach the brain, leading to undesirable therapeutic outcomes. 
Recently, nanomedicines that can cross the BBB and precisely target lesion sites 
have emerged as thrilling tools to enhance the early diagnosis and treat various 
intractable brain disorders. Extensive research has shown that reactive oxygen 
species (ROS) play a crucial role in the occurrence and progression of brain 
diseases, including brain tumors and neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) such as 
Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, stroke, or traumatic brain injury, 
making ROS a potential therapeutic target. In this review, on the structure and 
function of BBB as well as the mechanisms are first elaborated through which 
nanomedicine traverses it. Then, recent studies on ROS production are 
summarized through photodynamic therapy (PDT), chemodynamic therapy (CDT), and 
sonodynamic therapy (SDT) for treating brain tumors, and ROS depletion for 
treating NDDs. This provides valuable guidance for the future design of 
ROS-targeted nanomedicines for brain disease treatment. The ongoing challenges 
and future perspectives in developing nanomedicine-based ROS management for 
brain diseases are also discussed and outlined.

impairment and decreases neuroinflammation in an animal model of metabolic 
syndrome.

Metabolic syndrome (MS) is the medical term for the combination of at least 
three of the following factors: obesity, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, insulin 
resistance, and hypertension. The spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) is an 
accepted animal model for the study of human MS that reveals all the features of 
the syndrome when fed high-fat, high-carbohydrate diets. The intake of high-fat 
diets in rats has been shown to produce brain neuropathology. In humans, MS 
increases the risk of cognitive impairment, dementia, and Alzheimer's disease. 
Genistein (GEN) is a phytoestrogen found in soy that lacks feminizing and 
carcinogenic effects and was found to have neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory 
effects in many pathological conditions. Considering that multiple data support 
that natural phytoestrogens may be therapeutic options for CNS maladies, we aim 
to elucidate if these properties also apply to a rat model of MS. Thus, GEN 
effects on neuroinflammation, neurogenesis, and cognition were evaluated in SHR 
eating a fat/carbohydrate-enriched diet. To characterize the neuropathology and 
cognitive dysfunction of MS we fed SHR with a high-fat diet (4520 kcal/kg) along 
with a 20% sucrose solution to drink. MS rats displayed a significant increase 
in body weight, BMI and obesity indexes along with an increased in fasting 
glucose levels, glucose intolerance, high blood pressure, and high blood 
triglyceride levels. MS rats were injected with GEN during 2 weeks a dose of 
10 mg/kg. We found that MS rats showed a decreased number of DCX+ neural 
progenitors in the dentate gyrus and treatment with GEN increased this 
parameter. Expression of GFAP was increased in the DG and CA1 areas of the 
hippocampus and treatment decreased astrogliosis in all of them. We measured the 
expression of IBA1+ microglia in the same regions and classified microglia 
according to their morphology: we found that MS rats presented an increased 
proportion of the hypertrophied phenotype and GEN produced a shift in microglial 
phenotypes toward a ramified type. Furthermore, colocalization of IBA1 with the 
proinflammatory marker TNFα showed increased proportion of proinflammatory 
microglia in MS and a reduction with GEN treatment. On the other hand, 
colocalization with the anti-inflammatory marker Arg1 showed that MS has 
decreased proportion of anti-inflammatory microglia and GEN treatment increased 
this parameter. Cognitive dysfunction was evaluated in rats with MS using a 
battery of behavioral tests that assessed hippocampus-dependent spatial and 
working memory, such as the novel object recognition test (NOR), the novel 
object location test (NOL), and the free-movement pattern Y-maze (FMP-YMAZE) and 
the d-YMAZE. In all of them, MS performed poorly and GEN was able to improve 
cognitive impairments. These results indicate that GEN was able to exert 
neuroprotective actions increasing neurogenesis and improving cognitive 
impairments while decreasing astrogliosis, microgliosis, and neuroinflammatory 
environment in MS rats. Together, these results open an interesting possibility 
for proposing this phytoestrogen as a neuroprotective therapy for MS.

INTRODUCTION: Melanotransferrin (CD228), a cell membrane-anchored protein, has 
emerged as a significant cancer antigen due to its high expression in various 
solid tumors. This review synthesizes the current understanding and therapeutic 
potential of CD228.
AREAS COVERED: We conducted a literature search using PubMed, Web of Science, 
and ClinicalTrials.gov with the keywords 'melanotransferrin' and 'CD228.' Our 
comprehensive review examines CD228 and its isoforms, membrane-bound CD228 
(mMFI2) and soluble CD228 (sMFI2), their roles in tumorigenesis, angiogenesis, 
endothelial cell migration, plasminogen activation, and transendothelial 
transport across the BBB, as well as the current state of drug development 
efforts targeting CD228.
EXPERT OPINION: Targeting CD228 represents a promising therapeutic strategy in 
oncology, with mMFI2 as a potential target for solid tumors and sMFI2 valuable 
for disease diagnosis in malignant tumors, Alzheimer's disease, and arthritis, 
and facilitating macromolecular drug delivery across the blood-brain barrier 
(BBB). Despite its potential to transform the treatment landscape for numerous 
solid cancers, further research into the precise mechanisms and clinical 
translation of CD228-directed treatments is needed to maximize its therapeutic 
utility.

Combination therapy offers a promising advantage because they target multiple 
pathways involved in the pathogenesis and progression of Alzheimer's disease. 
This study aimed to investigate the synergistic effect of donepezil and each of 
vitamin B12, vitamin B6 and vitamin B1 on aluminium chloride (AlCl3)-induced 
neurotoxicity in rats. Fifty-four rats were divided into nine groups of six. 
Group I received distilled water, group II-AlCl3 (100 mg/kg), group III- AlCl3 
(100 mg/kg) + Donepezil (10 mg/kg), group IV-AlCl3(100 mg/kg) + Donepezil 
(10 mg/kg) + Vitamin B12 (5 mg/kg), group V-AlCl3 (100 mg/kg) + Donepezil 
(10 mg/kg) + Vitamin B6 (5 mg/kg), group VI-AlCl3 (100 mg/kg) + Donepezil 
(10 mg/kg) + Vitamin B1 (5 mg/kg), group VII-AlCl3 (100 mg/kg) + Vitamin B12 
(5 mg/kg), group VIII-AlCl3 (100 mg/kg) + Vitamin B6 (5 mg/kg), group IX-AlCl3 
(100 mg/kg) + Vitamin B1 (5 mg/kg). Treatment lasted for 40 days. Biochemical 
analyses of the brain revealed that chronic administration of AlCl3 
significantly increased the level of inflammatory cytokines, caspase 9, 
malondialdehyde, nitric oxide and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, while 
causing a significant decrease in superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, Nrf2, 
reduced glutathione, dopamine and norepinephrine. Results also showed that AlCl3 
caused cognitive impairment as indicated by a reduction in the percentage 
alternation index and hypo-activity towards novel object in animals treated with 
AlCl3 only. Moreover, results from biochemical evaluations indicated that 
treatment with donepezil, B vitamins and combination of donepezil and B vitamins 
attenuated the deficits in dopamine, norepinephrine, Nrf2, SOD and reduced 
glutathione, while also reducing the elevated levels of malondialdehyde, nitric 
oxide, AChE, caspase 9 and inflammatory markers. These observations were 
corroborated by result of histopathological evaluation. The combination of 
donepezil and vitamin B12, B6 and B1 proved to be more effective than donepezil 
monotherapy. Donepezil conferred significant protection against AlCl3-induced 
neurotoxicity, however, the combination of donepezil and vitamin B12, vitamin B6 
and Vitamin B1 significantly performed better in neuroprotective indices than 
donepezil monotherapy. The combination of donepezil and vitamin B1 was better 
amongst the three combination therapies in this study.

The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is rising with an aging population 
worldwide and is expected to surpass 130 million by 2050. India is no exception, 
but the true prevalence data on AD is not conclusive. By 2050, India will have 
almost 15% of the population aged 60 years or above. It is the need of the hour 
to have newer and more effective agents that can address various therapeutic 
needs of Alzheimer's viz., halt or delay disease progression, and offer better 
improvement in symptomatology. The most desirable would be to have an 
intervention that can prevent AD onset. The prime focus of the present review is 
to introduce to the readers the promising drug candidates across the world. We 
reviewed all the information available to us through a literature search. It is 
quite apparent that the developmental efforts are concentrated not only on 
disease-modifying therapies that can prevent the development but also on 
palliative therapies that improve the quality of life of AD patients. Several 
approaches including biological and small molecules are being explored to tap 
their potential in AD therapeutics using sound scientific research principles 
and execution. Besides conventional development approaches, the drug repurposing 
strategy has emerged as quick, cost-effective, and less risky and is being 
exploited to the fullest. The drugs in the pipeline and undergoing various 
phases of clinical trials for the past 5 years are taken from the 
ClinicalTrials.gov registry. It remains to be seen the advent of a successful 
disease-modifying agent for AD in future.

OBJECTIVES: To capture nursing home staff perspectives on the benefits and 
challenges related to caring for residents living with Alzheimer disease and 
other related dementias. These perspectives will inform the initial development 
of strategies to help with staff retention.
DESIGN: A secondary qualitative analysis of semistructured interviews conducted 
with nursing home staff, which was embedded within a pragmatic clinical trial.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Purposive sampling was used to capture perspectives of 
staff spanning across job roles from 23 nursing homes.
METHODS: During the parent study primary analysis, staff experiences providing 
dementia care were consistently described. In response, this study completed a 
secondary analysis of study data using thematic analysis to identify benefits 
and challenges of caring for this population.
RESULTS: Analysis of nursing home staff (n = 327) interviews captured benefits 
and challenges of caring for residents living with dementia. Three themes 
reflected staff perspectives of the benefits, including valuing interpersonal 
relationship with residents (eg, learning about residents' likes, dislikes, and 
history), providing care fosters a sense of purpose, and the variability of the 
job from day to day (eg, getting to use different strategies to interact with 
residents). Two themes portrayed the challenges staff articulated, including 
feeling discouraged because of ineffective care strategies (eg, not being able 
to manage residents' behaviors) and the toll that caring for this resident 
population takes on staff mental health (eg, death of residents).
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Nursing home staff report benefits and challenges 
to providing care to people with dementia. To assist with staff retention and 
lower staff turnover, nursing home administrators need to take into 
consideration how to help their staff manage the challenges and facilitate the 
benefits through the implementation of organizational strategies.

Research on cognitive impairment (CI) has increasingly focused on the central 
nervous system, identifying numerous neuronal targets and circuits of relevance 
for CI pathogenesis and treatment. Brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) 
form a barrier between the peripheral and central nervous systems, constituting 
the primary component of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and playing a vital role 
in maintaining neural homeostasis. Stemming from the recognition of the close 
link between vascular dysfunction and CI, in recent years intense research has 
been devoted to characterize the pathological changes and molecular mechanisms 
underlying BMEC dysfunction both during normal aging and in disorders of 
cognition such as Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. In this review, 
keywords such as "dementia", "cognitive impairment", and "endothelium" were used 
to search PubMed and Web of Science. Based on the literature thus retrieved, we 
first review some common triggers of CI, i.e., amyloid beta and tau deposition, 
chronic cerebral hypoperfusion, hyperglycemia, viral infections, and 
neuroinflammation, and describe the specific mechanisms responsible for 
endothelial damage. Second, we review molecular aspects of endothelial damage 
leading to BBB disruption, neuronal injury, and myelin degeneration, which are 
crucial events underlying CI. Finally, we summarize the potential targets of 
endothelial damage in the development of cognitive dysfunction associated with 
Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and 
physiological aging. A thorough understanding of the induction mechanism and 
potential outcomes of microvascular endothelial damage is of great significance 
for the study of CI, to guide both diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for its 
prevention and treatment.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by cognitive decline, with 
pathological features including amyloid β (Aβ) plaques and inflammation. Despite 
recent approvals of anti-amyloid antibodies, there remains a need for 
disease-modifying and easily accessible therapies. The endocannabinoid system 
presents a promising target for AD treatment, as it regulates various processes 
implicated in AD pathogenesis.
AIMS: This study assesses the effects of the synthetic cannabinoid WIN 55,212-2 
on AD pathology and behavior deficits in aged 5XFAD mice, a well-established AD 
model.
METHODS: Male 9-month-old 5XFAD mice received either 0.2 mg/kg WIN 55,212-2 or a 
vehicle solution for 42 days. Memory, anxiety, and motor tests were conducted at 
10 months to identify potential changes in behavior and cognition following WIN 
55,212-2 treatment. Additionally, the effects of prolonged WIN 55,212-2 
treatment on Aβ pathology and neuroinflammation in the brain were quantified 
immunohistochemically.
RESULTS: Therapeutic WIN 55,212-2 treatment improved the motor performance of 
5XFAD mice on the rotarod and rescued memory deficits in the water maze. 
However, WIN 55,212-2 treatment did not significantly affect anxiety-like 
behavior in 5XFAD mice. Additionally, prolonged treatment with WIN 55,212-2 
reduced Aβ plaque pathology and astrogliosis in the cortex and hippocampus.
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the therapeutic potential of WIN 55,212-2 in 
AD by ameliorating cognitive and motor deficits and reducing neuropathology. 
These findings support a cannabinoid-based therapy as a promising strategy for 
AD treatment, with WIN 55,212-2 emerging as a potential candidate.

BACKGROUND: Lewy body disorders (LBD), encompassing Parkinson disease (PD), PD 
dementia (PDD), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), are characterized by 
alpha-synuclein pathology but often are accompanied by Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
neuropathological change (ADNC). The medial temporal lobe (MTL) is a primary 
locus of tau accumulation and associated neurodegeneration in AD. However, it is 
unclear the extent to which AD copathology in LBD (LBD/AD+) contributes to 
MTL-specific patterns of degeneration. We employ a MTL subregional segmentation 
strategy of T1-weighted (T1w) MRI in biomarker-supported or autopsy-confirmed 
LBD and LBD/AD+ to investigate the anatomic consequences of co-occurring 
LBD/AD+ pathology on neurodegeneration.
METHODS: We studied 167 individuals with clinical diagnoses of LBD (PD, n = 124 
(74.3 %); PDD, n = 11 (6.6 %); DLB, n = 32 (19.2 %)) with available T1w MRI and 
AD biomarkers or autopsy evidence of ADNC. Individuals were further biologically 
classified as LBD/AD+ based on hierarchical evidence of ADNC pathology: 1) AD 
"intermediate" or "high" by ABC neuropathologic criteria (n = 39 (23.4 %)); 2) 
positive amyloid PET (n = 2 (1.2 %)); or 3) CSF β-amyloid1-42 < 185.7 pg/mL 
n = 126 (75.4 %)). The T1 Automated Segmentation of Hippocampal Subfields (ASHS) 
pipeline was used to compute volume and thickness measurements of MTL subregions 
in LBD/AD- and LBD/AD+. Linear regression tested the association of AD 
copathology and subregion volume/thickness, covarying for age and sex, and 
intracranial volume for volume measurements. Secondary analyses correlated MTL 
subregional volume/thickness with cognition and neuropathology.
RESULTS: LBD/AD+ had decreased volume/thickness compared to LBD/AD- in all MTL 
subregions except posterior hippocampus. The greatest effect sizes were seen in 
Brodmann Area 35 (BA35) (Cohen's d = 0.62, p = 0.002, β = 0.107 ± 0.034), and 
entorhinal cortex (ERC) (Cohen's d = 0.56, p = 0.006, β = 0.088 ± 0.031). 
Smaller differences were seen in the parahippocampal cortex (PHC) (Cohen's 
d = 0.5, p = 0.012, β = 0.082 ± 0.033), BA36 (Cohen's d = 0.47, p = 0.021, 
β = 0.090 ± 0.039) and anterior hippocampus (Cohen's d = 0.45, p = 0.029, 
β = 111.790 ± 50.595). Verbal memory scores positively correlated with 
volume/thickness in anterior and posterior hippocampus, BA35, ERC and PHC, while 
visuospatial memory positively correlated only in BA35. In the subset of 
participants with autopsy, lower ERC volume was associated with a higher tau 
load in ERC (adjusted odds ratio 0.013, 95 % CI [0.0002, 0.841], uncorrected 
p = 0.041).
CONCLUSIONS: Relative to LBD/AD-, LBD/AD+ has greater T1w MRI evidence of 
atrophy in multiple MTL subregions. Atrophy in MTL subregions associates with 
memory performance and tau pathological load. The observed pattern of atrophy 
largely follows expectation from AD Braak stages, except for posterior 
hippocampus. Longitudinal studies are needed to validate the hypothesized spread 
of neurodegeneration.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by the depletion of cholinergic neurons and the accumulation of 
amyloid β (Aβ) plaques. The complexity and multifaceted nature of AD necessitate 
further exploration of multi-target drugs for its treatment. In this study, a 
series of novel pyrazolinone-based compounds were designed, synthesized, and 
evaluated as acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors and antioxidants. The lead 
compounds ET11 and ET21 showed strong inhibitory activity against human AChE, 
with IC50 values of 6.34 and 1.81 nM, respectively. In vitro DPPH and ORACFL 
assays confirmed the compounds' strong antioxidant capabilities. ET11 exhibited 
excellent neuroprotective activity in the tBHP-induced SH-SY5Y cell damage 
model. Benefiting from the pyridopyrazolone moiety, ET11 showed significant Cu2+ 
chelating ability and effectively inhibited Cu2+-induced Aβ aggregation. In vivo 
behavioral studies and histopathology analysis preliminarily confirmed the 
compound's cognitive improvement and neuroprotective effects. Overall, these 
findings suggested that compound ET11 is expected to play a synergistic role in 
the treatment of AD, potentially slowing disease progression.

Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several 
neurodegenerative disorders, including progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). PSP 
is a Parkinsonian syndrome characterized by a rapidly progressive state that 
manifests itself as tremors, bradykinesia, and supranuclear gaze palsy. 
Carnitine plays an essential role in mitochondrial function by transporting 
fatty acids across the mitochondrial membrane to be used in energy production. 
Mitochondrial dysfunction can bring about rapid neuronal depolarization and a 
calcium-mediated cellular apoptosis owing to a loss of oxidative metabolism, 
likely contributing to the PSP disease process. A White man aged 65 years with 
PSP presented with small bowel obstruction and severe malnutrition as a result 
of prior gastrointestinal surgeries for which a gastrostomy tube was placed. 
During his hospitalization, the patient was found to be deficient in both free 
and total carnitine. He was treated with levocarnitine supplementation and 
exhibited marked improvement in tremors, fatigue, and physical therapy 
activities. Posthospitalization follow-up showed sustained improvement in 
symptoms with continued levocarnitine supplementation. Treatment of PSP remains 
largely supportive in nature. No studies have investigated the role of carnitine 
supplementation in PSP. To our knowledge, this is the first case report to 
identify improvement in PSP symptoms after carnitine repletion and supportive 
care. Numerous animal studies have reported on carnitine supplementation in the 
context of mitochondrial dysfunction associated with neurodegenerative diseases, 
such as Parkinson disease and Alzheimer disease. Further investigation is 
necessary to elucidate the precise role of carnitine and other nutrition 
supplements in the pathophysiology of PSP.

OBJECTIVES: To assess depression and perception of vocal handicap in individuals 
with and without early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) using a self-report 
method.
METHODS: It was conducted between April 2024 and June 2024 with individuals who 
visited the Internal Medicine Clinics of Çankırı State Hospital, including those 
with AD (study group: n = 41) and those without AD (with normal cognitive 
levels) (control group: n = 50). 41.46% (n = 17) of the study group were female, 
53.54% (n = 24) were male. 56% (n = 28) of the control group were female, 54% 
(n = 22) were male. The Personal and Medical Characteristics Information Form, 
The Standardized Mini-Mental State Examination, the Geriatric Depression Scale 
(GDS), and the Voice Handicap Index-10 (VHI-10) were used. For the perception of 
vocal handicap, participants were asked to respond to the question, "How do you 
describe your voice at the moment?" by choosing one of two options: good or bad, 
to express their opinion.
RESULTS: The study group scored significantly higher on the GDS than did the 
control group (t = (89) = 3.043, P = 0.03). Similar results were obtained in the 
VHI-10 scores of the two groups (t = (89) = 0.892, P > 0.05). The study group 
reported a worse perception in their responses to the question regarding 
perceived of vocal handicap (χ²(1) = 28.145, P < 0.001). A significant 
relationship was found between the GDS results of the study group and the 
perceived vocal handicap (χ2(2) = 20.246, P < 0.001). A moderate positive 
correlation was found between VHI-10 and GDS (r = 0.508, P = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The voice is an important tool that individuals use for 
communication with their environment. While individuals with AD are at risk for 
depression, the current impact of the disease also affects their perception of 
vocal handicap. It is thought that broad-spectrum evaluations could be guiding 
for healthcare professionals working in geriatrics to better understand AD.

Tauopathies encompass a group of approximately 20 neurodegenerative diseases 
characterized by the accumulation of the microtubule-associated protein tau in 
brain neurons. The pathogenesis of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, a 
hallmark of tauopathies, is initiated by hyperphosphorylated tau protein 
isoforms that cause neuronal death and lead to diseases like Alzheimer's, 
Parkinson's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and other complex 
neurodegenerative diseases. Current applications of tau biomarkers, including 
imaging, cerebrospinal fluid, and blood-based assays, assist in the evaluation 
and diagnosis of tauopathies. Emerging research is providing various potential 
strategies to prevent cellular toxicity caused by tau aggregation such as: 1) 
suppressing toxic tau aggregation, 2) preventing post-translational 
modifications of tau, 3) stabilizing microtubules and 4) designing tau-directed 
immunogens. This review aims to discuss the role of tau in tauopathies along 
with neuropathological features of the different tauopathies and the new 
developments in treating tau aggregation with the therapeutics for treating and 
possibly preventing tauopathies.
