Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation are recognized as key factors in the 
development of neurodegenerative diseases, yet effective interventions and 
biomarkers to address oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in these conditions 
are limited. Uric acid (UA), traditionally associated with gout, is now gaining 
prominence as a potential target in neurodegenerative diseases. Soluble UA 
stands out as one of the most vital antioxidant compounds produced by the human 
body, accounting for up to 55% of the extracellular capacity to neutralize free 
radicals. While there is increasing evidence supporting the neuroprotective 
properties of UA in Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, gaps in 
knowledge still exist regarding the underlying mechanisms and how to effectively 
translate these benefits into clinical practice. Moreover, the current UA 
elevation therapy exhibits unstable antioxidant properties, individual 
variability, and even adverse effects, limiting its potential clinical 
applications. This review consolidates recent advancements in understanding how 
UA exerts neuroprotective effects on neurodegenerative diseases and emphasizes 
the dual roles of UA in managing oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. 
Additionally, the review elucidates the mechanisms through which UA confers 
neuroprotection. Based on this, the review underscores the significance of UA as 
a potential biomarker and aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of its 
potential as a therapeutic target, while also addressing possible challenges to 
clinical implementation.

In this study, new cinnamic acid linked to triazole acetamide derivatives was 
synthesized and evaluated for anti-Alzheimer and anti-melanogenesis activities. 
The structural elucidation of all analogs was performed using different 
analytical techniques, including 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, mass spectrometry, and IR 
spectroscopy. The synthesized compounds were assessed in vitro for their 
inhibitory activities against acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase 
(BChE), and tyrosinase enzymes. Among synthesize derivative compound 
3-(4-((1-(2-((2,4-dichlorophenyl)amino)-2-oxoethyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methoxy)-3-methoxyphenyl)acrylic 
acid (10j) exhibited the highest activity against BChE with an IC50 value of 
11.99 ± 0.53 µM. Derivative 
3-(3-methoxy-4-((1-(2-oxo-2-(p-tolylamino)ethyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methoxy)phenyl)acrylic 
acid (10d), bearing a 4-CH3 group, was identified as the most potent AChE 
inhibitor. In terms of tyrosinase inhibition, 
3-(3-methoxy-4-((1-(2-((2-methyl-4-nitrophenyl)amino)-2-oxoethyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methoxy)phenyl)acrylic 
acid (compound 10n), demonstrated 44.87% inhibition at a concentration of 40 µM. 
Additionally, a kinetic study of compound 10j which 2,4-dichlorophenyl 
substituents against BChE revealed a mixed-type inhibition pattern. Furthermore, 
molecular docking and molecular dynamic studies of compound 10j were conducted 
to thoroughly evaluate its mode of action within the BChE active site.

BACKGROUND: Adenosine deaminase action on RNA 1 (ADAR1) can convert the 
adenosine in double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules into inosine in a process 
known as A-to-I RNA editing. ADAR1 regulates gene expression output by 
interacting with RNA and other proteins; plays important roles in development, 
including growth; and is linked to innate immunity, tumors, and central nervous 
system (CNS) diseases.
RESULTS: In recent years, the role of ADAR1 in tumors has been widely discussed, 
but its role in CNS diseases has not been reviewed. It is worth noting that 
recent studies have shown ADAR1 has great potential in the treatment of 
neurodegenerative diseases, but the mechanisms are still unclear. Therefore, it 
is necessary to elaborate on the role of ADAR1 in CNS diseases.
CONCLUSIONS: Here, we focus on the effects and mechanisms of ADAR1 on CNS 
diseases such as Aicardi-AicardiGoutières syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, 
Parkinson's disease, glioblastoma, epilepsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and 
autism. We also evaluate the impact of ADAR1-based treatment strategies on these 
diseases, with a particular focus on the development and treatment strategies of 
new technologies such as microRNAs, nanotechnology, gene editing, and stem cell 
therapy. We hope to provide new directions and insights for the future 
development of ADAR1 gene editing technology in brain science and the treatment 
of CNS diseases.

A nano-enzyme sandwich assay (SWzyme assay), a colorimetric system based on a 
biochip and inorganic nano-enzyme for rapid and simple determination of exosomal 
Aβ42 in plasma is proposed. Anti-CD63 antibody-modified biochips were 
prepared for plasma exosome capture and synthesized highly catalytic Ni@Pt 
nanozymes for detecting exosomal Aβ42. The method was able to detect exosomal 
Aβ42 with a limit of detection (LOD) as low as 4.2×104 particles/mL and a linear 
range from 104 to 108 particles/mL. By determination of exosomal Aβ42, the 
SWzyme assay successfully distinguished plasma from Alzheimer's desease (AD) and 
healthy mice. The SWzyme assay holds promise to serve as diagnostic tools for 
the early detection of AD and supporting the development of personalized 
medicine.

Corticospinal motor neurons (CSMN), located in the motor cortex of the brain, 
are one of the key components of the motor neuron circuitry. They are in part 
responsible for the initiation and modulation of voluntary movement, and their 
degeneration is the hallmark for numerous diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis (ALS), hereditary spastic paraplegia, and primary lateral sclerosis. 
Cortical hyperexcitation followed by in-excitability suggests the early 
involvement of cortical dysfunction in ALS pathology. However, a 
high-spatiotemporal resolution on our understanding of their functional health 
and connectivity is lacking. Here, we combine optical imaging with high-density 
microelectrode array (HD-MEA) system enabling single cell resolution and utilize 
UCHL1-eGFP mice to bring cell-type specificity to our understanding of the 
electrophysiological features of healthy CSMN, as they mature and form network 
connections with other cortical neurons, in vitro. This novel approach lays the 
foundation for future cell-type specific analyses of CSMN that are diseased due 
to different underlying causes with cellular precision, and it will allow the 
assessment of their functional response to compound treatment, especially for 
drug discovery efforts in upper motor neuron diseases.

Accurate diagnosis and monitoring of neurodegenerative diseases require reliable 
biomarkers. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins are promising candidates for 
reflecting brain pathology; however, their diagnostic utility may be compromised 
by natural variability between individuals, weakening their association with 
disease. Here, we measured the levels of 69 pre-selected proteins in 
cerebrospinal fluid using antibody-based suspension bead array technology in a 
multi-disease cohort of 499 individuals with neurodegenerative disorders 
including Alzheimer's disease (AD), behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, 
primary progressive aphasias, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), corticobasal 
syndrome, primary supranuclear palsy, along with healthy controls. We identify 
significant inter-individual variability in overall CSF levels of brain-derived 
proteins, which could not be attributed to specific disease associations. Using 
linear modelling, we show that adjusting for median CSF levels of brain-derived 
proteins increases the diagnostic accuracy of proteins previously identified as 
altered in CSF in the context of neurodegenerative disorders. We further 
demonstrate a simplified approach for the adjustment using pairs of correlated 
proteins with opposite alteration in the diseases. With this approach, the 
proteins adjust for each other and further increase the biomarker performance 
through additive effect. When comparing the diseases, two proteins-neurofilament 
medium and myelin basic protein-showed increased levels in ALS compared to other 
diseases, and neurogranin showed a specific increase in AD. Several other 
proteins showed similar trends across the studied diseases, indicating that 
these proteins likely reflect shared processes related to neurodegeneration. 
Overall, our findings suggest that accounting for inter-individual variability 
is crucial in future studies to improve the identification and performance of 
relevant biomarkers. Importantly, we highlight the need for multi-disease 
studies to identify disease-specific biomarkers.

We have developed the regionalpcs method, an approach for summarizing gene-level 
methylation. regionalpcs addresses the challenge of deciphering complex 
epigenetic mechanisms in diseases like Alzheimer's disease. In contrast to 
averaging, regionalpcs uses principal components analysis to capture complex 
methylation patterns across gene regions. Our method demonstrates a 54% 
improvement in sensitivity over averaging in simulations, providing a robust 
framework for identifying subtle epigenetic variations. Applying regionalpcs to 
Alzheimer's disease brain methylation data, combined with cell type 
deconvolution, we uncover 838 differentially methylated genes associated with 
neuritic plaque burden-significantly outperforming conventional methods. 
Integrating methylation quantitative trait loci with genome-wide association 
studies identified 17 genes with potential causal roles in Alzheimer's disease 
risk, including MS4A4A and PICALM. Available in the Bioconductor package 
regionalpcs, our approach facilitates a deeper understanding of the epigenetic 
landscape in Alzheimer's disease and opens avenues for research into complex 
diseases.

We have identified FLT1 as a protein that changes during Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) whereby higher brain protein levels are associated with more amyloid, more 
tau, and faster longitudinal cognitive decline. Given FLT1's role in 
angiogenesis and immune activation, we hypothesized that FLT1 is upregulated in 
response to amyloid pathology, driving a vascular-immune cascade resulting in 
neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. We sought to determine (1) if in vivo 
FLT1 levels (CSF and plasma) associate with biomarkers of AD neuropathology or 
differ between diagnostic staging in an aged cohort enriched for early disease, 
and (2) whether FLT1 expression interacts with amyloid on downstream outcomes, 
such as phosphorylated tau levels and cognitive performance. Additionally, we 
sought to replicate FLT1 interactions in the brain. The results showed that 
higher levels of FLT1 in CSF and post-mortem brain tissue related to increased 
tau, particularly among amyloid positive individuals. These analyses help 
clarify the potential utility of FLT1 as a biomarker among individuals with 
evidence of brain amyloidosis.

BACKGROUND: The association between tea consumption, especially different types, 
and cognitive function has not been adequately explored. This study aimed to 
investigate the associations of tea consumption, including status, frequency, 
and type, with cognitive function, considering selection bias.
METHODS: We used data from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey 
(CLHLS) in 2018(N = 8498). Cognitive function was measured by Mini-Mental State 
Examination (MMSE). Logistic and linear regression were applied to assess the 
associations of tea consumption with cognitive impairment and cognitive scores, 
respectively. Propensity score matching (PSM) and inverse probability of 
treatment weighting (IPTW) were used to balance characteristic differences 
between groups.
RESULTS: The characteristics of tea consumption status, frequency and type were 
well balanced between groups after using PSM and IPTW. Drinking tea was 
associated with less cognitive impairment (ORadjusted:0.84, ORPSM:0.84, 
ORIPTW:0.87) and higher cognitive scores (Coefficientadjusted:0.29, 
CoefficientPSM:0.33, CoefficientIPTW:0.29). Regular tea drinkers may have better 
cognitive function than those who never or rarely consumed (Ptrend < 0.05 for 
both methods). Green tea drinkers had lower prevalence of cognitive impairment 
(ORadjusted:0.71, ORIPTW:0.75) and higher cognitive scores 
(Coefficientadjusted:0.45, CoefficientIPTW:0.54). Men, uneducated, and those 
with annual income>10,000 RMB were more likely to benefit from flower tea. 
Significant interactions of tea consumption with age, education and income were 
observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Tea consumption, especially regular and green tea consumption, was 
associated with less cognitive impairment and higher cognitive scores, even 
after PSM and IPTW adjustments. Flower teas may have potential protective effect 
that is worth further study. Age, education and income have synergistic effects 
with tea consumption on cognitive function.

    bioRxiv. 2024 Jul 09:2024.07.05.602170. doi: 10.1101/2024.07.05.602170.

Neurodegenerative diseases are often characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction. 
In Alzheimer's disease, abnormal tau phosphorylation disrupts mitophagy, a 
quality control process through which damaged organelles are selectively removed 
from the mitochondrial network. The precise mechanism through which this occurs 
remains unclear. Previously, we showed that tau which has been mutated at 
Thr-231 to glutamic acid to mimic an Alzheimer's-relevant phospho-epitope 
expressed early in disease selectively inhibits oxidative stress-induced 
mitophagy in Caenorhabditis elegans. Here, we use immortalized mouse hippocampal 
neuronal cell lines to extend that result into mammalian cells. Specifically, we 
show that phosphomimetic tau at Ser-396/404 (EC) or Thr-231/Ser-235 (EM) partly 
inhibits mitophagy induction by paraquat, a potent inducer of mitochondrial 
oxidative stress. Moreover, a combination of immunologic and biochemical 
approaches demonstrates that the levels of the mitophagy receptor FKBP8, 
significantly decrease in response to paraquat in cells expressing EC or EM tau 
mutants, but not in cells expressing wildtype tau. In contrast, paraquat 
treatment results in a decrease in the levels of the mitophagy receptors FUNDC1 
and BNIP3 in the presence of both wildtype tau and the tau mutants. 
Interestingly, FKBP8 is normally trafficked to the endoplasmic reticulum during 
oxidative stress induced mitophagy, and our results support a model where this 
trafficking is impacted by disease-relevant tau, perhaps through a direct 
interaction. We provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying 
tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease and highlight FKBP8 receptor as a potential 
target for mitigating mitochondrial dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases.

The currently approved drugs for Alzheimer's disease (AD) are only for 
symptomatic treatment in the early stages of the disease but they could not halt 
the neurodegeneration, additionally, the safety profile of the recently 
developed immunotherapy is a big issue. This review aims to explain the 
importance of the drugs repurposing technique and strategy to develop therapy 
for AD. We illustrated the biological alterations in the pathophysiology of AD 
including the amyloid pathology, the Tau pathology, oxidative stress, 
mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation, glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity, 
insulin signaling impairment, wingless-related integration site/β-catenin 
signaling, and autophagy. Additionally, we demonstrated the different repurposed 
drugs in the experimental models of AD including the anti-inflammatory, 
anti-hypertensive, anti-diabetic, antiepileptic, antidepressant and anticancer 
drugs. Further, we showed the pipeline and FDA approved drugs for AD. The 
repurposed drugs have a promising therapeutic activity against AD, confirming 
the value of the drugs repurposing technique to elucidate curative therapy for 
AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a central nervous system degenerative disease with a 
stealthy onset and a progressive course characterized by memory loss, cognitive 
dysfunction, and abnormal psychological and behavioral symptoms. However, the 
pathogenesis of AD remains elusive. An increasing number of studies have shown 
that oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) and oligodendroglial lineage cells 
(OLGs), especially OPCs and mature oligodendrocytes (OLGs), which are derived 
from OPCs, play important roles in the pathogenesis of AD. OLGs function mainly 
by myelinating axons, transmitting electrical signals, and regulating neural 
development. In addition to myelin, OPCs and OLGs can also participate in AD 
pathogenesis in other ways. This review summarizes the mechanisms by which OPCs 
and OLGs affect myelin formation, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, the 
blood-brain barrier, synaptic function, and amyloid-beta protein and further 
elucidates the mechanisms by which oligodendrocyte lineage cells participate in 
AD pathogenesis and treatment, which is highly important for clarifying the 
pathogenesis of AD, clinical treatment, and prevention.

Cholesterol is vital for nerve processes. Changes in cholesterol homeostasis 
lead to neurodegeneration and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In recent years, 
extensive research has confirmed the influential role of adipose tissue 
mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in managing AD. The present study aims is to 
investigate a new approach concerning AD by MSCs with particular reference to 
the cholesterol homeostasis pathway and its regulatory miRNAs in an AD-like rat 
model. Three groups of 24 male Wistar rats have been divided: healthy rats 
(control), Alzheimer's rats (AD), and Alzheimer's rats that received MSCs 
(AD + MSC). Cholesterol level was measured using the GC-mass technique. The mRNA 
and expression levels of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR), 
apolipoprotein E (APOE), ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), and 
CYP46A1 genes, as well as their regulating miRNAs, were assessed using real-time 
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blotting techniques, 
respectively. Intraventricular transplantation of MSCs improved behavioral 
disorders and decreased the count of Aβ plaques in brain tissue. Transplantation 
of these cells also led to a significant decrease in cholesterol levels and 
HMGCR, ApoE, and ABCA1 and a remarkable increase in CYP46A1 mRNAs and protein 
expression. These cells considerably changed the expression of microRNAs 
regulating these genes. These results indicated that the examined miRNAs could 
be used as promising biomarkers for AD management. Additionally, the potential 
therapeutic role of MSCs in improving cholesterol levels the expression levels 
of the targeted miRNAs and their related genes in the cholesterol homeostasis 
pathway was established.

Cholinergic deficiency and neuroinflammation are the two main factors of 
Alzheimer's disease. Recent studies have shown that water-soluble ginseng 
oligosaccharides (WGOS) derived from Panax ginseng roots can protect against 
scopolamine-induced impairments in learning and memory. However, the fundamental 
mechanisms remain unclear for the most part. The purpose of this study was to 
examine the effect of WGOS on cholinergic function and protein levels of 
proinflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus of mice. Mice were first pretreated 
with WGOS or saline, and then treated with scopolamine to establish an 
Alzheimer's disease model. The cognition memory of the mice was assessed through 
the behavioral test. The effect of WGOS on the cholinergic system was evaluated 
by measuring acetylcholine (ACh) neurotransmitter concentration and 
acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in the hippocampus. Using ELISA, the 
inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α in the hippocampus were identified. This 
study found that WGOS treatment prevented the scopolamine-induced impairment of 
mice's recognition memory, as seen by their enhanced object recognition. In 
addition, WGOS prevented the scopolamine-induced decrease in ACh concentration 
and increase in AChE activity. Moreover, WGOS treatment inhibited 
scopolamine-induced upregulation of the inflammatory proteins IL-1β and TNF-α. 
These findings suggest that the amelioration of scopolamine-induced cognitive 
impairment in mice by WGOS was a consequence of the control of cholinergic 
function and inflammatory response in the hippocampus. Our findings suggest that 
WGOS should be investigated as a dietary supplement or medication for the 
treatment of learning and memory disorders in humans.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common progressive neurodegenerative disorder, and 
the vast majority of cases occur in elderly patients. Recently, the accumulation 
of Aβ and tau proteins has drawn considerable attention in AD research. This 
review explores the multifaceted interactions between these proteins and their 
contribution to the pathological landscape of AD, encompassing synaptic 
dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and PANoptosis. PANoptosis is a collective term 
for programmed cell death (PCD) modalities that encompass elements of apoptosis, 
pyroptosis, and necroptosis. The accumulation of Aβ peptides and tau proteins, 
along with the immune response in brain cells, may trigger PANoptosis, thus 
advancing the progression of the disease. Recent advancements in molecular 
imaging and genetics have provided deeper insights into the interactions between 
Aβ peptides, tau proteins, and the immune response. The review also discusses 
the role of mitochondrial dysregulation in AD. The exploration of the interplay 
between neurodegeneration, immune responses, and cell death offers promising 
avenues for the development of innovative treatments.

GASTRODIN PROTECTS AGAINST SEPSIS-ASSOCIATED ENCEPHALOPATHY BY SUPPRESSING 
FERROPTOSIS.

Background: Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) represents a severe 
complication of sepsis, substantially elevating both mortality and healthcare 
costs for patients. Gastrodin (GAS), a principal bioactive constituent of 
Gastrodia elata Blume, is neuroprotective in various neurological disorders, 
including ischemic stroke, epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, and neuropathic pain. 
In this study, we sought to investigate whether GAS could serve as a protective 
agent against SAE. Methods: Mice were subjected to cecal ligation and puncture 
(CLP) or the murine brain microvascular endothelial cell bEnd.3 was exposed to 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and subsequently treated with GAS. We assessed 
neurological deficits, blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity, neuroinflammation, 
and the state of ferroptosis to evaluate the regulation of GAS on SAE. 
Mechanistically, we utilized glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) knockout mice to 
delineate the crucial role of GPX4 and examined the cyclooxygenase-2 
(COX-2)/prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) pathway to uncover the upstream signaling of 
GPX4. Results: GAS mitigated neurological deficits in SAE mice and reduced BBB 
disruption and neuroinflammation both in vivo and in vitro . Functionally, the 
neuroprotective effects of GAS were realized through the inhibition of 
ferroptosis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that GPX4 played a pivotal role in 
this process. Lastly, we found that the COX-2/PGE2 pathway was activated 
following GAS treatment in SAE mice, thereby increasing the expression level of 
GPX4. Conclusions: Our study elucidated that GAS offers protection against SAE 
by suppressing ferroptosis through the activation of the COX-2/PGE2/GPX4 axis. 
This research validates the therapeutic potential of GAS and provides novel 
insights into potential therapeutic strategies for the management of SAE.

Microglia, as resident immune cells in the central nervous system (CNS), play a 
crucial role in maintaining homeostasis and phagocytosing metabolic waste in the 
brain. Senescent microglia exhibit decreased phagocytic capacity and increased 
neuroinflammation through senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). This 
process contributes to the development of various neurodegenerative diseases, 
including Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we found that SASP was 
elevated in senescent microglia, and proteomics showed that Tgm2 was 
upregulated. Mechanistically, we revealed that Tgm2-catalyzed covalent 
cross-linking of IκBα at K22 and Q248 residues in the cytoplasm of microglia, 
resulting in the reduction of IκBα and nuclear translocation of NF-κB to promote 
SASP production. Treatment of senescent microglia with Tgm2 inhibitors (Tg2-IN1 
and Cys-D) resulted in reduced NF-κB nuclear translocation and decreased SASP. 
Additionally, oral administration of Cys-D significantly improved the aging 
phenotype in aged mice. To summarize, Tgm2 is a potential target for antiaging, 
and inhibitors of Tgm2 can serve as novel prophylactics or senomorphics.

OBJECTIVE: Age-related hippocampal atrophy is associated with memory loss in 
older adults, and certain hippocampal subfields are more vulnerable to 
age-related atrophy than others. Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) may be an 
important protective factor for preserving hippocampal volume, but little is 
known about how CRF relates to the volume of specific hippocampal subfields, and 
whether associations between CRF and hippocampal subfield volumes are related to 
episodic memory performance. To address these gaps, the current study evaluates 
the associations among baseline CRF, hippocampal subfield volumes, and episodic 
memory performance in cognitively unimpaired older adults from the Investigating 
Gains in Neurocognition Trial of Exercise (IGNITE) (NCT02875301).
METHODS: Participants (N = 601, ages 65-80, 72% female) completed assessments 
including a graded exercise test measuring peak oxygen comsumption (VO2peak) to 
assess CRF, cognitive testing, and high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging of 
the hippocampus processed with Automated Segmentation of Hippocampal Subfields 
(ASHS). Separate linear regression models examined whether CRF was associated 
with hippocampal subfield volumes and whether those assocations were moderated 
by age or sex. Mediation models examined whether hippocampal volumes 
statistically mediated the relationship between CRF and episodic memory 
performance. Covariates included age, sex, years of education, body mass index, 
estimated intracranial volume, and study site.
RESULTS: Higher CRF was significantly associated with greater total left 
(B = 5.82, p = 0.039) and total right (B = 7.64, p = 0.006) hippocampal volume, 
as well as greater left CA2 (B = 0.14, p = 0.022) and dentate gyrus (DG; 
B = 2.34, p = 0.031) volume, and greater right CA1 (B = 3.99, p = 0.011), CA2 
(B = 0.15, p = 0.002), and subiculum (B = 1.56, p = 0.004) volume. Sex 
significantly moderated left DG volume (B = -4.26, p = 0.017), such that the 
association was positive and significant only for males. Total left hippocampal 
volume [indirect effect = 0.002, 95% CI (0.0002, 0.00), p = 0.027] and right 
subiculum volume [indirect effect = 0.002, 95% CI (0.0007, 0.01), p = 0.006] 
statistically mediated the relationship between CRF and episodic memory 
performance.
DISCUSSION: While higher CRF was significantly associated with greater total 
hippocampal volume, CRF was not associated with all underlying subfield volumes. 
Our results further demonstrate the relevance of the associations between CRF 
and hippocampal volume for episodic memory performance. Finally, our results 
suggest that the regionally-specific effects of aging and Alzheimer's disease on 
hippocampal subfields could be mitigated by maintaining higher CRF in older 
adulthood.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) has a major negative impact on people's 
quality of life, life, and health. More research is needed to determine the 
relationship between age and the pathologic products associated with AD. 
Meanwhile, the construction of an early diagnostic model of AD, which is mainly 
characterized by pathological products, is very important for the diagnosis and 
treatment of AD.
METHOD: We collected clinical study data from September 2005 to August 2024 from 
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Using 
correlation analysis method like cor function, we analyzed the pathology 
products (t-Tau, p-Tau, and Aβ proteins), age, gender, and Minimum Mental State 
Examination (MMSE) scores in the ADNI data. Next, we investigated the 
relationship between pathologic products and age in the AD and non-AD groups 
using linear regression. Ultimately, we used these features to build a 
diagnostic model for AD.
RESULTS: A total of 1,255 individuals were included in the study (mean [SD] age, 
73.27 [7.26] years; 691male [55.1%]; 564 female [44.9%]). The results of the 
correlation analysis showed that the correlations between pathologic products 
and age were, in descending order, Tau (Corr=0.75), p-Tau (Corr=0.71), and Aβ 
(Corr=0.54). In the AD group, t-Tau protein showed a tendency to decrease with 
age, but it was not statistically significant. p-Tau protein levels similarly 
decreased with age and its decrease was statistically significant. In contrast 
to Tau protein, in the AD group, Aβ levels increased progressively with age. In 
the non-AD group, the trend of pathologic product levels with age was 
consistently opposite to that of the AD group. We finally screened the optimal 
AD diagnostic model (AUC=0.959) based on the results of correlation analysis and 
by using the Xgboost algorithm and SVM algorithm.
CONCLUSION: In a novel finding, we observed that Tau protein and Aβ had opposite 
trends with age in both the AD and non-AD groups. The linear regression curves 
of the AD and non-AD groups had completely opposite trends. Through a machine 
learning approach, we constructed an AD diagnostic model with excellent 
performance based on the selected features.

Extracellular beta-amyloid aggregation and inflammation are in a complex and not 
fully understood interplay during hyperphosphorylated tau aggregation and 
pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Our group has previously shown that an 
immune challenge with tumour necrosis factor alpha can alter extracellular 
beta-sheet containing aggregates in human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived 
cortical neurons carrying familial Alzheimer's disease-related presenilin 1 
mutations. Here, using single-molecule detection and super-resolution imaging 
techniques, we quantified and characterized the intra- and extracellular 
beta-amyloid and AT8-positive tau aggregates. Our results indicate a 
pre-existing Alzheimer's disease-like pathology caused by the presenilin 1 
mutation, with increased beta-amyloid aggregates in both the cell lysate and 
conditioned media compared to isogenic controls and also increased intracellular 
tau aggregates. The main effect of tumour necrosis factor alpha treatment on 
presenilin 1 neurons was the formation of larger intracellular beta-amyloid 
aggregates. In contrast, isogenic controls showed more significant changes with 
tumour necrosis factor alpha treatment with an increase in beta-amyloid 
aggregates in the media but not intracellularly and an increase in tau 
aggregates in both the media and cell lysate, suggesting a chronic 
inflammation-driven mechanism for the development of sporadic Alzheimer's 
disease. Remarkably, we also found significant morphological differences between 
intra- and extracellular beta-amyloid and tau aggregates in human-induced 
pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical neurons, suggesting these neurons can 
only clear aggregates when small, and that larger aggregates stay inside the 
neurons. While majority of the beta-amyloid aggregates were cleared into the 
media, a greater portion of the tau aggregates remained intracellular. This 
size-dependent aggregate clearance was also shown to be conserved in vivo, using 
soaked and homogenized mouse and human post-mortem Alzheimer's disease brain 
samples. As such, our results are proposing a previously unknown, size-dependent 
aggregate clearance mechanism, which can possibly explain the intracellular 
aggregation of tau and extracellular aggregation of beta-amyloid.

INTRODUCTION: Adults with Down syndrome (DS) have an increased risk of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia, often showing neuropathological indicators by 
age 40. Physical function and activities of daily living (ADLs) are understudied 
areas of function that may inform dementia risk. We investigated associations 
among age, physical function (gait/balance, grip strength, and lower extremity 
strength), ADLs, and dementia risk symptoms in adults with DS. We hypothesized 
that compromised physical function and lower independence with ADLs would be 
associated with an informant/caregiver-reported measure of dementia risk 
symptoms.
METHODS: A secondary analysis for this cross-sectional study was completed using 
data from two academic research centers with 43 adults with DS (age 30 ± 12 
years). We examined the association of dementia risk symptoms, captured through 
the Dementia Screening Questionnaire for Individuals with Intellectual 
Disabilities (DSQIID), with physical function (timed up and go [TUG], 
sit-to-stand [STS], grip strength) and ADLs (Waisman Activities of Daily Living 
Scale). A linear regression model for the continuous dementia risk measure in 
the DSQIID used a log transformation of (1 + log(Y + 1)) to account for a high 
zero count. Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to assess differences in the 
physical function measures, DSQIID questionnaire, and Waisman ADL by dividing 
mean age categories.
RESULTS: Higher DSQIID scores were associated with lower independence with ADLs 
(β = -0.103, p = 0.008), slower gait times (TUG; β = 0.112, p = 0.034), and 
impaired lower extremity strength (STS; β = 0.112, p = 0.017) and grip strength 
(β = -0.039, p = 0.034). DSQIID scores differed significantly between the ≥30 
and <30 age groups. Participants ≥30 years of age scored 5 points higher on the 
DSQIID than participants <30, suggesting that age was associated with greater 
dementia risk.
DISCUSSION: Greater dementia risk symptoms were associated with age, lower 
physical function scores, and independence with ADLs, suggesting that declines 
in physical function and ADLs may be early indicators of subsequent dementia 
risk in adults with DS.
HIGHLIGHTS: We explored the association of physical function and activities of 
daily living (ADLs) in aging adults with DS and their relationship with 
informant/caregiver report of dementia risk symptoms.Our findings demonstrated a 
significant relationship between a higher number of dementia risk symptoms 
observed and lower independence with ADLs, and impaired gait/balance, grip 
strength, and lower extremity strength.Further research with larger longitudinal 
studies is necessary to investigate any causative relationships among physical 
function, ADL function, and dementia risk symptoms.

INTRODUCTION: The aggregation and spread of hyperphosphorylated, pathological 
tau in the human brain is hypothesized to play a key role in Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) as well as other neurogenerative tauopathies. O-GlcNAcylation, an important 
post-translational modification of tau and many other proteins, is significantly 
decreased in brain tissue of AD patients relative to healthy controls. Increased 
tau O-GlcNAcylation has been shown to reduce tau pathology in mouse in vivo 
tauopathy models. O-GlcNAcase (OGA) catalyzes the removal of O-GlcNAc from tau 
thereby driving interest in OGA inhibition as a potential therapeutic approach 
to reduce tau pathology and slow the progression of AD.
METHODS: A multidisciplinary approach was used to identify ceperognastat 
(LY3372689) as a potent OGA inhibitor, including an extensive discovery effort 
with synthetic chemistry, structure-based drug design, and in vivo OGA enzyme 
occupancy studies. Preclinical studies assessed the target engagement, 
inhibition of OGA enzyme activity, OGA enzyme occupancy, and changes in tau 
O-GlcNAc. Four clinical Phase 1 studies of ceperognastat in healthy participants 
were performed to assess clinical safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics 
(PK), and enzyme occupancy.
RESULTS: Ceperognastat is a potent, central nervous system (CNS)-penetrant, 
low-dose inhibitor of OGA, which can achieve > 95% OGA enzyme occupancy in 
animal and human brain. Overall, ceperognastat had an acceptable safety profile 
in Phase 1 clinical studies with no serious adverse events reported following 
single and multiple dosing. The PK, enzyme occupancy, and safety profile 
supported Phase 2 development of ceperognastat.
DISCUSSION: Ceperognastat is an orally available, highly potent, CNS-penetrant 
OGA inhibitor that achieved high (> 80%) OGA enzyme occupancy and increased 
brain O-GlcNAc-tau preclinically. Ceperognastat demonstrated > 95% OGA enzyme 
occupancy in Phase 1 trials. These occupancy data informed the dose selection 
for the Phase 2 clinical program.
HIGHLIGHTS: Ceperognastat is a highly potent, CNS-penetrant OGA 
inhibitor.Ceperognastat is both orally available and CNS-penetrant even when 
given at low doses.Ceperognastat can achieve > 95% OGA enzyme occupancy in the 
animal and human brain.Ceperognastat had an acceptable safety profile in Phase 1 
clinical studies.

INTRODUCTION: Without disease-modifying interventions, Medicare and Medicaid 
spending on Alzheimer's disease (AD) management is expected to reach 637 billion 
USD annually by 2050. The recent advent of promising AD therapies after decades 
of a near-total failure rate in clinical trials suggests that more 
disease-modifying therapies are on the horizon. In this review, we assess the 
late-stage pipeline of disease-modifying candidates for AD and offer a novel 
classification of intervention candidates by treatment paradigms-groups of 
candidates that share an underlying biological mechanism of action and general 
disease target.
METHODS: We extracted data from the National Library of Medicine clinical trials 
database regarding Phase 2 and 3 trials of disease-modifying AD therapies. We 
categorized trials into eight unique treatment paradigms, which we defined by 
combinations of therapy (biologic, small molecule, cell and gene therapy, other) 
and target (amyloid, tau, other). We analyzed primary endpoints, eligibility 
criteria including clinical ratings of cognition, trial phase and length, and 
funding sources.
RESULTS: We identified 123 unique disease-modifying intervention candidates in 
175 late-stage clinical trials. Biologic and small molecule drugs comprised 30% 
and 54% of trials, respectively. Eligibility criteria favored patients between 
the ages of 60 and 80 years with mild cognitive impairment. Including 
multi-phase trials, 81% of studies were engaged in Phase 2 and 27% in Phase 3. 
Notably, within the Biologic-Amyloid paradigm, 64% of trials were engaged in 
Phase 3.
DISCUSSION: Current studies of disease-modifying therapies for AD comprise a 
diverse set of approaches to treating the disease. However, effort is largely 
concentrated in a few treatment paradigms and a narrow patient population, 
causing varying rates of progress among treatment paradigms in the late-stage 
clinical trial pipeline. Strategies may be warranted to accelerate successes in 
the most promising therapeutical paradigms and nurture growth within nascent 
areas lacking resources but not potential.
HIGHLIGHTS: An analysis of Alzheimer's disease trial treatment paradigms was 
conducted.From April 2021 to March 2023, 175 trials of 123 unique candidates 
were reviewed.Biologic and small molecule drugs comprised 30% and 54% of trials, 
respectively.Eligibility criteria favored ages 60 through 80 with mild cognitive 
impairment.

INTRODUCTION: Hippocampal hyperactivity is a hallmark of prodromal Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) that predicts progression in patients with amnestic mild cognitive 
impairment (aMCI). AGB101 is an extended-release formulation of levetiracetam in 
the dose range previously demonstrated to normalize hippocampal activity and 
improve cognitive performance in aMCI. The HOPE4MCI study was a 78-week trial to 
assess the progression of MCI due to AD. As reported in Mohs et al., the decline 
in the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes score (CDR-SB) was reduced by 40% 
in apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 non-carriers over the 78-week duration of the 
study with a negligible effect in carriers. Here we report an exploratory 
analysis of the effects of AGB101 on neuroimaging and biomarker measures in the 
44 APOE ε4 non-carriers who completed the 78-week protocol.
METHODS: Structural magnetic resonance imaging scans obtained at baseline and 
after 78 weeks were analyzed using the Automated Segmentation of Hippocampal 
Subfields software providing volume measures of key structures of the medial 
temporal lobe relevant to AD progression. Blood samples collected at 78 weeks in 
the study were analyzed for plasma biomarkers.
RESULTS: Treatment with AGB101 significantly reduced atrophy of the left 
entorhinal cortex (ERC) compared to placebo. This reduction in atrophy was 
correlated with less decline in the CDR-SB score over 78 weeks and with lower 
neurofilament light chain (NfL), a marker of neurodegeneration.
DISCUSSION: The HOPE4MCI study showed that APOE ε4 non-carriers treated with 
AGB101 demonstrated a substantially more favorable treatment effect compared to 
carriers. Here we report that treatment with AGB101 in non-carriers of APOE ε4 
significantly reduced atrophy of the left ERC over 78 weeks. That reduction in 
atrophy was closely coupled with the change in CDR-SB and with plasma NfL 
indicative of neurodegeneration in the brain. These exploratory analyses are 
consistent with a reduction in neurodegeneration in APOE ε4 non-carriers treated 
with AGB101 before a clinical diagnosis of dementia.
HIGHLIGHTS: AGB101 slows entorhinal cortex (ERC) atrophy in apolipoprotein E 
(APOE) ε4 non-carriers with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's 
disease (AD).Slowing ERC atrophy by AGB101 is associated with less Clinical 
Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes decline.Slowing ERC atrophy by AGB101 is associated 
with lower neurofilament light chain.AGB101 treatment reduces neurodegeneration 
in APOE ε4 non-carriers with MCI due to AD.

OBJECTIVE: Physical activity (PA) has been linked to reduced Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) risk. However, less is known about its effects in the AD preclinical stage. 
We aimed to investigate whether greater PA was associated with lower plasma 
biomarkers of AD pathology, neural injury, reactive astrocytes, and better 
cognition in individuals with autosomal-dominant AD due to the presenilin-1 
E280A mutation who are virtually guaranteed to develop dementia.
METHODS: Twenty-eight cognitively unimpaired mutation carriers (ages x̄ = 29.28) 
wore a FitBit Charge-4 for 14 days. We calculated their average steps to measure 
locomotion, and Training Impulse (TRIMP) to quantify the intensity and duration 
of PAs using heart rate. Plasma amyloid beta 42/40 ratio, phosphorylated tau 
181, neurofilament light chain, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were 
measured. Cognition was assessed with the Consortium to Establish a Registry for 
Alzheimer's Disease word list learning and delayed recall, Trail Making Test 
Part A, and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-version IV Digit Span Backward. We 
conducted multiple linear regressions controlling for age, sex, body mass index, 
and education.
RESULTS: There were no associations among steps or TRIMP with plasma biomarkers 
or cognition. Greater TRIMP was related to higher GFAP levels.
CONCLUSIONS: PA was not associated with cognition or plasma biomarkers. However, 
greater intensity and duration of PAs were related to higher GFAP. Participants 
engaged very little in moderate to vigorous PA. Therefore, light PA may not 
exert a significant protective effect in preclinical AD. Future work with larger 
samples and longitudinal data is needed to elucidate further the potential 
impact of PA on AD progression in the preclinical stages.
HIGHLIGHTS: Locomotion (average steps) was not associated with plasma biomarkers 
or cognition.Greater training load (training impulse) was related to higher 
glial fibrillary acidic protein levels in mutation carriers.Light physical 
activity may not suffice to exert a protective effect on Alzheimer's disease.

The Alzheimer's disease (AD) research community continues to make great strides 
in expanding approaches for early detection and treatment of the disease, 
including recent advances in our understanding of fundamental AD pathophysiology 
beyond the classical targets: beta-amyloid and tau. Recent clinical trial 
readouts implicate a variety of non-amyloid/non-tau (NANT) approaches that show 
promise in slowing cognitive decline for people with AD. The Alzheimer's 
Association Research Roundtable (AARR) meeting held on December 13-14, 2022, 
reviewed the current state of NANT targets on underlying AD pathophysiology and 
their contribution to cognitive decline, the current data on a diverse range of 
NANT biomarkers and therapeutic targets, and the integration of NANT concepts in 
clinical trial designs. Participants also discussed the current definition of 
therapies that target underlying AD pathophysiology, what endpoints best define 
what is considered a meaningful change beyond the current approved definition 
for clinical efficacy, and how the recent NANT findings should inform the 
development of future guidelines for AD classification and personalized 
treatment strategies.
HIGHLIGHTS: The Alzheimer's Association Research Roundtable (AARR) convened 
leaders from industry, academia, and government to review the current state of 
non-beta amyloid and non-tau (NANT) targets on underlying Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) pathophysiology.The totality of scientific and clinical evidence supports 
the hypothesis that emerging NANT targets play a role in cognitive decline and 
neurodegeneration in AD. New biomarkers based on NANT targets must be globally 
developed and implemented with specific consideration of fluid biomarkers as a 
cost-effective clinical option, to ensure better, more equitable treatment 
options for AD.

The Alzheimer's disease (AD) research field has entered a new era, where our 
fundamental understanding of the pathophysiology of AD and advances in 
biomarkers have not only allowed for earlier, timely, and accurate detection and 
diagnosis of the disease, but that amyloid removal has been shown to be 
associated with signals of slowing cognitive and functional decline. Although 
recent FDA-approved amyloid plaque-lowering monoclonal antibody therapies have 
shifted the trajectory of AD, additional treatment options will be key to 
further slowing clinical decline or stopping disease progression. Thus, new and 
emerging therapies for AD have created an evolving therapeutic landscape. The 
Alzheimer's Association Research Roundtable (AARR) Spring meeting held on May 
23-34, 2023, brought together a broad array of scientific leaders from the AARR 
membership, academia, industry, and government and regulatory agencies to 
discuss the future of clinical trials in an era of regulator-approved 
amyloid-targeting therapies. Participants discussed lessons learned from other 
neurological diseases where disease-modifying treatments were first approved and 
key considerations for future clinical trials, for example, trial population 
real-world representativeness, duration, biomarker screening, efficacy 
endpoints, combination therapy, as well as overall trial design and the ethical 
and equity concerns that clinicians, patients, and their families face when 
considering clinical trial participation.
HIGHLIGHTS: The Alzheimer's Association Research Roundtable (AARR) convened 
leaders from industry and academia, as well as patients, clinicians, and 
government and regulatory agency scientists to discuss the topic, "Alzheimer's 
Disease Drug Development in an Evolving Therapeutic Landscape."While recently 
approved amyloid-targeting therapies show great promise in providing clinically 
meaningful outcomes for patients and families, additional treatments, and a 
better understanding of dosing and administration of these approved treatments, 
are needed to further slow and eventually prevent clinical decline in 
AD.Approved therapies will impact many aspects of clinical trial design 
including the use of placebo-controls, participant re-enrollment, safety 
monitoring, as well as biomarker selection.This exciting new era in AD research 
represents a hopeful future for clinicians, patients, and their care partners.

Objective: The aim of the current study was to study the therapeutic potential 
of chrysin against repeated intranasal amyloid-beta (Aβ)-induced interleukin-17 
(IL-17) signaling in a mouse model of AD. Methods: Male BALB/c mice were daily 
exposed to intranasal Aβ1-42 (10 μg/10 μL) for seven consecutive days. Chrysin 
was orally administered at doses of 25, 50 and 100 mg kg-1 in 0.5% sodium 
carboxy methyl cellulose suspension from day 5 of Aβ1-42 administration for 
seven days. Following the treatment, the memory of the animals was appraised 
using Morris water maze, novel object recognition and passive avoidance tests. 
Further, the effects of chrysin on Aβ1-42-induced IL-17 signaling and redox 
levels were evaluated in the cortex and hippocampus regions of the mouse brain 
through western blot and immunohistochemistry. Results: The exposure to Aβ1-42 
through the intranasal route induced a significant decline in the spatial, 
learning and cognitive memory of the animals, and most interestingly, exposure 
to Aβ1-42 triggered IL-17-mediated signaling, which resulted in a significant 
increase in the expression of IL-17RA, Act1 and TRAF6. Furthermore, Aβ1-42 
impaired the tissue redox level and inflammatory cytokines in the mouse brain. 
Alternatively, treatment with chrysin at 25, 50 and 100 mg kg-1 oral doses 
alleviated Aβ1-42-mediated memory decline, impaired redox levels and 
inflammation. Specifically, chrysin downregulated the expression of IL-17 and 
mediated signaling in the brain regions of the mice. Conclusion: Chrysin was 
evidenced to be a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent, clearly 
showing a protective role against Aβ1-42-induced IL-17-mediated inflammation in 
the brain of the mice.

This review demonstrates the value of central pharmacodynamics (PD), including 
positron emission tomography (PET) and computerized cognitive testing, to 
supplement pharmacokinetic (PK) and peripheral PD for determining the target 
dose range for clinical efficacy testing of emestedastat, an 11β-hydroxysteroid 
dehydrogenase 1 (11β-HSD1) inhibitor. Combined data from 6 clinical trials in 
cognitively normal volunteers and patients with Alzheimer disease included a 
population PK model, endocrine PD, a human PET trial (11β-HSD1 brain imaging), 
and computerized cognitive testing. PK and PET findings were similar in 
volunteers and patients with Alzheimer disease. PK modeling suggested that 20 mg 
daily would be optimal to maintain cerebrospinal fluid concentrations above the 
brain half maximal inhibitory concentration. However, subsequent PET scanning 
suggested that emestedastat doses of 10 or even 5 mg daily may be sufficient to 
adequately inhibit 11β-HSD1. With once-daily doses of 5-20 mg in cognitively 
normal, older volunteers, a consistent pattern of pro-cognitive benefit, without 
dose-response, was seen as improvement in attention and working memory but not 
episodic memory. Thus, emestedastat therapeutic activity might be attained at 
doses lower than those predicted from cerebrospinal fluid drug levels. Doses as 
low as 5 mg daily may be efficacious and were studied in subsequent trials.

BACKGROUND: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) β2-microglobulin (β2M) has been 
demonstrated as an important factor in β-amyloid (Aβ) neurotoxicity and a 
potential target for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, more investigation is 
required to ascertain the relationship between β2M and glial activities in AD 
pathogenesis.
METHODS: In this study, 211 participants from the Alzheimer's disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) with CSF and Plasma β2M, CSF glial fibrillary 
acidic protein (GFAP), soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 
(sTREM2), Aβ42, phosphorylated-tau (P-tau) and total tau (T-tau) were divided 
into four groups, stage 0, 1, 2, and suspected non-AD pathology (SNAP) based on 
the National Institute on Aging- Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) criteria. 
Multiple linear regression, linear mixed effects models, and causal mediation 
analyses bootstrapped 10,000 iterations were used to investigate the underlying 
associations among β2M and CSF biomarkers at baseline and during a longitudinal 
visit.
RESULTS: CSF β2M concentration decreased with amyloid in stage 1 compared with 
stage 0 and increased with tau pathology and neurodegeneration in stage 2 and 
SNAP compared with stage 1. Moreover, CSF β2M level was positively correlated 
with the Aβ42 (β = 0.230), P-tau (β = 0.564), T-tau (β = 0.603), GFAP 
(β = 0.552), and sTREM2 (β = 0.641) (all P < 0.001). CSF β2M was only 
longitudinally correlated with T-tau change. The correlation of CSF β2M with 
P-tau (proportion = 25.4%, P < 0.001) and T-tau (proportion = 26.7%, P < 0.001) 
was partially mediated by GFAP in total participants, reproduced in late-life 
individuals. Furthermore, the astrocyte cascade also partially mediated the 
pathological relationship between CSF β2M and tau pathology 
(β2M → GFAP → YKL-40 → P-tau/T-tau, IE: 0.424-0.435, all P < 0.001). 
Nevertheless, the mediation effects of sTREM2 were not significant. 
Additionally, there was no association between plasma β2M and CSF biomarkers.
CONCLUSIONS: CSF β2M is dynamic in AD pathology and associated with 
neuroinflammation. CSF GFAP might mediate the association between β2M and tau 
pathology, complementing the existing research on the effect of β2M in AD 
pathology and providing a new perspective on treatment.

Advance Care Planning Billing Codes Associated With Decreased Healthcare 
Utilization in Neurological Disease.

University-Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, Hershey, Pennsylvania; Sol De 
Jesus, MD, Department of Neurology, Pennsylvania State University-Milton S. 
Hershey Medical Center, Hershey, Pennsylvania; Emily Leboffe, MD, Department of

GOALS: Advance care planning (ACP) procedure codes have been established to 
reimburse meaningful care goal discussions; however, the utilization frequency 
of these codes in neurological disease is unknown. The objective of this study 
is to identify the association between ACP codes and healthcare utilization in 
chronic neurodegenerative diseases.
METHODS: This is a multicenter cohort study using real-world electronic health 
data. Using the TriNetX database, we collected electronic health data from 92 
institutions in the United States. We included patients aged 65 and older who 
had been diagnosed with one of four neurological diseases: Alzheimer's disease, 
Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). 
Patients with congestive heart failure were included as a reference. From the 
64,683,009 total patients in the database, 877,138 had Alzheimer's disease, 
544,610 had Parkinson's disease, 208,341 had multiple sclerosis, 9,944 had 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and 1,500,186 had congestive heart failure. For 
each disease, we compared hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits 
over a two-year period between patients with and without ACP codes documented. 
Then, in patients with ACP, we investigated the rates of hospitalizations and ED 
visits over the two years before ACP and two years after ACP to understand the 
impact of ACP on the healthcare utilization trend. All patients had records for 
at least two years after index.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The rate of ACP code documentation ranged from 1.8% of 
multiple sclerosis patients to 3.6% of Alzheimer's disease patients. After 
matching for demographic and health variables, usage of ACP codes was associated 
with significantly fewer hospitalizations for Alzheimer's disease patients. 
Across all diseases, there was a 20% to 30% decrease in ED visits, which was 
significant. Furthermore, there was a significant change in the trend of 
hospitalizations and ED visits for patients after ACP documentation. Patients 
went from increasing utilization before ACP documentation to decreasing 
utilization after documentation.
PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: ACP billing codes are used infrequently in neurological 
disease, which may indicate that reimbursement alone is not sufficient to drive 
code usage. Usage of ACP billing codes was associated with decreased healthcare 
utilization, particularly in terms of ED visits. Beyond the primary objective of 
providing goal-concordant care, ACP may impact the economic burden of chronic 
neurodegenerative disease, which has high costs of care in our aging society. 
There may be particular benefits with Alzheimer's disease, which had an impact 
on both hospitalizations and ED visits and is the most prevalent 
neurodegenerative disease. Future work is needed to better understand the best 
implementation strategy for ACP in a multifaceted approach that emphasizes 
patient care preferences for their illness.

Alzheimer's disease is characterized by progressive amyloid deposition and 
cognitive decline, yet the pathological mechanisms and treatments remain 
elusive. Here we report the therapeutic potential of low-intensity 40 hertz blue 
light exposure in a 5xFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. Our findings 
reveal that light treatment prevents memory decline in 4-month-old 5xFAD mice 
and motivation loss in 14-month-old 5xFAD mice, accompanied by restoration of 
glial water channel aquaporin-4 polarity, improved brain drainage efficiency, 
and a reduction in hippocampal lipid accumulation. We further demonstrate the 
beneficial effects of 40 hertz blue light are mediated through the activation of 
the vLGN/IGL-Re visual circuit. Notably, concomitant use of anti-Aβ antibody 
with 40 hertz blue light demonstrates improved soluble Aβ clearance and 
cognitive performance in 5xFAD mice. These findings offer functional evidence on 
the therapeutic effects of 40 hertz blue light in Aβ-related pathologies and 
suggest its potential as a supplementary strategy to augment the efficacy of 
antibody-based therapy.

Different forms of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) have shown strong potential as 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers in both cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and 
plasma. We hypothesized that p-tau proteoforms simultaneously phosphorylated at 
two different sites may have an increased diagnostic value compared with tau 
phosphorylated at a single site. Here, we developed two immunoassays detecting 
CSF and plasma tau simultaneously phosphorylated at both T181 and T231 
(p-tau181&231) and at T217 and T231 (p-tau217&231). Subsequently, we measured 
CSF and plasma p-tau181&231, p-tau217&231, p-tau181, p-tau217, and p-tau231 
levels in two cohorts across the AD continuum and in frontotemporal dementia 
(FTD) patients (discovery n = 55, validation n = 118). CSF and plasma 
p-tau217&231, p-tau181, p-tau217, and p-tau231 and CSF, but not plasma, 
p-tau181&231 were significantly elevated in all AD continuum groups vs. 
Neurological Disease Control group. Notably, plasma p-tau217&231 consistently 
showed an improved diagnostic performance compared with single-site 
phosphorylation assays - p-tau217 or p-tau231. The differences observed between 
CSF and plasma measurements suggest matrix-specific protein processing, 
underscoring the need for further research on the dynamics of tau 
phosphorylation pattern along the AD continuum.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder with complex etiologies, 
manifests through a cascade of pathological changes before clinical symptoms 
become apparent. Among these early changes, alterations in the expression of 
non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have emerged as pivotal events. In this study, we 
focused on the aberrant expression of ncRNAs and revealed that Lamr1-ps1, a 
pseudogene of the laminin receptor, significantly exacerbates early spatial 
learning and memory deficits in APP/PS1 mice. Through a combination of 
bioinformatics prediction and experimental validation, we identified the 
miR-29c/Bace1 pathway as a potential regulatory mechanism by which Lamr1-ps1 
influences AD pathology. Importantly, augmenting the miR-29c-3p levels in mice 
ameliorated memory deficits, underscoring the therapeutic potential of targeting 
miR-29c-3p in early AD intervention. This study not only provides new insights 
into the role of pseudogenes in AD but also consolidates a foundational basis 
for considering miR-29c as a viable therapeutic target, offering a novel avenue 
for AD research and treatment strategies.

The 2024 Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections featured new 
and impactful findings about neuropsychiatric complications in people with HIV 
and other infections. Reports included new evidence from low- and middleincome 
countries, HIV persistence in the central nervous system, aging-related 
complications (including cerebrovascular disease), additional data relevant to 
pathogenesis, and therapeutics. Also included were new evidence of active HIV 
RNA transcription in cells from cerebrospinal fluid and the brain during virally 
suppressive antiretroviral therapy as well as links between neuropsychiatric 
complications or brain imaging findings in people with HIV and a) carotid artery 
inflammation and cerebrovascular disease, b) Alzheimer's disease genetic risk, 
c) social determinants of health, including exposure to pollution, and d) 
epigenetic aging. New therapeutic findings were presented on the cerebrospinal 
fluid inhibitory quotient, the effects of polypharmacy, and clinical trials of 
tesamorelin and telmisartan. This review summarizes these and other new findings 
and highlights new research directions for the neuro-HIV field.

Vascular dementia (VaD) is a second most common type of dementia subsequent to 
Alzheimer disease (AD). VaD is characterized by cognitive impairment and memory 
loss that may progress due to the development of cerebral amyloid angiopathy 
(CAA) a hallmark of AD. CAA triggers the progression of ischemic and hemorrhagic 
strokes with the subsequent the development of VaD and mixed dementia. Early 
diagnosis of patients with appropriate use of anti-inflammatory can prevent 
CAA-related inflammation and VaD development. Currently, there are no effective 
drugs in the management of VaD. Of note, cholesterol-lowering agent statins 
which are commonly used in patients with vascular diseases and dyslipidemia may 
affect the progression of VaD. Many previous studies highlighted the potential 
therapeutic efficacy of statins in treating VaD. Though, the underlying 
mechanisms of statins in prevention and treatment of VaD are not fully 
clarified. Consequently, this review aims to discuss the mechanistic role of 
statins in the management of VaD, and how statins may adversely affect the 
cognitive function in VaD patients.

BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury is associated with greater risk and earlier 
onset of dementia.
OBJECTIVE: This study investigated whether later-life changes in subjective 
cognition and behavior - potential markers of Alzheimer disease - could be 
observed in cognitively unimpaired older persons with a history of suspected 
mild traumatic brain injury (smTBI) earlier in life and whether changes in 
cognition and behavior mediated the link between smTBI and daily function.
METHODS: Data for 1392 participants from the Canadian Platform for Research 
Online to Investigate Health, Quality of Life, Cognition, Behaviour, Function, 
and Caregiving in Aging were analyzed. A validated self-reported brain injury 
screening questionnaire was used to determine the history of smTBI. Outcomes 
were measured using the Everyday Cognition scale (for subjective cognitive 
decline [SCD]), Mild Behavioral Impairment (MBI) Checklist, and Standard 
Assessment of Global Everyday Activities (for function). Inverse probability of 
treatment weighted logistic and negative binomial regressions were used to model 
smTBI (exposure) associations with SCD and MBI statuses, and Everyday 
Cognition-II and MBI Checklist total scores, respectively. Mediation analyses 
were conducted using bootstrapping.
RESULTS: History of smTBI was linked to higher odds of SCD (odds ratio = 1.45, 
95% confidence interval: [1.14-1.84]) or MBI (odds ratio = 1.75, 95% confidence 
interval: [1.54-1.98]), as well as 24% (95% confidence interval: [18%-31%]) 
higher Everyday Cognition-II and 52% (95% confidence interval: [41%-63%]) higher 
MBI Checklist total scores. Finally, SCD and MBI mediated approximately 45% and 
56%, respectively, of the association between smTBI history and poorer function, 
as indicated by higher Standard Assessment of Global Everyday Activities total 
scores.
CONCLUSIONS: smTBI at any point in the life course is linked to poorer cognition 
and behavior even in community-dwelling older persons without MCI or dementia. 
Older persons with smTBI may benefit from early dementia risk assessment using 
tools that measure changes in cognition and behavior. Interventions for 
declining cognition and behavior may also be beneficial in this population to 
address functional impairment.

Early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, 
improves treatment and care outcomes for patients. Early signs of cognitive 
decline can be detected using functional scales, which are written records 
completed by a clinician or carer, detailing a patient's capability to perform 
routine activities of daily living. For example, tasks requiring planning, such 
as meal preparation, are some of the earliest affected by early mild cognitive 
impairment. In this article, we describe work towards the development of a 
system to automatically discriminate and objectively quantify activities of 
daily living. We train a selection of neural networks to discriminate a novel 
list of 14 activities, specially selected to overlap with those measured by 
existing functional scales. Our dataset consists of eight hours of development 
data captured from four individuals wearing the Continuous Ambulatory Vestibular 
Assessment (CAVA) device, which was originally developed to aid the diagnosis of 
vertigo. Using frequency domain recognition features derived from eye-movement 
and accelerometer data, we compare several classification approaches, including 
three bespoke neural networks, and two established network architectures 
commonly applied to time-series classification problems. In 10-fold 
cross-validation experiments, a peak mean accuracy of 64.1% is obtained. The 
highest accuracy across all folds is 75.3%, produced by networks comprising 
Gated Recurrent Units. The addition of eye-movement data is shown to improve 
discrimination compared to using accelerometer data alone, by close to 9%. 
Classification accuracy is shown to degrade if the system is trained such that 
test subjects are excluded from the training data, with the small size of the 
dataset given as a likely explanation. Our findings demonstrate that the 
addition of eye-movement data can significantly improve the discrimination of 
daily activities, and that neural networks are well suited to this task.

>OBJECTIVE: Cognitive dysfunction is a common symptom of post-COVID-19 condition 
(PCC). Few studies have examined rates and predictors of cognitive performance 
validity test (PVT) failure in patients seeking treatment for PCC.
>METHODS: We report the rates of PVT failure in 323 patients who received care 
in a long-COVID-19 clinic for any post-COVID-19 health concern and underwent 
routine telephone cognitive testing that included two embedded PVTs. Binary 
logistic regressions examined the demographic, illness, and psychological 
variables associated with PVT failure.
>RESULTS: The prevalence of single PVT failure ranged from 4.7% to 26.1% whereas 
failure on both PVTs occurred in just 6.3%. Illness characteristics, subjective 
cognitive dysfunction, and most demographic and psychological variables were 
unrelated to single PVT failure. Males and those with anxiety were more likely 
to fail both PVTs.
>CONCLUSION: Failure across multiple PVTs was not common and was unrelated to 
COVID-19 severity or cognitive complaints.

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) refers to cognitive alterations with 
preservation of functionality. Individuals with this diagnosis have a higher 
risk of developing dementia. Non-pharmacological interventions, such as physical 
exercise, are beneficial for the cognition of this population. However, the 
impact of resistance training (RT) on the brain anatomy of older adults with MCI 
has not yet been clarified. This study aimed to investigate the effects of RT on 
cognition and brain anatomy in MCI. Forty-four older adults with MCI, 22 in the 
training group and 22 in the control group, were evaluated in neuropsychological 
tests and magnetic resonance imaging at the beginning and end of the study, 
which lasted 24 weeks. We used repeated measures ANOVA. The training group 
showed better performance in verbal episodic memory after intervention. The 
control group showed a decrease in gray matter volume in the hippocampus and 
precuneus, while the training group showed no reduction in the right hippocampus 
and precuneus. However, it showed a decrease in the volume of these regions on 
the left side and in the left superior frontal gyrus. In the analysis of white 
matter integrity, fractional anisotropy increased in the training group and 
decreased in the control group. Axial diffusivity decreased in the training 
group, while radial diffusivity increased in the control group, and mean 
diffusivity varied according to the tract evaluated. RT improves memory 
performance, positively influences white matter integrity parameters, and plays 
a protective role against atrophy of the hippocampus and precuneus in MCI.

Plant-based foods with low methionine contents have gained increasing interest 
for their potential health benefits, including neuroprotective effects. 
Methionine restriction (MR) linked to a plant-based diet has been shown to 
mitigate neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) through 
mechanisms that involve the gut microbiota. In this study, a 16-week MR diet 
(0.17% methionine, w/w) improved working memory and reduced neuronal damage 
exclusively in 4-month-old male APP/PS1 AD mice. Transcriptomic analysis 
revealed the activation of serum- and glucose-corticoid-regulated kinase 1 
(SGK1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) pathways. 
Furthermore, metabolomics demonstrated increased serum indole-3-propionic acid 
(IPA) levels and an enhanced expression of gut barrier proteins Claudin-1 and 
MUC2 in male mice. MR significantly altered the gut microbiota composition, 
notably increasing indole-producing bacteria such as Lactobacillus reuteri (L. 
reuteri). Multiomics integration linked L. reuteri, IPA, and PPARα signaling to 
improved cognitive outcomes. Molecular docking and RT-qPCR analyses confirmed 
IPA's interaction with PPARα, leading to the activation of neuroprotective 
targets (Bdnf, Pparα, Acsbg1, Scd2, and Scd3). These results highlight the role 
of methionine restriction in modulating gut microbiota and metabolites, offering 
a promising dietary approach to managing neurodegenerative diseases with 
sex-specific effects.

Histone methylation, a crucial aspect of epigenetics, intricately involves 
specialized enzymes such as G9a, a histone methyltransferase (HMT) catalyzing 
the methylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) and H3K27. Apart from histone 
modification, G9a regulates essential cellular processes such as 
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) replication, damage repair, and gene expression via 
modulating DNA methylation patterns. The dysregulation and overexpression of G9a 
are intricately linked to cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis, making 
it a compelling target for anticancer therapy. Moreover, aberrant levels of H3K9 
dimethylation were identified in Alzheimer's disease (AD), broadening the scope 
of epigenetic implications across various pathologies. The quest for potent 
therapy has resulted in the identification of numerous G9a inhibitors/degraders, 
each demonstrating the potential to disrupt aberrant signaling pathways. This 
perspective provides valuable insights into the evolving potential and 
advancement of G9a modulators as promising candidates for treating a spectrum of 
diseases.

Cognitive impairment, changes in mood, and decrease in fine motor skills are 
some of the most common symptoms experienced by individuals with Alzheimer's 
Disease (AD). This study aimed to investigate the effects of the Turkish 
intelligence and strategy game Mangala on cognitive functions, anxiety, 
depression, and fine motor skills in individuals with AD. In this randomized 
controlled study, 37 participants were divided into Mangala Group (MG) and 
Control Group (CG). Both the MG (n = 18) and the CG (n = 19) attended daily 
physiotherapy and rehabilitation sessions. Additionally, the MG played Mangala 2 
sessions/week for six weeks. The mood state was evaluated using the Hospital 
Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD), cognitive functions were examined using the 
Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MoCA), and fine motor skills were measured 
using the Nine Hole Peg Test (NHPT). There was no significant difference between 
the groups pretreatment in terms of MoCA, depression and NHPT values (p > .05), 
except anxiety levels (p= .009) The MG showed significant improvement 
post-treatment in terms of MoCA and HAD anxiety (p =.0001 and p =.0008), HAD 
depression and fine motor skills (p =.043 and p =.0001). There were significant 
improvements in favor of MG in MoCA (p =.014) and NHPT (p =.004), but not in HAD 
anxiety (p =.782) and depression (p =.514) scores in terms of delta (difference 
between pre and post treatment) values. To prevent cognitive decline, reduce 
depression, and improve fine motor skills in patients with AD, The Mangala game 
may be a good alternative.

Background: Cathepsin D (Ctsd) has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to its role in degrading intracellular amyloid beta 
(Aβ). Enhancing Ctsd activity could reduce Aβ42 accumulation and restore the 
Aβ42/40 ratio, offering a potential AD treatment strategy. Methods: This study 
explored Ctsd demethylation in AD mouse models using dCas9-Tet1-mediated 
epigenome editing. We identified dCas9-Tet1 as an effective tool for 
demethylating the endogenous Ctsd gene in primary neurons and in vivo brains. 
Results: Treatment with Ctsd-targeted dCas9-Tet1 in primary neurons 
overexpressing mutant APP (mutAPP) reduced Aβ peptide levels and the Aβ42/40 
ratio. Additionally, in vivo demethylation of Ctsd via dCas9-Tet1 in 5xFAD mice 
significantly altered Aβ levels and alleviated cognitive and behavioral 
deficits. Conclusion: These findings offer valuable insights into developing 
epigenome editing-based gene therapy strategies for AD.

BACKGROUND: Arts therapies, encompassing art therapy, music therapy, drama 
therapy, and dance movement therapy with the broader practice of expressive arts 
therapies, have demonstrated positive outcomes in the treatment of 
neurodevelopmental and neurological disorders (NNDs). Integrating arts therapies 
into telehealth has become increasingly important to improve accessibility for 
people with mobility impairments or those living in remote areas. This study 
aims to map the existing body of literature to provide an in-depth overview of 
telehealth in arts therapies for individuals with NNDs.
METHODOLOGY: This scoping review followed the PRISMA guidelines. Six databases 
were systematically searched, with 2,888 articles screened for eligibility. 
Inclusion criteria focused on primary research peer-reviewed articles in English 
that addressed telehealth arts therapies for NNDs.
RESULTS: Seventeen telehealth studies published between 2009 and March 2024 were 
included, with a notable increase in publications after 2020. The studies 
covered various neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum 
disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Rett syndrome, and 
neurological disorders such as stroke, epilepsy, cerebral palsy, central nervous 
system (CNS) tumors, dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, spinal 
cord injuries, and mild cognitive impairment. Music therapy was the most widely 
studied modality. Interventions ranged from therapeutic singing and songwriting 
to virtual reality experiences. Different platforms and specialized virtual 
environments were used alongside pre-recorded sessions. Positive benefits 
included psychological enrichment, social connectivity, cognitive improvements, 
and brain changes, although some studies reported mixed or no significant 
effects in certain areas.
CONCLUSION: Telehealth in arts therapies significantly benefits individuals with 
NNDs, improving accessibility and providing psychological, emotional, social, 
and cognitive benefits. The positive benefits observed highlight the potential 
of these interventions to improve overall well-being and daily functioning. 
Future research may focus on high-quality qualitative studies and neuroimaging 
assessments to further validate the impact of telehealth arts therapies.

INTRODUCTION: Empathy is a fundamental element of high-quality healthcare, 
though it has been shown to be in decline among medical students and residents. 
Appeals have therefore been made for the development of evidence-based 
empathy-enhancing experiential learning and training models. Bringing Art to 
Life (BATL) is a service-learning program designed within experiential learning 
pedagogy for psychology and pre-healthcare students. Intergenerational 
relationships are fostered with people with dementia through art therapy and 
life story/narrative at a community-based adult day services center.
METHODS: In this sequential mixed methods study, quantitative data were 
collected via electronic surveys of students in this course compared with 
students in didactic introductory psychology or psychology and aging courses. 
Survey measures included empathy, mindfulness, positive and negative affect, 
future time perspective, and attitudes toward older adults and working with 
people with dementia. Weekly BATL student journals submitted as part of their 
course requirements were analyzed using qualitative content analysis.
RESULTS: Within-subjects analyses of variance revealed increases in empathy and 
positive affect, broadened time perspective, and improved attitudes toward older 
adults and people with dementia among students in the BATL course compared with 
other undergraduate students. Analysis of BATL student journals supported and 
deepened understanding of these findings, with themes including attitude change, 
relationship building fostering existential awareness and self-development, art 
fostering social interactions, and perceived program effectiveness.
DISCUSSION: The findings suggest that BATL strongly supports increased 
empathetic attitudes and decreased stigma of aging in psychology and 
pre-healthcare students. Intergenerational expressive arts-based programs like 
BATL should be implemented in healthcare education to enhance empathy and 
improve attitudes toward aging and dementia care.

Loss of Y chromosome (LOY) is the most commonly occurring post-zygotic (somatic) 
mutation in male individuals. The past decade of research suggests that LOY has 
important effects in shaping the activity of the immune system, and multiple 
studies have shown the effects of LOY on a range of diseases, including cancer, 
neurodegeneration, cardiovascular disease and acute infection. Epidemiological 
findings have been corroborated by functional analyses providing insights into 
the mechanisms by which LOY modulates the immune system; in particular, a causal 
role for LOY in cardiac fibrosis, bladder cancer and Alzheimer disease has been 
indicated. These insights show that LOY is a highly dynamic mutation (such that 
LOY clones expand and contract with time) and has pleiotropic, 
cell-type-specific effects. Here, we review the status of the field and 
highlight the potential of LOY as a biomarker and target of new therapeutics 
that aim to counteract its negative effects on the immune system.

Aging, a universal and inevitable process, is characterized by a progressive 
accumulation of physiological alterations and functional decline over time, 
leading to increased vulnerability to diseases and ultimately mortality as age 
advances. Lifestyle factors, notably physical activity (PA) and exercise, 
significantly modulate aging phenotypes. Physical activity and exercise can 
prevent or ameliorate lifestyle-related diseases, extend health span, enhance 
physical function, and reduce the burden of non-communicable chronic diseases 
including cardiometabolic disease, cancer, musculoskeletal and neurological 
conditions, and chronic respiratory diseases as well as premature mortality. 
Physical activity influences the cellular and molecular drivers of biological 
aging, slowing aging rates-a foundational aspect of geroscience. Thus, PA serves 
both as preventive medicine and therapeutic agent in pathological states. 
Sub-optimal PA levels correlate with increased disease prevalence in aging 
populations. Structured exercise prescriptions should therefore be customized 
and monitored like any other medical treatment, considering the dose-response 
relationships and specific adaptations necessary for intended outcomes. Current 
guidelines recommend a multifaceted exercise regimen that includes aerobic, 
resistance, balance, and flexibility training through structured and incidental 
(integrated lifestyle) activities. Tailored exercise programs have proven 
effective in helping older adults maintain their functional capacities, 
extending their health span, and enhancing their quality of life. Particularly 
important are anabolic exercises, such as Progressive resistance training (PRT), 
which are indispensable for maintaining or improving functional capacity in 
older adults, particularly those with frailty, sarcopenia or osteoporosis, or 
those hospitalized or in residential aged care. Multicomponent exercise 
interventions that include cognitive tasks significantly enhance the hallmarks 
of frailty (low body mass, strength, mobility, PA level, and energy) and 
cognitive function, thus preventing falls and optimizing functional capacity 
during aging. Importantly, PA/exercise displays dose-response characteristics 
and varies between individuals, necessitating personalized modalities tailored 
to specific medical conditions. Precision in exercise prescriptions remains a 
significant area of further research, given the global impact of aging and broad 
effects of PA. Economic analyses underscore the cost benefits of exercise 
programs, justifying broader integration into health care for older adults. 
However, despite these benefits, exercise is far from fully integrated into 
medical practice for older people. Many healthcare professionals, including 
geriatricians, need more training to incorporate exercise directly into patient 
care, whether in settings including hospitals, outpatient clinics, or 
residential care. Education about the use of exercise as isolated or adjunctive 
treatment for geriatric syndromes and chronic diseases would do much to ease the 
problems of polypharmacy and widespread prescription of potentially 
inappropriate medications. This intersection of prescriptive practices and 
PA/exercise offers a promising approach to enhance the well-being of older 
adults. An integrated strategy that combines exercise prescriptions with 
pharmacotherapy would optimize the vitality and functional independence of older 
people whilst minimizing adverse drug reactions. This consensus provides the 
rationale for the integration of PA into health promotion, disease prevention, 
and management strategies for older adults. Guidelines are included for specific 
modalities and dosages of exercise with proven efficacy in randomized controlled 
trials. Descriptions of the beneficial physiological changes, attenuation of 
aging phenotypes, and role of exercise in chronic disease and disability 
management in older adults are provided. The use of exercise in cardiometabolic 
disease, cancer, musculoskeletal conditions, frailty, sarcopenia, and 
neuropsychological health is emphasized. Recommendations to bridge existing 
knowledge and implementation gaps and fully integrate PA into the mainstream of 
geriatric care are provided. Particular attention is paid to the need for 
personalized medicine as it applies to exercise and geroscience, given the 
inter-individual variability in adaptation to exercise demonstrated in older 
adult cohorts. Overall, this consensus provides a foundation for applying and 
extending the current knowledge base of exercise as medicine for an aging 
population to optimize health span and quality of life.

Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer disease, frontotemporal 
dementia, Parkinson disease, Huntington disease, and amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis, are often casually linked to protein aggregation and inclusion. As 
the origins of those proteinopathies have been biochemically traced and 
genetically mapped, genetically engineered animal models carrying the specific 
mutations or variants are widely used for investigating the etiology of these 
diseases, as well as for testing potential therapeutics. This article focuses on 
the mouse models of Alzheimer disease and closely related frontotemporal 
dementia, particularly the ones that have provided most valuable knowledge, or 
are in a trajectory of doing so. More importantly, some of the major findings 
from these models are summarized, based on the recent single-cell 
transcriptomics, multiomics, and spatial transcriptomics studies. While no model 
is perfect, it is hoped that the new insights from these models and the 
practical use of these models will continue to help to establish a path forward.

This study aims to develop and evaluate a novel therapeutic strategy for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) by overcoming the blood-brain barrier (BBB) limitations 
of Neurotrophin-3 (NT-3). NT-3, a critical neurotrophic factor, plays essential 
roles in hippocampal neuron growth, survival, and synaptic plasticity, making it 
a promising candidate for AD treatment. However, its clinical application is 
hindered by its inability to cross the BBB. To address this, we utilized genetic 
engineering techniques to fuse the TAT transmembrane peptide with NT-3, 
producing a recombinant NT-3 (T-NT-3) with enhanced membrane-penetrating 
capability. Protein characterization confirmed that T-NT-3 possesses good 
stability and the ability to cross the BBB. In vitro experiments demonstrated 
that T-NT-3 inhibits oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammatory responses in 
neural cells by activating TrkC receptors and suppressing M1 microglial 
activation. In vivo, T-NT-3 improved cognitive and memory impairments in APP/PS1 
mice and reduced AD-associated pathological changes. These findings highlight 
the mechanisms by which T-NT-3 alleviates hippocampal neurotoxicity, providing a 
foundation for its future application as a recombinant protein therapy for AD.

β-Amyloid (Aβ) protein deposition, oxidative stress, and metal ion imbalance are 
established pathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD), highlighting the 
imperative to efficiently reduce Aβ aggregates formation, alleviate oxidative 
stress, and chelate metal ions. Existing research indicates the necessity of 
developing multifunctional nanomaterials to facilitate multi-target therapy. In 
this work, we designed and prepared multifunctional selenium-doped carbonized 
polymer dots (SeCDs), and examined the multifunctionality at inhibiting Aβ, 
cleaning reactive oxygen species (ROS), and modulating copper ions. SeCDs 
exhibit efficient clearance of active hydroxyl radicals and superoxide anion 
radicals. In addition, SeCDs can chelate Cu ions, therefore reducing the 
cytotoxicity linked to the Aβ-Cu complex. More importantly, SeCDs can 
effectively reduce the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species. This 
study demonstrates the potential of carbon dots as a multifunctional β-sheet 
disruptor, while multifunctional SeCDs offer promising avenues for further 
research in the multi-target treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Meanwhile, this 
strategy provides a new perspective on the development of zero-dimensional 
carbon materials in Alzheimer's therapy.

Co-morbid Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology (amyloid-beta and tau) is commonly 
observed in Lewy body dementia (LBD), and this may affect clinical outcomes. A 
systematic review of the effect of AD co-pathology on longitudinal clinical 
outcomes in LBD was conducted. A search of MEDLINE and EMBASE (October 2024) 
yielded n = 3558 records that were screened by two independent reviewers. 
Included studies (n = 31) assessed AD co-pathology in LBD by neuropathologic 
examination (n = 10), positron emission tomography (PET) imaging (n = 7), 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (n = 8) or plasma biomarkers (n = 6); and reported 
longitudinal clinical outcomes including cognitive and functional decline, 
mortality, or treatment response. Most neuropathology, PET and plasma studies 
reviewed demonstrated poorer prognosis in LBD + compared to LBD-, but discrepant 
findings were seen among CSF studies. No included study reported better outcomes 
in LBD+. The risk of bias was assessed with the Quality in Prognosis Studies 
tool. All studies rated as low risk of bias (n = 12) reported that the presence 
of AD co-pathology in LBD (LBD+) was associated with accelerated cognitive 
decline (n = 7/7), accelerated functional decline (n = 3/3), greater mortality 
(n = 2/2) and poorer response to treatment (n = 1/1). Among these studies, LBD+ 
was associated with an additional decline of -0.53 to -2.9 MMSE points/year 
compared to LBD-, while one study reported an adjusted hazard ratio for 
mortality in LBD + as 3.70. We conclude that AD co-pathology is associated with 
worse clinical outcomes in LBD whether assessed by greater cognitive decline, 
increased mortality or greater decline on functional assessment scales.

INTRODUCTION: Over the past few decades, there has been a sudden rise in the 
incidence of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) in Western countries. However, current 
treatments often show limited efficacy in certain patients and are associated 
with adverse effects, which highlights the need for safer and more effective 
therapeutic approaches. Environmental factors, particularly dietary habits, have 
been observed to play a substantial role in the development of MS. In this 
study, we are the first to investigate the potential protective effect of the 
phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) in MS. ABA, which is abundant in fruits such as 
figs, apricots and bilberries, is known to cross the blood-brain barrier and has 
demonstrated neuroprotective effects in conditions like depression and 
Alzheimer's disease.
METHODS: In this study, we investigated whether ABA supplementation enhances 
remyelination in both ex vivo and in vivo mouse models.
RESULTS: Our results indicated that ABA enhanced remyelination and that this 
enhanced remyelination is associated with increased lipid droplet load, reduced 
levels of degraded myelin, and a higher abundance of F4/80+ cells in the 
demyelinated brain of mice treated with ABA. In in vitro models, we further 
demonstrated that ABA treatment elevates lipid droplet formation by enhancing 
the phagocytic capacity of macrophages. Additionally, in a mouse model of 
microglial activation, we showed that ABA-treated mice maintain a less 
inflammatory microglial phenotype.
CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight a crucial role for macrophages and microglia 
in enabling ABA to enhance the remyelination process. Furthermore, ABA's ability 
to improve remyelination together with its ability to reduce microglial 
activation, make ABA a promising candidate for modulating macrophage phenotype 
and reducing neuroinflammation in MS.

Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) are 
indispensable core techniques in cardiac surgery. Numerous studies have shown 
that cardiopulmonary bypass and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest are 
associated with the occurrence of neuroinflammation, accompanied by the 
activation of microglia. Microglia, as macrophages in the central nervous 
system, play an irreplaceable role in neuroinflammation. Current research on 
neuroinflammation induced by microglia activation mainly focuses on 
neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, 
neuropathic pain, acquired brain injury, and others. However, there is 
relatively limited research on microglia and neuroinflammation under conditions 
of cardiopulmonary bypass and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. The close 
relationship between cardiopulmonary bypass, deep hypothermic circulatory 
arrest, and cardiac surgery underscores the importance of identifying targets 
for intervening in neuroinflammation through microglia. This could greatly 
benefit cardiac surgery patients during cardiopulmonary bypass and the 
perioperative period, significantly improving patient prognosis. This review 
article provides the first comprehensive discussion on the signaling pathways 
associated with neuroinflammation triggered by microglia activation, the impact 
of cardiopulmonary bypass on microglia, as well as the current status and 
advancements in cardiopulmonary bypass animal models. It provides new insights 
and methods for the treatment of neuroinflammation related to cardiopulmonary 
bypass and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, holding significant importance 
for clinical treatment by cardiac surgeons, management strategies by 
cardiopulmonary bypass physicians, and the development of neurologically related 
medications.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the predictive performance of published 
amisulpride population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) models in schizophrenia patients 
with an external data set and establish remedial dosing regimens for nonadherent 
amisulpride-treated patients.
METHODS: A systematic search was conducted on PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science 
to identify PopPK models for evaluation. The evaluation process involved 
analyzing 390 serum concentration samples obtained from 361 Chinese adult 
inpatients diagnosed with schizophrenia. Model predictability was evaluated by 
prediction-based and simulation-based diagnostics. Based on validation results, 
a modified PopPK model was constructed to characterize amisulpride 
pharmacokinetic in our patients. Monte Carlo simulation was employed to 
investigate non-adherence scenarios and the impact of subsequently administered 
remedial regimens.
RESULTS: In the five assessed published models, four included trough 
concentrations from schizophrenia patients, and one combined single-dose data 
from healthy older adults and trough concentrations from older adults with 
Alzheimer's disease. The PE for population and individual predictions ranged 
from -92.89% to 27.02% and -24.82% to 4.04%, respectively. In the 
simulation-based diagnostics, the NPDE results indicated noticeable bias in all 
models. Therefore, a modified one-compartment model, with estimated creatinine 
clearance(eCLcr) as covariates on the apparent clearance (CL/F) of amisulpride, 
was developed. For delays in medication dosing, if the delay is within 12 hours, 
take half the missed dose right away, then resume the normal schedule; if the 
delay is up to 24 hours, just continue with the regular dosing schedule.
CONCLUSION: Existing published models lack the necessary reliability for 
cross-center application. Future prospective studies are required to assess our 
model before integrating it into clinical practice. Model-based simulations 
provided a rational approach to propose remedial strategies for delayed or 
missed doses.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder marked by cognitive 
decline, primarily affecting memory and executive function. This review 
highlights recent advancements in single-cell sequencing and spatial 
transcriptomics, which provide detailed insights into the cellular heterogeneity 
and neuroimmune mechanisms of AD. The review addresses the need for 
understanding complex cellular interactions to identify novel therapeutic 
targets and biomarkers. Single-cell sequencing has revolutionized our 
understanding by mapping gene expression at the individual cell level, revealing 
distinct microglial and astrocytic states that contribute to neuroinflammation 
and neurodegeneration. These technologies have uncovered disease-associated 
microglial subpopulations and gene expression changes linked to AD risk genes, 
essential for developing targeted therapies. In conclusion, the integration of 
single-cell and spatial transcriptomics with other omics data is crucial for a 
comprehensive understanding of AD, paving the way for personalized medicine. 
Continued interdisciplinary collaboration will be vital in translating these 
findings into effective treatments, improving patient outcomes.

In recent years, mitochondrial transfer has emerged as a universal phenomenon 
intertwined with various systemic physiological and pathological processes. 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial disease, with mitochondrial 
dysfunction at its core. Although numerous studies have found evidence of 
mitochondrial transfer in AD models, the precise mechanisms remain unclear. 
Recent studies have revealed the dynamic transfer of mitochondria in Alzheimer's 
disease, not only between nerve cells and glial cells, but also between nerve 
cells and glial cells. In this review, we explore the pathways and mechanisms of 
mitochondrial transfer in Alzheimer's disease and how these transfer activities 
contribute to disease progression.

BACKGROUND: Palliative sedation involves the intentional proportional lowering 
of the level of consciousness in patients with life-limiting disease who are 
experiencing refractory suffering. The efficacy of palliative sedation needs to 
be monitored to ensure patient comfort. The aim of this study was to evaluate 
the efficacy using discomfort levels combined with sedation/agitation levels.
METHODS: In this prospective observational study, adult patients with advanced 
malignancies were recruited from hospice units, palliative care units, and 
hospital wards in five European countries. Health care professionals used proxy 
observations of discomfort levels (Discomfort Scale-Dementia of Alzheimer Type, 
range 0-27) and sedation/agitation levels (Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale 
modified for palliative care inpatients), range - 5 to + 4) to evaluate the 
efficacy of palliative sedation.
RESULTS: In 78 participants, discomfort levels were monitored during palliative 
sedation. The mean discomfort score before start was 9.4 points (95% CI 
8.3-10.5), which showed a significant decrease of 6.0 points (95% CI 4.8-7.1) 
after start of sedation for the total sedation period. In the multivariable 
analysis, no significant factors influencing baseline discomfort levels were 
identified. The discomfort and depth of sedation scores were found to be 
positively correlated, with an r of 0.72 (95% CI 0.61-0.82). The internal 
consistency of the discomfort scale was good (0.83), but the "Noisy breathing" 
item was less informative of the total discomfort score.
CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of palliative sedation can be evaluated by measuring 
discomfort levels combined with sedation/agitation levels. The measurement of 
discomfort levels might provide a more specific and detailed evaluation of 
adequate sedation.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Alzheimer's disease is a complex, incurable to date, 
multifactorial disease, which suggests the need for continued development of 
pharmacotherapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted to 
identify known ligands with anticholinesterase activity, resulting in the 
discovery of over 100 alkaloids that are also available in the PubChem database. 
Subsequently, the ligands underwent molecular docking to evaluate their affinity 
for the target enzyme. The ligands with the greatest affinity were selected for 
ligand-based virtual screening.
RESULTS: Three potential compounds were identified for further investigation: 
ZINC000055042508, ZINC000096316348, and ZINC000067 446933. Computational models 
of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties 
prediction using SwissADME suggested that ZINC000055042508 and ZINC000067446933 
can permeate the blood-brain barrier and exhibit non-substrate behavior with 
respect to P-glycoprotein. In contrast, the ProTox-III prediction indicated the 
potential for all three compounds to penetrate the blood-brain barrier.
CONCLUSION: These alkaloid derivatives warrant further investigation as 
potential acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of Alzheimer's 
disease.

OBJECTIVES: Little information exists on whether nationwide efforts to reduce 
antipsychotic use among nursing home (NH) residents with Alzheimer's disease and 
related dementias improved mortality and hospitalization outcomes for residents. 
Our objective was to examine the effect of NH decreases in antipsychotic use on 
outcomes for residents with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.
DESIGN: Observational nationwide study that emulated a series of cluster 
randomized trials.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Long-stay NH residents with Alzheimer's disease and 
related dementias in US NHs.
METHODS: The study used data from Medicare claims to emulate cluster randomized 
trials in which NHs were assigned to either decrease or maintain/increase 
antipsychotic use. Outcome ascertainment for the first trial began on April 1, 
2012 (ie, following the announcement of the National Partnership to Improve 
Dementia Care in NHs). The last day of follow-up was December 31, 2017. Outcomes 
measured included 12-month all-cause mortality, all-cause hospitalization, and 
hospitalization for stroke, myocardial infarction, fracture, and psychiatric 
conditions. Use of other psychotropic medications was also evaluated. 
Inverse-probability-of-treatment-weighted pooled Poisson regression models 
estimated covariate-adjusted risk ratios (RRs).
RESULTS: The adjusted risks of death (RR, 1.01; 95% CLs, 1.00, 1.01), all-cause 
hospitalization (RR, 1.00; 95% CLs, 1.00, 1.01), and hospitalization for 
specific causes were similar between resident-trials in NHs that decreased vs 
maintained/increased antipsychotic use. Use of antidepressants, 
anxiolytic/sedative-hypnotics, anticonvulsant/mood stabilizers, and antidementia 
medications was slightly higher among resident-trials in NHs that decreased 
antipsychotic use.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Decreases in NH antipsychotic use do not appear to 
improve resident outcomes. Intensive initiatives focused predominantly on 
achieving a decrease in antipsychotic use may not be effective at improving 
mortality and hospitalization outcomes for residents with Alzheimer's disease 
and related dementias. These findings suggest the need for better strategies 
that incorporate safe and effective nonpharmacological or pharmacological 
alternatives for managing neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia.

OBJECTIVE: To examine racial and ethnic differences in telemedicine mental 
health (tele-MH) use among nursing home (NH) long-stay residents with 
Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) during the pandemic.
DESIGN: Observational study.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The 2020-2021 Minimum Data Set 3.0, Medicare datasets, 
and Nursing Home Compare data were linked. A total of 259,467 NH long-stay 
residents with ADRD and 14,159 NHs were included.
METHODS: The outcome variable was the percentage of NH ADRD long-stayers who 
used tele-MH in 2021. The main independent variables were NH racial and ethnic 
compositions (ie, percentages of Black and Hispanic residents) and individual 
race and ethnicity. We conducted a set of logistic regression models with NH 
random effect. We first included only individual characteristics and then added 
NH characteristics.
RESULTS: Approximately 7% and 35% of the study cohort had tele-MH use and MH use 
in 2021, respectively. In our study cohort, 13.7% were Black, 6.6% were 
Hispanic, and 79.7% were white residents. The mean age was 83.4. After adjusting 
for NH characteristics, we found residents in NHs with a high proportion of 
Hispanic residents were more likely to use tele-MH both compared with those in 
NHs with a low proportion [odds ratio (OR), 1.867; 95% CI, 1.566-2.226], whereas 
residents in NHs with a high proportion of Black residents were less likely to 
use tele-MH both compared with those in NHs with a low proportion (OR, 0.843; 
95% CI, 0.928-0.997).
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Telemedicine may offer an opportunity for NHs with 
a higher proportion of Hispanic residents to better address their needs for MH 
services. However, NHs with a higher proportion of Black residents may face 
challenges in telemedicine adoption. Future studies are needed to better 
understand factors that could impact tele-MH use in NHs and reasons that lead to 
racial and ethnic differences.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), a diverse neurodegenerative disease, is the leading 
cause of dementia, accounting for 60-80 % of all cases. The pathophysiology of 
Alzheimer's disease is unknown, and there is no cure at this time. Recent 
developments in transcriptome-wide profiling have led to the identification of a 
number of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Among these, long non-coding RNAs 
(lncRNAs)-long transcripts that don't seem to be able to code for proteins-have 
drawn attention because they function as regulatory agents in a variety of 
biological processes. Recent research suggests that lncRNAs play a role in the 
pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease by modulating tau hyperphosphorylation, 
amyloid production, synaptic impairment, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial 
dysfunction, and oxidative stress, though their precise effects on the disorder 
are unknown. The biology and modes of action of the best-characterized lncRNAs 
in AD will be outlined here, with an emphasis on their possible involvement in 
the pathophysiology of the disease. As lncRNAs may offer prospective 
prognostic/diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for the treatment of 
AD, a greater comprehension of the molecular processes and the intricate network 
of interactions in which they are implicated could pave the way for future 
research.

The formation of the pyroglutamate variant of amyloid beta (pGlu-Aβ), which is 
extremely hydrophobic, rapidly aggregating, and highly neurotoxic, is mediated 
by the action of secretory glutaminyl cyclase (sQC). The pGlu-Aβ often acts as a 
seed for the aggregation of the full length Aβ and contributes to the overall 
load of Aβ plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, inhibiting sQC is a 
potential approach to limit the formation of pGlu-Aβ and to modify the 
progression of AD. This study presents two novel molecules containing 
benzimidazole-6-carboxamide, namely LSB-09 and LSB-24, as promising sQC 
inhibitors. These inhibitors demonstrated moderate toxicity in human 
neuroblastoma cell lines and possessed IC50 values in the micromolar range (40 
and 4 μM for LSB-09 and LSB-24, respectively). Additionally, the X-ray crystal 
structure of the sQC-LSB-09 complex revealed a unique binding mode, and a 
systematic computational investigation elucidated the binding mode for LSB-24. 
The binding mode of these two benzimidazole-6-carboxamide inhibitors offers a 
potential platform for designing attractive lead candidates against sQC.

Structural brain changes underlie cognitive changes and interindividual 
variability in cognition in older age. By using structural MRI data-driven 
clustering, we aimed to identify subgroups of cognitively unimpaired older 
adults based on brain change patterns and assess how changes in cortical 
thickness, surface area, and subcortical volume relate to cognitive change. We 
tested (1) which brain structural changes predict cognitive change (2) whether 
these are associated with core cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Alzheimer's disease 
biomarkers, and (3) the degree of overlap between clusters derived from 
different structural modalities in 1899 cognitively healthy older adults 
followed up to 16 years. We identified four groups for each brain feature, based 
on the degree of a main longitudinal component of decline. The minimal overlap 
between features suggested that each contributed uniquely and independently to 
structural brain changes in aging. Cognitive change and baseline cognition were 
associated with cortical area change, whereas higher baseline levels of 
phosphorylated tau and amyloid-β related to changes in subcortical volume. These 
results may contribute to a better understanding of different aging 
trajectories.

OBJECTIVES: To compare the total medical costs associated with operative versus 
non-operative medical procedures for femoral neck fractures in older adults with 
Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study examined 4,157 Optum beneficiaries 
diagnosed with AD who filed an initial claim for femoral neck fracture between 
January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2017. Generalized linear regression with Gamma 
log link function was performed to evaluate total medical costs between surgical 
treatment and non-operative care while controlling for covariates.
RESULTS: The adjusted total medical costs per patient for arthroplasty and 
internal fixation were $207,392 and $170,210, exceeding the total medical costs 
for non-operative cases ($63,041). Comorbidities such as history of falls, 
sarcopenia/muscle weakness, abnormal weight loss, depression, and fatigue also 
had a significant impact on the overall medical costs.
CONCLUSIONS: Surgical intervention for femoral neck fractures incurs higher 
costs but offers better clinical outcomes than non-operative care.

INTRODUCTION: The triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) 
arginine-47-histidine (R47H) mutation is a significant risk for Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) with unclear mechanisms. Previous studies focused on microglial 
amyloid-β (Aβ) phagocytosis with less attention on the impact of TREM2R47H 
mutation on blood monocytes.
METHODS: Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) models were used to assess the 
contribution of blood monocytes carrying TREM2R47H mutation to AD.
RESULTS: Aβ phagocytosis was compromised in mouse monocytes carrying the 
TREM2R47H mutation. Transplantation of bone marrow cells (BMCs) carrying 
TREM2R47H mutation increased cerebral Aβ burden and aggravated AD-type 
pathologies. Moreover, the replacement of TREM2R47H-BMCs restored monocytic Aβ 
phagocytosis, lowered Aβ levels in the blood and brain, and improved cognitive 
function.
DISCUSSION: Our study reveals that blood monocytes carrying the TREM2R47H 
mutation substantially contribute to the pathogenesis of AD, and correcting the 
TREM2R47H mutation in BMCs would be a potential therapeutic approach for those 
carrying this mutation.
HIGHLIGHTS: TREM2R47H mutation compromises the Aβ phagocytosis of blood 
monocytes. Blood monocytes carrying TREM2R47H mutation contribute substantially 
to AD pathogenesis. Correction of the TREM2R47H mutation in bone marrow cells 
ameliorates AD pathologies and cognitive impairments.

Blood-based biomarkers (BBBMs) for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have the potential 
to revolutionize the detection and management of cognitive impairment. AD BBBMs 
are not currently recommended for use in primary care but may soon be as 
research demonstrates their clinical utility for differential diagnosis and 
patient management. To prepare for the incorporation of AD BBBMs into primary 
care, several practical challenges must be addressed. Here, we describe four 
immediate challenges: (1) preparing primary care providers to order and disclose 
AD BBBMs, (2) expanding the dementia-capable workforce, (3) ensuring equitable 
uptake of AD BBBM testing, and (4) securing access to AD treatment. We conclude 
by discussing future directions and challenges for use of AD BBBMs in primary 
care, including screening for preclinical AD and dementia detection algorithms. 
HIGHLIGHTS: Alzheimer's disease (AD) blood-based biomarkers (BBBMs) may be well 
suited for primary care. Many changes are needed to prepare the workforce and 
ensure patient access. Paving the way for AD BBBMs in primary care will require 
a multi-pronged approach.

With advances in biomarker-based detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and new 
treatment options with disease-modifying treatments (DMTs), we are heading 
toward a new conceptualization of diagnostics and therapy in the early stages of 
AD. Yet consensus guidelines on best clinical practices in predictive AD 
diagnostics are still developing. Currently, there is a knowledge gap regarding 
counseling and disclosure practices in early symptomatic disease stages, its 
implications for dementia risk estimation, and DMTs with associated risks and 
benefits. The crucial feature is the capacity of patients with (mild) cognitive 
impairment, eligible for DMTs, to consent. This perspective aims to (1) discuss 
the current challenges in assessing capacity to consent and (2) highlight the 
importance of a supported (informed) decision-making process. Measures to 
facilitate informed decision-making of patients constitute an ethical approach 
to enhancing the quality of care in this evolving therapeutic landscape. 
HIGHLIGHTS: This perspective: Explores biomarker-based early symptomatic AD 
detection and the implications for patient care. Emphasizes supported 
decision-making in DMTs for MCI and dementia patients. Discusses the need for 
standardized tools to assess the capacity to consent. Aligns diagnostic and 
treatment approaches with ethical care standards. Enhances patient autonomy in 
the evolving AD therapeutic landscape.

With the advent of treatments that specifically target Alzheimer's disease brain 
pathology, biomarker tests will become an increasingly important part of the 
routine clinical evaluation of cognitive impairment and guide clinical decision 
making. Clinicians must ensure they are using accurate and well-validated 
biomarker tests and select the most appropriate testing modality for each 
patient based on individual and practical considerations. The interpretation of 
test results may be complex and depends on the pre-test probability and 
test-specific factors. Biomarker results must be presented and discussed with 
patients in a process that is sensitive to the major implications of the results 
and is carefully connected to diagnosis, prognosis, and management. Advances in 
treatments for Alzheimer's disease will likely require non-dementia specialists 
to use biomarkers, necessitating major educational efforts. In the new era of 
Alzheimer's disease treatments, biomarkers are essential tools that will be 
integrated into all aspects of dementia diagnosis and care.

The Potential for Extracellular Vesicles in Nanomedicine: A Review of Recent 
Advancements and Challenges Ahead.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as promising tools in diagnostics and 
therapy for chronic diseases, including cancer and Alzheimer's. Small EVs, also 
called exosomes, are lipid-bound particles (≈30-150 nm) that play a role in 
healthy and pathophysiological interactions, including intercellular 
communication, by transporting bioactive molecules, including proteins, lipids, 
and nucleic acids. Their ability to cross biological barriers, such as the 
blood-brain barrier, makes them ideal candidates for targeted therapeutic 
interventions. In the context of chronic diseases, exosomes can be engineered to 
deliver active agents, including small molecules and siRNAs to specific target 
cells, providing a novel approach to precision medicine. Moreover, exosomes show 
great promise as repositories for diagnostic biomarkers. Their cargo can reflect 
the physiological and pathological status of the parent cells, making them 
valuable indicators of disease progression and response to treatment. This paper 
presents a comprehensive review of the application of exosomes in four chronic 
diseases: cancer, cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disease, and 
orthopedic disease, which significantly impact global public health due to their 
high prevalence and associated morbidity and mortality rates. Furthermore, the 
potential of exosomes as valuable tools for theranostics and disease management 
is highlighted. Finally, the challenges associated with exosomes and their 
demonstrated potential for advancing future nanomedicine applications are 
discussed.

The present study investigated differences in the quantity and quality of social 
engagement, and their associations with neurocognition among older Latino and 
non-Latino White persons with HIV (PWH). Participants were age 
50 + community-dwelling PWH living in southern California (n = 116; 50% Latino 
[53% Spanish-speaking], 50% non-Latino White; Age: M = 58.03; Education: 
M = 13.29; 82% male; 58% AIDS; 95% on antiretroviral therapy). Neurocognition 
was assessed with a battery of 10 tests on which demographically-adjusted 
T-scores were derived. Social engagement was measured via self-report of 
frequency of participation in social activities over the past year 
(quantitative) and feelings and perceptions of loneliness (qualitative). There 
were few ethnic differences in degree of participation in social activities, but 
Latino PWH reported lower loneliness. Social activity and loneliness were 
significantly associated with processing speed in the overall sample, and with 
global neurocognition only in White PWH. Latino PWH reported better quality of 
social engagement than non-Latino White PWH despite small ethnic differences in 
quantity of social engagement. Social engagement was associated with better 
neurocognition primarily in older White PWH. Given documented HIV disparities in 
neurocognition, future studies should investigate HIV-related comorbidities and 
structural determinants of health as potential determinants of neurocognition 
among older Latino PWH.

Publisher: El presente estudio investigó las diferencias en la cantidad y 
calidad del involucramiento social y sus asociaciones con la neurocognición en 
personas mayores latinas y blancas no latinas con VIH. Los participantes fueron 
personas con VIH mayores de 50 años que vivían en la comunidad en el sur de 
California (n = 116; 50% latinos [53% de habla hispana], 50% blancos no latinos; 
Edad: M = 58.03; Educación: M = 13.29; 82% hombres; 58% SIDA; 95% en terapia 
antirretroviral). La neurocognición se evaluó con una batería de 10 pruebas de 
las cuales se derivaron puntuaciones T ajustadas demográficamente. El 
involucramiento social se midió por autoinforme e incluyó la frecuencia de 
participación en actividades sociales durante el último año (cuantitativo) y los 
sentimientos y percepciones de soledad (cualitativo). Hubo pocas diferencias 
étnicas en el grado de participación en actividades sociales, pero las personas 
latinas con VIH reportaron menor soledad. La actividad social y la soledad se 
asociaron significativamente con la velocidad de procesamiento en la muestra 
general, y con la neurocognición global sólo en las personas con VIH blancas no 
latinas. Las personas con VIH latinas reportaron una mejor calidad de 
involucramiento social que los blancos no latinos a pesar de que hubo pequeñas 
diferencias étnicas en la cantidad de involucramiento social. El involucramiento 
social se asoció con una mejor neurocognición principalmente en las personas con 
VIH blancas no latinas. Dado la existencia de disparidades neurocognitivas en 
personas con VIH, los estudios futuros podrían investigar las comorbilidades 
relacionadas con el VIH y los determinantes estructurales de la salud como 
posibles determinantes de la neurocognición entre las personas latinas mayores 
con VIH.

Gut brain axis can affect the incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Probiotics 
restore the homeostasis of gut dysbiosis and prevent AD. Here, we evaluated the 
impact of Saccharomyces boulardii on rats with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced 
amyloidogenesis. Rats were classified into four groups: (1) Control (saline), 
(2) LPS 250 µg/kg (saline + LPS), (3) S. boulardii (1010 CFU/mL/rat), and (4) S. 
boulardii (1010 CFU/mL/rat) + LPS (250 μg/kg). The passive behavioral test, 
Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry were done using the animal 
hippocampi. Step-through latency (STL) indicated that the LPS-treated group had 
decreased memory retrieval compared to the control group. The LPS group had 
increased hippocampal levels of amyloid-β peptide, amyloid-β precursor protein 
(APP), and β-secretase (BACE). Administration of the S. boulardii before LPS 
prolonged STL which has been shortened in the LPS group (P < 0.05). In the 
LPS + S group, S. boulardii reduced the levels of APP significantly compared to 
the LPS group (P < 0.01). S. boulardii mitigated Aβ buildup and memory 
dysfunction caused by LPS through modulating the APP, BACE1, and Aβ pathways. 
Future studies are required to explain the neuroprotective effects of S. 
boulardii, since it could be a novel therapy or prevention strategy for AD.

OBJECTIVES: Distinguishing dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) from Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) dementia, particularly in patients with DLB and concomitant AD 
pathology (DLB/AD+), can be challenging and there is no specific MRI signature 
for DLB. The aim of this study is to examine the additional value of MRI-based 
brain volumetry in separating patients with DLB (AD+/-) from patients with AD 
and controls.
METHODS: We included 1518 participants from four cohorts (ADC, ADNI, PDBP and 
PredictND); 147 were patients with DLB (n = 76, DLB/AD+; n = 71, DLB/AD-), 668 
patients with AD dementia, and 703 controls. We used an automatic segmentation 
tool to compute volumes of 70 brain regions, for which age, sex, and head 
size-dependent z-scores were calculated. We compared individual regions between 
the diagnostic groups and evaluated whether combining multiple regions improves 
differentiation. To assess the diagnostic performance, we used the area under 
the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and sensitivity.
RESULTS: The classifier using the combination of 70 volumetric brain regions 
correctly classified 60% of patients with DLB and 70% of patients with AD 
dementia. For DLB vs. AD, the classifier produced an AUC of 0.80 (0.77-0.83), 
which outperformed the best individual region, hippocampus (AUC: 0.73 
[0.69-0.76], p < 0.01). For the comparison of DLB/AD+ vs. AD, the classifier 
increased the AUC to 0.74 (0.68-0.80), which was 0.70 (0.64-0.76) for the 
hippocampus, p = 0.25.
CONCLUSION: Using a combination of volumetric brain regions improved the 
classification accuracy, and thus the discrimination, of patients with DLB with 
and without concomitant AD pathology and AD.
KEY POINTS: Question No specific MRI signature for dementia with Lewy bodies 
(DLB) exists, making the differential diagnosis challenging, especially with 
dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Findings Volumes of individual brain 
regions defined by automatic MRI segmentation differed between DLB and AD 
patients and controls. Clinical relevance Automatic MRI segmentation can 
contribute to improving the discrimination of patients with DLB and AD, 
especially in non-specialized memory clinics.

Neurodegeneration in Huntington's disease (HD) is accompanied by the aggregation 
of fragments of the mutant huntingtin protein, a biomarker of disease 
progression. A particular pathogenic role has been attributed to the 
aggregation-prone huntingtin exon 1 (HTTex1), generated by aberrant splicing or 
proteolysis, and containing the expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) segment. Unlike 
amyloid fibrils from Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, the atomic-level 
structure of HTTex1 fibrils has remained unknown, limiting diagnostic and 
treatment efforts. We present and analyze the structure of fibrils formed by 
polyQ peptides and polyQ-expanded HTTex1 in vitro. Atomic-resolution 
perspectives are enabled by an integrative analysis and unrestrained all-atom 
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations incorporating experimental data from 
electron microscopy (EM), solid-state NMR, and other techniques. Alongside the 
use of prior data, we report magic angle spinning NMR studies of glutamine 
residues of the polyQ fibril core and surface, distinguished via 
hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX). Our study provides a molecular understanding 
of the structure of the core as well as surface of aggregated HTTex1, including 
the fuzzy coat and polyQ-water interface. The obtained data are discussed in 
context of their implications for understanding the detection of such aggregates 
(diagnostics) as well as known biological properties of the fibrils.

Warfarin Versus Non-Vitamin K Inhibitors Medications and Cognitive Disease 
Progression in Atrial Fibrillation.

Wood KA, Ko YA, Han F, Thunell J, Zissimopoulos J, Wharton W.

BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with cognitive decline. Use 
of oral anticoagulant (OAC) medications offers a lower risk of dementia, but it 
is unclear whether differences exist between types of OAC agents.
OBJECTIVE: This was a secondary analysis to explore whether the progression from 
normal cognition to mild cognitive impairment to dementia differs between adults 
with AF on warfarin versus non-vitamin K inhibitor medications (NOACs) using 
data extracted from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center clinical case 
series.
METHODS: Subjects with AF on OACs, having normal cognition and no stroke at 
baseline, and at least 1 follow-up visit were included. OAC usage was calculated 
based on follow-up time and reported previous OAC use. Continuation ratio models 
(with subject-specific random intercepts) were used to examine the association 
between OAC type and cognitive diagnosis controlling for cognitive diagnosis 
from previous visit.
RESULTS: Among 1475 eligible participants, 478 reported taking warfarin (n = 
396) or NOACs (n = 82) at baseline (mean age of 79 years, 51% females, 84% 
non-Hispanic White). The median follow-up time was 4 years (interquartile range, 
2-7). About 63% continued using either warfarin or NOACs, 44% switched from 
warfarin to NOACs, and 2% switched from NOACs to warfarin. After adjusting for 
age, sex, education, race, and cardiovascular clinical comorbidities, no 
significant association was found between OAC type and cognitive decline ( P = 
.14).
CONCLUSIONS: We found similar risks of cognitive decline between those on NOACs 
or warfarin. Future studies should consider effects of age, length of time from 
AF diagnosis, and OAC adherence on this risk.

There is a pressing need for accessible biomarkers with high diagnostic accuracy 
for Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis to facilitate widespread screening, 
particularly in underserved groups. Saliva is an emerging specimen for measuring 
AD biomarkers, with distinct contexts of use that could complement blood and 
cerebrospinal fluid and detect various analytes. An interdisciplinary, 
international group of AD and related dementias (ADRD) researchers convened and 
performed a narrative review of published studies on salivary AD biomarkers. We 
critically appraised the current state of the literature, examining both 
consistencies and discrepancies in existing pre-analytical variables and 
methodologies. We discussed how various pre-analytical variables could influence 
the detection and quantification of salivary biomarkers, showed technologies 
available to standardize collection procedures, and proposed a standardized 
pre-analytical protocol to guide future studies on salivary AD biomarker 
examinations. We identified potential contexts of use, gaps, and priorities and 
proposed future research directions. HIGHLIGHTS: Given its non-invasive nature, 
wider accessibility, and cultural acceptability, particularly in low-resourced 
settings, saliva is a biofluid complementary to blood and CSF. Current salivary 
AD biomarker studies do not control for many confounding pre-analytical 
variables during the sampling process, potentially leading to inaccurate 
salivary biomarker readings and conclusions, contributing to conflicting 
findings. Reviewing the current literature, including the consistencies and 
non-consistencies observed in the existing parameters and methodologies, 
discussing how they can affect salivary AD biomarker detection and 
quantification. Proposing a standardized salivary pre-analytical protocol, 
identifying the gaps and prioritizations needed to move this area forward, 
proposing future directions and potential contexts of use.

amyloid pathology in an Alzheimer disease mouse model.

OBJECTIVE: The 5xFAD mouse model of Alzheimer disease (AD) recapitulates 
amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition and pronounced seizure susceptibility observed in 
patients with AD. Forty-hertz audiovisual stimulation is a noninvasive technique 
that entrains gamma neural oscillations and can reduce Aβ pathology and modulate 
glial expression in AD models. We hypothesized that 40-Hz sensory stimulation 
would improve seizure susceptibility in 5xFAD mice and this would be associated 
with reduction of plaques and modulation of glial phenotypes.
METHODS: 5xFAD mice and wild-type (WT) littermates received 1 h/day 40-Hz 
audiovisual stimulation or sham (n = 7-11/group), beginning 2 weeks before and 
continuing throughout amygdala kindling epileptogenesis. Postmortem analyses 
included Aβ pathology and morphology of astrocytes and microglia.
RESULTS: 5xFAD mice exhibited enhanced susceptibility to seizures compared to 
WT, evidenced by fewer stimulations to reach kindling endpoint (incidence rate 
ratio [IRR] = 1.46, p < .0001) and a trend to higher seizure severity (odds 
ratio [OR] = .34, p = .059). Forty-hertz stimulation reduced the behavioral 
severity of the first seizure (OR = 4.04, p = .02) and delayed epileptogenesis, 
increasing the number of stimulations required to reach kindling endpoint 
(IRR = .82, p = .01) compared to sham, regardless of genotype. 5xFAD mice 
receiving sensory stimulation exhibited ~50% reduction in amyloid pathology 
compared to sham. Furthermore, markers of astrocytes and microglia were 
upregulated in both genotypes receiving 40-Hz stimulation.
SIGNIFICANCE: Forty-hertz sensory entrainment slows epileptogenesis in the mouse 
amygdala kindling model. Although this intervention improves Aβ pathology in 
5xFAD mice, the observed antiepileptogenic effect may also relate to effects on 
glia, because mice without Aβ plaques (i.e., WT) also experienced 
antiepileptogenic effects of the intervention.

INTRODUCTION: White matter hyperintensity volumes (WMHVs) are disproportionally 
prevalent in individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD), potentially reflecting 
neurovascular injury. We quantify the association between AD polygenic risk 
score (AD-PRS) and WMHV, exploring single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that 
are proximal to genes overexpressed in cerebrovascular cell species.
METHODS: In a UK-Biobank sub-sample (mean age = 64, range = 45-81 years), we 
associate WMHV with (1) AD-PRS estimated via SNPs across the genome (minus 
apolipoprotein E [APOE] locus) and (2) AD-PRS estimated with SNPs proximal to 
specific genes that are overexpressed in cerebrovascular cell species.
RESULTS: We observed a positive association between non-APOE-AD-PRS and WMHVs. 
We further demonstrate an association between WMHVs and AD-PRS constructed with 
SNPs that are proximal to genes over-represented in smooth muscles cells (SMCs; 
β = 0.135, PFWE  < 0.01) and internally replicated 
(PDISCOVERY+REPLICATION < 0.01).
DISCUSSION: Common AD genetic risk could explain physiological processes 
underlying vascular pathology in AD. SMC function may offer a treatment target 
to prevent WMHV-related AD pathophysiology prior to the onset of symptoms.
HIGHLIGHTS: Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk factors such as apolipoprotein E 
(APOE) ε4, link to increased white matter hyperintensity volume (WMHV). WMHVs 
indicate vascular risk and neurovascular injury in AD. The broader genetic link 
between AD risk and WMHV is not fully understood. We quantify AD polygenic risk 
score (PRS) associations with WMHV, excluding APOE. AD-PRS in smooth muscle 
cells (SMCs) shows a significant association with increased WMHV.

BACKGROUND: Life-space mobility can be a behavioral indicator of loneliness. 
This study examined the association between life-space mobility measured with 
motion sensors and weekly vs. annually reported loneliness.
METHODS: Participants were older adults who lived alone. Passive infrared motion 
sensors were placed in the bathroom, bedroom, kitchen, and living room. Time 
spent in each room and out-of-home across the day was derived and used as the 
measure of life-space mobility. Participants reported via weekly questionnaires 
whether they felt lonely. In annual visits, the UCLA loneliness scale was 
administered to a subsample (n = 71), and the scores were categorized into high, 
moderate, and low groups. We used generalized estimating equations (GEE) to 
correlate life-space mobility with weekly and yearly loneliness. Repeated 
observations from each individual were bootstrapped for 1000 rounds to associate 
annual and weekly loneliness measures.
RESULTS: We analyzed 4995 weeks of data from 139 participants (age = 78.1 ± 8.6, 
74% female, 23% African Americans, 14% with MCI diagnosis). An additional hour 
in the bedroom in the afternoon was associated with a 21.4% increased odds 
(OR = 1.214, p = 0.049) of experiencing loneliness in the week. An additional 
hour out-of-home in the morning and in the afternoon was associated with 18.2% 
(OR = 0.818, p = 0.040) and 15.3% (OR = 0.847, p = 0.018) fewer odds of 
experiencing weekly loneliness. In the subsample with annual loneliness 
assessments, an additional hour out-of-home was associated with 38.1% 
(OR = 0.619, p = 0.006) fewer odds of being in the high UCLA loneliness group. 
Compared with the low UCLA group, those with high UCLA scores were five times 
more likely to report loneliness weekly (OR = 5.260, p = 0.0004).
CONCLUSIONS: Frequent and objective measurements of mobility combined with 
self-reported social wellbeing information can offer new insights into the 
experience of loneliness and provide opportunities for timely interventions.

The patch clamp technique is a fundamental tool for investigating ion channel 
dynamics and electrophysiological properties. This study proposes the first 
artificial intelligence framework for characterizing multiple ion channel 
kinetics of whole-cell recordings. The framework integrates machine learning for 
anomaly detection and deep learning for multi-class classification. The anomaly 
detection excludes recordings that are incompatible with ion channel behavior. 
The multi-class classification combined a 1D convolutional neural network, 
bidirectional long short-term memory, and an attention mechanism to capture the 
spatiotemporal patterns of the recordings. The framework achieves an accuracy of 
97.58% in classifying 124 test datasets into six categories based on ion channel 
kinetics. The utility of the novel framework is demonstrated in two 
applications: Alzheimer's disease drug screening and nanomatrix-induced neuronal 
differentiation. In drug screening, the framework illustrates the inhibitory 
effects of memantine on endogenous channels, and antagonistic interactions among 
potassium, magnesium, and calcium ion channels. For nanomatrix-induced 
differentiation, the classifier indicates the effects of differentiation 
conditions on sodium and potassium channels associated with action potentials, 
validating the functional properties of differentiated neurons for Parkinson's 
disease treatment. The proposed framework is promising for enhancing the 
efficiency and accuracy of ion channel kinetics analysis in electrophysiological 
research.

Delirium is a neuropsychiatric syndrome commonly presenting during acute 
illness. The pathophysiology of delirium is unknown, but neuroinflammation is 
suggested to play a role. In this cross-sectional study, we aimed to investigate 
whether cell-free DNA and markers of neutrophil extracellular traps in serum and 
CSF were associated with delirium and neuronal damage, assessed by neurofilament 
light chain. Hip fracture patients (n = 491) with a median (25, 75 percentiles) 
age of 83 (74, 88) years and 69% females were enrolled at Oslo University 
Hospital, Diakonhjemmet Hospital, Akershus University Hospital and Bærum 
Hospital. Delirium was assessed daily, pre- and postoperatively. Cognitively 
healthy adults (n = 32) with a median (25, 75 percentiles) age of 75 (70, 77) 
years and 53% females were included as controls. Cell-free DNA was measured by 
using the fluorescent nucleic acid stain Quant-iT PicoGreen® in serum and CSF. 
Myeloperoxidase-DNA and citrullinated histone H3 were analysed by enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay in serum. Hip fracture patients have significantly higher 
levels of cell-free DNA and neutrophil extracellular traps in blood than 
cognitively healthy controls. In hip fracture patients without dementia, 
cell-free DNA in CSF and serum was significantly higher in patients with (n = 
68) versus without (n = 221) delirium after adjusting for age and sex (70 (59, 
84) versus 62 (53, 77) ng/ml, P = 0.037) and 601 (504, 684) versus 508 (458, 
572) ng/ml, P = 0.007, respectively). In the total hip fracture cohort, CSF 
levels of cell-free DNA and neurofilament light chain were significantly 
correlated after adjusting for age and sex (r = 0.441, P < 0.001). The 
correlation was stronger in those with delirium (r = 0.468, P < 0.001) and 
strongest in delirious patients without dementia (r = 0.765, P = 0.045). In 
delirious patients without dementia, significantly higher levels of cell-free 
DNA in CSF and serum were shown. The association between cell-free DNA and 
neurofilament light chain suggest simultaneous release of cell-free DNA and 
neuronal damage during delirium.

BACKGROUND: Socially isolated individuals tend to have less access to 
cognitively stimulating activities, which could adversely impact their cognitive 
health. The Internet-Based Conversational Engagement Clinical Trial (I-CONECT) 
intervention was designed to deliver online conversation sessions to socially 
isolated older old adults to prevent cognitive decline. The current study 
examined the intervention efficacy on participants' weekly time spent 
out-of-home and their social interaction with family and friends.
METHODS: The intervention group engaged in frequent conversations with trained 
interviewers via the Internet. Both intervention and control group participants 
received 10-min weekly phone check-in calls over 48 weeks, during which they 
were asked to self-report their time (in hours) spent out of home and whether 
they had contacted family or friends during this week (yes/no). Linear 
mixed-effect models for repeated measures were run for time spent out-of-home, 
and mixed-effect models with a logistic link for contact with family and 
friends. The intervention effect was modeled by including an interaction term of 
time (measured in weeks) and group assignments (intervention vs. control). We 
ran subgroup analyses for participants with normal cognition (NC) and mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI). All models controlled for age, sex, race, education, 
and the historical event of COVID-19.
RESULTS: 5,495 weekly records were included in the analysis. The main effect of 
time was statistically significant (p < 0.001), suggesting participants spent 
more time out of home over time. Among the participants with NC, the 
intervention group had a steeper increase in their time spent out-of-home 
(p = 0.016) compared with the control group. Among the participants with MCI, 
the intervention group had an increased likelihood of contacting friends over 
time (p = 0.001) than the control group. The intervention effect on contact with 
family was not significant for either the NC or MCI group.
DISCUSSION: The I-CONECT intervention enhanced social activities among socially 
isolated older old participants, which could provide additional cognitive 
stimulation and prevent cognitive decline.

Cognitive function in healthy aging and neurodegenerative diseases like 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) correlates to olfactory performance. Aging and disease 
progression both show marked olfactory deficits in humans and rodents. As a 
clear understanding of what causes olfactory deficits is still missing, research 
on this topic is paramount to diagnostics and early intervention therapy. A 
recent development of this research is focusing on GABAergic interneurons. Both 
aging and AD show a change in excitation/inhibition balance, indicating reduced 
inhibitory network functions. In the olfactory system, inhibition has an 
especially prominent role in processing information, as the olfactory bulb (OB), 
the first relay station of olfactory information in the brain, contains an 
unusually high number of inhibitory interneurons. This review summarizes the 
current knowledge on inhibitory interneurons at the level of the OB and the 
primary olfactory cortices to gain an overview of how these neurons might 
influence olfactory behavior. We also compare changes in interneuron composition 
in different olfactory brain areas between healthy aging and AD as the most 
common neurodegenerative disease. We find that pathophysiological changes in 
olfactory areas mirror findings from hippocampal and cortical regions that 
describe a marked cell loss for GABAergic interneurons in AD but not aging. 
Rather than differences in brain areas, differences in vulnerability were shown 
for different interneuron populations through all olfactory regions, with 
somatostatin-positive cells most strongly affected.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative ailment that is becoming 
increasingly common, making it a major worldwide health concern. Effective care 
depends on an early and correct diagnosis, but traditional diagnostic techniques 
are frequently constrained by subjectivity and expensive costs. This study 
proposes a novel Vision Transformer-equipped Convolutional Neural Networks 
(VECNN) that uses three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging to improve 
diagnosis accuracy. Utilizing the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) dataset, which comprised 2,248 3D MRI images and diverse patient 
demographics, the proposed model achieved an accuracy of 92.14%, a precision of 
86.84%, a sensitivity of 93.27%, and a specificity of 89.95% in distinguishing 
between AD, healthy controls (HC), and moderate cognitive impairment (MCI). The 
findings suggest that VECNN can be a valuable tool in clinical settings, 
providing a non-invasive, cost-effective, and objective diagnostic technique. 
This research opens the door for future advancements in early diagnosis and 
personalized therapy for Alzheimer's Disease.

BACKGROUND: As a non drug and non invasive therapy, both transcranial 
alternating current stimulation (tACS) and transcranial direct current 
stimulation (tDCS) may modulate cortical rhythms and serve as potentially 
effective approaches to cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, 
studies using animal models of AD are quite limited.
METHODS: This study investigates the aftereffects of tACS and tDCS on brain EEG 
activity and associated exploratory behavior in normal aged and APP/PS1 
transgenic mice (15 months old). Anodal tDCS and 10 Hz tACS (350 μA, 20 min) 
were applied once and EEGs were recorded from the hippocampus (Hip) and 
prefrontal cortex (PFC) during spontaneous home-cage state and open-field 
exploration.
RESULTS: A key finding was that tDCS induced significant alpha (8-12 Hz) EEG 
changes while tACS induced peak frequency changes in the group difference 
between normal aged and AD mice. However, both groups showed similar increases 
in theta (4-8 Hz) EEG activity during open-field exploration and increases in 
gamma (20-100 Hz) EEG activity in spontaneous state, suggesting that the ongoing 
physiological state may be related to some of the EEG changes.
CONCLUSION: This study provides insight into the short-term aftereffects of 
transcranial current stimulation in the aging and AD brain and is the first 
animal study to compare brain activity between tACS and tDCS treatments.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic, progressive neurodegenerative 
disorder characterized by cognitive decline, memory loss, and impaired 
reasoning. It is the leading cause of dementia in older adults, marked by the 
pathological accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. 
These pathological changes lead to widespread neuronal damage, significantly 
impacting daily functioning and quality of life.
OBJECTIVE: This comprehensive review aims to explore various aspects of 
Alzheimer's disease, including its epidemiology, risk factors, clinical 
presentation, diagnostic advancements, management strategies, caregiving 
challenges, and emerging therapeutic interventions.
METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted across multiple electronic 
databases, including PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and Scopus, from their 
inception to May 2024. The search strategy incorporated a combination of 
keywords and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms such as "Alzheimer's 
disease," "epidemiology," "risk factors," "symptoms," "diagnosis," "management," 
"caregiving," "treatment," and "novel therapies." Boolean operators (AND, OR) 
were used to refine the search, ensuring a comprehensive analysis of the 
existing literature on Alzheimer's disease.
RESULTS: AD is significantly influenced by genetic predispositions, such as the 
apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele, along with modifiable environmental factors 
like diet, physical activity, and cognitive engagement. Diagnostic approaches 
have evolved with advances in neuroimaging techniques (MRI, PET), and biomarker 
analysis, allowing for earlier detection and intervention. The National 
Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association have updated diagnostic 
criteria to include biomarker data, enhancing early diagnosis.
CONCLUSION: The management of AD includes pharmacological treatments, such as 
cholinesterase inhibitors and NMDA receptor antagonists, which provide 
symptomatic relief but do not slow disease progression. Emerging therapies, 
including amyloid-beta and tau-targeting treatments, gene therapy, and 
immunotherapy, offer potential for disease modification. The critical role of 
caregivers is underscored, as they face considerable emotional, physical, and 
financial burdens. Support programs, communication strategies, and educational 
interventions are essential for improving caregiving outcomes. While significant 
advancements have been made in understanding and managing AD, ongoing research 
is necessary to identify new therapeutic targets and enhance diagnostic and 
treatment strategies. A holistic approach, integrating clinical, genetic, and 
environmental factors, is essential for addressing the multifaceted challenges 
of Alzheimer's disease and improving outcomes for both patients and caregivers.

Inhibition of neuroinflammation by GIBH-130 (AD-16) reduces neurodegeneration, 
motor deficits, and proinflammatory cytokines in a hemiparkinsonian model.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by the 
loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) of the 
brain, manifesting itself with both motor and non-motor symptoms. A critical 
element of this pathology is neuroinflammation, which triggers a harmful 
neurotoxic cycle, exacerbating cell death within the central nervous system. 
AD-16 (also known as GIBH-130) is a recently identified compound capable of 
reducing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines while increasing the 
expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines in Alzheimer's disease models. Here, 
for the first time, we sought to comprehend the potential impact of orally 
administered AD-16 in mitigating neurodegeneration and subsequent disease 
progression in PD. To accomplish this, 6- hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) unilateral 
striatal injections were employed to induce a PD model in male C57BL/6 mice. 
Cylinder and apomorphine-induced rotation behavior tests were conducted to 
assess motor behavior and validate the PD model 3 days after the injection. 
AD-16 was administered via gavage daily between days 3 and 9 after surgery. On 
the last day of treatment, motor tests were performed again. All animals were 
euthanized on day 10 and immunohistochemistry techniques were performed to 
detect tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and Iba-1 and thus label dopaminergic neurons 
and microglia in the SNc and striatum (CPu). These same regions were collected 
for ELISA assays to assess different cytokine concentrations. Our results 
revealed an enhancement in the motor function of the AD-16-treated animals, as 
well as reduced nigrostriatal neurodegeneration. In addition, AD-16 reduced the 
increase in microglia density and prevented the changes in its morphology 
observed in the PD animal models. Furthermore, AD-16 was able to avoid the 
increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines levels that were present in 
6-OHDA-injected animals who received vehicle. Consequently, AD-16 emerges as a 
compound with significant potential for negative modulation of neurodegeneration 
and neuroinflammation suppression in the 6-OHDA animal model of Parkinson's 
disease.

BACKGROUND: Although separate lines of research indicated a moderating role of 
sex in both sleep-wake disruption and in the interindividual vulnerability to 
Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related processes, the quantification of sex 
differences in the interplay between sleep-wake dysregulation and AD pathology 
remains critically overlooked. Here, we examined sex-specific associations 
between circadian rest-activity patterns and AD-related pathophysiological 
processes across the adult lifespan.
METHODS: Ninety-two cognitively unimpaired adults (mean age = 59.85 ± 13.77 
years, range = 30-85, 47 females) underwent 10 days of actigraphic recordings, 
and blood drawing. Standard non-parametric indices of 24-h rest-activity rhythm 
fragmentation (intradaily variability, IV) and stability (interdaily stability, 
IS) were extracted from actigraphy data using the GGIR package. Plasma 
concentrations of neurofilament light chain (NfL), glial fibrillary acidic 
protein (GFAP), amyloid-β42/40 (Aβ42/40), total tau, and tau phosphorylated at 
threonine 181 (p-tau181) or threonine 231 (p-tau231) were measured using Single 
molecule array technology. Multiple linear regression models were adjusted for 
age, sex, education, body mass index, and actigraphic recording duration.
RESULTS: Higher IV, indicating worse 24-h rest-activity rhythm fragmentation, 
was associated with elevated levels of plasma NfL (t(85) = 4.26, P < 0.0001), 
GFAP (t(85) = 2.49, P = 0.01), and at trend level with lower Aβ42/40 ratio 
values (t(85) = -1.95, P = 0.054). Lower IS, reflecting less day-to-day 
stability in the 24-h rest-activity rhythm, was linked to elevated levels of 
plasma NfL (t(85) = -2.24, P = 0.03), but not with the other plasma biomarkers. 
Importantly, interaction models demonstrated that male participants were driving 
the observed relationships between IV and plasma NfL (t(84) = 4.05, P < 0.001) 
or GFAP (t(84) = 3.60, P < 0.001), but also revealed a male vulnerability in 
models testing interactions with p-tau181 (IV: t(76) = 3.71, P < 0.001; IS: 
t(76) = -3.30, P = 0.001) and p-tau231 (IV: t(82) = 3.28, P = 0.002). 
Sensitivity analyses further showed that accounting for potential confounding 
factors such as APOE genotype, depression, and self-reported symptoms of 
possible sleep apnea did not modify the observed relationships.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the association between disrupted 
circadian rest-activity patterns and AD pathophysiological processes may be more 
evident in cognitively unimpaired males. Our results contribute to the precision 
medicine approach, and they have clinical implications for improved early 
detection and selection of at-risk individuals to be enrolled in preventive 
interventions.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the 
accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) and leading to cellular senescence and 
cognitive deficits. Cellular senescence contributes significantly to the 
pathogenesis of AD through the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), 
exacerbating Aβ deposition. This study investigates the protective effects of 
3-N-Butylphthalide (NBP), a compound derived from Apium graveolens Linn (Chinese 
celery), on Aβ-induced cellular senescence in U87 cells. Using RNA-sequencing 
and biochemical assays, we demonstrate that NBP ameliorate Aβ oligomer-induced 
cellular senescence and apoptosis, and regulated the expression of 
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) and components of the 
cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2)- phosphorylated retinoblastoma 1 
(pRB1)-Caspase3 pathway. Moreover, NBP was shown to suppress the expression of 
SASP-related genes. These findings suggest that NBP rescues U87 cells from Aβ 
oligomer-induced senescence and apoptosis through modulating the 
CDK2-pRB1-Caspase3 axis and SASP expression. Our results underscore the 
potential of NBP as a senostatic agent for AD which have not been reported in 
previous studies, offering insights into its mechanisms of action and paving the 
way for future studies on its efficacy in vivo and in clinical settings. Thus, 
we contribute to growing evidence supporting the use of senolytic and senostatic 
agents in the treatment of AD.

BACKGROUND: Maintaining autophagic homeostasis has been proved to play an 
important role in Alzheimer's disease.
OBJECT: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Fuzhisan(FZS) on 
autophagic function in Alzheimer's disease and to elucidate its potential 
mechanism through the P62 regulatory pathways.
METHODS: FZS was extracted by water extraction-rotary evaporation method. The 
novel object recognition test, morris water maze test and Y maze test were used 
to observe the cognitive and memory ability of APP/PS1 mice. The effects of FZS 
on the ultrastructure of mice hippocampus were examined by transmission electron 
microscopy. Molecular level changes were also further detected, including Aβ 
deposition, tau hyperphosphorylation, SOD, CAT and autophagy related proteins 
(p62, Nrf2, keap1, mTOR, LC3II/I, Beclin1, Atgs).
RESULTS: FZS could alleviate memory and cognitive impairment in APP/PS1 mice, 
increase the autophagic vesicles and organelle abundance in hippocampus. FZS 
also reduced the levels of Aβ and tau hyperphosphorylation in the hippocampus of 
model mice, upregulated the levels of SOD, CAT and autophagy related proteins 
(Nrf2, LC3II/LC3I, Beclin1, Atg7 and Atg12) as well as downregulated the 
expression of P62, keap1 and p-mTOR/mTOR proteins. Co-Ip results showed that FZS 
elevated the levels of p62/LC3 and P62-keap1-Nrf2 complex, but decreased the P62 
and keap1 association.
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that FZS may affect autophagy function and 
oxidative stress by regulating P62 and related pathways to promote the clearance 
of Aβ and phosphorylated tau, thereby improving the cognitive ability of AD, 
which provided a novel perspective for exploring the potential mechanism of FZS 
upon AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurological disorder, is one of the major reasons 
for memory loss in the world. AD is characterized by a sequela of cognitive and 
functional decline caused by brain cell degeneration. Paeoniflorin is a 
monoterpenoid glycoside found in plants of the Paeoniaceae family, which are 
known for their medicinal properties including dementia. In this project, we 
report actions of paeoniflorin on the two related cholinesterases (ChE): 
acetylChE (AChE) and butyrylChE (BuChE). Paeoniflorin, in a dose-dependent 
(maximum inhibition at 1 mg/mL) manner, inhibited both AChE (0.06-1 mg/mL) and 
BuChE (0.007-1 mg/mL) enzymes with maximum inhibition of AChE enzyme at 
90.3 ± 1.4%, while 99.4 ± 0.3% for BuChE enzyme. The EC50 value for the 
inhibitory effect of the compound against AChE was 0.52 mg/mL (0.18-1.52), while 
against BuChE was 0.13 mg/mL (0.08-0.21). The observed ani-ChE action was like 
an effect also mediated by the known ChE blocker physostigmine. Molecular 
interactions between paeoniflorin and both ChE enzymes were additionally sought 
via molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations for 100 ns, that showed 
paeoniflorin interacted with the active-site gorge of AChE and BuChE via 
hydrogen bonds and water bridging with the many amino acids of the AChE and 
BuChE enzymes. This study presents the ChE inhibitory potential of paeoniflorin 
against both AChE and BuChE enzymes. With this kind of inhibitory activity, the 
chemical can potentially increase ACh levels and may have use in the treatment 
of dementia of AD.

Cardiac effects and comorbidities of neurological diseases.

Author information:

Health Sciences, Ankara, Turkiye.

Neurological disorders encompass a complex and heterogeneous spectrum of 
diseases affecting the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nervous system, each 
presenting unique challenges that extend well beyond primary neurological 
symptoms. These disorders profoundly impact cardiovascular health, prompting an 
intensified exploration into the intricate interconnections between the 
neurological and cardiovascular systems. This review synthesizes current 
insights and research on cardiovascular comorbidities associated with major 
neurological conditions, including stroke, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, 
multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease. The cardiovascular sequelae of 
these neurological disorders are multifactorial. For instance, strokes not only 
predispose individuals to arrhythmia and heart failure but also exacerbate 
preexisting cardiovascular risk factors. Similarly, epilepsy is associated with 
autonomic dysregulation and an elevated risk of sudden cardiac death, 
underscoring the necessity for vigilant cardiac monitoring in affected 
individuals. Parkinson's disease manifests with orthostatic hypotension and 
cardiac sympathetic denervation, significantly contributing to morbidity. 
Additionally, multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease exhibit cardiovascular 
autonomic dysfunction and heightened cardiovascular risk, underscoring the need 
for proactive management strategies. Mechanistically, these conditions disrupt 
autonomic nervous system regulation, induce chronic inflammation, and may share 
genetic susceptibilities, each contributing to cardiovascular pathology. 
Effective management of these complexities requires an integrative approach that 
includes risk factor modification, pharmacotherapy, lifestyle interventions, and 
comprehensive patient education. Future research directions include identifying 
novel therapeutic targets, conducting large-scale clinical trials, and 
investigating genetic biomarkers to individualize treatment strategies. By 
addressing the multifaceted interactions between neurological disorders and 
cardiovascular health, healthcare providers can optimize patient care, reducing 
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in this vulnerable population.

Sleep discrepancy (negative discrepancy reflects worse self-reported sleep than 
objective measures, such as actigraphy, and positive discrepancy the opposite) 
has been linked to adverse health outcomes. This study is first to investigate 
the relationship between sleep discrepancy and brain glucose metabolism 
(assessed globally and regionally via positron emission tomography), and to 
evaluate the contribution of insomnia severity and depressive symptoms to any 
associations. Using data from cognitively unimpaired community-dwelling older 
adults (N = 68), cluster analysis was used to characterise sleep discrepancy 
(for total sleep time (TST), wake after sleep onset (WASO), and sleep efficiency 
(SE)), and logistic regression was used to explore sleep discrepancy's 
associations with brain glucose metabolism, while controlling for insomnia 
severity and depressive symptoms. Lower glucose metabolism across multiple brain 
regions was associated with negative discrepancy for WASO and SE, and positive 
discrepancy for WASO only (large effect sizes; β ≥ 0.5). Higher glucose 
metabolism in the superior parietal and posterior cingulate regions was 
associated with negative discrepancy for TST (large effect sizes; β ≥ 0.5). 
These associations remained when controlling for insomnia severity and 
depressive symptoms, suggesting a unique role of sleep discrepancy as a 
potential early behavioural marker of brain health.

Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting the vascular system, 
characterised by the accumulation of modified lipoproteins, immune cell 
aggregation and the development of fibrous tissue within blood vessel walls. As 
atherosclerosis impacts blood vessels, its adverse effects may manifest across 
various tissues and organs. In this review, we examine the association of 
atherosclerosis with Alzheimer's disease, stroke, pancreatic and thyroid 
dysfunction, kidney stones and chronic kidney diseases. In several cases, the 
reciprocal causative effect of these diseases on the progression of 
atherosclerosis is also discussed. Particular attention is given to common risk 
factors, biomarkers and identified molecular mechanisms linking the 
pathophysiology of atherosclerosis to the dysfunction of multiple tissues and 
organs. Understanding the role of atherosclerosis and its associated 
microenvironmental conditions in the pathology of multi-organ disorders may 
unveil novel therapeutic avenues for the prevention and treatment of 
cardiovascular and associated diseases.

The driving mechanisms at the base of the clearance of biological wastes in the 
brain interstitial space (ISS) are still poorly understood and an actively 
debated subject. A complete comprehension of the processes that lead to the 
aggregation of amyloid proteins in such environment, hallmark of the onset and 
progression of Alzheimer's disease, is of crucial relevance. Here we employ 
combined computational fluid dynamics and molecular dynamics techniques to 
uncover the role of fluid flow and proteins transport in the brain ISS. Our work 
identifies diffusion as the principal mechanism for amyloid-β proteins 
clearance, whereas fluid advection may lead transport for larger molecular 
bodies, like amyloid-β aggregates or extracellular vesicles. We also clearly 
quantify the impact of large nascent prefibrils on the fluid flowing and 
shearing. Finally, we show that, even in the irregular brain interstitial space 
(ISS), hydrodynamic interactions enhance amyloid-β aggregation at all stages of 
the aggregation pathway. Our results are key to understand the role of fluid 
flow and solvent-solute interplay on therapeutics like antibodies acting in the 
brain ISS.

The diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) often cause irreversible damage 
to the human body and have a poor prognosis, posing a significant threat to 
human health. They have brought enormous burdens to society and healthcare 
systems. However, due to the complexity of their causes and mechanisms, 
effective treatment methods are still lacking. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), as 
a physical therapy, has been utilized in the treatment of various diseases. VNS 
has shown promising outcomes in some CNS diseases and has been approved by the 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States for epilepsy and 
depression. Moreover, it has demonstrated significant potential in the treatment 
of stroke, consciousness disorders, and Alzheimer's disease. Nevertheless, the 
exact efficacy of VNS, its beneficiaries, and its mechanisms of action remain 
unclear. This article discusses the current clinical evidence supporting the 
efficacy of VNS in CNS diseases, providing updates on the progress, potential, 
and potential mechanisms of action of VNS in producing effects on CNS diseases.

A systematic review and meta-analysis examined the impact of gut microbiota in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Dysbiosis may influence neurodegeneration 
by affecting gut permeability and neurotrophic factors, leading to cognitive 
decline. The study analyzed microbiome differences between patients with AD and 
healthy individuals, as well as the impact of various interventions in both 
preclinical and clinical studies. Of 60 studies reviewed, 12 were excluded from 
the meta-analysis due to unsuitable data or lack of control groups. 
Meta-analyses revealed significant cognitive impairment in AD patients and 
animal models, with specific tests identifying these deficits. Notably, 
Bacteroides levels were higher in patients with AD, whereas probiotics improved 
Prevotella levels. Natural treatments increased Bacteroidetes and reduced 
Firmicutes in animal models. The findings emphasize the need for standardized 
methods to develop therapies targeting the gut microbiota to restore cognition 
in AD. Understanding individual dysbiosis could further clarify the cognitive 
effects of the gut-brain axis.
HIGHLIGHTS: Dysbiosis in the gut microbiota is linked to cognitive decline in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD).Patients with AD show significant differences in 
Bacteroides levels compared to healthy individuals.Probiotic treatments increase 
Prevotella levels in AD animal models.Natural agents boost Bacteroidetes and 
reduce Firmicutes in AD animal models.Human studies show no consistent effects 
of gut microbiota interventions on cognitive function in AD.

have found that magnetic resonance imaging plays an important role in the early 
diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. This article tries to review the application 
of magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of 
Alzheimer's disease.

MicroRNA-222 (miR-222) plays a crucial role in neurodegeneration and is 
up-regulated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Andrographolide (Andro) has 
been reported to have anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects, showing 
potential for treating AD. The relationship between Andro's anti-AD mechanism 
and the regulation of miR-222 was discussed in this study. Andro protected 
against cytotoxicity induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or amyloid-β, 
accompanied by upregulating p62 and Nrf2 mRNA and protein, downregulating TLR4 
and NF-κBp65 mRNA and protein, and increasing LC3Ⅱ protein in vitro. miRNA and 
mRNA sequencing results showed that Andro downregulated miR-222 and upregulated 
sqstm1/p62. Andro was observed to inhibit the expression of miR-222 and the 
phosphorylation of NF-κBp65, while simultaneously enhancing the levels of p62 
and LC3Ⅱ proteins, decreasing Aβ levels, and attenuating the release of 
inflammatory factors in the 3xTg-AD mice. MiR-222 mimic increased NF-κBp65 mRNA 
and protein levels in LPS-induced cells, while miR-222 inhibitors increased p62 
mRNA and protein levels as well as Nrf2 and LC3Ⅱ protein, and decreased 
p-NF-κBp65 protein level in LPS-induced cells. Furthermore, miR-222 mimic 
reversed the increase in p62 and LC3Ⅱ protein and the decrease in NF-κBp65 mRNA 
and protein, as well as the decrease in Tau protein levels induced by Andro in 
LPS-induced cells. These findings suggest that Andro plays a neuroprotective 
role through downregulation of miR-222 to promote p62 expression while 
inhibiting NF-kB p65 expression, providing new insights into the mechanism of 
action of Andro for treating AD.
