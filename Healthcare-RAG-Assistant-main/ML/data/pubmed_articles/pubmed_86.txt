Accumulating evidence underscores exercise as a straightforward and 
cost-effective lifestyle intervention capable of mitigating the risk and slowing 
the emergence and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the 
intricate cellular and molecular mechanisms mediating these exercise-induced 
benefits in AD remain elusive. The present study delved into the impact of 
treadmill exercise on memory retrieval performance, hippocampal synaptic 
plasticity, synaptic morphology, and the expression and activity of 
α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic receptors (AMPARs) in 
6-month-old APP/PS1 mice. APP/PS1 mice (4-month-old males) were randomly 
assigned to either a treadmill exercise group or a sedentary group, with 
C57BL/6J mice (4-month-old males) as the control group (both exercise and 
sedentary). The exercise regimen spanned 8 weeks. Our findings revealed that 
8-week treadmill exercise reversed memory retrieval impairment in step-down fear 
conditioning in 6-month-old APP/PS1 mice. Additionally, treadmill exercise 
enhanced basic synaptic strength, short-term potentiation (STP), and long-term 
potentiation (LTP) of the hippocampus in these mice. Moreover, treadmill 
exercise correlated with an augmentation in synapse numbers, refinement of 
synaptic structures, and heightened expression and activity of AMPARs. Our 
findings suggest that treadmill exercise improves behavioral performance and 
facilitates synaptic transmission by increasing structural synaptic plasticity 
and the activity of AMPARs in the hippocampus of 6-month-old APP/PS1 mice, which 
is involved in pre- and postsynaptic processes.

The formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), composed of tau protein 
aggregates, is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases known as tauopathies, 
including Alzheimer's disease (AD). NFTs consist of paired helical filaments 
(PHFs) of tau protein with a dominant β-sheet secondary structure. Within these 
PHFs, the PHF6 hexapeptide (Val306-Gln-Ile-Val-Tyr-Lys311) has been commonly 
highlighted as a key site for tau protein nucleation. Palmatine chloride (PC) 
has been identified as an inhibitor of PHF6 aggregation, capable of reducing 
aggregation propensity at submicromolar concentrations. In pursuit of novel 
anti-AD drugs targeting early tau aggregation stages, we conducted an in silico 
study to elucidate PC's mechanism of action during PHF6 aggregation. Our 
observations suggest that while PHF6 can still initiate self-aggregation in the 
presence of PC, PC molecules subtly influence PHF6 aggregation dynamics, 
favoring smaller aggregates over larger complexes. The study underlined the key 
roles of aromatic rings in PC binding to different PHF6 aggregates by 
interacting through π-π stacking with the PHF6 Tyr310 side chain. The presence 
of aromatic rings in compounds to be able to inhibit the earlier complexation 
phase seems to be essential. These in silico findings lay a foundation for the 
design of compounds that could intervene in resolving the neurotoxicity of 
protein aggregates in AD.

BACKGROUND: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has demonstrated potential in 
mitigating Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the invasive nature of DBS 
presents challenges for its application. The olfactory bulb (OB), showing early 
AD-related changes and extensive connections with memory regions, offers an 
attractive entry point for intervention, potentially restoring normal activity 
in deteriorating memory circuits.
AIMS: Our study examined the impact of electrically stimulating the OB on 
working memory as well as pathological and electrophysiological alterations in 
the OB, medial prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and entorhinal cortex in amyloid 
beta (Aβ) AD model rats.
METHODS: Male Wistar rats underwent surgery for electrode implantation in brain 
regions, inducing Alzheimer's-like disease. Bilateral olfactory bulb (OB) 
electrical stimulation was performed for 1 hour daily to the OB of stimulation 
group animals for 18 consecutive days, followed by the evaluations of 
histological, behavioral, and local field potential signal processing.
RESULTS: OB stimulation counteracted Aβ plaque accumulation and prevented 
AD-induced working memory impairments. Furthermore, it prompted an increase in 
power across diverse frequency bands and enhanced functional connectivity, 
particularly in the gamma band, within the investigated regions during a working 
memory task.
CONCLUSION: This preclinical investigation highlights the potential of olfactory 
pathway-based brain stimulation to modulate the activity of deep-seated memory 
networks for AD treatment. Importantly, the accessibility of this pathway via 
the nasal cavity lays the groundwork for the development of minimally invasive 
approaches targeting the olfactory pathway for brain modulation.

OBJECTIVE: Pathological amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation and hyperphosphorylated tau 
proteins have been described in resected temporal lobe specimens of epilepsy 
patients. We aimed to determine cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ1-42 and p181-tau 
levels and cerebral Aβ deposits on positron emission tomography (Aβ PET) and 
correlate these findings with cognitive performance in adults with 
drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE).
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we enrolled individuals with 
drug-resistant TLE who were 25-55 years old. Each participant underwent 
18F-flutemetamol PET, determination of CSF Aβ1-42, p181-tau, and total tau, and 
a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment. We evaluated normalized standard 
uptake value ratios (SUVRs) for different brain regions on Aβ PET.
RESULTS: Thirty patients (mean age = 41.9 ± SD 8.1 years, 57% men) were 
included. The median disease duration was 9.5 (interquartile range = 4-24) 
years. Twenty-six patients (87%) had a clinically significant cognitive 
impairment on neuropsychological evaluation, 18 (69%) of the amnesic type. On Aβ 
PET, high uptake was observed in both mesial temporal regions (ipsilateral: SUVR 
z-score = .90, 95% confidence interval [CI] = .60-1.20; contralateral: SUVR 
z-score = .92, 95% CI = .57-1.27; p < .001), which was higher when compared to 
SUVR z-scores in all the remaining regions (p < .001) and in the ipsilateral 
anterior cingulate (SUVR z-score = .27, 95% CI = .04-.49, p = .020). No 
significant deposition was observed in other regions. Seven patients (23%) had 
low Aβ1-42 levels, and two (7%) had elevated p181-tau levels in CSF. Higher 
p181-tau levels correlated with poorer verbal fluency (R = -.427, p = .044).
SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings reveal a considerable Aβ deposition in mesial 
temporal regions and ipsilateral anterior cingulate among adults with 
drug-resistant TLE. Additionally, abnormal CSF Aβ1-42 levels were observed in a 
significant proportion of patients, and p181-tau levels were associated with 
verbal fluency. These results suggest that markers of neuronal damage can be 
observed in adults with TLE, warranting further investigation.

BACKGROUND: Schisandra extract has therapeutic and preventive effects on 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, this study evaluated the anti-AD potential 
of Schisandrin A (SCH A) using an in vitro cell model.
METHODS: SH-SY5Y and SK-N-SH cells were treated with 20 µM amyloid β-protein 
(Aβ)25-35. The Aβ25-35-induced cells were then exposed to different 
concentrations of SCH A (1, 5, 10, 15 µg/mL). Moreover, to further explore the 
role of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated 
protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in the anti-AD effects of SHC A, SH-SY5Y cells 
were treated with SCH A following incubation with ERK activator LM22B-10. The 
impact of SCH A on cell viability and apoptosis was evaluated using 
3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and flow 
cytometry. Furthermore, the oxidative stress markers and inflammatory cytokine 
levels were also assessed. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were 
examined using 2',7'-Dichlorodihydrofluorescein Diacetate (DCFH-DA) method. 
Finally, Western blot analysis was employed to evaluate the phospho-ERK1/2 
(p-ERK1/2) and ERK1/2.
RESULTS: We observed that SCH A treatment (5, 10, 15 µg/mL) substantially 
increased the cell viability (p < 0.05), and reduced the apoptosis rate (10 and 
15 µg/mL) in SH-SY5Y and SK-N-SH cells (p < 0.05). SCH A significantly 
ameliorated oxidative stress and reduced inflammatory cytokine levels in 
Aβ25-35-induced cells (p < 0.05). Furthermore, SCH A up-regulated the p-ERK1/2 
to ERK1/2 ratio in Aβ25-35-induced cells. However, LM22B-10 treatment was found 
to exacerbate this effect of SCH A (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: SCH A reduces the Aβ25-35-induced inflammatory response and 
oxidative stress in SH-SY5Y and SK-N-SH cells, and the activation of the 
ERK/MAPK signaling pathway was related to its potential mechanism.

BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is complex. Recent 
research suggests that AD patients have early disorders in brain cholesterol 
metabolism. Cholesterol and its derivatives accumulate in neurons, leading to 
p-Tau overproduction and synaptic dysfunction, initiating AD progression. 
Calycosin-7-O-β-D-glucoside (CG), a distinctive constituent of Astragali Radix, 
holds a representative position. Many clinical trials have demonstrated that CG 
can attenuate cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury and preserve the structural 
integrity of the blood-brain barrier. However, whether CG alleviates 
tau-mediated neurodegeneration by increasing cholesterol efflux after lipid 
accumulation remains unexplored.
METHODS: Ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass 
spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS) and multivariate data analysis were employed to 
investigate metabolic changes in HT22 cells induced by sodium palmitate 
following 24 hours of CG treatment. The potential therapeutic mechanisms of CG 
on AD were further examined through Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes 
(KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis.
RESULTS: Metabolomic analysis characterized 24 potential biomarkers, revealing 
that CG could ameliorate cholesterol metabolic pathways. The results of cell 
experiments revealed that CG can increase the expression of enzyme cholesterol 
24-hydroxylase (CYP46A1) (p < 0.05) and the level of 24 hydroxycholesterol 
(24-OHC) (p < 0.05), reduce the expression of p-Tau (Thr231)/Tau (p < 0.01), 
inhibit the formation of lipid droplets.
CONCLUSION: CG may inhibit the accumulation of cholesterol and its derivatives 
in neurons by affecting the CYP46A1-CE-Tau axis, offering a potential 
therapeutic strategy for AD.

Alzheimer's disease is the most common form, accounting for 60-70% of 55 million 
dementia cases. Even though the precise pathophysiology of AD is not completely 
understood, clinical trials focused on antibodies targeting aggregated forms of 
β amyloid (Aβ) have demonstrated that reducing amyloid plaques can arrest 
cognitive decline in patients in the early stages of AD. In this study, we 
provide an overview of current research and innovations for controlled release 
from nano-biomaterial-assisted chimeric antigen receptor macrophage (CAR-M) 
therapeutic strategies targeted at AD. Nano-bio materials, such as iron-oxide 
nanoparticles (IONPs), can be made selectively (Hp-Hb/mannose) to bind and take 
up Aβ plaques like CAR-M cells. By using nano-bio materials, both the delivery 
and stability of CAR-M cells in brain tissue can be improved to overcome the 
barriers of the BBB and enhance therapeutic effects. By enhancing the targeting 
capabilities and stability of CAR-M cells, mRNA-loaded nano-biomaterials can 
significantly improve the efficacy of immunotherapy for plaque reduction in AD. 
This novel strategy holds promise for translating preclinical successes into 
clinical applications, potentially revolutionising the management of AD.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Despite higher risks of developing Alzheimer's 
disease and Alzheimer's disease-related dementias among racial/ethnic minority 
populations, some maintain good cognition until old age. The aims of this study 
were to investigate heterogeneous cognitive trajectories among non-Hispanic 
Black and Hispanic older adults, examine cognitive impairment prevalence across 
trajectory classes, and identify associated social and behavioral determinants.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using 11 waves of data from the Health and 
Retirement Study (1996-2016), 1,322 non-Hispanic Black and 747 Hispanic adults 
aged 50+ years in 1996 with normal cognition were included. Latent class growth 
modeling and multinomial logistic regressions were performed to examine 
cognitive trajectories and associated determinants.
RESULTS: For both racial/ethnic groups, 3 trajectory classes were identified: 
high, medium, and low cognition. In the low-cognition class, 87% and 100% of 
non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic participants, respectively, developed cognitive 
impairment. For both racial/ethnic groups, older age and living in rural areas 
during schooltime increased the likelihood of being in the low-cognition class, 
whereas more education was associated with a lower likelihood. Unique risk and 
protective determinants for non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic participants were 
also identified.
DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: This study reveals the heterogeneity of cognitive 
trajectories among racial/ethnic minority older adults and various associated 
social and behavioral determinants. More prevention interventions and 
accessible, affordable diagnosis and treatment should be provided to older 
racial/ethnic minorities with these characteristics to reduce disparities. More 
research is needed to further explore associations between unique determinants 
and cognition in racial/ethnic minority populations to better inform 
interventions.

Plant-based natural compounds are widely used to treat various ailments owing to 
their readily availability and minimal adverse effects. This study aimed to 
perform qualitative and quantitative biochemical profiling and assess the in 
vitro anti-diabetic, anti-Alzheimer, and anti-cancer activities of various 
apricot (Prunus armeniaca) cultivars. High-performance liquid chromatography 
(HPLC) was utilized to determine the concentrations of bioactive compounds 
across 10 distinct apricot cultivars. Initial phytochemical screening revealed a 
significant content of secondary metabolites. Subsequently, methanolic extracts 
from these cultivars were evaluated for their therapeutic potential against 
several human cancer cell lines, including prostate cancer (PC-3), lung cancer 
(A-549), breast cancer (MCF-7), cervical cancer (HELA), and kidney cancer (HEK). 
Notably, the breast cancer cell line MCF-7 showed a pronounced inhibition rate 
post-treatment with the apricot extracts. Correlation analysis exhibited phenols 
are highly correlated with flavonoids (r = 0.92), DPPH (r = 0.95), and 
alpha-amylase (%) inhibition (r = 0.96), and showed a significant correlation 
with other parameters. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) revealed that PC1 
explained 43.31 % of the variance, while PC2 explained 12.88 %, together 
explaining 80.033 % of the total variance. PC1 was identified as the dominant 
axis, indicating the primary pattern of variation among the variables. 
Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) divided the cultivars into 2 main clusters, 
with cluster 2 further subdivided into various sub-clusters and 
sub-sub-clusters. This analysis highlighted distinct genetic similarities and 
differences among the apricot cultivars. Among the tested cultivars, 'Irani' and 
'Tilton' were found to contain the highest levels of bioactive constituents. 
This research marks the first comprehensive examination of the impacts of these 
two apricot cultivars. The findings from this study provide a robust scientific 
foundation for the future isolation and purification of therapeutic compounds, 
potentially leading to their application in pharmaceuticals or dietary 
supplements. This research contributes significantly to the understanding of the 
pharmacological properties of apricot cultivars and establishes a basis for 
further investigation into their clinical benefits.

By age 40 years, over 90% of adults with Down syndrome have Alzheimer's disease 
pathology and most progress to dementia. Despite having few systemic vascular 
risk factors, individuals with Down syndrome have elevated cerebrovascular 
disease markers that track with the clinical progression of Alzheimer's disease, 
suggesting a role of cerebrovascular disease that is hypothesized to be mediated 
by inflammatory factors. This study examined the pathways through which small 
vessel cerebrovascular disease contributes to Alzheimer's disease-related 
pathophysiology and neurodegeneration in adults with Down syndrome. One hundred 
eighty-five participants from the Alzheimer's Biomarkers Consortium-Down 
Syndrome [mean (SD) age = 45.2 (9.3) years] with available MRI and plasma 
biomarker data were included in this study. White matter hyperintensity (WMH) 
volumes were derived from T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery MRI 
scans, and plasma biomarker concentrations of amyloid beta 42/40, phosphorylated 
tau 217, astrocytosis (glial fibrillary acidic protein) and neurodegeneration 
(neurofilament light chain) were measured with ultrasensitive immunoassays. We 
examined the bivariate relationships of WMH, amyloid beta 42/40, phosphorylated 
tau 217 and glial fibrillary acidic protein with age-residualized neurofilament 
light chain across Alzheimer's disease diagnostic groups. A series of mediation 
and path analyses examined statistical pathways linking WMH and Alzheimer's 
disease pathophysiology to promote neurodegeneration in the total sample and 
groups stratified by clinical diagnosis. There was a direct and indirect 
bidirectional effect through the glial fibrillary acidic protein of WMH on 
phosphorylated tau 217 concentration, which was associated with neurofilament 
light chain concentration in the entire sample. Amongst cognitively stable 
participants, WMH was directly and indirectly, through glial fibrillary acidic 
protein, associated with phosphorylated tau 217 concentration, and in those with 
mild cognitive impairment, there was a direct effect of WMH on phosphorylated 
tau 217 and neurofilament light chain concentrations. There were no associations 
of WMH with biomarker concentrations among those diagnosed with dementia. The 
findings from this cross-sectional study suggest that among individuals with 
Down syndrome, cerebrovascular disease promotes neurodegeneration by increasing 
astrocytosis and tau pathophysiology in the presymptomatic phases of Alzheimer's 
disease, but future studies will need to confirm these associations with 
longitudinal data. This work joins an emerging literature that implicates 
cerebrovascular disease and its interface with neuroinflammation as a core 
pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease in adults with Down syndrome.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent type of dementia, but its 
etiopathogenesis is not yet fully understood. Recent preclinical studies and 
clinical evidence indicate that changes in the gut microbiome could potentially 
play a role in the accumulation of amyloid beta. However, the relationship 
between gut dysbiosis and AD is still elusive. In this review, the potential 
impact of the gut microbiome on AD development and progression is discussed. 
Pre-clinical and clinical literature exploring changes in gut microbiome 
composition is assessed, which can contribute to AD pathology including 
increased amyloid beta deposition and cognitive impairment. The gut-brain axis 
and the potential involvement of metabolites produced by the gut microbiome in 
AD are also highlighted. Furthermore, the potential of antibiotics, prebiotics, 
probiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation, and dietary interventions as 
complementary therapies for the management of AD is summarized. This review 
provides valuable insights into potential therapeutic strategies to modulate the 
gut microbiome in AD.

OBJECTIVES: Mazus pumilus (MP) an Asian flowering plant, known for various 
reported pharmacological activities including antioxidant, anti-nociceptive, 
anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antibacterial, antifungal, and hepatoprotective 
effects. This study focused on further exploring Mazus pumilus's methanol leaf 
extract (MPM) for bioactive principles and investigating its neuroprotective and 
cognition-enhancing potential in Alzheimer's disease models.
METHODS: For the phytochemical screening and identification, TLC, HPLC, and 
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) were employed. In-vitro antioxidant potential 
was assayed by DPPH Free Radical Scavenging method, followed by in-vivo 
neuroprotective effect of MPM (100, 200, 300 mg/kg) using Wistar-albino rats, 
sodium azide for induction of AD and rivastigmine as standard. Over 21 days, we 
observed neurobehavioral changes and performed biochemical (GSH, CAT, SOD, and 
AchE activity) and histopathological evaluations.
RESULTS: Results revealed the presence of alkaloids, flavonoids, amino acids, 
terpenoids, glycosides, sterols, and saponins. HPLC analysis confirmed the 
presence of gallic acids, sinapic acid, and caffeic acid. DPPH confirmed the 
antioxidant effect of MPM, which served as a base for its potential 
neuroprotective activity. Biochemically, oxidative stress markers improved 
significantly post-treatment, with decreased GSH, SOD, CAT levels, and increased 
AchE activity, indicating a reversal of AD-induced changes. Behavioral 
assessments showed improvements in locomotion, memory, spatial learning, and 
cognition. Histologically, there was a dose-dependent reduction in 
neurodegenerative features like neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid beta 
plaques.
CONCLUSIONS: Hence, this study concluded MPM is a promising candidate for 
prophylaxis and treatment of behavioral deficits and cognitive dysfunction in 
Alzheimer's disease.

Alcohol use disorder has been associated with the development of 
neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, recent 
studies demonstrate that moderate alcohol consumption may be protective against 
dementia and cognitive decline. We examined astrocyte function, low-density 
lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), and the NF-κB p65 and 
IKK-α/β signaling pathways in modulating neuroinflammation and amyloid beta (Aβ) 
deposition. We assessed apolipoprotein E (ApoE) in the brain of APP/PS1 mice 
using IHC and ELISA in response to low to moderate ethanol exposure (MEE). 
First, to confirm the intracerebral distribution of ApoE, we co-stained with 
GFAP, a marker for astrocytes that biosynthesize ApoE. We sought to investigate 
whether the ethanol-induced upregulation of LRP1 could potentially inhibit the 
activity of IL-1β and TNF-α induced IKK-α/β towards NF-κB p65, resulting in a 
reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines. To evaluate the actual Aβ load in the 
brains of APP/PS1 mice, we performed with a specific antibody Aβ (Thioflavin S) 
on both air- and ethanol-exposed groups, subsequently analyzing Aβ levels. We 
also measured glucose uptake using 18F- fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron 
emission tomography (PET). Finally, we investigated whether MEE induced 
cognitive and memory changes using the Y maze, noble object recognition test, 
and Morris water maze. Our findings demonstrate that MEE reduced astrocytic 
glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and ApoE levels in the cortex and 
hippocampus in presymptomatic APP/PS1 mice. Interestingly, increased LRP1 
protein expression was accompanied by dampening the IKK-α/β-NF-κB p65 pathway, 
resulting in decreased IL-1β and TNF-α levels in male mice. Notably, female mice 
show reduced levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4, and IL-10 without 
altering IL-1β and TNF-α concentrations. In both males and females, Aβ plaques, 
a hallmark of AD, were reduced in the cortex and hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice 
exposed to ethanol starting at pre-symptomatic stage. Consistently, MEE 
increased FDG-PET-based brain activities and normalized cognitive and memory 
deficits in the APP/PS1 mice. Our findings suggest that MEE may benefit AD 
pathology via modulating LRP1 expression, potentially reducing neuroinflammation 
and attenuating Aβ deposition. Our study implies that reduced astrocyte-derived 
ApoE and LDL cholesterol levels are critical for attenuating AD pathology.

Anti-amyloid β Antibody Therapies for Alzheimer's Disease: Association between 
the Target of Amyloid β Aggregates and the Clinical Efficacy of Anti-amyloid β 
Antibody.

Sciences, Japan.

Phase 3 clinical trials have validated the clinical efficacy of some 
anti-amyloid β (Aβ) antibody therapies, such as lecanemab and donanemab. To 
date, several clinical trials of anti-Aβ drugs have been conducted. However, 
most of these methods have been unsuccessful. Various Aβ aggregates are present 
during Aβ aggregation. The difference in the clinical efficacy of anti-Aβ 
antibody therapy may be attributed to variations in the Aβ aggregates targeted. 
Lecanemab primarily targets protofibrils, and donanemab targets plaques. 
Solanezumab and bapinezumab target Aβ aggregates of monomers alone or from 
monomers to low molecular weight oligomers. Anti-Aβ antibody therapies with 
clinical cognitive efficacy are thus characterized by targeting 
large-molecular-weight Aβ aggregates, such as protofibrils and plaques. In 
addition, a positive association was observed between the reduction in amyloid 
deposition and the inhibition of cognitive decline.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe neurodegenerative disorder, and the current 
treatment options are limited. Mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (MSC-Exos) 
have garnered significant attention due to their unique biological properties, 
showcasing tremendous potential as an acellular alternative therapy for AD. 
MSC-Exos exhibit excellent biocompatibility and low immunogenicity, enabling 
them to effectively cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and deliver therapeutic 
molecules directly to target cells. They are highly efficacious in delivering 
nucleic acid-based drugs. Moreover, the production process of MSC-Exos benefits 
from a high proliferation capacity and multilineage differentiation potential, 
allowing for production while maintaining a stable composition. Despite the 
significant theoretical advantages of MSC-Exos, their clinical use still faces 
multiple challenges, including cross-contamination during isolation and 
purification processes, the complexity of their components, and the presence of 
potential adverse paracrine factors. Future research needs to focus on 
optimizing separation and purification techniques, enhancing delivery methods to 
improve therapeutic efficacy, and performing detailed analyses of the components 
of MSC-Exos. In summary, MSC-Exos hold promise as an effective option for the 
treatment of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases, driving their clinical 
research and use in related fields.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly. 
Amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaque accumulation and tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) 
formation in the brain are major neuropathological hallmarks of AD. 
Immunotherapies targeting Aβ and/or tau are deemed the most promising approaches 
for AD. Administrations with monoclonal antibodies against Aβ have yielded 
substantial breakthroughs clinically. Most vaccines tested clinically so far 
failed to prove efficacious in large part due to inappropriate design of vaccine 
antigens. In this study, a structure-guided approach was employed to design 
novel antigens targeting Aβ and/or tau by grafting multiple copies of Aβ and/or 
tau B-cell epitope peptide onto CRM197, which is the most widely used carrier 
protein in polysaccharide conjugate vaccines. The immunogenicity of the vaccines 
was evaluated in BALB/c mice and the efficacy was tested in a transgenic mouse 
model of human amyloidopathy. The antigens were highly immunogenic early 
vaccination substantially ameliorated cognitive decline in APP/PS1 mice and 
significantly reduced insoluble Aβ42/40 in the brains. These results demonstrate 
that the engineered antigens have protective effects on AD mice, offering a 
promising translatable strategy for the prevention and/or treatment of AD.

Autoimmune limbic encephalitis (ALE) represents a heterogeneous disease 
associated with antibodies targeting extracellular (ALEextra) epitopes, 
intracellular (ALEintra) epitopes, anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase65 ALE 
(ALEGAD65), and ALE without detectable antibodies (ALEabneg). Combining analysis 
of cellular parameters, investigated by flow cytometry, and soluble parameters 
in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from a large cohort of 148 ALE 
patients (33 ALEextra, 12 ALEintra, 28 ALE-GAD65, 37 ALEabneg) in comparison to 
paradigmatic examples for neuro-inflammatory (51 relapsing remitting MS patients 
(RRMS)), and neuro-degenerative (34 Alzheimer's disease patients (AD)) diseases 
revealed discrete immune signatures in ALE subgroups. Identification of 
ALE-subtype specific markers facilitated classification of rare ALE-associated 
tumors, which may prompt further diagnostic efforts in clinical practice. While 
ALEintra exhibited features of neuro-inflammation, ALEextra displayed features 
of neuro-inflammation as well as neuro-degeneration. Moreover, ALEGAD65 and 
ALEabneg lacked hallmarks of inflammation. This may explain the low efficacy of 
anti-inflammatory treatment regimens in ALEGAD65 and presumably also ALEabneg.

Endothelial dysfunction featuring insufficient endothelial nitric oxide synthase 
(eNOS) and accompanying nitric oxide (NO) deficiency is implicated in the 
pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. Restoring endothelial NO represents a 
promising approach to treating cerebrovascular diseases, including stroke. 
Low-power near-infrared (NIR) light shows diverse beneficial effects, broadly 
defined as photobiomodulation (PBM). The literature reports that PBM increases 
bioavailable NO. These lines of evidence indicate that PBM could be used to 
treat cerebrovascular diseases. Recent investigations revealed that PBM improved 
stroke outcomes in animal models via augmenting NO signalling and other 
pathways. However, clinical trials of PBM using NIR light in the NIR-I window 
(630-900 nm) have yet to demonstrate the beneficial effect of PBM on ischaemic 
stroke. Since NIR light in the NIR-II window (1000-1700 nm) with the largest 
penetration depth into tissues compared to NIR I has also been reported to 
augment NO bioavailability and cerebral blood flow ameliorating stroke injury, 
PBM using NIR-II light may be suitable for therapeutic use. This new 
non-pharmacological modality using a physical parameter of NIR-II laser could 
provide a new avenue for therapeutic strategies for cerebrovascular diseases. 
Since impaired NO production has been associated with neurological 
abnormalities, this novel therapeutic approach could be broadly explored to 
treat various disease conditions such as traumatic brain injury, stroke, and 
Alzheimer's disease. This review summarises recent findings on PBM in treating 
stroke and discusses its potential to treat other neurological diseases.

In the 50 years of my membership in ISOTT, I, Edwin M Nemoto, have enjoyed the 
application of many of the technologies developed in our society including 
microelectrodes for pH, PO2, and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in the 
measurement of tissue oxygenation and metabolism. The greatest joy has been the 
number of great scientists I have had the pleasure of knowing and exchanging 
scientific ideas with across the United States, Europe, and Asia. This will be 
the enduring legacy of ISOTT for me personally as we continue beyond our 
half-century existence.Every organ in our body, including the tegmentum, is 
endowed with microvascular shunts (MVS), which may be involved in physiological 
regulation, i.e. temperature regulation or pathophysiological responses to 
tissue injury and oedema. MVS that open in response to increased capillary 
resistance and tissue oedema in the brain, heart, kidneys, liver, and muscles 
conduct neither nutrient nor gas exchange with tissue promoting tissue oedema in 
a vicious cycle. Pharmacologic arteriolar vasodilation cannot correct the MVS 
flow as may occur after a stroke or traumatic brain injury because pan 
arteriolar vasodilation would shunt flow to the normal tissue and away from the 
injured brain in a "reverse" steal or a "Robin Hood" phenomenon. A high 
molecular weight (4000 kDa) drag-reducing polymer (DRP) of polyethylene oxide or 
Lamiflo™ enhances blood flow by altering the physical dynamics of red blood 
cells (RBC) and blood flow, increasing the shear rate in the microvasculature 
and capillaries where shear rate is highest as it is inversely proportional to 
the 3rd power of blood vessel diameter. The shear rate sensed on the endothelium 
through the glycocalyx exerts precise control of endothelial function, including 
endothelial water permeability, nitric oxide synthase activity, lymphocyte 
adhesion to and transport across the endothelium, and microglial activation, all 
in response to low endothelial shear rate. DRP has proven effective in reversing 
MVS flow and increasing capillary flow in haemorrhagic shock, myocardial 
ischaemia, stroke, renal ischaemia, traumatic brain injury, stroke, sepsis, and 
Alzheimer's Disease. Our aim is to establish the universality of MVS in the 
pathogenesis of vascular disease and in taking DRP to clinical treatment of 
vascular diseases.

PURPOSE: This study aims to assess the prognostic value of the fatty liver index 
(FLI), a noninvasive tool for hepatic steatosis assessment, in predicting 
all-cause and disease-specific mortality.
METHODS: We linked data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination 
Survey III (1988-1994) with Public-Use Mortality Files, forming a cohort of 
11 297 participants with a median follow-up period of 26.25 years. Cox 
proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the association between FLI 
and all-cause mortality, while Fine and Gray's models assessed the relationship 
between FLI and disease-specific mortality.
RESULTS: The FLI ≥ 60 was independently associated with an increased risk of 
all-cause mortality (hazard ratio = 1.24, P  < 0.001), as well as mortality from 
malignant neoplasms (hazard ratio = 1.18, P  = 0.048), diabetes (hazard 
ratio = 2.62, P  = 0.001), and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) (hazard 
ratio = 1.18, P  = 0.018), compared to FLI < 30. No significant associations 
were found with Alzheimer's disease, influenza and pneumonia, chronic lower 
respiratory diseases, or renal disorders. Subgroup analyses indicated that 
individuals who were females aged 40-60 (hazard ratio = 1.67, P  = 0.003), 
non-overweight (hazard ratio = 1.75, P  = 0.007), or without abdominal obesity 
(hazard ratio = 1.75, P  = 0.007) exhibited a stronger association between 
FLI ≥ 60 and all-cause mortality.
CONCLUSION: These findings support the prognostic value of the FLI for 
predicting mortality from all causes, malignant neoplasms, diabetes, and CVDs. 
Targeted attention is needed in postmenopausal women, non-overweight, and 
non-abdominally obese populations.

OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the antiseizure medication levetiracetam may 
improve cognition in individuals with Alzheimer's disease who have not 
previously experienced a seizure.
METHODS: We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover 
pilot study in individuals with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. 
Electroencephalography was performed at baseline and those with active 
epileptiform discharges were excluded. Eligible participants were randomized to 
placebo for 12 weeks or an active arm of oral levetiracetam (4 weeks 
up-titration to levetiracetam 500 mg twice daily, 4 weeks maintained on this 
dose followed by 4 weeks down-titration to nil). Participants then crossed over 
to the other arm. The primary outcome was change in cognitive function assessed 
by the Oxford Memory Task, a task sensitive to hippocampal memory binding. 
Secondary outcomes included tolerability, other neuropsychological scales, and 
general questionnaires.
RESULTS: Recruitment numbers were severely limited owing to restrictions from 
the COVID-19 pandemic at the time of the study. Eight participants completed 
both arms of the study (mean age 68.4 years [SD = 9.2]; 5 females [62.5%]). No 
participants withdrew from the study and there was no significant difference 
between reported side effects in the active levetiracetam or placebo arm. 
Measures of mood and quality of life were also not significantly different 
between the two arms based on participant or carer reports. In limited data 
analysis, there was no statistically significant difference between participants 
in the active levetiracetam and placebo arm on the memory task.
SIGNIFICANCE: This pilot study demonstrates that levetiracetam was well 
tolerated in individuals with Alzheimer's disease who do not have a history of 
seizures and has no detrimental effect on mood or quality of life. Larger 
studies are needed to assess whether levetiracetam may have a positive effect on 
cognitive function in subsets of individuals with Alzheimer's disease.
PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Abnormal electrical activity within the brain, such as 
is seen in seizures, might contribute to memory problems in people with 
dementia. We completed a clinical trial to see if an antiseizure medication, 
levetiracetam, could help with memory difficulties in people with Alzheimer's 
disease (the most common cause of dementia). In this pilot study, we could not 
prove whether levetiracetam helped memory function. We did show that the drug is 
safe and well tolerated in people with dementia who have not had a seizure. This 
work, therefore, offers a platform for future research exploring antiseizure 
medications in people with dementia.

BACKGROUND: Gabapentin is often administered PO for preappointment or 
in-hospital anxiolysis in cats. A previous study reported mild changes on the 
neurologic examination after administration.
OBJECTIVES: Investigate the effects of gabapentin on anxiety, sedation, 
compliance, and neurologic examination in 2 age groups of cats.
ANIMALS: Thirty-one young cats and 12 geriatric cats perceived by their owners 
to be healthy and neurologically normal.
METHODS: Prospective double-blinded clinical crossover study. Assessment of 
baseline sedation and anxiety was performed before initial neurologic 
examinations and after gabapentin administration (100 mg/cat). Assessments were 
repeated 90 to 120 minutes after administration. Ease of handling pregabapentin 
and postgabapentin was assessed in the younger cats. All examinations were 
performed by a board-certified veterinary neurologist and scoring of 
examinations was performed by a different, masked board-certified neurologist.
RESULTS: Sixteen cats (50%) in the younger cohort and 6 cats (50%) in the 
geriatric cohort exhibited an increase in their overall neurologic examination 
score postgabapentin administration, mainly through new or progressive postural 
reaction deficits and gait changes. Anxiety and sedation scores were 
significantly changed in the geriatric population (P < .01, P = .004, 
respectively); however, only sedation scores were significantly increased in the 
younger cats after gabapentin administration (P = .004).
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: All study participants showed mild 
neurologic changes after gabapentin administration, most markedly noted in the 
geriatric population. Dose reduction of gabapentin for preappointment anxiolysis 
and neurologic examination in geriatric patients should be considered.

AIMS: Although the neuroanatomical distribution of tau and amyloid-β is well 
studied in Alzheimer's disease (AD) (non)-amnestic clinical variants, that of 
neuroinflammation remains unexplored. We investigate the neuroanatomical 
distribution of activated myeloid cells, astrocytes, and complement alongside 
amyloid-β and phosphorylated tau in a clinically well-defined prospectively 
collected AD cohort.
METHODS: Clinical variants were diagnosed antemortem, and brain tissue was 
collected post-mortem. Typical AD (n = 10), behavioural/dysexecutive AD (n = 6), 
posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) AD (n = 3), and controls (n = 10) were 
neuropathologically assessed for AD neuropathology, concurrent pathology 
including Lewy body disease, limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 
encephalopathy neuropathologic change (LATE-NC), and vascular pathology. For 
quantitative assessment, we analysed the corticolimbic distribution of 
phosphorylated tau, amyloid-β, CD68, MHC-II, C4b, and glial fibrillary acidic 
protein (GFAP) using digital pathology.
RESULTS: Phosphorylated tau was distinctly distributed in each variant. In all 
variants, amyloid-β was neocortical-dominant, with a notable increase in the 
middle frontal cortex of behavioural/dysexecutive AD. Typical AD and PCA AD had 
no concurrent Lewy body disease, whereas three out of six cases with 
behavioural/dysexecutive AD did. LATE-NC stage >0 was observed in three AD 
cases, two typical AD (stage 1/3), and one behavioural/dysexecutive AD (stage 
2/3). Vascular pathology was present in each variant. In typical AD, CD68 and 
MHC-II were hippocampal-dominant. In behavioural/dysexecutive AD, C4b was 
elevated in the middle frontal and inferior parietal cortex. In PCA AD, MHC-II 
was increased in the fusiform gyrus, and GFAP in parietal cortices. Correlations 
between AD neuropathology and neuroinflammation were distinct within variants.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggests that different involvement of neuroinflammation 
may add to clinical heterogeneity in AD, which has implications for 
neuroinflammation-based biomarkers and future therapeutics.

White matter hyperintensities of presumed vascular origin (WMH) are associated 
with cognitive impairment and are a key imaging marker in evaluating brain 
health. However, WMH volume alone does not fully account for the extent of 
cognitive deficits and the mechanisms linking WMH to these deficits remain 
unclear. Lesion network mapping (LNM) enables us to infer if brain networks are 
connected to lesions and could be a promising technique for enhancing our 
understanding of the role of WMH in cognitive disorders. Our study employed LNM 
to test the following hypotheses: (i) LNM-informed markers surpass WMH volumes 
in predicting cognitive performance; and (ii) WMH contributing to cognitive 
impairment map to specific brain networks. We analysed cross-sectional data of 
3485 patients from 10 memory clinic cohorts within the Meta VCI Map Consortium, 
using harmonized test results in four cognitive domains and WMH segmentations. 
WMH segmentations were registered to a standard space and mapped onto existing 
normative structural and functional brain connectome data. We employed LNM to 
quantify WMH connectivity to 480 atlas-based grey and white matter regions of 
interest (ROI), resulting in ROI-level structural and functional LNM scores. We 
compared the capacity of total and regional WMH volumes and LNM scores in 
predicting cognitive function using ridge regression models in a nested 
cross-validation. LNM scores predicted performance in three cognitive domains 
(attention/executive function, information processing speed, and verbal memory) 
significantly better than WMH volumes. LNM scores did not improve prediction for 
language functions. ROI-level analysis revealed that higher LNM scores, 
representing greater connectivity to WMH, in grey and white matter regions of 
the dorsal and ventral attention networks were associated with lower cognitive 
performance. Measures of WMH-related brain network connectivity significantly 
improve the prediction of current cognitive performance in memory clinic 
patients compared to WMH volume as a traditional imaging marker of 
cerebrovascular disease. This highlights the crucial role of network integrity, 
particularly in attention-related brain regions, improving our understanding of 
vascular contributions to cognitive impairment. Moving forward, refining WMH 
information with connectivity data could contribute to patient-tailored 
therapeutic interventions and facilitate the identification of subgroups at risk 
of cognitive disorders.

In the Western Pacific Region, the prevalence of dementia is expected to 
increase, however, the diversity of the region is expected to present unique 
challenges. The region has varying levels of preparedness, with a limited number 
of countries having a specific national dementia plan and awareness campaigns. 
Diversity of risk and healthcare services within the region is exerting impact 
on diagnosis, treatment, care, and support, with most countries being under 
resourced. Similarly, the ability to monitor dementia-related indicators and 
progress research, particularly relating to treatment and clinical trial access 
needs to be addressed. Countries require comprehensive national plans that lay 
out how resources will be allocated to improve dementia literacy, train, and 
support carers, mobilise resources to reduce risk factors and improve research 
capabilities. These plans need to be informed by consumers and tailored to the 
region to develop an inclusive society for people living with dementia and their 
families.

Here we first review the limited available literature addressing the current 
landscape of specialist assessment services for dementia and cognitive decline 
and the preparedness for new amyloid-targeting therapies for Alzheimer's disease 
across the Western Pacific region. Considering the scarcity of literature, as 
national representatives of Western Pacific nations we were then guided by the 
World Health Organization's Global Action Plan on Dementia to provide 
country-specific reviews. As a whole, we highlight that the existing diverse 
socioeconomic and cultural landscape across the region poses unique challenges, 
including varying access to services and marked differences among countries in 
their preparedness for upcoming amyloid-targeting therapies for Alzheimer's 
disease. Therefore, there is an urgent call for intergovernmental collaboration 
and investment across the Western Pacific to ensure that for all nations, 
citizens living with dementia and cognitive decline have access to effective and 
equitable methods of diagnosis, treatment and care.

Parkinson's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder, is quickly progressing and 
accounts for 15% of dementia cases. Parkinson's disease is the second most 
frequent form of neuronal degeneration after Alzheimer's, with an average age of 
55 years for individuals exhibiting neuropsychiatric and physiological symptoms. 
Due to the effectiveness, low toxicity, and low side effects, bioactive 
compounds from plants have received increased attention recently as therapeutic 
drugs. In the current study, effective anti-neurodegenerative phytochemicals 
from Dodonaea viscosa were screened using in silico methods and have been 
proposed to be further investigated for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
The structures of twenty bioactive chemicals were screened and graph theoretical 
network analysis revealed alpha-synuclein as a potent therapeutic target. Based 
on docking scores, an effective bioactive molecule was selected, and its energy 
values, electrostatic potential surface and drug-like qualities were examined 
using molecular orbitals, pharmacokinetics and toxicity studies. Pinocembrin was 
found as a superior binder based on molecular docking as it demonstrated 
stronger binding with - 10.2 kcal/mol. An investigation using Ramachandran plot 
validated the protein-ligand complex secondary structure's stability. 
Pinocembrin, a bioactive phytochemical from Dodonaea viscosa, may be a viable 
lead molecule that may be developed as a candidate medicine for 
anti-neurodegenerative therapy against Parkinson's disease.

Apoptosis is a genetically programmed form of cell death that is substantially 
conserved across the evolutionary tree. Apoptotic cell elimination includes 
recognition, phagocytosis, and degradation. Failure to clear apoptotic cells can 
ultimately cause a series of human diseases, such as systemic lupus 
erythematosus, Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis, and cancer. Consequently, 
the timely and effective removal of apoptotic cells is crucial to maintaining 
the body's homeostasis. GPCRs belong to the largest membrane receptor family. 
Its intracellular domain exerts an effect on the trimer G protein. By combining 
with a variety of ligands, the extracellular domain of G protein initiates the 
dissociation of G protein trimers and progressively transmits signals 
downstream. Presently, numerous G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have been 
identified as participants in the apoptosis signal transduction pathway and the 
apoptotic cell clearance pathway. Therefore, studies on the mechanism of GPCRs 
in the clearance of apoptotic cells is important for the development of GPCRs 
therapeutics.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a debilitating progressively neurodegenerative 
disease. The best-characterized hallmark of AD, which is marked by behavioral 
alterations and cognitive deficits, is the aggregation of deposition of 
amyloid-beta (Aβ) and hyper-phosphorylated microtubule-associated protein Tau. 
Despite decades of experimental progress, the control rate of AD remains poor, 
and more precise deciphering is needed for potential therapeutic targets and 
signaling pathways involved. In recent years, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) 
and Akt have been recognized for their role in the neuroprotective effect of 
various agents, and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), a downstream enzyme, is 
also crucial in the tau phosphorylation and Aβ deposition. An overview of the 
function of PI3K/Akt pathway in the pathophysiology of AD is provided in this 
review, along with a discussion of recent developments in the pharmaceuticals 
and herbal remedies that target the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. In conclusion, 
despite the challenges and hurdles, cumulative findings of novel targets and 
agents in the PI3K/Akt signaling axis are expected to hold promise for advancing 
AD prevention and treatment.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurological disorder and multiple 
pathways are associated with its pathology. Currently available single-targeting 
drugs are found to be ineffective for the treatment of AD, and most of these 
drugs provide symptomatic relief. The multi-target directed ligand strategy is 
proposed as an effective approach for the treatment of AD. Herein, we report the 
design and synthesis of a series of 2-phenyl substituted chromone derivatives 
and their evaluation against AChE, MAO-B, and β amyloid self-aggregation 
inhibition. In the series, NS-4 and NS-13 were identified as the potent leads 
against all the specified targets. NS-4 and NS-13 exhibited balanced multipotent 
activities against AChE with IC50 values of 3.09 μM, and 0.625 μM and against 
MAO-B with IC50 values of 19.64 μM and 12.31 μM, respectively. These compounds 
also displayed 28.5% and 32.2% self-aggregation inhibition potential against 
Aβ1-42, respectively. All the compounds were found to be selective for AChE over 
BuChE. Additionally, NS-4 also exhibited potent BuChE inhibition with an IC50 
value of 1.95 μM. Moreover, NS-4 and NS-13 reduced intracellular ROS levels up 
to 65% against SH-SY5Y cells at 25 μM concentration. The lead compounds were 
found to be neuroprotective and exhibited no cytotoxicity even at 25 μM 
concentration. In enzyme kinetic inhibition studies, these compounds showed 
mixed-type inhibition to AChE. In the computational studies, binding 
interactions, and orientations of the ligands at the active site of the enzymes 
were analyzed and these lead compounds were found to be thermodynamically stable 
inside the active cavity for up to 100 ns.

BACKGROUND: Protein abundance levels, sensitive to both physiological changes 
and external interventions, are useful for assessing the Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) risk and treatment efficacy. However, identifying proteomic prognostic 
markers for AD is challenging by their high dimensionality and inherent 
correlations.
METHODS: Our study analyzed 1128 plasma proteins, measured by the SOMAscan 
platform, from 858 participants 55 years and older (mean age 63 years, 52.9% 
women) of the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) Offspring cohort. We conducted 
regression analysis and machine learning models, including LASSO-based Cox 
proportional hazard regression model (LASSO) and generalized boosted regression 
model (GBM), to identify protein prognostic markers. These markers were used to 
construct a weighted proteomic composite score, the AD prediction performance of 
which was assessed using time-dependent area under the curve (AUC). The 
association between the composite score and memory domain was examined in 339 
(of the 858) participants with available memory scores, and in an independent 
group of 430 participants younger than 55 years (mean age 46, 56.7% women).
RESULTS: Over a mean follow-up of 20 years, 132 (15.4%) participants developed 
AD. After adjusting for baseline age, sex, education, and APOE ε4+ status, 
regression models identified 309 proteins (P ≤ 0.2). After applying machine 
learning methods, nine of these proteins were selected to develop a composite 
score. This score improved AD prediction beyond the factors of age, sex, 
education, and APOE ε4+ status across 15 to 25 years of follow-up, achieving its 
peak AUC of 0.84 in the LASSO model at the 22-year follow-up. It also showed a 
consistent negative association with memory scores in 339 participants (beta = 
-0.061, P = 0.046), 430 independent participants (beta = -0.060, P = 0.018), and 
the pooled 769 samples (beta = -0.058, P = 0.003).
CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the utility of proteomic markers in 
improving AD prediction and emphasize the complex pathology of AD. The composite 
score may aid early AD detection and efficacy monitoring, warranting further 
validation in diverse populations.

OBJECTIVE:  This study aimed to evaluate the differences between Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) patients and controls in biochemistry and peripheral hemogram 
parameters neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocyte, platelet, and C-reactive protein 
(CRP) levels, lipid profile, inflammatory burden index (IBI), and hemoglobin, 
albumin, lymphocyte, and platelet (HALP) score and the relationship between 
inflammatory and immunonutritive biomarkers and cognitive impairment in 
patients.
METHOD: Data from 79 patients with AD and 42 controls were included in the 
study. Medical data of the participants were obtained from hospital records. IBI 
was obtained by using the following formula: CRP × neutrophil/lymphocyte. HALP 
score was calculated as (hemoglobin (g/L) × albumin (g/L) × lymphocytes 
(/L))/platelets (/L).
RESULTS:  Neutrophil count (p=0.003, effect size=0.60), CRP level (p<0.001, 
effect size=0.87), and IBI (p<0.001, effect size=0.93) were significantly higher 
in AD patients compared to the control group; hemoglobin (p<0.001, effect 
size=1.03), lymphocyte count (p<0.001, effect size=0.78), albumin level 
(p<0.001, effect size=1.31), and HALP score (p<0.001, effect size=0.85) were 
lower. According to the Standardized Mini Mental Test (SMMT) score, neutrophil 
count (p=0.001), CRP (p<0.001), and IBI (p<0.001) were significantly higher and 
lymphocyte count (p=0.001) and HALP score (p<0.001) were lower in the group with 
severe cognitive impairment. Albumin levels were highest in the group with mild 
cognitive impairment. In the patient group, there was a moderately significant 
negative relationship between SMMT score and age (p<0.001, r=-0.437), neutrophil 
count (p=0.033, r=-0.240), CRP (p<0.001, r=-0.451), and IBI (p<0.001, r=-0.538). 
Lymphocyte count (p<0.001, r=0.412), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (p=0.049, 
r=0.223), albumin levels (p=0.001, r=0.357), and HALP score (p<0.001, r=0.486) 
were moderately positively associated with SMMT score. Age (β=-0.437, p<0.001), 
HALP score (β=0.403, p<0.001), and IBI (β=-0.322, p=0.004) were found to be 
predictors for the severity of cognitive impairment.
CONCLUSION: Our results revealed that inflammation and immunonutritive status 
play an important role in the pathogenesis of AD. Novel inflammatory and 
immunonutritive biomarkers, and IBI and HALP score may be promising clinical 
tools that may pave the way for more personalized treatment strategies and 
interventions for patients.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical efficacy of individualized health education 
(IHE) and care mode based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) combined with 
Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) for lung cancer patients with brain 
metastases undergoing radiotherapy.
METHODS: This retrospective study involved 50 lung cancer patients with brain 
metastases. Patients were divided into a control group (n=25, conventional care) 
and an intervention group (n=25, individualized health education (IHE) care) 
according to their nursing model. Both groups underwent enhanced brain MRI 
scans. The patients were assessed using the Mini Mental State Scale (MMSE) 
before and at 1 month after radiotherapy. At the same time, Montreal Cognitive 
Assessment (MoCA) was used to assess the degree of cognitive impairment in both 
groups before and after the intervention. Finally, the European Organization for 
Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC QLQ-C30) questionnaire was used to 
evaluate the overall health status and quality of life (QOL) (including physical 
function, emotional function, and social function) of the two groups of patients 
after radiotherapy. The patients' self-care ability in daily life was assessed 
using Alzheimer's Disease Collaborative Study Activities of Daily Living 
(ADCS-ADL).
RESULTS: Following intervention, there was no significant difference in MMSE 
total scores between the control and intervention groups (P > 0.05), or in 
physical function scores (P > 0.05). However, the intervention group had 
significantly higher overall QOL scores compared to the control group (P < 
0.05), particularly in emotional and social function (P < 0.05). There was no 
significant difference in total MoCA scores between the two groups (P > 0.05), 
but the intervention group showed superior scores in visual-spatial, executive 
function, naming, and attention compared to the control group (all P < 0.05). 
Following intervention, the intervention group demonstrated better ADCS-ADL 
scores than the control group (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The IHE mode effectively improved emotional and social functions and 
enhanced QOL in lung cancer patients with brain metastases undergoing 
radiotherapy.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: The important role of catecholamines has been gradually 
emphasized in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative process. As the most 
prevalent form of cognitive dysfunction, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular 
dementia (VaD) have the distinct pathological features and pathogenic 
mechanisms, however, the differential involvement of central and peripheral 
catecholamines between AD and VaD was still unclear.
METHODS: Triple-transgenic AD (3 × Tg-AD) mice and chronic cerebral 
hypoperfusion (CCH) in rats induced by two-vessel occlusion (2VO) were used as 
the AD and VaD model in this study, respectively. The concentrations of 
catecholamines (dopamine, epinephrine and norepinephrine) and their metabolites 
(3-methoxytyramine, metanephrine and normetanephrine) in serum and five brain 
regions (hippocampus, cortex, corpus striatum, thalamus and pons) from 3 × Tg-AD 
mice and 2VO rats were quantitatively determined by liquid chromatography-tandem 
mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assay.
RESULTS: High expression and distribution of hippocampal dopamine, and 
epinephrine and norepinephrine in the cortex and thalamus were found in the 
early 3 × Tg-AD model, whereas chronic cerebral hypoperfusion induced by 2VO 
mainly affected the central noradrenergic and noradrenergic system, but not 
dopaminergic system. The increased serum levels of catecholamines were 
investigated in the 2VO rats, but not in the 3 × Tg-AD mice.
CONCLUSION: The differential expression and distribution of central 
catecholamines and their metabolites suggests the distinct 
catecholamines-related pathogenesis between AD and VaD. Peripheral catecholamine 
surge may be involved in the development of VaD, and the treatment strategy to 
prevent or reverse the effects of peripheral catecholamines may be protective 
for VaD.

OBJECTIVES: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is posing an increasing global threat and 
currently lacks effective treatments. Therefore, this study was aimed at 
exploring phytochemicals in Scabiosa columbaria (S. columbaria) as inhibitors of 
acetylcholinesterase (AChE), β-site APP cleavage enzyme 1 (BACE1), and TNF-α 
converting enzyme (TACE) in AD. S. columbaria contains various bioactive 
compounds, such as chlorogenic acid, linalool, and catechins, which are known 
for their detoxification properties, capacity to resist and manage harmful 
moisture buildup, and therapeutic roles in COVID-19. Several studies have also 
shown that S. columbaria extract has strong antioxidant activity, and may 
potentially decrease neuroinflammation in AD. Therefore, this study investigated 
the interactions between S. columbaria phytochemicals and key enzymes associated 
with AD, thus providing opportunities for the development of new therapeutic 
candidates.
METHODS: A total of 27 phytochemicals were evaluated for their inhibitory 
activity against AChE, BACE1, and TACE with YASARA Structure. ADMET profiles and 
toxicity were assessed. The top candidate compounds underwent 100 ns MD 
simulations.
RESULTS: All ligands met Lipinski's rule and showed low toxicity. Catechins, 
compared with the known drug galantamine, showed higher inhibitory activity and 
interacted with additional active sites on AChE, thus suggesting potentially 
higher efficacy. Moreover, chlorogenic acid showed stronger inhibitory activity 
against TACE than the control drug (aryl-sulfonamide), thereby suggesting a 
different mechanism of action. MD simulation revealed that the formed complexes 
had good stability. However, further exploration is necessary.
CONCLUSION: S. columbaria derivative compounds are promising drug candidates 
because of their properties, including the affinity of chlorogenic acid toward 
TACE and hydrogen bond enhancing ligand-receptor interactions. MD simulation 
indicated stable ligand-protein complexes, and the radius of gyration and 
MM-PBSA calculations revealed favorable binding and interaction energies. Our 
findings demonstrate the identified compounds' potential for further drug 
development.

Ferroptosis is a relatively recently discovered type of regulated cell death 
that is induced by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. The key contributing 
factors to ferroptosis are the loss of glutathione peroxidase 4 which is 
required for reversing lipid peroxidation, the buildup of redox-active iron and 
the oxidation of phospholipids containing polyunsaturated fatty acids. 
Ferroptosis has been associated with a number of diseases, including cancers 
such as hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer, acute renal damage and 
neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease, and 
there may be an association between ferroptosis and acute myeloid leukemia 
(AML). The present review aims to describe the primary regulatory pathways of 
ferroptosis, and the relationship between ferroptosis and the occurrence and 
development of AML. Furthermore, the present review comprehensively summarizes 
the latest advances in the treatment and prognosis of ferroptosis in AML.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) stands as significant challenge in realm 
of neurodegenerative disorder. It is characterized by gradual decline in 
cognitive function and memory loss. It has already expanded its prevalence to 55 
million people worldwide and is expected to rise significantly. Unfortunately, 
there exists a limited therapeutic option that would mitigate its progression. 
Repurposing existing drugs and employing nanoparticle as delivery agent presents 
a potential solution to address the intricate pathology of AD.
AREAS COVERED: In this review, we delve into utilization of nanoparticular 
platforms to enhance the delivery of repurposed drugs for treatment of AD. 
Firstly, the review begins with the elucidation of intricate pathology 
underpinning AD, subsequently followed by rationale behind drug repurposing in 
AD. Covered are explorations of nanoparticle-based repurposing of drugs in AD, 
highlighting their clinical implication. Further, the associated challenges and 
probable future perspective are delineated.
EXPERT OPINION: The article has highlighted that extensive research has been 
carried out on the delivery of repurposed nanomedicines against AD. However, 
there is a need for advanced and long-term research including clinical trials 
required to shed light upon their safety and toxicity profile. Furthermore, 
their scalability in pharmaceutical set-up should also be validated.

BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence suggested the association between gut dysbiosis 
and Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. However, it remained unclear how the 
gut microbiome and neuroinflammation in the brain mutually interact or how these 
interactions affect brain functioning and cognition. Here we hypothesized that 
"gut-brain" axis mediated by microbial derived metabolites was expected to novel 
breakthroughs in the fields of AD research and development.
METHODS: Multiple technologies, such as immunofluorescence, 16s rDNA sequencing, 
mass spectrometry-based metabolomics (LC-QQQ-MS and GC-MS), were used to reveal 
potential link between gut microbiota and the metabolism and cognition of the 
host.
RESULTS: Microbial depletion induced by the antibiotics mix (ABX) verified that 
"gut-brain" can transmit information bidirectionally. Short-chain fatty 
acid-producing (SCFAs-producing) bacteria and amino acid-producing bacteria 
fluctuated greatly in 5×FAD mice, especially the reduction sharply of the 
Bifidobacteriaceae and the increase of the Lachnospiraceae family. 
Concentrations of several Tryptophan-kynurenine intermediates, lactic acid, CD4+ 
cell, and CD8+ cells were higher in serum of 5×FAD mice, whilst TCA cycle 
intermediates and Th1/Th2 were lower. In addition, the levels of iso-butyric 
acid (IBA) in feces, serum, and brain of 5×FAD mice were increased compared with 
WT-M mice, especially in serum. And IBA in the brain was positively correlated 
with Aβ and proinflammatory factors.
CONCLUSION: Together, our finding highlighted that the alternation in gut 
microbiota affected the effective communication between the "gut-brain" axis in 
5×FAD mice by regulating the immune system, carbohydrate, and energy metabolism.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the role of cuproptosis in Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: An AD-related microarray dataset was downloaded from the Gene 
Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (GSE140830). Weighted gene co-expression 
network analysis was used to identify AD-related modular genes. The Venn 
analysis was performed to obtain module genes associated with apoptosis and 
cuproptosis. Besides, we conducted an enrichment analysis of overlapped genes 
and constructed the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, followed by 
screening hub genes and those significantly associated with AD were used to 
construct models of apoptosis and cuproptosis, respectively. Further, receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, decision curve analysis (DCA), 
and subgroup analysis were used to compare the AD prediction performance of two 
models. Finally, the accuracy and reliability of AD prediction models were 
verified by GSE26927.
RESULTS: We obtained 42 module genes related to apoptosis and 9 module genes 
related to cuproptosis. The enrichment analysis results revealed MAPK signaling 
pathway as the common signaling pathway of apoptosis- and cuproptosis-related 
genes. Next, the hub genes associated with apoptosis (TRADD, FADD, BIRC2, and 
CASP2) and cuproptosis (MAP2K1, SLC31A1, and PDHB) in AD were identified, which 
were used to construct apoptosis and cuproptosis models to distinguish AD 
patients from the control group (P < 0.05). The ROC, DCA, and subgroup analysis 
results showed that apoptosis-related models and cuproptosis-related models had 
comparable ability in predicting AD. GSE26927 further confirmed that the two 
models have comparable predictive effects for AD.
CONCLUSIONS: The cuproptosis model had a certain performance in predicting AD. 
Three hub genes (MAP2K1, SLC31A1, and PDHB) closely related to cuproptosis in AD 
might serve as biomarkers for AD diagnosis and treatment.

Emerging evidence supports the therapeutic potential of cannabinoids in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the underlying mechanism upon how cannabinoids 
impact brain cognition and AD pathology remains unclear. Here we show that 
chronic cannabidiol (CBD) administration significantly mitigates cognitive 
deficiency and hippocampal β-amyloid (Aβ) pathology in 5×FAD mouse model of AD. 
CBD achieves its curative effect mainly through potentiating the function of 
inhibitory extrasynaptic glycine receptor (GlyR) in hippocampal dentate gyrus 
(DG). Based on the in vitro and in vivo electrophysiological recording and 
calcium imaging, CBD mediated anti-AD effects via GlyR are mainly accomplished 
by decreasing neuronal hyperactivity of granule cells in the DG of AD mice. 
Furthermore, the AAV-mediated ablation of DG GlyRα1, or the GlyRα1S296A mutation 
that exclusively disrupts CBD binding, significantly intercepts the anti-AD 
effect of CBD. These findings suggest a GlyR dependent mechanism underlying the 
therapeutic potential of CBD in the treatment of AD.

Elucidating the intricate molecular mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
requires a multidimensional analysis incorporating various omics data. In this 
study, we employed transcriptome and proteome profiling of AppNL-G-F, a human 
APP knock-in model of amyloidosis, at the early and mid-stages of amyloid-beta 
(Aβ) pathology to delineate the impacts of Aβ deposition on brain cells. By 
contrasting AppNL-G-F mice with TREM2 (Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid 
cells 2) knockout models, our study further investigates the role of TREM2, a 
well-known AD risk gene, in influencing microglial responses to Aβ pathology. 
Our results highlight altered microglial states as a central feature of Aβ 
pathology, characterized by the significant upregulation of microglia-specific 
genes related to immune responses such as complement system and antigen 
presentation, and catabolic pathways such as phagosome formation and lysosome 
biogenesis. The absence of TREM2 markedly diminishes the induction of these 
genes, impairs Aβ clearance, and exacerbates dystrophic neurite formation. 
Importantly, TREM2 is required for the microglial engagement with Aβ plaques and 
the formation of compact Aβ plaque cores. Furthermore, this study reveals 
substantial disruptions in energy metabolism and protein synthesis, signaling a 
shift from anabolism to catabolism in response to Aβ deposition. This metabolic 
alteration, coupled with a decrease in synaptic protein abundance, occurs 
independently of TREM2, suggesting the direct effects of Aβ deposition on 
synaptic integrity and plasticity. In summary, our findings demonstrate altered 
microglial states and metabolic disruption following Aβ deposition, offering 
mechanistic insights into Aβ pathology and highlighting the potential of 
targeting these pathways in AD therapy.

Over the past decade, the greatest promise for treating severe and currently 
incurable systemic and neurodegenerative diseases has turned to agents capable 
of effectively degrading pathological amyloid deposits without causing side 
effects. Specifically, amyloid destruction observed in immunotherapy is 
hypothesized to occur through activation of proteolytic enzymes. This study 
examines poorly understood effects of an immune enzyme, extracellular matrix 
metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9), on amyloids associated with Alzheimer's and 
Parkinson's diseases, lysozyme, insulin, and dialysis-related amyloidoses. The 
study establishes the universality of MMP9's effect on various amyloids, with 
its efficacy largely depending on the fibrillar cluster size. Irreversible 
amyloid degradation by MMP9 is attributed to the destruction of intramolecular 
interactions rather than intermolecular hydrogen bonds in the fibril backbone. 
This process results in the loss of ordered fiber structure without reducing 
aggregate size or increasing cytotoxicity. Thus, MMP9 can mitigate side effects 
of anti-amyloid therapy associated with the formation of low-molecular-weight 
degradation products that may accelerate fibrillogenesis and amyloid propagation 
between tissues and organs. MMP9 shows promise as a component of safe 
anti-amyloid drugs by enhancing the accessibility of binding sites through 
"loosening" amyloid clusters, which facilitates subsequent fragmentation and 
monomerization by other enzymes.

BACKGROUND: Utilizing interictal manifestations for the diagnosis of epilepsy is 
challenging. We investigated whether an interictal "head-turning sign," 
typically indicative of dependence on others observed in Alzheimer's disease, 
can act as a behavioral marker of idiopathic generalized epilepsy.
METHODS: This multicenter study examined 579 consecutive patients, with a mean 
age of 36.8 ± 20.4 years, who did not have an intellectual disability and had 
their first outpatient visit for epilepsy evaluation between 2019 and 2023. 
Patients were categorized into IGE, non-IGE epilepsy, non-epileptic, and 
psychiatric conditions based on their ultimate diagnostic outcomes to identify 
difference of the occurrence of the head-turning sign among them. Additionally, 
we extracted data from patients under the age of 40, specifically adolescents 
and young adults (AYA). Then we used propensity score matching to confirm the 
reproducibility of observed differences and to identify associated factors 
within the AYA age group.
RESULTS: The occurrence of the head-turning sign was significantly more 
prevalent in the IGE group compared to the non-IGE group (20.4 % vs. 2.2 %; 
P<0.0001) and non-epileptic group (20.4 % vs. 8.3 %; P=0.033). Following the 
matching, the head-turning sign was still evident in IGE relative to non-IGE 
patients (14.6 % vs. 4.5; P=0.004), yielding a 94 % specificity for IGE. IGE 
diagnosis (P<0.0001), myoclonic seizure (P<0.0001), being visited by a parent 
(P=0.017), and comorbidity with headache (P=0.021) were significantly associated 
with the head-turning sign. Multivariate analysis revealed that IGE (odds ratio: 
OR=2.80, P=0.028), attending with a parent (OR=2.92, P=0.029), and comorbidity 
with headache (OR=4.06, P=0.016) were independently associated with the 
head-turning sign.
CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed a substantial association between the interictal 
"head-turning sign" and IGE. This unique sign may reflect a tendency towards 
dependence on others in IGE, and may serve as a promising diagnostic auxiliary 
marker for identifying IGE in the AYA age group.

Scoulerine, an isoquinoline alkaloid derived from the corydalis plant, exhibits 
diverse therapeutic properties against tumors, Alzheimer's disease, and 
inflammation. This research delves into the pharmacological impact and 
underlying mechanism of scoulerine on renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Our findings 
suggest that Scoulerine displays promise as a potential therapeutic agent for 
RCC, demonstrating notable inhibitory effects in both in vivo and in vitro 
models. In addition, scoulerine inhibited the viability of 769-P and 786-O cell 
lines in a time-dependent and dose-dependent manner, and promoted the level of 
apoptosis associated with B-cell lymphoma-2 associated X protein (Bax). 
Moreover, the administration of scoulerine resulted in a significant suppression 
of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Subsequently, 
utilizing bioinformatics and spatial transcriptomic databases, we identified 
solute carrier family 6 Member 3 (SLC6A3) as the most promising target of 
scoulerine. Through experimental validation, we confirmed the functional and 
therapeutic relevance of SLC6A3 in scoulerine-mediated treatment of RCC. The 
results of our study indicate a significant affinity between scoulerine and 
SLC6A3, with competitive inhibition of this interaction leading to a reduction 
in the inhibitory impact of scoulerine on RCC cell viability. In conclusion, our 
findings suggest that scoulerine may induce apoptosis in RCC by targeting SLC6A3 
and inhibiting the activation of the MAPK signaling pathway, thereby positioning 
it as a promising natural compound for potential future RCC treatment.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by massive neuronal loss in the brain. Both cortical glutamatergic 
neurons and basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs) in the AD brain are 
selectively vulnerable. The degeneration and dysfunction of these two subtypes 
of neurons are closely associated with the cognitive decline of AD patients. The 
determination of cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in AD pathogenesis, 
especially in the early stage, will largely facilitate the understanding of this 
disease and the development of proper intervention strategies. However, due to 
the inaccessibility of living neurons in the brains of patients, it remains 
unclear how cortical glutamatergic neurons and BFCNs respond to pathological 
stress in the early stage of AD. In this study, we established in vitro 
differentiation systems that can efficiently differentiate patient-derived iPSCs 
into BFCNs. We found that AD-BFCNs secreted less Aβ peptide than cortical 
glutamatergic neurons did, even though the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio was comparable to 
that of cortical glutamatergic neurons. To further mimic the neurotoxic niche in 
AD brain, we treated iPSC-derived neurons with Aβ42 oligomer (AβO). BFCNs are 
less sensitive to AβO induced tau phosphorylation and expression than cortical 
glutamatergic neurons. However, AβO could trigger apoptosis in both AD-cortical 
glutamatergic neurons and AD-BFCNs. In addition, AD iPSC-derived BFCNs and 
cortical glutamatergic neurons exhibited distinct electrophysiological firing 
patterns and elicited different responses to AβO treatment. These observations 
revealed that subtype-specific neurons display distinct neuropathological 
changes during the progression of AD, which might help to understand AD 
pathogenesis at the cellular level.

INTRODUCTION: We evaluated impaired odor identification and global cognition as 
simple, cost-effective alternatives to neuroimaging biomarkers to predict 
cognitive decline and dementia in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging.
METHODS: Six hundred forty-seven participants (mean 8.1, standard deviation 3.4 
years' follow-up) had the following baseline procedures: modified Blessed 
Information Memory Concentration Test (BIMCT), 12-item Brief Smell 
Identification Test (BSIT), structural brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 
and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with 11C-Pittsburgh compound B 
(11C-PiB) and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG; subset).
RESULTS: Cognitive decline developed in 102 participants and dementia in 34 
participants. In survival analyses, PiB PET showed robust prediction for 
cognitive decline. Impaired BSIT, impaired BIMCT, MRI, and FDG measures were 
also significant predictors. The combination of demographics + BSIT + BIMCT 
showed strong predictive utility (C-index 0.81), similar to demographics + PiB 
PET (C-index 0.80). Similar but stronger results were obtained for prediction of 
dementia.
DISCUSSION: Impairment in both odor identification test and global cognition was 
comparable to PiB PET for predicting cognitive decline and dementia.
HIGHLIGHTS: In 647 participants in the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of 
Aging, several clinical markers and biomarkers each predicted cognitive decline 
or dementia during an average 8 years of follow-up. The combination of the 
demographic variables of age, sex, and education with a brief odor 
identification test (BSIT) and a global cognitive test (Blessed Information 
Memory Concentration Test) showed strong predictive utility (C-index 0.81) for 
cognitive decline that was similar to the demographic variables combined with 
Pittsburgh Compound B amyloid imaging (C-index 0.80). Combining a brief odor 
identification test with a brief cognitive test needs consideration as a simple, 
cost-effective option in the clinical assessment of individuals at risk of 
cognitive decline and dementia, as well as a potential tool to identify 
individuals who may benefit from disease-modifying treatments and to screen 
participants for prevention trials.

INTRODUCTION: Identifying people at high risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
dementia allows for timely intervention, which, if successful, will result in 
preventing or delaying the onset of the disease.
METHODS: Utilizing data from the Chicago Health and Aging Project (CHAP; 
n = 2130), we externally evaluated four risk-prediction models for AD dementia, 
including Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Dementia (CAIDE), Australian 
National University Alzheimer's Disease Risk Index (ANU-ADRI), Brief Dementia 
Screening Indicator (BDSI), and Dementia Risk Score (DRS), in Black or African 
American and White adults.
RESULTS: BDSI had the highest discriminate abilities for AD dementia 
(c-statistics of 0.79 in Black and 0.77 in White adults), followed by ANU-ADRI, 
within the age range and follow-up period of the original development cohort. 
CAIDE had the lowest discriminating power (c-statistic ≤0.55). With increasing 
follow-up periods (i.e., 10-15 years), the discrimination abilities for all 
models declined.
DISCUSSION: Because of racial disparities in AD dementia and longer preclinical 
and prodromal stages of disease development, race-specific models are needed to 
predict AD risk over 10 years.
HIGHLIGHTS: Utilizing risk-prediction models to identify individuals at higher 
risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia could benefit clinicians, patients, 
and policymakers. Clinicians could enroll high-risk individuals in clinical 
trials to test new risk-modifiable treatments or initiate lifestyle 
modifications, which, if successful, would slow cognitive decline and delay the 
onset of the disease. Current risk-prediction models had good discriminative 
power during the first 6 years of follow-up but decreased with longer follow-up 
time. Acknowledging the longer preclinical phase of AD dementia development and 
racial differences in dementia risk, there is a need to develop race-specific 
risk-prediction models that can predict 10 or 20 years of risk for AD and 
related dementias.

INTRODUCTION: Blood tests have the potential to improve the accuracy of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical diagnosis, which will enable greater access to 
AD-specific treatments. This study compared leading commercial blood tests for 
amyloid pathology and other AD-related outcomes.
METHODS: Plasma samples from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
were assayed with AD blood tests from C2N Diagnostics, Fujirebio Diagnostics, 
ALZPath, Janssen, Roche Diagnostics, and Quanterix. Outcomes measures were 
amyloid positron emission tomography (PET), tau PET, cortical thickness, and 
dementia severity. Logistic regression models assessed the classification 
accuracies of individual or combined plasma biomarkers for binarized outcomes, 
and Spearman correlations evaluated continuous relationships between individual 
plasma biomarkers and continuous outcomes.
RESULTS: Measures of plasma p-tau217, either individually or in combination with 
other plasma biomarkers, had the strongest relationships with all AD outcomes.
DISCUSSION: This study identified the plasma biomarker analytes and assays that 
most accurately classified amyloid pathology and other AD-related outcomes.
HIGHLIGHTS: Plasma p-tau217 measures most accurately classified amyloid and tau 
status. Plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 had relatively low accuracy in classification of 
amyloid status. Plasma p-tau217 measures had higher correlations with cortical 
thickness than NfL. Correlations of plasma biomarkers with dementia symptoms 
were relatively low.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD), as the most common neurodegenerative disease 
worldwide, severely impairs patients' cognitive functions. Although its exact 
etiology remains unclear, the abnormal aggregations of misfolded β-amyloid 
peptide and tau protein are considered pivotal in its pathological progression. 
Recent studies identify ubiquitin-specific protease 11 (USP11) as the key 
regulator of tau deubiquitination, exacerbating tau aggregation and AD 
pathology. Thereby, inhibiting USP11 function, via either blocking USP11 
activity or lowering USP11 protein level, may serve as an effective therapeutic 
strategy against AD. Our research introduces IsoLiPro, a unique lithium 
isobutyrate-L-proline coordination compound, effectively lowers USP11 protein 
level and enhances tau ubiquitination in vitro. Additionally, long-term oral 
administration of IsoLiPro dramatically reduces total and phosphorylated tau 
levels in AD transgenic mice. Moreover, IsoLiPro also significantly lessens 
β-amyloid deposition and synaptic damage, improving cognitive functions in these 
animal models. These results indicate that IsoLiPro, as a novel small-molecule 
USP11 inhibitor, can effectively alleviate AD-like pathologies and improve 
cognitive functions, offering promise as a potential multi-targeting therapeutic 
agent against AD.

This population-based retrospective cohort study using the Korean National 
Health Insurance Service database included a total of 1,865,827 older adult 
patients aged 60 years or older with common musculoskeletal pain between January 
1, 2003, and December 31, 2007. Individuals who were newly dispensed tramadol 
(N = 41,963) were identified and propensity score-matched with those who were 
not (N = 41,963). Over a maximum of 14-year follow-up, the incidence rates 
(events per 1000 person-years) of all-cause dementia were 6.1 for nonusers, 6.2 
for those with cumulative tramadol use of 1-14 days, 7.7 for those with 
15-90 days of use, and 8.0 for those with > 90 days of use. Longer cumulative 
duration of tramadol use was associated with an increased risk of all-cause 
dementia compared with nonuse (1 to 14 days: aHR 1.06, 95% CI 0.96-1.17; 15 to 
90 days: aHR 1.14, 95% CI 1.10-1.35; and more than 90 days: aHR 1.18, 95% CI 
1.00-1.39; test for trend: P < 0.001). The results showed a similar pattern for 
Alzheimer's disease and were robust across subgroup and sensitivity analyses, 
but not for vascular dementia. This study found that exposure to tramadol was 
associated with an increased risk of dementia. Taking this potential risk into 
consideration, clinicians should carefully weigh potential benefits and risks 
when prescribing tramadol to older adults with musculoskeletal pain.

One key limitation in developing effective treatments for neurodegenerative 
diseases is the lack of models accurately mimicking the complex physiopathology 
of the human disease. Humans accumulate with age the pigment neuromelanin inside 
neurons that synthesize catecholamines. Neurons reaching the highest 
neuromelanin levels preferentially degenerate in Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and 
apparently healthy aging individuals. However, this brain pigment is not taken 
into consideration in current animal models because common laboratory species, 
such as rodents, do not produce neuromelanin. Here we generate a tissue-specific 
transgenic mouse, termed tgNM, that mimics the human age-dependent brain-wide 
distribution of neuromelanin within catecholaminergic regions, based on the 
constitutive catecholamine-specific expression of human melanin-producing enzyme 
tyrosinase. We show that, in parallel to progressive human-like neuromelanin 
pigmentation, these animals display age-related neuronal dysfunction and 
degeneration affecting numerous brain circuits and body tissues, linked to motor 
and non-motor deficits, reminiscent of early neurodegenerative stages. This 
model could help explore new research avenues in brain aging and 
neurodegeneration.

BACKGROUND: The accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide in the brain is a 
hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), occurring years before symptom onset. 
Current methods for quantifying in vivo amyloid load involve invasive or costly 
procedures, limiting accessibility. Early detection of amyloid positivity in 
non-demented individuals is crucial for aiding early AD diagnosis and for 
initiating anti-amyloid immunotherapies at early stages. This study aimed to 
develop and validate predictive models to identify brain amyloid positivity in 
non-demented patients, using routinely collected clinical data.
METHODS: Predictive models for amyloid positivity were developed using data from 
853 non-demented participants in the MEMENTO cohort. Amyloid levels were 
measured potentially repeatedly during study course through Positron Emision 
Tomography or CerebroSpinal Fluid analysis. The probability of amyloid 
positivity was modelled using mixed-effects logistic regression. Predictors 
included demographic information, cognitive assessments, visual brain MRI 
evaluations of hippocampal atrophy and lobar microbleeds, AD-related blood 
biomarkers (Aβ42/40 and P-tau181), and ApoE4 status. Models were subjected to 
internal cross-validation and external validation using data from the Amsterdam 
Dementia Cohort. Performance also was evaluated in a subsample that met the main 
criteria of the Appropriate Use Recommendations (AUR) for lecanemab.
RESULTS: The most effective model incorporated demographic data, cognitive 
assessments, ApoE status, and AD-related blood biomarkers, achieving AUCs of 
0.82 [95%CI 0.81-0.82] in MEMENTO sample and 0.90 [95%CI 0.86-0.94] in the 
external validation sample. This model significantly outperformed a reference 
model based solely on demographic and cognitive data, with an AUC difference in 
MEMENTO of 0.10 [95%CI 0.10-0.11]. A similar model without ApoE genotype 
achieved comparable discriminatory performance. MRI markers did not improve 
model performance. Performances in AUR of lecanemab subsample were comparable.
CONCLUSION: A predictive model integrating demographic, cognitive, and blood 
biomarker data offers a promising method to help identify amyloid status in 
non-demented patients. ApoE genotype and brain MRI data were not necessary for 
strong discriminatory ability, suggesting that ApoE genotyping may be deferred 
when assessing the risk-benefit ratio of immunotherapies in amyloid-positive 
patients who desire treatment. The integration of this model into clinical 
practice could reduce the need for lumbar puncture or PET examinations to 
confirm amyloid status.

Extensive studies indicate that mitochondria dysfunction is pivotal for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis; while cumulative evidence suggests that 
increased mitochondrial stress response (MSR) may mitigate neurodegeneration in 
AD, explorations to develop a MSR-targeted therapeutic strategy against AD are 
scarce. We combined cell biology, molecular biology, and pharmacological 
approaches to unravel a novel molecular pathway by which NAD+-boosting agent 
nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) regulates MSR in AD models. Here, we report 
dyshomeostasis plasma UPRmt-mitophagy-mediated MSR profiles in AD patient 
samples. NMN restores NAD+ metabolic profiles and improves MSR through the 
ATF4-dependent UPRmt pathway in AD-related cross-species models. At the 
organismal level, NAD+ repletion with NMN supplementation ameliorates 
mitochondrial proteotoxicity, decreases hippocampal synaptic disruption, 
decreases neuronal loss, and brain atrophy in mice model of AD. Remarkably, 
omics features of the hippocampus with NMN show that NMN leads to 
transcriptional changes of genes and proteins involved in MSR characteristics, 
principally within the astrocyte unit rather than microglia and 
oligodendrocytes. In brief, our work provides evidence that MSR has an active 
role in the pathogenesis of AD, as reducing mitochondrial homeostasis via atf4 
depletion in AD mice aggravates the hallmarks of the disease; conversely, 
bolstering mitochondrial proteostasis by NMN decreases protein aggregation, 
restores memory performance, and delays disease progression, ultimately 
translating to increased healthspan.

Aβ accumulation in the blood-brain barrier (BBB) endothelium, which lines the 
cerebrovascular lumen, is a significant contributor to cerebrovascular 
dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL) 
levels are associated with increased AD risk, and the HDL mimetic peptide 4F has 
been developed as a promising therapeutic agent to improve cerebrovascular 
health in AD. In this study, we evaluated the impact of 4F on 125I-Aβ42 
blood-to-brain distribution using dynamic SPECT/CT imaging in both wild-type and 
APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Graphical analysis of the imaging data demonstrated 
that 4F significantly reduced the blood-to-brain influx rate in wild-type mice 
and the distribution of 125I-Aβ42 in the BBB endothelium in APP/PS1 mice. To 
elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the effect of 4F, we evaluated its 
impact on the p38 pathway and its role in mediating Aβ42 trafficking in human 
BBB endothelial cell monolayers. Treatment with 4F significantly decreased Aβ42 
induced p38 activation in BBB endothelial cells. Furthermore, inhibition of p38 
kinase significantly reduced endothelial accumulation of fluorescence-labeled 
Aβ42 and luminal-to-abluminal permeability across the cell monolayer. While our 
previous publication has hinted at the potential of 4F to reduce Aβ accumulation 
in the brain parenchyma, the current findings demonstrated the protective effect 
of 4F in reducing Aβ42 accumulation in the BBB endothelium of AD transgenic 
mice. These findings revealed the impact of a clinically tested agent, the HDL 
mimetic peptide 4F, on Aβ exposure to the BBB endothelium and offer novel 
mechanistic insights into potential therapeutic strategies to treat 
cerebrovascular dysfunction in AD.

Mirodenafil is a phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitor with high specificity for 
its target and good blood-brain barrier permeability. The drug, which is 
currently used for treatment of erectile dysfunction, reduces Aβ and pTau levels 
and improves cognitive function in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease. In the 
present study, we investigated the effect of mirodenafil in the transient and 
permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO and pMCAO) models of stroke in 
rats. Starting 24 ​h after cerebral artery occlusion, mirodenafil was 
administered subcutaneously at doses of 0.5, 1, and 2 ​mg/kg per day for 9 days 
in the tMCAO model and for 28 days in the pMCAO model. Mirodenafil significantly 
increased sensorimotor and cognitive recovery of tMCAO and pMCAO rats compared 
to saline control rats, and significantly decreased the amount of degenerative 
cells and cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP immunoreactive cells. Effects were 
seen in a dose-dependent manner up to 1 ​mg/kg mirodenafil. The benefits of 
mirodenafil treatment increased with longer treatment duration, and the largest 
improvements over control were typically observed on the last assessment day. 
There was no effect of mirodenafil on infarct volume in both tMCAO and pMCAO 
rats. In an experiment to determine the treatment window for mirodenafil 
effects, a protective effect was observed when treatment was delayed 72 ​h after 
MCAO, although the most improvement was observed with shorter treatment windows. 
Using pMCAO and tMCAO rat models of stroke, we determined that mirodenafil 
improves the recovery of sensorimotor and cognitive functions after MCAO and 
protects cortical cells from apoptosis and degeneration. Greater benefit was 
observed with longer duration of treatment, and improvement was seen even when 
treatment was delayed.

Neurovascular coupling plays an important role in the progression of Alzheimer's 
disease. However, it is unclear how ultrasound stimulation modulates 
neurovascular coupling in Alzheimer's disease. Here, we found that (i) 
transcranial ultrasound stimulation modulates the time domain and frequency 
domain characteristics of cerebral blood oxygen metabolism in Alzheimer's 
disease mice; (ii) transcranial ultrasound stimulation can significantly 
modulate the relative power of theta and gamma frequency of local field 
potential in Alzheimer's disease mice; and (iii) transcranial ultrasound 
stimulation can significantly modulate the neurovascular coupling in time domain 
and frequency domain induced by forepaw electrical stimulation in Alzheimer's 
disease mice. It provides a research basis for the clinical application of 
transcranial ultrasound stimulation in Alzheimer's disease patients.

Preventing β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide aggregation by Au nanoparticles (NPs) is a 
promising strategy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. However, 
construction of Au nanostructures with easy preparation and high therapeutic 
efficiency is still a challenge. Herein, one-step pulsed laser ablation in water 
is used to fabricate epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) modified Au (Au-EGCG) NPs 
with uniform size. The as-obtained Au-EGCG NPs can effectively inhibit β-amyloid 
(1-42) peptide (Aβ42) aggregation by the interaction with peptides, which is 
confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), fluorescence spectroscopy 
(thioflavin T (ThT), tyrosine and 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (ANS) 
assays), and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Besides, they can 
also effectively attenuate Aβ42-induced cytotoxicity based on the cell viability 
experiments. This work provides a facile approach to synthesize the 
surface-functionalized Au NPs for enhanced inhibition of Aβ aggregation and 
amelioration of Aβ-induced cytotoxicity.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), classified as neurodegenerative disorder that 
progresses over a period of time, is characterized by intracellular 
neurofibrillary tangles and extracellular amyloid plaques. This present research 
work was designed to develop a polyherbal gel for the treatment of AD. This 
research study is aimed to confirm the impact and validation of polyherbal gel 
on tauopathy and neurodegeneration that had been induced by intraperitoneal 
trimethyltin (TMT) injection to rats. Polyherbal loaded gel was prepared by cold 
method, and characterized for gel strength, viscosity, permeation and pH. 
Subsequently, 5 marker based standardized plant materials of Kalyanka ghrita 
were incorporated in gellan gum and xanthan gum. Finally, an in-vivo 
investigation employing rats with TMT-induced neurological disease were used to 
assess the efficacy of the optimized gel. On day 7, the Wistar rats received 
intraperitoneal injections of TMT. From day 14 to day 35, the corresponding 
groups received intranasal administration of polyherbal gel. In addition to the 
molecular parameters such as brain acetyl cholinesterase activity, BDNF (Rat 
brain derived neurotropic factor), protein phosphatase 2 A, antioxidant 
parameters, and oxidative stress markers, the behavioral parameters were also 
determined. Studies were conducted on the brain's monoamine levels and 
histology. RESULTS: Higher permeation over the nasal mucosa was demonstrated by 
the optimized In-situ polyherbal gel. Significant improvement in cognition was 
observed from the reduced escape latency, longer paths, and increased social or 
novel object recognition tests post polyherbal gel treatment. A documented HPLC 
technique helped in optimization and standardization of the polyherbal gel. The 
polyherbal treatment groups exhibited a considerable rise in the levels of 
monoamines, including norepinephrine, dopamine, and 5-hydroxy tryptamine. 
CONCLUSION: According to the current study, treating Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
with a polyherbal gel formulation may be a viable option for successful therapy.

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a neurodegenerative disease spectrum with an 
urgent need for reliable biomarkers for early diagnosis and monitoring. Speech 
and language changes occur in the early stages of FTD and offer a potential 
non-invasive, early, and accessible diagnostic tool. The use of speech and 
language markers in this disease spectrum is limited by the fact that most 
studies investigate English-speaking patients. This systematic review examines 
the literature on psychoacoustic and linguistic features of speech that occur 
across the FTD spectrum across as many different languages as possible. 76 
papers were identified that investigate psychoacoustic and linguistic markers in 
discursive speech. 75 % of these papers studied English-speaking patients. The 
most generalizable features found across different languages, are speech rate, 
articulation rate, pause frequency, total pause duration, noun-verb ratio, and 
total number of nouns. While there are clear interlinguistic differences across 
patient groups, the results show promise for implementation of cross-linguistic 
markers of speech and language across the FTD spectrum particularly for 
psychoacoustic features.

Inhibition of CDK4/6 kinases has led to improved outcomes in breast cancer. 
Nevertheless, only a minority of patients experience long-term disease control. 
Using a large, clinically annotated cohort of patients with metastatic hormone 
receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer, we identify TP53 loss (27.6%) and MDM2 
amplification (6.4%) to be associated with lack of long-term disease control. 
Human breast cancer models reveal that p53 loss does not alter CDK4/6 activity 
or G1 blockade but instead promotes drug-insensitive p130 phosphorylation by 
CDK2. The persistence of phospho-p130 prevents DREAM complex assembly, enabling 
cell-cycle re-entry and tumor progression. Inhibitors of CDK2 can overcome p53 
loss, leading to geroconversion and manifestation of senescence phenotypes. 
Complete inhibition of both CDK4/6 and CDK2 kinases appears to be necessary to 
facilitate long-term response across genomically diverse HR+ breast cancers.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Although neurodegenerative diseases are a leading 
cause of death, little is known about health care utilization and cost during 
the end-of-life (EoL) period or how it compares with that of other life-limiting 
conditions. We aimed to describe and compare resource utilization among US 
Medicare decedents with neurodegenerative diseases with decedents with cancer.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of Medicare Part A and B 
beneficiaries with Alzheimer disease (AD), Parkinson disease (PD), or 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) who died in 2018. Decedents diagnosed with 
malignant brain tumors or pancreatic cancer served as non-neurodegenerative 
comparators. Descriptive analyses examined demographic and clinical 
characteristics in the last year of life. The probabilities and associated costs 
of emergency department (ED), inpatient, skilled nursing facility (SNF), and 
hospice utilization during the last 12 and 6 months of life were also compared 
between persons with neurodegenerative diseases and cancer, adjusting for 
sociodemographic factors and comorbidity burden.
RESULTS: A total of 1,126,799 Medicare beneficiaries died in 2018, of which 
357,926 had a qualifying diagnosis. Persons with neurodegenerative diseases were 
older and more frequently received Medicaid assistance than persons with brain 
or pancreatic cancer. In all groups, health care service utilization increased 
over the last year of life, and total costs were predominantly attributable to 
inpatient care. In the last 6 months of life, neurologist care was infrequent 
among patients with neurodegenerative disease (AD: 1.5%; PD: 8.6%; ALS: 32.0%). 
Persons with neurodegenerative diseases as compared to persons with malignant 
brain tumors also had greater odds of ED use (AD: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 
1.17, 95% CI 1.11-1.23; PD: aOR 1.18, 95% CI 1.11-1.25; ALS: aOR 1.11, 95% CI 
1.01-1.23), lower odds of hospitalization (AD: aOR 0.64, 95% CI 0.60-0.68; PD: 
aOR 0.65, 95% CI 0.61-0.69; ALS: aOR 0.33, 95% CI 0.30-0.37), and lower odds of 
hospice enrollment (AD: aOR 0.33, 95% CI 0.31-0.36; PD: aOR 0.33, 95% CI 
0.31-0.36; ALS: aOR 0.41, 95% CI 0.36-0.46). The findings were similar in 
pancreatic cancer.
DISCUSSION: Persons with neurodegenerative diseases in the United States are 
more likely to visit the ED and less likely to use inpatient and hospice 
services at EoL than persons with brain or pancreatic cancer. These group 
differences may stem from prognostic uncertainty and reflect inadequate EoL care 
practices, requiring further investigation to ensure more timely palliative care 
and hospice referrals.

This article used network pharmacology, molecular docking, GEO analysis, and 
Gene Set Enrichment Analysis to obtain 38 main chemical components and 66 
corresponding targets involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment in 
"Cistanche deserticola-Polygala". Through further Gene Ontology and Kyoto 
Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis, we obtained AD 
signalling pathways, calcium signalling pathways, and other signalling pathways 
related to the treatment of AD with "Cistanche deserticola-Polygala". Molecular 
docking showed that most of the core chemical components had good binding 
ability with the core targets. This article aims to reveal the mechanism of 
"Cistanche deserticola-Polygala" in treating AD and provide a basis for the 
treatment of AD with "Cistanche deserticola-Polygala".

BACKGROUND: Stress related to Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRD) is 
common, particularly among those who care for persons with challenging behaviors 
and personality or mood changes. Mindfulness and self-compassion programs are 
efficacious for managing stress. The skills of mindfulness and self-compassion, 
however, must be integrated with behavioral management skills in order to 
effectively improve caregiver stress.
OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to describe the development of the Mindful 
and Self-Compassionate Care (MASC) program, the first program that combines 
mindfulness and self-compassion with behavioral management skills to decrease 
caregiver stress, and its evaluation in the Supporting Our Caregivers in ADRD 
Learning (SOCIAL) study.
METHODS: Using the National Institutes of Health (NIH) stage model, we describe 
3 phases of work encompassing NIH Stages 1A and 1B. In phase 1, we conducted 5 
focus groups (N=28) of stressed individuals caring for persons with ADRD and 
challenging behaviors. Rapid data analysis informed the development of a 6-week 
online intervention. Phase 2 (NIH stage 1A) includes an open pilot (N>10) with 
optional exit interviews. Phase 3 (NIH stage 1B) is a feasibility randomized 
controlled trial of the intervention versus the Health Education Program 
control. Primary outcomes focus on feasibility with secondary outcomes 
encompassing acceptability, credibility, fidelity, and signals of preliminary 
efficacy. Phase 1 follows traditional recommendations for qualitative analyses 
(at the point of thematic saturation) which was achieved after 5 focus groups 
(N=28). For the phase 2 open pilot, up to 12 participants will be recruited. For 
the phase 3 feasibility study, recruitment of 80 caregivers will allow the 
assessment of feasibility benchmarks. Data for phase 1 included 5 focus groups. 
In phases 2 and 3, data collection will occur through REDCap (Research 
Electronic Data Capture; Vanderbilt University) surveys and an optional 
qualitative exit interview. Analyses will include hybrid inductive-deductive 
analyses for qualitative data and assessment of changes in our intervention 
targets and outcomes using t tests and correlation analyses.
RESULTS: In phase 1, caregivers reported interest in a brief, online stress 
management program. Participants held misconceptions about mindfulness and 
self-compassion, but after detailed explanation thoughts, these skills could be 
helpful when directly linked to implementation during caregiving routines. 
Phases 2 and 3 will be completed by the end of 2025.
CONCLUSIONS: We describe the protocol for the Supporting Our Caregivers in ADRD 
Learning study, as well as the development and feasibility testing of the 
Mindful and Self-Compassionate Care intervention. Future work will include a 
fully powered efficacy-effectiveness randomized controlled trial.

BACKGROUND: Older adults with dementia who are on polypharmacy are more 
vulnerable to the use of potentially inappropriate medications (PIM), which can 
significantly increase the risk of adverse events and drug-related problems 
(DRPs).
OBJECTIVE: This systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to map the 
prevalence of PIM use, polypharmacy, and hyper-polypharmacy among older adults 
with cognitive impairment or dementia attending memory clinics.
METHODS: Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, Scopus, Cochrane Library, EBSCOhost CINAHL, 
and Ovid International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (IPA) were systematically 
searched from inception to April 22, 2024. Observational studies assessing the 
PIMs use among older adults with CI or dementia were screened. A random- effects 
meta-analysis was conducted to pool the prevalence estimates.
RESULTS: Of 5,787 identified citations, 11 studies including 4,571 participants 
from 8 countries were included. Among all the included studies the pooled 
prevalence of PIM use was 38% (95% confidence interval (CIn): 27- 50%), 
highlighting a notable range from 20% to 78%. The analysis identified 
anticholinergics, benzodiazepines, and non-benzodiazepine sedatives as the most 
common PIMs. Subgroup analysis revealed a higher pooled prevalence of PIM in the 
USA (39%; 95% CIn: 10- 78, I2 (%) = 98, 3 studies) and Australia (36%, 95% CIn: 
12- 70, I2 (%) = 96, 2 Studies). Additionally, pooled prevalence of polypharmacy 
and hyper-polypharmacy was reported as (60%; 95% CIn: 46- 73, I2 (%) = 95, 3 
studies), and (The prevalence of hyper-polypharmacy was 17.6%; 1 study) 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The definition of PIMs significantly impacts study results, often 
more than geographical variations. The variability in criteria and tools like 
the Beers or Screening Tool of Older Persons' Prescriptions (STOPP) criteria 
across studies and regions leads to differing prevalence rates.

Depression is a modifiable risk factor for dementia; however, it remains unclear 
whether there are sex differences in how depression affects dementia risk. To 
better understand sex-specific differences in how depression confers risk of 
dementia, the link between depression, hippocampal volumes, and cognition was 
evaluated in a sample of older adults without dementia from the UK Biobank 
cohort. A total of 18,220 participants (women n = 9,474; men n = 8,746) were 
selected based on completion of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), 
structural MRI, and cognitive assessments. Causal mediation analyses were used 
to evaluate if the relationship between depression and cognition is mediated by 
the hippocampus differently by sex. Women reported greater depression severity 
than men. Hippocampal volumes were found to mediate the relationship between 
depression severity and fluid intelligence only in women. Upon categorization of 
the depression symptoms as either cognitive/affective or somatic, the mediation 
effect of the hippocampus was seen for both cognitive/affective and somatic 
symptom severity in women for fluid intelligence. These results offer insight 
into the sex-specific pathways underlying the relationship between depression, 
hippocampal volumes, and cognition in older adults without dementia with a focus 
on the type of depression symptoms. This knowledge could aid in the development 
of sex-focused dementia prevention strategies and treatments.

Alzheimer's Disease: Exploring the Landscape of Cognitive Decline.

States.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by cognitive decline, memory loss, and impaired daily functioning. 
The pathology of AD is marked by the accumulation of amyloid beta plaques and 
tau protein tangles in the brain, along with neuroinflammation and synaptic 
dysfunction. Genetic factors, such as mutations in APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 genes, 
as well as the APOE ε4 allele, contribute to increased risk of acquiring AD. 
Currently available treatments provide symptomatic relief but do not halt 
disease progression. Research efforts are focused on developing 
disease-modifying therapies that target the underlying pathological mechanisms 
of AD. Advances in identification and validation of reliable biomarkers for AD 
hold great promise for enhancing early diagnosis, monitoring disease 
progression, and assessing treatment response in clinical practice in effort to 
alleviate the burden of this devastating disease. In this paper, we analyze data 
from the CAS Content Collection to summarize the research progress in 
Alzheimer's disease. We examine the publication landscape in effort to provide 
insights into current knowledge advances and developments. We also review the 
most discussed and emerging concepts and assess the strategies to combat the 
disease. We explore the genetic risk factors, pharmacological targets, and 
comorbid diseases. Finally, we inspect clinical applications of products against 
AD with their development pipelines and efforts for drug repurposing. The 
objective of this review is to provide a broad overview of the evolving 
landscape of current knowledge regarding AD, to outline challenges, and to 
evaluate growth opportunities to further efforts in combating the disease.

MOTIVATION: Target discovery is a crucial step in drug development, as it 
directly affects the success rate of clinical trials. Knowledge graphs (KGs) 
offer unique advantages in processing complex biological data and inferring new 
relationships. Existing biomedical KGs primarily focus on tasks such as drug 
repositioning and drug-target interactions, leaving a gap in the construction of 
KGs tailored for target discovery.
RESULTS: We established a comprehensive biomedical KG focusing on target 
discovery, termed TarKG, by integrating seven existing biomedical KGs, nine 
public databases, and traditional Chinese medicine knowledge databases. TarKG 
consists of 1 143 313 entities and 32 806 467 relations across 15 entity 
categories and 171 relation types, all centered around 3 core entity types: 
Disease, Gene, and Compound. TarKG provides specialized knowledges for the core 
entities including chemical structures, protein sequences, or text descriptions. 
By using different KG embedding algorithms, we assessed the knowledge completion 
capabilities of TarKG, particularly for disease-target link prediction. In case 
studies, we further examined TarKG's ability to predict potential protein 
targets for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to identify diseases potentially 
associated with the metallo-deubiquitinase CSN5, using literature analysis for 
validation. Furthermore, we provided a user-friendly web server 
(https://tarkg.ddtmlab.org) that enables users to perform knowledge retrieval 
and relation inference using TarKG.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: TarKG is accessible at 
https://tarkg.ddtmlab.org.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common chronic neurodegenerative 
disease in older people, and there is no specific treatment that can stop or 
reverse its progression. Neobavaisoflavone (NBIF) is a flavonoid that has been 
shown to have neuroprotective effects, but its role in AD has not been revealed. 
The present study investigated the role and mechanism of NBIF on Aβ25-35-induced 
brain injury.
METHODS: In this experiment, the AD mouse model was established by injection of 
Aβ25-35 peptides (200 μM, icv), and Donepezil (Don, 10 mg/kg/days), NBIF-L 
(15 mg/kg/days), and NBIF-H (30 mg/kg/days) were administered orally for 
4 weeks. Learning memory, hippocampal pathological changes, pathological 
markers, apoptosis, oxidative stress, inflammation, immune cells were measured 
in mice. Network pharmacology combined with the GEO database led to the 
identification of SIRT1, a key target for NBIF intervention in AD, and levels of 
SIRT1, p-STAT3 and FOXO1 were measured. In addition, the antagonistic activity 
of SIRT1 transfection silencing against NBIF in Aβ25-35-induced in N9 cells and 
N2a-APP69 cells was investigated to assess whether the effects caused by NBIF 
were mediated by SIRT1.
RESULTS: The results showed that NBIF ameliorated learning memory and 
hippocampal neuronal damage, reduced pathological markers, apoptosis, oxidative 
stress and neuroinflammation, and modulated immune cells. SIRT1 is a key target 
for NBIF intervention in AD, and NBIF upregulates SIRT1 and reduces the 
expression levels of p-STAT3 and FOXO1. Furthermore, silencing SIRT1 effectively 
reduced the protective effect of NBIF on Aβ25-35-induced N9 cells and N2a-APP69 
cells, which indicated that the protective effect of NBIF on AD is related to 
SIRT1.
CONCLUSIONS: NBIF ameliorated Aβ25-35-induced brain injury by inhibiting 
apoptosis, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation, which may be mediated 
through SIRT1 signaling. These findings provide a rationale for NBIF in the 
treatment of AD and help facilitate the development of clinical therapeutic 
agents for AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex degenerative disease of the central 
nervous system, and elucidating its pathogenesis remains challenging. In this 
study, we used the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) model as the major analysis 
method to perform hypothesis-free Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis on the 
data from MRC IEU OpenGWAS (18,097 exposure traits and 16 AD outcome traits), 
and conducted sensitivity analysis with six models, to assess the robustness of 
the IVW results, to identify various classes of risk or protective factors for 
AD, early-onset AD, and late-onset AD. We generated 400,274 data entries in 
total, among which the major analysis method of the IVW model consists of 73,129 
records with 4840 exposure traits, which fall into 10 categories: Disease, 
Medical laboratory science, Imaging, Anthropometric, Treatment, Molecular trait, 
Gut microbiota, Past history, Family history, and Lifestyle trait. More 
importantly, a freely accessed online platform called MRAD 
(https://gwasmrad.com/mrad/) has been developed using the Shiny package with MR 
analysis results. Additionally, novel potential AD therapeutic targets (CD33, 
TBCA, VPS29, GNAI3, PSME1) are identified, among which CD33 was positively 
associated with the main outcome traits of AD, as well as with both EOAD and 
LOAD. TBCA and VPS29 were negatively associated with the main outcome traits of 
AD, as well as with both EOAD and LOAD. GNAI3 and PSME1 were negatively 
associated with the main outcome traits of AD, as well as with LOAD, but had no 
significant causal association with EOAD. The findings of our research advance 
our understanding of the etiology of AD.

INTRODUCTION: Recent technological advances have increased the risk that 
de-identified brain images could be re-identified from face imagery. The 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is a leading source of 
publicly available de-identified brain imaging, who quickly acted to protect 
participants' privacy.
METHODS: An independent expert committee evaluated 11 face-deidentification 
("de-facing") methods and selected four for formal testing.
RESULTS: Effects of de-facing on brain measurements were comparable across 
methods and sufficiently small to recommend de-facing in ADNI. The committee 
ultimately recommended mri_reface for advantages in reliability, and for some 
practical considerations. ADNI leadership approved the committee's 
recommendation, beginning in ADNI4.
DISCUSSION: ADNI4 de-faces all applicable brain images before subsequent 
pre-processing, analyses, and public release. Trained analysts inspect de-faced 
images to confirm complete face removal and complete non-modification of brain. 
This paper details the history of the algorithm selection process and extensive 
validation, then describes the production workflows for de-facing in ADNI.
HIGHLIGHTS: ADNI is implementing "de-facing" of MRI and PET beginning in ADNI4. 
"De-facing" alters face imagery in brain images to help protect privacy. Four 
algorithms were extensively compared for ADNI and mri_reface was chosen. 
Validation confirms mri_reface is robust and effective for ADNI sequences. 
Validation confirms mri_reface negligibly affects ADNI brain measurements.

INTRODUCTION: Understanding the relationship between amyloid beta (Aβ) positron 
emission tomography (PET) and Aβ cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers will 
define their potential utility in Aβ treatment. Few population-based or 
neuropathologic comparisons have been reported.
METHODS: Participants 50+ years with Aβ PET and Aβ CSF biomarkers 
(phosphorylated tau [p-tau]181/Aβ42, n = 505, and Aβ42/40, n = 54) were included 
from the Mayo Clinic Study on Aging. From these participants, an autopsy 
subgroup was identified (n = 47). The relationships of Aβ PET and Aβ CSF 
biomarkers were assessed cross-sectionally in all participants and 
longitudinally in autopsy data.
RESULTS: Cross-sectionally, more participants were Aβ PET+ versus Aβ CSF- than 
Aβ PET- versus Aβ CSF+ with an incremental effect when using Aβ PET regions 
selected for early Aβ deposition. The sensitivity for the first detection of 
Thal phase ≥ 1 in longitudinal data was higher for Aβ PET (89%) than 
p-tau181/Aβ42 (64%).
DISCUSSION: Aβ PET can detect earlier cortical Aβ deposition than Aβ CSF 
biomarkers. Aβ PET+ versus Aβ CSF- findings are several-fold greater using 
regional Aβ PET analyses and in peri-threshold-standardized uptake value ratio 
participants.
HIGHLIGHTS: Amyloid beta (Aβ) positron emission tomography (PET) has greater 
sensitivity for Aβ deposition than Aβ cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in early Aβ 
development. A population-based sample of participants (n = 505) with PET and 
CSF tests was used. Cortical regions showing early Aβ on Aβ PET were also used 
in these analyses. Neuropathology was used to validate detection of Aβ by Aβ PET 
and Aβ CSF biomarkers.

University of Biological and Applied Sciences, Lahore, Pakistan.

Nanotechnology has significantly impacted drug discovery and development over 
the past three decades, offering novel insights and expanded treatment options. 
Key to this field is nanoparticles, ranging from 1 to 100 nanometres, with 
unique properties distinct from larger materials. Selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) 
are particularly promising due to their low toxicity and selective cytotoxicity 
against cancer cells. They have shown efficacy in reducing various cancers types 
and mitigating conditions like diabetic nephropathy and neurological disorders, 
such as Alzheimer's disease. This review highlights SeNPs' role in enhancing 
drug delivery systems, improving the absorption of water-soluble compounds, 
proteins, peptides, vaccines, and other biological therapies. By modifying 
nanoparticle surfaces with targeting ligands, drug delivery can achieve precise 
site-specific delivery, increasing effectiveness. SeNPs can be synthesised 
through physical, chemical, and biological methods, each offering advantages in 
stability, size, and application potential. Additionally, SeNPs enhance immune 
responses and reduce oxidative stress, validating their role in biotherapy and 
nanomedicine. Their ability to target macrophages and regulate polarisation 
underscores their potential in antimicrobial therapies. Recent advancements, 
such as mannosylated SeNPs for targeted delivery, exemplify innovative 
nanotechnology applications in medicine. Overall, SeNPs represent a promising 
frontier in nanomedicine, offering new avenues for treating and managing various 
diseases.

The abnormal accumulation of β-amyloid protein (Aβ) is considered as the main 
pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The design of potent 
multifunctional theranostic agents targeting Aβ is one of the effective 
strategies for AD prevention and treatment. Nanomotors as intelligent, advanced, 
and multifunctional nanoplatforms can perform many complex tasks, but their 
application in AD theranostics is rare. Herein, sub-10nm multifunctional 
dual-carbon dots composites (ERCD) with photo-propelled nanomotor behavior are 
fabricated by conjugating near-infrared (NIR) carbon dots (RCD) of thermogenic 
and photodynamic capability with the previously reported epigallocatechin 
gallate-derived carbonized polymer dots (ECD). ERCD-1 (ECD:RCD = 1:2.5) showed 
potent inhibitory capability similar to ECD in the absence of NIR light, and 
exhibited photooxygenation activity and nanomotor behavior powered by 
"self-thermophoretic force" under NIR irradiation, significantly enhancing the 
inhibition, disaggregation, and photooxygenation capabilities. The nanomotor 
suppressed Aβ fibrillization and rapidly disaggregated mature Aβ fibrils at very 
low concentrations (0.5 µg mL-1). Moreover, the NIR-activated ERCD-1 imaged Aβ 
plaques in vivo and prolonged nematode lifespan by 6 d at 2 µg mL-1. As a 
proof-of-concept, this work opened a new avenue to the design of multifunctional 
sub-10nm nanomotors targeting Aβ for AD theranostics.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that impairs learning 
and memory, with high rates of mortality. Birch bark has been traditionally used 
in the treatment of various skin ailments. Betulin (BT) is a key compound of 
birch bark that exhibits diverse pharmacological benefits and therapeutic 
potential in AD. However, the therapeutic effects and molecular mechanisms of BT 
in AD remain unclear. The present study aimed to predict the potential 
therapeutic targets of BT in the treatment of AD, and to determine the specific 
underlying molecular mechanisms through network pharmacology analysis and 
experimental validation. PharmMapper was used to predict the target genes of BT, 
and four disease databases were searched to screen for AD targets. The 
intersection targets were identified using the jveen website. Drug‑disease 
target protein‑protein interaction networks and hub genes were obtained and 
visualized using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins 
database and Cytoscape. The Database for Annotation, Visualization and 
Integrated Discovery was used for Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of 
Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses, and AutoDock was used for 
molecular docking analysis of BT and hub genes. Subsequently, the 
network‑predicted mechanisms of BT in AD were verified in vitro. A total of 495 
BT and 1,386 AD targets were identified, and 120 were identified as potential 
targets of BT in the treatment of AD. The results of the molecular docking 
analysis revealed a strong binding affinity between BT and the hub genes. In 
addition, enrichment analyses of GO and KEGG pathways indicated that the 
neuroprotective effects of BT mainly involved the 'PI3K‑Akt signaling pathway'. 
The results of in vitro experiments demonstrated that pretreatment with BT for 2 
h may ameliorate formaldehyde (FA)‑induced cytotoxicity and morphological 
changes in HT22 cells, and decrease FA‑induced Tau hyperphosphorylation and 
reactive oxygen species levels. Furthermore, the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was 
activated and the expression levels of downstream proteins, namely GSK3β, Bcl‑2 
and Bax, were modified following pre‑treatment with BT. Overall, the results of 
network pharmacology and in vitro analyses revealed that BT may reduce 
FA‑induced AD‑like pathology by modulating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, 
highlighting it as a potential multi‑target drug for the treatment of AD.

BACKGROUND: Shenghui Yizhi Decoction (SHYZD) has exhibited the capacity to 
enhance cognitive function and learning abilities in individuals diagnosed with 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) while ameliorating pre-existing neuroinflammation. 
Nevertheless, the precise mechanism underlying its therapeutic effects on AD 
remains to be elucidated.
METHODS: Twenty-four male SAMP8 mice were randomly divided into three groups, 
and eight male SAMR1 mice were used as a blank control, to examine their 
learning and spatial memory abilities. The expression of amyloid β1-42 (Aβ1-42) 
was detected by immunohistochemical staining of hippocampal tissue. ELISA was 
used to detect the interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumour 
necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) expressions. Real time PCR was used to detect NOD-like 
receptor thermal protein domain associated protein 3 (NLRP3), cysteine 
protease-1 (Caspase-1), and IL-1β mRNA expression. Western blot was used to 
detect nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB), inhibitor of NF-κB α (IκBα), IκB kinase α 
(IKKα), NLRP3, Caspase-1, and IL-1β protein expression.
RESULTS: In this study, SAMP8 mice, employed as an AD model, displayed markedly 
diminished abilities in terms of spatial localization, navigation, and spatial 
exploration when compared to the blank control group. Additionally, there was a 
substantial upregulation of Aβ1-42 expression in the hippocampus of these mice, 
along with a significant increase in the levels of inflammation-associated 
factors, including IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, NLRP3, Caspase-1, as well as the NF-κB 
pathway-related proteins, namely, NF-κB, IκBα, and IKKα. Moreover, after 
treatment with positive drugs (donepezil hydrochloride) and SHYZD, the learning 
abilities of the mice exhibited significant improvements. Furthermore, the 
hallmark AD protein Aβ1-42, inflammatory factors, and NF-κB/NLRP3 signalling 
pathway proteins were significantly reduced. These findings collectively suggest 
that SHYZD exerts a therapeutic effect on AD.
CONCLUSION: In summary, the specific molecular mechanisms through which SHYZD 
alleviates AD and the potential role for SHYZD in the NF-κB/NLRP3 signalling 
pathway are identified in this study.

BACKGROUND: Observational studies have shown a controversial relationship 
between dietary fat intake and Alzheimer's disease, and the causal effects are 
unclear.
AIMS: To assess the causal effects of total fat, saturated fat and 
polyunsaturated fat (PUF) intakes on the risk of Alzheimer's disease.
METHOD: A two-sample Mendelian randomisation analysis was performed using 
genome-wide association study summary statistics on different types of fat 
intake from UK Biobank (n = 51 413) and on late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD; 
4282 cases, n = 307 112) and all forms of Alzheimer's disease (6281 cases, n = 
309 154) from the FinnGen consortium. In addition, a multivariable Mendelian 
randomisation (MVMR) analysis was conducted to estimate the effects independent 
of carbohydrate and protein intakes.
RESULTS: Genetically predicted per standard deviation increase in the total fat 
and saturated fat intakes were associated with 44 and 38% higher risks of LOAD 
(total fat: odds ratio = 1.44, 95% CI 1.03-2.02; saturated fat: odds ratio = 
1.38, 95% CI 1.002-1.90; P = 0.049). The associations remained significant in 
the MVMR analysis (total fat: odds ratio = 3.31, 95% CI 1.74-6.29; saturated 
fat: odds ratio = 2.04, 95% CI 1.16-3.59). Total fat and saturated fat intakes 
were associated with a higher risk of all forms of Alzheimer's disease in the 
MVMR analysis (total fat: odds ratio = 2.09, 95% CI 1.22-3.57; saturated fat: 
odds ratio = 1.60, 95% CI 1.01-2.52). The PUF intake was not associated with 
LOAD or all forms of Alzheimer's disease.
CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated that total dietary fat intake, especially 
saturated fat, contributed to the risk of Alzheimer's disease, and the effects 
were independent of other nutrients. These findings informed prevention 
strategies and management for Alzheimer's disease directly towards reducing 
dietary saturated fat intake.

Professor Klaus Fassbender is a distinguished neurologist from Germany, widely 
recognized for his groundbreaking contributions to the fields of neurology and 
neurodegenerative disease. His work has been pivotal in advancing our 
understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative 
disorders, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, as well as in refining 
therapeutic strategies for their treatment. His studies in cerebrovascular 
disease have elucidated the complex molecular and cellular processes involved in 
ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, leading to the development of novel therapeutic 
interventions, often bridging the gap between laboratory discoveries and their 
application in clinical settings. Professor Klaus Fassbender is "the father" of 
the mobile stroke unit (MSU). With the "time is brain" concept in mind, he 
proposed and developed the MSU concept for the first time, allowing prehospital 
stroke imaging, diagnosis, and treatment directly at the site of emergency. This 
concept reduced times between symptoms onset and treatment, resulting in an 
increased proportion of patients receiving treatment within "the golden hour" 
and leading to the improvement of functional outcomes at 90 days. Professor 
Fassbender's work has been instrumental in shaping contemporary approaches to 
diagnosing and managing stroke and neurodegenerative disease, making him a 
leading figure in modern neurology.

Alzheimer's disease is characterized by a progressive cognitive decline in older 
individuals accompanied by the deposition of two pathognomonic proteins 
amyloid-β and tau. It is well documented that synaptotoxic soluble amyloid-β 
aggregates facilitate synaptic long-term depression, a major form of synaptic 
weakening that correlates with cognitive status in Alzheimer's disease. Whether 
synaptotoxic tau, which is also associated strongly with progressive cognitive 
decline in patients with Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies, also causes 
facilitation remains to be clarified. Young male adult and middle-aged rats were 
employed. Synaptotoxic tau and amyloid-β were obtained from different sources 
including (i) aqueous brain extracts from patients with Alzheimer's disease and 
Pick's disease tauopathy; (ii) the secretomes of induced pluripotent stem 
cell-derived neurons from individuals with trisomy of chromosome 21; and (iii) 
synthetic amyloid-β. In vivo electrophysiology was performed in urethane 
anaesthetized animals. Evoked field excitatory postsynaptic potentials were 
recorded from the stratum radiatum in the CA1 area of the hippocampus with 
electrical stimulation to the Schaffer collateral-commissural pathway. To study 
the enhancement of long-term depression, relatively weak low-frequency 
electrical stimulation was used to trigger peri-threshold long-term depression. 
Synaptotoxic forms of tau or amyloid-β were administered 
intracerebroventricularly. The ability of agents that inhibit the cytokine 
tumour necrosis factor-α or the integrated stress response to prevent the 
effects of amyloid-β or tau on long-term depression was assessed after local or 
systemic injection, respectively. We found that diffusible tau from Alzheimer's 
disease or Pick's disease patients' brain aqueous extracts or the secretomes of 
trisomy of chromosome 21 induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons, like 
Alzheimer's disease brain-derived amyloid-β and synthetic oligomeric amyloid-β, 
potently enhanced synaptic long-term depression in live rats. We further 
demonstrated that long-term depression facilitation by both tau and amyloid-β 
was age-dependent, being more potent in middle-aged compared with young animals. 
Finally, at the cellular level, we provide pharmacological evidence that tumour 
necrosis factor-α and the integrated stress response are downstream mediators of 
long-term depression facilitation by both synaptotoxic tau and amyloid-β. 
Overall, these findings reveal the promotion of an age-dependent synaptic 
weakening by both synaptotoxic tau and amyloid-β. Pharmacologically targeting 
shared mechanisms of tau and amyloid-β synaptotoxicity, such as tumour necrosis 
factor-α or the integrated stress response, provides an attractive strategy to 
treat early Alzheimer's disease.

This study aimed to investigate the dementia risk associated with mild 
behavioral impairment (MBI) and its domains in older community-dwelling 
individuals. A total 4803 community-dwelling individuals aged over 55 years were 
followed for 4.5 years (ZARADEMP study). MBI was assessed according to the 
International Society to Advance Alzheimer's Research and Treatment (ISTAART) 
diagnostic criteria using the Geriatric Mental State (GMS). Odds ratios (OR) for 
incident dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) were determined using logistic 
regression models adjusted for potential confounders (such as age, disability, 
or vascular disease). In cognitively normal individuals, decreased motivation 
was the only MBI domain that was associated with an increased risk of all-cause 
dementia (OR: 2.30 [95% confidence interval {CI}: 1.16-4.61]) in multivariable 
analyses, although the increase in the risk of AD was not statistically 
significant. Our findings suggest that decreased motivation may be a phenotypic 
marker for individuals at risk of dementia. Further research is required to 
evaluate the association between MBI domains and different types of dementia.

USA.

OBJECTIVES: The present study examined the existence of posttraumatic growth 
(PTG) and its association with cognitive processing, resilience, and family 
functioning in family caregivers of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHOD: Family caregivers (N = 114) were surveyed using measures of cognitive 
processing, resilience, family functioning, and PTG. Data were analyzed using 
descriptive statistics, Pearson correlations, and multiple regression analyses.
RESULTS: The average PTG score in the sample was 48.6 (SD = 18.7; range 14-105). 
Race, education level, severity of the patient's AD, cognitive processing, 
resilience, and family functioning explained 25.8% of the variance in PTG (F [9, 
95] = 5.025, p < 0.001). Race was significantly correlated with PTG; 
specifically, non-White caregivers reported higher PTG than White caregivers 
(p < 0.05). When controlling for race and education level, mild AD, intrusive 
rumination, and family satisfaction were significant predictors of PTG 
(p < 0.05). However, deliberate rumination, resilience, and family communication 
were not significant predictors PTG (p > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: These findings provide insight into factors that may influence the 
development of PTG in family caregivers of patients with AD. Results may inform 
intervention strategies to mitigate the negative consequences of caregiving and 
promote PTG in this caregiver population.

BACKGROUND: SHR-1707 is a novel humanized anti-Aβ IgG1 monoclonal antibody that 
binds to Aβ fibrils and monomers to block the formation of Aβ plaques or to 
promote the microglial phagocytosis of Aβ. Preclinical studies showed that 
SHR-1707 reduced brain Aβ deposition in 5xFAD transgenic mice. Herein, we 
conducted two phase 1 studies to evaluate the safety, tolerability, 
pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of a single intravenous dose of 
SHR-1707 in healthy adult subjects.
METHODS: Two randomized, double-blind, single-ascending-dose, phase 1 studies 
were conducted in China (Study CHN) and Australia (Study AUS). Study CHN 
consisted of 2 parts. In Part 1, eligible healthy young adults (18-45 years) 
were sequentially randomized 8:2 to receive SHR-1707 (five cohorts: 2, 6, 20, 
40, and 60 mg/kg) or placebo in each cohort; in Part 2, elderly subjects (55-80 
years) were randomized 8:4 to receive SHR-1707 (20 mg/kg) or placebo. A similar 
design was used in Study AUS, but with only healthy young adults enrolled across 
three dosing cohorts (2, 20, and 60 mg/kg).
RESULTS: Sixty-two (part 1/2, n = 50/12; age range, 18-42/55-63 years) and 30 
subjects (age range, 18-42 years) received SHR-1707 or placebo in Study CHN and 
Study AUS, respectively. In Study CHN, all treatment-related adverse events 
(TRAEs) were mild, with the most common being transient laboratory 
abnormalities. In Study AUS, TRAEs were mostly mild (1 moderate event each with 
SHR-1707/placebo); the most common TRAEs with SHR-1707 were dysgeusia and 
fatigue (8.3% each). In both studies, the exposure of SHR-1707 increased in a 
slightly greater than dose-proportional manner over the dose range of 2-60 mg/kg 
in young adults; there was a dose-dependent increase in plasma Aβ42 
concentration following SHR-1707 administration compared with the placebo group. 
The safety and PK and PD profiles of SHR-1707 in the elderly subjects were 
consistent with the younger counterpart at the same dose level. No ethnic 
difference in safety, PK and PD of SHR-1707 was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: A single intravenous dose of SHR-1707 at 2-60 mg/kg was safe and 
well tolerated in healthy young adult and elderly subjects. The PK and PD 
profiles are supportive for further clinical development.

BACKGROUND: The ability of socially assistive robots (SARs) to treat dementia 
and Alzheimer's disease has been verified. Currently, to increase the range of 
their application, there is an increasing amount of interest in using SARs to 
relieve pain and negative emotions among children in routine medical settings. 
However, there is little consensus regarding the use of these robots.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of SARs on pain and negative 
affectivity among children undergoing invasive needle-based procedures.
DESIGN: This study was a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized 
controlled trials that was conducted in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook 
guidelines.
METHODS: The PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Embase, CNKI, and 
WanFang databases were searched from inception to January 2024 to identify 
relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We used the Cochrane Risk of Bias 
tool 2.0 (RoB2.0) to assess the risk of bias among the included studies, and we 
used RevMan 5.4 software to conduct the meta-analysis. The Grading of 
Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework was 
used to assess the quality of the evidence.
RESULTS: Ten RCTs involving 815 pediatric subjects were selected for this review 
and reported outcomes related to pain and emotions during IV placement, port 
needle insertion, flu vaccination, blood sampling, and dental treatment. 
Children undergoing needle-related procedures with SARs reported less anxiety 
(SMD= -0.36; 95% CI= -0.64, -0.09) and fewer distressed avoidance behaviors 
(SMD= -0.67; 95% CI= -1.04, -0.30) than did those receiving typical care. There 
were nonsignificant differences between these groups in terms of in pain (SMD = 
-0.02; 95% CI = - 0.81, 0.78) and fear (SMD = 0.38; 95% CI= -0.06, 0.82). The 
results of exploratory subgroup analyses revealed no statistically significant 
differences based on the intervention type of robots or anesthetic use.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of SARs is a promising intervention method for alleviating 
anxiety and distress among children undergoing needle-related procedures. 
However, additional high-quality randomized controlled trials are needed to 
further validate these conclusions.

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), a collection of small proteins with important 
roles in classical innate immunity, have been extensively studied in multiple 
organisms, particularly in Drosophila melanogaster. Advances in CRISPR/Cas9 
genome editing have allowed individual AMP functions to be dissected, revealing 
specific and selective roles in host defense. Recent findings have also revealed 
many unexpected contributions of endogenous AMPs to neuronal functions and 
neurodegenerative diseases, and have shed light on the intersections between 
innate immunity and neurobiology. We explore the intricate relationships between 
AMPs and sleep regulation, memory formation, as well as traumatic brain injury 
and several neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and Parkinson's disease (PD). Understanding the 
diverse functions of AMPs opens new avenues for neuroinflammation and 
neurodegenerative disease research and potential therapeutic development.

Depression is a complex and pervasive mental health disorder affecting millions 
globally. Serotonin, a critical neurotransmitter, plays a central role in the 
pathophysiology of depression. This review explores serotonin's multifaceted 
role in depression, focusing on its synthesis, bioavailability, receptor 
interactions, and the impact of various factors, including diet, stress, and 
gender differences. This review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of 
serotonin's role in depression by examining its synthesis and structure, its 
bioavailability and dietary influences, and its interactions with stress and 
immune responses. Additionally, it investigates the influence of age, 
socioeconomic status, and gender on depression, and integrates findings from 
animal research to elucidate serotonin's impact on mood disorders and cognitive 
decline. A literature review was conducted using PubMed, Google Scholar, and 
Embase databases. Key focus areas included serotonin synthesis and receptor 
interactions, dietary effects on serotonin bioavailability, and the relationship 
between serotonin, immune responses, and stress. Gender differences, age-related 
factors, and socioeconomic influences on depression were also examined. Studies 
were thematically categorized and analyzed to provide a cohesive overview. Our 
review highlights that serotonin synthesis involves a complex enzymatic process, 
with recent structural studies revealing intricate receptor interactions. 
Dietary factors significantly impact serotonin levels, with interventions 
potentially modulating mood disorders. Stress and immune responses are linked to 
serotonin dynamics, with chronic stress exacerbating mood disorders and 
influencing cognitive decline. Animal studies underscore serotonin's role in 
mood regulation and cognitive function, while human research reveals how age, 
gender, and socioeconomic factors affect depression. The findings emphasize the 
need for a multidimensional approach to understanding and treating depression. 
Various factors, including diet, stress, and immune responses, influence 
serotonin's role in mood disorders. The review suggests potential therapeutic 
pathways involving dietary interventions and stress management. Furthermore, 
gender-specific considerations and the impact of age and socioeconomic status on 
depression outcomes highlight the need for tailored treatment strategies.

Hubei, China.

OBJECTIVES: The complex associations of socioeconomic status (SES) and lifestyle 
with dementia are unclear. Our objective was to examine whether a broad 
combination of lifestyle factors mediates the associations of SES with incident 
dementia and the extent of interaction or joint relations of lifestyles and SES 
with dementia.
METHODS: A total of 274,871 participants from the UK Biobank were included. SES 
was assessed using the Townsend Deprivation Index. A lifestyle index was created 
based on smoking status, alcohol consumption, physical activity, social 
connections, sleep duration, diet, and sedentary behavior. Cox proportional 
hazards models were fitted. Mediation and interaction analyses were conducted to 
explore the relationship between lifestyles and SES in dementia.
RESULTS: The hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for when 
participants with low SES were compared with participants with high SES were 
1.32 (1.22-1.42) for all-cause dementia, 1.25 (1.11-1.40) for Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), and 1.61 (1.37-1.90) for vascular dementia (VD). Lifestyles 
explained ≤7.8% of socioeconomic disparities in dementia. Unhealthy lifestyle 
categories were associated with a higher risk of dementia and its subtypes 
across all SES levels. The HRs (95% CIs) for all-cause dementia, AD, and VD 
comparing participants with low SES and the least healthy lifestyle versus those 
with high SES and the healthiest lifestyle were 1.82 (1.56-2.11), 1.51 
(1.20-1.90), and 2.56 (1.81-3.61), respectively.
DISCUSSION: Adhering to a healthy lifestyle may prevent dementia across all 
socioeconomic groups, but socioeconomic inequalities in dementia cannot be fully 
addressed by promoting healthy lifestyles alone. The social determinants of 
dementia need to be better addressed.

The clinical prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and drug development of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) require urgent detection of novel targets and methods. 
Autophagy and microglia are significantly associated with the pathogenesis of 
early AD. This study indicated that microRNA-375-3p can inhibit autophagy by 
promoting mTOR phosphorylation in normal physiological conditions, while 
microRNA-375-3p promoted autophagy and enhanced neural repair by inhibiting the 
expression of presenilin 1 in early AD pathogenesis. Furthermore, co-treatment 
of rapamycin, and microRNA-375-3p can synergistically promote the autophagy and 
microglial activation in a neuroprotective manner, clear Aβ accumulation, repair 
nerve damage, and alleviate cognitive dysfunction and memory defects in APP/PS1 
TG mice. This research revealed the impact and mechanism of miR375-3p on the 
early stage of AD through in vivo and in vitro experiments and provides new 
ideas and directions for the early treatment of AD.

Microglia are critical innate immune cells of the brain. In vivo targeting of 
microglia using gene-delivery systems is crucial for studying brain physiology 
and developing gene therapies for neurodegenerative diseases and other brain 
disorders such as NeuroAIDS. Historically, microglia have been extremely 
resistant to transduction by viral vectors, including adeno-associated virus 
(AAV) vectors. Recently, there has been some progress demonstrating the 
feasibility and potential of using AAV to transduce microglia after direct 
intraparenchymal vector injection. Data suggests that combining specific AAV 
capsids with microglia-specific gene expression cassettes to reduce neuron 
off-targeting will be key. However, no groups have developed AAV capsids for 
microglia transduction after intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection. The ICV 
route of administration has advantages such as increased brain biodistribution 
while avoiding issues related to systemic injection. Here, we performed an in 
vivo selection using an AAV peptide display library that enables recovery of 
capsids that mediate transgene expression in microglia. Using this approach, we 
identified a capsid, MC5, which mediated enhanced transduction of microglia 
after ICV injection compared to AAV9. Furthermore, MC5 enhanced both the 
efficiency (85%) and specificity (93%) of transduction compared to a recently 
described evolved AAV9 capsid for microglia targeting after direct injection 
into the brain parenchyma. Exploration of the use of MC5 in a mouse models of 
Alzheimer's disease revealed transduced microglia surrounding and within 
plaques. Overall, our results demonstrate that the MC5 capsid is a useful gene 
transfer tool to target microglia in vivo by direct and ICV routes of 
administration.

Caloric restriction (CR) is a widely recognized geroprotective intervention that 
slows or prevents Alzheimer's disease (AD) in animal models. CR is typically 
implemented via feeding mice a single meal per day; as CR mice rapidly consume 
their food, they are subject to a prolonged fast between meals. While CR has 
been shown to improve metabolic and cognitive functions and suppress 
pathological markers in AD mouse models, the specific contributions of fasting 
versus calorie reduction remains unclear. Here, we investigated the contribution 
of fasting and energy restriction to the beneficial effects of CR on AD 
progression. To test this, we placed 6-month-old 3xTg mice on one of several 
diet regimens, allowing us to dissect the effects of calories and fasting on 
metabolism, AD pathology, and cognition. We find that energy restriction alone, 
without fasting, was sufficient to improve glucose tolerance and reduce 
adiposity in both sexes, and to reduce Aβ plaques and improve aspects of 
cognitive performance in females. However, we find that a prolonged fast between 
meals is necessary for many of the benefits of CR, including improved insulin 
sensitivity, reduced phosphorylation of tau, decreased neuroinflammation, 
inhibition of mTORC1 signaling, and activation of autophagy, as well as for the 
full cognitive benefits of CR. Finally, we find that fasting is essential for 
the benefits of CR on survival in male 3xTg mice. Overall, our results 
demonstrate that fasting is required for the full benefits of a CR diet on the 
development and progression of AD in 3xTg mice, and suggest that both when and 
how much we eat influences the development and progress of AD.

Plasma membrane protein degradation and recycling is regulated by the 
endolysosomal system, wherein endosomes bud from the plasma membrane into the 
cytosol and mature into degradative lysosomes. As such, the endolysosomal system 
plays a critical role in determining the abundance of proteins on the cell 
surface, influencing cellular identity and function. Highly polarized cells, 
like neurons, rely on the endolysosomal system for axonal and dendritic 
specialization and synaptic compartmentalization. The importance of this system 
to neuronal function is reflected by the prevalence of risk variants in 
components of the system in several neurodegenerative diseases, ranging from 
Parkinson's to Alzheimer's disease. Nevertheless, our understanding of endocytic 
cargo and core endolysosomal machinery in neurons is limited, in part due to 
technical limitations. Here, we developed a toolkit for capturing EEA1-postive 
endosomes (Endo-IP) and TMEM192-positive lysosomes (Lyso-IP) in stem 
cell-derived induced neurons (iNeurons). We demonstrated its utility by 
revealing the endolysosomal protein landscapes for cortical-like iNeurons and 
stem cells. This allowed us to globally profile endocytic cargo, identifying 
hundreds of transmembrane proteins, including neurogenesis and synaptic 
proteins, as well as endocytic cargo with predicted SNX17 or SNX27 recognition 
motifs. By contrast, parallel lysosome profiling reveals a simpler protein 
repertoire, reflecting in part temporally controlled recycling or degradation 
for many endocytic targets. This system will facilitate mechanistic 
interrogation of endolysosomal components found as risk factors in 
neurodegenerative disease.

BACKGROUND: The pathological effects of amyloid β oligomers (Aβo) may be 
mediated through the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGluR5), leading 
to synaptic loss in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Positron emission tomography (PET) 
studies of mGluR5 using [18F]FPEB indicate a reduction of receptor binding that 
is focused in the medial temporal lobe in AD. Synaptic loss due to AD measured 
through synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) quantification with [11C]UCB-J 
PET is also focused in the medial temporal lobe, but with clear widespread 
reductions is commonly AD-affected neocortical regions. In this study, we used 
[18F]FPEB and [11C]UCB-J PET to investigate the relationship between mGluR5 and 
synaptic density in early AD.
METHODS: Fifteen amyloid positive participants with early AD and 12 amyloid 
negative, cognitively normal (CN) participants underwent PET scans with both 
[18F]FPEB to measure mGluR5 and [11C]UCB-J to measure synaptic density. 
Parametric DVR images using equilibrium methods were generated from dynamic. For 
[18F]FPEB PET, DVR was calculated using equilibrium methods and a cerebellum 
reference region. For [11C]UCB-J PET, DVR was calculated with a simplified 
reference tissue model - 2 and a whole cerebellum reference region..
RESULT: A strong positive correlation between mGluR5 and synaptic density was 
present in the hippocampus for participants with AD (r = 0.81, p < 0.001) and in 
the CN group (r = 0.74, p = 0.005). In the entorhinal cortex, there was a strong 
positive correlation between mGluR5 and synaptic in the AD group (r = 0.85, p 
<0.001), but a weaker non-significant correlation in the CN group (r = 0.36, p = 
0.245). Exploratory analyses within and between other brain regions suggested 
significant positive correlations between mGluR5 in the medial temporal lobe and 
synaptic density in a broader set of commonly AD-affected regions.
CONCLUSION: Medial temporal loss of mGluR5 in AD is associated with synaptic 
loss in both medial temporal regions and more broadly in association cortical 
regions, indicating that mGluR5 mediated Aβo toxicity may lead to early synaptic 
loss more broadly in AD-affected networks. In CN individuals, an isolated strong 
association between lower mGluR5 and lower synaptic density may indicate non-AD 
related synaptic loss.

Medicinal plants and phytochemicals are some of the major sources in the 
treatment of various neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). There is no FDA-approved drug to target AD pathology directly. Full 
cognitive restoration and management of psychosis-like symptoms are still to be 
achieved. Being comparatively safer with fewer side effects, medicinal plants 
have been among the major areas of interest to be researched. Several 
mechanistic pathways are involved in AD including anticholinesterase activity, 
glutamate toxicity, free radicals generation, Amyloid β (Aβ) toxicity, 
inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Various phytochemicals such as 
paenol, andrographolide, isoquercitrin, flavonoids, and saponins obtained from 
different plant sources, various medicinal plants like Spirulina maxima, 
Salicornia europaea, Curcuma longa, Citrus Junos Tanaka, Cassiae semen, Centella 
asiatica as well as various traditional medicinal plants of China, Asia, Europe, 
Turkey, and Iran have been found effective against one or more of these targets. 
Large numbers of clinical trials are under process to evaluate the role of 
different phytoconstituents in AD management. Out of 143 agents under clinical 
trials, 119 have been categorized as disease-modifying agents. The present 
review extensively covers the recent advancements in the usage of phytochemicals 
and medicinal plants in various experimental AD models. It involves clinical 
trials and other research works divided into three sections, including those 
performed in vitro, in vivo, and in humans mainly from the last five years along 
with disease markers and mechanistic pathways involved. However, phytochemicals 
should be explored further in order to achieve neurorestoration in AD.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, and 
currently, no effective treatments are available to reverse or halt its 
progression in clinical practice. Although a plethora of studies have 
highlighted the benefits of physical exercise in combating AD, elder individuals 
often have limited exercise capacity. Therefore, mild physical exercise and 
nutritional interventions represent potential strategies for preventing and 
mitigating neurodegenerative diseases. Our research, along with other studies, 
have demonstrated that platycodin D (PD) or its metabolite, platycodigenin, 
derived from the medicinal plant Platycodon grandiflorus, exerts neuroprotective 
effects against amyloid β (Aβ)-induced neuroinflammation. However, the combined 
effects of PD and physical exercise on alleviating AD have yet to be explored. 
The current study aimed to investigate whether combined therapy could 
synergistically ameliorate memory deficits and AD pathology in 5 × FAD mice.
METHODS: Five-month-old 5 × FAD mice were randomly assigned to four groups, and 
received either PD (5 mg/kg/day, p.o.), voluntary running, or a combination of 
both for 47 days. Nest building test, locomotion test, and Morris water maze 
test were used to evaluate the cognitive function. Immunohistochemical and ELISA 
analysis was performed to determine Aβ build-up, microglia and astrocytes 
hyperactivation, and survival neurons in the hippocampus and perirhinal cortex. 
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis was used to assess the polarization of 
microglia and astrocytes. HPLC analysis was performed to measure monoamine 
neurotransmitters in the hippocampus.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The combination of PD and voluntary running 
synergistically restored nest-building behavior, alleviated recognition and 
spatial memory deficits, and showed superior effects compared to monotherapy. In 
addition, the PD and voluntary running combination reduced Aβ build-up, 
decreased hyperactivation of microglia and astrocytes in the hippocampus and 
perirhinal cortex, promoted the polarization of inflammatory M1 microglia and 
reactive astrocytes toward beneficial phenotypes, and lowered systemic 
circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines while increasing anti-inflammatory 
cytokines in 5 × FAD mice. Furthermore, combined therapy effectively protected 
neurons and increased levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) in 
the hippocampus of 5 × FAD mice. In conclusion, the combination of PD and 
voluntary running holds great potential as a treatment for AD, offering promise 
for delaying onset or progression of AD.

OBJECTIVE: In this study, we examined the effectiveness of hyperbaric oxygen 
(HBO) therapy in ameliorating cognitive deficits in mice with Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), while also assessing its impact on the autophagic pathway within 
the context of AD.
METHODS: 20 double-transgenic mice expressing the amyloid precursor protein and 
presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) were purposefully selected and randomly assigned to 
groups A and B. Concurrently, 20 C57BL/6 mice were chosen and randomly 
categorized into groups C and D, each consisting of 10 mice. Mice in groups B 
and D received HBO treatment. The Morris water maze assay was used to assess 
changes in mouse behavior. Immunohistochemistry techniques were used to quantify 
the expression levels of amyloid-beta 42 (Aβ42) and microtubule-associated 
protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3) in hippocampal tissues, while western blot 
analysis was used to investigate the levels of LC3-II, p62, phosphoinositide 
3-kinase (PI3K), and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) proteins within 
hippocampal tissues.
RESULTS: Mice allocated to group B exhibited reduced escape latency and 
prolonged dwell time in the target quadrant compared to other groups. 
Histological examination revealed conspicuous plaque-like deposits of Aβ42 in 
the hippocampal tissues of mice in groups A and B. Group B displayed diminished 
Aβ42-positive reactants and augmented microtubule-associated protein 
1A/1B-LC3-positive reactants compared to group A. LC3-positive reactants were 
also detected in the hippocampal tissues of mice in groups C and D, surpassing 
the levels observed in groups A and B. Furthermore, group B demonstrated 
significantly lower expression of mTOR protein and markedly higher expression of 
LC3-II protein in mouse hippocampal tissues when compared to group A (P < 0.05). 
Conversely, there were no significant disparities noted in PI3K and p62 protein 
expression between groups B and A. Notably, no discernible discrepancies were 
observed in the expression levels of mTOR, PI3K, LC3-II, and p62 proteins 
between groups C and D within mouse hippocampal tissues.
CONCLUSION: HBO treatment demonstrates efficacy in enhancing cognitive function 
in mice with AD and holds promise as a potential therapeutic intervention for AD 
by facilitating the activation of the mTOR pathway-mediated autophagy.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. Its 
early stage, amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI), is characterized by 
disrupted information flow in the brain. Previous studies have yielded 
inconsistent results when using electrophysiological techniques to investigate 
functional connectivity changes in AD, and a contributing factor may be the 
study of brain activity divided into frequencies.
METHODS: Our study aimed to address this issue by employing a cross-frequency 
approach to compare the functional networks of 172 healthy subjects and 105 aMCI 
patients. Using magnetoencephalography, we constructed source-based multilayer 
graphs considering both intra- and inter-frequency functional connectivity. We 
then assessed changes in network organization through three centrality measures, 
and combined them into a unified centrality score to provide a comprehensive 
assessment of centrality disruption in aMCI.
RESULTS: The results revealed a noteworthy shift in centrality distribution in 
aMCI patients, both in terms of spatial distribution and frequency. Posterior 
brain regions decrease synchrony between their high-frequency oscillations and 
other regions' activity across all frequencies, while anterior regions increase 
synchrony between their low-frequency oscillations and other regions' activity 
across all frequencies. Thus, posterior regions reduce their relative importance 
in favor of anterior regions.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide valuable insights into the intricate changes 
that occur in functional brain networks during the early stages of AD, 
demonstrating that considering the interplays between different frequency bands 
enhances our understanding of AD network dynamics and setting a precedent for 
the study of functional networks using a multilayer approach.

Glial reactivity may contribute to sex/gender differences in Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) pathophysiology. Here, we investigated the differential effect of 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glial markers on AD pathology and neurodegeneration by 
sex/gender among cognitively unimpaired older adults at increased risk of 
developing AD. We included 397 participants from the ALFA+ cohort with CSF 
Aβ42/40, p-tau181, sTREM2, YKL40, and GFAP, magnetic resonance imaging-based 
hippocampal volume (n = 299), and amyloid burden (centiloids) measured with 
[18F] flutemetamol positron emission tomography (n = 341). We ran multiple 
linear regression models to assess the association between glial markers, AD 
pathology and hippocampal volumes and their interaction with sex/gender, 
using False Discovery Rate to correct for multiple comparisons. Glial markers 
significantly contributed to explain amyloid burden, tau pathology, and 
hippocampal volumes, beyond age and/or primary AD pathology in a 
sex/gender-specific manner. Compared to men, women showed increased amyloid 
burden (centiloids) and CSF p-tau181 with increasing levels of sTREM2 and YKL40, 
and YKL40 and GFAP, respectively. Compared to women, men with greater tau burden 
showed lower hippocampal volumes as CSF YKL40 levels increased. Overall, our 
findings suggest that glial reactivity may contribute to sex/gender differences 
in AD progression, mostly, downstream amyloid. Further research identifying 
sex/gender-specific temporal dynamics in AD development is warranted to inform 
clinical trials.

Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by progressive loss of memory. Synaptic 
loss is now the best correlate of cognitive dysfunction in patients with 
Alzheimer's disease. Thus, restoration or limitation of synapse loss is a 
promising strategy for pharmacotherapy of AD. N-N substituted piperazines are 
widely used chemical compounds for drug interventions to treat different 
illnesses including CNS diseases such as drug abuse, mental and anxiety 
disorders. Piperazine derivatives are small molecules that are usually well 
tolerated and cross blood brain barrier (BBB). Thus, disubstituted piperazines 
are good tools for searching and developing novel disease-modifying drugs. 
Previously, we have determined the piperazine derivative, 51164, as an activator 
of TRPC6 in dendritic spines. We have demonstrated synaptoprotective properties 
of 51164 in AD mouse models. However, 51164 was not able to cross BBB. Within 
the current study, we identified a novel piperazine derivative, cmp2, that is 
structurally similar to 51164 but is able to cross BBB. Cmp2 binds central part 
of monomeric TRPC6 in similar way as hypeforin does. Cmp2 selectively activates 
TRPC6 but not structurally related TRPC3 and TRPC7. Novel piperazine derivative 
exhibits synaptoprotective properties in culture and slices and penetrates the 
BBB. In vivo study indicated cmp2 (10 mg/kg I.P.) reversed deficits in synaptic 
plasticity in the 5xFAD mice. Thus, we suggest that cmp2 is a novel lead 
compound for drug development. The mechanism of cmp2 action is based on 
selective TRPC6 stimulation and it is expected to treat synaptic deficiency in 
hippocampal neurons.
