Comment in
    Thwarting amyloidosis: IL-17 as a disease modifier along the gut/brain axis.

Accumulating evidence implicates the gut microbiome (GMB) in the pathogenesis 
and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We recently showed that the GMB 
regulates reactive astrocytosis and Aβ plaque accumulation in a male APPPS1-21 
AD mouse model. Yet, the mechanism(s) by which GMB perturbation alters reactive 
astrocytosis in a manner that reduces Aβ deposition remain unknown. Here, we 
performed metabolomics on plasma from mice treated with antibiotics (ABX) and 
identified a significant increase in plasma propionate, a gut-derived 
short-chain fatty acid, only in male mice. Administration of sodium propionate 
reduced reactive astrocytosis and Aβ plaques in APPPS1-21 mice, phenocopying the 
ABX-induced phenotype. Astrocyte-specific RNA-Seq on ABX- and propionate-treated 
mice showed reduced expression of proinflammatory and increased expression of 
neurotrophic genes. Next, we performed flow cytometry experiments, in which we 
found that ABX and propionate decreased peripheral RAR-related orphan 
receptor-γ+ (Rorγt+) CD4+ (Th17) cells and IL-17 secretion, which positively 
correlated with reactive astrocytosis. Last, using an IL-17 mAb to deplete 
IL-17, we found that propionate reduced reactive astrocytosis and Aβ plaques in 
an IL-17-dependent manner. Together, these results suggest that gut-derived 
propionate regulates reactive astrocytosis and Aβ amyloidosis by decreasing 
peripheral Th17 cells and IL-17 release. Thus, propionate treatment or 
strategies boosting propionate production may represent novel therapeutic 
strategies for the treatment of AD.

A 78-year-old man with moderate Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia was treated with 
nasal-foralumab, a fully human anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody, as part of a Food 
and Drug Administration expanded-access-program, based on previously 
demonstrated efficacy of anti-CD3 antibody in animal models. 18 F-PBR06-PET, 
utilizing a second-generation 18-kDa-translocator-protein ligand targeting 
microglia, showed diffuse reduction of radiotracer uptake throughout the brain, 
following 3 months of nasal-foralumab compared with baseline. In particular, 
precuneus, posterior cingulate and anterior cingulate gyri, regions that had 
high levels of amyloid deposition on a baseline 18 F-Florbetapir-PET scan, 
showed reduction in microglial activation after nasal-foralumab treatment for 3 
months.

A Descriptive Statistical Analysis of Neuropsychiatric Symptom Pair Prevalence.

(1)EXCIVA, Heidelberg, Germany.

Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are very common and associated with high levels 
of distress, both in dementia patients and their caregivers. Especially at more 
advanced dementia disease stages, NPS rarely occur in isolation and the presence 
of two or more NPS may affect disease severity as well as the response to 
therapy. There is limited quantitative information on prevalence of specific 
symptom combinations in the general population, as well as in the populations 
recruited for symptom-specific investigations. We performed cross-sectional 
analyses of data from two longitudinal studies (Aging, Demographics, and Memory 
Study (ADAMS) and the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center data (NACC)). In 
both studies and all Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) strata, we observed 
every possible pair combination, from commonly recognized and discussed 
associations (e.g., hallucinations and delusions) to what might be seen as 
rather counter-intuitive patterns (e.g., apathy and agitation). In conclusion, 
prevalence of symptom pairs cannot be readily predicted based on prevalence of 
individual symptoms. Further, the presence of cognitive deficit and degree of 
cognitive impairment is associated with increased prevalence of all symptoms and 
symptom pairs, albeit to different degrees. The present study illustrates that, 
while there is the possibility of any combination of neuropsychiatric symptoms 
presenting during the course of dementia, their co-occurrence cannot be readily 
predicted based on the prevalence of individual symptoms. Thus, our study 
results serve as a source of reference information to inform the design and 
recruitment strategies for future clinical studies and epidemiological research 
on neuropsychiatric symptoms in people with dementia.

We explored how the phosphorylation state of collapsin response mediator protein 
2 (CRMP2) influences mitochondrial functions in cultured cortical neurons and 
cortical synaptic mitochondria isolated from APP-SAA KI mice, a knock-in APP 
mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). CRMP2 phosphorylation was increased at 
Thr 509/514 and Ser 522 in brain cortical lysates and cultured neurons from AD 
mice. The basal and maximal respiration of AD neurons were decreased. 
Mitochondria were hyperpolarized and superoxide anion production was increased 
in neurons from AD mice. In isolated synaptic AD mitochondria, ADP-stimulated 
and DNP-stimulated respiration were decreased, whereas ADP-induced mitochondrial 
depolarization was reduced and prolonged. We found that CRMP2 binds to the 
adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. The 
increased CRMP2 phosphorylation in AD mice correlated with CRMP2 dissociation 
from the ANT and decreased ANT activity in AD mitochondria. On the other hand, 
recombinant CRMP2 (rCRMP2), added to the ANT-reconstituted proteoliposomes, 
increased ANT activity. A small molecule (S)-lacosamide ((S)-LCM), which binds 
to CRMP2 and suppresses CRMP2 phosphorylation by Cdk5 and GSK-3β, prevented 
CRMP2 hyperphosphorylation, rescued CRMP2 binding to the ANT, improved ANT 
activity, and restored the mitochondrial membrane potential and respiratory 
responses to ADP and 2,4-dinitrophenol. Thus, our study highlights an important 
role for CRMP2 in regulating the mitochondrial oxidative metabolism in AD by 
modulating the ANT activity in a phosphorylation-dependent manner.

BACKGROUND: To understand the pathogenetic mechanisms shared among schizophrenia 
(SCZ), bipolar disorder (BP), and major depression (MDD), we investigated the 
pleiotropic mechanisms using large-scale genome-wide and brain transcriptomic 
data.
METHODS: We analyzed SCZ, BP, and MDD genome-wide association datasets available 
from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium using the PLEIO framework and 
characterized the pleiotropic loci identified using pathway and tissue 
enrichment analyses. Pleiotropic and disorder-specific loci were also assessed.
RESULTS: Our pleiotropy-informed genome-wide analysis identified 553 variants 
that included 192 loci not reaching genome-wide significance in input datasets. 
These were enriched for five molecular pathways: cadherin signaling 
(p = 2.18 × 10-8), Alzheimer's disease-amyloid secretase (p = 4 × 10-4), 
oxytocin receptor-mediated signaling (p = 1.47 × 10-3), metabotropic glutamate 
receptor group III (p = 5.82 × 10-4) and Wnt signaling (p = 1.61 × 10-11). 
Pleiotropic loci demonstrated the strongest enrichment in the brain cortex 
(p = 5.8 × 10-28), frontal cortex (p = 3 × 10-31), and cerebellar hemisphere 
(p = 9.8 × 10-28). SCZ-BP-MDD pleiotropic variants were also enriched for 
neurodevelopmental brain transcriptomic profiles related to the second-trimester 
post-conception (week 21, p = 7.35 × 10-5; week 17, p = 6.36 × 10-4) and first 
year of life (p = 3.25 × 10-5).
CONCLUSIONS: Genetic mechanisms shared among SCZ, BP, and MDD appear to be 
related to early neuronal development. Because the genetic architecture of 
psychopathology transcends diagnostic boundaries, pleiotropy-focused analyses 
can lead to increased gene discovery and novel insights into relevant pathogenic 
mechanisms.

Neuroprotective Effect of Abscisic Acid on MPTP-Induced Parkinson's Disease in 
Mice.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second largest neurodegenerative disease after 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), and neuroinflammation is one of its important causes. 
So far, there is no clear evidence that drugs can improve the onset of PD, so it 
is crucial to find and develop effective drugs for PD treatment. Abscisic acid 
(ABA) is a phytohormone with structural and medicinal functions similar to the 
PPAR-γ agonist thiazolidinedione drugs (TZDs). It has played therapeutic effects 
in a variety of inflammatory diseases, but the role and mechanism of PD have not 
been defined. The present study aimed to gain insight into the neuroprotection 
effects and mechanism of ABA in MPTP 
(1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine)-induced PD models. In this study, 
we observed that in addition to significant behavioral abnormalities in 
MPTP-induced mice, Inflammatory parameters such as ion calcium-binding adaptor 
molecule 1 (IBA-1), glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP), tumor necrosis factor 
(TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were also 
significantly increased in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). ABA treatment 
restored behavioral abnormalities and significantly reduced these inflammatory 
parameters in MPTP-induced mice. Interestingly, these effects were not related 
to the activation of the lanthionine synthetase C-like protein 2 (LANCL2) but 
were related to the regulation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor 
gamma (PPAR-γ). Intraperitoneal injection of ABA ameliorated the MPTP-induced 
increase in PPAR-γ and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor 
co-activator-1α (PGC-1α) expression. Our findings suggest that intraperitoneal 
injection of ABA is neuroprotective against neurodegeneration induced by MPTP, 
and this effect is associated with the downregulation of neuroinflammation and 
modulation of the expression of PPAR-γ and PGC-1α. These results suggest that 
ABA is expected to develop as a therapeutic candidate for PD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder that poses a 
significant challenge to the health of the global aging population. Despite 
extensive research, the complex mechanisms underlying AD pathogenesis remain 
largely elusive. In recent years, a growing number of clinical studies have 
demonstrated the preventive and therapeutic potential of Traditional Chinese 
Medicine (TCM) against AD through multiple pathways, targets, and compounds. In 
this study, we conducted a review of the literature published over the past 20 
years through international and domestic databases, including PubMed, Medline, 
Cochrane Library, CNKI, SinoMed, Wanfang, and VIP Journal Integration Platform. 
This review systematically evaluates current research advancements regarding 
single-herb preparations, bioactive constituents, and compound formulations in 
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), with focused analysis on three therapeutic 
categories: tonifying herbs, blood-activating and stasis-eliminating agents, as 
well as orifice-opening, phlegm-resolving, and mind-stabilizing medicinal 
substances. Furthermore, this review discusses the potential mechanisms 
underpinning the anti-AD effects of TCMs. By integrating these insights, this 
review aims to establish a theoretical foundation for the application of TCMs in 
AD treatment and provide a reference for future pharmacological studies and the 
development of health-related products.

BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is characterized by abnormal changes 
in spatiotemporal neuronal specificity responses. Simultaneous 
electroencephalogram (EEG)-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offers a 
novel approach to measure these changes. Emerging evidence suggests that 
acupuncture may enhance cognitive function by modulating spatial or temporal 
central activity in individuals with MCI. However, no studies have investigated 
the detailed mechanisms underlying this effect.
METHODS: This randomized controlled neuroimaging trial will enroll 60 patients 
with MCI, who will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: a real acupuncture 
(RA) group or a sham acupuncture (SA) group. The trial period will last 
12 weeks, during which participants will receive 24 sessions of acupuncture 
twice weekly. The primary outcome measure will be the improvement in the 
Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) score from 
baseline to post-treatment. Secondary outcomes will include improvements in 
specific cognitive domains such as memory, executive function, language, and 
attention. Simultaneous EEG-fMRI combined with correlation analysis, regression 
analysis, and joint independent component analysis (jICA) will elucidate the 
spatiotemporal central modulatory mechanisms of acupuncture in MCI patients.
DISCUSSION: This study may reveal that real acupuncture can treat cognitive 
impairment by modulating the brain's spatiotemporal neuronal specificity 
activity. Our findings will provide scientific evidence for the efficacy of 
acupuncture in the treatment of MCI and further add to the understanding of the 
neural mechanisms.

NTN-1 attenuates amyloid-β-mediated microglial neuroinflammation and memory 
impairment via the NF-κB pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome in a rat model of 
Alzheimer's disease.

University, Harbin, China.

INTRODUCTION: Neuroinflammation driven by microglial activation represents a 
pivotal pathological mechanism underlying brain injury in Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), with NLRP3 inflammasome activation being a hallmark feature of this 
process. Netrin-1 (NTN-1) was recently shown to have potent anti-inflammatory 
and anti-apoptotic properties in a range of inflammatory diseases; however, its 
potential effect on neuroinflammation in AD treatment has not been well 
examined. Accordingly, this study aimed to investigate the effects of NTN-1 on 
cognitive impairment and to explore the anti-inflammatory properties related to 
the NLRP3 inflammasome and NF-κB signaling in Aβ1-42-induced rat models.
METHODS: We assessed the effects of NTN-1 on neurobehavioral function, 
microglial activation and neuroinflammation mechanisms in Aβ1-42-treated rats 
using the Morris water maze test and Western blotting.
RESULTS: Our results indicated that microinjections of NTN-1 attenuated 
Aβ1-42-induced memory and cognitive dysfunction and significantly inhibited 
microglial proliferation and NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the hippocampus 
and cortex of AD rats. Additionally, NTN-1 effectively prevented proinflammatory 
factor (IL1β and IL18) release and NF-κB signaling upstream activation.
DISCUSSION: Overall, the results of the present study indicated that exogenous 
NTN-1 treatment prevented neuroinflammation and cognitive deficits by inhibiting 
microglial activation, which is possibly mediated by the NF-κB signaling pathway 
and NLRP3 inflammasome activation in Aβ1-42-simulated rat models. NTN-1 emerges 
as a promising therapeutic candidate for mitigating microglia-mediated 
neuropathology in AD through its anti-inflammatory properties.

Monoamines, including norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine, orchestrate a 
broad spectrum of neurophysiological and homeostatic events. Recent research 
shows a pivotal role for monoaminergic signaling in modulating neuroinflammation 
by regulating proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines within the central 
nervous system. Importantly, this modulation is not unidirectional; released 
proinflammatory cytokines markedly "feedback" to influence the metabolism of 
monoamine neurotransmitters, impacting their synthesis, release, and reuptake. 
This bidirectional interplay significantly links monoaminergic pathways and 
neuroinflammatory responses. In this review, we summarize current knowledge of 
the dynamic interactions between monoamine signaling and neuroinflammation, as 
well as their critical implications for the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric 
disorders, including Parkinson's Disease, Major Depressive Disorder, and 
Alzheimer's Disease. By integrating recent findings, we shed light on potential 
therapeutic targets within these interconnected pathways, providing insights 
into novel treatment strategies for these devastating disorders.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that imposes 
a heavy burden on patients and their families. Hypertension is an important risk 
factor for AD, but the specific mechanism of its impact is still unclear. This 
study thus aimed to analyze the relationship and trend changes between AD and 
hypertension through bibliometric methods.
METHODS: Literature on AD and hypertension was retrieved from the Web of Science 
Core Collection (WoSCC) database between 2004 and 2023. Data regarding 
countries, institutions, authors and journals were sourced from WoSCC. CiteSpace 
and VOSviewer were used for data visualization, including author collaboration, 
timelines view of references, reference bursts and overlay visualization maps of 
keywords. Excel 2018 software was used for the statistical analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 1,833 publications were ultimately included. From 2004 to 
2023, the number of publications per year basically showed an increasing trend. 
The United States (United States) not only had the largest output of 
publications and the highest H-index but also had the seven highest frequencies 
of publication institutions. Kehoe, Patrick ranked first with the most articles 
among 9,330 authors. The journal with the most published articles was the 
Journal of Alzheimer's Disease. Reference analysis revealed a hotspot in the 
exploration of the pathophysiological association between AD and hypertension. 
Second, the treatment effects and potential risks of antihypertensive drugs 
(AHDs) on AD are also the focus of research. Researchers have carried out a 
series of studies ranging from basic research to clinical research on AHDs for 
the treatment of AD. Finally, personalized treatment strategies will also become 
one of the hotspots of future research. Controlling hypertension through 
lifestyle changes and medication interventions in AD patients is a promising 
strategy. The analysis of keywords revealed that "amyloid deposition," 
"preeclampsia," "Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)" and "biomarkers" have 
been research hotspots in recent years.
CONCLUSION: By analyzing the references and keywords, we summarized the hot 
topics and research trends in this field. These findings provide useful 
information for researchers to explore the relationship between hypertension and 
AD further, with the hope of providing more effective treatments for AD patients 
to delay disease progression and improve quality of life.

BackgroundThe prevalence of individuals living with mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and other forms of dementia is globally 
increasing. Four out of nine international clinical guidelines recommend 
non-pharmacological cognitive interventions to enhance cognition, independence, 
and wellbeing. However, the effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation (CR) and 
cognitive training (CT) for individuals with MCI and AD and other forms of 
dementia is still debatable, often due to significant heterogeneity among 
studies.ObjectiveThis study aims to assess the effectiveness of CT and CR in 
these populations.MethodsFollowing PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a 
comprehensive literature search across databases including OVID, MEDLINE, 
EMBASE, and Scopus, identifying randomized controlled trials and non-randomized 
pre-post intervention studies. The Bayesian meta-analysis focused on pre-post 
changes in global cognition, quality of life, everyday functioning, and 
depression, avoiding comparisons with control groups to reduce heterogeneity 
(PROSPERO: CRD42022365038).ResultsThe search yielded 6075 results, with 40 
studies meeting inclusion criteria, encompassing 50 independent trials. CT and 
people with AD and other dementias are the best represented intervention and 
population, respectively. CT was more effective in improving global cognition in 
individuals with AD and other dementias, and paper-and-pencil and face-to-face 
formats yielded greater benefits. The analysis showed a significant 
susceptibility to bias among the studies.ConclusionsLimitations in outcome 
measure (e.g., MMSE) suggest the need for more sensitive assessments, especially 
for MCI. Future research should explore broader aspects of wellbeing and 
investigate the potential of CR. Policymakers are encouraged to consider these 
findings when designing cognitive interventions for this population.

INTRODUCTION: Cerebral microhemorrhages (CMHs) are detectable by magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI). CMHs in deep brain regions are linked to hypertensive 
vasculopathy, while those in lobar regions with amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition in 
blood vessels. This study aims to determine the association between 
anti-thrombotic treatment and CMH prevalence among cognitively asymptomatic 
adults, and to assess the role of Aβ markers, apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 carrier 
status, and cardiovascular risk factors in CMH development.
METHODS: Using baseline data from the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic 
Alzheimer's Disease (A4) and Longitudinal Evaluation of Amyloid Risk and 
Neurodegeneration (LEARN) studies, we examined CMH presence via 3T MRI, along 
with medication use, APOE ε4 carrier status, medical history, and blood 
pressure.
RESULTS: Our analysis showed a significantly higher prevalence of CMHs in the A4 
cohort (17.3%) compared to the LEARN cohort (2.6%).
DISCUSSION: Factors such as male sex, age, Aβ markers, and APOE ε4 status were 
significantly associated with higher CMH prevalence in the A4 cohort. However, 
anti-thrombotic treatment did not show association with overall CMHs.
HIGHLIGHTS: Male sex, age > 75, amyloid beta (Aβ) burden, and apolipoprotein E 
(APOE) ε4 homozygosity are significantly associated with higher prevalence of 
CMHs (cerebral microhemorrhages) in a cohort of cognitively asymptomatic 
individuals. Male sex, age > 75, Aβ burden, and APOE ε4 homozygosity are 
significantly associated with higher prevalence of lobar CMHs in a cohort of 
cognitively asymptomatic individuals. Anti-platelet or anti-coagulant usage were 
not associated with an increased prevalence of CMHs in either brain location or 
overall, in a cohort of cognitively asymptomatic individuals. History of a lipid 
disorder is associated with a higher prevalence of lobar CMHs in a cohort of 
cognitively asymptomatic individuals.

INTRODUCTION: This retrospective study investigates whether exposure to 
levodopa/carbidopa (LA/CA) medication is associated with modified Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) trajectories.
METHODS: Multivariate analysis used cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker 
information included in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Uniform 
Data Set for subjects with normal cognition (NC), mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI), and dementia (DE). Survival analyses examined the progression to MCI/DE 
and death events.
RESULTS: LA/CA use is associated with lower levels of CSF amyloid beta, 
phosphorylated-tau (p-tau) and total-tau. After adjusting for age, sex, and 
apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele presence, that effect was quantified by 
negative coefficients of the fitted linear mixed models: p-values < 0.01 in all 
cases except for p-tau in the MCI subgroup (p = 0.02). No similar effects were 
identified for other antiparkinsonians. Exposure to LA/CA decreased the 
progression from MCI to DE (p = 0.03).
DISCUSSION: The identified association between LA/CA exposure, AD biomarkers, 
and progression deserves further investigation in controlled clinical trials.
HIGHLIGHTS: LA/CA is associated with lower levels of CSF biomarkers for AD. This 
effect is not observed when other antiparkinsonian drugs are used. LA/CA is also 
associated with delayed progression to dementia by AD patients with MCI.

INTRODUCTION: Multi-etiology dementia necessitates in vivo markers of 
copathologies including misfolded α -synuclein (syn). We measured misfolded syn 
aggregates (syn-seeds) via qualitative seed amplification assays (synSAA) and 
examined relationships with markers of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was obtained from 420 participants in two AD 
risk cohorts (35% male; 91% cognitively unimpaired; mean [standard deviation] 
age, 65.42 [7.78] years; education, 16.17 [2.23]) years). synSAA results were 
compared to phosphorylated tau (T), amyloid beta (A), and clinical outcomes. 
Longitudinal cognition was modeled with mixed effects.
RESULTS: Syn positivity (synSAA+) co-occurred with T (in synSAA+ vs. synSAA-, 
36% vs. 20% T+; Pp = 0.011) and with cognitive impairment (10% vs. 7% mild 
cognitive impairment; 10% vs. 0% dementia; p = 0.00050). synSAA+ participants' 
cognitive performance declined ≈ 40% faster than synSAA- for Digit Symbol 
Substitution, but not other tests.
DISCUSSION: Findings support prevalent syn copathology in a mostly unimpaired AD 
risk cohort. Relationships with progression should be evaluated once more have 
declined.
HIGHLIGHTS: In a middle-aged sample, misfolded α -synuclein (syn) co-occurred 
with phosphorylated tau181 (T). syn+/T+ status was linked with higher levels of 
other cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers. syn+ individuals were more likely than 
syn- to be cognitively impaired. syn+ status was linked to faster decline on an 
executive function task.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) affects millions of elderly individuals 
worldwide and has been clinically recognized as one of the most significant 
disorders compromising quality of life in late-stage human development. The 
objective of this study is to systematically evaluate the influence of holistic 
nursing (HN) on patients with AD, thereby providing evidence-based references 
for clinical practice.
METHODS: A total of 105 patients with AD hospitalized in our hospital between 
January 2023 and January 2024 were enrolled for prospective analysis. Among 
them, 58 received conventional care (control group), and 47 received HN 
(observation group). Before and following the nursing interventions, both groups 
underwent assessment using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), 
Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive 
Subscale (ADAS-cog), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Self-rating 
Anxiety/Depression Scales (SAS/SDS). In addition, neurotransmitter levels and 
neuroinflammatory markers were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
and fully automated chemiluminescent immunoassay. Treatment compliance, 
incidence of adverse events, and family satisfaction were also recorded and 
compared between the two groups.
RESULTS: After nursing interventions, the observation group demonstrated 
significantly higher MMSE and MoCA scores compared to the control group. 
Conversely, NPI, ADAS-cog, SAS, and SDS scores were notably lower in the 
observation group (p < 0.05). Furthermore, neurotransmitter levels were 
significantly elevated in the observation group, while the concentrations of 
central nervous system-specific protein β (S100β) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) 
were significantly reduced (p < 0.05). Although the incidence of adverse events 
did not differ significantly between the two groups (p > 0.05), the observation 
group exhibited higher treatment compliance and greater family satisfaction (p < 
0.05).
CONCLUSION: HN effectively improves cognitive function and alleviates 
psychiatric symptoms in AD patients, supporting its recommendation for clinical 
application.

The emergence of monoclonal antibody (MABs) drugs since the FDA approval of 
lecanemab has resulted in dramatic changes in the clinical approach and 
management of early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD). Challenges with MAB adoption 
into clinical practice may vary depending on whether the institution is an 
academic/integrated healthcare organization versus a private neurological 
practice. We have combined demographic and clinical data from a high-volume East 
coast private neurology practice and a West coast academic memory clinic at 
post-MAB adoption. Combined data of N = 165 patient showed the following 
demographics: mean age 72, 67% female, 92% Caucasian, average MOCA 18/30 with 
amyloid status confirmed by CSF in 72% of patients. Overall, ARIA rates were 8% 
for ARIA-E and 7% for ARIA-H, and there were no mortalities over the observation 
period. Three patients required immediate medical attention due to ARIA 
radiographic findings associated with clinical symptoms. The private practice 
enrolled patients with lower average cognitive screening scores than the 
academic practice, but was more efficient at initiation therapy (mean # of weeks 
between diagnosis and treatment 97 versus 149 days). The average patient 
out-of-pocket cost was ($654.38) significantly less than the 20% of the annual 
drug cost as previously estimated. The findings from two separate clinical 
environments support the notion that ARIA risk associated with lecanemab is no 
greater than what was found in the CLARITY-AD trial and that the costs to the 
patient were less than predicted. This study was limited by the lack of 12 month 
efficacy data. Additional real-world data relating to the clinical effectiveness 
of MAB use in clinical practice will be necessary to best determine the 
risk/benefit ratio of these drugs in community populations.

Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) frequently coexists with Alzheimer's disease 
pathology, yet the pattern of cortical microstructural injury and its 
relationship with amyloid, tau, and cerebrovascular pathologies remains unclear. 
We applied neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) to assess 
cortical microstructural integrity in 57 individuals within the DLB spectrum and 
57 age- and sex-matched cognitively unimpaired controls by quantifying mean 
diffusivity (MD), tissue-weighted neurite density index (tNDI), orientation 
dispersion index (ODI), and free water fraction (FWF). Amyloid and tau levels 
were measured using PiB and Flortaucipir PET imaging. Compared to controls, DLB 
exhibited increased MD and FWF, reduced tNDI across multiple regions, and focal 
ODI reductions in the occipital cortex. Structural equation modeling revealed 
that APOE genotype influenced amyloid levels, which elevated tau, leading to 
microstructural injury. These findings highlight the role of AD pathology in DLB 
neurodegeneration, advocating for multi-target therapeutic approaches addressing 
both AD and DLB-specific pathologies.

Metabolites, lipids, and glycans are fundamental but interconnected classes of 
biomolecules that form the basis of the metabolic network. These molecules are 
dynamically channeled through multiple pathways that govern cellular physiology 
and pathology. Here, we present a framework for the simultaneous spatial 
analysis of the metabolome, lipidome, and glycome from a single tissue section 
using mass spectrometry imaging. This workflow integrates a computational 
platform, the Spatial Augmented Multiomics Interface (Sami), which enables 
multiomics integration, high-dimensional clustering, spatial anatomical mapping 
of matched molecular features, and metabolic pathway enrichment. To demonstrate 
the utility of this approach, we applied Sami to evaluate metabolic diversity 
across distinct brain regions and to compare wild-type and Ps19 Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) mouse models. Our findings reveal region-specific metabolic demands 
in the normal brain and highlight metabolic dysregulation in the Ps19 model, 
providing insights into the biochemical alterations associated with 
neurodegeneration.

Long-term reliability of microelectrodes implanted in the cortex is hindered due 
to the foreign body response that occurs at the electrode-tissue interface. 
Following implantation, there is disruption of the blood-brain-barrier and 
vasculature, resulting in activation of immune cells and release of 
erythrocytes. As a result of hemolysis, erythrocytes degrade to heme and then to 
free iron. Excess free iron can participate in the Fenton Reaction, producing 
reactive oxygen species (ROS). Iron-mediated ROS production can contribute to 
oxidation of lipids, proteins, and DNA, facilitating a hostile environment of 
oxidative stress leading to oxidative cellular damage, cytotoxicity, and cell 
death. The objective of this study was to show the iron accumulation and the 
downstream effects of oxidative stress at the injury site. A 16-channel 
microelectrode array (MEA) was implanted in the rat somatosensory cortex. Our 
results indicated significant elevation of NOX complex subunits across 
timepoints, suggesting sustained oxidative stress. In a separate group of 
animals, we administered an iron chelator, deferoxamine mesylate (DFX), to 
evaluate the effects of chelation on iron accumulation, oxidative stress and 
damage, and neuronal survival. Results indicate that animals with iron chelation 
showed reduced ferric iron and markers of oxidative stress and damage 
corresponding with increased expression of neuronal cell bodies and 
electrophysiological functional performance. In summary, the study reveals the 
role of iron in mediating oxidative stress and the effects of modulating iron 
levels using iron chelation at the electrode-tissue interface. STATEMENT OF 
SIGNIFICANCE: Iron accumulation has been observed in central nervous system 
injuries and in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's 
disease. While the role of iron is studied in various neurodegenerative diseases 
and traumatic brain injury, iron accumulation and its effect on oxidative stress 
is not known for intracortical implants where there is a persistent injury due 
to the presence of a foreign device in the brain tissue. The study seeks to 
understand the effects of iron accumulation on oxidative stress and damage at 
the electrode-tissue interface in intracortical implants by using iron chelation 
as a method of modulating iron levels at the interface.

BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a life-threatening disease 
characterised by progressive loss of motor neurons with few therapeutic options. 
The MIROCALS study tested the hypothesis that low-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2LD) 
improves survival and function in ALS.
METHODS: In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, male and 
female riluzole-naive participants, with either a possible, laboratory-supported 
probable, probable, or definite ALS diagnosis (revised El Escorial criteria), 
aged 18-76 years, with symptom duration of 24 months or fewer, and slow vital 
capacity of 70% or more, underwent a riluzole-only 12-18 week run-in period 
before randomisation in a 1:1 ratio to either 2 million international units 
(MIU) IL-2LD or placebo by subcutaneous injection daily for 5 days every 28 days 
over 18 months. The primary endpoint was survival at 640 days (21 months). 
Secondary outcomes included safety, ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised 
(ALSFRS-R) score, and biomarker measurements including regulatory T-cells 
(Tregs), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-phosphorylated-neurofilament heavy-chain 
(CSF-pNFH), and plasma and CSF-chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2). The primary endpoint 
analysis used unadjusted log-rank and Cox's model adjusted analyses using 
pre-defined prognostic covariates to control for the disease and treatment 
response heterogeneity. The study was 80% powered to detect a two-fold decrease 
in the risk of death by the log-rank test in the intention-to-treat (ITT) 
population, including all randomly allocated participants. MIROCALS is 
registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03039673) and is complete.
FINDINGS: From June 19, 2017, to Oct 16, 2019, 304 participants were screened, 
of whom 220 (72%) met all criteria for random allocation after the 12-to-18-week 
run-in period on riluzole. 136 (62%) of participants were male and 84 
participants (38%) were female. 25 (11%) of the 220 randomly allocated 
participants were defined as having possible ALS under El Escorial criteria. At 
the cutoff date there was no loss to follow-up, and all 220 patients who were 
randomly allocated were documented as either deceased (90 [41%]) or alive (130 
[59%]), so all participants were included in the ITT and safety populations. The 
primary endpoint unadjusted analysis showed a non-significant 19% decrease in 
risk of death with IL-2LD (hazard ratio 0·81 [95% CI 0·54-1·22], p=0·33), 
failing to demonstrate the expected two-fold decrease in risk of death. The 
analysis of the primary endpoint adjusted on prognostic covariates, all measured 
at time of random allocation, showed a significant decrease of the risk of death 
with IL-2LD (0·32 [0·14-0·73], p=0·007), with a significant treatment by 
CSF-pNFH interaction (1·0003 [1·0001-1·0005], p=0·001). IL-2LD was safe, and 
significantly increased Tregs and decreased plasma-CCL2 at all timepoints. 
Stratification on CSF-pNFH levels measured at random allocation showed that 
IL-2LD was associated with a significant 48% decrease in risk of death (0·52 
[0·30-0·89], p=0·016) in the 70% of the population with low (750-3700 pg/mL) 
CSF-pNFH levels, while in the 21% with high levels (>3700 pg/mL), there was no 
significant difference (1·37 [0·68-2·75], p=0·38).
INTERPRETATION: With this treatment schedule, IL-2LD resulted in a 
non-significant reduction in mortality in the primary unadjusted analysis. 
However, the difference between the results of unadjusted and adjusted analyses 
of the primary endpoint emphasises the importance of controlling for disease 
heterogeneity in ALS randomised controlled trials. The decrease in risk of death 
achieved by IL-2LD therapy in the trial population with low CSF-pNFH levels 
requires further investigation of the potential benefit of this therapy in ALS.

IMPORTANCE: Two monoclonal antibodies targeting amyloid plaques, lecanemab and 
donanemab, have received traditional US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
approval for the treatment of early symptomatic Alzheimer disease (AD). The most 
significant adverse events associated with these therapies are infusion-related 
reactions and amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) with edema/effusion 
(ARIA-E) and/or hemorrhage/hemosiderin deposition (ARIA-H). The feasibility and 
safety of providing these treatments in clinical practice is unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the feasibility and safety of treating patients in 
specialty memory clinics with lecanemab.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective analysis of consecutive 
patients in whom lecanemab was initiated between August 1, 2023, and October 1, 
2024, at Washington University Memory Diagnostic Center, an outpatient specialty 
memory clinic. Lecanemab was initiated in 234 patients with early symptomatic 
AD. Eligibility was based on the FDA label and appropriate use recommendations 
with occasional exceptions.
EXPOSURE: Patients were treated with lecanemab, 10 mg/kg, intravenously every 2 
weeks.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Infusion-related reactions, ARIA, and withdrawal 
from treatment were assessed.
RESULTS: The 234 patients treated with lecanemab had a mean age of 74.4 (SD, 
6.7) years, 117 were female (50%), and 117 were male (50%). Infusion-related 
reactions occurred in 87 patients (37%) and were typically mild. Of the 194 
patients at risk for ARIA during the study period, 44 had at least 1 
microhemorrhage and/or superficial siderosis before initiation of lecanemab 
(23%). Over an average treatment period of 6.5 months, 42 total patients (22%) 
developed ARIA; 29 developed ARIA-E with or without ARIA-H (15%) and 13 
developed isolated ARIA-H (6.7%). Eleven patients (5.7%) developed symptomatic 
ARIA, 2 of those patients (1.0%) with clinically severe symptoms. No patients 
developed a macrohemorrhage or died. Patients with mild dementia had a 27% rate 
of symptomatic ARIA; those with mild cognitive impairment or very mild dementia 
had a 1.8% rate. Overall, 23 of 234 patients (9.8%) withdrew from treatment for 
various reasons, 10 for ARIA (4.3%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A single-specialty memory clinic initiated lecanemab 
treatment in 234 patients over 14 months. The frequency of significant adverse 
events, including ARIA, was manageable. These results may inform discussions 
about the risks of anti-amyloid treatments.

Conventional drugs for Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment often suffer from low 
bioavailability due to the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In this investigation, we 
developed a dual-brain targeting protein-based drug delivery system for 
nose-to-brain drug delivery. The dual-brain targeting drug delivery system, 
Donepezil@Tf/cRGD-CS, was prepared using a simple self-assembly method. 
Donepezil was encapsulated in transferrin (Tf) nanoparticles, which were 
decorated with cRGD-conjugated chitosan (cRGD-CS), enabling dual-targeted drug 
delivery. Due to the specific interactions between Tf and the transferrin 
receptor (TfR) as well as cRGD and integrins, Donepezil@Tf/cRGD-CS exhibited 
enhanced BBB penetration as well as improved cellular uptake by brain neurons. 
An in vitro BBB model confirmed the enhanced permeability of the dual-targeted 
drug-loaded nanoparticles across the BBB. Compared to free donepezil, 
Donepezil@Tf/cRGD-CS nanoparticles significantly improved therapeutic outcomes, 
including reduced neurotoxicity induced by Aβ25-35 and downregulation of 
apoptosis-related proteins and Tau proteins. This study offers an effective 
strategy for improving the therapeutic outcomes of central nervous system 
diseases.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with hyperglycaemia and amyloid beta (Aβ) 
accumulation. In the present study, we investigated whether an aqueous extract 
of Cuscuta chinensis Lam. (CCWE) improved cognitive disorder in a hyperglycaemic 
and cognitive-impaired mouse model. Hyperglycaemia was induced by streptozotocin 
(STZ, 50 mg/kg) and a single intracerebroventricular injection of Aβ25-35 
(25 nM) was performed. The Aβ25-35-injected hyperglycaemic mice were then 
administered CCWE (100 or 200 mg/kg/day) for 14-d. The protective effects of the 
CCWE were evaluated by behavioural tests and western blot analysis. The 
bioactive compounds in CCWE were isolated by UPLC-QTOF/MS analysis. The 
administration of CCWE improved the learning and memory function in 
STZ/Aβ25-35-injected mice. Moreover, CCWE positively regulated the amyloidogenic 
pathway-related proteins and insulin signalling-related proteins. The bioactive 
components in CCWE were also identified. These findings suggest the possibility 
of CCWE as a potential candidate for the dual-targeting treatment of 
hyperglycaemia and AD.

Fine-Tuning Ferroptosis by Modulating GPX4 and Its Potential in Mitigating 
Neuronal Degeneration in Parkinson's Disease.

The increasing prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases necessitates the 
development of novel approaches to study, diagnose, and treat these devastating 
disorders. Accordingly, there is a critical need to precisely address the gap in 
the biochemical and physiological mechanisms that underlie neurodegenerative 
diseases to promote advancements in therapeutic interventions. Parkinson's 
Disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after 
Alzheimer's, demands further research focused on unravelling the rather 
intricate molecular mechanisms that drive its progression upon different cell 
signaling cues. While alpha-synuclein aggregation and mitochondrial dysfunction 
are two cellular hallmarks of the molecular pathophysiology of PD, few drugs are 
currently in clinical trials for treatment of PD, which warrants further studies 
to identify new therapeutic molecular targets. Herein, we briefly highlight some 
of the reported roles of ferroptosis, a modality of cell death that is driven by 
iron-dependent phospholipid peroxidation, and its regulation by glutathione 
peroxidase 4 (GPX4). We discuss the interconnectedness between lipid 
peroxidation and GPX4 regulation in the context of molecular pathogenesis of PD. 
 Future studies are imperative in investigating the physiological role of 
ferroptosis and the translational impact of ferroptosis-specific modulators in 
studying PD biology.

Central nervous system (CNS) diseases, including ischemic stroke (IS), 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD), are leading causes of 
global disability and mortality, characterized by progressive neuronal loss and 
irreversible neural circuit damage. Despite advances in understanding their 
pathophysiology, therapeutic options remain limited due to the complexity of 
disease mechanisms and challenges in delivering treatments across the 
blood-brain barrier (BBB). In this context, astrocyte reprogramming has emerged 
as a groundbreaking strategy for neural repair. By leveraging the plasticity of 
astrocytes, researchers have demonstrated the potential to convert these glial 
cells into functional neurons, offering a novel approach to replenish lost 
neurons and restore neural function. This review explores the latest 
advancements in astrocyte reprogramming, focusing on transcription 
factor-mediated, miRNA-induced, and small molecule-based strategies, as well as 
the molecular mechanisms underlying this process. We also discuss the 
therapeutic potential of astrocyte reprogramming in CNS diseases, including IS, 
AD, PD, and other neurodegenerative disorders, while addressing the challenges 
and future directions for clinical translation. Through a systematic analysis of 
recent studies, this review highlights the promise of astrocyte reprogramming as 
a transformative therapeutic strategy for CNS repair, providing new hope for 
patients with debilitating neurological conditions.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe neurodegenerative disorder with a growing 
global burden. With the rising incidence of AD, the need for novel therapeutic 
targets has become increasingly critical. TREM2, a receptor expressed on 
microglial cells, plays a crucial role in modulating neuroinflammation and 
clearing pathological substrates, making it a promising candidate for AD 
therapy. However, the recent clinical trial INVOKE-2 failed to demonstrate 
significant clinical benefits of the TREM2-targeted antibody AL002, raising 
doubts about the efficacy of TREM2-targeted methods. This article examines the 
role of TREM2 in AD pathogenesis, evaluates potential reasons for the 
disappointing outcomes of the INVOKE-2 trial, and discusses future directions 
for TREM2-based therapies. Factors such as treatment timing, dosage 
optimization, patient genetic variability, and combination therapy strategies 
are identified as critical determinants of therapeutic success. Future studies 
should aim to refine treatment strategies, identify precise indications, and 
explore the potential for combination therapies to enhance efficacy.

INTRODUCTION: Neuroinflammation may have sex-specific effects on white matter 
injury and impact the development of dementia.
METHODS: Human chitinase-3-like protein-1 (YKL-40) concentrations at baseline 
were related to white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume, free water (FW), and 
FW-corrected fractional anisotropy using linear effects models (for 
cross-sectional outcomes) and linear mixed-effects models (for longitudinal 
outcomes), adjusting for demographic and medical risk factors. Models were 
repeated with a sex-interaction term and then stratified by sex.
RESULTS: In stratified analyses, greater baseline YKL-40 concentrations were 
associated with increased WMHs in females but not males in the parietal (females 
p = 0.04; males p = .34) and temporal lobes (females p = 0.005; 
males = p = 0.71) longitudinally. YKL-40 associations with FW and FW-corrected 
fractional anisotropy were null.
DISCUSSION: Results suggest that neuroinflammation is a sex-specific driver of 
WMHs (but not FW) in females. Differential sequelae of neuroinflammation may be 
one reason that females have a greater burden of WMHs.
HIGHLIGHTS: ·Cerebrospinal fluid YKL-40 is associated with white matter 
hyperintensities in females but not males cross-sectionally and 
longitudinally.·Longitudinally, cerebrospinal fluid YKL-40 is associated with 
white matter hyperintensities in the parietal and temporal lobes, regions that 
exhibit early pathological changes in Alzheimer's disease .·Cerebrospinal fluid 
YKL-40 is not associated with white matter microstructural measures.

INTRODUCTION: Little is known about plasma phosphorylated tau 217 (p-tau217) in 
individuals without a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We studied 
associations of plasma p-tau217 with age, sex, education, and genetic risk; 
estimated the heritability; and conducted a genome-wide association study 
(GWAS).
METHODS: A population-based biobank recall study of 65- to 85-year-old twins 
(N = 697, mean [SD] age 76.2 [4.6] years; 53% women, 154 full pairs) excluding 
those with AD based on health registry data.
RESULTS: Higher p-tau217 level and likelihood of AD neuropathologic change 
(p-tau217 > 0.42 pg/mL; evident in 39%) were associated with higher age and 
having an apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele. Heritability was 0.56 (95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 0.36-0.79) and GWAS indicated 45 single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) (p < 5 × 10-08) centered around the APOE locus.
DISCUSSION: Our results elucidate the characteristics and genetic associations 
of p-tau217 in a population-based setting. We found many 65- to 85-year-olds 
without a clinical diagnosis of AD to have AD neuropathologic change based on 
plasma p-tau217.
HIGHLIGHTS: Plasma phosphorylated tau 217 (p-tau217) is a promising biomarker of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD).We studied plasma p-tau217 in a population-based sample 
of 65- to -85-year-olds.We excluded those with a clinical diagnosis of AD.Older 
age and having an apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele were associated with higher 
plasma p-tau217.Heritability of p-tau217 was 56% and a genome-wide association 
study (GWAS) implicated genes around the APOE region.

INTRODUCTION: Many longitudinal Alzheimer's disease studies fail to retain Black 
American adults once enrolled. This limits the generalizability of research 
findings.
METHODS: The Community-Engaged Digital Alzheimer's Research (CEDAR) study 
developed digital, culturally-informed, community-engaged efforts to increase 
longitudinal registry task completion of Black American Brain Health Registry 
(BHR) participants. Difference-in-differences analysis was conducted to compare 
longitudinal registry task completion rates within groups (before vs. after 
CEDAR referral) and between groups (enrolled in CEDAR vs. not enrolled).
RESULTS: Of 3888 invited Black American BHR participants, 420 (10.8%) enrolled 
in CEDAR. For CEDAR participants, we found significant increases in enrollment 
rate into referral studies and BHR timepoint completion rate after enrollment 
into CEDAR. Compared to those not enrolled, CEDAR participants had higher rates 
of: enrollment in referral studies, timepoint completion, initial questionnaire 
completion, and neuropsychological test completion.
DISCUSSION: The results provide preliminary evidence that CEDAR's 
culturally-informed, community-engaged research efforts were effective at 
improving engagement of Black American adults in an online longitudinal study. 
This is evidenced by increased registry engagement before and after enrollment 
and in comparison to Black American BHR participants not enrolled in CEDAR. 
These results need to be interpreted cautiously due to selection biases. This 
strategy can be adapted to other studies and settings.
HIGHLIGHTS: CEDAR is an online AD/ADRD registry engagement intervention for 
Black participants.The intervention is community-engaged, digital, 
culturally-informed, and multifaceted.Engagement rates increased before versus 
during the intervention for enrollees.Engagement rates decreased over the same 
time period for non-enrolled participants.Results need to be interpreted with 
caution due to selection biases.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common progressive and irreversible 
neurodegenerative disease. AD accounts for 60%-70% of all dementia cases, 
ranking as the seventh leading cause of death globally. Human umbilical cord 
mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) characterized by their abundant availability 
and low immunogenicity, have demonstrated significant therapeutic potential for 
AD in both preclinical studies and clinical trials. The use of exosomes can help 
mitigate the issues associated with cellular therapies. However, the clinical 
application of hUC-MSCs remains challenging due to their inability to 
effectively traverse the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and reach pathological sites. 
Therapeutic strategies utilizing exosomes derived from hUC-MSCs (Exos) have 
emerged as an effective approach for AD intervention.
METHODS: Here, we used ultrasound to construct multifunctional Exos 
(MsEVB@R/siRNA) for AD therapy. We obtained small interfering RNA for β-site 
precursor protein lyase-1 (BACE1 siRNA) and berberine for co-delivery into the 
brain. Berberine, a classical anti-inflammatory agent, effectively alleviates 
neuroinflammation in AD pathogenesis. BACE1 serves as the pivotal cleavage 
enzyme in amyloid β-protein (Aβ) formation, where silencing BACE1 synthesis 
through BACE1 siRNA significantly reduces Aβ production. In a 5xFAD mouse model, 
Exos selectively targeted microglial and neuronal cells after nasal delivery 
under the action of neural cell-targeting peptide rabies virus glycoprotein 29 
(RVG29).
RESULTS: BACE1 siRNA and berberine (BBR) loading enhanced the effectiveness of 
Exos in improving cognitive function, promoting nerve repair and regeneration, 
reducing inflammatory cytokine expression, and suppressing glial responses. 
BACE1 siRNA release was confirmed to reduce BACE1 expression and Aβ deposition. 
Concurrently, berberine effectively suppressed the release of inflammatory 
factors, thereby reducing neuroinflammation.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the nasal delivery of engineered exosomes is a 
potentially effective method for treating AD.

BACKGROUND: Pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma (PSC) is rare among lung 
malignancies, but it has a high degree of malignancy, and the average survival 
time for clinically diagnosed patients with PSC is less than 1 year. There are 
few reports of multiple solid spherical metastases in the lungs of patients with 
PSC.
CASE PRESENTATION: This case presents an 80-year-old male with a history of 
Alzheimer's disease who was hospitalized due to a frequent dry cough. A 16-slice 
computed tomography examination of the chest revealed multiple solid, egg-sized 
lesions with smooth borders in both lungs. Because this type of medical imaging 
data is very rare in clinical practice, the patient's diagnosis was initially 
confusing. Given that the patient had no history of fever and no special 
abnormalities in the results of laboratory tests, the multidisciplinary team 
(MDT) suggested that lung metastases or lung malignancies with intrapulmonary 
metastasis should be considered. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination 
of the head was performed and revealed brain metastatic lesion. Finally, a 
puncture biopsy of the lung lesion was performed under ultrasound guidance. The 
case results confirmed PSC.
CONCLUSION: This case presents a very rare medical imaging dataset of solid 
lesions with multiple egg-sized having smooth borders in both lungs. This 
special medical imaging data highlights the variability of PSC imaging and the 
complexity of accurate diagnosis, aiming to improve the understanding of PSC.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, 
currently has no effective cure. Epimedii Folium (EF), a traditional Chinese 
medicine known as Yin-yang-huo, has demonstrated significant neuroprotective 
properties.
METHODS: In this study, neural stem cells overexpressing the APPswe gene 
(APP-NSCs) were used as an in vitro AD model. The CCK-8, LDH, neurosphere 
formation, and BrdU incorporation assays were employed to identify the most 
effective bioactive metabolite of EF in promoting NSC proliferation. 
Subsequently, JC-1 staining, ATP quantification, and ROS assays were conducted 
to evaluate the protective effects of Icariside II (ICS II)-identified as the 
most effective metabolite-on mitochondrial function. APP/PS1 transgenic mice 
received an oral administration of 10 mg/kg ICS II for 7 weeks. Cognitive 
function was assessed using the Morris water maze and nest-building tests, while 
H&E and Nissl staining were used to evaluate brain tissue pathology. 
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) examined the ultrastructural integrity of 
hippocampal neurons, immunofluorescence assessed hippocampal neurogenesis, and 
Western blotting quantified proteins involved in mitochondrial dynamics. 
Additionally, Rotenone (Rot), a mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibitor, was 
applied to disrupt mitochondrial function, allowing an evaluation of whether the 
neurogenesis-promoting effect of ICS II depends on maintaining mitochondrial 
structure and function.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The results demonstrated that ICS II exhibited the 
strongest capacity to promote APP-NSC proliferation (P < 0.01, η2 = 0.845), 
followed by Icariin and Icaritin. ICS II treatment significantly ameliorated 
cognitive deficits (P < 0.01, η2 = 0.883), neuronal damage, and impairments in 
neurogenesis in adult APP/PS1 mice. Moreover, ICS II rescued mitochondrial 
damage by upregulating fusion proteins (Mfn1 and Mfn2) and downregulating 
fission proteins (p-Drp1/Drp1 and Mff); however, these protective effects were 
negated by Rot administration. In conclusion, this study identifies ICS II as 
one of the most effective metabolites of EF, promoting hippocampal neurogenesis 
and alleviating mitochondrial dysfunction in APP/PS1 mice, thereby offering 
promising therapeutic potential for AD.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative disease of the central 
nervous system characterized by progressive cognitive impairment and memory 
loss. Chinese medicine's therapeutic effect on AD has become a promising 
treatment option in recent years, and the Chinese herbal compound Kai Xin 
San-Jia Wei (KXSJW) is one of its representatives. This study employed a 
comprehensive approach, including 16S rRNA and Gaschromatography-mass 
spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis, to investigate the therapeutic efficacy and 
intrinsic mechanism of KXSJW on AD.
METHODS: 50 3-month-old APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice were randomly divided into 
5 groups (n = 10): model group (M), donepezil group (Don), KXSJW-low dose group 
(KJW-L), KXSJW- medium dose group (KJW-M), KXSJW-high dose group (KJW-H), Ten 
3-month-old C57BL/6 J wild-type mice were randomly selected as the control group 
(C). The control and model groups were administered saline by gavage, the 
donepezil group was administered donepezil (0.92 mg/kg/d), and the 
KXSJW-low/medium/high dose group was administered KXSJW extract 
(0.9/1.8/3.6 mL/kg/d); each group was treated once daily for 2 months. The study 
employed the Morris Water Maze (MWM) to evaluate learning and cognitive 
abilities. Pathological changes in colon tissue were assessed through 
hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. Analysis of gut microbiota was conducted 
using 16S rRNA sequencing, and gut microbial metabolite (short chain fatty 
acids, SCFAs) content was detected using GC-MS. Colonic tissue barrier integrity 
was examined through immunohistochemistry and western blot, while β-amyloid 
deposition in brain tissue was assessed. ELISA was used to measure serum 
intestinal peptide hormones (Glucagon, GHRP-Ghrelin).
RESULTS: KXSJW enhanced learning ability and memory, reduced amyloid deposition 
in the brain tissue of AD model mice. KXSJW was able to restore the balance of 
intestinal flora and regulate the concentration of intestinal flora metabolites, 
especially represented by Firmicutes and its major metabolite butyric acid. 
Meanwhile, KXSJW restored the intestinal barrier function and improved the 
release level of intestinal peptide hormones (Glucagon, GHRP-Ghrelin) in AD 
model mice. This indicates that KXSJW can improve the intestinal internal 
environment of AD model mice.
CONCLUSION: KXSJW may improve the homeostasis of the gut environment in AD, with 
a focus on the regulation of gut microorganisms and their metabolites, and 
subsequently improve cognitive impairment in AD. Traditional Chinese Medicine 
(TCM) has the potential to intervene in AD through multilevel interaction with 
the brain-gut-axis.

Essential Tremor is a common movement disorder characterized by postural and 
kinetic tremor, primarily affecting the upper limbs, head and voice. For 
patients who fail medical therapy, neurosurgical interventions such as 
thalamotomy have been explored. This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of 
bilateral staged Magnetic Resonance Imaging-guided High-Intensity Focused 
Ultrasound thalamotomy for the treatment of medication-refractory Essential 
Tremor. From January 2022 to January 2024, 20 patients who had previously 
undergone successful unilateral focused ultrasound thalamotomy were enrolled. 
The primary outcome was the change in tremor severity, using the Clinical Rating 
Scale for Tremor at 6 months post-second side thalamotomy. Secondary outcomes 
included functional disability, quality of life and adverse events, particularly 
balance and gait impairments. Results demonstrated significant tremor reduction, 
with a 59.98% decrease in Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor A + B score from 
baseline to 6 months after the second thalamotomy. Quality of life also improved 
markedly, with an 84.91% reduction in disability and significant enhancement in 
physical and psychosocial aspects of quality of life. Adverse events were 
predominantly mild; with subjective gait instability and paresthaesia being the 
most common. Notably, no cases of severe ataxia or cognitive impairment were 
observed. Bilateral staged Magnetic Resonance Imaging-guided High-Intensity 
Focused Ultrasound thalamotomy is an effective and safe treatment for 
medication-refractory Essential Tremor, providing substantial tremor relief and 
improved quality of life with manageable side effects. These findings support 
its use as an alternative to more invasive neurosurgical procedures, especially 
in carefully selected patients.

BACKGROUND: With the introduction of disease-modifying treatments for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), less invasive and widely accessible screening tests 
are urgently needed. We assessed eight blood-based biomarkers in a well-defined 
cohort of preclinical AD, including participants with subjective cognitive 
decline (SCD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
METHODS: Amyloid beta (Aβ) oligomerization tendency, Aβ42, Aβ40, Aβ42/Aβ40 
ratio, phosphorylated tau (p-tau)181, p-tau217, glial fibrillary acidic protein 
(GFAP), and neurofilament light (Nf-L) were assessed for distinguishing between 
SCD and MCI, for correlations, and for predicting Aβ positron emission 
tomography (PET) positivity.
RESULTS: Plasma p-tau181, p-tau217, and GFAP levels were significantly higher in 
participants with MCI than in those with SCD (P >0.05) and in Aβ PET-positive 
versus Aβ PET-negative participants (P >0.0001), whereas plasma Aβ42 and Aβ42/40 
ratio levels were significantly lower in Aβ PET-positive than in Aβ PET-negative 
participants (P >0.001). Logistic regression analysis revealed that plasma Aβ42 
and p-tau217 levels predicted Aβ PET positivity with an area under the ROC curve 
(AUC) of 0.930 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.848-0.976) in the entire cohort, 
and p-tau217 alone predicted Aβ PET-positivity with an AUC of 0.887 (95% CI, 
0.779-0.954) in the MCI subgroup.
CONCLUSIONS: Plasma p-tau217 levels outperform plasma p-tau181 levels in 
predicting Aβ PET-positivity in participants with preclinical AD. Plasma GFAP 
levels, along with different p-tau isoforms (p-tau181 and p-tau217), effectively 
differentiate MCI from SCD. The predictive accuracy of blood-based biomarkers 
for Aβ PET-positivity strongly supports their clinical implementation, 
particularly with the introduction of disease-modifying therapies.

The prevalence of cognitive disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) is 
increasing due to the global rise in longevity. The accumulation of amyloid β 
(Aβ) deposits and hyperphosphorylated Tau protein (p-Tau) are considered the 
main hallmarks of AD. A growing body of evidence suggests that the regular 
intake of flavonoid-rich foods could reduce the risk of developing AD or 
mitigate its progression. This study explores the potential of quercetin (Q) and 
epicatechin (EC) as effective molecules against AD-like pathology, using the 
Caenorhabditis elegans BR5270 strain, which expresses the pro-aggregant F3DK280 
fragment of the human Tau protein. The results showed that after exposure to 
150 µM of EC or Q, worms exhibited increased lifespan, improved chemotaxis, and 
delayed age-related decline in locomotion. To explore the molecular mechanisms 
involved, the expression of genes associated with the inhibition of p-Tau 
proteotoxicity were measured by RT-qPCR. It was found that Q and EC 
significantly increased the expression levels of autophagy-related genes and of 
a key gene for de novo synthesis of α- tubulin. EC and Q delay neurodegeneration 
in the C. elegans tauopathy model, suggesting their potential to reduce the risk 
of AD progression.

OBJECTIVE: Suicidal ideation has not been extensively studied in spinocerebellar 
ataxias (SCAs). The authors examined whether individuals with SCAs have 
increased suicidal ideation and related factors.
METHODS: The authors studied patients with genetically confirmed SCAs enrolled 
in the Clinical Research Consortium for the Study of Cerebellar Ataxia cohort, 
examining the percentages of patients with SCA subtypes 1, 2, 3, and 6 who 
reported suicidal ideation and comparing findings with nationally representative 
data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). Clinical 
characteristics that may contribute to suicidal ideation in SCAs, including age, 
disease duration, sex, ataxia severity, depression, and SCA subtype, were also 
studied.
RESULTS: Suicidal ideation was present among 12% of 769 patients with SCAs and 
4.3% of individuals in the general population recorded in the NSDUH. Compared 
with individuals in the general population, SCA patients had higher odds of 
suicidal ideation (OR=2.72). Compared with patients with SCA without suicidal 
ideation, patients with SCA and suicidal ideation had a longer disease duration 
(mean±SD=13.1±8.2 years vs. 11.2±9.4 years), more severe ataxia (Scale for the 
Assessment and Rating of Ataxia mean score=15.9±8.6 vs. 12.9±7.6), and more 
severe depression. Having suicidal ideation at baseline significantly increased 
the odds of suicidality later in the disease course (OR=58.73, 95% 
CI=36.00-98.40).
CONCLUSIONS: Suicidal ideation was more prevalent among patients with SCAs than 
in the general population. The findings of this study underscore the importance 
of continuous suicidal risk screening among individuals with SCAs and the need 
for effective depression management.

Alzheimer's disease(AD) has a high incidence rate and insidious onset, and it is 
the main type of senile dementia, severely affecting the survival and death of 
patients. The main clinical manifestations include memory loss, aphasia, 
apraxias, agnosia, and changes in executive dysfunction, personality, and 
behaviors, and its pathogenesis is not yet clear. In recent years, there has 
been an increasing number of traditional Chinese medicine treatments for AD, 
including Chinese herbal compounds, external treatments of traditional Chinese 
medicine(TCM), and a combination of TCM and Western medicine, with significant 
efficacy and no obvious toxic side effects. Starting from the understanding of 
the pathogenesis of AD in TCM, this article comprehensively summarized the 
theoretical basis of TCM in treating the disease, providing a theoretical basis 
for clinical research.

This study aims to investigate the effect of Congrong San(CRS) on endoplasmic 
reticulum stress-induced neuroinflammation in the rat model of Aβ_(1-42)-induced 
Alzheimer's disease(AD). Sixty male Sprague-Dawley rats(2 months old) were 
randomized into blank(CON), model(MOD), low-dose Congrong San(L-CRS), 
medium-dose Congrong San(M-CRS), high-dose Congrong San(H-CRS), and memantine 
hydrochloride(MJG) groups. The Morris water maze test was carried out to examine 
the learning and memory abilities of rats in each group. Hematoxylin-eosin 
staining and Nissl staining were employed to observe the morphology and number 
of CA1 neurons in the hippocampus of rats in each group. The morphology and 
structure of the endoplasmic reticulum in the hippocampus were observed by 
transmission electron microscopy. The immunofluorescence assay was employed to 
detect the expression of 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein(GRP78) in the 
hippocampus. Western blot was employed to determine the expression of 
apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD(ASC), cysteinyl 
aspartate-specific proteinase(caspase-1), interleukin-18(IL-18), 
interleukin-1β(IL-1β), GRP78, and pathway proteins including protein kinase 
RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase(PERK), phosphorylated PERK(p-PERK), C/EBP 
homologous protein(CHOP), and NOD-like receptor pyrin domain-containing protein 
3(NLRP3) in the rat hippocampus. Compared with the MOD group, the M-CRS and 
H-CRS groups showed improved learning and memory abilities, reduced neuron 
losses in the hippocampus, alleviated endoplasmic reticulum stress, inhibited 
PERK-CHOP-NLRP3 pathway, and lowered levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis 
factor-alpha(TNF-α). The results suggest that CRS can alleviate cognitive 
impairment and hippocampal neuron damage and reduce neuroinflammation in AD rats 
by alleviating endoplasmic reticulum stress to inhibit the activation of NLRP3 
inflammasomes.

Causative genes associated with Mendelian-inherited subtypes of hereditary 
dementia with Mendelian inheritance have been identified. However, the clinical 
diagnosis of hereditary dementia remains challenging due to the substantial 
overlap among subtypes and diverse clinical presentations. A definitive 
diagnosis can be established when genetic testing detects a pathogenic variant 
in the corresponding gene. Biomarker changes indicative of pathological brain 
alterations, even before symptom onset, have been identified in dominantly 
inherited Alzheimer's disease and hereditary frontotemporal dementia. Against 
this background, clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate 
disease-modifying drugs, including anti-amyloid-β and anti-tau antibodies, as 
well as gene therapy for hereditary dementias.

Herpes Zoster (HZ), caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus 
(VZV), is a common infectious disease. Recent studies suggest a potential 
association between HZ and the development of dementia, particularly Alzheimer's 
disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. Epidemiological evidence 
indicates that HZ infection, especially in individuals with central nervous 
system involvement, may increase the risk of dementia. Pathologically, VZV may 
contribute to neuronal dysfunction and degeneration by inducing chronic 
neuroinflammation, infection-related cerebrovascular lesions, and direct central 
nervous system toxicity. HZ vaccines, particularly novel recombinant subunit 
vaccines (e.g., Shingrix), not only effectively prevent HZ but may also confer 
cognitive protection through mechanisms such as "trained immunity" activation 
and anti-inflammatory response modulation. Multiple natural experiments and 
retrospective cohort studies have found that HZ vaccination is significantly 
associated with a reduced risk of dementia, with particularly pronounced 
protective effects in women and older adults. Although most evidence currently 
stems from observational studies and is subject to potential confounding 
factors, the biological plausibility and consistent findings support the 
potential of HZ vaccination as an adjunctive strategy for dementia prevention. 
Future prospective randomized controlled trials are needed to further clarify 
the causal relationship and underlying neuroimmune mechanisms, providing a 
stronger evidence base for establishing scientific vaccination strategies for 
older adults and dementia prevention systems.

Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's 
disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis pose 
significant challenges due to their complex pathophysiology and lack of 
effective treatments. Green tea, rich in the epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) 
polyphenolic component, has demonstrated potential as a neuroprotective agent 
with numerous medicinal applications. EGCG effectively reduces tau and Aβ 
aggregation in ND models, promotes autophagy, and targets key signaling pathways 
like Nrf2-ARE, NF-κB, and MAPK. This review explores the molecular processes 
that underlie EGCG's neuroprotective properties, including its ability to 
regulate mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and 
protein misfolding. Clinical research indicates that EGCG may enhance cognitive 
and motor abilities, potentially inhibiting disease progression despite 
absorption and dose optimization limitations. The substance has been proven to 
slow the amyloidogenic process, prevent protein aggregation, decrease amyloid 
cytotoxicity, inhibit fibrillogenesis, and restructure fibrils for synergistic 
therapeutic effects. The review highlights the potential of EGCG as a natural, 
multi-targeted strategy for NDs but emphasizes the need for further clinical 
trials to enhance its therapeutic efficacy.

Dopamine is involved in many physiological functions including reward 
phenomenon, motor, learning, and memory functions. Dopamine receptor agonists 
have been shown to reduce amyloid (Aβ) deposition, enhance memory, and improve 
cortical plasticity in experimental studies and Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
patients; however, the molecular mechanisms involved haven't been investigated 
yet. The target of this investigation was to elucidate the modulatory effects of 
cabergoline (CAB), a dopamine receptor agonist, against AD. Ovariectomized rats 
were injected with D-galactose (150 mg/kg/day, i.p) for ten weeks to exacerbate 
AD. CAB administration (1 mg/kg/day, i.p) for 28 days, beginning from the 7th 
week of D-galactose administration, attenuated the associated histopathological 
alterations and enhanced the spatial and recognition memory in Morris water maze 
and Novel object recognition tests, respectively. CAB decreased the hippocampal 
concentrations of Aβ42, p-tau, and β-secretase, while upregulating α-secretase. 
Moreover, CAB diminished nuclear factor-kappa β (NF-κβ), tumor necrosis factor-α 
(TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and myeloperoxidase, while elevating 
brain-derived neurotrophic factor and phospho-cAMP response element binding 
protein. Further, CAB reduced the hippocampal phosphorylated forms of protein 
kinase B (AKT) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) contrary to elevating 
Beclin-1, resulting in autophagy induction, which participates in accelerating 
Aβ42 and p-tau aggregates clearance. Moreover, CAB increased the hippocampal 
glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) protein expression, promoting glutamate uptake 
that possibly reduced Ca2+ overload and consequently decreased the 
phosphorylated forms of P38-MAPK and ERK1/2. In conclusion, CAB improved 
cognitive decline of D-gal/OVX animals, restored hippocampal architecture, 
exerted neuroprotection, and enhanced autophagic machinery via modulating 
AKT/mTOR, GLT-1/P38-MAPK, and ERK1/2 pathways.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative 
condition worldwide. It is characterized by the formation of amyloid beta (Aβ) 
plaques in the brain and by the accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles; the 
disease is marked by cognitive decline and memory impairment over time. Although 
cholinesterase inhibitors and <sc>N</sc>-methyl-<sc>D</sc>-aspartate receptor 
antagonists have been used to relieve symptoms, immunotherapies to treat the 
disease itself by targeting removal of amyloid are now beginning to be applied 
clinically. However, methods that allow the control of AD symptoms and that 
would require only a few clinical follow-ups are often preferred by patients. 
Thus, active immunization, or vaccination, against Aβ and tau is still being 
explored as a possible therapeutic intervention.
SUMMARY: This review aims to describe ongoing and discontinued immunization 
trials to treat AD. We conducted a comprehensive review of the literature to 
analyze the current status of vaccinations for AD. We examined and summarized 
the studies and clinical trials that explored the efficacy, safety, and 
challenges associated with this therapeutic approach.
KEY MESSAGES: This review highlights the potential for vaccination development 
to treat AD, including its efficacy, associated complications, and limitations. 
Much progress has been made over the past 2 decades, but challenges remain. 
Immunization is a promising avenue for treating or preventing symptomatic AD, 
offering potential benefits beyond symptomatic relief. Because challenges such 
as immunogenicity and safety profiles need to be addressed, further research and 
development are necessary to meet the growing demand for patient-acceptable, 
effective AD treatments.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The elucidation of candidate genes is fundamental to 
comprehending intricate diseases, vital for early diagnosis, personalized 
treatment, and drug discovery. Traditional Disease Gene Identification methods 
encounter limitations, necessitating substantial sample sizes and statistical 
power, particularly challenging for complex diseases. Conversely, Disease Gene 
Prioritization methods leverage biological knowledge but rely on computational 
predictions, often lacking experimental validation. Addressing existing tool 
challenges, this study introduces an innovative two-tier machine-learning 
protocol that distils Disease Gene Association details from disease-specific 
abstracts, incorporating diverse findings. Employing advanced text mining, the 
model classifies disease-gene associations from the abstracts into Positive, 
Negative, and Ambiguous classes.
METHODS: Leveraging Random Forest as a robust text classification tool, this 
study demonstrates its efficacy in navigating complexities within biomedical 
texts. In the developed 2-tiered protocol, the level 1 classifier categorizes 
information into two classes, distinguished by the presence or absence of 
disease-gene associations, whereas the level 2 classifier further classifies 
into three classes: Positive, Negative, and Ambiguous associations. The 
developed classifier underwent rigorous training and cross-validation on 
different gold standard datasets - Alzheimer's, Breast Cancer and Type 2 
Diabetes. Its performance across these varied disease contexts underscores its 
versatility and robustness without succumbing to overfitting.
RESULTS: Achieving an average accuracy of 97.29 % and 98.14 % for level 1 and 
level 2 classification, the protocol successfully extracted 2769, 3220 and 740 
genes associated positively with Alzheimer's, Breast Cancer and Type 2 Diabetes. 
From the identified positive genes, a substantial number-1008, 670, and 165 
genes, respectively-were not reported in established databases, thus expanding 
the genetic exploration of these diseases. These identified genes offer 
promising opportunities for targeted interventions, while ambiguous genes 
warrant further investigation to unravel deeper disease associations.
CONCLUSIONS: This research significantly contributes to the understanding of 
genetic diseases by offering a comprehensive roadmap for their intricate 
exploration. Beyond the study's focus on Alzheimer's, Breast Cancer, and Type 2 
Diabetes, the protocol's applicability extends to diverse biomedical landscapes, 
demonstrating its versatility and impactful potential for comprehensive disease 
exploration.

Early diagnosis by detecting ultralow concentrations of disease biomarkers is 
critical for timely treatment of the two most common neurodegenerative diseases, 
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Innovative biosensors technologies can 
provide accurate, faster, and cheaper diagnostic pathways. In this review, the 
most recent electrochemical and optical sensing and biosensing platforms for 
diagnosing these diseases are critically selected and reviewed. Diagnostic 
targets (generally biomarkers) related to each disease and novel technologies, 
such as nanomaterials and biomolecular techniques to optimize the detection 
process and enhance signals, are discussed. In particular, multiplex detection 
and detection of multiple analytes by a (bio) sensing platform, to improve 
clinical sensitivity and selectivity are considered. This review is intended to 
open new approaches in the field and advance future research by identifying 
those strategies that optimize real-world performance and minimize present 
shortcomings.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a predominant neurodegenerative disorder worldwide, 
with epileptic seizures being a common comorbidity that can exacerbate cognitive 
deterioration in affected individuals, thus highlighting the importance of early 
therapeutic intervention. It is determined that deletion of Ms4a4a, an 
AD-associated gene, exacerbates seizures in amyloid β (Aβ)-driven AD mouse 
model. MS4A4A is significantly upregulated in brain lesions in patients with 
epilepsy. Single-cell sequencing reveals that MS4A4A is highly expressed in 
microglia within these lesions, linked to enhanced phagocytic activity. 
Mechanistic investigation delineates that deletion of Ms4a4a impairs microglial 
phagocytosis, accompanied by diminished calcium influx and disruptions in 
mitochondrial metabolic fitness. The cytosolic fragment of Ms4a4a is anchored to 
the cytoskeletal components, supporting its critical role in mediating 
phagocytosis. Induction of Ms4a4a through central delivery of LNP-Il4 alleviates 
seizure conditions. Collectively, these findings identify Ms4a4a as a potential 
therapeutic target for managing seizures in AD treatment.

Characterizing subtle cognitive changes in preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
is difficult using traditional neuropsychological assessments. Remote and 
unsupervised digital assessments can improve scalability, measurement 
reliability, and ecological validity, enabling the capture of subtle changes. We 
evaluate such tools for use in preclinical AD, or cognitively unimpaired 
individuals with abnormal levels of AD pathology. We screened 1904 reports for 
studies remotely assessing cognition in preclinical AD samples. Twenty-three 
tools were identified, and their usability, reliability, and validity, including 
construct and criterion validity based on in-person neuropsychological and 
Aβ/tau measures, was reported. We present a necessary update to a rapidly 
evolving field, following our previous review (Öhman et al., 2021) and address 
open questions of feasibility and reliability of remote testing in older adults. 
Future applications of such tools are discussed, including longitudinal 
monitoring of cognition, scalable case finding, and individualized prognostics 
in both clinical trials and healthcare contexts.

Real-world evidence (RWE) can complement clinical trials by addressing gaps in 
how approved anti-amyloid therapies for early Alzheimer's disease (AD) are used 
in everyday practice. This article outlines strategies to generate RWE that 
bridge three key challenges in AD care: low detection rates of mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI), limited data on long-term safety and effectiveness, and a lack 
of personalized treatment strategies. With MCI detection rates among primary 
care providers as low as 6%-15%, we propose cost-effective triage tools using 
electronic health records to enhance early diagnosis and intervention. We also 
highlight the importance of understanding anti-amyloid therapy outcomes in 
diverse, real-world populations. Supported by FDA initiatives, pragmatic trials 
and observational studies using real-world data (RWD) can help develop 
predictive models that incorporate biomarkers and support precision medicine. 
These approaches aim to move AD care beyond one-size-fits-all treatment, guiding 
more tailored, effective strategies for patients.

The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) was complex, including excessive 
deposition of β-amyloid (Aβ), microglia dysfunction, and neuroinflammation. 
Therefore, single-pathway treatment was not sufficient to ameliorate the 
multifaceted pathological changes associated with AD. Moreover, the low 
permeability of blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the lack of AD locus selectivity 
further limited the intervention efficacy of current AD drugs. In this study, a 
novel nanoparticle coating was designed by hybridizing the membrane from brain 
microvascular endothelial cell exosomes and macrophage exosomes, and combining 
polydopamine nanoparticles, resveratrol and Aβ-targeting aptamers to construct 
engineered exosomes (RPDA@Rb-A) with multiple targeting capabilities to 
intervene in Aβ clearance and regulate microglial dysfunction. Based on the 
homing effect of brain microvascular endothelial cell exosomes and the natural 
inflammation targeting ability of macrophage exosomes, RPDA@Rb-A can easily 
penetrate the blood brain barrier and accumulate in the brain inflammation site 
after capturing Aβ aggregates. RPDA@Rb-A can effectively intervene in AD through 
multi-pathway, including degraded toxic Aβ aggregates through local heating 
induced by near-infrared laser irradiation and alleviated neurotoxicity, 
promoted microglial clearance of Aβ by capturing Aβ, and modulated 
microglia-induced neuroinflammation by efficient delivery of small molecule 
drugs. In AD mouse model, the administration of RPDA@Rb-A resulted in a 
significant reduction in amyloid plaque deposition, neuroinflammation, and 
cognitive impairments. The engineered exosomes based on membrane hybridization 
overcome the shortcomings of traditional drug carriers in poor penetration and 
insufficient targeting to the central nervous system, and provide a potential 
platform for multi pathways intervention in AD.

Cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) are widely utilized for the symptomatic 
management of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by enhancing acetylcholine levels to 
improve cognitive function. Concurrently, neuroinflammation has emerged as a 
critical factor in AD progression, necessitating therapies that address this 
pathology. In this study, we designed and synthesized a novel bifunctional 
cholinesterase inhibitor, (E)-4-(2-(3-(benzyloxy)-4-oxo-4H-pyran-2-yl) 
vinyl)-1,2-phenylene bis(ethyl(methyl)carbamate) (D40), which combines potent 
cholinesterase inhibition with robust anti-neuroinflammatory activity. D40 
demonstrated potent inhibition of human butyrylcholinesterase (hBuChE), with an 
IC₅₀ value of 0.59 ± 0.03 μM, significantly outperforming Rivastigmine 
(IC₅₀ = 3.70 ± 0.96 μM). Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations 
confirmed a stable and selective binding of D40 to the BuChE active site, 
underpinning its inhibitory profile. Additionally, D40 exhibited strong 
anti-inflammatory effects, with an IC₅₀ value of 4.55 ± 0.78 μM for suppressing 
nitric oxide production and demonstrated excellent blood-brain barrier 
permeability. In vivo studies in aged 5 × FAD mice revealed that D40 
significantly reduced neuroinflammation by suppressing pro-inflammatory 
cytokines and glial activation. Furthermore, D40 mitigated Aβ deposition, 
promoted neuronal survival, and improved cognitive deficits, while demonstrating 
a favorable safety profile in acute toxicity evaluations. These findings 
highlight D40 as a dual-function ChEI capable of providing symptomatic relief 
and modulating neuroinflammatory pathways associated with AD. With its enhanced 
cholinesterase inhibition and anti-inflammatory properties, D40 emerges as a 
promising candidate for the treatment of advanced stages of AD. Acetylcholine 
deficiency and neuroinflammation as drivers of Alzheimer's disease dually 
intervened by Compound D40.

To address the multifactorial pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), eighteen 
butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) dual inhibitors 
were designed, synthesized, and biologically evaluated. Through 
structure-activity relationship studies, compound 17 emerged as the most potent 
candidate, with IC50 value of 0.3 nM for human BChE and 56.7 nM for HDAC6. This 
compound demonstrated favorable safety profiles, drug-like properties, and 
significant neuroprotective effects in vitro. In a mouse model of 
scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment, 17 (10 mg/kg) exhibited excellent 
safety and markedly improved cognitive deficits. These findings highlight 
compound 17 as a promising BChE/HDAC6 dual inhibitor, supporting its further 
development as a potential therapeutic agent for AD.

Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), like Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's 
disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis 
(ALS), present an increasingly significant global health burden, primarily due 
to the lack of effective early diagnostic tools and treatments. 
Exosomes-nano-sized extracellular vesicles secreted by nearly all cell 
types-have emerged as promising candidates for both biomarkers and therapeutic 
agents in NDs. This review examines the biogenesis, molecular composition, and 
diverse functions of exosomes in NDs. Exosomes play a crucial role in mediating 
intercellular communication. They are capable of reflecting the biochemical 
state of their parent cells and have the ability to cross the blood-brain 
barrier (BBB). In doing so, they facilitate the propagation of pathological 
proteins, such as amyloid-beta (Aβ), tau, and alpha-synuclein (α-syn), while 
also enabling the targeted delivery of neuroprotective compounds. Recent 
advancements in exosome isolation and engineering have opened up new 
possibilities for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. These range from the 
discovery of non-invasive biomarkers to innovative approaches in gene therapy 
and drug delivery systems. However, challenges related to standardization, 
safety, and long-term effects must be addressed before exosomes can be 
translated into clinical applications. This review highlights both the promising 
potential and the obstacles that must be overcome to leverage exosomes in the 
treatment of NDs and the transformation of personalized medicine.

Despite the relatively limited number of serotonergic neurons in humans, 
serotonin plays a key role in neurophysiological functions, including sleep, 
pain perception, learning, memory, cognition, emotion, reward, and mood 
regulation. Altered serotonergic neurotransmission is linked to conditions such 
as anxiety, depression, anorexia, migraine, insomnia, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), and cognitive impairments. The 5-HT6 receptor (5-HT6R), mainly 
found in brain regions involved in cognition, is a promising therapeutic target 
for cognitive deficits in neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly AD and 
schizophrenia. Preclinical studies have shown that 5-HT6R antagonists improve 
cognitive function. 5-HT6R interacts dynamically with an extensive intracellular 
protein network, regulating the localisation, trafficking, and signalling of 
these proteins. Proteomic and genetic studies have revealed interactions with 
mTOR kinase and neurofibromin, both of which are crucial for synaptic 
plasticity, learning, and memory. Fyn kinase is also associated with 5-HT6Rs, 
reinforcing receptor expression and G-protein coupling. Notably, the G 
protein-regulated inducer of neurite outgrowth 1 (GPRIN1) interacts with 5-HT6Rs 
independently of agonists, enhancing receptor activity. This review highlights 
the clinical testing of 5-HT6R ligands as regulators of these complex signalling 
properties, underscoring their therapeutic potential in addressing cognitive 
impairments associated with neuropsychiatric disorders.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by cognitive decline. Metabolic dysfunctions, particularly type 2 
diabetes mellitus (T2DM), have been implicated in AD pathogenesis, highlighting 
the potential for novel therapeutic approaches targeting shared underlying 
mechanisms. Here, we investigate sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) 
inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for AD using Enavogliflozin, a potent SGLT2 
inhibitor, in the 5XFAD mouse model. Five-month-old 5XFAD mice were treated with 
Enavogliflozin (0.1 or 1 mg/kg) or vehicle for 8 weeks. The higher dose 
significantly improved cognitive performance in Y-maze and Morris Water Maze 
tests, which correlated with enhanced synaptic plasticity and increased 
acetylcholine levels. Moreover, Enavogliflozin treatment reduced Aβ pathology 
and plaque burden, particularly affecting larger plaques. Mechanistically, SGLT2 
inhibition attenuated neuroinflammation by suppressing NF-κB signaling and 
proinflammatory cytokine production while promoting microglial recruitment to 
plaques. In vitro and ex vivo analyses further revealed that Enavogliflozin 
enhances microglial phagocytic capacity via AMPK-mediated mitochondrial 
biogenesis and function. These findings highlight the multifaceted 
neuroprotective effects of SGLT2 inhibition in AD, demonstrating its potential 
to mitigate pathology and improve cognitive function. By uncovering its impact 
on neuroinflammation and microglial function, this study establishes SGLT2 
inhibition as a promising therapeutic avenue for AD and other neurodegenerative 
disorders.

Qi-Fu-Yin (QFY) is a classic prescription in traditional Chinese medicine for 
treating dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease, but its safety has not yet been 
investigated. The purpose of this study was to assess the safety pharmacology 
and toxicology of QFY extract powder (QFYEP) to provide guidance for clinical 
trials or applications of QFY and its innovative formulations. The safety 
pharmacology of QFYEP on the central nervous system and respiratory system and 
its acute toxicity and 26-week repeated-dose toxicity were evaluated in 
Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. The safety pharmacology of QFYEP on the cardiovascular 
system was evaluated in beagle dogs. Additionally, the genotoxicity of QFYEP was 
assessed using the Ames test, an in vitro chromosome aberration test, and an 
in vivo micronucleus test. Under the experimental doses, no effects of QFYEP on 
the central nervous system or respiratory system were detected, no acute 
toxicity, long-term toxicity, or genotoxic effects of QFYEP were observed at any 
of the experimental doses. Specifically, the no-observed adverse-effect level 
(NOAEL) for the 26-week rat toxicity study was 10 g/kg/day (approximately 42 
times the intended human clinical dose). The only finding of note was 
dose-related vomiting and elevated blood pressure in the dog safety pharmacology 
study at oral doses 5.2- to 10.4- times the proposed clinical dose. In 
conclusion, this safety package of studies supports development of QFYEP in the 
clinic but with monitoring for any cardiovascular changes.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), an escalating global public health concern, 
demonstrates complex pathogenesis involving both genetic predisposition and 
vascular components. Blood pressure variability (BPV) has been implicated in 
neurodegenerative diseases, but its causal relationship with AD remains unclear. 
This study aims to explore the causal relationship between BPV and AD by 
applying Mendelian randomization (MR) to genome-wide association study (GWAS) 
summary data. Genetic instruments were selected from BPV GWAS based on UK 
Biobank data, ensuring relevance and significance(p < 5 × 10⁻⁶). Genetic 
estimates on exposure were obtained from three databases: The The International 
Genomic of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP); Maternal family history of AD from UK 
Biobank (MFH-UKBB), and Paternal family history of AD from UK Biobank 
(PFH-UKBB). Proxy SNPs were manually selected if SNPs were not available in the 
exposure GWAS. Data harmonization was performed to ensure consistency in effect 
and reference alleles. Three MR statistical methods were employed to assess 
causal effects, including inverse variance weighting (IVW) with random or fixed 
effect, MR-Egger regression, and the Weighted Median Method. Sensitivity 
analyses to evaluate robustness were also employed. Six SNPs associated with 
systolic BPV and six SNPs associated with diastolic BPV were included. 
Significant causal effects of SBPV on AD were found on the PFH-UKBB dataset in 
all four methods. The odds ratios for AD per 10-unit increment in SBPV were 
1.028, 1.015, and 1.015 for MR-Egger, IVW-MR, and weighted median, respectively. 
In contrast, only IVW methods found significant results for DBPV in the MFH-UKBB 
dataset. SBPV is a possible causal risk factor for AD, while the evidence for 
DBPV needs further study. BPV control should be an important treatment target in 
preventing dementia.

INTRODUCTION: Much research has been conducted into the role and safety of 
anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies on the progression of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). Despite the historical approval of three drugs by the US Food and Drug 
Administration for the treatment of early AD, there remains other potential 
treatment, which is yet to be approved or further developed. This systematic 
review explores the efficacy of anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies in the 
treatment of early AD from reported clinical trials.
METHODS: Authors conducted a systematic search of MEDLINE and Embase. Screening 
was carried out by two authors and cross-checked thereafter. Clinical changes in 
cognition and objective measures such as cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers and 
imaging constituted primary and secondary outcomes, respectively.
RESULTS: Our search yielded 14 randomized controlled trials; the primary focus 
of the included trials is amyloid-β. The monoclonal antibodies reported in this 
review are: lecanemab, aducanumab, crenezumab, solanezumab, donanemab, 
bapineuzumab, and gantenerumab. The most common finding among the trials is the 
lack of statistically significant results in measures of clinical outcomes, 
(e.g., Clinical Dementia Rating Scale-Sum of Boxes, AD Assessment 
Scale-Cognitive Subscale). However, specific trials investigating lecanemab, 
aducanumab, and donanemab demonstrated promising improvements in clinical 
cognition. Results related to secondary outcomes were also mixed, but showed 
more positive findings across the included trials. Overall, primary outcomes 
were inconsistent with secondary outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the need to consider the complex 
pathophysiology of AD in treatment development. Focusing solely on the 
amyloid-beta hypothesis may be inadequate; further research is necessary to 
understand the underlying mechanisms and develop treatments for the 
multifactorial nature of the disease.

BACKGROUND: Maintenance of cerebral blood flow during orthostasis is impaired 
with aging and associated with cognitive decline, but the effect of the 
apolipoprotein ɛ4 allele (APOE4) is unknown.
METHODS: Older adults (n = 108) (APOE4 carriers, n = 47; non-carriers, n = 61) 
diagnosed as having normal cognition (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) underwent transcranial Doppler ultrasound assessment of 
middle cerebral artery blood velocity (MCAv) and beat-to-beat mean arterial 
blood pressure (MAP) during a sit-to-stand transition. Anticipatory and 
orthostasis-induced MCAv and MAP responses were compared between genotypes and 
diagnostic classifications.
RESULTS: Cognitively normal APOE4 carriers showed greater anticipatory MCAv 
increase, greater MCAv decrease with orthostasis, and shorter latency of 
peripheral MAP responses to orthostasis compared to non-carriers. MCAv and MAP 
responses were delayed and attenuated across the APOE4 disease continuum, with 
no differences between genotypes in MCI and AD.
DISCUSSION: Unique cerebral and peripheral vascular compensation observed in 
APOE4 carriers may be neuroprotective for AD development.
HIGHLIGHTS: APOE4 carriers with NC show greater anticipatory increases in MCAv 
prior to orthostasis and decreases during orthostasis. APOE4 carriers with NC 
show faster peripheral MAP responses during orthostasis. APOE4 carriers with MCI 
and AD display loss of anticipatory MCAv responses. APOE4 carriers with MCI and 
AD display slower peripheral MAP responses. Unique cerebral and peripheral 
vascular compensation observed in APOE4 carriers may be neuroprotective for AD 
development.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease 
that is a major threat to the aging population. Due to lack of effective 
therapy, preventive treatments are important strategies to limit AD onset and 
progression, of which dietary regimes have been implicated as a key factor. Diet 
with high fiber content is known to have beneficial effects on cognitive decline 
in AD. However, a global survey on microbiome and brain cell dynamics in 
response to high fiber intake at single-cell resolution in AD mouse models is 
still missing.
RESULTS: Here, we show that dietary inulin supplementation synergized with AD 
progression to specifically increase the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila in 
gut microbiome of 5 × Familial AD (FAD) mice. By performing single-nucleus RNA 
sequencing on different regions of the whole brain with three independent 
biological replicates, we reveal region-specific changes in the proportion of 
neuron, astrocyte, and granule cell subpopulations upon inulin supplementation 
in 5xFAD mice. In addition, we find that astrocytes have more pronounced 
region-specific diversity than microglia. Intriguingly, such dietary change 
reduces amyloid-β plaque burden and alleviates microgliosis in the forebrain 
region, without affecting the spatial learning and memory.
CONCLUSIONS: These results provide a comprehensive overview on the 
transcriptomic changes in individual cells of the entire mouse brain in response 
to high fiber intake and a resourceful foundation for future mechanistic studies 
on the influence of diet and gut microbiome on the brain during 
neurodegeneration.

INTRODUCTION: Cognitively unimpaired (CU) amyloid beta (Aβ)+ individuals with 
elevated plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) have an increased risk of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related progression. We tested the utility of plasma 
GFAP for population enrichment CU populations in clinical trials.
METHODS: We estimated longitudinal progression, effect size, and costs of 
hypothetical clinical trials designed to test an estimated 25% drug effect on 
reducing tau positron emission tomography (PET) accumulation in the medial 
temporal lobe (MTL) and temporal neocortical region (NEO-T).
RESULTS: CU GFAP+/Aβ+ individuals present an increased annual rate of change and 
effect size in tau PETMTL and tau PETNEO-T compared to the other groups. An 
enrichment strategy selecting CU GFAP+/Aβ+ individuals would require a smaller 
sample size (≈ 57% reduction) and fewer Aβ PET scans (≈ 74% reduction) than 
trials enriched with Aβ PET alone, reducing total clinical trial costs by up to 
64%.
DISCUSSION: Our results suggest that clinical trials focusing on preclinical AD 
recruiting Aβ+ individuals with elevated GFAP levels would improve cost 
effectiveness.
HIGHLIGHTS: Cognitively unimpaired (CU) glial fibrillary acidic protein 
(GFAP)+/amyloid beta (Aβ)+ shows increased changes in tau positron emission 
tomography (PET) . CU GFAP+/Aβ+ enriched clinical trials require a reduced 
sample size compared to Aβ+ only. CU GFAP+/Aβ+ enrichment reduces Aβ PET scans 
required and costs. CU GFAP+/Aβ+ enrichment allows the selection of individuals 
at early stages of the Alzheimer's disease continuum.

BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have a high prevalence of 
cerebrovascular disease and cognitive impairment. The objective was to analyse 
whether plasma concentrations of neurofilament light chain (NfL), glial 
fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and phosphorylated Tau231 (p-Tau231) are 
elevated in patients with CKD and to identify independent predictors of these 
biomarkers, with an emphasis on the role of measured glomerular filtration rate 
(mGFR).
METHODS: In this cross-sectional cohort study, we included 110 patients with CKD 
stages 3 and 4 (estimated GFR 15-59 ml/min/1.73 m2) without manifest 
cerebrovascular disease or dementia, and 55 healthy controls. Biomarkers of 
neurological disorders were measured with ultrasensitive single molecule array 
methods.
RESULTS: Plasma concentrations (median [IQR]) of NfL (37.5 [22.1-47.5] vs. 13.4 
[10.5-16.7] ng/L, p < 0.001), p-Tau231 (25.7 [19.1-38.7] vs. 13.9 [10.5-16.3] 
ng/L, p < 0.001) and GFAP (190 [140-281] vs. 153 [116-211] ng/L, p < 0.001) were 
elevated in patients with CKD vs. controls. Measured GFR was negatively 
correlated with NfL (r = - 0.706, p < 0.001), p-Tau231 (r = - 0.561, p < 0.001), 
and GFAP (r = - 0.385, p < 0.001). In multivariable linear regression models, 
mGFR was an independent predictor of log-transformed plasma concentrations of 
NfL (standardized beta coefficient [β] = - 0.439, p < 0.001) and GFAP 
(β = - 0.321, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Patients with CKD had elevated plasma concentrations of NfL, 
p-Tau231 and GFAP compared with controls, and these biomarkers were inversely 
correlated with mGFR. Measured GFR was a significant, independent predictor of 
plasma concentrations of NfL and GFAP in patients with CKD. The mechanisms 
underlying this association need further investigation. Plasma levels of NfL and 
GFAP should be interpreted cautiously in patients with marked reductions in GFR.

BACKGROUND: In addition to conventional symptomatic treatment drugs, 
anti-amyloid beta antibody drugs are expected to benefit patients with 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, issues such as side effects and high costs 
persist, and new preventive and therapeutic drugs are desired. Meanwhile, 
information on the diagnosis and symptomatic treatment of AD accumulated during 
daily clinical practice is stored as real-world data and is considered a 
powerful means of discovering unknown factors that could provide clues for new 
prevention and treatment approaches for AD through comprehensive exploration.
METHODS: We used anonymized hospital information system data from a tertiary 
care and academic hospital in Japan, spanning from 1981 to 2016, to search for 
potential suppressive factors for AD onset and to verify the validity of the 
discovered factors. We initially conducted a comprehensive search for candidate 
suppressive factors for AD and verified them using the inverse probability 
weighting (IPW) method with propensity scores.
RESULTS: From the comprehensive search, we identified glycyrrhizic acid (GA), a 
component of licorice, a traditional medicine with anti-inflammatory, 
antioxidant, antibacterial, and antiaging properties, as a candidate suppressing 
factor for AD. The IPW method showed that the odds ratio of developing AD in the 
GA group was 0.642 (95% confidence interval: 0.566-0.727) compared with the 
non-GA group after adjustment.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first human study to suggest that GA may be a factor 
that can suppress the onset of AD. Additionally, our method could be a promising 
tool for drug repositioning that applies existing drugs already used in clinical 
settings with well-known side effects to diseases different from their original 
use.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Alzheimer's dementia (ADM) are common 
neurodegenerative disorders marked by progressive cognitive decline, memory 
impairment, and behavioral deficits, which impose a significant burden on 
individuals and healthcare systems worldwide. Due to the complex nature of AD 
pathophysiology, effective treatment strategies may require targeting multiple 
pathways. This study explored the neuroprotective effects of the chalcone 
derivative SG06 in a scopolamine-induced AD-like zebrafish model using network 
pharmacology and molecular docking. SG06 showed strong binding to key targets 
such as AKT serine/threonine kinase 1 (AKT1), which are involved in processes 
like tau phosphorylation, amyloid-beta (Aβ) production, and inflammation. 
Behavioral assays indicated that SG06 improved cognitive function, reduced 
anxiety-like behavior, and restored social interactions. Additionally, sensory 
recovery was observed through better light/dark transitions and recovered 
olfactory function, likely due to improved neuronal communication and reduced 
oxidative stress. Mechanistically, SG06 appeared to activate the PI3K/AKT1 
pathway, inhibiting Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) activity, which may 
help reduce tau hyperphosphorylation and amyloid processing. SG06 also restored 
antioxidant markers (CAT, GSH, GPx) and improved acetylcholinesterase (AChE) 
activity, reducing oxidative damage and cholinergic dysfunction. Histological 
analysis revealed improved cellular morphology and decreased Aβ plaque 
accumulation, while gene expression studies showed downregulation of 
pro-inflammatory markers and upregulation of neuroprotective genes. 
Additionally, SG06 helped improving neurotransmitter balance, particularly in 
Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) and Dopamine (DPAN), contributing to improved 
synaptic plasticity and cognitive function. These findings suggest that SG06 may 
have potential as a multi-target therapeutic agent in addressing the complex 
pathology of AD.

Lung cancer is a complex disease with varying subtypes. The genetic 
architectures and risk factors that are similar or distinct among these subtypes 
remain unclear. In this work, Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) conducted 
by the International Lung Cancer Consortium and transdisciplinary Research in 
Cancer of the Lung were utilized to illustrate the genetic landscapes of 
different subtypes of lung cancer. GWAS of 942 phenotypes from UK Biobank and 
902 phenotypes from FinnGen Biobank were analyzed to identify the genetic risk 
factors specific or common to each subtype of lung cancer through two sample 
Mendelian randomization inverse variance weighting method. Multivariable 
Mendelian randomization was employed to assess the true causals of lung cancer. 
We found that lung cancer, small cell lung carcinoma, squamous cell lung cancer 
and lung adenocarcinoma shared similar, yet varied genetic architectures. 
Genetic risk loci at 15q25 were identified in all types of lung cancer. Yet, 
genetic risk loci at 5p15 were observed in squamous cell lung cancer and lung 
adenocarcinoma, but not in small cell lung carcinoma. Out of 942 phenotypes from 
UK Biobank, smoking, time spent watching television, age first had sexual 
intercourse, alcohol usually taken with meal and age at first live birth were 
common risk factors for all types of lung cancer. Moreover, out of 902 traits in 
FinnGen Biobank, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was positively 
associated with small cell lung carcinoma, squamous cell lung cancer and lung 
adenocarcinoma. Angina pectoris and myocardial infarction were negatively 
associated with lung cancer, squamous cell lung cancer and lung adenocarcinoma. 
And Alzheimer's disease was negatively associated with lung cancer, small cell 
lung carcinoma and squamous cell lung cancer. In further weighted median and 
weighted mode methods, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris and Alzheimer's 
disease also had genetical associations with lung cancer or its subtypes. Even, 
considering factors such as smoking, COPD, and other risk factors together, 
myocardial infarction, angina pectoris and Alzheimer's disease retained the 
genetical associations with lung cancer and its subtypes. Overall, in a 
phenome-wide Mendelian randomization analysis, our results have highlighted both 
similar and distinct risk factors among different subtypes of lung cancer. 
Additionally, our findings have provided genetic associations linking myocardial 
infarction, angina pectoris and Alzheimer's disease with lung cancer or its 
various subtypes.

INTRODUCTION: Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) related inflammation (CAA-ri) is 
considered to be a distinct syndrome caused by an inflammatory response to 
amyloid-β deposition in the walls of small leptomeningeal and cortical vessels 
in patients with sporadic CAA. However, recent data suggest that inflammation 
might contribute to a broader range of CAA subtypes.
RESULTS: We describe a case of probable iatrogenic CAA (iCAA), which manifested 
with multiple intracerebral haemorrhages complicated by the development of 
clinical and radiological features of CAA-ri, which responded to steroids. 
Clinical, neuroimaging and CSF data suggested possible co-existing Alzheimer's 
pathology.
DISCUSSION: CAA-ri may occur in association with iCAA, suggesting that a broader 
spectrum of patients might benefit from steroid treatment than previously 
assumed.

The tear film is a complex structure with rich interactions with the human body. 
A growing body of evidence suggests that measuring changes in protein, lipid, or 
other metabolite concentration in the tear film can be used to help detect 
disease. Particularly in the era of precision medicine, the tear film serves as 
a promising source of non-invasive insights into systemic health for early 
diagnosis and treatment. This paper analyzes the latest research in tear film 
biomarkers for systemic diseases. The review was conducted through PubMed and 
Embase databases using the PRISMA protocol and includes 54 articles. This paper 
first reviews the anatomy and physiology of tear film, as well as the latest 
proteomic analysis techniques on the tear film. We then provide a 
disease-by-disease review on the tear film as a biomarker including 5 articles 
related to Alzheimer's Disease, 10 articles related to Cancers, 1 article 
related to Cystic Fibrosis, 1 article related to Migraines, 4 articles related 
to Multiple Sclerosis, 15 articles related to Parkinson's Disease, 7 articles 
related to Rheumatoid Arthritis, and 11 articles related to Thyroid Disease. 
This paper highlights the promising results of these studies yet also reviews 
the challenges with limited sample sizes, reproducibility, and biological 
understanding of biomarkers. We conclude this paper with insights for future 
work to ensure clinical validity and generalizability. Ultimately, the tear film 
is a clinically accessible, complex structure that provides a wealth of 
information that may contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of 
systemic health.

This review provides an integrative overview of the functional roles of adult 
neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), focusing specifically on its 
impact on memory processes across the lifespan. A distinguishing feature of this 
review is its systematic approach, organizing the contributions of adult-born 
neurons (ABNs) chronologically through the stages of memory-from initial 
encoding, through sleep-dependent consolidation, retrieval, and finally 
forgetting. Although the existence and extent of adult neurogenesis in the human 
DG remain debated, accumulating evidence suggests that ABNs support cognitive 
functions throughout adulthood. This perspective gains particular importance 
when considering cognitive decline associated with aging and neurological 
disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, which are linked to substantial 
reductions in adult neurogenesis. We compare traditional models of DG function 
with emerging evidence highlighting both shared and unique contributions of 
ABNs. For example, the DG is well-established for its role in pattern 
separation, and as key mediators of this function, ABNs-due to their transiently 
heightened plasticity and excitability-appear critical for discriminating novel 
or similar experiences. On the other hand, recent findings underscore the 
distinct and essential role of ABNs in memory consolidation during REM sleep, 
suggesting specialized functions of ABNs that are absent in developmentally born 
granule cells in the DG. Clinically, the potential therapeutic importance of 
enhancing neurogenesis in memory-related disorders, including post-traumatic 
stress disorder (PTSD), is emphasized, highlighting promising treatments such as 
memantine. Lastly, we outline key unresolved questions, advocating for future 
research aimed at understanding ABN-specific mechanisms. Far from being a mere 
evolutionary vestige, hippocampal ABNs represent dynamic and essential elements 
of neural plasticity that are critical for memory formation, adaptation, and 
resilience across the lifespan.

OBJECTIVE: Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute systemic inflammation, that affects 
medium-sized arteries. Coronary artery lesions (CALs) were the most serious 
complication or sequelae of KD. The intense inflammatory response leads to 
platelet activation, further exacerbating inflammation, which plays an important 
role in the pathogenesis of CALs in KD patients. Plus, coagulation factors are 
closely related to platelet activation. Therefore, we speculate that the 
activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), an indicator of coagulation factor 
function, may be involved in the occurrence of CALs, but it has not been 
explored yet. This study aims to investigate the effect of the APTT level on 
CALs occurrence in the acute phase of KD.
METHODS: A total of 2303 KD patients during a 10-year period were recruited at 
the Wenzhou Medical University affiliated Yuying Children's Hospital. A total of 
1715 patients who completed the follow-up were enrolled in the final analysis 
and were divided into the low APTT group and the high APTT group at a 46 s 
cutoff before receiving intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment. Multiple 
logistic regression analysis and stratified analysis were utilized to evaluate 
the independent impact of APTT levels on the occurrence of CALs and to determine 
the impact of APTT levels on the occurrence of CALs in different subgroups, 
respectively.
RESULTS: The incidence of CALs in the low APTT group and the high APTT group was 
12.5 % and 17.5 %, respectively (P = 0.005). Patients with high APTT levels had 
higher CRP levels (P < 0.001). High APTT levels were the independent risk factor 
on the occurrence of CALs; the adjusted odds ratio (OR) was 1.523 (95 % CI: 
1.144, 2.028). Similar results were found in stratification analysis and 
sensitivity analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: KD patients with high APTT levels (≥46 s) before IVIG treatment may 
be more prone to developing CALs in the acute phase of KD.

Monoclonal antibodies against beta-amyloid protein (lecanemab and donanemab) 
should not be used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

Two antiamyloid monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), lecanemab and donanemab, were 
recently launched for treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). These mAbs remove 
amyloid protein from the brain and cause statistically significant improvement 
in cognitive/functional tests, meaning a change in evolution of AD. This is 
important to reinforce the amyloid cascade hypothesis and to further concentrate 
studies on the pathways from the deposition of the beta-amyloid protein to 
synaptic loss and neuronal death. However, it is necessary to evaluate whether 
the results are clinically important. Analysis of the clinical trials showed 
that the statistically significant differences over placebo did not reach the 
minimum clinically important difference that would be meaningful for patients, 
caregivers and clinicians. Besides, the incidence of adverse events is high and 
potentially severe. Although there are reasons to celebrate this first step 
towards disease-modifying therapies for AD, lecanemab and donanemab should not 
be used to treat AD in clinical pratice.

The licensing of lecanemab and donanemab, disease-modifying immunotherapies for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) targeting β-amyloid pathology, has been met with 
difference in opinion about efficacy, adverse effects, and cost-effectiveness. 
Here we summarize the current situation and make the case for cautious adoption 
of these treatments into clinical practice. This opinion is predicated on four 
main observations: 1) these treatments impact the core pathologies of AD and 
result in meaningful benefits; 2) while adverse effects can be serious, these 
are proving manageable in clinical practice; 3) upscaling services to deliver 
these agents is likely to provide wider benefits for diagnosing and treating 
dementia and facilitating the adoption of future treatments from the dementia 
drug pipeline; and 4) factoring in both the wider societal cost of care and 
potential for continued accrual of long term benefits will be likely to bring 
these treatments within acceptable cost-effectiveness thresholds.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (GRA) belong to a class of 
compounds that reduce blood glucose and energy intake by simulating actions of 
endogenous incretin hormone GLP-1 after it is released by the gut following food 
consumption. They are used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity 
and have systemic effects on various organs, including the brain, liver, 
pancreas, heart, and the gut. Patients with T2DM have a higher risk of 
developing neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), including Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Huntington's 
disease (HD), accompanied by more severe motor deficits and faster disease 
progression, suggesting dysregulation of insulin signaling in these diseases. 
Experimental studies have shown that GRA have protective effects to modulate 
neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial and autophagic functions, and 
protein misfolding. Hence the compounds have generated enormous interest as 
novel therapeutic agents against NDs. To date, clinical trials have shown that 
three GRA, exenatide, liraglutide and lixisenatide can improve motor deficits as 
an add-on therapy in PD patients and liraglutide can improve cognitive function 
in AD patients. The neuroprotective effects of these and other GRA, such as 
PT320 (a sustained-released exenatide) and semaglutide, are still under 
investigation. The dual GLP-1/gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) receptor 
agonists have been demonstrated to have beneficial effects in AD and PD mice 
models. Overall, GRA are highly promising novel drugs, but future clinical 
studies should identify which subsets of patients should be targeted as 
potential candidates for their symptomatic and/or neuroprotective benefits, 
investigate whether combinations with other classes of drugs can further augment 
their efficacy, and evaluate their long-term disease-modifying and adverse 
effects.

BACKGROUND: Cerebral complications of pre-eclampsia are a leading cause of 
maternal mortality. Better understanding of the pathophysiology may enable the 
development of novel strategies to protect the maternal brain. We aimed to 
investigate blood-brain barrier injury and neuroinflammatory pathways in women 
with eclampsia and pre-eclampsia compared to normotensive pregnancies.
METHODS: This observational cross-sectional study conducted between March 2021 
and June 2023, included women with eclampsia, pre-eclampsia, and normotensive 
pregnancies admitted to Tygerberg Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa who 
underwent caesarean delivery. Cerebrospinal fluid and plasma samples were 
collected during caesarean delivery. Blood-brain barrier injury was assessed 
using immunonephelometry for albumin and ELISA assays for claudin-5 and matrix 
metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). Neuroinflammatory markers were analysed on the 
multiplex Bio-Plex Pro Human Cytokine-Screening assay. Data were analysed using 
parametric methods after log transformation and are presented as fold changes 
(geometric mean ratios) between groups.
FINDINGS: The study included 129 women: Eleven had eclampsia, 17 had 
pre-eclampsia with end-organ complications, 88 had pre-eclampsia without 
end-organ complications, and 13 with normotensive pregnancies. Women with 
eclampsia had increased cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of claudin-5 
(2.7-fold, 95% CI 1.4-5.1, p = 0.002 vs normotensive control) and MMP-9 
(2.5-fold, 95% CI 1.1-5.3, p = 0.024 vs pre-eclampsia with end-organ 
complications). They also demonstrated increased cerebrospinal fluid cytokine 
levels compared to normotensive controls, reflecting inflammatory recruitment 
(Interleukin-8: 7.2-fold, 95% CI 2.7-18.5, p < 0.001), cytotoxicity 
(Interleukin-6: 20.7-fold, 95% CI 6.4-63.6, p < 0.001), and immune modulation 
(Interleukin-10: 2.0-fold, 95% CI 1.2-3.1, p = 0.004). Neuroprotective markers 
were reduced in eclampsia (stem cell factor: 0.5-fold, 95% CI 0.3-0.8, p = 
0.005) compared to normotensive controls. There was no correlation between 
cytokine concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid and plasma. Women with 
pre-eclampsia showed less pronounced changes indicative of blood-brain barrier 
injury and immune modulation.
INTERPRETATION: Eclampsia is associated with blood-brain barrier injury and 
acute neuroinflammation originating from cerebral tissue, inducing cytotoxicity. 
This may be an underlying mechanism for seizures and cerebral injury in 
eclampsia and pre-eclampsia.

BACKGROUND: The gut microbiome is altered in MS and may contribute to disease by 
disrupting the intestinal barrier. The colonic mucus barrier, which is primarily 
composed of mucin protein 2 (MUC2), plays a crucial role in providing a barrier 
between colonic epithelial cells and the microbiome. Disruption of intestinal 
epithelial and mucus barriers has been reported in inflammatory bowel disease 
(IBD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) but has not been studied in the context of 
the microbiome in multiple sclerosis (MS).
METHODS: We investigated the epithelial tight junction protein zonulin occludins 
1 (ZO-1), mucus protein MUC2, inflammatory stool markers (calprotectin), and gut 
microbiota composition in a cohort of subjects with relapsing and progressive 
MS.
FINDINGS: MUC2 was decreased in stool of subjects with both relapsing and 
progressive MS. ZO-1 was elevated in the serum of subjects with progressive MS 
but was not altered in the stool. Inflammatory markers typically elevated in IBD 
and PD, including calprotectin, were not altered in MS stool, suggesting disease 
specificity of altered gut physiology in MS. Microbiota with known mucus 
degrading capacity were elevated in the stool of subjects with MS and negatively 
correlated with mucus protein levels.
INTERPRETATION: Taken together, these findings suggest reduced gut barrier 
function in MS which is linked to increased mucin degrading bacteria.

BACKGROUND: Recent technological advances in wearable devices offer new 
potential for measuring mobility in real-world contexts. Mobilise-D has 
validated digital mobility outcomes to provide novel outcomes and end points in 
clinical research of 4 different long-term health conditions (Parkinson disease, 
multiple sclerosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and proximal femoral 
fracture). These outcomes also provide unique information that is important to 
patients; however, there is limited literature that explores the optimal methods 
to achieve this, such as the best way to visualize patients' data.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify meaningful outcomes for each condition 
and how to best visualize them from the perspective of end users.
METHODS: Using a Delphi-type protocol with patients as subject matter experts, 
we gathered iterative feedback on the cocreation of visualizations through 3 
rounds of questionnaires. An open-ended questionnaire was used in round 1 to 
understand what aspects of mobility were most influenced by their health 
condition. These responses were mapped onto relevant digital mobility outcomes 
and walking experiences and then prioritized for visualization. Using patient 
responses, we worked alongside researchers, clinicians, and a patient advisory 
group to develop visualizations that depicted a week of mobility data. During 
rounds 2 and 3, participants rated usefulness and ease of understanding on a 
5-point Likert scale and provided unstructured feedback in comment boxes for 
each visualization. Visualizations were refined using the feedback from round 2 
before receiving further feedback in round 3.
RESULTS: Participation varied across rounds 1 to 3 (n=48, n=79, and n=78, 
respectively). Round 1 identified important outcomes and contexts for each 
health condition, such as walking speed and stride length for people with 
Parkinson disease or multiple sclerosis and number of steps for people with 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or proximal femoral fracture. The 
consensus was not reached for any visualization reviewed in round 2 or 3. 
Feedback was generally positive, and some participants reported that they were 
able to understand the visualization and interpret what the visualization 
represented.
CONCLUSIONS: Through the feedback provided and existing data visualization 
principles, we developed recommendations for future visualizations of mobility- 
and health-related data. Visualizations should be readable by ensuring that 
large and clear fonts are used and should be friendly for people with vision 
impairments, such as color blindness. Patients have a strong understanding of 
their own condition and its variability; hence, adding additional factors into 
visualizations is recommended to better reflect the nuances of a condition. 
Ensuring that outcomes and visualizations are meaningful requires close 
collaboration with patients throughout the development process.

Primary age-related tauopathy (PART) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) both exhibit 
3R/4R hyperphosphorylated tau-positive neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) within the 
hippocampal-entorhinal system. Notably, PART patients show a higher degree of 
tau hyperphosphorylation in the entorhinal cortex (EC) than AD, yet the 
molecular mechanisms driving Aβ-independent tau hyperphosphorylation in PART 
remain poorly understood. Herein, through transcriptomic profiling of postmortem 
EC tissues and in vitro and in vivo functional validation, the present study 
identifies protein arginine methyltransferase 3 (PRMT3) as a critical driver of 
tau hyperphosphorylation. Mechanistically, PRMT3-mediated tau 
hyperphosphorylation is dependent on asymmetric dimethylation of histone H4 at 
arginine 3 (H4R3me2a), which upregulates miR-448. Elevated miR-448 specifically 
targets and suppresses IGF1R, leading to downstream GSK3β activation and 
subsequent tau hyperphosphorylation through PI3K/AKT/GSK3β signaling. Treatment 
with SGC707, a selective PRMT3 inhibitor, effectively reduces tau 
hyperphosphorylation and demonstrates therapeutic promise for PART and 
potentially other tauopathies. Collectively, this study defines the 
PRMT3/H4R3me2a/miR-448 axis as a critical regulatory pathway in tau 
hyperphosphorylation within PART, underscoring the potential of PRMT3 inhibition 
as a targeted therapeutic strategy for tauopathies.

To inform an efficient development of new investigational anti-amyloid beta 
(anti-Aβ) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), a modeling-and-simulation-based strategy 
was proposed. A general modeling framework that links drug exposures to the time 
course of amyloid plaque removal and amyloid-related imaging abnormalities 
characterized by edema and effusion (ARIA-E) was developed based on publicly 
available data on aducanumab, lecanemab, and donanemab. A non-linear mixed 
effect model with shared model parameters described the dose response data from 
aducanumab, lecanemab, and donanemab studies after adjusting for different 
potency for different antibodies, which allowed the rate of amyloid plaque 
removal to vary by drug. A time-to-event model was developed to describe ARIA-E 
incidence. The model assumes that ARIA-E incidence rate is dependent on the rate 
of amyloid plaque removal with a drug-dependent scaling factor linking amyloid 
plaque removal rate and treatment-dependent hazard. Simulations of amyloid 
plaque removal and ARIA-E for a hypothetical anti-Aβ mAb based on certain 
assumptions and scenarios provided insights into possible outcomes. Overall, the 
meta-analysis of published data on existing anti-Aβ mAbs could be utilized to 
model exposure-response relationships and the time course of amyloid plaque 
removal and ARIA-E incidence of new anti-Aβ mAbs and to inform the design of 
early clinical trials for them.

Melatonin, N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine, is a tryptophan-derived hormone mostly 
produced in the pineal gland, despite being synthesized locally at several 
tissues and organs. This production is rhythmically controlled by complex clock 
gene networks in the master pacemaker located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of 
the hypothalamus. Melatonin is usually secreted only during the dark phase of 
the day and is essential to synchronize circadian rhythms and neuroendocrine 
physiological processes. Its main clinical use is associated with the treatment 
of jet lag and other circadian rhythm sleep disorders, with a growing number of 
other promising therapeutic applications due to the diverse physiological roles 
of melatonin. In this review, we explore melatonin and its receptors and provide 
an updated overview on research concerning the role of melatonin, either as an 
endogenous molecule or as a drug, in: sleep-wake cycle regulation; circadian 
rhythms; inflammatory processes that may compromise cardiovascular, respiratory, 
gastrointestinal, renal, and reproductive system functions; and 
neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. The 
most recent and promising research findings concerning melatonin synthetic 
analogs such as agomelatine and ramelteon are highlighted, pointing toward new 
compounds with promising pharmacological activity while emphasizing their 
structural differences and advantages when compared to melatonin.

IMPORTANCE: As amyloid-targeted therapies have become commercially available, 
the monitoring of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), which is an important risk 
factor for amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, has received increasing 
attention. However, comprehensive evidence on the association between Alzheimer 
disease (AD) plasma biomarkers and various CAA imaging markers is still lacking.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of CAA imaging markers with downstream AD 
plasma biomarkers in relation to amyloid-β (Aβ) uptake on positron emission 
tomography (PET) and whether their interplay is associated with cognitive 
changes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This registry-based cohort study in 25 
hospitals across South Korea recruited participants aged 45 years or older who 
were registered between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2023. Participants 
were categorized as having no cognitive impairment, mild cognitive impairment, 
or dementia of the Alzheimer type.
EXPOSURES: Cerebral amyloid angiopathy imaging markers assessed by magnetic 
resonance imaging, including cerebral microbleeds (CMBs), cortical superficial 
siderosis, white matter hyperintensities, lacunes, and enlarged perivascular 
spaces.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Plasma phosphorylated tau-217 (p-tau217) was 
measured using a commercial assay. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and 
neurofilament light chain (NfL) were measured using a single-molecule assay on a 
single platform. All participants underwent amyloid PET imaging. Associations of 
CAA and vascular imaging markers with downstream AD plasma biomarkers were 
investigated using linear regression.
RESULTS: A total of 1708 participants were included (mean [SD] age, 71.2 [8.4] 
years; 1044 female [61.1%]). The mean (SD) follow-up period was 4.3 (3.1) years. 
Lobar CMB counts and the presence of CAA were associated with downstream AD 
plasma biomarkers, including p-tau217 (β = 0.12 [95% CI, 0.05-0.18] and 0.29 
[95% CI, 0.12-0.47], respectively), GFAP (β = 0.07 [95% CI, 0.03-0.12] and 0.20 
[95% CI, 0.09-0.31], respectively), and NfL (β = 0.07 [95% CI, 0.03-0.11] and 
0.16 [95% CI, 0.06-0.25], respectively) with and without the mediation of Aβ 
uptake on PET (indirect effect: lobar CMBs-p-tau217, 59.8% [β = 0.07 (95% CI, 
0.03-0.11)]; lobar CMBs-GFAP, 49.3% [β = 0.04 (95% CI, 0.01-0.06)]; lobar 
CMBs-NfL, 20.9% [β = 0.01 (95% CI, 0.01-0.03)]; CAA-p-tau217, 50.9% [β = 0.15 
(95% CI, 0.06-0.24)]; CAA-GFAP, 39.2% [β = 0.08 (95% CI, 0.03-0.13)]; CAA-NfL, 
19.2% [β = 0.03 (95% CI, 0.01-0.05)]). Amyloid-β uptake fully mediated the 
associations between cortical superficial siderosis and downstream AD plasma 
markers. In contrast, hypertensive arteriosclerotic vascular imaging markers, 
including lacunes, deep CMBs, and enlarged perivascular spaces in basal ganglia, 
were associated with only NfL levels (β = 0.07 [95% CI, 0.01-0.13], 0.20 [95% 
CI, 0.08-0.32], and 0.14 [95% CI, 0.06-0.23], respectively), regardless of Aβ 
uptake on PET. Finally, there were interactive associations of lobar CMBs in 
conjunction with p-tau217 levels (β = -0.56 [95% CI, -0.79 to -0.34]) and GFAP 
levels (β = -0.44 [95% CI, -0.70 to -0.17]) with annual Mini-Mental State 
Examination changes.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of participants with no 
cognitive impairment, mild cognitive impairment, or dementia of the Alzheimer 
type, a novel association was found among CAA imaging markers, downstream AD 
plasma biomarkers, and cognitive declines in relation to brain Aβ burdens. The 
findings emphasize the importance of understanding the clinical effects of 
amyloid-related imaging abnormality-like CAA imaging markers in light of 
upcoming amyloid-targeted therapies.

IMPORTANCE: The use of stimulant medications has expanded substantially beyond 
the traditional treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) to 
encompass a variety of other clinical conditions. Understanding the safety of 
these medications is important as their use increases across diverse patient 
populations.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety of stimulant medications as reported in 
randomized clinical trials (RCTs) investigating methylphenidate, 
lisdexamfetamine, and other amphetamines.
DATA SOURCES: A comprehensive literature search was conducted from July 1, 2024, 
through February 28, 2025, using CINAHL, Embase, PubMed or MEDLINE, 
ScienceDirect, and Web of Science for studies published since 2000. Keywords 
included safety, adverse event, side effect, amphetamine, dextroamphetamine, 
stimulant, lisdexamfetamine, and methylphenidate.
STUDY SELECTION: RCTs published between January 1, 2000, and December 13, 2024, 
were included. These trials investigated the safety of stimulants in various 
clinical conditions, including ADHD, depression, binge eating disorder, 
schizophrenia, Alzheimer disease, and stimulant use disorders as well as in 
healthy individuals. Trials not focused on safety or adverse events (AEs) of 
stimulants, nonoriginal research, nonhuman research, trials with concomitant 
prescriptions other than stimulants, and trials without a placebo group were 
excluded.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data extraction followed the Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline. 
Independent reviewers extracted study data, and a random-effects model was used 
to pool results. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the risk ratio (RR) of 
developing any AE in participants taking stimulants vs placebo.
RESULTS: A total of 93 RCTs were included after exclusions. The methodological 
quality assessment of the included trials showed overall low or unclear risk of 
bias. Trials with a duration of up to 52 weeks showed that stimulant medications 
were associated with an increased risk of overall AEs compared with placebo (RR, 
1.34; 90% CI, 1.27-1.41), with high heterogeneity (I2 = 67%). Statistical 
significance of this finding was maintained when subgroups (ie, methylphenidate, 
lisdexamfetamine, and other amphetamines) were separately analyzed.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This meta-analysis found an increased risk of overall 
AEs associated with stimulants compared with placebo. Future research could 
provide more standardized and consistent assessments of this outcome and may 
improve understanding about misuse risk.

PURPOSE: This study proposes a vision transformer (ViT)-based model for dementia 
classification, able to classify representative dementia with Alzheimer's 
disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, frontotemporal dementia, and healthy 
controls using brain single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images. 
The proposed method allows for an input based on the anatomical structure of the 
brain and the efficient use of five different SPECT images.
METHODS: The proposed model comprises a linear projection of input patches, 
eight transformer encoder layers, and a multilayered perceptron for 
classification with the following features: 1. diverse feature extraction with a 
multi-head structure for five different SPECT images; 2. Brodmann area-based 
input patch reflecting the anatomical structure of the brain; 3. cross-attention 
to fusion of diverse features.
RESULTS: The proposed method achieved a classification accuracy of 85.89% for 
418 SPECT images from real clinical cases, significantly outperforming previous 
studies. Ablation studies were conducted to investigate the validity of each 
contribution, in which the consistency between the model's attention map and the 
physician's attention region was analyzed in detail.
CONCLUSION: The proposed ViT-based model demonstrated superior dementia 
classification accuracy compared to previous methods, and is thus expected to 
contribute to early diagnosis and treatment of dementia using SPECT imaging. In 
the future, we aim to further improve the accuracy through the incorporation of 
patient clinical information.

Emerging evidence has established neuroinflammation as a primary driver of 
progressive neuronal loss observed across neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs). The 
NLRP3 inflammasome is a cytosolic immunoprotective danger sensing complex, which 
when aberrantly activated drives neuroinflammation, propagates amyloid 
deposition, and neurodegeneration. Herein, we report the therapeutic benefit of 
NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition in Alzheimer's disease (AD), using a novel and 
selective brain-penetrant small molecule NLRP3 inhibitor, VEN-02XX, which we 
profiled in the 5XFAD/Rubicon KO AD model. We demonstrate for the first time 
that targeting NLRP3, post-symptomatic establishment, rescues cognitive 
deficits, mitigates neuronal loss, and is sufficient to significantly reduce 
reactive microgliosis, neuroinflammation and tau pathology. Our data further 
suggest that pharmacological inhibition of NLRP3, after disease onset, has the 
potential to reduce cortical and hippocampal amyloid burden. Together, these 
results highlight the potential for NLRP3 inhibition as a symptomatic and 
disease modifying therapeutic target for AD pathology and more broadly NDDs.

INTRODUCTION: Dl-PHPB [potassium 2-(1-hydroxypentyl) benzoate] demonstrates 
robust neuroprotective effects in preclinical models of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), significantly ameliorating cognitive deficits and pathological hallmarks. 
However, the underlying mechanism remains largely unclear. The current study 
primarily focused on elucidating dl-PHPB's neuroprotective mechanisms and 
identifying potential targets in preclinical AD models.
METHODS: Comparative proteomic analyses were performed on APP/PS1 mice orally 
administered either dl-PHPB (30 mg/kg) or vehicle daily for 3 months, alongside 
vehicle-treated wild-type (WT) non-transgenic littermates as controls. Total 
proteins were separated using two dimensional difference gel electrophoresis, 
and differentially expressed protein spots were identified via LC-MS/MS.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Our results revealed 11 altered proteins in the cortex 
and 10 in the hippocampus between the WT and APP/PS1 groups treated with 
vehicle. Following dl-PHPB treatment, 12 differentially expressed proteins were 
identified in the cortex and 9 in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. These 
proteins are primarily involved in energy metabolism, neuronal structure, 
protein trafficking, inflammatory and oxidative responses, and amyloid β (Aβ) 
and Tau processes, among which several proteins were validated as potential 
therapeutic targets. Notably, the expression levels of cofilin-2 and VDAC1 in 
APP/PS1 mice were restored to near-normal levels by the treatment with dl-PHPB, 
memantine, or donepezil, and further clinical validation is required to 
establish their utility as AD biomarkers for therapeutic efficacy.

Monocytes are central to the innate immune system's response to infection or 
injury. In murine, these cells are classified into distinct subsets: classical 
monocytes, defined by elevated Ly6C expression (Ly6Chi), intermediate monocytes 
(Ly6Cint), and non-classical inflammatory monocytes, characterized by low Ly6C 
expression (Ly6Clow). Monocytes recruited to tissues differentiate into 
macrophages, which can be pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory, thereby 
influencing disease processes and outcomes. The principal function of classical 
monocytes is the mediation of pro-inflammatory reactions, whereas non-classical 
monocytes are associated with repair and anti-inflammatory processes, patrolling 
the lumen of the vessels. Growing evidence highlights the importance of 
monocytes in multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune and neurodegenerative 
disease of the central nervous system (CNS). Recent studies indicate that 
modulation of the innate immune system, focusing specifically on the shift from 
Ly6Chi to Ly6Clow monocytes, is an effective therapeutic strategy for 
neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and MS. This transition is 
crucial for switching the immune response from inflammation to tissue repair and 
inflammation resolution, emphasizing the plasticity of monocytes and their 
potential as targets in MS. This review differs from prior studies in that it 
focuses solely on animal models of MS, which either directly perturb or study 
monocytes, or where therapeutic approaches mediate their protective effects 
through monocytes. Such details permit a subtle comprehension of monocyte 
dynamics in the context of MS.

INTRODUCTION: Inflammasome activation is implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
We previously demonstrated that nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors 
(NRTIs), drugs approved to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and 
hepatitis B, also inhibit inflammasome activation.
METHODS: We evaluated the association between NRTI exposure and subsequent 
development of AD in the United States Veterans Health Administration over a 
24-year period and in the MarketScan database over a 14-year period using 
propensity score-matched multivariate Cox hazards regression and Kaplan-Meier 
analyses.
RESULTS: We report that in humans, NRTI exposure was associated with a 
significantly lower incidence of AD in two of the largest health insurance 
databases in the United States. In contrast, exposure to non-NRTIs, protease 
inhibitors (PIs), and integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) was not 
associated with reducing AD incidence.
DISCUSSION: These findings support the concept that inflammasome inhibition 
could benefit AD and provide a rationale for prospective clinical testing of 
inflammasome inhibitors such as NRTIs in AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: Exposure to NRTIs, a class of anti-retroviral drugs that also block 
inflammasome activation, was associated with a reduction in the risk of 
developing AD. The reduction in risk was observed in two large, diverse health 
insurance databases after correcting for numerous comorbidities known to be 
associated with AD. Other anti-HIV therapies such as non-NRTIs, protease 
inhibitors, and integrase strand transferase inhibitors were not associated with 
a reduction in the risk of developing AD. Our work provides a rationale for 
randomized clinical trials of inflammasome inhibitors in AD.

Developing effective treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD) likely requires a 
deep understanding of molecular mechanisms. Integration of transcriptomic 
datasets and developing innovative computational analyses may yield novel 
molecular targets with broad applicability. The motivation for this study was 
conceived from two main observations: (a) most transcriptomic analyses of AD 
data consider univariate differential expression analysis, and (b) insights are 
often not transferable across studies. We designed a machine learning-based 
framework that can elucidate interpretable multivariate relationships from 
multiple human AD studies to discover robust transcriptomic AD biomarkers 
transferable across multiple studies. Our analysis of three human hippocampus 
datasets revealed multiple robust synergistic associations from unrelated 
pathways along with inconsistencies of gene associations across different 
studies. Our study underscores the utility of developing AI-assisted next-gen 
metrics for integration, robustness, and generalization and also highlights the 
potential benefit of elucidating molecular mechanisms and pathways that are 
important in targeting a single population.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, a 
neurodegenerative disorder that progress overtime, which is best known for mood 
swings and loss of cognitive, behavioral and functional abilities. Quercetin is 
one of the most consumed flavonoids in the diet and has neuroprotective, 
anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. The purpose of this study was to 
assess the potential neurotherapeutic effect of quercetin and compare it with 
donepezil. 40 Wister male rats were used and separated into two main groups: 
Group I: control group; Group II: AD group, which was divided into four 
subgroups: Group IIA: untreated AD-rats; Group IIB: quercetin treated AD-rats; 
Group IIC: donepezil treated AD-rats and Group IID: combined group of quercetin 
and donepezil. Hydrated aluminum chloride (AlCl3.6H2O) solution (75 mg/kg/day) 
was administered orally for 6 weeks to induce the AD-like conditions. Morris 
water maze, behavior test, was used to monitor the cognitive function. 
Hippocampal tissues were excised for assessment of Alzheimer's parameters and 
blood samples were obtained for liver and kidney function assessment. According 
to the final findings, untreated rats presented significantly increased levels 
of amyloid β1-42; tau protein; malondialdehyde; nuclear factor kappa-B; 
acetylcholinesterase activity, β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 
1 upregulation and miRNA-124 downregulation. The best results of treatment were 
observed in the combination of donepezil and quercetin, as revealed by 
histopathological observations via H&E and Congo red stains. This study led to 
the conclusion that quercetin, by targeting several pathogenic pathways, could 
be used as an adjuvant drug with donepezil for AD treatment.

Okadaic acid (OKA) is a marine biotoxin that accumulates in shellfish and is 
responsible for causing diarrheic shellfish poisoning. OKA is a powerful and 
selective inhibitor of serine/threonine phosphatases 1 and 2A, which induces 
hyperphosphorylation of tau in vitro and in vivo leading to Alzheimer's disease 
(AD)-like pathology and memory impairment. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a gaseous 
signaling molecule produced endogenously in the brain, has been demonstrated to 
possess neuroprotective properties in various models of neurodegeneration. The 
aim of this study was to investigate the potential of H₂S in reducing 
OKA-induced Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like pathology, focusing on its effects on 
the GSK3β/Tau and CaMKII/CREB signaling pathways in mice. To test this 
hypothesis, we used age 8-10 weeks-old male C57BL/6J wild-type mice, divided 
into the following experimental groups: 1. Control group: Received a single 
intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of artificial cerebrospinal fluid 
(aCSF). 2. WT + OKA group: Received a single ICV injection of OKA (100 ng/5 µl) 
bilaterally to induce AD-like pathology. OKA was dissolved in artificial 
cerebrospinal fluid. 3. WT + OKA + GYY4137 group: Received a single ICV 
injection of OKA (100 ng/5 µl) bilaterally, followed by GYY4137 (30 µM/kg) via 
drinking water for 21 days. 4. WT + GYY4137 group: Received only GYY4137 per se 
(30 µM/kg) via drinking water for 21 days. After the treatment period, synaptic 
proteins and neurodegeneration were evaluated using Western blotting, RT-PCR, 
and immunohistochemistry techniques. Our results demonstrate that OKA 
administration results in memory impairment with decreased cerebral blood flow 
(CBF). OKA also caused a significant decrease in synapse proteins (PSD95, MAP-2, 
BDNF, CaMKIIα, and Tubulin-3β) levels, along with increased expression of Tau, 
PHF-1, and GSK-3β and memory-associated signaling molecules and pCREB. 
Interestingly, IP administration of GYY4137 (30 µM/Kg; an H2S donor) for 21 days 
significantly improved the level of synapse proteins and memory function in 
OKA-treated mice. The findings of this study determine the neuroprotective 
mechanism of H2S in OKA-induced AD-like pathology through the modulation of Tau, 
GSK3β, and pCREB signaling. Therefore, H2S ameliorates OKA-induced memory 
impairment by improving synapse function and forgetfulness. As a result, H2S 
could be used as a promising therapeutic molecule against Alzheimer's 
disease-like pathology.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder characterized 
by insidious onset and progressive symptom deterioration. It extends beyond a 
simple aging process, involving irreversible and progressive neurological 
degeneration that impairs brain function through multiple etiologies. Iron 
dysregulation is implicated in the pathophysiology of AD; however, the precise 
mechanisms remain unclear. Additionally, vitamin E and selenium are key in 
regulating ferroptosis through their antioxidant properties. The present review 
examined the mechanistic pathways by which ferroptosis contributes to AD, the 
regulatory roles of vitamin E, selenium, ferrostatin‑1, N‑acetylcysteine and 
curcumin, and their potential as therapeutic agents to mitigate 
neurodegeneration.

A mechanism of global gene expression regulation is disrupted by multiple 
disease states and drug treatments.

Pickard BS(1).

Author information:
(1)Strathclyde Institute of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, University of 
Strathclyde, Glasgow, United Kingdom.

Conventional expression studies quantify messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript levels 
gene-by-gene. We recently showed that protein expression is modulated at a 
global scale by amino acid availability, suggesting that mRNA expression levels 
might be equivalently affected. Through re-analysis of public transcriptomic 
datasets, it was confirmed that nucleobase supply interacts with the specific 
demands of mRNA A + U:C + G sequence composition to shape a global profile of 
expression, which can be quantified as a gradient of average expression change 
by average composition change. In mammals, each separate organ and cell-type 
displays a distinct baseline profile of global expression. These profiles can 
shift dynamically across the circadian day and the menstrual cycle. They are 
also significantly distorted by viral infection, multiple complex genetic 
disorders (including Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and autoimmune 
disorders), and after treatment with 115 of the 597 chemical entities analysed. 
These included known toxins and nucleobase analogues, but also many commonly 
prescribed medications such as antibiotics and proton pump inhibitors, thus 
revealing a new mechanism of drug action and side-effect. As well as key roles 
in disease susceptibility, mRNAs with extreme compositions are significantly 
over-represented in gene ontologies such as transcription and cell division, 
making these processes particularly sensitive to swings in global expression. 
This may permit efficient, en bloc transcriptional reprogramming of cell state 
through simple adjustment of nucleobase proportion and supply. It is also 
proposed that this mechanism helped mitigate the loss of essential amino acid 
synthesis in higher organisms. In summary, global expression regulation is 
invisible to conventional transcriptomic analysis, but its measurement allows a 
useful distinction between active, promoter-mediated gene expression changes and 
passive, cell state-dependent transcriptional competence. Linking cell 
metabolism directly to gene expression offers an entirely new perspective on 
evolution, disease aetiopathology (including gene x environment - GxE - 
interactions), and the nature of the pharmacological response.

BACKGROUND: Xanthoceras sorbifolia Bunge oil (XSBO) has garnered significant 
interest from researchers due to its distinctive anti-Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
properties. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remain unclear. This 
study aims to investigate the potential mechanisms by which XSBO may exert 
therapeutic effects on AD by employing a combination of network pharmacology 
analysis and experimental validation.
METHODS: The chemical composition and absorbed compounds of XSBO were identified 
using GC-MS and LC-MS. Network pharmacology analysis was performed using various 
computational tools to identify hub genes and construct compound-target-pathway 
networks. Subsequently, both in vitro and in vivo experiments were conducted to 
confirm the mechanisms by which XSBO may treat AD.
RESULTS: The results identified 43 active compounds in XSBO, targeting a total 
of 223 genes, of which 191 were associated with AD. Network analysis indicated 
that the active constituents in XSBO, such as 9,12-octadecadienoic acid, 
linoelaidic acid and 11-octadecenoic acid, interact with targets including 
MAPK1, MAPK3, AKT1, RXRA, RXRB, PPARD and PPARA to modulate inflammation-related 
signalling pathways and the sphingolipid signalling pathway. In vitro 
investigations corroborated that XSBO can significantly influence the viability 
of Aβ25-35-induced SH-SY5Y cells via the MAPK pathway.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that XSBO has the potential to mitigate 
inflammation network disorders through the MAPK pathway and to restore 
sphingolipid metabolite levels in AD rats, thereby laying a groundwork for 
future studies.

IntroductionQuitting smoking is challenging even with existing pharmacotherapy. 
Thus, discovery of new cessation medications is imperative. Memantine, a 
well-tolerated Alzheimer's disease drug, partially antagonizes glutamate at the 
N-methyl-D-Aspartate receptor (NMDAR), modulating dopamine release in addiction 
pathways. Memantine may interrupt nicotine reward and promote smoking 
cessation.Materials and MethodsAt 23 community oncology practices nationwide, we 
recruited 130 breast, prostate, lung, or colorectal cancer survivors ≥ six 
months beyond definitive treatment who currently smoked at least 10 cigarettes 
daily and wanted to quit. In a double-blind fashion, participants were 
randomized to take either memantine (10 mg) or a matching placebo twice daily 
for 12 weeks (65 per arm). Toxicity, nicotine dependence, and past-week 
abstinence were recorded at 2, 4-, 6-, 9-, and 12-weeks post-randomization. The 
primary endpoint was feasibility and preliminary estimation of 12-week 
self-reported past-week smoking abstinence.ResultsThere were no significant 
differences in abstinence rates or nicotine dependence between the two groups at 
12 weeks. Twelve-week completion of therapy was low, but lower in memantine than 
control participants (42% vs 63%, respectively; P = .01). Memantine participants 
reported trends of less anxiety, craving, and hunger. No significant differences 
in toxicity were observed between groups. Serious adverse events (3 in memantine 
arm, 1 in control arm) occurred; none considered possibly or probably related to 
study medication.ConclusionMemantine did not improve 12-week smoking abstinence 
rates in cancer survivors. While other NMDAR antagonists might deserve 
evaluation, this study suggests memantine is not efficacious for smoking 
cessation in a cancer survivor subpopulation.Trial registration 
numberNCT01535040 - February 17, 2012.

Plain Language Summary: Quitting smoking is hard, even with current medicines, 
so finding new ones is crucial. Memantine, a drug used for Alzheimer’s, affects 
the brain chemical glutamate, which is involved in addiction. It might help 
people stop smoking by changing how the brain reacts to nicotine. In this study, 
130 cancer survivors who smoked at least 10 cigarettes a day wanted to quit. 
They were split into two groups: one took memantine pills, the other took 
placebo pills (which have no medicine). Neither the participants nor the doctors 
knew who got which pills, making it a fair test. Researchers checked in with 
them over 12 weeks to see if they were smoking less. They found that memantine 
didn’t help more people quit than the placebo. Also, fewer people in the 
memantine group finished the whole 12 weeks of pills compared to the placebo 
group. Some people in both groups had side effects, but they weren’t serious. In 
conclusion, memantine didn’t increase the number of people who quit smoking 
among cancer survivors in this study. Drugs like memantine should still be 
studied. But this research shows memantine might not be the best choice to help 
cancer survivors quit smoking.

BackgroundPrimary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a neurodegenerative syndrome that 
impairs language and speech abilities. Limited research exists on PPA in 
Indonesia, and understanding neurologists' perspectives is crucial for improving 
early diagnosis and management.ObjectiveThis study aimed to assess Indonesian 
neurologists' knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding 
PPA.MethodsIndonesian neurologists were invited to complete an online 
questionnaire covering demographics, clinical experiences, understanding of PPA 
variants and treatments, attitudes toward diagnosis, and current clinical 
practices.ResultsA total of 192 neurologists completed the survey, predominantly 
aged 31-40 years (53.15%) with over five years of experience (61.5%). Many 
reported limited experience with PPA: with 43.8% had never encountered 
progressive language impairment, and 81.3% had not diagnosed PPA. While 
knowledge of PPA symptoms and variants was strong, gaps remained, particularly 
in specific clinical features. Participants recognized the importance of 
comprehensive assessments and multidisciplinary care, but inconsistencies in 
evaluations and referrals revealed a gap between knowledge and 
practice.ConclusionsWhile Indonesian neurologists have a foundational 
understanding of PPA, there are significant gaps in recognizing variant-specific 
features, assessment methods, and referral pathways. Addressing these gaps 
through targeted education and improved diagnostic tools is essential for 
enhancing patient care.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are two prevalent and 
debilitating conditions that frequently coexist, with CKD contributing to 
cognitive decline and potentially exacerbating AD pathology. In CKD, 
irreversible changes in the structure or function of the kidneys are observed, 
while AD is primarily marked by amyloid deposition and tau pathology. Both 
conditions involve complex and multifactorial pathophysiology affecting brain 
functioning, highlighting the need for comprehensive research to understand 
their potential crosstalk. This review articulates the possible molecular 
mechanisms underlying both diseases, focusing on key pathways, including 
oxidative stress, inflammation, vascular dysfunction, hypertension, and uremic 
toxin accumulation. These interconnected mechanisms suggest a potential 
bidirectional relationship where kidney dysfunction accelerates cognitive 
decline and vice versa. Additionally, we examine critical risk factors 
implicated in both CKD and AD, for instance, vitamin D deficiency, 
erythropoietin dysregulation, endothelin action, klotho gene expression, and the 
role of the extracellular vesicle, which may influence disease progression 
through their effects on the kidney and brain, influencing cognitive function. 
Further, we emphasized potential biomarkers that could aid in diagnosing and 
monitoring disease progression in these comorbid conditions, like amyloid beta, 
tau, homocysteine, cystatin C, creatinine, proteinuria, and estimated glomerular 
filtration rate. Lastly, the review highlights treatment strategies for managing 
CKD and AD concurrently, focusing on therapeutic approaches that address common 
pathophysiological mechanisms. These strategies not only aim to address the 
underlying causes of both conditions but also offer the potential to slow or 
even prevent the progression of cognitive impairment. Moreover, we recommend 
further research to refine these approaches, execute correlational studies on 
disease progression, and design clinical trials that address both conditions, 
aiming to establish effective, tailored treatments for this dual burden of 
disease.

BACKGROUND: Hippocampal atrophy is a key marker of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Diverse artificial intelligence (AI) 
architectures for automated hippocampal segmentation have been increasingly 
reported in neuroimaging research. Different hippocampal automated segmentation 
methods can be of added value for the AD diagnostic work-up and treatment 
planning. This study aims to conduct a thorough meta-analysis to evaluate the 
segmentation accuracy and diagnostic performance of AI-assisted hippocampal 
segmentation in AD and MCI.
METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library up 
to December 2024. Studies using neuroimaging data to assess AI algorithms for 
hippocampal segmentation and diagnosis in AD or MCI populations were included. 
Pooled segmentation accuracy was estimated using the Dice similarity coefficient 
(DSC) through a random-effects model, while diagnostic performance (sensitivity, 
specificity, and area under the curve [AUC]) was evaluated using a bivariate 
mixed-effects model.
RESULTS: A total of 27 studies were included. For segmentation accuracy, pooled 
DSC values were 0.82 (95% CI: 0.80-0.85) for AD, 0.85 (0.83-0.88) for MCI, and 
0.86 (0.84-0.88) for normal controls (NC). Subgroup analyses indicated 
comparable performance between left and right hippocampi (both DSC: 0.87). 
Diagnostic meta-analysis demonstrated the highest accuracy for AD vs. NC 
(sensitivity: 0.87, specificity: 0.91, AUC: 0.95), but lower performance for AD 
vs. MCI (AUC: 0.80) and MCI vs. NC (AUC: 0.83).
CONCLUSION: AI-assisted hippocampal segmentation achieves good accuracy and 
demonstrates promising diagnostic capabilities for distinguishing AD from NC, 
though differentiation between AD and MCI remains challenging. Future 
high-quality research that applied standardized protocols, external validation, 
and clinical integration is needed to improve reliability in clinical practice.

This chapter discusses the dependency of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons 
(BFCNs) on endogenous nerve growth factor (NGF) for the structural and 
physiologic maintenance of the neuronal cell somata, axonal projections, and 
terminal synapses. It covers the discovery of NGF and the occurrence of a CNS 
neurotrophin family and their cognate receptors and their signaling mechanisms. 
It concludes with a description of the NGF metabolic pathway and its 
dysregulation in Alzheimer disease (AD) and Down syndrome pathology, explaining 
the progressive atrophy of BFCNs, which starts at preclinical stages and is 
reflected in body fluid biomarkers.
