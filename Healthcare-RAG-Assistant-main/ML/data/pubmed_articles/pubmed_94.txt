BACKGROUND: The Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale allows to detect the 
presence of dementia and to assess its severity, however its evaluation requires 
a significant time (45 min). We evaluated the agreement between two methods of 
collection of the CDR: face-to-face interview or based on the information 
available in the patient's medical record.
METHODS: The CLIMER study was conducted among patients attending a memory 
center. The CDR scale was evaluated during face-to-face interviews between 
neuropsychologists and patients and their caregivers and based on blind analysis 
of the information of the patients' medical record by neuropsychologists. The 
agreement of the CDR sum of boxes (CDR-SB), the 5-point scale CDR and the 
different domains of the CDR evaluated between the different methods was 
measured using intraclass correlation (ICC) coefficient, Bland and Altman 
method, and linearly weighted Kappa.
RESULTS: The study included 139 patients (means ± SD age 80.1 ± 6, 58.3% women, 
71.9% with dementia). The ICC for the CDR-SB score assessed by face-to-face and 
with all the information available in the patient's medical record was 0.95 (95% 
CI: 0.93-0.97). The mean difference between the CDR-SB score assessed by 
face-to-face and with the medical record was 0.098 ± 1.036, and 92.4% of the 
patients lay within the 95% limits of agreement. The ICC for the 5-point scale 
CDR assessed by face-to-face and with the patient's medical record was 0.92 (95% 
CI: 0.88-0.95) when all the available information of the patient's medical 
record was used. The linear weighted Kappa coefficients was 0.79 (95% CI: 
0.68-0.91) for the 5-point scale CDR comparison between the two evaluation 
methods. The analysis by domain of the CDR showed ICC ranging from 0.65 to 0.91 
depending of the domains and the methods of evaluation.
CONCLUSION: This study showed an excellent level of agreement of the evaluation 
of the CDR- SB and the 5-point scale CDR when using all the information of the 
patient's medical record compared to the face-to-face interview.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. 
Although drugs focusing on reducing amyloid β slow progression, they fail to 
improve cognitive function. Deficits in glucose metabolism are reflected in 
FDG-PET and parallel the neurodegeneration and synaptic marker loss closely 
preceding cognitive decline, but the role of metabolic deficits as a cause or 
consequence of neurodegeneration is unclear. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) is 
lost in AD and an important enzyme connecting glycolysis and the tricarboxylic 
acid (TCA) cycle by converting pyruvate into acetyl-CoA. It is negatively 
regulated by pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDHK) through phosphorylation.
METHODS: In the present study, we assessed the in vitro/ in vivo pharmacological 
profile of the novel PDHK inhibitor that we discovered, Compound A. We also 
assessed the effects of Compound A on AD-related phenotypes including neuron 
loss and cognitive impairment using 5xFAD model mice.
RESULTS: Compound A inhibited human PDHK1, 2 and 3 but had no inhibitory 
activity on PDHK4. In primary neurons, Compound A enhanced pyruvate and lactate 
utilization, but did not change glucose levels. In contrast, in primary 
astrocytes, Compound A enhanced pyruvate and glucose utilization and enhanced 
lactate production. In an efficacy study using 5xFAD mice, Compound A 
ameliorated the cognitive dysfunction in the novel object recognition test and 
Morris water maze. Moreover, Compound A prevented neuron loss in the hippocampus 
and cerebral cortex of 5xFAD without affecting amyloid β deposits.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest ameliorating metabolic deficits by activating 
PDH by Compound A can limit neurodegeneration and is a promising therapeutic 
strategy for treating AD.

BACKGROUND: Microglial activation is one hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD) 
neuropathology but the impact of the regional interplay of microglia cells in 
the brain is poorly understood. We hypothesized that microglial activation is 
regionally synchronized in the healthy brain but experiences regional 
desynchronization with ongoing neurodegenerative disease. We addressed the 
existence of a microglia connectome and investigated microglial 
desynchronization as an AD biomarker.
METHODS: To validate the concept, we performed microglia depletion in mice to 
test whether interregional correlation coefficients (ICCs) of 18 kDa 
translocator protein (TSPO)-PET change when microglia are cleared. Next, we 
evaluated the influence of dysfunctional microglia and AD pathophysiology on 
TSPO-PET ICCs in the mouse brain, followed by translation to a human 
AD-continuum dataset. We correlated a personalized microglia desynchronization 
index with cognitive performance. Finally, we performed single-cell radiotracing 
(scRadiotracing) in mice to ensure the microglial source of the measured 
desynchronization.
RESULTS: Microglia-depleted mice showed a strong ICC reduction in all brain 
compartments, indicating microglia-specific desynchronization. AD mouse models 
demonstrated significant reductions of microglial synchronicity, associated with 
increasing variability of cellular radiotracer uptake in pathologically altered 
brain regions. Humans within the AD-continuum indicated a stage-depended 
reduction of microglia synchronicity associated with cognitive decline. 
scRadiotracing in mice showed that the increased TSPO signal was attributed to 
microglia.
CONCLUSION: Using TSPO-PET imaging of mice with depleted microglia and 
scRadiotracing in an amyloid model, we provide first evidence that a microglia 
connectome can be assessed in the mouse brain. Microglia synchronicity is 
closely associated with cognitive decline in AD and could serve as an 
independent personalized biomarker for disease progression.

BACKGROUND: The burgeoning field of regenerative medicine has significantly 
advanced with recent findings on biotherapies using human platelet lysates 
(HPLs), derived from clinical-grade platelet concentrates (PCs), for treating 
brain disorders. These developments have opened new translational research 
avenues to explore the neuroprotective effects of platelet-extracellular 
vesicles (PEVs). Their potential in managing neurodegenerative conditions like 
traumatic brain injury (TBI) and Parkinson's disease (PD) warrants further 
exploration. We aimed here to characterize the composition of a PEV preparation 
isolated from platelet concentrate (PC) supernatant, and determine its 
neuroprotective potential and neurorestorative effects in cellular and animal 
models of TBI and PD.
METHODS: We isolated PEVs from the supernatant of clinical-grade PC collected 
from healthy blood donors utilizing high-speed centrifugation. PEVs were 
characterized by biophysical, biochemical, microscopic, and LC-MS/MS proteomics 
methods to unveil biological functions. Their functionality was assessed in 
vitro using SH-SY5Y neuronal cells, LUHMES dopaminergic neurons, and BV-2 
microglial cells, and in vivo by intranasal administration in a controlled 
cortical impact (CCI)-TBI model using 8-weeks-old male C57/BL6 mice, and in a PD 
model induced by MPTP in 5-month-old male C57/BL6 mice.
RESULTS: PEVs varied in size from 50 to 350 nm, predominantly around 200 nm, 
with concentrations ranging between 1010 and 1011/mL. They expressed specific 
platelet membrane markers, exhibited a lipid bilayer by cryo-electron microscopy 
and, importantly, showed low expression of pro-coagulant phosphatidylserine. 
LC-MS/MS indicated a rich composition of trophic factors, including 
neurotrophins, anti-inflammatory agents, neurotransmitters, and antioxidants, 
unveiling their multifaceted biological functions. PEVs aided in the restoration 
of neuronal functions in SH-SY5Y cells and demonstrated remarkable 
neuroprotective capabilities against erastin-induced ferroptosis in dopaminergic 
neurons. In microglial cells, they promoted anti-inflammatory responses, 
particularly under inflammatory conditions. In vivo, intranasally delivered PEVs 
showed strong anti-inflammatory effects in a TBI mouse model and conserved 
tyrosine hydroxylase expression of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra 
in a PD model, leading to improved motor function.
CONCLUSIONS: The potential of PEV-based therapies in neuroprotection opens new 
therapeutic avenues for neurodegenerative disorders. The study advocates for 
clinical trials to establish the efficacy of PEV-based biotherapies in 
neuroregenerative medicine.

Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), the second most common primary degenerative 
neurocognitive disorder after Alzheimer disease, is frequently preceded by REM 
sleep behavior disorders (RBD) and other behavioral symptoms, like anxiety, 
irritability, agitation or apathy, as well as visual hallucinations and 
delusions, most of which occurring in 40-60% of DLB patients. Other frequent 
behavioral symptoms like attention deficits contribute to cognitive impairment, 
while attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a risk factor for DLB. 
Behavioral problems in DLB are more frequent, more severe and appear earlier 
than in other neurodegenerative diseases and, together with other 
neuropsychiatric symptoms, contribute to impairment of quality of life of the 
patients, but their pathophysiology is poorly understood. Neuroimaging studies 
displayed deficits in cholinergic brainstem nuclei and decreased metabolism in 
frontal, superior parietal regions, cingulate gyrus and amygdala in DLB. Early 
RBD in autopsy-confirmed DLB is associated with lower Braak neuritic stages, 
whereas those without RBD has greater atrophy of hippocampus and increased tau 
burden. αSyn pathology in the amygdala, a central region in the fear circuitry, 
may contribute to the high prevalence of anxiety, while in attention 
dysfunctions the default mode and dorsal attention networks displayed diverging 
activity. These changes suggest that behavioral disorders in DLB are associated 
with marked impairment in large-scale brain structures and functional 
connectivity network disruptions. However, many pathobiological mechanisms 
involved in the development of behavioral disorders in DLB await further 
elucidation in order to allow an early diagnosis and adequate treatment to 
prevent progression of these debilitating disorders.

Recent advances in high-throughput measurement technologies have enabled the 
analysis of molecular perturbations associated with disease phenotypes at the 
multi-omic level. Such perturbations can range in scale from fluctuations of 
individual molecules to entire biological pathways. Data-driven clustering 
algorithms have long been used to group interactions into interpretable 
functional modules; however, these modules are typically constrained to a fixed 
size or statistical cutoff. Furthermore, modules are often analyzed 
independently of their broader biological context. Consequently, such clustering 
approaches limit the ability to explore functional module associations with 
disease phenotypes across multiple scales. Here, we introduce AutoFocus, a 
data-driven method that hierarchically organizes biomolecules and tests for 
phenotype enrichment at every level within the hierarchy. As a result, the 
method allows disease-associated modules to emerge at any scale. We evaluated 
this approach using two datasets: First, we explored associations of 
biomolecules from the multi-omic QMDiab dataset (n = 388) with the 
well-characterized type 2 diabetes phenotype. Secondly, we utilized the ROS/MAP 
Alzheimer's disease dataset (n = 500), consisting of high-throughput 
measurements of brain tissue to explore modules associated with multiple 
Alzheimer's Disease-related phenotypes. Our method identifies modules that are 
multi-omic, span multiple pathways, and vary in size. We provide an interactive 
tool to explore this hierarchy at different levels and probe enriched modules, 
empowering users to examine the full hierarchy, delve into biomolecular drivers 
of disease phenotype within a module, and incorporate functional annotations.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), characterized by cognitive impairment, brain plaques, 
and tangles, is a global health concern affecting millions. It involves the 
build-up of amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau proteins, the formation of neuritic plaques 
and neurofibrillary tangles, cholinergic system dysfunction, genetic variations, 
and mitochondrial dysfunction. Various signaling pathways and metabolic 
processes are implicated in AD, along with numerous biomarkers used for 
diagnosis, risk assessment, and research. Despite these, there is no cure or 
effective treatment for AD. It is critically important to address this 
immediately to develop novel drug delivery systems (NDDS) capable of targeting 
the brain and delivering therapeutic agents to modulate the pathological 
processes of AD. This review summarizes AD, its pathogenesis, related signaling 
pathways, biomarkers, conventional treatments, the need for NDDS, and their 
application in AD treatment. It also covers preclinical, clinical, and ongoing 
trials, patents, and marketed AD formulations.

BACKGROUND: The association between delirium and dementia has been suggested, 
but mostly in the postoperative setting. This study aims to explore this 
relationship in a broader inpatient population, leveraging extensive real-world 
data to provide a more generalized understanding.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, electronic health records of 
11,970,475 hospitalized patients aged over 60 from nine institutions in South 
Korea were analyzed. Patients with and without delirium were identified, and 
propensity score matching (PSM) was used to create comparable groups. A 10-year 
longitudinal analysis was conducted using the Cox proportional hazards model, 
which calculated the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). 
Additionally, a meta-analysis was performed, aggregating results from all nine 
medical institutions. Lastly, we conducted various subgroup and sensitivity 
analyses to demonstrate the consistency of our study results across diverse 
conditions.
RESULTS: After 1:1 PSM, a total of 47,306 patients were matched in both the 
delirium and nondelirium groups. Both groups had a median age group of 75-79 
years, with 43.1% being female. The delirium group showed a significantly higher 
risk of all dementia compared with the nondelirium group (HR: 2.70 [95% CI: 
2.27-3.20]). The incidence risk for different types of dementia was also notably 
higher in the delirium group (all dementia or mild cognitive impairment, HR: 
2.46 [95% CI: 2.10-2.88]; Alzheimer's disease, HR: 2.74 [95% CI: 2.40-3.13]; 
vascular dementia, HR: 2.55 [95% CI: 2.07-3.13]). This pattern was consistent 
across all subgroup and sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Delirium significantly increases the risk of onset for all types of 
dementia. These findings highlight the importance of early detection of delirium 
and prompt intervention. Further research studies are warranted to investigate 
the mechanisms linking delirium and dementia.

Sleep and circadian rhythm dysfunctions are common clinical features of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Increasing evidence suggests that in addition to being 
a symptom, sleep disturbances can also drive the progression of 
neurodegeneration. Protein aggregation is a pathological hallmark of AD; 
however, the molecular pathways behind how sleep affects protein homeostasis 
remain elusive. Here we demonstrate that sleep modulation influences 
proteostasis and the progression of neurodegeneration in Drosophila models of 
tauopathy. We show that sleep deprivation enhanced Tau aggregational toxicity 
resulting in exacerbated synaptic degeneration. In contrast, sleep induction 
using gaboxadol led to reduced toxic Tau accumulation in neurons as a result of 
modulated autophagic flux and enhanced clearance of ubiquitinated Tau, 
suggesting altered protein processing and clearance that resulted in improved 
synaptic integrity and function. These findings highlight the complex 
relationship between sleep and regulation of protein homeostasis and the 
neuroprotective potential of sleep-enhancing therapeutics to slow the 
progression or delay the onset of neurodegeneration.

A Causal Mediation Approach to Account for Interaction of Treatment and 
Intercurrent Events: Using Hypothetical Strategy.

Hypothetical strategy is a common strategy for handling intercurrent events 
(IEs). No current guideline or study considers treatment-IE interaction to 
target the estimand in any one IE-handling strategy. Based on the hypothetical 
strategy, we aimed to (1) assess the performance of three estimators with 
different considerations for the treatment-IE interaction in a simulation and 
(2) compare the estimation of these estimators in a real trial. Simulation data 
were generalized based on realistic clinical trials of Alzheimer's disease. The 
estimand of interest was the effect of treatment with no IE occurring under the 
hypothetical strategy. Three estimators, namely, G-estimation with and without 
interaction and IE-ignored estimation, were compared in scenarios where the 
treatment-IE interaction effect was set as -50% to 50% of the main effect. Bias 
was the key performance measure. The real case was derived from a randomized 
trial of methadone maintenance treatment. Only G-estimation with interaction 
exhibited unbiased estimations regardless of the existence, direction or 
magnitude of the treatment-IE interaction in those scenarios. Neglecting the 
interaction and ignoring the IE would introduce a bias as large as 0.093 and 
0.241 (true value, -1.561) if the interaction effect existed. In the real case, 
compared with G-estimation with interaction, G-estimation without interaction 
and IE-ignored estimation increased the estimand of interest by 33.55% and 
34.36%, respectively. This study highlights the importance of considering 
treatment-IE interaction in the estimand framework. In practice, it would be 
better to include the interaction in the estimator by default.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is linked to the accumulation of Aβ, 
increased tau hyperphosphorylation, persistent neuroinflammation, and a decline 
in neurotrophic factors, neurogenesis, and synaptic plasticity. Oxytocin (OT) 
has a significant impact on memory and learning. We examined the influence of 
intranasal (IN) OT on synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis, histone acetylation, 
and spatial and cognitive memories in rats.
METHODS: Aβ25-35 (5 µg/2.5 µl) was administered bilaterally in the CA1 of male 
Wistar rats for four consecutive days. After seven days of recovery, OT 
(2 µg/µl, 10 µl in each nostril) was administered IN for seven consecutive days. 
Working, spatial, and cognitive memories, and gene expression of neurogenesis- 
and synaptic plasticity-involved factors were measured in the hippocampus. 
Histone acetylation (H3K9 and H4K8) was also measured using western blotting.
RESULTS: IN administration of OT significantly improved working and spatial 
memory impairment induced by Aβ and increased the factors involved in synaptic 
plasticity (MeCP2, REST, synaptophysin, and BDNF) and neurogenesis (Ki67 and 
DCX). We also found an enhancement in the levels of H3K9ac and H4K8ac following 
OT administration.
CONCLUSION: These findings indicated that IN OT could improve 
hippocampus-related behaviors by increasing synaptic plasticity, stimulating 
neurogenesis, and chromatin plasticity.

Mitochondria functionally degrade as neurons age. Degenerative changes cause 
inefficient oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and elevated electron leakage 
from the electron transport chain (ETC) promoting increased intramitochondrial 
generation of damaging reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species (ROS and 
RNS). The associated progressive accumulation of molecular damage causes an 
increasingly rapid decline in mitochondrial physiology contributing to aging. 
Melatonin, a multifunctional free radical scavenger and indirect antioxidant, is 
synthesized in the mitochondrial matrix of neurons. Melatonin reduces electron 
leakage from the ETC and elevates ATP production; it also detoxifies ROS/RNS and 
via the SIRT3/FOXO pathway it upregulates activities of superoxide dismutase 2 
and glutathione peroxidase. Melatonin also influences glucose processing by 
neurons. In neurogenerative diseases, neurons often adopt Warburg-type 
metabolism which excludes pyruvate from the mitochondria causing reduced 
intramitochondrial acetyl coenzyme A production. Acetyl coenzyme A supports the 
citric acid cycle and OXPHOS. Additionally, acetyl coenzyme A is a required 
co-substrate for arylalkylamine-N-acetyl transferase, which rate limits 
melatonin synthesis; therefore, melatonin production is diminished in cells that 
experience Warburg-type metabolism making mitochondria more vulnerable to 
oxidative stress. Moreover, endogenously produced melatonin diminishes during 
aging, further increasing oxidative damage to mitochondrial components. More 
normal mitochondrial physiology is preserved in aging neurons with melatonin 
supplementation.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD), a multifaceted neurodegenerative disorder, is 
increasingly understood through the regulatory lens of microRNAs (miRNAs). This 
review comprehensively examines the pivotal roles of miRNAs in AD pathogenesis, 
shedding light on their influence across various pathways. We delve into the 
biogenesis and mechanisms of miRNAs, emphasizing their significant roles in 
brain function and regulation. The review then navigates the complex landscape 
of AD pathogenesis, identifying key genetic, environmental, and molecular 
factors, with a focus on hallmark pathological features like amyloid-beta 
accumulation and tau protein hyperphosphorylation. Central to our discussion is 
the intricate involvement of miRNAs in these processes, highlighting their 
altered expression patterns in AD and subsequent functional implications, from 
amyloid-beta metabolism to tau pathology, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, 
and synaptic dysfunction. The predictive analysis of miRNA targets using 
computational methods, complemented by experimental validations, forms a crucial 
part of our discourse, unraveling the contributions of specific miRNAs to AD. 
Moreover, we explore the therapeutic potential of miRNAs as biomarkers and in 
miRNA-based interventions, while addressing the challenges in translating these 
findings into clinical practice. This review aims to enhance understanding of 
miRNAs in AD, offering a foundation for future research directions and novel 
therapeutic strategies.

Alzheimer disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder that affects 
synapses and leads to progressive cognitive decline. The role of 
N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors in the pathogenesis of AD is 
well-established as they contribute to excitotoxicity and neurodegeneration in 
the pathological process of extrasynaptic glutamate concentration. However, the 
therapeutic potential of the NMDA receptor antagonist memantine in rescuing 
synaptic damage is limited. Research indicates that 
α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) receptors also play a 
significant role in AD. Abnormal transcription, expression, and localization of 
AMPA receptors lead to synaptic dysfunction and damage, contributing to early 
cognitive impairment in AD patients. Understanding the impact of AMPA receptors 
on AD pathogenesis and exploring the potential for the development of AMPA 
receptor-targeting drugs are crucial. This review aims to consolidate recent 
research findings on AMPA receptors in AD, elucidate the current state of AMPA 
receptor research and lay the foundation for future basic research and drug 
development.

The discovery of effective multitarget-directed ligands (MTDLs) against 
multifactorial Alzheimer's disease (AD) remnants has been focused in an 
incessant drug discovery pursuit. In this perception, the current study explores 
the rational design, synthesis, and evaluation of 26 quinazolinone-hydrazine 
cyanoacetamide hybrids 7(a-j), 8(a-j), and 9(a-f) as MTDLs against AD. These new 
compounds were synthesized in four-step processes using simple phthalimide as 
the starting material without any major workup procedures and were characterized 
by different spectroscopic techniques. In Ellman's assay, the most potent 
analogues 7i, 8j, and 9d were identified as selective and mixed-type inhibitors 
of hAChE. Furthermore, biophysical and computational assessments revealed that 
the analogues 7i, 8j, and 9d were bound to both the catalytic active site and 
peripheral anionic site of hAChE with high affinity. The molecular dynamics 
simulation analysis highlighted the conformational changes of hAChE upon binding 
of 7i, 8j, and 9d and also the stability of resulting biomolecular systems all 
over 100 ns simulations. In addition to antioxidant activity, the most active 
congeners were found to protect substantially SK-N-SH cells from oxidative 
damage. Decisively, the most active analogues 7i, 8j, and 9d were assessed as 
potent Aβ1-42 fibril modulators and protective agents against Aβ1-42-induced 
toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells. Additionally, glioblastoma C6 cell-based assays also 
demonstrated the use of the most active congeners 7i, 8j, and 9d as protective 
agents against Aβ1-42-induced toxicity. Overall, this multifunctional capacity 
of quinazolinone-hydrazine cyanoacetamide hybrids demonstrated the noteworthy 
potential of these hybrids to develop as effectual MTDLs against AD. However, 
further pharmacokinetics, toxicology, and behavioral studies are warranted.

IMPORTANCE: Difficulties in identifying modifiable risk factors associated with 
daily physical activity may impede public health efforts to mitigate the adverse 
health outcomes of a sedentary lifestyle in an aging population.
OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that adding baseline sensor-derived mobility 
metrics to diverse baseline motor and nonmotor variables accounts for the 
unexplained variance of declining daily physical activity among older adults.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study analyzed data from 
participants of the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP), an ongoing longitudinal 
clinical pathological study that began to enroll older adults (age range, 
59.4-104.9 years) in 1997. Wrist- and waist-worn sensors were added to MAP in 
2005 and 2012, respectively, to record participants' physical activity and 
mobility performances. Included participants were examined at baseline and 
annually followed up for a mean (SD) duration of 4.2 (1.6) years.
EXPOSURE: Twelve blocks of variables, including 3 blocks of mobility metrics 
derived from recordings of a belt-worn sensor to quantify a 32-foot walk, a 
Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, and a standing balance task, and 9 other blocks with 
41 additional variables.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: A linear mixed-effects model was used to estimate 
the person-specific rate of change (slope) of total daily physical activity 
obtained from a wrist-worn sensor. Twelve linear regression models were used to 
estimate the adjusted R2 to quantify the associations of the variables with the 
slope.
RESULTS: A total of 650 older adults (500 females [76.9%]; mean [SD] age at 
baseline, 81.4 [7.5] years; 31 Black individuals [4.8%], 17 Latino individuals 
[2.6%], and 602 White individuals [92.6%]) were included. During follow-up, all 
but 1 participant showed declining daily physical activity, which was equivalent 
to approximately 16.8% decrease in activity level per year. In separate models, 
waist sensor-derived mobility metrics (32-foot walk: adjusted R2, 23.4% [95% CI, 
17.3%-30.6%]; TUG test: adjusted R2, 22.8% [95% CI, 17.7%-30.1%]) and 
conventional motor variables (adjusted R2, 24.1% [95% CI, 17.7%-31.4%]) had the 
largest percentages of variance of declining daily physical activity compared 
with nonmotor variables. When the significant variables from all 12 blocks were 
included together in a single model, only turning speed (estimate [SE], 0.018 
[0.006]; P = .005) and hand dexterity (estimate [SE], 0.091 [0.034]; P = .008) 
showed associations with declining daily physical activity.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Findings of this study suggest that sensor-derived 
mobility metrics and conventional motor variables compared with nonmotor 
measures explained most of the variance of declining daily physical activity. 
Further studies are needed to ascertain whether improving specific motor 
abilities, such as turning speed and hand dexterity, is effective in slowing the 
decline of daily physical activity in older adults.

Aim: Preparation of quercetin fullerene conjugate (QFC) for nose-to-brain 
delivery and their in vitro and ex vivo characterizations.Methods: Carboxylated 
fullerene was converted into acetylated fullerene and quercetin was conjugated 
and physically adsorbed on acetylated fullerene.Results: The particle size and 
zeta potential of QFC and chitosan-coated QFC (CC-QFC) were found to be 
179.2 ± 1.10, 293.4 ± 2.757, -5.28 ± 1.43 and 11.6 ± 0.4 respectively. The 
entrapment efficiency, loading efficiency of QFC were found to be 85.55% and 
42.77%. The MTT assay revealed 80.69% SH-SY5Y cell viability at a concentration 
of 50 μg/ml. CC-QFC showed remarkable (89.20%) ex vivo mucoadhesive properties 
compared with QFC (66.67%). Further study showed no significant ciliotoxicity by 
CC-QFC.Conclusion: The obtained results suggested the potential of CC-QFC for 
treatment in Alzheimer's disease.

Plain Language Summary: In our study, we developed a new method to deliver a 
natural substance called quercetin into the brain for the treatment of 
Alzheimer's disease. Quercetin is known for its health benefits, especially in 
protecting brain cells. We combined quercetin with a tiny carbon-based material 
called fullerene, which looks like a soccer ball, to create a new compound 
called quercetin fullerene conjugate (QFC). This QFC was designed to help 
quercetin reach the brain more effectively. To make it even better at reaching 
the brain, we coated QFC with a substance called chitosan. Coating it with 
chitosan can help to adhere it to nasal cavity for longer time for the delivery 
of quercetin to the brain. Importantly, our studies showed that this modified 
form of quercetin did not harm brain cells or the lining of the nose.Overall, 
our findings suggest that this new approach could be a promising way to develop 
treatments for Alzheimer's disease.

Previous studies have suggested that N6-methyladenosine (mA) modification of RNA 
affects fundamental aspects of RNA metabolism, and mA dysregulation is 
implicated in various human diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). This 
study is designed to explore the role and mechanism of methyltransferase-like 14 
(METTL14) in the pathogenesis of AD. SK-N-SH cells were treated with Aβ1-42 to 
establish an in vitro model of AD. Cerebellin 4 (CBLN4) and METTL14 expression 
levels were detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction 
(RT-qPCR). Cell viability and apoptosis were analyzed using 
3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) 
assay and flow cytometry assay. B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2 related X 
protein (Bax), C-caspase-3, total-caspase-3, C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), 
and glucose-related protein 78 (GRP78) protein levels were determined using 
Western blot. Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) levels 
were analyzed using ELISA. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), 
and superoxide dismutase (SOD) products were examined using special assay kits. 
Interaction between CBLN4 and METTL14 was verified using methylated RNA 
immunoprecipitation (MeRIP) and dual-luciferase reporter assays. CBLN4 and 
METTL14 expression was decreased in Aβ1-42-treated SK-N-SH cells. Upregulation 
of CBLN4 relieved Aβ1-42-induced SK-N-SH cell apoptosis, inflammation, oxidative 
stress, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in vitro. At the molecular level, 
METTL14 could improve the stability and expression of CBLN4 mRNA via m6A 
methylation. Our findings indicated that m6A methylase METTL14-mediated 
upregulation of CBLN4 mRNA stability could repress Aβ1-42-triggered SK-N-SH cell 
injury, providing a promising therapeutic target for AD treatment.

The aggregation of β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) is associated with neurodegenerative 
diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Several therapies aimed at reducing 
the aggregation of this peptide have emerged as potential strategies for the 
treatment of AD. This paper describes the design and preparation of new hybrid 
molecules based on steroids, selenosugars, and [60]fullerene as potential 
inhibitors of Aβ oligomerization. These moieties were selected based on their 
antioxidant properties and possible areas of interaction with the Aβ. 
Cyclopropanations between C60 and malonates bearing different steroid and 
selenosugar moieties using the Bingel-Hirsch protocol have enabled the synthesis 
of functionalized molecular hybrids. The obtained derivatives were characterized 
by physical and spectroscopic techniques. Theoretical calculations for all the 
selenium compounds were performed using the density functional theory 
DFT/B3LYP-D3(BJ)/6-311G(2d,p) predicting the most stable conformations of the 
synthesized derivatives. Relevant geometrical parameters were investigated to 
relate the stereochemical behavior and the spectroscopic data obtained. The 
affinity of the compounds for Aβ-peptide was estimated by molecular docking 
simulation, which predicted an increase in affinity and interactions for Aβ for 
the hybrids containing the C60 core. In addition, parameters such as 
lipophilicity, polar surface area, and dipole moment were calculated to predict 
their potential interaction with membrane cells.

INTRODUCTION: Neuroanatomical normative modeling captures individual variability 
in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we used normative modeling to track 
individuals' disease progression in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 
and patients with AD.
METHODS: Cortical and subcortical normative models were generated using healthy 
controls (n ≈ 58k). These models were used to calculate regional z scores in 
3233 T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging time-series scans from 1181 
participants. Regions with z scores < -1.96 were classified as outliers mapped 
on the brain and summarized by total outlier count (tOC).
RESULTS: tOC increased in AD and in people with MCI who converted to AD and also 
correlated with multiple non-imaging markers. Moreover, a higher annual rate of 
change in tOC increased the risk of progression from MCI to AD. Brain outlier 
maps identified the hippocampus as having the highest rate of change.
DISCUSSION: Individual patients' atrophy rates can be tracked by using regional 
outlier maps and tOC.
HIGHLIGHTS: Neuroanatomical normative modeling was applied to serial Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data for the first time. Deviation 
from the norm (outliers) of cortical thickness or brain volume was computed in 
3233 scans. The number of brain-structure outliers increased over time in people 
with AD. Patterns of change in outliers varied markedly between individual 
patients with AD. People with mild cognitive impairment whose outliers increased 
over time had a higher risk of progression from AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe progressive neurodegenerative condition 
associated with neuronal damage and reduced cognitive function that primarily 
affects the aged worldwide. While there is increasing evidence suggesting that 
mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the most significant factors contributing to 
AD, its accurate pathobiology remains unclear. Mitochondrial bioenergetics and 
homeostasis are impaired and defected during AD pathogenesis. However, the 
potential of mutations in nuclear or mitochondrial DNA encoding mitochondrial 
constituents to cause mitochondrial dysfunction has been considered since it is 
one of the intracellular processes commonly compromised in early AD stages. 
Additionally, electron transport chain dysfunction and mitochondrial 
pathological protein interactions are related to mitochondrial dysfunction in 
AD. Many mitochondrial parameters decline during aging, causing an imbalance in 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, leading to oxidative stress in 
age-related AD. Moreover, neuroinflammation is another potential causative 
factor in AD-associated mitochondrial dysfunction. While several treatments 
targeting mitochondrial dysfunction have undergone preclinical studies, few have 
been successful in clinical trials. Therefore, this review discusses the 
molecular mechanisms and different therapeutic approaches for correcting 
mitochondrial dysfunction in AD, which have the potential to advance the future 
development of novel drug-based AD interventions.

INTRODUCTION: Speech-based testing shows promise for sensitive and scalable 
objective screening for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but research to date offers 
limited evidence of generalizability.
METHODS: Data were taken from the AMYPRED (Amyloid Prediction in Early Stage 
Alzheimer's Disease from Acoustic and Linguistic Patterns of Speech) studies 
(N = 101, N = 46 mild cognitive impairment [MCI]) and Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative 4 (ADNI4) remote digital (N = 426, N = 58 self-reported 
MCI, mild AD or dementia) and in-clinic (N = 57, N = 13 MCI) cohorts, in which 
participants provided audio-recorded responses to automated remote story recall 
tasks in the Storyteller test battery. Text similarity, lexical, temporal, and 
acoustic speech feature sets were extracted. Models predicting early AD were 
developed in AMYPRED and tested out of sample in the demographically more 
diverse cohorts in ADNI4 (> 33% from historically underrepresented populations).
RESULTS: Speech models generalized well to unseen data in ADNI4 remote and 
in-clinic cohorts. The best-performing models evaluated text-based metrics (text 
similarity, lexical features: area under the curve 0.71-0.84 across cohorts).
DISCUSSION: Speech-based predictions of early AD from Storyteller generalize 
across diverse samples.
HIGHLIGHTS: The Storyteller speech-based test is an objective digital 
prescreener for Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 4 (ADNI4). 
Speech-based models predictive of Alzheimer's disease (AD) were developed in the 
AMYPRED (Amyloid Prediction in Early Stage Alzheimer's Disease from Acoustic and 
Linguistic Patterns of Speech) sample (N = 101). Models were tested out of 
sample in ADNI4 in-clinic (N = 57) and remote (N = 426) cohorts. Models showed 
good generalization out of sample. Models evaluating text matching and lexical 
features were most predictive of early AD.

BACKGROUND: Senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) and age-matched SAMR1 
mice are used to study the pathogenesis and therapeutics of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD); however, the molecular mechanisms are not completely understood.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the effects of the 5-month administration 
of formononetin in SAMP8 mice and used RNA-seq to explore the molecular targets.
METHODS: SAMP8 mice were orally administered formononetin (0, 8, and 16 mg/kg) 
from 4 months of age, and age-matched SAMR1 mice were used as controls. 
Behavioral tests were performed in 9-month-old mice, followed by histopathologic 
analysis. Total RNA from the hippocampus was isolated and subjected to RNA-seq, 
RT-qPCR, and bioinformatics analysis.
RESULTS: The 9-month-old SAMP8 mice exhibited cognition deficits, evidenced by 
novel object recognition, open-field test, elevated plus maze, and passive 
avoidance. Nissl bodies in the cortex and hippocampus were decreased. 
Formononetin treatments ameliorated behavioral deficits and improved 
morphological changes, which were evidenced by Nissl and H&E staining. RNA-seq 
revealed distinct gene expression patterns between SAMP8 and SAMR1 mice. 
Differentially expressed genes in SAMP8 mice were attenuated or normalized by 
formononetin. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) of canonical pathway and upstream 
regulators revealed increases in proinflammatory factors and immune dysfunction 
and decreases in NRF2 and SIRT-1 signaling pathways, leading to 
neuroinflammation. Formononetin treatment attenuated or reversed these molecular 
changes. The transcriptome of SAMP8 mice was correlated with transcriptomic 
profiles of other AD mouse models in the GEO database.
CONCLUSION: Neuroinflammation and decreased antioxidant and SIRT-1 signaling 
contributed to cognitive deficits in aged SAMP8 mice, which are potential 
therapeutic targets of formononetin in combination with other therapies.

Objective: The objective of the study is to investigate whether quercetin 
ameliorates Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like pathology in APP/PS1 double transgenic 
mice and its hypothesized mechanism, contributing to the comprehension of AD 
pathogenesis. Methods: A total of 30 APP/PS1 transgenic mice were randomized 
into model group (APP/PS1), quercetin group (APP/PS1+Q), and donepezil 
hydrochloride group (APP/PS1+DON). Simultaneously, there were 10 C57 mice of the 
same age served as a control group. Three months posttreatment, the effects of 
quercetin on AD mice were evaluated using the Morris water maze (MWM) test, Y 
maze experiment, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and western blotting. 
Results: Results from the water maze and Y maze indicated that quercetin 
significantly improved cognitive impairment in APP/PS1 transgenic AD mice. 
Additionally, serum enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) results 
demonstrated that quercetin elevated MDA, superoxide dismutase (SOD), CAT, GSH, 
acetylcholine (ACh), and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) levels in AD mice. 
Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, Nissl staining, and hippocampal tissue 
thioflavine staining revealed that quercetin reduced neuronal damage and Aβ 
protein accumulation in AD mice. Western blot validated protein expression in 
the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1)/nuclear factor erythroid 
2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/HO-1 pathway associated with oxidative stress and 
apoptosis, confirming quercetin's potential molecular mechanism of enhancing AD 
mouse cognition. Furthermore, western blot findings indicate that quercetin 
significantly alters protein expression in the Keap1/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. 
Moreover, molecular docking analysis suggests that Keap1, NQO1, HO-1, caspase-3, 
Bcl-2, and Bax proteins in the Keap1/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway may be potential 
regulatory targets of quercetin. These findings will provide a molecular basis 
for quercetin's clinical application in AD treatment. Conclusion: Quercetin can 
improve cognitive impairment and AD-like pathology in APP/PS1 double transgenic 
mice, potentially related to quercetin's activation of the Keap1/Nrf2/HO-1 
pathway and reduction of cell apoptosis.

Dear colleagues, It is my pleasure and honor to host the 68th Annual Meeting of 
the German Society of Neuropathology and Neuroanatomy (DGNN) in Regensburg. 
Since the Magdeburg meeting in 2019 this is the first pure national meeting of 
our society that will be held in presence after five long years. While the 
meeting in 2020 was cancelled due to the Corona pandemic, the 2021 meeting 
(organized by the colleagues in Gießen) took place as a mere online meeting. In 
2022 and 2023 our national society meetings were embedded in the "Neurowoche" 
and the International Congress of Neuropathology in Berlin. We are enthusiastic 
about this years' reunion of our society in Regensburg. In our Regensburg 
meeting, we aim to provide a comprehensive update on the major and hot topics in 
neuropathology. Neuropathologists address some of the currently most relevant 
and discussed health care issues, such as for example cancer, neuroimmunological 
diseases like Multiple Sclerosis, neurodegenerative diseases including 
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, and muscle/nerve diseases. As tissue specialists, 
neuropathologists directly study diseases in human materials. Neuropathologists 
use state of-the-art methods to uncover disease processes on the molecular 
level. During our congress, we will hear a lot on the methodical progress made 
in this regard. Neuropathology is also becoming increasingly clinical as many of 
our scientific and diagnostic findings influence and directly guide treatment 
decisions. We were able to attract renowned national and international speakers 
and our meeting will allow for an intensive interchange both within our society 
and with our neighboring disciplines. Program highlights include a Pre-Congress 
hands-on Workshop on Next Generation Sequencing, a session on Molecular 
Tumorboards and a Mini-Symposium on Quality Assurance in Neuropathology. We are 
delighted about the submission of 31 abstracts covering the research fields 
Neurooncology, Neuroimmunology, Muscle/Nerve, Neurodegeneration, and 
Methods/Free Topics. The abstracts are published below in this edition of Free 
Neuropathology. I want to thank the scientific committee of our congress for 
helping in evaluating the submissions and selecting the poster talks and poster 
spotlight presentations. Many of the abstracts were submitted by our young 
researchers. They deserve our special attention! Posters will be exhibited 
throughout the entire congress and we will have plenty of time for poster 
viewing and discussions on Thursday evening at the Welcome Reception and at the 
main poster session on Friday at noon. So let me again welcome you all to our 
beautiful city of Regensburg. I am looking forward to inspiring talks, vivid 
discussions and enriching encounters with like-minded people. Yours, Prof. Dr. 
Markus J. Riemenschneider Regensburg University Hospital, Department of 
Neuropathology Congress President DGNN Annual Meeting 2024.

Rapid advances in human brain organoid technologies have prompted the question 
of their consciousness. Although brain organoids resemble many facets of the 
brain, their shortcomings strongly suggest that they do not fit any of the 
operational definitions of consciousness. As organoids gain internal processing 
systems through statistical learning and closed loop algorithms, interact with 
the external world, and become embodied through fusion with other organ systems, 
questions of biosynthetic consciousness will arise.

BACKGROUND: Few rare variants have been identified in genetic loci from 
genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of Alzheimer's disease (AD), limiting 
understanding of mechanisms, risk assessment, and genetic counseling.
METHODS: Using genome sequencing data from 197 families in the National 
Institute on Aging Alzheimer's Disease Family Based Study and 214 Caribbean 
Hispanic families, we searched for rare coding variants within known GWAS loci 
from the largest published study.
RESULTS: Eighty-six rare missense or loss-of-function (LoF) variants completely 
segregated in 17.5% of families, but in 91 (22.1%) families Apolipoprotein E 
(APOE)-𝜀4 was the only variant segregating. However, in 60.3% of families, APOE 
𝜀4, missense, and LoF variants were not found within the GWAS loci.
DISCUSSION: Although APOE 𝜀4and several rare variants were found to segregate in 
both family datasets, many families had no variant accounting for their disease. 
This suggests that familial AD may be the result of unidentified rare variants.
HIGHLIGHTS: Rare coding variants from GWAS loci segregate in familial 
Alzheimer's disease. Missense or loss of function variants were found 
segregating in nearly 7% of families. APOE-𝜀4 was the only segregating variant 
in 29.7% in familial Alzheimer's disease. In Hispanic and non-Hispanic families, 
different variants were found in segregating genes. No coding variants were 
found segregating in many Hispanic and non-Hispanic families.

Cognitive training has gained popularity as a means to aid older adults with 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a transitional phase between normal ageing and 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). MCI represents a critical and potentially reversible 
state that can either improve or progress to full-blown dementia. This study 
aims to evaluate the impact of cognitive training on cognitive function in aged 
patients with MCI. PubMed, Embase, Medline, Web of Science, China National 
Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang databases were systematically 
retrieved from inception until May 2024. We rigorously applied the risk-of-bias 
methodology recommended by the Cochrane Handbook to assess the quality of the 
included studies. After two rounds of screening and removing duplicates, a total 
of 2685 articles were initially identified, from which 28 met the inclusion 
criteria. The meta-analysis included 28 randomised controlled trials with 1960 
participants. In this meta-analysis, Review Manager 5.4 was used for statistical 
analysis. Findings revealed that cognitive training significantly improved the 
global cognitive function in aged MCI patients, as evidenced by the results of 
the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (standard mean difference (SMD) = 3.26; 95% 
CI, 2.69-3.82; P < 0.00001) and Mini-Mental State Examination (SMD = 2.27; 95% 
CI, 1.52-3.01; P < 0.00001). The beneficial effects of cognitive training 
interventions were consistent regardless of duration, including periods of 
2 months or less (SMD = 1.94; 95% CI, 1.25-2.63; P < 0.00001), 2 to 6 months 
(SMD = 2.53; 95% CI, 1.52-3.53; P < 0.00001), and over 6 months (SMD = 4.12; 95% 
CI, 0.97-7.27; P = 0.01). The analysis indicates that cognitive training 
significantly benefits overall cognitive function, delayed memory, orientation, 
attention, and language skills in aged patients with MCI. Furthermore, cognitive 
training interventions are effective in enhancing cognitive function, 
irrespective of their duration.

INTRODUCTION: The importance of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis is rapidly increasing, and there is a growing 
interest in the use of CSF biomarkers in monitoring the response to therapy, 
especially in the light of newly available approaches to the therapy of 
neurodegenerative diseases.
AREAS COVERED: In this review we discuss the most relevant measures of 
neurodegeneration that are being used to distinguish patients with AD from 
healthy controls and individuals with mild cognitive impairment, in order to 
provide an overview of the latest information available in the scientific 
literature. We focus on markers related to amyloid processing, markers 
associated with neurofibrillary tangles, neuroinflammation, neuroaxonal injury 
and degeneration, synaptic loss and dysfunction, and markers of α-synuclein 
pathology.
EXPERT OPINION: In addition to neuropsychological evaluation, core CSF 
biomarkers (Aβ42, t-tau, and p-tau181) have been recommended for improvement of 
timely, accurate and differential diagnosis of AD, as well as to assess the risk 
and rate of disease progression. In addition to the core CSF biomarkers, various 
other markers related to synaptic dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and glial 
activation (neurogranin, SNAP-25, Nfl, YKL-40, TREM2) are now investigated and 
have yet to be validated for future potential clinical use in AD diagnosis.

Neuroinflammation is an innate and adaptive immune response initiated by the 
release of inflammatory mediators from various immune cells in response to 
harmful stimuli. While initially beneficial and protective, prolonged or 
excessive neuroinflammation has been identified in clinical and experimental 
studies as a key pathological driver of numerous neurological diseases and an 
accelerant of the aging process. Glycolysis, the metabolic process that converts 
glucose to pyruvate or lactate to produce adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP), is 
often dysregulated in many neuroinflammatory disorders and in the affected nerve 
cells. Enhancing glucose availability and uptake, as well as increasing 
glycolytic flux through pharmacological or genetic manipulation of glycolytic 
enzymes, has shown potential protective effects in several animal models of 
neuroinflammatory diseases. Modulating the glycolytic pathway to improve glucose 
metabolism and ATP production may help alleviate energy deficiencies associated 
with these conditions. In this review, we examine six neuroinflammatory 
diseases-stroke, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), 
Huntington's disease (HD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and 
depression-and provide evidence supporting the role of glycolysis in their 
treatment. We also explore the potential link between inflammation-induced aging 
and glycolysis. Additionally, we briefly discuss the critical role of glycolysis 
in three types of neuronal cells-neurons, microglia, and astrocytes-within 
physiological processes. This review highlights the significance of glycolysis 
in the pathology of neuroinflammatory diseases and its relevance to the aging 
process.

Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), a non-receptor-type tyrosine kinase, has a wide 
range of physiological functions. A possible role of Syk in Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) has been proposed. We evaluated the localization of Syk in the brains of 
patients with AD and control participants. Human neuroblastoma M1C cells 
harboring wild-type tau (4R0N) were used with the tetracycline off (TetOff) 
induction system. In this model of neuronal tauopathy, the effects of the Syk 
inhibitors-BAY 61-3606 and R406-on tau phosphorylation and oligomerization were 
explored using several phosphorylated tau-specific antibodies and an oligomeric 
tau antibody, and the effects of these Syk inhibitors on autophagy were examined 
using western blot analyses. Moreover, the effects of the Syk inhibitor R406 
were evaluated in vivo using wild-type mice. In AD brains, Syk and 
phosphorylated tau colocalized in the cytosol. In M1C cells, Syk protein 
(72 kDa) was detected using western blot analysis. Syk inhibitors decreased the 
expression levels of several tau phosphoepitopes including PHF-1, CP13, AT180, 
and AT270. Syk inhibitors also decreased the levels of caspase-cleaved tau 
(TauC3), a pathological tau form. Syk inhibitors increased inactivated glycogen 
synthase kinase 3β expression and decreased active p38 mitogen-activated protein 
kinase expression and demethylated protein phosphatase 2 A levels, indicating 
that Syk inhibitors inactivate tau kinases and activate tau phosphatases. Syk 
inhibitors also activated autophagy, as indicated by increased LC3II and 
decreased p62 levels. In vivo, the Syk inhibitor R406 decreased phosphorylated 
tau levels in wild-type mice. These findings suggest that Syk inhibitors offer 
novel therapeutic strategies for tauopathies, including AD.

A combination of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) at 
non-psychoactive doses was previously demonstrated to reduce cognitive decline 
in APP/PS1 mice, an animal model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the 
neurobiological substrates underlying these therapeutic properties of Δ9-THC and 
CBD are not fully understood. Considering that dysregulation of glutamatergic 
activity contributes to cognitive impairment in AD, the present study evaluates 
the hypothesis that the combination of these two natural cannabinoids might 
reverse the alterations in glutamate dynamics within the hippocampus of this 
animal model of AD. Interestingly, our findings reveal that chronic treatment 
with Δ9-THC and CBD, but not with any of them alone, reduces extracellular 
glutamate levels and the basal excitability of the hippocampus in APP/PS1 mice. 
These effects are not related to significant changes in the function and 
structure of glutamate synapses, as no relevant changes in synaptic plasticity, 
glutamate signaling or in the levels of key components of these synapses were 
observed in cannabinoid-treated mice. Our data instead indicate that these 
cannabinoid effects are associated with the control of glutamate uptake and/or 
to the regulation of the hippocampal network. Taken together, these results 
support the potential therapeutic properties of combining these natural 
cannabinoids against the excitotoxicity that occurs in AD brains.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder, 
characterized pathologically by extracellular deposition of β-amyloid (Aβ) into 
senile plaques and intracellular accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau (pTau) 
as neurofibrillary tangles. Clinically, AD patients show memory deterioration 
with varying cognitive dysfunctions. The exact molecular mechanisms underlying 
AD are still not fully understood, and there are no efficient drugs to stop or 
reverse the disease progression. In this review, we first provide an update on 
how the risk factors, including APOE variants, infections and inflammation, 
contribute to AD; how Aβ and tau become abnormally accumulated and how this 
accumulation plays a role in AD neurodegeneration. Then we summarize the 
commonly used experimental models, diagnostic and prediction strategies, and 
advances in periphery biomarkers from high-risk populations for AD. Finally, we 
introduce current status of development of disease-modifying drugs, including 
the newly officially approved Aβ vaccines, as well as novel and promising 
strategies to target the abnormal pTau. Together, this paper was aimed to update 
AD research progress from fundamental mechanisms to the clinical diagnosis and 
therapies.

Methylglyoxal (MG) serves as the primary precursor for the nonenzymatic 
glycation of proteins and DNA, leading to advanced glycation end products 
(AGEs). Regular intake of dietary MG is strongly correlated with low-grade 
inflammation, potentially accelerating the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases, 
including obesity, diabetes, cancers, liver diseases, Alzheimer's disease, 
cardiovascular diseases, aging, and bone loss. Although pharmaceutical agents 
(pimagedine and candesartan) have been developed to inhibit MG formation, they 
often come with serious side effects (nausea, diarrhea, headache, 
gastrointestinal disturbance, symptomatic hypotension, abnormal renal and liver 
function tests, development of antinuclear antibody, pernicious-like anemia, and 
hyperkalemia), highlighting the need for an efficient and safe approach to 
scavenging MG. Phyllanthus emblica Linn fruit, a nutritious edible fruit, and 
medicinal plant contains over 300 bioactive compounds. Among twenty-three 
herbals, 100 μg/mL of the aqueous extract of Phyllanthus emblica fruit (APF) 
exhibits the highest potency in trapping MG, achieving an 87.3 % reduction under 
d-fructose induced BSA-AGEs formation. However, there are few reports detailing 
APF and its related foods' specific impact on disease prevention through MG 
trapping. This review summarizes the mechanisms through which MG is linked to 
the development of metabolic diseases and provides several strategies for 
reducing MG levels using APF and its bioactive compounds. The potential 
antiglycation properties of APF may offer new applications in the food industry 
and pharmacological research.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) severely impacts the lives of many patients and their 
families. Predicting the progression of the disease from the early stage of mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) is of substantial value for treatment, medical 
research and clinical trials. In this paper, we propose a novel dual attention 
network to classify progressive MCI (pMCI) and stable MCI (sMCI) using both 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neurocognitive metadata. A 3D CNN 
ShuffleNet V2 model is used as the network backbone to extract MRI image 
features. Then, neurocognitive metadata is used to guide the spatial attention 
mechanism to steer the model to focus attention on the most discriminative 
regions of the brain. In contrast to traditional fusion methods, we propose a 
ViT based self attention fusion mechanism to fuse the neurocognitive metadata 
with the 3D CNN feature maps. The experimental results show that our proposed 
model achieves an accuracy, AUC, and sensitivity of 81.34%, 0.874, and 0.85 
respectively using 5-fold cross validation evaluation. A comprehensive 
experimental study shows our proposed approach significantly outperforms all 
previous methods for MCI progression classification. In addition, an ablation 
study shows both fusion methods contribute to the high final performance.

While blood-based tests are readily available for various conditions, including 
cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, and common cancers, Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases lack an early blood-based 
screening test that can be used in primary care. Major efforts have been made 
towards the investigation of approaches that may lead to minimally invasive, 
cost-effective, and reliable tests capable of measuring brain pathological 
status. Here, we review past and current technologies developed to investigate 
biomarkers of AD, including novel blood-based approaches and the more 
established cerebrospinal fluid and neuroimaging biomarkers of disease. The 
utility of blood as a source of AD-related biomarkers in both clinical practice 
and interventional trials is discussed, supported by a comprehensive list of 
clinical trials for AD drugs and interventions that list biomarkers as primary 
or secondary endpoints. We highlight that identifying individuals in early 
preclinical AD using blood-based biomarkers will improve clinical trials and the 
optimization of therapeutic treatments as they become available. Lastly, we 
discuss challenges that remain in the field and address new approaches being 
developed, such as the examination of cargo packaged within extracellular 
vesicles of neuronal origin isolated from peripheral blood.

The search for biomarkers for the early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases 
is a growing area. Numerous investigations are exploring minimally invasive and 
cost-effective biomarkers, with the detection of phosphorylated Tau (pTau) 
protein emerging as one of the most promising fields. pTau is the main component 
of the paired helical filaments found in the brains of Alzheimer's disease cases 
and serves as a precursor in the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). 
Recent research has revealed that analysis of p-Tau181, p-Tau217 and p-Tau231 in 
blood may be an option for detecting the preclinical stage of Alzheimer's 
disease. In this study, we have analyzed the values of pTau 181 in the serum of 
Syrian hamsters during hibernation. Naturally, over the course of hibernation, 
these animals exhibit a reversible accumulation of pTau in the brain tissue, 
which rapidly disappears upon awakening. A biosensing system based on the 
interferometric optical detection method was used to measure the concentration 
of pTau181 protein in serum samples from Syrian hamsters. This method eliminates 
the matrix effect and amplifies the signal obtained by using silicon dioxide 
nanoparticles (SiO2 NPs) biofunctionalized with the αpTau181 antibody. Our 
results indicate a substantial increase in the serum concentration of pTau in 
threonine-181 during hibernation, which disappears completely 2-3 h after 
awakening. Investigating the mechanism by which pTau protein appears in the 
blood non-pathologically may enhance current diagnostic techniques. Furthermore, 
since this process is reversible, and no tangles are detected in the brains of 
hibernating hamsters, additional analysis may contribute to the discovery of 
improved biomarkers. Additionally, exploring drugs targeting pTau to prevent the 
formation of tangles or studying the outcomes of any pTau-targeted treatment 
could be valuable.

Although there are several genome-wide association studies available which 
highlight genetic variants associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), often the X 
chromosome is excluded from the analysis. We conducted an X-chromosome-wide 
association study (XWAS) in three independent studies with a pathologically 
confirmed phenotype (total 1970 cases and 1113 controls). The XWAS was performed 
in males and females separately, and these results were then meta-analysed. Four 
suggestively associated genes were identified which may be of potential interest 
for further study in AD, these are DDX53 (rs12006935, OR = 0.52, p = 6.9e-05), 
IL1RAPL1 (rs6628450, OR = 0.36, p = 4.2e-05; rs137983810, OR = 0.52, 
p = 0.0003), TBX22 (rs5913102, OR = 0.74, p = 0.0003) and SH3BGRL (rs186553004, 
OR = 0.35, p = 0.0005; rs113157993, OR = 0.52, p = 0.0003), which replicate 
across at least two studies. The SNP rs5913102 in TBX22 achieves chromosome-wide 
significance in meta-analysed data. DDX53 shows highest expression in 
astrocytes, IL1RAPL1 is most highly expressed in oligodendrocytes and neurons 
and SH3BGRL is most highly expressed in microglia. We have also identified SNPs 
in the NXF5 gene at chromosome-wide significance in females (rs5944989, 
OR = 0.62, p = 1.1e-05) but not in males (p = 0.83). The discovery of relevant 
AD associated genes on the X chromosome may identify AD risk differences and 
similarities based on sex and lead to the development of sex-stratified 
therapeutics.

β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme (BACE1) represents a key target 
for Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapy because it is essential for producing the 
toxic amyloid β (Aβ) peptide that plays a crucial role in the disease's 
development. BACE1 inhibitors are a promising approach to reducing Aβ levels in 
the brain and preventing AD progression. However, systemic delivery of such 
inhibitors to the brain demonstrates limited efficacy because of the presence of 
the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Nose-to-brain (NtB) delivery has the potential to 
overcome this obstacle. Liposomal drug delivery systems offer several advantages 
over traditional methods for delivering drugs and nucleic acids from the nose to 
the brain. The current study aims to prepare, characterize, and evaluate in 
vitro liposomal forms of donepezil, memantine, BACE-1 siRNA, and their 
combination for possible treatment of AD via NtB delivery. All the liposomal 
formulations were prepared using the rotary evaporation method. Their cellular 
internalization, cytotoxicity, and the suppression of beta-amyloid plaque and 
other pro-inflammatory cytokine expressions were studied. The Calu-3 Transwell 
model was used as an in vitro system for mimicking the anatomical and 
physiological conditions of the nasal epithelium and studying the suitability of 
the proposed formulations for possible NtB delivery. The investigation results 
show that liposomes provided the effective intracellular delivery of 
therapeutics, the potential to overcome tight junctions in BBB, reduced 
beta-amyloid plaque accumulation and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, 
supporting the therapeutic potential of our approach.

IMPORTANCE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the 
elderly with the incidence rising exponentially after the age of 65 years. 
Unfortunately, effective treatments are extremely limited and definite diagnosis 
can only be made at autopsy. This is in part due to our limited understanding of 
the complex pathophysiology, including the various genetic, environmental, and 
metabolic contributing factors. In an effort to better understand this complex 
disease, researchers have employed nonhuman primates as translational models.
CASE PRESENTATION: This report aims to describe the AD-like neuropathology in 
the brain of a 37-year-old female baboon (Papio hamadryas), which at the time of 
her death made her the oldest hamadryas baboon at any member institution of the 
Association of Zoos and Aquariums. A diagnostic necropsy was performed, and the 
brain was evaluated for neurodegenerative disease. Frequent amyloid-β deposits 
were identified, consistent with what has been described in other geriatric 
nonhuman primates. Phospho-tau pathology, including neurofibrillary tangles, a 
feature not well-described in other primate models, was also abundant.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our results suggest that more detailed, prospective, 
longitudinal studies are warranted utilizing this particular species to see if 
they represent a viable model for human brain aging.

Objective.With prolonged life expectancy, the incidence of memory deficits, 
especially in Alzheimer's disease (AD), has increased. Although multiple 
treatments have been evaluated, no promising treatment has been found to date. 
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the fornix area was explored as a possible 
treatment because the fornix is intimately connected to memory-related areas 
that are vulnerable in AD; however, a proper imaging biomarker for assessing the 
therapeutic efficiency of forniceal DBS in AD has not been 
established.Approach.This study assessed the efficacy and safety of DBS by 
estimating the optimal intersection volume between the volume of tissue 
activated and the fornix. Utilizing a gold-electroplating process, the 
microelectrode's surface area on the neural probe was increased, enhancing 
charge transfer performance within potential water window limits. Bilateral 
fornix implantation was conducted in triple-transgenic AD mice (3 × Tg-AD) and 
wild-type mice (strain: B6129SF1/J), with forniceal DBS administered exclusively 
to 3 × Tg-AD mice in the DBS-on group. Behavioral tasks, diffusion tensor 
imaging (DTI), and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were performed in all mice to 
assess the therapeutic efficacy of forniceal DBS.Main results.The results 
illustrated that memory deficits and increased anxiety-like behavior in 3 × 
Tg-AD mice were rescued by forniceal DBS. Furthermore, forniceal DBS positively 
altered DTI indices, such as increasing fractional anisotropy (FA) and 
decreasing mean diffusivity (MD), together with reducing microglial cell and 
astrocyte counts, suggesting a potential causal relationship between revised 
FA/MD and reduced cell counts in the anterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus, 
fornix, amygdala, and entorhinal cortex of 3 × Tg-AD mice following forniceal 
DBS.Significance.The efficacy of forniceal DBS in AD can be indicated by 
alterations in DTI-based biomarkers reflecting the decreased activation of glial 
cells, suggesting reduced neural inflammation as evidenced by improvements in 
memory and anxiety-like behavior.

INTRODUCTION: Dementia often involves comorbid Alzheimer's and vascular 
pathology, but their combined impact warrants additional study.
METHODS: We analyzed the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial and 
categorized white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume into highest versus 
lowest/mid tertile and the amyloid beta (Aβ)42/40 ratio into lowest versus 
mid/highest ratio tertile. Using these binary variables, we created four 
exposure categories: (1) combined low risk, (2) Aβ risk, (3) WMH risk, and (4) 
combined high risk.
RESULTS: In the cohort of 467 participants (mean age 69.7 ± 7.1, 41.8% female, 
31.9% nonwhite or Hispanic) during 4.8 years of follow-up and across the four 
exposure categories the rates of cognitive impairment were 5.3%, 7.8%, 11.8%, 
and 22.6%. Compared to the combined low-risk category, the adjusted hazard ratio 
for cognitive impairment was 4.12 (95% confidence interval, 1.71 to 9.94) in the 
combined high-risk category.
DISCUSSION: This study emphasizes the potential impact of therapeutic approaches 
to dementia prevention that target both vascular and amyloid pathology.
HIGHLIGHTS: White matter hyperintensity (WMH) and plasma amyloid (Aβ42/40) are 
additive risk factors for the development of cognitive impairment in the SPRINT 
MIND trial. Individuals in the high-risk categories of both WMH and Aβ42/40 had 
a near fivefold increase in risk of cognitive impairment during 4.8 years of 
follow-up on average. These findings suggest that treatment strategies targeting 
both vascular health and amyloid burden warrant further research.

OBJECTIVES: Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation represents a promising 
approach for treating Alzheimer's disease (AD). These stem cells, however, have 
a short lifespan following transplantation into recipient animals. Selenium 
nanoparticles, due to their size, aid in drug delivery for brain disorders. This 
study investigated the therapeutic effect of MSCs and polyvinyl alcohol 
(PVA)-coated selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) in a rat model of AD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: An Alzheimer-like phenotype was induced through 
intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of streptozotocin (STZ). Rats were 
assigned to five groups: control, Alz (STZ; 3 mg/kg, 10 μl, ICV), Alz+stem cell 
(ICV transplantation), Alz+SeNP (0.4 mg/kg, orally), and Alz+stem cell+SeNPs. 
The ICV administration of STZ mimicked some aspects of AD in the Alz groups. 
SeNPs were administrated for 30 days following STZ administration. The novel 
object recognition (NOR) and passive avoidance learning (PAL) tests were used to 
evaluate cognition and memory. Oxidative stress biomarkers and brain-derived 
neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were assessed by biochemical analysis, ELISA kits, 
and Congo red staining, respectively.
RESULTS: The combined therapy of PVA-coated SeNPs and MSC transplantation was 
more effective in enhancing memory reacquisition compared to either SeNPs or 
MSCs alone. The use of stem cells in conjunction with PVA-coated SeNPs 
significantly boosted anti-oxidant capacity.
CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the joint treatment with PVA-coated SeNPs 
and MSCs offers considerable neuroprotection against AD in animal models.

Memory loss is becoming an increasingly significant health problem, largely due 
to Alzheimer's disease (AD), which disrupts the brain in several ways, including 
causing inflammation and weakening the body's defenses. This study explores the 
potential of medicinal plants as a source of novel therapeutic agents for AD. 
First, we tested various plant extracts against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in 
vitro, following molecular docking simulations with key AD-related protein 
targets such as MAO-B, P-gp, GSK-3β, and CD14. Rosemary extract was found to be 
the most inhibitory towards AChE. The compounds found in rosemary (oleanolic 
acid), sage (pinocembrin), and cinnamon (italicene) showed promise in 
potentially binding to MAO-B. These chemicals may interact with a key protein in 
the brain and alter the production and removal of amyloid-β. Luteolin (from 
rosemary), myricetin (from sage), chamigrene, and italicene (from cinnamon) 
exhibited potential for inhibiting tau aggregation. Additionally, ursolic acid 
found in rosemary, sage, and chamigrene from cinnamon could modulate CD14 
activity. For the first time, our findings shed light on the intricate interplay 
between neuroinflammation, neuroprotective mechanisms, and the immune system's 
role in AD. Further research is needed to validate the in vivo efficacy and 
safety of these plant-derived compounds, as well as their interactions with key 
protein targets, which could lead to the development of novel AD therapeutics.

Identifying early and non-invasive biomarkers to detect individuals in the 
earliest stages of the Alzheimer's disease continuum is crucial. As a result, 
electrophysiology and plasma biomarkers are emerging as great candidates in this 
pursuit due to their low invasiveness. This is the first magnetoencephalography 
study to assess the relationship between minimum spanning tree parameters, an 
alternative to overcome the comparability and thresholding problem issues 
characteristic of conventional brain network analyses, and plasma phosphorylated 
tau231 levels in unimpaired individuals, with different risk levels of 
Alzheimer's disease. Seventy-six individuals with available 
magnetoencephalography recordings and phosphorylated tau231 plasma determination 
were included. The minimum spanning tree for the theta, alpha and beta bands for 
each subject was obtained, and the leaf fraction, tree hierarchy and diameter 
were calculated. To study the relationship between these topological parameters 
and phosphorylated tau231, we performed correlation analyses, for the whole 
sample and considering the two risk sub-groups separately. Increasing 
concentrations of phosphorylated tau231 were associated with greater leaf 
fraction and tree hierarchy values, along with lower diameter values, for the 
alpha and theta frequency bands. These results emerged for the whole sample and 
the higher risk group, but not for the lower risk group. Our results indicate 
that the network topology of cognitively unimpaired individuals with elevated 
plasma phosphorylated tau231 levels, a marker of Alzheimer's disease pathology 
and amyloid-β accumulation, is already altered, shifting towards a more 
integrated network increasing its vulnerability and hub-dependency, mostly in 
the alpha band. This is indicated by increases in leaf fraction and tree 
hierarchy, along with reductions in diameter. These results match the initial 
trajectory proposed by theoretical models of disease progression and network 
disruption and suggest that changes in brain function and organization begin 
early on.

BACKGROUND: Approximately 6.9 million American individuals have Alzheimer 
dementia and 50% have mild disease. Lecanemab, an approved antiamyloid antibody, 
is associated with modest reduction in functional decline in patients with mild 
dementia or mild cognitive impairment. In Clarity-AD, 239 (26.6%) of patients 
experienced amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIAs) overall (i.e., ARIAs 
associated with hemorrhages or edema). The complexity of treatment and risks of 
adverse events necessitate a multidisciplinary collaborative approach.
RECENT FINDINGS: With limited treatment options, lecanemab approval generated 
significant interest among clinicians, patients, and families. Lecanemab 
treatment requires biweekly infusions along with ongoing imaging tests, 
laboratory monitoring, patient assessment, drug interaction screening, and 
cognitive function monitoring. Processes to support patient selection, access, 
and safety are important given the monitoring requirements and total cost of 
care.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The planning process for lecanemab can serve as a 
blueprint to support safe and effective management of therapeutic innovation in 
neurology and other areas.

BACKGROUND: High interleukin-6 levels correlate with diseases like cancer, 
autoimmune disorders, and infections. IL-6 receptor inhibitors (IL-6Ri), used 
for rheumatoid arthritis and COVID-19, may have wider uses. We apply drug-target 
Mendelian Randomization (MR) to study IL-6Ri's effects.
METHOD: To simulate the effects of genetically blocking the IL-6R, we selected 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within or near the IL6R gene that show 
significant genome-wide associations with C-reactive protein. Using rheumatoid 
arthritis and COVID-19 as positive controls, our primary research outcomes 
included the risk of asthma, asthmatic pneumonia, cor pulmonale, non-small cell 
lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, 
ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, type 1 
diabetes, and type 2 diabetes. The Inverse Variance Weighted (IVW) method served 
as our principal analytical approach, with the hypotheses of MR being evaluated 
through sensitivity and colocalization analyses. Additionally, we conducted 
Bayesian Mendelian Randomization analyses to minimize confounding and reverse 
causation biases to the greatest extent possible.
RESULTS: IL-6 inhibitors significantly reduced the risk of idiopathic pulmonary 
fibrosis (OR= 0.278, 95% [CI], 0.138-0.558; P <0.001), Parkinson's disease (OR = 
0.354, 95% CI, 0.215-0.582; P <0.001), and positively influenced the causal 
relationship with Type 2 diabetes (OR = 0.759, 95% CI, 0.637-0.905; P = 0.002). 
However, these inhibitors increased the risk for asthma (OR = 1.327, 95% CI, 
1.118-1.576; P = 0.001) and asthmatic pneumonia (OR = 1.823, 95% CI, 
1.246-2.666; P = 0.002). The causal effect estimates obtained via the BWMR 
method are consistent with those based on the IVW approach. Similarly, sIL-6R 
also exerts a significant influence on these diseases.Diseases such as 
Alzheimer's disease, Crohn's disease, pulmonary heart disease, systemic lupus 
erythematosus, Type 1 diabetes, Non-small cell lung cancer and ulcerative 
colitis showed non-significant associations (p > 0.05) and were excluded from 
further analysis. Similarly, Small cell lung cancer were excluded due to 
inconsistent results. Notably, the colocalization evidence for asthmatic 
pneumonia (coloc.abf-PPH4 = 0.811) robustly supports its association with CRP. 
The colocalization evidence for Parkinson's disease (coloc.abf-PPH4 = 0.725) 
moderately supports its association with CRP.
CONCLUSION: IL-6Ri may represent a promising therapeutic avenue for idiopathic 
pulmonary fibrosis, Parkinson's disease, and Type 2 diabetes.

Loss of Insulin Signaling in Microglia Impairs Cellular Uptake of Aβ and 
Neuroinflammatory Response Exacerbating Alzheimer-like Neuropathology.

Insulin receptors are present on cells throughout the body, including the brain. 
Dysregulation of insulin signaling in neurons and astrocytes has been implicated 
in altered mood, cognition, and the pathogenesis of Alzheimers disease (AD). To 
define the role of insulin signaling in microglia, the primary phagocytes in 
brain critical for maintenance and damage repair, we created mice with an 
inducible microglia-specific insulin receptor knockout (MG-IRKO). RiboTag 
profiling of microglial mRNAs revealed that loss of insulin signaling results in 
alterations of gene expression in pathways related to innate immunity and 
cellular metabolism. In vitro, loss of insulin signaling in microglia results in 
metabolic reprograming with an increase in glycolysis and impaired uptake of Aβ. 
In vivo, MG-IRKO mice exhibit alterations in mood and social behavior, and when 
crossed with the 5xFAD mouse model of AD, the resultant mice exhibit increased 
levels of Aβ; plaque and elevated neuroinflammation. Thus, insulin signaling in 
microglia plays a key role in microglial cellular metabolism, neuroinflammation 
and the ability of the cells to take up Aβ; such that reduced insulin signaling 
in microglia alters mood and social behavior and accelerates AD pathogenesis. 
Together these data indicate key roles of insulin action in microglia and the 
potential of targeting insulin signaling in microglia in treatment of AD.

INTRODUCTION: Disturbances in microvascular flow dynamics are hypothesized to 
precede the symptomatic phase of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, evidence in 
presymptomatic AD remains elusive, underscoring the need for therapies targeting 
these early vascular changes.
METHODS: We employed a multimodal approach, combining in vivo optical imaging, 
molecular techniques, and ex vivo MRI, to investigate early capillary 
dysfunction in Tg-SwDI mice without memory impairment. We also assessed the 
efficacy of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAIs) in preventing capillary flow 
disturbances.
RESULTS: Our study revealed capillary flow disturbances associated with 
alterations in capillary morphology, adhesion molecule expression, and Amyloid-β 
(Aβ) load in 9-10-month-old Tg-SwDI mice without memory impairment. CAI 
treatment ameliorated these capillary flow disturbances, enhanced oxygen 
availability, and reduced Aβ load.
DISCUSSION: These findings underscore the importance of capillary flow 
disturbances as early biomarkers in presymptomatic AD and highlight the 
potential of CAIs for preserving vascular integrity in the early stages of AD.

Neurodegenerative disorders alter mitochondrial functions, including the 
production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Mitochondrial complex III (CIII) 
generates ROS implicated in redox signaling, but its triggers, targets, and 
disease relevance are not clear. Using site-selective suppressors and genetic 
manipulations together with mitochondrial ROS imaging and multiomic profiling, 
we found that CIII is the dominant source of ROS production in astrocytes 
exposed to neuropathology-related stimuli. Astrocytic CIII-ROS production was 
dependent on nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and the mitochondrial sodium-calcium 
exchanger (NCLX) and caused oxidation of select cysteines within immune and 
metabolism-associated proteins linked to neurological disease. CIII-ROS 
amplified metabolomic and pathology-associated transcriptional changes in 
astrocytes, with STAT3 activity as a major mediator, and facilitated neuronal 
toxicity in a non-cell-autonomous manner. As proof-of-concept, suppression of 
CIII-ROS in mice decreased dementia-linked tauopathy and neuroimmune cascades 
and extended lifespan. Our findings establish CIII-ROS as an important 
immunometabolic signal transducer and tractable therapeutic target in 
neurodegenerative disease.

Update in
    Alzheimers Dement. 2025 Feb;21(2):e14508. doi: 10.1002/alz.14508.

BACKGROUND: Phosphorylated tau (p-tau) is a specific blood biomarker for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Multiple p-tau biomarkers on several 
analytical platforms are poised for clinical use. The Alzheimer's Association 
Global Biomarker Standardisation Consortium plasma phospho-tau Round Robin study 
engaged assay developers in a blinded case-control study on plasma p-tau, aiming 
to learn which assays provide the largest fold-changes in AD compared to non-AD, 
have the strongest relationship between plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), 
and show the most consistent relationships between methods (commutability) in 
measuring both patient samples and candidate reference materials (CRM).
METHODS: Thirty-three different p-tau biomarker assays, built on eight different 
analytical platforms, were used to quantify paired plasma and CSF samples from 
40 participants. AD biomarker status was categorised as "AD pathology" (n=25) 
and "non-AD pathology" (n=15) by CSF Aβ42/Aβ40 (US-FDA; CE-IVDR) and p-tau181 
(CE-IVDR) methods. The commutability of four CRM, at three concentrations, was 
assessed across assays.
FINDINGS: Plasma p-tau217 consistently demonstrated higher fold-changes between 
AD and non-AD pathology groups, compared to other p-tau epitopes. Fujirebio 
LUMIPULSE G, UGOT IPMS, and Lilly MSD p-tau217 assays provided the highest 
median fold-changes. In CSF, p-tau217 assays also performed best, and exhibited 
substantially larger fold-changes than their plasma counterparts, despite 
similar diagnostic performance. P-tau217 showed the strongest correlations 
between plasma assays (rho=0.81 to 0.97). Plasma p-tau levels were 
weakly-to-moderately correlated with CSF p-tau, and correlations were 
non-significant within the AD group alone. The evaluated CRM were not commutable 
across assays.
INTERPRETATION: Plasma p-tau217 measures had larger fold-changes and 
discriminative accuracies for detecting AD pathology, and better agreement 
across platforms than other plasma p-tau variants. Plasma and CSF markers of 
p-tau, measured by immunoassays, are not substantially correlated, questioning 
the interchangeability of their continuous relationship. Further work is 
warranted to understand the pathophysiology underlying this dissociation, and to 
develop suitable reference materials facilitating cross-assay standardisation.

Cognitive resilience describes the phenomenon of individuals evading cognitive 
decline despite prominent Alzheimer's disease neuropathology. Operationalization 
and measurement of this latent construct is non-trivial as it cannot be directly 
observed. The residual approach has been widely applied to estimate CR, where 
the degree of resilience is estimated through a linear model's residuals. We 
demonstrate that this approach makes specific, uncontrollable assumptions and 
likely leads to biased and erroneous resilience estimates. We propose an 
alternative strategy which overcomes the standard approach's limitations using 
machine learning principles. Our proposed approach makes fewer assumptions about 
the data and construct to be measured and achieves better estimation accuracy on 
simulated ground-truth data.

The medial temporal lobe (MTL) is a hotspot for neuropathology, and measurements 
of MTL atrophy are often used as a biomarker for cognitive decline associated 
with neurodegenerative disease. Due to the aggregation of multiple 
proteinopathies in this region, the specific relationship of MTL atrophy to 
distinct neuropathologies is not well understood. Here, we develop two 
quantitative algorithms using deep learning to measure phosphorylated tau 
(p-tau) and TDP-43 (pTDP-43) pathology, which are both known to accumulate in 
the MTL and are associated with MTL neurodegeneration. We focus on these 
pathologies in the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and limbic predominant 
age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE) and apply our deep learning algorithms 
to distinct histology sections, on which MTL subregions were digitally 
annotated. We demonstrate that both quantitative pathology measures show high 
agreement with expert visual ratings of pathology and discriminate well between 
pathology stages. In 140 cases with antemortem MR imaging, we compare the 
association of semi-quantitative and quantitative postmortem measures of these 
pathologies in the hippocampus with in vivo structural measures of the MTL and 
its subregions. We find widespread associations of p-tau pathology with MTL 
subregional structural measures, whereas pTDP-43 pathology had more limited 
associations with the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. Quantitative 
measurements of p-tau pathology resulted in a significantly better model of 
antemortem structural measures than semi-quantitative ratings and showed strong 
associations with cortical thickness and volume. By providing a more granular 
measure of pathology, the quantitative p-tau measures also showed a significant 
negative association with structure in a severe AD subgroup where 
semi-quantitative ratings displayed a ceiling effect. Our findings demonstrate 
the advantages of using quantitative neuropathology to understand the 
relationship of pathology to structure, particularly for p-tau, and motivate the 
use of quantitative pathology measurements in future studies.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The prevalence of Alzheimer's dementia (AD) is 
increasing as populations age, causing immense suffering for patients, families, 
and communities. Unfortunately, no treatments for this neurodegenerative disease 
have been established. Predicting AD is therefore becoming more important, 
because early diagnosis is the best way to prevent its onset and delay its 
progression.
METHODS: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is the stage between normal cognition 
and AD, with large variations in its progression. The disease can be effectively 
managed by accurately predicting the probability of MCI progressing to AD over 
several years. In this study we used the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative dataset to predict the progression of MCI to AD over a 3-year period 
from baseline. We developed and compared various recurrent neural network (RNN) 
models to determine the predictive effectiveness of four neuropsychological (NP) 
tests and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data at baseline.
RESULTS: The experimental results confirmed that the Preclinical Alzheimer's 
Cognitive Composite score was the most effective of the four NP tests, and that 
the prediction performance of the NP tests improved over time. Moreover, the 
gated recurrent unit model exhibited the best performance among the prediction 
models, with an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
of 0.916.
CONCLUSIONS: Timely prediction of progression from MCI to AD can be achieved 
using a series of NP test results and an RNN, both with and without using the 
baseline MRI data.

BACKGROUND: Dementia poses a significant global health challenge. Anthocyanins 
neutralize free radicals, modulate signaling pathways, inhibit pro-inflammatory 
genes, and suppress cytokine production and may thus have positive cognitive 
effects in people at increased risk of dementia. We aim to investigate the 
effects of purified anthocyanins on cognitive function in people at increased 
risk of dementia according to their inflammation status based on blood-based 
inflammatory biomarkers.
METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a 24-week randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled trial. Cluster analysis was performed to categorize two 
groups based on their individual inflammatory biomarker profile using multiplex 
sandwich ELISA for the quantitative measurement of cytokines. Descriptive 
statistics and longitudinal models assessed cognitive outcomes. The primary 
comparison was the group difference at week 24 based on a modified 
intention-to-treat analysis.
RESULTS: Cluster analysis revealed two distinct inflammatory biomarker profiles. 
In Cluster 1 (high levels of inflammation biomarkers), anthocyanin treatment 
showed a statistically significant improvement on cognitive function compared to 
placebo at 24 weeks. No significant differences were observed in Cluster 2 (low 
levels of inflammation biomarkers). The demographic characteristics, cognitive 
scores, and biomarker distributions were similar between treatment groups at 
baseline. However, cluster 1 exhibited higher BMI, diabetes prevalence, 
medication usage, and lower HDL cholesterol levels.
CONCLUSION: Individuals with elevated levels of inflammation markers benefited 
from anthocyanin treatment to enhance cognitive performance, whereas those with 
lower levels did not. The anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of 
anthocyanins make them a promising intervention, and future prospective trials 
in people with increased inflammation are warranted.

OBJECTIVE: Major lower limb amputation is a disfiguring operation associated 
with impaired mobility and high near-term mortality. Informed decision-making 
regarding amputation requires outcomes data. Despite the co-occurrence of both 
chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) and Alzheimer's disease and related 
dementias (ADRD), there is sparse data on the outcomes of major limb amputation 
in this population and the impact of frailty. We sought to determine mortality, 
complications, readmissions, revisions, intensive interventions (eg, 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation), and other outcomes after amputation for CLTI in 
patients living with ADRD looking at the modifying effects of frailty.
METHODS: We examined Medicare fee-for-service claims data from January 1, 2016, 
to December 31, 2020. Patients with CLTI undergoing amputation at or proximal to 
the ankle were included. Along with demographic information, dementia status, 
and comorbid conditions, we measured frailty using a claims-based frailty index. 
We dichotomized dementia and frailty (pre-frail/robust = "non-frail" vs 
moderate/severe frailty = "frail") to create four groups: non-frail/non-ADRD, 
frail/non-ADRD, non-frail/ADRD, and frail/ADRD. We used linear and logistic 
regression via generalized estimating equations in addition to performing 
selected outcomes analyses with death as a competing risk to understand the 
association between dementia status, frailty status, and 1-year mortality as our 
primary outcome in addition to the postoperative outcomes outlined above.
RESULTS: Among 46,930 patients undergoing major limb amputation, 11,465 (24.4%) 
had ADRD and 24,790 (52.8%) had frailty. Overall, 55.9% of amputations were 
below-knee. Selected outcomes among frail/ADRD patients undergoing amputation 
(n = 10,153) were: 55.3% 1-year mortality 29.6% readmissions at 30 days, and 
32.3% amputation revision/reoperation within 1 year. Of all four groups, those 
in the frail/ADRD had the worst outcomes only for 1-year mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: First, patients with ADRD or moderate/severe frailty suffer an 
array of very poor outcomes after major limb amputation for CLTI, including high 
mortality, readmissions, revision, and risks of discharge to higher levels of 
care. Second, there is a complex relationship between outcome severity and 
ADRD/frailty status. Specifically, frailty is more often than ADRD associated 
with the poorest results for any given outcome. These data provide important 
outcomes data to help align decision-making with health care values and goals.

Alzheimer's disease (AD, also known as dementia) has become a serious global 
health problem along with population aging, and neuroinflammation is the 
underlying cause of cognitive impairment in the brain. Nowadays, the development 
of multitarget anti-AD drugs is considered to be one effective approach. 
Imidazolylacetophenone oxime ethers or esters (IOEs) were multifunctional agents 
with neuroinflammation inhibition, metal chelation, antioxidant and 
neuroprotection properties against Alzheimer's disease. In this study, IOEs 
derivatives 1-8 were obtained by structural modifications of the oxime and 
imidazole groups, and the SARs showed that (Z)-oxime ether (derivative 2) had 
stronger anti-neuroinflammatory and neuroprotective ability than (E)-congener. 
Then, IOEs derivatives 9-30 were synthesized based on target-directed ligands 
and activity-based groups hybridization strategy. In vitro anti-AD activity 
screening revealed that some derivatives exhibited potentially multifunctional 
effects, among which derivative 28 exhibited the strongest inhibitory activity 
on NO production with EC50 value of 0.49 μM, and had neuroprotective effects on 
6-OHDA-induced cell damage and RSL3-induced ferroptosis. The 
anti-neuroinflammatory mechanism showed that 28 could inhibit the release of 
pro-inflammatory factors PGE2 and TNF-α, down-regulate the expression of iNOS 
and COX-2 proteins, and promote the polarization of BV-2 cells from 
pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype to anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype. In addition, 28 
can dose-dependently inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and Aβ42 aggregation. 
Moreover, the selected nuclide [18F]-labeled 28 was synthesized to explore its 
biodistribution by micro-PET/CT, of which 28 can penetrate the blood-brain 
barrier (BBB). These results shed light on the potential of 28 as a new 
multifunctional candidate for AD treatment.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Data on care home admission and survival rates of 
patients with syndromes associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) 
are limited. However, their estimation is essential to plan trials and assess 
the efficacy of intervention. Population-based registers provide unique samples 
for this estimate. The aim of this study was to assess care home admission rate, 
survival rate, and their predictors in incident patients with FTLD-associated 
syndromes from the European FRONTIERS register-based study.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective longitudinal multinational observational 
registry study, considering incident patients with FTLD-associated syndromes 
diagnosed between June 1, 2018, and May 31, 2019, and followed for up to 5 years 
till May 31, 2023. We enrolled patients fulfilling diagnosis of the behavioral 
variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), primary progressive aphasia (PPA), 
progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) or corticobasal syndrome (CBS), and FTD 
with motor neuron disease (FTD-MND). Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox multivariable 
regression models were used to assess care home admission and survival rates. 
The survival probability score (SPS) was computed based on independent 
predictors of survivorship.
RESULTS: A total of 266 incident patients with FTLD were included (mean age ± SD 
= 66.7 ± 9.0; female = 41.4%). The median care home admission rate was 97 months 
(95% CIs 86-98) from disease onset and 57 months (95% CIs 56-58) from diagnosis. 
The median survival was 90 months (95% CIs 77-97) from disease onset and 49 
months (95% CIs 44-58) from diagnosis. Survival from diagnosis was shorter in 
FTD-MND (hazard ratio [HR] 4.59, 95% CIs 2.49-8.76, p < 0.001) and PSP/CBS (HR 
1.56, 95% CIs 1.01-2.42, p = 0.044) compared with bvFTD; no differences between 
PPA and bvFTD were found. The SPS proved high accuracy in predicting 1-year 
survival probability (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 
0.789, 95% CIs 0.69-0.87), when defined by age, European area of residency, 
extrapyramidal symptoms, and MND at diagnosis.
DISCUSSION: In FTLD-associated syndromes, survival rates differ according to 
clinical features and geography. The SPS was able to predict prognosis at 
individual patient level with an accuracy of ∼80% and may help to improve 
patient stratification in clinical trials. Future confirmatory studies 
considering different populations are needed.

Epidemiological studies have revealed an inverse relationship between the 
incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and various cancers, including colorectal 
cancer (CRC). We aimed to determine whether the incidence of CRC is reduced in 
AD-like mice and whether gut microbiota confers resistance to tumorigenesis 
through inducing inflammatory tolerance using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing 
and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). AD-like mice experienced a 
significantly decreased incidence of CRC tumorigenesis induced by 
azoxymethane-dextran sodium sulfate as evidenced by suppressed intestinal 
inflammation compared with control mice. However, FMT from age-matched control 
mice reversed the inhibitory effects on the tumorigenesis of CRC and 
inflammatory response in AD-like mice. The key bacterial genera in gut 
microbiota, including Prevotella, were increased in both the AD-like mice and in 
patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) but were decreased in 
patients with CRC. Pretreatment with low-dose Prevotella-derived 
lipopolysaccharides (LPS) induced inflammatory tolerance both in vivo and in 
vitro and inhibited CRC tumorigenesis in mice. Imbalanced gut microbiota 
increased intestinal barrier permeability, which facilitated LPS absorption from 
the gut into the blood, causing cognitive decline in AD-like mice and patients 
with aMCI. These data reveal that intestinal Prevotella-derived LPS exerts a 
resistant effect to CRC tumorigenesis via inducing inflammatory tolerance in the 
presence of AD. These findings provide biological evidence demonstrating the 
inverse relationship between the incidence of AD and CRC.

Truncating genetic variants of SORL1, encoding the endosome recycling receptor 
SORLA, have been accepted as causal of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, most 
genetic variants observed in SORL1 are missense variants, for which it is 
complicated to determine the pathogenicity level because carriers come from 
pedigrees too small to be informative for penetrance estimations. Here, we 
describe three unrelated families in which the SORL1 coding missense variant 
rs772677709, that leads to a p.Y1816C substitution, segregates with Alzheimer's 
disease. Further, we investigate the effect of SORLA p.Y1816C on receptor 
maturation, cellular localization, and trafficking in cell-based assays. Under 
physiological circumstances, SORLA dimerizes within the endosome, allowing 
retromer-dependent trafficking from the endosome to the cell surface, where the 
luminal part is shed into the extracellular space (sSORLA). Our results showed 
that the p.Y1816C mutant impairs SORLA homodimerization in the endosome, leading 
to decreased trafficking to the cell surface and less sSORLA shedding. These 
trafficking defects of the mutant receptor can be rescued by the expression of 
the SORLA 3Fn-minireceptor. Finally, we find that iPSC-derived neurons with the 
engineered p.Y1816C mutation have enlarged endosomes, a defining cytopathology 
of AD. Our studies provide genetic as well as functional evidence that the SORL1 
p.Y1816C variant is causal for AD. The partial penetrance of the mutation 
suggests this mutation should be considered in clinical genetic screening of 
multiplex early-onset AD families.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease and is 
characterized by progressive cognitive decline. Pathologically, this disease is 
associated with the accumulation of extracellular amyloid plaques, intracellular 
neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), and neuroinflammation. Current drug treatments 
primarily focus on managing symptoms rather than stopping disease progression. 
Disease-modifying therapies target the clearance of amyloid plaques through 
active and passive immunity methods. Although successful in animal models, human 
trials have shown adverse effects, such as meningoencephalitis, in a small 
number of patients who received active immunity methods. The efficacy of active 
immunity methods in treating AD remains uncertain, but passive immunity methods 
amyloid-beta (Abeta)-specific monoclonal antibody therapies such as aducanumab 
and lecanemab have been approved by the FDA. Despite the limitations of 
immune-based therapies, T-cell, and chimeric antigen receptor-based treatments 
show promise, but new guidelines are necessary to address potential adverse 
events. Research into the relationship between adaptive immune responses and AD 
is expected to provide innovative treatment approaches.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most prevalent, costly, and fatal 
neurodegenerative disorder of this century. Two hallmark features of AD are the 
anomalous cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), which leads to the 
accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ), and the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein. 
Despite extensive research efforts, the pathology and pathogenesis of AD remain 
elusive. Recent investigations have highlighted the close association between 
antisense long non-coding RNAs (AS-lncRNAs) and various biological and 
functional aspects of AD. However, many AS-lncRNAs implicated in AD have not yet 
been comprehensively compiled and discussed. This paper reviews the role of 
AS-lncRNAs in neurodegenerative diseases, outlines their association with AD, 
and offers novel insights into the potential applications of antisense RNAs in 
the diagnosis and treatment of AD.

It has been recognized that oxidative stress (OS) is implicated in the etiology 
of recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL), yet the biomarkers reflecting oxidative 
stress in association with RPL remain scarce. The dataset GSE165004 was 
retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. From the GeneCards 
database, a compendium of 789 genes related to oxidative stress-related genes 
(OSRGs) was compiled. By intersecting differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in 
normal and RPL samples with OSRGs, differentially expressed OSRGs (DE-OSRGs) 
were identified. In addition, four machine learning algorithms were employed for 
the selection of diagnostic markers for RPL. The Receiver Operating 
Characteristic (ROC) curves for these genes were generated and a predictive 
nomogram for the diagnostic markers was established. The functions and pathways 
associated with the diagnostic markers were elucidated, and the correlations 
between immune cells and diagnostic markers were examined. Potential 
therapeutics targeting the diagnostic markers were proposed based on data from 
the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database and ClinicalTrials.gov. The candidate 
biomarker genes from the four models were further validated in RPL tissue 
samples using RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. A set of 20 DE-OSRGs was 
identified, with 4 genes (KRAS, C2orf69, CYP17A1, and UCP3) being recognized by 
machine learning algorithms as diagnostic markers exhibiting robust diagnostic 
capabilities. The nomogram constructed demonstrated favorable predictive 
accuracy. Pathways including ribosome, peroxisome, Parkinson's disease, 
oxidative phosphorylation, Huntington's disease, and Alzheimer's disease were 
co-enriched by KRAS, C2orf69, and CYP17A1. Cell chemotaxis terms were commonly 
enriched by all four diagnostic markers. Significant differences in the 
abundance of five cell types, namely eosinophils, monocytes, natural killer 
cells, regulatory T cells, and T follicular helper cells, were observed between 
normal and RPL samples. A total of 180 drugs were predicted to target the 
diagnostic markers, including C544151, D014635, and CYP17A1. In the validation 
cohort of RPL patients, the LASSO model demonstrated superiority over other 
models. The expression levels of KRAS, C2orf69, and CYP17A1 were significantly 
reduced in RPL, while UCP3 levels were elevated, indicating their suitability as 
molecular markers for RPL. Four oxidative stress-related diagnostic markers 
(KRAS, C2orf69, CYP17A1, and UCP3) have been proposed to diagnose and 
potentially treat RPL.

Exosomes, extracellular vesicles secreted by various cells, actively participate 
in intercellular communication by facilitating the exchange of crucial molecular 
information such as DNA, RNA, and lipids. Within this intricate network, 
microRNAs, endogenous non-coding small RNAs, emerge as pivotal regulators of 
post-transcriptional gene expression, significantly influencing the development 
of neurodegenerative diseases. The historical prominence of traditional Chinese 
medicine (TCM) in clinical practice in China underscores its enduring 
significance. Notably, TCM monomers, serving as active constituents within 
herbal medicine, assume a critical role in the treatment of neurodegenerative 
diseases, particularly in mitigating oxidative stress, inhibiting apoptosis, and 
reducing inflammation. This comprehensive review aims to delineate the specific 
involvement of exosomal microRNAs in various neurodegenerative diseases, 
including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, 
stroke, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Furthermore, the exploration extends 
to the application of TCM monomers, elucidating their efficacy as therapeutic 
agents in these conditions. Additionally, the review examines the utilization of 
exosomes as drug delivery carriers in the context of neurodegenerative diseases, 
providing a nuanced understanding of the potential synergies between TCM and 
modern therapeutic approaches. This synthesis of knowledge aims to contribute to 
the advancement of our comprehension of the intricate molecular mechanisms 
underlying neurodegeneration and the potential therapeutic avenues offered by 
TCcom interventions.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by 
complex pathogenesis mechanisms. Among these, β-amyloid plaques and 
hyperphosphorylated Tau protein tangles have been identified as significant 
contributors to neuronal damage. This study investigates thonningianin A (TA) 
from Penthorum chinense Pursh (PCP) as a potential inhibitor targeting these 
pivotal proteins in AD progression. The inhibitory potential of PCP and TA on Aβ 
fibrillization was initially investigated. Subsequently, ultra-high performance 
liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry and 
biolayer interferometry were employed to determine TA's affinity for both Aβ and 
Tau. The inhibitory effects of TA on the levels and cytotoxicity of AD-related 
proteins were then assessed. In 3xTg-AD mice, the therapeutic potential of TA 
was evaluated. Additionally, the molecular interactions between TA and either Aβ 
or Tau were explored using molecular docking. We found that PCP-total ethanol 
extract and TA significantly inhibited Aβ fibrillization. Additionally, TA 
demonstrated strong affinity to Aβ and Tau, reduced levels of amyloid precursor 
protein and Tau, and alleviated mitochondrial distress in PC-12 cells. In 
3xTg-AD mice, TA improved cognition, reduced Aβ and Tau pathology, and 
strengthened neurons. Moreover, molecular analyses revealed efficient binding of 
TA to Aβ and Tau. In conclusion, TA, derived from PCP, shows significant 
neuroprotection against AD proteins, highlighting its potential as an anti-AD 
drug candidate.

OBJECTIVES: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease 
characterized by cognitive impairment. This situation imposes a great burden on 
individuals, both economically and socially. Today, an effective method for 
treating the disease and protective approach to tau accumulation has not been 
developed yet. Studies have been conducted on the effects of hesperidin and 
naringin flavonoids found in citrus fruits on many diseases.
METHODS: In this review, the pathophysiology of AD is defined, and the effects 
of hesperidin and naringin on these factors are summarized.
RESULTS: Studies have shown that both components may potentially affect AD due 
to their antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. Based on these effects 
of the components, it has been shown that they may have ameliorative effects on 
Aβ, α-synuclein aggregation, tau pathology, and cognitive functions in the 
pathophysiology of AD.
DISCUSSION: There are studies suggesting that hesperidin and naringin may be 
effective in the prevention/treatment of AD. When these studies are examined, it 
is seen that more studies should be conducted on the subject.

AIM: To investigate the experiences of people with Parkinson's disease in coping 
with and adapting to their disease and to identify considerations for a tailored 
self-management support program.
DESIGN: A descriptive phenomenological focus group study.
METHODS: Five semi-structured focus groups were conducted between April 2023 and 
June 2023 in the Netherlands, with 12 people with Parkinson's disease. Two 
researchers independently performed an inductive content analysis.
RESULTS: Three principal categories emerged: (1) Rational realisation versus 
emotional experience: the coping strategy transition. This category includes 
three main coping strategies: denial or avoidance coping, acknowledging with 
less active coping and proactive and task-oriented coping. (2) Factors that 
influence coping, including mindset and skills, social circles and communication 
and access to support and care. (3) Considerations for successful 
self-management of Parkinson's disease, highlighting key areas such as 
psycho-emotional guidance, nutrition and lifestyle, peer support and maintaining 
autonomy and sense of identity.
CONCLUSION: Coping and adaptation strategies are individual and dynamic 
processes, with multiple key or turning points during the transition between 
strategies. Tailored self-management support can enhance coping abilities during 
these transitions, fostering adaptation to a life with Parkinson's disease.
IMPLICATIONS FOR THE PROFESSION AND/OR PATIENT CARE: A patient-focused version 
of an existing blended self-management support program for family caregivers 
will be developed, which will be delivered by healthcare professionals.
IMPACT: This study can help healthcare professionals tailor support for people 
with Parkinson's disease, emphasising their role in facilitating coping and 
adaptation. Enhancing self-management can improve self-efficacy, quality of life 
and potentially reduce healthcare utilisation in people with Parkinson's 
disease.
REPORTING METHOD: Findings are reported according to the COREQ guidelines.
PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: Patients and Parkinson's disease experts 
participated in the preparation and implications of the findings. All 
participants could contribute to the self-management support program, either 
through video interviews or content feedback.

As a medicinal and edible homologous Chinese herb, Polygonatum sibiricum has 
been used as a primary ingredient in various functional and medicinal products. 
Damage to the intestinal mucosal barrier can lead to or worsen conditions such 
as type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's disease. Traditional Chinese medicine and its 
bioactive components can help prevent and manage these conditions by restoring 
the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier. This review delves into the 
mode of action of P. sibiricum polysaccharide in disease prevention and 
management through the restoration of the intestinal barrier. Polysaccharide 
from P. sibiricum effectively treats conditions by repairing the intestinal 
mucosal barrier, offering insights for treating complex diseases and supporting 
the application of P. sibiricum in clinical settings.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the leading causes of dementia and is 
characterized by memory loss, mental and behavioral abnormalities, and impaired 
ability to perform daily activities. Even as a global disease that threatens 
human health, effective treatments to slow the progression of AD have not been 
found, despite intensive research and significant investment. In recent years, 
the role of infections in the etiology of AD has sparked intense debate. 
Pathogens invade the central nervous system through a damaged blood-brain 
barrier or nerve trunk and disrupt the neuronal structure and function as well 
as homeostasis of the brain microenvironment through a series of molecular 
biological events. In this review, we summarize the various pathogens involved 
in AD pathology, discuss potential interactions between pathogens and AD, and 
provide an overview of the promising future of anti-pathogenic therapies for AD.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) encompasses a spectrum that may progress 
from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to full dementia, characterized by 
amyloid-beta and tau accumulation. Transcranial direct current stimulation 
(tDCS) is being investigated as a therapeutic option, but its efficacy in 
relation to individual genetic and biological risk factors remains 
underexplored.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of a two-week anodal tDCS regimen on the left 
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, focusing on functional connectivity changes in 
neural networks in MCI patients resulting from various possible underlying 
disorders, considering individual factors associated to AD such as amyloid-beta 
deposition, APOE ϵ4 allele, BDNF Val66Met polymorphism, and sex.
METHODS: In a single-arm prospective study, 63 patients with MCI, including both 
amyloid-PET positive and negative cases, received 10 sessions of tDCS. We 
assessed intra- and inter-network functional connectivity (FC) using fMRI and 
analyzed interactions between tDCS effects and individual factors associated to 
AD.
RESULTS: tDCS significantly enhanced intra-network FC within the Salience 
Network (SN) and inter-network FC between the Central Executive Network and SN, 
predominantly in APOE ϵ4 carriers. We also observed significant sex*tDCS 
interactions that benefited inter-network FC among females. Furthermore, the 
effects of multiple modifiers, particularly the interaction of the BDNF Val66Met 
polymorphism and sex, were evident, as demonstrated by increased intra-network 
FC of the SN in female Met non-carriers. Lastly, the effects of tDCS on FC did 
not differ between the group of 26 MCI patients with cerebral amyloid-beta 
deposition detected by flutemetamol PET and the group of 37 MCI patients without 
cerebral amyloid-beta deposition.
CONCLUSIONS: The study highlights the importance of precision medicine in tDCS 
applications for MCI, suggesting that individual genetic and biological profiles 
significantly influence therapeutic outcomes. Tailoring interventions based on 
these profiles may optimize treatment efficacy in early stages of AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) presents a significant global health challenge, with 
its prevalence expected to rise sharply in the coming years. Despite extensive 
research, effective treatments addressing the multifaceted pathophysiology of AD 
remain elusive. This study investigates the therapeutic potential of 
twenty-seven prolinamides (P1 - P27), with the focus on their interactions with 
key proteins implicated in AD pathogenesis. Four of the compounds, namely; 
10-((4-nitrophenyl)prolyl)-10 H-phenothiazine (P14), 
2-((4-nitrophenyl)prolyl)isoindoline (P19), 
1-(4-formylphenyl)-N-(p-tolyl)pyrrolidine-2-carboxamide (P22), and 
N,1-bis(4-nitrophenyl)pyrrolidine-2-carboxamide (P27) showed promising potential 
as Alzheimer's drug. In-silico approaches including molecular docking, molecular 
dynamic (MD) simulation, post md study, physicochemical and drug-likeness 
parameters were employed to ascertain the potential of these compounds as 
inhibitors of certain proteins implicated in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's 
disease. Molecular docking and dynamics simulations demonstrated that P14, P19, 
P22 and P27 exhibited promising binding affinities towards crucial AD-associated 
proteins, including Beta-Secretase 1 (BACE1), Butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), and 
Tau-tubulin kinase 2 (TTBK2). Structural stability analyses revealed that 
prolinamides, particularly P22 and P27 for BACE1 and P14 and P19 for BuChE, 
exhibited greater stability than their reference ligands, indicated by lower 
RMSD, RoG, and RMSF values. For BuChE, Rivastigmine had a docking score of 
-7.0 kcal/mol, a binding free energy (ΔGbind) of -22.19 ± 2.44 kcal/mol, RMSD of 
1.361 ± 0.162 Å, RMSF of 9.357 ± 3.212 Å, and RoG of 22.919 ± 0.064 Å, whereas 
P19 exhibited a superior docking score of -10.3 kcal/mol, a significantly better 
ΔGbind of -33.74 ± 2.84 kcal/mol, RMSD of 1.347 ± 0.132 Å, RMSF of 8.164 ± 2.748 
Å, and RoG of 22.868 ± 0.070 Å. Physicochemical and pharmacokinetic assessments 
affirmed the drug-likeness and bioavailability of P19 notably capable of 
penetrating the blood-brain barrier. Compounds P19 and P22, emerged as 
multi-targeted ligands, offering the potential for simultaneous modulation of 
multiple AD-related pathways. These findings highlight the possibilities of 
these compounds to be explored as novel therapeutic agents for AD. They also 
highlight the need for further experimental validation to confirm their efficacy 
and safety profiles, advancing them toward clinical application in AD 
management.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
primarily affecting the elderly, characterized by severe cognitive impairment 
and memory loss. Emerging evidence suggests that neuroinflammation plays a 
significant role in AD pathogenesis, with cytokines like interleukin-6 (IL-6) 
and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 8 (CXCL8) contributing to the disease 
progression.
METHODS: We utilized Gene Expression Omnibus datasets to identify IL-6 and CXCL8 
as pivotal inflammatory markers in AD. In vitro experiments were conducted using 
SK-N-BE(2)-M17 and THP-1 cell lines treated with IL-6 and CXCL8 to model AD. 
Additionally, in vivo tests on Amyloid Precursor Protein/Presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) 
AD mouse models were performed to assess the impact of these cytokines on 
cognitive functions and brain pathology.
RESULTS: The results indicated a significant decrease in cell viability, 
increased apoptosis, and elevated inflammatory factor secretion following IL-6 
and CXCL8 treatment in vitro. In vivo, AD mouse models treated with these 
cytokines exhibited exacerbated emotional distress, decreased social 
interaction, impaired cognitive functions, and increased amyloid protein 
deposition in neural tissues.
CONCLUSIONS: The study highlights the detrimental effects of IL-6 and CXCL8 on 
neuronal health and cognitive functions in AD. These findings suggest that 
targeting these cytokines could offer potential therapeutic interventions for 
improving patient outcomes in Alzheimer disease.

Boosting slow-wave activity (SWA) by modulating slow waves through closed-loop 
auditory stimulation (CLAS) might provide a powerful non-pharmacological tool to 
investigate the link between sleep and neurodegeneration. Here, we established 
mouse CLAS (mCLAS)-mediated SWA enhancement and explored its effects on sleep 
deficits in neurodegeneration, by targeting the up-phase of slow waves in mouse 
models of Alzheimer's disease (AD, Tg2576) and Parkinson's disease (PD, M83). We 
found that tracking a 2 Hz component of slow waves leads to highest precision of 
non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep detection in mice, and that its combination 
with a 30° up-phase target produces a significant 15-30% SWA increase from 
baseline in wild-type (WTAD) and transgenic (TGAD) mice versus a mock 
stimulation group. Conversely, combining 2 Hz with a 40° phase target yields a 
significant increase ranging 30-35% in WTPD and TGPD mice. Interestingly, these 
phase-target-triggered SWA increases are not genotype dependent but strain 
specific. Sleep alterations that may contribute to disease progression and 
burden were described in AD and PD lines. Notably, pathological sleep traits 
were rescued by mCLAS, which elicited a 14% decrease of pathologically 
heightened NREM sleep fragmentation in TGAD mice, accompanied by a steep 
decrease in microarousal events during both light and dark periods. Overall, our 
results indicate that model-tailored phase targeting is key to modulate SWA 
through mCLAS, prompting the acute alleviation of key 
neurodegeneration-associated sleep phenotypes and potentiating sleep regulation 
and consolidation. Further experiments assessing the long-term effect of mCLAS 
in neurodegeneration may majorly impact the establishment of sleep-based 
therapies.

after Alzheimer's disease, primarily affecting the elderly population and 
significantly compromising their quality of life. The precise etiology of PD 
remains elusive, but recent research has shed light on potential factors, 
including the formation of α-synuclein aggregates, oxidative stress, 
neurotransmitter imbalances, and dopaminergic neurodegeneration in the 
substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) region of the brain, culminating in motor 
symptoms such as bradykinesia, akinesia, tremors, and rigidity. Monoamine 
oxidase (MAO) is an essential enzyme, comprising two isoforms, MAO-A and MAO-B, 
responsible for the oxidation of monoamines such as dopamine. Increased MAO-B 
activity is responsible for decreased dopamine levels in the SNpc region of mid 
brain which is remarkably associated with the pathogenesis of PD-like 
manifestations. Inhibitors of MAO-B enhance striatal neuronal responses to 
dopamine, making them valuable in treating PD, which involves dopamine 
deficiency. Clinically approved MAO-B inhibitors such as selegiline, L-deprenyl, 
pargyline, and rasagiline are employed in the management of neurodegenerative 
conditions associated with PD. Current therapeutic interventions including MAO-B 
inhibitors for PD predominantly aim to alleviate these motor symptoms but often 
come with a host of side effects that can be particularly challenging for the 
patients. While effective, they have limitations, prompting a search for 
alternative treatments, there is a growing interest in exploring natural 
products notably flavonoids as potential sources of novel MAO-B inhibitors. In 
line with that, the present review focuses on natural flavonoids of plant origin 
that hold promise as potential candidates for the development of novel MAO-B 
inhibitors. The discussion encompasses both in vitro and in vivo studies, 
shedding light on their potential therapeutic applications. Furthermore, this 
review underscores the significance of exploring natural products as valuable 
reservoirs of MAO-B inhibitors, offering new avenues for drug development and 
addressing the pressing need for improved treatments in PD-like pathological 
conditions. The authors of this review majorly explore the neuroprotective 
potential of natural flavonoids exhibiting notable MAO-B inhibitory activity and 
additionally multi-targeted approaches in the treatment of PD with clinical 
evidence and challenges faced in current therapeutic approaches.

We previously demonstrated that felodipine, an L-type calcium channel blocker, 
inhibits LPS-mediated neuroinflammatory responses in BV2 microglial cells and 
wild-type mice. However, the effects of felodipine on tau pathology, a hallmark 
of Alzheimer's disease (AD), have not been explored yet. Therefore, in the 
present study, we determined whether felodipine affects neuroinflammation and 
tau hyperphosphorylation in 3-month-old P301S transgenic mice (PS19), an early 
phase AD mice model for tauopathy. Felodipine administration decreased 
tauopathy-mediated microglial activation and NLRP3 expression in PS19 mice but 
had no effect on tauopathy-associated astrogliosis. In addition, felodipine 
treatment significantly reduced tau hyperphosphorylation at S202/Thr205 and 
Thr212/Ser214 residues via inhibiting JNK/P38 signaling in PS19 mice. 
Collectively, our results suggest that felodipine significantly ameliorates tau 
hyper-phosphorylation and tauopathy-associated neuroinflammatory responses in AD 
mice model for tauopathy and could be a novel therapeutic agent for AD.

BACKGROUND: The main objective of this study was to examine the burden of 
schizophrenia, depression, Alzheimer's disease/dementia, and stroke on 
caregivers and non-caregivers in Japan. This study also aimed to provide a 
comparative landscape on the burden of caregiving for each disorder.
METHODS: The Japan National Health and Wellness Survey database, 2016 and 2018 
was used in this study. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL), work 
productivity, and health care utilization were assessed using a 
self-administered, Internet-based questionnaire. The burden of caregiving 
experienced by each group of caregivers was compared with background-matched 
non-caregivers (controls) as well as with caregivers of patients with each 
disorder.
RESULTS: Caregivers of patients with schizophrenia, depression, Alzheimer's 
disease/dementia, or stroke had lower HRQoL, higher healthcare costs and work 
productivity impairment than non-caregivers. Furthermore, caregivers of patients 
with psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and depression had lower HRQoL 
and work productivity than caregivers of patients with Alzheimer's 
disease/dementia and stroke. In addition, according to the Caregiver Reaction 
Assessment (CRA), caregivers of patients with schizophrenia and depression were 
more inclined to perceive a loss in physical strength and financial burden to 
the same extent as their self-esteem.
CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated a substantial caregiving burden among 
caregivers of patients with psychiatric and neurological diseases in Japan. The 
caregiver burden of psychiatric disorders (schizophrenia and depression) was 
greater than that of neurological disorders (Alzheimer's disease/dementia and 
stroke), suggesting a need to provide support to caregivers of patients with 
psychiatric disorders to be better able to care for their patients.

BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, patients with Alzheimer's disease and 
related dementias (ADRD) were especially vulnerable, and modes of medical care 
delivery shifted rapidly. This study assessed the impact of the pandemic on care 
for people with ADRD, examining the use of primary, emergency, and long-term 
care, as well as deaths due to COVID and to other causes.
METHODS: Among 4.2 million beneficiaries aged 66 and older with ADRD in 
traditional Medicare, monthly deaths and claims for routine care (doctors' 
office and telehealth visits), inpatient/emergency department (ED) visits, and 
long-term care facility use from March or June 2020 through December 2022 are 
compared to monthly rates predicted from January-December 2019 using OLS and 
logistic/negative binomial regression. Correlation analyses examine the 
association between excess deaths - due to COVID and non-COVID causes - and 
changes in care use in the beneficiary's state of residence.
RESULTS: Increased telehealth visits more than offset reduced office visits, 
with primary care visits increasing overall (by 9 percent from June 2020 onward 
relative to the predicted rate from 2019, p < .001). Emergency/inpatient visits 
declined (by 9 percent, p < .001) and long-term care facility use declined, 
remaining 14% below the 2019 trend from June 2020 onward (p < .001). Both COVID 
and non-COVID deaths rose, with 231,000 excess deaths (16% above the prediction 
from 2019), over 80 percent of which were attributable to COVID. Excess deaths 
were higher among women, non-White patients, those in rural and isolated zip 
codes, and those with higher social deprivation index scores. States with 
the largest increases in primary care visits had the lowest excess deaths 
(correlation -0.49).
CONCLUSIONS: Older adults with ADRD had substantial deaths above pre-pandemic 
projections during the COVID-19 pandemic, 80 percent of which were attributed to 
COVID-19. Routine care increased overall due to a dramatic increase in 
telehealth visits, but this was uneven across states, and mortality rates were 
significantly lower in states with higher than pre-pandemic visits.

Alzheimer's disease is associated with a progressive loss of neurons and 
synaptic connections in the cholinergic system. Oxidative stress contributes to 
neuronal damages and to the development of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary 
tangles. Therefore, antioxidants have been widely studied to mitigate the 
progression of Alzheimer's disease, and among these, lipoic acid has 
demonstrated a neuroprotective effect. Here, we present the synthesis, the 
molecular modelling, and the evaluation of lipoic acid-donepezil hybrids based 
on O-desmethyldonepezil. As compounds 5 and 6 display a high inhibition of 
acetylcholinesterase (IC50 = 7.6 nM and 9.1 nM, respectively), selective against 
butyrylcholinesterase, and a notable neuroprotective effect, slightly better 
than that of lipoic acid, the present study suggests that O-desmethyldonepezil 
could serve as a platform for the straightforward design of donepezil hybrids.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a significant neocortical degenerative disorder 
characterized by the progressive loss of neurons and secondary alterations in 
white matter tracts. Understanding the risk factors and mechanisms underlying AD 
is crucial for developing effective treatments. The risk factors associated with 
AD encompass a wide range of variables, including gender differences, family 
history, and genetic predispositions. Additionally, environmental factors such 
as air pollution and lifestyle-related conditions like cardiovascular disease, 
gut pathogens, and liver pathology contribute substantially to the development 
and progression of AD and its subtypes. This review provides current update and 
deeper insights into the role of diverse risk factors, categorizing AD into its 
distinct subtypes and elucidating their specific pathophysiological mechanisms. 
Unlike previous studies that often focus on isolated aspects of AD, our review 
integrates these factors to offer a comprehensive understanding of the disease. 
Furthermore, the review explores a variety of drug targets linked to the 
neuropathology of different AD subtypes, highlighting the potential for targeted 
therapeutic interventions. We further discussed the novel therapeutic options 
and categorized them according to their targets. The roles of different drug 
targets were comprehensively studied, and the mechanism of action of their 
inhibitors was discussed in detail. By comprehensively covering the interplay of 
risk factors, subtype differentiation, and drug targets, this review provides a 
deeper understanding of AD and suggests directions for future research and 
therapeutic strategies.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most predominant neurodegenerative disease and a 
quintessential entity within the dementia umbrella, is a global public health 
crisis. While the lack of disease modifying therapies has been a weak point in 
AD treatment, the success of recently approved monoclonal antibody-based 
therapeutics (aducanumab and lecanemab) targeted at the removal of amyloid-beta 
(Aβ) peptides in the brain is still under debate. There are multiple safety 
concerns about these approved neurotherapeutics including amyloid-related 
imaging abnormalities, stroke, meningitis, encephalitis, and even death. Novel 
paradigms focused on aquaporin-4-mediated neuro-perivascular Aβ and Tau protein 
clearance pathway are garnering attention. In this paper, we argue that 
orchestrating the drug discovery focused on glymphatic clearance-facilitating 
drugs ("glymphotherapeutics") might be a potentially novel and viable strategy 
to mitigate the progression and improve the clinical outcomes of AD.

BACKGROUND: Intersectionality has rarely been considered in research studies of 
cognitive ageing. We investigated whether life-course financial mobility is 
differentially associated with later-life memory function and decline across 
intersectional identities defined by gender, and race and ethnicity.
METHODS: Data were from two harmonised multiethnic cohorts (the Kaiser Healthy 
Aging and Diverse Life Experiences cohort and the Study of Healthy Aging in 
African Americans cohort) in northern California, USA (n=2340). Life-course 
financial mobility, measured using a combination of self-reported financial 
capital measures in childhood (from birth to age 16 years) and later adulthood 
(at the cohort baseline) was defined as consistently high, upwardly mobile, 
downwardly mobile, or consistently low. We clustered individuals into 32 strata 
representing intersectional identities defined by life-course financial mobility 
combined with gender, and race and ethnicity. Verbal episodic memory was 
assessed using the Spanish and English Neuropsychological Assessment Scales over 
four waves from 2017 to 2023. Adjusted mixed-effects linear regression models 
were estimated with and without fixed effects of gender, race and ethnicity, and 
financial mobility, to evaluate whether the random effects of the intersectional 
identity strata contributed variance to memory beyond individual fixed effects.
FINDINGS: Mean age was 73·6 years (SD 8·1). Of 2340 individuals, 1460 (62·4%) 
were women, 880 (37·6%) were men, 388 (16·6%) were Asian, 1136 (48·5%) were 
Black, 334 (14·3%) were Latinx, and 482 (20·6%) were White. Consistently low and 
downwardly mobile financial capital were strongly negatively associated with 
later-life memory at baseline (-0·162 SD units [95% CI -0·273 to -0·051] for 
consistently low and -0·171 [-0·250 to -0·092] for downwardly mobile), but not 
rate of change over time. Intersectional identities contributed 0·2% of memory 
variance after accounting for the fixed effects of gender, race and ethnicity, 
and financial mobility.
INTERPRETATION: Consistently low and downward life-course financial mobility are 
associated with lower later-life memory function. Intersectional identities 
defined by financial mobility in addition to gender, and race and ethnicity, 
contribute negligible additional variance to later-life memory in this study 
setting.

Alzheimer's disease, a prevalent neurodegenerative condition primarily affecting 
older adults, remains incurable. Its principle pathological hallmark is the 
accelerated accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) protein. This study investigates the 
potential of photobiomodulation using near infrared light to counteract 
Aβ1-42-induced synaptic degeneration and neurotoxicity. We focused on the effect 
of 808 nm near-infrared laser diode (LD) on Aβ1-42 cytotoxicity in primary 
cultured cortical neurons. We assessed cell survival using the 
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, 
observing substantial benefits from LD irradiation with a power of 10 mW and a 
dose of 30 J. Cells exposed to Aβ1-42 exhibited morphological changes indicative 
of synaptic damage and a significant decrease in the number of postsynaptic 
density protein-95 (PSD-95) contacts, which were significantly improved with 
near-infrared LD therapy. Furthermore, this therapy reduced Aβ and 
phosphorylated tau (P-tau) protein accumulation. Additionally, near-infrared LD 
irradiation substantially lessened the Aβ1-42-induced rise in glial fibrillary 
acid protein (GFAP) and ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (IBA1) in 
astrocytes and microglia. Remarkably, near-infrared LD irradiation effectively 
inhibited phosphorylation of key proteins involved in Aβ1-42-induced 
necroptosis, namely Receptor-interacting protein kinase-3 (RIP3) and Mixed 
Lineage Kinase domain-Like protein (MLKL). Our findings suggest that 
near-infrared LD treatment significantly reduces neurodegeneration by reducing 
glial overactivation and neuronal necroptosis triggered by Aβ1-42. Thus, 
near-infrared LD treatment emerges as a promising approach for slowing or 
treating Alzheimer's disease, offering new avenues in its management.

BACKGROUND: As cognitive impairment (CI) prevalence rises and primary care 
screening becomes commonplace, it is critical to understand how to support 
clinicians. We describe clinician-reported barriers to diagnosing and managing 
care for patients with CI in a health system with standardized screening. We 
also explore whether barriers differ by clinician type-physician or 
advanced-practice clinician (APC).
METHODS: Theory-informed surveys were administered to primary care clinicians in 
a large integrated health system. The survey assessed barriers, confidence in 
diagnosing CI and managing CI care, beliefs about the consequences of diagnosing 
CI, and usability of the electronic health record (EHR) to diagnose and manage 
CI care; it also included open-ended response items. Descriptive statistics and 
content analysis were used to describe perceived barriers. Differences by 
clinician type were compared using chi-square.
RESULTS: Of the 408 eligible clinicians, 249 started the survey and 247 
completed the primary outcomes (61% response rate). Many said they were only a 
little or not at all confident in diagnosing (70%) and managing care for (60%) 
CI, with specific gaps in confidence in distinguishing types of dementia and 
having CI-related conversations with patients or family/care partners. APCs 
reported lower confidence than physicians. Other barriers were lack of time, low 
usability of EHR, and lack of family/care partner availability. These did not 
differ by clinician type. Open-ended responses suggest clinicians would like 
more support for CI care.
CONCLUSION: Low levels of confidence among other barriers suggest an urgent need 
to develop and implement effective multifaceted strategies to improve CI care.

Neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs) are a class of debilitating diseases that 
progressively impair the protein structure and result in neurological 
dysfunction in the nervous system. Among these disorders, Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), prion diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), and Parkinson's 
disease (PD) are caused by protein misfolding and aggregation at the cellular 
level. In recent years, transition metal complexes have gained significant 
attention for their potential applications in diagnosing, imaging, and curing 
these NDDs. These complexes have intriguing possibilities as therapeutics due to 
their diverse ligand systems and chemical properties and can interact with 
biological systems with minimal detrimental effects. This review focuses on the 
recent progress in transition metal therapeutics as a new era of hope in the 
battle against AD, CJD, and PD by modulating protein aggregation in vitro and in 
vivo. It may shed revolutionary insights into unlocking new opportunities for 
researchers to develop metal-based drugs to combat NDDs.

Accurate assessment of neurological disease through monitoring of biomarkers has 
been made possible using the antibody-based assays. But these assays suffer from 
expensive development of antibody probes, reliance on complicated equipments, 
and high maintenance costs. Here, using the novel reduced graphene 
oxide/polydopamine-molecularly imprinted polymer (rGO/PDA-MIP) as the probe 
layer, a robust electrochemical sensing platform is demonstrated for the 
ultrasensitive detection of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a biomarker 
for a range of neurological diseases. A miniaturized integrated circuit readout 
system is developed to interface with the electrochemical sensor, which empowers 
it with the potential to be used as a point-of-care (POC) diagnostic tool in 
primary clinical settings. This innovative platform demonstrated good 
sensitivity, selectivity, and stability, with imprinting factor evaluated as 
2.8. A record low limit-of-detection (LoD) is down to 754.5 ag mL-1, with a wide 
dynamic range from 1 to 106 fg mL-1. The sensing platform is validated through 
the analysis of GFAP in clinical plasma samples, yielding a recovery rate range 
of 81.6-108.8% compared to Single Molecule Array (Simoa). This cost-effective 
and user-friendly sensing platform holds the potential to be deployed in primary 
and resource-limited clinical settings for the assessment of neurological 
diseases.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a widespread cause of dementia globally, and 
its prevalence is increasing due to the aging population. Two key pathologies 
typically identify this neurodegenerative disease process: the accumulation of 
amyloid plaques and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles containing 
hyperphosphorylated tau. Diagnosis relies on the patient's clinical presentation 
meeting specific criteria, along with the use of fluid and imaging biomarkers. 
The current treatment focuses on addressing symptoms, with ongoing trials aiming 
to decrease the production and overall impact of brain pathology. Here, we 
explore various methods to minimize the risks of AD in patients and individuals 
at high risk of developing it. To address this, we carefully selected 10 
articles that discuss various prevention methods used today to promote brain 
health, including diets that are believed to have neuroprotective properties. 
The study findings emphasize the importance of further strengthening the 
evidence and conducting larger randomized controlled trials to gain a better 
understanding of the potential benefits for individuals at high risk of 
developing AD, as well as those already diagnosed with it.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Pathological changes in the central nervous system (CNS) 
begin before the clinical symptoms of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) manifest, with 
the hippocampus being one of the first affected structures. Current treatments 
fail to alter AD progression. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has shown 
potential in improving AD pathology through multi-target mechanisms. This study 
investigates pathological changes in AD hippocampal tissue and explores TCM 
active components that may alleviate these changes.
METHODS: GSE5281 and GSE173955 datasets were downloaded from GEO and normalized 
to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Key functional modules and 
hub genes were analyzed using Cytoscape and R. Active TCM components were 
identified from literature and the Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of 
China. Enrichment analyses were performed on target genes overlapping with DEGs.
RESULT: From the datasets, 76 upregulated and 363 downregulated genes were 
identified. Hub genes included SLAMF, CD34, ELN (upregulated) and ATP5F1B, 
VDAC1, VDAC2, HSPA8, ATP5F1C, PDHA1, UBB, SNCA, YWHAZ, PGK1 (downregulated). 
Literature review identified 33 active components from 23 herbal medicines. 
Target gene enrichment and analysis were performed for six components: 
dihydroartemisinin, berberine, naringenin, calycosin, echinacoside, and 
icariside II.
CONCLUSION: Mitochondrial to synaptic vesicle dysfunction pathways were enriched 
in downregulated genes. Despite downregulation, UBB and SNCA proteins accumulate 
in AD brains. TCM studies suggest curcumin and echinacoside may improve 
hippocampal pathology and cognitive impairment in AD. Further investigation into 
their mechanisms is needed.

BACKGROUND: Aging is the primary risk factor for the onset of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). Inflamma-aging is a major feature in the process of aging, and the 
chronic neuroinflammation caused by inflamma-aging is closely related to AD. As 
the main participant of neuroinflammation, the polarization of microglia (MG) 
could influence the development of neuroinflammation.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to observe the impact of YHD on microglia (MG) 
polarization and neuroinflammation to delay the onset and progression of AD.
METHODS: In vivo experiment, four-month senescence accelerated mouse prone 8 
(SAMP8) were used as the model group, the SAMR1 mice of the same age were used 
as the control group. In YHD group, 6.24 g/kg YHD was intragastrically 
administrated continuously for 12 weeks, and Ibuprofen 0.026 g/kg in positive 
control group. Morris Water Maze test was used to evaluate the learning and 
memory ability, Nissl's staining and immunofluorescence double staining for 
neuron damage and MG M1/M2 polarization, Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 
(ELISA) for neuroinflammation biomarkers in hippocampus, Western blot for key 
protein expression of TREM2/NF-κB signaling pathway. In vitro experiments, 
10 μM/l Aβ1-42 induced BV-2 cell model was used to re-verify the effect of YHD 
regulating MG polarization to reduce neuroinflammation. Also, TREM2 small 
interfering RNA (siRNA) was used to clarify the key target of YHD.
RESULTS: YHD could improve the learning and memory ability of SAMP8 mice 
evaluated by the Morris Water Maze test. Like Ibuprofen, YHD could regulate the 
M1/M2 polarization of MG and the levels of neuroinflammatory markers TNF-α and 
IL-10 in hippocampus, and relieve neuroinflammation and neuron loss. In 
addition, YHD could also regulate the expression of PU.1, TREM2, p-NF-κB P65 in 
the TREM2/NF-κB signaling pathway. Further in vitro experiments, we found that 
YHD had a significant regulatory effect on Aβ1-42-induced BV-2 cell 
polarization, and it could significantly increase PU.1, TREM2, decrease p-NF-κB 
P65, p-IKKβ, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β. At the same time, using siRNA to inhibit TREM2, 
it proved that TREM2 was a key target for YHD to promote Aβ1-42-induced 
BV-2 cell M2 polarization to reduce neuroinflammation.
CONCLUSIONS: YHD could regulate the TREM2/NF-κB signaling pathway through TREM2, 
thereby to adjust MG polarization and reduce AD-related neuroinflammation.

Alzheimer's disease is a chronic clinical condition that is predominantly seen 
in age groups above 60 years. The early detection of the disease through image 
classification aids in effective diagnosis and suitable treatment. The magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) data on Alzheimer's disease have been collected from 
Kaggle which is a freely available data source. These datasets are divided into 
training and validation sets. The present study focuses on training MRI datasets 
using TinyNet architecture that suits small-scale image classification problems 
by overcoming the disadvantages of large convolutional neural networks. The 
architecture is designed such that convergence time is reduced and overall 
generalization is improved. Though the number of parameters used in this 
architecture is lesser than the existing networks, still this network can 
provide better results. Training MRI datasets achieved an accuracy of 98% with 
the method used with a 2% error rate and 80% for the validation MRI datasets 
with a 20% error rate. Furthermore, to validate the model-supporting data 
collected from Kaggle and other open-source platforms, a comparative analysis is 
performed to substantiate TinyNet's applicability and is projected in the 
discussion section. Transfer learning techniques are employed to infer the 
differences and to improve the model's efficiency. Furthermore, experiments are 
included for fine-tuning attempts at the TinyNet architecture to assess how the 
nuances in convolutional neural networks have an impact on its performance.

BACKGROUND: The incidence of brain cancer and neurodegenerative diseases is 
increasing with a demographic shift towards aging populations. Biological 
parallels have been observed between glioblastoma and Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
which converge on accelerated brain aging. Here, we aimed to map the 
cooccurrence of AD neuropathological change (ADNC) in the tumor-adjacent cortex 
of patients with glioblastoma.
METHODS: Immunohistochemical screening of AD markers amyloid beta (Abeta), 
amyloid precursor protein (APP), and hyperphosphorylated tau (pTau) was 
conducted in 420 tumor samples of 205 patients. For each cortex area, we 
quantified ADNC, neurons, tumor cells, and microglia.
RESULTS: Fifty-two percent of patients (N = 106/205) showed ADNC (Abeta and 
pTau, Abeta or pTau) in the tumor-adjacent cortex, with histological patterns 
widely consistent with AD. ADNC was positively correlated with patient age and 
varied spatially according to Thal phases and Braak stages. It decreased with 
increasing tumor cell infiltration (P < .0001) and was independent of frequent 
expression of APP in neuronal cell bodies (N = 182/205) and in tumor 
necrosis-related axonal spheroids (N = 195/205; P = .46). Microglia response was 
most present in tumor cell infiltration plus ADNC, being further modulated by 
patient age and sex. ADNC did not impact patient survival in the present cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the frequent presence of ADNC in the 
glioblastoma vicinity, which was linked to patient age and tumor location. The 
cooccurrence of AD and glioblastoma seemed stochastic without clear spatial 
relation. ADNC did not impact patient survival in our cohort.

This review investigates the potential of neurosteroids, including brexanolone, 
zuranolone, sepranolone, and ganaxalone, as therapeutic agents for a range of 
mood and neurological disorders. Notably, these disorders encompass postpartum 
depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive disorder 
(MDD), epilepsy, and Alzheimer's disease. Brexanolone and zuranolone have 
emerged as frontrunners in the treatment of postpartum depression, offering 
rapid relief from debilitating symptoms. Their mechanism of action involves 
modulation of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system, which plays a pivotal 
role in mood regulation. Clinical trials have demonstrated their efficacy, 
heralding a potential breakthrough in addressing this often-overlooked 
condition. In the context of PTSD and MDD, neurosteroids have demonstrated 
significant promise. Their positive allosteric modulation of GABA-A receptors 
translates into improved mood stabilization and reduced symptoms. This novel 
approach represents a departure from conventional treatments and could offer 
newfound hope for individuals grappling with these disorders. Beyond mood 
disorders, neurosteroids, especially ganaxalone, exhibit potential in the realm 
of epilepsy management. Ganaxalone's capacity to control seizures is attributed 
to its GABAergic activity, which helps restore the delicate balance of 
neurotransmission in epileptic brains. Moreover, neurosteroids have revealed 
neuroprotective properties in Alzheimer's disease models. By influencing the 
GABAergic system, they mitigate excitotoxicity, a hallmark of Alzheimer's 
pathology. This neuroprotection opens a novel avenue for slowing 
neurodegeneration, although further research and clinical validation are 
essential. In conclusion, this review underscores the substantial therapeutic 
promise of neurosteroids in mood and neurological disorders. Their modulation of 
the GABA system emerges as a central mechanism of action, emphasizing the 
importance of GABAergic signaling in these conditions. The path forward entails 
continued investigation and clinical trials to fully unlock the potential of 
neurosteroids, offering hope for enhanced treatments in these challenging 
clinical domains.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that leads 
to cognitive decline and memory impairment. It is characterized by the 
accumulation of Amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques, the abnormal phosphorylation of tau 
protein forming neurofibrillary tangles, and is often accompanied by 
neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, which contribute to neuronal loss and 
brain atrophy. At present, clinical anti-AD drugs are mostly single-target, 
improving the cognitive ability of AD patients, but failing to effectively slow 
down the progression of AD. Therefore, research on effective multi-target drugs 
for AD has become an urgent problem to address. The main derivatives of 
hydroxycinnamic acid, caffeic acid, and ferulic acid, are widely present in 
nature and have many pharmacological activities, such as antimicrobial, 
antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, anti-Aβ deposition, and so on. 
The occurrence and development of AD are often accompanied by pathologies, such 
as oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and Aβ deposition, suggesting that 
caffeic acid and ferulic acid can be used in the research on anti-AD drugs. 
Therefore, in this article, we have summarized the multi-target anti-AD 
derivatives based on caffeic acid and ferulic acid in recent years, and 
discussed the new design direction of cinnamic acid derivatives as backbone 
compounds. It is hoped that this review will provide some useful strategies for 
anti-AD drugs based on cinnamic acid derivatives.

INTRODUCTION: The relationship between cerebrovascular disease (CVD) and amyloid 
beta (Aβ) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is understudied. We hypothesized that 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based CVD biomarkers-including cerebral 
microbleeds (CMBs), lacunar infarction, and white matter hyperintensities 
(WMHs)-would correlate with Aβ positivity on positron emission tomography 
(Aβ-PET).
METHODS: We cross-sectionally analyzed data from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, N = 1352). Logistic regression was used to 
calculate odds ratios (ORs), with Aβ-PET positivity as the standard-of-truth.
RESULTS: Following adjustment, WMHs (OR = 1.25) and superficial CMBs (OR = 1.45) 
remained positively associated with Aβ-PET positivity (p < 0.001). Deep CMBs and 
lacunes exhibited a varied relationship with Aβ-PET in cognitive subgroups. The 
combined diagnostic model, which included CVD biomarkers and other accessible 
measures, significantly predicted Aβ-PET (pseudo-R2 = 0.41).
DISCUSSION: The study highlights the translational value of CVD biomarkers in 
diagnosing AD, and underscores the need for more research on their inclusion in 
diagnostic criteria.
CLINICALTRIALS: gov: ADNI-2 (NCT01231971), ADNI-3 (NCT02854033).
HIGHLIGHTS: Cerebrovascular biomarkers linked to amyloid beta (Aβ) in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). White matter hyperintensities and cerebral microbleeds 
reliably predict Aβ-PET positivity. Relationships with Aβ-PET vary by cognitive 
stage. Novel accessible model predicts Aβ-PET status. Study supports multimodal 
diagnostic approaches.

INTRODUCTION: We evaluated preliminary feasibility of a digital, 
culturally-informed approach to recruit and screen participants for the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI4).
METHODS: Participants were recruited using digital advertising and completed 
digital surveys (e.g., demographics, medical exclusion criteria, 12-item 
Everyday Cognition Scale [ECog-12]), Novoic Storyteller speech-based cognitive 
test). Completion rates and assessment performance were compared between 
underrepresented populations (URPs: individuals from ethnoculturally minoritized 
or low education backgrounds) and non-URPs.
RESULTS: Of 3099 participants who provided contact information, 654 enrolled in 
the cohort, and 595 completed at least one assessment. Two hundred forty-seven 
participants were from URPs. Of those enrolled, 465 met ADNI4 inclusion criteria 
and 237 evidenced possible cognitive impairment from ECog-12 or Storyteller 
performance. URPs had lower ECog and Storyteller completion rates. Scores varied 
by ethnocultural group and educational level.
DISCUSSION: Preliminary results demonstrate digital recruitment and screening 
assessment of an older diverse cohort, including those with possible cognitive 
impairment, are feasible. Improving engagement and achieving educational 
diversity are key challenges.
HIGHLIGHTS: A total of 654 participants enrolled in a digital cohort to 
facilitate ADNI4 recruitment. Culturally-informed digital ads aided enrollment 
of underrepresented populations. From those enrolled, 42% were from 
underrepresented ethnocultural and educational groups. Digital screening tools 
indicate > 50% of participants likely cognitively impaired. Completion rates and 
assessment performance vary by ethnocultural group and education.

BACKGROUND: Ingestion of gastrointestinal foreign bodies (FB) is a common 
clinical problem worldwide. Approximately 10-20% of FBs require an endoscopic 
procedure for removal, and < 1% require surgery.
CASE DESCRIPTION: An 89-year-old male with Alzheimer's disease was hospitalized 
because of abdominal pain, abdominal distention, vomiting for three days, and 
cessation of bowel movements for six days. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) 
scan showed a small intestinal obstruction and an atypical FB in the small 
intestine. A pill and remaining plastic casing were removed from the small 
intestine during surgery. FB is a square with four sharp acute angles at its 
edge. The patient was discharged after two weeks of treatment, and no recurrence 
or complications were observed during the 6- month follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Atypical intestinal FBs may cause misdiagnosis and easily lead to 
serious complications. Therefore, an appropriate radiological examination, such 
as CT, is necessary for unexplained intestinal obstruction. Symptomatic 
intestinal FBs should be actively removed to avoid serious complications.</p>.

Galanthamine derivatives are known for their AChE inhibitory activity. Among 
them, galanthamine has been approved for treatment of Alzheimer's disease. 
N-Acetylnorgalanthamine (narcisine) and N-(2'-methyl)allylnorgalanthamine (the 
most potent natural AChE inhibitor of galanthamine type) were synthetized using 
N-norgalanthamine as a precursor. The NMR data described previously for 
narcisine were revised by two-dimensional 1H-1H and 1H-13C chemical shift 
correlation experiments. AChE inhibitory assays showed that 
N-acetylnorgalanthamine and N-formylnorgalanthamine (with previously unknown 
activity) are 4- and 43-times, respectively, less potent than galanthamine. In 
vitro (AChE inhibitory) and in silico (docking, ADME) assays and comparison of 
N-(2'-methyl)allylnorgalanthamine with galanthamine prove that this molecule is 
a very promising natural AChE inhibitor (33-times more potent than galanthamine) 
which further in vivo studies would provide better estimation about its 
applicability as a drug.

BACKGROUND: 40 Hz light flickering has shown promise as a non-invasive 
therapeutic approach for alleviating both pathological features and cognitive 
impairments in Alzheimer's disease (AD) model mice and AD patients. 
Additionally, vision may influence olfactory function through cross-modal 
sensory interactions.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of 40 Hz light flickering on olfactory 
behavior in AD model mice and to explore the underlying mechanisms of this 
intervention.
METHODS: We used immunofluorescence techniques to observe the activation of the 
olfactory bulb (OB) in C57BL/6J mice under 40 Hz light flickering. A buried food 
test was conducted to evaluate olfactory behavior in AD mice. Additionally, RNA 
sequencing technology was employed to detect transcriptional alterations in the 
OBs of AD mice following light stimulation.
RESULTS: 40 Hz light flickering was found to effectively activate the OB. This 
stimulation led to enhanced olfactory behavior and did not alter P-tau protein 
mRNA levels within the OBs of AD mice. RNA sequencing revealed significant 
transcriptional changes in the OBs under flickering, particularly related to 
immune responses.
CONCLUSION: Vision can influence olfactory function through cross-modal sensory 
interactions in rodent models. 40 Hz light stimulation improved olfactory 
performance in AD mice. However, the improvement in olfaction in AD mice is not 
related to changes in P-tau mRNA levels. Instead, it may be associated with an 
altered immune response, providing a scientific basis for the clinical treatment 
of olfactory disorders in Alzheimer's disease.

Early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is essential for improving the 
patients outcomes and advancing our understanding of disease, allowing for 
timely intervention and treatment. However, accurate biomarkers are still 
lacking. Recent evidence indicates that hippocampal hyperexcitability precedes 
the diagnosis of AD decades ago, can predict cognitive decline. Thus, could 
hippocampal hyperactivity be a robust biomarker for early-AD, and what drives 
hippocampal hyperactivity in early-AD? these critical questions remain to be 
answered. Increasing clinical and experimental studies suggest that early 
hippocampal activation is closely associated with longitudinal β-amyloid (Aβ) 
accumulation, Aβ aggregates, in turn, enhances hippocampal activity. Therefore, 
in this narrative review, we discuss the role of Aβ-induced altered intrinsic 
neuronal properties as well as structural and functional remodeling of 
glutamatergic, GABAergic, cholinergic, noradrenergic, serotonergic circuits in 
hippocampal hyperactivity. In addition, we analyze the available therapies and 
trials that can potentially be used clinically to attenuate hippocampal 
hyperexcitability in AD. Overall, the present review sheds lights on the 
mechanism behind Aβ-induced hippocampal hyperactivity, and highlights that 
hippocampal hyperactivity could be a robust biomarker and therapeutic target in 
prodromal AD.
