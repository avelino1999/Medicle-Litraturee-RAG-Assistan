Beyond their classical functions as redox cofactors, recent fundamental and 
clinical research has expanded our understanding of the diverse roles of 
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide 
phosphate (NADP) in signaling pathways, epigenetic regulation and energy 
homeostasis. Moreover, NAD and NADP influence numerous diseases as well as the 
processes of aging, and are emerging as targets for clinical intervention. Here, 
we summarize safety, bioavailability and efficacy data from NAD+-related 
clinical trials, focusing on aging and neurodegenerative diseases. We discuss 
the established NAD+ precursors nicotinic acid and nicotinamide, newer compounds 
such as nicotinamide riboside and nicotinamide mononucleotide, and emerging 
precursors. We also discuss technological advances including in industrial-scale 
production and real-time detection, which are facilitating NAD+ research and 
clinical translation. Finally, we emphasize the need for further large-scale 
studies to determine optimal dose, administration routes and frequency, as well 
as long-term safety and interindividual variability in response.

The aging population worldwide faces an increasing burden of age-related 
conditions, with Alzheimer's disease being a prominent neurodegenerative 
concern. Drug repurposing, the practice of identifying new therapeutic 
applications for existing drugs, offers a promising avenue for accelerated 
intervention. In this study, we utilized the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to 
screen a library of 1760 FDA-approved compounds, both with and without 
rapamycin, to assess potential synergistic effects on yeast growth. We 
identified 87 compounds that showed synergistic effect with rapamycin and caused 
growth defects in yeast. Ten compounds from this list were further screened for 
their effects on paralysis in a Caenorhabditis elegans model of Alzheimer's 
disease. We found that three compounds synergistically delayed paralysis in 
combination with rapamycin, suggesting a potential functional redundancy or 
pathway convergence with mTOR signaling. Additionally, four other compounds 
delayed paralysis when tested at different concentrations. Moreover, we tested 
fluphenazine, an antipsychotic drug identified in our screen and found that it 
enhanced the overall health of treated worms. Western blot and X-34 staining 
confirmed that fluphenazine reduced amyloid-beta accumulation. Although these 
findings were obtained in yeast and C. elegans models, further validation in 
mammalian systems is required to confirm their translational relevance. 
Nevertheless, the results underscore the significant potential of repurposed 
drugs to accelerate the discovery of therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease.

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a comparatively inexpensive and non-invasive 
recording technique of neural activity, making it a valuable tool for biomarker 
discovery in transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). This systematic review 
aimed to examine mechanistic and predictive biomarkers, identified through 
TMS-EEG or resting-state EEG, of treatment response to TMS in psychiatric and 
neurocognitive disorders. Nineteen articles were obtained via Embase, APA 
PsycInfo, MEDLINE, and manual search; conditions included, unipolar depression 
(k = 13), Alzheimer's disease (k = 3), bipolar depression (k = 2), and 
schizophrenia (k = 2). Two mechanistic biomarkers were identified: one TMS-EEG 
marker, reductions in N100 post-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) 
repetitive TMS or intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) in unipolar 
depression (n = 120; k = 2), and one resting-state marker, reductions in theta 
connectivity post-DLPFC repetitive TMS in unipolar and bipolar depression 
(n = 89; k = 2). Whereas one predictive TMS-EEG biomarker was isolated: greater 
baseline N100 was predictive of unipolar depression improvement in DLPFC 
repetitive TMS and iTBS (n = 113; k = 2). Promising markers were briefly 
discussed for future research in Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. In 
conclusion, across the psychiatric and neurocognitive disorders considered in 
this study, TMS-EEG and resting-state mechanistic and predictive biomarkers of 
depression appear to hold the most promise. Further research is needed to 
validate the biomarkers identified in depression, to help guide treatment plans 
and advance precision medicine in psychiatry.

We explored the role of Polygonatum Rhizoma polysaccharide (PRP) in delaying 
aging and improving Alzheimer's disease (AD) and revealed its potential 
molecular mechanism. Through chemical characterizations to clarify the 
physicochemical properties of PRP, it was found that PRP mainly consists of 
mannose, glucose, galactose, and arabinose, with molecular weights ranging from 
7.4 × 104 to 9.1 × 104 Da; using Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) models, its 
anti-AD activity was verified by combining approaches using pharmacodynamics, 
molecular biology, metabolomics, and transcriptomics sequencing. The results of 
this study showed that PRP significantly extended the lifespan of C. elegans, 
reduced the accumulations of lipofuscin and increased the ability of C. elegans 
to resist oxidative stress, and reduced the aggregation of Aβ protein in the AD 
model C. elegans, and improved neuromuscular dysfunction. Transcriptomic 
analysis revealed that PRP modulated the expression of genes involved in key 
processes, including anti-stress and senescence (daf-12, skn-1, gst-4, ctl-1, 
sod-3, age-1, gcs-1), autophagy (unc-51, bec-1, lgg-1), and mitochondrial 
function (clk-1, mev-1, isp-1). Metabolomic analysis revealed that PRP improved 
metabolic disorders in C. elegans by regulating phenylalanine/purine metabolism 
pathway. These results indicated that PRP exerted its effects through multiple 
pathways to delay C. elegans aging and improve AD symptoms, providing a strong 
theoretical basis for the development of AD treatment drugs based on traditional 
Chinese medicine.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterised by cognitive decline and the accumulation of misfolded proteins, 
including amyloid-beta and hyperphosphorylated tau, which impair neuronal 
function and promote cell death. These misfolded proteins disrupt proteostasis 
by forming toxic aggregates that exacerbate disease progression. Molecular 
chaperones, such as heat shock proteins, actively maintain protein homeostasis 
by assisting in proper folding, preventing aggregation, and promoting the 
clearance of misfolded proteins. Dysfunction in chaperone systems contributes to 
the pathogenesis of AD, positioning them as promising therapeutic targets. 
Recent research has explored chaperone-based interventions, including small 
molecules, gene therapies, and autophagy and proteasomal degradation modulators, 
to restore protein balance. Advances in high-throughput screening and omics 
technologies have accelerated the identification of potential chaperone 
modulators. Despite these developments, the complexity of AD and the 
shortcomings of existing disease models make it difficult to translate 
preclinical results into successful clinical treatments. This review critically 
examines the role of protein misfolding and chaperone dysfunction in AD, 
evaluates emerging therapeutic strategies, and highlights current clinical 
trials, aiming to bridge molecular mechanisms with translational opportunities 
in the pursuit of novel AD treatments.

Due to the growing number of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, new drugs are 
urgently required. A synthetic nonapeptide, JAL-TA9 (YKGSGFRMI), derived from 
Transducer of ErbB-2.1 (Tob1) protein, cleaves amyloid β (Aβ) 42 with serine 
protease-like activity. Aβ25-35 was chosen because it is the shortest fragment 
that forms fibrils and is cytotoxic. Aβ25-35 has been used to create AD model 
mice, and it appears to be an attractive target for AD therapeutics. Using 
Thioflavin-T assays, the fluorescence intensity of the reaction of Aβ25-35 and 
JAL-TA9 was lower than that of Aβ25-35 without JAL-TA9, and the same result was 
obtained with aggregated Aβ25-35. These data showed that JAL-TA9 inhibits 
aggregation of Aβ25-35 and dissolves its aggregates. Furthermore, electron 
microscopy showed that amyloid fibrils of both Aβ25-35 and aggregated Aβ25-35 
are reduced in the presence of JAL-TA9. The proteolytic activity of JAL-TA9 
against Aβ25-35 was evaluated using HPLC and mass spectrometry. These data 
showed that JAL-TA9 cleaves both soluble and aggregated forms of Aβ25-35. 
JAL-TA9 inhibits neuronal cytotoxicity caused by Aβ25-35 aggregation by cleaving 
Aβ25-35 and its aggregated form. These results suggest that JAL-TA9 is a 
promising candidate for developing novel drugs against AD.

The study of plaques and tangles makes few and inaccurate predictions about the 
main features of cognitive disorders: A narrative review.

The "biological view" of Alzheimer's disease (AD) focuses on the role of plaques 
and tangles and excludes syndromes from the disease definition. However, 
cognitive syndromes are fundamental aspects of AD and are the ultimate target of 
treatments. Accordingly, the study of cognitive syndromes should remain a major 
goal of AD research. We questioned how well the idea of excluding cognitive 
syndromes from the definition of AD is scientifically supported. In this regard, 
we believe that the "biological view" of AD is sustainable if a close 
relationship between plaques and tangles and cognitive disorders is discovered. 
A simple way to preliminarily investigate the strength of this relationship is 
to test whether the study of plaques and tangles allows us to make predictions 
about the characteristics of cognitive impairment. For this purpose, we 
summarized the main data from the literature on the predictions that can be made 
about cognitive impairment from the study of plaques and tangles in AD. The 
results showed that although plaques precede cognitive symptoms, most people 
with plaques do not develop cognitive deficits, and the association between 
plaque distribution and clinical features is weak. Tangles have a stronger 
association with the presence and severity of cognitive decline, but this is 
because tau protein involvement is a more terminal event, occurring as a result 
of neuronal loss. Overall, the predictions that can be made about the main 
features of the cognitive picture from the study of plaques and tangles still 
appear limited and imprecise.

BackgroundWomen have a higher risk of dementia than men. Reproductive factors 
may be implicated.ObjectiveDetermine the association between reproductive 
factors (earlier menarche, later menopause, longer reproductive lifespan (RLS), 
post-menopausal hormone replacement therapy [pmHRT] use, and serum 
estradiol/estrone) and neurocognitive and neuroimaging markers of brain aging 
and incident dementia in cognitively healthy women.MethodsLifetime reproductive 
factors were measured in dementia-free women [mean age 60.3 (SD 9.3) year] from 
the Framingham Heart Study Offspring cohort between 1998-2001 and related to 
concurrent neurocognitive (n = 1329) and MRI brain measures (n = 1165) using 
multivariable linear regression and risk of incident dementia (secondary 
outcome, n = 921) using Cox proportional hazards regression.ResultsUse of pmHRT 
(Beta (β, standardized regression coefficient)±standard error (SE), 0.14 ± 0.05, 
p = 0.009), elevated serum estradiol (0.06 ± 0.03, p = 0.02) and earlier 
menarche (≥14 years versus 12-13 years, -0.13 ± 0.06, p = 0.03) were associated 
with better abstract reasoning (Similarities). Older age at menopause (≥52 years 
versus the referent 50-51 years) (0.18 ± 0.09, p = 0.04), elevated serum 
estradiol (0.06 ± 0.03, p = 0.02), and 1-2 (0.17 ± 0.08, p = 0.03) or ≥3 
(0.22 ± 0.08, p = 0.007) versus no live births were associated with superior 
visuospatial performance (Hooper's visual organization test). Earlier menopause 
age was associated with lower hippocampal volume (≤49 years versus 50-51 years, 
-0.11 ± 0.04, p = 0.02) while 1-2 (5.50 ± 1.95, p = 0.005) and ≥3 live births 
(β±SE, 4.94 ± 1.96, p = 0.01) were associated with greater total cerebral brain 
volume.ConclusionsIn general, greater exposure to estrogen throughout a woman's 
reproductive lifespan was associated with enhanced cognitive performance and 
larger brain volumes. Our results may suggest positive cognitive benefits of 
greater lifetime estrogen exposure, but require further validation.

Engineering functional exosomes represents a cutting-edge approach in 
biomedicine, holding the promise to transform targeted therapy. However, 
challenges such as achieving consistent modification and scalability have 
limited their wider adoption. Herein, we introduce a universal and effective 
strategy for engineering multifunctional exosomes through cell fusion. The 
hybrid-cell-derived exosomes could combine the functional properties of both 
parental cells and be readily produced by passaging. This method enables 
customization and large-scale production of exosomes with specific 
functionalities, potentially advancing precision therapies across a wide array 
of diseases. As demonstrated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) models, exosomes 
derived from hybrid cells (HCs) (H/Exos) of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and 
neutrophils efficiently targeted AD-affected areas via LFA-1/ICAM-1 and improved 
the cognition of AD mice. Beyond directly promoting neural repair and inhibiting 
inflammation, we surprisingly found that H/Exos increased microglia abundance, 
modulated microglia gene expression, enhanced the endocytic and lysosomal 
function, and promoted microglial phagocytic phenotypic differentiation to clear 
Aβ. This hybridoma-inspired strategy offers a versatile and practical way to 
engineer exosomes with desired therapeutic functions, representing a promising 
direction for personalized therapies.

IMPORTANCE: It is unclear whether the duration of amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology is 
associated with neurodegeneration and whether this depends on the presence of 
tau.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of longitudinal atrophy with Aβ positron 
emission tomography (PET)-positivity (Aβ+) and the estimated duration of Aβ+ 
(Aβ+ duration), controlling for tau-positivity.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Data for this longitudinal cohort study were 
drawn from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer Prevention and the Wisconsin 
Alzheimer Disease Research Center Clinical Core Study. Participants who had 2 or 
more magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) visits, 1 Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET 
visit, and 1 MK-6240 PET visit with other covariates available were included. A 
replication analysis was conducted using data from the OASIS-3 dataset. All data 
were collected between June 1, 2009, and January 22, 2025. Follow-up times 
ranged from 1.0 to 13.0 years (median [IQR], 8.8 [5.9-10.6] years).
EXPOSURES: Sampled iterative local approximation (SILA)-estimated PiB PET uptake 
at baseline MRI was used to estimate Aβ+ and its duration at baseline MRI. 
MK-6240 PET uptake in the entorhinal cortex was used to create tau-positive and 
tau-negative groups using a threshold of 1.27 standardized uptake value ratio.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: SILA-based modeling of PiB PET data was used to 
obtain estimated Aβ+ duration at baseline MRI age. Linear mixed-effects models 
tested differences in atrophy between Aβ+ vs Aβ- individuals and with Aβ+ 
duration, controlling for individuals who were tau-positive (measured via 
MK-6240 tau PET) at their most recent PET scan within their MRI visits. Z-scored 
volumes in temporo-parietal regions of interest associated with AD dementia were 
assessed via a robust normative approach.
RESULTS: A total of 95 Aβ+ (median [IQR] age, 66.4 [61.1-70.4] years; 59 female 
[62.11%]) and 275 Aβ- (median [IQR] age, 60.2 [55.7-64.6] years; 183 [66.55%] 
female) individuals were included. Aβ+ (partial η2, 0.015-0.043) and 
tau-positivity (partial η2, 0.018-0.100) were independently associated with 
neurodegeneration, with generally small effect sizes. Aβ+ duration was 
associated with atrophy in a greater number of regions of interest than Aβ+ 
status alone with somewhat larger effect sizes (partial η2, 0.013-0.056). 
Results were mostly similar in the OASIS-3 dataset.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this longitudinal cohort study, subtle 
neurodegeneration was observed soon after the onset of Aβ pathology. These 
results may be consistent with Aβ pathology as a pathological state.

A new whole-body exposure facility for a randomized, double-blind, cross-over 
provocation study investigating possible effects of 50 Hz magnetic field 
exposure on sleep and markers of Alzheimer's disease has been developed and 
dosimetrically analyzed. The exposure facility was custom-tailored for the sleep 
laboratory where the study was carried out and enables magnetic flux densities 
of up to 30 μT with a maximum field inhomogeneity of less than ± 20%. Exposure 
is applied fully software-controlled and in a blinded and randomized manner. The 
orientation of the applied magnetic field vector is varied by the control 
software to create a uniformly distributed set of field vector orientations 
throughout each experimental session. A numerical dosimetric analysis of the 
exposure facility was carried out using several high-resolution anatomical body 
models. Induced electric field strengths in the range of 0.5-0.6 mV/m (99.9th 
percentile of 2 × 2 × 2 mm3 averaged induced electric field strength Ei) inside 
the brain at an external exposure level of 30 μT were obtained for magnetic 
field vector orientations along the three main axes (front-back, left-right, 
head-feet). Statistics of volume averaged values of Ei, analyzed for several 
hundred different brain regions of gray matter, under exposure with varying 
magnetic field vector orientations yield value ranges of 0.001-0.065 mV/m 
(minima), 0.025-0.21 mV/m (mean values), and 0.033-0.34 mV/m (maxima). The 
developed exposure facility was successfully deployed in a recently completed 
experimental study. Bioelectromagnetics. 00:00-00, 2025. © 2025 © 2025

The Hippo signaling pathway is a key regulator of cell growth and cell survival, 
and hyperactivation of the Hippo pathway has been implicated in 
neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's disease. However, the role of 
Hippo signaling in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unclear. We observed that 
hyperactivation of Hippo signaling occurred in the AD model 5xFAD mice. To 
determine how inhibition of Hippo signaling might affect disease pathogenesis, 
we generated 5xFAD mice with conditional neuronal ablation of Lats1 and Lats2, 
the gatekeepers of Hippo signaling activity. Our results indicated that 5xFAD 
mice with ablation of Lats1 and Lats2 were protected against cognitive decline 
compared with control 5xFAD mice, and this protection was correlated with a 
marked reduction in neurodegeneration. Interestingly, primary culture neurons 
with ablation of Lats1 and Lats2 had significantly increased survival following 
treatment with chemical inducers of ferroptosis and exhibited reduced lipid 
peroxidation, the driving force of ferroptotic cell death. Moreover, 5xFAD mice 
with ablation of Lats1 and Lats2 showed reduced lipid peroxidation, and 
transcriptomic analysis revealed that 5xFAD mice with ablation of Lats1 and 
Lats2 had enriched metabolic pathways associated with ferroptosis. These results 
indicate that inhibition of Hippo signaling activity confers neural protection 
in 5xFAD mice by augmenting resilience against ferroptosis.

Calycosin attenuates neuronal ferroptosis in Alzheimer's disease mice by 
activating the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway.

University, Wuhan, China.

In this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of calycosin (from 
Astragalus) in Alzheimer's disease (AD), focusing on ferroptosis modulation. 
APP/PS1 mice received 40 mg/kg calycosin for 3 months. Cognitive function was 
assessed via Morris water maze test. Tau hyperphosphorylation and amyloid-β (Aβ) 
aggregation were analyzed using immunofluorescence and Western blotting. In 
vitro, Aβ1-42-treated HT22 neuronal cells were exposed to calycosin. 
Ferroptosis-related phenotypes were assessed in vivo and in vitro using Prussian 
blue staining, commercial kits, and Western blotting. The nuclear 
factor-erythroid factor 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling was examined by 
Western blotting. Calycosin treatment significantly improved cognitive deficits 
in APP/PS1 mice and inhibited Tau hyperphosphorylation and Aβ aggregation. 
Calycosin attenuated neurotoxicity and Tau hyperphosphorylation in 
Aβ1-42-treated HT22 cells. Moreover, calycosin inhibited ferroptosis in vivo and 
in vitro by decreasing iron aggregation and lipid peroxidation, downregulating 
transferrin receptor expression, and upregulating ferroportin, cystine/glutamate 
antiporter, and glutathione peroxidase 4 expression. Mechanistically, the 
anti-ferroptosis effects of calycosin were linked to the activation of the 
Nrf2-mediated pathway. These findings suggest that calycosin may exhibit 
neuroprotective effects against neuronal ferroptosis in AD, indicating its 
potential as a therapeutic candidate for further investigation in AD.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) have distinct 
pathognomonic features, but they frequently co-occur as mixed dementia (MD) in 
elderly adults. This study aimed to develop a novel MD mouse model using 
bilateral carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) in 5 times familial Alzheimer's disease 
(5xFAD) transgenic mice and characterize its behavioral and histological 
features.
METHODS: Thirteen C57BL/6 and sixteen 5xFAD transgenic mice were prepared. Six 
C57BL/6 and seven 5xFAD transgenic mice underwent BCAS surgery, and all mice 
were housed for 3 months. Mice were divided into wild-type (n = 7), VaD (n = 6), 
AD (n = 9), and MD (n = 7) groups. Neurobehavioral tests, including the Y-maze 
test (YMT) and passive avoidance test (PAT), along with immunohistochemical 
analysis of amyloid β plaque (6E10) and myelin basic protein, were performed.
RESULTS: MD mice exhibited similar deficits in YMT as AD and VaD groups but had 
significantly worse performance in PAT compared to all other groups. 
Histologically, MD mice showed amyloid-β accumulation in the cortex/hippocampus 
and axonal degeneration in the corpus callosum.
CONCLUSION: This novel MD model demonstrates key features of both AD and VaD, 
providing a valuable tool for studying the pathophysiology of mixed dementia and 
testing potential therapeutic interventions.

Medicine, Goyang, Korea. yglee08@gmail.com.

BACKGROUND: Readily available treatments for Alzheimer's disease and related 
dementia (ADRD) include acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl-D-aspartate 
receptor antagonists. Non-adherence and early discontinuation of anti-dementia 
medications are prevalent issues. We aimed to investigate factors associated 
with suboptimal usage of anti-dementia medications in ADRD.
METHODS: Based on data extracted from a claim database in South Korea, 508,958 
patients with ADRD who began taking anti-dementia medication between 2018 and 
2020 were included. The mean possession ratio is the ratio of the sum of 
prescribed medication supply over one year and non-adherence is defined as mean 
possession ratio < 80%. Discontinuation is defined as no prescription of 
anti-dementia medications, or no switch to other anti-dementia medications, 
within 45 days after the run-out date. The cumulative incidence of 
discontinuation of anti-dementia medication was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier 
method. Factors associated with non-adherence were evaluated using logistic 
regression analyses.
RESULTS: Within the first year, the non-adherence ratio was 40.8%, while the 
discontinuation ratio was 43.6%, and approximately 30% of patients discontinued 
medication within 90 days after initiation. Younger age at diagnosis, female 
sex, and prescription at non-tertiary hospitals or clinics other than 
neurology/psychiatry were associated with increased risk of non-adherence. 
Compared with Seoul, a prescription issued by neurology/psychiatry departments 
at a tertiary hospital in other provinces was associated with a 75% higher risk 
of non-adherence.
CONCLUSION: Strategies targeting non-adherence are warranted to minimize 
disparities in the management of patients with dementia.

We describe the rationale, methodology, and design of the Boston University 
Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (BU ADRC) Clinical Core (CC). The CC 
characterizes a longitudinal cohort of participants with/without brain trauma to 
characterize the clinical presentation, biomarker profiles, and risk factors of 
post-traumatic Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD), 
including chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Participants complete 
assessments of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and repetitive head impacts (RHIs); 
annual Uniform Data Set (UDS) and supplementary evaluations; digital 
phenotyping; annual blood draw; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and lumbar 
puncture every 3 years; electroencephalogram (EEG); and amyloid and/or tau 
positron emission tomography (PET) on a subset. As of 3/2025, the CC consists of 
467 participants (mean age: 65.6, 50.1% female), including 163 RHI and 302 TBI 
who completed a UDS 3.0 baseline visit. Common sources of RHI included football 
(n = 95), soccer (n = 26), ice hockey (n = 17), and military service (n = 46). 
Most TBIs were mild (97.7%). Eighty-nine percent agreed to brain donation. The 
BU ADRC CC will facilitate research, education, and training on post-traumatic 
AD/ADRD. HIGHLIGHTS: The Boston University Alzheimer's Disease Research Center 
(ADRC) Clinical Core facilitates unique research, education, and training on 
Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease-related dementias (AD/ADRD) with a 
focus on post-traumatic AD/ADRD, including chronic traumatic encephalopathy 
(CTE). We summarize the rationale, mission, study design, and recent updates for 
the Clinical Core. As of March 2025, the Clinical Core includes a longitudinal 
cohort of 467 participants enriched for repetitive head impacts (∼1/3) and 
traumatic brain injury (∼1/3) exposure who span the cognitive continuum, with 
most having available fluid and neuroimaging biomarker data and agreeing to 
brain donation (89%).

Neurodegenerative diseases and spinal cord injuries (SCI) pose a significant 
burden on the healthcare system globally. Diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, 
Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington's disease 
precipitate cognitive, motor, and behavioral deficits. Parallelly, spinal cord 
injuries produce sensory and motor deficits, which are burdensome 
psychologically, socially, and economically. Current management strategies focus 
only on symptomatic relief, with no definitive cure. Stem cells have been 
explored for regenerative therapy. This review focuses on developments, 
limitations, and future potential of stem cell therapy. Stem cells affect the 
central nervous system via neuroprotective mechanisms, immunomodulatory effects, 
and mitigation of oxidative stress. The clinical implications of stem cell 
therapy in treating neurodegenerative diseases and SCI are debatable due to 
varied outcomes. Challenges related to sample size, long-term follow-up, and 
assessment of adverse effects should be mitigated in future research. 
Researchers are currently exploring optimal stem cell types along with various 
transplantation strategies. Biomaterials integrated with stem cells are a novel 
approach for treating neurodegenerative diseases and spinal cord injuries. 
Certain genetic modifications have shown improved results. Screening patients to 
ascertain better responses to therapy has proven to be a challenge. Other 
complications include graft vs. host reaction and degeneration of transplanted 
neurons due to pathogenesis and tumorigenesis. However, the majority of the 
potential stem cell therapeutic avenues are in the preclinical stage and are 
being tested on animal models. Guidelines pertaining to ethical concerns and 
regulatory frameworks need to be established to unfold the full potential of 
stem cell therapy in the clinical setting. Recent advances also show an 
increased need to formulate patient-specific approaches to treatment, ranging 
from stem cell selection to the technique of transplantation. Ongoing clinical 
trials can address the current challenges and leverage emerging technologies, 
leading to definitive treatments for neurodegenerative diseases and spinal cord 
injuries.

Oral health is important for the overall health of an individual, particularly 
older adults. However, a number of obstacles frequently prevent older people 
from receiving timely and appropriate dental care. These obstacles are intricate 
and multifaceted, involving systemic diseases, cognitive elements, and 
psychological, financial, and educational issues. Dementia and Alzheimer's 
disease are examples of cognitive impairments that can make it difficult for an 
elderly person to seek or cooperate with dental treatment. Additional 
psychological factors that decrease care-seeking behaviour include anxiety, fear 
of dental treatments, depression, and a general lack of motivation. Financial 
constraints are major deterrents, such as low income and no dental insurance. 
Furthermore, polypharmacy and multimorbidity not only make treatment planning 
more difficult, but they also deprive oral health of priority. The problem is 
made worse by systemic healthcare barriers like inadequate referral systems, a 
lack of geriatric-focused dentists, and poor integration between dental and 
medical services. Neglect is also exacerbated by older adults' and their 
caregivers' perceived lack of need for dental care. A comprehensive, 
multidisciplinary strategy is needed to address these issues, one that 
incorporates training dental professionals in geriatric care, better public 
health regulations, caregiver education, and the creation of easily accessible, 
reasonably priced services. Improving the general and oral health of the elderly 
requires an understanding of and commitment to removing these obstacles.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder marked by 
cognitive decline and the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, with current 
treatments offering only limited efficacy. Targeted photo-oxygenation of Aβ 
using small-molecule photosensitizers has emerged as a promising strategy to 
modulate amyloid aggregation and mitigate associated toxicity. In this work, the 
rational design and synthesis of donor-engineered, benzimidazole-functionalized 
aggregation-induced emission (AIE) photosensitizer with optimized photophysical 
and morphological properties for multimodal theranostic applications in AD is 
analyzed and reported. Among the synthesized probes, BI-TPA demonstrates 
selective binding to Aβ aggregates, effective inhibition of Aβ40 fibril 
formation, and efficient photo-oxygenation with minimal cytotoxicity. 
Comprehensive photophysical and biological studies reveal its multi-stimuli 
responsiveness, Fe(III) ion selectivity, rapid cellular uptake, and 
organelle-specific localization, along with the ability to mitigate Aβ-mediated 
apoptosis. Collectively, these highlights position BI-TPA as a potent 
multifunctional agent capable of both detection and therapeutic intervention in 
AD. This work presents a multifaceted design strategy for next-generation 
AIE-based photosensitizers, with broad implications for the development of 
integrated diagnostic and therapeutic platforms targeting complex 
neurodegenerative diseases.

Neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, 
Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia 
represent a significant global health burden with limited therapeutic options. 
Current treatments are primarily symptomatic and fail to modify disease 
progression, emphasizing the urgent need for novel, mechanism-based 
interventions. Recent advances in molecular neuroscience have identified several 
non-classical pathogenic pathways, including neuroinflammation, mitochondrial 
dysfunction, impaired autophagy and proteostasis, synaptic degeneration and 
non-coding RNA dysregulation. In this focused review, we highlight emerging 
molecular targets such as TREM2, NLRP3, mTOR, TFEB, PINK1 and SIRT3, which offer 
promising avenues for therapeutic intervention. We also address challenges in 
target validation and translational drug development, while proposing future 
research directions that may facilitate the design of more effective treatments. 
A deeper understanding of these molecular mechanisms is essential for developing 
disease-modifying strategies to combat neurodegeneration.

INTRODUCTION: Among individuals who are amyloid biomarker-positive or 
apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 carriers, arterial stiffness reflected by higher 
pulse wave velocity (PWV) has been associated with lower cognition 
cross-sectionally. Less is known about longitudinal associations.
METHODS: The sample included 152 older adults without dementia. Linear 
mixed-effects models examined if PWV (1) was associated with cognitive decline 
and (2) interacted with APOE ɛ4 status or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid 
positivity on cognitive decline.
RESULTS: PWV was not associated with cognitive decline across any domains. There 
was an interaction between PWV and CSF amyloid positivity on executive function 
(p = 0.038) and language (p = 0.047), such that higher PWV was related to faster 
decline in CSF amyloid-positive individuals relative to amyloid-negative 
individuals. PWV did not interact with APOE ɛ4 status on cognitive decline.
DISCUSSION: PVW, as a marker of vascular risk, may adversely modify the 
trajectory of cognitive decline, particularly in amyloid-positive individuals.
HIGHLIGHTS: Pulse wave velocity (PWV) was not associated with cognitive decline 
in any domain. Amyloid status moderated the effect of PWV on executive function 
and language decline. Higher PWV was associated with faster decline among 
amyloid-positive individuals. There was no interaction between PWV and 
apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 status on cognitive decline.

INTRODUCTION: Asymptomatic extracranial carotid artery disease (aECAD) is 
associated with increased Alzheimer's disease (AD) and non-AD dementia risk. 
aECAD treatment includes carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid artery 
stenting (CAS) for stroke prevention, but their impact on dementia incidence is 
poorly studied.
METHODS: Propensity score matching was used in a retrospective cohort study of 
United States-based insurance claims (2010-2022) in 487,676 patients with aECAD 
to evaluate the effect of CEA and CAS on AD and non-AD dementia incidence.
RESULTS: After matching, 37,317 patients underwent CEA or CAS. CEA was 
associated with a significantly lower AD risk (relative risk = 0.93; 95% 
confidence interval, 0.86-0.99; P < 0.05), whereas CAS was associated with a 
slight but non-significant increase. Similar trends were observed for non-AD 
dementia.
DISCUSSION: CEA, but not CAS, may confer a protective effect against AD and 
non-AD dementia in patients with aECAD, a common cerebrovascular disease 
affecting up to 15% of adults over age 60.
HIGHLIGHTS: Asymptomatic extracranial carotid artery disease (aECAD) is 
associated with increased Alzheimer's disease (AD) and non-AD dementia risk. 
Limited studies have evaluated the role of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and 
(carotid artery stenting (CAS) on dementia outcomes. Using United States-based 
insurance claims data, 487,676 patients with aECAD were evaluated. After 
propensity score matching, CEA was significantly associated with reduced AD 
risk. CAS was not significantly associated with a change in AD risk.

INTRODUCTION: Midlife hypertension is associated with dementia risk, although 
uncertainties remain regarding its association with subtypes and regarding the 
effect of pregnancy-related hypertension on dementia risk.
METHODS: In the Million Women Study, 1,363,457 women (mean age 57) were asked 
about current treatment for hypertension and hypertension in pregnancy and were 
followed for first hospital record with any mention of dementia. Cox regression 
yielded hazard ratios (HRs) adjusted for socioeconomic, lifestyle, and metabolic 
factors.
RESULTS: With 84,729 dementia cases over 21 years, midlife hypertension was 
positively associated with dementia (HR 1.17, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.15 
to 1.19); higher for vascular dementia (VaD) (HR 1.50; 95% CI 1.45 to 1.56) than 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) (HR 1.01; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.04). Hypertension in 
pregnancy but not in midlife was only weakly associated with dementia (HR 1.04; 
95% CI 1.01 to 1.06).
DISCUSSION: Midlife hypertension is a strong risk factor for dementia, largely 
through VaD. Hypertension during pregnancy does not appear to materially affect 
dementia risk.
HIGHLIGHTS: Midlife hypertension was associated with long-term all-cause 
dementia risk. Midlife hypertension was associated with VaD, not AD. 
Hypertension in pregnancy has little effect on dementia risk.

This review covers recent advances (2023-2024) in neuroimaging research into the 
pathophysiology, progression, and treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 
related dementias (ADRD). Despite the rapid emergence of blood-based biomarkers, 
neuroimaging continues to be a vital area of research in ADRD. Here, we discuss 
neuroimaging as a powerful tool to topographically visualize and quantify 
amyloid, tau, neurodegeneration, inflammation, and vascular disease in the 
brain. We examine the utility of neuroimaging for (1) tracking the 
spatiotemporal progression of pathology, (2) serving as the reference standard 
for validating novel fluid biomarkers, (3) characterizing disease heterogeneity, 
(4) exploring the role of brain networks in ADRD progression, and (5) evaluating 
biomarkers for better individualized estimates of treatment benefit. Finally, we 
discuss advances in radiotracer development and AD risk factors. By reviewing 
the most promising breakthroughs in the neuroimaging field, we hope to spark new 
ideas for future discoveries that will deepen our understanding of ADRD. 
HIGHLIGHTS: The diagnostic and staging criteria for Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
were updated in 2024. Despite robust harmonization methods for amyloid beta 
positron emission tomography (PET), parallel efforts for tau PET remain 
challenging. Larger anti-amyloid drug effects were seen at lower levels of 
amyloid and tau PET. Phosphorylated tau217 (p-tau217) is currently the most 
promising plasma biomarker to detect AD pathology. There are new tracer 
developments for alpha-synuclein, primary tauopathies, and inflammation.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasingly recognized as a 
multifactorial disorder with vascular contributions, including a pro-coagulant 
state marked by fibrin deposition in the brain. Fibrin accumulation may 
exacerbate cerebral hypoperfusion and neuroinflammation, leading to 
neurodegeneration. Identifying patients with this pathology could enable 
targeted anticoagulant therapy. However, current imaging tools lack the 
specificity and sensitivity to detect fibrin in the brain non-invasively. This 
study aimed to develop and evaluate brain-penetrating peptide- and 
antibody-based PET radioligands targeting fibrin to enable individualized 
treatment strategies in AD.
RESULTS: A fibrin-binding peptide (FBP) was conjugated to the antibody fragment 
scFv8D3, which targets the transferrin receptor (TfR), to facilitate 
transcytosis across the blood-brain barrier. FBP-scFv8D3 bound TfR and with 
modest affinity to fibrin. In vivo studies in Tg-ArcSwe mice, that exhibit 
fibrin along with brain amyloid-β pathology, and wild-type mice showed that 
[125I]FBP-scFv8D3 retained brain-penetrating properties but did not demonstrate 
significant fibrin-specific retention. In contrast, the monoclonal antibody 1101 
and its bispecific, brain penetrant variant 1101-scFv8D3 exhibited higher fibrin 
selectivity and TfR binding. Both antibodies showed a trend towards higher brain 
retention in Tg-ArcSwe mice and [125I]1101-scFv8D3 showed a higher 
brain-to-blood ratio compared to [124I]1101. PET imaging with [124I]1101 and 
[124I]1101-scFv8D3 revealed low global brain uptake. However, ex vivo 
autoradiography and regional PET quantification (ROI-to-cerebellum ratios) 
indicated significant cortical and caudate retention of [124I]1101-scFv8D3 in 
Tg-ArcSwe mice, supporting region-specific target engagement.
CONCLUSION: This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility of using 
bispecific antibody-based PET radioligands to target fibrin in the AD brain. 
While the FBP-scFv8D3 conjugate showed limited specificity, the bispecific 
antibody 1101-scFv8D3 exhibited higher brain penetration and fibrin selectivity. 
These findings support further development of antibody-based imaging tools 
toward the goal to stratify AD patients who may benefit from anticoagulant 
therapy.

Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera), a revered herb in Ayurvedic medicine, has 
gained significant scientific recognition for its potential to promote healthy 
aging. Traditionally used as a Rasayana or rejuvenator, this potent adaptogen 
helps the body manage stress and enhance vitality. This review synthesises 
extensive evidence for its multifaceted anti-aging capabilities, which target 
key hallmarks of the aging process. The mechanisms underpinning its effects 
include enhancing telomerase activity to support cellular longevity, combating 
systemic oxidative stress, and powerfully countering inflammaging by modulating 
immune responses and lowering inflammatory markers like C-reactive protein. 
Robust clinical evidence demonstrates its efficacy in improving crucial 
physiological parameters, including significant gains in muscle strength and 
size, enhanced cardiorespiratory fitness, hormonal balance, skin health, and 
improved sleep quality in older adults. Furthermore, trials have consistently 
shown its ability to improve cognitive function, including memory and 
information-processing speed, particularly in adults with mild cognitive 
impairment. Promising preclinical data also highlight its neuroprotective 
potential in models of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Here, we review the 
current evidence supports Ashwagandha's therapeutic potential in extending 
healthspan and enhancing quality of life. Large-scale, long-term clinical trials 
using standardized extracts are essential to fully confirm its role in healthy 
aging within the global population.

    medRxiv. 2025 Feb 24:2025.02.23.24319116. doi: 10.1101/2025.02.23.24319116.

Blood-based biomarkers (BBMs) have emerged as promising tools to enhance 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. Despite two-thirds of dementia cases 
occurring in the Global South, research on BBMs has predominantly focused on 
populations from the Global North. This geographical disparity hinders our 
understanding of BBM performance in diverse populations. To address this, we 
evaluated the diagnostic properties of AD BBMs in a real-world memory clinic 
from Brazil, one of the largest countries in the Global South. We measured blood 
and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers - amyloid-β (Aβ)40, Aβ42, 
phosphorylated tau (p-tau) 217, neurofilament light (NfL) chain, and glial 
fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) - in 59 individuals. Sample comprised 20 
cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals, 22 with AD dementia, and 17 with 
vascular dementia (VaD). We compared BBM levels across diagnostic groups and 
assessed their discriminative ability for AD. Notably, individuals with VaD and 
AD had lower educational levels (6.8 ± 3.0) compared to CU individuals 
(17.3 ± 6.9). Among the BBMs tested, plasma p-tau217 demonstrated the best 
performance, exhibiting high accuracy in differentiating CU from AD (AUC 0.96) 
and Aβ pathology (AUC 0.98). However, the ability of AD BBMs to distinguish 
between AD and VaD was lower than expected (AUC from 0.52-0.79), particularly 
when compared to studies from the Global North. Our findings highlight the 
potential utility of BBMs for AD diagnosis in real-world settings within Brazil. 
However, they also underscore the need for proper implementation and validation 
of these biomarkers within these populations to ensure accurate and reliable 
results.

To understand shared and ancestry-specific genetic control of brain protein 
expression and its ramifications for disease, we mapped protein quantitative 
trait loci (pQTLs) in 1,362 brain proteomes from African American, 
Hispanic/Latin American and non-Hispanic white donors. Among the pQTLs that 
multiancestry fine-mapping MESuSiE confidently assigned as putative causal pQTLs 
in a specific population, most were shared across the three studied populations 
and are referred to as multiancestry causal pQTLs. These multiancestry causal 
pQTLs were enriched for exonic and promoter regions. To investigate their 
effects on disease, we modeled the 858 multiancestry causal pQTLs as 
instrumental variables using Mendelian randomization and genome-wide association 
study results for neurologic and psychiatric conditions (21 traits in 
participants with European ancestry, 10 in those with African ancestry and 4 in 
Hispanic participants). We identified 119 multiancestry pQTL-protein pairs 
consistent with a causal role in these conditions. Remarkably, 29% of the 
multiancestry pQTLs in these pairs were coding variants. These results lay an 
important foundation for the creation of new molecular models of neurologic and 
psychiatric conditions that are likely to be relevant to individuals across 
different genetic ancestries.

The dopaminergic system may be at the base of some neurobehavioral symptoms, as 
apathy and depression, and extrapyramidal symptoms, often seen in Alzheimer's 
disease patients. It can also have an impact on cognitive decline, as 
extrapyramidal symptoms, classically linked with dopamine dysfunction, are 
associated with increased risk of cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease 
progression. We review the knowledge of the dopaminergic system, emphasizing 
changes in Alzheimer's disease. Both animal models, post-mortem and in vivo 
human studies, point to a dopaminergic system dysfunction in this disease. 
Dopamine dysfunction seems more associated with neuronal loss, modification of 
dopamine receptors and anomalies in terminal function, including irregularities 
in dopamine metabolism, than with neurofibrillary tangles or β-amyloid plaques 
depositions. This dysfunction has an impact on both cognitive and non-cognitive 
symptoms. A better understanding of the dopaminergic system may help in 
understanding the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease and assist in the 
diagnosis. Clinical trials aimed at modulating the dopaminergic system may be 
promising in the treatment of symptoms associated with Alzheimer's disease.

Microglia regulate neuronal circuit plasticity. Disrupting their homeostatic 
function has detrimental effects on neuronal circuit health. Neuroinflammation 
contributes to the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases, 
including Alzheimer's disease (AD), with several microglial activation genes 
linked to increased risk for these conditions. Inflammatory microglia alter 
neuronal excitability, inducing metabolic strain. Interestingly, expression of 
APOE4, the strongest genetic risk factor for AD, affects both microglial 
activation and neuronal excitability, highlighting the interplay between lipid 
metabolism, inflammation, and neuronal function. It remains unclear how 
microglial inflammatory state is conveyed to neurons to affect circuit function 
and whether APOE4 expression alters this intercellular communication. Here, we 
use a reductionist model of human iPSC-derived microglial and neuronal 
monocultures to dissect how the APOE genotype in each cell type independently 
contributes to microglial regulation of neuronal activity during inflammation. 
Conditioned media (CM) from LPS-stimulated microglia increased neuronal network 
activity, assessed by calcium imaging, with APOE4 microglial CM driving greater 
neuronal activity than APOE3 CM. Both APOE3 and APOE4 neurons increase network 
activity in response to CM treatments, while APOE4 neurons uniquely increase 
presynaptic puncta in response to APOE4 microglial CM. CM-derived exosomes from 
LPS-stimulated microglia can mediate increases to network activity. Finally, 
increased network activity is accompanied by increased lipid droplet (LD) 
metabolism, and blocking LD metabolism abolishes network activity. These 
findings illuminate how microglia-to-neuron communication drives 
inflammation-induced changes in neuronal circuit function, demonstrate a role 
for neuronal LDs in network activity, and support a potential mechanism through 
which APOE4 increases neuronal excitability.

IMPORTANCE: Exposure to fine particulate matter air pollution (PM2.5) may 
increase risk for dementia. It is unknown whether this association is mediated 
by dementia-related neuropathologic change found at autopsy.
OBJECTIVE: To examine associations between PM2.5 exposure, dementia severity, 
and dementia-associated neuropathologic change.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study used data associated with 
autopsy cases collected from 1999 to 2022 at the Center for Neurodegenerative 
Disease Research Brain Bank at the University of Pennsylvania. Data were 
analyzed from January to June 2025. Participants included 602 cases with common 
forms of dementia and/or movement disorders and older controls after excluding 
429 cases with missing data on neuropathologic measures, demographic factors, 
APOE genotype, or residential address.
EXPOSURES: One-year mean PM2.5 concentration prior to death or prior to last 
Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) assessment was estimated using a 
spatiotemporal prediction model at residential addresses.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Dementia severity was measured by CDR-SB scores. Ten 
dementia-associated neuropathologic measures representing Alzheimer disease, 
Lewy body disease, limbic-predominant age-related transactive response 
DNA-binding protein (TDP)-43 encephalopathy, and cerebrovascular disease were 
graded or staged. Linear, logistic, and structural equation models were used to 
examine the associations between PM2.5, CDR-SB, and neuropathologic measures, 
adjusting for demographic factors and APOE ε4 allele status.
RESULTS: In a total of 602 autopsy cases (median [IQR] age at death, 78 [71-85] 
years; 328 male [54.5%] and 274 female [45.5%]), higher PM2.5 exposure prior to 
death was associated with increased odds of more severe Alzheimer disease 
neuropathologic change (ADNC) (odds ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.11-1.28). In a subset 
of 287 cases with CDR-SB records (median [IQR] age at death, 79 [72-86] years; 
154 [53.7%] male and 133 female [46.3%]), higher PM2.5 exposure prior to CDR-SB 
assessment was associated with greater cognitive and functional impairment 
(β = 0.48; 95% CI, 0.22-0.74). Lastly, 63% of the association between higher 
PM2.5 exposure and greater cognitive and functional impairment was statistically 
mediated by ADNC (β = 0.30; 95% CI, 0.04-0.53).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, PM2.5 exposure was associated with 
increased dementia severity and increased ADNC. Population-based studies are 
needed to better understand this relationship.

c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), a subfamily of mitogen-activated protein 
kinases (MAPKs), are key mediators of cellular responses to environmental 
stress, inflammation, and apoptotic signals. The three isoforms-JNK1, JNK2, and 
JNK3 exhibit both overlapping and isoform-specific functions. While JNK1 and 
JNK2 are broadly expressed across tissues and regulate immune signaling, cell 
proliferation, and apoptosis, JNK3 expression is largely restricted to the 
brain, heart, and testis, where it plays a crucial role in neuronal function and 
survival. Subtle structural variations among the isoforms, particularly within 
the ATP-binding pocket and activation loop, provide a basis for the developing 
isoform-selective inhibitors to improve therapeutic precision. JNK3 has been 
increasingly recognized for its involvement in the pathogenesis of 
neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, 
through mechanisms involving neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and neuronal 
apoptosis. Given the limited efficacy of current therapies, which remain largely 
symptomatic and do not modify disease progression, covalent inhibitors of JNK3 
represent a compelling alternative due to their potential for high selectivity 
and sustained target engagement. In parallel, JNK signaling contributes to 
fibrosis, with JNK1 serving as the predominant isoform driving profibrotic 
pathways such as fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix (ECM) 
deposition. Current antifibrotic agents provide only partial benefit and lack 
specificity for downstream effectors like JNK1. PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras 
(PROTACs), which induce selective protein degradation via the 
ubiquitin-proteasome system, represent a promising modality to overcome these 
limitations. Selective degradation of JNK1 could provide a novel therapeutic 
avenue for fibrotic diseases. This review highlights therapeutic efforts to date 
and discusses how emerging approaches-particularly covalent JNK3 inhibitors for 
neurodegeneration and PROTACs for JNK1 in fibrosis-may advance future treatment 
paradigms.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder primarily 
characterized by cognitive decline and behavioral impairments, typically 
manifesting in the elderly and presenile population. With the rapid global aging 
trend, early diagnosis and treatment of AD have become increasingly urgent 
research priorities. The primary pathological features of AD include excessive 
accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques, the formation of neurofibrillary 
tangles, and neuronal loss. Conventional diagnostic techniques, such as positron 
emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
analysis, are limited by their high cost and invasiveness. As a result, there is 
growing interest in developing blood-based biomarker assays for AD detection. 
Electrochemical biosensors offer notable advantages in this context, including 
high sensitivity, low cost, and minimally invasive sampling. However, due to the 
extremely low concentrations of AD-related biomarkers in blood, signal 
amplification is necessary. The incorporation of nanomaterials significantly 
enhances the sensitivity and performance of the electrochemical biosensors. This 
Perspective highlights the application of various nanomaterial-enhanced 
electrochemical biosensors in the early diagnosis and disease monitoring of AD, 
underscoring their potential in advancing AD prevention, diagnosis, and 
therapeutic strategies.

BACKGROUND: Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) encompasses diverse clinical 
phenotypes, primarily characterized by behavioral and/or language dysfunction. A 
newly characterized variant, semantic behavioral variant FTD (sbvFTD), exhibits 
predominant right temporal atrophy with features bridging behavioral variant FTD 
(bvFTD) and semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA). This study 
investigates the longitudinal structural MRI correlates of these FTD variants, 
focusing on cortical and subcortical structural damage to aid differential 
diagnosis and prognosis.
METHODS: Seventy-one FTD patients (bvFTD = 45, sbvFTD = 11, svPPA = 15) and 37 
healthy controls participated in a prospective study involving up to 24 months 
of serial neurological, neuropsychological, and 3 T MRI assessments. Cortical 
thickness and subcortical/cerebellar volumes were analyzed with linear 
mixed-effect models. Support vector machine (SVM) models were used to classify 
subjects using baseline and longitudinal patterns of structural damage.
RESULTS: At baseline, sbvFTD showed right-predominant temporal pole involvement 
associated with significant right frontal atrophy. Longitudinally, bvFTD showed 
widespread bilateral cortical and basal ganglia damage, svPPA demonstrated 
steady temporal lobe progression, and sbvFTD progressed primarily in left 
temporal and frontal regions with limited right hemisphere involvement. Baseline 
cortical thickness of frontal regions predicted subsequent functional decline in 
bvFTD and sbvFTD. A multiclass SVM model provided a good diagnostic 
classification accuracy, with similar results when using baseline data only 
(82%) and adding longitudinal data (83%).
CONCLUSIONS: This study delineates the unique structural MRI features and 
progression of FTD variants, highlighting sbvFTD as a distinct entity with early 
extra-temporal involvement. These findings support the development of diagnostic 
and prognostic tools leveraging neuroimaging biomarkers.

Cognitive impairment represents a progressive neurodegenerative condition with 
severity ranging from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia and exerts 
significant burdens on both individuals and healthcare systems. Vascular 
cognitive impairment (VCI) represents a heterogeneous clinical continuum, 
spanning a spectrum from subcortical ischemic VCI (featuring small vessel 
disease, white matter lesions, and lacunar infarcts) to mixed dementia, where 
vascular and Alzheimer's-type pathologies coexist. While traditionally linked to 
macro- and microvascular dysfunction, the mechanisms underlying VCI remain 
complex. However, contemporary research has gone beyond structural vascular 
damage, highlighting the neurovascular unit (NVU) as a critical mediator. 
Emerging evidence demonstrates that cerebral endothelial cells within the NVU 
not only regulate oxygen and nutrient transport but also orchestrate 
neuroinflammatory signaling and neurovascular coupling (NVC). Crucially, 
endothelial dysfunction initiates a self-perpetuating cycle of NVU dysregulation 
characterized by: (1) NVC impairment through diminished nitric oxide 
bioavailability and calcium signaling defects, (2) blood-brain barrier (BBB) 
breakdown via tight-junction protein degradation and pericyte detachment, and 
(3) neuroinflammation driven by endothelial-derived cytokine release and 
leukocyte infiltration. By integrating recent advances in NVU biology, we have 
established a framework to inform clinical strategies for early diagnosis and 
targeted therapies, which we outline in this review. Moreover, proactive 
management of vascular risk factors (e.g., hypertension, diabetes) in 
presymptomatic stages may mitigate the progression from vascular injury to 
irreversible dementia, underscoring its preventive potential. These insights 
reinforce the idea that preserving NVU integrity represents a pivotal approach 
to mitigating the global dementia burden.

Neurocognitive disorders represent a significant global health challenge and are 
characterized by progressive cognitive decline across conditions including 
Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, and diabetes-related cognitive 
impairment. The hippocampus is essential for learning and memory and requires 
intact neuroplasticity to maintain cognitive function. Recent evidence has 
identified the brain insulin signaling pathway as a key regulator of hippocampal 
neuroplasticity through multiple cellular processes including synaptic 
plasticity, neurotransmitter regulation, and neuronal survival. Dysregulation of 
this pathway contributes substantially to the pathophysiology of cognitive 
dysfunction in various disorders. Mechanistically, insulin modulates hippocampal 
neuroplasticity primarily through the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein 
kinase B (Akt) and mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular 
signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) cascades, both of which promote synaptic 
plasticity and support neurogenesis. Beyond its neuronal effects, insulin 
signaling also regulates glial and endothelial cell function, orchestrating a 
coordinated multicellular response that is critical for hippocampal integrity. 
Emerging therapeutic approaches that target this pathway include intranasal 
insulin administration, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, and 
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonists. These have 
demonstrated promising efficacy in restoring hippocampal function and improving 
cognitive outcomes in both preclinical and clinical studies. This review 
synthesizes current knowledge on the relationship between brain insulin 
signaling and hippocampal neuroplasticity. In addition, we highlight the 
therapeutic potential of insulin-targeted interventions for neurocognitive 
disorders, including quantifiable outcomes and sex-specific considerations.

BACKGROUND: Despite the availability of these therapies, maintaining long-term 
adherence remains a significant challenge.
OBJECTIVE: This retrospective cohort study aimed to investigate 12-month and 
5-year persistence with antidementia drug therapy in Germany and to examine the 
association between demographic and clinical variables and the risk of therapy 
discontinuation.
METHODS: Patients aged 60 years or older from the IQVIA Longitudinal 
Prescription Database who received an initial prescription for antidementia 
therapy between 2016 and 2023 (index date) were included. Time to 
discontinuation was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and a multivariable 
Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess associations between 
predefined variables and the risk of discontinuation.
RESULTS: The study included 567,815 patients (mean age: 80.2 years, 59.1% 
female). Five years after the index date, 19.8% of dementia patients were still 
receiving therapy, with a 12-month persistence rate of 53.1%. Cox regression 
models conducted for the total population revealed that younger age (<70 versus 
≥90 years; HR: 1.21; 95% CI: 1.19-1.23; 71-80 years versus ≥90 years; HR: 1.13; 
95% CI: 1.11-1.14) was significantly associated with an increased risk of 
therapy discontinuation. Initiating therapy with memantine was associated with a 
slightly lower risk of discontinuation compared to donepezil (HR: 0.87; 95% CI: 
0.86-0.87).
CONCLUSION: In this study, half of the patients discontinued antidementia 
therapy within one year and 80% within five years. Younger age was linked to a 
higher risk of therapy discontinuation, while memantine therapy was associated 
with improved persistence, potentially reflecting better adherence among 
patients with more advanced dementia.

Inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome has emerged as a high potential treatment 
paradigm for the treatment of neuroinflammation, with demonstrated 
anti-neuroinflammatory effects in Parkinson's disease patients and a strong 
rationale in Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. To 
facilitate further progress in this field, brain penetrant NLRP3 inflammasome 
inhibitors as leads and tool compounds are required. We discovered a small 
molecule NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor, NT-0527 (11), and extensively profiled 
this to reveal a highly potent, selective and brain penetrant compound. This was 
shown to be orally bioavailable, efficacious in an in vivo model of 
inflammation, and with good developability characteristics. However, NT-0527 
exhibited CYP 2C19 time-dependent inhibition, which halted development, but this 
molecule could be employed as a valuable tool compound for the investigation of 
neuroinflammatory conditions where NLRP3 inflammasome activation is implicated.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the leading causes of dementia in the 
elderly, and no effective treatment is currently available. Cathepsin B (CTSB) 
is involved in key pathological processes of AD, but the underlying mechanisms 
and its relevance to AD diagnosis and treatment remain unclear. In the present 
study, we found that CTSB expression was abnormally elevated in the hippocampus 
of 3×Tg mice and was regulated by miR-96-5p. Abnormalities in the miR-96-5p/CTSB 
signaling pathway were detected in the serum of both mild cognitive impairment 
and AD patients, and the combination of serum miR-96-5p and CTSB demonstrated 
strong diagnostic efficacy for cognitive impairment (AUC = 0.7536). 
Abnormalities in the miR-96-5p/CTSB signaling pathway in AD may be associated 
with Aβ pathology, and neuronal CTSB can be released extracellularly to 
reactivate adjacent astrocytes. Ultimately, the reconstitution of the 
miR-96-5p/CTSB signaling pathway effectively rescued astrocyte reactivity and 
memory impairment in AD. Our findings suggest that the neuron-derived 
inflammatory mediator CTSB reactivates adjacent astrocytes and mediates memory 
impairment in early AD. The combination of serum miR-96-5p and CTSB represents 
potential serum biomarkers for cognitive impairment, and targeting the neuronal 
miR-96-5p/CTSB pathway may serve as a promising therapeutic strategy for AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) has become a great concern for society in general and 
clinicians specifically because of its high morbidity, relative lack of 
awareness of its characteristics, and low diagnosis and treatment rates. 
Worldwide, there is a lack of effective treatments for slowing the progression 
of AD in clinical practice. Thus, the management of patients in the preclinical 
phase of AD (PPAD) has been identified to be highly important for addressing 
this concern. PPAD is considered a preclinical manifestation of the early stages 
of AD and includes subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI). Developments in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology 
have led to its demonstration of great potential in the early identification and 
progression monitoring of PPAD. Thus, in this review, we summarized the 
concepts, principles and applications of structural and diffusion MRI in the 
identification of PPAD to provide potential imaging markers that can be used by 
clinicians in clinical practice.

Mild cognitive impairment progresses slowly and may be reversible, providing a 
window of opportunity for intervention before it progresses to Alzheimer's 
disease, at which point treatments, at best, ameliorate symptoms with little 
efficacy towards delaying disease progression. The gut and brain communicate 
through the gut-brain axis, and derangement of the gut microbiome has been shown 
to promote neuroinflammation, a process intricately linked to pathological 
progression to mild cognitive impairment and subsequent neurocognitive diseases. 
In preclinical trials, probiotics modulated the gut microbiome in a way that was 
neuroprotective. We aim to test our hypothesis that probiotic supplementation 
can improve cognition in those with mild cognitive impairment. A literature 
search of electronic databases PubMed/MEDLINE using terms such as "Probiotics" 
and "Cognitive dysfunction" or "Alzheimer's disease" or "Mild Cognitive 
Impairment" was done to identify all randomized controlled trials that tested 
our hypothesis. The effects of daily doses of Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, or 
a mixture of both on clinical cognitive tests were assessed in five trials. All 
studies but one demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in total 
cognitive test scores, while all studies showed a significant improvement over 
the placebo in at least one cognitive subdomain. An overall trend suggested 
greater improvement in those more severely impaired at baseline. Thus, 
probiotics may be effective in improving cognition in those with mild cognitive 
impairment. However, larger-scale multicenter clinical trials should confirm the 
present findings using a standardized approach.

Background Alzheimer's disease (AD) and epilepsy are neurological conditions 
that can affect elderly individuals. The coexistence of these two conditions may 
lead to additional health challenges and negatively impact patient outcomes. The 
study aimed to assess the prevalence of epilepsy among patients with AD in Saudi 
Arabia and to explore factors associated with its occurrence. Methods A 
cross-sectional retrospective study was conducted at King Abdulaziz Medical 
City, Riyadh, reviewing the records of patients with AD from 2016 to 2022. 
Patients with prior epilepsy or without a brain MRI were excluded. Data on 
demographics, comorbidities, medications, and imaging were analyzed. Results 
Among 385 patients (mean age 75.5 years) included in the study, epilepsy 
prevalence was 6%. Diabetes (82%), hypertension (78%), and hyperlipidemia (63%) 
were common but showed no significant association with epilepsy. Generalized 
brain atrophy was the most frequent MRI finding. Levetiracetam was the most 
prescribed antiepileptic drug (77%). Conclusion Epilepsy is more common among 
patients with AD than in the general population. Early recognition and 
management are crucial. Further research is needed to understand the risk 
factors and improve outcomes.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease 
among the elderly population. It has been posited that the onset and progression 
of AD are influenced by a combination of various factors. Occlusal support loss 
due to tooth loss has been reported to be a risk factor triggering cognitive 
dysfunction. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between tooth loss 
and cognitive dysfunction and illustrate the role of pyroptosis in advancing 
Alzheimer's disease.
METHODS: Male 5-month-old senescence-accelerated mouse strain P8 (SAMP8) mice 
were divided into two groups (n = 6): the S (sham-operated) and TL (tooth loss) 
groups. We assessed spatial memory ability using the Y-maze and Novel Object 
Recognition (NOR) tests. In addition, we performed pathological and molecular 
biological assessments of the hippocampus to evaluate pyroptosis-related 
indicators and changes in cGAS/STING. We further verified the correlation 
between the two in vitro.
RESULTS: The pathological section staining revealed an upregulation of GSDMD, a 
target protein of pyroptosis, and abnormal activation of the cGAS/STING pathway, 
particularly in microglia, after tooth loss. In vitro, we demonstrated that the 
BV2 microglia knockdown STING group improved the inflammatory cascade response 
and down-regulated the pyroptotic features.
DISCUSSION: These data suggest that the occlusal support loss due to tooth loss 
induces pyroptosis-related protein deposition, which may be intimately 
associated with the cGAS/STING signaling pathway. This provides new insights 
into the treatment and prevention of oral health and cognitive behavioural 
disorders in the elderly population.

4-Phenylbutyrate (4-PBA), initially recognized for treating urea cycle 
disorders, has emerged as a potent therapeutic agent with broad-spectrum 
potential. As a chemical chaperone, 4-PBA modulates protein folding and reduces 
endoplasmic reticulum stress. 4-PBA has demonstrated efficacy in treating ocular 
herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection and HSV-1-induced encephalitis, 
highlighting its potential as a novel anti-herpetic therapy. Beyond its 
antiviral properties, 4-PBA's therapeutic reach extends to neurological 
disorders linked to HSV-1 infection, including Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, 
Huntington's diseases, and primary open-angle glaucoma. Furthermore, 4-PBA shows 
promise in treating a diverse array of conditions beyond neurology. Its 
potential has been explored in atherosclerosis, Adriamycin-induced cardiac 
injury, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, rifamycin-induced liver injury, 
chronic kidney disease, diabetic nephropathy, NSAID-induced kidney injury, and 
chronic wound healing. This review synthesizes the multifaceted therapeutic 
potential of 4-PBA, emphasizing its role as a broad-spectrum agent capable of 
addressing a wide range of pathological conditions, particularly its role in 
combating HSV-1 and associated neurological disorders. The growing evidence 
suggests that 4-PBA may be a versatile and valuable addition to the therapeutic 
arsenal against multiple diseases.

Ten novel pyrazoline-thiazole derivatives were synthesized and assessed for 
their potential as acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitors. 
The structure of the target compounds was characterized by 1H NMR and 13C NMR, 
and purity was determined using HPLC. The in vitro enzyme inhibitory activity 
assays determined that compounds 3f (IC50 = 0.382 μM) and 3g (IC50 = 0.338 μM) 
showed good inhibitory activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Compound 3f has 
a selective inhibitory effect on AChE, while compound 3g has a dual effect, 
being effective against both AChE and BChE (IC50 = 2.087 μM). The molecular 
docking results of compound 3g with high inhibitory activity for AChE 
experimentally showed that it has a strong inhibitory effect close to that of 
the reference inhibitor tacrine. The compound 3g was found to have the highest 
activity in its interaction with the BChE (4BDS) protein with a low docking 
score (-5.555 kcal/mol). Furthermore, the prediction of ADME properties of 
compounds 3f and 3g was determined through Swiss ADME.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are the most prevalent 
neurodegenerative disorders characterized by continuous loss of functional 
neurons. The numbers of AD and PD patients will likely double by 2060 and 2040, 
reaching 13.9 and 1.2 million, respectively, in the US alone. Although both AD 
and PD are multifactorial in origin, the accumulation of misfolded proteins such 
as α-synuclein (α-syn) and tau contribute to nerve function disruption. 
Therefore, inhibition of α-syn and tau aggregation via small-molecule disruptors 
of oligomer and fibril formation presents a promising method for treating AD and 
PD. Coumarin scaffolds possess a wide range of bioactivities, particularly their 
antiamyloidogenic potential, which was explored in this study. Our previous work 
demonstrated that amide linkers and amino indole moieties have antioligomer and 
antifibrillar effects. This study involves coupling the coumarin scaffold with 
various aromatic moieties, including aminoindoles, methoxy-substituted phenyl, 
and polyhydroxy aromatic functionalities, via an amide linker for establishing 
the structural activity relationship (SAR) for the inhibition of oligomer and 
fibril formation. In total, 38 coumarin-based amide compounds were prepared to 
first explore the antifibrillar activity on recombinant α-syn. The best 
compounds were then tested to assess the antioligomer effects, tau aggregation 
activity, inclusion inhibition, and dimerization in cells. Biophysical methods 
such as thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence assays, photoinduced cross-linking of 
unmodified proteins (PICUP), survival assays, and electron microscopic 
observations were used to evaluate the inhibitory effects of analogs on α-syn 
and tau aggregation. The coumarin-amide-dihydroxybenzene derivatives 
demonstrated superior effects on the inhibition of α-syn aggregation when 
compared with the coumarin-amide-indole derivatives. The methoxy 
(nondemethylated) counterparts of compounds 13 and 17 failed at reducing α-syn 
fibril formation. The coumarin-amide-dihydroxybenzene derivatives 13 and 17, 
exhibited different degrees of inhibition on the α-syn oligomer and inclusion 
formation. Compound 13 inhibited tau (2N4R isoform) oligomer formation and 
reduced tau dimerization in a cell-based assay. In conclusion, the results 
presented herein will guide future optimization of molecules with inhibitory 
effects on prone-to-aggregate proteins and may pave the way for 
disease-modifying treatments for neurodegenerative disorders.

BACKGROUND: Understanding the neurological complications associated with 
diabetes mellitus is essential for developing comprehensive treatment 
strategies. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a powerful tool for 
investigating brain functional and structural changes associated with various 
conditions, including diabetes mellitus.
OBJECTIVES: To analyze the application trends, research hotspots, and emerging 
frontiers of fMRI in diabetes mellitus research through a comprehensive 
bibliometric analysis.
METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted utilizing the Web of 
Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database. Bibliometric tools, including 
VOSviewer (version 1.6.20), CiteSpace (version 6.3.R1), and R (version 4.3.3), 
were employed for data analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 706 articles about fMRI and diabetes mellitus were published 
from 1987 to 2024. The United States of America (USA) ranks first (n = 931), 
followed by China (n = 756) and Germany (n = 270) regarding total publications. 
Harvard University ranks first in terms of total publications. Among the top ten 
institutions regarding publications, the majority of articles originated from 
the USA. The journal Diabetes has the highest number of publications. The author 
SHAO YI ranks first in total publications, while FRITSCHE ANDREAS ranks first in 
total citations. The top five keywords identified are "dementia," "risk," 
"brain," "Alzheimer's disease," and "functional connectivity." Keyword burst 
analysis indicates that the recent research hotspots included "impairment," 
"dysfunction," and "diagnosis."
CONCLUSION: Cognitive impairment and dysfunction related to diabetes mellitus, 
along with Alzheimer's disease and dementia, and their diagnosis were identified 
as focal areas of research. Future investigations should concentrate on 
predicting and early diagnosing cognitive function in patients with diabetes 
mellitus using fMRI. The findings of this study provide a valuable reference for 
researchers and clinicians seeking to explore the neurological dimensions of 
diabetes mellitus and develop targeted therapeutic approaches.

This study provided a preliminary examination of indices of obstructive sleep 
apsnea (OSA) and sleep disruptions in adults with Down syndrome (DS), and their 
associations with Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology and symptomatology. A total 
of 93 adults with DS (aged 25-61 years) from the Alzheimer Biomarker 
Consortium-DS completed cognitive assessments, MRI and positron emission 
tomography (PET) scans (assessing amyloid-beta [Aβ] and tau), and a one-night 
home sleep study using the WatchPAT-300 device. Study partners also reported on 
depressive symptoms and diagnoses. Correlational analyses examined relationships 
between sleep variables, PET biomarkers, and AD symptomatology (cognitive 
functioning and depressive mood), controlling for sociodemographics. A total of 
81 participants (87 per cent) completed valid WatchPAT data. Of these, 60 
(74 per cent) screened positive for OSA, and an additional 11 had a prior OSA 
diagnosis and used CPAP during the test night. Nearly half (45 per cent) of 
those screening positive for OSA had no prior diagnosis, indicating 
under-detection. Among the 22 participants using OSA treatment, 50 per cent 
continued to show sleep-disordered breathing, suggesting suboptimal treatment 
effectiveness. Higher wake percentage and shorter total sleep time were 
associated with greater Aβ and tau burden. Cognitive performance was negatively 
associated with wake percentage, total sleep time, and oxygenation indices 
(minimum oxygen, desaturation, and time ≤ 88 per cent oxygen). Depressive 
symptoms were negatively related to total sleep time. These findings add 
preliminary evidence linking sleep disruption and OSA with AD-related pathology 
and symptomatology. Larger, longitudinal studies are needed to confirm these 
associations and evaluate whether improving sleep quality and treating OSA may 
help delay AD onset in this high-risk population.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Tau protein, which is crucial for sustaining the cytoskeletal 
network by assisting microtubule construction, contributes significantly to the 
pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The hyperphosphorylation of tau 
causes it to detach from microtubules (MTs), leading to the formation of 
neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in neurons, which ultimately results in cell 
death. Thionine (TH), a cationic phenothiazine-structured compound, has been the 
topic of extensive research due to its interesting physicochemical properties. 
It is a common biological dye, especially useful in histology due to its strong 
affinity for biological membranes. Furthermore, TH serves as a photosensitizer 
in phototherapy. It has a phenothiazine pharmacophore, which makes it selective 
against microbial and tumor cells. Our prior studies demonstrated that TH 
inhibits human plasma butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) by acting as a nonlinear 
inhibitor and also affects amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism in PS70 
cells. In the current research, we investigated whether TH modulates the 
phosphorylation of tau in N2a/APPSwe cells.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using flow cytometry, we identified the dose range and 
treatment time of TH that did not affect the viability of N2a/APPSwe cells. The 
western blot method was used to investigate the effects of TH on total tau and 
four key tau phosphorylation sites.
RESULTS: The results indicated that TH reduces tau phosphorylation at residues 
Ser202/Thr205, Ser396, Ser396/Ser404, and Thr181, which contribute to NFT 
formation.
CONCLUSION: When all these findings are evaluated together, TH may have a 
therapeutic potential against AD.

BACKGROUND: Early identification of pathological α-synuclein deposition (αSynD) 
may improve understanding of Lewy body disorder (LBD) progression and enable 
timely disease-modifying treatments.
OBJECTIVES: We investigated αSynD using a seed amplification assay and assessed 
prodromal LBD symptoms in individuals with idiopathic olfactory dysfunction 
(iOD).
METHODS: In this cross-sectional, case-control study, we included iOD 
participants and normosmic healthy controls (HC) aged 55 to 75 years without 
diagnoses of dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson's disease (PD), or other major 
neurological disorders. iOD was defined as hyposmia without any known causes. 
The primary outcome was αSynD detection in skin and olfactory mucosa. Secondary 
outcomes included prodromal LBD symptoms: cognitive dysfunction, rapid eye 
movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD), motor and nonmotor symptoms (Movement 
Disorders Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale [MDS-UPDRS] Parts 
I-III), and prodromal PD risk.
RESULTS: We recruited 44 iOD participants (mean age 65) and 50 HCs (mean age 
67). Eighteen iOD participants (41%) were αSynD positive in skin and/or 
olfactory mucosa compared to 1 HC (2%, P < 0.0001). iOD participants had higher 
rates of cognitive dysfunction (48% vs. 24%, P = 0.02), possible RBD (41% vs. 
16%, P = 0.01), and elevated MDS-UPDRS I-III (median [interquartile range]: 15 
[7-22] vs. 5.5 [3-11], P < 0.0001). Dysautonomia symptoms did not differ 
significantly. In the iOD group, 45% met probable/possible prodromal PD criteria 
versus 1 control (P < 0.0001). However, αSynD-αSynD-negative iOD participants 
had a nonsignificantly higher prodromal PD risk compared to αSynD-positive 
individuals.
CONCLUSIONS: iOD exhibits high αSynD prevalence and prodromal LBD symptoms, 
supporting its role as an early LBD marker and potential model for early 
intervention and mechanistic studies.

Neurodegenerative disorders (NDD) i.e., dementia of the Alzheimer's type, 
Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis are 
a rising worldwide epidemic driven by aging populations and characterized by 
progressive neuronal impairment. In the face of symptomatic therapies, 
disease-modifying treatments are beyond reach, for many years, at least, owing 
to the multifactorial origin, including protein aggregation, oxidative stress, 
neuroinflammation, and neurotransmitter dysregulation. Here, we point out 
thiophene, a five-membered heterocyclic sulfur-containing scaffold, as an 
underinvestigated but highly versatile pharmacophore with great potential in 
therapeutics of NDD. Here, we provide a systematic review of thiophene 
derivatives identified between 2006 and 2024, highlighting that these compounds 
are capable of modulating the aggregation of amyloid-β, inhibiting 
acetylcholinesterase, alleviating oxidative stress, inhibiting the toxicity of 
α-synuclein, and restoring neurotransmitter homeostasis. Specific emphasis is 
placed on their structural malleability, blood-brain barrier penetrability, and 
multi-targeting, which collectively present advantages over traditional 
heterocyclic templates. Progress in the areas of structure-activity relationship 
(SAR)-motivated design, synthetic methods, molecular docking, and preclinical 
assessment is reviewed, leading to the establishment of lead thiophene scaffolds 
with micro or nanomolar-range activity. This review also provides future 
directions, such as the requirement of pharmacokinetic improvement, target 
verification, and translational research to bridge preclinical discoveries with 
clinical utility. This article collectively places thiophene derivatives as an 
innovative chemical platform for the design of next-generation drugs for 
neurodegenerative diseases.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by 
progressive cognitive impairment and neuronal loss, with pathological hallmarks 
including Aβ plaque deposition and tau tangles. At present, the early diagnosis 
and treatment of AD still face great challenges, such as limited diagnostic 
methods, difficulty in blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration, complex disease 
mechanisms, and lack of highly effective targeted therapies. Antibody drugs have 
shown broad prospects in the field of AD due to their high specificity, 
engineering and multifunctional therapeutic potential, include targeted Aβ 
clearance, tau pathological regulation, imaging probes, and blood biomarkers. In 
the future, with the development of antibody engineering technologies (such as 
PROTAC-antibody conjugates and antibody-based gene therapies), the precision 
diagnosis and treatment of AD is expected to usher in new breakthroughs. This 
article systematically reviews the latest advances in the treatment and 
diagnosis of AD and discusses their potential for clinical translation.

A serine/threonine kinase with a wide variety of substrates, Glycogen Synthase 
Kinase-3 (GSK-3) is widely expressed. GSK-3 is a key player in cell metabolism 
and signaling, modulating numerous cellular functions and playing significant 
roles in both healthy and diseased states. The two histopathological features of 
Alzheimer's disease, the intracellular neurofibrillary tangles composed of 
hyperphosphorylated tau, and the extracellular senile plaques composed of 
beta-amyloid, have been linked to GSK-3. It alters multiple tau protein 
locations found in neurofibrillary tangles. Additionally, GSK-3 can react to 
this peptide and regulate the production of beta-amyloid. The overexpression of 
GSK-3 in several transgenic models has been linked to tau hyperphosphorylation, 
neuronal death, and a reduction in cognitive function. It has been shown that 
lithium, a medication commonly used to treat affective disorders, inhibits GSK-3 
at therapeutically relevant concentrations and stops tau phosphorylation. In 
this review, we provide an overview of the most recent research on the potential 
of GSK-3 inhibitors for treating Alzheimer's disease.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by cognitive impairment, synaptic dysfunction, and neuronal loss. 
Neuroinflammation, driven by the activation of microglia and astrocytes, is a 
key contributor to AD pathology, amplifying oxidative stress and amyloid-β 
toxicity. Modulation of neuroinflammatory pathways thus represents a promising 
therapeutic strategy. In this study, we evaluated the effects of a food-grade 
hempseed protein hydrolysate (HPH20A) on hippocampal inflammation and glial 
activation in a scopolamine-induced mouse model of AD. Mice were orally 
supplemented with HPH20A (10 mg/kg/day) for 12 weeks. Hippocampal tissue was 
analyzed by RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry to assess the expression of glial 
and inflammatory markers. To identify peptides capable of reaching the brain, we 
employed a double transwell in vitro system simulating intestinal and 
blood-brain barrier (BBB) transport, followed by LC-TIMS-MS/MS peptidomics, in 
silico bioactivity prediction, and molecular docking. HPH20A supplementation 
significantly attenuated the expression of pro-inflammatory markers, including 
GFAP, IBA1, TREM2, CD68, iNOS, COX2, and IL-6, and increased the 
anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Peptidomic analysis identified two peptides, 
NVDTELAHKL and DSETVKRL, consistently present across intestinal, systemic, and 
brain compartments. These peptides were predicted to exhibit anti-inflammatory 
activity and demonstrated high-affinity binding to AD-related targets (APP, 
TREM2, and AChE) in docking simulations. Taken together, these findings suggest 
that HPH20A exerts neuroprotective effects by modulating hippocampal 
inflammation inflammation, potentially through specific bioactive peptides 
capable of crossing the BBB. Our results support the potential of 
hempseed-derived peptides as dietary modulators of neuroinflammation in early 
stages of neurodegenerative disease.

PURPOSE: Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) lose the ability to manage their 
medications as the disease progresses. Several methods have been used to 
administer medication to patients at home using Internet of Things (IoT) devices 
for rehabilitation, but no studies have yet been published investigating the 
factors that influence the success or failure of this approach in older adults 
and patients with AD. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate differences in 
medication-related behaviors and their influencing factors in older adults, both 
with and without AD, using IoT.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study population consisted of 57 patients in the AD 
group and 34 older adults in the non-AD one, The AD group consisted mainly of 
patients with mild disease. Both groups conducted a medication management 
experiment using medication management applications delivered through either 
"Arata" or "Skype", and their behaviors and influencing factors were examined.
RESULTS: Operational errors were observed in both groups. Influencing factors 
that were common to both "Arata" and "Skype" were comprehension of spoken 
language and prospective memory. The influencing factors that differed were 
disorientation and attention.

INTRODUCTION: Risperidone is approved for behaviors and psychological symptoms 
of dementia (BPSD), despite modest efficacy and known risks. Identifying 
responsive symptoms, treatment modifiers, and predictors is crucial for 
personalized treatment.
METHOD: A one-stage individual participant data meta-analysis of six randomized 
controlled trials (risperidone: n = 1009; placebo: N = 712) was conducted. 
Mixed-effects models assessed treatment effects, modifiers, and predictors, with 
BPSD measured via the Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease scale.
RESULTS: Risperidone showed modest 8 week benefits for aggression (standardized 
mean difference [SMD]: -0.22; p < 0.001), psychosis (SMD: -0.23; p = 0.001), and 
anxiety/phobias (SMD: -0.19; p = 0.014), but not for activity, affective, or 
sleep disturbances. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic-related factors (e.g., body 
mass index, endocrine disease, race/ethnicity) potentially modified treatment 
effects. Week 2 response predicted week 8 improvement (odds ratio: 4.46; 
p < 0.001).
DISCUSSION: Risperidone provided symptom-specific benefits in reducing 
aggression, psychosis, and anxiety/phobias. Week 2 response predicted treatment 
outcomes, while certain patient characteristics may modify treatment response. 
Further research is needed to optimize the benefit-risk balance and 
individualize treatment.
HIGHLIGHTS: Risperidone modestly reduces symptoms of psychosis, aggression, and 
anxiety/phobias. Risperidone shows no effect on activity, affective, or sleep 
disturbances. Patient factors (body mass index, endocrine disease, 
race/ethnicity) may affect response. Positive response by week 2 predicts 
significant improvement later.

Under physiological conditions, amyloid precursor protein (APP) is critically 
important for normal brain development, neurogenesis, neuronal survival, and 
synaptic signaling. Dyshomeostasis of APP increases deposition and accumulation 
of amyloid β (Aβ) in the brain parenchyma and cerebral blood vessels thereby 
leading to development of Alzheimer's disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. 
In this review, we critically examine existing literature supporting the concept 
that endothelial APP performs important vascular protective functions in the 
brain. Studies in cultured human brain microvascular endothelium and cerebral 
arteries derived from genetically modified mice indicate that loss of APP 
impairs expression and function of Krüppel-like Factor 2 (KLF2) and endothelial 
nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) thereby causing endothelial dysfunction. Congruency 
between the findings obtained in murine and human cerebrovascular endothelium is 
consistent with strong evolutionary conservation of APP, and reinforces the 
concept that APP is an important vascular protective protein. Furthermore, we 
highlight vascular protective effects of APP during aging. We also address the 
roles of endothelial prostacyclin and nitric oxide in control of expression and 
proteolytic cleavage of APP. Finally, we outline potential translational 
opportunities emerging from recent advances in understanding of cerebrovascular 
function of APP. Several pharmacologically active domains of APP have been 
identified thus providing templates for creation of novel peptides with 
therapeutic properties.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Gastrodia elata, also known as Chijian, belongs 
to the Orchidaceae family of plants. The "Compendium of Materia Medica" records 
that Gastrodia elata treats "confused speech, excessive fear, and loss of 
willpower". Gastrodin (GAS) is the main bioactive component of Gastrodia elata. 
Research has shown that GAS possesses protective effects on multiple animal 
models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the exact molecular mechanism of 
GAS-mediated neuroprotection in AD pathology remains unclear.
AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aims to determine whether GAS exerts 
neuroprotective effects on AD models through regulating β-catenin/c-Myc/MCT2 
signaling axis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Behavioral and histopathological tests, including Morris 
water maze test, Nissl staining, and NeuN immunofluorescence staining in 
3 × Tg-AD male mice, were used to assess the pharmacological effect of GAS on 
AD. To investigate the neuroprotective mechanisms of GAS, we established an in 
vitro AD model using Aβ25-35-treated HT22 cells. The expressions of proteins and 
mRNA related to the β-catenin/c-Myc signaling axis were determined by western 
blotting and quantitative PCR. The change in energy metabolism was evaluated by 
measuring pyruvate, cellular ATP production, and mitochondrial membrane 
potential (MMP). The molecular mechanism of GAS-mediated neuroprotection was 
further explored using pharmacological and genetic interventions targeting 
β-catenin and c-Myc. Transcriptional regulation was interrogated through 
β-catenin chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled with JASPAR-based motif 
prediction, while ligand-receptor interactions were characterized by 
AutoDock-based molecular docking validated through drug affinity responsive 
target stability (DARTS) assay and cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA).
RESULTS: In vivo experimental results revealed that GAS ameliorated cognitive 
impairment in 3 × Tg-AD mice, attenuated neuronal damage, and markedly inhibited 
the downregulation of active-β-catenin, c-Myc, and MCT2 in the hippocampal 
tissues. In Aβ25-35-challenged HT22 cells, the relevant protein levels of 
β-catenin/c-Myc signaling axis were reduced, with both mRNA and protein 
expressions of MCT2 declining, alongside reductions in pyruvate and ATP 
concentrations. GAS treatment reversed these pathological alterations, while 
this effect was antagonized by β-catenin and c-Myc inhibitors. Additionally, 
lentiviral-mediated β-catenin overexpression markedly increased MCT2 mRNA and 
protein expression in HT22 cells. The results of chromatin immunoprecipitation 
assay coupled with quantitative PCR and JASPAR-based motif prediction revealed 
that β-catenin bound to the MCT2 promoter region. Autodock Vina simulation 
demonstrated that GAS binds to β-catenin with a binding energy of less than 
-5 kcal/mol. Both DARTS and CETSA experiments showed that the binding of GAS to 
β-catenin protects the β-catenin protein from degradation.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that GAS plays a protective role in 
experimental AD models through enhancing MCT2 expression and improving 
mitochondrial energy metabolism function by activation of the 
β-catenin/c-Myc/MCT2 signaling axis.

Despite extensive research into Alzheimer's disease (AD), few therapeutic 
strategies have successfully addressed its core pathology at the synaptic level. 
Small peptides represent a promising class of therapeutic agents capable of 
modulating key molecular pathways involved in amyloid toxicity, tau 
hyperphosphorylation, and synaptic degeneration. Their unique ability to cross 
biological barriers, interact with intracellular targets, and be modified for 
enhanced stability positions them as viable candidates for next-generation 
treatments targeting cognitive decline in AD.Small peptides show strong 
therapeutic potential yet face challenges in clinical application due to poor 
bioavailability and rapid enzymatic degradation. To deal with these limitations, 
various delivery strategies such as intranasal administration, nanoparticle 
encapsulation, and chemical modification have been developed. When combined with 
advanced delivery systems, small peptides hold significant promise for 
mitigating synaptic dysfunction and slowing the progression of Alzheimer's 
disease. In this review, we examine the mechanisms of action of four small 
peptides that demonstrate potential in alleviating Alzheimer's-related symptoms. 
We also evaluate the most effective delivery methods, emphasizing how these 
approaches enhance the peptides' therapeutic efficacy.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents a growing global health burden, underscoring 
the urgent need for reliable diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Although 
several disease-modifying treatments have recently become available, their 
effects remain limited, as they primarily delay rather than halt disease 
progression. Thus, the early and accurate identification of individuals at 
elevated risk for conversion to AD dementia is crucial to maximize the 
effectiveness of these therapies and to facilitate timely intervention 
strategies. Baseline plasma concentrations of amyloid beta 40 (Aβ40), amyloid 
beta 42 (Aβ42), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neurofilament light 
chain (NFL), and tau phosphorylated at residue 181 and 217 (pTau181, pTau217) 
were quantified in 233 non-demented participants from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and followed for up to 11 years. Covariates 
included demographic variables and neuropsychological measures. Longitudinal 
cognitive trajectories were modelled with linear mixed-effects models (LMM), and 
the risk of progression to AD dementia was evaluated with logistic regression 
and Cox proportional-hazards analyses. Longitudinally, higher baseline plasma 
levels of GFAP, NFL, pTau181, and pTau217 independently predicted steeper 
cognitive decline. Cross-sectional analyses demonstrated significant 
associations of pTau217, pTau181, and Aβ42 with baseline memory impairment. A 
logistic regression model incorporating five plasma biomarkers-Aβ42, GFAP, NFL, 
pTau181, and pTau217-demonstrated robust predictive accuracy for discrimination 
of future converters to AD dementia. The addition of demographic variables and a 
baseline memory score further improved model specificity and positive predictive 
value. These findings support the utility of a concise plasma biomarker panel 
comprising Aβ42, GFAP, NFL, pTau181, and pTau217 for predicting both 
longitudinal cognitive deterioration and conversion to AD dementia. This 
less-invasive blood-based panel could serve as a practical triage tool to enrich 
clinical trials and facilitate timely therapeutic interventions with emerging 
disease-modifying treatments.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is marked by amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaque buildup, tau 
hyperphosphorylation, neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and impaired adult 
hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN). Taurine has shown protective effects in various 
cellular and animal models of AD, though the molecular mechanisms of free 
taurine and its effects in patient-derived models remain underexplored. This 
study evaluates taurine's therapeutic potential using integrated in silico, in 
vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo approaches. In vitro aggregation assays revealed 
that taurine (10-100 μM) inhibited Aβ42 fibril formation, with transmission 
electron microscopy showing looser, amorphous fibrils, particularly at higher 
doses. Computational simulations further supported that taurine binds stably to 
Aβ peptide fragments and facilitates the dissociation of Aβ dimers. In HT22 
cells, taurine protected against Aβ-induced cytotoxicity. In 5XFAD mice, oral 
administration of taurine (1000 mg/kg, 4 weeks) significantly reduced Aβ 
accumulation and hyperphosphorylation of tau at Ser202/Thr205 in the dorsal 
subiculum. Furthermore, taurine attenuated microgliosis, as evidenced by 
decreased Iba-1 immunoreactivity, protected against neurodegeneration 
demonstrated by preserving NeuN-positive neurons, and ameliorated deficit of AHN 
shown by increasing DCX-positive cells in the subgranular zone of the dentate 
gyrus. Importantly, in cerebral organoids derived from an AD patient carrying 
the APOE ε4/ε4 genotype, taurine treatment attenuated Aβ accumulation, decreased 
tau phosphorylation. These findings highlight taurine's multi-target therapeutic 
potential targeting amyloid aggregation, tau pathology, neuroinflammation and 
neurogenesis. Our data support taurine emerges as a promising therapeutic 
candidate for AD.

This narrative review explores current pharmacological treatments for agitation 
in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Agitation, a common and difficult-to-manage symptom 
in AD, often requires targeted intervention. While nonpharmacological methods, 
such as behavioral therapy and environmental modifications, are considered first 
line, they may not always be effective. In cases where these approaches fail, 
pharmacological treatment can become a necessary component of care. 
Historically, antipsychotics have been the mainstay of pharmacological treatment 
for agitation in AD; however, safety and efficacy concerns have prompted 
exploration into alternative treatments. The purpose of this narrative review is 
to synthesize current literature on pharmacological treatments for agitation in 
AD with a focus on new and repurposed drugs. It also examines agents that have 
failed to demonstrate clinical benefit, offering insights into the ongoing 
challenges of drug development in this area. This review synthesizes recent 
findings on various drug classes, including anticonvulsants, antipsychotics, 
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), atypical antidepressants, 
sedatives, anti-dementia drugs, dextromethorphan, and cannabinoids. Both 
brexpiprazole and risperidone have demonstrated efficacy and received approval 
from government agencies, including brexpiprazole in the USA and risperidone in 
parts of Europe. Despite these advances, concerns remain regarding their 
long-term use and safety profiles. As a result, multiple other therapies are 
currently being studied as possible alternative solutions. However, no other 
pharmacological agents are currently approved, underscoring the need for further 
research on safe and effective options for this vulnerable population.

BACKGROUND: Lead (Pb) exposure is recognized for its contribution to the 
development of neurodegenerative diseases. However, the precise mechanisms 
underlying Pb-induced neurological dysfunction remain elusive. This study aimed 
to investigate the role of oxidative stress and the autophagy-related P62/kelch 
like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1)/Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 
2 (Nrf2) pathway in neuronal impairment caused by Pb.
METHODS: By employing both in vivo and in vitro approaches, we explored the 
involvement of the P62/Nrf2/Keap1 pathway in Pb-induced neurotoxicity.
RESULTS: Our findings demonstrated that Pb exposure triggers excessive 
production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), upregulates Keap1 protein 
expressions, promotes Nrf2 degradation, and inhibits expression of antioxidant 
proteins such as heme Oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), 
resulting in oxidative damage in neurons. Furthermore, we observed that the 
autophagy protein P62 disrupts the normal autophagy process by interacting with 
the Nrf2/Keap1 axis, leading to an accumulation of Tau, a protein associated 
with Alzheimer's disease (AD), ultimately resulting in neurodegeneration. 
However, treatment with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine, Nrf2 activator 
Artemisitene, and autophagy activator Rapamycin attenuated these detrimental 
changes.
CONCLUSION: The P62/Nrf2/Keap1 pathway mediates Pb-induced neuronal dysfunction 
and highlights its potential as a therapeutic target for mitigating the 
neurodegenerative effects associated with Pb exposure.

BACKGROUND: AR1001 is a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor that produces improved 
cognitive performance and reduces amyloid-β and phosphorylated tau burdens in 
preclinical models of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of AR1001 in participants with 
mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD).
DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial conducted at 
21 sites in the United States.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged 55-80 years with mild-to-moderate dementia as 
determined by National Institutes of Aging-Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) 
stage 4 or 5 and Mini-mental State Exam (MMSE) score 16-26.
INTERVENTION: Once daily oral administration of placebo, 10 mg AR1001, or 30 mg 
AR1001 for 26 weeks followed by 26 weeks optional extension.
MEASUREMENTS: Co-primary efficacy endpoints were changes from baseline at Week 
26 in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog 13) and 
Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Clinical Global Impression of Change 
(ADCS-CGIC). Secondary endpoints included measures of cognition, daily living, 
and depression. Levels of plasma biomarkers pTau-181, pTau-217, Aβ42/40 ratio, 
glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light chain (NfL) were 
also examined.
RESULTS: A total of 210 participants were enrolled and 82% completed 26 weeks of 
treatment. AR1001 10 mg and 30 mg were well-tolerated with a similar safety 
profile compared to placebo. After 26 weeks, there were no differences in 
ADAS-Cog13, ADCS-CGIC, or in secondary efficacy endpoints between groups. Levels 
of plasma biomarkers pTau-181, pTau-217, and GFAP were improved in the 30 mg 
AR1001 group compared to placebo.
CONCLUSION: AR1001 was safe and well tolerated. Although primary efficacy 
endpoints were not met after 26 weeks of treatment, participants receiving 30 mg 
AR1001 showed favorable changes in AD-related plasma biomarkers compared to 
placebo.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia with a complex 
pathobiology. The clinically approved treatments against AD attempt to provide 
only symptomatic relief. Therefore, the current findings highlighted the 
neuroprotective effect and the potential signaling mechanism of quinic acid (1) 
and its amide derivatives (2-4) against phytohaemagglutinin (PHA)-induced 
neurotoxicity. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide 
(MTT) assay was conducted to assess the proliferative potential of 1-4 which 
were observed to increase the viability of SH-SY5Y cells. Microscopic 
examination of the cells induced with PHA and post treated with the respective 
test compound showed that 1 as well as its derivatives (2-4) improved morphology 
of the cells and subside the toxic effects of PHA. Evaluation of reactive oxygen 
species (ROS) production demonstrated that the test compounds except 4 decreased 
PHA-induced ROS in SH-SY5Y cells. The mRNA expression analysis of IL-1β, TNF-α, 
p38-α, p38-β and the disease associated ADAM10 and BACE1 genes revealed that 1 
and its derivatives (2-4) reduced the PHA-induced elevated levels of 
inflammatory molecules whereas the compounds did not positively modulate the 
expression of proteolytic secretases. Moreover, the compounds reduced the 
disease specific increased expression of amyloid beta (Aβ), phosphorylated tau 
and activated p38 MAPK observed through fluorescence microscopy.

This study systematically investigated the association between triclosan (TCS) 
exposure and Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk via integrated bioinformatics 
approaches. TCS-AD-related genes were identified using bioinformatics tools and 
public databases, followed by the screening of key genes through multi-model 
machine learning algorithms (LASSO, SVM-RFE, RF) to mitigate random errors in 
small sample sizes. DRD2 was confirmed as the most robust core gene by LASSO 
confidence interval analysis and SHAP evaluation, while APP and SLC6A3 were 
validated through cross-method intersection. Findings from functional enrichment 
analysis, Mendelian randomization, and molecular docking demonstrated that TCS 
may affect AD pathogenesis through these key genes. Moreover, a stable AD risk 
scoring model and predictive formula were developed via logistic regression 
analysis of T-A-Key Genes. This study constitutes an innovative and 
transformative research endeavor. Building upon the understanding of TCS-induced 
neurotoxicity, it extends to the clinical translational direction of predicting 
AD onset risk, thereby establishing a quantitative association model of 
"environmental exposure-core genes-disease risk. " It not only provides novel 
evidence for the potential role of TCS neurotoxicity as an environmental 
pathogenic factor in AD, emphasizing the necessity of prioritizing risk 
management of daily chemical exposure in AD prevention and treatment, but also 
offers a scientific foundation for the formulation of public health policies 
aimed at preventing long-term TCS exposure.

The G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent one of the most 
pharmacologically targeted classes of seven-transmembrane (7TM) receptors, 
identified through whole genome sequencing of humans. GPCRs transduce 
extracellular stimuli and signals into intracellular responses, enabling precise 
cellular communication for physiology and homeostasis. Given their ability to 
sense a variety of ligands, GPCRs regulate a plethora of physiological 
functions, such as sensory perception, hormonal regulation and metabolism, 
growth and development, cardiovascular and reproductive regulation. GPCRs also 
orchestrate immune responses, triggering a balanced pro- and anti-inflammatory 
signaling, which is linked to the development, differentiation, and regulation 
of B-cells that are responsible for the secretion of infection-fighting 
antibodies. However, an imbalance in inflammatory signaling is also linked to 
disruption of B-cell differentiation, leading to autoimmune diseases due to 
increased levels of autoantibodies. Additionally, GPCRs modulate 
neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity, influencing behaviour, mood, and 
cognitive functions. Due to their diverse functionality, ∼40 % of FDA-approved, 
currently marketed drugs are reported to target different GPCRs for therapeutic 
benefit. A focal point of this review is GPCR-driven neuroinflammation, 
particularly in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's 
disease, including others. The review highlights the contribution of the pro- 
and anti-inflammatory GPCRs in modulating the disease pathophysiology, including 
the existing and emerging therapies. It also provides a future roadmap for 
alternative drug discovery for suppressing neuroinflammation-mediated 
neurodegenerative disease.

Parkinson's Disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disease after 
Alzheimer's disease, is clinically characterized by resting tremor, rigidity and 
postural balance disorder. Its pathological essence is the progressive 
degenerative death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta 
(SNpc), leading to a significant decrease in striatal dopamine (DA) levels. This 
results in the dysfunction of basal ganglia-thalamus-cortex (BGTC) circuit. This 
circuit is the core neural circuit of motor control, and its abnormality not 
only directly causes the motor symptoms of PD, but also participates in the 
cascade of disease progression through the disorder of neurotransmitter signals. 
At present, DA replacement therapy and DA receptors (DARs) agonists are still 
the main methods of clinical treatment, but single therapy cannot fully correct 
the imbalance of other neurotransmitter systems, which has significant 
limitations in long-term efficacy and symptom management. G protein-coupled 
receptors (GPCRs), as the largest family of membrane proteins, have become 
important targets for PD treatment due to their extensive participation in 
physiological regulatory networks and excellent drug development potential. 
These transmembrane signaling molecules play important roles in multiple key 
nodes in the pathological process of PD by precisely regulating the release of 
neurotransmitters, the maintenance of synaptic plasticity and the dynamic 
balance of neural circuits. Here, we review the transition of BGTC in the 
context of PD and then focus on the pathological cascade of GPCRs mediating PD 
in this loop. Finally, we update the clinical trials or approvals of GPCR drugs 
under investigation for the treatment of PD.

BACKGROUND: The protein neurofilament light chain in blood (bNfL) has become a 
valuable biomarker in the diagnosis, monitoring, and prognosis of neurological 
diseases. However, its potential use beyond neurology in routine clinical 
practice remains unexplored. This study aimed to examine the clinical utility of 
bNfL by investigating its expanding use (i) assessing its integration into in- 
and outpatient routine practice, (ii) both within and outside of academic 
hospitals, and (iii) across different medical disciplines and various 
departments.
METHODS: This study examined data from two large clinical chemistry laboratories 
that provide bNfL measurements for the clinical routine: Labor Berlin, Germany, 
and the Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory at Sahlgrenska University Hospital, 
Sweden. Together, this large-scale retrospective study acquired data on bNfL 
measurements from n = 22,122 individuals during the years 2021 to 2023.
RESULTS: Our findings revealed that (i) outpatient clinics and (ii) non-academic 
healthcare settings are gradually integrating bNfL into their routine practice 
and (iii) its use has expanded across an increasing number of medical 
disciplines over time, indicating its growing importance as a diagnostic tool, 
beyond neurology. Notably, departments such as cardiology, hematology/oncology 
and intensive care units increasingly incorporated bNfL into their clinical 
repertoire.
DISCUSSION: This study underscores the developing impact of easily accessible 
bNfL on clinical routine, not only enhancing neurologists' diagnostic tools but 
also offering valuable insights into diverse medical fields, in- and outside the 
academic environment.

INTRODUCTION: Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) may contribute to 
Alzheimer's pathology at early disease stages. GFAP moderation of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD)-related neurodegeneration and cognition is unclear.
METHODS: We examined plasma GFAP moderation of AD biomarkers (amyloid beta 
[Aβ]-positron emission tomography [PET][A]; plasma phosphorylated tau-181 
[p-tau181][T1]), neurodegeneration (plasma NfL[Nplasma]; structural magnetic 
resonance imaging [MRI][NMRI]), and cognition (Cogmemory; Cogexecutive) in two 
cohorts: University of California San Francisco (UCSF) (N = 212, 91.0% 
non-Hispanic/Latino White [NHLW], age = 74.7 [7.6] years, 75.9% cognitively 
unimpaired [CU]) and 1Florida Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers (1FLADRC; 
N = 582, 32.8% NHLW, age = 70.7 [8.5] years, 28.9% CU).
RESULTS: Plasma GFAP consistently moderated A-T1 (UCSF: β = 0.46, p = 0.012; 
1FLADRC: β = 0.12, p = 0.029). The association between elevated Aβ-PET and 
increased (p-tau) was strengthened at higher GFAP concentrations. In 1FLADRC, 
GFAP moderated T1-Nplasma/MRI. In UCSF, GFAP moderated T1-Cogmemory/executive 
and NMRI-Cogmemory/executive. Higher GFAP consistently related to worse 
neurodegeneration and cognition (main effects).
DISCUSSION: Across demographically and clinically heterogeneous cohorts, plasma 
GFAP is a key moderator of AD and may help identify individuals at greatest risk 
of AD-related neurodegeneration and cognitive decline.
HIGHLIGHTS: AD biomarkers were measured in two demographically and clinically 
distinct cohorts. Plasma GFAP moderated Aβ-PET to p-tau associations in both 
UCSF and 1FLADRC. Cohort-dependent, GFAP moderated p-tau to neurodegeneration 
and cognition associations. All moderations revealed strengthened disease 
associations with higher plasma GFAP. Plasma GFAP may help identify individuals 
at greatest risk of AD-related decline.

INTRODUCTION: Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) is a reliable and 
clinically meaningful composite for assessing treatment effects in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) clinical trials. Small CDR-SB differences at the end of a trial 
often lead to controversy in deriving clinically meaningful interpretations.
METHODS: We estimated progression-free time (PFT) participants remained at each 
0.5 unit CDR-SB increment in dominantly inherited AD (DIAD) and sporadic AD 
populations, evaluating its potential as an alternative measure of treatment 
effects.
RESULTS: PFT is longer at CDR-SB ≤ 2.0 (1-2 years) and shorter at CDR-SB ≥ 5 (≤ 
0.33) in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort. The DIAD cohort 
showed similar but shorter times. Using PFT, continuous lecanemab treatment for 
3 years is estimated to delay disease progression by 0.62 years in the sporadic 
population.
DISCUSSION: PFT provides a benchmark for expressing clinical progression and 
treatment effects and can be applied particularly during open-label extensions 
and single-arm trials without placebo comparisons.
HIGHLIGHTS: We estimated the progression-free time at each 0.5 unit Clinical 
Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes increment in dominantly inherited Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) and sporadic AD populations. We proposed using progression-free 
time to estimate treatment effects in open-label extension or single-arm 
studies. If further validated, progression-free time could serve as a benchmark 
for assessing clinical progression and treatment effects.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder categorized by the 
progressive loss of cognitive function, with acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and 
butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) as key therapeutic targets. In this study, we 
report the isolation, characterization, and evaluation of the cholinesterase 
inhibitory potential of phytochemicals from Fernandoa adenophylla (Wall. ex G. 
Don) Steenis, a plant known for its medicinal properties. Using in-vitro enzyme 
inhibition assays, we identified five bioactive compounds, including lapachol 
(1), α-lapachone (2), peshawaraquinone (3), dehydro-α-lapachone (4), and an 
indanone derivative (5), which demonstrated significant inhibition of AChE and 
BuChE. The compounds exhibited varied inhibitory potency, with peshawaraquinone 
(3) showing the most promising AChE (IC50 = 0.90 ± 0.04 µM) and BuChE 
(IC50 = 8.39 ± 0.14 µM) inhibition, followed by dehydro-α-lapachone (4), which 
exhibited an AChE IC50 value of 2.64 ± 0.08 µM. Further, the selectivity index 
(SI) for AChE over BuChE was highest for dehydro-α-lapachone (SI = 21.1), 
suggesting its potential as a selective inhibitor. Molecular docking studies 
provided insights into the binding interactions between these compounds and the 
enzyme active sites, highlighting key interactions that may contribute to their 
inhibitory activity. These findings suggest that phytochemicals from F. 
adenophylla possess significant cholinesterase inhibition potential and may 
serve as leads for the development of novel therapeutic agents for Alzheimer's 
disease.

The development of drugs for Alzheimer's disease, which accounts for over half 
of all dementia cases, remains challenging. Amyloid β 1-42 (Aβ42) is widely 
recognized for its deposition in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's 
disease. Furthermore, Aβ42-induced cell toxicity likely plays a role in disease 
onset. Molecular species present in the early stages, such as monomers and 
oligomers, are appropriate therapeutic targets for suppressing amyloid fibril 
formation and cell toxicity. In this study, we investigated the effects of 
bovine fibrinogen (bFg) and human fibrinogen (hFg) since these molecules have 
been known to exhibit chaperone-like activities. Our findings indicate that bFg 
exerts a strong inhibitory effect on amyloid fibril formation. Dot blot assays, 
analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) suggest 
that bFg interacts with both Aβ42 monomers and oligomers. In contrast, human 
fibrinogen (hFg), which interacts only with oligomers, exhibits a weaker 
inhibitory effect on amyloid fibril formation. Moreover, bFg significantly 
rescued cells from Aβ42-induced toxicity, whereas hFg provided only partial 
protection. These findings underscore the potential of molecules targeting early 
stage Aβ42 species as promising candidates for Alzheimer's disease treatment.

Neuroendocrine Carcinomas.

Seizure-related homolog protein 6 (SEZ6) is a cell surface type 1 transmembrane 
protein involved in neuronal development, expression of which in adult tissues 
is almost exclusively limited to the central nervous system. Aberrant expression 
of SEZ6 has been associated with neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders 
including epilepsy, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease. More recently, SEZ6 
overexpression has been detected in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and other 
high-grade neuroendocrine malignancies, although our understanding of the 
function of SEZ6 as a driver of cancer is limited. A lineage-defining 
transcription factor of SCLC, ASCL1, has been implicated as a regulator of SEZ6 
expression. SEZ6 has emerged as a novel target for antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) 
therapy, and early studies have shown promising antitumor activity, 
demonstrating the potential for SEZ6 to be targeted by drugs with alternate 
mechanisms of action. Here, we review the current knowledge of the biology of 
SEZ6 and its implications in malignancy, summarize the preclinical and clinical 
findings of SEZ6 targeted ADCs, and discuss future directions to further 
elucidate the role of SEZ6 in SCLC and other neuroendocrine neoplasms.

Astrocytes, the most abundant and functionally diverse glial cell type in the 
brain, play a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and promoting 
neuronal survival. Autophagy is the process of transferring senescent, 
denatured, or damaged proteins and organelles from cells to lysosomes for 
degradation. However, recent research on autophagy in the central nervous system 
has focused on neurons. In this paper, we reviewed the latest findings on 
astrocyte autophagy and its mechanisms in regulating neurodegenerative 
disorders. It influences the pathological processes of Alzheimer's disease, 
Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and other synucleinopathies 
(including dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease dementia) by 
regulating oxidative stress and inflammatory responses, as well as aberrant 
protein aggregation and folding. Furthermore, we listed medications that can 
prevent or treat neurodegenerative disorders by modulating astrocyte autophagy 
pathways, providing new insights into preventive and therapeutic strategies for 
neurodegenerative diseases.

BACKGROUND: Disease-modifying therapies with amyloid-antibodies will soon be 
available for patients with early Alzheimer's disease, which necessitates 
diagnostic and therapeutic resources in hospital and outpatient settings.
METHODS: The Austrian Alzheimer Society developed an online questionnaire to 
survey Austrian hospital-based departments of neurology and psychiatry regarding 
resources for amyloid-antibody therapies.
RESULTS: Between May and October 2023, 30 out of 41 neurology (73%) and 12 out 
of 33 psychiatry departments (36%) responded. The number of first examinations 
per year and center ranges between 0 in centers accepting only secondary 
referrals and 500, median 100. Of the patients 30% (median; range 0-80%) achieve 
a mini-mental state examination sum score ≥ 22 constituting an early disease 
stage. First visits comprise medical history, clinical examination, routine 
blood sampling and neurocognitive screening in 90-100% of patients, magnetic 
resonance imaging in 90% (median; range 10-100%), amyloid-PET in 5% (0-70%), 
cerebrospinal fluid analysis (Aß42, Aß40, tau, phospho-tau) in 25% (0-90%) and 
Apo‑E testing in 2.5% (0-100%). To assess the amyloid status 18 centers (44%) 
prefer amyloid-PET to lumbar puncture, 20 (49%) vice versa and 15 centers intend 
to offer amyloid-antibody therapy. Differences between centers and federal 
states were observed regarding hospital-based resources for amyloid-antibody 
therapies. A substantial need exists for early dementia diagnosis, medical, 
neuropsychological, nursing and administrative resources, adequate space, access 
to amyloid-PET and MRI. All centers highlighted the need for structured patient 
pathways and multidisciplinary care networks, including neurologists, 
psychiatrists, radiologists, neuropsychologists operating in clinical practice, 
rehabilitation and dementia care settings.

Urinary dysfunction caused by central nervous system or peripheral nerve disease 
represents a significant global medical and social problem. Neurologic 
abnormalities, including traumatic brain injury (TBI), stroke, Alzheimer's 
disease, and Parkinson's disease, have been identified as potential risk factors 
for neurogenic urinary tract dysfunction. The relationship between TBI and 
neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD) will be introduced in this 
article, with the mechanisms, clinical manifestations, diagnostic methods, and 
treatment strategies of NLUTD after TBI being evaluated as well, which provides 
a reference for the diagnosis and treatment.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid-β plaques (A), 
tau tangles (T), and neurodegeneration (N), collectively defining the ATN 
framework. While imaging biomarkers are well-established, the prognostic value 
of plasma biomarkers in predicting cognitive decline remains underexplored. This 
study compares plasma and imaging A/T/N biomarkers in predicting cognitive 
decline and evaluate the impact of combining biomarkers across modalities.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal study using K-ROAD cohort 
participants who underwent at least 2 cognitive assessments. All participants 
had plasma biomarker testing (Aβ ratio, p-tau181, p-tau231, p-tau217, NfL), and 
a subset with imaging biomarker assessments (Aβ PET, tau PET, structural MRI) 
formed an imaging subcohort. Multiple linear regression models identified the 
most predictive markers within each modality and evaluated the effect of 
combining A/T/N biomarkers.
RESULTS: Among 1,614 plasma cohort and 130 imaging subcohort participants, tau 
markers demonstrated the strongest predictive value. p-tau217MSD outperforming 
other plasma biomarkers, and the neo-temporal ROI showing the highest predictive 
power among imaging biomarkers. In plasma-based model, adding neurodegeneration 
markers to combination of amyloid and tau biomarkers improved the performance. 
In imaging-based models, same strategy decreased the performance, suggesting 
that combinations of amyloid and tau PET captures the most relevant prognostic 
information.
CONCLUSIONS: Imaging biomarkers, particularly tau PET, show superior prognostic 
accuracy compared with plasma biomarkers, whereas plasma biomarkers offer 
advantages in combination models through neurodegeneration markers. These 
findings underscore the complementary roles of plasma and imaging biomarkers and 
emphasize the need for tailored strategies for prognostic modeling in AD.

Alzheimer's disease is the most common neurodegenerative dementia disorder and 
is associated with several negative health outcomes. Current treatment consists 
of symptomatic treatment and supportive measures. However, advances have led to 
the development of antibodies towards beta-amyloid, which likely plays a pivotal 
role in the pathophysiology. Lecanemab and donanemab have shown efficacy in the 
early stages of Alzheimer's disease but are also associated with a risk of 
cerebral haemorrhages and oedema. The introduction of these antibodies will 
require adjustment of diagnostic and management pathways as discussed in this 
review.

Lecanemab is an amyloid-targeted antibody indicated for treating patients with 
amyloid-confirmed early Alzheimer's Disease in mild dementia or mild cognitive 
impairment stages. We report here a case of a subject with early stage of 
Alzheimer's Disease dementia, amyloid positive, who developed severe acute 
urinary retention following his first dose of intravenous lecanemab. His urinary 
retention resolved after a week but recurred following the second intravenous 
dose 2 weeks later. Lecanemab was discontinued, but the urinary retention has 
persisted for 8 months indicating possible permanent adverse impact on the 
bladder. The Naranjo causality probability score was 6. The incidence of urinary 
retention with intravenous lecanemab is not known but given that elderly 
patients with dementia may have multiple risks for bladder dysfunction, 
clinicians should remain vigilant. It is hoped that newer formulations, such as 
subcutaneous lecanemab, may prove safer in such patients.

INTRODUCTION: This paper provides a comprehensive review examining the 
application of copper radionuclides, particularly 64Cu, in the diagnosis and 
potential therapy of various brain diseases.
METHODS: Two researchers conducted an independent search of the PubMed and Web 
of Science databases for original research articles published in English. 
Following a screening process based on titles and abstracts, 42 publications 
reporting the use of copper radionuclides for diagnosing or treating brain 
diseases were selected for this review.
RESULTS: The analysis revealed that several copper isotopes, namely 60 Cu, 61 
Cu, 62 Cu, 64Cu, and 67Cu, have been explored for diagnostic or therapeutic 
purposes in conditions including Alzheimer's disease, Wilson's disease, brain 
tumors, and traumatic brain injury. The isotopes 60 Cu, 61 Cu, and 62 Cu were 
primarily associated with diagnostic uses. In contrast, 64Cu and 67Cu were 
identified as having potential for both diagnosis and therapy (theranostic). 
Furthermore, the availability of 64Cu was noted to be better compared to 67Cu.
DISCUSSION: 64Cu radionuclides are frequently employed in imaging techniques for 
brain pathologies. While their role in radiographic applications is prominent, 
the therapeutic potential of 64Cu is currently underdeveloped, and current 
evidence is primarily derived from preclinical studies, highlighting the 
critical need for clinical trials to validate 64Cu's efficacy and safety as a 
theranostic agent in neurological conditions.
CONCLUSION: 64Cu holds significant potential for both diagnosis and therapy of 
various brain diseases. Continued research and development in this area are 
crucial to unlock its full therapeutic potential and improve patient outcomes.

Depression is a debilitating psychiatric disorder characterized by loss of 
interest, anhedonia, and social isolation, which is projected to become the 
leading cause of disability worldwide by 2030. Despite the greater economic and 
social burden imposed by depression, the precise pathophysiology underlying the 
development of depression remains elusive. Betaine (N, N, N-trimethylglycine), 
an amino acid derivative, is widely distributed in various animals and plants 
and has been shown to have numerous beneficial effects, including antioxidant 
activities, anti-inflammatory functions, regulation of energy metabolism, and 
reduction of endoplasmic reticulum stress. It has been used to treat 
Alcohol-Associated Liver Disease (AALD), type 2 diabetes, cancer, obesity, and 
Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Interestingly, accumulating evidence has shown that 
betaine exerts a significant role in alleviating depressive-like behavior in 
patients and animals resulting from chronic stress. Although the antidepressant 
effects of betaine have not been compared with traditional antidepressants with 
insufficient verification, based on the neurobiological mechanisms of 
depression, it may be a potential alternative medicine for the treatment of 
depression. This is the first review aiming to provide a comprehensive overview 
of the remarkable effects of betaine in the pathophysiology of depression. These 
pieces of evidence are of great importance for deepening our understanding of 
the antidepressant mechanism of betaine, so as to develop betaine supplements 
for the supplementary treatment of depression.

INTRODUCTION: The prevalence and costs of dementias are rising due to 
demographic changes. Dementia care depends largely on informal caregivers and 
fragmented healthcare systems that often fail to meet the needs of people with 
dementia.
OBJECTIVES: This systematic review aims to identify unmet needs and barriers in 
European dementia care, providing a framework to improve health strategies.
METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines, articles from 2013 to 2023 were screened 
from Embase, PsycINFO, HTA Database, and Web of Science. The Mixed Methods 
Appraisal Tool was used for evaluation.
RESULTS: From 3,738 articles, 47 met the inclusion criteria. Through a narrative 
synthesis, the review identified unmet needs and barriers among People Living 
with Dementia, caregivers, and healthcare workers. Psychosocial and emotional 
support are essential for managing stress and ensuring quality of life. 
Caregivers demand education about dementia care, progression, and self-care, 
while healthcare workers need training, and interdisciplinary teams. Cultural 
sensitivity is critical for addressing stigma and facilitating inclusive care 
for ethnic minorities. Healthcare access remains fragmented, thereby decreasing 
continuity of care for families. High costs, bureaucratic complexity, and 
geographical inequalities, particularly in rural areas can be barrier to care 
for People Living with Dementia and their families. The COVID-19 pandemic 
disrupted social support services, increasing distress and uncertainty. About 
limitation, publication bias and geographical bias from focus on Europe were 
possible, potentially overlooking insights from other regions.
CONCLUSION: There is need for public policies to enhance education, community 
support, and dementia awareness, with a focus on culturally sensitive care.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common 
neurodegenerative disabilities that often leads to memory loss, confusion, 
difficulty in language and trouble with motor coordination. Although several 
machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms have been utilized to 
identify Alzheimer's disease (AD) from MRI scans, precise classification of AD 
categories remains challenging as neighbouring categories share common features.
METHODS: This study proposes transfer learning-based methods for extracting 
features from MRI scans for multi-class classification of different AD 
categories. Four transfer learning-based feature extractors, namely, 
ResNet152V2, VGG16, InceptionV3, and MobileNet have been employed on two 
publicly available datasets (i.e., ADNI and OASIS) and a Merged dataset 
combining ADNI and OASIS, each having four categories: Moderate Demented (MoD), 
Mild Demented (MD), Very Mild Demented (VMD), and Non Demented (ND).
RESULTS: Results suggest the Modified ResNet152V2 as the optimal feature 
extractor among the four transfer learning methods. Next, by utilizing the 
modified ResNet152V2 as a feature extractor, a Convolutional Neural Network 
based model, namely, the 'IncepRes', is proposed by fusing the Inception and 
ResNet architectures for multiclass classification of AD categories. The results 
indicate that our proposed model achieved a standard accuracy of 96.96%, 98.35% 
and 97.13% for ADNI, OASIS, and Merged datasets, respectively, outperforming 
other competing DL structures.
DISCUSSION: We hope that our proposed framework may automate the precise 
classifications of various AD categories, and thereby can offer the prompt 
management and treatment of cognitive and functional impairments associated with 
AD.

Oxidative stress is characterized by an imbalance between the production and 
elimination of free radicals, where the rate of free radical generation 
surpasses the rate of their removal. This imbalance can lead to tissue and organ 
damage, contributing to the pathogenesis of various diseases. The nervous 
system, due to its high oxygen consumption, is particularly susceptible to 
oxidative stress. Numerous neurotoxins can induce neurotoxicity through 
oxidative stress, thereby contributing to the onset of neurodegenerative 
diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's 
disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Furthermore, neurotoxicity can 
exacerbate oxidative stress by disrupting mitochondrial metabolism and impairing 
the activity of antioxidant enzymes, thereby intensifying neurotoxic effects. 
This review examines the mechanisms underlying the interaction between oxidative 
stress and neurotoxicity and explores strategies to mitigate neurotoxicity by 
reducing oxidative stress, with the aim of informing future clinical approaches 
for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

BACKGROUND: Over 300 mutations in PSEN1 have been identified as causes of 
early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD). While these include missense mutations 
and a few insertions, deletions, or duplications, none result in open reading 
frame shifts, and all alter γ-secretase function to increase the long/short Aβ 
ratio.
METHODS: We identified a novel heterozygous PSEN1 nonsense variant, c.325A > T, 
in a patient and his father, both presenting with EOAD, resulting in the 
substitution of lysine 109 with a premature stop codon at position (p.K109*). 
This produces a truncated 109 amino acid (aa) N-terminal PSEN1 fragment. 
Functional characterization was performed using overexpression models and a 
heterozygous mouse model (Psen1K109*/+).
RESULTS: In overexpression models, downstream ATGs serve as alternative starting 
codons, generating a > 37kDa and a > 27 kDa PSEN1 C-terminal fragment 
(PSEN1-CTFA and PSEN1-CTFB, respectively) that retain the two catalytic 
aspartates of γ-secretase. Heterozygous Psen1K109*/+ mice exhibited subtle 
phenotypic defects, including reduced Pen2 expression and mild APP-CTF 
accumulation. Notably, aged mice demonstrated significantly increased Psen2 
protein expression, potentially contributing to an elevated Aβ42/Aβ38 ratio.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that PSEN1 c.325A > T (p.K109*) is not a 
complete loss-of-function mutation. However, to what extent and by what 
mechanism it contributes to EOAD pathogenesis remains unclear.

BACKGROUND: In relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), the assessment of 
clinical disease activity can be challenging.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the diagnostic potential of serum neurofilament light 
(sNfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (sGFAP) to distinguish a relapse from 
other causes of deterioration.
METHODS: In this multicenter, prospective study, RRMS patients with new 
neurological symptoms in the last 14 days were followed for 12 weeks. A 
diagnosis was established by the treating physician or, when in doubt, a panel 
of experienced neurologists. Blood samples were taken at baseline and week 12.
RESULTS: A total of 65 patients were included. At baseline, patients with a 
clear relapse had a significantly higher median sNfL (14.6 pg/mL) than those 
with a clear other cause (9.5 pg/mL, p = 0.004). Although not significant after 
correction for multiple testing, median sGFAP was also higher in relapse 
patients (73.0 vs 64.6 pg/mL, p = 0.036). An sNfL value below 6.0 pg/mL had a 
high sensitivity (67% at baseline (CI 22.3-95.7%) and 100% at follow-up (CI 
54.1-100%)) to rule out a relapse.
CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of sNfL level can be useful as an add-on investigation to 
determine whether disease activity is present in patients with RRMS presenting 
with new symptoms.

As48, a First-in-Class Dual-Function TREM2 Modulator: Receptor Activation and 
Shedding Inhibition.

Cho S, Gaamouch FE, Upadhyay S, Nada H, Kuncewicz K, Gabr MT.

Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) dysfunction contributes 
to Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, yet current therapeutics cannot prevent 
ADAM-mediated receptor shedding that diminishes signaling efficacy. Using 
Affinity Selection-Mass Spectrometry (AS-MS) screening, we identified As48, a 
novel small molecule that binds TREM2 with high affinity. Biophysical validation 
confirmed s 7-fold selectivity over TREM1. Cellular assays demonstrated that 
As48 functions as a TREM2 agonist, activating SYK phosphorylation and enhancing 
microglial phagocytosis. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations 
revealed that As48 binds near the cleavage region, establishing hydrogen bonds 
with Gly68 and reducing conformational flexibility in regions 58-102. Based on 
this structural insight, we investigated the effect of As48 on TREM2 ectodomain 
shedding and discovered inhibition of receptor shedding without affecting 
ADAM10/17 protease activities, representing the first small molecule with 
anti-shedding properties through conformational restriction of protease 
accessibility. Importantly, As48 displayed favorable pharmacokinetics with 
potential for brain permeability, supporting its translational relevance. 
Through its dual and simultaneous promotion of receptor activation and 
prevention of shedding, As48 represents a paradigm shift in TREM2 modulation and 
neuroinflammatory drug discovery.

Structure-Based Virtual Screening Identifies TREM2-Targeted Small Molecules that 
Enhance Microglial Phagocytosis.

Cho S, Kaur B, Lam K, Gaamouch FE, Kuncewicz K, Doering NP, Wolber G, Gabr MT.

Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is a microglia-specific 
receptor whose activation promotes phagocytosis and neuroprotection in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related neurodegenerative disorders. While 
therapeutic efforts have largely focused on antibodies, small molecule TREM2 
modulators remain limited. Here, we applied a structure- based virtual screening 
workflow targeting a putative allosteric site on TREM2, guided by PyRod-derived 
pharmacophores from molecular dynamics simulations. Screening of the Enamine 
Collection yielded 20 candidate compounds, three of which demonstrated binding 
in TRIC assays. The top hit, EN020 , exhibited a KD of 14.2 µM (MST) and 35.9 µM 
(SPR), and significantly enhanced microglial phagocytosis in BV2 cells 
outperforming the known TREM2 agonist VG-3927 . A preliminary structure-activity 
relationship (SAR) study, including synthetic and catalog-derived analogs, 
highlighted a narrow tolerance for scaffold modifications, with only T2V002 
retaining partial TREM2 binding affinity. This work identifies EN020 as a novel 
small molecule TREM2 modulator with functional activity, providing a framework 
for rational optimization toward potential AD therapeutics.

Atomically Dispersed Ru Catalyst Locked in Knitting Aryl Network Polymers: A 
Robust Heterogeneous Catalyst for Borrowing Hydrogenation in Aqueous Micelles.

Fabrication of water-stable and atomically dispersed ruthenium catalysts for 
sustainable borrowing hydrogenation (BH) reactions is a long-standing challenge. 
Herein, we developed an atomically dispersed Ru catalyst that has been 
successfully employed for BH reactions in aqueous micelles under mild 
conditions. The micellar cooperativity with the hydrophobic knitted aryl 
polymers (KAPs) led to the formation of microconfinements, which act as the 
confined space for catalysis in water. The catalyst was characterized by using 
various techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning 
electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy 
(HR-TEM), aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning 
transmission electron microscopy (AC-HAADF-STEM), X-ray photoelectron 
spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Confocal laser 
scanning microscopy (CLSM) and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) 
have been used to understand the role of micelles, reagents, and materials in 
the generation of confined space in water. The catalyst was found to be 
recyclable for five cycles without a significant loss of its catalytic activity. 
We have also demonstrated a 1 g scale reaction for the alkylation of 
acetophenone and synthesis of Donepezil, a marketed drug for the treatment of 
Alzheimer's disease, using our method.

INTRODUCTION: The microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA), a complex two-way connection 
between the gut microbiota and the brain, has become a key regulator of 
neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. Neurological disorders and gut 
microbiota dysbiosis are linked to these diseases. Changes in gut microbiota can 
lead to neurotransmitter imbalances, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. 
Gut dysbiosis may contribute to the development of diseases such as depression, 
autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's 
disease, dementia, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, anxiety, and autism spectrum 
disorders through immunological regulation, neuroinflammation, and 
neurotransmitter metabolism changes.
METHOD: This review systematically sourced articles related to microbiota gut 
brain axis, neurological disorders, neuropsychiatric disorders and clinical 
studies from major medical databases, including Scopus, PubMed, and Web of 
Science.
RESULTS: This review explores the molecular processes underlying MGBA 
interactions, including vagus nerve signaling, systemic immunological responses, 
and metabolites produced by microorganisms. The discussion explores the 
potential of microbiome-targeted treatments like fecal microbiota 
transplantation, probiotics, and prebiotics as effective treatment methods. The 
comprehension of the MGBA can revolutionize neurology and psychiatry, 
introducing innovative diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Multiple elements, 
including diet, metabolism, age, stress, and medications, shape the human gut 
microbiota, and intestinal imbalances can lead to CNS diseases. The MGBA 
interacts with gut bacteria, and gut dysbiosis is associated with neurological 
disorders.
CONCLUSIONS: The review demonstrates the correlation between gut microbiota and 
neurologically associated diseases, highlighting its importance in neurogenesis, 
mental development, emotions, and behaviors. MGBA, mediated by microbial 
metabolites, affects brain function and neuroinflammation. Interventions like 
fetal microbiota transplantation, probiotics, and prebiotics can improve 
microbial balance, but more clinical research is needed.

Dementia, characterized by a progressive decline in cognitive function, poses a 
significant challenge to global healthcare systems, with current therapeutic 
approaches offering limited efficacy. The development of nanotechnology-based 
drug delivery systems has introduced promising avenues for enhancing the 
treatment of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. 
Dendrimers, with their highly branched, nanoscale structure, provide an 
innovative platform for targeted drug delivery to the brain. Dendrimers serve as 
nanoscale drug carriers that facilitate controlled drug release, enhance 
bioavailability, and improve penetration across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), 
leading to superior therapeutic efficacy in neurodegenerative disorders. In 
particular, dendrimers can encapsulate both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs, 
increasing their stability and minimizing systemic side effects. This review 
explores the unique properties of dendrimers, focusing on their potential as 
drug delivery vehicles in dementia treatment. We also highlight advancements in 
the design and application of dendrimer-based therapeutics, emphasizing their 
role in targeting key pathological mechanisms underlying dementia. Through these 
approaches, dendrimers represent a promising strategy for developing more 
effective and personalized treatment modalities for patients suffering from 
cognitive impairment and dementia.

INTRODUCTION: Neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and 
ALS are characterized by progressive neuronal dysfunction with limited 
therapeutic options. Recent advances in molecular biology and drug development 
have highlighted the therapeutic promise of precision enzyme targeting, offering 
novel strategies for disease modulation and symptom management.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature review spanning recent/current was conducted 
using PubMed, Scopus, and ScienceDirect. Studies focusing on enzyme-based 
targets, high-throughput screening, and molecular docking in neurodegeneration 
were included. Thematic synthesis was employed to categorize findings based on 
enzyme class, disease relevance, and therapeutic outcomes.
RESULTS: Key enzyme families such as kinases, proteases, and oxidoreductases 
were identified as pivotal modulators in disease progression. Emerging 
enzyme-targeted compounds demonstrated enhanced bioavailability, blood-brain 
barrier permeability, and disease-specific efficacy. Novel screening platforms 
and computational modeling enabled the precise selection of inhibitors, 
significantly improving the therapeutic index and reducing off-target effects.
DISCUSSION: Targeting enzymes implicated in neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, 
and protein misfolding has shown disease-modifying potential. Integrating 
precision drug discovery tools, such as AI-assisted modeling and enzyme 
kinetics, supports rational drug design. However, translational challenges 
persist due to variability in enzyme expression and disease heterogeneity.
CONCLUSION: Future research should focus on refining enzyme inhibitors and 
integrating biomarkers to facilitate personalized treatment strategies for 
neurodegenerative disorders. As the understanding of enzymatic roles in 
neurodegeneration deepens, precision enzyme-targeted drug discovery holds 
significant promise in transforming neurotherapeutic approaches.

BACKGROUND: Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET hypometabolism is considered a 
biomarker of neurodegeneration. However, recent evidence revealed that glial 
cells contribute to the FDG-PET signal. In this context, microglial changes have 
been evaluated with 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO)-PET radiopharmaceuticals. 
While several studies have concomitantly conducted FDG- and TSPO-PET imaging, 
their associations remain controversial.
OBJECTIVE: We systematically revised multi-tracer preclinical and clinical 
studies using FDG- and TSPO-PET to investigate neurodegenerative conditions.
RESULTS: From 401 studies, 14 preclinical studies, 7 clinical studies and 1 
study including both met the inclusion criteria. The preclinical studies 
included mouse models of amyloid, tau, and neurotoxins, whereas the clinical 
studies investigated Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and frontotemporal 
lobar degeneration. Most clinical studies found a negative association between 
FDG- and TSPO-PET signals, whereas animal studies showed mixed results being 
highly dependent on the radiotracer used.
DISCUSSION: Our findings support the connection between glial and metabolic 
changes in the brain while highlighting glial heterogeneity between species and 
the specificities of TSPO-PET radiotracers. To better understand the dynamic 
associations between FDG- and TSPO-PET, it is essential to conduct longitudinal 
studies during the early stages of neurodegenerative disorders, along with the 
use of novel mouse models that more accurately represent these conditions.

BACKGROUND: Elevated pulse pressure (PP), indicative of arterial stiffness, has 
been implicated in cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. 
However, its role in preclinical AD and interactions with genetic risk factors 
like apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE4) remain unclear.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association between baseline PP and AD biomarkers 
(amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau) and cognitive decline, and to determine whether 
APOE4 carrier status moderates these relationships.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study and secondary analysis of the Anti-Amyloid 
Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's (A4) randomized clinical trial SETTING: 
Multicenter observational cohort and randomized clinical trial conducted at 67 
sites across the United States, Canada, Australia, and Japan.
PARTICIPANTS: This study included 1690 cognitively unimpaired older adults from 
the A4 and Longitudinal Evaluation of Amyloid Risk and Neurodegeneration (LEARN) 
studies. Participants underwent baseline PP assessment, Aβ and tau PET imaging, 
and cognitive testing with longitudinal follow-up over 240 weeks.
MEASUREMENTS: Blood pressure was measured at baseline, with PP calculated as the 
difference between systolic and diastolic pressures. AD pathologies were 
assessed through Aβ PET imaging using 18F-Florbetapir, and regional tau 
deposition in inferior temporal and meta-temporal regions using 18F-Flortaucipir 
PET imaging. Cognitive performance was measured using the Preclinical Alzheimer 
Cognitive Composite (PACC).
RESULTS: Higher baseline PP was significantly associated with increased Aβ (β = 
0.078; p = 0.001), inferior temporal tau (β = 0.110; p = 0.032), and 
meta-temporal tau deposition (β = 0.116; p = 0.022). In longitudinal analyses, 
elevated PP predicted greater decline in PACC scores (β = -0.020; p < 0.001). 
APOE4 status moderated these associations, with significant effects of PP on tau 
deposition and cognitive decline observed exclusively among APOE4 carriers. 
Mediation analysis indicated that tau deposition significantly mediated the 
association between PP and cognitive decline (indirect effect β = -0.068; 95 % 
CI [-0.126, -0.011]).
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated PP is associated with increased AD biomarker burden and 
accelerated cognitive decline in cognitively unimpaired older adults, 
particularly among APOE4 carriers. Our study suggests that arterial stiffness 
may contribute to AD pathogenesis and progression via tau pathology. These 
results highlight the potential of vascular health management as an early 
intervention target for AD prevention, especially in genetically at-risk 
populations.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an endogenously produced gasotransmitter that has 
garnered growing attention for its critical roles in cellular signalling and 
brain function. It regulates NMDA receptors during long-term potentiation, a 
fundamental mechanism underlying memory consolidation and influences 
neurotransmission and essential neurophysiological functions. H2S is synthesized 
by three enzymes: cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE) and cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) 
and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MST) within the cell. CBS is suggested 
to be the primary source of H2S in the brain parenchyma, while CSE and MST 
predominantly contribute to its production in cerebral microvessels and 
astrocytes, respectively. This gasotransmitter plays a pivotal role in 
modulating hippocampal memory formation, reducing inflammation, promoting 
vasorelaxation, and supporting angiogenesis. It has been suggested to act as a 
second messenger or neurotransmitter in the brain, typically activated by 
neuronal excitation. H2S has been widely investigated for its therapeutic 
potential in Alzheimer's disease. Notably, Alzheimer's disease patients display 
significantly diminished levels of H2S compared to age matched subjects. This 
review offers a consolidated and updated role of H2S in Alzheimer's disease, 
emphasizing recent mechanistic advances not covered in earlier literature. The 
work presents a novel perspective by integrating emerging findings on H2S based 
neurotherapeutic strategies.

Neuroimmunological disorders involve complex interactions between the nervous 
and immune systems, leading to various severe neurological conditions such as 
Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis. These 
disorders are characterized by immune-mediated damage or inflammation within 
nervous tissue, resulting in cognitive deficits, movement issues, sensory 
impairments, and other neurological problems. They can affect people of all 
ages, but incidence increases significantly with advancing age, making them a 
growing public health concern. As the global population ages, the prevalence of 
neuroimmunological diseases is expected to rise sharply. Projections indicate 
that by 2050, approximately 150 million individuals worldwide may suffer from 
dementia-related disorders alone, with an economic burden reaching around $10 
trillion. Current therapies mainly focus on symptom management, aiming to slow 
disease progression and improve quality of life. Emerging therapeutic strategies 
show promise, particularly nanomedicine, which employs nanoscale materials to 
deliver drugs precisely to affected tissues. This targeted approach reduces side 
effects and increases treatment effectiveness. Additionally, natural products 
and plant-based compounds are gaining attention for their neuroprotective 
effects, as they can modulate pathways involved in neuronal survival, repair, 
and immune regulation. Future research aims to deepen understanding of the 
molecular and genetic mechanisms underlying these disorders through advanced 
experimental models and technologies. These insights will facilitate the 
development of innovative therapies targeting neuroinflammation and immune 
dysregulation, with the goal of preventing disease progression or even achieving 
cures. Continued progress in neuroimmunology offers hope for improved treatment 
outcomes, reduced disease burden, and transformative advances in neurological 
healthcare worldwide.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most prevalent diseases in the older 
population. AD causes progressive cognitive and behavioral impairment, but 
current treatments are unable to slow or prevent the progression of this 
disease. Thus, identification of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets is 
urgently needed. We previously described the roles of histone acetylation, 
crotonylation, and lactylation in the accumulation of amyloid beta and 
hyperphosphorylation of Tau protein, which are the hallmarks of AD. In this 
review, we summarize and discuss the current knowledge of the role of histone 
modifications in AD, with a particular emphasis on its association with 
characterized pathological alterations, including amyloid plaques, Tau tangles, 
neuroinflammation, and synaptic dysfunction. This review provides novel insights 
into the central role of histone modifications in AD pathogenesis and evaluates 
histone-modifying enzymes as potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of 
AD.
