Phenotypic correlations between complex human traits have long been observed 
based on epidemiological studies. However, the genetic basis and underlying 
mechanisms are largely unknown. Here we developed a gene-based approach to 
measure genetic overlap between a pair of traits and to delineate the shared 
genes/pathways, through three steps: 1) translating SNP-phenotype association 
profile to gene-phenotype association profile by integrating GWAS with eQTL data 
using a newly developed algorithm called Sherlock-II; 2) measuring the genetic 
overlap between a pair of traits by a normalized distance and the associated p 
value between the two gene-phenotype association profiles; 3) delineating 
genes/pathways involved. Application of this approach to a set of GWAS data 
covering 59 human traits detected significant overlap between many known and 
unexpected pairs of traits; a significant fraction of them are not detectable by 
SNP based genetic similarity measures. Examples include Cancer and Alzheimer's 
Disease (AD), Rheumatoid Arthritis and Crohn's disease, and Longevity and 
Fasting glucose. Functional analysis revealed specific genes/pathways shared by 
these pairs. For example, Cancer and AD are co-associated with genes involved in 
hypoxia response and P53/apoptosis pathways, suggesting specific mechanisms 
underlying the inverse correlation between them. Our approach can detect yet 
unknown relationships between complex traits and generate mechanistic hypotheses 
and has the potential to improve diagnosis and treatment by transferring 
knowledge from one disease to another.

As populations age, identifying the neurobiological basis of cognitive 
resilience is critical for delaying or preventing Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
While most older adults experience memory decline, a subset known as superagers 
(SA) maintains youthful memory into late life, offering a unique window into 
protective mechanisms against neurodegeneration. Here, we identified a 
functional connectivity (FC) signature, termed Alzheimer's-resilient connectome 
(ARC), that robustly differentiates SA from age-matched patients with AD. Using 
resting-state fMRI in a discovery cohort (N = 290), we identified ARC derived 
from machine learning classifiers that distinguished SA from AD with high 
accuracy (AUC = 0.85), and validated the replicability of the ARC in an 
independent replication cohort (N = 143). ARC involved prefrontal, temporal and 
insular networks and was strongly associated with brain age. When applied to 
cognitively unimpaired (CU) adults (discovery cohort: N = 818 and replication 
cohort: N = 497), ARC-based subtyping revealed SA-like and AD-like subgroups 
with similar baseline cognitive performance but markedly divergent longitudinal 
trajectories. SA-like CU individuals showed slower cognitive decline, reduced 
amyloid-β accumulation, and lower risk of conversion to mild cognitive 
impairment and AD, reinforcing the ARC signature as a potential early indicator 
of resilience. Genome-wide association analysis identified CLYBL and FRMD6 as 
novel genetic modulators associated with these divergent aging phenotypes. 
Together, our findings position ARC as a sensitive and generalizable biomarker 
of resilience, enabling early risk stratification and precision prevention for 
AD.

and Parkinson's Disease.

Rochester Medical Center, 601 Elmwood Ave, Box 604, Rochester NY 14642 USA.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are the two most common 
neurodegenerative disorders. While the symptoms and general etiology may be 
different, these two diseases share significant common features in terms of 
their disease pathogenesis. Within the scope of neurodegenerative disorders, the 
Bcl-2 associated athanogene (BAG) family proteins and associated interactors 
have been a key area of focus. The BAG family is a group of proteins that 
contain at least one evolutionarily conserved BAG domain. Despite this 
similarity, their interactions and functions can vary widely. So far, research 
has predominantly scrutinized individual BAG proteins, rather than explore 
potential cooperative actions among family members. Some BAG family members may 
function together thereby indicating potential interactions within this family. 
Although connections among BAG members have been observed, their role in 
neurodegenerative disorders, such as AD and PD, remains largely uncharacterized. 
This mini review explores the common pathways, intersections, and differences 
within these interactions as well as their link to AD and PD. Using 
computational techniques to mine transcriptomic data, several groupings of 
pathways that these BAG family members are involved in were identified in the 
context of AD and PD. Understanding these pathways and their relationships may 
uncover potential gaps in current research and help identify novel therapeutic 
targets for the treatment of these neurodegenerative diseases.

Individuals with Lewy body dementia (LBD) rely on family caregivers. Caregiving 
demands limit caregivers' ability to attend to their own health needs, 
increasing their vulnerability to the psychological effects of caregiving. We 
previously piloted a peer mentoring intervention with experienced (mentor) and 
less experienced (mentee) LBD caregivers. Matched mentor-mentee dyads spoke 
weekly for 16 weeks, guided by an intervention handbook. LBD knowledge and 
attitudes towards dementia improved post-intervention. We hypothesized that 
caregiver health status moderates response to peer mentoring. Post hoc analyses 
(N = 30 dyads) showed that 75% of mentees and 66% of mentors endorsed ≥1 
comorbidity. Mentees and mentors with comorbidities showed greater improvement 
in LBD knowledge postintervention (P = 0.039) and dementia attitudes 
post-training (P = 0.016), respectively. Caregivers with comorbidities and thus 
greater exposure to health care may derive excess benefit from an effective LBD 
caregiver intervention than healthier counterparts, enhancing both the objective 
knowledge and their confidence in caring for their loved ones.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is one of common progressive and fatal 
neurodegenerative disorders,and its main clinical symptoms are progressive 
memory impairment and cognitive dysfunction. The Tat-NR2B9c, a peptide was known 
as postsynaptic density protein-95(PSD-95) inhibitors, has shown clinical 
efficacy as a neuroprotective effects in some diseases such as acute stroke and 
neuropathic pain.The aim of the study is to clarify whether Tat-NR2B9c has the 
same neuroprotective effects in AD.
METHODS: Studies were performed in mice modeling AD induced by Aβ1-42. Animals 
were treated with drugs after modeling AD for 14 days,and the spatial learning 
and memory ability were assessed after drug treatment. Then, mice were 
euthanized for biochemical tests.
RESULTS: The levels of PSD-95 and NR2B decreased,and the levels of 
N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor-postsynaptic density protein-95 interaction 
increased in hippocampus in AD mice. Tat-NR2B9c can improve spatial learning and 
memory ability in AD mice by perturbing PSD-95 interactions with NR2B-subtype 
but not inhibiting PSD-95 levels.
CONCLUSION: Tat-NR2B9c can prevent cognitive dysfunction in mice modeling AD 
induced by Aβ1-42 via perturbing PSD-95 interactions with NR2B-subtype 
receptors.

Hyperelodeoines A and B (1 and 2, respectively), two unprecedented 
seco-prenylated butylphloroglucinol derivatives, along with two known analogues 
(3 and 4), were identified from Hypericum elodeoides. Compounds 1 and 2, 
featuring a 7/5 fused ring core, represent the first examples of phloroglucinol 
ring-opening products derived from the [3.2.1]-type bicyclic polyprenylated 
acylphloroglucinols (BPAPs). Notably, 2 and 4 significantly upregulated ABCA1 
and ApoE protein levels in BV-2 cells. Dual-luciferase reporter assay, CETSA, 
and SPR analysis identified PPARγ as the potential target of 2 and 4. In vivo 
zebrafish studies further demonstrated that 2 and 4 exhibited remarkable 
anti-Alzheimer's disease (AD) effects with no detectable toxicity or 
teratogenicity. Thus, 2 and 4 could activate PPARγ and show promise as anti-AD 
agents.

BackgroundWe demonstrated that Honokiol (HKL), a natural compound from Magnolia 
officinalis, exerts neuroprotection in APP/PS1 mice by increasing the expression 
of Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3), which activates mitochondrial autophagy. We also found 
that the liver may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). However, it remains unclear whether HKL exerts its protection on 
AD through hepatic pathways.ObjectiveWe aimed to elucidate the impact of HKL on 
the liver of AD mice and its mechanisms.MethodsAPP/PS1 transgenic mice were 
utilized as AD models and administered with HKL and 3-TYP (an inhibitor of 
SIRT3). Congo-red staining and immunohistochemistry were conducted to detect the 
Aβ1-42 plaque deposition in the brain. Hematoxylin-eosin and Oil red O staining 
were employed to observe alterations in hepatic morphology. Liver function 
markers were tested to assess the metabolic function. qRT-PCR was employed to 
examine the level of SIRT3 mRNA. Western blot was performed to evaluate the 
expression of SIRT3, insulin degrading enzyme (IDE), GpLD1, lipoprotein receptor 
related protein 1 (LRP-1), ANGPTL8, and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2).ResultsHKL 
mitigated the Aβ1-42 plaque deposition in the brains of AD mice. It also reduced 
hepatic morphological damage. Additionally, HKL decreased the levels of ALT, 
AST, ALP, TBIL, and DBIL, and enhanced the levels of TP and ALB. It increased 
the levels of SIRT3 mRNA, and also the expression of SIRT3, IDE, GpLD1, and 
SOD2, while suppressing the expression of LRP-1 and ANGPTL8. 3-TYP could reverse 
all these effects of HKL on AD mice.ConclusionsHKL might alleviate liver damage 
of AD mice by upregulating SIRT3.

BackgroundAlzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized 
by cognitive decline, amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and 
neuroinflammation. Glial cells-astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes-play 
essential roles in AD progression, but their pathway-specific genetic 
contributions remain unclear.ObjectiveTo identify glial cell type-specific 
biological pathways associated with AD using pathway-based polygenic risk score 
(PRS) analysis.MethodsWe applied PRSet to evaluate associations between 
glial-specific pathways and AD in a discovery dataset (ADc1234ADA), adjusting 
for the top two principal components (Model 1), and additionally for sex, age, 
and APOE ε4 status (Model 2). Pathways with nominal significance (p < 0.05) were 
further tested in an independent replication dataset (ADNI). Results from both 
datasets were meta-analyzed and assessed for statistical significance using 
Bonferroni correction. Competitive p-values were used to determine the relative 
contribution of each pathway within glial types. Genes from significant pathways 
were used in a follow-up gene-based PRS analysis, following the same modeling 
and validation steps.ResultsIn Model 1, we identified four significant 
astrocytic, six microglial, and one oligodendrocyte pathways. In Model 2, five 
astrocytic and three oligodendrocytic pathways remained significant; no 
microglial pathways met significance. The top pathways were the immune system in 
astrocytes, antigen processing in microglia, and transport and trafficking in 
oligodendrocytes. At the gene level, BCL3 and BIN1 were significant in Model 1, 
while only BIN1 remained in Model 2.ConclusionsThese findings highlight distinct 
glia-specific genetic contributions to AD, particularly involving immune-related 
pathways, and demonstrate the value of cell-type-specific PRS approaches in AD 
research.

The Copenhagen Memory Clinic was established in 1995 and since 2007 a new 
national center for research and education was established, together forming the 
Danish Dementia Research Centre (DDRC). Our research and innovation programs 
have continuously been informed by clinical experience and inspired by the needs 
of our patients. The link between patient care, research, and education forming 
together a comprehensive dementia center is therefore of crucial importance. In 
this review, we present an overview of the clinical program at the Copenhagen 
Memory Clinic, currently receiving 2.000 new referrals per year. We also present 
the Copenhagen Memory Clinic Cohort and the associated biobank, as well as 
clinical, translational and epidemiological research programs performed at DDRC 
during the past 30 years. Funded in part by the Danish Ministry of Health, our 
national outreach, professional networks and educational programs are also 
outlined. From its inception and onwards the primary focus of the DDRC has been 
with the patients, aiming to continuously improve our clinical service based on 
research and innovation and to improve the quality of care nationwide. We 
welcome requests for collaboration on research, innovation and education from 
international colleagues and research centers.

Cistanche flavonoids activate the Keap1-Nrf2-ARE signaling pathway in improving 
cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease: A review.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder closely 
associated with oxidative stress, which plays a pivotal role in neuronal damage 
and disease progression. The Keap1-Nrf2-ARE signaling pathway plays a crucial 
role in regulating cellular responses to oxidative stress. Keap1 inhibits Nrf2 
by maintaining its low expression, thus controlling antioxidant gene expression. 
Cistanche flavonoids, natural polyphenolic compounds, have been shown to 
activate this pathway. They suppress Keap1, preventing Nrf2 degradation and 
promoting its translocation to the nucleus, where it activates the antioxidant 
response element (ARE). This process significantly increases the production of 
antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. 
Elevated enzyme levels enhance cellular antioxidant defenses, reduce oxidative 
damage at the cellular and neuronal levels, and improve cognitive function in AD 
mouse models. The study examined the molecular composition of Cistanche 
flavonoids and their impact on the Keap1-Nrf2-ARE pathway, revealing their 
potential in mitigating AD-related changes. By neutralizing free radicals and 
enhancing antioxidant defenses, Cistanche flavonoids may offer a promising 
approach to counteract AD pathology. This comprehensive analysis underscores 
their therapeutic potential in alleviating AD through oxidative stress reduction 
and antioxidant activation.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of 
amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology. Recently, plasma biomarkers, particularly p-tau217, 
have emerged as promising tools for early diagnosis and risk stratification. In 
this retrospective study, we evaluated the diagnostic performance of p-tau217 
combined with other plasma biomarkers in distinguishing Aβ Positron emission 
tomography (PET) positivity in cognitively unimpaired (CU) and cognitively 
impaired (CI) individuals across diverse clinical subgroups.
METHODS: We analyzed 2,497 participants from the Korea-Registries to Overcome 
dementia and Accelerate Dementia (K-ROAD) cohort, including 636 CU and 1,971 CI 
individuals. Plasma p-tau217 was measured using both SIngle MOlecule Array 
(SIMOA) and Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) assays, alongside Aβ42/40, Glial 
fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and Neurofilament light chain (NfL). We 
assessed the diagnostic performance of biomarker combinations for Aβ PET 
positivity through the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
(AUC), Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion 
(BIC), and performed subgroup analyses based on age, sex, body mass index (BMI), 
and Apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 status. To assess applicability, we stratified 
the cohort by recruitment site into a development set (Samsung Medical Center, 
n = 1,545) and a validation set (other centers, n = 952).
RESULTS: In CU individuals from the development cohort, the combination of 
p-tau217 and Aβ42/40 significantly improved diagnostic accuracy (AUC: ALZpath 
0.937 vs. 0.905, MSD 0.901 vs. 0.861; p < 0.05, DeLong test; 95% CIs) and model 
fit (AIC /BIC, p < 0.001) compared to p-tau217 alone. In contrast, in CI 
individuals, the combination provided only modest improvements in model fit 
without significantly enhancing AUC. GFAP and NfL did not contribute 
significantly to amyloid detection in either group. These findings were 
successfully validated in an independent cohort from other centers. Subgroup 
analyses in CU individuals showed the greatest improvements in older adults, 
females, and APOE4 non-carriers, regardless of obesity status. In CI 
individuals, the combination had no significant impact on AUC except in males, 
where a small but significant increase was observed (p = 0.002).
CONCLUSION: Combining p-tau217 with Aβ42/40 enhances amyloid detection in CU 
individuals, improving both diagnostic accuracy and model fit, whereas its 
impact in CI individuals is limited. These results highlight the potential of 
plasma biomarker combinations for refining early AD diagnostics and 
individualized risk assessment.

BACKGROUND: Healthy lifestyle factors, including diet, may affect brain amyloid 
beta (Aβ) load. This study examines dietary patterns as moderators of the 
relationships among symptoms of depression, anxiety, and brain Aβ load.
METHOD: A cross-sectional study of cognitively unimpaired older adults (n = 524) 
from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers, and Lifestyle study assessed dietary 
patterns, depressive and anxiety symptoms, and brain Aβ load. Moderation and 
simple slope analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet moderated the 
relationship between depressive and anxiety symptoms and brain Aβ load. Higher 
symptoms were associated with greater Aβ load in individuals with lower DASH 
adherence. This effect was also observed for anxiety symptoms in apolipoprotein 
E ε4 carriers. The Mediterranean and Western diets did not moderate these 
relationships.
CONCLUSION: The DASH diet adherence may mitigate the impact of depressive and 
anxiety symptoms on brain Aβ load, supporting genotype-specific dietary 
interventions in mental and brain health.
HIGHLIGHTS: The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet moderates 
the links among depression, anxiety, and brain amyloid load. Higher symptoms 
were linked to greater amyloid load in those with low DASH adherence. This 
effect was observed for anxiety symptoms in apolipoprotein E ε4 allele carriers. 
Mediterranean and Western diets did not moderate these relationships. Findings 
support genotype-specific dietary interventions for brain and mental health.

As the global population ages, understanding cognitive dysfunction, including 
Alzheimer's Disease and other forms of dementia, is crucial. With the growing 
prevalence of these disorders, it is essential to identify and understand 
potential factors that maintain cognitive function and potentially delay severe 
cognitive dysfunction. This study examined the roles of repetitive negative 
thinking (RNT) and reflection in subjective cognitive dysfunction among older 
adults, with an additional consideration of their association with depressive 
symptoms. RNT, which is common in depression, has been associated with cognitive 
impairments. However, its unique influence on cognitive dysfunction is unclear. 
Conversely, reflection, considered to protect against adverse cognitive 
outcomes, is less explored. Using the Rumination Response Scale (RRS), we 
hypothesize that RNT may be more strongly linked to cognitive dysfunction than 
reflection, even when controlling for depressive symptoms. Two-hundred and 
seventy-six older adults (137 male, 139 female) from Japan participated in the 
study, providing measures of RRS-brooding (an index of RNT), RRS-reflection (an 
index of reflection), depressive symptoms, and self-reported cognitive 
dysfunction. The results showed higher reflection, but not RNT, was associated 
with greater subjective cognitive dysfunction [β = 0.28, p =.03], even after 
controlling for depressive symptoms. Importantly, the association between 
reflection and cognitive dysfunction demonstrated sex differences, with 
reflection significantly accounting for cognitive dysfunction in female 
[β = 0.46, p =.01] but not in male. These findings highlight the significance of 
evaluating specific subtypes of repetitive thoughts and sex differences when 
investigating the association with perceived cognitive dysfunction. Future 
research should continue to explore the mechanisms underlying these associations 
and the prevention and treatment of cognitive dysfunctions.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is responsible for more than 80% of cases of dementia 
in senior individuals globally. In the current study, the role of modulation of 
the FGF1/PI3K/Akt pathway in the protective effect of tozasertib was evaluated. 
Experimental dementia was induced in mice by injecting streptozotocin (STZ) 
intracerebroventricularly. Various biochemical parameters for oxidative stress & 
lipid peroxidation (SOD, GSH, catalase, TBARS), neuroinflammation (MPO, IL-6, 
IL-1 β, TNF-α, NFκB), apoptotic markers (Bax, Bcl-2, Caspase-3), and memory 
parameters (AChE activity, β1-40 levels) were assessed. The behavioral 
parameters evaluated included the Morris Water Maze test and the step-down 
passive avoidance test. Histological changes were assessed using H&E staining. 
ICV STZ-induced AD resulted in increased oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, 
neuroinflammation, apoptosis, and decreased learning and memory. The results 
showed that administration of tozasertib improved memory, decreased levels of 
oxidative stress, inflammatory parameters, and apoptotic markers, and improved 
histological parameters in a dose-dependent manner. Pre-administration of 
LY294002, a PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitor, partially reversed the protective 
effects of Tozasertib, suggesting possible involvement of this pathway. However, 
as the mechanism was inferred primarily through pharmacological antagonism, 
further studies including direct molecular assessments (e.g. p-Akt/t-Akt) are 
warranted to confirm the role of FGF1/PI3K/Akt signaling in Tozasertib's action.

INTRODUCTION: Arterial stiffness (carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity [cfPWV]) 
and plasma neurofilament light (NfL), markers of vascular and neuroaxonal aging, 
are linked to cognitive decline. Whether higher cfPWV amplifies the 
NfL-cognition relationship remains unclear.
METHODS: Cognitively unimpaired older adults (N = 570) were assessed using 
composite cognitive scores from confirmatory factor analysis. cfPWV was 
dichotomized at the median. Plasma NfL was quantified on a Single Moleculte 
Array-High Definition, model X (SIMOA-HD X).
RESULTS: Higher NfL correlated with poorer performance across all cognitive 
domains (p < 0.05), and higher cfPWV was linked to worse episodic memory, 
working memory, and processing speed (p < 0.05). NfL× cfPWV interactions were 
significant for episodic (β = 0.289, p = 0.048) and working memory (β = 0.287, 
p = 0.025), with stronger NfL-cognition associations in the higher cfPWV group 
(episodic memory: β = -0.324, p < 0.01; working memory: β = -0.343, p < 0.01).
DISCUSSION: Greater cfPWV amplified the association between NfL-related axonal 
degeneration and cognitive decline.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02875301 HIGHLIGHTS: Neurofilament 
light (NfL) and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) each correlate with 
poorer cognitive function in older adults. Higher cfPWV exacerbates the link 
between NfL and cognitive deficits. Arterial stiffness may worsen NfL-related 
cognitive decline. Findings reveal synergy between vascular and 
neurodegenerative aging markers. Examining NfL or cfPWV alone may miss their 
synergistic effects on cognition.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid-β (Aβ) 
deposition, which triggers oxidative stress and neuronal damage. Atractylenolide 
III (AT-III), a plant-derived monomer with antioxidant properties, has shown 
promise but its neuroprotective effects in AD remain unclear.
METHODS: We established an AD mice model via intracerebroventricular Aβ₁₋₄₂ 
injection and evaluated AT-III's neuroprotective effects using behavioral tests, 
electrophysiological recordings, Western blot, and ELISA. Additionally, we 
assessed AT-III's protective effects against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced 
oxidative stress in Neuro-2 A (N2A) cells.
RESULTS: AT-III mitigated cognitive and long-term potentiation (LTP) deficits 
induced by Aβ1-42. It also reduced oxidative stress by decreasing pro-oxidants 
and increasing anti-oxidants. Furthermore, AT-III activated the nuclear factor 
erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway in the model mice, 
consequently enhancing the expression of Nrf2, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and 
superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD-1). In N2A cells, AT-III significantly attenuated 
H2O2-induced cytotoxicity and oxidative stress, further supporting its role in 
neuroprotection.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that AT-III may exert neuroprotective effects 
through antioxidant properties, thereby ameliorating cognitive impairment 
induced by Aβ1-42. These findings indicate that AT-III could be a potential 
therapeutic agent for AD.

BACKGROUND: A placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase 1a trial examined the 
safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of NNI-362 as well as the 
pharmacodynamic outcome of plasma phosphorylated tau181 (p-tau181).
METHODS: Oral NNI-362 and placebo were randomized in healthy, 
cognitively-unimpaired individuals (ages 50-72) at a 3:1 ratio, with sponsor, 
principal investigator, and subjects all blinded. Plasma levels of p-tau181 were 
determined in the placebo and the two highest arms of 120 and 240 mg NNI-362. 
Plasma biomarker was examined for statistical change from baseline.
RESULTS: NNI-362 treatment was safe and well tolerated in older individuals. 
NNI-362, at the two highest multiple doses, significantly reduced plasma 
p-tau181 levels compared to pretreatment levels (P < 0.0012 to P < 0.0009), 
while no change occurred in placebo groups.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest in older subjects, oral NNI-362 appeared 
safe, well tolerated and reduced plasma p-tau181. Phase 2 studies of NNI-362 are 
warranted for Alzheimer's disease and age-related degenerative disorders.

Neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and Alzheimer's 
dementia (AD) demonstrate an ever-evolving disease continuum. The presymptomatic 
phase of neurodegenerative diseases provides a window of opportunity to detect 
disease-specific changes and abnormalities early on and potentially intervene 
right away, before clinical symptoms occur. Age and sex are key modifiers of the 
presymptomatic phase of neurodegenerative diseases. In presymptomatic MS, 
younger age and male sex are main risk factors for transition to symptomatic MS, 
whereas older age and male sex are important predictors of the direct transition 
from presmyptomatic MS to primary progressive MS. In cognitively unimpaired 
adults, age is the strongest risk factor for AD and the lifetime AD risk 
after>65 years is higher in women versus men. The prevalence and future disease 
severity of AD is further modified by factors such as apolipoprotein Eɛ4, 
ovarian hormones, and menopause in women. Biomarkers are instrumental in 
detecting and monitoring abnormalities and underlying disease mechanisms in 
vivo, that are already present in the presymptomatic phase. Evaluating the 
influence of age and sex on presymptomatic phase of neurodegenerative diseases, 
particularly through biomarkers, contributes to the enhanced patient selection 
for clinical trials, optimization and individualization of patient management 
and development of new therapeutics.

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is the in-between stage between healthy 
cognitive aging and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
As MCI becomes increasingly prevalent in aging populations, there is an urgent 
need for innovative, targeted strategies to slow its progression. Among emerging 
tools, extracellular vesicles (EVs) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have attracted 
growing interest as nanocarrier systems with unique abilities to cross the 
blood-brain barrier (BBB) and deliver therapeutic cargo. This review gathers a 
detailed overview of their biological mechanisms, engineering strategies, and 
current preclinical applications, providing new perspectives on how these 
approaches can potentially delay the progression of MCI. Emphasis is placed on 
integrating these nanotechnologies into the pathological framework of MCI, 
highlighting their dual diagnostic and therapeutic potential. By connecting 
nanomedicine with the pathophysiology of cognitive impairment, this review 
outlines new frontiers in MCI intervention.

INTRODUCTION: Visual perception is a fundamental skill that plays a central role 
in sensing the external environment. Deficits can lead to impairments in 
everyday activities. Visual perception is known to be impaired in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). However, the extent to which visual perception is impaired in mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI), often a prodromal state of AD, has not been 
sufficiently investigated. This study aims to assess visual perceptual abilities 
in people with MCI and mild AD compared with healthy controls. It will also 
investigate whether executive functions, activities of daily living and 
intelligence are affected in this context, providing new insights into the 
research of visual perception together with MCI and mild AD.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: People with MCI, mild AD and healthy controls will be 
assessed for cognitive deficits using the Syndrom-Kurztest (SKT). Visual 
perceptual performance will be assessed using the German version of the 
Developmental Test of Visual Perception-Adolescent and Adult: Second Edition 
(DTVP-A:2; Frostings Entwicklungstest der visuellen Wahrnehmung - Jugendliche 
und Erwachsene 2. Auflage). Activities of daily living will be assessed through 
the Erlangen Test of Activities of Daily Living in Persons with Mild Dementia or 
Mild Cognitive Impairment (ETAM) and the Bayer Activities of Daily Living Scale 
(B-ADL). Executive functions will be measured using the German adaptation of the 
Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Function - Adult (BRIEF-A) and 
intelligence will be assessed using the Matrix Reasoning and Vocabulary Test of 
the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale - Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV). Data analysis 
will involve descriptive analyses, linear regression analyses, multivariate 
analysis of variance, mediation analysis and structural equation modelling.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has received approval from the Ethics 
Committee of Helmut Schmidt University/University of the Federal Armed Forces 
Hamburg, Germany (number: 2023_009). Findings will be disseminated through 
peer-reviewed publications and presentations at national and international 
conferences.

BACKGROUND: Anxiety is prevalent among older adults with mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) and mild Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (ADRD) and 
may contribute to accelerated cognitive decline and increased care partner 
burden. Computerized Anxiety Sensitivity Treatment (CAST) is a novel, CBT-based 
intervention targeting anxiety sensitivity, which has not been widely tested in 
this population.
METHODS: This randomized controlled trial (NCT05748613) will compare CAST to a 
health education control (HEC) in 194 dyads consisting of older adults with 
MCI/mild ADRD and their care partners. Primary outcomes include reductions in 
anxiety sensitivity and anxiety symptoms. Secondary outcomes include measures of 
mental health and well-being symptoms, improved cognitive performance, and 
decreased care partner burden. Participants will be assessed at baseline, during 
two intervention sessions, and follow-ups at 1-, 3-, and 6-months 
post-intervention.
EXPECTED OUTCOMES: CAST will significantly lower anxiety sensitivity (AS) 
post-intervention and reduce anxiety compared to HEC. Secondary hypotheses 
propose that CAST will reduce other mental symptoms and improve cognitive 
functioning more effectively than HEC. Additionally, CAST will alleviate care 
partner distress and improve their quality of life compared to HEC, with the 
secondary hypothesis suggesting that these effects will be mediated by 
reductions in AS in older adults. Furthermore, reductions in AS from pre- to 
post-intervention will account for the effect of CAST on anxiety, and the 
secondary hypothesis suggesting that reductions in interoceptive fear 
conditioning will also contribute to the observed anxiety reduction.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that 
accounts for almost half of all dementia cases globally and is progressively 
increasing. Etiology includes heredity, genetic factors, aging, and nutrition, 
but sex hormones also play a key role. Reliable animal models of AD are the 
basis for gaining insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms of AD and for 
developing and evaluating novel therapeutic strategies for preclinical AD.
NEW METHOD: This study described and evaluated a model mimicking features of 
late-onset AD by combining gonadectomy with bilateral hippocampal dentate gyrus 
Aβ injections in mice.
RESULTS: As demonstrated by the Morris water maze test, Nissl staining, TUNEL, 
and EDU labeling, this method produced the mouse model of AD with decreased 
learning memory capacity accompanied by decreased neuronal function in the 
hippocampus, increased apoptotic neurons in hippocampus CA1 area and decreased 
regenerative neurons in hippocampus dentate gyrus area.
COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: Existing AD models often overlook the 
physiological feature of sex hormone deficiency in late-onset AD and fail to 
fully account for the neuroprotective effects of sex hormones, which may lead to 
false-positive results in neuroprotection-related assessments. The model in this 
study simulates low sex hormone levels through gonadectomy and is combined with 
bilateral hippocampal dentate gyrus injection of Aβ1-42 oligomers, overcoming 
the limitations of single-factor models and more effectively simulating the 
pathophysiological characteristics of sex hormone deficiency and Aβ deposition 
in late-onset AD.
CONCLUSIONS: The model effectively simulated the pathophysiological state of 
late-onset AD. In both sexes, most of these indications of dysfunction were 
significantly more pronounced in gonadectomized animals compared to gonadally 
intact controls.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: In this study, a mouse model of late-onset Alzheimer's 
disease, developed by combining gonadectomy with Aβ injection into the bilateral 
hippocampal dentate gyrus, accurately simulates the pathophysiological processes 
of sex hormone deficiency and Aβ deposition in patients, thereby providing a 
robust platform to explore nervous system structural and functional changes in 
late-onset AD and evaluate potential preventive drugs. Moreover, this 
dual-factor model provides novel insights into the synergistic interaction 
between sex hormone deficiency and Aβ pathology, offering a physiologically 
relevant platform for studying late-onset AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by Aβ accumulation and tau hyperphosphorylation. Calcium 
dysregulation also plays a key role in its progression. As a vital second 
messenger, calcium ions regulate neuronal communication, memory formation, and 
learning, particularly in the hippocampus. Their levels are influenced by 
excitatory signaling, synapse formation, and neurotransmitter release. In AD, 
Ca2+ dyshomeostasis occurs near amyloid plaques, marked by elevated 
intracellular calcium in neurons, microglia, and astrocytes, along with 
increased neuronal activity. Calcium dyshomeostasis promotes neurofibrillary 
tangle formation and amyloid-beta deposition through various molecular and 
signaling pathways. Elevated intracellular calcium accumulation results in 
multiple pathologies associated with AD, such as neuroinflammation, oxidative 
stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, endoplasmic reticulum stress, apoptosis, and 
excitotoxicity through various calcium signaling pathways such as calcineurin 
(CAN), calcium homeostasis modulator 2 (CALHM2), Mitogen-Activated Protein 
Kinase, Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase/ cAMP Response Element-Binding 
Protein (MAP/ERK/CREB), Wnt/β-catenin, Transient Receptor Potential Melastatin 2 
(TRPM2), and Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor pyrin 
domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) pathway. It is crucial to find the gap between 
calcium increase overloads and those associated with the neuropathology of AD. 
Several drugs target calcium signaling pathways and inhibit the disease 
progression in preclinical and clinical studies. The article highlights the 
significance of using therapeutic approaches specifically targeting calcium 
signalling pathways to enhance cognitive performance and decrease the 
progression of AD. Targeting calcium signalling holds promise for addressing the 
multifaceted pathologies of AD that will aid in combating the disease.

Due to complex etiology, a promising approach to find an effective therapy of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) lies in the search for multitarget ligands. Within this 
study, we have identified novel 1,3,5-triazine derivatives that modulate either 
the serotonin 5-HT6 receptor and the fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) enzyme, 
also slightly inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE) or butyrylcholinesterase 
(BChE) enzymes, thus representing pioneering multitarget approach to address key 
pathological mechanisms in AD. Among the synthesized compounds, the 
m-chlorobenzyl- 7 (5-HT6R pKi = 7.59) and the trimethoxybenzyl- 23 (5-HT6R 
pKi = 6.33) derivatives exhibited the most favorable multitarget action, with 
5-HT6R selectivity over other GPCR off-targets. Comprehensive molecular modeling 
provided insights into the compounds interactions with the molecular targets 
considered. In vitro evaluations revealed satisfactory metabolic stability and 
low risks of toxicity, including neurotoxicity. Notably, 23 demonstrated 
significant neuroprotective effects against Aβ1-42-induced toxicity in 
hippocampal model (HT-22). Furthermore, in a Novel Object Recognition (NOR) 
test, both 7 and 23 ameliorated MK-801-induced memory deficits in rats. The 
results indicate the therapeutic potential for these first-in-class dual 
modulators of both, endocannabinoid system and serotonergic neurotransmission, 
to address neurodegenerative diseases such as AD.

Neurodegenerative tauopathies, such as Alzheimer's disease, are closely 
associated with the dysregulation of tau phosphorylation, a process regulated in 
part by the serine/threonine kinase MARK4. In this study, we explored 
phytochemicals derived from Bacopa monnieri as potential natural inhibitors of 
MARK4. Using pressurized liquid extraction with an ethanol-water mixture, we 
efficiently extracted bioactive compounds from Bacopa leaves. LC-MS analysis 
identified 25 distinct phytoconstituents spanning flavonoids, triterpenoids, 
cucurbitacins, sterols, and alkaloids. In silico analysis revealed that several 
compounds, including oroxindin, cucurbitacin B, and bacosine, bind strongly to 
the catalytic pocket of MARK4. Molecular dynamics simulations confirmed their 
stability within the MARK4 active site, with oroxindin demonstrating the most 
favorable thermodynamic and conformational profile. Principal component and free 
energy landscape analyses further supported their capacity to stabilize MARK4 in 
low-energy conformations. Microscale thermophoresis further validated 
high-affinity binding of MARK4 with oroxindin, while other four compounds also 
show strong interaction with MARK4. MTT assays in SH-SY5Y cells confirmed the 
non-cytotoxic nature of all five lead compounds across a concentration range of 
10 nM to 10 μM. Cellular assays revealed a significant reduction in Tau-GFP 
aggregates upon treatment with the compounds, particularly oroxindin. These 
results highlight oroxindin and other Bacopa monnieri phytochemicals as 
promising natural inhibitors of MARK4, with potential to attenuate tau pathology 
in neurodegenerative diseases.

Adults At Risk for Alzheimer Disease: Protocol for Algorithm Development and 
Validation.

BACKGROUND: Given the high prevalence and cost of Alzheimer disease (AD), it is 
crucial to develop equitable interventions to address lifestyle factors 
associated with AD incidence (eg, depression). While lifestyle interventions 
show promise for reducing cognitive decline, culturally sensitive interventions 
are needed to ensure acceptability and engagement. Given the increased risk for 
AD and health care barriers among rural-residing older adults, tailoring 
interventions to align with rural culture and distinct needs is important to 
improve accessibility and adherence.
OBJECTIVE: This protocol aims to develop an intelligent recommendation system 
capable of identifying the optimal therapeutic music components to elicit 
engagement and resonate with diverse rural-residing older adults at risk for AD. 
Aim 1 is to develop culturally inclusive user personas for rural-residing older 
adults to understand their goals and challenges for music-based digital health 
intervention. Aim 2 is to develop knowledge embedding-based machine learning 
(ML) models that use music metadata and survey response data to identify optimal 
therapeutic music components for enhancing engagement and emotional resonance 
for depression among rural-residing older adults at risk for AD. Aim 3 is to 
assess acceptability for personalized therapeutic music sessions and ML-based 
music recommendations with a separate sample.
METHODS: Participants (N=1200) will be aged 55 years or older and residing in 
the United States. In phase 1, participants (n=1000) will receive 5 randomized 
songs and complete a survey to understand the sentiment, cultural relevance, and 
perceived benefit for each song. Brief, researcher-created Likert surveys will 
be used. In phase 2, survey data will be used to develop ML algorithms in 
collaboration with the University of Massachusetts Amherst Center for Data 
Science and Artificial Intelligence. These ML models will be integrated into the 
digital music intervention and tested with a separate sample of 200 
participants. Similar to phase 1, participants will be provided with sets of 
songs generated by the recommendation system based on the target goal (ie, to 
reduce depression). The recommendation accuracy of the ML algorithm will be 
assessed using multiple performance metrics, including root-mean-square error 
and normalized discounted cumulative gain as well as the mean acceptability 
score with a goal of 85% user acceptability.
RESULTS: Participant recruitment is complete for phases 1 and 2 as of June 2025. 
Data analysis for the results of aims 1, 2, and 3 are underway and results are 
expected to be published in the fall of 2025.
CONCLUSIONS: This protocol seeks to use ML to improve the equitability and 
accessibility of a digital lifestyle intervention for AD.

Clitoria mariana L., a medicinal plant widely distributed in Asia, has long been 
used in folk medicine. This study investigates the biomedical potential of its 
methanolic flower extract. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and 
phytochemical analyses revealed the presence of alkaloids, phenolic compounds, 
and flavonoids. The phytoextract elicited significant antioxidant activity, as 
demonstrated by various assays, and displayed broad-spectrum antibacterial 
effects, producing the largest zones of inhibition (ZI) against Staphylococcus 
aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella typhi, supported by 
MIC/MBC (minimum inhibition concentration/minimum bactericidal concentration) 
values indicative of bactericidal action. Notably, the phytoextract demonstrated 
marked cytotoxicity against various cancer cell lines, with the highest potency 
against MCF-7, followed by HeLa, A549, and PC-3, based on IC50 (concentration 
required to inhibit 50%) values. Its anti-inflammatory properties, comparable to 
aspirin (reference standard), increased with concentration. Additionally, the 
phytoextract showed promise in Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment by inhibiting 
AChE (acetylcholinesterase) and BuChE (butyrylcholinesterase) activities more 
effectively than galantamine (GA), the standard drug. The zebrafish embryo assay 
evidenced its excellent biocompatibility. Overall, this study offers the first 
comprehensive phytochemical and pharmacological evaluation of C. mariana's 
methanolic extract, underscoring its potential relevance in managing 
inflammatory conditions.

Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) have a decreased incidence of cancer, 
with a cross-sectional analysis of a nationwide sample of adults finding 21-fold 
higher odds of cancer diagnosis in non-AD individuals compared with those with 
AD. In this study, we demonstrated that mitochondrial localization of 
AD-associated amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) and its cleavage product 
amyloid-β 40, but not mutant APP that lacks a mitochondrial localization signal, 
inhibits lipid stress-mediated hyperactive mitophagy in aging T cells, improving 
their antitumor functions. Growth of melanoma xenograft or carcinogen-induced 
oral cancer models was highly reduced in AD mice. Additionally, adoptive cell 
transfer-based immunotherapy using aging T cells isolated from AD mice 
suppressed tumor growth. The metabolic signature of stress-dependent mitophagy 
in T cells showed fumarate depletion, which was linked to decreased succination 
of Parkin and enhanced mitochondrial damage. Mechanistically, APP interaction 
with the TOMM complex at the outer mitochondrial membrane attenuated trafficking 
of ceramide synthase CerS6 to mitochondria in aging AD T cells, preventing 
ceramide-dependent mitophagy. Thus, APP restored mitochondrial fumarate 
metabolism and Parkin succination, improving antitumor functions of AD T cells 
in vitro and in vivo. Exogenous fumarate supplementation or healthy AD 
mitochondria transfer functionally mimicked the AD/APP phenotype in aging T 
cells, enhancing their antitumor activity to control tumor growth. Moreover, T 
cells isolated from aging donors showed elevated mitophagy with fumarate 
depletion, which was restored in T cells isolated from age-matched patients with 
AD. Together, these findings show that AD protects T cells against 
ceramide-dependent mitophagy and fumarate depletion to enhance antitumor 
functions.
SIGNIFICANCE: The reduced cancer risk in Alzheimer's disease patients is 
mediated by the amyloid-β 40 peptide, which inhibits aging-dependent mitophagy 
in T cells to improve antitumor immunity. See related commentary by Bieberich, 
p. 3579.

Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), side effects of anti-amyloid drugs 
seen in magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, are a major safety concern in 
patients with Alzheimer's disease. We developed an antibody transport vehicle 
(ATV) targeting transferrin receptor (TfR) for brain delivery of anti-amyloid-β 
protein (anti-Aβ) using asymmetrical Fc mutations (ATVcisLALA) that mitigates 
TfR-related liabilities and retains effector function when bound to Aβ. 
Administration of ATVcisLALA:Aβ in mice exhibited broad brain distribution and 
enhanced parenchymal plaque target engagement. This biodistribution reduced 
ARIA-like lesions and vascular inflammation. Taken together, ATVcisLALA has the 
potential to improve the next generation of Aβ immunotherapy through enhanced 
biodistribution mediated by transport across the blood-brain barrier.

Geroscience: A Translational Review.

IMPORTANCE: The incidence of stroke, heart failure, dementia, many cancers, 
coronary artery disease, and physical disability rise exponentially with age. 
Geroscience is a relatively new discipline that aims to define and modify 
aging-related biologic pathways, slow age-related disability, prevent 
age-related diseases, and increase disability-free survival.
OBSERVATIONS: Medical therapies typically alter biologic pathways to treat or 
prevent specific diseases. For example, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A 
reductase inhibitors (statins) are cholesterol-lowering medications used to 
prevent development and progression of atherosclerosis. However, disease-focused 
treatments do not alter aging's effects on disease and declining function (eg, 
statins do not significantly reduce noncardiovascular mortality or cancer). In 
animal models, treatments can alter aging's effect on disease. For example, in 
mice, caloric restriction increases mean lifespan from 10% to 40% compared with 
mice fed ad libitum and favorably affects multiple cellular pathways implicated 
in aging including nutrient sensing, protein synthesis, autophagy, and 
inflammation. In adults with obesity and diabetes, compared with non-caloric 
restriction intervention groups, randomization to receive caloric restriction 
was associated with a 15% reduction in all-cause mortality and a lower incidence 
of weight-related chronic diseases. Rapamycin, a drug approved to suppress 
posttransplant organ rejection, increased mouse median lifespan by 249 days in 
females and 154 days in males. A rapamycin analogue, everolimus, improved 
antibody titers to influenza vaccine in older adults. In humans, senescent cells 
increase in abundance with age and are characterized by growth arrest, apoptosis 
resistance, and an altered secretome (the set of proteins secreted by a cell 
into the extracellular space). A greater abundance of senescent cells is 
associated with more physical impairments and increased mortality. Reducing the 
number of these cells in animal models extends lifespan and improves physical 
function, such as grip strength and mobility, and cardiac ejection fraction. 
However, potential health benefits of reducing senescent cells in humans remain 
unclear.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Therapies that inhibit aging biology, such as caloric 
restriction, metformin, senolytics, or rapalogs, may slow the development and 
progression of disease and functional decline in humans.

IMPORTANCE: Hippocampal sclerosis (HS), defined as severe neuronal loss and 
astrogliosis in coronal sections of the midhippocampus cornu ammonis 1 or 
subiculum, is an important pathology associated with limbic-predominant 
age-related transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 encephalopathy 
neuropathological change (LATE-NC), Alzheimer disease, and dementia. The 
association of diet with HS or HS with LATE-NC in humans remains underexplored.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of the Mediterranean-Dietary 
Approaches to Stop Hypertension Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) 
diet with HS and HS with LATE-NC.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study included autopsied 
participants from the ongoing Rush Memory and Aging Project cohort study. 
Participants with dietary and neuropathological data from 2004 to 2024 were 
included. Data were analyzed from April 3, 2024, to May, 13, 2025.
EXPOSURES: Mean MIND diet scores (range, 0-15; higher score indicates better 
diet), computed from all validated food frequency questionnaires administered 
annually for up to 18 years before death.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The outcomes of interest were presence of HS, 
assessed using hematoxylin and eosin staining, and presence of LATE-NC, detected 
by TDP-43 immunohistochemistry in 8 brain regions. For a subset of 300 
participants, hippocampal neuronal loss severity was scored using a 
semiquantitative scale from 0, indicating none, to 5, severe, and categorized as 
none to mild, moderate, and severe neuronal loss.
RESULTS: Among 809 participants (mean [SD] age at death, 91.3 [6.1] years; 538 
[72%] female; mean [SD] follow-up, 7.2 [4.4] years), HS was present in 82 
(10.1%) participants; 71 participants (9%) had both HS and LATE-NC, and in the 
scored subset, 43 participants (14%) had moderate and 35 participants (12%) had 
severe hippocampal neuronal loss. Higher MIND diet scores were associated with 
lower odds of HS (odds ratio [OR], 0.78; 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.95) and HS with 
LATE-NC (OR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.97) after controlling for age at death, 
sex, education, total calories, APOE-ε4 status, AD, and vascular pathologies. In 
mediation analyses, the MIND diet was associated with less dementia at the time 
of death (β = -0.26; 95% CI, -0.36 to -0.15; P < .001), with an indirect 
association of 21% through HS (β = -0.05; 95% CI, -0.10 to -0.01; P = .02). A 
higher MIND diet score was associated with less hippocampal neuronal loss (P for 
trend = .01).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study of autopsied participants found 
that MIND diet adherence during follow-up was associated with a lower likelihood 
of HS, HS with LATE-NC, and hippocampal neuronal loss. The association of diet 
with dementia was partially mediated by its association with HS. These findings 
suggest that the MIND diet may reduce adverse brain health outcomes.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents major cognitive and memory decline in the 
elderly patients. Although Montelukast has traditionally been used for the 
treatment of asthma, its role in prevention of neuropathological changes and 
memory decline in AD have recently been reported in literature. However, the 
brain availability through oral administration of Montelukast is limited due to 
its poor blood-brain barrier permeation. This study has highlighted that the 
intranasal administration of Montelukast can provide a considerable brain 
bioavailability of Montelukast in mice. In addition, intranasal administration 
of Montelukast showed a significant improvement of spatial and cognitive memory, 
prevention of Aβ accumulation, astrocyte activation, along with improved redox 
balance and neuronal density in the hippocampus and cortex regions in the 
amyloid-beta1-42 (Aβ1-42)-induced animal model of AD. These neuroprotective 
effects were found to be better through intranasal administration of Montelukast 
in comparison to its oral administration at the equivalent dose. These results 
suggest that Montelukast may be administered through intranasal route to achieve 
a significant therapeutic effect in the pathophysiology of AD.

This study compared the impact of an immersive virtual reality (VR)-based 
reminiscence therapy program with a similar non-immersive intervention on 
neuropsychiatric symptoms and quality of life of people with dementia. A pilot 
randomized controlled trial was conducted with 14 individuals with mild to 
moderately severe dementia, who participated in eight biweekly individual 
reminiscence sessions conducted by trained researchers, in which 360° videos of 
locations with personal relevance were displayed. Participants were randomly 
divided in two groups: one receiving therapy using VR headsets to promote an 
immersive experience while the other watched the videos on a monitor 
(non-immersive approach). Assessment was conducted pre- and post-intervention 
using the Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease Scale to measure quality of 
life and the Geriatric Depression Scale, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale and 
Neuropsychiatric Inventory to evaluate neuropsychiatric symptoms. Adverse 
simulation-related symptoms were also assessed with the Simulator Sickness 
Questionnaire. There were no statistically significant differences between 
groups at baseline, regarding sociodemographic variables and level of dementia 
progression. The results indicated significant improvements post-intervention in 
quality of life from caregivers' perspectives in the non-immersive group (p < 
.05) but not in the VR group. Differences in overall neuropsychiatric symptoms, 
depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms between assessments were 
non-significant. However, slight improvements were visible, particularly 
regarding anxiety. Only a few instances of mild cybersickness symptoms were 
reported in both groups. In this study, pre- and post-intervention comparisons 
do not support the added value of using immersive VR in reminiscence therapy for 
people living with dementia. This raises questions about whether VR is 
worthwhile compared to traditional approaches, and how to better capture 
potential benefits of immersion with VR, which may be more evident considering 
in-session engagement and well-being or longer intervention programs.

INTRODUCTION: Vascular comorbidities are modifiable contributors to cognitive 
impairment and Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet brain health outcomes are rarely 
evaluated in cardiovascular patients.
METHODS: This study prospectively evaluated cognition and AD pathology in 162 
community-dwelling adults with asymptomatic cardiovascular disease who did not 
have a clinical diagnosis of dementia or cognitive impairment.
RESULTS: Twenty-nine percent of the cohort had Montreal Cognitive Assessment 
(MoCA) scores indicative of cognitive impairment or dementia after adjusting for 
age, sex, and education based on National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center 
normative data. AD blood biomarker phosphorylated tau217 was elevated in 55% of 
the cohort, significantly associated with decreased MoCA scores (β = -1.46, 95% 
confidence interval [CI] -2.53 to -0.39, p < 0.01), and accurately 
differentiated cognitive impairment (area under the curve 0.94, 95% CI 
0.88-0.99).
DISCUSSION: This level of undiagnosed cognitive impairment and AD pathology 
exceeds what would be expected in the general population and highlights a 
potential need for screening and future work to better identify treatment 
options.
HIGHLIGHTS: Brain health outcomes are rarely evaluated in vascular patients. One 
hundred sixty-two adults with asymptomatic cardiovascular disease but without 
diagnoses of cognitive impairment or dementia were evaluated. Phosphorylated 
tau217 accurately differentiated cognitive impairment in patients with 
cardiovascular disease. High levels of cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's 
disease pathology are greatly underdiagnosed in the cardiovascular population.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by cognitive decline and neuronal damage. Cadmium exposure has 
been implicated in AD pathogenesis. This study aimed to investigate the 
potential therapeutic effects of Ebixa (memantine), Ginkgo biloba, and selenium 
in a cadmium-induced rat model of AD. Adult male Wistar rats were divided into 
six groups: control, control + Ginkgo-treated, cadmium chloride (CdCl2), 
CdCl2 + Ebixa-treated, CdCl2 + Ginkgo, and CdCl2 + Ginkgo + Selenium. Behavioral 
tests, including the Morris water maze and passive avoidance learning, were 
conducted. Additionally, biochemical analysis of acetylcholine (Ach), choline 
acetyltransferase (AchT), and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) levels in brain 
homogenates was performed. Histological sections of the cerebral cortex, 
cerebellum, and medulla were examined. Apoptotic assessment was conducted using 
the TUNEL assay. CdCl2 exposure resulted in cognitive deficits, reduced Ach 
levels, and neuronal damage, mirroring AD-like characteristics. Ebixa treatment 
improved spatial memory behavior as well as Ach, AchT and AChE levels in the 
brain. Ginkgo biloba and selenium co-administration increased the number of 
crossings in the Morris water maze test, suggesting memory preservation. 
Additionally, Ginkgo biloba exhibited potential cholinergic system protective 
effects. Histological analysis revealed neuroprotection in the cerebral cortex, 
cerebellum, and medulla. TUNEL assays demonstrated anti-apoptotic effects of 
both Ebixa and the combination of Ginkgo and selenium. Ebixa, Ginkgo biloba, and 
selenium showed promise in mitigating cognitive deficits and preserving neuronal 
structures in a CdCl2-induced AD manifestation in rats. These findings provide 
insights into potential therapeutic strategies for AD and warrant further 
investigation.

Background Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
mainly characterized by progressive cognitive decline and memory loss. 
Identifying candidate biomarkers before the clinical onset of AD is crucial for 
enabling earlier diagnosis and timely therapeutic intervention. Among different 
molecular targets, N-acylsphingosine amidohydrolase 2 (ASAH2), a key enzyme in 
ceramide metabolism, has been linked to many neurodegenerative diseases, 
including AD. This study investigates ASAH2 expression in human serum and AD 
mouse models to explore its potential as an early biomarker and to understand 
its involvement in AD progression. Methods The protein levels in the serum of 
pre-AD, mild cognitive impairment, and control patients were measured using the 
SOMAscan assay platform (SomaLogic Inc., CO, USA) to identify potential 
candidate biomarkers for preclinical AD. ASAH2 expression at different 
Alzheimer's stages of triple transgenic (3x-TG) Alzheimer's mice organs and 
tissues was analyzed. Human serums and hepatoblastoma cells (also referred to as 
HepG2 cells) were stained and quantified with ASAH2, membrane, and vesicle 
trafficking proteins. Results We found that neutral ceramidase (ASAH2/ASAH2B) 
and sortilin-related VPS10 domain-containing receptor 2 (SORCS2) were 
significantly elevated in the serum of individuals who later developed 
Alzheimer's dementia. Similarly, 3x-TG AD mice showed an increased ASAH2 
expression at three months, followed by a marked decline at 14 months compared 
to age-matched non-3x-TG controls. In non-3x-TG mice, ASAH2 was highly expressed 
in visceral organs such as the heart, liver, kidneys, lungs, and stomach, but 
was nearly absent in the brain. Ingenuity pathway analysis revealed 
dysregulation in lipid trafficking and inflammatory pathways. Additionally, we 
observed elevated lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) and reduced 
levels of filamin A and RAB7 (a member of the RAS oncogene family) in the pre-AD 
mild cognitive impairment group. Conclusion Our findings suggest that ASAH2 may 
play a significant role in the pathogenesis of AD, potentially contributing to 
early molecular changes that precede clinical symptoms. In addition, the 
identification of a subgroup of lipid- and membrane-associated proteins provides 
promising candidates for predictive biomarkers that could facilitate earlier 
diagnosis and offer new insights into the mechanisms underlying disease 
progression and possible therapeutic targets for AD prevention.

The brain contains approximately 100 billion neurons and over 200 billion glial 
cells, which are integral to the neuronal networks that support normal brain 
function in the central nervous system. The complexity of the brain makes the 
diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative disease particularly challenging. 
Neuroinflammation and neuronal cell death contribute to the development of 
neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia. Dementia refers to a decline in 
memory and thinking ability, affecting approximately 55 million people 
worldwide. Owing to the association of multiple factors, including amyloid-β 
plaque, tau-fibrillary tangles, neuroinflammation, nutritional defects, and 
genetic mutations, the exact cause of the most common type of dementia, 
Alzheimer's disease, remains elusive. These multiple factors may cause damage to 
neurons and glial cells, leading to neurodegeneration. Very few therapeutics are 
available for neurodegenerative diseases due to the limited understanding of 
their pathogenesis, resulting in the lack of biomarkers and drug targets. Recent 
attention has shifted toward addressing modifiable risk factors such as 
unhealthy diets and lifestyles to delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease. 
Unhealthy diets that consist of saturated fatty acids and refined sugars, with 
other multiple risk factors, increase neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, 
furthering cognitive decline and progression of neurodegeneration. Mitigating 
these risk factors with antioxidants, anti-inflammatory-based nutrition, and 
multidomain lifestyle intervention, which may include physical exercise, 
cognitive stimulation, and social engagement, may delay the development of 
neurodegenerative diseases and cognitive decline. In this review, we focus on 
the role of neuroinflammation in contributing to neurodegeneration and dietary 
influence in Alzheimer's disease.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major neurodegenerative disorder that affects more 
than 55 million people, with an incidence that is projected to triple by 2050. 
Despite continuous advancements in the field, reliable treatment and early 
detection strategies remain elusive. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a major 
role in cellular communication throughout the body. In this study, we assessed 
the cargo of neuronal-specific EVs for their potential as AD biomarkers. We 
isolated EVs released from iPSC-derived excitatory glutamatergic neurons 
generated from eight AD patients (ADiNEVs) and six healthy controls (iNEVs). We 
performed RNA-sequencing and identified significant differences in RNA cargo 
between ADiNEVs and iNEVs. Notably, fewer small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) were found 
in ADiNEVs. RNA transcripts significantly more abundant in ADiNEVs included 
MT-CO1, PRR32 and IGSF8 messenger RNAs. We also observed fewer XIST long 
noncoding RNAs and miR-7-5p microRNA content in ADiNEVs. These findings suggest 
that precision medicine approaches, such as characterising the content of EVs 
from a patient's own cells, could advance early detection and management of AD.

INTRODUCTION: Mathematical models serve as essential tools to investigate brain 
aging, the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its progression. By studying 
the representation of the complex dynamics of brain aging processes, such as 
amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition, tau tangles, neuro-inflammation, and neuronal 
death. Sensitivity analyses provide a powerful framework for identifying the 
underlying mechanisms that drive disease progression. In this study, we present 
the first local sensitivity analysis of a recent and comprehensive multiscale 
ODE-based model of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) that originates from our group. As 
such, it is one of the most complex model that captures the multifactorial 
nature of AD, incorporating neuronal, pathological, and inflammatory processes 
at the nano, micro and macro scales. This detailed framework enables realistic 
simulation of disease progression and identification of key biological 
parameters that influence system behavior. Our analysis identifies the key 
drivers of disease progression across patient profiles, providing insight into 
targeted therapeutic strategies.
METHODS: We investigated a recent ODE-based model composed of 19 variables and 
75 parameters, developed by our group, to study Alzheimer's disease dynamics. We 
performed single- and paired-parameter sensitivity analyses, focusing on three 
key outcomes: neural density, amyloid beta plaques, and tau proteins.
RESULTS: Our findings suggest that the parameters related to glucose and insulin 
regulation could play an important role in neurodegeneration and cognitive 
decline. Second, the parameters that have the most important impact on cognitive 
decline are not completely the same depending on sex and APOE status.
DISCUSSION: These results underscore the importance of incorporating a 
multifactorial approach tailored to demographic characteristics when considering 
strategies for AD treatment. This approach is essential to identify the factors 
that contribute significantly to neural loss and AD progression.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing global challenge, representing the most 
common neurodegenerative disorder and affecting millions of lives. As life 
expectancy continues to rise and populations expand, the number of individuals 
coping with the cognitive declines caused by AD is projected to double in the 
coming years. By 2050, we may see over 115 million people diagnosed with this 
devastating condition. Unfortunately, while we currently lack effective cures, 
there are preventative measures that can slow disease progression in symptomatic 
patients. Thus, research has shifted toward early detection and intervention for 
AD in recent years. With technological advances, we are now harnessing large 
datasets and more efficient, minimally invasive methods for diagnosis and 
treatment. This review highlights critical demographic insights, health 
conditions that increase the risk of developing AD, and lifestyle factors in 
midlife that can potentially trigger its onset. Additionally, we delve into the 
promising role of plant-based metabolites and their sources, which may help 
delay the disease's progression. The innovative multi-omics research is 
transforming our understanding of AD. This approach enables comprehensive data 
analysis from diverse cell types and biological processes, offering possible 
biomarkers of this disease's mechanisms. We present the latest advancements in 
genomics, transcriptomics, Epigenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, including 
significant progress in gene editing technologies. When combined with machine 
learning and artificial intelligence, multi-omics analysis becomes a powerful 
tool for uncovering the complexities of AD pathogenesis. We also explore current 
trends in the application of radiomics and machine learning, emphasizing how 
integrating multi-omics data can transform our approach to AD research and 
treatment. Together, these pioneering advancements promise to develop more 
effective preventive and therapeutic strategies soon.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common and costly chronic progressive 
neurodegenerative disorder, with the highest impact on public health worldwide. 
Pathological hallmarks of AD include progressive cognitive decline and memory 
impairment, dominantly mediated by oxidative neurodegeneration. Oxidative stress 
is commonly recognized as a key factor in the pathophysiological progression of 
AD. Despite significant advancements, a definitive and effective therapeutic 
intervention for AD remains elusive. In this study, we investigate the 
neuroprotective potential of ambroxol (Amb), known for its potent 
anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Given ambroxol's potential 
neuroprotective effects, we explore the underlying molecular mechanisms, 
explicitly examining its role in attenuating scopolamine-induced oxidative 
stress-mediated activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, as well 
as its modulation of Akt and glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3β) signaling, 
which is a key contributor to neuroinflammation, synaptic dysfunction and 
neurodegeneration. AD pathology is induced by scopolamine administration, 
leading to excessive lipid peroxidation (LPO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
generation, which leads to a decline in critical antioxidant proteins, including 
nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). 
However, ambroxol treatment effectively attenuated oxidative stress by reducing 
the production of reactive oxidative species while restoring the expression of 
key antioxidant proteins. Similarly, ambroxol attenuated oxidative 
stress-induced JNK activation and modulated Akt and GSK-3β alterations. 
Immunofluorescence and western blot analyses revealed that ambroxol attenuated 
reactive gliosis by suppressing the expression of GFAP and Iba-1, alongside the 
downregulation of key pro-inflammatory mediators, such as IL-1β, TNF-α, and 
phosphorylated NF-κB (p-p65). Scopolamine also compromised synaptic integrity 
and induced deficits in memory formation and spatial learning. In contrast, 
ambroxol promoted synaptic integrity by upregulating the expression of SNAP-23 
and PSD-95, thereby ameliorating scopolamine-induced impairments in spatial 
learning and memory.

Tau and tauopathies across primate species: implications for modeling 
neurodegenerative disorders.

Tauopathies are neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the abnormal 
accumulation and aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. They can be 
primary or secondary depending on whether tau inclusions are the predominant 
pathology (e.g.: frontotemporal dementia related to tau) or are found with other 
proteinopathies (e.g.: Alzheimer's disease), respectively. Currently, there are 
no effective treatments to prevent or slow down progressive tau accumulation. 
Animal models play a critical role in the efforts to unravel the mechanisms 
leading to tauopathies and identifying therapeutic targets. Nonhuman primates 
(NHPs) present several advantages for the study of tauopathies, as they have 
complex neuroanatomy and behavior that resembles human traits, and their tau 
gene and protein are highly conserved. Moreover, aged NHPs, like humans, can 
present various tau inclusions in their brains, although whether NHPs can 
develop human-like tau-related neurodegenerative disorders is currently debated. 
The main goal of this review is to analyze available reports on tau pathologies 
and models of tauopathies in NHPs considering the complexity of the tau protein 
and associated tau pathologies. Here, we first summarize current available 
information on human and NHP tau under physiological conditions in order to 
highlight species differences and gaps in knowledge. We then analyze reports on 
tau pathologies in aged NHPs compared to human aging and tauopathy, followed by 
an evaluation of current and emerging NHP models of tauopathy. Lastly, we 
discuss the practical and ethical challenges of doing tauopathy research in 
NHPs, and how to best leverage it to ultimately find solutions for patients with 
these disorders.

BackgroundDementia is characterized by a deterioration in cognitive functions 
that impacts everyday tasks and overall life quality, with Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) being the most prevalent form. As dementia progresses, cognitive 
rehabilitation, often utilized in conjunction with telemedicine, offers 
significant support via targeted interventions that enhance autonomy and overall 
quality of life (QoL).ObjectiveThis systematic review aims to explore the 
potential and barriers of telemedicine-based cognitive stimulation and training 
programs for individuals with dementia and mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI).MethodsStudies were identified from an online search of PubMed, Web of 
Science, Embase, PsychINFO, and Scopus databases conducted up to 19 February 
2025. This systematic review has been registered on PROSPERO under the following 
number: CRD42024615619.ResultsThe studies establish that digital health 
interventions and telehealth approaches add to the improvement in cognitive 
rehabilitation among patients with dementia and MCI, by indicating striking 
improvements not only in cognitive functioning but also in increased support for 
caregivers. The higher adherence and satisfaction rates with such interventions 
can be attributed to telemedicine itself and newer technologies such as virtual 
reality (VR) and transcranial direct current stimulation, which can provide 
options for personalized and accessible care in neurodegenerative disease 
management.ConclusionsTelemedicine-based cognitive rehabilitation in dementia 
patients, not only achieves improved cognitive functioning but also a better QoL 
and reduced caregiver burden. Further studies are needed to ensure equal 
implementation and long-term sustainability of these interventions, possibly 
with the inclusion of newer technologies such as VR and neuromodulation.

BackgroundHypertension (HTN) is a major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
and related dementias. Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) medications, including 
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor 
blockers (ARBs), have been proposed to mitigate cognitive decline, but evidence 
remains inconsistent.ObjectiveCompare global cognition over time among ARB, 
ACEI, and non-RAS drug users.MethodsData from the Rush Memory and Aging Project 
(1997-2006) included 2019 participants. Global cognition was assessed using a 
composite z-score of 19 cognitive tests. Participants were categorized by 
medication use: ARB, ACEI, or non-RAS. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was 
performed to compare cognitive outcomes over 9 years, adjusting for baseline 
cognition, social determinants, and medical factors. Subgroup analyses evaluated 
cognitive domains and the impact of HTN.ResultsAt baseline, ARB and ACEI users 
had more vascular risk factors and medical conditions than non-RAS users. At 9 
years, ARB users had slightly better global cognitive outcomes compared to ACEI 
(LS-mean difference: 0.015, 95% CI [-0.175, 0.205]) and non-RAS users (LS-mean 
difference: 0.06, 95% CI [-0.11, 0.23]), though differences were not 
statistically significant. ACEI users showed significant improvement in working 
memory compared to non-RAS users (LS-mean: 0.157, 95% CI [0.002, 0.313]). Among 
participants without HTN, ACEI use was associated with significantly reduced 
cognitive decline compared to non-RAS use.ConclusionsARBs may benefit global 
cognitive function, while ACEIs may yield improvements in specific domains like 
working memory. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and explore 
the impact of drug characteristics such as blood-brain-barrier penetration.

The accumulation of toxic amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregates in the brain underlies 
neuronal death and subsequent irreversible neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). Currently, optimized theranostic probes targeting Aβ aggregates 
are still rare. Herein, we synthesized a series of tetraphenylethylene (TPE) 
derivatives for the selective recognition and photo-oxygenation of Aβ 
aggregates. Among them, TPE-yne-Indo with a strong electron-withdrawing group 
(benzo[e]indolium) and an electron-donating group (N,N-dimethylaniline) can 
selectively recognize Aβ aggregates in solution (Kd = 310.5 nM, S/N = 6.1) and 
mapping Aβ plaques in brain slices. Theoretical calculations indicated that 
TPE-yne-Indo engaged in hydrophobic interactions with the amino acid residues 
Val-18 (V), Ala-21 (A), and His-13 (H) of Aβ. Notably, the binding with Aβ 
aggregates bestowed TPE-yne-Indo with higher reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
generation ability, boosting the photodynamic oxidation of Aβ aggregates. 
Furthermore, therapeutic nanocomposite with the lactoferrin receptor ligand 
(MSN@Lf&TPE-yne-Indo) was prepared to facilitate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) 
crossing process. In vivo assays showed that MSN@Lf&TPE-yne-Indo can selectively 
stain Aβ plaques and reduce Aβ deposition in the brain of APP/PS1 mice, 
alleviating symptoms of cognitive impairment and memory loss. This study 
provides a promising tool for the early diagnosis and treatment of AD.

BACKGROUND: Huanglian Jiedu Decoction (HLJDD) is a representative formula for 
clearing heat and removing toxins, and some basic studies indicated that it can 
improve the learning cognitive ability of Alzheimer's disease (AD) mice, but the 
underlying molecular mechanism of its improvement in AD mice is still unclear, 
therefore, this paper delves into the mechanism of HLJDD to improve AD.
PURPOSE: This study aims to investigate whether HLJDD can improve the 
"central-peripheral" inflammatory microenvironment in APP/PS1 mice, and to 
explore its relationship with gut microbiota and NLRP3 inflammatory vesicles 
activation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this paper, the fingerprint of HLJDD was established 
by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and the components of HLJDD 
were characterized by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-time-of-flight 
mass spectrometry (UPLC-O-TOF/MS). The potential signaling pathways of HLJDD 
against AD were preliminarily investigated through network pharmacology. 
Behavioral assessment, histopathological staining, immunofluorescence staining, 
immunohistochemical staining, and detection of central and peripheral 
inflammatory factors were used to explore the improvement of AD by HLJDD, in 
addition to which we examined the gut microbiota and expression of relevant 
inflammatory proteins.
RESULTS: In this study, 137 chemical constituents, including flavonoids, 
terpenoids, and alkaloids, were first identified in HLJDD by HPLC fingerprinting 
and UPLC-Q-TOF/MS. In addition, 49 components were found in the brain tissue of 
APP/PS1 mice and 48 components were found in the plasma of APP/PS1 mice. Network 
pharmacology concluded that the relevant pathways for HLJDD treatment of AD 
include inflammatory pathways. We found that HLJDD was effective in improving 
the learning memory ability of APP/PS1 mice by in vivo mouse behavioral 
performance. Histopathological results showed that HLJDD had the effect of 
reducing AD-like pathological damage, and also found that HLJDD could 
significantly reduce the proportion of M1 type microglia and A1 type astrocytes, 
and increase the proportion of M2 type microglia and A2 type astrocytes, and the 
treatment of HLJDD also suppressed the infiltration of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells in 
the brain, and inhibited Aβ deposition and reduced the expression of 
inflammatory factors in the brain, and alleviated central neuroinflammation. In 
addition, it was also found that HLJDD was able to reduce the expression of 
inflammatory factors in the peripheral blood and inhibit the peripheral immune 
response, and the results of gut microbiota also showed changes in gut 
microbiota after HLJDD treatment and verified the expression of inflammatory 
vesicle-associated proteins in the intestines, with significant upregulation of 
the expression of NLRP3, caspase-1, and ASC proteins in the model group, and 
significant downregulation of ZO-1 and occludin proteins, and reversal of the 
above changes after HLJDD intervention.
CONCLUSION: Therefore, it is hypothesized that HLJDD improves the 
"central-peripheral" inflammatory microenvironment in APP/PS1 mice by inhibiting 
the activation of NLRP3 inflammatory vesicles mediated by gut microbiota.

After decades of disappointment, three disease-modifying therapies for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been approved since 2021. Burgeoning clinical data 
on these amyloid β-protein (Aβ) targeting drugs validate the amyloid cascade 
hypothesis as a molecular roadmap for the development of yet more effective 
therapeutics and offer a template for drugging other AD-associated 
aggregation-prone proteins. While there remains much to be learned about the 
molecular pathology of AD, the current state of knowledge is sufficient to 
expedite the delivery of new drugs. Mindful of the urgent need of patients, we 
recommend prioritizing efforts in four directions: finishing the job on Aβ, 
accelerating and diversifying efforts on tau, and expanding discovery on 
apolipoprotein E and ⍺-synuclein. For each target, we explain the scientific 
premise, current efforts, and possible new approaches. In the short- and 
medium-term, we advocate focusing on the technical innovations required to 
better drug these already well validated targets. While the focus of this review 
is on expediating development of monotherapies, the subsequent approval of such 
agents will enable add-on or combination approaches best suited to individual 
patients.

BACKGROUND: Our limited understanding of dementia's complex pathogenesis 
confines treatment options primarily to symptom management rather than targeting 
underlying disease processes, underscoring the need for innovative treatment and 
preventive strategies. This study aimed to examine the relationship between 
optic neuritis (ON), an autoimmune inflammatory condition of the optic nerve, 
and the risk of developing dementia.
METHODS: This nationwide, population-based cohort study was conducted in Korea, 
analyzing a cohort of 15,286 ON patients newly diagnosed between 2010 and 2017 
who were age and sex matched against 76,430 controls without ON. Primary 
outcomes were incident cases of Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, or other 
types of dementia. Cox proportional hazards regression models were employed to 
assess the association between ON and dementia risk after adjusting for 
demographic characteristics, lifestyle factors, and other comorbidities. 
Dementia risk was assessed through hazard ratios (HRs), with an average 
follow-up period of 3.06 years.
RESULTS: ON patients shows greater risks of all-cause dementia (HR: 1.258) and 
Alzheimer's disease (HR: 1.264). Associations between ON and dementia are 
prominent in younger patients and current smokers.
CONCLUSION: This research suggests that autoimmunity, particularly in the form 
of ON, may significantly contribute to dementia development. This study implies 
that younger ON patients who smoke could be at a high risk of developing 
dementia, emphasizing the need for preventative strategies and additional 
research to establish causality. This work broadens the scope of known dementia 
risk factors and opens new avenues for research into autoimmune mechanisms as 
targets for therapeutic intervention.

Plain Language Summary: This study investigated whether people with optic 
neuritis, an inflammation of the eye’s optic nerve often caused by autoimmune 
responses, have a higher risk of developing dementia later in life. Researchers 
analyzed health records of over 91,000 Korean adults aged 40 and older, 
comparing those with and without optic neuritis over a 12-year period. The 
results showed that people with optic neuritis had a significantly higher risk 
of developing all-cause dementia, particularly Alzheimer’s disease. This 
suggests that autoimmune processes affecting the optic nerve might also impact 
brain health. These findings highlight a potential link between autoimmunity and 
neurodegeneration, which could help doctors identify at-risk patients earlier 
and develop better prevention strategies for dementia.

BACKGROUND: Lead (Pb) exposure is a recognized environmental risk factor for 
cognitive decline and may aggravate Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology through 
hypertension-related mechanisms. However, the specific role of mineralocorticoid 
receptor (MR) signaling in this process remains unclear.
OBJECTIVES: This study investigated whether Pb-induced hypertension exacerbates 
amyloid pathology via MR activation, and evaluated the therapeutic effects of 
amlodipine and spironolactone in an AD mouse model.
METHODS: APPSwDI transgenic mice were exposed to Pb acetate (25 mg/kg/day) for 8 
weeks, with or without concurrent treatment with amlodipine or spironolactone. 
Cognitive behavior, blood pressure, renal function, neuroinflammation, oxidative 
stress, and brain amyloid deposition were assessed.
RESULTS: Pb exposure significantly increased systolic blood pressure, impaired 
cognition, elevated IL-1β and IL-6 levels, and enhanced brain amyloid burden. MR 
expression in brain tissue was upregulated following Pb exposure. Both 
spironolactone and amlodipine improved cognitive performance and reduced 
neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. Spironolactone more effectively 
suppressed MR expression and amyloid deposition, though some group differences 
did not reach statistical significance.
CONCLUSIONS: Pb exacerbates AD-like pathology through MR-related hypertensive 
and inflammatory mechanisms. MR antagonism by spironolactone offers greater 
neuroprotection than calcium channel blockade in this context. These findings 
suggest that targeting MR signaling may be a promising therapeutic strategy for 
environmentally induced AD risk.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) presents a pressing global health challenge, demanding 
improved strategies for early detection and understanding its progression. In 
this study, we address this need by employing survival analysis techniques to 
predict transition time from Cognitive Normal (CN) to Mild Cognitive Impairment 
(MCI) in elderly individuals, considering the predictive value of baseline 
comorbidities. Leveraging data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) and Australian Imaging, Biomarker & Lifestyle Flagship Study 
of Ageing (AIBL) databases, we construct feature sets encompassing demographics, 
cognitive scores, and comorbidities. Various machine learning and deep learning 
methods for survival analysis are employed. Our top-performing model, fast 
random forest, achieves a concordance index of 0.84 when considering all feature 
modalities, with comorbidity data emerging as a significant predictor. The top 
features identified by the best-performing model include one demographic feature 
(age), seven cognitive scores (ADAS13, RAVLT learning, FAQ, ADAS11, RAVLT 
immediate, CDRSB, ADASQ4), and two comorbidities (Endocrine & Metabolic, Renal & 
Genitourinary). Age is highlighted as the most influential predictor, while 
cognitive scores are crucial indicators of Alzheimer's disease. External 
validation against the AIBL dataset affirms the robustness of our approach. 
Overall, our study contributes to a deeper understanding of the role of baseline 
comorbidities in AD risk prediction and emphasizes the importance of 
incorporating comprehensive feature assessment in clinical practice for early 
diagnosis and personalized treatment planning.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive cognitive decline, 
amyloid plaque accumulation, synaptic dysfunction, and neuroinflammation. This 
study reports the therapeutic potential of 
(S)-4-amino-5,5-difluoro-N'-methyl-N'-phenylpentanehydrazide hydrochloride 
(RA-058HM), a novel compound, in ameliorating these pathological features of AD 
in the 5xFAD mouse model. RA-058HM was administered orally for 8 weeks, and its 
multi-target effects - including relief from neuroinflammation, normalization of 
synaptic transmission, reduction of amyloidogenesis (plaque and soluble 
oligomers, as well as BACE1 levels), and rescue of cognitive function-were 
evaluated. To our knowledge, RA-058HM is the first compound to demonstrate 
simultaneous modulation of these key pathways in the 5xFAD model, highlighting 
its potential as a comprehensive disease-modifying therapy for AD. Behavioural 
tests revealed marked improvements in spatial and recognition memory in 
RA-058HM-treated 5xFAD mice, suggesting a reversal of cognitive deficits. At the 
molecular level, RA-058HM treatment reduced amyloidogenesis, as evidenced by 
decreased levels of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and β-secretase (BACE1) in 
the hippocampus, accompanied by reduced plaque formation, as detected by 
Thioflavin-S staining. Furthermore, synaptic transmission was restored to 
near-normal levels in RA-058HM-treated neurons, indicating that RA-058HM 
effectively rescues synaptic deficits without altering synaptic protein levels 
of PSD95 and synaptophysin. In addition, treatment of RA-058HM downregulated 
hippocampal levels of the NLRP3 inflammasome, TNF-α, and GFAP, suggesting a 
decrease in neuroinflammatory signaling and a modulation of glial activity. 
Restoration of mitochondrial motility in hippocampal neurons further suggests 
that RA-058HM may improve cellular energy dynamics. Collectively, these findings 
indicate that RA-058HM has multifaceted effects on AD pathology, targeting 
amyloid accumulation, synaptic transmission, neuroinflammation, and 
mitochondrial function. This study highlights RA-058HM as a promising candidate 
for AD therapy and underscores the potential of multi-targeted approaches in 
addressing the complex mechanisms underlying AD progression.

The earliest molecular changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are poorly 
understood1-5. Here we show that endogenous lithium (Li) is dynamically 
regulated in the brain and contributes to cognitive preservation during ageing. 
Of the metals we analysed, Li was the only one that was significantly reduced in 
the brain in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a precursor to 
AD. Li bioavailability was further reduced in AD by amyloid sequestration. We 
explored the role of endogenous Li in the brain by depleting it from the diet of 
wild-type and AD mouse models. Reducing endogenous cortical Li by approximately 
50% markedly increased the deposition of amyloid-β and the accumulation of 
phospho-tau, and led to pro-inflammatory microglial activation, the loss of 
synapses, axons and myelin, and accelerated cognitive decline. These effects 
were mediated, at least in part, through activation of the kinase GSK3β. 
Single-nucleus RNA-seq showed that Li deficiency gives rise to transcriptome 
changes in multiple brain cell types that overlap with transcriptome changes in 
AD. Replacement therapy with lithium orotate, which is a Li salt with reduced 
amyloid binding, prevents pathological changes and memory loss in AD mouse 
models and ageing wild-type mice. These findings reveal physiological effects of 
endogenous Li in the brain and indicate that disruption of Li homeostasis may be 
an early event in the pathogenesis of AD. Li replacement with amyloid-evading 
salts is a potential approach to the prevention and treatment of AD.

Ocular imaging and fluid protein levels are emerging as biomarkers for 
neurodegenerative disease. Elevated levels of plasma glial fibrillary acidic 
protein (GFAP), a marker of astrogliosis, have been demonstrated early in the 
course of Alzheimer's Disease. In this study, we measured GFAP levels in the 
aqueous and vitreous humors and plasma of 79 participants undergoing vitrectomy 
surgery for retinal disease and correlated them with subject Mini Mental Status 
Exam (MMSE) and Trail Making Test part b (TMT-b) scores. Measured GFAP 
concentrations were higher in vitreous and aqueous than in plasma. Levels of 
GFAP within the aqueous and vitreous were correlated (r = 0.6; p < 0.0001); 
however, there was no association between GFAP levels in either ocular fluid and 
plasma. There was no significant correlation between GFAP levels in any of the 
measured ocular fluids and cognition as measured by MMSE and TMT-b scores. In 
plasma, higher GFAP levels were associated with lower TMT-b, but not MMSE, 
scores. Given that elevated GFAP levels are associated with a variety of 
vitreoretinal diseases, future studies evaluating its use as a potential 
biomarker for dementias should concentrate on recruiting subjects without a 
history of ocular disease.

Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) represent two of 
the most prevalent diseases worldwide. Notably, it is estimated that 30%-50% of 
individuals with AD have co-occurring MDD and there are overlapping symptoms 
across numerous domains. In this pilot study, a Deep TMS protocol (targeting the 
left frontal and bilateral temporal regions) was delivered for 36 sessions to 
patients with co-occurring MDD and early-stage AD (N = 12). All participants 
received the treatment and there was no control condition. The treatment yielded 
a response rate of 83.33% (defined by a ≥50% reduction in depressive symptoms on 
the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]) and a remission rate of 50.00% 
(PHQ-9 score of 4 or less following treatment). Further, participants displayed 
reductions in left prefrontal and right temporal delta power using QEEG analysis 
pre- and -post treatment. Alpha coherence was also enhanced in key areas. The 
observed shift in neurophysiological measures suggested reduced cortical slowing 
and dysconnectivity, which are hallmark traits in MDD and AD. This 
proof-of-concept study suggests that further research on the application of Deep 
TMS (paired with QEEG) for early-stage AD is warranted.

Cistanche deserticola polysaccharides (CDPS) exhibit a range of pharmacological 
activities, most notably in immune modulation, anti-oxidation, and gut 
microbiota regulation. Emerging evidence suggests that restoring gut microbial 
and metabolic homeostasis may decelerate the progression of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). However, the specific in vivo effects and underlying mechanisms of CDPS in 
the context of AD remain incompletely understood. In this study, we employed 
behavioral tests, 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing, and time-resolved 
metabolomic analyses to comprehensively evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of 
CDPS. CDPS administration significantly ameliorated cognitive impairment, 
suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, and reduced A[Formula: see 
text] deposition and Tau hyperphosphorylation in the brains of APP/PS1 Tg mice. 
These effects were associated with CDPS-induced modulation of gut microbial 
composition - especially the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio - and regulation of 
D-Proline and Histidine metabolism. Further in vitro and in vivo validation 
confirmed that D-Proline and Histidine, key CDPS-associated metabolites, 
protected against A[Formula: see text]-induced apoptosis and oxidative stress. 
Notably, the cognitive benefits of CDPS were markedly weakened under conditions 
of gut microbiota disruption or immune suppression, which highlights the 
importance of microbial and immune system integrity in mediating its therapeutic 
effects. Collectively, these findings highlight gut microbial and metabolic 
disturbances as critical contributors to AD pathogenesis, and support CDPS as a 
promising multi-target therapeutic strategy. The integration of longitudinal 
microbiota and metabolomic profiling offers novel mechanistic insights into the 
neuroprotective actions of CDPS in AD.

BACKGROUND: The multifactorial nature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has become 
increasingly evident. In addition to well-established features like 
neurodegeneration, amyloid-beta and tau deposition, or glial changes, other 
processes-such as metabolic, circulatory, and inflammatory factors-may also play 
a key role in driving or accelerating AD-related pathology and cognitive 
decline. These factors represent important targets for slowing disease 
progression.
OBJECTIVES: Although many studies have examined individual risk factors and 
meta-analyses have been performed, a large-scale, comprehensive comparison using 
formal medical data from a single, unified cohort is needed.
DESIGN: A retrospective case-control study leveraging comprehensive health 
database.
SETTING: Data were obtained from the UK-Biobank, a large (∼500 K people) 
population-based biomedical database in the United Kingdom.
PARTICIPANTS: The study included participants aged 40-69 at enrollment between 
2006 and 2010, comprising 3,843 individuals who were clinically diagnosed with 
AD by August 2022 and 387,275 individuals without dementia or 
cognitive-impairment diagnoses.
MEASUREMENTS: ICD-10-coded diagnoses, recorded at least 10 years prior to AD 
diagnosis, were analyzed. Logistic regression was used to estimate the impact 
and significance of various medical conditions and their interactions with 
genetic risk factors, while accounting for demographic determinants.
RESULTS: The analysis identified 45 medical factors (96 ICD-10 entities) across 
multiple systems-particularly metabolic, circulatory, gastrointestinal, and 
sensorimotor-that significantly differentiated individuals with clinical AD from 
cognitively unimpaired individuals. Interaction analyses revealed that 
circulatory and metabolic factors had a weaker influence on AD risk in 
Apolipoprotein E ε4 carriers, suggesting a gene-environment interaction in 
disease susceptibility.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings enhance the understanding of system-level risk 
factors for clinical AD, highlight the relevance of less frequently reported 
factors in the AD prevention literature-such as gastrointestinal and 
sensorimotor disorders-and underscore the complex interplay between genetic 
susceptibility and vascular risk factors.

Recent data underscores a critical public health issue: more than 40 % of the 
global population suffers from neurological conditions, for which no cures 
currently exist. To combat this pressing challenge, researchers are turning to 
phytochemicals-bioactive compounds derived from plants that hold promising 
health benefits, particularly for cognitive function. This chapter intends to 
shed light on groundbreaking discoveries regarding curcumin, isoflavonoids, and 
cardiotonic steroids, natural compounds that act on the brain. These substances 
have shown significant potential for enhancing brain health as we age, 
especially in addressing neurodegenerative processes such as Alzheimer's and 
Parkinson's diseases. We will also examine the intricate molecular mechanisms 
these compounds activate to offer neuroprotection, supported by both in vitro 
and in vivo studies. Furthermore, we will analyze clinical trials that inspire 
optimism for the development of innovative therapeutic drugs in the near future. 
Supporting research in this area could be vital to transforming the landscape of 
neurological health.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common age-related neurodegenerative 
disease that affects millions of people every year globally. In addition to a 
drastic rise in AD cases, there is a significant increase in the death rate as 
well. According to the latest statistics, the death rate increased to 1.62 
million in 2019 and is expected to rise further. The primary pathological 
hallmark of the disease is the accumulation of misfolded aggregates, such as 
amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles, which induce toxic 
effects and initiate neuronal dysfunction, ultimately leading to disease 
symptoms, including cognitive impairment. Hence, targeting and eliminating these 
protein aggregates could significantly inhibit the disease pathogenesis. 
Previous studies have also suggested that the activation of heat shock factor 1 
(HSF1) and the up-regulation of its encoded heat shock proteins (HSPs) can clear 
toxic aggregates by triggering proteostasis mechanisms, such as autophagy and 
the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). However, in neurodegenerative diseases 
(NDs) like AD, the proteotoxic stress response (PSR) is defective and can't 
effectively remove harmful aggregates. In such conditions, the forced activation 
of HSF1 and its targeted molecular chaperone proteins, such as HSPs, by using 
various plant-derived compounds, such as celastrol, curcumin, and resveratrol, 
has shown promising neuroprotective effects by eliminating protein aggregates 
across multiple AD models. Hence, this review focused on various plant-derived 
compounds and their mode of activating HSF1 and its encoded HSPs. This review 
also described other compounds from multiple natural sources that affect HSF1 
and HSPs in different disease models. In this way, the current review will be a 
complete reference for natural compounds that activate HSF1 and help researchers 
identify potential drug candidates for NDs like Alzheimer's disease.

Understanding the molecular-level mechanisms underpinning Alzheimer's Disease 
(AD) by studying crucial genes associated with the disease remains a challenge. 
Alzheimer's, being a multifactorial disease, requires understanding the 
gene-gene interactions underlying it for theranostics and progress. In this 
article, a novel attempt has been made using a quantum regression to decode how 
some crucial genes in the AD Amyloid Beta Precursor Protein (APP), Sterol 
regulatory element binding transcription factor 14 (FGF14), Yin Yang 1 (YY1), 
and Phospholipase D Family Member 3 (PLD3) etc., become influenced by other 
prominent switching genes during disease progression, which may help in gene 
expression-based therapy for AD. Our proposed Quantum Regression Network for 
Alzheimer disease (Alz-QNet) introduces a pioneering approach with insights from 
the state-of-the-art Quantum Gene Regulatory Networks (QGRNs) to unravel the 
gene interactions involved in AD pathology, particularly within the Entorhinal 
Cortex (EC), where early pathological changes occur. Using the proposed Alz-QNet 
framework, we explore the interactions between key genes (APP, FGF14, YY1, EGR1, 
GAS7, AKT3, SREBF2, and PLD3) within the CE microenvironment of AD patients, 
studying genetic samples from the database GSE138852, all of which are believed 
to play a crucial role in the progression of AD. Our investigation uncovers 
intricate gene-gene interactions, shedding light on the potential regulatory 
mechanisms that underlie the pathogenesis of AD, which help us to find potential 
gene inhibitors or regulators for theranostics.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a complex and unmet medical challenge, 
requiring innovative approaches to address its multifaceted pathology. In this 
study, we explored chromeno[3,4-b]xanthones as a novel multifunctional scaffold, 
synthesized via the straightforward cyclization of their precursor, 
(E)-2-styrylchromones. Compounds 10 and 11q-s exhibited potent and selective 
cholinesterase inhibition (IC50 1.7-9.0 μM for AChE and BChE), along with 
significant antiamyloid activity (inhibition exceeding 50% at 50 μM). Among 
them, compound 11r demonstrated the most well-balanced multifunctional profile 
against all four AD-relevant targets. Molecular docking studies revealed key 
π-stacking, hydrogen bonding, and halogen interactions, which underlie the 
selective binding of compound 11r to AChE and BChE. Moreover, docking and 
molecular dynamics simulations showed that compound 11r binds strongly to the 
L-S-shaped β-amyloid 1-42 (Aβ42) fibril with a binding affinity of -11.3 
kcal/mol, representing a structural barrier to Aβ42 elongation. Additionally, 
compound 11r, selected as the representative scaffold, effectively disrupted Aβ 
aggregation, as demonstrated by in vitro studies, transmission electron 
microscopy (TEM), and cellular studies. It also displayed favorable drug-like 
properties, including predicted blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and an 
acceptable safety profile at active doses. The calcein-AM-assay also showed that 
this compound is unlikely to be actively effluxed from the brain. These findings 
underscore the therapeutic potential of chromeno[3,4-b]xanthone as 
multifunctional agents for AD, broadening the chemical space of small-molecule 
exploration.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, 
characterized by amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques, neuroinflammation and cognitive 
impairment. Metabolic disturbances, particularly brain insulin resistance, are 
increasingly recognized as central features of AD pathophysiology. Astrocytes, 
essential for brain energy metabolism, exhibit a loss of homeostatic functions 
in AD, possibly promoting neurodegeneration. Even though the main astrocytic 
glucose transporters are non-insulin dependent, insulin may regulate astroglial 
glucose metabolism. Our objective was to evaluate insulin signaling and 
astrocyte metabolism in the PDAPP-J20 transgenic mouse model of familial AD and 
in mouse primary astrocyte cultures exposed to Aβ. Adult PDAPP-J20 mice showed 
hyperinsulinemia, hippocampal insulin resistance and astrocytic proinflammatory 
activation. The reactive glial phenotype was accompanied by decreased insulin 
receptor levels in this chronic setting. Exposure of primary astrocytes to Aβ 
induced proinflammatory activation, oxidative stress and loss of glutamate 
transporter EAAT2, crucial for neuroprotection. Even though Aβ-exposed 
astrocytes showed increased insulin receptor levels in this acute setting, 
insulin-induced phosphorylation of the receptor was hampered. Amyloid-treated 
astrocytes also showed increased glucose uptake, lactate release and glycogen 
storage. Insulin treatment was associated with a recovery of mitochondrial 
membrane potential and increased amyloid uptake, highlighting a pro-homeostatic 
role for the hormone. Our results highlight the interplay between insulin 
signaling and astrocyte metabolism at different experimental and temporal 
settings of amyloid pathology. Understanding these mechanisms may help to design 
therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring metabolic balance and mitigating 
neurodegeneration.

The pathological complexity of Alzheimer's disease (AD) necessitates the 
development of efficient nanomedicine delivery systems. Nanoparticles are 
considered promising therapeutic candidates for AD owing to their drug-loading 
capacity. This study introduces an engineered cell membrane coating strategy to 
enhance nanoparticle functionality in targeting efficiency and susceptivity to 
immune clearance. We developed an engineered biomimetic nanodrug delivery system 
by modifying nanoparticles with Gas6-overexpressing neural stem cell membranes 
for improving microglia targeting, pro-phagocytic properties and 
immunomodulatory effects, constructing a composite system designated as 
Gas6-NV-NPs. The system employs poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) as a 
carrier to coencapsulate Rapamycin (RAP) and nicotinamide riboside (NR) 
(referred to as NPs), while leveraging Gas6 protein to specifically bind 
microglial surface receptors, enabling precise targeting of AD pathological 
regions. Our findings demonstrated that Gas6-NV-NPs restored lysosomal 
acidification in microglia, enhanced microglial phagocytic clearance of 
amyloid-β (Aβ), and reinstated the anti-inflammatory phenotype in BV2 microglial 
cells. Furthermore, Gas6-NV-NPs exhibited favorable biosafety and robust 
brain-targeting capability in vivo, effectively promoting Aβ clearance and 
neuronal repair in 5 × FAD mice model of AD. This "engineered membrane 
modification-nanodrug delivery" synergistic strategy enhances therapeutic 
targeting and achieves multitargeted effects, offering a approach to overcoming 
critical bottlenecks in AD nanotherapy.

Protein misfolding and subsequent aggregation into insoluble amyloid deposits 
are associated with various diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, systemic 
amyloidosis, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In T2DM, the peptide hormone 
islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), which regulates glucose homeostasis, 
aggregates in the pancreas, forming soluble cytotoxic aggregates and amyloid 
fibrils that contribute to β-cell dysfunction and death. Thus, the inhibition of 
IAPP aggregation consists of a promising strategy for treating T2DM. Natural 
gallotannins are potential amyloid modulators, though their effects on amyloid 
self-assembly are not fully understood. This study examines two gallotannins, 
1,3,6-tri-O-galloyl-β-d-glucose (β-TGG) and corilagin, and their inhibitory 
effects on IAPP aggregation. Using thioflavin T fluorescence, atomic force 
microscopy, and circular dichroism, it was found that the gallotannins delay 
IAPP self-assembly and reduce the length and quantity of amyloid fibrils. 
Despite structural similarity, corilagin exhibited markedly higher 
antiaggregative activity at lower concentrations compared to β-TGG. Peptide 
monomer-gallotannin interactions were further investigated using all-atom 
explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations, providing valuable insight into 
the binding of both gallotannins to monomeric IAPP. Furthermore, corilagin 
provided significant cytoprotective effects against IAPP-induced cytotoxicity 
and membrane damage in pancreatic β-cells. Mechanistic analysis revealed that 
corilagin exerts its effects primarily by inhibiting secondary nucleation and 
facilitating off-pathway aggregation into cytocompatible proteospecies. 
Together, these findings highlight the potential of both gallotannins in 
inhibiting amyloid self-assembly and inspiring the development of 
antiaggregative agents.

Komagataella pastoris is a promising probiotic for modulating the 
microbiota-gut-brain axis, and growing evidence has demonstrated the relevance 
of this axis in the pathophysiology of neurological and psychiatric disorders, 
such as Alzheimer's disease and major depressive disorder. This study 
investigated the ameliorated cognitive impairment and antidepressive-like effect 
of K. pastoris treatment on an AD-like mouse model induced by amyloid β1-40 
peptide (Aβ1-40). Behavioral tests revealed that Aβ1-40 administration 
(400 pmol/mouse, icv) increased immobility time in the tail suspension test, 
decreased spatial and working memory, and increased the time animals took to 
reach the chocolate cookies, and these behavioral changes were attenuated by the 
K. pastoris KM71H treatment (8 log CFU-1/mouse, ig). Biochemical changes also 
occurred as the applied protocol decreased reactive species and lipid 
peroxidation in the hippocampi and small intestine and reduced NRLP3, TLR4, 
Nfҡb, and IL-1β expression in the small intestine of mice. We believe that the 
ameliorated cognitive impairment and antidepressant effects of K. pastoris KM71H 
are due to its antioxidant activity and the modulation of the TLR4/NF-κB 
pathway, and our findings led us to conclude that K. pastoris KM71H is a 
promising therapeutic strategy for treating Alzheimer's disease and major 
depressive disorder.

PURPOSE: Plasma phosphorylated tau 217 (pTau217) is a promising biomarker for 
Alzheimer's disease, reflecting both amyloid β (Aβ) and tau positron emission 
tomography (PET) results. While its diagnostic role is actively being 
investigated, this study aims to expand its application to staging disease 
progression and predicting cognitive decline.
METHODS: A total of 2,919 participants, primarily diagnosed as Alzheimer's 
clinical syndrome, were recruited. Plasma pTau217 was measured using the ALZpath 
assay, and its diagnostic accuracy for binary Aβ/tau (A/T) biomarker profiles 
and Aβ and tau PET staging was assessed using area under the curve (AUC). 
Longitudinal Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) changes according to plasma 
pTau217-based staging were analyzed.
RESULTS: Plasma pTau217 accurately predicted binary Aβ (AUC 0.96) and tau (AUC 
0.90) PET positivity. Both the Aβ-positive/tau-positive (Aptau+/Tptau+) and 
Aβ-positive/tau-negative (Aptau+/Tptau-) groups, defined using plasma pTau217 
cutoffs, showed significantly worse MMSE trajectories compared to the 
Aβ-negative/tau-negative (Aptau-/Tptau-) group (for Aptau+/Tptau+ vs. 
Aptau-/Tptau-, β = -1.061 ± 0.055; for Aptau+/Tptau- vs. Aptau-/Tptau-, β = 
-0.322 ± 0.070, all adjusted P < 0.001). However, its performance was less 
effective for Aβ and tau PET staging, particularly for medial temporal tau PET 
stage (AUC 0.71). Nevertheless, plasma pTau217-based staging distinguished 
longitudinal MMSE deterioration (all adjusted P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Plasma pTau217 is effective for predicting A/T biomarker profile and 
cognitive decline, though further study is needed to better explain its 
association with Aβ and tau PET staging.

INTRODUCTION: Despite progress in dementia diagnosis and treatment, 
physician-held stigma remains a significant barrier to early recognition and 
effective care. Stigmatizing attitudes among healthcare professionals can 
negatively impact diagnosis rates, clinical interactions, and care quality for 
people living with dementia.
METHODS: This scoping review was conducted following Arksey and O'Malley's 
framework. Peer-reviewed literature from 2014 to 2024 was systematically 
reviewed to identify and evaluate interventions aimed at reducing 
dementia-related stigma among physicians. A total of 14 studies met inclusion 
criteria, examining educational, skill-building, and person-centered approaches.
RESULTS: Interventions included brief workshops, online modular training, and 
interdisciplinary methods integrating person-centered frameworks and behavior 
management tools. Validated outcome measures used in the studies included the 
Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Scale (ADKS), the Dementia Negative Stereotype 
Scale (DNS), and the General Practitioners Confidence and Attitude Scale for 
Dementia (GPACS-D). Across studies, interventions were found to improve clinical 
confidence, reduce negative stereotypes, and enhance care quality.
DISCUSSION: Findings highlight the importance of culturally sensitive and 
interdisciplinary interventions to address stigma, improve clinical confidence, 
and enhance care quality, particularly in low-resource settings. Notable gaps 
remain in understanding the long-term impact and scalability of such 
interventions. This review aims to contribute a deeper understanding of the 
barriers and facilitators to implementing dementia care practices, offering a 
conceptualization for enhanced physician education and improved health outcomes 
for persons with dementia. We offer recommendations for future research to 
develop tailored strategies that support stigma reduction and improve care 
delivery.

Microglia regulate neuronal circuit plasticity. Disrupting their homeostatic 
function has detrimental effects on neuronal circuit health. Neuroinflammation 
contributes to the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases, 
including Alzheimer's disease (AD), with several microglial activation genes 
linked to increased risk for these conditions. Inflammatory microglia alter 
neuronal excitability, inducing metabolic strain. Interestingly, expression of 
APOE4, the strongest genetic risk factor for AD, affects both microglial 
activation and neuronal excitability, highlighting the interplay between lipid 
metabolism, inflammation, and neuronal function. It remains unclear how 
microglial inflammatory state is conveyed to neurons to affect circuit function 
and whether APOE4 expression alters this intercellular communication. Here, we 
use a reductionist model of human iPSC-derived microglial and neuronal 
monocultures to dissect how the APOE genotype in each cell-type independently 
contributes to microglial regulation of neuronal activity during inflammation. 
Conditioned media (CM) from LPS-stimulated microglia increased neuronal network 
activity, assessed by calcium imaging, with APOE4 microglial CM driving higher 
neuronal firing rates than APOE3 CM. Both APOE3 and APOE4 neurons increase 
network activity in response to CM treatments, while APOE4 neurons uniquely 
increase presynaptic puncta with APOE4 microglial CM. CM-derived exosomes from 
LPS-stimulated microglia can mediate increases to network activity. Lastly, 
increased network activity is accompanied by increased lipid droplet (LD) 
metabolism and blocking LD metabolism abolishes network activity. These findings 
illuminate how microglia-to-neuron communication drives inflammation-induced 
changes in neuronal circuit function, demonstrate a role for neuronal LDs in 
network activity, and support a potential mechanism through which APOE4 
increases neuronal excitability.

BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is associated with adverse health 
outcomes. However, the association with dementia remains uncertain. Thus, we 
examined the association of OSA with all-cause dementia and Alzheimer's disease.
METHODS: We conducted a Danish nationwide population-based cohort study using 
health registries. Patients with OSA were identified from 1995 to 2017. 
Furthermore, a propensity score-matched comparison cohort was defined. 
Propensity scores were computed based on age, sex, comorbidities and education. 
With follow-up until 2018, we computed incidence rates (IRs) and HRs for 
all-cause dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Subgroup analyses were conducted by 
sex, age, overweight/obesity, hypertension and continuous positive airway 
pressure (CPAP) treatment.
RESULTS: We identified 62 928 patients with OSA and 62 928 in the propensity 
score-matched comparison cohort (76% male, median age 52 years). The IR for 
all-cause dementia was 1.27 (95% CI 1.17 to 1.37) per 1000 person-years in 
patients with OSA and 1.15 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.25) in the propensity score-matched 
comparison cohort, yielding an HR of 1.10 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.24). The HR for 
Alzheimer's disease was 1.16 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.43). Among individuals with 
overweight/obesity, the HR for all-cause dementia was 0.71 (95% CI 0.51 to 
0.99), while it was 1.17 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.33) in those without. CPAP treatment 
attenuated associations.
CONCLUSION: Our findings support a modest association between OSA and dementia, 
including Alzheimer's disease, motivating early clinical detection of OSA as a 
potentially modifiable risk factor for subsequent dementia. The finding that the 
dementia hazard was not increased in the setting of overweight or obesity 
requires further study and points to the need for research on mechanisms 
underlying the association between OSA and dementia.

INTRODUCTION: Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), produced by gut microbes, 
influence Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology in animals. Less is known about 
SCFAs and AD in humans. We profiled feces of adults along the AD continuum to 
investigate gut microbiome and SCFA associations with AD pathology and 
cognition.
METHODS: We measured SCFAs and bacterial abundances in fecal samples from 287 
participants in the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center and Wisconsin 
Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention. We performed regressions examining 
associations between SCFAs or gut microbes and AD pathology and cognition.
RESULTS: Fecal propionate, isovalerate, and propionate-producing bacteria are 
inversely associated with amyloid status. Mediation analysis found that 
propionate mediates sex-specific associations between SCFAs and CSF biomarkers. 
SCFA levels are associated with slower cognitive decline.
DISCUSSION: These results link SCFAs and propionate-producing bacteria with AD. 
This may inform efforts to leverage diet and specific bacteria to boost SCFA 
production and potentially ameliorate AD progression.

INTRODUCTION: The interpretation of plasma phosphorylated tau (pTau) levels may 
be influenced by metabolic conditions, such as insulin resistance (IR), type 2 
diabetes mellitus (T2DM), obesity, and kidney function. We examined the extent 
to which metabolic factors are associated with plasma pTau concentrations 
(pTau181, pTau217, pTau231) and the contribution of these factors on analytical 
outcomes.
METHODS: We analyzed data from 287 participants using partial Spearman's rho, 
Mann Whitney U, ROC analysis, and linear mixed models.
RESULTS: Concordance between plasma pTau217 and amyloid PET was not influenced 
by IR or estimated-glomerular-filtration-rate (eGFR). Accounting for eGFR 
improved concordance of pTau181 and pTau231 with amyloid PET. Age, binarized 
waist-to-hip ratio, and amyloid status were associated with all longitudinal 
pTau concentrations, and eGFR associated with longitudinal pTau231.
DISCUSSION: Metabolic health may influence the interpretation of some plasma 
pTau biomarkers, potentially necessitating adjustments for metabolic factors in 
research and clinical settings.

With the recent approval of disease-modifying treatments for mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) and mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) by the United States Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA), Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency 
(MHRA), European Medicine Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human 
Use (EMA/CHMP) entities, there is a growing sense of urgency and renewed efforts 
to reassess and understand what constitutes a clinically meaningful benefit in 
the context of new treatments for AD care, despite the discordance between 
regulatory entities in regulatory decision-making. While the concept of minimal 
clinically important difference (MCID) was introduced many years ago, there 
remains an ongoing debate about how best to evaluate and define clinical benefit 
in the context of emerging and new therapies for dementia. In this perspective 
piece, we assess how MCID can be applied to common endpoints and identify areas 
where MCID application or generation could be useful to enable a better 
valuation of therapeutic innovation. We offer recommendations for greater 
consistency in measures used to define MCID, and encourage the prioritized use 
of patient-reported measures in early AD to build fieldwide consensus for MCID 
estimation methods and application in AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: There is no gold standard or field-wide consensus on what 
constitutes a clinically meaningful change in Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
progression trajectories.Anchor-based minimal clinically important difference 
(MCID) may be used as a tool that can be leveraged for greater contextualization 
of the clinical relevance of a treatment effect.Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) 
should be used to define MCID, particularly within mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI), prodrome/mild AD groups.Greater consistency is needed in the outcome 
measures used to detect cognitive and functional change to define MCID. This 
will enable MCID comparisons and support replications of MCID estimates across 
AD populations.Observational data can augment the clinical characterization and 
impact of treatment effect and help establish a "ground truth" MCID.MCID 
estimates for AD outcomes may be used in regulatory submissions to help 
contextualize the importance of a statistically significant treatment effect.

BACKGROUND: The hippocampus is a key brain region for episodic memory, and 
impairment of episodic memory is the earliest feature of amnestic mild cognitive 
impairment (aMCI). Preserving the structure and function of the hippocampus 
plays a key role in preventing progression to Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Therefore, early intervention is crucial, and acupuncture could significantly 
improve episodic memory in aMCI, but the mechanism is not clear. Accordingly, 
this experiment aims to explore the mechanism of acupuncture to improve episodic 
memory in aMCI based on the hippocampal subregion.
METHODS: A randomized, controlled, blinded research will be performed. 150 aMCI 
participants will be assigned to the verum acupuncture group, sham acupuncture 
group, and waiting group; 50 healthy controls will also be recruited. Patients 
in the acupuncture group will receive real acupuncture treatment or placebo 
acupuncture three times per week, 36 sessions over 12 consecutive weeks in 
total. Patients in the waiting group will receive the same verum acupuncture 
treatment for compensation after the trials are finished. The primary outcome 
will be the auditory-verbal learning test. Secondary outcomes will include 
Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), 
Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), and functional magnetic resonance imaging 
data. Outcomes will be measured at baseline and 12 weeks after randomization. 
Repeated measurement analysis of variance will be used to explore the 
intervention effect.
DISCUSSION: This protocol will provide theoretical support for the neural 
mechanisms by which acupuncture improves episodic memory in aMCI. We hope that 
this study will provide objective evidence and offer alternative treatment 
options for the early treatment of aMCI.

Exosomes, nanoscale extracellular vesicles (30-150 nm), play a critical role in 
intercellular communication by transporting bioactive molecules, including 
proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. These vesicles have emerged as a 
transformative tool for drug delivery in brain diseases, particularly due to 
their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a major challenge in 
treating central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Recent studies have highlighted 
the potential of exosome-based therapies in treating neurodegenerative diseases 
such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, neuroinflammatory conditions, and brain 
tumors like glioblastoma. Exosomes can be engineered to enhance their targeting 
precision by modifying their surface to selectively deliver therapeutic agents 
to specific brain cells, including neurons, glial cells, and endothelial cells. 
This review explores the latest advancements in optimizing exosome-mediated drug 
delivery, focusing on surface modifications and other strategies to improve 
targeting efficiency and therapeutic outcomes. Additionally, exosomes are being 
investigated as diagnostic biomarkers for early disease detection and 
monitoring, offering a noninvasive alternative to traditional methods. Despite 
their promise, challenges such as large-scale production, cargo loading, safety 
concerns, and regulatory barriers remain. This review provides an overview of 
the current state of exosome-based therapies, critically evaluates the ongoing 
challenges, and explores future directions for optimizing their use in brain 
disease treatment, emphasizing enhancing targeted delivery and therapeutic 
efficacy.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that begins with memory 
loss and can lead to death. In Puerto Rico, AD is the fourth leading cause of 
death, while in the United States, it ranks fifth. Research suggests the gut 
microbiome contributes to the pathophysiology of AD by promoting inflammation 
and amyloid buildup in the brain. This study examined the composition and 
diversity of the gut microbiota in Puerto Ricans with AD compared to controls 
and its relationship with cognitive impairment severity and APOE status. We 
recruited 100 participants (50 AD, 50 controls), who underwent clinical and 
cognitive assessments (MoCA/CDR). While overall microbial diversity and richness 
showed no significant differences, specific bacterial taxa exhibited subtle 
differential abundance. Faecalibacterium and Bacteroides were moderately 
significant and increased on controls compared to AD. Moreover, individuals 
carrying the APOE E4 allele exhibited lower abundances of butyrate-producing 
bacteria and an enrichment of potentially pro-inflammatory genera, including 
Eggerthella and Lachnoclostridium. These findings suggest that gut microbiota 
dysbiosis may contribute to cognitive decline and AD progression, highlighting 
the potential for microbiome-targeted therapeutic interventions in AD prevention 
and treatment.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) presents a critical global health challenge, with 
current therapies offering limited efficacy and safety in halting disease 
progression. Gamma sensory stimulation (GSS) has emerged as a promising 
non-invasive neuromodulation technique that enhances gamma neural synchrony, 
potentially counteracting AD pathology by promoting glymphatic clearance, 
reducing neuroinflammation and improving synaptic plasticity. However, existing 
GSS delivery methods rely on simplistic sensory stimuli that lack user 
engagement, potentially creating adherence barriers and limiting the full 
therapeutic potential of this approach. To address this, we investigated whether 
GSS delivered through virtual reality (VR) could safely and effectively evoke 
gamma-band neural activity while providing an engaging and tolerable user 
experience. Sixteen cognitively healthy older adults participated in a 
single-session, within-subject feasibility study consisting of three VR-based 
experiments. In each, 40 Hz auditory and/or visual stimuli were presented, and 
neural responses were recorded using electroencephalography (EEG). Tolerability 
and safety were assessed via digital questionnaires. Source-level analysis from 
Experiment 1 confirmed that unimodal auditory and visual stimulation at 40 Hz 
reliably increased gamma power in their respective sensory cortices. 
Sensor-level analyses from Experiments 2 and 3 showed that multimodal 
audiovisual stimulation enhanced both gamma power and inter-trial phase 
coherence-whether delivered through passive video viewing or integrated into an 
active cognitive task. Participants reported high comfort and engagement, with 
no serious adverse events. The findings of this study validate VR as a scalable 
tool for delivering engaging and cognitively relevant GSS, paving the way for 
personalized therapies that maximize adherence and therapeutic outcomes. By 
integrating interactive elements, VR-based GSS may uniquely target 
memory-related neural networks, offering a novel approach to mitigate 
neurotoxicity and cognitive decline in AD.

BACKGROUND: Dementia is a complex, multifactorial syndrome characterised by 
cognitive decline and impaired daily functioning, representing a major risk 
factor for long-term care dependency. As the prevalence of dementia will 
increase due to demographic change, healthcare systems face growing challenges, 
including timely diagnosis, equitable access to care, and managing the rising 
demand for health services. Speech-language therapy (SLT) and occupational 
therapy (OT) can help maintain cognitive function and quality of life, 
particularly in the early stages of dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). 
However, their utilisation in Germany remains poorly understood.
OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the utilisation and prescription patterns of SLT 
and OT among people with dementia or MCI and explores factors associated with 
therapy use, based on German claims data.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using routinely collected 
data from the research database of the Institute for Applied Health Research 
Berlin (InGef), including anonymised health records of 5 million individuals in 
Germany. The dataset covered the period from 2017 to 2022. Incident cases of 
dementia or MCI were tracked for two years following diagnosis to assess therapy 
use and prescription patterns. Different facets associated with therapy use were 
analysed using multivariable logistic regression.
RESULTS: A total of 63,496 individuals (58% female, 42% male) were included 
(81.8% with dementia, 18.2% with MCI). Of these, 4.2% received SLT and 10.3% 
received OT (at least one prescription within the two-year follow-up period). 
Male sex (Odds Ratio [OR] 1.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09-1.40) and 
certain dementia types were significantly associated with higher odds of 
receiving SLT compared to individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD): dementia 
classified elsewhere (OR 3.34, 95% CI 2.46-4.53), vascular dementia (OR 1.71, 
95% CI: 1.36-2.15), and MCI (OR 1.61, 95% CI: 1.28-2.03). In contrast, these 
dementia types were associated with lower odds of receiving OT. Older age was 
negatively associated with SLT use, whereas no consistent age-related pattern 
was observed for OT utilisation.
CONCLUSION: Our findings reveal low utilisation of SLT and OT, highlighting 
significant gaps in allied health service provision for people with dementia or 
MCI. These results underscore the need for improved referral pathways and 
targeted strategies to better integrate allied health professionals into routine 
dementia care.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) α-synuclein (α-syn) seed amplification assays (SAAs) 
can detect Lewy body pathology (LBP) with high accuracy but are invasive and 
costly. To address these challenges, this study evaluated a two-step workflow 
combining prescreening via smell-function testing with confirmatory CSF α-syn 
SAA testing only in individuals with reduced smell, for predicting postmortem 
LBP status. Among 358 autopsied participants, the two-step workflow predicted 
brain LBP with high accuracy overall (94%), and within clinical subgroups 
(clinical parkinsonism=95%; clinical Alzheimer's disease [AD]=94%; clinically 
unimpaired [CU]=93%). It reduced the need for confirmatory CSF testing by 43% 
overall (23% clinical parkinsonism; 35% clinical AD; 80% CU). In an independent 
in vivo cohort (N=1209), the workflow predicted CSF α-syn SAA status with 79% 
accuracy and reduced CSF testing by 26%. This approach may reduce invasive CSF 
testing, alleviating patient burden and lowering healthcare costs.

With the recent approval of anti-amyloid beta (Aβ) monoclonal antibody infusion 
therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD), more feasible and safter Aβ-reducing 
approaches are anticipated. Previous studies showed that 750-mg/day or 
1000-mg/day (but not 500-mg/day) sodium benzoate treatment improved cognitive 
function in AD patients with excellent safety and that benzoate decreased Aβ 
burden in an animal AD model. The current study aimed to explore whether oral 
sodium benzoate was able to reduce Aβ peptides in AD patients and whether Aβ 
before treatment was correlated with cognitive improvement after treatment. This 
secondary analysis used data from a double-blind trial, in which 149 patients 
with mild AD were randomized to receive oral placebo or one of three benzoate 
doses (500, 750, or 1000 mg/day). Cognitive function and plasma Aβ 1-40 and Aβ 
1-42 levels were measured before and after treatment. When compared to placebo, 
benzoate therapy at effective doses (750 and 1000 mg/day) reduced Aβ 1-40 and 
the sum of both Aβ peptides (Aβ 1-40 plus Aβ 1-42) in AD patients. Moreover, 
higher Aβ 1-42 levels at baseline were associated with better cognitive 
improvements after benzoate treatment at effective doses in the patients. The 
findings suggest that sodium benzoate therapy can reduce Aβ 1-40 and the total 
Aβ in AD patients and higher Aβ 1-42 levels before treatment predict better 
cognitive improvements. Due to its superior safety and convenient 
administration, sodium benzoate has the potential to be a novel Aβ-reducing 
therapy for AD treatment. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Name of trial registry: NMDA

BACKGROUND: The diet-gut-microbiota-brain axis is critical for maintaining brain 
health. The Dietary Index for Gut Microbiota (DI-GM), comprising beneficial and 
unfavorable components, may serve as a proxy for this connection, yet its 
association with cognition remains underexplored.
METHODS: This study examined the relationship between DI-GM, its components, and 
cognitive function in older adults using data from the National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Findings were validated in an independent 
Hong Kong osteoporosis cohort (OS cohort) with gut metagenomic data to assess of 
microbiota's mediating role in diet-cognition relationship. Cognitive assessment 
in NHANES utilized the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's 
Disease (CERAD), Animal Fluency Test (AFT), and Digit Symbol Substitution Test 
(DSST), while the OS cohort employed the Hong Kong version of the Montreal 
Cognitive Assessment (HK-MoCA). DI-GM was calculated from 24-hour dietary 
recalls. The diet-cognition associations were assessed by weighted multivariate 
regressions, supplemented by restricted cubic spline (RCS), subgroup, 
correlation network, and mediation analyses.
RESULTS: Higher DI-GM was significantly associated with better performance on 
DSST (OR=0.90; 95 % CI: 0.82, 0.99; p = 0.033). The beneficial-to-gut-microbiota 
score (BGMS) associated with lower psychometric mild cognitive impairment 
(p-MCI) risk (OR=0.88; 95 % CI: 0.80, 0.98; p = 0.022) and better CERAD 
immediate and delayed recall and DSST (all p < 0.05). The 
beneficial-to-gut-microbiota components like dietary fiber demonstrated 
protective effects across cognitive domains, while refined grains was associated 
with poorer cognition. In the OS cohort, higher dietary fiber intake correlated 
with higher HK-MoCA score (p < 0.05) and increased abundance of fermenting 
bacteria. Among these species, Eubacterium ventriosum mediated the beneficial 
effect of dietary fiber intake on dementia risk reduction, with an indirect 
effect of -0.014 (95 % CrI: -0.040, -0.001), accounting for approximately 12.7 % 
of the total effect.
CONCLUSION: Higher adherence to beneficial-to-gut-microbiota dietary patterns, 
as reflected by DI-GM, was associated with better cognitive function in older 
adults. These findings highlight the importance of a gut-microbiota-targeted 
diet in maintaining cognitive health.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and is a growing 
public health challenge. Neuroinflammation has been proposed as a prominent 
pathological feature of AD and has traditionally been attributed to the innate 
immune system. However, emerging evidence highlights the involvement of adaptive 
immunity, particularly T and B lymphocytes, in the neuroinflammatory processes 
of AD. It remains unclear how adaptive immune responses, originally intended to 
protect the body, contribute to chronic inflammation and neuronal dysfunction in 
AD. Here, we review the roles of adaptive immunity, cellular composition, and 
niches and their contribution to AD development and progression. Notably, we 
synthesize the crosstalk between adaptive immunity and the innate immune system 
of the central nervous system (CNS), which is mainly mediated by glial cells and 
myeloid cells, and their interrelationships with amyloid-β (Aβ)/Tau pathology. 
We hypothesized that the alterations observed in innate immunity in AD mirror 
age-related immune alterations, whereas the dysregulation of adaptive immunity 
contributes more accurately to disease-specific immune responses. Targeting 
adaptive immunity in the context of neuroinflammation may provide new insights 
into potential therapeutic strategies designed to modulate immune responses, 
thereby facilitating the diagnosis, intervention, and treatment of AD.

The renin-angiotensin system (RAS), an important regulator of body fluid and 
cardiovascular homeostasis, is gradually implicated in the pathogenesis of 
neurological diseases due to its dysregulation. In addition to their traditional 
functions, components of the RAS, especially angiotensin-II (Ang-II), enhance 
neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and neuronal injury. Ang-II exacerbates 
blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, promotes glial activation, and contributes 
to neurodegeneration via the Angiotensin type 1 (AT1) receptor (AT1R) and causes 
neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease 
(PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), Huntington's disease (HD), epilepsy, depression, 
and anxiety. The angiotensin (1-7) axis mediated by the Mas receptor appears to 
be neuroprotective, however, as it reverses the negative effects of Ang-II. In 
experimental models and clinical trials, blocking RAS specifically by 
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor 
blockers (ARBs) has demonstrated promise in reducing neuroinflammation and 
neuronal damage, especially in stroke and neurodegenerative diseases. In the 
current era of research, neuropharmacologists have new optimism due to emerging 
evidence of the promising potential of RAS-modulating drugs, such as ARBs and 
ACEIs, in the treatment of various neurological diseases. Since RAS imbalance 
causes neuroinflammation, neuronal damage, and cognitive decline in conditions 
including AD, PD, and MS, these drugs may offer a new treatment approach. In the 
current era of neuropharmacology, this technique is novel since it enables more 
targeted therapies to address the root causes of neurodegeneration. This review 
explores the molecular pathways of RAS dysregulation in various neurological 
diseases, highlighting its therapeutic potential and paving the way for future 
treatment strategies.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects thirty million individuals worldwide, but a 
viable treatment has yet to be identified. During disease progression, 
peripheral immune cells, including peripheral T cells, infiltrate the brain. 
Although CD4+ regulatory T cells have been demonstrated to exhibit 
neuroprotective efficacy in AD, the precise roles of these cells in the brain 
remain elusive. Here, we report that β-amyloid (Aβ) 1-42 antigen-specific CD4+ T 
cells spontaneously cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) into the brain in an 
APP/PS1 mouse model. To promote parenchymal Treg conversion from infiltrated 
CD4+ T cells and minimize the perturbations of the brain microenvironment, we 
engineered an Aβ1-42 antigen-specific CD4+ T cell-based nanodelivery system to 
release the compound AS2863619, a CDK8/19 inhibitor (eTc-AS), which can bypass 
the BBB and selectively induce the conversion of CD4+ T cells into Treg cells 
within the brain region. These cells demonstrated notable pathological 
amelioration in APP/PS1 mice, in part by interacting with microglia or recruited 
macrophage via PD-L1/PD-1 signaling. Our study reveals valuable engineered T 
cell therapies and suggests an immune checkpoint mechanism underlying the 
neuroprotective function of the Treg-microglia like cell interplay in AD.

AIMS: Understanding the holistic experience of patients with early Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) and their care partners is important to identify unmet needs. This 
study aimed to describe and compare patient-care partner dyad experiences and 
perspectives in early AD.
PATIENTS & METHODS: Experiences of patients and their care partners (dyads) were 
explored using a survey, qualitative interviews, and social media listening. 
Each dyad completed a 25-minute quantitative online survey exploring their 
perceptions of symptoms, comorbidity impact, financial burden, and preferred 
treatment characteristics. Data were analyzed descriptively and comparatively.
RESULTS: 150 patient-care partner dyads completed the survey. Patients and care 
partners frequently reported memory-related issues and cognitive challenges (68% 
and 77%, respectively); approximately 19% of responses were discordant, with 
patients often under-reporting symptoms. Managing comorbidities worsened overall 
well-being of patients (41%) and care partners (40%). Treatments slowing AD 
progression (patients: 99%; care partners: 96%) and improving symptoms 
(patients: 95%; care partners: 93%) were important. Approximately 26% of 
respondents experienced significant negative financial impacts.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients and care partners perceived early AD impacts similarly 
whereas some symptoms were perceived differently. There was a shared desire for 
disease-modifying treatments. Limited financial impact may reflect preserved 
functionality and limited use of disease-modifying treatments.

Plain Language Summary: Why does it matter? In the United States (US), about 6.7 
million people aged 65 and older are living with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This 
number is expected to double by 2060. Patients in the early stages of AD, 
including those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI, or mild memory problems) 
due to AD and mild AD dementia, can usually manage daily tasks but experience 
some trouble with thinking and remembering (cognitive and functional 
impairment). Once these symptoms worsen over time, patients often need more help 
from a care partner, for example a family member. It is therefore important to 
understand the views and experiences of both the patients and their care 
partners in the early stages of AD.How does it work? We ran 25-minute online 
surveys with patients with early AD and their care partners living in the US. 
The survey questions covered symptoms of early AD, impact on finances, the 
burden of having coexisting medical conditions and views on the most important 
features of treatment for AD. Responses from patients and their care partners 
were compared.What did we find? There were differences in the symptoms of early 
AD reported by patients and their care partners. Having to manage coexisting 
medical conditions negatively impacted the overall well-being of both patients 
and care partners. Significant negative impacts on financial well-being were 
observed in less than two of every five patients or care partners. Both patients 
and care partners valued treatments that would stop or slow down disease 
progression and reduce AD symptoms.

OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative 
disease. Unfortunately, current effective therapeutics for AD are limited, and 
thus, the discovery of novel anti-AD agents is urgently needed. Celastrol, a 
plant-derived triterpene, has both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Here, we found that celastrol treatment promoted microglial 
M2 polarization and inhibited inflammatory factor expression in both in vivo and 
in vitro experiments. Celastrol treatment significantly improved cognitive 
function in AD mice by regulation the TLR4/NFκB pathway, overexpression TLR4 
reversed the protective effect of CEL to cognitive function in AD model mice. 
Suggesting that TLR4/NFκB plays a crucial role in regulating the inflammatory 
response.
CONCLUSION: Taken together, the results indicate that celastrol treatment 
attenuated the inflammatory response in AD mice by promoting microglial M2 
polarization via the TLR4/NFκB pathway.

Is screening for Alzheimer's disease ready for prime time? Ask Wilson and 
Jungner.

Population screening is an effective strategy for disease prevention, early 
diagnosis and treatment; however, the benefits and harms of disease screening 
need to be carefully evaluated before clinical implementation. Various national 
and international bodies, including the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force 
(USPSTF), periodically develop recommendations for screening after reviewing the 
available published evidence and, in some instances, expert opinions. In 1968, 
Wilson and Jungner formulated a set of 10 rules that must be considered and 
fulfilled before introducing screening for any disease into clinical practice. 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), a devastating chronic disease that affects millions of 
people worldwide and is the most common cause of dementia, has recently been 
reviewed in the context of population screening. Data and predictions show that 
the prevalence of AD is steadily increasing and will likely become one of the 
most common causes of death by 2060. Currently, there are no effective curative 
therapeutic options for this disease, but new developments have allowed earlier 
detection at asymptomatic and early symptomatic stages. New classes of 
disease-modifying therapeutics show promise of slowing the progression of the 
disease. These new developments prompted us to examine the near-future 
feasibility of screening for presymptomatic or early symptomatic AD by 
considering the general screening principles of Wilson and Jungner. In 2020, 
USPSTF published a guideline regarding screening for cognitive impairment, an AD 
symptom, and concluded that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the 
balance of benefits and harms and did not recommend screening for cognitive 
impairment in older adults. This was recapitulated in 2024 by the Canadian Task 
Force on Preventive Health Care (CTFPHC). After careful consideration, and 
despite the recent significant biological, diagnostic and therapeutic advances 
for AD, screening does not seem to be justified at present, due to numerous 
reasons, such as lack of trained professionals and specialized clinics to handle 
the anticipated highly increased workload, the huge cost, the ineffectiveness 
and side effects of current therapy, the lack of long-term therapy studies, and 
the disagreement among experts as to whom to test and treat and when (at either 
asymptomatic or early symptomatic stages).

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common dementia with progressive loss of 
cognitive functions. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors have been approved 
as conventional pharmacotherapies for AD. Tacrine was the first AChE inhibitor 
introduced into clinics for AD; however, it was withdrawn from use in 2013 
because of safety concerns. In cultured neurons, as well as in mice, tacrine was 
found to induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and finally lead to cell 
apoptosis: the event was triggered by binding the inhibitor to the intracellular 
enzyme serving as a pharmacological chaperone. Trehalose, a known ER stress 
reducer, was shown here to ameliorate the ER stress induced by tacrine in 
AChE-overexpressed NG108-15 cells, with the increased level of C/EBP homologous 
protein (CHOP) and phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha 
(p-eIF2α). In tetrameric G4 AChE overexpressed cells, the tacrine-exposed 
cultures revealed considerable G1/G2 forms of AChE accumulated in the ER 
fraction, whereas the treatment of trehalose decreased the accumulation of G1/G2 
AChE. Meanwhile, trehalose reduced the ER stress induced by other AChE 
inhibitors, for example, lycobetaine, bis(3)-cognitin, daurisoline, and 
dauricine, in the cultured neuronal cells. Besides, this tacrine-induced ER 
stress was identified in all AChE isoforms, as well as in butyrylcholinesterase 
(BChE) expressing cells. Thus, we proposed that the AChE inhibitors, 
particularly tacrine, could act as 'chemical/pharmacological chaperones' during 
AChE biosynthesis in the ER, disrupting the proper folding of AChE in neurons as 
a result of ER stress. Trehalose possesses the ability to relieve ER stress by 
promoting the proper assembly of AChE. The results provide guidance for the drug 
design and discovery of AChE inhibitors for AD treatment.

Utility of Pharmacological Agents for Diabetes Mellitus in the Prevention of 
Alzheimer's Disease: Comparison of Metformin, Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) 
Agonists, Insulin, and Sulfonylureas.

BACKGROUND: Metformin is a drug primarily used for the treatment of diabetes 
mellitus (DM), but it also offers clinical benefits that extend beyond glycemic 
control. Existing literature provides an unclear conclusion as to whether 
metformin's benefits extend to preventing neurodegeneration, such as in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: A retrospective database study was conducted to evaluate the likelihood 
of developing AD in DM patients taking metformin compared to those taking 
glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) analogs, sulfonylureas, and short-acting insulin 
variants. An analysis was also run to assess whether metformin has a protective 
benefit for AD and mortality when used in those with DM compared to those 
without DM.
RESULTS: In analyses totaling greater than 2.5 million patients, those on 
metformin had lower A1C percentages and a decreased mortality risk when compared 
to sulfonylureas (HR = 0.519, (CI: (0.493,0.546)), and short-acting insulins (HR 
= 0.372, (CI: (0.364,0.380)). Metformin use for DM was associated with a 
statistically significant increased likelihood of AD diagnosis compared to GLP-1 
use (HR = 2.228, CI: (1.036,4.794)) but an insignificant difference compared to 
both sulfonylureas and insulins. Those with DM were at a significantly higher 
risk of being diagnosed with Alzheimer's compared to those without DM (HR = 
1.826, (CI: 1.579, 2.111)).
CONCLUSIONS: Metformin, previously thought to have significant benefits in 
preventing neurodegeneration, may not be the optimal pharmacologic agent of 
choice, particularly in patients with DM, if neurodegeneration is a primary 
concern in treatment decision-making based on other risk factors.

Ferroptosis is a newly discovered form of programmed cell death, primarily 
caused by an imbalance between iron-dependent oxidative damage and antioxidant 
defense mechanisms within the cell. It differs from previously reported forms of 
cell death, such as apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy, in terms of morphology, 
biochemistry, and genetics. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common 
neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by pathological features including 
neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), senile plaques (SPs), and abnormal iron 
deposition, suggesting that ferroptosis may be involved in its disease 
progression. Although recent studies have made significant progress, the 
mechanisms underlying neuronal ferroptosis in AD remain incompletely understood. 
This review, based on elucidating the process and regulatory mechanisms of 
cellular ferroptosis, explores, and supplements the correlation between iron 
overload and redox imbalance with the main pathological mechanisms of AD, 
providing new insights for the treatment of AD and the development of new drugs.

The delineation of disease progression in neurodegenerative entities offers 
neurobiological insights into pathophysiology as well as practical information 
on natural progression that can be used to gauge the benefits of treatment. In 
AD, FTLD-tau and FTLD-TDP types A and B such advances have been achieved based 
on the investigation of presymptomatic mutation carriers. In the absence of 
dominant mutations, this approach is not feasible in FTLD-TDP type C (TDP-C). 
Considering the subtlety of the initial symptoms, it is almost certain that the 
disease had been progressing for years before the first investigations are 
obtained. We addressed this limitation through an indirect approach based on the 
fact that neurodegeneration in TDP-C can be asymmetric for 5-6 years after 
symptom onset. In time, the contralateral hemisphere starts to show the onset of 
atrophy, the spread of which mirrors the pattern in the affected hemisphere. The 
unaffected hemisphere therefore offers an opportunity for capturing the very 
first emergence of atrophy. To that end, we traced the onset and progression of 
neurodegeneration in TDP-C by analyzing the right hemisphere longitudinally in 
cases of asymmetric left anterior temporal atrophy. In these cases, TDP-C was 
either confirmed at autopsy or suspected based on the clinical features and 
anatomy of atrophy. Structural MRIs were processed using voxel-based morphometry 
and parcellated into cortical and subcortical regions. W-scores were computed to 
identify volume loss relative to age-matched controls. Linear mixed-effects 
models assessed disease progression across regions of interest (ROIs). Results 
of our analyses reveal that atrophy in TDP-C follows a stereotyped progression 
within the right hemisphere, beginning in the ventromedial anterior temporal 
lobe and extending posteriorly and laterally over time. Early atrophy was most 
prominent in the medial temporal pole (planum polare), perirhinal cortex, 
entorhinal cortex, and anterior fusiform cortex, with subcortical involvement 
initially limited to the amygdala. Voxelwise and ROI-based analyses confirmed 
that cortical atrophy preceded and exceeded amygdala atrophy in most cases, 
suggesting greater neocortical vulnerability. Longitudinal linear mixed-effects 
models identified the greatest volume loss in medial temporal ROIs and the 
amygdala, following a consistent anterior-to-posterior gradient over time. These 
findings reconstruct the spatial and temporal progression of TDP-C pathology 
using the initially unaffected hemisphere as a proxy for early disease stages. 
The stereotyped trajectory of atrophy aligns with neuropathological patterns and 
offers critical insights into disease progression, aiding therapeutic 
evaluation.

The rising incidence of neural tumors and neurodegenerative diseases cause 
significant health, emotional, and financial burdens. Conventional treatments 
like surgery and chemotherapy often lack effectiveness. However, advancements in 
nanotechnology, particularly photothermal therapy (PTT), offer new hope. PTT is 
widely studied for neural tumors and neurodegenerative diseases due to its 
simplicity, rapid recovery, combined therapeutic potential, and compatibility 
with imaging techniques. This innovative approach could revolutionize the 
diagnosis and treatment of neural tumors and neurodegenerative diseases, 
addressing current limitations and improving outcomes. In this article, we offer 
a comprehensive overview of the rational design and engineering of various 
nanomaterials designed specifically for PTT applications in neural tumors and 
neurodegenerative diseases, including organic platforms such as liposomes, 
dopamine, etc. and inorganic platforms such as gold nanomaterials, carbon 
nanomaterials, etc. A comparative analysis of these platforms examines their 
biocompatibility and potential for biodegradation. It also assesses their 
manufacturing scalability, cost-effectiveness, regulatory challenges, and 
ultimate potential for clinical translation. We also update the therapeutic 
advances of PTT in neural tumors (Glioma, Peripheral nerve sheath tumors, Spinal 
metastases from in situ tumors and brain metastases) and neurodegenerative 
diseases (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease), and 
systematically summarize the mechanisms of PTT application in neural tumors and 
neurodegenerative diseases. In the end, we provide an in-depth discussion of the 
advantages and disadvantages of PTT and the perspectives for its application in

The integration of pharmacogenetics into personalized medicine enables the 
optimization of drug selection and dosage, maximizing therapeutic benefits while 
minimizing the risk of adverse drug reactions. The association between APOE 
alleles and ARIA, a known adverse reaction in Alzheimer's disease patients 
treated with anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies, has led to the inclusion of 
APOE genotyping among conventional pharmacogenetic tests. Given the dual role of 
APOE alleles, the widespread implementation of this genetic test requires 
caution and should be accompanied by appropriate genetic counselling. APOE 
genotyping is uniquely positioned at the intersection of pharmacogenetics and 
germline testing: it provides insight not only into drug safety (specifically 
the risk of Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormalities) but also into familial risk 
for developing Alzheimer's disease. Carriers of risk alleles, especially 
homozygotes, face the highest risk and require close monitoring. While APOE 
genotyping can inform treatment decisions, it also raises ethical concerns due 
to the broader implications of disclosing genetic risk information for 
neurodegenerative diseases. Identifying a high-risk APOE genotype in a patient 
substantially impacts family members. Therefore, patients considered for 
treatment with anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies should receive comprehensive 
pre- and post-test genetic counseling that goes beyond traditional standards, as 
currently provided for other peculiar tests. Such counseling ensures that 
patients are adequately informed about potential outcomes, psychological 
impacts, and familial implications. It also supports ethical decision-making and 
facilitates truly informed consent, helping to prevent deterministic or overly 
simplistic interpretations of genetic risk.

It is a known fact that Alzheimer's disease causes degeneration of the central 
nervous system, which progresses and causes memory loss as well as loss of 
cognition. For many years, extensive research has been undertaken to find out 
newer possibilities to fight this disease at a molecular level along with many 
long-standing and expensive clinical trials. Many scientific research programs 
have either been discarded or unsuccessful. However, the research has not 
stopped and in the process, many heterocyclic scaffolds have been tried to build 
up novel drug molecules to combat this disease. A literature survey reveals that 
many heterocycles have been explored and were found to be very useful in 
treating many neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, 
Parkinsonism and a few more. This review explains the journey and highlights the 
various strategies to develop new anti-Alzheimer drug candidates. It is a 
concise and rigorous literature excerpt involving research findings on 
heterocyclic scaffolds for treating this disease.

INTRODUCTION: The presence and interaction of multiple comorbid neuropathologies 
are a major contributor to the worldwide dementia burden.
METHODS: We analyzed 1183 subjects from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating 
Center dataset with various combinations of isolated and mixed neurodegenerative 
pathologies and conducted mixed-effects multiple linear regression modeling to 
comprehensively compare the neurocognitive and neuropsychological trajectories 
between groups over time.
RESULTS: In combination with Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change, various 
combinations of limbic-predominant age-related transactive response DNA-binding 
protein 43 encephalopathy, Lewy body dementia, and cerebrovascular disease 
further impair global cognition and specific neurocognitive domains; however, 
they do not appear to extensively affect the rate of decline with time across 
these domains, suggesting an additive but not synergistic effect.
DISCUSSION: These findings corroborate the known cumulative effects of mixed 
pathologies on cognition and add nuance to our understanding of their specific 
interactions, which is crucial for the development of biomarkers and effective 
therapeutics.
HIGHLIGHTS: Mixed neurodegenerative pathologies are common in the elderly 
population. The most common neurodegenerative pathologies were Alzheimer's 
disease neuropathologic change (ADNC), cerebrovascular disease (CVD), Lewy body 
dementia (LBD), and limbic-predominant age-related transactive response 
DNA-binding protein 43 encephalopathy (LATE). The addition of various 
combinations of comorbid CVD, LBD, and LATE to ADNC worsened overall performance 
on cognitive and neuropsychological testing across time. In general, the 
addition of multiple comorbid neurodegenerative pathologies did not influence 
the rate of decline across the evaluated time period.

INTRODUCTION: Identifying dementia neuropathology is critical for guiding 
effective therapies and clinical trials. To tackle this, we developed 
semi-supervised models for identifying neuropathology using low-burden data to 
improve generalizability.
METHODS: We defined low-burden data as being reasonably obtainable at a primary 
care setting. By using a semi-supervised learning paradigm, we can amplify the 
utility of low-burden data. We trained a clustering and a semi-supervised 
prediction model to yield clustering and prediction results for different 
neuropathology lesion types.
RESULTS: Our clustering model identified two clinically meaningful outlier 
groups that were either neuropathology-enriched or -scarce. We predicted 
neuropathology burden across different pathology types and found that using 
low-burden data over multiple clinical visits can predict neuropathology on par 
with using higher-burden data.
DISCUSSION: This work fills a critical gap in the field by using low-burden 
clinical data to predict neuropathology, thereby improving dementia screening, 
therapy, and targeted clinical trials.
HIGHLIGHTS: Clinical data are useful for neuropathology screening in future 
clinical trials. Novel application of semi-supervised learning for identifying 
neuropathology. Clustering model found groups with highly different 
neuropathology prevalence. Low-burden data can provide relatively accurate 
predictions of pathology load. Higher-burden, longitudinal data are most helpful 
for predicting vascular lesions.

An all-encompassing framework seems necessary for understanding brain health in 
the context of neurodegeneration, particularly due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
We argue that current views, dominated by the amyloid-beta hypothesis, 
oversimplify the complexity of brain degeneration. We propose a multi-scale, 
multi-entity approach, treating the brain as a complex system composed of 
interacting subsystems across various scales, from the nanoscale (genes and 
proteins) to the macroscale (cognition) and beyond. By redefining brain health 
through mathematical complexity, we emphasize the importance of integrating 
diverse biological, environmental, and lifestyle factors to account for the 
heterogeneity in AD presentations. This framework suggests that failures at 
different levels of brain function can lead to cascading effects that influence 
neurodegenerative trajectories. Additionally, it calls for a shift toward 
personalized treatment approaches that target multiple yet specific pathological 
mechanisms affecting an individual. We propose computational models as essential 
tools for simulating and testing these complex interactions. Through this 
framework, we aim to provide a deeper understanding of neurodegeneration, and 
advocate for more comprehensive and multi-factorial approaches in both research 
and clinical practice to advance the treatment of brain health disorders such as 
AD.
