Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by impairments in movement and 
cognitive functions. These disorders are frequently associated with the 
accumulation of misfolded protein aggregates, which present significant 
challenges for treatment with conventional small-molecule inhibitors. While 
FDA-approved amyloid-beta-directed antibodies, such as Lecanemab, have recently 
shown clinical success in modifying disease progression, there are currently no 
treatments capable of curing neurodegenerative diseases. Emerging technologies 
like proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) offer additional promise by 
targeting disease-causing proteins for degradation, potentially opening new 
therapeutic avenues. Recent experiments have demonstrated that PROTACs can 
specifically target and degrade pathogenic proteins associated with 
neurodegenerative diseases, thereby offering potential therapeutic avenues. This 
review discusses the latest advances in employing PROTACs for treating 
neurodegenerative diseases and delves into the associated challenges and 
opportunities. Our goal is to provide researchers in drug development with new 
insights on creating novel PROTACs for therapeutic applications.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by cognitive decline, anxiety-like behavior, β-amyloid (Aβ) 
accumulation, and tau hyperphosphorylation. BACE1, the enzyme critical for Aβ 
production, has been a major therapeutic target; however, direct BACE1 
inhibition has been associated with adverse side effects. This study 
investigates the therapeutic potential of RA-PR058, a novel ramalin derivative, 
as a multi-targeted modulator of AD-related pathologies. The effects of RA-PR058 
were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. In vitro studies used SH-SY5Y cells under 
oxidative stress conditions to assess BACE1 expression, while in vivo effects 
were studied in 3xTg-AD mice following one month of oral RA-PR058 treatment. 
Behavioral assessments, biochemical analyses, transcriptomic profiling, and 
pharmacokinetic evaluations were performed to determine the efficacy of 
RA-PR058. RA-PR058 significantly reduced oxidative stress-induced BACE1 
expression in vitro and decreased cortical BACE1 expression in 3xTg-AD mice. In 
vivo treatment alleviated anxiety-like behavior and reduced tau phosphorylation 
at disease-relevant sites (Ser202/Thr205, Thr231, and Ser396). Transcriptomic 
analysis revealed RA-PR058-mediated gene expression changes related to central 
nervous system development, response to hypoxia, and neuroactive ligand-receptor 
interactions, suggesting broader regulatory effects on AD-related pathways. 
Pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated that RA-PR058 exhibits high metabolic 
stability, minimal cytochrome P450 interactions, and moderate blood-brain 
barrier penetration. RA-PR058 demonstrates potential as a multi-target AD 
therapeutic by reducing BACE1 expression, tau hyperphosphorylation, and 
anxiety-like behavior, coupled with favorable pharmacokinetics. Additional 
studies are needed to assess cognitive effects and clarify molecular mechanisms, 
but RA-PR058 may represent a promising advancement in addressing AD's complex 
pathology.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a widespread neurodegenerative disease, 
often accompanied by multiple comorbidities, significantly increasing the risk 
of death for patients. The age adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index (aCCI) is an 
important clinical tool for measuring the burden of comorbidities in patients, 
closely related to mortality and prognosis. This study aims to use the MIMIC-V 
database and various regression and machine learning models to screen and 
validate features closely related to aCCI, providing a theoretical basis for 
personalized management of AD patients.
METHODS: The research data is sourced from the MIMIC-V database, which contains 
detailed clinical information of AD patients. Multiple logistic regression, 
LASSO regression, random forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Extreme 
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) models were used to screen for feature factors 
significantly correlated with aCCI. By comparing model performance, evaluating 
the classification ability and prediction accuracy of each method, and 
ultimately selecting the best model to construct a regression model and a 
nomogram. The model performance is evaluated through classification accuracy, 
net benefit, and robustness. The feature selection results were validated by 
regression analysis.
RESULTS: Multiple models have performed well in classifying aCCI patients, among 
which the model constructed using LASSO regression screening feature factors has 
the best performance, with the highest classification accuracy and net benefit. 
LASSO regression identified the following 11 features closely related to aCCI: 
age, respiratory rate, base excess, glucose, red blood cell distribution width 
(RDW), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), whole blood potassium, hematocrit (HCT), 
phosphate, creatinine, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH). The column chart 
constructed based on these feature factors enables intuitive prediction of 
patients with high aCCI probability, providing a convenient clinical tool.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that the features screened by 
LASSO regression have the best predictive performance and can significantly 
improve the predictive ability of aCCI related comorbidities in AD patients. The 
column chart constructed based on this feature factor provides theoretical 
guidance for personalized management and precise treatment of AD patients.

Tauopathies are a group of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the 
alteration/aggregation of TAU protein. One of the main challenges of these 
diseases is that they have neither biomarkers nor pharmacological targets to 
stop the neurodegenerative process. Apart from the neurodegenerative process, 
tauopathies are also characterized by a chronic low-grade neuroinflammation 
process, where the receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) protein plays 
an essential role. Our research aimed to explore the role of RIPK1 in various 
tauopathies. We examined mouse models of frontotemporal dementia (FTD), as well 
as brain tissue samples from patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), 
a primary form of 4R tauopathy, and Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is 
considered a secondary tauopathy. Our findings show elevated levels of RIPK1 
mRNA levels across various forms of tauopathies, in both mouse models and human 
tissue samples associated with primary and secondary TAU-related disorders. 
Furthermore, we investigated the potential of using a RIPK1 inhibitor, known as 
GSK2982772, in a mouse model as a novel treatment strategy for FTD. The data 
showed that GSK2982772 treatment effectively reduced the reactive astrocyte 
response triggered by TAUP301L overexpression. However, this RIPK1 inhibitor 
failed to protect against the neurodegeneration caused by elevated TAUP301L 
levels in the hippocampal region. These results suggest that although inhibiting 
RIPK1 activity may help reduce TAU-related astrogliosis in the brain, the 
complexity of the inflammatory pathways involved could explain the absence of 
neuroprotective effects against TAU-induced neurodegeneration.

PURPOSE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
with limited treatment options, necessitating the development of safer and more 
effective therapies. The potential of alkaloids derived from the genus Erythrina 
as acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors is being investigated to enhance 
acetylcholine levels in the brain, which is crucial for the treatment of AD. The 
objective of this study is to identify Erythrina alkaloids with strong 
inhibitory capacity against AChE and favorable pharmacokinetic profiles.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A multi-step computational approach was employed, 
beginning with the virtual screening of 143 Erythrina alkaloid structures using 
molecular docking against the human AChE crystal structure. The binding 
affinities were compared with the known AChE inhibitor, galantamine. The top 
alkaloid, 8-oxoerymelanthine (128), was subjected to further analysis through 
molecular dynamics simulations, with the objective of evaluating its stability 
and interactions. In silico ADMET predictions were conducted to assess the 
pharmacokinetic properties. The applicability of Lipinski's Rule of Five was 
applied to evaluate oral drug-likeness.
RESULTS: 8-Oxoerymelanthine (128) exhibited the highest binding affinity and 
remarkable stability in molecular dynamics simulations. The toxicity predictions 
indicated a low risk of mutagenicity, hepatotoxicity, and cardiotoxicity. 
Pharmacokinetic assessments indicated good absorption, moderate blood-brain 
barrier penetration, and favorable metabolic and excretion profiles, supporting 
its potential as an orally active drug candidate.
CONCLUSION: 8-Oxoerythmelanthine (128) exhibits strong potential as an AChE 
inhibitor with a favorable balance of efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic 
properties. These results warrant further investigation in preclinical and 
clinical studies to validate its therapeutic potential and safety for 
Alzheimer's disease treatment.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurological condition that primarily 
affects older people. Currently available AD drugs are associated with side 
effects and there is a need to develop natural drugs from plants. Aquilaria is 
as an endangered medicinal plant genus (commonly called agarwood plants) and 
various products of Aquilaria plant spp. including resinous heartwood, leaves, 
bark, and stem have been widely used in various traditional medicine systems. 
Research on agarwood plants is sparse and only a few previous studies 
demonstrated their neuroprotective properties in vitro. Owing to the presence of 
a plethora of secondary metabolites in agarwood plants, it is imperative not 
only to protect these plants but also evaluate the bioactivity of agarwood 
phytochemicals.
METHODS: This study used Molsoft tools to predict the physicochemical properties 
of agarwood ligands, including the number of H-bond donors and acceptors, polar 
surface area, lipophilicity, solubility, and the molecular polar surface area 
and volume of agarwood ligands. Additionally, ADMET (absorption, digestion, 
metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) properties were predicted using ADMETlab 
2.0. Computational methods such as AutoDock Vina and molecular dynamic (MD) 
simulations were employed for the docking of 41 selected agarwood compounds with 
AD-related molecular targets.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: According to docking data, three compounds aquilarisin 
(ASN), aquilarisinin (ANN), aquilarixanthone (AXN) showed highest binding 
affinity to selected AD targets compared to their known inhibitors. MD 
simulation studies revealed that, selected agarwood compounds' protein-ligand 
complexes showed remarkable structural stability throughout 100ns simulation. 
The agarwood chemicals aquilarisin, aquilarisinin, aquilarixanthone, pillion 
(PLN), and agarotetrol (AGT) are consequently suggested as some of the found 
hits against AD targets, however, additional experimental validation is required 
to establish their effectiveness.

One of the urgent problems of modern health care is Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 
its early diagnosis. This is due to the rapid global spread of AD, the lack of 
pathogenetic therapy, and the ability to stabilize the progression of cognitive 
impairment in the early stages of the disease. Currently, only an autopsy can 
confirm the diagnosis of AD with 100% reliability, and classical laboratory and 
instrumental methods of diagnosis verification are difficult to implement in 
routine clinical practice due to several limitations. That is why the study of 
new and available biomarkers identified in human bodily fluids is promising for 
the early diagnosis of AD. The review addresses the problem of AD verification 
using markers in human bodily fluids, which can be obtained in a non-invasive 
way. Potential biomarkers of AD in saliva, tear fluid, urine, and nasal 
secretion are reviewed, and their prognostic values as AD indicators in the 
early stage are evaluated.

Publisher: Одной из актуальных проблем современного здравоохранения являются 
болезнь Альцгеймера (БА) и ее ранняя диагностика. Это обусловлено быстрым 
глобальным распространением БА, отсутствием патогенетической терапии и 
возможностью стабилизировать прогрессирование когнитивных нарушений на ранних 
стадиях заболевания. В современных условиях только аутопсия способна подтвердить 
диагноз БА с достоверностью в 100%, а классические лабораторно-инструментальные 
методы верификации диагноза сложно внедрить в рутинную клиническую практику, так 
как они имеют ряд ограничений. Именно поэтому исследование новых и доступных 
биомаркеров, выделенных из биологических жидкостей организма человека, 
представляет привлекательную перспективу для ранней диагностики БА. Обзор 
посвящен проблеме верификации БА с помощью маркеров в биологических жидкостях 
организма человека, которые возможно получить неинвазивным способом. Рассмотрены 
потенциальные биомаркеры БА в слюне, слезной жидкости, моче и назальном секрете, 
оценены их прогностические возможности в качестве индикаторов БА на ранней 
стадии.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a distinctive form of dementia characterized by 
age-related cognitive decline and memory impairment. A key hallmark of AD is the 
irreversible overaccumulation of beta-amyloid (Aβ) in the brain, associated with 
neuroinflammation and neuronal death. Although Aβ clearance and immunoregulation 
have been the major therapeutic strategies for AD, highly selective transport 
across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) negatively affects the delivery efficacy of 
the drugs without the ability to cross the BBB. In this review, we discuss the 
potential of lipid-based nanoparticles (LBNs) as promising vehicles for drug 
delivery in AD treatment. LBNs, composed of phospholipid mono- or bilayer, have 
attracted attention due to their exceptional cellular penetration capabilities 
and drug loading capabilities, which also facilitate cargo transcytosis across 
the BBB. Recent advances in the development and engineering of LBNs overcome the 
existing limitations of the current clinical approaches for AD treatment by 
addressing off-target effects and low therapeutic efficacy. Here, we review the 
transport pathways across the BBB, as well as various types of LBNs for AD 
therapy, including exosomes, liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), and 
nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs), to elucidate their distinctive properties, 
preparation methodologies, and therapeutic efficacy, thereby offering innovative 
avenues for novel drug development for clinical translation in AD therapy.

Inflammation plays a key role in the development of neurodegenerative disorders 
that are currently incurable. Licochalcone A (LCA) has been described as an 
emerging anti-inflammatory drug with multiple therapeutical properties that 
could potentially prevent neurodegeneration. However, its neuroprotective 
mechanism remains unclear. Here, we investigated if LCA prevents cognitive 
decline induced by Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and elucidated its potential 
benefits. For that, 8-week-old C57BL6/J male mice were intraperitonially (i.p.) 
treated with saline solution or LCA (15 mg/kg/day, 3 times per week) for two 
weeks. The last day, a single i.p injection of LPS (1 mg/kg) or saline solution 
was administered 24 h before sacrifice. The results revealed a significant 
reduction in mRNA expression in genes involved in oxidative stress (Sod1, Cat, 
Pkm, Pdha1, Ndyfv1, Uqcrb1, Cycs and Cox4i1), metabolism (Slc2a1, Slc2a2, Prkaa1 
and Gsk3b) and synapsis (Bdnf, Nrxn3 and Nlgn2) in LPS group compared to saline. 
These findings were linked to memory impairment and depressive-like behavior 
observed in this group. Interestingly, LCA protected against LPS alterations 
through its anti-inflammatory effect, reducing gliosis and regulating M1/M2 
markers. Moreover, LCA-treated animals showed a significant improvement of 
antioxidant mechanisms, such as citrate synthase activity and SOD2. 
Additionally, LCA demonstrated protection against metabolic disturbances, 
downregulating GLUT4 and P-AKT, and enhanced the expression of synaptic-related 
proteins (P-CREB, BDNF, PSD95, DBN1 and NLG3), leading all together to dendritic 
spine preservation. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that LCA treatment 
prevents LPS-induced cognitive decline by reducing inflammation, enhancing the 
antioxidant response, protecting against metabolic disruptions and improving 
synapsis related mechanisms.

Transforming growth factor beta receptor 3 (TGFBR3), also known as betaglycan, 
is a member of the TGF-β receptor family. In our previous study, bioinformatics 
analysis revealed that TGFBR3 levels are elevated in patients with Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) and identified TGFBR3 as a potential risk factor for the disease. 
However, the precise role of TGFBR3 in the pathogenesis of AD remains largely 
unclear. In this study, we first validated the elevated levels of TGFBR3 in 
postmortem brain tissues from AD patients using immunohistochemical staining. 
Subsequently, gain-of-function experiments and behavioral tests were conducted 
to explore the functional role of TGFBR3 in the APP/PS1 mouse model. Our 
findings confirmed that TGFBR3 levels were significantly increased in AD 
patients compared to normal controls. Overexpression of TGFBR3 in APP/PS1 mice 
impaired spatial learning and memory abilities and promoted amyloid-β (Aβ) 
accumulation. Additionally, TGFBR3 overexpression exacerbated neuronal apoptosis 
and synaptic loss. We also observed that overexpression of TGFBR3 triggered an 
inflammatory response by promoting microglial polarization to the M1 phenotype, 
although it had no effect on astrocyte activation. In conclusion, our study 
demonstrates that increased TGFBR3 levels worsen cognitive impairment and 
accelerate pathological progression in APP/PS1 mice, suggesting that TGFBR3 
could serve as a potential therapeutic target for AD treatment.

Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) with little or no quantifiable insoluble 
brain tau neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology demonstrate stronger clinical 
benefits of therapies than those with advanced NFTs. The formation of NFTs can 
be prevented by targeting the intermediate soluble tau assemblies (STAs). 
However, biochemical understanding and biomarkers of STAs are lacking. We show 
that Tris-buffered saline-soluble tau aggregates from autopsy-verified AD brain 
tissues include the core sequence ~tau258-368. In neuropathological assessments, 
antibodies against the phosphorylation sites serine-262 and serine-356 within 
the STA core almost exclusively stained granular (that is, prefibrillar) tau 
aggregates in pre-NFTs while antibodies against phosphorylation at serine-202 
and threonine-205 and threonine-231, outside the STA core, stained the entire 
spectrum of tau aggregates in pre-NFTs and mature NFTs, dystrophic neurites and 
neuropil threads in the hippocampus. Functionally, a recombinantly produced STA 
core peptide robustly altered neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission in 
mouse hippocampal brain slices. Furthermore, we developed a cerebrospinal fluid 
assay that differentiated STAs in AD from non-AD tauopathies, correlated with 
the severity of NFT burden and cognitive decline independently of amyloid beta 
deposition, and with tau positron emission tomography uptake across Braak NFT 
stages. Together, our findings inform about the status of early-stage tau 
aggregation, reveal aggregation-relevant phosphorylation epitopes in tau and 
offer a diagnostic biomarker and targeted therapeutic opportunities for AD.

Trafficking defects in retinal pigmented epithelial (RPE) cells contribute to 
RPE atrophy, a hallmark of geographic atrophy (GA) in dry age-related macular 
degeneration (AMD). Dry AMD pathogenesis is multifactorial, including amyloid-β 
(Aβ) accumulation and oxidative stress-common features of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). The Sigma-2 receptor (S2R) regulates lipid and protein trafficking, and 
S2R modulators reverse trafficking deficits in neurodegeneration in vitro 
models. Given overlapping mechanisms contributing to AD and AMD, S2R modulator 
effects on RPE function were investigated. The S2R modulator CT1812 is in 
clinical trials for AD, dementia with Lewy bodies, and GA. Leveraging AD trials 
testing CT1812, unbiased analyses of patient biofluid proteomes revealed that 
proteins altered by CT1812 associated with GA and macular degeneration disease 
ontologies and overlapped with proteins altered in dry AMD. Differential 
expression analysis of RPE transcripts from APP-Swedish/London mutant transgenic 
mice, a model featuring Aβ accumulation, revealed reversal of 
autophagy/trafficking transcripts in S2R modulator-treated animals versus 
vehicle toward healthy control levels. Photoreceptor outer segment (POS) 
trafficking in human RPE cells showed deficits in response to Aβ1-42 or hydrogen 
peroxide compared to vehicle. S2R modulators normalized stressor-induced POS 
trafficking deficits, resembling healthy control. Taken together, S2R modulation 
may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for dry AMD.

The molecular mechanism of verbascoside(OC1) in promoting acetylcholine(ACh) 
release in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease(AD) was studied. Adrenal 
pheochromocytoma cells(PC12) of rats induced by β-amyloid 
protein(1-42)(Aβ_(1-42)) were used as AD models in vitro and were divided into 
control group, model group(Aβ_(1-42) 10 μmol·L~(-1)), OC1 treatment group(2 and 
10 μg·mL~(-1)). The effect of OC1 on phosphorylated proteins in AD models was 
analyzed by whole protein phosphorylation quantitative omics, and the 
selectivity of OC1 for calcium channel subtypes was virtually screened in 
combination with computer-aided drug design. The fluorescence probe Fluo-3/AM 
was used to detect Ca~(2+) concentration in cells. Western blot analysis was 
performed to detect the effects of OC1 on the expression of phosphorylated 
calmodulin-dependent protein kinase Ⅱ(p-CaMKⅡ, Thr286) and synaptic 
vesicle-related proteins, and UPLC/Q Exactive MS was used to detect the effects 
of OC1 on ACh release in AD models. The effects of OC1 on acetylcholine 
esterase(AChE) activity in AD models were detected. The results showed that the 
differentially modified proteins in the model group and the OC1 treatment group 
were related to calcium channel activation at three levels: GO classification, 
KEGG pathway, and protein domain. The results of molecular docking revealed the 
dominant role of L-type calcium channels. Fluo-3/AM fluorescence intensity 
decreased under the presence of Ca~(2+) chelating agent ethylene glycol 
tetraacetic acid(EGTA), L-type calcium channel blocker verapamil, and N-type 
calcium channel blocker conotoxin, and the effect of verapamil was stronger than 
that of conotoxin. This confirmed that OC1 promoted extracellular Ca~(2+) influx 
mainly through its interaction with L-type calcium channel protein. In addition, 
proteomic analysis and Western blot results showed that the expression of 
p-CaMKⅡ and downstream vesicle-related proteins was up-regulated after OC1 
treatment, indicating that OC1 acted on vesicle-related proteins by activating 
CaMKⅡ and participated in synaptic remodeling and transmitter release, thus 
affecting learning and memory. OC1 also decreased the activity of AChE and 
prolonged the action time of ACh in synaptic gaps.

This study explored the action mechanism of Jiawei Xionggui Decoction in the 
treatment of Alzheimer's disease(AD) by integrating mouse brain tissue 
metabolomics and network pharmacology. Six-month-old amyloid precursor 
protein/presenilin 1(APP/PS1) mice were selected and divided into the APP/PS1 
group and Jiawei Xionggui Decoction intervention group, with age-matched C57BL/6 
mice serving as controls. Cognitive abilities and pathological damage in the 
mice were observed. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass 
spectrometry(GC-MS/MS) technology was utilized to analyze the metabolic profiles 
of mice brain tissue. Differential metabolites were screened, and relevant 
metabolic pathways were enriched. Network pharmacology was adopted to screen the 
active components of Jiawei Xionggui Decoction, so as to construct a 
protein-protein interaction network of its core targets for AD treatment and 
conduct Gene Ontology(GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes(KEGG) 
enrichment analysis of potential targets for Jiawei Xionggui Decoction in 
treating AD. Finally, a &quot;metabolite-reaction-enzyme-gene&quot; network was 
constructed for combined analysis of metabolomics and network pharmacology. The 
results showed that Jiawei Xionggui Decoction significantly reversed the trends 
of 18 differential metabolites involved in 15 metabolic pathways such as 
glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, glycine, serine, and threonine 
metabolism, pyruvate metabolism, alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism, 
and tricarboxylic acid cycle(TCA) in mouse brain tissue. Furthermore, 383 core 
targets of Jiawei Xionggui Decoction were implicated in pathways like the 
phosphoinositide 3-kinase(PI3K)/protein kinase B(Akt) signaling pathway and 
calcium signaling pathway. Overall analysis indicated that energy metabolism, 
amino acid metabolism, and fatty acid metabolism were crucial metabolic pathways 
for Jiawei Xionggui Decoction in treating AD. The findings suggest that Jiawei 
Xionggui Decoction can protect neuronal cells in mouse brain tissue, thus 
improving cognitive impairment.

The aim of this study is to investigate the regulation of Kaixin San-medicated 
serum(KXS-MS) on autophagy induced by Aβ_(25-35) in SH-SY5Y cells. The SH-SY5Y 
cell model of Aβ_(25-35)(25 μmol·L~(-1))-induced injury was established, and 
different concentrations of KXS-MS were added into the culture media of cells, 
which were then incubated for 24 h. Cell viability was measured by the methyl 
thiazolyl tetrazolium(MTT) assay. The protein levels of microtubule-associated 
protein 1 light chain 3(LC3)Ⅰ, LC3Ⅱ, protein kinase B(Akt), p-Akt, mammalian 
target of rapamycin(mTOR), and p-mTOR were assessed by Western blot. 
Furthermore, the combination of rapamycin(Rapa)/3-methyladenine(3-MA) and low 
concentration of KXS-MS was added to the culture medium of SH-SY5Y cells injured 
by Aβ_(25-35), and the cell viability and the expression levels of the above 
proteins were determined. The results showed that Aβ_(25-35) decreased the cell 
viability, up-regulated the expression levels of LC3Ⅱ and LC3Ⅱ/LC3Ⅰ, and 
down-regulated the expression levels of p-Akt, p-mTOR, p-Akt/Akt, and 
p-mTOR/mTOR. Compared with the Aβ_(25-35) model group, KXS-MS treatment 
attenuated Aβ_(25-35)-induced injury and enhanced the survival of SH-SY5Y cells. 
Meanwhile, KXS-MS down-regulated the LC3Ⅱ/LC3Ⅰ level and up-regulated the 
p-Akt/Akt and p-mTOR/mTOR levels. Compared with the low-concentration KXS-MS 
group, Rapa did not affect the cell survival and the levels of p-Akt and 
p-Akt/Akt, while it up-regulated the levels of LC3Ⅱ and LC3Ⅱ/LC3Ⅰ and 
down-regulated the levels of p-mTOR and p-mTOR/mTOR. 3-MA significantly reduced 
the cell survival rate and p-Akt, p-Akt/Akt level in the KXS-MS group, while it 
had no significant effect on the levels of LC3Ⅱ, LC3Ⅱ/LC3Ⅰ, p-mTOR, and 
p-mTOR/mTOR. The above results indicate that KXS-MS exhibits protective effects 
against Aβ_(25-35)-induced damage in SH-SY5Y cells by up-regulating Akt/mTOR 
activity to inhibit autophagy.

This study aims to investigate the therapeutic effect and mechanism of Daotan 
Xixin Decoction on APP/PS1 mice. Twelve APP/PS1 male mice were randomized into 
four groups: APP/PS1 and low-, medium-, and high-dose Daotan Xixin Decoction. 
Three C57BL/6 wild-type mice were used as the control group. The learning and 
memory abilities of mice in each group were examined by the Morris water maze 
test. The pathological changes of hippocampal nerve cells were observed by 
hematoxylin-eosin staining and Nissl staining. Immunohistochemistry was employed 
to detect the expression of β-amyloid(Aβ)_(1-42) in the hippocampal tissue. The 
high-dose Daotan Xixin Decoction group with significant therapeutic effects and 
the model group were selected for high-throughput sequencing. The differentially 
expressed gene(DEG) analysis, Gene Ontology(GO) analysis, Kyoto Encyclopedia of 
Genes and Genomes(KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis, and Gene Set Variation 
Analysis(GSVA) were performed on the sequencing results. RT-qPCR and Western 
blot were conducted to determine the mRNA and protein levels, respectively, of 
some DEGs. Compared with the APP/PS1 group, Daotan Xixin Decoction at different 
doses significantly improved the learning and memory abilities of APP/PS1 mice, 
ameliorated the neuropathological damage in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, 
increased the number of neurons, and decreased the deposition of Aβ_(1-42) in 
the brain. A total of 1 240 DEGs were screened out, including 634 genes with 
up-regulated expression and 606 genes with down-regulated expression. The GO 
analysis predicted the biological processes including RNA splicing and protein 
folding, the cellular components including spliceosome complexes and nuclear 
spots, and the molecular functions including unfolded protein binding and heat 
shock protein binding. The KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed the 
involvement of neurodegenerative disease pathways, amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis, and splicing complexes. Further GSVA pathway enrichment analysis 
showed that the down-regulated pathways involved nuclear 
factor-κB(NF-κB)-mediated tumor necrosis factor-α(TNF-α) signaling pathway, UV 
response, and unfolded protein response, while the up-regulated pathways 
involved the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. The results of RT-qPCR and Western 
blot showed that compared with the APP/PS1 group, Daotan Xixin Decoction at 
different doses down-regulated the mRNA and protein levels of signal transducer 
and activator of transcription 3(STAT3), NF-κB, and interleukin-6(IL-6) in the 
hippocampus. In conclusion, Daotan Xixin Decoction can improve the learning and 
memory abilities of APP/PS1 mice by regulating the STAT3/NF-κB/IL-6 signaling 
pathway.

This study explores the mechanism of Guben Jiannao Liquid on Alzheimer's 
disease(AD) by regulating autophagy based on the liver kinase B1(LKB1)/adenosine 
monophosphate-activated protein kinase(AMPK)/mammalian target of rapamycin(mTOR) 
pathway. Male SD rats were randomly divided into the blank group, model group, 
low-dose and high-dose groups of Guben Jiannao Liquid, and rapamycin group, with 
10 rats in each group. Except for the blank group, all other groups of rats were 
injected bilaterally in the hippocampus with β-amyloid(Aβ)_(1-42) to establish 
the AD model. The low-dose(6.21 g·kg~(-1)) and high-dose(12.42 g·kg~(-1)) groups 
of Guben Jiannao Liquid and rapamycin group(1 mg·kg~(-1)) were given the 
corresponding drugs by gavage, and the blank and model groups were given an 
equal volume of saline by gavage for four weeks. Morris water maze was used to 
test the learning and memory ability of rats in each group; 
hematoxylin-eosin(HE) and Nissl staining were used to observe the morphological 
and quantitative changes of neurons and Nissl bodies in the CA1 region of rat 
hippocampus; immunohistochemistry was utilized to detect Aβ-positive cell 
expression in the CA1 region of rat hippocampus; transmission electron 
microscopy was employed to observe ultrastructural changes in rat hippocampal 
tissue, and Western blot was used to examine the protein expression levels of 
LKB1, p-AMPK/AMPK, p-mTOR/mTOR, Beclin1, p62, and LC3-Ⅱ in the hippocampal 
tissue of the rats. The results showed that compared with those in the blank 
group, rats in the model group had elevated evasion latency and decreased number 
of platform transversal and residence time in the platform quadrant. The number 
of neurons in the hippocampal area was reduced, and the morphology was impaired. 
The average integral optical density value of Aβ-positive cells was elevated; 
the expression levels of LKB1, p-AMPK/AMPK, Beclin1, and LC3-Ⅱ were decreased, 
and the expression levels of p-mTOR/mTOR and p62 were increased. Compared with 
those in the model group, rats in the low-dose and high-dose groups of Guben 
Jiannao Liquid had shorter evasion latency, higher number of platform 
transversal, longer residence time in the platform quadrant, increased number of 
neurons, decreased expression of Aβ-positive cells and average integral optical 
density values, and increased number of autophagic lysosomes in hippocampal 
tissue. The expression levels of LKB1, Beclin1, and LC3-Ⅱ were elevated in the 
hippocampus of rats in the low-dose group of Guben Jiannao Liquid. The 
expression levels of LKB1, p-AMPK/AMPK, Beclin1, and LC3-Ⅱ were elevated in the 
hippocampal tissue of rats in the high-dose group of Guben Jiannao Liquid, and 
the expression levels of p-mTOR/mTOR and p62 were decreased. The findings 
suggest that Guben Jiannao Liquid can improve cognitive impairment in AD rats, 
and its mechanism of action may be related to the activation of the 
LKB1/AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway and the up-regulation of autophagy level.

To study the ameliorative effect of Eucommiae Cortex extract on spatial learning 
disabilities in APP/PS1 double-transgenic mice and explore its relationship with 
estrogen receptor β(ERβ)/c-Jun N-terminal kinase(JNK) signaling pathway, sixty 
3-month-old male APP/PS1 mice were randomly divided into a model group, an 
anti-brain failure capsule group(0.585 g·kg~(-1)), a donepezil hydrochloride 
group(0.65 mg·kg~(-1)), and a Eucommiae Cortex extract group(1.3 g·kg~(-1)), and 
15 C57BL/6 mice of the same genetic background were set as WT control group. The 
learning and memory ability of mice was assessed by the Morris water maze 
test(MWM), the passive avoidance test(PAT), and the novel object recognition 
test(NOR). The histomorphological and cellular ultrastructural features of the 
hippocampal region of the mice were observed by hematoxylin-eosin(HE) staining 
and transmission electron microscopy(TEM); the molecular docking validation of 
the key active ingredients and the key targets was performed by using AutoDock 
Vina software, and the immunohistochemical method(IHC) was used to detect the 
ERβ expression in the dentate gyrus(DG) area of mouse hippocampus. Western 
blot(WB) was utilized to detect the expression of ERβ, p-JNK, and JNK in mouse 
hippocampal area. Compared with those in the WT control group, the results of 
behavioral experiments showed that the latency of the mice in the model group 
was significantly increased, the number of platform traversals, and the target 
quadrant residence time were significantly decreased in the MWM. The evasion 
latency was significantly reduced, and the number of errors was significantly 
increased in the PAT. The index of recognition of novel objects was 
significantly reduced in the NOR. The results of HE staining indicated that the 
hippocampal area of mice in the model group showed a decrease in the number of 
neurons, disorganization of pyramidal cell arrangement, nucleus consolidation, 
and other changes. TEM results showed that some neuronal nuclei in the 
hippocampal area had a consolidated state, slightly thickened and aberrant 
nuclear membranes, and fewer intracytoplasmic nidus bodies; the IHC results 
showed that the expression of ERβ in the hippocampal DG area of the mice was 
reduced. The WB results showed that the ERβ expression in the hippocampal tissue 
was decreased, and the p-JNK/JNK level was elevated. Compared with the model 
group, the Eucommiae Cortex extract group showed a significant decrease in 
latency, and increase in number of platform traversals and target quadrant 
residence time in the MWM, a significant increase in evasion latency and 
decrease in number of errors in the PAT, and a significant increase in the index 
of recognition of novel objects in the NOR. In addition, there was an increase 
in the number of neurons in the hippocampal area of mice. The pyramidal cells 
tended to be arranged in an orderly manner; the nuclei of neurons in the 
hippocampal area were in a better state; the expression of ERβ in the 
hippocampal DG area of the mice was elevated; the expression of ERβ in the 
hippocampal tissue was elevated, and the level of p-JNK/JNK was reduced. The 
effects of donepezil hydrochloride group and anti-brain failure capsule on 
APP/PS1 mice in terms of behavioral, HE, and TEM indexes were similar to those 
of Eucommiae Cortex extract, and there was no significant difference between 
donepezil hydrochloride group and the model group in IHC and WB experiments, and 
the results of molecular docking indicated that the estrogen-like components in 
Eucommiae Cortex extract were tightly bound to ERβ. In conclusion, the binding 
of Eucommiae Cortex extract to estrogen receptors, regulation of ERβ expression, 
and activation of ERβ/JNK signaling pathway may be one of the key mechanisms by 
which it improves the learning and memory ability of APP/PS1 mice.

Vascular endothelial cell-expressing molecules regulate neuronal function. 
Although cerebrovascular dysregulation is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), the effect of changes in molecular expression on neuronal function in 
vascular endothelial cells during disease progression is not clear. In this 
study, we demonstrated that the cellular communication network factor 1 (CCN1), 
which is highly expressed in vascular endothelial cells during the chronic stage 
of AD in mice, is involved in the impairment of cognitive function. Vascular 
endothelial cells isolated from the brains of AppNL-G-F mice show differential 
expression of genes, including CCN1. CCN1 treatment decreased the synaptic 
number in cultured hippocampal cells, with changes in the expression of genes 
associated with morphological changes. In vivo, AppNL-G-F mice with CCN1 
silencing in vascular endothelial cells demonstrated high spine density and 
improved spatial learning. No significant change was observed in the number of 
microglia/macrophages, astrocytes, and amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulation in the 
hippocampus of the mice. These results suggest that CCN1 is a key factor 
modulating neurological dysfunction through neurovascular interactions.

Neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2), encoded by the SMPD3 gene, is a pivotal 
enzyme in sphingolipid metabolism, hydrolyzing sphingomyelin to produce 
ceramide, a bioactive lipid involved in apoptosis, inflammation, membrane 
structure, and extracellular vesicle (EV) biogenesis. nSMase2 is abundantly 
expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), particularly in neurons, and its 
dysregulation is implicated in pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), prion diseases, 
and neuroviral diseases. In this review, we discuss the critical role of nSMase2 
in the CNS and its involvement in neurological as well as non-neurological 
diseases. We explore the enzyme's functions in sphingolipid metabolism, its 
regulatory mechanisms, and the implications of its dysregulation in disease 
pathogenesis. The chapter highlights the therapeutic potential of 
pharmacologically targeting nSMase2 with small molecule inhibitors and 
emphasizes the need for further research to optimize inhibitor specificity and 
efficacy for clinical applications. By understanding the multifaceted roles of 
nSMase2, we aim to provide insights into novel therapeutic strategies for 
treating complex diseases associated with its dysregulation.

Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), encoded by the EPHX2 gene, is a critical enzyme 
involved in the metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids, specifically 
anti-inflammatory epoxy fatty acids (EpFAs). By converting EpFAs into less 
active forms, sEH promotes inflammation. Preclinical data using knock-out and 
overexpression of the Ephx2 gene have demonstrated its key role in the 
development and progression of symptoms in various disease models. Inhibition of 
sEH increases EpFAs, thereby enhancing their anti-inflammatory effects and 
reducing the levels of pro-inflammatory mediators. Numerous preclinical studies 
suggest that sEH inhibitors show promise in reducing inflammation and its 
related symptoms across various diseases, highlighting their therapeutic 
potential. This chapter reviews the role of sEH in the development and 
progression of various disorders including psychiatric disorders (depression, 
schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder), neurological disorders (Alzheimer's 
disease, Parkinson's disease, brain injury), and pain.

Neurological diseases, including both acute injuries and chronic 
neurodegenerative disorders, represent major contributors to morbidity and 
mortality worldwide. Chronic neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), which require long-term management, 
present significant challenges in the search for neuroprotective agents with 
reduced adverse effects and enhanced therapeutic efficacy. Sulforaphane (SFN), a 
bioactive compound found in cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and 
cauliflower, has garnered considerable attention for its potent neuroprotective 
properties and overall health benefits. Marketed primarily as a dietary 
supplement, SFN has shown a variety of biological activities and therapeutic 
potential in neurological diseases. Recent surging studies including ours have 
highlighted its ability to impede the progression of AD, PD, and cerebral 
ischemia by fostering neurogenesis and inhibiting apoptosis, oxidative stress, 
and neuroinflammation. This review aims to summarize the latest research on SFN, 
exploring its advanced therapeutic potential and underlying mechanisms in 
various neurological diseases, offering a comprehensive overview for researchers 
focused on neurological pathogenesis and drug development in neuroprotection.

BACKGROUND: Nearly one-third of older American adults have cognitive impairment 
(mild cognitive impairment or subjective cognitive decline). Cognitive 
impairment (CI) has an extraordinary impact on older adults, caregivers (CG), 
and society. Deteriorating life satisfaction in persons with CI (PwCI) and their 
primary CG is a prevalent problem. However, there is a paucity of research on a 
strength-based, positive health approach, and supportive care for PwCI and their 
CG.
OBJECTIVES: The promoting re-engagement in meaningful activity (PRIMA) study is 
a randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of the Daily Engagement in 
Meaningful Activity (DEMA) intervention for PwCI and their CGs. The primary aim 
is to test DEMA's efficacy for improving life satisfaction in PwCI and their CGs 
over time. The second aim evaluates how the intervention improves activity 
performance, decreases depressive symptoms and anxiety in PwCI and CGs, and 
reduces CG burden over time. The third aim is to explore the treatment's 
efficacy among a sub-sample of PwCIs with (and without) depressive symptoms 
(Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 ≥ 5 at baseline) for improvement in health 
outcomes over time.
METHODS: The study population consists of dyads, a PwCI and their CG. The PwCI 
must be 60 years old and have CI. A total of 200 PwCI-CG dyads will be 
randomized to the DEMA or attention control group. Outcome assessments are 
conducted over 9-months (baseline, 10 days-, 3- and 6- months 
post-intervention).
DISCUSSION: The DEMA results will inform care for the broader PwCI and CG 
population in community and home-based settings.

IMPORTANCE: Blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer disease (AD) are clinically 
available, but their value is not well understood in syndromes typically 
associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration syndromes (FTLD).
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical importance and detectability of AD in 
FTLD-related neurodegenerative syndromes using 3 plasma biomarkers, 
phosphorylated tau 217 (p-tau217), neurofilament light chain (NfL), and glial 
fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This clinicopathological study took place at 
the University of California San Francisco Alzheimer Disease Research Center 
from August 2008 to July 2022. Autopsied individuals with clinical evaluation 
and neuropathological examination, diagnosed with clinical syndromes related to 
AD (n = 125), frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD; n = 198), or cognitively 
unimpaired (CU) at the time of evaluation (n = 16) were included.
EXPOSURES: AD-related or FTLD-related clinical syndromes or CU.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: P-tau217, NfL, and GFAP were measured with 
single-molecule array (SIMOA). AD was defined as intermediate or high AD 
neuropathological change (ADNC) at autopsy. Clinical biomarker associations were 
evaluated using linear regressions. Imaging analyses used bayesian linear 
mixed-effects modeling.
RESULTS: A total of 349 individuals (191 [55%] male; mean [SD] age at death, 72 
[11] years) were included. AD was common in both AD-related syndromes (110/125 
[88%]) and FTLD-related syndromes (45/198 [23%]). Neuropathological stage at 
autopsy was higher in AD-related syndromes (high ADNC: 82/88 [93%] AD vs 13/23 
[56%] FTLD), and AD was frequently considered a copathology in FTLD-related 
syndromes (30/198 [15%]). Plasma p-tau217 concentrations were higher in 
AD-related syndromes (mean [SD], 0.28 [0.16] pg/mL) than FTLD-related syndromes 
(mean [SD], 0.10 [0.09] pg/mL) (P < .05). Plasma p-tau217 concentrations were 
highest in atypical AD-related syndromes (mean [SD], 0.33 [0.02] pg/mL), 
followed by typical late-onset amnestic syndromes (mean [SD], 0.27 [0.03] 
pg/mL). FTLD-related syndromes with AD (mean [SD], 0.19 [0.02] pg/mL) were 
higher compared to without (mean [SD], 0.07 [0.00] pg/mL). Plasma p-tau217 
detected AD neuropathology across syndromes (area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve [AUC], 0.95; 95% CI, 0.93-0.97), with slightly better 
performance in AD-related syndromes (AUC, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.95-1.00) compared to 
FTLD-related syndromes (AUC, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.83-0.94). NfL and GFAP had lower 
performance for detecting AD (AUC, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.68-0.78 and AUC, 0.75; 95% 
CI, 0.67-0.80, respectively) and added little to no diagnostic value either 
alone or in combinations with p-tau217. The presence of AD in FTLD-related 
syndromes was associated with lower Mini-Mental State Examination score (mean 
[SD], -2.90 [1.09]; P < .05), worse performance on memory (mean [SD] z score, 
-0.64 [0.32]), executive (mean [SD] z score, -0.74 [0.19]), and visuospatial 
composites (mean [SD] z score, -0.88 [0.37]) as well as increased rates of 
posterior cortical atrophy.
CONCLUSION: Clinically relevant AD was prevalent across neurodegenerative 
syndromes and detectable with plasma p-tau217. Plasma p-tau217 may be a useful 
tool to investigate the clinical impact of AD copathology in non-AD 
neurodegenerative syndromes, including the effect of disease-modifying 
therapies.

Today, herbal drugs are prominent in the pharmaceutical industry due to their 
well-known therapeutic and side effects. Plant-based compounds often face 
limitations such as poor solubility, low bioavailability, and instability in 
physiological environments, restricting their therapeutic efficacy and delivery. 
Nanotechnology-based solutions, including nanoparticle formulations and advanced 
delivery systems like liposomes and transfersomes, address these issues by 
enhancing solubility, stability, bioavailability, and targeted delivery, thereby 
optimizing the therapeutic potential of phytoactive compounds. Neuroinflammation 
can be a cause of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and 
Parkinson's diseases, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Consequently, there is a 
need for the optimal delivery of a pharmacological anti-inflammatory agents to 
the CNS. Thus, the non-invasive administration of a stable compound at a 
therapeutic concentration is needed to assure molecule crossing through the 
blood-brain barrier. Natural resources have more structural diversity and 
novelty than synthetic compounds, e.g. plant-derived drug products have higher 
molecular weights, incorporate more oxygen atoms, and are more complex. As a 
result, plant-derived products have unique features which can be used to 
effectively modulate neuroinflammation. Therefore, this review aims to identify 
herbal molecules capable of targeting neuroinflammation and present novel 
strategies for their efficient delivery.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a slow brain degeneration disorder in which the 
accumulation of beta-amyloid precursor plaque and an intracellular 
neurofibrillary tangle of hyper-phosphorylated tau proteins in the brain have 
been implicated in neurodegeneration. In this study, we identified the most 
important genes that are unique and sensitive in the entorhinal region of the 
brain to target AD effectively. At first, microarrays data are selected and 
constructed protein-protein interaction network (PPIN) and gene regulatory 
network (GRN) from differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using Cytoscape 
software. Then, networks analysis was performed to determine hubs, bottlenecks, 
clusters, and signaling pathways in AD. Finally, critical genes were selected as 
targets for repurposing drugs. Analyzing the constructed PPIN and GRN identified 
CD44, ELF1, HSP90AB1, NOC4L, BYSL, RRP7A, SLC17A6, and RUVBL2 as critical genes 
that are dysregulated in the entorhinal region of AD suffering patients. The 
functional enrichment analysis revealed that DEG nodes are involved in the 
synaptic vesicle cycle, glutamatergic synapse, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, 
retrograde endocannabinoid signaling, endocrine and other factor-regulated 
calcium reabsorption, ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes, and nicotine addiction. 
Gentamicin, isoproterenol, and tumor necrosis factor are repurposing new drugs 
that target CD44, which plays an important role in the development of AD. 
Following our model validation using the existing experimental data, our model 
based on previous experimental reports suggested critical molecules and 
candidate drugs involved in AD for further investigations in vitro and in vivo.

Preliminary Evidence of Higher Production of LPS-induced Proinflammatory 
Cytokines in Retired Versus Employed Dementia Caregivers.

Paoletti-Hatcher J, Argueta DL, Denny BT, Derrick JL, Green CE, Lai VD, Medina 
LD, Schulz PE, Stinson JM, Wu-Chung EL, Heijnen CJ, Fagundes CP.

OBJECTIVE: Nearly half of all informal (unpaid) family caregivers for patients 
with Alzheimer disease or related dementias (ADRD) are employed. We test 
competing hypotheses on the role of employment for ADRD spousal caregivers, as 
some evidence suggests that stress from work and caregiving will have an 
additive effect. Other evidence suggests that psychological resources generated 
at work may buffer stress at home. Psychological stress is associated with 
immune dysregulation; we examined the role of employment status on 
proinflammatory cytokine production.
METHODS: We tested competing hypotheses cross-sectionally in a sample of 113 
ADRD spousal caregivers, including 26 employed caregivers (working full-time or 
part-time) and 87 retired caregivers. We examined the effect of employment 
status on a composite of monocyte-stimulated interleukin-6, tumor necrosis 
factor-α, and interleukin-1 beta in unadjusted models and in models adjusting 
for covariates.
RESULTS: Employed ADRD spousal caregivers had lower composite proinflammatory 
cytokine production than retired ADRD spousal caregivers. In exploratory 
follow-up analyses, neither caregiver depressive symptoms, anticipatory grief, 
nor negative affect explained the impact of employment status on proinflammatory 
cytokine production.
CONCLUSIONS: Employed ADRD caregivers had lower proinflammatory cytokine 
production than retired ADRD caregivers. There may be many reasons for this 
finding; employed ADRD caregivers have another domain to fulfill their 
psychological needs, may benefit financially, and may exhibit better coping than 
their retired counterparts. Future investigations should examine psychological 
mechanisms for protecting caregivers' health through positive work experiences 
to employ such experiences in retired caregivers.

The scientific community has united to raise awareness of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) as a critical condition for future generations because recent predictions 
indicate that it will become common among the elderly within a few years. 
Nevertheless, the intricacies of the disease's progression demand exhaustive 
investigations to unravel its potential mechanisms. Only then can clinicians 
develop more efficacious therapeutic strategies. Cognitive impairment caused by 
amyloid aggregation, the development of hyperphosphorylated neurofibrillary 
tangles, and a malfunctioning cholinergic system are the hallmarks of AD. Even 
after the disease has started, brain tissue integrity may degenerate. The 
physiological characteristics of the highly selective blood-brain barrier and 
the electrostatic charge of the nanoporous extracellular matrix have long placed 
restrictions on the treatment of brain disorders. A prospective revolution in 
drug delivery for the treatment of AD is the use of nanomedicine. It depends on 
enhancing the way that medications are distributed pharmacokinetically 
throughout the central nervous system. Several types of nanoparticles (Nps) are 
available thanks to nanotechnology, and these Nps could target the brain and 
have a long half-life with few systemic side effects and motor problems. With 
the latest technological developments, scientists are working to develop unique 
approaches for the treatment of AD. To evaluate the prospective uses of 
medicinal plants, their components, and different nanomedicine techniques, it 
was determined that this literature study was necessary. To provide an overview 
of the various challenges and approaches related to using nanoparticles (NPs) to 
combat Alzheimer's disease (AD), this introductory review article was developed.

Accurately distinguishing stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial for 
diagnosis and treatment. In this paper, we introduce a stacking classifier 
method that combines six single classifiers into a stacking classifier. Using 
brain network models and network metrics, we employ t-tests to identify abnormal 
brain regions, from which we construct a subnetwork and extract its features to 
form the training dataset. Our method is then applied to the ADNI (Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) datasets, categorizing the stages into four 
categories: Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), mixed 
Alzheimer's mild cognitive impairment (ADMCI), and healthy controls (HCs). We 
investigate four classification groups: AD-HCs, AD-MCI, HCs-ADMCI, and HCs-MCI. 
Finally, we compare the classification accuracy between a single classifier and 
our stacking classifier, demonstrating superior accuracy with our stacking 
classifier from a subnetwork-based viewpoint.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder with no 
effective disease-modifying treatments. The blood-brain barrier hinders drug 
delivery to the brain, limiting therapeutic efficacy. Nanoparticle-based systems 
have emerged as promising tools to overcome these challenges. This review 
highlights recent advances in nanoparticle technologies for AD treatment, 
including liposomes, polymeric, inorganic, and biomimetic nanoparticles. These 
nanoparticles improve drug delivery across the blood-brain barrier, improve 
stability and bioavailability, and enable targeted delivery to affected brain 
regions. Functionalization strategies further enhance their therapeutic 
potential. Multifunctional nanoparticles combining therapeutic and diagnostic 
properties offer theranostic approaches. While progress has been made, 
challenges related to safety, targeting precision, and clinical translation 
remain. Future perspectives emphasize the need for collaborative efforts to 
optimize nanoparticle design, conduct rigorous studies, and accelerate the 
development of effective nanotherapeutics. With continued innovation, 
nanoparticle-based delivery systems hold great promise for revolutionizing AD 
treatment.

Multi-target drug design (MTDD) represents the paradigm shift in pharmaceutical 
research, moving beyond the conventional one-drug-one-target approach to address 
the complexity of multifactorial diseases. This strategy aims to develop single 
therapeutic candidates that can simultaneously modulate multiple biological 
targets, offering more comprehensive disease management and reducing the 
likelihood of drug resistance. In this article, we highlighted the design, 
synthesis, and structure-activity relationships (SARs) of various dual acting 
inhibitors involved in treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Dual acting 
inhibitors targeting carbonic anhydrases (CAs), monoamine oxidases (MAOs), and 
cholinesterases (ChEs) have emerged as promising therapeutic agents due to their 
potential in treating complex neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders such 
as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). By integrating CA 
inhibitors with MAO and ChE inhibition, researchers aim to address both the 
neuroprotective and symptomatic aspects of these disorders. The review also 
discusses key SAR studies that have guided the optimization of dual inhibitors, 
focusing on achieving selectivity and potency while minimizing off-target 
effects. From a medicinal chemistry perspective, the dual inhibition approach 
offers advantages such as improved efficacy, reduced polypharmacy, and better 
management of disease progression. However, challenges remain, including 
maintaining selectivity for target isoforms and overcoming pharmacokinetic 
limitations. Overall, the development of dual-acting CA-MAO-ChE inhibitors 
represents a compelling avenue in drug discovery, with the potential to 
significantly impact the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

Imputation-Based Variable Selection Method for Block-Wise Missing Data When 
Integrating Multiple Longitudinal Studies.

Author information:
(1)Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, 
USA.

When integrating data from multiple sources, a common challenge is block-wise 
missing. Most existing methods address this issue only in cross-sectional 
studies. In this paper, we propose a method for variable selection when 
combining datasets from multiple sources in longitudinal studies. To account for 
block-wise missing in covariates, we impute the missing values multiple times 
based on combinations of samples from different missing pattern and predictors 
from different data sources. We then use these imputed data to construct 
estimating equations, and aggregate the information across subjects and sources 
with the generalized method of moments. We employ the smoothly clipped absolute 
deviation penalty in variable selection and use the extended Bayesian 
Information Criterion criteria for tuning parameter selection. We establish the 
asymptotic properties of the proposed estimator, and demonstrate the superior 
performance of the proposed method through numerical experiments. Furthermore, 
we apply the proposed method in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
study to identify sensitive early-stage biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease, which 
is crucial for early disease detection and personalized treatment.

BackgroundNon-Hispanic Black and African American men are more likely to have 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) than non-Hispanic White peers. Despite this, little is 
known about how Black and African American men perceive dementia risk, which is 
foundational to prevention.ObjectiveAcknowledging that personal vantage point 
influences behavior, our study examined Black and African American male 
perceptions about their anticipated risk for AD.MethodsWe conducted a secondary 
analysis of Black and African American adult male responses to the Recruitment 
Innovations for Diversity Enhancement electronic survey study. We examined 
associations between perceived risk of AD and age, education, employment status, 
household income adequacy, marital status, living status, prior experience with 
AD, and subjective memory performance using generalized linear 
models.ResultsRespondents (n = 112) were age 18 to 79 years (M = 51.05, 
SD = 13.44), and 35% reported prior experience with AD through a friend or 
family member. Respondents' perceived risk of developing AD ranged from 0 to 
100% (M = 33.46, SD = 28.29). Spearman rho correlations revealed modest but 
significant correlations between perceived risk and age (r = 21, p = 0.03) and 
marital status (r = -0.22 p = 0.02). The best fitting generalized linear model 
revealed low perceived risk for AD was associated with younger age, income 
adequacy and being married or living as married (χ2 = 8.76, 
p = 0.03).ConclusionSelected social determinants of health were associated with 
perceived risk. Future studies should examine additional social determinants of 
health (e.g., social and physical environment) and measures of cognitive and 
physical health to further explore relationships with perceived risk of AD in 
Black and African American males.

BackgroundThe clinical significance of enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS) in 
Alzheimer' s disease (AD) was ambiguous.ObjectiveTo investigate whether EPVS 
contribute to blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakage and cognition in AD.MethodsThe 
study included a total of 64 participants (26 healthy controls and 38 patients 
with AD). The evaluation of EPVS and BBB permeability was performed in specific 
anatomical locations: the centrum semiovale (CSO), basal ganglia, and 
hippocampus. The EPVS ratings were performed according to Potter's instructions. 
BBB permeability was evaluated using dynamic contrast-enhanced-MRI. The 
relationship between EPVS and global cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination 
and Montreal Cognitive Assessment), cognitive subdomains, and BBB permeability 
were examined in both groups. Finally, the relationship between CSO BBB 
permeability and cognition in AD patients was investigated.ResultsHigh-grade CSO 
EPVS was found associated with AD (OR: 3.40, 95% CI: 1.11-11.90, p = 0.04). In 
the AD group, a significant correlation was observed between high-grade CSO EPVS 
and lower MMSE score (r = -0.36, p = 0.03) and verbal fluency (r = -0.44, 
p = 0.01). High-grade CSO EPVS positively correlated with BBB leakage (r = 0.58, 
p < 0.001). The BBB permeability of CSO negatively correlated with verbal 
fluency (r = -0.52, p < 0.001) and attention (r = -0.40, 
p = 0.01).ConclusionsHigh-grade CSO EPVS is related to BBB leakage, which 
contributes to cognitive impairment in AD patients, especially verbal frequency. 
CSO EPVS can function as a convenient AD marker for intervention and therapy.

Acupuncture has emerged as a promising adjunctive symptomatic therapy for 
Alzheimer's disease, demonstrating potential benefits in cognitive function and 
neuroprotection. Recent meta-analyses and randomized clinical trials have 
investigated the potential of acupuncture to improve cognitive assessments, 
signaling pathways, and gut regulation in Alzheimer's disease, underscoring its 
potential clinical application. However, the limited number of studies, small 
sample sizes, and lack of detailed mapping of acupuncture's core targets must be 
considered when interpreting these positive results.

Despite growing awareness that disclosing biomarker results to research 
participants is aligned with ethical principles of researcher-participant 
partnership, there are currently no widely adopted guidelines for this 
disclosure in Alzheimer's disease research. We developed a process and tools to 
deliver biomarker and genetic results to 65 participants of The Memory and Aging 
Study of the Duke-UNC Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC). Survey 
responses of 46 participants were analyzed. We show high participant 
satisfaction and lower anxiety levels after receiving the results. The developed 
process and materials provide a template for standardized Alzheimer's disease 
biomarker result delivery in the research setting.

BackgroundHearing loss (HL) of moderate or higher grades is common in older 
adults with increasing prevalence as people age, rising from 12% at the age of 
60 years to over 58% at 90 years. HL in midlife is one of the main potentially 
modifiable risk factors for dementia. It is estimated that 7% of dementia cases 
globally could be avoided if this risk factor was eliminated. However, much of 
the research conducted has been in high-income countries even though low- and 
middle-income countries have the highest prevalence of dementia.ObjectiveTo 
study the association between HL and cognitive decline during eight years of 
follow-up in a Brazilian sample.MethodsParticipants from the São Paulo center of 
the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health were evaluated in three study 
waves (2008-10, 2012-14, and 2017-19). HL was defined as pure-tone audiometry 
above 25 dB in the better ear. Cognitive performance was evaluated with six 
tests related to memory, verbal fluency, and trail-making tests. A global 
cognitive z-score was derived from these tests. The association between HL and 
cognitive decline was evaluated with linear mixed-effects models adjusted for 
sociodemographic, lifestyle, and clinical factors.ResultsOf 805 participants 
(mean age 51 ± 9 years, 52% women, 60% White), 62 had HL. During follow-up, HL 
was associated with faster global cognitive decline (β = -0.012, 95% 
CI = -0.023; 0.000, p = 0.039).ConclusionsHL was significantly associated with a 
faster rate of global cognitive decline after a median follow-up of eight years 
in a sample of middle-income country.

BackgroundDementia impacts individuals, families, and society, necessitating 
effective prevention strategies.ObjectiveTo evaluate the feasibility of a 
community-adapted multi-domain intervention for dementia prevention among older 
adults in Obu City, Japan and how uncertainties in implementing definitive 
trials can be reduced.MethodsA 12-month one-arm intervention trial was conducted 
with 80 community-dwelling older adults aged 65-86 years from two district 
regions. The multi-domain intervention included physical exercise, nutrition 
guidance, cognitive training, social participation, and vascular risk 
management. The primary outcome was the continuation rate, defined as the 
proportion of participants attending >60% of classes from the initial assessment 
to 6 months. Secondary outcomes, such as fidelity, acceptability, and 
appropriateness, were assessed through qualitative and quantitative evaluations. 
Additionally, health outcomes, including cognitive function and overall 
lifestyle, were evaluated.ResultsThe study achieved continuation rates of 75% 
and 76% at 6 and 12 months, respectively, indicating high feasibility. 
Participants showed high program acceptability (average acceptance score, 4.4 of 
5). Fidelity was high regarding content coverage and duration, although the 
frequency and coverage varied between study sites. Cognitive function remained 
stable; food-diversity status improved significantly over the study period, 
though the absence of a control group limits causal interpretation of these 
changes.ConclusionsThe community-adapted multi-domain intervention for dementia 
prevention demonstrated high feasibility and acceptability among older adults. 
Our findings can help reduce uncertainties and support planning future 
definitive trials to evaluate the effectiveness of community-based 
dementia-prevention programs.

BackgroundThe aim of the study was to analyze the impact of adherence to the 
intervention components on the effectiveness of AgeWell.de, a multi-domain 
lifestyle intervention against cognitive decline, on function in everyday 
activities, quality of life, depressiveness and social 
isolation.ObjectiveStudying the effect of adherence on health-related 
outcomes.MethodsParticipants were aged 60-77 years at baseline and at risk 
(Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Ageing and Dementia Score (CAIDE) ≥9). Adherence 
to the components nutrition, enhancement of physical and social activities and 
cognitive training was analyzed in two ways, first continual within the 
intervention group (n = 378, mean age = 69.1 years, 52.7% female) and second as 
dichotomous split (75% adherence) and in reference to the control group 
(received infomaterial and regular health advice; n = 441, mean age = 69 years, 
53% female). Generalized linear regression models were then run on the health 
outcomes functioning in everyday activities, quality of life, depressive 
symptoms, and social inclusion.ResultsHealth-related quality of life and 
depressiveness were improved in participants with better adherence to 
nutritional counselling and enhancement of physical and social activities. 
Better adherence to social activities was relevant for function in everyday 
activities. Effects of high adherence to cognitive training was found for 
improvements in depressiveness when comparing it to the control group. No effect 
was found on social inclusion when considering the particular 
components.ConclusionsThe extent of adherence to most components influenced 
health-related outcomes such as health-related quality of life and 
depressiveness. With this study, the effectiveness of AgeWell.de can be 
understood in greater depth.Trial RegistrationGerman Clinical Trial Register

BackgroundNearly two-thirds of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients are women. 
Therapeutics for women are critical to lowering their elevated risk of 
developing this major cause of adult dementia. Moreover, targeting epigenetic 
processes such as histone acetylation that regulate multiple cellular pathways 
is advantageous given the multifactorial nature of AD. Histone acetylation takes 
part in memory consolidation, and its disruption is linked to 
AD.ObjectiveDetermine whether the investigational drug RG2833 has repurposing 
potential for AD. RG2833 is a histone deacetylase HDAC1/3 inhibitor that is 
orally bioavailable and permeates the blood-brain-barrier.MethodsRG2833 effects 
were determined on cognition, transcriptome, and AD-like pathology in 11-month 
TgF344-AD female and male rats. Treatment started early in the course of 
pathology when therapeutic intervention is predicted to be most 
effective.ResultsRG2833-treatment of 11-month TgF344-AD rats: (1) Significantly 
improved hippocampal-dependent spatial memory in females but not males. (2) 
Upregulated expression of immediate early genes, such as Arc, Egr1 and c-Fos, 
and other genes involved in synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation in 
females. Remarkably, out of 17,168 genes analyzed for each sex, no significant 
changes in gene expression were detected in males at p < 0.05, false discovery 
rate <0.05, and fold-change equal or > 1.5. (3) Failed to improve amyloid beta 
accumulation and microgliosis in female and male TgF344-AD rats.ConclusionsOur 
study highlights the potential of histone-modifying therapeutics such as RG2833 
to improve cognitive behavior and drive the expression of immediate early, 
synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation genes, especially in female AD 
patients.

BackgroundDementia is studied rigorously in the current times, to assess the 
potential factors that contribute towards its progression, such as demographic 
factors, geographical background as well as to understand its impact on 
essential life skills. Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia, is 
a major focus due to its prevalence and lack of curative treatments.ObjectiveWe 
aim to study dementia progression across two geographically distinct 
populations, by analyzing Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scores and its 
domain-specific components, which reflect the decline in essential life skills. 
This analysis may support clinicians in designing targeted 
interventions.MethodsThis study investigates the statistical dependencies 
between the CDR and its six defining domain scores across two distinct aging 
datasets: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the 
Longitudinal Aging Study of India (LASI). We analyzed the dependencies among 
domain scores and their influence on the global CDR in both datasets using 
data-driven directed acyclic graphs, within Bayesian network 
models.ResultsDistinct notable similarities and differences in the associations 
and the edge strengths between the Western and Indian populations were 
identified. Memory showed similar prominence in contributing towards global CDR, 
while the incoming edges on memory domain reduced in LASI over ADNI, 
specifically from the domains, Home and hobbies, and Community 
affairs.ConclusionsThe analysis highlights a stronger dependency of CDR scores 
on memory functions in both datasets. The results overall elucidate 
population-specific differences and similarities in dementia progression across 
diverse demographic contexts.

BackgroundGiven the limited effective treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
obesity and serum uric acid (SUA) levels which are considered modifiable risk 
factors for dementia are of interest. However, research indicates conflicting 
results.ObjectiveWe aimed to further investigate the association of body weight 
(BW) and SUA with AD biomarkers and cognitive impairment.MethodsClinical data 
were collected from 139 adults (mean age 66.9 years) with chronic cognitive 
impairment. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and PET imaging were used to 
assess amyloid-β (A) and Tau (T) tangles load, classifying participants into AT 
profiles based on the results. The association of BW and SUA with AT profiles 
was evaluated using multivariable logistic regression, and their relationship 
with cognitive function (Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores) were 
analyzed using multivariable linear regression.ResultsLower BW levels 
significantly influenced the presence of Aβ positive state (A+) (p = 0.007), 
while SUA levels did not (p = 0.263). Higher dementia proportion (p = 0.021), 
lighter BW (p = 0.019), and lower mean arterial pressure (MAP) levels 
(p = 0.025) were associated with AD pathological progress (A-T-→A+T-→A+T+), but 
SUA was not observed statistically significant. Among all participants 
regardless of Aβ state, high education levels (p < 0.001), high BW (p = 0.010), 
and high SUA (p=0.036) were associated with high MMSE scores, and high serum 
creatinine (p = 0.003) was associated with low MMSE scores.ConclusionsLower BW 
may accelerate AD pathology and cause cognitive impairment, while SUA is not 
linked to AD pathological progression but protects cognitive function.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and white-matter structural connectivity 
have been linked in some observational studies, although it is unknown if this 
is a causal relationship. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of 
various white-matter structural connectivity on AD via a two-sample multivariate 
Mendelian randomization (MR) approach.
METHODS: The genome-wide association study (GWAS) of Wainberg et al. provided 
the summary data on white-matter structural connectivity, and Bellenguez 
et al.'s study provided the GWAS aggregated data for AD. MR methods included 
inverse variance weighted, Mendelian randomization Egger, simple mode, weighted 
median, and weighted mode. Heterogeneity, horizontal pleiotropy, and 
"leave-one-out" analysis guaranteed the robustness of causation. Finally, 
reverse MR analysis was conducted on the white-matter structural connectivity 
that showed positive results in the forward MR analysis.
RESULTS: Among 206 white-matter structural connections, we identified 10 
connections were strongly correlated with genetic susceptibility to AD. 
Right-hemisphere limbic network to thalamus white-matter structural connectivity 
and Right-hemisphere salience_ventral attention network to accumbens 
white-matter structural connectivity were positively correlated with the 
likelihood of AD, while the remaining 8 white-matter structural connections were 
negatively related with AD. None of the above 10 white-matter structural 
connections have a reverse causal relationship with AD.
CONCLUSION: Our MR study reveals a certain degree of association between 
white-matter structural connectivity and AD, which may provide support for 
future diagnosis and treatment of AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) symptomatology, while classically studied through the 
lens of amyloid-β and tau burden, is likely also influenced by 
multiple-interacting co-pathologies like vascular disease and dysmetabolism. 
These co-pathologies, especially vascular disease, occur disparately in the 
Chinese-American population and are often treatable via therapeutics and 
lifestyle modifications. Given this, we explored whether plasma biomarkers, 
including an array of vascular-related proteins, associate with cognition in a 
cohort of 34 Chinese Americans clinically diagnosed as cognitively normal, with 
mild cognitive impairment, or with AD. We found that a composite score of plasma 
angiogenesis biomarkers (MMP-1, bFGF, VEGF, and VEGF-C) were positively 
associated with total Mini Mental State Examination scores (p = 0.045) as well 
as memory performance (p = 0.006), and that this relationship was most 
pronounced in AD (biomarker composite score within AD vs MMSE & memory, both 
p < 0.001). To explore whether these findings were specific to the 
Chinese-American population, we repeated the above analyses in 73 
demographically matched non-Hispanic White American participants and found no 
significant associations between angiogenesis biomarkers and MMSE or memory, 
highlighting the potential relevance of vascular dysregulation in Chinese 
Americans at risk for AD.

Glucose enrichment reduces lifespan and promotes tau phosphorylation in human 
tau-expressing C. elegans, unaffected by O-β-GlcNAcylation induction.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with the formation of 
tau-hyperphosphorylated neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Impaired glucose 
metabolism has been proposed as a major risk factor in AD severity, with many 
enzymes and pathways associated with glucose metabolism found to be compromised. 
The use of additional glucose has been suggested to reduce AD severity. However, 
the exact role of glucose metabolism in disease progression is still under 
investigation. In this study, we found that adding glucose to tau-expressing 
worms not only shortens their lifespan but also induces tau phosphorylation on 
critical serine and threonine residues. Increased phosphorylation of tau is 
associated with the formation of NFTs and increased disease severity. 
O-β-GlcNAcylation may inhibit phosphorylation. We hypothesized that high glucose 
levels might induce tau O-β-GlcNAcylation, thereby protecting against tau 
phosphorylation. Contrary to our expectations, glucose increased tau 
phosphorylation but not O-β-GlcNAcylation. Increasing O-β-GlcNAcylation, either 
with Thiamet-G (TMG) or by suppressing the O-GlcNAcase (oga-1) gene, interferes 
with and reduces tau phosphorylation. Conversely, reducing O-β-GlcNAcylation by 
suppressing the O-GlcNAc transferase (ogt-1) gene increases tau phosphorylation. 
Our results suggest that glucose addition may induce selective O-β-GlcNAcylation 
on some proteins but not on tau. High levels of glucose exacerbate disease 
progression by promoting tau hyperphosphorylation. The effects of glucose cannot 
be effectively managed by manipulating O-β-GlcNAcylation in tau models of AD in 
C. elegans. Our observations indicate that glucose enrichment is unlikely to be 
an appropriate therapy to minimize AD progression. KEY MESSAGES: Formation of 
tau hyperphosphorylated neurofibrillary tangles are hallmarks of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) in aged patients. Glucose metabolism may affect the AD

was not able to induce overall O-β-GlcNAcylation. Collectively, higher glucose 
levels in diet were associated with induced disease severity.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that leads 
to death of dopaminergic neurons and deficiency of dopamine. It is the second 
most common neurodegenerative disorder worldwide after Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
It is mostly prevalent in elderly people above age 60. Clinical manifestations 
of PD include motor symptoms like tremor, akinesia, rigidity and gait imbalance; 
whereas non-motor symptoms include impaired olfaction and GI dysfunction. 
Α-synuclein is the major pathological hallmark of PD pathology. It aggregates 
and leads to formation of fibrils and Lewy bodies. It is a pre-synaptic protein 
that normally governs synaptic vesicle recycling. However, its aberration leads 
to its aggregation. There are several other synaptic proteins besides 
α-synuclein, and they might also have a pathological role. These synaptic 
proteins include synucleins (beta-synuclein, gamma-synuclein), synaptophysin, 
synaptobrevin, synaptogyrin, synaptotagmin and synaptojanin. In this review, we 
aim to explore underlying pathological role of these proteins. Clearer insights 
into the role of these synaptic proteins might aid in identifying newer targets 
which subsequently leads to development of novel therapeutics that target 
progression of the disease.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) belongs to the category 
of "forgetfulness" or "dementia" in traditional Chinese medicine, and is often 
caused by deficiency of five zang-viscera. Longan Aril (the aril of Dimocarpus 
longan Lour., LA) possesses properties beneficial for heart and spleen health, 
blood nourishment, and mind tranquility, suggesting its potential as a treatment 
for AD. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects of Longan Aril 
polysaccharides (LAPs), a primary active constituent of LA, on 
lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) induced immune tolerance in 
AD mice. Further, BV2 cells were employed to explore the mechanism of LAPs in 
improving immune tolerance.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: LAPs were prepared by water extraction and alcohol 
precipitation. The monosaccharide composition was determined by high-performance 
liquid chromatography (HPLC). An AD mouse model of immune tolerance was 
established by intraperitoneal (i.p) injection of LPS combined with 
intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of Aβ25-35. The LAPs group mice received 
LAPs (1.4 g/kg) daily for 40 days. The anti-AD efficacy and mechanism of LAPs in 
vivo was evaluated by the Y maze, Morris water maze, Degenerating Neurons Stain 
(FJC staining), hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining, Nissl staining, measurements 
of lactate, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) secretion 
levels, immunofluorescence and western blot. Furthermore, the mechanism of LAPs 
in improving the function of immune-tolerant BV2 cells was explored in vitro 
using lactic acid kits, ELISA kits, and western blot. The phagocytic function of 
BV2 cells was evaluated by the fluorescent dye Alexa Fluor 488 labeled Aβ 
(AF448-Aβ).
RESULTS: LAPs contained five monosaccharides. LAPs improved cognitive function 
and increased the number of Nissl bodies, lactate secretion, the IL-10 content, 
the relative fluorescence intensity of the IBA1 and AXL proteins, and the 
protein expression levels of AXL, Mertk, Glut1, HK2, PI3K, p-Akt/Akt, 
p-mTOR/mTOR and HIF-1α of immune-tolerant AD mice. LAPs also reduced the TNF-α 
content, and the protein expression level of CD68 in immune-tolerant AD mice. In 
vitro, LAPs elevated the IL-10 content and protein expression levels of PI3K, 
Akt, p-Akt, and HIF-1α, while reducing lactate secretion and the TNF-α content 
in immune-tolerant BV2 cells. LAPs promoted the phagocytic activity of BV2 
cells, and their effects are completely inhibited by 2-DG and partially 
inhibited by BAY and Rapa.
CONCLUSIONS: LAPs can enhance the cognitive abilities of immune-tolerant AD mice 
and diminish their pathological damage. The mechanism involves the regulation of 
glycolysis and the PI3K/Akt/mTOR/HIF-1α signaling pathway to promote microglial 
immune phagocytosis.

With the recent successful disease-modifying therapies against Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), there have been discussions on easily interpretable measures for 
treatment effects. Among them, saved time for patients treated with a new drug 
as compared to patients randomized to the placebo group offers easier 
interpretation than the reduced percentage in outcome decline at last visit 
which were commonly used in AD trials. The existing method to calculate saved 
time utilized the disease progression trajectory of the placebo group and the 
treatment effect at the last visit. We propose to develop two new methods that 
use disease progression trajectories of both groups: (1) slope adjusted method; 
and (2) area under the curve method. We used data from the two donanemab trials 
and the donepezil trial to illustrate the application of the proposed methods 
and conducted simulation studies to compare these methods. When a drug has a 
constant treatment effect over time or early and middle difference in the 
disease progression, the area under the curve method often has the saved time 
being longer than the existing method. When the treatment effect is an 
increasing function of time before the last visit as observed in 
disease-modifying therapy trials, the slope adjusted method could have a larger 
saved time as compared to the existing method. In many cases, the area under the 
curve method often has the smallest standard deviation of saved time.

Vascular dementia (VD) is the second leading cause of cognitive impairment after 
Alzheimer's disease, posing a heavy burden to families and society. The majority 
of causes of VD are vascular diseases such as stroke, with ischemic stroke 
accounting for a large proportion. After ischemia-reperfusion, factors such as 
mitochondrial damage and increased xanthine oxidase lead to excessive production 
of reactive oxygen species (ROS) at the ischemic site, further exacerbating 
brain injury. Therefore, developing effective ROS scavengers is crucial. 
Polydopamine has become one of the widely used surface functionalized materials 
in recent years, due to its excellent biocompatibility and antioxidant 
properties. This paper proposed a macrophage membrane disguised polydopamine 
(PDA) nanoplatform for loading the neuroprotective drug puerarin (PUE). The as 
made PUE@PDA@CMs (PPCs) nanoplatforms can significantly and effectively clear 
ROS, alleviate oxidative microenvironment, and protect neurons from oxidative 
stress damage. The macrophage membranes modification enables PPCs to respond to 
lymphocyte recruitment at the site of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury, 
thereby targeting and aggregating to the injury site. In a mouse model of 
vascular dementia, PPCs treatment significantly reduced neuronal apoptosis and 
provided significant cognitive and memory function recovery, providing new 
strategies and prospects for the treatment of central nervous system diseases.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by memory impairment and cognitive decline. Our previous research 
has demonstrated that pathological Tau and Amyloid-beta (Aβ) disrupt autophagy 
gene expression, independently. Other studies have shown that these pathological 
aggregates create a vicious cycle with oxidative stress.
METHODS: In the current research, the effect of Tau and Amyloid-beta was 
compared on behavioral function, autophagy gene dysfunction, and oxidative 
stress in the Drosophila model for AD. Thymoquinone (TQ), an antioxidant agent, 
was then tested to examine if it could ameliorate the adverse effects of Tau and 
Amyloid-beta. In addition, the impact of TQ on Tau aggregation was investigated 
in vitro.
RESULTS: Our data showed that Tau and Amyloid-beta induced behavioral 
disability, autophagy gene dysregulation, and oxidative stress. TQ treatment 
significantly improved conditions in both types of transgenic flies, with a more 
profound alleviation in Tau transgenic flies, despite tau having a greater 
impact on autophagy gene dysregulation. Furthermore, TQ prevented the 
aggregation of Tau in vitro.
CONCLUSION: To sum up, Tau may exert its toxic effect on autophagy and 
behavioral dysfunctions significantly through oxidative stress while 
Amyloid-beta may confer its toxicity through multiple pathways, including 
oxidative stress. Moreover, since TQ ameliorates the adverse effect of tau and 
amyloid beta, it could be considered a promising approach for treating AD, 
probably in combination with other medications against Aβ or Tau.

To explore the neuroprotective effects of Sinapic Acid (SA) in APP/PS1 mouse 
model and amyloid beta-peptide (Aβ)-induced neuronal cell apoptosis using PC12 
cells of Alzheimer's disease. In vivo, the Morris water maze (MWM) test assessed 
learning and memory abilities, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test and 
immunohistochemistry were conducted to plaque deposition and content of Aβ. 
Western blotting was performed to p-P13K, P13K, p-Akt, Akt, p-GSK3β and GSK3β 
expression of the hippocampus in mice, respectively. In vitro, the viability of 
the cells, the apoptosis of the cells and the level of Bax, Bcl-2, caspase-3, 
p-P13K, P13K, p-Akt, Akt, p-GSK3β and GSK3β expression of PC12 cells were 
examined by CCK-8 assay, Hoechst 33342 and Calcein/propidium iodide (PI) 
staining, flow cytometry and Western blotting, respectively. Our results 
indicated SA could improve learning and memory abilities and decrease plaque 
deposition and content of Aβ of the hippocampus in mice. Furthermore, SA 
increased cell viability and lessened cell apoptosis by increasing the ratio of 
Bcl-2/Bax, lessening protein levels of Caspase-3 in PC12 cells. SA upregulated 
the phosphorylation expression level of PI3K/Akt/GSK3β in APP/PS1 mice and PC12 
cells. Our research showed that SA's neuroprotective effect reduced Aβ 
deposition and cell apoptosis by activating the PI3K/Akt/GSK3β pathway.

BACKGROUND: Posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) is a neurodegenerative syndrome 
characterized by progressive damage to the brain's visual and association areas, 
resulting in impaired spatial awareness, visual processing, and functional 
independence.
PURPOSE: This report examines the effects of a 14-week treatment protocol 
consisting of translingual neuromodulation via a portable neuromodulation 
stimulator (PoNS®1) in conjunction with physical therapy on balance, gait, and 
functional mobility in an adult male with PCA.
CASE DESCRIPTION: Assessments included objective and subjective measures of 
balance and gait - the 10-Metre Walk Test, Functional Gait Assessment (FGA), 
Dynamic Gait Index (DGI), Community Balance and Mobility Scale (CB&M), 
Neuro-Quality of Life (Neuro-QoL), and Activities-specific Balance Confidence 
(ABC) Scale. These were performed at baseline and weeks 4, 8, and 14 to evaluate 
the protocol's efficacy in improving balance, stability, and gait.
OUTCOMES: Postural stability, balance, gait patterning, and gait speed improved, 
enhancing daily functioning abilities and self-confidence. Gait speed improved 
by 0.48 m/s (comfortable) and 0.46 m/s (fast), exceeding MDC thresholds. The 
participant's FGA score increased 21 points and DGI increased 17 points, both 
exceeding their respective MDC thresholds (6 points for FGA, 3.2 points for 
DGI), reflecting marked gait improvements. The CB&M score rose 24 points, 
exceeding the MDC of 9.6 points. Despite these gains, gait speed remained below 
age-related norms.
CONCLUSION: Given the largely positive response to the protocol, further 
investigation should be undertaken to continue to explore the efficacy of PoNS® 
and physical therapy to determine its viability as a treatment for symptoms of 
PCA.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by cognitive decline and memory loss, associated with oxidative 
stress, neuronal apoptosis, and the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques. 
Despite advances in understanding AD pathology, effective treatments remain 
limited. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic efficacy and underlying 
molecular mechanisms of MK886, a selective inhibitor of the 5-lipoxygenase 
pathway, in the context of AD. Network pharmacology analyses were employed to 
evaluate MK886's potential as a treatment for AD, revealing promising 
interactions with key molecular targets implicated in the disease. In vitro 
experiments demonstrated that MK886 effectively mitigated Aβ1-42 
oligomer-induced oxidative stress, apoptosis, and ferroptosis in mouse 
hippocampal neuronal cells (HT22). These effects were validated using techniques 
such as immunofluorescence, JC-1 staining, TUNEL staining, and flow cytometry. 
In vivo studies involved administering MK886 to APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice, 
which resulted in significant improvements in cognitive and emotional functions 
as assessed by the Y-maze and Morris water maze tests. Histological evaluations, 
including Nissl staining, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry, revealed 
that MK886 preserved hippocampal neuron integrity and reduced Aβ deposition. 
Proteomics and molecular docking analyses identified the PRKCI/AKT signaling 
pathway as a key mediator of MK886's neuroprotective effects. This finding was 
further validated through Western blotting experiments incorporating an AKT 
inhibitor. Overall, these findings suggest that MK886 holds promise as a 
potential therapeutic agent for Alzheimer's disease by enhancing neuronal 
protection and cognitive function through the activation of the PRKCI/AKT 
pathway.

Emerging evidences suggest that autophagy, a key cellular process responsible 
for degrading and recycling damaged organelles and proteins, plays a crucial 
role in maintaining neuronal health. Dysfunctional autophagy has been linked to 
the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), contributing to the accumulation 
of misfolded proteins and cellular debris. Molecular mechanisms underlying 
autophagy dysfunction in AD involve amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau accumulation, 
neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress and endoplasmic 
reticulum stress. Disrupted signaling pathways such as TRIB3, Nmnat and BAG3 
that regulate key processes like autophagosome initiation, lysosome function, 
and protein homeostasis also play a crucial role in the pathogenesis. 
Restoration of autophagy by modulating these molecular and signaling pathways 
may be an effective therapeutic strategy for AD. Studies have found few drugs 
targeting autophagy dysregulation in AD. These drugs include metformin that has 
been found to modulate the expression of TRIB3 for autophagy regulation. Another 
drug, resveratrol has been reported to augment the activity of Nmnat thus, 
increases autophagy flux. BACE1 and mTOR inhibitors like arctigenin, nilvadipine 
and dapagliflozin were also found to restore autophagy. This study elaborates 
recent advances in signaling and molecular pathways and discusses current and 
emerging therapeutic interventions targeting autophagy dysfunction in AD.

Olfactory dysfunction is regarded as an early marker for Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). Slowly progressing AD pathology is interpreted to impair cognition and 
olfactory sensation independently, while olfactory deficits emerge earlier. The 
present experiments tested the possibility that olfactory impairment may worsen 
cognition or AD pathology using 3xTg AD model mice with olfactory bulbectomy 
(OBX). In open-field tests, OBX was shown to increase anxiety-like behavior in 
both wild-type (WT) and AD model mice, and hyperactivity was induced in WT mice 
only. Spatial memory, assessed by the Morris water maze (MWM) test, was impaired 
in WT but not AD mice. Object memory, assessed by the novel object recognition 
test, was not changed by OBX either in WT or AD mice. Densitometry of Aβ plaques 
stained with 6E10 and anti-Aβ42 antibodies was carried out in sections 
containing the hippocampal formation obtained from AD mice aged 12 and 
18 months. The plaque area was larger in the OBX than in the sham group at 
12 months. At 18 months, there was also difference in the plaque area. Given 
that Aβ plaques emerge in 3xTg mice relatively later (>9 months of age) than in 
other models, OBX in 3xTg mice appears to exacerbate Aβ pathology at the early 
phase of Aβ emergence, implying a causative link of smell loss to AD 
pathogenesis. The accelerated Aβ plaque formation by OBX was accompanied by 
microglial activation. Early intervention to smell loss may be beneficial for AD 
control.

Flavonoids are a broad family of polyphenolic chemicals that are present in a 
wide variety of fruits, vegetables, and medicinal plants. Because of their 
neuroprotective qualities, flavonoids have attracted a lot of interest. The 
potential of flavonoids to control synaptic plasticity-a crucial process 
underlying memory, learning, and cognitive function-is becoming more and more 
clear. Dysregulation of synaptic plasticity is a feature of neurodegenerative 
diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (0.4 %), Parkinson's (1-2 %), 
Alzheimer's (5-7 %), and Huntington's ((0.2 %)). This review discusses the 
molecular mechanisms via which flavonoids influence synaptic plasticity as well 
as their therapeutic potential in neurodegenerative diseases. Flavonoids 
modulate key signaling pathways such as MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt/mTOR to support 
neuroprotection, synaptic plasticity, and neuronal health, while also 
influencing neurotrophic factors (BDNF, NGF) and their receptors (TrkB, TrkA). 
They regulate neurotransmitter receptors like GABA, AMPA, and NMDA to balance 
excitatory and inhibitory transmission, and exert antioxidant effects via the 
Nrf2-ARE pathway and anti-inflammatory actions by inhibiting NF-κB signaling, 
highlighting their potential for treating neurodegenerative diseases. These 
varied reactions support the preservation of synapse function and neuronal 
integrity in the face of neurodegenerative insults. Flavonoids can reduce the 
symptoms of neurodegeneration, prevent synaptic loss, and enhance cognitive 
function, according to experimental studies. However, there are still obstacles 
to using these findings in clinical settings, such as limited bioavailability 
and the need for consistent dose. The focus of future research should be on 
improving flavonoid delivery systems and combining them with conventional 
medications.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is predominantly characterized by cholinergic 
dysfunction, mitochondrial impairment, oxidative stress, and inflammation, 
primarily driven by amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides. This study investigates the 
protective effects of Lycium ruthenicum Murray-derived exosome-like 
nanoparticles (LELN) in AD models using transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans (C. 
elegans). Findings showed that C. elegans effectively internalized LELN, which 
remained stable in vivo. Compared with untreated controls, treatment with 
600 μg/mL LELN significantly extended the lifespan of CL4176 [myo-3p::Aβ1-42] 
and CL2006 [unc-54/Aβ1-42] worms by 34.78 % and 34.85 %, respectively, and 
delayed Aβ-induced paralysis by 52.42 % and 42.72 %, respectively. Furthermore, 
LELN increased the chemotaxis index of CL2355 [snb-1::Aβ1-42] worms from 11.11 % 
to 55.56 %. Mechanistically, LELN reduced the levels of Aβ oligomers and 
monomers via the DAF-16 pathway, consequently alleviating AD-like symptoms in 
transgenic C. elegans. The effects of LELN include inhibiting 
acetylcholinesterase activity to mitigate cholinergic dysfunction, restoring 
mitochondrial membrane potential and adenosine triphosphate production to 
ameliorate mitochondrial dysfunction, and reducing oxidative stress and 
inflammation. Collectively, these results highlight the protective role of LELN 
against Aβ-induced AD pathology and underscore their potential as a therapeutic 
candidate for AD treatment.

BACKGROUND: Elevated night resting heart rate (HR) has been associated with 
increased depression severity, yet the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. 
This study aimed to investigate the mediating role of sleep disturbance and the 
influence of anxiety on the relationship between night resting HR and depression 
severity.
METHODS: This is a secondary data analysis of data collected in the Remote 
Assessment of Disease and Relapse (RADAR) Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) 
longitudinal mobile health study, encompassing 461 participants (1774 
observations) across three national centers (Netherlands, Spain, and the UK). 
Depression severity, anxiety, and sleep disturbance were assessed every three 
months. Night resting HR parameters in the 2 weeks preceding assessments were 
measured using a wrist-worn Fitbit device. Linear mixed models and causal 
mediation analysis were employed to examine the impact of sleep disturbance and 
anxiety on night resting HR on depression severity. Covariates included age, 
sex, BMI, smoking, alcohol consumption, antidepressant use, and comorbidities 
with other medical conditions.
RESULTS: Higher night resting HR was linked to subsequent depressive severity, 
through the mediation of sleep disturbance. Anxiety contributed to an 
exacerbated level of sleep disturbance, subsequently intensifying depression 
severity. Anxiety exhibited no direct effect on night resting HR.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings underscore the mediating role of sleep disturbance in 
the effect of night resting HR on depression severity, and anxiety on depression 
severity. This insight has potential implications for early identification of 
indicators signalling worsening depression symptoms, enabling clinicians to 
initiate timely and responsive treatment measures.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of dementia, affecting more than 
24.3 million people worldwide in 2024. Sporadic AD (SAD) is more common and 
occurs in the geriatric population, while familial AD (FAD) is rare and appears 
before the age of 65 years. Due to progressive cholinergic neuronal loss and 
modulation in the PKC/MAPK pathway, β-secretase gets upregulated, leading to Aβ 
aggregation, which further activates tau kinases that form neurofibrillary 
tangles (NFT). Simultaneously, antioxidant enzymes are also upregulated, 
increasing oxidative stress (OS) and reactive species by impairing mitochondrial 
function, leading to DNA damage and cell death. This review discusses the 
classifications and components of several natural products (NPs) that target 
these signaling pathways for AD treatment. NPs, including alkaloids, 
polyphenols, flavonoids, polysaccharides, steroids, fatty acids, tannins, and 
polypeptides derived from plants, microbes, marine animals, venoms, insects, and 
mushrooms, are explored in detail. A synergistic combination of plant 
metabolites, together with prebiotics and probiotics has been shown to decrease 
Aβ aggregates by increasing the production of bioactive compounds. Toxins 
derived from venomous organisms have demonstrated effectiveness in modulating 
signaling pathways and reducing OS. Marine metabolites have also shown 
neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties. The cholera toxin B subunit 
and an Aβ15 fragment have been combined to create a possible oral AD vaccine, 
that showed enhancement of cognitive function in mice. Insect tea is also a 
reliable source of antioxidants. A functional edible mushroom snack bar showed 
an increment in cognitive markers. Future directions and therapeutic approaches 
for the treatment of AD can be improved by focusing more on NPs derived from 
these sources.

Amyloid-β (Aβ), the hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), is known to induce 
reactive oxygen species, peroxynitrite (ONOO-) which plays a crucial role in the 
pathogenesis and progression of this incurable disease. However, the development 
of tools that can directly detect the presence and monitor the level of 
Aβ-induced ONOO- remains a great challenge. We report herein the development of 
an Aβ and ONOO- synergistically activated NIR fluorescent probe for highly 
selective imaging of Aβ-induced ONOO- level in vivo. Importantly, this 
responsive probe exhibits not only synergistically strong enhancement of 
fluorescence at 655 nm upon reacting with ONOO- in the presence of Aβ but also 
high sensitivity down to 13 nM with minimal interference. The strong Aβ binding 
and low cytotoxicity enable the probe to successfully apply for detecting and 
visualizing endogenous ONOO- level induced by Aβ in AD cell model. Remarkably, 
this ONOO--responsive probe can be applied effectively to detect, monitor, and 
distinguish varying ONOO- levels induced by Aβ in different age groups of AD 
mice, in which cerebral ONOO- level rises with increasing age of AD mice along 
with Aβ plaque accumulation. Furthermore, the potent neuroprotection against 
Aβ-induced toxicity and anti-Aβ aggregation effect of the ONOO--reaction product 
of the probe offer an extra therapeutic advantage of this ONOO--responsive 
probe. In essence, this multifunctional theranostic probe can serve as a highly 
sensitive and specific imaging tool for visualizing and monitoring of ONOO- 
level in the presence of Aβ in vivo, thereby facilitating more accurate early 
diagnosis and therapy of AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is becoming a fast-growing public health problem which 
can result in psychological problems as well as loss of speech, language, 
short-term memory, and motor coordination. Many medications were developed and 
produced to treat AD, however due to the complexity of the pathology involved in 
the illness, many of these medications often failed in clinical or preclinical 
studies. The main issue with the current anti-AD medications is their low 
efficacy since they use a single target. Multi-target-directed ligands (MTDLs) 
based on "one molecule; multiple targets" have been introduced to address these 
two fundamental issues. MTDLs have demonstrated improved efficacy and safety 
since they regulate many biological targets simultaneously. Alpha-lipoic acid 
(LA), a natural molecule with distinct properties, is a viable scaffold for 
developing new MTDLs in treating many neurodegenerative diseases, particularly 
AD. It is a key mitochondrial enzymes' cofactor and an organic molecule with 
disulfide functionality. It also has potent antioxidant characteristics that 
enhance mitochondrial activity. Considering the neuroprotective and 
anti-inflammatory effects of LA, various hybrids of LA with tacrine, 
rivastigmine, coumarin and chromone, ibuprofen, melatonin, niacin have been 
synthesized and biologically evaluated as the MTDLs. In this article, we review 
the design of LA-based hybrids or conjugates, their biological activities, and 
structure-activity relationship studies, to develop new MTDLs in the field of AD 
pharmacotherapy.

The Bidirectional Relationship Between Epilepsy and Alzheimer's Disease.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Epilepsy has long been considered a late-stage consequence of 
Alzheimer's Disease (AD), but recent studies highlight its role early in the 
disease process, even preceding cognitive symptoms. Population studies reveal a 
two- to fourfold increased epilepsy risk in AD, particularly in early-onset 
cases, with seizures clustering around diagnosis. Furthermore, individuals with 
late-onset unexplained epilepsy have an elevated risk of developing mild 
cognitive impairment and dementia, underscoring a bidirectional relationship 
between AD and epilepsy.
RECENT FINDINGS: Experimental models support this connection, demonstrating 
amyloid and tau pathology-induced hyperexcitability at pre-symptomatic stages, 
implicating soluble Aβ oligomers and inhibitory interneuron dysfunction in 
excitatory/inhibitory imbalance. Subclinical or clinical epileptiform activity, 
detectable in 20-50% of AD patients, is associated with cognitive decline, 
possibly due to sleep-related memory consolidation disruption. Emerging 
biomarkers, such as TIRDA and high-frequency oscillations, show promise for 
early detection and intervention. Anti-seizure medications (ASMs), particularly 
low-dose levetiracetam, show potential not only for seizure control but also for 
mitigating amyloid deposition, tau hyperphosphorylation, and cognitive decline. 
However, treatment complexities remain due to variable ASM efficacy, age-related 
side effects, and limited clinical trials. The bidirectional nature of AD and 
epilepsy emphasizes the need for integrated diagnostics, including EEG and 
biomarker assessments, to guide early intervention and targeted therapies. 
Future research should focus on the mechanistic interplay between amyloid, tau, 
and hyperexcitability, alongside trials of ASM regimens, to refine therapeutic 
strategies and improve outcomes in this population.

disorder, mainly characterized by amyloid β (Aβ) accumulation in the brain. 
Numerous new agents are currently undergoing clinical trials as 
disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) targeting Aβ. ALZ-801 is a promising 
candidate DMT for AD, with a phase 3 trial of ALZ-801 ongoing specifically for 
apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 homozygous patients with early-stage AD. This study 
aimed to examine the effects of ALZ-801 on Aβ assembly and explore its 
toxicological profile. Thioflavin T (ThT) assays and two imaging 
modalities-transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-speed atomic force 
microscopy (HS-AFM)-were used to evaluate ALZ-801's effects on Aβ assembly. To 
assess the effect of ALZ-801 on Aβ42-induced cytotoxicity, 
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays and 
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays were performed. ThT assays revealed increased 
lag time and decreased fluorescence in the presence of ALZ-801, confirming 
inhibition of Aβ42 fibril formation, as confirmed by TEM. Real-time observation 
using HS-AFM revealed that ALZ-801 inhibited the formation of Aβ42 fibril from 
low-molecular-weight (LMW)-Aβ42 in the presence of Aβ42 seeds. HS-AFM also 
revealed that globular aggregates from LMW-Aβ42 were significantly larger with 
ALZ-801, with few fibrils noted. MTT and LDH assays indicated that ALZ-801 
prevented LMW-Aβ42-induced cytotoxicity but did not reduce cytotoxicity induced 
by high-molecular-weight-Aβ42. ALZ-801 can inhibit Aβ42 aggregation by 
preventing both nucleus formation and fibril elongation, while promoting large 
globular oligomer formation, and can significantly reduce LMW-Aβ42-induced 
cytotoxicity. These findings underscore the potential of ALZ-801 as an effective 
DMT for APOE ε4 homozygous patients with AD.

Alzheimer's disease, a type of dementia, poses serious challenges to patients, 
especially older people, and no definitive treatment is available for this 
disease, with drug treatments having many side effects. As essential oils of 
plants deserve particular attention in the treatment of diseases, this study 
aimed to review the potential therapeutic effects of essential oils on treatment 
of psychosomatic aspects of Alzheimer's disease. To collect information, we 
searched different databases, including MagIran, SID, IranDoc and IranMedex, 
Embase, Science Direct, PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus and Web of Science using 
the keywords of essential oil, Alzheimer, acetylcholinesterase, memory, 
forgetfulness, aromatherapy, medicinal plant, herbal drugs, and their Persian 
equivalents from January 2010 to June 2022; the search included both single and 
multiple keywords. We retrieved 233 articles, reviewed the titles, abstracts, 
and full texts of the articles, and then included 25 related articles in this 
review (11 in vitro studies and 14 in vivo studies). The study results of in 
vitro and in vivo studies showed the effectiveness of different essential oils 
such as salvia family, tangerine and lemon oils, Juniperus communis, Anthriscus 
nemorosa, olibanum, inhaled coriander, Schisandra chinensis, lavender, rose 
essential oil, Nepeta cataria, Cinnamomum zeylanicum and Lippia origanoides, on 
memory and learning, enzymes, oxidative stress and inflammation, behavioural and 
cognitive symptoms in Alzheimer's disease. These findings suggest that essential 
oils can serve as complementary therapies for neurodegenerative diseases like 
Alzheimer's and for addressing memory impairments, although further research, 
especially human clinical trials, is needed to validate these findings, 
determine optimal dosages, and explore the long-term safety of essential oils in 
clinical settings.

INTRODUCTION: Chronic systemic inflammation is highly prevalent and has 
deleterious effects on the brain, impacting both function and structure, and 
manifesting in elevations in psychological symptoms transdiagnostically. Asthma 
is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airway that affects more than 300 
million people worldwide and is known to be highly comorbid with psychological 
and cognitive dysfunction. Though a growing corpus of work has identified 
functional brain abnormalities associated with asthma, limited research has 
investigated structural differences which may partially underlie functional 
changes. Identifying and characterizing asthma-related structural brain changes 
will shed light on the neurobiology through which asthma impacts mental function 
and has the potential to inform prophylaxis and treatment.
METHODS: We examined differences in regional brain volume, cortical thickness, 
and surface area, in 128 individuals with asthma compared to 134 non-asthma 
healthy controls. Five regions of interest were examined a priori, based on 
their previous implication in inflammation-related functional consequences 
(dorsal and ventral striatum, pallidum, and insula), or previous evidence of 
asthma-related structural impact (hippocampus and thalamus). We supplemented our 
region of interest approach with a voxel-wise whole-brain analysis. 
Additionally, we examined the association of brain structure with depression 
symptoms, asthma severity, degree of inflammation, and plasma biomarkers of 
neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, and Alzheimer's disease specific 
pathology.
RESULTS: Compared to non-asthma control participants, those with asthma had 
smaller nucleus accumbens volumes, thicker orbitofrontal cortices, larger middle 
frontal cortex surface areas, and greater diencephalon volumes. Those with more 
severe asthma had smaller nucleus accumbens and dorsal striatal volumes, reduced 
anterior cingulate cortex surface area, and greater amygdala volume compared to 
those with mild asthma. In untreated asthma patients, greater depressive 
symptoms were associated with smaller striatal volume, suggesting a potential 
CNS-protective effect of medications that reduce airway inflammation in asthma. 
In addition, a plasma marker of astrogliosis was associated with larger 
diencephalon, cerebellum, brainstem, and thalamus volumes, but reduced insula 
thickness and surface area.
CONCLUSIONS: Patterns of structural brain changes in participants with asthma 
encompass key regions of reward and salience networks, which may in part give 
rise to the functional alterations in these networks characteristic of chronic 
systemic inflammation.

Sleep plays a role in the elimination of neurotoxic metabolites that are 
accumulated in the waking brain as a result of neuronal activity. Long-term 
insomnia and sleep deprivation are associated with oxidative stress, 
neuroinflammation, amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition, and Lewy body formation, which 
are known to increase the risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. 
Orexin A (OXA) and orexin B (OXB), two neuropeptides produced in the lateral 
hypothalamus, are known to influence the sleep-wake cycle and the stress 
responses through their interactions with OX receptor 1 (OX1R) and OX receptor 2 
(OX2R), respectively. OX/OXR cascade demonstrates intricate neuroprotective and 
anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) and 
PLC/Ca2+ pathway activation. OX1R binds OXA more strongly than OXB by one-order 
ratio, whereas OX2R binds both OXA and OXB with equal strengths. Overexpression 
of OXs in individuals experiences sleep deprivation, circadian rhythm 
disturbances, insomnia-associated MCI, Parkinson's disease (PD), and Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). Many dual OXR antagonists (DORAs) have been effective in their 
clinical studies, with suvorexant and daridorexant receiving FDA clearance for 
insomnia therapy in 2014 and 2022 respectively. The results of clinical studies 
suggested that there is a new pharmaceutical option for treating insomnia and 
the sleep deprivation-AD/PD relationship by targeting the OXR system. DORAs 
treatment reduces Aβ deposition in the brain and improves synaptic plasticity 
and circadian expression. This review indicates the link between sleep disorders 
and MCI, DORAs are an appropriate medication category for treating insomnia, and 
sleep deprivation links AD and PD.

BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative 
disorder characterized by the loss of both upper and lower motor neurons, 
leading to progressive paralysis. Both genetic alterations and epigenetic 
modifications contribute to neuronal dysfunction in the pathogenesis of ALS. 
However, the mechanism behind genetic mutations in the non-coding region of 
genes that affect epigenetic modifications remains unclear.
METHODS: Convolutional neural network was used to identify an ALS-associated SNP 
located in the intronic region of MEF2C (rs304152), residing in a putative 
enhancer element. To examine the alteration of MEF2C transcription by the SNP, 
we generated HEK293T cells carrying the major or minor allele by CRISPR-Cas9. To 
verify the role of MEF2C-knockdown (MEF2C-KD) in mice, we developed AAV 
expressing shRNA for MEF2C based on AAV-U6 promoter vector. Neuropathological 
alterations of MEF2C-KD mice with mitochondrial dysfunction and motor neuronal 
damage were observed by confocal microscopy and transmission electron microscope 
(TEM). Behavioral changes of mice were examined through longitudinal study by 
tail suspension, inverted grid test and automated gait analysis.
RESULTS: Here, we show that enhancer mutation of MEF2C reduces own gene 
expression and consequently impairs mitochondrial function in motor neurons. 
MEF2C localizes and binds to the mitochondria DNA, and directly modulates 
mitochondria-encoded gene expression. CRISPR/Cas-9-induced mutation of the MEF2C 
enhancer decreases expression of mitochondria-encoded genes. Moreover, MEF2C 
mutant cells show reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential, ATP level but 
elevation of oxidative stress. MEF2C deficiency in the upper and lower motor 
neurons of mice impairs mitochondria-encoded genes, and leads to mitochondrial 
metabolic disruption and progressive motor behavioral deficits.
CONCLUSIONS: Together, MEF2C dysregulation by the enhancer mutation leads to 
mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, which are prevalent features in 
motor neuronal damage and ALS pathogenesis. This genetic and epigenetic 
crosstalk mechanism provides insights for advancing our understanding of motor 
neuron disease and developing effective treatments.

BACKGROUND: There is a growing concern and debate over the inappropriate use of 
analgesics and psychotropic medications by older adults, especially those with 
dementia. The long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown measures 
on these prescriptions remain uncertain.
AIM: The primary aim was to examine changes in the prescription of analgesics 
(opioids and other analgesics) and psychotropics (anxiolytics/sedatives, 
antidepressants, and antipsychotics) in Norwegian home-dwelling older adults 
before, during, and up to 2 years after the COVID-19 lockdown, with a particular 
focus on dementia status. Secondarily, we explored individual characteristics 
associated with changes in medication prescriptions.
METHODS: A prospective cohort study using baseline data from 10,464 participants 
(54% females, mean age 76 years [SD 5.8]) from the Norwegian Trøndelag Health 
Study (HUNT4 70+) linked with the Norwegian Prescription Database. Age- and 
education-adjusted Poisson regression was applied to examine changes in 
prescription fills, and multilevel mixed-effects linear regression was used to 
estimate the mean sum of defined daily dose (DDD) per person per period during 
the lockdown (March-September 2020) compared to that during the corresponding 
months (March-September) in 2019, 2021, and 2022.
RESULTS: Overall, prescriptions of opioids, other analgesics, and 
anxiolytics/sedatives were higher in 2022 than during the lockdown. People 
without dementia had increased prescriptions of opioids, other analgesics, and 
antidepressants after lockdown, whereas no changes were observed among those 
with dementia. Increases in prescriptions of opioids, other analgesics, 
anxiolytics/sedatives, and antidepressants between the lockdown and 2022 
occurred mainly among those aged < 80 years, without comorbidities or mental 
distress, with good physical function, low fear of COVID-19, and no social 
isolation during COVID-19.
CONCLUSION: An increase in analgesics and psychotropics after the lockdown was 
predominantly observed among younger-old and healthier participants. This 
indicates that in high-income countries, such as Norway, home-dwelling 
vulnerable individuals seem to have received adequate care. However, the 
pandemic may have increased the number of vulnerable individuals. These findings 
should be considered when identifying future nationwide stressors that may 
impair social interactions and threaten mental health. They also highlight the 
need to evaluate medication prescriptions for older adults after the pandemic.

With the continue emergence of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-modifying therapies, 
pinpointing the treatments that offer the greatest benefits to patients is 
increasingly critical. Complementary diagnostics are powerful tests that can 
provide crucial biomarker dynamics about the drug usage that can improve 
treatment outcomes by individualized pharmacotherapy. Herein, we exploited a 
robust near-infrared fluorescent probe, by attenuating the pre-twisting tendency 
and the twist intramolecular charge transfer effect, for sensing of Hcy in vitro 
and in vivo with high quantum yield, excellent selectivity, and remarkable 
sensitivity. The probe is capable of monitoring endogenous Hcy dynamics in 
cells, tissues and in vivo with exceptional blood-brain barrier permeability. 
Specifically, we revealed that Hcy can contribute to the onset and development 
of AD by facilitating the formation of amyloid-β aggregates, elucidating the 
intricate relationship between brain Hcy levels and AD progression. Furthermore, 
we investigated the effect of four licensed drugs on endogenous marker Hcy 
dynamics in cells and in mice with AD model. Our study provides a valuable 
molecular probe platform utilizing Hcy as a biomarker for supplementary 
diagnosis applications.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Cuscuta reflexa (family Convolvulaceae), commonly known as 
giant dodder or Amarbel, is a parasitic plant that has garnered attention in 
pharmacological research due to its diverse bioactive compounds and potential 
therapeutic applications. Scientific studies have validated its traditional uses 
in folk medicine, highlighting its pharmacological activities. Alzheimer's 
Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder marked by the buildup of amyloid-β 
(Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) in the brain, leading to synaptic 
impairment and the gradual loss of neurons. Currently, no effective medication 
is available to treat the development and progression of the disease. Hence, 
there is a rising concern about using alternative therapy such as herbal 
medicine to limit the progression of AD and improve the quality of a patient's 
life with minimum side effects. The plant Cuscuta reflexa has traditionally been 
claimed to possess neuroprotective effects but has not yet been validated 
scientifically. The present study aimed to investigate the potential of the 
hydroalcoholic extract of Cuscuta reflexa (CRE) to ameliorate the 
neurodegenerative effect of aluminium chloride (AlCl3) using in vitro and in 
vivo studies.
METHODS: The neuroprotective activity of CRE was evaluated using in vitro and in 
vivo experimental models of AlCl3-induced AD.
RESULTS: The in vitro study showed that CRE markedly reduced AlCl3-induced 
cytotoxicity in PC12 cells. The in vivo study using the AlCl3-induced AD rat 
model showed that CRE treatment improved learning and memory, as evaluated using 
the open field test (OFT) and Morris water maze (MWM) test. CRE also showed the 
reduction in oxidative stress induced by AlCl3 in the brains of the rats by 
virtue of the significant decrease in oxidative stress biomarker malondialdehyde 
(MDA) and increase in the antioxidant parameters such as reduced glutathione 
(GSH), catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Further, CRE exhibited its 
cholinergic activity by lowering the AlCl3-induced enhanced levels of 
acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in the brains of rats. Histopathological analysis of 
the brains of rats showed that CRE treatment prevented the reactive changes and 
the damage in the neuronal tissue caused due to the AlCl3.
CONCLUSION: Conclusively, CRE ameliorated AlCl3-induced neurobehavioural 
toxicity in the rat model of AD by virtue of its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, 
cholinergic and neuroprotective effects which suggests its use in the treatment 
of progressive neural damage and cognitive deficits in AD patients.

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), tau pathology is closely associated with disease 
progression. Therefore, therapeutics that alleviate tau pathology are essential. 
Liver-X receptor (LXR) has garnered interest as a potential target for the 
treatment of AD. We previously investigated the potent anti-allergic and 
anti-inflammatory effects of inotodiol, hereafter referred to as CE9A215, in 
various disease models. In this study, we explored the potential of CE9A215 as a 
treatment for AD. CE9A215 preferentially activated LXRβ (EC50 <10 nM), with no 
significant activation observed for LXRα at concentrations up to 1000 nM. 
Pharmacokinetic analysis confirmed that CE9A215 crosses the blood-brain barrier 
and accumulates in the brain. Moreover, CE9A215 modulated the expression of 
ABCA1, APOE, SREBP-1c and AQP4 in the brains of wild-type and LXR α/β knockout 
mice in LXRβ-dependent manner. The efficacy of CE9A215 on AD-related pathologies 
was evaluated using 3xTg-AD mice. CE9A215 exerted both prophylactic and 
therapeutic effects on AD-associated behaviors and pathologies, including 
reductions in amyloid-β, phosphorylated tau, and neuroinflammation in the 
hippocampus. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that CE9A215 induced significant 
changes in genes associated with tau pathology, particularly in pathways related 
to protein phosphorylation and PI3K/AKT signaling. Our findings suggest that 
CE9A215 could be a promising therapeutic candidate for AD, particularly in 
mitigating tau hyperphosphorylation and related AD pathologies.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Osteoarthritis (OA) have been shown to 
have a close association in previous studies, but the pathogenesis of both 
diseases are unclear. This study explores the potential common molecular 
mechanisms between AD and OA through bioinformatics analysis, providing new 
insights for clinical treatment strategies.
METHODS: The AD and OA-related datasets were downloaded from the gene expression 
database GEO. The datasets were analyzed to obtain differentially expressed gene 
(DEG) datasets for OA and AD, respectively. The intersection of these DEGs was 
analyzed to identify common DEGs (Co-DEGs). Subsequently, the Co-DEGs were 
enriched, and a protein-protein interaction network was constructed to identify 
core genes. The expression of these genes was validated in a separate dataset, 
and their diagnostic value for the diseases was analyzed. In addition, the core 
genes were analyzed using gene set enrichment analysis and single-gene genome 
variation analysis.
RESULTS: Analysis of DEGs on gene chips from OA and AD patients revealed 
significant changes in gene expression patterns. Notably, EFEMP2 and TSPO, genes 
associated with inflammatory responses, showed lower expression levels in both 
AD and OA patients, suggesting a downregulation in the pathological backgrounds 
of these diseases. Additionally, GABARAPL1, which is crucial for the maturation 
of autophagosomes, was found to be upregulated in both conditions. These 
findings suggest the potential of these genes as diagnostic biomarkers and 
potential therapeutic targets. However, to confirm the effectiveness of these 
genes as therapeutic targets, more in-depth mechanistic studies are needed in 
the future, particularly to explore the feasibility and specific mechanisms of 
combating disease progression by regulating the expression of these genes.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that AD and OA shares common molecular 
mechanisms. The identification of EFEMP2, GABARAPL1, and TSPO as key target 
genes highlights potential common factors in both diseases. Further 
investigation into these findings could lead to new candidate targets and 
treatment directions for AD and OA, offering promising avenues for developing 
more effective and targeted therapeutic interventions.

Perioperative neurocognitive disorder (PND) is a significant neurological 
complication in aging perioperative patients that impacts post-operative 
cognition. PND is currently diagnosed through cognitive function testing, which 
is limited by its subjectivity and time requirements. Thus, the identification 
of biomarkers to assess PND onset is a priority to identify at-risk individuals 
and enable interventions and treatments to patient outcomes. This article 
synthesizes expert perspectives on brain aging and PND, presents the latest 
clinical evidence on PND biomarkers (imaging, electroencephalography, and 
molecular biomarkers), and delves into the relationship between PND and other 
age-related cognitive disorders. Thorough review of PND research identified 
several biomarkers with high sensitivity and specificity, offering a solid 
scientific foundation to predict and diagnose PND. These biomarkers not only 
enhance diagnostic accuracy for clinicians but also provide opportunities for 
earlier intervention and more effective treatment, potentially enhancing patient 
outcomes and quality of life.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia worldwide, 
characterized by accumulation of amyloid-β protein and hyperphosphorylated tau 
protein in the brain. Neuroinflammation, resulting from chronic activation of 
brain-resident innate immune cells as well as enhanced peripheral leukocyte 
access across the blood-brain barrier, crucially affects AD progression. In this 
context, TNFSF10, a cytokine substantially expressed in the AD brain, has been 
shown to modulate both the innate and the adaptive branches of the immune 
response in AD-related neuroinflammation. In this study, we explored whether a 
TNFSF10-neutralizing treatment could represent a tool to re-balance the overall 
overshooting inflammatory response in a mouse model of AD. Specifically, 3xTg-AD 
mice were treated sub-chronically with an anti-TNFSF10 monoclonal antibody for 
three months, and were then sacrificed at 15 months. TNFSF10 neutralization 
reduced the expression of the inflammatory marker CD86, inversely related to 
levels of the anti-inflammatory marker CD206 in the brain of 3xTg-AD mice, 
suggesting a switch of microglia towards a neuroprotective phenotype. Similar 
results were observed in the splenic macrophage population. Moreover, flow 
cytometry revealed a significant decrease of CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ T regulatory cells 
as well as reduced number of CD11b+LY6Chigh proinflammatory monocytes in both 
the brain and the spleen of 3xTg-AD mice treated with anti-TNFSF10 monoclonal 
antibody. Finally, the treatment resulted in lower count of splenic CD4+ and 
CD8+ T cells expressing PD1. The data suggest that TNFSF10 system-targeted 
treatment effectively restrain overshooting central and peripheral inflammation 
by rebalancing the overall immune response, mitigating the progression of 
AD pathology.

OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to assess emergency medical services (EMS) 
provider-perceived Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) by patient 
sociodemographic characteristics and ZIP code tabulation areas (ZCTA) in the 
prehospital setting.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective descriptive analysis of EMS calls with 
patient contact for adults ≥ 65 years of age who were provided prehospital care 
between February 1, 2020 and January 31, 2022, using data from the San Francisco 
Department of Emergency Management and the 2021 American Community Survey. 
Logistic regression models assessed the associated between EMS 
provider-perceived ADRD and patient sociodemographic characteristics, including 
age, race/ethnicity, incident location, and ZCTA-level socioeconomic status.
RESULTS: A total of 55,129 patient encounters were recorded, with EMS 
provider-perceived ADRD recorded in 4,112 (7.5%). Among cases with EMS 
provider-perceived ADRD, the most common primary impressions were mental 
disorders (17.1%), weakness (17.0%), injury (15.7%), and pain (13.1%). 
Increasing age was associated with higher odds of EMS provider-perceived ADRD 
among both sexes. Among females, EMS provider-perceived ADRD was higher among 
Hispanics (odds ratio [OR] 1.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11-1.52), Blacks 
(OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.03-1.40), Asians (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.06-1.31), and Native 
Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.05-2.08]), while among males, 
only Asians (OR 87, 95% CI .76-.99) had lower odds, all compared to Whites. 
Females in low- and medium-income ZCTAs had lower odds of EMS provider-perceived 
ADRD relative to high-income ZCTAs, with no significant findings in males.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest a higher prevalence of EMS provider-perceived 
Alzheimer's disease and related dementias among minoritized and 
socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, including the oldest adults, and 
racial and ethnic minority communities. Future research and more precise data 
collection is needed to ensure equity for older adults who access emergency care 
in the prehospital setting.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by cognitive decline and memory loss, with oxidative stress and 
neuroinflammation playing crucial roles in its progression. Current treatments, 
such as acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors, offer limited symptomatic relief 
and can have side effects. With growing interest in functional foods that have 
fewer side effects, pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) has gained attention 
because of its rich antioxidant content. The present study aims to evaluate the 
antioxidant and neuroprotective effects of four pomegranate cultivars: 
'Wonderful', 'Phoenicia', 'Azadi' and 'Eversweet'. Additionally, it investigates 
their metabolite profiles and predicts potential bioactive compounds that could 
help prevent AD.
RESULTS: The 'Wonderful' cultivar demonstrated the highest levels of total 
phenolic content, total flavonoid content, total anthocyanin content and radical 
scavenging activities. The AChE and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) inhibition 
rates were highest in 'Phoenicia' and 'Wonderful' cultivars, suggesting 
potential neuroprotective effects. PC12 cell assays indicated that these 
cultivars significantly improved cell viability, reduced reactive oxygen species 
and malondialdehyde levels, and also enhanced catalase activity. Metabolomics 
analysis identified 141 metabolites, with the 'Wonderful' cultivar showing the 
highest metabolite abundance. Molecular docking studies indicated that some 
metabolites, such as taxifolin, demonstrated strong binding affinities for AChE 
and BuChE, suggesting potential for AD treatment.
CONCLUSION: The 'Wonderful' and 'Phoenicia' cultivars demonstrated the most 
promising antioxidant and neuroprotective effects among the evaluated 
pomegranates, likely because of their high taxifolin content. These findings 
suggest that these cultivars could be valuable for developing functional foods 
aimed at AD prevention and treatment. © 2025 Society of Chemical Industry.

Aromatase inhibitors are used for patients with hormone-receptor positive breast 
cancer. Alzheimer's disease is the most prevalent cause of dementia. Several 
studies have suggested an association between the use of aromatase inhibitors 
and the development of Alzheimer's disease. The objective of this study was to 
identify potential pharmacovigilance signals associated with dementia and 
Alzheimer's disease and third-generation aromatase inhibitors in menopausal and 
postmenopausal women. VigiBase, the global database of individual case safety 
reports of the World Health Organization, was used to investigate this possible 
association. A disproportionality analysis was performed for women aged 45 years 
and older. The reporting odds ratio (ROR) and its 95% CI for reporting dementia 
are exemestane, 2.08 (1.35-3.19); anastrozole, 1.59 (1.09-2.32); and letrozole, 
1.43 (1.05-1.95) and for Alzheimer's disease are exemestane, 0.94 (0.30-2.92); 
anastrozole: 2.63 (1.55-4.45); and letrozole, 1.33 (0.76-2.35). For senile 
dementia, only letrozole has cases, with an ROR of 6.77 (2.51-18.31). Signals of 
disproportionate reporting have been observed between the occurrence of 
dementia, dementia Alzheimer's type, and senile dementia with aromatase 
inhibitors, which is in line with estrogen functions and aromatase activity, as 
well as the findings from preclinical studies. Additional research is required 
to elucidate this intricate matter.

Neuron loss is the main feature of neurodegenerative diseases. The two most 
prevalent neurodegenerative illnesses are Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. 
While several medications are currently approved to treat neurodegenerative 
disorders, most of them only address the symptoms that are related to the 
disorders. Owing to their severity and complex multifactorial pathophysiology, 
the approved medications currently in clinical use have not demonstrated 
sufficient efficacy and have limited therapeutic options. Enhancing medicine 
quality can be achieved using highly efficient conjugate chemistry methods, 
necessitating ongoing discovery efforts on hybrid drugs in academia and 
industry. The present review illustrates hybrid compounds and the design 
strategies that helped to create them. Developing multi-target directed ligands 
(MTDLs) is a more advantageous and sensible strategy for treating long-term 
complex illnesses like neurodegenerative diseases. Compared to classic 
treatments, hybrid drugs can deliver combination therapies in a single 
multifunctional agent, making them more potent and specific. Three main 
objectives are being initiated by using hybridization techniques in drug design: 
(i) increasing selectivity, (ii) improving activity, and (iii) reducing 
toxicity. The development of hybrid medications may offer a valuable method for 
producing compounds that are less likely to develop resistance and more likely 
to be effective. Hybrid drugs hold great promise, but a few technical and 
regulatory obstacles must be overcome before they can be successfully used in 
clinical settings.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and related dementia 
(ADRD) is on the rise. There is a corresponding escalation in the number of 
persons living with dementia who require complex, longitudinal support in care 
due to the progressive declines in cognitive and clinical profiles of persons 
living with dementia when delivering individualized person-centered care that 
promotes overall health and well-being. Hence, we aim to describe the presence 
and patterns of co-occurring comorbidities in persons living with dementia.
METHODS: This study is a retrospective, cross-sectional descriptive analysis 
based on curated electronic health record data from the All of Us Research 
Program from October 1, 2015, to June 30, 2022. We included individuals who were 
65 years of age or older with at least one dementia-related diagnosis. We 
categorized 14 comorbidities by the Charlson Comorbidity Index, and defined all 
diseases based on the International Classification of Diseases Tenth Revision 
Diagnosis codes. We employed descriptive statistics and visualized data with 
UpSet Plots. Demographic characteristics (i.e., age, sex, race, and ethnicity) 
between people with and without co-occurring comorbidities were compared with 
either chi-square or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests.
RESULTS: Persons living with dementia (N = 4003) were a mean of 73 years old, 
72.5% non-Hispanic White, and 47.5% female. Approximately 87% of persons living 
with dementia were diagnosed with at least one additional comorbidity. The most 
common comorbidities included diabetes (67.82%), renal disease (40.24%), chronic 
pulmonary disease (39.85%), congestive heart failure (37.37%), and peripheral 
vascular disease (34.57%). Heterogeneous patterns of co-occurring comorbidity 
were noted among persons living with dementia.
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates the high prevalence of co-occurring comorbid 
illness among persons living with dementia. It is critical that the impact of 
these co-occurring conditions on patients' disease trajectories be better 
understood to promote treatment choices that are person-centered and 
goal-concordant.

INTRODUCTION: Researchers have shown that music-evoked autobiographical memories 
(MEAMs) can stimulate long-term memory mechanisms while requiring little 
retrieval effort and may therefore be used in promising non-pharmacological 
interventions to mitigate memory deficits. Despite an increasing number of 
studies on MEAMs, few researchers have explored how MEAMs are bound in the 
brain.
METHODS: In the current study activation indexed by fractional amplitude of low 
frequency fluctuations (fALFF) during familiar and unfamiliar MEAM retrieval was 
compared in a sample of 24 healthy older adults. Additionally, we aimed to 
investigate the impact of age-related gray matter volume (GMV) reduction in key 
regions associated with MEAM-related activation. In addition to a T1 structural 
scan, neuroimaging data were collected while participants listened to familiar 
music (MEAM retrieval) versus unfamiliar music.
RESULTS: When listening to familiar compared to unfamiliar music, greater fALFF 
activation patterns were observed in the right parahippocampal gyrus, 
controlling for age and GMV. The current findings for the familiar (MEAM) 
condition have implications for cognitive aging as persons experiencing 
age-related memory decline are particularly susceptible to volumetric reduction 
in the parahippocampal cortex. Post-hoc analyses to explore correlations between 
brain activity and the content of MEAMs were performed using the text analysis 
program Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count.
DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that MEAM-related activation of the 
parahippocampal cortex is evident in normative older adults. However, it is yet 
to be determined whether such brain states are attainable in older adult 
populations diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment and/or prodromal 
Alzheimer's disease.

BACKGROUND: The clinical presentations of early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) 
and late-onset Alzheimer's disease are distinct, with EOAD having a more 
aggressive disease course with greater heterogeneity. Recent publications from 
the Longitudinal Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease Study (LEADS) described EOAD as 
predominantly amnestic, though this phenotypic description was based solely on 
clinical judgment. To better understand the phenotypic range of EOAD 
presentation, we applied a neuropsychological data-driven method to subtype the 
LEADS cohort.
METHODS: Neuropsychological test performance from 169 amyloid-positive EOAD 
participants were analyzed. Education-corrected normative comparisons were made 
using a sample of 98 cognitively normal participants. Comparing the relative 
levels of impairment between each cognitive domain, we applied a cut-off of 1 SD 
below all other domain scores to indicate a phenotype of "predominant" 
impairment in a given cognitive domain. Individuals were otherwise considered to 
have multidomain impairment. Whole-cortex general linear modeling of cortical 
atrophy was applied as an MRI-based validation of these distinct clinical 
phenotypes.
RESULTS: We identified 6 phenotypic subtypes of EOAD: Dysexecutive Predominant 
(22% of sample), Amnestic Predominant (11%), Language Predominant (11%), 
Visuospatial Predominant (15%), Mixed Amnestic/Dysexecutive Predominant (11%), 
and Multidomain (30%). These phenotypes did not differ by age, sex, or years of 
education. The APOE ɛ4 genotype was enriched in the Amnestic Predominant group, 
who were also rated as least impaired. Cortical thickness analysis validated 
these clinical phenotypes with dissociations in atrophy patterns observed 
between the Dysexecutive and Amnestic Predominant groups. In contrast to the 
heterogeneity observed from our neuropsychological data-driven approach, 
diagnostic classifications for this same sample based solely on clinical 
judgment indicated that 82% of individuals were amnestic-predominant, 9% were 
non-amnestic, 4% met criteria for Posterior Cortical Atrophy, and 5% met 
criteria for Primary Progressive Aphasia.
CONCLUSION: A neuropsychological data-driven method to phenotype EOAD 
individuals uncovered a more detailed understanding of the presenting 
heterogeneity in this atypical AD sample compared to clinical judgment alone. 
Clinicians and patients may over-report memory dysfunction at the expense of 
non-memory symptoms. These findings have important implications for diagnostic 
accuracy and treatment considerations.

OBJECTIVE: Due to the recognition for the importance of early intervention in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), it is important to focus on prevention and treatment 
strategies for mild cognitive impairment (MCI). This study aimed to establish a 
risk prediction model for AD among MCI patients to provide clinical guidance for 
primary medical institutions.
METHODS: Data from MCI subjects were obtained from the NACC. Importance ranking 
and the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method for the Random Survival 
Forest (RSF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithms in ensemble 
learning were adopted to select the predictors, and hierarchical clustering 
analysis was used to mitigate multicollinearity. The RSF, XGBoost and Cox 
proportional hazard regression (Cox) models were established to predict the risk 
of AD among MCI patients. Additionally, the effects of the three models were 
evaluated.
RESULTS: A total of 3674 subjects with MCI were included. Thirteen predictors 
were ultimately identified. In the validation set, the concordance indices were 
0.781 (RSF), 0.781 (XGBoost), and 0.798 (Cox), and the Integrated Brier Score 
was 0.087 (Cox). The prediction effects of the XGBoost and RSF models were not 
better than those of the Cox model.
CONCLUSION: The ensemble learning method can effectively select predictors of AD 
risk among MCI subjects. The Cox proportional hazards regression model could be 
used in primary medical institutions to rapidly screen for the risk of AD among 
MCI patients once the model is fully clinically validated. The predictors were 
easy to explain and obtain, and the prediction of AD was accurate.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative disorder that poses a serious threat 
because it has no cure. Recently, mitochondrial dysfunction has been shown to 
directly promote the development of AD. An imbalance in mitochondrial calcium 
(mCa2+) homeostasis is an important cause of mitochondrial dysfunction. Abnormal 
expression of mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU), a key channel responsible 
for mCa2+ uptake, can induce an imbalance in mCa2+ homeostasis, ultimately 
leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. Importantly, we observed a much higher 
expression level of MCU in the hippocampus of amyloid precursor protein 
(APP)/presenilin 1 (PS1)/tau transgenic mice than that in the hippocampus of 
control mice (C57), suggesting that MCU may be a target for the development of 
treatments for AD. Our recent study revealed the neuroprotective effect of MCU 
knockdown on hippocampal neurons in APP/PS1/tau mice. In the present study, we 
used MCU knockdown to investigate the cellular mechanisms involved in amyloid-β 
(Aβ)1-42 and okadaic acid (OA) cell models of AD. We found that MCU knockdown 
could increase the survival and decrease the apoptosis of these two cell models 
by lowering mCa2+ overload, further increasing the mitochondrial membrane 
potential (MMP) and ultimately reducing the overproduction of reactive oxygen 
species (ROS). This study showed that MCU knockdown could increase the 
proliferation and viability of HT22 hippocampal neurons, which might explain the 
neuroprotective effect of MCU knockdown on AD, potentially leading to the 
development of novel and effective therapies for AD.

Microglia, the brain's resident macrophages, are key mediators of 
neuroinflammation, responding to immune pathogens and toxins. They play a 
crucial role in clearing cellular debris, regulating synaptic plasticity, and 
phagocytosing amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies 
indicate that microglia not only exhibit intrinsic circadian rhythms but are 
also regulated by circadian clock genes, influencing specific functions such as 
phagocytosis and the modulation of neuroinflammation. Disruption of the 
circadian rhythm is closely associated with AD pathology. In this review, we 
will provide an overview of how circadian rhythms regulate microglia-mediated 
neuroinflammation in the progression of AD, focusing on the pathway from the 
central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral immune system. We also discuss 
potential therapeutic targets, including hormone modulation, lifestyle 
interventions, and anti-inflammatory therapies, aimed at maintaining brain 
health in AD. This will shed light on the involvement of circadian rhythm in AD 
and explore new avenues for AD treatment.

Although Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects millions of individuals worldwide, 
there are currently no effective treatments available. Recent findings have 
suggested that non-nuclear estrogen receptor (ER) signaling represents promising 
therapeutic target for central nervous system disorders, offering potential 
treatments without the significant side effects associated with the activation 
of nuclear ERs. Because ER signaling deficiency and autophagy impairment have 
been linked to AD etiology, the present study aimed to selectively target 
non-nuclear ERs signaling pathways with PaPE-1 and identify autophagy-related 
mechanisms of neuroprotection in a cellular model of AD. The present study 
demonstrated that PaPE-1 protected mouse cortical neurons from AD pathology, as 
evidenced by MAP2-specific labeling. Posttreatment with PaPE-1 reversed the 
amyloid-β (Aβ)-evoked decrease in autophagic vesicles level, and increased the 
expression of autophagy-related mRNAs and proteins, accompanied by 
hypomethylation of the Atg7 gene. Moreover, posttreatment with PaPE-1 increased 
the levels of membrane fraction receptors ESR1/ERα and ESR2/ERβ, which 
corresponds to increased Esr1 and Esr2 mRNA expression and DNA hypomethylation 
of specific genes. In addition to inhibiting DNA methylation of autophagy and 
ER-related genes, PaPE-1 did not alter global DNA methylation but stimulated HAT 
activity in Aβ-treated cells. In summary, PaPE-1 promoted neuroprotection 
against Aβ-induced toxicity that involved stimulation of autophagy, upregulation 
of membrane ESR1 and ESR2 and decreased DNA methylation of respective genes. The 
present study proposes a novel therapeutic approach against AD that is based on 
the selective activation of non-nuclear ER signaling to overcome Aβ-induced 
autophagy deficits and normalize the epigenetic status of cerebral neurons.

JAL-TA9 (YKGSGFRMI), is a 9-residue catalytic peptide that cleaves amyloid β 
(Aβ) 42. Nasal administration was chosen to bypass the blood-brain barrier for 
efficient brain delivery of JAL-TA9 to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD). Plasma 
clearance of JAL-TA9 after intravenous bolus injection in rats was very rapid, 
with a half-life of <1 min. The stability of JAL-TA9 in cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) was much better than that in plasma and whole blood in vitro, suggesting 
the advantage of direct nasal delivery to avoid rapid elimination from the 
blood. JAL-TA9 in CSF was 0.115 μg/mL 10 min after nasal administration to rats, 
but below the detection limit after intravenous injection, indicating a 
significant direct delivery of JAL-TA9 to the brain. In mice brain, JAL-TA9 
concentration was higher after nasal administration than that after 
intraperitoneal administration. Additionally, peak concentration in the 
olfactory bulb (OB) after nasal application was at 5 min, whereas in the frontal 
and occipital brains peaked at 30 and 60 min, respectively, suggesting 
sequential backward translocation of JAL-TA9 within the brain after direct 
transport from the nasal cavity to the OB. Therefore, nasal administration 
allows the efficient delivery of JAL-TA9 to the brain and may be a potential in 
AD treatment.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is prevalent in the elderly, with amyloid-β (Aβ) 
playing a critical role in its progression. Polysaccharides have garnered 
increasing attention due to their low toxicity and diverse applications in 
alleviating AD-like symptoms. However, the potential of ginger leaf 
polysaccharide in mitigating AD-like symptoms has been rarely investigated. In 
this study, we isolated a polysaccharide (GLP1) from ginger leaf and evaluated 
its efficacy and underlying mechanisms in alleviating AD-like symptoms using 
Caenorhabditis elegans and PC12 cells. GLP1 ameliorated AD-like symptoms in C. 
elegans, as evidenced by a 41.50 % increase in head thrashing frequency and an 
87.13 % increase in body bending frequency. Furthermore, GLP1 mitigated 
cognitive decline by 76.51 %. Additionally, GLP1 enhanced the activity of 
acetylcholinesterase in C. elegans and maintained the integrity of neural system 
function. Moreover, GLP1 improved the survival rate of PC12 cells under Aβ 
induction by activating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, which also resulted in a 
reduction in the release of inflammatory factors, specifically IL-1β by 21.15 %, 
IL-6 by 39.98 %, and TNF-α by 19.66 %. Notably, FITC-labeled GLP1 could be 
absorbed by PC12 cells. These compelling findings underscored the therapeutic 
potential of GLP1 in alleviating Aβ-induced AD-like symptoms and supported the 
advancement of ginger leaf resource utilization.

Mounting evidence suggests that neuroinflammation is involved in the 
pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Amyloid β peptide (Aβ) could recruit and activate microglia, leading to the 
generation of pro-inflammatory factors, and ultimately neuroinflammation. 
Chitooligosaccharide (COS) is widely recognized as anti-inflammation bioactive 
substance, though whether it exerts beneficial effect on AD is unclear. In this 
study, we explored the effect of COS on AD prevention and treatment. We found 
that COS ameliorated cognitive deficiency, increased the expression of Nrf2 but 
decreased Aβ levels and the activation of NF-κB in APP/PS1 mice. In vitro, COS 
decreased the secretions of IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α in 
Aβ25-35 + lipopolysaccharides (LPS) -exposed BV2 microglia. Meanwhile, COS 
down-regulated the expressions of iNOS, COX-2, NLRP3, caspase 1 and the nuclear 
translocation of NF-κB p65, while upregulated the expressions of Nrf2 and HO-1. 
Further, COS improved the viability of SK-N-SH cells that exposed to 
Aβ25-35 + LPS-stimulated microglial conditioned media, and the repressive effect 
of COS on NLRP3, iNOS, and phospho-NF-κB p65 expressions were markedly 
compromised upon Nrf2-siRNA transfection. Collectively, COS improved cognitive 
decline and suppressed neuroinflammation via the Nrf2/NF-κB signaling axis, 
suggesting COS might be a promising candidate in down-regulating inflammatory 
responses during AD progression.

The neurotrophic factor Neuritin is known to enhance cognitive capacity and to 
mitigate synaptic impairments in the APP/PS1 Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse 
model, suggesting therapeutic potential for clinical treatment. However, the 
core molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Ferroptosis, a form of programmed cell 
death linked to iron dysregulation and oxidative stress, contributes to 
neurodegeneration in AD in part by accelerating amyloid-β deposition and 
neurofibrillary tangle formation. Here we examined if Neuritin can mitigate 
cognitive decline and neural degeneration in AD model mice by suppressing 
ferroptosis. Age-dependent cognitive decline was associated with Neuritin 
downregulation and increased ferroptosis in the hippocampus. 
Intracerebroventricular injection of exogenous Neuritin mitigated spatial and 
fear learning deficits as well as neural oxidative stress, apoptosis, and 
ferroptosis in the hippocampus without causing deleterious side effects. 
Neuritin injection also upregulated the activity of NAD+ kinase (NADK), the 
enzyme responsible for converting NAD to anti-ferroptotic NADPH, in the 
hippocampus of AD mice as well as in cultured hippocampal neurons. Reduced 
Neuritin expression in the hippocampus AD mice was associated with reduced 
phosphorylation (activation) of Akt (p-Akt), and Neuritin administration 
enhanced p-Akt expression in both HT22 cells and AD model mice. Conversely, 
blocking the PI3K/Akt pathway in HT22 cells reversed the Neuritin-induced 
increase in NADK activity and reduction in ferroptosis, indicating that Neuritin 
protects neurons from AD-induced damage by enhancing NADK activity through the 
PI3K/Akt pathway. Collectively, our results support Neuritin upregulation as a 
potential therapeutic strategy for early-phase AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative brain disease and 
represents the most frequent type of dementia characterized by cognitive 
impairment and amnesia. AD neuropathology is connected to the development of 
synaptic dysfunction and loss of synaptic homeostasis due to an imbalance in the 
production and clearance of β-amyloid (Aβ) and intracellular neurofibrillary 
tangles (NFTs). However, AD neuropathology is complex and may relate to the 
deposition of other misfolded proteins, such as alpha-synuclein (α-Syn). Of 
note, α-Syn, which is involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease (PD) and 
Lewy body (LB) dementia, is also implicated in AD neuropathology. However, the 
potential role of α-Syn in AD neuropathology is elusive. Therefore, this review 
aims to discuss the pathological role of α-Syn in AD and how targeting α-Syn 
aggregates may be effective in treating AD.

BACKGROUND: A retrospective study was conducted in people with HIV (PWH) to 
explore potential cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers linked to CSF 
neurofilament light levels (NfL), indicative of neuronal injury.
METHODS: A sample of 168 participants was tested, including 43 HIV-negative 
controls and PWH who were classified into subgroups based on HIV and treatment 
status. Twenty CSF protein biomarkers were analyzed for their association with 
CSF NfL concentrations using a linear regression forward selection strategy, 
adjusted for age and sex. Regression trees were utilized to visualize feature 
relationships.
RESULTS: Age-adjusted average concentrations of CSF NfL ranged from 427 pg/mL 
(SD = 190) in HIV- participants to 6456 pg/mL (SD = 46,024) in participants with 
HIV-associated dementia. Significant associations were found between specific 
biomarkers and CSF NfL levels in different participant subgroups. Noteworthy 
findings included correlations between CSF t-tau, CSF MCP-1, CSF TNF-α, and 
albumin ratio with CSF NfL levels in untreated PWH, and CSF IL-21 with CSF NfL 
in treated, virally suppressed PWH. Association between age and CSF NfL 
concentrations was a general finding.
CONCLUSION: We identified specific CSF biomarkers, including CSF t-tau protein, 
CSF MCP-1, and CSF TNF-α that associated with CSF NfL concentrations in 
untreated PWH and CSF IL-21 that associated with CSF NfL in PWH with effective 
treatment, shedding light on neuroinflammatory processes which may underlie 
HIV-related neuronal injury and the impact of antiviral therapy. Further 
investigations are needed to validate if elevated CSF IL-21 concentrations 
persist during long-term treatment, and if particular drug combinations are 
optimal for decreasing inflammatory latency.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of progressive neurodegenerative 
dementia, affecting approximately 50 million individuals globally. Recent 
studies have highlighted the differential expression of circular RNAs (circRNAs) 
in AD, which may disrupt the circRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks in neuronal 
cells. This work aims to integrate network pharmacology with in silico drug 
design to identify novel druggable targets for AD and propose promising drug 
candidates. We analyzed two circRNA datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus, 
employing enrichment analysis and constructing a circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network. The 
RNAenrich platform facilitated the identification of hub genes and potential 
druggable targets. The identified target was subjected to virtual screening 
against a chemical drug library comprising over 6000 compounds in clinical 
trials while ensuring compliance with Lipinski's Rule of Five. Our findings 
reveal that differentially expressed circRNAs are significantly involved in 
gland development, apoptosis regulation, hypoxic response, and neuronal death. 
Notably, CDK-6 emerged as the most promising druggable target, exhibiting strong 
binding affinity with five selected ligands: DB06963, DB06888, DB07020, DB08683, 
and DB06976. These ligands demonstrated distinct binding modes and stable 
interactions over 500 ns of molecular dynamics simulations conducted via 
Desmond. In conclusion, our study identifies CDK-6 as a viable target for 
therapeutic intervention in Alzheimer's disease. The top five ligands present a 
compelling case for further investigation as innovative CDK-6 inhibitors and 
potential drug candidates for AD treatment.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is marked by low neurotransmitter levels, inflammation, 
increased oxidative stress, and the aggregation of amyloid-β and tau proteins. 
The development of hybrid compounds acting as multi-target-directed ligands 
(MTDLs) is a novel and contemporary approach in Alzheimer's disease 
therapeutics. The objective of our current research focuses on identifying 
compounds with balanced, even moderate inhibition potential against multiple 
targets associated with cholinergic deficit and neuroinflammation. Inspired by 
our previous study, the thiazolidinedione-thiazole-based framework has been 
employed to design and synthesize a series of new hybrids. The inhibitory 
effects of the synthesized compounds on selected enzymes were investigated by 
employing in-vitro methods. The synergistic inhibition of acetylcholinesterase 
(AChE), monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B), β-secretase (BACE-1), cyclooxygenase-2 
(COX-2) and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) by compound 49 is believed to have a more 
potent effect in treating Alzheimer's disease. Enzyme kinetic studies and their 
effect on substrate-enzyme interactions of the compounds with significant 
inhibitory potency for AChE and MAO-B were also investigated. Central nervous 
system (CNS) penetration was determined using in-vitro PAMPA assay. A 
neurotoxicity test on neuroblastoma cell lines (SH-SY5Y) showed that the 
compounds were non-toxic. Compound 49 showed an excellent neuroprotective effect 
by significantly reducing H2O2-induced oxidative stress. Antioxidant enzymes 
were studied in an in-vivo experiment in the brains of male BALB/c mice. 
Compound 49 showed its ability to reduce the oxidative stress. Furthermore, 
molecular docking studies and 100 ns MD simulations performed on the AChE, 
MAO-B, and COX-2 ligand-protein complexes revealed stable conformations of the 
ligand-protein interactions throughout the simulations.

Alzheimer disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition. Thymoquinone (TQ) is a 
natural compound that possesses beneficial biological effects on the brain. The 
present study evaluates the protective impact of TQ on the cerebellum in rats 
with AlCl3-induced Alzheimer's disease. Four groups were utilized. Control: 20 
rats that were subdivided into two subgroups. Ia: received distilled water for 
4 weeks. Ib: received corn oil via oral gavage (1 ml/kg daily) for 4 weeks. TQ 
group: 10 rats received TQ in corn oil via oral gavage (20 mg/kg daily) for 
4 weeks. AD group:10 rats received AlCl3 in distilled water via oral gavage 
(300 mg/kg daily) for 4 weeks. AD & TQ group: 10 rats received both AlCl3 & TQ 
for 4 weeks. The grip period in the rotarod test decreased, escape latency in 
first three days and the entry latency period to the quadrant with the removed 
escape platform in the Morris water maze test increased in AD group, but when TQ 
was administered concurrently, there was a noteworthy improvement. Meanwhile, 
when compared to AD group, the addition of TQ showed a significant decrease 
(P < 0.05) in levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO), associated 
with a significant increase (P < 0.05) in reduced glutathione (GSH) level. 
Furthermore, AD & TQ group exhibited substantial preservation of the 
cerebellum's histological structure, the Purkinje cells number and transverse 
diameter showed a high significant increase (P < 0.001) and a significant 
increase (P < 0.05), respectively in comparison to the AD group. Using TQ showed 
improvement in behavioral tests, biochemical and histological findings. Thus, TQ 
might have therapeutic effects on Alzheimer's disease.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder that 
gradually destroys cognitive, memory, and thinking skills. Although increasing 
evidence has demonstrated that Ganoderma lucidum triterpenoids (GLT) can 
ameliorate the motor and spatial learning disorders of AD, the underlying 
mechanism remains unclear. Hence, in this study, GLT were obtained by using a 
traditional Chinese medicine processing method, and then the effects of GLT on 
motor and spatial learning disorders in 5xFAD mice were investigated by using 
various techniques such as behavioral analysis, micro-dialysis, and 
neurophysiological recording. Compared with the 5xFAD group, 0.5 g/kg GLT could 
decrease escape latency, the total number of limb errors, and the duration of 
errors. This dose could also increase the number of crossing the original 
platform, the total movement time, and the distance in the central region of the 
open-field box, as well as the maximum movement speed and continuous movement 
time on the rotating rod. After GLT treatment, the glutamate (Glu) content and 
variation coefficient of a simple spike of Purkinje cells decreased compared 
with the 5xFAD group, thereby improving the spatial learning and memory ability. 
Overall, this study shows that GLT may be a potential therapeutic method for 
patients with AD.

Synaptic degeneration has been linked to cognitive decline. The presynaptic 
protein, synaptosomal-associated protein 25 kDA (SNAP-25), is crucial for 
synaptic transmission and has been suggested as a biomarker in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). In the current study, we investigated the ability of SNAP-25 to 
differentiate between heterogenous dementia etiologies and whether SNAP-25 could 
be a staging marker in AD. SNAP-25 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from a 
retrospective (n = 187) and a prospective (n = 134) cohort was investigated with 
immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry (IP-MS) and single-molecule array (Simoa), 
respectively. Both cohorts consisted of healthy controls (HC) and patients with 
cognitive decline of different etiologies. CSF SNAP-25 concentration was higher 
in AD and non-neurodegenerative diseases (i.e., vascular dementia) compared with 
controls but did not differ between AD and non-AD neurodegenerative diseases. We 
found a trend toward an association between SNAP-25 and disease burden when 
comparing HC, mild cognitive impairment due to AD, and AD. CSF SNAP-25 
concentrations were strongly associated with CSF phosphorylated tau (p-tau) 
concentrations, thus strengthening the link between synaptic dysfunction and tau 
pathophysiology in AD. Our initial findings suggest that SNAP-25 may be a 
potential biomarker for differentiating AD from dementia due to other 
etiologies. However, due to the significant association between SNAP-25 and 
p-tau proteins, the clinical utility of SNAP-25 as a diagnostic biomarker for AD 
may be limited, while SNAP-25 may be useful for monitoring disease progression 
or treatment response.

BACKGROUND: Midlife women play a major role as the family caregivers of persons 
living with Alzheimer's disease (PLAD). Cultural differences are frequently the 
major reason for the high risk faced by racial and ethnic minority family 
caregivers. However, little is known about the characteristics of midlife women 
family caregivers that are linked to their negative attitudes toward Alzheimer's 
disease and dementia care.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the characteristics of midlife women 
who were family caregivers of PLAD that were linked to their negative attitudes 
toward Alzheimer's disease and dementia caregiving.
METHODS: A secondary data analysis was conducted using data from 172 midlife 
women who were family caregivers of PLAD and participated in a large 
cross-sectional online survey. Linear multiple regression analyses were used for 
the data analysis.
RESULTS: Participants' attitude toward Alzheimer's disease and related dementia 
scores were significantly associated with employment status, race/ethnicity 
(Hispanic), and instrumental activities of daily living. Those who were 
unemployed, Hispanic, and with low instrumental activities of daily living 
tended to have negative attitudes toward Alzheimer's disease and dementia care.
CONCLUSIONS: Additional interventions should be developed to improve attitudes 
toward caring for persons with Alzheimer's disease and dementia in this specific 
group of midlife women who are family caregivers of PLAD.

BACKGROUND: New amyloid-targeting monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapies for 
Alzheimer disease (AD) are currently under review by the Therapeutic Goods 
Administration for use in Australia.
AIMS: To determine the infrastructure, workforce and training needs of 
Australian memory and cognition clinics in order to characterise health system 
preparedness for these therapies.
METHODS: A national, cross-sectional online survey of medical specialists.
RESULTS: Thirty medical specialists (geriatricians, n = 23; psychiatrists, n 
= 4; neurologists, n = 3) from 30 different clinics participated (public, 76.7%; 
private, 23.3%), including from metropolitan (73.3%), regional (20.0%) and rural 
(6.7%) areas. On average, clinics reported assessing 5.4 (SD = 3.2) new patients 
per week, of which 2.4 (range: 0-5) were considered to have mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI). Only 40% of clinics use biomarkers to assess whether patients 
with MCI have AD, and 45% have intravenous infusion capability. While the 
majority of clinicians were confident in their knowledge of mAbs, only 33% felt 
confident in using these. Identified impediments to clinical implementation 
included (i) lack of real-world experience, (ii) lack of current Models of Care 
and appropriate use guidelines, (iii) current clinic set-up and (iv) information 
about safety.
CONCLUSIONS: Australia's health system preparedness for amyloid-targeting mAb 
therapies will require further investment in infrastructure, equity of access, 
clinician training and support. Long wait times already impact access to 
clinics, and with the forecast rise in MCI and dementia cases, services will 
need to be expanded, and appropriate Models of Care and clear and efficient 
inter-sector health pathways will be needed to prepare for the use of mAbs.

Introduction White matter tracts in the brain are essential for neurocognitive 
processes. Understanding their integrity is crucial for assessing both healthy 
and pathological brain states. Tractography based on diffusion tensor imaging 
(DTI) provides a non-invasive method to map and measure these pathways. The 
purpose of this study is to examine the 10 main white matter tracts in females 
aged 18 to 50, focusing on mean diffusivity (MD), volume, and fractional 
anisotropy (FA). Materials and methods Fifty-one healthy females aged 18-50 
years participated in the study, divided into three age groups: 18-30, 31-40, 
and 41-50 years. DTI scans were acquired using a Philips Multiva 1.5T MRI 
machine. The analyzed white matter tracts included the Inferior Fronto-occipital 
Fasciculus (IFOF), Superior Fronto-occipital Fasciculus (SFOF), Inferior 
Longitudinal Fasciculus (ILF), Superior Longitudinal Fasciculus (SLF), Cingulum, 
Corticospinal Tract (CST), Forceps Major, Forceps Minor, Uncinate Fasciculus, 
and Anterior Thalamic Radiation (ATR). Volume, FA, and MD were measured and 
statistically analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis Test. Results The analysis 
revealed no significant differences in most parameters across age groups. 
However, significant increases in MD for the SLF and Cingulum in the older age 
groups suggested potential age-related changes in these pathways. Despite these 
findings, many other tract parameters did not show statistically significant 
differences across age groups. Discussion The study highlights potential 
age-related deterioration in white matter, especially in the SLF and Cingulum, 
as indicated by higher MD in older age groups. This suggests that white matter 
may play a role in neurodegenerative processes and cognitive decline. The 
ability to identify subtle white matter alterations before clinical symptom 
onset underscores the value of DTI-based tractography in early identification of 
neurological disorders such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. Conclusion 
This study provides valuable insights into the age-related changes in white 
matter integrity in females aged 18-50, particularly with respect to MD 
increases in the SLF and Cingulum. The findings underscore the importance of DTI 
in clinical diagnostics and the early detection of neurodegenerative conditions. 
Further research with larger, more diverse samples is necessary to explore the 
influence of additional factors such as hormonal changes and lifestyle on white 
matter integrity across the lifespan.
