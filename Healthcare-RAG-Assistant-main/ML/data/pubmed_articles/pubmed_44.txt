Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a widespread neurodegenerative disorder and one of 
the major challenges for public health. Despite extensive research, the role of 
microglia in AD remains complex and dual. The aim of this review is to summarize 
the most recent advances in research regarding the dual role of microglia in AD 
concerning both immunomodulation and pathological progression by considering 
mechanisms of activation of microglia, effects on Aβ clearance, tau pathology, 
and impacts due to genetic variations on microglial functions. Among these 
findings are the dual role of microglia, the status of activation for M1 and M2 
phenotypes, and the crucial role that genetic variants like TREM2 have in 
modulating the response of microglia. This review describes how modulation of 
the microglial signaling pathway might be exploited therapeutically for AD 
treatment and underlines the relevance of a personalized medicine approach.

Forty-eight million people worldwide suffer from dementia, often associated with 
the growth of the elderly population. There are also concerns about the younger 
population, where increasing acute and chronic abuse of alcohol and neurotoxic 
substances may contribute to brain damage and the early onset of dementia. 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) accounts for 60% of dementia cases and most therapies 
used so far have been unsuccessful. Genetic, epigenetic and vascular factors 
contribute to the pathogenesis of AD. Among the epigenetic mechanisms, 
modulation of microRNA (miRs) plays an important role. To detect genes and 
pathways involved in AD, we performed an original bioinformatic analysis of 
published Alzheimer's dysregulated miRs using MIcroRNA ENrichment TURned NETwork 
(MIENTURNET) followed by Reactome tools. The interrogation of these platforms 
allowed us to discover common putative genes (by MIENTURNET) targeted by the 
dysregulated miRs and the pathways in which the set of altered genes are 
involved (by Reactome tool). Our in silico analysis showed that the β-catenin 
phosphorylation cascade and Netrin-1 signalling, resulted as the most 
significant. Lastly, based on the assumption that food bioactive compounds (BC) 
modulate miRs, which in turn modulate dysregulated genes and pathways associated 
with AD, a literature search demonstrated that some BC are indeed able to 
modulate dysregulated pathways and genes. Curcumin, osthole, puerarin, 
xanthoceraside, sulforaphane, salvianolic acid A, resveratrol and 
andrographolide lead to upregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Choline, 
methionine, folate and vitamin B6/B12 modulate the upregulation of the Netrin-1 
pathway. In conclusion, our in silico analysis of miRs identified dysregulated 
genes and their associated pathways, paving interesting and new insights for 
diagnosis and for potential therapeutic interventions.

AIMS: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) significantly increases the risk of 
dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD) and mixed 
dementia. Although sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have shown 
potential neuroprotective effects, previous studies were limited by small sample 
sizes, single-country datasets and a lack of detailed analyses of dementia 
subtypes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study utilized the TriNetX 
database, comprising de-identified electronic health records from over 100 
million patients across 98 healthcare organizations worldwide. Adults with T2DM 
initiating treatment with either SGLT2i or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors 
(DPP4i) between November 20, 2004, and November 20, 2024, were included. 
Propensity score matching (PSM) at a 1:1 ratio ensured balanced baseline 
characteristics. Primary outcomes included overall dementia and specific 
dementia subtypes (VaD, AD, other dementias), while secondary outcomes included 
all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: After 1:1 propensity score matching, 278 689 patients per group were 
analysed. SGLT2i use was associated with a lower incidence of overall dementia 
(2.9% vs. 6.7%; adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] 0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI], 
0.75-0.79) and a lower risk of vascular dementia (AHR 0.80), Alzheimer's disease 
(AHR 0.82) and other dementias (AHR 0.68). These associations remained 
consistent across age, sex, baseline glycaemic control and concurrent medication 
use in subgroup analyses. SGLT2i use was also linked to lower all-cause 
mortality (4.1% vs. 11.2%; AHR 0.66, 95% CI, 0.65-0.68). Findings were robust 
across sensitivity and subgroup analyses, supporting the potential 
neuroprotective effects of SGLT2i.
CONCLUSIONS: This large-scale observational study suggests that SGLT2i use is 
associated with lower risks of multiple dementia subtypes and all-cause 
mortality in patients with T2DM.

Mediterranean dietary patterns (MDP) may be neuroprotective. Using a large 
population-based cohort of 42,582 Swedish women, this study examined the 
association between MDP adherence and the risk of Parkinson's disease (PD), 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). During 
1991-1992, women in the Women's Lifestyle and Health Study reported dietary 
intake, and MDP adherence was calculated. Incident neurodegenerative diseases 
were identified using the Swedish National Patient Register through 2022. Women 
who reported high MDP adherence had a lower risk of PD (HR: 0.69, 95% CI: 
0.49-0.95), primarily over age 60 (HR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.47-0.97). A moderate-high 
MDP adherence was associated with a lower risk of ALS before age 60 (HR: 0.44, 
95% CI: 0.19-0.99), but not overall. We observed no association between MDP 
adherence and AD. Our findings suggest higher adherence to a MDP may be 
protective against PD above age 60, and ALS before age 60.

Purpurin, a naturally occurring compound found in certain plants, has 
demonstrated promising neuroprotective effects in the context of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). This study investigated the efficacy of purpurin in mitigating 
neurodegenerative changes induced by streptozotocin (3 mg/kg ICV) and amyloid 
beta (20 μM) in murine models. Neuroprotective effects were assessed through in 
vitro and in vivo experiments complemented by in silico simulation studies. 
SH-SY5Y cell viability, behavioral, biochemical, and histopathological studies 
were also conducted. The results revealed that purpurin interacts with 
acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and amyloid-beta (Aβ), exhibiting glide scores of 
- 10.72 and - 3.05 kcal/mol, respectively. Purpurin (8 μM) significantly 
alleviated Aβ-induced cellular damage by decreasing malondialdehyde production 
and enhancing superoxide dismutase and Thio barbituric acid reactive substances 
levels in a dose-dependent manner. Intraperitoneal administration of purpurin at 
50 mg/kg significantly improved both long-term and short-term memory and 
enhanced social interactions. These benefits were linked to the reductions in 
AChE activity and oxidative and inflammatory marker levels triggered by 
streptozotocin. Neuroprotective effects were also supported by restoring 
neuronal DNA content in the hippocampus, cerebellum and prefrontal cortex. 
Histological findings further corroborated the reduction in neurodegenerative 
marker levels. In silico simulations supported these findings by indicating that 
purpurin primarily binds to the Trp 286 and Tyr 341 residues of AChE, inhibiting 
its catalytic activity at the peripheral anionic site. In conclusion, the 
neuroprotective activity of purpurin in AD models is attributed to its 
inhibitory effects on AChE, coupled with reductions in inflammation and 
oxidative stress and the restoration of neuronal DNA integrity in critical brain 
regions.

Genetic engineering of microglial cells is a promising therapeutic avenue 
emerging with advancements in gene delivery techniques. Using a recently 
developed AAV capsid for efficient in vitro transduction we report the 
engineering of microglia with CARs (CAR-Mic) targeting phagocytosis of amyloid 
beta 1‒42 (Aβ42). Functional screening of seven CAR constructs in human 
iPSC-derived microglia revealed up to 6-fold increases in internalized Aβ 
relative to viral control. CAR-driven phagocytic enhancement was selective for 
Aβ, dependent on intracellular domain signaling, and was confirmed in primary 
mouse microglia. These findings highlight the potential of using this approach 
to target dysfunctional microglia in Alzheimer's disease and other CNS 
disorders.

Disease-modifying treatments for major neurocognitive disorders, including 
Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and other cognitive deficits, are among 
the main unmet needs in modern medicine. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor 
agonists (GLP-1RAs), currently licensed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes 
mellitus and obesity, offer a novel, multilayered mechanism for intervention in 
neurodegeneration through intermediate, aetiology-agnostic pathways, likely 
involving metabolic, inflammatory and several other relevant neurobiological 
processes. In vitro and animal studies have revealed promising signals of 
neuroprotection, with preliminary supportive evidence emerging from recent 
pharmacoepidemiological investigations and clinical trials. In this article, we 
comprehensively review studies that investigate the impact of GLP-1RAs on the 
various aetiologies of cognitive impairment and dementia syndromes. Focusing on 
evidence from human studies, we highlight how brain energy homeostasis, 
neurogenesis, synaptic functioning, neuroinflammation and other cellular stress 
responses, pathological protein aggregates, proteostasis, cerebrovascular system 
and blood-brain barrier dynamics may underlie GLP-1RA putative neuroprotective 
effects. We then report and appraise evidence from clinical studies, including 
observational investigations, clinical trials and pooled analyses. Finally, we 
discuss current challenges and perspectives ahead for research and clinical 
implementation of GLP-1RAs for the care of people with major neurocognitive 
disorders, including their individual brain penetrance potential, the need for 
response biomarkers and disease stage-based indications, their possible 
non-specific effects on brain health, their profile in terms of adverse events 
and other unwanted effects, the lack of long-term data for efficacy and safety, 
and issues surrounding cost and availability of treatment.

Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease are 3 prevalent 
neurodegenerative diseases. Beyond disparate disease incidences between men and 
women, additional sex-related differences exist. Disease presentation, natural 
course, treatment considerations, genetic factors, hormonal factors, health care 
utilization patterns, and outcomes can vary between men and women in general. 
These disease processes represent examples of well-defined discrepancies between 
men and women afflicted. Other neurodegenerative conditions, such as motor 
neuron disorders, progressive supranuclear palsy, and multisystem atrophy, have 
shown to have a slight predilection toward men compared to women, yet have not 
been as extensively studied.

BACKGROUND: Patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder have a life 
expectancy shorter than the general population. Cellular mechanisms underlying 
accelerated ageing, such as telomere shortening, may contribute to this 
premature mortality. We aimed to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the 
impact of pharmacological treatments for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder on 
telomere length.
METHOD: PRISMA/MOOSE systematic review and meta-analysis from inception to June 
2024. PubMed, Cochrane Library, SCOPUS, Web of Science, Embase and PsycInfo 
databases were searched for eligible studies. Methodological quality and risk of 
bias were evaluated with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and the Risk of Bias In 
Non-randomized Studies - of Exposure (ROBINS-E) respectively.
RESULTS: An initial search retrieved 2133 articles. However, only 28 studies 
were finally included in qualitative synthesis and 19 in meta-analysis. All 
studies identified in the review were observational. Random-effects model 
analysis was used to quantify the difference in telomere length between cohorts 
of patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and healthy control groups. 
The meta-analysis confirmed that telomere length was shorter in patients with 
schizophrenia (SMD = 0.35, 95 % CI 0.11 to 0.60; p=<0.0001) and bipolar disorder 
(SMD = 0.18, 95 % CI -0.04 to 0.39 p=<0.0001) than in healthy controls. This 
difference was not modified by predominant treatment with either lithium 
(SMD = 0.37, 95 % CI 0.04 to 0.69; p=<0.0001) or antipsychotics (SMD = 0.20, 
95 % CI 0.02 to 0.38; p=<0.0001) at cohort level across studies.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder have shorter 
telomeres than healthy populations. Predominant treatment with lithium or 
antipsychotics at cohort level did not have an impact on such shortening 
difference.

In this study, nine novel carvacrol/thymol derivatives incorporating carbamate 
groups were designed, synthesized, and evaluated as multifunctional anti-AD 
agents. These derivatives displayed superior BuChE inhibitory and 
anti-inflammatory characteristics compared to the parent compounds. While the 
derivatives exhibited AChE IC50 values exceeding the detectable limit (>100 μM), 
they demonstrated high potency as BuChE inhibitors, with IC50 values ranging 
from 0.05 to 9.62 μM. In an inflammation model of BV2 microglial cells induced 
by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the derivatives effectively reduced the levels of 
the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL1β), with inhibition rates of 
IL1β exceeding 50 % at 10 μM. Notably, compound SXF3 ‌attained the highest BuChE 
inhibition efficacy (eqBuChE IC50 = 0.05 ± 0.003 μM, hBuChE 
IC50 = 0.04 ± 0.001 μM), the highest selectivity for BuChE (with a selectivity 
index, SI, exceeding 2000, calculated as the ratio of eeAChE IC50 to eqBuChE 
IC50) and high anti-inflammatory activity (inhibition of IL1β, 
IC50 = 8.33 ± 0.08 μM). In a scopolamine-induced AD mouse model, SXF3 (15 mg/kg) 
significantly reduced the latency to the platform and attenuated memory 
deficits. Biochemical analysis confirmed that SXF3 significantly increased 
acetylcholine (ACh) levels in the mice hippocampus, primarily due to the 
inhibition of BuChE rather than AChE, and that SXF3 significantly reduced IL1β 
levels to normal, further confirming its anti-inflammatory activities. Hence, 
the selective BuChE inhibitory properties and anti-inflammatory attributes of 
SXF3 render it a promising candidate for further investigation in the treatment 
of AD.

The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is a ubiquitous physiological system that plays 
a crucial role in maintaining CNS homeostasis and regulating its functions. It 
includes cannabinoid receptors (CBRs), endogenous cannabinoids (eCBs), and the 
enzymes responsible for their synthesis and degradation. In recent years, 
growing evidence has highlighted the therapeutic potential of the ECS and CBRs, 
in a wide range of severe diseases and pathological conditions, including 
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Multiple 
Sclerosis, Huntington's Disease, HIV-1 associated neurocognitive disorders, 
neuropathic pain and migraine. Targeting the cannabinoid type 2 receptor (CB2R) 
has gained attention due to its ability to (i) mitigate neuroinflammatory 
responses, (ii) regulate mitochondrial function and (iii) provide trophic 
support, all without eliciting the psychotropic actions associated with CB1R 
activation. This review aims to explore the potential of CB2R modulation as a 
strategy for the prevention and treatment of neurologic disorders, exploring 
both preclinical and clinical findings.

BACKGROUND: Digital technology in dementia is an area of great development with 
varying experiences across countries. However, novel digital solutions often 
lack a patient-oriented perspective, and several relevant barriers prevent their 
use in clinics.
OBJECTIVE: In this study, we reviewed the existing literature on knowledge, 
familiarity, and competence in using digital technology and on attitude and 
experiences with digital tools in Alzheimer disease. The main research question 
is whether digital competence and attitudes of patients and caregivers may 
affect the adoption of digital technology.
METHODS: Following the PRISMA guidelines, a literature search was conducted by 
two researchers in the group. Inter-rater reliability was calculated with Cohen 
κ statistics. The risk of bias assessment was also recorded.
RESULTS: Of 597 initial records, only 18 papers were considered eligible. 
Analyses of inter-rater reliability showed good agreement levels. Significant 
heterogeneity in study design, sample features, and measurement tools emerged 
across studies. Quality assessment showed a middle-high overall quality of 
evidence. The main factors affecting the adoption of digital technology in 
patients and caregivers are severity of cognitive deficits, timing of adoption, 
and the availability of training and support. Additional factors are age, type 
of digital device, and ease of use of the digital solution.
CONCLUSIONS: Adoption of digital technology in dementia is hampered by many 
patient-related barriers. Improving digital competence in patient-caregiver 
dyads and implementing systematic, patient-oriented strategies for the 
development and use of digital tools are needed for a successful incorporation 
of digital technology in memory clinics.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic, progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
that predominantly affects the elderly. Characterized by amyloid-beta (Aβ) 
plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, AD leads to memory loss, cognitive decline, 
and severe behavioral changes. As the most common form of dementia, AD imposes a 
significant global health burden, highlighting the need for interventions that 
address underlying disease mechanisms rather than only symptomatic treatment. 
Glial cells, including microglia and astrocytes, play a crucial role in AD 
progression by mediating neuroinflammatory responses and modulating Aβ clearance 
and neuronal health. Dysfunction in these cells can exacerbate neuroinflammation 
and neuronal damage, making glial cells an important target for therapeutic 
intervention. This review synthesizes findings from in vivo and in vitro studies 
on melatonin's effects on glial cell dysfunction in AD, emphasizing the 
multi-mechanistic nature of its neuroprotective properties. Recent studies 
highlight melatonin's potential as a therapeutic agent that addresses AD-related 
mechanisms through its interactions with glial cells. Melatonin has demonstrated 
protective effects, including reducing oxidative stress, apoptosis, and 
inflammation, inhibiting Aβ fibrillogenesis, and modulating amyloid precursor 
proteins. Additionally, its influence on glial cell activity, through melatonin 
receptor pathways, suggests it can alleviate neuroinflammation, a key component 
of AD progression. The collective evidence points to melatonin's promise as a 
therapeutic tool with potential roles in both preventive and adjunctive 
treatments for AD. However, further research is necessary to establish its 
efficacy and safety in clinical settings.

Alzheimer's Disease is a chronic progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by impaired intellect and cognitive functions. Beta-site amyloid 
precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) plays a pivotal role in the 
pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by initiating the amyloid cascade. 
Despite significant clinical efforts, most BACE1 inhibitors have failed to yield 
potent pharmacological effects. Our previous study, identified a group of 
natural compounds with satisfying pharmacological profiles with high affinity to 
BACE1, out of which the compound, 'convolidine' emerged as the most promising 
candidate based on the in-silico parameters such as docking score, interacting 
residues, binding energy, drug-likeness, ADMET, and biological activity 
prediction. The present study focused on the inhibitory potential of convolidine 
against BACE1 using dynamics simulation followed by protein-protein docking and 
in-vitro validation. Molecular dynamics simulation demonstrated that the 
BACE1-convolidine complex remained stable throughout the entire 200 ns 
simulation period. Also, the results of the post-dynamic docking study showed a 
reduced substrate affinity of BACE1 to its substrate, APP (Amyloid precursor 
protein), when BACE1 is bound to convolidine, suggesting compounds inhibitory 
potential. This in-silico assessment was validated in-vitro using a FRET-based 
BACE1 activity assay, where the result well aligned with the computational 
predictions. The findings revealed that convolidine could effectively inhibit 
BACE1, with an IC50 value of 0.49 µM, providing a solid foundation for its 
development as a promising therapeutic agent for AD management.

BACKGROUND: Measuring ataxia severity is primarily conducted in-person using 
tests such as the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA). However, 
given the motor and cognitive impairments of people with cerebellar ataxia 
(PwA), there are major limitations in ensuring the assessment is accessible and 
scalable. We aimed to develop and validate a novel test, enabling the remote 
assessment of ataxia severity, SARA-Le (SARA Live e-version).
METHODS: SARA-Le is a structured step-by-step test for administering the SARA 
through video conferencing. In two experiments, we administered SARA-Le to 106 
PwA. In Experiment 1 (n = 23), we assessed concurrent validity by comparing 
SARA-Le and in-person SARA scores administered by an independent neurologist. In 
addition, we evaluated associations between nine gait measures and both SARA and 
SARA-Le scores. In Experiment 2 (n = 83), we assessed the efficacy, internal 
consistency, and correlations between SARA-Le and other related measures.
RESULTS: First, we found a high correlation (r = 0.89, P = 0.001) between 
SARA-Le and in-person SARA scores, supporting convergent validity. Second, 
SARA-Le and SARA scores were both similarly associated with the nine gait 
measures, supporting construct validity. Third, SARA-Le's Cronbach's alpha was 
very high (0.831), supporting internal consistency. Fourth, SARA-Le scores 
exhibited a positive correlation with disease duration (r = 0.44, P < 0.001), 
and a negative correlation with MoCA scores (r = - 0.27, P = 0.007), supporting 
construct validity.
CONCLUSIONS: SARA-Le can serve as a remote technology-based protocol, improving 
the accessibility and scalability of ataxia severity evaluation.

BACKGROUND: Neurological disorders represent a significant global health issue, 
leading to severe cognitive impairments and being a major cause of premature 
mortality and disability. This study aims to utilize data from the Global Burden 
of Disease (GBD) research website to assess the burden of neurological disorders 
in the Asian region and its individual countries and territory from 1990 to 
2021, with the goal of providing reference for global efforts and 
decision-making in the prevention, treatment, and management of neurological 
disorders.
METHODS: Based on the Global Burden of Disease data, this study assessed the 
incidence, prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of 
13 neurological disorders in the Asian region from 1990 to 2021. The 
epidemiological characteristics of neurological disorders across these Asian 
regions were analyzed. Joinpoint regression analysis was employed to assess the 
temporal patterns of the burden of neurological disorders, and the average 
annual percent change (AAPC) was calculated to determine the overall trend 
throughout the study period.
RESULTS: In 2021, stroke, migraine, and Alzheimer's disease and other dementias 
emerged as the primary contributors to neurological burden in Asia, with stroke 
accounting for 112.87 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), followed 
by migraine (25.4 million) and Alzheimer's disease and other dementias (20.0 
million). Stroke was also the leading cause of neurological mortality (5.03 
million deaths), trailed by Alzheimer's disease and other dementias (1.0 
million). Stroke, migraine, and tension-type headache had the highest prevalence 
rates among neurological disorders, with 57.3 million, 683.5 million, and 1130.2 
million. Temporal trends from 1990 to 2021 revealed a significant decline in 
age-standardized DALY rates for stroke (estimated annual percentage change 
[EAPC]: - 1.65%), though absolute DALYs increased (EAPC: 0.06%). In contrast, 
Alzheimer's disease and other dementias exhibited rising age-standardized (EAPC: 
0.14%) and absolute DALYs (EAPC: 2.8%), while infectious neurological diseases 
(e.g., meningitis, tetanus) demonstrated marked reductions in burden. 
Sex-specific disparities were evident, with males experiencing a higher total 
DALY burden (84.8 million vs. 77.05 million), driven by stroke and Parkinson's 
disease, whereas Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and migraine 
disproportionately affected females. Geographically, stroke dominated Southeast 
Asia (67.6% of regional DALYs), while migraine contributed most substantially to 
West Asia (16%). Nationally, stroke ranked as the leading cause of neurological 
DALYs in most Asian countries, contrasting with migraine in Israel, Kuwait, 
Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. Longitudinal analyses highlighted 
accelerated declines in stroke DALYs post- 2004 but escalating burdens for 
Alzheimer's disease and other dementias after 2019, reflecting divergent 
epidemiological trajectories.
CONCLUSIONS: In 2021, the burden of neurological disorders in Asia remained 
substantial, with stroke, migraine, and Alzheimer's disease and other dementias 
being the top three contributors to DALYs. The study also revealed significant 
differences in the burden of neurological disorders across various subregions 
and countries in Asia, highlighting the need for enhanced international 
collaboration, sharing of best practices, provision of technical support, and 
optimization of healthcare resource allocation.

Circadian disruptions and neuroinflammation impact nearly all people with 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), but their relationships with each other and the impact 
of their interaction on AD remain to be addressed. Here, we found that amyloid 
(A)-β treatment downregulated brain and muscle aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear 
translocator-like (BMAL) 1 through the hypermethylation of its promoter region 
in HT22 cells and that the inhibition of DNA methylation ameliorated circadian 
rhythm disorders and restored BMAL1 protein expression by reversing its 
hypermethylation in APPswe/PSEN1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice. Critically, increased levels 
of interleukin (IL)-17A contributed to BMAL1 downregulation through the 
hypermethylation of its promoter region, thus leading to circadian disruptions 
in APP/PS1 mice. Moreover, we revealed that the mitogen-activated protein kinase 
(MAPK) pathway was responsible for IL-17A-induced DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) 1 
upregulation. Taken together, we elucidate a new mechanism connecting IL-17A 
with altered DNA methylation of Bmal1, which results in circadian disturbances 
in an AD mouse model.

This review provides a comprehensive account of advances in the field of 
cholinesterase inhibitors isolated from the Buxaceae family. Naturally occurring 
anticholinesterases derived from plants are considered to be a potential source 
of new drug candidates for treating Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is now 
universally accepted as an irreversible, incurable, and progressive neurological 
disorder. Initiating with memory impairment, propagating with cognitive deficit, 
and ultimately leading to death is the general pathway of AD. Lower level of 
acetylcholine in the brain is characterized as one of the prominent reasons for 
AD. The cholinergic hypothesis states that elevated levels of acetylcholine in 
the brain can alleviate symptoms of AD. Steroidal and terpenoidal alkaloids 
isolated from plants of the Buxaceae family have been reviewed here for their 
anticholinesterase activity. Most of them have shown in vitro inhibition of 
horse serum butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE, EC 3.1.1.7) and electric eel 
acetylcholinesterase (AChE, EC 3.1.1.8). Although the general consensus has 
concluded that cholinesterase inhibitors may alleviate AD symptoms but cannot 
cure the disease, new drugs are still being sought to improve the quality of 
life of AD patients. Steroidal and terpenoidal anticholinesterase alkaloids can 
prove to be a promising group of AChE inhibitors.

AIMS: This study aims to explore the potential association between 
nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) in 
oligodendrocytes and Alzheimer's disease (AD), utilizing a combination of 
bioinformatics analysis and molecular biology experiments to validate this 
relationship.
METHODS: Public datasets related to AD were systematically retrieved and 
downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database at the National 
Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Subsequently, the SVA package was 
employed to merge the data and eliminate batch effects, allowing for the precise 
identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between AD patients and 
healthy controls. Advanced machine learning techniques, including LASSO 
regression analysis, random forest algorithms, and support vector machines 
(SVM), were utilized to analyze further the DEGs associated with the NLRP3 
inflammasome to determine the gene set most closely related to AD. The 
effectiveness and clinical value of the gene-based diagnostic model were 
comprehensively assessed through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve 
analysis, nomogram construction, and decision curve analysis (DCA). Immune 
infiltration analysis evaluated the extent of various immune cell infiltrations 
in the brain tissue of AD patients. Single-cell transcriptomics and in vitro 
experiments were conducted to verify the molecular expression of NLRP3 in 
oligodendrocytes within the AD model.
RESULTS: A total of 11 significant DEGs were identified, with 4 genes showing 
downregulation and 7 genes exhibiting upregulation. All three algorithms-LASSO 
regression, random forest, and SVM-consistently identified PANX1, APP, P2RX7, 
MEFV, and NLRP3 as key genes closely associated with AD. ROC curve analysis, 
nomogram modeling, and DCA results demonstrated that the diagnostic model 
constructed based on these five genes exhibited high diagnostic accuracy and 
clinical applicability. Immune infiltration analysis revealed a significant 
correlation between key genes associated with AD and various immune cells, 
particularly CD8+ T cells, monocytes, activated NK cells, and neutrophils, 
suggesting that these cells may play important roles in the immunopathological 
process of AD. Single-cell transcriptomics indicated that the expression level 
of NLRP3 in oligodendrocytes was higher in the AD group compared to the control 
group (p < 0.05). Additionally, in vitro cell experiments using Reverse 
transcription quantitative PCR(RT-qPCR), immunofluorescence (IF), and Western 
blot (WB) analysis confirmed that the expression level of NLRP3 in 
oligodendrocytes was elevated in the AD model relative to the control group (p < 
0.05).
CONCLUSION: This study corroborates the high expression of NLRP3 in AD and its 
close relationship with the disease through integrated bioinformatics analysis 
and molecular biology experiments. Furthermore, the diagnostic model constructed 
based on the five key genes-PANX1, APP, P2RX7, MEFV, and NLRP3-not only provides 
a robust tool for early diagnosis of AD but also offers new insights for the 
development of treatment targets for AD.

The neuroinflammatory aspect of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been largely 
focused on microglia, the innate immune cells of the brain; however, recent 
evidence increasingly points to the importance of multiple alterations in the 
systemic immune response during disease development. Natural killer (NK) cells 
are also components of innate immunity, whose role in AD pathogenesis has been 
sporadically investigated and often conflicting results have been reported. 
Recent clinical trial has suggested the potential beneficial effects of AD 
immunotherapy based on ex vivo-expanded, genetically unmodified, NK cells. This 
has led to increased interest in understanding the function of these cells in 
the central nervous system in both physiological and pathological contexts such 
as AD. Considering that AD is predominantly a disease of the elderly population, 
in this review, we summarized the current state of knowledge on the 
physiological changes that occur in the NK cell compartment during the normal 
aging process and the pathophysiological alterations that occur throughout the 
AD continuum that could potentially explain the therapeutic efficacy of these 
cells.

BackgroundPeople with Alzheimer's disease (AD) now have access to 
disease-modifying treatment with anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). 
Their perception of risks and benefits and approach to treatment decisions 
remain unknown.ObjectiveWe aimed to understand how people with AD weigh the 
benefits and costs of anti amyloid mAbs and incorporate these into decisions 
about treatment.MethodsWe conducted semi-structured interviews with people with 
biomarker- or imaging-confirmed AD and mild or moderate cognitive impairment who 
were seen at memory care clinics and discussed lecanemab with a clinician. 
Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and deidentified. Thematic analysis 
identified themes and subthemes.ResultsAmong 22 participants (mean age 70, 8 
[36%] women, 22 [100%] White), analysis revealed 3 major themes and associated 
subthemes: (1) People with AD sought and obtained information from different 
sources-advocacy organizations, the Internet, and clinicians; (2) Hopes, 
expected benefits, and the existential threat of dementia drove willingness and 
readiness to start lecanemab; (3) Individual traits, family factors, and degree 
of trust in expertise influenced how people balanced risks and benefits. Some 
would accept treatment at any cost; others carefully weighed risks and burdens, 
but were motivated by supportive families, insurance coverage, and trust in 
expertise; for a few, costs decidedly outweighed their personal benefits. People 
with AD desired more individualized information and to hear more from patients 
who took the medication.ConclusionsResults from this first qualitative study of 
people with AD considering treatment with anti-amyloid mAbs can inform 
clinician, health system and policy efforts to individualize decisions.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) is exacerbated by 
social isolation. One potential intervention for improving the health outcomes 
of individuals with ADRD is by providing opportunities for socialization that 
are highly engaging.
METHODS: To identify strategies for enhancing social engagement, we studied 
recorded virtual group sessions of older adults aged ≥ 65, with mild to moderate 
ADRD who interacted with younger adult facilitators. We developed multivariate 
regression models that use data describing group behavior, activity, and 
composition to predict enhanced engagement.
RESULTS: We identified predictors of enhanced engagement related to group 
composition, structure, leadership, and mode of delivery. These results inform 
strategies for designing group settings which maximize engagement by using the 
synergistic influence of whole social groups on individuals.
DISCUSSION: We make evidence-based treatment recommendations for facilitators 
seeking to maximize engagement and make recommendations for future research 
investigating the preservation or loss of social engagement.
HIGHLIGHTS: Social isolation is a major contributing factor to the development 
of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Virtual socialization can help 
mitigate lack of opportunity for social contact. Audio-video data describing 
group activity were used to predict social engagement. Group size, behavior, 
composition, and time spoken contributed to social engagement. Experienced group 
facilitators maximized engagement by supporting conversation.

INTRODUCTION: β-synuclein is a promising blood marker to track synaptic 
degeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) but changes in preclinical AD are 
unclear.
METHODS: We investigated serum β-synuclein in 69 cognitively unimpaired mutation 
non-carriers, 78 cognitively unimpaired AD mutation carriers (asymptomatic AD), 
and 31 symptomatic mutation carriers from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer 
Network.
RESULTS: β-synuclein levels were already higher in asymptomatic AD mutation 
carriers compared to non-carriers and highest in symptomatic carriers. 
Longitudinal trajectories and correlation analyses indicated that β-synuclein 
levels start to rise after amyloid deposition preceding axonal degeneration, 
brain atrophy and hypometabolism, and cognitive decline. β-synuclein levels were 
associated with cognitive impairment and gradually increased with declining 
cognition.
DISCUSSION: Our study supports the use of blood β-synuclein to track synaptic 
changes in preclinical AD and as a surrogate marker for cognitive impairment 
which might be used in early diagnosis and to support patient selection and 
monitoring of treatment effects in clinical trials.
HIGHLIGHTS: Blood β-synuclein levels were already higher in asymptomatic 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) mutation carriers. Blood β-synuclein levels were 
highest in symptomatic AD mutation carriers. Blood β-synuclein levels start to 
rise 11 years before symptom onset. Rise of β-synuclein precedes axonal 
degeneration, brain atrophy, and cognitive decline. β-synuclein levels gradually 
increased with declining cognition.

INTRODUCTION: Whether reductions in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels and body 
mass index (BMI) mediate the association between glucagon-like peptide-1 
receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias 
(ADRD) risk is unknown.
METHODS: This cohort study included 22,908 patients aged ≥ 50 years with type 2 
diabetes (T2D) newly prescribed GLP-1RA or other second-line glucose-lowering 
drugs (GLDs). Causal mediation analysis was used to estimate to what extent the 
effect of GLP-1RAs on ADRD risk was attributable to lowering HbA1c or BMI.
RESULTS: Compared to other GLD users, GLP-1RA users had significant reductions 
in HbA1c levels by 0.16% and BMI by 0.23 kg/m2, along with a 26% lower ADRD 
risk. The direct protective effect of GLP-1RAs on ADRD risk persisted even after 
accounting for HbA1c and BMI reductions, with minimal mediation effects observed 
through these factors.
DISCUSSION: GLP-1RAs reduce ADRD risk, largely independent of their effects on 
HbA1c and BMI.
HIGHLIGHTS: Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) were associated 
with reductions in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and body mass index (BMI) 
compared to other second-line glucose-lowering drugs(GLDs). GLP-1RA users were 
associated with a 26% lower risk of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias 
(ADRD) than other GLD users. The protective effect of GLP-1RAs against ADRD in 
adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) is largely independent of their effects on 
HbA1c and BMI.

Caenorhabditis elegans has been widely used as a model organism in 
neurodevelopment for several decades due to its simplicity, rapid growth, short 
life cycle, transparency, and rather simple genetics. It has been useful in 
modeling neurodegenerative diseases by the heterologous expression of the major 
proteins that form neurodegenerative-linked aggregates such as amyloid-β 
peptide, tau protein, and α-synuclein, among others. Furthermore, chemical 
treatments as well as the existence of several interference RNA libraries, 
transgenic worm lines, and the possibility of generating new transgenic strains 
create a magnificent range of possible tools to study the signaling pathways 
that could confer protection against protein aggregates or, on the contrary, are 
playing a detrimental role. In this review, we summarize the different C. 
elegans models of neurodegenerative diseases with a focus on Alzheimer's and 
Parkinson's diseases and how genetic tools could be used to dissect the 
signaling pathways involved in their pathogenesis mentioning several examples. 
Finally, we discuss the use of pharmacological agents in C. elegans models that 
could help to study these disease-associated signaling pathways and the powerful 
combinations of experimental designs with genetic tools. This review highlights 
the advantages of C. elegans as a valuable intermediary between in vitro and 
mammalian in vivo models in the development of potential new therapies.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a typical neurodegenerative disease that 
presents challenges due to the lack of biomarkers to identify AD. A growing body 
of evidence highlights the critical role of circadian rhythms in AD.
METHODS: The differentially expressed clock genes (DECGs) were identified 
between AD and ND groups (non-demented controls). Functional enrichment analysis 
was executed on the DECGs. Candidate diagnostic biomarkers for AD were screened 
by machine learning. ROC and nomograms were constructed to evaluate candidate 
biomarkers. In addition, therapeutics targeting predictive biomarkers were 
screened through the DGIdb website. Finally, the mRNA-miRNA network was 
constructed.
RESULTS: Nine genes were identified through the DECG analysis between the AD and 
ND groups. Enrichment analysis of nine genes indicated that the pathways were 
enriched in long-term potentiation and circadian entrainment. Four clock genes 
(GSTM3, ERC2, PRKCG, and HLA-DMA) of AD were screened using Lasso regression, 
random forest, SVM, and GMM. The diagnostic performance of four genes was 
evaluated by the ROC curve. Furthermore, the nomogram indicated that ERC2, 
PRKCG, and HLA-DMA are good biomarkers in diagnosing AD. Single-gene GSEA 
indicated that the main enrichment pathways were oxidative phosphorylation, 
pathways of neurodegeneration-multiple diseases, etc. The results of immune cell 
infiltration analysis indicated that there were significant differences in 15 
immune cell subsets between AD and ND groups. Moreover, 23 drugs targeting 
HLA-DMA and 8 drugs targeting PRKCG were identified through the DGIdb website.
CONCLUSION: We identified three predictive biomarkers for AD associated with 
clock genes, thus providing promising therapeutic targets for AD.

INTRODUCTION: Parkinson disease psychosis (PDP) is a common complication of PD. 
Until 2016, the only drugs available to treat PDP in the U.S. were 
antipsychotics with variable degrees of dopamine-receptor antagonism (DRA) that 
may worsen PD motor symptoms. We evaluated the impact that pimavanserin, a 
selective serotonin receptor inverse agonist/antagonist atypical antipsychotic 
(AAP) with no known DRA, had on PDP treatment practices in a commercially 
insured population.
METHODS: We included adults diagnosed with PD who filled at least one AAP 
prescription from 2016 to 2022. AAP dispensings were categorized into (1) 
pimavanserin, (2) clozapine and quetiapine (i.e., PDP-"preferred" mixed receptor 
antagonist AAPs), and (3) the remaining AAPs (i.e., PDP-"nonpreferred" mixed 
receptor antagonist AAPs). Trends in quarterly dispensing rates per 1000 persons 
treated were compared across categories. Secondary analyses focused on the 
65+ subpopulations insured by Medicare Advantage programs.
RESULTS: Dispensing rates varied between 4 and 697/1000 persons treated for 
pimavanserin, 1434-1821 for preferred, and 394-746 for nonpreferred AAPs. 
Pimavanserin dispensings surpassed the nonpreferred category after quarter 3 of 
2018. However, preferred AAPs, particularly quetiapine, remained the most 
dispensed category in the sixth year after pimavanserin's approval. We observed 
similar trends among Medicare Advantage enrollees.
CONCLUSION: The availability of pimavanserin was followed by a decline in the 
use of the most harmful AAPs in persons living with PD. Quetiapine remained the 
most prescribed AAP. Comparative safety and effectiveness studies are needed to 
define the relative risks and benefits of treatment options in PDP.

Bee venom is a traditional remedy used to treat conditions related to the 
nervous and musculoskeletal systems, as well as autoimmune diseases. Recently, 
we developed a new composition bee venom (NCBV), a fortified content of bee 
venom phospholipase A2 (bvPLA2), which may be effective in the treatment of 
Alzheimer's disease. NCBV is currently preparing to conduct a phase 1 clinical 
trial, and this study aimed to predict the first-in-human (FIH) dose using a 
mechanistic approach. First, animal pharmacokinetic (PK) studies from three 
different species were explored and integrated to build a PK model using 
nonlinear mixed-effect modeling. The final models were described by 
two-compartment model with first order absorption and elimination, and were used 
to define the PK parameters for each species. To predict human PK parameters, 
simple, brain weight (BrW) or maximum lifespan potential (MLP) incorporated 
allometric scaling approaches were used, with the BrW method showing the highest 
correlation (R2 = 0.974). The initial FIH dose was back-calculated based on the 
area under the concentration-time curve of 0.397 μg·h/mL after the injection of 
an efficacious dose of 0.1 mg/kg in mice using the developed PK model. The 
predicted initial doses for a 70 kg human were 5.5, 1.3, and 3.5 mg, when using 
the simple, BrW, and MLP incorporated model, respectively. A subcutaneous FIH 
dose of 1.3 mg NCBV was ultimately recommended for a 70-kg human. Based on the 
no observed adverse effect level, the suggested FIH dose ranges for NCBV are 0.1 
to 3 mg, which correspond with our proposed dose.

Permutations of cerebrovascular pathologies (CVP) in persons with diabetes 
mellitus (DM) have not been comprehensively investigated. Here, we examine 
diverse postmortem CVP outcomes, including permutations of single or mixed CVP, 
in 2163 older adults with or without DM who were followed in longitudinal 
studies of aging. Annual clinical evaluations included data to classify DM 
status by medical history (DM diagnosis), direct medication inspection 
(anti-diabetic therapy), and hemoglobin A1C level (≥6.5 %). Upon death, 
neuropathological examinations were performed and included evaluation for CVP 
(considering vessel pathologies and brain infarcts) and Alzheimer's disease 
neuropathologic change (AD-NC). Among all participants [mean age, 89.49 ± 6.89 
years (SD)], single CVP were more common than mixed CVP. Logistic regression was 
used to analyze the association of DM with CVP permutations, controlling for age 
at death, sex, education, and AD-NC, and revealed increased odds of 
microinfarcts alone (odds ratio, 1.56 [95 %CI, 1.03-2.35]) and mixed 
microinfarcts and macroinfarcts (odds ratio, 1.90 [95 %CI, 1.16-3.13]). These 
associations remained after adjusting for demographic factors and cohort or 
vascular comorbidities including stroke, heart disease, hypertension, 
claudication, smoking, and systolic blood pressure. Furthermore, after 
controlling for demographic factors as well as AD-NC and APOE type, mixed 
microinfarcts and macroinfarcts were associated with approximate threefold 
increased risk of dementia (odds ratio, 2.95 [95 %CI, 1.13-7.70]) in 
participants with DM. Evidence suggests that older adults living with DM have 
higher odds of microinfarcts and mixed microinfarcts and macroinfarcts in the 
absence of intracranial vessel pathologies that cannot be explained by vascular 
comorbidities, and in this population mixed microinfarcts and macroinfarcts are 
associated with higher odds of dementia.

Tau, a microtubule-binding protein linked to tauopathies like Alzheimer's 
disease and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), has 3-repeat (3R) and 
4-repeat (4R) isoforms. Accumulation of the 4R-tau is associated with FTLD, 
progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and cortico-basal degeneration (CBD). We 
previously showed that a loss of fused in sarcoma (FUS) or splicing factor, 
proline- and glutamine-rich (SFPQ) promoted 4R-tau accumulation, which induced 
FTLD-like behaviors and neurodegeneration in mice. Here, we developed antisense 
oligonucleotides (ASOs) modified with 2'-O, 4'-C-ethylene-bridged nucleic acids 
(ENAs), reducing the 4R-tau/3R-tau ratio while maintaining total tau expression 
from the MAPT gene. In vitro screening identified EN-06 as the most effective 
ENA. Intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of EN-06 corrected the 
4R/3R-tau ratio in FUS-silenced humanized tau mice and human iPSC-derived 
neurons. This treatment ameliorated disease phenotypes, including aberrant 
behaviors, spine dysmorphology, and neurodegeneration. The half-life of EN-06 
after a single ICV administration was approximately 6 months in the brain, with 
splicing correction effects that persisted for 2 years. The efficacy of EN-06 
was higher than that of 2'-O-methoxyethyl (MOE)-modified ASO (MO-06). These 
findings highlight the potential of ENA-modified ASOs to reduce 4R-tau while 
preserving total MAPT expression, thus offering a safe and long-acting treatment 
for 4R-tau-associated tauopathies.

In the intricate realm of interactions between hosts and pathogens, Toll-like 
receptors (TLRs), which play a crucial role in the innate immune response, 
possess the ability to identify specific molecular signatures. This includes 
components originating from pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2, as well as the 
resulting damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), the endogenous molecules 
released after cellular damage. A developing perspective suggests that TLRs play 
a central role in neuroinflammation, a fundamental factor in neurodegenerative 
conditions like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease (PD). This comprehensive 
review consolidates current research investigating the potential interplay 
between TLRs, their signaling mechanisms, and the processes of neurodegeneration 
following SARS-CoV-2 infection with an aim to elucidate the involvement of TLRs 
in the long-term neurological complications of COVID-19 and explore the 
potential of targeting TLRs as a means of implementing intervention strategies 
for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19-associated long-term brain outcomes.

[Recommendations for the disease-modifying treatments of early Alzheimer's 
disease].

[Article in Chinese; Abstract available in Chinese from the publisher]

Expert Consensus Review Committee on Disease-Modifying Treatments for Early 
Alzheimer′s Disease.

Monoclonal antibodies targeting β-amyloid (Aβ)(represented by Lecanemab) have 
been approved in the United States, Japan and China for the treatment of mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild AD dementia, 
and AD treatment has moved towards the era of disease modifying therapy (DMT). 
In view of the lack of use experience with DMT in China, this article presents 
recommendations for Aβ-based DMT clinical practice based on its clinical 
evidence, as well as its existing usage experience and research regarding AD. 
These recommendations include the mechanism of action, patient selection, 
standardized use, effectiveness, and safety monitoring, intending to help guide 
the rational use in real-world clinical practice.

Global implementation of blood tests for Alzheimer's disease (AD) would be 
facilitated by easily scalable, cost-effective and accurate tests. In the 
present study, we evaluated plasma phospho-tau217 (p-tau217) using predefined 
biomarker cutoffs. The study included 1,767 participants with cognitive symptoms 
from 4 independent secondary care cohorts in Malmö (Sweden, n = 337), Gothenburg 
(Sweden, n = 165), Barcelona (Spain, n = 487) and Brescia (Italy, n = 230), and 
a primary care cohort in Sweden (n = 548). Plasma p-tau217 was primarily 
measured using the fully automated, commercially available, Lumipulse 
immunoassay. The primary outcome was AD pathology defined as abnormal 
cerebrospinal fluid Aβ42:p-tau181. Plasma p-tau217 detected AD pathology with 
areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves of 0.93-0.96. In 
secondary care, the accuracies were 89-91%, the positive predictive values 
89-95% and the negative predictive values 77-90%. In primary care, the accuracy 
was 85%, the positive predictive values 82% and the negative predictive values 
88%. Accuracy was lower in participants aged ≥80 years (83%), but was unaffected 
by chronic kidney disease, diabetes, sex, APOE genotype or cognitive stage. 
Using a two-cutoff approach, accuracies increased to 92-94% in secondary and 
primary care, excluding 12-17% with intermediate results. Using the plasma 
p-tau217:Aβ42 ratio did not improve accuracy but reduced intermediate test 
results (≤10%). Compared with a high-performing mass-spectrometry-based assay 
for percentage p-tau217, accuracies were comparable in secondary care. However, 
percentage p-tau217 had higher accuracy in primary care and was unaffected by 
age. In conclusion, this fully automated p-tau217 test demonstrates high 
accuracy for identifying AD pathology. A two-cutoff approach might be necessary 
to optimize performance across diverse settings and subpopulations.

Protein Kinase R is an essential regulator of many cell activities and belongs 
to one of the largest and most functionally complex gene families. These are 
found all over the body, and by adding phosphate groups to the substrate 
proteins, they regulate their activity and coordinate the action of almost all 
cellular processes. Recent research has illuminated the involvement of PKR in 
the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders (NDs), thereby expanding our 
understanding of intricate molecular mechanisms underlying disease progression. 
Through their inhibition or activation, they hold potential therapeutic targets 
for the pathogenesis or protection of NDs. In the case of AD (AD), PKR 
contributes to the protection or elevation of Aβ accumulation, 
neuroinflammation, synaptic plasticity alterations, and neuronal excitability. 
Similarly, in Parkinson's disease (PD), PKR again has a dual role in 
dopaminergic neuronal loss, gene mutations, and mitochondrial dysfunction via 
various pathways. Notably, neuronal excitotoxicity, as well as genetic 
mutations, have been linked to ALS. In Huntington's disease (HD), PKR is 
associated with decreased or increased mutated genes, striatal neuron 
degeneration, neuroinflammation, and excitotoxicity. This review emphasizes 
strategies that target PKR for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. 
Doing so offers valuable insights that can guide future research endeavors and 
the development of innovative therapeutic approaches.

Microglia are the resident immune cells in the brain and have pivotal roles in 
neurodevelopment and neuroinflammation1,2. This study investigates the function 
of the immune-checkpoint molecule TIM-3 (encoded by HAVCR2) in microglia. TIM-3 
was recently identified as a genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's 
disease3, and it can induce T cell exhaustion4. However, its specific function 
in brain microglia remains unclear. We demonstrate in mouse models that TGFβ 
signalling induces TIM-3 expression in microglia. In turn, TIM-3 interacts with 
SMAD2 and TGFBR2 through its carboxy-terminal tail, which enhances TGFβ 
signalling by promoting TGFBR-mediated SMAD2 phosphorylation, and this process 
maintains microglial homeostasis. Genetic deletion of Havcr2 in microglia leads 
to increased phagocytic activity and a gene-expression profile consistent 
with the neurodegenerative microglial phenotype (MGnD), also referred to as 
disease-associated microglia (DAM). Furthermore, microglia-targeted deletion of 
Havcr2 ameliorates cognitive impairment and reduces amyloid-β pathology in 5×FAD 
mice (a transgenic model of Alzheimer's disease). Single-nucleus RNA sequencing 
revealed a subpopulation of MGnD microglia in Havcr2-deficient 5×FAD mice 
characterized by increased pro-phagocytic and anti-inflammatory gene expression 
alongside reduced pro-inflammatory gene expression. These transcriptomic changes 
were corroborated by single-cell RNA sequencing data across most microglial 
clusters in Havcr2-deficient 5×FAD mice. Our findings reveal that TIM-3 mediates 
microglia homeostasis through TGFβ signalling and highlight the therapeutic 
potential of targeting microglial TIM-3 in Alzheimer's disease.

Hematopoietic mosaic loss of Y chromosome: from population cohorts to pathogenic 
mechanisms.

Mosaic loss of Y Chromosome (mLOY) refers to genetic mosaicism in males where 
some somatic cells have lost the Y chromosome (ChrY) while other cells remain 
their ChrY. mLOY is primarily found in the blood, not only because blood cells 
are easily accessible, but also because hematopoietic stem cells with LOY 
mutation gain competitive advantages, therefore producing a large number of 
LOY-positive blood cells via clonal hematopoiesis. Due to the specific 
structures, human ChrY is prone to be missegregated during mitosis, and driving 
by the germline variants, environmental insults and aging microenvironments, 
mLOY becomes the most commonly acquired age-related mutation in male genomes. 
Population-based cohort studies have shown that men with a certain degree of 
mLOY is associated with significantly reduced life expectancy and increased 
risks of cancer, Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular diseases and among others. 
Recent studies using mouse models have further demonstrated that mLOY is a 
driving factor of leukemia and cardiovascular diseases. These findings suggest 
that mLOY not only provides a common genetic explanation for the occurrence of 
many chronic diseases in men, but also provides a new kernel for studying sex 
differences in human lifespan and disease risk. Here, we briefly summarize the 
findings from the population-based cohort studies on clonal hematopoiesis driven 
by LOY. Subsequently we sort out the risk factors of mLOY, methods for detecting 
mLOY and developing mLOY mouse models, and the potential mechanisms of mLOY in 
promoting a myriad of chronic diseases. Finally, we provide our own 
forward-looking perspectives for the future challenges and opportunities in 
mLOY. The findings from this review provide references for studying the 
biological role of Y chromosome and sex difference of chronic diseases.

chromosome, 
ChrY)丢失而与非LOY细胞形成的遗传嵌合现象。mLOY主要发现于血液中，不仅因为血细胞易取样，更因为发生LOY突变的造血干细胞在获得竞争优势后可驱动克隆性造血，产生大量携带LOY突变的血细胞。由于结构的特殊性，人ChrY在有丝分裂时易发生异常分离，同时在种系突变、环境暴露、衰老微环境等因素的驱动下，mLOY成为男性体细胞中最常见的获得性突变。早期的人群队列研究显示造血系统mLOY与男性预期寿命缩短以及癌症、阿尔茨海默病和心血管疾病等慢病风险增加显著相关，近期的小鼠模型研究表明mLOY是白血病和心血管疾病的诱发因素。因此，mLOY不仅为众多慢病的发生发展提供了共同的遗传学基础，也为研究人类寿命与疾病风险中的性别差异提供了新的内核。本文首先简述了LOY驱动克隆性造血的人群队列研究进展，随后梳理出mLOY的危险因素、检测方法和小鼠模型的构建策略，并总结了mLOY诱发多种重大慢病的潜在分子机制，最后对mLOY领域的挑战和发展机遇提出了前瞻展望。相关综述成果为深入研究ChrY的生物学功能和慢病的性别差异提供参考。.

Arsenic exposure and intestinal microbiota disorders may be related with 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the mechanism has not been elucidated. This study 
conducted chronic arsenic exposure from rat's maternal body to adult offspring 
to investigate the mechanisms of the characteristic effects of chronic arsenic 
exposure on AD, and further explored the intervention effect of fecal microbiota 
transplantation (FMT) on arsenic-mediated neurotoxicity. Transmission electron 
microscopy, HE staining, and related indicators were measured in the control 
group, the exposed group, and the FMT intervention group. Western blot was used 
to determine microtubule-associated proteins Tau and p-Tau396, intestinal-brain 
barrier-related proteins Claudin-1 and Occludin, ELISA was used to detect the 
content of Aβ1-42, and 16S rRNA sequencing was used to detect the intestinal 
flora of feces. Results showed that chronic arsenic exposure could lead to 
neurobehavioral defects in rats, increase the expression levels of Tau, 
p-Tau396, and Aβ1-42 in hippocampus (p < 0.05), increase the abundance of 
Clostridium _ UCG-014, decrease the abundance of Roseburia, and decrease the 
expression levels of Claudin-1 and Occludin in colon and hippocampus (p < 0.05). 
After FMT intervention, the expression levels of Tau and p-Tau396 were decreased 
(p < 0.05), and the abundance of Roseburia was increased. In summary, chronic 
arsenic exposure caused intestinal flora disorder by changing the abundance of 
inflammation-related flora, thereby destroying the gut-brain barrier and causing 
AD characteristic effects in rats. Although the bacterial specific genus was 
improved and the expression of AD-related proteins was reduced after 
transplantation, it could not alleviate the neurobehavioral defects and 
neurotoxicity caused by arsenic exposure.

BACKGROUND: Late-life depression (LLD) is associated with white matter (WM) 
alterations. Current evidence indicates that amyloid positron emission 
tomography (PET) tracers are sensitive and reliable markers for evaluating 
normal-appearing WM (NAWM) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), showing an 
association between lower uptake and Alzheimer's disease pathology and higher 
uptake with age-related changes. Utilizing this novel and reliable technique, we 
aimed to distinguish between 2 hypothetical models for neurobiology of LLD, the 
pathological neurodegenerative model and the accelerated aging model.
METHODS: In this monocentric cross-sectional study, a total of 103 participants, 
including 61 patients with LLD (age 73.8 ± 7.0 years; 41 female) and 42 healthy 
control (HC) participants (age 72.5 ± 7.6 years; 28 female), underwent PET 
imaging with 18F-flutemetamol, MRI, and clinical assessment. T2-weighted 
fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images were segmented into WM 
hyperintensities (WMHs) and NAWM.
RESULTS: The 18F-flutemetamol standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) in WMHs was 
significantly lower than that in NAWM (t102 = 7.8, p < .001). Compared with HC 
participants, patients with LLD exhibited higher 18F-flutemetamol SUVR in both 
NAWM (p < .001, Cohen's d = 0.91) and WMHs (p = .005, d = 0.56), even after 
controlling for age and 18F-flutemetamol SUVR in cortical gray matter.
CONCLUSIONS: Our result of elevated 18F-flutemetamol uptake in NAWM is not 
consistent with the pathological neurodegenerative aging pattern observed in 
Alzheimer's disease but is consistent with patterns of age-related changes. This 
distinction is crucial for the development of future targeted treatments.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder, and current 
therapies mainly offer symptomatic relief. Given that the pathophysiology of AD 
is multifaceted, a multimodal therapeutic strategy targeting multiple molecular 
pathways implicated in AD-related pathogenesis represents a pragmatic avenue for 
impeding the advancement of AD. In this study, we evaluated the anti-Alzheimer 
effects of an HDAC6 inhibitor WY118, both alone and in combination with lithium 
chloride (LiCl), a GSK-3β inhibitor, to synergistically suppress ferroptosis. 
The combination of compound WY118 and LiCl demonstrated significant synergistic 
effects in both cellular models of AD induced by glutamate and streptozotocin. 
The findings suggest that compound WY118, in particular in combination with 
LiCl, exhibits potent anti-Alzheimer effects by synergistically suppressing 
ferroptosis. Studies on the mechanism of action indicated that the combination 
treatment significantly reduced tau phosphorylation and inhibited p38 MAPK 
signaling. This combination therapy holds promise for developing more effective 
treatments for AD.

Recent research has established a strong link between metabolic abnormalities 
and an increased risk of dementia. In parallel, there is growing epidemiological 
evidence supporting the neuroprotective effects of antidiabetic medications 
against cognitive impairments. Among these, sodium-glucose co-transporter 
(SGLT2) inhibitors have emerged as pharmacological candidates with promising 
potential in alleviating the burden of age-related diseases, particularly 
neurodegenerative diseases (NDD). SGLT2 inhibitor therapies are FDA-approved 
medications routinely prescribed to manage diabetes. This novel class was 
initially developed to address cardiovascular disorders and to reduce the risk 
of hypoglycemia associated with insulin-secretagogue agents. It subsequently 
attracted growing interest for its beneficial effects on central nervous system 
(CNS) disorders. However, the molecular mechanisms through which these 
glucose-lowering therapies mitigate cognitive decline and limit the progression 
of certain brain degenerative diseases remain largely unexplored. Consequently, 
the neuroscientific community needs further studies that gather, analyze, and 
critically discuss the available mechanistic evidence regarding the 
neuroprotective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors. This review aims to critically 
examine the most relevant published findings, both in vitro and in vivo, as well 
as human studies evaluating the impact of SGLT2 inhibitors exposure on 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). It seeks to integrate the current understanding of 
their beneficial effects at the molecular level and their role in addressing the 
pathophysiology and neuropathology of AD. These insights will help extend our 
knowledge of how SGLT2 inhibitor therapies are associated with reduced risk of 
dementia and thus shed light on the link between diabetes and AD.

The apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene's APOE4 variant is frequently associated with 
an elevated risk of Alzheimer's disease, while APOE3 isoform is found in normal 
individuals. Both the isoforms differ by only one base (Single nucleotide 
polymorphisms, SNPs). In this study, Amiloride hydrochloride (AM), a diuretic 
drug, was utilized to investigate its interaction with the DNA sequence of APOE 
isoforms, APOE3 and APOE4. Na+/H+ exchangers (NHEs) are inhibited by AM, thus 
making these transporters as amiloride-sensitive. Various physicochemical and 
molecular docking methods were employed to explore the AM binding site on the 
22-mer apo3 and apo4 DNA sequences. Present study revealed that AM binds to the 
minor groove via vander Waals forces or H-bonding. The binding constants 
obtained from both the absorbance and fluorescence studies depict that AM 
strongly interacts with apo4 sequence. Competitive analysis with Acridine Orange 
and Hoechst supported the minor groove binding property of AM. Molecular docking 
results, including LigPlots, further supported the experimental analysis, 
revealing the interacting nitrogenous bases of the studied sequences. This study 
helps in facilitating our understanding regarding the DNA-drug binding 
interactions, which may further be utilized for designing a better and more 
target-specific drug for Alzheimer's disease treatment.

INTRODUCTION: The misdiagnosis rate of Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) remains 
high. Accurate diagnosis is paramount in the era of anti-amyloid therapy. The 
main objective of the current study is to elucidate early clinical features of 
pathologically confirmed DLB without parkinsonism (DLB-nP) that potentially 
resemble Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: We accessed the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center database from 
2005 to December 2022 data freeze and included 3159 Alzheimer's disease, 91 
DLB-nP, and 307 DLB with parkinsonism (DLBP) cases. Diagnosis of AD and DLB were 
based on existing pathological criteria. First visit data was analyzed.
RESULTS: Clinician-determined memory impairment is common in DLB-nP (87.9 % vs. 
AD 97.4 %) but is associated with a higher risk of AD diagnosis. Misdiagnosis as 
AD in DLB-nP stands at 75.8 %. Visual hallucinations (VH) or hallucinations are 
the only variables favoring DLB-nP diagnosis, but they only account for 22 % and 
14 % of the cohort, respectively. After patients with VH were removed from the 
model, the misdiagnosis rate as AD increased to 85.2 %, and nighttime behavior 
was the only variable found to favor DLB-nP diagnosis. Visuospatial dysfunction 
is more common in DLB-P than DLB-nP but does not distinguish DLB-nP from AD.
CONCLUSION: Amnestic presentation, while favoring AD diagnosis, is common in DLB 
without parkinsonism, and misdiagnosis is common. While VH remains the most 
prominent clinical feature for prompting DLB diagnosis, misdiagnosis becomes 
more profound in its absence during the early phase. In this study, exercising 
great caution during clinical assessment appears to be the fundamental way to 
minimize misdiagnosis for patients with amnestic presentation yet without 
parkinsonism and VH.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Female sex and a parental history of Alzheimer 
disease (AD), especially maternal, confer increased risk of AD. Associations 
between sex, or affected AD parent's sex, and biomarkers of AD are less clear. 
We examined whether sex or affected AD parent's sex influences (1) β-amyloid 
(Aβ) and tau burden/accumulation, (2) the association between Aβ and tau burden, 
and (3) brain and cognitive resilience to Aβ and tau burden.
METHODS: The sample included 243 participants from the Presymptomatic Evaluation 
of Experimental or Novel Treatments for AD cohort in Canada. All participants 
with [18F]-NAV4694 and [18F]-AV1451 PET and MRI were included. We examined (1) 
sex or affected AD parent's sex differences on regional Aβ and tau 
burden/accumulation; (2) 2-way interactions between sex, or affected AD parent's 
sex, and Aβ on tau burden; and (3) 3-way interactions between time, sex or 
affected AD parent's sex, and Aβ or tau deposition on hippocampal volume (brain 
resilience) and cognition (cognitive resilience) over time.
RESULTS: Participants (69.4% female) were aged 68.3 ± 5.1 years at their first 
PET scans. All were cognitively unimpaired at baseline. Longitudinal cognitive 
data were available for 242 participants (follow-up, 6.72 ± 2.38 years), 
including 238 (6.53 ± 2.48 years of follow-up) with MRI follow-ups and 115 (4.4 
± 0.6 years of follow-up) with PET follow-ups, and 71 developed mild cognitive 
impairment. Women showed greater tau deposition (standardized β = 0.13 ± 0.3) 
and showed a stronger association between global Aβ and tau deposition than men 
(standardized β = 0.79 ± 0.1). Individuals with an affected AD father showed 
stronger association between global Aβ and tau deposition than those with an 
affected AD mother (standardized β = 0.65 ± 0.1). Women showed less 
Aβ-associated hippocampal atrophy over time (standardized β = 0.24 ± 0.1).
DISCUSSION: Women and, surprisingly, individuals with a paternal history of AD 
seemed more vulnerable to the Aβ-related spread of tau, whereas women showed 
greater brain resilience to Aβ. Understanding sex-specific risk and resilience 
could allow more clinical trial precision and personalization. A major 
limitation included the reduced sample for the affected AD parent's sex 
analyses.

Super-enhancers (SEs) play a key role in cell fate determination by regulating 
the transcription of cell-specific target genes and may contribute to the 
pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Targeted inhibition of the activity 
of SEs or knockout of SEs fragments may represent a novel therapeutic strategy 
for neurodegenerative diseases. This article mainly outlines the discovery, 
structure, and identification methods of SEs; lists the current SE database 
platforms; summarizes the main regulatory mechanisms of SEs and strategies to 
acquire disease-specific SEs; and reviews recent research advances on SEs in 
neurodegenerative diseases. These findings provide new insights into the 
molecular mechanisms and development of treatment for neurodegenerative 
diseases.

Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis, are increasingly prevalent among aging populations. Oxidative 
stress contributes to these diseases, leading to cellular damage and neuronal 
death. Natural antioxidants are being explored as preventive measures. This 
study aims to assess the effectiveness of natural antioxidants in delaying the 
onset or progression of neurodegenerative diseases by identifying their specific 
mechanisms of action. A comprehensive review of existing literature was 
conducted, focusing on studies that examine the role of natural antioxidants in 
neuroprotection. Key natural antioxidants, including flavonoids, polyphenls, 
vitamins C and E, and omega-3 fatty acids, were reviewed and analyzed for their 
bioavailability, mechanisms of action, and outcomes in both in vitro and in vivo 
studies. Additionally, clinical trials involving human subjects were considered 
to provide insights into the translational implications of antioxidant 
consumption. The findings suggest that several natural antioxidants exhibit 
neuroprotective properties by modulating oxidative stress, reducing 
inflammation, and promoting neuronal survival. For instance, flavonoids such as 
quercetin and resveratrol have shown promise in enhancing cognitive function and 
mitigating the pathophysiological alterations associated with neurodegeneration. 
In clinical studies, higher intakes of dietary antioxidants were correlated with 
a reduced risk of developing neurodegenerative disorders. Natural antioxidants 
offer potential for preventing neurodegenerative diseases by counteracting 
oxidative stress and maintaining cellular integrity. Overall, our report 
recommends that further research is needed to optimize dosages and understand 
their long-term benefits.

The application of terahertz waves in the field of neurological disease research 
has gradually attracted attention in recent years. Prior studies have indicated 
that terahertz waves are capable of alleviating the symptoms of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) in mice, yet the underlying relevant mechanisms remain unclear. 
This study explores the therapeutic potential of terahertz (THz) radiation on AD 
using a transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans model expressing human tau protein. 
The nematodes were subjected to 0.1 THz radiation at varying power levels, and 
its impact on locomotion, tau protein aggregation, and associative learning was 
evaluated. Results indicate that 0.1 THz irradiation significantly improved the 
locomotor performance and associative learning of the tau transgenic nematodes, 
reduced tau aggregation, and increased the expression of SKN-1 and DAF-16. 
Molecular dynamics simulation revealed that THz waves inhibited the structural 
stability of tau protofibrils by reducing the protein compactness, altering the 
secondary structure, reducing hydrogen bond formation, and changing the 
hydrophobic interaction. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of 
low-frequency THz radiation as a nonpharmacological therapy for AD, highlighting 
its ability to modulate neuronal function and alleviate disease symptoms.

AIMS: Neurological diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD) with cognitive 
deficits show impaired theta, gamma, and ripple bands. Restoring these 
oscillations may be crucial for rescuing cognitive functions. Low-intensity 
transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS), a noninvasive neuromodulation method, 
offers high spatial resolution and deep penetration. However, it remains unclear 
how 40 Hz and 200 Hz TUS may improve memory in AD by regulating hippocampal 
oscillations.
METHODS: We applied 40 Hz and 200 Hz TUS to the CA1 region of AD mice, 
performing memory assessments and CA1 electrophysiology recordings 
simultaneously.
RESULTS: Our results showed that both 40 Hz and 200 Hz TUS significantly 
improved memory performance in AD mice by targeting the dorsal hippocampus and 
increasing power in corresponding frequency bands. Specifically, 40 Hz TUS 
enhanced gamma and ripple bands, while 200 Hz TUS strongly affected both. This 
enhancement increased during stimulation and persisted 5 days poststimulation. 
Improved coupling between theta and gamma oscillations indicated better 
hippocampal coordination with other brain regions. Additionally, 40 Hz TUS 
raised sharp wave ripple (SPW-Rs) incidence, and 200 Hz TUS increased both SPW-R 
incidence and duration, contributing to memory improvement. Behavioral 
performance significantly improved with TUS at both frequencies.
CONCLUSION: Ultrasound-induced synchronized neural activities at 40 Hz and 
200 Hz entrained corresponding oscillations and improved memory in Alzheimer's 
disease.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) constitutes a devastating neurodegenerative 
disorder, manifested by amyloid-β aggregation, phosphorylated tau accumulation, 
and progressive cognitive deterioration. Current therapeutic interventions 
remain predominantly symptomatic, underscoring the urgency for more efficacious 
treatment strategies.
PURPOSE: This study elucidated the therapeutic potential of Sanshen San (SSS), a 
traditional Chinese herbal formula encompassing Polygala Radix, Pini Radix in 
Poria, and Acori Tatarinowii Rhizoma, on cognitive function and AD pathology.
METHODS: We implemented both acute Aβ1-42-injected mice and 5xFAD transgenic 
mouse models. The therapeutic efficacy of SSS was assessed through behavioral 
paradigms including Y-maze, Novel Object Recognition, and Morris Water Maze. 
Molecular mechanisms were delineated utilizing RNA sequencing, metabolomics 
analysis, immunofluorescence staining, Golgi-Cox staining, transmission electron 
microscopy, and Western blotting.
RESULTS: Chemical analysis unveiled 10 principal bioactive compounds in SSS. The 
formula substantially ameliorated cognitive performance in both Aβ1-42-injected 
and 5xFAD mouse models, attenuated Aβ plaque burden, and augmented microglial 
phagocytosis. SSS safeguarded synaptic integrity, enhanced mitochondrial 
function, and facilitated autophagy. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses 
demonstrated that SSS predominantly operates by reinstating synaptic 
transmission and neurotransmitter function, particularly in the dopaminergic 
system.
CONCLUSION: SSS efficaciously mitigates AD pathology through potentiating 
synaptic function, optimizing mitochondrial homeostasis, and restoring 
neurotransmitter balance, exemplifying a promising multi-target therapeutic 
strategy for the treatment of AD.

BACKGROUND: Caregivers of people with mild forms of cognitive decline, namely 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI), are subjected to caregiver burden. In recent 
years, a major breakthrough was the possibility of diagnosing Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) reliably in patients that present with MCI, as required for the use 
of the recently approved anti-amyloid therapies. We aimed to examine the 
caregiver burden in caregivers of patients with MCI due to AD, describe how 
caregiver burden evolves with time, and determine caregiver baseline factors 
that might predict the progression of burden.
METHODS: Twenty-five dyads of community-dwelling patients and caregivers were 
consecutively recruited from a memory outpatient clinic, after receiving the 
diagnosis of MCI due to AD. Caregiver burden was measured with the Zarit Burden 
Inventory (ZBI), life satisfaction with Satisfaction With Life Scale, depressive 
symptoms with the Centre for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D), 
anxiety symptoms with the State Anxiety Subscale of the State-Trait Anxiety 
Inventory (STAI) and patient neuropsychiatric symptoms with the Neuropsychiatric 
Inventory (NPI).
RESULTS: At baseline, the mean ZBI score was 24.5 ± 15.2 and correlated 
positively with caregiver CES-D and STAI scores and with patient 
neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPI-frequency × severity) and distress felt by the 
caregiver (NPI-distress). At follow-up (17.7 ± 9.4 months) the mean ZBI score 
increased to 31.4 ± 16.3 (P < 0.001); however, no baseline caregiver or patient 
characteristics were identified associated with the evolution of caregiver 
burden.
CONCLUSIONS: Caregivers of patients who received a diagnosis of MCI due to AD 
report substantial burden, that increased with time. Future studies should 
investigate caregiver characteristics that may predict burden progression and 
help delineate strategies to minimise it.

Poop for thought: Can fecal microbiome transplantation improve cognitive 
function in aging dogs?

Dewey CW(1).

Author information:
(1)Elemental Pet Vets, PLLC, Freeville, NY.

Canine cognitive dysfunction (CCD) is the dog version of human Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), and it has strikingly similar pathological features to those of 
this neurodegenerative disorder. The gastrointestinal system is in constant 
communication with the brain via several conduits collectively termed the 
gut-brain axis. The microbial population of the gut, referred to as the 
microbiota, has a profound effect on the interactions that occur along this 
communication route. Recent evidence suggests that dysbiosis, an abnormal 
gastrointestinal microbial population, is linked to cognitive impairment in 
rodent AD models and human AD. There is also evidence from rodent AD models that 
correcting dysbiosis by transferring fecal material from healthy donors to the 
gastrointestinal tracts of cognitively impaired recipients [fecal microbiome 
transplantation (FMT)] reverses AD-associated brain pathology and improves 
cognitive function. Although limited, some clinical reports have described the 
improvement of cognitive function with FMT in human AD. The goals of this review 
article are to provide an overview of the mechanisms involved in dysbiosis- 
associated cognitive decline and the role of FMT in therapy for such decline. 
The potential role of FMT in CCD is also discussed.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurological condition 
characterized by impaired cognitive dysfunction and abnormal behavior. 
Thirty-five million individuals worldwide suffer from dementia, making it the 
most frequent cause of dementia. Canine cognitive dysfunction (CCD) affects 28% 
of dogs aged 11-12 years. It is a prevalent disease in canines. Amyloid-β 
peptides accumulate neurotoxicity, resulting in problems in the central nervous 
system and neurotransmitters. Treatments for both AD and CCD have not yet shown 
acceptable outcomes. It is crucial to comprehend disease mechanisms and identify 
novel therapeutics using animal models.
AIM: Using a rat model of AD, this study attempted to determine the effects of 
an ethanolic extract from Ocimum sanctum on the number and shape of neurons in 
the CA1, CA3, and DG sections of the hippocampus along with the expression of 
neurotrophic factors.
METHODS: The animal model will be split into five treatment groups, one of which 
will be a control group. The treatments will be administered for 14, 21, and 28 
days, and samples will be analyzed by BDNF by ELISA, SP expression by 
immunohistochemical staining, and the number of neurons in CA1, CA3, and DG 
using cresyl violet staining.
RESULTS: Results of the study revealed increased neuronal density in the CA1, 
CA3, and DG regions, and these neurons were more highly expressed in the 
neurotrophic factor BDNF and neuropeptide SP.
CONCLUSION: By upregulating the expression of SP and BDNF, the ethanolic extract 
of O. sanctum increased the neuronal counts (pyramidal and granular cells) in 
the hippocampal CA1, CA3, and DG regions.

INTRODUCTION: This study involved evaluating a tailored genetic counseling and 
testing (GCT) protocol for families at risk of autosomal dominant Alzheimer's 
disease (ADAD) in Latin America (LatAm), focusing on essential cultural and 
regional adaptations.
METHODS: We conducted a non-randomized controlled trial among ADAD families in 
Colombia and Argentina. Participants were categorized based on their decision to 
learn their genetic status (GS), with further comparisons between 
mutation-positive versus mutation-negative participants who learned their 
status. Psychological impacts were measured using validated scales for anxiety 
and depression.
RESULTS: Of the 122 eligible participants, 97 completed the GCT protocol, and 87 
opted to learn their GS. There were no clinically significant differences in 
psychological distress between those who learned their status and those who did 
not, nor between mutation-positive and mutation-negative individuals.
DISCUSSION: The GCT protocol effectively managed psychological impacts in ADAD 
families and was positively received, demonstrating the importance of culturally 
adapted GCT protocols.
HIGHLIGHTS: We examined the adaptation and efficacy of a GCT protocol in LatAm 
for families at risk of ADAD.The GCT protocol mitigated psychological distress 
among at-risk ADAD families.The study confirms the protocol's cultural 
appropriateness and psychological safety.Future studies should explore the 
long-term psychological and public health impacts of GCT and use of GCT for 
treatment options.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurological condition that causes neurons and 
axons in the brain to deteriorate over time and in a specific pattern. The 
enzyme beta-secretase-1 (BACE-1) plays a crucial role in the onset and 
progression of AD. In silico approaches, or computer-aided drug design, have 
become useful tools for reducing the number of therapeutic candidates that need 
to be evaluated in human clinical trials. Finding chemicals that bind to 
BACE-1's active site and inhibit its activity is key for preventing AD. A 
pharmacophore model was developed in this study based on potent BACE-1 
inhibitors previously identified, and subsequently employed to screen a 
commercially available compound database for similar compounds. ZINC35883784 was 
identified with high binding affinities and hydrogen bonding interactions. 
Moreover, similar properties to donepezil were found in a compound made by 
altering the structure of ZINC35883784 called 
(4R,5R)-2-[1-(2-ethylcyclohexyl)ethyl]-4-hydroxy-5-(4-hydroxybutyl)cyclohexanolate 
(M4). Compounds were tested for interactions with BACE-1 and favorable 
properties. Binding scores were confirmed after molecular docking. The 
assessment of drug-likeness was conducted utilizing Swiss ADME analysis. 
Molecular dynamics simulations assessed the stability of compound interactions 
with BACE-1. MMPBSA calculated binding free energy and contribution energy. 
Results showed that M4 had strong and steady interactions with BACE-1. M4 was 
also analyzed by predicted NMR and retrosynthesis. However, further experiments 
are needed to evaluate M4's potential as a BACE-1 inhibitor.

We applied machine learning techniques to build models that predict perceived 
risks and benefits of using artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to recruit 
African American informal caregivers for clinical trials and general health 
disparity research via social media platforms. In a U.S. sample of 572 family 
caregivers of a person with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), 
our application of the J48 algorithm (C4.5) revealed an interesting trend. 
African American family members of a person with ADRD were more likely to see 
the benefits of using AI on social media to ease the burden of recruitment, 
regardless of age, ethnicity, gender, and level of education. However, white 
family caregivers, particularly those aged 25-34 with graduate degrees, were 
more cautious and prone to perceive risks of using AI on social media for 
recruitment in research. This caution underscores the need for further research 
and understanding in this area.

We compared emotional valence scores as determined via machine vs human ratings 
from a survey conducted from April to May 2024 on perceived attitudes on the use 
of artificial intelligence (AI) for African American family caregivers of 
persons with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) (N=627). The 
participants answered risks, benefits and possible solutions qualitatively on 
the open-ended questions on ten AI use cases, followed by a rating of each. 
Then, we applied three machine learning algorithms to detect emotional valence 
scores from the text data and compared their mean to the human ratings. The mean 
emotional valence scores from text data via natural language processing (NLP) 
were negative regardless of algorithms (AFINN: -1.61 ± 2.76, Bing: -1.40 ± 1.52, 
and Syuzhet: -0.67 ± 1.14), while the mean score of human ratings was positive 
(2.30 ± 1.48, p=0.0001). Our findings have implications for the practice of 
survey design using self-rated instruments and open-ended questions in an NLP 
era.

OBJECTIVES: Hearing loss is recognized as a potentially modifiable risk factor 
for dementia in midlife. This study aimed to investigate the association between 
rehabilitation methods and dementia risk in patients with severe to profound 
hearing loss.
DESIGN: Using the nationwide population data from South Korea, individuals with 
severe to profound hearing loss were identified. Individuals aged 40 to 79 were 
then divided into 3 groups according to the type of auditory rehabilitation they 
received in the period between 2005 and 2010, namely cochlear implant (CI), 
hearing aid (HA), or no rehabilitation (NR). No hearing loss (NHL) group (with 
normal hearing) consisted of individuals without hearing loss. Dementia 
incidence was followed up to 2022.
RESULTS: The study involved 649 individuals in the CI group, 35,076 in the HA, 
16,494 in the NR, and 1,280,788 in the NHL group. The groups that received 
auditory rehabilitation (HA and CI groups) had a significantly reduced risk of 
dementia compared with the NR group, with the CI group showing the most 
pronounced reduction. The CI group demonstrated a lower risk of dementia than 
the HA group and had a similar dementia risk to the NHL group.
CONCLUSIONS: In individuals with severe to profound hearing loss, rates of 
dementia were lower in CI users than in HA users. Moreover, the risk of dementia 
in those undergoing CI surgery is comparable to that of individuals with normal 
hearing.

BACKGROUND: This umbrella meta-analysis evaluates the effects of probiotics on 
cognitive function and metabolic health in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) by synthesizing findings from meta-analyses of 
randomized controlled trials (RCTs), as existing evidence remains inconclusive.
METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus 
to identify meta-analyses of RCTs investigating the impact of probiotic 
supplementation on cognitive function and metabolic biomarkers. The 
random-effects model was used. Heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed.
RESULTS: Thirteen meta-analyses, comprising 3910 patients, were included. 
Probiotics significantly improved cognitive function in AD (SMD = 0.78, 95% CI: 
0.33 to 1.23) and MCI (SMD = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.15 to 0.70). Probiotics also 
increased total antioxidant capacity (SMD = 0.40, 95% CI: 0.11 to 0.70) and 
reduced MDA (SMD =  - 0.35, 95% CI: - 0.62 to - 0.09) and hs-CRP (SMD =  - 0.59, 
95% CI: - 0.87 to - 0.30). Insulin resistance improved, as reflected by 
decreased HOMA-IR (SMD =  - 0.34, 95% CI: - 0.43 to - 0.26). No significant 
effects were observed on glutathione, nitric oxide, or lipid profiles.
CONCLUSION: Probiotic supplementation appears to enhance cognitive function and 
metabolic parameters in individuals with MCI and AD, likely through mechanisms 
involving inflammation reduction, oxidative stress modulation, and improved 
insulin sensitivity. Further high-quality RCTs are required to validate these 
findings and determine optimal probiotic formulations.

BACKGROUND: GPNMB has been discussed as a potential therapeutic target in 
GRN-mediated neurodegeneration, based on the observed reproducible upregulation 
in FTD-GRN cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and post-mortem brain. However, the 
functional impacts of up-regulated GPNMB are currently unknown, and it is 
currently unclear if targeting GPNMB will be protective or deleterious. 
Increases in GPNMB seen in FTD-GRN are reproduced in brains of aged 
Grn-deficient mice. Importantly, although brains of young Grn-deficient mice do 
not exhibit upregulated Gpnmb expression, peripheral immune cells of these mice 
exhibit increased Gpnmb expression as young as 5-to-6 months, suggesting the 
effects of Grn-deficiency in the periphery proceed those in the brain. 
Grn-deficiency is known to alter peripheral immune cell function, including 
impaired autophagy and altered cytokine secretion. GPNMB has potential effects 
on these processes, but has never been studied in peripheral immune cells of 
patients or preclinical models. Informing the functional significance of GPNMB 
upregulation in Grn-deficient states in myeloid cells has potential to inform 
GPNMB as a therapeutic candidate.
METHODS: The effects of GPNMB knock-down via antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) 
were assessed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 25 
neurologically healthy controls (NHCs) and age- and sex-matched FTD-GRN 
patients, as well as peritoneal macrophages (pMacs) from progranulin-deficient 
(Grn -/-) and B6 mice. Lysosomal function, antigen presentation and MHC-II 
processing and recycling were assessed, as well as cytokine release and 
transcription.
RESULTS: ASO-mediated knock-down of GPNMB increased lysosomal burden and IL1β 
cytokine secretion in FTD-GRN carriers and NHCs monocytes. ASO-mediated 
knock-down of Gpnmb in Grn-deficient macrophages decreased lysosomal 
pan-cathepsin activity and protein degradation. In addition, ASO-mediated 
knock-down of Gpnmb increased MHC-II surface expression, which was driven by 
decreased MHC-II uptake and recycling, in macrophages from Grn-deficient 
females. Finally, ASO-mediated knock-down of Gpnmb dysregulated IFN γ 
-stimulated IL6 cytokine transcription and secretion by mouse macrophages due to 
the absence of regulatory actions of the Gpnmb extracellular fragment (ECF).
CONCLUSIONS: Our data herein reveal that GPNMB has a regulatory effect on 
multiple immune effector functions, including capping inflammation and immune 
responses in myeloid cells, potentially via secretion of its ECF. Therefore, in 
progranulin-deficient states, the marked upregulation in GPNMB transcript and 
protein may represent a compensatory mechanism to preserve lysosomal function in 
myeloid cells. These novel findings indicate that targeted depletion of GPNMB in 
FTD-GRN would not be a rational therapeutic strategy because it is likely to 
dysregulate important immune cell effector functions mediated by GPNMB. 
Specifically, our data indicate that therapeutic strategies inhibiting GPNMB 
levels and/or activity may worsen the effects of GRN deficiency.

Reduced histone acetylation in the brain causes transcriptional dysregulation 
and cognitive impairment that are key initial steps in Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
etiology. Unfortunately, current treatment strategies primarily focus on histone 
deacetylase inhibition (HDACi) that causes detrimental side effects due to 
non-specific acetylation. Here, we test Tip60 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) 
activation as a therapeutic strategy for selectively restoring 
cognition-associated histone acetylation depleted in AD by developing compounds 
that enhance Tip60's neuroprotective HAT function. Several compounds show high 
Tip60-binding affinity predictions in silico, enhanced Tip60 HAT action in 
vitro, and restore Tip60 knockdown mediated functional deficits in Drosophila in 
vivo. Furthermore, compounds prevent neuronal deficits and lethality in an 
AD-associated amyloid precursor protein neurodegenerative Drosophila model and 
remarkably, restore expression of repressed neuroplasticity genes in the AD 
brain, underscoring compound specificity and therapeutic effectiveness. Our 
results highlight Tip60 HAT activators as a promising therapeutic 
neuroepigenetic modulator strategy for AD treatment.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia, which continues 
to elude effective treatment despite decades of research and numerous clinical 
trials. While existing therapeutic strategies have primarily targeted 
neuropathological hallmarks such as amyloid plaques and tau tangles, they have 
failed to halt disease progression, leaving patients with limited options. This 
persistent failure reveals a critical gap in our understanding of AD and calls 
for a fresh perspective - one that goes beyond the traditional targets and dives 
deeper into the fundamental cellular processes that drive neurodegeneration. 
Recent advances in molecular biology underscore the significance of nuclear 
factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), often termed the "guardian of redox 
homeostasis," in the pathophysiology of AD. Nrf2 orchestrates cellular responses 
to oxidative stress and neuroinflammation - two interlinked pathological 
features of AD. In the brains of AD patients, Nrf2 activity is diminished, 
weakening the brain's ability to counteract oxidative damage. Additionally, the 
BTB and CNC homology 1 (Bach1) protein, a transcriptional repressor of Nrf2, has 
emerged as a potential therapeutic target. Here, we review the current landscape 
of clinical trials in AD and identify the limitations of the conventional 
approaches. We then explore the prospects of a novel approach that combines Nrf2 
activation with Bach1 inhibition to achieve a multipronged defense against 
oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and other molecular culprits driving AD. 
This innovative strategy holds promise for synergistically modulating multiple 
neuroprotective pathways to advance AD treatment.

Early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) will be key for 
effective personalized treatment plans ( Cummings, 2023). Significant 
difficulties in auditory processing have been frequently reported in many 
patients with mild cognitive impairment, the prodromal form of AD ( Tarawneh et 
al., 2022), making it an outstanding candidate as AD diagnostic biomarker. 
However, the efficiency of diagnosis with this parameter has not been explored. 
Here we show that when male mice with amyloidosis begin to show memory decline, 
changes in the auditory brainstem response (ABR) to clicks enable the reliable 
diagnosis of disease using a machine learning algorithm. Interpretation of the 
machine learning diagnosis revealed that the upper levels of the auditory 
pathway, including the inferior colliculus, were the probable sources of the 
defects. Histological analyses show that in these locations, neuroinflammation 
and plaque deposition temporally correlate with behavioral changes consistent 
with memory loss. While these findings are tempered by the caveat that they 
derive from amyloidosis mice, we propose that ABR measurements be evaluated as 
an additional rapid, low-cost, noninvasive biomarker to assist the diagnostic 
testing of early-stage AD.

OBJECTIVE: To identify notable research contributions relevant to digital health 
applications for precision prevention published in 2023.
METHODS: An extensive search was conducted to identify peer-reviewed articles 
published in 2023 that examined ways that informatics approaches and digital 
health applications could facilitate precision prevention. The selection process 
comprised three steps: 1) candidate best papers were first selected by the two 
section editors; 2) a diverse, international group of external informatics 
subject matter experts reviewed each candidate best paper; and 3) the final 
selection of four best papers was conducted by the editorial committee of the 
Yearbook. The section editors attempted to balance selection by authors' global 
region and areas with clinical medicine and public health.
RESULTS: Selected best papers represent studies that advanced knowledge 
surrounding the use of digital health applications to facilitate precision 
prevention. In general, papers identified in the search fell into one of the 
following categories: 1) applications in precision nutrition; 2) applications in 
precision medicine; and 3) applications in precision public health. The best 
papers spanned several disease targets, including Alzheimer's disease, HIV, and 
COVID-19. Several candidate papers sought to improve prediction of disease 
onset, whereas others focused on predicting response to interventions.
CONCLUSION: Although the selected papers are notable, significant work is needed 
to realize the full potential for precision prevention using digital health. 
Current data and applications only scratch the surface of the potential that 
information technologies can bring to support primary and secondary prevention 
in support of health and well-being for all populations globally.

The effective treatment of neurological diseases, particularly Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), is a significant source of frustration for drug discovery 
scientists. The lengthy process of drug discovery further makes this task 
exceedingly challenging. To enable a rapid stride in drug discovery, we focused 
on the drug repurposing strategy to identify new N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 
(NMDAR) inhibitors from the pool of 1827 approved USFDA drugs. The high 
throughput virtual screening (HTVS) followed by molecular docking and molecular 
mechanics studies enabled us to identify two drugs, Ertugliflozin (Dock Score: 
-9.43 kcal/mol, MMGBSA: -104.50 kcal/mol) and Selpercatinib (Dock Score: 
8.11 kcal/mol, MMGBSA: 83.62 kcal/mol), with a high affinity towards the NMDAR. 
The molecular dynamics analysis on these identified drugs led us to choose 
Ertugliflozin for its better stability as a lead for further studies. The 
corroboration of in silico findings led us to deduce that Ertugliflozin can 
inhibit NMDAR with an IC50 of 613.19 nM. These results were confirmed by the 
anti-NMDAR ELISA-based analysis, which was further deduced via western blotting. 
The work is further supported by strong literature evidence that concludes the 
impact of antidiabetic molecules on AD progression, along with the evidence that 
Ertugliflozin possesses efficacy against AD with unequivocal evidence on the 
biological target and the mechanism. Further work, however, is required to 
establish this association in the in vivo or suitable model that could mimic the 
AD microenvironment as a part of future research.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Although several large studies have evaluated 
individuals with posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) cross-sectionally, its 
longitudinal progression remains poorly characterized. The objectives of this 
study were to determine the longitudinal trajectory of PCA, encompassing the 
temporal aspects of diagnosis, the spectrum of clinical manifestations, and 
patient outcomes.
METHODS: This retrospective study included participants evaluated and diagnosed 
with PCA at the Mayo Clinic, between 1995 and 2023. Clinical data (demographics, 
neurologic evaluations, and cognitive tests at initial presentation and late 
stage) were extracted from medical records. Initial clinical diagnoses during 
previous medical evaluations, including ophthalmologic assessments after onset 
of neurologic symptoms, were documented. Participants were retrospectively 
classified as PCA-pure if they solely met PCA criteria or as PCA-plus if they 
exhibited complex phenotypes also meeting criteria for other neurodegenerative 
syndromes. CSF analyses and neuropathology findings were documented.
RESULTS: The cohort of 558 participants (65% female) had a mean age at symptom 
onset of 61 ± 8 years, with 68% meeting early-onset criteria (younger than 65 
years). The mean duration from symptom onset to diagnosis was 3.6 ± 2.5 years. 
Ophthalmologic/optometric evaluations (49%) and completion of ophthalmologic 
procedures (16%) were common before PCA diagnosis. Psychiatric diagnoses were 
made in 23% of participants before PCA diagnosis, particularly among younger 
women. Common initial symptoms included misplacement of items, difficulties with 
reading and driving, and concerns pertaining to basic visual processing. Notable 
signs were constructional apraxia, dyscalculia, simultanagnosia, and space 
perception deficits. CSF biomarkers were consistent with Alzheimer disease in 
139 of 158 individuals (88%). Superimposed features of non-PCA clinical 
syndromes were observed in a quarter of the participants at presentation, with 
frequency of PCA-plus cases increasing longitudinally. Longitudinal analysis of 
Short Test of Mental Status scores predicted an initial rapid decline in 
cognitive function, with the rate of decline gradually slowing over 0-10 years 
(time coefficient [SE] = -4.20 [0.29], p < 0.001).
DISCUSSION: This study highlights the protracted time from symptom onset and 
frequent misdiagnoses/misattribution of symptoms in PCA. Ophthalmologic 
evaluations often preceded neurologic assessments. Psychiatric diagnoses were 
more frequent among younger women. These observations highlight the need to 
improve diagnostic processes and earlier recognition of PCA, which may enhance 
the effectiveness of emerging disease-modifying therapies.

Several in vitro models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) rely on 2D cell culture, 
and, more recently, 3D cultures represented by free-floating neurospheres have 
been used as models for the disease. The advantage of 3D over 2D cell culture is 
that cell-extracellular matrix and cell-cell interactions can be assessed, 
better representing the molecular and cellular hallmarks of the disease. In the 
current study, we developed two complementary 3D neurosphere models using 
SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells to investigate AD pathology and evaluate 
potential therapies. First, self-assembled neurospheres were exposed to hydrogen 
peroxide (H₂O₂) and amyloid-beta oligomers (AβOs), inducing AD-like features 
such as increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), amyloid 
aggregation, and apoptosis. Treatment with caffeine or photobiomodulation (PBM) 
using LED irradiation significantly reduced Aβ1-42 accumulation, ROS generation, 
and decreased apoptosis markers. Second, 3D bioprinting of SH-SY5Y cells 
resulted in neurospheres with enhanced cellular organization and 
differentiation. These findings emphasize the advantages of 3D models for 
studying neurodegeneration and evaluating therapeutic strategies, bridging the 
gap between traditional 2D cultures and complex in vitro systems.

Neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1) has emerged as an integral lipid mediator with 
significant implications for maintaining neurological health. Being derived from 
docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), NPD1 is a specialized pro-resolving lipid mediator 
(SPM), consisting of a unique structure that attributes potent anti-inflammatory 
and neuroprotective properties crucial for maintaining nervous system 
homeostasis. It exerts its actions through diverse mechanisms, including the 
inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines, modulation of apoptosis, and promotion 
of cellular survival pathways. The dysregulation or deficiency of NPD1 has been 
implicated in the onset and progression of several neurodegenerative diseases, 
such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and stroke, underscoring its critical role in 
maintaining neuronal health and disease prevention. Abnormal NPD1 signalling is 
associated with neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and neuronal apoptosis, 
which in turn contribute significantly to the progression of neurological 
disorders. Understanding these pathways offers insights into potential 
therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting NPD1 to mitigate neurodegenerative 
processes and facilitate neural repair. The efforts in developing NPD1 analogs 
or mimetics are focused on enhancing endogenous NPD1 levels, attenuating 
neuroinflammation, and preserving neuronal integrity in disease contexts. This 
review provides a comprehensive exploration of NPD1, encompassing its structural 
characteristics, biochemical pathways, physiological roles, pathophysiological 
implications, and potential therapeutic applications in neurological disorders. 
Further, research into elucidating the precise mechanisms of NPD1 reveals that 
its clinical efficacy is crucial for harnessing its full potential as a 
therapeutic tool for neuroprotection and neural repair.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the neurodegenerative disorders, 
characterized by complex pathogenic mechanisms, including the deposition of 
beta-amyloid protein and hyperphosphorylation of Tau protein. There is currently 
a lack of effective therapeutic approaches for AD treatment. The aim of this 
study was to design exosomes (EXO) as a specifically designed carrier able to 
carry Curcumin (Cur) and Methylene Blue (MB) to improve cognitive function and 
to elucidate its underlying mechanisms. Our study results indicated that 
EXO-Cur+MB inhibited Tau protein phosphorylation by activating the AKT/GSK-3β 
pathway, while reversing cognitive dysfunction in AD mice by reducing apoptosis 
induced by okadaic acid (OA). Thus, our results suggested that EXO-Cur+MB would 
be of potential use for the treatment of AD.

BACKGROUND: Amyloid-β protein (Aβ) accumulation is a defining characteristic of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), resulting in neurodegeneration and a decline in 
cognitive function. Given orexin's well-documented role in enhancing memory and 
cognition, this study investigates its potential to regulate Aβ-induced 
neurotoxicity, offering new perspectives into AD management.
METHODS: This paper simulated Aβ accumulation in the hippocampus of AD patients 
by administering Aβ1-42 oligomers into the bilateral hippocampal dentate gyrus 
of ICR mice. Inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α) and orexin-A levels were 
measured by ELISA. Additionally, the excitability of orexinergic neurons was 
assessed by IHC targeting c-Fos expression. These methodologies evaluated the 
Aβ-induced neuroinflammation, orexinergic system functionality, and 
dexamethasone's (Dex) effects on these processes.
RESULTS: Injection of Aβ1-42 oligomer resulted in elevated levels of IL-6, 
TNF-α, and orexin-A in the hippocampus, as well as increased excitability of 
orexinergic neurons in the lateral hypothalamus (LH). Dex treatment reduced 
neuroinflammation, causing a reduction in orexin-A levels and the excitability 
of orexinergic neurons.
CONCLUSION: Aβ-induced neuroinflammation is accompanied by enhanced levels of 
orexin-A and orexinergic neuron excitability. These findings suggest that the 
enhanced functionality of the orexinergic system may become a compensatory 
neuroprotective mechanism to counteract neuroinflammation and enhance cognitive 
function.

A therapeutic role for a regulatory glucose transporter1 (Glut1)-associated 
natural antisense transcript.

Tang M, Teng S, Peng Y, Kim AY, Canoll P, Bruce JN, Faust PL, Adhikari K, De 
Vivo DC, Monani UR.

The mammalian brain relies primarily on glucose for its energy needs. Delivery 
of this nutrient to the brain is mediated by the glucose transporter-1 (Glut1) 
protein. Low Glut1 thwarts glucose entry into the brain, causing an energy 
crisis and, triggering, in one instance, the debilitating neurodevelopmental 
condition - Glut1 deficiency syndrome (Glut1DS). Current treatments for Glut1DS 
are sub-optimal, as none address the root cause - low Glut1 - of the condition. 
Levels of this transporter must respond rapidly to the brain's changing energy 
requirements. This necessitates fine-tuning its expression. Here we describe a 
long-noncoding RNA (lncRNA) antisense to Glut1 and show that it is involved in 
such regulation. Raising levels of the lncRNA had a concordant effect on Glut1 
in cultured human cells and transgenic mice; reducing levels elicited the 
opposite effect. Delivering the lncRNA to Glut1DS model mice via viral vectors 
induced Glut1 expression, enhancing brain glucose levels to mitigate disease. 
Direct delivery of such a lncRNA to combat disease has not been reported 
previously and constitutes a unique therapeutic paradigm. Moreover, considering 
the importance of maintaining homeostatic Glut1 levels, calibrating transporter 
expression via the lncRNA could become broadly relevant to the myriad 
conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, wherein Glut1 concentrations are 
perturbed.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia is characterized by significant molecular and 
phenotypic heterogeneity, which confounds its mechanistic understanding, 
diagnosis, and effective treatment. In this study, we harness the most 
comprehensive dataset of paired ante-mortem blood omics, clinical, 
psychological, and post-mortem brain multi-omics data and neuroimaging to 
extensively characterize and translate the molecular taxonomy of AD dementia to 
living individuals. First, utilizing a comprehensive integration of eight 
complementary molecular layers from brain multi-omics data (N = 1,189), we 
identified three distinct molecular AD dementia subtypes exhibiting strong 
associations with cognitive decline, sex, psychological traits, brain 
morphology, and characterized by specific cellular and molecular drivers 
involving immune, vascular, and oligodendrocyte precursor cells. Next, in a 
significant translational effort, we developed predictive models to convert 
these advanced brain-derived molecular profiles (AD dementia pseudotimes and 
subtypes) into blood-, MRI- and psychological traits-based markers. The 
translation results underscore both the promise of these models and the 
opportunities for further enhancement. Our findings enhance the understanding of 
AD heterogeneity, underscore the value of multi-scale molecular approaches for 
elucidating causal mechanisms, and lay the groundwork for the development of 
novel therapies in living persons that target multi-level brain molecular 
subtypes of AD dementia.

BACKGROUND: Several health conditions are known to increase the risk of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). We aim to systematically identify medical conditions 
that are associated with subsequent development of AD by leveraging the growing 
resources of electronic health records (EHRs).
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used de-identified EHRs from two 
independent databases (MarketScan and VUMC) with 153 million individuals to 
identify AD cases and age- and gender-matched controls. By tracking their EHRs 
over a 10-year window before AD diagnosis and comparing the EHRs between AD 
cases and controls, we identified medical conditions that occur more likely in 
those who later develop AD. We further assessed the genetic underpinnings of 
these conditions in relation to AD genetics using data from two large-scale 
biobanks (BioVU and UK Biobank, total N=450,000).
RESULTS: We identified 43,508 AD cases and 419,455 matched controls in 
MarketScan, and 1,320 AD cases and 12,720 matched controls in VUMC. We detected 
406 and 102 medical phenotypes that are significantly enriched among the future 
AD cases in MarketScan and VUMC databases, respectively. In both EHR databases, 
mental disorders and neurological disorders emerged as the top two most enriched 
clinical categories. More than 70 medical phenotypes are replicated in both EHR 
databases, which are dominated by mental disorders (e.g., depression), 
neurological disorders (e.g., sleep orders), circulatory system disorders (e.g. 
cerebral atherosclerosis) and endocrine/metabolic disorders (e.g., type 2 
diabetes). We identified 19 phenotypes that are either associated with 
individual risk variants of AD or a polygenic risk score of AD.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, analysis of longitudinal EHRs from independent 
large-scale databases enables robust identification of health conditions 
associated with subsequent development of AD, highlighting potential 
opportunities of therapeutics and interventions to reduce AD risk.

BACKGROUND: Chronic alcohol drinking is a modifiable risk factor for Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), but underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Most studies 
of alcohol feeding to AD mice have utilized young mice and delivered alcohol in 
drinking water without controlling nutritional intake.
OBJECTIVE: To study the impact of Lieber-DeCarli (LDC) liquid alcohol diet, 
which balances nutritional intake, on AD pathology of aged Tg2576 and wild-type 
(WT) mice, which is unexplored.
METHODS: 13-month-old male and female Tg2576 or WT mice were fed LDC diet (5% 
ethanol or control) for six weeks (n = 11-13/group). Exploration (open-field 
test) and spatial reference memory (Y-maze test) were assessed after six weeks, 
and brains and livers were studied for Aβ levels, and Aβ synthesis and transport 
proteins (APP and LRP-1). Neuroinflammation, blood-brain barrier function, and 
synaptic health were studied using immunoassays.
RESULTS: LDC alcohol feeding significantly reduced survival (p < 0.05) and 
spatial memory (p < 0.05) in Tg2576 mice, but not in WT mice. Alcohol feeding 
increased (p < 0.001) insoluble endogenous mouse Aβ1-42 and reduced microgliosis 
(p < 0.05) in Tg2576 mice brains, but not in WT mice. LDC alcohol feeding to 
Tg2576 mice caused mild liver injury, and important amyloidosis-relevant hepatic 
proteins (LRP-1 and APP) were largely unaltered. However, brain Aβ and 
microgliosis were positively correlated (p < 0.05) with serum alanine 
aminotransferase, a marker of liver injury, in Tg2576 mice.
CONCLUSION: Chronic alcohol intake, resulting in mild liver injury, caused 
modest but significant AD-relevant changes in aged Tg2576 mice, which correlated 
with liver injury; the latter suggests significant liver-brain crosstalk in an 
AD model of moderate alcohol intake.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by cognitive decline, memory loss, and behavioral changes. Despite 
being the most common cause of dementia, effective treatments have been elusive. 
However, recent years have witnessed significant advancements in understanding 
and treating Alzheimer's. Key to these advancements is the shift toward targeted 
therapies tailored to individual genetic and biomarker profiles, promising more 
effective outcomes while minimizing side effects. The integration of advanced 
neuroimaging techniques has revolutionized early diagnosis and disease 
monitoring, enabling proactive intervention strategies that may alter disease 
trajectories. This review provides an overview of these advancements, focusing 
on disease-modifying therapies, symptomatic treatments, combination therapies, 
lifestyle interventions, biomarker development, innovative drug delivery 
systems, immunotherapy, gene therapy, and neuroprotective agents.

Publisher: A doença de Alzheimer (DA) é um transtorno neurodegenerativo 
progressivo caracterizado por declínio cognitivo, perda de memória e mudanças 
comportamentais. Apesar de ser a causa mais comum de demência, tratamentos 
eficazes têm sido difíceis de encontrar. No entanto, nos últimos anos, houve 
avanços significativos na compreensão e no tratamento da DA. Um aspecto 
fundamental desses avanços é a mudança para terapias direcionadas, adaptadas aos 
perfis genéticos e biomarcadores individuais, prometendo resultados mais 
eficazes e ao mesmo tempo minimizando os efeitos colaterais. A integração de 
técnicas avançadas de neuroimagem revolucionou o diagnóstico precoce e o 
monitoramento da doença, possibilitando estratégias de intervenção proativas que 
podem alterar as trajetórias da doença. Esta revisão oferece uma visão geral 
desses avanços, com foco em terapias modificadoras da doença, tratamentos 
sintomáticos, terapias combinadas, intervenções no estilo de vida, 
desenvolvimento de biomarcadores, novas vias de administração de medicamentos, 
imunoterapia, terapia genética e agentes neuroprotetores.

Alzheimer disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder. Evidence suggests that 
AD shares pathophysiological similarities with type 2 diabetes. Intranasal 
insulin (INI) has emerged as a potential therapeutic approach for AD by directly 
targeting the brain and modulating insulin signaling pathways.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of INI therapy for AD through a 
systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
METHODS: A search of electronic databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, 
Scopus, and Embase, was conducted to identify relevant studies published up to 
June 2024. Inclusion criteria encompassed peer-reviewed original research 
articles focused on humans, investigating the therapeutic effects of INI 
administration on cognitive impairment associated with AD, and reporting 
quantitative data on cognitive outcomes, biomarkers, or pathological markers 
relevant to AD. A meta-analysis was conducted to quantitatively synthesize the 
effects of INI on cognitive outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 647 articles were identified, and eight studies met the 
inclusion criteria. The overall odds ratio was 3.75 (95%CI 1.49-9.40). The test 
for overall effect showed a statistically significant difference (p<0.05). 
However, the I2 value indicated a high level of heterogeneity (85.5%), 
suggesting significant variability among the studies.
CONCLUSION: While the current data is not yet conclusive enough to definitively 
establish INI as a standard treatment for AD, the evidence supporting its 
safety, efficacy, and reduced risk of systemic side effects suggests potential 
cognitive benefits for improving global cognition in patients with AD.

Publisher: A Doença de Alzheimer (DA) é um transtorno neurodegenerativo. 
Evidências sugerem que a DA compartilha semelhanças fisiopatológicas com o 
diabetes tipo 2. A insulina intranasal (IIN) surgiu como uma abordagem 
terapêutica potencial para a DA, agindo diretamente no cérebro e modulando as 
vias de sinalização da insulina.
OBJETIVO: Avaliar a eficácia e a segurança da terapia com IIN para a DA por meio 
de uma revisão sistemática e metanálise de ensaios clínicos randomizados.
MÉTODOS: Realizou-se uma busca nas bases de dados eletrônicas PubMed, Web of 
Science, Scopus e Embase, para identificar estudos relevantes publicados até 
junho de 2024. Critérios de inclusão: artigos originais de periódicos revisados 
por pares, focados em humanos, que investigassem os efeitos terapêuticos da 
administração de IIN no comprometimento cognitivo associado à DA e que 
relatassem dados quantitativos sobre resultados cognitivos, biomarcadores ou 
marcadores patológicos relevantes para a DA. Uma metanálise foi realizada para 
sintetizar quantitativamente os efeitos da IIN nos desfechos cognitivos.
RESULTADOS: Foram identificados 647 artigos e oito estudos atenderam aos 
critérios de inclusão. A razão de chances geral foi de 3,75 (IC95% 1,49–9,40). O 
teste para o efeito global mostrou diferença estatisticamente significativa 
(p<0,05). O valor de I2 indicou alta heterogeneidade (85,5%), sugerindo 
variabilidade significativa entre os estudos incluídos.
CONCLUSÃO: Embora os dados atuais ainda não sejam conclusivos o suficiente para 
estabelecer definitivamente a IIN como tratamento padrão para a DA, as 
evidências que apoiam sua segurança, eficácia e redução do risco de efeitos 
colaterais sistêmicos sugerem um potencial benefício para melhorar a cognição 
global em pacientes com DA.

The Vacuolar Protein Sorting 35 (VPS35)-Retromer complex plays a pivotal role in 
intracellular protein trafficking and recycling. As an integral component of the 
Retromer complex, VPS35 selectively recognizes and retrogradely transports 
membrane protein receptors to the trans-Golgi network, thereby preventing the 
degradation of transmembrane proteins by lysosomes after they have fulfilled 
their physiological functions, and facilitating their continued activity. VPS35 
regulates autophagy, mitophagy, mitochondrial homeostasis, and various other 
biological processes, including epidermal regeneration, neuronal iron 
homeostasis, and synaptic function. Studies have shown that mutations or 
dysfunctions in VPS35 disrupt the normal operation of Retromer, impair neuronal 
health and survival, and contribute to the onset of neurodegenerative diseases 
such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. Additionally, VPS35 modulates 
tumor growth and metastasis in cancers such as liver and breast cancer through 
the regulation of multiple signaling pathways. Targeting VPS35 might be a 
potential therapy in clinic treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and cancers.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with limited 
therapeutic options, largely due to challenges in delivering drugs across the 
blood-brain barrier (BBB). In this study, we synthesized folic acid (FA) 
conjugated amphiphilic copolymers via reversible addition-fragmentation chain 
transfer (RAFT) polymerization to enhance the targeted delivery of donepezil 
(DZP) to the brain. The copolymers were self-assembled into micelles and 
extensively characterized for their size, zeta potential, and stability using 
dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The 
micelles were further evaluated for their ability to cross an in vitro BBB model 
and their cellular uptake by brain endothelial cells. FA conjugation was 
employed to exploit the folate receptor-mediated transport mechanism, which has 
shown potential for improving drug delivery across the BBB. This study 
demonstrates the feasibility of using FA functionalized micelles as a targeted 
delivery system, offering potential advancements in the treatment of Alzheimer's 
disease.

Alzheimer's and related diseases are marked by a progressive cognitive decline 
that affects a person's identity, values and decision-making abilities. 
Anticipating choices and projecting oneself into the future becomes difficult. 
Advance directives and the testimony of the trusted support person and loved 
ones can sometimes be at odds with the new choices expressed by the patient at a 
more advanced stage of the illness. This makes it difficult to make the right 
decision with or for the patient. Advance care planning is an interesting tool 
in this context. It makes it possible to anticipate the care and life project in 
a dynamic and ongoing way, ensuring communication over time and considering 
gradual changes in values. This narrative ethics approach helps to bridge the 
gap between the wishes expressed in the past and those expressed today, by 
involving the patient throughout the course of the illness and relying on the 
support of loved ones and healthcare professionals. Its implementation and 
deployment require training for healthcare professionals and a genuine 
institutional policy.

Alzheimer's disease leads family members to resort to several types of care in 
order to eventually cure the patient. The aim of this study is to investigate 
the care practices used by families in Abidjan whose relative suffers from 
Alzheimer's disease, despite their lack of knowledge of the symptoms and care 
practices involved. This saturation procedure enabled us to gather information 
from 20 family carers, whose main role was to provide care for the patient. Five 
interviews were conducted over the telephone and 15 in the patients' or 
caregivers' homes. This enabled us to identify the ways in which families 
organize themselves to cope with illness: 1) social and symbolic practices; 2) 
economic resources; 3) family flexibility. This study highlights the family's 
capacity for resilience in the face of a member's illness.

To date, there has been no effective treatment available for the Alzheimer's 
disease (AD); hence, novel compounds with AD inhibitory effects are highly 
desirable. Huperzine A (HupA), a natural Lycopodium alkaloid, is a potent 
acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor for AD treatment. In this study, HupA 
derivatives, huperzil, N-hippurylhuperzine A, pyrrolhuperzine A, 
maleicamide-huperzine A and phthaleicamide-huperzine A, were synthesized and 
their in silico computation as the central nervous system (CNS) drug was 
performed. All derivatives exhibited lower anti-AChE activity than HupA. 
However, we found other non-cholinergic functions in AD-mimicking models using 
differentiated SH-SY5Y. HupA and derivatives significantly suppressed the 
Aβ25-35 cytotoxicity and showed recovery effects against arsenic- induced AD 
pathologies including reactive oxygen species generation, neurite outgrowth 
shortening, amyloid precursor protein suppression and the elevation of 
β-secretase, endogenous Aβ peptide, and Tau and neurofilament light proteins. In 
summary, we prepared three potential compounds with dual-AChE cholinergic and 
non-cholinergic functions. Further development of these compounds will be 
beneficial for the future use as an alternate compound against AD.

Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are characterized by progressive neuronal 
dysfunction and anatomical changes caused by neuron loss and gliosis, ultimately 
leading to severe declines in brain function. While these disorders arise from a 
variety of pathological mechanisms, a common molecular feature is the 
accumulation of misfolded proteins, which occurs both inside and outside 
neurons. For example, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is defined by extracellular 
β-amyloid plaques and intracellular tau neurofibrillary tangles. These 
pathological protein aggregates are often resistant to traditional small 
molecule drugs. Recent advances in proximity-inducing chimeras such as 
proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs), lysosome-targeting chimeras (LYTACs), 
autophagy-targeted chimeras (AUTOTACs), dephosphorylation-targeting chimeras 
(DEPTACs) and ribonuclease-targeting chimeras (RIBOTACs) offer promising 
strategies to eliminate pathological proteins or mRNAs through intracellular 
degradation pathways. These innovative approaches open avenues for developing 
new therapies for NDDs. In this review we summarize the regulatory mechanisms of 
protein aggregation, highlight the advancements in proximity-inducing modalities 
for NDDs, and discuss the current challenges and future directions in 
therapeutic development.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers have been widely adopted in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) diagnosis. However, no studies focused on the application of CSF 
biomarkers in the clinical practice of complex and atypical patients with 
cognitive impairment in China. This study aimed to evaluate the added value of 
CSF AD biomarkers in cognitively impaired patients with complex conditions in a 
memory clinical setting. A total of 633 participants were included from the 
National Center for Neurological Disorders in Shanghai, China. The CSF AD 
biomarkers were measured with ELISA. Cutoff values were firstly identified using 
Youden's index. The neurologists proposed etiology diagnosis with a percentage 
estimate of their confidence and prescribed medication before and after CSF 
disclosure. Changes in etiological diagnosis, diagnostic confidence, and 
management plan were compared across the groups. Of the 633 patients (mean [SD] 
age, 61.1 [11.3] years; 295 males [46.6%]), 372 (58.8%) were diagnosed with 
dementia, 103 (16.3%) with mild cognitive impairment, and 158 (24.9%) with 
subjective cognitive decline. Using those pre-defined cutoffs, we categorized 
patients into 3 groups: Alzheimer's continuum (68.1%), non-AD pathologic change 
(11.1%), and normal AD biomarkers (20.8%). After CSF disclosure, the proposed 
etiology changed in 158 (25.0%) participants and the prescribed medication 
changed in 200 (31.6%) patients. Mean diagnostic confidence increased from 
69.5-83.0% (+13.5%; P < 0.001). In conclusion, CSF AD biomarkers significantly 
impacted the diagnosis, diagnostic confidence, and treatment plans for Chinese 
patients with complex cognitive impairment. CSF AD biomarkers are a useful tool 
for clinicians beyond routine clinical assessment.

INTRODUCTION: Transgenic mice overexpressing familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
mutations (FAD) show non-physiological traits, and their immunocompetent 
backgrounds limit their use in AD immunotherapy research. Preclinical models 
that reflect human immune responses in AD are needed.
METHODS: Using CRISPR-Cas9, we developed single (NA) and double (NAPS) knock-in 
(KI) amyloid precursor protein (APP)KM670,671NL (Swedish) and presenilin 1 (PS 
1)M146VFAD mutations on an immunodeficient NOG 
(NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidIl2rgtm1Sug/JicTac) background. The models were confirmed by 
Sanger sequencing and evaluated for AD-like pathology.
RESULTS: Both NA and NAPS mice developed pathology without overexpression 
artifacts. Mutation-induced upregulation of APP-CTF-β led to intraneuronal human 
amyloid beta (Aβ) (6E10) deposits and amyloid-associated microgliosis as early 
as 3 months, which increased with age. The addition of the PS 1M146V mutation 
doubled the amyloid load. The models displayed broad neuronal loss, resulting in 
brain atrophy in older mice.
DISCUSSION: These models replicate intraneuronal amyloid pathology and, with 
human immune reconstitution potential, enable novel studies of human immune 
responses in AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: A novel Alzheimer's disease (AD) knock-in (KI) mouse was developed 
and characterized on an immunodeficient NOG background. The model provides a 
platform for human immune studies and the evaluation of immunotherapies for AD. 
The KI mice demonstrate intraneuronal Aβ deposits and amyloid-associated 
microglial reactions. KI mice demonstrate extensive neuronal loss. Human immune 
reconstitution enables studies of infectious AD co-morbidities, such as the 
human immunodeficiency and herpes simplex viruses.

In this study, a lipid disorder Alzheimer's disease (AD) model was developed 
with high-fat diet and D-galactose injected intraperitoneally (HFD & D-gal) to 
evaluate the activities of Buyang Huanwu Decoction (BYHWD) compared with 
donepezil hydrochloride. The learning and memory abilities of BYHWD were 
evaluated by Morris water maze test (MWM). The lipid levels in serum, 
histopathology, and immunohistochemistry of hyperphosphorylated tau protein in 
hippocampal neurons were conducted to prove the therapy effects of BYHWD. After 
the identification of constituents absorbed into the brain using LC-MS, 
UPLC-TQ-MS was employed to analyze endogenous lipid metabolites in the 
hippocampi of mice. Based on the validated differential markers identified 
through lipidomics analysis, we further substantiated potential therapeutic 
pathway of BYHWD through the application of molecular docking technology. The 
mechanism underlying BYHWD was subsequently confirmed by palmitic acid-injured 
HT22 cells. The results showed that BYHWD significantly improved the cognitive 
deficits and regulated the lipid levels of HFD & D-gal mice. BYHWD also 
protected the neuronal cell condition of hippocampal neurons, increased the 
density of dendritic spines, and reduced the expression of P-tau. Lipidomics 
revealed that 41 differential lipid metabolites were retuned after BYHWD 
administration, and this change may be related to the PPARγ pathway. 
Calycosin-7-glucoside showed good interaction with PPARγ in vivo composition 
analysis. Calycosin-7-glucoside increased the mRNA expression levels of lipid 
metabolism-related enzymes and PPARγ, as well as the expression of PPARγ protein 
in vitro study. BYHWD activated the PPARγ pathway to induce peroxisome 
proliferation and regulated lipid metabolism disorders in the AD mice brain.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative 
disease for causing memory deficits and primarily characterized by extracellular 
deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles 
(NFTs), and hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, all are pathological hallmarks 
for AD. Transthyretin (TTR) is a highly conserved homo-tetrameric protein, 
primarily synthesized in liver and choroid plexus, and most importantly involved 
in transport of T3-T4 hormones and retinol.
OBJECTIVES: This review explores the dual role of TTR, with a greater emphasis 
on its neuroprotective action, particularly in AD.
METHODS: Based on the available literature, TTR's potential as a biomarker in 
the central nervous system (CNS), focusing its role in stabilizing Aβ 
aggregation and the senile plaque formation during neurodegeneration. 
Additionally, TTR's dual roles, in neurodegeneration and neuroprotection are 
studied, emphasizing its potential for improving AD diagnosis and treatment 
strategies.
RESULTS: Recent research has revealed that TTR is gradually showcasing its 
promise in neuroprotection and neuronal viability in AD by binding with Aβ and 
mitigating its neurotoxic effects. Current preclinical and clinical studies also 
support that TTR is actively involved in maintaining the blood-brain barrier 
(BBB) integrity and maintain neurotransmitter balance, all of which offer 
significant therapeutic promise through TTR stabilizers, such as Tafamidis, 
Acoramidis, and Vutrisiran, highlighting their potential in AD treatment 
CONCLUSION: This review concludes that TTR plays bidirectional role and gaining 
interest as a potential biomarker, though several challenges must be addressed 
before it can be established a novel therapeutic target in AD management in the 
modern era of drug discovery.

Loss of memory is the main feature of dementia, accompanied by personality 
changes. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent type of dementia 
globally and a major contributor to disability and mortality in older 
individuals. Most notably, the neurological damage caused by AD is irreversible, 
but the current market still lacks effective medications for the treatment of 
dementia. Numerous research studies have indicated that the inflammatory 
response is significantly involved in the development of cognitive impairment, 
and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in healthy people increases the 
likelihood of future AD. CRP is a nonspecific indicator of inflammation. In 
clinical practice, CRP has long been proven to be one of the risk factors and 
powerful predictors of neurodegenerative diseases. Given the accessibility and 
cost-effectiveness of CRP testing, it is reasonable to anticipate its 
utilisation for early screening and monitoring the progression of AD in the 
future. This review therefore focuses on the specific relationship between CRP 
and various types of dementia and explores how CRP contributes to cognitive 
impairment.

As people age, Alzheimer's disease, a neurological disorder that develops 
gradually, affects their memory and cognitive abilities. The two hallmarks of 
Alzheimer's disease are intracellular buildup of neurofibrillary tangles and 
extracellular β-amyloid plaques. In this work, the effects of Perillyl alcohol 
on experimental sporadic Alzheimer-type dementia produced by 
intracerebroventricular streptozotocin were investigated. Rats that received 
streptozotocin infusion experienced cholinergic hypofunction, increased 
oxidative-nitritive stress, and impaired memory and learning. Between 15 and 27 
days following the initial streptozotocin infusion, 13 days of treatment with 
Perillyl alcohol (25, 50, and 100 mg/kg p.o.) significantly improved learning 
and memory in Morris water maze and object recognition test paradigms. Perillyl 
also significantly reduced oxidative-nitritive stress, as seen by a decrease in 
malondialdehyde and nitrite, and restored reduced glutathione and catalase 
levels. Acetylcholinesterase activity significantly increased in the current 
model, indicating cholinergic hypofunction and enhanced neuronal cell damage. 
Treatment with Perillyl alcohol also significantly decreased the increase in 
acetylcholinesterase activity, indicating that Perillyl alcohol may be able to 
prevent neuronal damage and restore cholinergic functions. Perillyl alcohol has 
been shown to improve spatial memory processing, which may be due to its 
antioxidant properties and capacity to restore cholinergic functioning. However, 
more study is required to understand the molecular mechanisms of POH that 
enhance cognition or prevent neurotoxic damage, which could support its 
application in neuroprotective effect.

BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence implicates both the brain-spleen axis and the 
gut microbiota-brain axis in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. While our 
previous work demonstrated heterophyllin B (HB) rectifies splenic Th1/Th2 
imbalance and ameliorates cognitive deficits in Aβ1-42-induced AD mice, its 
potential modulation of the vagus nerve-spleen circuit remains unexplored.
METHODS: Using 8-month-old male APP/PS1 mice with/without splenic denervation 
(SD), we systematically investigated HB's therapeutic mechanisms via the 
spleen-gut microbiota-brain axis. Cognitive function was assessed through novel 
object recognition (ORT) and object location memory (OLT) tests. 
Immunofluorescence (IF) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were 
employed to analyze Aβ plaques, phosphorylated tau (p-Tau) levels, and 
associated neuroinflammatory responses. Flow cytometry was utilized to examine 
the subtypes of splenic lymphocytes. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, along 
with immunohistochemical (IHC) experiments, was conducted to evaluate the 
protective effects of HB on the intestinal barrier. Gut microbiota composition 
was analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing.
RESULTS: HB administration significantly improved cognitive performance (ORT 
discrimination index: +28.7 %; OLT discrimination index: +26.6 %), reduced brain 
and serum Aβ1-42 and p-Tau levels, downregulated the Th1/Th2 ratio in the 
spleen, and alleviated intestinal permeability and neuroinflammation, which were 
abolished in SD APP/PS1 mice. Gut microbiota shifts showed HB-induced enrichment 
of cognition-associated Dubosiella and Muribaculaceae, with concurrent 
suppression of pathogenic Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136 and ASF356.
CONCLUSION: This study provides first evidence that HB ameliorates AD pathology 
through vagus nerve-dependent regulation of the spleen-gut microbiota-brain 
axis, establishing its multimodal therapeutic potential for neural-immune-gut 
circuit modulation in neurodegenerative diseases.

BACKGROUND: Despite the increasing approval of antiamyloid antibodies for 
Alzheimer disease (AD), their clinical relevance and risk-benefit profile remain 
uncertain. The heterogeneity of AD and the limited availability of long-term 
clinical data make it difficult to establish a clear rationale for selecting one 
treatment over another.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work was to assess and compare the efficacy and 
safety of antiamyloid antibodies through an interactive online meta-analytic 
approach by performing conventional pair-wise meta-analyses and frequentist and 
Bayesian network meta-analyses of phase II and III clinical trial results. To 
achieve this, we developed AlzMeta.app 2.0, a freely accessible web application 
that enables researchers and clinicians to evaluate the relative and absolute 
risks and benefits of these therapies in real time, incorporating different 
prior choices and assumptions of baseline risks of disease progression and 
adverse events.
METHODS: We adhered to PRISMA-NMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for reporting of systematic reviews with 
network meta-analysis) and GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, 
Development, and Evaluation) guidelines for reporting and rating the certainty 
of evidence. Clinical trial reports (until September 30, 2024) were retrieved 
from PubMed, Google Scholar, and clinical trial databases (including 
ClinicalTrials.gov). Studies with <20 sporadic AD patients and a modified Jadad 
score <3 were excluded. Risk of bias was assessed with the RoB-2 tool. Relative 
risks and benefits have been expressed as risk ratios and standardized mean 
differences, with confidence, credible, and prediction intervals calculated for 
all outcomes. For significant results, the intervention effects were ranked in 
frequentist and Bayesian frameworks, and their clinical relevance was determined 
by the absolute risk per 1000 people and number needed to treat (NNT) for a wide 
range of control responses.
RESULTS: Among 7 treatments tested in 21,236 patients (26 studies with low risk 
of bias or with some concerns), donanemab was the best-ranked treatment on 
cognitive and functional measures, and it was almost 2 times more effective than 
aducanumab and lecanemab and significantly more beneficial than other treatments 
on the global (cognitive and functional) Clinical Dementia Rating Scale-Sum of 
Boxes (NNT=10, 95% CI 8-16). Special caution is required regarding cerebral 
edema and microbleeding due to the clinically relevant risks of edema for 
donanemab (NNT=8, 95% CI 5-16), aducanumab (NNT=10, 95% CI 6-17), and lecanemab 
(NNT=14, 95% CI 7-31), which may outweigh the benefits.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that donanemab is more effective and has a 
safety profile similar to aducanumab and lecanemab, highlighting the need for 
treatment options with improved safety. Potential bias may have been introduced 
in the included trials due to unblinding caused by frequent cerebral edema and 
microbleeds, as well as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the 
accumulation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain, 
leading to distinctive patterns of neuronal dysfunction and the cognitive 
decline emblematic of dementia. Currently, over 5 million individuals aged 65 
and above are living with AD in the United States, a number projected to rise by 
2050. Traditional diagnostic methods are fraught with challenges, including low 
accuracy and a significant propensity for misdiagnosis. In response to these 
diagnostic challenges, our study develops and evaluates an innovative deep 
learning (DL) ensemble model that integrates features from three pre-trained 
models-VGG16, MobileNet, and InceptionResNetV2-for the precise identification of 
AD markers from MRI scans. This approach aims to overcome the limitations of 
individual models in handling varying image shapes and textures, thereby 
improving diagnostic accuracy. The ultimate goal is to support primary 
radiologists by streamlining the diagnostic process, facilitating early 
detection, and enabling timely treatment of AD. Upon rigorous evaluation, our 
ensemble model demonstrated superior performance over contemporary classifiers, 
achieving a notable accuracy of 97.93%, along with a specificity of 98.04%, 
sensitivity of 95.89%, precision of 95.94%, and an F1-score of 87.50%. These 
results not only underscore the efficacy of the ensemble approach but also 
highlight the potential for DL to revolutionize AD diagnosis, offering a 
promising pathway to more accurate, early detection and intervention.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Diagnosing the different variants of primary 
progressive aphasia (PPA) is challenging, but more accurate characterization can 
improve patient management and treatment outcomes. This study aimed to identify 
the following: (1) which speech features, alone or combined with language 
assessment and gray matter volumes (GMVs), best distinguish PPA variants and (2) 
how connected speech evolves in PPA.
METHODS: This prospective study was conducted at IRCCS San Raffaele Hospital in 
Milan, Italy, between 2010 and 2021. We included patients with PPA who underwent 
neuropsychological assessments, including standard evaluation of language and 
the "Picnic Scene" speech test, and, when available, brain structural MRI. 
Clinical and language assessments were also performed at follow-up in a 
subgroup. Sequential feature selection models identified speech parameters that 
best differentiated groups, incorporating age, sex, education, standard language 
tests, and GMVs. In each PPA group, linear mixed-effect models analyzed speech 
changes over time.
RESULTS: We included 95 patients with PPA (mean age 69 ± 9 years, 55 women 
[58%]; 40 with nonfluent variant PPA [nfvPPA], 35 with semantic variant PPA 
[svPPA], 20 with logopenic variant PPA [lvPPA]), of whom 82 underwent brain MRI 
and 34 had a follow-up visit after 10.2 months. Each model distinguished svPPA 
from the other PPA groups with high accuracy (R2 range 0.93-1.00; p < 0.001). No 
differences in accuracy were observed among models for this distinction. In 
differentiating nfvPPA and lvPPA groups, the models incorporating speech 
parameters (R2 = 0.92; p < 0.001), GMVs (R2 = 0.95; p < 0.001), and their 
combination (speech + GMVs; R2 = 0.97; p < 0.001) outperformed those using only 
standard language scores (R2 = 0.75; p = 0.01). Over time, patients with nfvPPA 
showed more phonological errors, the svPPA group exhibited more semantic and 
morphosyntactic errors along with difficulties in naming and syntax production, 
and patients with lvPPA exhibited reduced number of words per second and fewer 
words per sentence.
DISCUSSION: All models were equally effective in distinguishing the svPPA group 
from the other 2 PPA subtypes. However, compared with using standard measures 
alone, incorporating speech measures from the "Picnic Scene" speech test, GMVs, 
or their combination into the models significantly improved accuracy in 
differentiating nfvPPA and lvPPA groups. The PPA variants showed distinct speech 
trajectories. These variables can aid in understanding disease progression, 
predicting patient outcomes, and planning speech therapy interventions in 
clinical practice.

Through bibliometric analysis, trends in international acupuncture clinical 
development, key research areas, and current scientific issues were identified 
based on literature published from 2013 to 2022. Literature on acupuncture in 
clinical settings was retrieved and analyzed in this study utilizing the Web of 
Science database. A visualization analysis of the scientific landscape was 
performed using CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and GraphPad Prism. General statistics 
regarding the literature were examined, encompassing annual publication trends, 
citation frequencies, journal distributions, distributions across subject 
fields. Co-occurrence and cluster analyses of authors, countries, institutions, 
high-quality literature, and keywords were performed to explore the 
developmental trends, hotspots, and frontiers in acupuncture research 
comprehensively and intuitively. A total of 4554 studies were included, with an 
increasing trend in the number of publications related to the annual acupuncture 
Scientific Citation Index (SCI). The impact factors of the top 10 journals were 
mostly 1 to 3 points. The 10 most cited articles primarily concentrated on the 
use of acupuncture for pain-related disorders. Acupuncture and 
electroacupuncture are the dominant keywords, with terms such as "ischemic 
stroke" and "Alzheimer's disease" emerging from 2019 to 2022. From 2013 to 2022, 
the output of clinical SCI literature on acupuncture increased, acupuncture 
research gradually gained international recognition, and China gradually moved 
toward a dominant position. The most significant clinical research area of 
acupuncture is its application for analgesia, particularly through acupuncture 
and electroacupuncture. Future research directions may include the treatment of 
knee osteoarthritis, cognitive disorders, and assisted reproduction utilizing 
acupuncture.

The development of age-related neurodegenerative diseases is associated with the 
accumulation of damaged and misfolded proteins. Such proteins are eliminated 
from cells by proteolytic systems, mainly by 20S proteasomes, whose activity 
declines with age. Its stimulation has been recognized as a promising approach 
to delay the onset or ameliorate the symptoms of neurodegenerative disorders. 
Here we present peptidomimetics that are very effective in stimulating the 
proteasome in biochemical assays and in cell culture. They are stable in human 
plasma and capable of penetrating the cell membranes. The activators 
demonstrated the ability to enhance h20S degradation of α-synuclein and tau, 
whose aggregates are involved in the development of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's 
diseases, respectively. The peptidomimetics did not show cytotoxicity to HEK293T 
and primary hippocampal cells. Additionally, these compounds were highly 
effective in reducing the amount of phosphorylated α-synuclein aggregates in 
hippocampal neurons in a mouse embryonic cell model.

PURPOSE: Cognitive decline and social isolation pose significant challenges to 
the well-being of people with Alzheimer's disease (AD). While recreational 
activities and rehabilitation playthings (RPTs) have demonstrated benefits in 
fostering positive emotions among this population, there remains a scarcity of 
playthings specifically designed to address their unique needs. This study aims 
to develop a conceptual framework for RPTs design to enhance emotional 
well-being in people living with AD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Guided by research question construct classification, 
this study identified three key research questions. A systematic literature 
review was conducted using Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed to address these 
questions. Selected articles were evaluated based on their relevance to RPTs and 
their focus on improving social engagement and positive emotions in individuals 
with AD.
RESULTS: Through meticulous review and analysis, fifty-seven articles were 
selected and systematically categorized into sub-themes include: types of RPTs, 
meaningful activities associated with RPTs, design characteristics, and design 
principles and strategies. The results are further synthesized to formulate a 
potential theoretical proposition for future investigation.
CONCLUSION: The proposed conceptual framework recommends that by integrating 
positive emotion design, compassionate design, co-creation, and suitable play 
experiences in RPTs design could preserve personhood and elicit positive 
emotions among people living with AD.

Plain Language Summary: Integrating positive emotion design into rehabilitation 
playthings can help preserve personhood and elicit positive emotions in AD 
patients. This approach addresses both cognitive decline and emotional 
challenges, contributing to a better quality of life.Designing suitable play 
experiences that are both accessible and enjoyable for AD patients can foster 
meaningful engagement. These playthings can help reduce social isolation by 
encouraging social interaction and participation in recreational activities.The 
proposed conceptual framework provides valuable guidance for designers in 
creating a wider range of rehabilitation playthings specifically for AD 
patients. By focusing on the unique needs of this population, designers can 
develop tools that not only entertain but also rehabilitate and enhance 
emotional well-being.

BACKGROUND: Parkinson disease (PD) has been described and studied extensively in 
White populations, with little known about how the disease manifests and 
progresses in patients from the Black community. Studies investigating disease 
features in Black populations are uncommon, with some suggesting that the Black 
population with PD is more disabled and has greater disease severity and 
different clinical features compared with the White population with PD. These 
health disparities are likely to influence the quality of care for Black 
patients with PD.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the motor and nonmotor symptoms and 
quality of life in Black and White participants with PD in a case-case design.
METHODS: This is an observational, prospective, multicenter, case-case design 
study. Other aims will investigate the management of PD in Black individuals and 
the presence of shared or unique genetic risk factors among the Black PD 
population. A total of 400 Black and 200 White participants with PD will be 
recruited. Data will be collected at 7 US sites and entered into a Research 
Electronic Data Capture database. Linear multivariate regression analysis will 
be used, except for comparing PD management, which will be analyzed using the 
chi-square test or Fisher exact test. Bonferroni correction will be applied. 
This protocol also describes plans for educational programming for clinicians 
and patients at the end of the study in partnership with national PD 
organizations.
RESULTS: The Rush Institutional Review Board approved the project as the 
single-site institutional review board in February 2022, and it was funded by 
the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke in April 2022. 
Recruitment began in July 2022. At the time of submission of this manuscript, 
131 participants had been recruited.
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the largest study of PD phenotype and 
management in Black patients in the United States. The planned collaboration 
with the Global Parkinson's Genetics Program and PD GENEration will enhance our 
understanding of genetic risk factors for PD in this understudied population.

IMPORTANCE: The association between glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists 
(GLP-1RAs) and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) and risk of 
Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRD) remains to be confirmed.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the risk of ADRD associated with GLP-1RAs and SGLT2is in 
people with type 2 diabetes (T2D).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This target trial emulation study used 
electronic health record data from OneFlorida+ Clinical Research Consortium from 
January 2014 to June 2023. Patients were 50 years or older with T2D and no prior 
diagnosis of ADRD or antidementia treatment. Among the 396 963 eligible patients 
with T2D, 33 858 were included in the GLP-1RA vs other glucose-lowering drug 
(GLD) cohort, 34 185 in the SGLT2i vs other GLD cohort, and 24 117 in the 
GLP-1RA vs SGLT2i cohort.
EXPOSURES: Initiation of treatment with a GLP-1RA, SGLT2i, or other second-line 
GLD.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: ADRD was identified using clinical diagnosis codes. 
Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs were estimated using Cox proportional hazard 
regression models with inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) to 
adjust for potential confounders.
RESULTS: This study included 33 858 patients in the GLP-1RA vs other GLD cohort 
(mean age, 65 years; 53.1% female), 34 185 patients in the SGLT2i vs other GLD 
cohort (mean age, 65.8 years; 49.3% female), and 24 117 patients in the GLP-1RA 
vs SGLT2i cohort (mean age, 63.8 years; 51.7% female). In IPTW-weighted cohorts, 
the incidence rate of ADRD was lower in GLP-1RA initiators compared with other 
GLD initiators (rate difference [RD], -2.26 per 1000 person-years [95% CI, -2.88 
to -1.64]), yielding an HR of 0.67 (95% CI, 0.47-0.96). SGLT2i initiators had a 
lower incidence than other GLD initiators (RD, -3.05 per 1000 person-years [95% 
CI, -3.68 to -2.42]), yielding an HR of 0.57 (95% CI, 0.43-0.75). There was no 
difference between GLP-1RAs and SGLT2is, with an RD of -0.09 per 1000 
person-years (95% CI, -0.80 to 0.63) and an HR of 0.97 (95% CI, 0.72-1.32).
CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: In people with T2D, both GLP-1RAs and SGLT2is were 
statistically significantly associated with decreased risk of ADRD compared with 
other GLDs, and no difference was observed between both drugs.

PF4 in rejuvenation therapy: Neuroprotection and cognitive enhancement.

Platelet factor 4 (PF4), a platelet-derived chemokine found in the blood, has 
been identified as a critical factor in modulating the rejuvenation of the aged 
brain. Increasing evidence suggests that PF4 secretion is a prerequisite for the 
cognitive benefits associated with young blood transfusion, the longevity factor 
klotho, and exercise. Systemic administration of exogenous PF4 has been shown to 
reduce circulating pro-aging immune factors and restore peripheral immune 
function in the aged brain by mitigating age-related hippocampal 
neuroinflammation, promoting molecular changes in synaptic plasticity, and 
improving cognitive function in aged mice. Clinically, reduced serum PF4 levels 
have been significantly associated with cognitive decline and core pathological 
biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease. Mechanistically, the chemokine receptor CXCR3 
partially mediates the cellular, molecular, and cognitive benefits of systemic 
PF4 administration in the aged brain. However, several critical questions 
remain, including the potential role of PF4 in blood-brain communication, its 
interaction with neurotransmitters and neuropharmacological processes, and how 
these findings might be translated into clinical practice. Further detailed 
studies are needed to validate and expand upon these insights for therapeutic 
application.

INTRODUCTION: At the present time, clinical detection of individuals who have 
amyloid in their brain is not possible without expensive biomarkers. The 
objective of the study was to test whether Cognivue Clarity® can differentiate 
True Controls, preclinical Alzheimer's disease (pAD), mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease (MCI-AD), AD, and MCI and dementia due to 
non-AD etiologies enrolled in the Bio-Hermes Study.
METHODS: A total of 887 individuals completed Cognivue Clarity, amyloid PET 
scan, and blood-based AD biomarkers. Three Cognivue Clarity subtests 
differentiated between True Controls and pAD, and between cognitive impairment 
due to AD versus non-AD processes. This finding was leveraged to develop an 
amyloid-specific marker, combining the three subtests with age using machine 
learning to create the 4-point Cognivue Amyloid Risk Measure (CARM).
RESULTS: Cognivue Clarity discriminated cognitively normal from cognitively 
impaired individuals (p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 0.732). The CARM differentiated 
between individuals with amyloid and without amyloid by PET (p < 0.001, Cohen's 
d = 0.618) and blood-based biomarkers (p's < 0.001). Amyloid positivity and 
cognitive impairment increased across four CARM thresholds (p < 0.001). 
Dichotomizing CARM thresholds into low (CARM1/CARM2) and high (CARM3/CARM4) 
likelihood provided excellent discrimination for amyloid PET positivity (OR: 
3.67; 95% CI 2.76-4.89). CARM categories differentiated between True Controls, 
pAD, MCI-AD, AD, and cognitive impairment due to non-AD etiologies (χ2 = 137.6, 
p < 0.001) with the majority of True Controls and non-AD etiologies being in 
CARM1/CARM2, and the majority of pAD, MCI-AD, and AD being in CARM3/CARM4.
CONCLUSIONS: Cognivue Clarity detects individuals with cognitive impairment, and 
a derivation benchmarked against amyloid PET was used to develop the CARM to 
predict the presence of amyloid. Combining the CARM and the Cognivue Clarity 
overall score could help identify individuals with and without cognitive 
impairment due to AD or non-AD etiologies, help screen for treatment protocols 
with anti-amyloid therapies, enrich clinical trial recruitment, and help to 
identify pAD for prevention studies.

Neurodegeneration is the progressive loss of neurons that results in 
neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). Currently, there are few effective treatments 
for NDs, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Multiple sclerosis, 
and Huntington's disease, which involve gradual neuronal death and cognitive 
deterioration. Alkaloids are naturally occurring molecules with a variety of 
biological properties. Recent studies have shown that these compounds may be 
able to modulate signaling pathways linked to many diseases. Alkaloids, with 
their antioxidant and neuroprotective properties, have the potential to treat 
neurodegeneration by simultaneously affecting multiple disease parts and 
modifying neuroinflammatory responses. These interact with various molecular 
targets, such as transcription factors, receptors, and enzymes involved in 
neuronal survival and homeostasis. The development of complete therapeutic 
techniques can be facilitated by alkaloid-based multi-target approaches, which 
challenge the intricate nature of neurodegenerative pathways. The review 
highlights the potential of alkaloid-based multi-target strategies in treating 
NDs and calls for further research to understand their clinical applications 
fully. Future studies should focus on finding neuroprotective alkaloids, 
investigating their mechanisms, and evaluating their therapeutic potential. 
Understanding how alkaloids interact with key pathways in NDs is essential for 
developing effective therapies.
