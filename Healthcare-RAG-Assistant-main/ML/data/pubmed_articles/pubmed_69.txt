Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) plays a pivotal role in regulating acetylcholine 
(ACh) levels during the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), so emerged as 
an attractive target in AD treatment. Vasicine, a naturally occurring 
pyrroloquinazoline alkaloid, was identified as a natural BChE inhibitor 
(IC50 = 1.47 ± 0.37 μM) from Traditional Chinese Medicine database. No any 
detailed research concerning the binding behavior of BChE with small molecule. 
As the first case, the inhibitory mechanism of vasicine on BChE was investigated 
using multi-spectroscopic methods (including fluorescence quenching, ANS 
fluorescence probe, three-dimensional fluorescence, time-resolved fluorescence, 
circular dichroism), isothermal titration calorimetry, surface plasmon 
resonance, and computational approaches. As a reversible and mixed inhibitor, 
vasicine displayed moderate affinity for BChE with an affinity constant KD of 
2.111 μM, its binding process was characterized as a spontaneous exothermic 
reaction with reduced entropy, primarily driven by hydrogen bonding 
interactions. Vasicine quenched the fluorescence of BChE through both static and 
dynamic quenching mechanisms, leading to an increase in the α-helix content and 
surface hydrophobicity of BChE. Furthermore, the fluctuation of the skeleton 
atoms in the vasicine-BChE complex system remained stable, indicating good 
stability within the simulated physiological environment. In addition, vasicine 
exerted good safety for PC12 cells. Above findings provide molecular insights 
into the inhibitory mechanism of vasicine against BChE for the first time, and 
offer valuable information for future structure modification and therapeutic 
applications of vasicine as a BChE inhibitor.

Alzheimer's disease, the leading cause of dementia globally, represents an 
unresolved clinical challenge due to its complex pathogenesis and the absence of 
effective treatments. Considering the multifactorial etiology of the disease, 
mainly characterized by the accumulation of amyloid β plaques and 
neurofibrillary tangles of tau protein, we discuss the A673V mutation in the 
gene coding for the amyloid precursor protein, which is associated with the 
familial form of Alzheimer's disease in a homozygous state. The mutation offers 
new insights into the molecular mechanisms of the disease, particularly 
regarding the contrasting roles of the A2V and A2T mutations in amyloid β 
peptide aggregation and toxicity. This review aims to describe relevant studies 
on A2V-mutated variants of the amyloid β peptide, revealing a protective effect 
against amyloid-β and tau pathology. Notably, special attention is given to the 
development of the peptide Aβ1-6A2V(D), which shows significant neuroprotective 
activity through inhibition of the assembly of amyloid β into amyloid fibrils. 
The therapeutic potential of this peptide emerges from its ability to reduce 
amyloid β-induced toxicity, with promising results from studies in human 
neuroblastoma cells and transgenic animal models.

OBJECTIVES: Given that most informal caregivers providing help for patients with 
Alzheimer's disease are retired spouses or unemployed people, there is no market 
value for their time. Most articles that tried to estimate the cost of informal 
care for Alzheimer's disease rely on the so-called "replacement" methodology, 
which assumes that 1 hour of informal care has the same value as 1 hour of 
professional care. Little attention has been dedicated to exploring the validity 
of this assumption. In this article, we determine the relationship between the 
price of informal caregiving and professional care from the first-order 
condition of a theoretical model that maximizes informal caregivers' 
satisfaction with providing care.
METHODS: This article formalizes the marginal substitution rate between informal 
and formal care. We assume that the caregiver's utility depends on the 
caregiver's burden and the patient's quality of life (QoL). After explaining the 
parameters of the marginal utility of caregivers, we estimate each of these 
parameters using PLASA data.
RESULTS: Our results show how the value of informal care increases as the care 
contributes to improving patients' QoL but decreases as the burden on the 
caregiver increases and professionals contribute to patients' QoL.
CONCLUSIONS: The central assumption of the replacement cost method of perfect 
substitution between informal and formal care leads to a misestimation of the 
value of informal care. The effects of informal care must be considered (direct 
effect on the burden and indirect effects on the patient's QoL).

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent 
form of dementia, characterized by a complex pathogenesis that includes Aβ 
deposition, abnormal phosphorylation of tau protein, chronic neuroinflammation, 
and mitochondrial dysfunction. In traditional medicine, ginseng is revered as 
the 'king of herbs'. Ginseng has the effects of greatly tonifying vital energy, 
strengthening the spleen and benefiting the lungs, generating fluids and 
nourishing the blood, and calming the mind while enhancing intelligence. 
Ginsenoside Rg1 (Rg1) is a well-defined major active component found in ginseng, 
known for its relatively high content. It has been demonstrated to exhibit 
neuroprotective effects in both in vivo and in vitro models, capable of 
ameliorating Aβ and tau pathology, regulating synaptic function, and reducing 
inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. However, the potential of Rg1 to 
improve AD pathology through the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics is still 
uncertain.
AIM OF THE STUDY: Despite the active research efforts on drugs for AD, the 
currently available anti-AD medications can only slow disease progression and 
manage symptoms, yet unable to provide a cure for AD. Furthermore, some anti-AD 
drugs failed phase III and IV clinical trials due to significant side effects. 
Therefore, there is an urgent need to further investigate the pathogenesis of 
AD, to identify new therapeutic targets, and to explore more effective 
therapies. The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential therapeutic 
effects of Rg1 on APP/PS1 double transgenic mice and Aβ42-induced HT22 cell 
models, and to investigate the potential mechanisms through which it provides 
neuroprotective effects.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study investigates the effects of Rg1 in treating AD 
on APP/PS1 double transgenic mice and Aβ42-induced HT22 cells. In the in vivo 
experiments, APP/PS1 mice were divided into a model group, Rg1-L group, Rg1-H 
group, and donepezil group, with C57BL/6 mice serving as the control group 
(n = 12 per group). The Rg1-L and Rg1-H groups were administered Rg1 at doses of 
5 mg/kg/d and 10 mg/kg/d, respectively, while the donepezil group received 
donepezil at a dose of 1.3 mg/kg/d. Both the control and model groups received 
an equal volume of physiological saline daily for 28 days. Learning and spatial 
memory were assessed by the Morris water maze (MWM) and novel object recognition 
(NOR) tests, and neuronal damage by Nissl staining. Aβ deposition was analyzed 
through immunohistochemistry and Western blot, while the expression levels of 
synaptic proteins PSD95 and SYN were evaluated via immunofluorescence staining 
and Western blot. The dendritic spines of neurons was observed by Golgi 
staining.The ultrastructure of neuronal mitochondria and synapses was examined 
by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Mitochondrial function was assessed 
through measurements of Reactive oxygen species (ROS), Superoxide Dismutase 
(SOD), and Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), and Western blot analysis was performed 
to detect the expression levels of AMPK, p-AMPK, Drp1, p-Drp1, OPA1, Mfn1, and 
Mfn2, thereby investigating the protective effects of Rg1 on mitochondrial 
dysfunction and cognitive impairment in APP/PS1 double transgenic mice. In vitro 
experiments, HT22 cells were treated with Aβ42 of 10 μM for 24 h to verify the 
therapeutic effects of Rg1. Flow cytometry was used to detect ROS and JC-1, 
biochemical methods were employed to measure SOD and ATP, immunofluorescence 
staining was used to detect the expression levels of PSD95 and SYN, and Western 
blot analysis was conducted to elucidate its potential mechanisms of action.
RESULTS: The findings suggest that after 28 days of Rg1 treatment, cognitive 
dysfunction in APP/PS1 mice was improved. Pathological and immunohistochemical 
analyses demonstrated that Rg1 treatment significantly reduced Aβ deposition and 
neuronal loss. Rg1 can improve synaptic dysfunction and mitochondrial function 
in APP/PS1 mice. Rg1 activated AMPK, enhanced p-AMPK expression, inhibited Drp1, 
and reduced p-Drp1 levels, which led to increased expression of OPA1, Mfn1, and 
Mfn2, thereby inhibiting mitochondrial fission and facilitating mitochondrial 
fusion. Additionally, Rg1 effectively reversed the decrease in mitochondrial 
membrane potential (MMP) and the increase in ROS production induced by Aβ42 in 
HT22 cells, restoring SOD and ATP levels. Furthermore, Rg1 regulated 
mitochondrial fission mediated by the AMPK/Drp1 signaling pathway, promoting 
mitochondrial fusion and improving synaptic dysfunction.
CONCLUSION: Our research provides evidence for the neuroprotective mechanisms of 
Rg1 in AD models. Rg1 modulates mitochondrial dynamics through the AMPK/Drp1 
signaling pathway, thereby reducing synaptic and mitochondrial dysfunction in 
APP/PS1 mice and AD cell models.

Curcumin has been proposed as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
due to its ability to inhibit amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide aggregates and to 
destabilise pre-formed ones. Derivative 27 was synthesized to improve low-dose 
efficacy in the context of AD. Its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and 
anti-amyloidogenic activities were evaluated in chemico, in vitro using AD and 
neuroinflammation cell models, and in vivo using the double-transgenic APP/PS1 
mice. In vitro, this curcumin derivative significantly reduced nitric oxide (NO) 
production and levels of pro-inflammatory proteins, inducible NO synthase, 
pro-interleukin-1β (Pro-IL-1β) and cyclooxygenase-2. Furthermore, Derivative 27 
activated nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 transcription factor 
(Nrf2) and significantly increased Nrf2 and heme-oxygenase-1 protein levels in 
the nucleus and in the cytoplasm, respectively. In one-year-old APP/PS1 mice, 
orally administered-Derivative 27 (50 mg/Kg/day) for 28 days improved spatial 
short-term memory and significantly decreased hippocampal Pro-IL-1β and amyloid 
precursor protein levels, as well as Aβ levels in the hippocampus and plasma. 
This study supports developing new chemical approaches to alter curcumin 
molecule, enabling lower doses, while increasing the effectiveness in AD 
treatment.

BACKGROUND: Evidence on antidementia drugs (ADD) use in developing countries, 
where accessibility to ADD is challenging, is limited. Our aim was to examine 
prescribing patterns, factors, and outcomes associated with the early-ADD use 
(within 3 months from diagnosis) in people with dementia.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study included individuals aged ≥ 60 years with 
dementia from three hospitals in Thailand between 2015 and 2020. Participants 
were categorized as non-ADD users, early-ADD users, and delayed users. ADD 
switching and one-year persistence were analyzed. Multivariable logistic 
regression was used to identify factors associated with early-ADD prescribing 
and its impact on clinical outcomes, including in-hospital death and 
hospitalization.
RESULTS: 3,116 patients were included. The ADD prescription rate was 14.31 %, 
with 79.82 % of those being early-ADD users. Donepezil was the most prescribed 
(70.18 %). The one-year persistence rate of any ADD was 24.89 %. Factors 
associated with early-ADD use included the Civil Servant Medical Benefit Scheme, 
dyslipidemia, and dementia type. Early-ADD use was associated with reduced 
in-hospital death (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]=0.46, 95 % CI: 0.22-0.96, p = 
0.038) and hospitalization (adjusted OR = 0.70 95 % CI: 0.51-0.97, p = 0.034) 
after controlling for age, sex, and Charlson Comorbidity Index.
CONCLUSION: ADD prescription rates were relatively low, with a one-year 
persistence rate of 25 %. Early-ADD use may improve clinical outcomes by 
reducing hospitalization and in-hospital mortality. These findings provide 
clinical features of ADD used in real-world settings and highlight the need for 
adherence to practice standards and strategies to promote ADD persistence among 
individuals with dementia.

Galantamine plays a crucial role in the management of brain disorders. In this 
study, a series of galantamine analogues were designed, synthesized and 
evaluated as potential therapeutic agents for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Compound 
C2, a dual inhibitor of cholinesterase, was obtained by introducing a 
benzylpyridine ring to the hydroxyl group of galantamine. Compared to 
galantamine (hAChE, IC50 = 1529 ± 6 nM), C2 exhibited excellent inhibitory 
activities against hAChE (IC50 = 513.90 ± 9.60 nM) and hBuChE 
(IC50 = 357.77 ± 10.24 nM). Further studies revealed that C2 possessed 
significant abilities to protect PC12 cells from H2O2-induced apoptosis and 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The acute toxicity test in vivo 
indicated that C2 exhibited a remarkable safety profile. Whether in the acute 
memory impairment induced by the Aβ1-42 model or in the amnesia induced by the 
scopolamine model, oral administration of C2 demonstrated superior improvement 
on cognition and spatial memory. In summary, both in vitro and in vivo results 
suggest that C2 deserves to be further explored as an anti-AD agent.

Many lipid biomarkers of stroke have been identified, but the lipid metabolism 
in elderly patients with leukoaraiosis remains poorly understood. This study 
aims to explore lipid metabolic processes in stroke among leukoaraiosis 
patients, which could provide valuable insights for guiding future 
antithrombotic therapy. In a cohort of 215 individuals undergoing MRI, 13 stroke 
patients were matched with controls, and 48 stroke patients with leukoaraiosis 
were matched with 40 leukoaraiosis patients. Serum lipidomics was profiled using 
UPLC-TOF, and OPLS-DA was applied for metabolite identification. Partial Least 
Squares Path Model (PLS-PM) assessed pathway weights of novel metabolites in 
stroke risk, while linear regression explored correlations with clinical 
outcomes. Lipid profiling identified 168 distinct compounds. From these, 25 
lipid molecules were associated with glycerolipid, glycerophospholipid, and 
sphingolipid metabolism. PLS-PM identified 12 key metabolites, including DG 36:4 
(OR = 6.40) as a significant risk factor. Metabolites such as PE 38:5 and FA 
16:1;O showed significant correlations with stroke in leukoaraiosis, 
particularly when the Fazekas score was ≥ 4. Twelve metabolites were identified 
as key factors in stroke incidence among leukoaraiosis patients. Lipid 
disturbances in glycerolipids and glycerophospholipids provide valuable insights 
for further studies on the progression from leukoaraiosis to stroke.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe neurodegenerative disease, and the most 
common type of dementia, with symptoms of progressive cognitive dysfunction and 
behavioral impairment. Studying the pathogenesis of AD and exploring new targets 
for the prevention and treatment of AD is a very worthwhile challenge. 
Accumulating evidence has highlighted the effects of fatty acid metabolism on 
AD. In this study, fatty acid metabolism was used as an entry point to 
understand the pathogenesis of AD and identify new targets. After identifying 
differentially expressed genes, multiple machine learning algorithms, carnitine 
palmitoyltransferase 1 A (CPT1A) was identified as the key gene for fatty acid 
metabolism in AD. Further single nucleus RNA sequencing analysis were performed, 
and the GSEA results showed that the fatty acid β-oxidation pathway was enriched 
only in astrocytes, and the fatty acid β-oxidation pathway was down-regulated in 
the AD astrocytes compared to the CN astrocytes, while CPT1A was specifically 
downregulated in astrocytes of AD, which was confirmed in vitro experiment 
subsequently, and decreased expression level of CPT1A would lead to abnormal 
lipid metabolism, which shapes astrocyte reactivity and injury, 
neuroinflammatory, and thus affects AD pathogenesis. Our findings report the 
involvement of CPT1A in AD. We confirm that the primary role of astrocytes for 
fatty acid β-oxidation, and CPT1A is localized in astrocytes. Downregulated 
CPT1A could be a novel potential target for the prevention and treatment of AD. 
Our study provides strong evidence for the involvement of fatty acid metabolism 
in the pathogenesis of AD.

Biomarkers that aid in early detection of neurodegeneration are needed to enable 
early symptomatic treatment and enable identification of people who may benefit 
from neuroprotective interventions. Increasing evidence suggests that sleep 
biomarkers may be useful, given the bi-directional relationship between sleep 
and neurodegeneration and the prominence of sleep disturbances and altered sleep 
architectural characteristics in several neurodegenerative disorders. This study 
aimed to demonstrate that sleep can accurately characterize specific 
neurodegenerative disorders (NDD). A four-class machine-learning algorithm was 
trained using age and nine sleep biomarkers from patients with 
clinically-diagnosed manifest and prodromal NDDs, including Alzheimer's disease 
dementia (AD = 27), Lewy body dementia (LBD = 18), and isolated REM sleep 
behavior disorder (iRBD = 15), as well as a control group (CG = 58). The 
algorithm was validated in a total of 381 recordings, which included the 
training data set plus an additional AD = 10, iRBD = 18, Parkinson disease 
without dementia (PD = 29), mild cognitive impairment (MCI = 78) and CG = 128. 
Test-retest consistency was then assessed in LBD = 10, AD = 9, and CG = 46. The 
agreement between the NDD profiles and their respective clinical diagnoses 
exceeded 75% for the AD, LBD, and CG, and improved when NDD participants 
classified Likely Normal with NDD indications consistent with their clinical 
diagnosis were considered. Profiles for iRBD, PD and MCI participants were 
consistent with the heterogeneity of disease severities, with the majority of 
overt disagreements explained by normal sleep characterization in 27% of iRBD, 
21% of PD, and 26% of MCI participants. For test-retest assignments, the same or 
similar NDD profiles were obtained for 88% of LBD, 86% in AD, and 98% of CG 
participants. The potential utility for NDD subtyping based on sleep biomarkers 
demonstrates promise and requires further prospective development and validation 
in larger NDD cohorts.

INTRODUCTION: Type 2 diabetes increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
dementia. Insulin signaling dysfunction exacerbates tau protein phosphorylation, 
a hallmark of AD pathology. However, the comprehensive impact of diabetes on 
patterns of AD-related phosphoprotein in the human brain remains underexplored.
METHODS: We performed tandem mass tag-based phosphoproteome profiling in post 
mortem human brain prefrontal cortex samples from 191 deceased older adults with 
and without diabetes and pathologic AD.
RESULTS: Among 7874 quantified phosphosites, microtubule-associated protein tau 
(MAPT) phosphorylated at T529 and T534 (isoform 8 T212 and T217) were more 
abundant in AD and showed differential associations with diabetes. Network 
analysis of co-abundance patterns uncovered synergistic interactions between AD 
and diabetes, with one module exhibiting higher MAPT phosphorylation (15 MAPT 
phosphosites) and another displaying lower MAP1B phosphorylation (22 MAP1B 
phosphosites).
DISCUSSION: This study offers phosphoproteomics insights into AD in diabetes, 
shedding light on mechanisms that can inform the development of therapeutics for 
dementia.
HIGHLIGHTS: The risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia is increased among 
older adults living with diabetes. The patterns of AD-related phosphoprotein in 
the human brain in older adults are differential among older adults living with 
diabetes. Microtubule-associated protein tau phosphorylated at T529 and T534 
(isoform 8 T212 and T217) showed differential associations with diabetes. 
Phosphosite co-abundance networks of synergistic interactions between AD and 
diabetes were identified.

INTRODUCTION: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs) are common in dementia with Lewy 
bodies (DLB) but their neurobiological mechanisms are poorly understood.
METHODS: NPSs and cognition were assessed annually in participants (DLB n = 222; 
Alzheimer's disease [AD] n = 125) from the European DLB (E-DLB) Consortium, and 
plasma phosphorylated tau-181 (p-tau181) and p-tau231 concentrations were 
measured at baseline.
RESULTS: Hallucinations, delusions, and depression were more common in DLB than 
in AD and, in a subgroup with longitudinal follow-up, persistent hallucinations 
and NPSs were associated with lower p-tau181 and p-tau231 in DLB. In adjusted 
linear mixed-effects models, hallucinations at baseline were associated with 
greater longitudinal cognitive impairment in DLB, with a significant interaction 
with p-tau231.
DISCUSSION: Higher p-tau181 and p-tau231 levels were associated with a lower 
longitudinal risk of NPSs and hallucinations in early-stage DLB. However, the 
interaction between hallucinations and p-tau231 suggests that when AD 
co-pathology and hallucinations do co-exist in DLB that they may synergistically 
exacerbate cognitive decline.
HIGHLIGHTS: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs) were more common in dementia with 
Lewy bodies (DLB) than in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Lower plasma phosphorylated 
tau-231 (p-tau231) and p-tau181 levels were associated with persistent 
hallucinations in DLB. Lower plasma p-tau231 and p-tau181 levels were associated 
with an increased risk of persistent NPSs in early DLB. Hallucinations at 
baseline were associated with greater cognitive dysfunction in DLB, and there 
was an interaction with p-tau231.

INTRODUCTION: Women with early bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) have 
greater Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk than women with spontaneous menopause 
(SM), but the pathway toward this risk is understudied. Considering associative 
memory deficits may reflect early signs of AD, we studied how BSO affected brain 
activity underlying associative memory.
METHODS: Early midlife women with BSO (with and without 17β-estradiol therapy 
[ET]) and age-matched controls (AMCs) with intact ovaries completed a face-name 
associative memory task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. 
Hippocampal activity along the anteroposterior axis during associative encoding 
and retrieval was compared among three groups (BSO [n = 28], BSO+ET [n = 35], 
AMCs [n = 40]).
RESULTS: Both BSO groups (with and without ET) showed lower posterior 
hippocampal activation during encoding compared to the AMC group. However, this 
difference in activation was not significantly correlated with associative 
memory task performance.
DISCUSSION: Early 17β-estradiol loss may influence posterior hippocampal 
activity during associative encoding, possibly presaging late-life AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: After ovarian removal, changes in hippocampal function may affect 
dementia risk. Midlife ovarian removal is associated with less activation in the 
posterior hippocampus. Estradiol therapy may ameliorate alterations in brain 
function during learning.

This review highlights the crucial role of neuroelectrophysiology in 
illuminating the mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis and 
progression, emphasizing its potential to inform the development of effective 
treatments. Electrophysiological techniques provide unparalleled precision in 
exploring the intricate networks affected by AD, offering insights into the 
synaptic dysfunction, network alterations, and oscillatory abnormalities that 
characterize the disease. We discuss a range of electrophysiological methods, 
from non-invasive clinical techniques like electroencephalography and 
magnetoencephalography to invasive recordings in animal models. By drawing on 
findings from these studies, we demonstrate how electrophysiological research 
has deepened our understanding of AD-related network disruptions, paving the way 
for targeted therapeutic interventions. Moreover, we underscore the potential of 
electrophysiological modalities to play a pivotal role in evaluating treatment 
efficacy. Integrating electrophysiological data with clinical neuroimaging and 
longitudinal studies holds promise for a more comprehensive understanding of AD, 
enabling early detection and the development of personalized treatment 
strategies. This expanded research landscape offers new avenues for unraveling 
the complexities of AD and advancing therapeutic approaches.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that is significantly 
characterized by cognitive and memory impairments, which worsen significantly 
with age. In the late stages of AD, metal ion disorders and an imbalance of 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels occur in the brain microenvironment, which 
causes abnormal aggregation of β-amyloid (Aβ), leading to a significant 
worsening of the AD symptoms. Therefore, we designed a composite nanomaterial of 
macrophage membranes-encapsulated Prussian blue nanoparticles (PB NPs/MM). 
Prussian blue nanoparticles (PB NPs) are capable of chelating Cu2+ and reducing 
ROS. Macrophage membranes (MM) have advantages over liposomal and erythrocyte 
membrane carriers, including inflammatory targeting capabilities and more 
effective immune evasion. Concurrently, the excellent photothermal ability of PB 
NPs can briefly open the blood-brain barrier (BBB) under near-infrared laser 
irradiation, which improves the transport efficiency of PB NPs/MM across the BBB 
and ablates Aβ deposition, thus achieving optimal therapeutic efficacy. In vitro 
experiments demonstrated that PB NPs/MM is a multifunctional nanosystem, which 
can effectively inhibit Cu2+-induced Aβ monomers aggregation, photothermally 
depolymerize Aβ fibrils, and attenuate oxidative stress through the combined 
treatment of chelating metals, photothermal therapy and scavenging ROS. In 
behavioral experiments, it also significantly improved the cognitive and 
learning deficits in late-stage APP/PS1 mice, thereby providing new ideas for 
the treatment of late-stage AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.

Chronic sleep deprivation and lack of physical exercise may have detrimental 
effects on overall health, particularly in terms of brain health, with 
significant implications for cognitive function and well-being. This review 
explores the impact of chronic sleep deprivation and physical exercise on brain 
atrophy in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Drawing 
insights from 40 selected studies, the review synthesizes evidence on these 
lifestyle factors' correlations with neurodegenerative changes. Chronic sleep 
deprivation disrupts circadian rhythms and neurochemical pathways, potentially 
accelerating brain atrophy, while physical exercise preserves brain structure by 
enhancing vascular health, reducing inflammation, and supporting synaptic 
plasticity, particularly in regions like the hippocampus. Results highlight 
distinct patterns of brain atrophy in AD and MCI, underscoring the potential for 
targeted interventions to mitigate cognitive decline. Understanding the 
relationship between sleep disruption and brain health provides insights into 
strategies for possibly delaying neurodegenerative diseases like MCI, which 
represents a milder form of Alzheimer's, and AD. The findings underscore the 
potential utility of integrating sleep therapy and physical exercise 
interventions in clinical practice for early detection of mild cognitive 
impairment and potentially delaying disease progression. This integrated 
approach has been found to promote healthy aging, reduce atrophy rates, and 
enhance cognitive resilience across aging populations.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is primarily caused by oxidative stress, 
hyperphosphorylated τ-protein aggregation, and amyloid-β deposition. Changes in 
dopaminergic and serotoninergic neurotransmitter pathways are linked to certain 
symptoms of AD. Derivatives of bicyclic and tricyclic cyclohepta[b]thiophene 
were developed to identify new potential candidates as acetylcholinesterase 
(AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibitors for the treatment of AD. All 
synthesized compounds exhibited AChE inhibition with IC50 values below 15 μM, 
while all compounds exhibited BChE inhibition with IC50 values below 25 μM. 
Compounds 9 and 12 exhibited AChE inhibitory activities with IC50 values of 
0.51 μM and 0.55 μM, respectively. Compounds 5 and 9 demonstrated excellent 
inhibitory activity against BChE with IC50 values of 2.9 μM and 2.48 μM, 
respectively. Compounds 9, 13, and 14 were found to be the most active in terms 
of the decrease in the escape latency time, with values comparable to that of 
Donepezil. Compounds 10, 11, and 12 exhibited promising effects on learning and 
memory. Compounds 5, 10, 11, and 12 exhibited promising SAP values of 70.67 %, 
71.5 %, 74.33 % and 73.83 %, respectively. Other biomarkers were evaluated in 
rat brains including TAC, MDA, SOD, BDNF, IL-β and TNF-α. Fundamental features 
of ADMET have been computed in-silico for synthesized compounds. Molecular 
docking was performed to confirm the binding of the novel compounds to the 
targets.

Mental disorders are complex illnesses with multifactorial etiologies involving 
genetic and environmental components. This review focuses on cellular models 
derived from the olfactory epithelium as a promising tool to study the molecular 
mechanisms of some neuropsychiatric diseases. The authors consider cell lines 
allowing the identification of potential biomarkers and pathogenetic mechanisms 
of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and Alzheimer's disease. Advantages of these 
models include the preservation of epigenetic modifications, the possibility of 
studying intercellular interactions, and conducting personalized studies. 
Particular emphasis is placed on state-of-the-art analytical techniques, such as 
single-cell RNA sequencing and DNA methylation analysis, as well as non-invasive 
methods of obtaining cellular material. The use of these models opens up new 
perspectives for the development of personalized therapeutic approaches and 
optimizing existing treatment regimens for psychiatric disorders.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurological illness that affects over 
80% of aged adults globally in cases of dementia. Although the exact 
pathophysiological causes of AD remain unclear, its pathogenesis is primarily 
driven by several distinct biochemical alterations: (i) the accumulation of 
toxic Aβ plaques, (ii) the hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins, (iii) oxidative 
stress resulting in cell death, and (iv) an imbalance between the two main 
neurotransmitters, glutamate and acetylcholine (ACh). Currently, there are very 
few medications available and no treatment. Presently marketed medications 
include memantine, an N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDA) antagonist, and 
acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors: rivastigmine, donepezil, and 
galantamine. Unfortunately, these medications are only useful in the initial 
stages of AD. The mentioned medications only provide symptomatic relief and do 
not slow down the disease progression in the advanced stages. Therefore, there 
is an urgent need to develop potential candidates to treat AD, symptomatically 
and therapeutically. Many research groups focus on natural products due to their 
diverse therapeutic profiles and easy availability. One such natural product is 
deoxyvasicinone, isolated from Adhatoda vasica. Given its broad pharmacological 
profile, various researchers have developed semisynthetic hybrids of 
deoxyvasicinone to address multifaceted diseases like AD. In this review 
article, we tried to summarize the semisynthetic hybrids of deoxyvasicinone 
developed over the past decade (2014-2024) for managing AD. We focus on their 
design, pharmacological activity, and structure-activity relationship (SAR) 
analysis. We hope this review enhances the reader's understanding of future 
exploratory options for deoxyvasicinone hybrids in AD management.

INTRODUCTION: Down Syndrome Regression Disorder (DSRD) is a neuropsychiatric 
condition causing insomnia, catatonia, encephalopathy, and obsessive-compulsive 
behavior in otherwise healthy individuals with Down syndrome (DS). Smaller 
cohorts have identified heterogenous diagnostic abnormalities which have 
predicted immunotherapy responsiveness although pattern analysis in a large 
cohort has never been performed.
METHODS: A multi-center, retrospective study of individuals with DSRD was 
performed. Individuals met international consensus criteria for DRSD and were 
aged 10-30 years. Clinical, demographic, and diagnostic data was extracted for 
all individuals. Serum studies were compared to a group of individuals with DS 
only.
RESULTS: A total of 164 individuals with DSRD were identified. Individuals with 
DSRD were more likely to have a positive antinuclear antibody, low complement 3, 
abnormal cytokines, and elevated ferritin levels. In a minority of individuals, 
EEG (30%), MRI (33%) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (21%) were abnormal. 
Individuals with CSF abnormalities demonstrated greater disease severity at 
diagnosis on the BFCRS and NPI-Q (p = 0.02 and p < 0.001). Abnormalities in 
cytokines (p = 0.03), neuroimaging (p < 0.001), and CSF (p = 0.02) were 
predictive of immunotherapy responsiveness. When MRI and LP were both abnormal 
or when EEG, MRI and LP were all abnormal, the odds of immunotherapy 
responsiveness approached 100% (p = 0.01, 95%CI: 1.75-105.1, OR: 13.56 and 
p = 0.02, 95%CI: 1.37-86.87, OR: 10.91, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: In a population of individuals diagnosed with DSRD, abnormalities 
in serum cytokine levels, neuroimaging findings, and CSF analysis emerged as 
indicators of disease severity and responsiveness to immunotherapy.

Colony-stimulating factor-1-receptor (CSF1R) inhibitors have been widely used to 
rapidly deplete microglia from the brain, allowing the remaining microglia 
population to self-renew and repopulate. These new-born microglia are thought to 
be "rejuvenated" and have been shown to be beneficial in several disease 
contexts and in normal aging. Their role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is thus of 
great interest as they represent a potential disease-modifying therapy. Here, we 
explored the differential effects of microglial depletion and repopulation 
during amyloid pathology progression using 5xFAD mice. We utilized the CSF1R 
inhibitor PLX3397 to induce microglial self-renewal and tracked microglia-plaque 
dynamics with in vivo imaging. We observed transient improvement in plaque 
burden on different timescales depending on the animal's age. While the 
improvement in plaque burden did not persist in any age group, renewing 
microglia during mid- to late-pathology might still be beneficial as we observed 
a potential improvement in microglial sensitivity to noradrenergic signaling. 
Altogether, our findings provide further insights into the therapeutic potential 
of microglial renewal in AD.

Diabetes mellitus is one of the metabolic syndromes that is associated with 
cognitive deficit, dementia, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) like pathology due to 
impaired insulin-signalling in the brain, oxidative stress and mitochondrial 
dysfunction. Nanotechnology is one of the most promising techniques for 
targeting the brain. However, the toxicity of metal nanoparticles is one of the 
biggest challenges to be studied. In this study, cobalt oxide nanoparticles are 
conjugated to a bioflavonoid, hesperidin, a natural antioxidant. The study is 
designed to assess the efficacy and safety of the cobalt oxide conjugated 
hesperidin in the diabetes-induced cognitive deficit rat model. The 
neuropharmacological behaviour, in-vivo antioxidant status and level of 
acetylcholinesterase, nitrite, amyloid β, and pro-inflammatory cytokines were 
determined for cobalt oxide conjugated hesperidin and compared with bare cobalt 
oxide nanoparticles and hesperidin. The cobalt oxide conjugated hesperidin 
significantly improved learning and memory in the streptozotocin rat model. 
However, further studies are required to establish a cellular and molecular 
mechanism involved in the neuroprotective activity of cobalt oxide-conjugated 
hesperidin.

Drug addiction is a multifactorial syndrome in which genetic predispositions and 
exposure to environmental stressors constitute major risk factors for the early 
onset, escalation, and relapse of addictive behaviors. While it is well known 
that stress plays a key role in drug addiction, the genetic factors that make 
certain individuals particularly sensitive to stress and, thereby, more 
vulnerable to becoming addicted are unknown. In an effort to test a complex set 
of gene x environment interactions-specifically gene x chronic stress-here we 
leveraged a systems genetics resource: BXD recombinant inbred mice (BXD5, BXD8, 
BXD14, BXD22, BXD29, and BXD32) and their parental mouse lines, C57BL/6J and 
DBA/2J. Utilizing the chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) and chronic variable 
stress (CVS) paradigms, we first showed sexual dimorphism in social and 
exploratory behaviors between the mouse strains. Further, we observed an 
interaction between genetic background and vulnerability to prolonged exposure 
to non-social stressors. Finally, we found that DBA/2J and C57BL/6J mice 
pre-exposed to stress displayed differences in morphine sensitivity. Our results 
support the hypothesis that genetic variation influences chronic stress-induced 
behavioral outcomes such as social and approach-avoidance behaviors, reward 
responses, as well as morphine sensitivity, and is likely to modulate the 
development of drug addiction.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by 
limited effective treatments, underscoring the critical need for early detection 
and diagnosis to improve intervention outcomes. This study integrates various 
bioinformatics methodologies with interpretable machine learning to identify 
reliable biomarkers for AD diagnosis and treatment. By leveraging differentially 
expressed genes (DEGs) analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analysis 
(WGCNA), and construction of Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) Networks, we 
meticulously analyzed the AD dataset from the GEO database to pinpoint Hub 
genes. Subsequently, various machine learning algorithms were employed to 
construct diagnostic models, which were then elucidated using SHapley Additive 
exPlanations (SHAP). To visualize our findings, we generated an insightful 
bioinformatics map of 10 Hub genes. We then conducted experimental validation on 
less-studied Hub genes, revealing significant differential mRNA expression of 
MYH9 and RHOQ in an AD cell model. Finally, we explored the biological 
significance of these two genes at the single-cell transcriptome level. This 
study not only introduces interactive SHAP panels for precise decision-making in 
AD but also offers novel insights into the identification of AD biomarkers 
through interpretable machine learning diagnostic models. Particularly, MYH9 has 
emerged as a promising new potential biomarker, pointing the way towards 
enhanced diagnostic accuracy and personalized therapeutic strategies for AD. 
Although the mRNA expression patterns of RHOQ are opposite in AD cell models and 
human brain tissue samples, the role of RHOQ in AD remains worthy of further 
exploration due to the diversity and complexity of biological molecular 
regulation.

BACKGROUND: Understanding advocacy strategies is essential to improving dementia 
awareness, reducing stigma, supporting cognitive health promotion, and 
influencing policy to support people living with dementia. However, there is a 
dearth of evidence-based research on advocacy strategies used to support 
dementia awareness.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to use posts from X (formerly known as Twitter) to 
understand dementia advocacy strategies during World Alzheimer's Awareness Month 
in September 2022.
METHODS: Posts were scraped from X during World Alzheimer's Awareness Month from 
September 1, 2022, to September 30, 2022. After applying filters, 1981 relevant 
posts were analyzed using thematic analysis, and measures were taken to support 
trustworthiness and rigor.
RESULTS: Our study revealed a variety of advocacy strategies, including sharing 
the voices of lived experience, targeting ethnic and cultural groups, 
myth-busting strategies, and political lobbying. Although a range of strategies 
were identified, further research is needed to examine advocacy strategies 
within different countries and political contexts. Furthermore, the impact of 
specific strategies on stigma reduction, cognitive health promotion, and policy 
change needs to be scientifically evaluated.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study offers valuable insight into strategies to bolster 
dementia advocacy and awareness campaigns to support people living with 
dementia. Findings from our research may provide critical insight for 
policymakers, organizations, and health professionals working to reduce 
dementia-related stigma and increase the uptake of risk-reduction activities to 
support the promotion of cognitive health.

Modified citrus pectin (MCP) modulates galectin-3, a key player in 
neuroinflammation linked to Alzheimer's disease. By inhibiting galectin-3, MCP 
reduces the brain's inflammatory response and may alleviate cognitive decline. 
This study examines MCP's impact on neuroinflammation, cognitive function, and 
its role in galectin-3 inhibition in a dementia model. Male Wistar rats were 
assigned to four groups: control (n = 6), scopolamine (SCP) (n = 7), SCP + MCP 
(n = 7), and MCP only (n = 7). MCP was administered orally at 100 mg/kg/day via 
drinking water for six weeks. SCP was injected intraperitoneally at 1 mg/kg for 
seven days to induce an Alzheimer's-type dementia model. The researchers 
assessed cognitive performance through the Morris Water Maze (MWM) test. After 
behavioral tests, blood and brain tissues, including the hippocampus, were 
collected and stored at -80 °C for analysis. Immunohistochemistry was used to 
evaluate superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, 
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and inflammatory markers (IL-1β, IL-6, 
TNF-α, and galectin-3). The data were analyzed with SPSS 22. SCP treatment 
increased lipid peroxidation (MDA) and elevated inflammatory markers (TNF-α, 
IL-6, and galectin-3), while reducing BDNF and impairing spatial memory. 
Co-administering MCP with SCP significantly reduced TNF-α, IL-6, and galectin-3 
levels; increased BDNF; and improved memory performance. Although MCP did not 
lower MDA levels, it boosted SOD activity, suggesting antioxidant effects. 
Modified citrus pectin (MCP) alleviated cognitive impairments and reduced 
neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's-type dementia by inhibiting galectin-3. MCP 
also exhibited antioxidant potential, underscoring its therapeutic promise for 
neurodegenerative diseases.

Clinical Potential of Misshapen/NIKs-Related Kinase (MINK) 1-A Many-Sided 
Element of Cell Physiology and Pathology.

Misshapen/NIKs-related kinase (MINK) 1 belongs to the mammalian germinal center 
kinase (GCK) family. It contains the N-terminal, conserved kinase domain, a 
coiled-coil region, a proline-rich region, and a GCK, C-terminal domain with the 
Citron-NIK-Homology (CNH) domain. The kinase is an essential component of 
cellular signaling pathways, which include Wnt signaling, JNK signaling, 
pathways engaging Ras proteins, the Hippo pathway, and STRIPAK complexes. It 
thus contributes to regulating the cell cycle, apoptosis, cytoskeleton 
organization, cell migration, embryogenesis, or tissue homeostasis. MINK1 plays 
an important role in immunological responses, inhibiting Th17 and Th1 cell 
differentiation and regulating NLRP3 inflammasome function. It may be considered 
a link between ROS and the immunological system, and a potential antiviral 
target for human enteroviruses. The kinase has been implicated in the 
pathogenesis of sepsis, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, SLE, and more. It is also 
involved in tumorigenesis and drug resistance in cancer. Silencing MINK1 reduces 
cancer cell migration, suggesting potential for new therapeutic approaches. 
Targeting MINK1 could be a promising treatment strategy for patients insensitive 
to current chemotherapies, and could improve their prognosis. Moreover, MINK1 
plays an important role in the nervous system and the cardiovascular system 
development and function. The modulation of MINK1 activity could influence the 
course of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Further 
exploration of the activity of the kinase could also help in gaining more 
insight into factors involved in thrombosis or congenital heart disease. This 
review aims to summarize the current knowledge on MINK1, highlight its 
therapeutic and prognostic potential, and encourage more studies in this area.

P300 Latency with Memory Performance: A Promising Biomarker for Preclinical 
Stages of Alzheimer's Disease.

and Technology, Gwangju 61005, Republic of Korea.

Detecting and tracking the preclinical stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is now 
of particular interest due to the aging of the world's population. AD is the 
most common cause of dementia, affecting the daily lives of those afflicted. 
Approaches in development can accelerate the evaluation of the preclinical 
stages of AD and facilitate early treatment and the prevention of symptom 
progression. Shifts in P300 amplitude and latency, together with 
neuropsychological assessments, could serve as biomarkers in the early screening 
of declines in cognitive abilities. In this study, we investigated the ability 
of the P300 indices evoked during a visual oddball task to differentiate 
pre-clinically diagnosed participants from normal healthy adults (HCs). Two 
preclinical stages, named asymptomatic AD (AAD) and prodromal AD (PAD), were 
included in this study, and a total of 79 subjects participated, including 35 
HCs, 22 AAD patients, and 22 PAD patients. A mixed-design ANOVA test was 
performed to compare the P300 indices among groups during the processing of the 
target and non-target stimuli. Additionally, the correlation between these 
neurophysiological variables and the neuropsychological tests was evaluated. Our 
results revealed that neither the peak amplitude nor latency of P300 can 
distinguish AAD from HCs. Conversely, the peak latency of P300 can be used as a 
biomarker to differentiate PAD from AAD and HCs. The correlation results 
revealed a significant relationship between the peak latency of P300 and memory 
domain tasks, showing that less time-demanding neuropsychological assessments 
can be used. In summary, our findings showed that a combination of P300 latency 
and memory-requiring tasks can be used as an efficient biomarker to 
differentiate individuals with AAD from HCs.

BACKGROUND: There are numerous communication barriers between family caregivers 
and providers of people living with dementia, which can pose challenges to 
caregiving and clinical decision-making. To address these barriers, a new web 
and mobile-enabled app, called CareHeroes, was developed, which promotes the 
collection and secured sharing of clinical information between caregivers and 
providers. It also provides caregiver support and education.
OBJECTIVE: The primary study objective was to examine whether dementia 
caregivers would use CareHeroes as an adjunct to care and gather psychosocial 
data from those who used the app.
METHODS: This paper presents the implementation process used to integrate 
CareHeroes into clinical care at 2 memory clinics and preliminary outcome 
evaluation. Family caregivers receiving services at clinics were asked to use 
the app for a 12-month period to collect, track, and share clinical information 
with the care recipient's provider. They also used it to assess their own mental 
health symptoms. Psychosocial outcomes were assessed through telephone 
interviews and user data were collected by the app.
RESULTS: A total of 21 caregivers enrolled in the pilot study across the 2 
memory clinics. Usage data indicated that caregivers used many of the features 
in the CareHeroes app, though the chatbot was the most frequently used feature. 
Outcome data indicated that caregivers' depression was lower at 3-month 
follow-up (t11=2.03, P=.03).
CONCLUSIONS: Recruitment and retention of the pilot study were impacted by 
COVID-19 restrictions, and therefore more testing is needed with a larger sample 
to determine the potential impact of CareHeroes on caregivers' mental health. 
Despite this limitation, the pilot study demonstrated that integrating a new 
supportive app for caregivers as an adjunct to clinical dementia care is 
feasible. Implications for future technology intervention development, 
implementation planning, and testing for caregivers of people living with 
dementia are discussed.

BACKGROUND: Aducanumab, a monoclonal antibody, received approval for the 
treatment of Alzheimer's disease in 2021. However, it remains controversial over 
the security of this drug. In this study, aducanumab-related adverse events 
(AEs) were evaluated through data mining based on the FDA Adverse Event 
Reporting System (FAERS) database.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The AE reports induced by aducanumab as the primary 
suspected drug were extracted from the FAERS database. The clinical 
characteristics of aducanumab-associated reports were analyzed. The potential 
new AE signals of aducanumab were explored using four disproportionality 
analysis methods. Furthermore, the difference in aducanumab-associated AE 
signals was investigated concerning sex, age, weight, dose, onset time, and 
continent.
RESULTS: In total, 328 reports and 793 AEs associated with aducanumab were 
identified. Six new AEs were identified. No significant sex and weight 
difference in aducanumab-related signals was found. Notably, nervous system 
disorders, especially 'amyloid related imaging abnormality-edema/effusion' and 
'amyloid related imaging abnormality-microhaemorrhages and haemosiderin 
deposits,' were more frequently to be reported within 121-240 days, particularly 
in Europe.
CONCLUSIONS: This study contributes real-world evidence regarding the safety of 
aducanumab.

Recombinant antibodies are a promising class of therapeutics to treat protein 
misfolding associated with neurodegenerative diseases, and several antibodies 
that inhibit aggregation are approved or in clinical trials to treat Alzheimer's 
disease. Here, we developed antibodies targeting the aggregation-prone 
β-propeller olfactomedin (OLF) domain of myocilin, variants of which comprise 
the strongest genetic link to glaucoma and cause early onset vision loss for 
several million individuals worldwide. Mutant myocilin aggregates 
intracellularly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Subsequent ER stress causes 
cytotoxicity that hastens dysregulation of intraocular pressure, the primary 
risk factor for most forms of glaucoma. Our antibody discovery campaign yielded 
two recombinant antibodies: anti-OLF1 recognizes a linear epitope, while 
anti-OLF2 is selective for natively folded OLF and inhibits aggregation in 
vitro. By binding OLF, these antibodies engage autophagy/lysosomal degradation 
to promote degradation of two pathogenic mutant myocilins. This work 
demonstrates the potential for therapeutic antibodies to disrupt ER-localized 
protein aggregates by altering the fate of folding intermediates. This approach 
could be translated as a precision medicine to treat myocilin-associated 
glaucoma with in situ antibody expression. More generally, the study supports 
the approach of enhancing lysosomal degradation to treat proteostasis decline in 
glaucoma and other diseases.

The microglial triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is 
required for diverse microglia responses in neurodegeneration, including 
immunometabolic plasticity, phagocytosis, and survival. We previously identified 
that patient iPSC-derived microglia (iPS-Mg) harboring the Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) TREM2R47H hypomorph display several functional deficits linked to 
metabolism. To investigate whether these deficits are associated with 
disruptions in metabolite signaling, we generated common variant, TREM2R47H and 
TREM2-/- variant human iPS-Mg. We assessed the ability of supplementation with 
citrate or succinate, key metabolites and cell cycle breaking points upon 
microglia activation, to overcome these functional deficits with potential 
impact on neurons. Succinate supplementation was more effective than citrate at 
overcoming mitochondrial deficits in OXPHOS and did not promote a glycolytic 
switch. Citrate enhanced the lipid content of TREM2R47H iPS-Mg and was more 
effective at overcoming Αβ phagocytic deficits, whereas succinate increased 
lipid content and phagocytic capacity in TREM2-/- iPS-Mg. Microglia cytokine 
secretion upon pro-inflammatory activation was moderately affected by citrate or 
succinate showing a condition-dependent increasing trend. Neither metabolite 
altered basal levels of soluble TREM2 shedding. In addition, neither citrate nor 
succinate enhanced glycolysis; instead, drove their effects through oxidative 
phosphorylation. IPS-neurons exposed to conditioned medium from TREM2 variant 
iPS-Mg showed changes in oxidative phosphorylation, which could be ameliorated 
when iPS-Mg were first treated with citrate or succinate. Our data point to 
discrete pathway linkage between microglial metabolism and functional outcomes 
with implications for AD pathogenesis and treatments.

In recent years, a growing body of research has unveiled the involvement of the 
necroptosis pathway in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This 
evidence has shed light on the mechanisms underlying neuronal death in AD, 
positioning necroptosis at the forefront as a potential target for therapeutic 
intervention. This review provides an update on the current knowledge on this 
emerging, yet rapidly advancing topic, encompassing all published studies that 
present supporting proof of the role of the necroptosis pathway in the 
neurodegenerative processes of AD. The implication of misfolded tau and 
amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregates is highlighted, with evidence suggesting their direct 
or indirect involvement in necroptosis activation. In summary, the review 
underscores the significance of understanding the complex interplay between 
necroptosis, protein aggregates, and neurodegeneration in AD. The findings 
advocate for a comprehensive approach, combining therapeutic and early 
diagnostic strategies, to intervene in the disease process before irreversible 
damage occurs.

Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting memory, 
language, and thinking with no curative treatment. Symptoms appear gradually, 
and pathological brain changes may occur twenty years before the physical and 
psychological signs, pointing to the urgent development of preventive 
interventions. Physical activity has been investigated as a preventive tool to 
defeat the main biological features of AD: pathological amyloid protein plaques, 
tau tangles, myelin degeneration, and iron deposits in the brain. This work 
quantifies tau tangles, amyloid, iron, and ferroptosis in oligodendrocytes in 
the aged rat hippocampal formation and statistically correlates neuron-neuron, 
neuron-glia, and glia-glia crosstalk and the effect of physical exercise on it. 
Our results indicate that iron overload in the oligodendrocytes is an inducer of 
ferroptosis; physical exercise reduces inflammaging, and improves axon-myelin 
volume relations; tau, amyloid, iron, and hippocampal formation cells present 
statistical correlations. Our data suggest the beneficial effects of physical 
exercise in AD and a mathematical relationship between the hippocampal formation 
cells in sedentary and active individuals, which should be considered in human 
and animal studies as a guide to a better understanding of crosstalk physiology.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible and progressive neurodegenerative 
disorder. The vicious circle between amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) overgeneration and 
microglial dysfunction is an important pathological event that promotes AD 
progression. However, therapeutic strategies toward only Aβ or microglial 
modulation still have many problems. Herein, inspired by the Aβ transportation, 
an Aβ-derived peptide (CKLVFFAED) engineered biomimetic nanodelivery system 
(MK@PC-R NPs) is reported for realizing BBB penetration and reprogram neuron and 
microglia in AD lesion sites. This hollow mesoporous Prussian blue-based MK@PC-R 
NPs carrying curcumin and miRNA-124 can down-regulate β secretase expression, 
thereby inhibiting Aβ production and reducing Aβ-induced neurotoxicity. 
Meanwhile, MK@PC-R NPs with excellent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory 
properties could normalize the microglial phenotype and promote Aβ degradation, 
providing neuroprotection. As expected, after treatment with MK@PC-R NPs, the Aβ 
burdens, neuron damages, neuroinflammation, and memory deficits of transgenic AD 
mice (APP/PS1 mice) are significantly attenuated. Overall, this biomimetic 
nanodelivery system with anti-Aβ and anti-inflammatory properties provides a 
promising strategy for the multi-target therapy of early AD.

INTRODUCTION: The annual growth of psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases 
requires new therapeutic strategies for delivering active pharmaceutical 
molecules to the brain. Non-invasive intranasal drug delivery is a promising 
method that allows bypassing of the blood-brain barrier and the liver 
de-toxification system.
RESULTS: The review discusses the main results of experimental studies of the 
effect of intranasal substances of amino acid and peptide nature on the 
monoamine systems of the brain. The main attention is paid to understanding the 
transport mechanisms of potential amino acid and peptide drugs in the 
nose-to-brain projection and assessing their therapeutic efficacy.
CONCLUSION: The obtained results indicate the possibility of creating, along 
with buccal, in-halation, transdermal and ocular preparations, intranasal 
non-invasive drugs that provide more effective therapy for psychiatric and 
neurodegenerative diseases, such as schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, ADHD, 
Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease.

Cholesterol dysregulation, disorder of neuronal membrane lipid packing, and 
lipid rafts lead to the synthesis and accumulation of toxic amyloid-β (Aβ), 
contributing to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our study shows 
that near-infrared (NIR) transcranial photobiomodulation therapy (tPBMT) can 
reduce Aβ load and restore the properties of neuronal plasma membrane, including 
Aβ production, bilayer order, rafts, lipid content, and Ca2+ channels during AD. 
Mice in the experiments were exposed to 808-nm LED for 1 h daily over 3 months. 
In the APOE transgenic model with cholesterol dysregulation, the cholesterol 
levels increased by 22 times, causing healthy neurons to produce toxic Aβ three 
times faster, increasing its load by five times. Consequently, Aβ disrupts the 
membrane bilayer and prompts the formation of lipid rafts and pores. NIR-tPBMT 
can nearly half attenuate Aβ load, restore membrane lipid order and rigidity, 
reduce the number of lipid rafts, modulate cholesterol synthesis, normalize Ca2+ 
influx by activated endocytosis, and reduce neuronal death. The Ca2+ influx 
induced by light does not cause excitotoxicity but modulates Ca2+/calmodulin 
signaling involved in AD mechanisms and cell viability. The transcriptome 
analysis of the brain cortex and hippocampus shows that light can downregulate 
Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent AD-risk genes BACE, PSEN, and APP, and normalize 
cholesterol homeostasis via the HMGCR, DHCR7, and INSIG1 genes. Additionally, 
light enhances neuron resistance to the endoplasmic reticulum stress via 
activating transcription factors of the unfolded protein response. Thus, red/NIR 
light could be promising in combating AD, restoring synaptic plasticity in 
degenerating neurons and reducing Aβ load.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia worldwide. AD 
brains are characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-β peptides (Aβ) that 
bind Cu2+ and have been associated with several neurotoxic mechanisms. Although 
the use of copper chelators to prevent the formation of Cu2+-Aβ complexes has 
been proposed as a therapeutic strategy, recent studies show that copper is an 
important neuromodulator that is essential for a neuroprotective mechanism 
mediated by Cu2+ binding to the cellular prion protein (PrPC). Therefore, in 
addition to metal selectivity and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, an 
emerging challenge for copper chelators is to prevent the formation of 
neurotoxic Cu2+-Aβ species without perturbing the neuroprotective Cu2+-PrPC 
interaction. Previously, we reported the design of a tetrapeptide (TP) that 
withdraws Cu2+ from Aβ(1-16) and impacts the Cu2+-induced aggregation of 
Aβ(1-40). In this study, we improved the drug-like properties of TP in a BBB 
model, evaluated the metal selectivity of the optimized peptide (TP*), and 
tested its effect on Cu2+ coordination to PrPC and proteins involved in copper 
trafficking, such as copper transporter 1 and albumin. Our results show that 
changing the stereochemistry of the first residue prevents TP degradation in the 
BBB model and coadministration of TP with a peptide that increases BBB 
permeability allows its passage through the BBB model. TP* is highly selective 
toward Cu2+ in the presence of Zn2+ ions, transfers Cu2+ to copper-trafficking 
proteins, and forms a ternary TP*-Cu2+-PrP species that does not perturb the 
physiological conformation of PrP and displays only a minor impact in the 
neuroprotective Cu2+-dependent interaction of PrPC with the N-methyl-d-aspartate 
receptor. Overall, these results show that TP* displays desirable features for a 
copper chelator with therapeutic potential against AD. Moreover, this is the 
first study that explores the effect of a Cu2+ chelator with therapeutic 
potential for AD on Cu2+ coordination to PrPC (an emerging key player in AD 
pathology), integrating recent knowledge about metalloproteins involved in AD 
with the design of copper chelators against AD.

BACKGROUND: Inclusion body myositis (IBM) is the most prevalent muscle disease 
in adults for which no current treatment exists. The pathogenesis of IBM remains 
poorly defined. In this study, we aimed to explore the interplay between 
inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction in IBM.
METHODS: The study population consisted of 38 IBM patients and 22 age- and 
sex-matched controls without a myopathy. Mean age was 62.9 years (SD = 9) in IBM 
group and 59.7 (10) in controls. Bulk RNA sequencing, Meso Scale Discovery 
electrochemiluminescence (ECL), western blotting, histochemistry and 
immunohistochemistry were performed on frozen muscle samples from the study 
participants.
RESULTS: We demonstrated activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in IBM muscle 
samples, with the NLRP3 inflammasome being the most upregulated pathway on RNA 
sequencing, along with increased expression of NLRP3 and ASC proteins in IBM 
group. NLRP3 RNA levels most strongly correlated with TLR7 (correlation 
coefficient ρ = 0.91) and complement activation-related genes, and inversely 
correlated with several mitochondria-related genes among others. On muscle 
histopathology, there was increased NRLP3 immunoreactivity in both inflammatory 
cells and muscle fibres. Mitophagy is critical for removing damaged mitochondria 
and preventing the formation of a vicious cycle of mitochondrial 
dysfunction-NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Herein, we showed altered mitophagy, 
as witnessed by the elevated levels of p-S65-Ubiquitin, a mitophagy marker, in 
muscle lysates from IBM patients compared to controls (median of 114.3 vs. 81.25 
ECL units, p = 0.005). The p-S65-Ubiquitin levels were most significantly 
elevated in IBM males compared to male controls (136 vs. 83.5 ECL units; 
p = 0.013), whereas IBM females had milder nonsignificant elevation compared to 
female controls (97.25 vs. 69 ECL units, p = 0.31). On muscle histopathology, 
p-S65-Ubiquitin aggregates accumulated in muscle fibres that were mostly Type 2 
and devoid of cytochrome-c-oxidase reactivity. NLRP3 RNA levels correlated with 
p-S65-Ubiquitin levels in both sexes (males: ρ = 0.48, females: ρ = 0.54) but 
with loss of muscle strength, as reflected by the manual motor test score, only 
in males (males: ρ = 0.62, females: ρ = -0.14). Lastly, we identified 
sex-specific molecular pathways in IBM. Females had upregulation of pathways 
related to response to stress, which could conceivably offset some of the 
pathomechanisms of IBM, while males had upregulation of pathways related to cell 
adhesion and migration.
CONCLUSIONS: There is activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in IBM, along with 
altered mitophagy, particularly in males, which is of potential therapeutic 
significance. These findings suggest sex-specific mechanisms in IBM that warrant 
further investigation.

This is a case of a 67-year-old male diagnosed with posterior cortical atrophy. 
Posterior cortical atrophy is an underdiagnosed phenomenon seen in 
neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. When this condition 
manifests in patients with Alzheimer's disease, it is known as a visual variant 
of Alzheimer's disease. This condition leads to visual disturbances that are due 
to processing errors in the brain, leaving cognitive functioning unchanged. 
Patients tend to undergo years of unnecessary ophthalmologic workup leading to 
unnecessary cost and frustration to the patient. The presentation and diagnostic 
workup of this disease are discussed in this case report.

CSF concentrations of β-amyloid 42 (Aβ42) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) are 
well-established biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease and have been studied in 
relation to several neuropathological features both in patients and in 
cognitively unimpaired individuals. The CSF p-tau/Aβ42 ratio, a biomarker 
combining information from both pathophysiological processes, has emerged as a 
promising tool for monitoring disease progression, even at pre-clinical stages. 
Here, we studied the association between the CSF p-tau/Aβ42 ratio with 
downstream markers of pre-clinical Alzheimer's disease progression including 
brain structure, glucose metabolism, fibrillary Aβ deposition and cognitive 
performance in 234 cognitively unimpaired individuals, who underwent cognitive 
testing, a lumbar puncture, MRI, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose and 18F-flutemetamol PET 
scanning. We evaluated both main effects and interactions with Alzheimer's 
disease risk factors, such as older age, female sex and the apoliporoptein E 
(APOE)-ɛ4 allele, in a priori defined regions of interest and further examined 
the associations on the whole-brain using voxel-wise regressions. In addition, 
as the association between CSF Alzheimer's disease biomarkers and brain 
structure and function may be non-linear, we tested the interaction between the 
CSF p-tau/Aβ42 ratio and stages of pre-clinical Alzheimer's disease defined 
using the amyloid (A) and tau (T) classification. We found significantly 
positive associations between CSF p-tau/Aβ42 and both cortical Aβ deposition and 
regional grey matter volume while no effect was observed for brain metabolism. A 
significant interaction with age indicated that, for the same level of CSF 
p-tau/Aβ42, older individuals displayed both increased Aβ deposition and lower 
grey matter volume, in widespread cortical areas. In addition, we found that 
women compared with men had a greater Aβ fibrillary accumulation in midline 
cortical areas and inferior temporal regions, for the same level of the CSF 
biomarker. The impact of CSF p-tau/Aβ42 on grey matter volume was modulated by 
AT stages, with A+T+ individuals displaying significantly less positive 
associations in areas of early atrophy in the Alzheimer's continuum. Finally, we 
found that sex and APOE-ɛ4 modulated the association between the CSF biomarker 
and episodic memory as well as abstract reasoning, respectively. Our data 
indicate that the CSF p-tau/Aβ42 ratio is strongly associated with multiple 
downstream neuropathological events in cognitively unimpaired individuals and 
may thus serve as a potent biomarker to investigate the earliest changes in 
pre-clinical Alzheimer's disease. Given that its impact on both Aβ deposition 
and grey matter volume is modulated by specific risk factors, our results 
highlight the need to take into account such predisposing variables in both 
clinical practice and prevention trials.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common kind of dementia worldwide, is 
characterized by elevated levels of the amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide and 
hyperphosphorylated tau protein in the neurons. The complexity of AD makes the 
development of treatments infamously challenging. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) 
genes's ε4 allele is one of the main genetic risk factors for AD. While the APOE 
gene's ε4 allele considerably increases the chance of developing AD, the ε2 
allele is protective compared to the prevalent ε3 variant. It is fiercely 
discussed how APOE affects the development and course of disease since it has a 
variety of activities that influence both neuronal and non-neuronal cells. ApoE4 
contributes to the formation of tau tangles, deposition of Aβ, 
neuroinflammation, and other processes. Four decades of research have provided a 
significant understanding of the structure of APOE and how this may affect the 
neuropathology and pathogenesis of AD. APOE is a crucial lipid transporter 
essential for the growth of the central nervous system (CNS), upkeep, and 
repair. The mechanisms by which APOE contributes to the pathophysiology of AD 
are still up for discussion, though. Evidence suggests that APOE affects the 
brain's clearance and deposition of Aβ. Additionally, APOE has Aβ-independent 
pathways in AD, which has led to the identification of new functions for APOE, 
including mitochondrial dysfunction. This study summarizes important studies 
that describe how APOE4 affects well-known AD pathologies, including tau 
pathology, Aβ, neuroinflammation, and dysfunction of neural networks. This study 
also envisions some of the therapeutic approaches being used to target APOE4 in

TLR4 stands at the forefront of innate immune responses, recognizing various 
pathogen- associated molecular patterns and endogenous ligands, thus serving as 
a pivotal mediator in the immune system's defense against infections and tissue 
damage. Beyond its canonical role in infection, emerging evidence highlights 
TLR4's involvement in numerous non-infectious human diseases, ranging from 
metabolic disorders to neurodegenerative conditions and cancer. Targeting TLR4 
signaling pathways presents a promising therapeutic approach with broad 
applicability across these diverse pathological states. In metabolic disorders 
such as obesity and diabetes, dysregulated TLR4 activation contributes to 
chronic low-grade inflammation and insulin resistance, driving disease 
progression. In cardiovascular diseases, TLR4 signaling promotes vascular 
inflammation and atherogenesis, implicating its potential as a therapeutic 
target to mitigate cardiovascular risk. Neurodegenerative disorders, including 
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, exhibit aberrant TLR4 activation linked to 
neuroinflammation and neuronal damage, suggesting TLR4 modulation as a strategy 
to attenuate neurodegeneration. Additionally, in cancer, TLR4 signaling within 
the tumor microenvironment promotes tumor progression, metastasis, and immune 
evasion, underscoring its relevance as a target for anticancer therapy. Advances 
in understanding TLR4 signaling cascades and their contributions to disease 
pathogenesis have spurred the development of various pharmacological agents 
targeting TLR4. These agents range from small molecule inhibitors to monoclonal 
antibodies, with some undergoing preclinical and clinical evaluations. 
Furthermore, strategies involving TLR4 modulation through dietary interventions 
and microbiota manipulation offer additional avenues for therapeutic 
exploration. Hence, targeting TLR4 holds significant promise as a therapeutic 
strategy across a spectrum of human diseases, offering the potential to modulate 
inflammation, restore immune homeostasis, and impede disease progression.

The effect of digestion on nanocarriers will affect the release and 
pharmacological effects of bioactive compounds in delivery systems. The 
digestion of cellulose is limited to gut microbiota, which offers a new research 
strategy for targeted delivery of bioactive compounds. Herein, positively 
charged cellulose-like chitosan/polyvinylpyrrolidone nanofiber was prepared to 
improve the residence time, colon target and gut microbiota regulation activity 
of quercetin decorated selenium nanoparticles (QUE@SeNPs/CS/PVPNFs). Selenium 
nanoparticles block the degradation of quercetin and QUE@SeNPs/CS/PVPNFs only 
decompose when caused by chitosanase secretion from gut microbiota. In vivo 
imaging showed that the residence time of QUE@SeNPs/CS/PVPNFs was longer than 
that of QUE@SeNPs. Thus, it significantly decreased the lipid concentrations in 
liver, which further inhibited insulin resistance in mice. Moreover, 
QUE@SeNPs/CS/PVPNFs treatment improves gut barrier integrity, increased the 
relative abundance of anti-obesity and anti-inflammation related bacterial 
including Akkermansia, Lactobacillus and Bacteroides. Consequently, the 
inflammatory factor (IL-β and TNF-α) levels in gut, liver and brain were also 
decreased. Nissl and PSD-95 staining indicated that QUE@SeNPs/CS/PVPNFs 
ameliorated synapse dysfunction in the brain. Therefore, QUE@SeNPs/CS/PVPNFs has 
a greater effect than QUE@SeNPs in improving cognitive ability in Morris water 
maze. Overall, QUE@SeNPs/CS/PVPNFs with prolonged residence time attenuates 
cognitive disorder via gut-liver-brain axis in AD.

The deposition of aggregated amyloid β (Aβ) is considered as a key factor for 
Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Previously, we demonstrated that a carboxylated 
Zn-phthalocyanine (ZnPc) inhibits Aβ fibril formation, consequently protects 
neurons in culture. This study evaluated the effects of ZnPc on pathological 
changes in an AD mouse model (J20). Nine-month-old J20 mice received weekly 
intraperitoneal injection of ZnPc (2 and 4 mg/kg) for 12 weeks. Cognitive 
performance was assessed using Y-maze and open field tests. ZnPc levels in the 
tissues were evaluated using near-infrared microscopy and spectroscopy. ZnPc 
accumulated primarily in the liver and kidney. A considerable amount was also 
detected in brain tissue, where it co-localized with neurons, microglia, and 
extracellularly deposited Aβ. ZnPc treatment (2 mg/kg) significantly improved 
cognitive functions of J20 mice. Immunostaining results showed that Aβ was 
positive intracellularly in neurons, and extracellularly around the vessels and 
parenchyma in the cortex and hippocampus of PBS-treated J20 mice, which was 
significantly decreased in ZnPc-treated J20 mice in a dose-dependent manner. 
Nissl staining demonstrated that neuronal numbers were increased both in the 
cortex and hippocampus. GFAP-positive astrocytes and Iba-1 positive microglia 
were decreased by ZnPc treatment. Also, vessel numbers were increased in 
ZnPc-treated groups. In PBS-treated group, aquaporin 4 immunopositive area 
extended beyond STL-positive vessels into the parenchyma, which was confined 
primarily around the vessels in the ZnPc-treated group. Claudin 5 levels were 
increased in ZnPc-treated group. Therefore, ZnPc can decrease brain Aβ 
deposition in J20 mice, suggesting it as a potential therapeutic agent for AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), the predominant form of dementia, is a 
neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by 
a subtle onset and a spectrum of cognitive and functional declines. The clinical 
manifestation of AD encompasses memory deficits, cognitive deterioration, and 
behavioral disturbances, culminating in a severe impairment of daily living 
skills. Despite its high prevalence, accounting for 60-70% of all dementia 
cases, there remains an absence of curative therapeutics. Microglia (MG), the 
resident immune cells of the CNS, exhibit a bifurcated role in AD pathogenesis. 
Functioning in a neuroprotective capacity, MGs express scavenger receptors, 
facilitating the clearance of [Formula: see text]-amyloid protein (A[Formula: 
see text]) and cellular debris. Conversely, aberrant activation of MGs can lead 
to the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, thereby propagating 
neuroinflammatory responses that are detrimental to neuronal integrity. The 
dynamics of MG activation and the ensuing neuroinflammation are pivotal in the 
evolution of AD. Chinese medicine (CM), a treasure trove of traditional Chinese 
cultural practices, has demonstrated significant potential in the therapeutic 
management of AD. Over the past triennium, CM has garnered considerable research 
attention for its multifaceted approaches to AD, including the regulation of MG 
polarization. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the origins, 
polarization dynamics, and mechanistic interplay of MG with AD pathology. It 
further explores the nexus between MG polarization and cardinal pathological 
hallmarks of AD, such as A[Formula: see text] plaque deposition, 
hyperphosphorylation of tau, synaptic plasticity impairments, neuroinflammation, 
and brain-gut-axis dysregulation. The review also encapsulates the therapeutic 
strategies of CM, which encompass monomers, formulae, and acupuncture. These 
strategies modulate MG polarization in the context of AD treatment, thereby 
providing a robust theoretical framework in which to conduct future 
investigative endeavors in both the clinical and preclinical realms.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the 
deposition of beta-amyloid (Aβ) peptides. Microglia-mediated neuroinflammation 
is one of the primary contributors to the pathogenesis of AD. Withanolides, the 
main constituents in the leaves of Datura stramonium L., exhibit 
anti-neuroinflammatory activity. It is unknown if total withanolide from Datura 
stramonium L. leaves (TWD) reduces nerve inflammation and potentially mitigates 
the pathogenic elements of AD. This study examined the potential effects of TWD 
on neuroinflammation in triple transgenic AD (3 × Tg-AD) mice and LPS-induced 
BV-2, as well as associated signaling pathways. HPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS was used in 
this study to examine the main chemical components of the TWD extract. 3 × Tg-AD 
as in vivo AD models and LPS induce BV-2 cells in vitro AD models. The molecular 
process was investigated by ELISA, WB, IHC, and IF. In 3 × Tg-AD mice, TWD 
dramatically ameliorates cognitive impairment. Treatment with TWD can counteract 
the increased activation of microglia and Aβ deposits observed in 3 × Tg-AD 
mice. Further research indicates that TWD can enhance TOM 1 and mitigate 
inflammatory responses by reducing the levels of IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, IL1R1, and 
IL-18. Additionally, TWD may inhibit neuroinflammation through the pathways of 
IL1R1/MyD88/NF-κB and NLRP3/IL-1β/IL1R1. In summary, this study reveals for the 
first time that TWD effectively improves cognitive deficits in 3 × Tg-AD mice by 
modulating the IL1R1/MyD88/NF-κB and NLRP3/IL-1β/IL1R1 pathways. It also 
alleviates excessive activation of microglia and suppresses Aβ accumulation. 
Therefore, TWD has the potential as a therapeutic agent for AD.

BACKGROUND: Perivascular spaces (PVS) on brain MRI are surrogates for small 
parenchymal blood vessels and their perivascular compartment, and may relate to 
brain health. However, it is unknown whether PVS can predict dementia risk and 
brain atrophy trajectories in participants without dementia, as longitudinal 
studies on PVS are scarce and current methods for PVS assessment lack robustness 
and inter-scanner reproducibility.
METHODS: We developed a robust algorithm to automatically assess PVS count and 
size on clinical MRI, and investigated 1) their relationship with dementia risk 
and brain atrophy in participants without dementia, 2) their longitudinal 
evolution, and 3) their potential use as a screening tool in simulated clinical 
trials. We analysed 46,478 clinical measurements of cognitive functioning and 
20,845 brain MRI scans from 10,004 participants (71.1 ± 9.7 years-old, 56.6% 
women) from three publicly available observational studies on ageing and 
dementia (the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, the National 
Alzheimer's Coordinating Centre database, and the Open Access Series of Imaging 
Studies). Clinical and MRI data collected between 2004 and 2022 were analysed 
with consistent methods, controlling for confounding factors, and combined using 
mixed-effects models.
FINDINGS: Our fully-automated method for PVS assessment showed excellent 
inter-scanner reproducibility (intraclass correlation coefficients >0.8). Fewer 
PVS and larger PVS diameter at baseline predicted higher dementia risk and 
accelerated brain atrophy. Longitudinal trajectories of PVS markers differed 
significantly in participants without dementia who converted to dementia 
compared with non-converters. In simulated placebo-controlled trials for 
treatments targeting cognitive decline, screening out participants at low risk 
of dementia based on our PVS markers enhanced the power of the trial 
independently of Alzheimer's disease biomarkers.
INTERPRETATION: These robust cerebrovascular markers predict dementia risk and 
brain atrophy and may improve risk-stratification of patients, potentially 
reducing cost and increasing throughput of clinical trials to combat dementia.

Correctly diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD) and identifying pathogenic brain 
regions and genes play a vital role in understanding the AD and developing 
effective prevention and treatment strategies. Recent works combine imaging and 
genetic data, and leverage the strengths of both modalities to achieve better 
classification results. In this work, we propose MCA-GCN, a Multi-stream 
Cross-Attention and Graph Convolutional Network-based classification method for 
AD patients. It first constructs a brain region-gene association network based 
on brain region fMRI time series and gene SNP data. Then it integrates the 
absolute and relative positions of the brain region time series to obtain a new 
brain region time series containing temporal information. Then long-range and 
local association features between brain regions and genes are sequentially 
aggregated by multi-stream cross-attention and graph convolutional networks. 
Finally, the learned brain region and gene features are input to the fully 
connected network to predict AD types. Experimental results on the ADNI dataset 
show that our model outperforms other methods in AD classification tasks. 
Moreover, MCA-GCN designed a multi-stage feature scoring process to extract 
high-risk genes and brain regions related to disease classification.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative 
disorder that severely affects cognitive functions and memory. Early detection 
is crucial for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes. However, 
traditional diagnostic tools, such as MRI and PET scans, are costly and less 
accessible. This study aims to develop an automated, cost-effective digital 
diagnostic approach using deep learning (DL) and computer-aided detection (CAD) 
methods for early AD identification and classification.
METHODS: The proposed framework utilizes pretrained convolutional neural 
networks (CNNs) for feature extraction, integrated with two classifiers: 
multi-class support vector machine (MSVM) and artificial neural network (ANN). A 
dataset categorized into four groups-non-demented, very mild demented, mild 
demented, and moderate demented-was employed for evaluation. To optimize the 
classification process, a texture-based algorithm was applied for feature 
reduction, enhancing computational efficiency and reducing processing time.
RESULTS: The system demonstrated high statistical performance, achieving an 
accuracy of 91%, precision of 95%, and recall of 90%. Among the initial set of 
twenty-two texture features, seven were identified as particularly effective in 
differentiating normal cases from mild AD stages, significantly streamlining the 
classification process. These results validate the robustness and efficacy of 
the proposed DL-based CAD system.
CONCLUSION: This study presents a reliable and affordable solution for early AD 
detection and diagnosis. The proposed system outperforms existing 
state-of-the-art models and offers a valuable tool for timely treatment 
planning. Future research should explore its application to larger, more diverse 
datasets and investigate integration with other imaging modalities, such as MRI, 
to further enhance diagnostic precision.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and epileptic seizure are among 
the most common health problems in the elderly population. This study aimed to 
estimate the prevalence rate and predictors of seizures in sporadic AD patients.
METHODS: The study was conducted by retrospectively for a period of 10 years 
examining the file records. Patients were selected among the patients diagnosed 
with probable sporadic late onset AD according to the National Institute of 
Neurological Communicative Disorders and Stroke AD and related disorders 
association criteria and the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental 
disorders (n=451). In our 213 sporadic AD patients who were followed up 
regularly and had a follow up examination in the last 6 months, the file records 
were examined, scanned and questioned for the presence of epileptic seizures.
RESULTS: The prevalence of non provoked generalized tonic clonic seizures in 
sporadic AD was found to be 6.57% (n=14). Neuroleptic use, presence of diabetes 
mellitus (DM) and/or treatment, presence of ischemic heart disease (IHD) and/or 
treatment were found to be 2.99 times, 1.91 times and 3.09 times higher in our 
patients who had seizures, respectively. When the factors that can affect 
seizures were examined, the use of neuroleptics and the presence of IHD and/or 
treatment were found to be statistically significant in terms of the risk of 
seizure in AD.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of neuroleptics, the presence of IHD and DM and/or their 
medications could facilitate the development of unprovoked generalized tonic 
clonic seizures in sporadic AD. It is doubtful whether the seizures are primary 
or secondary generalized.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In preparation for future clinical trials involving 
individuals with Alzheimer disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 
dementia, it is important to ascertain the widespread impact of symptoms from 
the direct perspectives of patients and caregivers. In this study, we performed 
cross-sectional surveys using large-scale patient and caregiver data to identify 
the prevalence and average impact of symptoms and symptomatic themes experienced 
by adults with AD, MCI, and dementia. Subsequent analyses were used to determine 
which demographic and disease-specific factors are associated with more severe 
disease.
METHODS: Fifteen adults with AD (6), MCI (8), and dementia (1) and 15 caregivers 
of adults with AD (7), MCI (6), and dementia (2) participated in qualitative 
interviews providing 1,166 and 1,097 unique quotes pertaining to symptom burden. 
Using open-ended questions from a comprehensive interview guide, participants 
were asked to identify the symptoms of AD that have the greatest effect on their 
lives or the lives of the individual for whom they provide care. A 
cross-sectional survey was then implemented inquiring about the potential 
symptoms of importance identified during preliminary qualitative interviews. 
Four-hundred thirty-three individuals (patients and caregivers) participated in 
the cross-sectional survey, providing more than 35,000 symptom rating responses. 
Subsequent analyses were conducted to determine how demographic and 
disease-specific characteristics correlate with symptomatic theme prevalence.
RESULTS: The most frequent symptomatic themes reported by individuals with AD, 
MCI, and dementia in the cross-sectional survey were memory problems (99.0%), 
problems thinking (90.3%), and communication difficulties (80.4%). Patients 
identified decreased satisfaction in social situations (1.45), fatigue (1.45), 
and memory problems (1.41) as the most impactful symptomatic themes (range 0-4). 
Patient-reported symptomatic theme prevalence was strongly associated with the 
Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) for neurologic disability.
DISCUSSION: Individuals with AD, MCI, and dementia experience a variety of 
symptoms that significantly affect their daily lives. These symptoms, many 
underrecognized, are of variable importance to individuals with these diseases 
and may inform potential targets for future therapeutic intervention as well as 
facilitate the development and validation of disease-specific outcome measures.

Microglial Depletion, a New Tool in Neuroinflammatory Disorders: Comparison of 
Pharmacological Inhibitors of the CSF-1R.

A growing body of evidence highlights the importance of microglia, the resident 
immune cells of the CNS, and their pro-inflammatory activation in the onset of 
many neurological diseases. Microglial proliferation, differentiation, and 
survival are highly dependent on the CSF-1 signaling pathway, which can be 
pharmacologically modulated by inhibiting its receptor, CSF-1R. Pharmacological 
inhibition of CSF-1R leads to an almost complete microglial depletion whereas 
treatment arrest allows for subsequent repopulation. Microglial depletion has 
shown promising results in many animal models of neurodegenerative diseases 
(Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease, or multiple sclerosis) where 
transitory microglial depletion reduced neuroinflammation and improved 
behavioral test results. In this review, we will focus on the comparison of 
three different pharmacological CSF-1R inhibitors (PLX3397, PLX5622, and GW2580) 
regarding microglial depletion. We will also highlight the promising results 
obtained by microglial depletion strategies in adult models of neurological 
disorders and argue they could also prove promising in neurodevelopmental 
diseases associated with microglial activation and neuroinflammation. Finally, 
we will discuss the lack of knowledge about the effects of these strategies on 
neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes in adults and during neurodevelopment.

BACKGROUND: Nicastrin, a subunit of the γ-secretase complex, is encoded by the 
NCSTN gene and regulates notch signaling, it is involved in the pathogenesis of 
hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), Alzheimer disease (AD), and liver cancer. 
However, the animal models for studying HS are relatively scarce.
METHODS: CRISPR/Cas-mediated genetic engineering was used to generate targeted 
knockout offspring mice (C57BL/6J). Different doses (10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, and 
30 mg/kg) and injection methods (subcutaneous/intraperitoneal/gavage injection) 
of tamoxifen were used to induce the construction of NCSTN knockout mice (mice 
model). The expressions of nicastrin, NICD1, hes1 in skin, brain, and liver 
tissue in mice model and wild-type (WT) mice were measured by qRT-PCR and IHC.
RESULTS: The construction of mice model was successfully induced by tamoxifen, 
knockout efficiency was 93%, there was no difference in knockout efficiency 
among three doses, injection methods, genders (P > 0.05). HS-like lesions 
appeared on the skin of NCSTN knockout mice after 1 month of treatment with 
tamoxifen, male mice had a higher number of skin lesions compared to female mice 
(male vs female = 76.5% vs 41.7%, P = 0.027). Compared with WT mice, the 
expressions of nicastrin (skin P = 0.0009, brain P = 0.0194, liver P = 0.0066), 
NICD1 (skin P = 0.0115, brain P = 0.0307, liver P = 0.008), hes1 (skin 
P = 0.0476, brain P = 0.0143, liver P = 0.0003) in mice model all decreased.
CONCLUSIONS: The NCSTN knockout mouse might be employed as HS animal model; 
Reducing nicastrin may affect the expression of notch1-hes1 pathway molecules in 
skin, brain, and liver tissues; low dose (10 mg/kg/d) tamoxifen could be used to 
induce the deletion of the target gene in mice.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by 
cognitive impairment and memory deficit. Even with extensive research and 
studies, presently, there is no effective treatment for the management of AD. 
Besides, most of drugs used in the treatment of AD did not avert the AD 
neuropathology, and the disease still in a progressive status. For example, 
acetyl cholinesterase inhibitors are associated with many adverse effects, such 
as insomnia and nightmares. As well, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors augment 
cholinergic neurotransmission leading to the development of adverse effects 
related to high acetylcholine level, such as salivation, rhinorrhea, vomiting, 
loss of appetite, and seizure. Furthermore, tacrine has poor bioavailability and 
causes hepatotoxicity. These commonly used drugs do not manage the original 
causes of AD. For those reasons, natural products were repurposed for the 
treatment of AD and neurodegenerative diseases. It has been shown that 
phytochemicals produce neuroprotective effects against the development and 
progression of neurodegenerative diseases by different mechanisms, including 
antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Quercetin (QCN) has been reported to 
exert an effective neuroprotective effect against AD and other neurodegenerative 
diseases by lessening oxidative stress. In this review, electronic databases 
such as PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched for possible relevant 
studies and article linking the effect of QCN on AD. Findings from this review 
highlighted that many studies highlighted different mechanistic signaling 
pathways regarding the neuroprotective effect of QCN in AD. Nevertheless, the 
precise molecular mechanism of QCN in AD was not completely clarified. 
Consequently, this review aims to discuss the molecular mechanism of QCN in AD.

Tau pathology is a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases, including 
frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease. However, the sequence of events 
and the form of tau that confers toxicity are still unclear, due in large part 
to the lack of physiological models of tauopathy initiation and progression in 
which to test hypotheses. We have developed a series of targeted mice expressing 
frontotemporal-dementia-causing mutations in the humanized MAPT gene to 
investigate the earliest stages of tauopathy. MAPTInt10+3G>A and 
MAPTS305N;Int10+3G>A lines show abundant hyperphosphorylated tau in the 
hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, but they do not develop seed-competent 
fibrillar structures. Accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau was accompanied by 
neurite degeneration, loss of viable synapses and indicators of behavioral 
abnormalities. Our results demonstrate that neuronal toxicity can occur in the 
absence of fibrillar, higher-order structures and that tau hyperphosphorylation 
is probably involved in the earliest etiological events in tauopathies showing 
isoform ratio imbalance.

BACKGROUND: As Alzheimer disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD) progress, 
individuals increasingly require assistance from unpaid, informal caregivers to 
support them in activities of daily living. These caregivers may experience high 
levels of financial, mental, and physical strain associated with providing care. 
CareVirtue is a web-based tool created to connect and support multiple 
individuals across a care network to coordinate care activities and share 
important information, thereby reducing care burden.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to use a computational informatics approach to 
thematically analyze open text written by AD/ADRD caregivers in the CareVirtue 
platform. We then explore relationships between identified themes and use 
patterns.
METHODS: We analyzed journal posts (n=1555 posts; 170,212 words) generated by 51 
unique users of the CareVirtue platform. Latent themes were identified using a 
neural network approach to topic modeling. We calculated a sentiment score for 
each post using the Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner. We then 
examined relationships between identified topics; semantic sentiment; and 
use-related data, including post word count and self-reported mood.
RESULTS: We identified 5 primary topics in users' journal posts, including 
descriptions of specific events, professional and medical care, routine daily 
activities, nighttime symptoms, and bathroom/toileting issues. This 5-topic 
model demonstrated adequate fit to the data, having the highest coherence score 
(0.41) among those tested. We observed group differences across these topics in 
both word count and semantic sentiment. Further, posts made in the evening were 
both longer and more semantically positive than other times of the day.
CONCLUSIONS: Users of the CareVirtue platform journaled about a variety of 
different topics, including generalized experiences and specific behavioral 
symptomology of AD/ADRD, suggesting a desire to record and share broadly across 
the care network. Posts were the most positive in the early evening when the 
tool was used habitually, rather than when writing about acute events or 
symptomology. We discuss the value of embedding informatics-based tools into 
digital interventions to facilitate real-time content delivery.

Synaptic dysfunction is one of the earliest cellular defects observed in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), occurring before 
widespread protein aggregation, neuronal loss, and cognitive decline. While the 
field has focused on the aggregation of Tau and α-Synuclein (α-Syn), emerging 
evidence suggests that these proteins may drive presynaptic pathology even 
before their aggregation. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms by which Tau 
and α-Syn affect presynaptic terminals offers an opportunity for developing 
innovative therapeutics aimed at preserving synapses and potentially halting 
neurodegeneration. This review focuses on the molecular defects that converge on 
presynaptic dysfunction caused by Tau and α-Syn. Both proteins have 
physiological roles in synapses. However, during disease, they acquire abnormal 
functions due to aberrant interactions and mislocalization. We provide an 
overview of current research on different essential presynaptic pathways 
influenced by Tau and α-Syn. Finally, we highlight promising therapeutic targets 
aimed at maintaining synaptic function in both tauopathies and 
synucleinopathies.

Precision diagnosis of cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease for 
therapeutic interventions.

With the advent of anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody (AAMA) therapy, precision 
diagnosis is necessary for identifying appropriate patients with cognitive 
disorders due to Alzheimer's disease. Therapy with AAMAs requires that 
candidates be diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia, have 
elevated brain amyloid-β, have good physical, psychiatric, and medical health, 
and lack clinical or biomarker evidence of potentially impactful non-Alzheimer 
brain disorders. The first three diagnostic activities are the core of the 
Clinical Practice Guidelines, but the last element of the precision diagnosis 
requires new decision-making tools for recognizing multi-etiology cognitive 
impairment. Within the context of shared decision-making between clinician, 
patient, and family, proper diagnosis is essential. In addition to discussing 
the benefits and risks of AAMA therapy, the experienced clinician must 
empathetically assist in bridging the gap between expectations of benefit and 
the patient's overall diagnostic suitability for AAMA therapy. HIGHLIGHTS: In 
order to prescribe an anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody (AAMA) to the right 
patients, those selected for treatment should be diagnosed with mild cognitive 
impairment or mild dementia, have elevated brain amyloid-β (Aβ), and have good 
physical, psychiatric, or medical health. Persons with Alzheimer's biology as 
the primary etiology are the ideal AAMA treatment recipients. A novel activity 
necessary to optimize therapeutic response is to exclude persons with clinical 
or biomarker evidence of alternative contributory brain disorders. While mild 
clinical severity and elevated brain amyloid-β are essential elements for 
selecting patients for AAMA treatment, clinical judgment is required to weigh 
the implications of more advanced disease severity, other medical 
co-morbidities, and the presence of other contributory neuropathologies.

Efforts to prevent dementia can benefit from precision interventions delivered 
to the right population at the right time; that is, when the potential to reduce 
risk is the highest. Young adults (aged 18-39 years) are a neglected population 
in dementia research and policy making despite being highly exposed to several 
known modifiable risk factors. The risk and protective factors that have the 
biggest effect on dementia outcomes in young adulthood, and how these 
associations differ across regions and groups, still remain unclear. To address 
these uncertainties, the Next Generation Brain Health team convened a 
multidisciplinary expert group representing 15 nations across six continents. We 
identified several high-priority modifiable factors in young adulthood and 
devised five key recommendations for promoting brain health, ranging from 
individual to policy levels. Increasing research and policy focus on brain 
health across the life course, inclusive of younger populations, is the next 
crucial step in the efforts to prevent dementia at the global level.

"A patent review on arachidonic acid lipoxygenase (LOX) inhibitors for the 
treatment of neurodegenerative diseases (2018-present)".

Sciences, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece.

INTRODUCTION: Neuroinflammation is correlated to neurodegenerative diseases like 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Multiple 
Sclerosis (MS), Huntington Disease (HD), and Parkinson's disease (PD). A lot of 
recent research and patents are focused on the design and synthesis of 
arachidonic acid lipoxygenase (ALOX) inhibitors for the treatment of 
neurodegenerative diseases.
AREAS COVERED: The survey covers natural products, synthesis, hybrids, and 
assessments of biological effects in biological studies as ALOX inhibitors. A 
survey of patent publications from 2018 to present, taken from Google Scholar, 
Espanet, Web of Science, Drugbank, Scopus, or PubMed is analyzed.
EXPERT OPINION: The authors suggest that (i) numerous areas of 
biology-pharmacology need to be considered: selectivity, in vivo studies, 
toxicity, bioavailability, and drug-likeness, the mechanism of action in 
different animals and humans, evaluation of more efficient and selective 
biological tests; (ii) synthetic method outbalance in the discovery and 
production of ALOX inhibitors with greater selectivity. Several ALOX inhibitors 
show promising results for the treatment of neurological disorders. Their 
clinical evaluation will be critical to assess therapeutic utility. The 
compounds for which the mechanism of action and their bioavailability are well 
defined can be used as lead compounds for the treatment of neurodegenerative 
diseases.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by cerebral amyloid 
plaques and neurofibrillary tangles and disruption of large-scale brain networks 
(LSBNs). Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has emerged as a potential 
non-invasive AD treatment that may serve as an adjunct therapy with FDA approved 
medications.
METHODS: We conducted a 10-subject open label, single site study evaluating the 
effect of functional connectivity-resting state functional MRI guided-approach 
to TMS targeting with dysfunctional LSBNs in subjects with biomarker-confirmed 
early-stage AD (https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05292222). Subjects 
underwent pre-post imaging and testing to assess connectivity dysfunction and 
cognition. All participants received intermittent theta burst stimulation 
[(iTBS), (80% motor threshold; 5 sessions per day; 5 days; 3 targets; 18,000 
pulses/day)] over 2 weeks. Three Human Connectome Project (HCP) defined 
parcellations were targeted, with one common right temporal area G dorsal (RTGd) 
target across all subjects and two personalized.
RESULTS: We identified the following parcellations to be dysfunctional: RTGd, 
left area 8A ventral (L8Av), left area 8B lateral (L8BL), and left area 55b 
(L55b). There were no changes in these parcellations after treatment, but 
subjects showed improvement on the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of 
Neuropsychological Status attention index (9.7; p = 0.01). No subject dropped 
out of the treatment, though 3 participants were unable to tolerate the RTGd 
target due to facial twitching (n = 2) and anxiety (n = 1).
CONCLUSION: Accelerated iTBS protocol was well-tolerated and personalized 
target-based treatment is feasible in early-stage AD. Further sham-controlled 
clinical trials are necessary to determine if this is an effective adjunctive 
treatment in early-stage AD.

Biomimetic nanocarriers, engineered to mimic the characteristics of native 
cells, offer a revolutionary approach in the treatment of various complex human 
diseases. This strategy enhances drug delivery by leveraging the innate 
properties of cellular components, thereby improving biocompatibility and 
targeting specificity. Biomimetic nanocarriers demonstrate significant 
advancements in drug delivery systems against cancer therapy, Alzheimer's 
disease, autoimmune diseases, and viral infections such as COVID-19. Here, we 
address the therapeutic applications of biomimetic nanocarriers and their 
promising strategy for personalized medicine.

Psychological telephone triage system for outpatient memory clinics - a way for 
adaptation to new challenges of increasing dementia prevalence and new treatment 
options?

BACKGROUND: The increasing prevalence of dementia and new therapeutic 
developments for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have created an urgent need for rapid 
and cost-effective methods to diagnose those affected in the early stages of the 
disease. Unlike emergency departments, memory clinics lack triage systems, e.g. 
the Manchester Triage System.
METHOD: This retrospective, observational study evaluated the effects of a 
psychological telephone triage (PTT) system for people requesting an initial 
assessment at a specialized outpatient memory clinic over a 15-months period in 
terms of waiting times, staff resources, and as a screening method for cognitive 
disorders. The PTT consisted of an interdisciplinary pre-screening of available 
preliminary patient information prior to telephone contact, a semi-structured 
interview of approximately 30 min with a clinical psychologist, and telephone 
psychological counseling if there was no indication for an on-site dementia 
assessment. Based on the PTT interview, patients were triaged using a 4-level 
priority system (red = acute, yellow = subacute, green = not acute, blue = no 
indication/counseling). The results were compared with data from the two years 
prior to the introduction of PTT.
RESULTS: The data of 612 people (327 before and 285 after the introduction of 
PTT) who called the secretary's office between January 1, 2021 and April 30, 
2024 and requested an initial assessment were analyzed. Of the original sample 
who called after the introduction of PTT, 66.7% had an indication for an on-site 
visit and were invited to do so. This was accepted by 51.6%. A further 14% 
received psychological telephone counseling, resulting in a 34% reduction in 
on-site visits. Patients triaged as acute cases had the shortest waiting time 
and presented with the most severe cognitive and functional symptoms at the 
on-site visit.
DISCUSSION: Our study shows that PTT is an effective method to identify patients 
with urgent need for an initial dementia assessment and to provide psychological 
counseling as an alternative to on-site visits. We expect that this will reduce 
the number of emergency admissions and thus the burden on caregivers and the 
healthcare system. This PTT concept can thus help to better manage the 
increasing need for initial assessments in the context of new therapies for AD 
and the increasing prevalence of dementia in general.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), a chronic neurodegenerative disease, is clinically 
characterized by loss of memory and learning ability among other neurological 
deficits. Amyloid plaques, hyperphosphorylated tau protein, and neurofibrillary 
tangles involve in AD etiology. Meanwhile, enzymes and their inhibitors have 
become the focus of research in AD treatment. In this review, the molecular 
mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of AD were overviewed and various 
enzymes such as acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), 
β-secretase, γ-secretase, monoamine oxidase (MAO), and receptor of advanced 
glycation end products (RAGE) were highlighted as potential targets for AD 
treatment. Several hybrid molecules with essential substructures derived from 
various chemotypes have demonstrated desired pharmacological activity. It is 
envisioned that the development of new drugs that inhibit enzymes involved in AD 
is a future trend in the management of the disease.

INTRODUCTION AND METHODS: Aiming to evaluate safety aspects of a recently 
proposed approach to target Alzheimer's disease, we mimicked a complex boron 
neutron capture therapy field using a mixed beam consisting of high- and 
low-linear energy transfer (LET) radiation, 241Am alpha particles (α) and/or 
X-ray radiation respectively, in human microglial (HMC3) cells.
RESULTS: Acute exposure to 2 Gy X-rays induced the strongest response in the 
formation of γH2AX foci 30 min post irradiation, while α- and mixed beam-induced 
damage (α:X-ray = 3:1) sustained longer. Fractionation of the same total dose 
(0.4 Gy daily) induced a similar number of γH2AX foci as after acute radiation, 
however, α- or mixed irradiation caused a higher expression of DNA damage 
response genes CDKN1A and MDM2 24 h after the last fraction, as well as a 
stronger decrease in cell viability and clonogenic survival compared to acute 
exposure. Phosphorylation of STING, followed by phosphorylation of NF-κB subunit 
p65, was rapidly induced (1 or 3 h, respectively) after the last fraction by all 
radiation qualities. This led to IL-1β secretion into the medium, strongly 
elevated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes and enhanced phagocytosis 
after fractionated exposure to α- and mixed beam-irradiation compared to their 
acute counterparts 24 h post-irradiation. Nevertheless, all inflammatory changes 
were returning to basal levels or below 10-14 days post irradiation.
DISCUSSION: In conclusion, we demonstrate strong transient pro-inflammatory 
induction by daily high-LET radiation in a microglia model, triggering 
phagocytosis which may aid in clearing amyloid beta, but importantly, from a 
safety perspective, without long-term alterations.

slows the advancement of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Natural compounds rich in 
polyphenols have garnered attention as a non-pharmacological means of treating 
and preventing AD. The primary component of wine, grape seeds, and nuts is 
polyphenols. Research suggests that polyphenols slow down the rate of 
neurodegeneration in AD and lessen learning impairment. Furthermore, polyphenols 
lessen brain impairments related to cognition. Additionally, polyphenols can 
specifically restructure amyloid-β (Aβ) structures and soluble oligomers into 
non-toxic alternative species. They have also been revealed to increase 
brain-derived neurotrophic factors expression, suggesting that they have a 
positive impact on the creation of neurotrophins. The benefits of polyphenol 
supplementation and exercise, which can both provide neuroprotection, have not 
been well studied in AD patients. This review aimed to investigate the effects 
of combined exercise polyphenols on inflammation, neuroprotection, several 
conformational toxic species of Aβ, and Aβ-induced apoptosis in AD.

BackgroundMost individuals living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias 
(ADRD) experience one or more neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as agitation which 
negatively impacts their quality of life. Adapted dance integrates recorded 
music and movement that is appropriate for people with cognitive limitations. 
Adapted dance may be an enjoyable activity for persons living with ADRD and may 
provide psychological and physical benefits.ObjectiveThe purpose of this pilot 
study was to assess the feasibility of an adapted dance intervention with 
persons with ADRD and the impacts of 12 weeks of adapted dancing on agitation, 
balance, gait, lower extremity strength, and caregiver burden.MethodsThis study 
used an experimental design with repeated measures. Participants with ADRD were 
randomly assigned to a usual care or adapted line dance group that met 60 min 
twice a week. At pre-test, 4-, 8-, and 12 weeks of intervention, measures were 
collected for agitation, balance, gait, lower extremity strength, and caregiver 
burden.ResultsThe sample consisted of 4 males and 12 females (n = 16) with ADRD 
whose age ranged from 69-97 years. Twelve weeks of adapted line dance was found 
acceptable by ADRD participants. Participants attended ≥90% of dance sessions 
and did not experience loss of balance or fall. ADRD participants danced an 
average of 70 min per week. Both groups had improvements in agitation from 
baseline to 12 weeks.ConclusionsTwelve weeks of adapted dance was shown to be 
feasible and enjoyable for persons living with ADRD. Clinicians should consider 
adapted dance as part of an exercise prescription.

Research Institute, Faculty of Health Medicine and Life Sciences, Maastricht 
University, Maastricht, the Netherlands.

The prevention of dementia is increasingly a task for public health promotion 
and aims at the general public. This likewise holds for potentially modifiable 
lifestyle risk factors and biomarkers indicating susceptibility. This commentary 
argues that from a public health ethical perspective, there is a significant 
overlap between the implications and requirements of the biomedical domain and 
lifestyle approaches. What's more, once public awareness of Alzheimer's disease 
prevention or risk reduction is further established, the public will likely 
intermix options and advice. Public health ethical recommendations should 
pro-actively reflect on upcoming questions, concerns, and remedies, combine but 
not separate both domains and anticipate their conceivable interactions.

Niemann Pick type C1 (NPC1) is a rare, fatal disorder characterized by endosomal 
lipid accumulation that leads to damage of both peripheral organs and central 
nervous system (cerebellum and hippocampus are especially affected). Currently, 
miglustat is the only approved drug for NPC1, thus the identification of new 
treatments is mandatory. We have previously demonstrated that the drug 
dipyridamole (DIP), an enhancer of adenosine signaling, can reduce the 
pathological phenotype in patient-derived fibroblasts. In this paper, we 
evaluated the in vivo effects of DIP in NPC1 mice. Male and female NPC1nih mice 
were treated with DIP 30 mg/kg i.p. from 28 to 64 days of age. Motor function 
was assessed by Erasmus Ladder test, hippocampal cognitive decline by Novel 
Object Recognition test and brain pathology by immunofluorescence and 
biochemical assays. Peripheral pathology was evaluated by analyzing lipid 
accumulation in spleen and liver (HP-TLC). In NPC1, mice DIP rescued recognition 
memory and increased hippocampal expression of calbindin. On the contrary, the 
drug was unable to improve motor function, cerebellar pathology and lipid 
accumulation in spleen and liver. Our results demonstrated that DIP selectively 
ameliorates the cognitive impairment in NPC1 mice. This drug could thus 
represent a valuable therapeutic tool to be used in combination with other 
treatments in NPC1.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible brain disorder that led to memory 
loss and disrupts daily life. Earlier strategies to treat AD such as 
acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) drugs are not showing effectiveness due 
to the inability to cross the blood-brain barrier. Moreover, traditional AChEI 
provides limited efficacy in terms of bioavailability and solubility for 
treating AD treatment. Many of the current drugs such as donepezil taken to 
treat the disease exhibited harmful side effects. Hence, researchers are keen to 
find the alternative effective therapeutic agents for treating AD. This review 
summarizes the recent advancement in nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems 
of herbal drugs such as Curcumin, Ginkgo biloba, Salvia officinalis, etc for the 
prevention and cure of AD. Herbal drugs proved useful in treating neuronal 
disorders such as AD but exhibited some limitations like low bioavailability via 
oral drug delivery. Such limitations were overcome by tagging these drugs by 
nanoparticles which enables them to cross the blood-brain barrier and offer the 
delivery of greater concentration of herbal drugs to the brain. Inorganic 
nanoparticle-based drugdelivery systems such as gold nanoparticles and magnetic 
nanoparticles, organic nanoparticulate systems like polymeric micelles and 
dendrimers, and solid polymeric nanoparticles were some of the effective methods 
that have earlier shown potential for enhancing the delivery of herbal drugs to 
the brain. Long-term repeated injection of drugs loaded on nanomaterials can 
lead to the accumulation of nanomaterials in the body without timely and 
effective degradation which can cause serious issues to the brain. Hence, 
nanotechnology-based strategies should involve the formulation of nontoxic 
nanoparticles in such a way that they can significantly transport the drugs 
across the BBB followed by effective degradation of nanoparticles.

Exploring New Structures of Kinase Inhibitors and Multitarget Strategies in 
Alzheimer's Disease Treatment.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatments currently available have ineffective 
results. Previously employed Acetylcholine esterase inhibitors and memantine, an 
NMDA receptor antagonist, target a single target structure that plays a complex 
role in the multifactorial progression of disease. Memantine moderates the toxic 
effects of excessive glutamate activity by blocking NMDA receptors, which 
decreases neurotoxicity in AD, while acetylcholine esterase inhibitors function 
by blocking cholinergic receptors (muscarinic and nicotinic), preventing the 
breakdown of acetylcholine, thereby enhancing cholinergic transmission, thus 
improving cognitive functions in mild to moderate stages of AD. Every drug class 
targets a distinct facet of the intricate pathophysiology of AD, indicating the 
diverse strategy required to counteract the advancement of this 
neurodegenerative disorder. Thus, patients are currently not getting much 
benefit from current drugs. A closer look at the course of AD revealed several 
potential target structures for future drug discovery. AD drug development 
strategies focus on developing new target structures in addition to 
well-established ones for combination treatment regimens, ideally with a single 
drug that can target two different target structures. Because of their roles in 
AD progression pathways like pathologic tau protein phosphorylations as well as 
amyloid β toxicity, protein kinases have been identified as potential targets. 
This review will give a quick rundown of the first inhibitors of single protein 
kinases, such as glycogen synthase kinase (gsk3) β, along with cyclin-dependent 
kinase 5. We will also look into novel inhibitors that target recently 
identified protein kinases in Alzheimer's disease, such as dual-specificity 
tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A). Additionally, 
multitargeting inhibitors, which target multiple protein kinases as well as 
those thought to be involved in other processes related to AD will be discussed. 
This kind of multitargeting offers prospective hope for improved patient 
outcomes down the road since it is the most effective way to impede 
multifactorial disease development.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is marked by cognitive decline, amyloid 
plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and cholinergic loss. Due to the limited 
success of amyloid-targeted therapies, attention has shifted to new non-amyloid 
targets like phosphodiesterases (PDE). This study investigates the potential of 
Flemingia vestita (FV) phytomolecules and derivatives, particularly 
8-Prenyldaidzein, in AD treatment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Phytocompounds and derivatives were screened for 
drug-likeness, toxicity, BBB permeability, and ADME profiles. Molecular docking 
was conducted with PDE5A, BACE-1, and AChE, followed by molecular dynamics (MD) 
simulations on the best binding complexes.
RESULTS: 8-Prenyldaidzein, a derivative of daidzein, demonstrated favorable 
drug-likeness and ADME properties. It exhibited strong binding to PDE5A, BACE-1, 
and AChE, with MD simulations confirming stable protein-ligand interactions.
DISCUSSION: The multi-target potential of 8-Prenyldaidzein, particularly through 
non-amyloid pathways, offers a promising approach to AD therapy. Its inhibition 
of PDE5A, BACE-1, and AChE could address multiple aspects of AD pathology.
CONCLUSION: 8-Prenyldaidzein shows strong potential as a multi-target inhibitor 
for AD treatment. While in-silico findings are promising, further experimental 
validation is needed to confirm its clinical applicability.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), characterised by gradual memory loss and 
neurodegeneration, is an important risk to global health. Despite the recent 
advances in the field of neuroscience, the complex biological mechanisms 
underlying the aetiology and pathology of AD have not been elucidated yet. The 
development of amyloid-beta plaques, hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, 
oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation have been identified as important 
components. The genesis of AD has been illuminated by advances in molecular 
techniques, which have shown the contributions of environmental, genetic, and 
epigenetic variables. Ongoing research is focused on the potential of bioactive 
compounds as therapeutic agents. Quercetin, epigallocatechin gallate, huperzine 
A, ginsenosides, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin E, zinc, bacosides from brahmi, 
and withanolide A from ashwagandha are among the compounds that have 
demonstrated encouraging effects in modifying disease pathways. These bioactive 
substances demonstrate their potential for symptomatic relief by providing 
neuroprotective, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and cognitive-enhancing 
properties. The present review presents the recent findings on AD pathogenesis, 
molecular mechanisms, and the impact of natural compounds, offering a 
comprehensive perspective on current and emerging strategies for managing this 
debilitating condition.

INTRODUCTION/OBJECTIVE: Apathy is a multidimensional and complex disease that is 
the primary neuropsychiatric symptom among those diagnosed with Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). Yet, apathy in AD is sometimes underestimated.
METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted using databases such as 
PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. The search utilized specific keywords 
related to apathy and Alzheimer's disease (e.g., "apathy," "Alzheimer's 
disease," "neuropsychiatric symptoms," "front-striatal circuitry"). The studies 
were selected based on pre-defined criteria, including publication date (within 
the last 10 years), peer-reviewed status, and relevance to neurobiological, 
neurochemical, and behavioral aspects of apathy in AD. The articles were 
screened through title and abstract reviews, followed by full-text evaluations 
to ensure they met the inclusion criteria, such as relevance to apathy in 
Alzheimer's patients, study design rigor, and methodological quality.
RESULTS: Some research on the behavioral and neurobiological characteristics of 
apathy in AD points to the role of the front-striatal circuitry, particularly 
the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). In addition, we reviewed the neurochemical, 
neuropsychological, and neuropathological characteristics believed to be 
associated with apathy symptoms.
CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that understanding the intricate 
neurobiological underpinnings of apathy in AD is crucial for developing targeted 
interventions. Our analysis suggests that a multimodal approach, incorporating 
both pharmacological and personalized non-pharmacological strategies, could 
enhance therapeutic efficacy and improve patient outcomes. This highlights the 
need for future research to explore these combined treatment modalities and 
their potential to alleviate apathy in AD patients.

BACKGROUND: The lack of effective therapy for the treatment of Alzheimer's 
disease demands both the search for new drugs and the reconsideration of already 
known substances currently used in other areas of medicine. Drosophila 
melanogaster offers the potential to model features of Alzheimer's disease, 
study disease mechanisms, and conduct drug screening.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this work was to analyze the neuroprotective 
properties of the drug "carnicetine", which is an acetylated form of the natural 
low molecular weight compound L-carnitine. The drug is able to cross the 
blood-brain barrier and is currently used as a means of improving cellular 
metabolism.
METHODS: Using tissue-specific drivers, direct expression of amyloid beta 
peptide (42 amino acids) was exhibited in certain groups of neurons in the 
Drosophila melanogaster brain, namely in dopaminergic and cholinergic neurons. 
The effect of acetyl-L-carnitine (carnicetine) on the death of these neurons and 
the memory of flies was analyzed.
RESULTS: The expression of amyloid beta peptide in dopaminergic or cholinergic 
neurons resulted in neurodegeneration of cholinergic neurons in the Drosophila 
brain and memory impairment. The use of carnicetine added to animal food made it 
possible to treat these disorders. At the same time, no effect on dopaminergic 
neurons was noted.
CONCLUSION: The data obtained confirmed the neuroprotective properties of the 
drug under study, demonstrating its participation in the restoration of the 
cholinergic system and the feasibility of using carnicetine for the treatment of 
Alzheimer's disease.

BACKGROUND: Sense of coherence (SOC) is a disposition to perceive things as 
comprehensible, manageable and meaningful. Lower SOC is associated with 
subjective burden and psychological morbidity in family caregivers, including in 
dementia. However, the evidence-base mainly comprises small-scale or 
cross-sectional studies. More should be known about SOC stability, causal 
relationships, and international contexts. We aimed to study longitudinal links 
between dementia caregivers' SOC, subjective burden, and anxiety and depression 
symptoms in a multinational sample.
METHODS: We analyzed the EU-Actifcare cohort (451 dyads of community-dwelling 
people with mild-moderate dementia and their caregivers). Caregivers' 
assessments included: SOC scale, Relatives' Stress Scale, Hospital Anxiety and 
Depression Scale. A cross-lagged panel model was used to investigate 
associations between these measures at baseline, 6 and 12-month follow-ups, 
controlling for covariates.
RESULTS: Caregivers' subjective burden, anxiety and depression symptoms 
increased over time, SOC remaining overall stable. Considering the first 
six-month follow-up, we found bidirectional relationships between SOC and 
subjective burden, and SOC and anxiety symptoms, while lower SOC predicted 
depression symptoms but not vice versa. For the remaining follow-up period, both 
anxiety and depression symptoms predicted lower SOC but not vice versa.
LIMITATIONS: Convenience sampling precludes full generalizability.
CONCLUSIONS: This large longitudinal study shed more light on interplays between 
SOC, subjective burden and mental health outcomes in dementia caregivers. 
Findings were consistent with SOC potential protective role against burden and 
psychological morbidity. However, they also supported reverse causality 
regarding part of the associations. Caregivers' SOC levels may be directly 
influenced by subjective burden and psychological morbidity.

Endosomes are crucial sites for intracellular material sorting and 
transportation. Endosomal transport is a critical process involved in the 
selective uptake, processing, and intracellular transport of substances. The 
equilibrium between endocytosis and circulation mediated by the 
endosome-centered transport pathway plays a significant role in cell 
homeostasis, signal transduction, and immune response. In recent years, there 
have been hints linking endosomal transport abnormalities to neurodegenerative 
diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Nonetheless, the related mechanisms 
remain unclear. Here, we provide an overview of endosomal-centered transport 
pathways and highlight potential physiological processes regulated by these 
pathways, with a particular focus on the correlation of endosomal trafficking 
disorders with common pathological features of neurodegenerative diseases. 
Additionally, we summarize potential therapeutic agents targeting endosomal 
trafficking for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

BACKGROUND: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of synaptic dysfunction, 
neuroinflammation, and glial response, complementing Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
core biomarkers, have improved the pathophysiological characterization of the 
disease. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the co-expression of multiple CSF 
biomarkers will help the identification of AD-like phenotypes when biomarker 
positivity thresholds are not met yet.
METHODS: Two hundred and seventy cognitively unimpaired adults with family 
history (FH) of sporadic AD (mean age = 60.6 ± 4.85 years, 64.8% women) 
underwent lumbar puncture, magnetic resonance imaging (n = 266) and positron 
emission tomography imaging (n = 239) protocols, and clinical evaluations. CSF 
Aβ42, Aβ40, p-tau181, p-tau217, p-tau231, NfL, neurogranin, sTREM2, YKL40, GFAP, 
S100, α-Synuclein, SYT1, and SNAP25 were measured. Participants were clustered 
based on CSF biomarker co-expression with an agglomerative algorithm. The 
predictive value of the classification against brain and cognitive outcomes was 
evaluated.
RESULTS: Three clusters (C) were identified. Higher Aβ burden and CSF p-tau was 
the hallmark of C1. The other two clusters showed lower Aβ burden but higher 
expression of glial (C2) or synaptic markers (C3). Participants in C1 showed an 
AD-like clinical phenotype, comprising participants with the overall highest 
percentage of two parent FH and APOE-ε4 carriers, in addition to comprising more 
females compared to C2. C3 displayed better vascular health compared to C1. C2 
were older and comprised a lower percentage of females compared to C3. C1 showed 
an AD-like gray matter reduction in medial temporal (notably hippocampus) and 
frontal regions that were not observed in Aβ42/40 + compared with Aβ42/40 - . 
Furthermore, Aβ42/40 - participants in C1 showed GM reduction in inferior 
temporal areas compared with Aβ42/40 + participants overall. C1 membership also 
predicted cognitive decline in executive function, but not memory, beyond 
Aβ + status, overall suggesting a better prognosis in Aβ42/40 + participants 
without C1 membership. Additionally, C1 displayed a higher rate of conversion to 
Aβ + (25%) over time.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that examining multiple CSF biomarkers 
reflecting diverse pathological pathways may complement and/or outperform AD 
core biomarkers and thresholding approaches to identify individuals showing a 
clinical and cognitive AD-like phenotype, including higher conversion to Aβ + , 
GM reductions and cognitive decline. The clinical utility of this approach 
warrants further investigation and replication in other cohorts.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between anti-diabetic agents and the 
risks of dementia in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).
METHODS: Literature retrieval was conducted in PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane 
Central Register of Controlled Trials and Clinicaltrial.gov between January 1995 
and October 2024. Observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) 
in patients with T2D, which intercompared anti-diabetic agents or compared them 
with placebo, and reported the incidence of dementia were included. Conventional 
and network meta-analyses of these studies were implemented. Results were 
exhibited as the odds ratio (OR) or risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval 
(CI).
RESULTS: A total of 41 observational studies (3,307,483 participants) and 23 
RCTs (155,443 participants) were included. In the network meta-analysis of 
observational studies, compared with non-users, sodium glucose cotransporter-2 
inhibitor (SGLT-2i) (OR = 0.56, 95%CI, 0.45 to 0.69), glucagon-like peptide-1 
receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) (OR = 0.58, 95%CI, 0.46 to 0.73), thiazolidinedione 
(TZD) (OR = 0.68, 95%CI, 0.57 to 0.81) and metformin (OR = 0.89, 95%CI, 0.80 to 
0.99) treatments were all associated with reduced risk of dementia in patients 
with T2D. The surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) evaluation 
conferred a rank order as SGLT-2i > GLP-1RA > TZD > dipeptidyl peptidase-4 
inhibitor (DPP-4i) > metformin > α-glucosidase inhibitor (AGI) > glucokinase 
activator (GKA) > sulfonylureas > glinides > insulin in terms of the cognitive 
benefits. Meanwhile, compared with non-users, SGLT-2i (OR = 0.43, 95%CI, 0.30 to 
0.62), GLP-1RA (OR = 0.54, 95%CI, 0.30 to 0.96) and DPP-4i (OR = 0.73, 95%CI, 
0.57 to 0.93) were associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease while a 
lower risk of vascular dementia was observed in patients receiving SGLT-2i 
(OR = 0.42, 95%CI, 0.22 to 0.80) and TZD (OR = 0.52, 95%CI, 0.36 to 0.75) 
treatment. In the network meta-analysis of RCTs, the risks of dementia were 
comparable among anti-diabetic agents and placebo.
CONCLUSION: Compared with non-users, SGLT-2i, GLP-1RA, TZD and metformin were 
associated with the reduced risk of dementia in patients with T2D. SGLT-2i, and 
GLP-1RA may serve as the optimal choice to improve the cognitive prognosis in 
patients with T2D.

Essential for brain formation and protective against tauopathy, 
activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP) is critical for neurogenesis 
and cognitive functions, while regulating steroid hormone biogenesis. As such, 
de novo mutations in ADNP lead to syndromic autism and somatic ADNP mutations 
parallel Alzheimer's disease progression. Furthermore, clinical trials with the 
ADNP fragment NAP (the investigational drug davunetide) showed efficacy in women 
suffering from the tauopathy progressive supranuclear palsy and differentially 
boosted memory in men (spatial) and women (verbal), exhibiting prodromal 
Alzheimer's disease. While autism is more prevalent in boys and Alzheimer's 
disease in women, both involve impaired neurogenesis. Here, we asked whether 
ADNP sex-dependently regulates neurogenesis. Using bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) as a 
marker of neurogenesis, we identified two-fold higher labeling in the 
hippocampal sub-ventricular zone of ADNP-intact male versus female mice. Adnp 
haplo-insufficient (Adnp+/-) mice or mice CRSIPR/Cas9-edited to present the most 
prevalent neurodevelopmental ADNP syndrome mutation, p.Tyr718* (Tyr) showed 
dramatic reductions in male BrdU incorporation, resulting in mutated females 
presenting higher labeling than males. Treatment with NAP compensated for the 
male reduction of BrdU labeling. Mechanistically, hippocampal RNAseq revealed 
male-specific Tyr down-regulation of endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein 
response genes critical for sex-dependent organogenesis. Newly discovered 
mitochondrial accessibility of ADNP was inhibited by the Tyr718* mutation 
further revealing female-specific Tyr downregulation of mitochondrial ATP6. NAP 
moderated much of the differential expression caused by p.Tyr718*, accompanied 
by the down-regulation of neurotoxic, pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic genes. 
Thus, ADNP is a key regulator of sex-dependent neurogenesis that acts by 
controlling canonical pathways, with NAP compensating for fundamental ADNP 
deficiencies, striding toward clinical development targeting the ADNP syndrome 
and related neurodevelopmental/neurodegenerative diseases.

Xanomeline/trospium chloride (COBENFY™), formerly KarXT, is a first-in-class, 
oral, fixed-dose muscarinic agonist/antagonist combination being developed for 
use in schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease psychosis. Xanomeline is thought to 
confer efficacy by acting as an agonist at M1 and M4 muscarinic acetylcholine 
receptors in the brain, and trospium chloride reduces the peripheral cholinergic 
adverse events associated with xanomeline. Xanomeline/trospium chloride received 
its first approval on 26 September 2024 in the USA for the treatment of 
schizophrenia in adults. This article summarizes the milestones in the 
development of xanomeline/trospium chloride leading to this first approval for 
schizophrenia.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To compare the diagnostic performance of an 
immunoassay for plasma concentrations of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) 217 with 
visual assessments of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose [18F]FDG-PET in individuals 
who meet appropriate use criteria for Alzheimer dementia (AD) biomarker 
assessments.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of individuals with early-onset 
(age <65 years at onset) and/or atypical dementia (features other than memory at 
onset), who were evaluated at a tertiary care memory clinic. All participants 
underwent measurements of CSF biomarkers (Aβ42, p-tau181, and total tau levels), 
as well as [18F]FDG-PET scans, amyloid-PET scans, and plasma p-tau217 
quantifications. To determine whether the [18F]FDG-PET images were compatible 
with AD, images were visually rated by 2 nuclear medicine experts. Using a 
contingency analysis, we evaluated the accuracy of [18F]FDG-PET scan 
interpretation and plasma p-tau217 for an AD biomarker profile in CSF and for 
amyloid-PET positivity.
RESULTS: A total of 81 individuals with early onset and/or atypical dementia 
were included in this study (mean age = 65 years; 48/81 female (59%). Both 
[18F]FDG-PET and plasma p-tau217 showed high levels of agreement with reference 
standard AD biomarkers ([18F]FDG-PET area under the curve [AUC]: 71%; plasma 
p-tau217 AUC: 81%). Although both biomarkers had similar specificity for AD 
[18F]FDG-PET: 70%, CI: 0.56-0.81; plasma p-tau217: 70%, CI: 0.56-0.81), plasma 
p-tau217 had higher sensitivity for AD (plasma p-tau217: 97%, CI: 0.85-0.99 vs 
[18F]FDG-PET: 73%, CI: 0.57-0.85) (p = 0.01). Overall accuracy was also higher 
for plasma p-tau217 (AUC = 84%, CI: 0.75-0.93 vs 72%, CI: 0.60-0.83 of 
[18F]FDG-PET) (p = 0.02). The same pattern of results was observed when using 
amyloid-PET as the reference standard.
DISCUSSION: Our study provides evidence that plasma p-tau217 has strong 
discriminative accuracy for AD among patients with early-onset and/or atypical 
dementia assessed in specialized settings. Future work should replicate these 
findings in secondary care settings.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent degenerative brain disease 
associated with dementia, requires early diagnosis to alleviate worsening of 
symptoms through appropriate management and treatment. Recent studies on AD 
stage classification are increasingly using multimodal data. However, few 
studies have applied graph neural networks to multimodal data comprising F-18 
florbetaben (FBB) amyloid brain positron emission tomography (PET) images and 
clinical indicators. The objective of this study was to demonstrate the 
effectiveness of graph convolutional network (GCN) for AD stage classification 
using multimodal data, specifically FBB PET images and clinical indicators, 
collected from Dong-A University Hospital (DAUH) and Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The effectiveness of GCN was demonstrated 
through comparisons with the support vector machine, random forest, and 
multilayer perceptron across four classification tasks (normal control (NC) vs. 
AD, NC vs. mild cognitive impairment (MCI), MCI vs. AD, and NC vs. MCI vs. AD). 
As input, all models received the same combined feature vectors, created by 
concatenating the PET imaging feature vectors extracted by the 3D dense 
convolutional network and non-imaging feature vectors consisting of clinical 
indicators using multimodal feature fusion method. An adjacency matrix for the 
population graph was constructed using cosine similarity or the Euclidean 
distance between subjects' PET imaging feature vectors and/or non-imaging 
feature vectors. The usage ratio of these different modal data and edge 
assignment threshold were tuned by setting them as hyperparameters. In this 
study, GCN-CS-com and GCN-ED-com were the GCN models that received the adjacency 
matrix constructed using cosine similarity (CS) and the Euclidean distance (ED) 
between the subjects' PET imaging feature vectors and non-imaging feature 
vectors, respectively. In modified nested cross validation, GCN-CS-com and 
GCN-ED-com respectively achieved average test accuracies of 98.40%, 94.58%, 
94.01%, 82.63% and 99.68%, 93.82%, 93.88%, 90.43% for the four aforementioned 
classification tasks using DAUH dataset, outperforming the other models. 
Furthermore, GCN-CS-com and GCN-ED-com respectively achieved average test 
accuracies of 76.16% and 90.11% for NC vs. MCI vs. AD classification using ADNI 
dataset, outperforming the other models. These results demonstrate that GCN 
could be an effective model for AD stage classification using multimodal data.

Previous studies have shown that the compound 
(E)-2-(3,4-dihydroxystyryl)-3-hydroxy-4H-pyran-4-one (D30), a pyromeconic acid 
derivative, possesses antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, inhibits 
amyloid-β aggregation, and alleviates scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment, 
similar to the phase III clinical drug resveratrol. In this study, we 
established a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease via intracerebroventricular 
injection of fibrillar amyloid-β to investigate the effect of D30 on fibrillar 
amyloid-β-induced neuropathology. Our results showed that D30 alleviated 
fibrillar amyloid-β-induced cognitive impairment, promoted fibrillar amyloid-β 
clearance from the hippocampus and cortex, suppressed oxidative stress, and 
inhibited activation of microglia and astrocytes. D30 also reversed the 
fibrillar amyloid-β-induced loss of dendritic spines and synaptic protein 
expression. Notably, we demonstrated that exogenous fibrillar amyloid-β 
introduced by intracerebroventricular injection greatly increased galectin-3 
expression levels in the brain, and this increase was blocked by D30. 
Considering the role of D30 in clearing amyloid-β, inhibiting neuroinflammation, 
protecting synapses, and improving cognition, this study highlights the 
potential of galectin-3 as a promising treatment target for patients with 
Alzheimer's disease.

The development of multifunctional therapeutic agents is crucial for addressing 
complex diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Herein, we report a 
ruthenium-rhenium (Ru-Re) complex that combines photodynamic therapy (PDT) and 
carbon monoxide (CO) generation capabilities. The Ru-Re complex shows promising 
photophysical property and significant therapeutic potential. Our studies reveal 
the complex's ability to generate singlet oxygen (1O2), CO, inhibit tau 
aggregation, and enhance mitochondrial respiration. These multifunctional 
properties position the Ru-Re complex as a versatile tool for therapeutic 
applications in Alzheimer's disease.

Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is emerging as a promising therapeutic agent for 
neuropathic and other pain-related conditions. This naturally occurring fatty 
acid has drawn interest because of its ability to regulate pain and 
inflammation. Initially identified in food sources, PEA has been the subject of 
extensive research to elucidate its properties, efficacy, and clinical 
applications. PEA primarily exerts its effects through interaction with its 
primary receptor PPAR α, this interaction influences pain signalling pathways 
and neuroinflammatory processes by modulating the synthesis of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines, mast cell degranulation, microglial activation, and decrease of 
oxidative stress. PEA's interaction with endocannabinoid receptors decreases the 
inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production and thereby a descending pain 
sensation. The pharmacological and pharmacokinetic characteristics of PEA are 
examined in this paper, along with its potential for efficiency when used in in 
combination additional therapies in a variety of neurodegenerative disease 
models, including multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's. 
Experimental evidence shows that PEA not only reduces pain and inflammation but 
also lowers the need for higher dosages of other drugs hence minimizing the risk 
of drug toxicity. The bioavailability of PEA has been enhanced by recent 
technological developments, which emphasize continuous research efforts to 
maximize PEA's therapeutic potential in pain treatment and associated medical 
sectors.

Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a common histologic lung cancer with high 
morbidity and mortality, and most patients have distant metastases at diagnosis. 
RasGEF Domain Family Member 1C (RASGEF1C) could regulated Alzheimer's disease. 
However, its function in various cancers, including LUAD, is poorly understood. 
In the present study, we discovered that high expression of RASGEF1C in LUAD was 
associated with poorer prognosis, unfavorable histological features, and poorer 
pathological staging. In addition, RASGEF1C expression was an independent 
predictor of overall survival, disease specific survival, and progress free 
interval in patients with LUAD. High expression of RASGEF1C was linked to 
signaling pathways that are involved in the immune response and cell 
proliferation, according to KEGG enrichment analysis. Additionally, we verified 
that RASGEF1C was highly expressed in LUAD cell lines and that RASGEF1C 
knockdown dramatically decreased the capacity of LUAD cell lines to invade, 
migrate, and proliferate. Our research provides mechanistic insights into the 
function of RASGEF1C in the progression of LUAD and suggests that RASGEF1C is a 
prospective target for future therapy.

Microglial phagocytosis is a highly energy-consuming process that plays critical 
roles in clearing neurotoxic amyloid-β (Aβ) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
However, microglial metabolism is defective overall in AD, thereby undermining 
microglial phagocytic functions. Herein, we repurpose the existing 
antineoplastic drug lonidamine (LND) conjugated with hollow mesoporous Prussian 
blue (HMPB) as a "microglial energy modulator" (termed LND@HMPB-T7) for safe and 
synergistic Aβ clearance. The modified blood-brain barrier penetrating 
heptapeptide (T7) enables efficient transport of LND@HMPB-T7 to the AD brain. 
LND in LND@HMPB-T7 could fuel Aβ phagocytosis by stimulating microglial 
adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, whereas HMPB with catalase and 
superoxide dismutase-mimicking activities substantially alleviates the 
mitochondrial side effects commonly associated with LND and thus further 
enhances ATP production. The synergism of LND and nanozyme affords a high 
microglial Aβ clearance efficacy without triggering mitochondrial dysfunction. 
In vivo experiments ascertain that LND@HMPB-T7 could synergistically promote 
phagocytic clearance of Aβ, relieve neuroinflammation and ameliorate cognitive 
function in AD mice. These findings indicate that LND@HMPB-T7 holds tremendous 
clinical potential as a repurposed drug for AD treatment.

Alzheimer's disease (ALZ) is a neurodegenerative disease that damages neuronal 
cells and causes decline in cognitive abilities. Administration of 
cholinesterase inhibitor compounds is the primary choice in the treatment of 
ALZ, one of which is rivastigmine (RVT). Several routes of administration of RVT 
are available, such as oral and transdermal. However, in the oral route, RVT has 
low bioavailability, undergoes first-pass metabolism, and the presence of the 
blood-brain barrier (BBB) reduces the therapeutic concentration of RVT. The 
transdermal route is nonselective target in the brain. This study aims to 
combine thermosensitive mucoadhesive gel (TG) and lipid microspheres (LM) as a 
drug delivery system to improve the efficacy of RVT. Combining these will 
prevent systemic side effects of RVT and increase drug concentration in the 
brain. LM was formulated with varying concentrations of Compritol polymer. The 
results of LM evaluation showed the values of particle size, PDI, and %EE and 
%DL were 8.519 μm, 0.018 ± 0.004, 72.54%, and 76.43%, respectively. The TG 
formulation can provide a liquid form at room temperature (25 °C) and a gel at 
nasal temperature (35 °C). Hemolytic and HET-CAM tests confirmed TG RVT LM's 
safety for use. Ex vivo studies showed controlled and sustained release of TG 
RVT LM, and in vivo studies showed TG RVT LM a higher pharmacokinetic profile in 
the brain than oral formulations and injections. The Cmax was found to be 7.05 ± 
0.55 μg/cm3, Tmax was 24 h, and AUC0-24, which is related to the effectiveness 
of brain targeting, was 225.73 μg/cm3. In conclusion, this study shows the 
successful development of TG RVT LM, as evidenced by improved drug delivery to 
the brain, which is characterized by higher concentrations of RVT in the brain 
compared with oral and injectable RVT, this delivery system shows potential as a 
future treatment for Alzheimer's disease.

US clinical practice guidelines for the diagnostic evaluation of cognitive 
impairment due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) or a related dementia (ADRD) are two 
decades old. This evidence-based guideline was developed to empower all 
clinicians to implement a structured approach for evaluating a patient with 
symptoms that may represent clinical AD/ADRD. An expert workgroup conducted a 
review of 7374 publications (133 met inclusion criteria) and developed 
recommendations as steps in an evaluation process. This summary briefly reviews 
core recommendations and details specialist recommendations of a high-quality, 
evidence-supported evaluation process aimed at characterizing, diagnosing, and 
disclosing the patient's cognitive functional status, cognitive-behavioral 
syndrome, and likely underlying brain disease so that optimal care plans to 
maximize patient/care partner dyad quality of life can be developed; a companion 
article summarizes primary care recommendations. If clinicians use the 
recommendations in this guideline and health-care systems provide adequate 
resources, outcomes should improve in most patients in most practice settings.

US clinical practice guidelines for the diagnostic evaluation of cognitive

US clinical practice guidelines for the diagnostic evaluation of cognitive 
impairment due to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) or AD and related dementias (ADRD) 
are decades old and aimed at specialists. This evidence-based guideline was 
developed to empower all-including primary care-clinicians to implement a 
structured approach for evaluating a patient with symptoms that may represent 
clinical AD/ADRD. As part of the modified Delphi approach and guideline 
development process (7374 publications were reviewed; 133 met inclusion 
criteria) an expert workgroup developed recommendations as steps in a 
patient-centered evaluation process. The workgroup provided a summary of 
validated instruments to measure symptoms in daily life (including cognition, 
mood and behavior, and daily function) and to test for signs of cognitive 
impairment in the office. This article distills this information to provide a 
resource to support clinicians in the implementation of this approach in 
clinical practice. The companion articles provide context for primary care and 
specialty clinicians with regard to how to fit these instruments into the 
workflow and actions to take when integration of performance on these 
instruments with clinical profile and clinician judgment support potential 
cognitive impairment.

INTRODUCTION: Psychotropic medication (PM) use in behavioral-variant 
frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) is higher than in other dementias. However, no 
information exists on whether PM use differs between sporadic and genetic bvFTD.
METHODS: We analyzed data from sporadic and genetic bvFTD participants with PM 
prescriptions in the Advancing Research and Treatment in Frontotemporal Lobar 
Degeneration/Longitudinal Evaluation of Familial Frontotemporal Dementia 
Subjects study. We estimated ordinal odds ratio (OOR) of having more PM 
comparing sporadic and genetic bvFTD. Finally, we explored the neuropsychiatric 
symptom (NPS) combinations using classification and regression trees (CART).
RESULTS: We included 263 with sporadic and 193 with genetic bvFTD. The OOR for 
sporadic bvFTD to be on PM was 1.75 (95% confidence interval: 1.21 to 2.53) for 
the fully adjusted model. CART revealed the most common NPS combination was 
apathy + personality changes in 18% of participants.
DISCUSSION: Participants with sporadic bvFTD were twice as likely to be on PM 
compared to genetic bvFTD. The reason for increased PM usage in sporadic bvFTD 
participants should be further investigated.
HIGHLIGHTS: We report on patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal 
dementia (bvFTD). We evaluated the psychotropic medication (PM) prescription at 
baseline in the cohort. Patients with sporadic bvFTD had more prescriptions for 
PM than genetic patients. The frequency of symptoms combination was different in 
sporadic and genetic bvFTD.

INTRODUCTION: Increasing evidence has highlighted rare variants in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). However, insufficient sample sizes, especially in underrepresented 
ethnic groups, hinder their investigation. Additionally, their impact on 
endophenotypes remains largely unexplored.
METHODS: We prioritized rare likely-deleterious variants based on whole-genome 
sequencing data from a Chinese AD cohort (n = 988). Gene-based optimal sequence 
kernel association tests were conducted between AD cases and normal controls to 
identify AD-related genes. Network clustering, endophenotype association, and 
cellular experiments were conducted to evaluate their functional consequences.
RESULTS: We identified 11 novel AD candidate genes, which captured AD-related 
pathways and enhanced AD risk prediction performance. Key genes (RABEP1, VIPR1, 
RPL3L, and CABIN1) were linked to cognitive decline and brain atrophy. 
Experiments showed RABEP1 p.R845W inducing endocytosis dysregulation and 
exacerbating toxic amyloid β accumulation, underscoring its therapeutic 
potential.
DISCUSSION: Our findings highlighted the contributions of rare variants to AD 
and provided novel insights into AD therapeutics.
HIGHLIGHTS: Identified 11 novel AD candidate genes in a Chinese AD cohort. 
Correlated candidate genes with AD-related cognitive and brain imaging traits. 
Indicated RABEP1 p.R845W as a critical AD contributor in the endocytic pathway.

INTRODUCTION: Early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) manifests prior to the age 
of 65, and affects 4%-8% of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The current 
analyses sought to examine longitudinal cognitive trajectories of participants 
with early-onset dementia.
METHODS: Data from 307 cognitively normal (CN) volunteer participants and those 
with amyloid-positive EOAD or amyloid-negative cognitive impairment (EOnonAD) 
were compared. Cognitive trajectories across a comprehensive cognitive battery 
spanning 42 months were examined using mixed-effects modeling.
RESULTS: The EOAD group displayed worse cognition at baseline relative to 
EOnonAD and CN groups, and more aggressive declines in cognition over time. The 
largest effects were observed on measures of executive functioning domains, 
while memory declines were blunted in EOAD.
DISCUSSION: EOAD declined 2-4× faster than EOnonAD, and EOAD pathology is not 
restricted to memory networks. Early identification of deficits is critical to 
ensure that individuals with sporadic EOAD can be considered for treatment using 
disease-modifying medications.
HIGHLIGHTS: Represents the most comprehensive longitudinal characterization of 
sporadic EOAD to date. The trajectory of cognitive declines was steep for EOAD 
participants and worse than for other groups. Executive functioning measures 
exhibited the greatest declines over time in EOAD.

Mitochondrial dysfunction plays an important role in neuroinflammation and 
cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Herein, this work designs a 
mitochondria-targeted micelle CsA-TK-SS-31 (CTS) to block the progression of AD 
by simultaneously alleviating mitochondrial dysfunction in microglia and 
neurons. The mitochondria-targeted peptide SS-31 drives cyclosporin A (CsA) to 
penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and delivers CsA to mitochondria of 
microglia and neurons in the brains of 5 × FAD mice. Under the high level of 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) environment in damaged mitochondria of microglia 
and neurons, the linker (thioketal, TK) between CsA and SS-31 is broken and CsA 
and SS-31 are released while consuming ROS in the microenvironment. The released 
CsA and SS-31 synergistically restore the mitochondrial membrane potential and 
the balance between the fission and fusion of mitochondria, which subsequently 
protect neurons from apoptosis and reduce the activation of microglia in the 
brains of 5 × FAD mice. Ultimately, the neuroinflammation and cognitive 
impairment of 5 × FAD mice are ameliorated. This research provides a synergistic 
treatment strategy for AD through alleviating mitochondrial dysfunction to 
reduce neuroinflammation and restore the function of neurons simultaneously.

Somatostatin receptor-4 (SST4) is a therapeutic target for several conditions, 
including Alzheimer's disease, seizures, neuropsychiatric disorders, and pain. 
Our previous work on 1,2,4-triazole derivatives led to enhanced SST4 binding 
affinity, selectivity, and functional activity. Herein we report the discovery 
of 3-thio-1,2,4-triazole series as selective and high affinity SST4 agonists. 
Thirty-three compounds show <100 nM binding affinity, five of which had 
sub-nanomolar binding affinity and >300-fold selectivity over other SST 
subtypes. SST4 cAMP inhibition assay activity data aligned with the ligand 
binding affinity. Comparative docking results of the ligands under investigation 
with the cryo-EM and most recent model-built SST4 structures suggest similar 
trends in binding. Amino acids responsible for high and moderate affinity were 
identified, whereas poorer ligand conformations and limited interactions were 
observed with the low-affinity compounds. In summary, this study presents a 
novel series of high affinity SST4 agonists with corresponding in vitro 
activity, demonstrating viable therapeutic potential.
