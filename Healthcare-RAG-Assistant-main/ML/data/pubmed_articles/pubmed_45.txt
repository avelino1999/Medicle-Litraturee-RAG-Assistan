Kallikrein-related peptidases are a family of serine proteases whose loss of 
activity regulation has been particularly linked to neurodegenerative diseases. 
Moreover, iron overload is also a key process in some of these leading 
pathological conditions, particularly Alzheimer's disease. It is identified for 
the first time Deferasirox, a well-known FDA-approved iron chelator (DFX) as an 
initial hit for kallikrein's (KLK) inhibition and proposed here the design and 
synthesis of a small library of molecules using DFX as chemical scaffold. 
Resulting subseries of compounds are evaluated against lead central nervous 
system KLK's, namely, KLK1, KLK6, and KLK8 using targeted pharmacomodulations on 
DFX. Beyond DFX, several reversible micromolar inhibitors of these KLKs have 
been identified as hits and are shown to be devoid of any noticeable 
cytotoxicity toward neural cell lines commonly used in the field of 
neurodegenerative diseases. Their ability to chelate iron is also assessed in 
comparison to DFX and preformed iron-compound complexes displayed slightly 
improved inhibition potency for some derivatives with a KLK-dependent manner. 
Hence, several DFX derivatives are identified as promising starting points for 
the development of dual therapeutic agents in the context of neurodegenerative 
diseases where both deregulated KLK's proteolysis and iron dysregulation are 
involved.

BACKGROUND: The approval of amyloid-targeting monoclonal antibodies has 
transformed Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment, shifting the field from 
symptomatic management to targeting the underlying pathology. These therapies 
require specialized care models to manage the selection, treatment, and 
monitoring of eligible patients.
METHODS: Here, we describe the implementation of the Anti-Amyloid Treatment 
Clinic (KU-AATC) at the University of Kansas Health System, a dedicated clinic 
model designed to streamline access to amyloid-clearing therapies and to provide 
safe, efficient patient care. We detail the KU-AATC's structured approach, 
including a multidisciplinary team with advanced practice providers (APPs), 
leading patient evaluation and shared decision-making, and tailored workflows to 
ensure timely access to treatment. We review data from the clinic's first 
18 months.
RESULTS: The KU-AATC model demonstrates a feasible approach to managing the 
complex needs of amyloid-targeting therapy for AD.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that a specialized clinic structure can 
support safe, accessible, and efficient care for AD patients, potentially 
serving as a scalable model for healthcare systems adapting to the demands of 
emerging AD treatments. Expanding similar clinics may address neurologist 
shortages and improve equitable access to advanced therapies.

INTRODUCTION: In this study, we report on the synthesis and characterization of 
new silicon (IV) phthalocyanine compounds (SiPcs) axially substituted with 
coumarin-linked derivatives, designed for potential application in photodynamic 
therapy (PDT) due to their photophysical properties.
METHOD: Characterization was carried out using FT-IR, UV-Vis, MALDI-TOF-MS, and 
1H NMR spectroscopy. In dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), the SiPcs produced singlet 
oxygen with quantum yields of 0.17 to 0.19, assessed by the DPBF quenching 
method. DNA binding studies via UV-Vis spectroscopy and molecular docking 
suggested high binding affinities (ΔG0 values between -9.90 to -10.4 kcal/mol) 
and stable interactions with calf thymus DNA (ct-DNA).
RESULTS: Furthermore, the compounds showed promising inhibitory activity against 
acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), with IC50 values 
indicating higher potency and selectivity compared to galantamine, a known 
cholinesterase inhibitor.
CONCLUSION: The combined singlet oxygen generation, DNA binding, and enzyme 
inhibition data underscore the potential of these SiPc-coumarin derivatives as 
multifunctional agents for PDT and neuroprotective applications such as 
Alzheimer's disease (AD).

BACKGROUND: Recent research highlights the immune system's role in AD 
pathogenesis and promising prospects of natural compounds in treatment. This 
study explores immunity-related biomarkers and potential natural products using 
bioinformatics, machine learning, molecular docking, and kinetic simulation.
METHODS: Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in AD were analyzed using GSE5281 
and GSE132903 datasets. Important AD module genes were identified using a 
weighted co-expression algorithm (WGCNA), and immune-related genes (IRGs) were 
obtained from the ImmPortPortal database. Intersecting these genes yielded 
important IRGs. Then, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator 
(LASSO) and other methods screened common immune-related AD markers. Biological 
pathways were explored through Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes 
and Genomes (KEGG), and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). The accuracy of 
these markers was assessed by subject operator signature (ROC) curves and 
validated in the GSE122063 dataset. The datasets was then subjected to 
immunoinfiltration analysis. Multiple compound databases were used to analyze 
core Chinese medicines and components. Molecular docking and kinetic simulation 
verification were used for further verification.
RESULTS: A total of 1360 differential genes and 5 biomarkers (PGF, GFAP, GPI, 
SST, NFKBIA) were identified, showing excellent diagnostic efficiency. GSEA 
revealed markers associated with Oxidative phosphorylation, Nicotine addiction, 
and Hippo signaling pathway. Immune infiltration analysis showed dysregulation 
in multiple immune cell types in AD brains, with significant interactions 
between markers and 5 immune cell types. A total of 27 possible herbs and 7 core 
compounds were eventually identified. The binding environment of GPI-luteolin 
and GPI-stigasterol was relatively stable and showed good affinity.
CONCLUSIONS: PGF, GFAP, SST, GPI, and NFKBIA were identified for early AD 
diagnosis, associated with immune cells and pathways in AD brains. 7 promising 
natural compounds, including luteolin and stigmasterol, were screened for 
targeting these biomarkers.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multifaceted neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia 
nigra and the aggregation of α-synuclein. According to epidemiological data, PD 
is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) and has emerged as a significant global health concern. This review 
examines the intricate pathological mechanisms and high-risk factors associated 
with PD, and discusses the challenges in its clinical diagnosis and treatment. 
We elucidate the relationship between smoking and the reduced risk of PD, 
highlighting the potential neuroprotective effects of nicotine present in 
tobacco. The interaction between nicotine and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors 
(nAChRs) is analyzed in detail, emphasizing their neuroprotective capabilities 
and underlying molecular mechanisms. Furthermore, we analyze the structural and 
functional diversity of nAChRs and their roles in the pathological progression 
of PD. Our review aims to elucidate the complex interplay of genetic, 
environmental, and biochemical factors in PD and to propose future research 
directions that may facilitate therapeutic development.

Amyloid plaque buildup, tau protein tangles, oxidative stress, and neuronal 
death are the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Using network pharmacology, 
molecular docking, and in vivo experiments, this study investigated the 
neuroprotective potential of Bergenia ligulata (BL) and Nelumbo nucifera (NN) 
against aluminum chloride (AlCl₃)-induced AD. Network pharmacology focused on 
important biomarker proteins like acetylcholinesterase (AChE), BCL2, and 
caspase-3 to identify 74 bioactive targets linked to AD. The evaluation of 
ligand-protein interactions was done using molecular docking. Male Wistar rats 
were exposed to AlCl₃ to cause AD-like pathology in vivo, and a combination 
treatment of BL and NN at varying doses was provided. Apoptosis markers (BCL2, 
caspase-3), biochemical investigations (AChE activity, oxidative stress 
markers-GSH, SOD, catalase, and lipid peroxidation), behavioral evaluations 
(elevated plus maze, conditioned avoidance test), and histopathological analyses 
were investigated. The combination of BL and NN demonstrated substantial 
neuroprotection in a dose-dependent manner. Reduced AChE levels point out 
improved cholinergic activity. Oxidative stress indicators showed improvement, 
with lower levels of malondialdehyde and higher anti-oxidant levels of GSH, SOD, 
and catalase. Apoptotic markers showed an increase in BCL2 expression and a 
decrease in caspase-3, suggesting anti-apoptotic effects. Reduced neuronal 
degeneration in the cortex and hippocampal regions was confirmed by 
histopathology of the brain. The synergistic potential of BL and NN demonstrated 
potent neuroprotective effects by modulating AChE activity, reducing oxidative 
stress, increasing anti-oxidant levels, and inhibiting apoptosis. These findings 
highlighted the potential of BL and NN as a new therapeutic approach for the AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with devastating 
personal and social consequences. In June 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval to aducanumab (Aduhelm; 
Biogen), a first-in-class monoclonal antibody (mAb) for treatment of AD. In July 
2021, responding to the significant controversy sparked by aducanumab's 
approval, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) opened a National 
Coverage Determination (NCD) analysis for mAbs intended for the treatment of AD. 
CMS received a record number of public comments on the proposed NCD, which 
included a proposal for coverage with evidence development (CED). We undertook 
an in-depth qualitative analysis of those comments. Broad themes included: the 
appropriateness of FDA's approval of aducanumab; the nature of the relationship 
between CMS and FDA; anticipated downstream effects of CED on innovation and 
health equity; aducanumab's cost, value, and affordability; and whether 
aducanumab offered patients hope. The aducanumab controversy occurred at the 
intersection of multiple contentious issues; in the discussion, we contextualize 
our findings within these broader debates. Though Biogen pulled aducanumab from 
the market in early 2024, the effects of the public discourse surrounding its 
approval and coverage have been long-lasting and far-reaching, affecting health 
law, policy, and clinical practice.

Ginsenoside Rd (GSRd) is one of the rare saponin monomers extracted from 
ginseng. Most importantly, GSRd could effectively cross the intact blood-brain 
barrier (BBB). Studies have shown that it plays an important role in the 
treatment of neurological diseases such as ischemic stroke (IS), spinal cord 
injury (SCI), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). The results 
of these studies are of great significance for the clinical application of GSRd 
in the treatment in neurological diseases. This article reviewed the protective 
effects of GSRd in central nervous system diseases and analysed the related 
mechanism.

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) imaging 
markers is high, yet their influence on stroke prognosis remains unclear. This 
study aimed to estimate the effects of CSVD on the efficacy and safety of 
clopidogrel+aspirin versus aspirin among patients with minor stroke or high-risk 
transient ischemic attack.
METHODS: This was a post hoc subgroup analysis of the INSPIRES trial (Intensive 
Statin and Antiplatelet Therapy for Acute High-Risk Intracranial or Extracranial 
Atherosclerosis), which was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2×2 factorial, 
and randomized clinical trial conducted at 222 centers in China from September 
2018 to October 2022. Patients were classified into CSVD score 0 to 2 and CSVD 
score ≥3 groups based on a modified CSVD burden score without microbleeds. The 
primary efficacy and safety outcomes were stroke recurrence and 
moderate-to-severe bleeding risk within 90-day follow-up. We used Cox 
proportional hazards models to test the treatment-by-CSVD group interaction for 
stroke and bleeding risk.
RESULTS: A total of 5126 patients (median age, 65 [57-71] years; 3915 [64.2%] 
males) were enrolled and 2131 (41.57%) had a modified CSVD score ≥3. Patients 
with CSVD score ≥3 had numerically higher stroke recurrence rate (9.10% versus 
8.05%) and lower risk of moderate-to-severe bleeding (0.56% versus 0.80%) than 
those with CSVD score 0 to 2 within 90 days. Clopidogrel+aspirin versus aspirin 
reduced stroke recurrence to a similar relative degree in both CSVD score 0 to 2 
(adjusted hazard ratio, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.61-1.01]; P=0.06) and CSVD score ≥3 
groups (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.62-1.09]; P=0.12) with no 
evidence of statistical interaction (P=0.84). Clopidogrel+aspirin versus aspirin 
increased bleeding risk to a similar relative degree in both CSVD score 0 to 2 
(adjusted hazard ratio, 2.83 [95% CI, 1.52-5.27]; P=0.03) and CSVD score ≥3 
groups (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.13 [95% CI, 1.08-4.19]; P=0.22) with no 
statistical interaction (P=0.68).
CONCLUSIONS: In this post hoc subgroup analysis, no significant interaction 
effect was observed between the antiplatelet treatment and the modified CSVD 
score, suggesting that clopidogrel+aspirin may not provide a significantly 
different benefit-risk profile across patients with CSVD score 0 to 2 versus 
CSVD score ≥3.

BACKGROUND: The Maintain Your Brain (MYB) randomised controlled trial (RCT) 
examined the effect of a multi-domain internet-based dementia prevention program 
against a control group (information only).
OBJECTIVES: A cost-effective analysis (CEA) quantified the differences in costs 
(direct healthcare and program costs) and effectiveness outcomes between the 
intervention and control groups from a healthcare sector perspective.
DESIGN: An economic evaluation was conducted alongside the MYB RCT over three 
years.
SETTING: Australians aged 55-77 years with at least 2 identified remediable risk 
factors for cognitive decline/dementia recruited from communities in New South 
Wales.
PARTICIPANTS: There were 3,025 participants in the intervention group and 3,033 
in the control group with available linked healthcare data via the Sax 
Institute's 45 and Up Study out of the 6104 enrolled in the trial (99.2% of 
total cohort).
INTERVENTION: The MYB trial comprised a personalised schedule of online coaching 
in physical activity, nutrition, cognitive activity, and depression or anxiety 
management.
MEASUREMENTS: The two effectiveness outcomes were global cognition composite 
(GCC) scores and the Australian National University-Alzheimer's Disease Risk 
Index -short form (ANU-ADRI-SF) questionnaire scores. Costs included MYB program 
costs and the direct healthcare costs incurred by the MYB participants. All 
costs were reported in Australian dollars (AUD$) during the trial period. The 
time horizon of this analysis was 3 years after randomisation (2018-2021). 
Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICERs) between the intervention and the 
control groups were calculated by comparing the average difference in costs to a 
mean difference in z score for GCC and ANU-ADRI-SF score using the bootstrapped 
means and 95% Confidence Intervals.
RESULTS: The total unadjusted program and healthcare costs over three years were 
similar between groups (AUD$16,521 per person in the control group and 
AUD$16,473 in the intervention group). After adjusting for baseline 
characteristics, the average difference between groups in total cost per person 
at three years was not statistically different: AUD$467 favouring the control 
group (95%CI: -$552 - $1585). This was compared to a significant mean difference 
(improvement) in GCC z score at three years of 0.18 (95%CI: 0.13, 0.23) and 
-0.57 (95%CI: -0.95, -0.24) point difference in ANU-ADRI-SF for the intervention 
versus control. The base case ICERs were AUD$2,568 per 1 standard deviation in z 
score and $823 per reduction of 1 ANU-ADRI-SF point. With 1000 bootstrapped 
replications, the scatterplots of ICER ellipses suggest that the MYB 
intervention was more effective than the control group and with no significant 
difference in overall healthcare costs.
CONCLUSION: The MYB trial showed cost-effectiveness for preventing cognitive 
decline and reducing dementia risk. Longer-term follow-up and dissemination to 
other cohorts is needed to confirm the impact on preventing future cases of 
dementia and relevance to other socio-economic and cultural/ethnic groups than 
those enrolled in the original trial.

INTRODUCTION: Both the advance care planning (ACP) visit and cognitive 
assessment and care planning service (CAACPS) visit offer palliative-oriented 
care for persons with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD); however, 
the rate of ACP visits remains low, and little has been reported regarding 
CAACPS visits. Furthermore, few reports describe use of either visit among 
Medicare Advantage (MA) beneficiaries. This study describes provision of ACP and 
CAACPS visits to community-dwelling older adult MA beneficiaries with ADRD.
METHODS: Using deidentified Optum Clinformatics Data Mart claims data, we 
evaluated ambulatory care visits for community-dwelling older adult MA 
beneficiaries with ADRD for the years 2018 to 2019.
RESULTS: For 2018 and 2019, 3.5% and 5.4% received ACP visits, and 0.4% and 0.5% 
received CAACPS visits, similar to use reported elsewhere.
DISCUSSION: Few MA beneficiaries with ADRD received ACP or CAACPS visits, and 
the delivery of CAACPs visits is similar to that reported for non-MA 
beneficiaries.
HIGHLIGHTS: Most persons with dementia are community-dwelling and 
disproportionately disadvantaged. Access to palliative care is limited for 
community-dwelling persons with dementia. CAACPS visits may address this gap. 
Our findings show the use of CAACPS visits is very low.

INTRODUCTION: We explored patients' and families' interest in, predictors of, 
and considerations regarding genetic testing for monogenic causes of dementia in 
a diagnostic setting.
METHODS: This mixed-methods study evaluated 519 consecutive Alzheimer Center 
Amsterdam patients for monogenic testing eligibility. Among those qualifying, 
differences between testers and non-testers were analyzed. Thirty-three patients 
completed questionnaires. Additionally, we conducted 21 semi-structured 
interviews with 15 patients and 18 relatives. Verbatim transcripts were analyzed 
inductively.
RESULTS: Of 138 (27%) eligible patients (46% female, age 61 ± 8 years, 
Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] 22 ± 6), 75 (54%) underwent genetic 
testing. Testers had better cognition, higher quality of life, and more often 
undetermined diagnoses than non-testers (all p < 0.05). Decisions were guided by 
intuitive, value-driven judgments: testers sought to provide heredity 
information to relatives, enhance actionability, and reduce uncertainty, while 
non-testers worried about psychosocial impact on family, or unfavorable timing.
DISCUSSION: The substantial interest in genetic testing for monogenic causes of 
dementia underscores the need for further research into the implications of 
disclosing test results to memory clinic patients.
HIGHLIGHTS: Half of memory clinic patients' who met eligibility criteria 
proceeded with genetic testing. Those tested were more likely to have an 
undetermined diagnosis, better cognition, and higher quality of life. Decisions 
were motivated less by deliberation of factual information, and more by quick, 
intuitive judgments. Motivations pro included providing information, enhancing 
actionability, and resolving uncertainty. Motivations con comprised concerns 
about the emotional burden and disruptive impact on their family.

INTRODUCTION: Blood biomarkers reflecting Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
pathophysiology can improve diagnosis and treatment.
METHODS: We applied top-down proteomics to compare frontal lobe from 17 AD cases 
and 11 controls to blood platelets from a second independent study group of 124 
AD patients, 61 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 168 controls. Findings 
were immunologically validated.
RESULTS: Sixty AD-associated proteoforms were identified in frontal lobe, with 
26 identically represented in platelets. Validation in platelet samples 
confirmed elevated glutathione S-transferase omega 1 (GSTO1) levels linked to 
single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs4925 and increased superoxide dismutase 1 
(SOD1) levels in AD. Bioinformatics revealed copper chaperone for superoxide 
dismutase (CCS) and glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1) as integral partners of 
these antioxidant enzymes. Both were detected to be reduced in frontal lobes and 
platelets in AD. SOD1 and CCS are already changed in MCI.
DISCUSSION: These four novel blood biomarkers, integrated with traditional AD 
biomarkers, may facilitate patient risk assessment and treatment, with SOD1 and 
CCS alterations in MCI offering early diagnostic potential.
HIGHLIGHTS: Platelets mirror several Alzheimer's disease (AD)-dependent neuronal 
changes, valuable for blood tests. As a start, 60 AD-associated frontal lobe 
proteins were identified by top-down proteomics. Fifty percent of these 60 
AD-affected brain proteins are represented identically in platelets. Among 
these, glutathione S-transferase omega 1 (GSTO1), superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), 
copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase (CCS), and glutathione peroxidase 1 
(GPX1) are identically AD related in brain and platelets. SOD1 and its crucial 
activating partner CCS are altered in the platelets of patients with mild 
cognitive impairment.

It is known that infections with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2) cause coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is widely reported 
that Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with the highest risk of COVID-19 
infection, hospitalization and mortality. However, it remains largely unclear 
about the link between AD and COVID-19. ACE2 is an entry receptor for 
SARS-CoV-2. We consider that there may be a link between AD and COVID-19 through 
the expression of ACE2. Here, we summarize recent findings about the ACE2 
expression especially in AD and COVID-19, and shows that (1) ACE2 shows mRNA and 
protein expression in human brain tissues, especially in neurons and non-neuron 
cells; (2) low ACE2 mRNA and protein expression are sufficient for SARS-CoV-2 
entry into the human brain through the neural route (olfactory and/or vagal) and 
the hematogenous route; (3) SARS-CoV-2 RNA and protein were detected in brains 
of COVID-19 patients; (4) SARS-CoV-2 infects and replicates in human brain 
dependent on ACE2; (5) SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA load shows a positive association 
with ACE2 mRNA levels and COVID-19 severity; (6) ACE2 shows increased expression 
in AD compared with controls in human brain; (7) ACE2 shows increased expression 
in COVID-19 compared with controls in human brain; (8) ACE2 expression levels 
affect COVID-19 outcomes. Together, ACE2 shows significantly increased mRNA and 
protein expression in AD compared with controls in human brain. Consequently, 
the increased expression of ACE2 would facilitate infection with SARS-CoV-2, and 
play a role in the context of COVID-19. These findings suggest that the 
expression of ACE2 may partly explain the link of AD with COVID-19 infection, 
hospitalization and mortality.

BACKGROUND: Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and sodium-glucose 
cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors represent a new generation of 
antihyperglycemic agents that operate through mechanisms distinct from 
conventional diabetes treatments. Beyond their metabolic effects, these 
medications have demonstrated neuroprotective properties in preclinical studies. 
While clinical trials have explored their therapeutic potential in established 
neurodegenerative conditions, their role in disease prevention remains unclear. 
We conducted a network meta-analysis (NMA) to comprehensively evaluate the 
prophylactic benefits of these agents across multiple neurodegenerative diseases 
and identify the most promising preventive strategies.
METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, ClinicalKey, Cochrane 
CENTRAL, ProQuest, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov through 
October 24th, 2024, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of GLP-1 receptor 
agonists or SGLT2 inhibitors. Our primary outcome was the incidence of seven 
major neurodegenerative diseases: Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Lewy 
body dementia, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal 
dementia, and Huntington's disease. Secondary outcomes included safety profiles 
assessed through dropout rates. We performed a frequentist-based NMA and 
evaluated risk of bias with Risk of Bias tool. The main result of the primary 
outcome in the current study would be re-affirmed via sensitivity test with 
Bayesian-based NMA.
RESULTS: Our analysis encompassed 22 RCTs involving 138,282 participants (mean 
age 64.8 years, 36.4% female). Among all investigated medications, only 
dapagliflozin demonstrated significant prophylactic benefits, specifically in 
preventing Parkinson's disease (odds ratio = 0.28, 95% confidence 
intervals = 0.09 to 0.93) compared to controls. Neither GLP-1 receptor agonists 
nor other SGLT2 inhibitors showed significant preventive effects for any of the 
investigated neurodegenerative conditions. Drop-out rates were comparable across 
all treatments.
CONCLUSIONS: This comprehensive NMA reveals a novel and specific prophylactic 
effect of dapagliflozin against Parkinson's disease, representing a potential 
breakthrough in preventive neurology. The specificity of dapagliflozin's 
protective effect to Parkinson's disease might rely on its highly selective 
inhibition to SGLT2. These findings provide important direction for future 
research and could inform preventive strategies for populations at risk of 
Parkinson's disease.

Neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease are 
age-related disorders which severely impact quality of life and impose 
significant societal burdens. Cellular senescence is a critical factor in these 
disorders, contributing to their onset and progression by promoting permanent 
cell cycle arrest and reducing cellular function, affecting various types of 
cells in brain. Recent advancements in regenerative medicine have highlighted 
"R3" strategies-rejuvenation, regeneration, and replacement-as promising 
therapeutic approaches for neurodegeneration. This review aims to critically 
analyze the role of cellular senescence in neurodegenerative diseases and 
organizes therapeutic approaches within the R3 regenerative medicine paradigm. 
Specifically, we examine stem cell therapy, direct lineage reprogramming, and 
partial reprogramming in the context of R3, emphasizing how these interventions 
mitigate cellular senescence and counteracting aging-related neurodegeneration. 
Ultimately, this review seeks to provide insights into the complex interplay 
between cellular senescence and neurodegeneration while highlighting the promise 
of cell-based regenerative strategies to address these debilitating conditions.

BACKGROUND: Across Asia, Alzheimer's disease prevalence is expected to rise 
dramatically due to, among other factors, rapidly aging populations. Alzheimer's 
disease pathology is triggered by the accumulation of soluble and insoluble 
aggregated Aβ peptides (oligomers, protofibrils, and fibrils). Lecanemab is a 
recently approved humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that preferentially targets 
soluble aggregated Aβ species (oligomers, protofibrils), with activity at 
insoluble fibrils. In the recent 18-month phase 3 Clarity AD study, lecanemab 
demonstrated a consistent slowing of decline in clinical (global, cognitive, 
functional, and quality of life) outcomes, and reduction in brain amyloid in 
early Alzheimer's disease. Lecanemab was well tolerated in Clarity AD, with an 
increase in incidence of infusion related reactions and amyloid-related imaging 
abnormalities (ARIA) versus placebo.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this manuscript is to present the results for the 
Asian region population of Clarity AD.
DESIGN: The core Clarity AD study was an 18-month, multicenter, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, parallel-group study.
SETTING: Academic and clinical centers in Asia PARTICIPANTS: A total of 294 
individuals with early Alzheimer's disease (i.e., mild cognitive impairment or 
mild Alzheimer's disease).
INTERVENTION: Eligible patients were randomized across 2 treatment groups 
(placebo and lecanemab 10 mg/kg biweekly) according to a fixed 1:1 schedule.
MEASUREMENTS: The primary efficacy endpoint in the core study was change in the 
Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum-of-Boxes (CDR-SB) from baseline at 18 months. Key 
secondary endpoints included change from baseline at 18 months in amyloid PET 
Centiloids (in patients participating in the amyloid PET sub-study), AD 
COMposite Score (ADCOMS) and AD Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale 14 
(ADAS-Cog14). Safety was monitored throughout the study in a blinded manner by 
the sponsor and in an unblinded manner by an independent data safety monitoring 
committee.
RESULTS: Of the total of 1795 subjects randomized in Clarity AD, 294 subjects 
were in the Asian region (Japan:152; Korea:129; Singapore:13). The efficacy of 
lecanemab was consistent with the overall population. For the primary endpoint, 
there was a slowing of decline with lecanemab in the CDR-SB at 18 months 
compared to placebo in the Asian region (adjusted mean difference: -0.349; 95 % 
confidence intervals: -0.773, 0.076; 24 % slowing of decline). Results for the 
secondary efficacy endpoints also favored lecanemab versus placebo in Asians. 
Lecanemab was well tolerated in Asian subjects, with a safety profile in Asian 
subjects similar to the overall Clarity AD population. The most common adverse 
events of special interest were ARIA-H (lecanemab:14.4 %; placebo:16.2 %), 
ARIA-E (lecanemab:6.2 %; placebo:1.4 %), and infusion-related reactions 
(lecanemab:12.3 %; placebo:1.4 %). Incidence of adverse events leading to study 
drug dose interruption or withdrawal, infusion-related reactions, ARIA-E and 
ARIA-H was lower for the lecanemab treated group in the Asian region relative to 
the overall Clarity AD population. Results from quality of life and biomarker 
assessments in the Asia region were also generally similar to the overall 
Clarity AD population.
CONCLUSION: In the Clarity AD Asian region cohort, the overall efficacy, 
biomarker changes and safety profile of lecanemab were consistent with the 
overall population, with a favorable risk-benefit profile and manageable risks. 
ARIA events and infusion-related reactions occurred less commonly with lecanemab 
in the Asian region subgroup than the overall population.

eligibility.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: These guidelines were collaboratively established by 
Japan Radiological Society, The Japanese Society of Neuroradiology, and Japanese 
Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine by reviewing existing literature and 
the results of clinical trials.
RESULTS: Facility standards should comply with the "Optimal Use Promotion 
Guidelines" of Japan, and physicians should possess comprehensive knowledge of 
amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) and expertise in brain MRI 
interpretation. The acquisition of knowledge regarding amyloid-related imaging 
abnormalities, brain MRI, anti-Aβ antibody introduction, and post-treatment 
diagnosis are also recommended.
CONCLUSION: These guidelines facilitate the accurate diagnosis and effective 
management of ARIA; ensure the safe administration of anti-Aβ drugs; and provide 
a framework for MRI facilities, includes staffing requirements and the use of 
MRI management systems.

The discovery of novel drugs from the ocean is a relatively recent development. 
However, for most studies of marine drugs, the priority is the discovery of 
compounds with new structures. Normally, only small amounts (< 1 mg) of new 
compounds could be extracted from marine microbes, and it is difficult to 
evaluate the therapeutic potentials of these newly-identified marine-derived 
natural compounds by traditional cell- or animal-based phenotypic screenings. 
Genes play a crucial role in determining the phenotype of diseases and the 
action of drugs. By comparing genomic expression associated with disease 
conditions and compound treatments, it is possible to predict the potential of a 
certain compound to counteract a specific type of disease. In this study, 
marine-derived natural compounds-induced genomic changes in cells were collected 
either from public databases or by using RNA-seq analysis. The therapeutic 
potentials of representative marine-derived natural compounds, namely 
phycocyanobilin, cycloheximide and NBU-1, a newly-identified natural compound 
extracted from a marine sponge-associated Streptomyces, on bipolar disorder 
(BD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), were predicted by 
gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), respectively. The anti-neurological 
disorder activity of these marine-derived natural compounds were further 
validated in methamphetamine-induced rats mimicking manic phase of BD, 
6-OHDA-treated PC12 cells mimicking PD neurotoxicity and β-amyloid 
oligomer-incubated SH-SY5Y cells mimicking AD neuronal loss. Our study provides 
not only new insights for pharmacological applications of the marine-derived 
natural compounds here studied, but also a method for predicting and evaluating 
therapeutic potentials of newly-identified marine-derived natural compounds with 
small quantities.

OBJECTIVES: To explore the hospital-related adverse events endured by people 
with dementia and assess their association with negative outcomes related to 
hospital care.
METHOD: A scoping review was undertaken in October 2023. Primary studies 
published in peer-reviewed journals in English, Spanish, or Portuguese were 
included. The databases PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL, and Scopus were 
searched.
RESULTS: Of the 1976 retrieved studies, 16 were included. Adverse events were 
more frequent among people with dementia compared to people without dementia. In 
studies with non-surgical and surgical patients, the most frequently reported 
were falls, delirium, and infections, while in studies exclusively conducted 
with surgical patients, these were postoperative delirium, infections, and other 
complications. The link between adverse events and negative outcomes was 
explored in only three studies and indicated that those who experienced adverse 
events had longer hospital stays, higher risk of mortality, and higher 
readmission rates within 90 days.
CONCLUSION: Although we were unable to establish a direct link between adverse 
events and hospital outcomes due to the exploratory nature of this review, the 
findings suggest that mitigating such events could help improve outcomes among 
hospitalized people with dementia. Hospital safety measures appear to be 
insufficient to protect this group.

INTRODUCTION: It is anticipated that the prevalence of illnesses affecting the 
central nervous system (CNS) will rise significantly due to longer lifespans and 
changing demography. Age-related decline in brain function and neuronal death 
are features of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, 
Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 
which provide formidable treatment challenges. Because most therapeutic drugs 
cannot across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to reach the brain, there are still 
few treatment alternatives available despite a great deal of research.
AREAS COVERED: This study explores the role of redox chemical delivery systems 
in CNS drug delivery and addresses challenges associated with neurodegenerative 
disease (ND). Redox Chemical Delivery System offers a promising approach to 
enhancing leveraging redox reactions that facilitate the transport of 
therapeutic agents across the BBB. Through the optimization of medication 
delivery pathways to the brain, this technology has the potential to greatly 
improve the treatment of ND.
EXPERT OPINION: As our understanding of the biological underpinnings of ND 
deepens, the potential for effective interventions increases. Refining drug 
delivery strategies, such as RCDS, is essential for advancing CNS therapies from 
research to clinical practice. These advancements could transform the management 
of ND, improving both treatment efficacy and patient outcomes.

Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are a set of neurodevelopmental disorders with 
complex biology. The identification of ASD risk genes from exome-wide 
association studies and de novo variation analyses has enabled mechanistic 
investigations into how ASD-risk genes alter development. Most functional 
genomics studies have focused on the role of these genes in neurons and neural 
progenitor cells. However, roles for ASD risk genes in other cell types are 
largely uncharacterized. There is evidence from postmortem tissue that 
microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, appear activated in ASD. 
Here, we used CRISPRi-based functional genomics to systematically assess the 
impact of ASD risk gene knockdown on microglia activation and phagocytosis. We 
developed an iPSC-derived microglia-neuron coculture system and high-throughput 
flow cytometry readout for synaptic pruning to enable parallel CRISPRi-based 
screening of phagocytosis of beads, synaptosomes, and synaptic pruning. Our 
screen identified ADNP, a high-confidence ASD risk genes, as a modifier of 
microglial synaptic pruning. We found that microglia with ADNP loss have altered 
endocytic trafficking, remodeled proteomes, and increased motility in coculture.

β-protein (Aβ) is one of the key pathological features of AD, which is cytotoxic 
and can damage neurons, thereby causing cognitive dysfunction. 
Photobiomodulation (PBM) is a non-invasive physical therapy that induces changes 
in the intrinsic mechanisms of cells and tissues through low-power light 
exposure. Although PBM has been employed in the treatment of AD, the effect and 
precise mechanism of PBM on AD-induced neurological damage are still unclear.
METHODS: In vivo experiments, PBM (808 nm, 20 mW/cm2) was used to continuously 
interfere with APP/PS1 mice for 6 weeks, and then their cognitive function and 
AD pathological changes were evaluated. In vitro experiments, lipopolysaccharide 
(LPS) was used to induce microglia to model inflammation, and the effect of PBM 
treatment on microglia polarization status and phagocytic Aβ ability was 
evaluated. Hexokinase 2 (HK2) inhibitor 3-bromopyruvate (3BP) was used to study 
the effect of PBM treatment on mitochondrial energy metabolism in microglia.
RESULTS: PBM further ameliorates AD-induced cognitive impairment by alleviating 
neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis, thereby attenuating nerve damage. In 
addition, PBM can also reduce neuroinflammation by promoting microglial 
anti-inflammatory phenotypic polarization; Promotes Aβ clearance by enhancing 
the ability of microglia to engulf Aβ. Among them, PBM regulates microglial 
polarization and inhibits neuronal apoptosis, which may be related to its 
regulation of mitochondrial energy metabolism, promotion of oxidative 
phosphorylation, and inhibition of glycolysis.
CONCLUSION: PBM regulates neuroinflammatory response and inhibits neuronal 
apoptosis, thereby repairing Aβ-induced neuronal damage and cognitive 
dysfunction. Mitochondrial energy metabolism plays an important role in PBM in 
improving nerve injury in AD mice. This study provides theoretical support for 
the subsequent application of PBM in the treatment of AD.

Sinapic acid (SAc) is a plant-based antioxidant known for its neuroprotective 
effects. However, its therapeutic potential for Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains 
limited because of its low bioavailability in the brain. Therefore, the present 
study hypothesized safe and effective delivery of SAc using chitosan-coated 
solid lipid nanoparticles (Cs-SAc-SLNs) via the intranasal route for AD 
treatment. The characterization of Cs-SAc-SLNs using AFM, SEM, and TEM confirmed 
their spherical morphology with a particle size of less than 200 nm. Moreover, 
the Cs-SAc-SLNs demonstrated a sustained drug release of 61.3 ± 1.7 % in 24 h. 
Remarkably, Cs-SAc-SLNs showed significant cellular uptake (P < 0.05) than 
uncoated SLNs in the Neuro-2a cell line. The histopathology study using nasal 
mucosa demonstrated the safety of the formulation, which makes it ideal for 
intranasal administration. The in vitro sustained drug release is well mapped 
with the in vivo pharmacokinetics study, indicating a 1.7-fold increase in the 
half-life (t1/2) of SAc. Interestingly, the chitosan-coated Cs-SAc-SLNs (i.n.) 
demonstrated a superior AUC0-∞ (3128.05 ± 129.42 ng/g*h) and showed a 
significant enhancement in brain bioavailability (3.7-fold) in terms of drug 
targeting efficiency as compared to plain SAc (i.v.). This improved brain 
delivery contributed to substantial neuroprotective effects in Aβ1-42-induced 
cognitively impaired mice. The study also supported the decreased biochemical 
markers levels of oxidative stress, cholinergic activity, and inflammatory 
cytokine levels (TNF-α) in the hippocampus and cortex of Aβ1-42-injected mice. 
Overall, the present study highlights the safe and enhanced cognitive function 
using chitosan-coated SLNs for AD treatment.

This review focuses on (i) 24 h patterns in the symptom intensity of common 
neurologic and psychiatric disorders and (ii) medications prescribed for their 
management that have a recommended administration time or schedule, presumably 
to potentiate desired and minimize undesired effects and by definition qualify 
them as chronotherapies. Predictable-in-time patterning of symptoms is exhibited 
by many neurologic -- headaches, multiple sclerosis, neurogenic orthostatic 
hypotension, neuropathic pain, Parkinson's disease, epileptic seizure, attention 
deficit hyperactivity, Alzheimer's disease - and psychiatric - eating, 
depressive, obsessive-compulsive, post-traumatic stress, anxiety, and panic - 
disorders, due either to circadian rhythms of disease pathophysiology or 
inadequacies of medication-delivery systems. Circadian disruption and circadian 
misalignment of the sleep-wake and other 24 h rhythms plus late chronotype are 
characteristic of many of these disorders, suggesting involvement in the 
mechanisms or consequence of their pathology or as an adverse effect of therapy, 
especially when administered at an inappropriate biological time. The 
Prescribers' Digital Reference, a compendium of all prescription medications 
approved for marketing in the US, reveals 65 of them are utilized to manage 
neurologic and psychiatric disorders by a specified time-of-day or an 
asymmetrical interval or strength of dose schedule, presumably to optimize 
beneficial and minimize adverse effects, thereby qualifying them as 
chronotherapies. Overall, the contents of this review are intended to inform the 
development of future chronotherapies that incorporate state-of-the-art 
drug-delivery systems to improve management of neurologic and psychiatric 
disorders and associated circadian malalignment and disruption.

Trehalose has been proposed as a possible therapeutic option for attenuating the 
neuropathological changes associated with neurodegeneration, including 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). The administration of trehalose in human and murine 
models was linked to restoring antioxidant status, decreasing lipoperoxidation, 
and alleviating neuroinflammation. This latter biochemical mechanism was 
associated with the upregulation of specific brain-enriched microRNAs (miRNA). 
Herein, using a direct hybridization approach, we evaluate trehalose intravenous 
treatment in AD patients, conducting a phase two clinical trial 
(IRCT20130829014521N15) examining the alteration of microRNA profiles before and 
after the treatment. Twenty patients were recruited and randomly assigned to two 
groups: the intervention group received 15 g/week of intravenous trehalose. The 
control group received placebo in the form of normal saline. The period chosen 
was 12 weeks. Blood samples were obtained at the beginning and end of the study. 
Circulating microRNAs expression data between the placebo and treatment groups 
were assessed using microarray analysis. Subsequently, differentially expressed 
(DE) miRNAs specific to the trehalose-treated group were identified, and their 
gene targets were determined by bioinformatics-based approaches. The analysis of 
DE miRNAs pointed out modulation in unique miRNAs between treatment and placebo 
groups. Specifically, hsa-miR-1268a, -3605-3p, -555, and -6511a-3p were 
significantly downregulated, while hsa-miR-324-3p and -539-5p showed significant 
upregulation. Of the 147 overlapped validated genes identified in the 
bioinformatics analysis, several are related to autophagy, protein aggregation, 
oxidative stress, and inflammation. KEGG enrichment pathways reveal regulation 
of actin cytoskeleton, axon guidance, and neurotrophin signaling pathways. The 
results identify significant modulation in unique miRNAs in AD patients under 
trehalose. These findings suggest the potential utility of these microRNAs as 
biomarkers for trehalose pharmacological monitoring in AD.

BACKGROUND: The combination of antidepressant and antipsychotic medication is an 
effective treatment for major depressive disorder with psychotic features 
('psychotic depression'). The present study aims to identify sociodemographic 
and clinical predictors of remission of psychotic depression treated with 
combination pharmacotherapy and determine the accuracy of prediction models.
METHODS: Two hundred and sixty-nine participants aged 18 to 85 years with 
psychotic depression were acutely treated with protocolized sertraline plus 
olanzapine for up to 12 weeks. Three cross-validated machine learning models 
were implemented to predict remission based on 74 sociodemographic and clinical 
variables measured at acute baseline. The optimal model for each method was 
selected by the average fold C-index. Based on the performance of each method, 
grouped elastic net (cox) regression was chosen to examine the association of 
each predictor with remission of psychotic depression.
RESULTS: Of the 269 participants, 145 (53.9 %) experienced full remission of the 
depressive episode and psychotic features. Multivariable models had 65.1 % to 
67.4 % accuracy in predicting remission. In the grouped elastic net (cox) 
regression model, longer duration of index episode, somatic or tactile 
hallucinations, higher burden of comorbid physical problems, and single or 
divorced marital status were independent predictors of longer time to remission. 
A higher number of lifetime depressive episodes and peripheral vascular or 
cardiovascular disease were predictors of shorter time to remission.
CONCLUSIONS: Future research needs to determine whether the addition of 
biomarkers to clinical and sociodemographic variables can improve model accuracy 
in predicting remission of pharmacologically-treated psychotic depression.

Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), such as Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, 
Huntington disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and frontotemporal dementia, 
are well known to pose formidable challenges for their treatment due to their 
intricate pathogenesis and substantial variability among patients, including 
differences in environmental exposures and genetic predispositions. One of the 
defining characteristics of NDs is widely reported to be the buildup of 
misfolded proteins. For example, Alzheimer disease is marked by amyloid beta and 
hyperphosphorylated Tau aggregates, whereas Parkinson disease exhibits 
α-synuclein aggregates. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal 
dementia exhibit TAR DNA-binding protein 43, superoxide dismutase 1, and 
fused-in sarcoma protein aggregates, and Huntington disease involves mutant 
huntingtin and polyglutamine aggregates. These misfolded proteins are the key 
biomarkers of NDs and also serve as potential therapeutic targets, as they can 
be addressed through autophagy, a process that removes excess cellular 
inclusions to maintain homeostasis. Various forms of autophagy, including 
macroautophagy, chaperone-mediated autophagy, and microautophagy, hold a promise 
in eliminating toxic proteins implicated in NDs. In this review, we focus on 
elucidating the regulatory connections between autophagy and toxic proteins in 
NDs, summarizing the cause of the aggregates, exploring their impact on 
autophagy mechanisms, and discussing how autophagy can regulate toxic protein 
aggregation. Moreover, we underscore the activation of autophagy as a potential 
therapeutic strategy across different NDs and small molecules capable of 
activating autophagy pathways, such as rapamycin targeting the mTOR pathway to 
clear α-synuclein and Sertraline targeting the AMPK/mTOR/RPS6KB1 pathway to 
clear Tau, to further illustrate their potential in NDs' therapeutic 
intervention. Together, these findings would provide new insights into current 
research trends and propose small-molecule drugs targeting autophagy as 
promising potential strategies for the future ND therapies. SIGNIFICANCE 
STATEMENT: This review provides an in-depth overview of the potential of 
activating autophagy to eliminate toxic protein aggregates in the treatment of 
neurodegenerative diseases. It also elucidates the fascinating 
interrelationships between toxic proteins and the process of autophagy of 
"chasing and escaping" phenomenon. Moreover, the review further discusses the 
progress utilizing small molecules to activate autophagy to improve the efficacy 
of therapies for neurodegenerative diseases by removing toxic protein 
aggregates.

Neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's 
disease, constitute pathological conditions of great relevance on health span 
and quality of life. The identification of novel therapeutic options, able to 
modulate the processes involved in the insurgence and progression of 
neurodegenerative disorders, represents an intriguing challenge of current 
research. Herein, a library of 36-membered 
2-(phenylamino)-7,8-dihydroquinazolinone derivatives was synthesized and 
biologically evaluated as human MAO inhibitors. Some compounds able to inhibit 
MAO-B potently and selectively (Ki in the nanomolar range) were identified, and 
robust structure-activity relationships were drawn, supported by computational 
studies. Further biological assays revealed a safe profile for all derivatives 
and, for compounds selected as the best MAO-B inhibitors (4, 5, 13, 14) the 
following properties also emerged: (i) the ability to inhibit MAO-B activity in 
whole cells, with an effectiveness comparable or slight lower with respect to 
the reference safinamide; (ii) physicochemical parameters suggesting 
drug-likeness properties; (iii) the ability to inhibit, albeit weakly, GSK3β 
kinase (for compound 4). Within the whole series, compound 4 stood out as a 
promising lead for future optimization campaigns aimed to obtain useful drugs 
for the treatment of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder influenced by both 
genetic and environmental factors. Identifying therapeutic targets and 
interventions remains challenging. This study utilized Mendelian Randomization 
(MR) to investigate causal relationships between plasma proteins, lifestyle 
factors, and AD, along with virtual screening to identify potential drug 
compounds. A two-sample MR analysis assessed associations between plasma 
proteins, identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and AD 
risk. Co-localization analysis (CA) confirmed the overlap between protein 
expression and AD susceptibility loci, and reverse MR ruled out reverse 
causality. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed to 
explore therapeutic targets, followed by virtual screening to identify 
small-molecule inhibitors for selected proteins. The analysis found significant 
associations between eight plasma proteins and AD, with five proteins (GSTP1, 
BIN1, Siglec-3, SERPINF2, and GRN) showing strong evidence of involvement in AD 
pathogenesis. Virtual screening identified six compounds as potential inhibitors 
of GSTP1 and four compounds as potential inhibitors of BIN1. Furthermore, MR 
analysis of lifestyle factors, such as dietary behaviors and smoking cessation, 
indicated they may influence AD risk through their effects on specific proteins. 
These findings offer novel insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying AD 
and highlight the potential of combining MR with virtual screening to identify 
therapeutic targets. The study also suggests that lifestyle modifications could 
offer alternative prevention and treatment strategies for AD. Future research 
should focus on the experimental validation of the identified compounds and 
further explore the mechanisms linking lifestyle factors to AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, 
affecting tens of millions worldwide with projections indicating increasing 
prevalence in coming decades. Characterized by progressive cognitive decline, AD 
manifests with varying degrees of executive, language, and visuospatial 
impairments that worsen over time, eventually leading to severe psychiatric 
symptoms, mobility difficulties, sleep disturbances, and incontinence. While 
pharmacological treatments remain the primary intervention approach, their 
efficacy often diminishes over time and may produce significant adverse effects. 
Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), as a non-invasive 
neuromodulation technique, has emerged as a promising alternative or 
complementary therapy. This literature review examines the therapeutic potential 
and mechanisms of rTMS in Alzheimer's disease. Through electromagnetic 
induction, rTMS can selectively modulate cortical excitability, with 
high-frequency stimulation (≥ 5 Hz) enhancing neural excitability and 
low-frequency stimulation (≤ 1 Hz) producing inhibitory effects. Recent clinical 
evidence demonstrates that rTMS can significantly improve cognitive function, 
memory, language abilities, and motor performance in AD patients, particularly 
when administered with optimized parameters targeting key brain regions, such as 
the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The neurobiological mechanisms underlying 
these effects include enhanced synaptic plasticity, increased expression of 
neurotrophic factors, modulation of neurotransmitter systems, and reduction of 
pathological protein aggregation. Meta-analyses indicate that high-frequency 
protocols (particularly 20 Hz) delivered over at least 3 weeks with a minimum of 
20 sessions produce the most significant cognitive improvements, with effects 
potentially persisting for months post-treatment. Combined approaches 
integrating rTMS with cognitive training show particular promise through 
synergistic enhancement of neuroplasticity. Despite encouraging results, 
standardization of treatment protocols and larger clinical trials are needed to 
establish definitive guidelines and determine long-term efficacy. This review 
synthesizes current evidence supporting rTMS as an effective intervention for 
alleviating clinical symptoms of Alzheimer's disease while highlighting 
opportunities for advancing its therapeutic application.

Neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by complex neurobiological changes 
that are reflected in biomarker alterations detectable in blood, cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) and with brain imaging. As accessible proxies for processes that are 
difficult to measure, biomarkers are tools that hold increasingly important 
roles in drug development and clinical trial decision making. In the past few 
years, biomarkers have been the basis for accelerated approval of new therapies 
for Alzheimer disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis as surrogate end points 
reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit.Blood-based biomarkers are 
emerging for Alzheimer disease and other neurodegenerative disorders (for 
example, Parkinson disease, frontotemporal dementia), and some biomarkers may be 
informative across multiple disease states. Collection of CSF provides access to 
biomarkers not available in plasma, including markers of synaptic dysfunction 
and neuroinflammation. Molecular imaging is identifying an increasing array of 
targets, including amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, inflammation, 
mitochondrial dysfunction and synaptic density. In this Review, we consider how 
biomarkers can be implemented in clinical trials depending on their context of 
use, including providing information on disease risk and/or susceptibility, 
diagnosis, prognosis, pharmacodynamic outcomes, monitoring, prediction of 
response to therapy and safety. Informed choice of increasingly available 
biomarkers and rational deployment in clinical trials support drug development 
decision making and de-risk the drug development process for neurodegenerative 
disorders.

The brain overlapping system-level architecture is associated with functional 
information integration in the multiple roles of the same region, and it has 
been developed as an underlying novel biomarker of brain disease and may 
characterise the indicators for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
However, it remains uncertain whether these changes are influenced by external 
magnetic stimulation and internal gene expression. A total of 73 AD-spectrum 
patients (52 with true stimulation and 21 with sham stimulation) were underwent 
four-week neuronavigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). 
Shannon-entropy diversity coefficient analysis was used to explore the brain 
overlapping system of the neuroimaging data in these pre- and posttreatment 
patients. Transcription-neuroimaging association analysis was further performed 
via gene expression data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas. Compared with the 
rTMS_sham stimulation group, the rTMS_true stimulation group achieved the goal 
of cognitive improvement through the reconstruction of functional information 
integration in the multiple roles of 27 regions associated with the brain 
overlapping system, involving the attentional network, sensorimotor network, 
default mode network and limbic network. Furthermore, these overlapping regions 
were closely linked to gene expression on cellular homeostasis and immune 
inflammation, and support vector regression analysis revealed that the baseline 
diversity coefficients of the attentional and sensorimotor networks can 
effectively predict memory improvement after rTMS treatment. These findings 
highlight the brain overlapping system associated with cognitive improvement, 
and provide the first evidence that external magnetic stimulation and internal 
gene expression could influence these overlapping regions in AD-spectrum 
patients.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the primary causes of dementia in the older 
population, affecting memories, cognitive levels, and the ability to accomplish 
simple activities gradually. Timely intervention and efficient control of the 
disease prove to be possible through early diagnosis. The conventional machine 
learning models designed for AD detection work well only up to a certain point. 
They usually require a lot of labeled data and do not transfer well to new 
datasets. Additionally, they incur long periods of retraining. Relatively 
powerful models of deep learning, however, also are very demanding in 
computational resources and data. In light of these, we put forward a new way of 
diagnosing AD using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and transfer learned 
convolutional neural networks (CNN). Transfer learning makes it easier to reduce 
the costs involved in training and improves performance because it allows the 
use of models which have been trained previously and which generalize very well 
even when there is very little training data available. In this research, we 
used three different pre-trained CNN based architectures (AlexNet, GoogleNet, 
and MobileNetV2) each implemented with several solvers (e.g. Adam, Stochastic 
Gradient Descent or SGD, and Root Mean Square Propagation or RMSprop). Our model 
achieved impressive classification results of 99.4% on the Kaggle MRI dataset as 
well as 98.2% on the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) database. 
Such results serve to demonstrate how transfer learning is an effective solution 
to the issues related to conventional models that limits the accuracy of 
diagnosis of AD, thus enabling their earlier and more accurate diagnosis. This 
would in turn benefit the patients by improving the treatment management and 
providing insights on the disease progression.

Histamine H3 receptor (H3R) antagonists regulate histamine release that 
modulates neuronal activity and cognitive function. Although H3R is elevated in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, whether H3R antagonists can rescue 
AD-associated neural impairments and cognitive deficits remains unknown. 
Pitolisant is a clinically approved H3R antagonist/inverse agonist that treats 
narcolepsy. Here, we find that pitolisant reverses AD-like pathophysiology and 
cognitive impairments in an AD mouse model. Behavioral assays and in vivo 
wide-field Ca2+ imaging revealed that recognition memory, learning flexibility, 
and slow-wave impairment were all improved following the 15-day pitolisant 
treatment. Improved recognition memory was tightly correlated with slow-wave 
coherence, suggesting slow waves serve as a biomarker for treatment response and 
for AD drug screening. Furthermore, pitolisant reduced amyloid-β deposition and 
dystrophic neurites surrounding plaques, and enhanced neuronal lysosomal 
activity, inhibiting which blocked cognitive and slow-wave restoration. Our 
findings identify pitolisant as a potential therapeutic agent for AD treatments.

The most effective pharmacologic intervention used to treat motor symptoms in 
Parkinson's disease is levodopa, which is available in various formulations, 
including newer continuous subcutaneous infusions. Dopamine agonists, monoamine 
oxidase-B enzyme inhibitors, catechol-O-methyltransferase enzyme inhibitors, 
amantadine, istradefylline, and anticholinergics can be used as adjuncts to 
levodopa. With disease progression, pharmacologic interventions alone may not 
suffice to manage motor symptoms, making it necessary to consider device-aided 
therapies (eg, levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel infusion, continuous 
subcutaneous infusions of apomorphine, levodopa, or foslevodopa) or invasive 
surgical techniques (eg, deep brain stimulation or MRI-guided high-frequency 
focused ultrasound).

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent type of neurological disorder 
characterized by cognitive decline and memory loss, marked by the accumulation 
of amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau protein, causing 
extensive neuronal death and neuroinflammation. There is growing evidence that 
AD development extends beyond the neuronal compartment and has a major impact on 
the immunological functions of the brain. The cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) 
detects cytosolic DNA, including pathogenic foreign DNA and self-DNA from 
cellular injury, triggering a type I interferon (IFN-I) response through 
activation of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING). The activation of the 
cGAS-STING pathway in response to mitochondrial dysfunction drives 
neuroinflammation in AD, which is mediated by the release of IFN-I cytokines. 
Furthermore, the release of oxidized mtDNA is necessary for the stimulation of 
the nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich-containing family, pyrin 
domain-containing-3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, which is a family of protein complexes 
that macrophages can produce to induce inflammation. AD becomes severe by the 
stimulation of the cGAS-STING pathway, which results in sterile inflammation and 
microglial dysfunction. This review aims to explore the potential impact of the 
cGAS-STING signaling pathway in the pathogenesis and progression of AD. 
Additionally; after overviewing recent findings, this article highlights the 
molecular mechanism involved in the onset of disease and its modulation 
regarding the therapeutic approach of AD. Finally, deliberated a deep insight, 
the cGAS-STING axis could provide novel therapeutic avenues for slowing or 
halting the progression of AD, thereby offering new prospects for treatment 
development.

Synchronisation of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) driven endogenous clock, 
located within the central nervous system (CNS), and exogenous time cues, is 
essential for maintaining circadian rhythmicity, homeostasis and overall 
wellbeing. Disordered circadian rhythms have been associated with various 
conditions, inclusive of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's 
disease and Parkinson's disease. Traditional pharmacological approaches to 
circadian dysfunction in neurodegenerative disorders have primarily focused on 
oral drug delivery. Oral medications often face challenges in achieving the 
necessary systemic circulation to effectively bypass the blood brain barrier 
(BBB) and reach the CNS, primarily due to low or variable bioavailability. 
Advancements in non-invasive delivery methods, such as orally inhaled and 
intranasal formulations, present promising alternatives for targeting the CNS. 
Orally inhaled and intranasal drug delivery allows for medications to rapidly 
achieve high systemic circulation through increased bioavailability and fast 
onset of action. Additionally, intranasal delivery allows for therapies to 
bypass the BBB through the olfactory or trigeminal nerve pathways to directly 
enter the CNS. This review assesses the potential for orally inhaled and 
intranasal therapies to treat circadian disorders in neurodegenerative 
conditions. In addition, this review will explore melatonin as an example of 
enhancing therapeutic outcomes by adopting inhaled or intranasal drug delivery 
formulations to improve drug absorption and target circadian disorder more 
effectively.

In this review we examine the neuroprotective potential of NAP (davunetide), a 
small peptide derived from Activity-Dependent Neuroprotective Protein (ADNP), in 
the context of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. ADNP, a 
protein essential for brain development and function, is associated with 
tauopathy-related diseases, such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD), and circadian 
rhythm regulation. NAP enhances microtubule stability and prevents tauopathy. In 
preclinical studies, NAP shows promise in improving cognitive performance and 
correcting behavioral deficits in different models. Clinical studies on NAP 
(davunetide) administered via intranasal delivery have demonstrated its safety, 
favorable bioavailability, and potential efficacy in improving cognitive 
function, making it a viable therapeutic option. In the pure tauopathy, 
progressive supranuclear palsy, NAP (davunetide) significantly slowed disease 
progression in women in a phase II-III clinical trial. Additionally, the complex 
interactions between ADNP, associated pathways, and circadian regulation and the 
extensive NAP compensation upon ADNP deficiency attest to further clinical 
development. Thus, NAP is an example of a reductionist approach in drug 
delivery, replacing/enhancing the critical large ADNP-related pathways including 
dysregulated microtubules and tauopathy with a small brain bioavailable 
investigational drug, davunetide.

It has been suggested that Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurological 
condition, can potentially be treated through epigenetic means by targeting 
histone deacetylases (HDACs), enzymes that regulate gene expression. In this 
study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of Bufexamac, in an animal model 
of AD. Bufexamac specifically targets Class IIb HDACs, which are particularly 
relevant in the context of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. This 
selectivity may reduce off-target effects commonly associated with 
broader-spectrum HDAC inhibitors, such as pan-HDAC inhibitors, which can affect 
multiple HDAC classes and potentially lead to undesirable side effects. Male 
rats injected with Aβ25-35 for AD-like symptoms were treated with 20 μg/rat 
Bufexamac for 8 days. Cognitive function, depression, and anxiety were assessed 
through behavioral tests, while Western blotting, H&E staining, and ELISA were 
used to detect protein expression, morphological changes, and enzyme activity. 
Bufexamac treatment markedly improved cognitive and behavioral impairments in 
Aβ-injected rats and regulated the key proteins related to neuroinflammation 
(GFAP, Iba1), histone, and α-tubulin acetylation. Simultaneously, it decreased 
the expression of proteins in the stromal interaction molecule (STIM) pathway. 
Furthermore, Bufexamac lowered the activity of monoamine oxidase enzymes, 
elevated the count of healthy neurons, and ameliorated neuronal structure in the 
hippocampus. Overall, these findings suggest that Bufexamac could be a more 
targeted therapy for AD than other non-selective HDAC inhibitors, which often 
have diverse functions and potential side effects. Bufexamac enhances cognitive 
function and alleviates depression and anxiety by regulating proteins related to 
neuroinflammation, histone, and α-tubulin acetylation, as well as modulating 
STIM levels and MAO activity.

Amyloid peptide non-fibrillar oligomers cause neurotoxicity and may contribute 
to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Mounting evidence indicates that 
Aβ1-42 oligomers disrupt and remodel neuronal membrane, causing neuronal cell 
death. The involvement of individual neuronal membrane constituents in real-time 
Aβ1-42 aggregate assembly is unclear due to complexity of neuronal cell 
membrane. We used non-Faradaic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to 
track monomeric Aβ1-42 peptide binding and aggregation pathways in real-time in 
asymmetric micropore suspended lipid bilayer membranes with anionic 
phospholipids and glycosphingolipids. Anionic DOPC:PIP2 pore suspended membrane 
showed pore-formation within 2 h of incubation, but peptide insertion occurred 
over 6 h, with an onset time of ∼6-8 h for peptide aggregation at the membrane 
surface. Among different gangliosides, peptide binding to GM1- and 
GM3-containing membranes did not result pore development, but receptor mediated 
peptide aggregation formation caused membrane admittance to decrease within 2 h. 
In contrast, partial peptide insertion in the membrane surface increases 
membrane admittance at GD1a and mixed GSL membranes, arresting aggregation. 
Time-lapsed AFM imaging at asymmetric solid supported lipid bilayers (aSLBs) 
corroborated EIS findings, capturing pore-formation and receptor mediated 
peptide assembly routes. Fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) imaging and 
spatial resolved single-point fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) at 
aSLBs revealed membrane-peptide interaction, assembly, and peptide induced 
membrane reorganization. Treatment with antidepressants fluoxetine and 
imipramine therapeutics, in synergy, which are cost-effective and capable of 
crossing the central nervous system (CNS+), resulted in the disassembly of 
membrane mediated Aβ1-42 aggregates, but not fibrils. Overall, the data suggests 
that membrane-mediated aggregate disassembly at the correct timing of AD 
progression may halt or reverse amyloid assembly through the use of repurposed 
drugs.

We simultaneously assessed the impact of transcranial direct current stimulation 
(tDCS) on mitigating both self-reported pain and pain behaviors to more 
objectively explore its effects in older adults with Alzheimer's disease and 
related dementias. The analysis investigated 40 participants randomly (1:1) 
subjected to active and sham tDCS for 20 min on 5 consecutive days. Multi-group 
latent transition analysis enabled the simultaneous evaluation of both pain 
domains in a single model and analysis of their changes as a function of 
intervention exposure by modeling the transition probabilities of latent classes 
and comparing these changes between groups. Two pain categories ("high pain" and 
"low pain") were identified based on the numeric rating scale and 
mobilization-observation-behavior-intensity-dementia scale scores. Overall, tDCS 
demonstrated better effects in helping participants transition to a "low pain" 
status during and after the intervention (∼3 months) compared with sham 
stimulation, demonstrating its immediate and enduring effects.

To date, no therapeutic drugs available on the market can effectively reverse 
the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although Glucagon-like peptide-1 
(GLP-1) receptor agonists (RAs) and Cholecystokinin (CCK) RAs have shown some 
promise in AD research, little is known about the neuroprotective effects of a 
novel dual CCK/GLP-1 RA in AD. This study sought to examine the effects of the 
novel dual CCK/GLP-1 RA on cognitive performance in an AD mouse model and to 
explore the associated mechanisms. Our findings indicate that dual CCK/GLP-1 RA 
improved cognitive deficits, reduced amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulation, and 
alleviated mitochondrial damage in 5 × FAD mice by inducing mitophagy. In an in 
vitro model of AD cells induced by Aβ, CCK/GLP-1 RA could exert neuroprotective 
effects by regulating PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy. These data reveal for the 
first time that the new CCK/GLP-1 RA modulates mitophagy via PINK1/Parkin 
pathway and enhances cognitive function in the 5 × FAD animal model. Moreover, 
the performance of the CCK/GLP-1 RA in certain indicators was superior to that 
of GLP-1 analogue liraglutide, suggesting that it may represent a more promising 
therapeutic option for AD.

Ceruloplasmin (CP) is a multi-copper ferroxidase mainly synthesized by liver, 
secreted into the peripheral blood, playing a critical role in regulating the 
iron homeostasis. In the central nervous system (CNS), the CP expressed by 
astrocytes plays an important role in the transportation of iron from the blood 
across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) into the brain. Our previous study showed 
that conditional knockout of astrocytic CP with Cre-LoxP system (CpGfapcKO) not 
only improved the learning and memory abilities of elderly mice, but also 
impaired the learning and memory abilities of young mice. In order to further 
investigate the effects of CP on learning and memory with aging, we constructed 
mice model with tamoxifen-induced astrocyte specific knockout of CP, induced CP 
knockout at 12 months old, and observed the effects on mouse learning and memory 
at 18 months old. We were delighted to found that ablation of astrocytic CP by 
tamoxifen at 12 months old could similarly enhance the learning, memory and 
recognition abilities in 18-month-old mice. Iron deposition in the hippocampus 
associated with aging was mitigated, leading to a reduction in oxidative stress. 
The MAPK/JNK pathway exhibited attenuation, while the PI3K/Akt/GSK3 pathway 
showed enhancement. This combination is expected to result in the reduction of 
the phosphorylation level of MYC and the elevation of the nuclear translocation 
of MYC, which might then contribute to reduced cellular senescence. 
Additionally, the ROS/MAPK/Erk and ROS/MAPK/p38 pathways-dependent cell 
apoptosis in hippocampus was diminished. The hallmarks of Alzheimer's Disease 
(AD) were all significantly reduced. Ultimately, the alleviated cellular 
senescence along with the reduction in AD-related markers, coincided with an 
improvement in learning, memory, and recognition abilities. These findings 
further elucidated the role of CP in brain iron metabolism, offering a novel 
target and strategy for the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative 
diseases, such as AD associated with aging.

PURPOSE: Treatment of Underlying Forms (TUF) is a training program grounded in 
linguistic theory and aiming to boost complex sentences production in people 
with agrammatism. Language treatment studies in aphasia confirmed TUF efficacy 
and led to the formulation of the Complexity Account of Treatment Efficacy 
(CATE). According to CATE, which relies on the primitive distinction between A- 
and A'-structures, training complex sentences induces an improvement on simpler 
structures, but no generalization occurs between different types of syntactic 
movement. This experiment provides the first adaptation of TUF in Italian and 
investigates the cross-linguistic validity of training efficacy and its 
generalization pattern.
METHOD: Using a single-subject experimental design, five participants with 
chronic poststroke agrammatism underwent intensive training for object 
relatives. Performance on trained and untrained object relatives 
(A'-structures), object clefts (simpler A'-structures), and passive sentences 
(A-structures) was measured at multiple time points, that is, pre- and 
posttreatment, during the training, and at follow-up. A standardized assessment 
of aphasia was also administered pre- and posttreatment.
RESULTS: The results reported a robust improvement in the production of trained 
and untrained object relatives in all five participants, a generalization to 
object clefts in four participants, and, unexpectedly, a generalization to 
passives in three participants. All participants showed improved comprehension 
on all these structures. A general linguistic improvement was also found in the 
standardized testing of aphasia, especially in morphosyntactic abilities.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings confirmed the efficacy of the Italian adaptation of 
TUF for object relatives supporting its use in the clinical practice. To explain 
the generalization to passives in Italian but not in the English version of TUF, 
we propose an amendment of CATE that takes the syntactic operation of Internal 
Merge as a primitive (keeping the A vs. A' distinction as a modulating factor).

MOTIVATION: Precision medicine leverages patient-specific multimodal data to 
improve prevention, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of diseases. Advancing 
precision medicine requires the non-trivial integration of complex, 
heterogeneous, and potentially high-dimensional data sources, such as 
multi-omics and clinical data. In the literature, several approaches have been 
proposed to manage missing data, but are usually limited to the recovery of 
subsets of features for a subset of patients. A largely overlooked problem is 
the integration of multiple sources of data when one or more of them are 
completely missing for a subset of patients, a relatively common condition in 
clinical practice.
RESULTS: We propose miss-Similarity Network Fusion (miss-SNF), a novel 
general-purpose data integration approach designed to manage completely missing 
data in the context of patient similarity networks. miss-SNF integrates 
incomplete unimodal patient similarity networks by leveraging a non-linear 
message-passing strategy borrowed from the SNF algorithm. miss-SNF is able to 
recover missing patient similarities and is "task agnostic", in the sense that 
can integrate partial data for both unsupervised and supervised prediction 
tasks. Experimental analyses on nine cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome 
Atlas (TCGA) demonstrate that miss-SNF achieves state-of-the-art results in 
recovering similarities and in identifying patients subgroups enriched in 
clinically relevant variables and having differential survival. Moreover, 
amputation experiments show that miss-SNF supervised prediction of cancer 
clinical outcomes and Alzheimer's disease diagnosis with completely missing data 
achieves results comparable to those obtained when all the data are available.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: miss-SNF code, implemented in R, is available 
at https://github.com/AnacletoLAB/missSNF.

Studies comparing the effects of Angiotensin II (Ang-II) stimulating and 
inhibiting antihypertensive medications (AHMs) on dementia risk have reported 
inconsistent findings. Based on the PRISMA guidelines, this study was performed 
to pool these findings. We searched PubMed, Scopus, Embase Ovid, PsycINFO, and 
CINAHL from inception to 22 May 2024 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and 
observational studies that compared the use of Ang-II stimulating (thiazides, 
Ang-II receptor blockers, and dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers) and 
inhibiting AHMs (β-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and 
non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers) and the subsequent risk of 
developing dementia. Two reviewers independently performed study selection, data 
extraction, and quality assessment. Random effects meta-analysis models were 
used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) or risk ratios (RRs) with their confidence 
intervals (CIs). All-cause dementia was the primary outcome. Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), vascular dementia (VD), and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were secondary 
outcomes. We included 18 studies with 1,883,283 participants. Observational 
studies showed that the use of Ang-II stimulating AHMs reduced the risk of 
all-cause dementia by 13% (HR = 0.87; 95% CI = 0.82-0.93) compared with Ang-II 
inhibiting AHMs. The risk of AD was reduced by 12% (HR = 0.88; 95% 
CI = 0.86-0.90), VD by 19% (HR = 0.81; 95% CI = 0.72-0.91), and MCI by 24% 
(HR = 0.76; 95% CI = 0.68-0.85) in these studies. A meta-analysis of four RCTs 
revealed a non-significant 8% reduction in dementia risk with Ang-II stimulating 
AHMs versus control (RR = 0.92; 95% CI = 0.79-1.08). Observational evidence 
suggests that Ang-II stimulating AHMs may offer neuroprotective benefits 
relative to Ang-II inhibiting AHMs.

OBJECTIVE: This cross-sectional study examined associations between 24-hour 
time-use composition (i.e. sleep, sedentary time, light physical activity and 
moderate-to-vigorous physical activity) and cognitive performance and explored 
whether demographic or genetic factors moderated these relationships.
METHODS: This analysis included baseline data from cognitively unimpaired older 
adults (n = 648) enrolled in the Investigating Gains in Neurocognition in an 
Intervention Trial of Exercise study. Time use was measured using wrist-worn 
triaxial accelerometers. Cognitive domains were determined using a confirmatory 
factor analysis from a comprehensive neuropsychological battery. Linear 
regression models tested associations between time-use composition and cognitive 
factors, adjusting for age, sex, education, body mass index, apolipoprotein E4 
(APOE4) allele carriage and study site. Interaction terms evaluated moderation 
of time use by age, sex, education and APOE4 status. We also examined the 
theoretical impact of reallocating time between time-use behaviours on cognitive 
performance using compositional isotemporal substitution methods.
RESULTS: Time-use composition was associated with processing speed (F = 5.16, 
P = .002), working memory (F = 4.81, P = .003) and executive 
function/attentional control (F = 7.09, P < .001) but not episodic memory (F 
= 2.28, P = .078) or visuospatial function (F = 2.26, P = .081). Post hoc 
isotemporal substitution analyses found that significant associations were 
driven by time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), with 
lesser amounts of MVPA associated with poorer cognitive performance. There was 
no evidence of moderation by any tested factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Increasing or decreasing MVPA, at the expense of time spent in 
sleep, sedentary behaviour or light physical activity, may be related to 
individual variation in processing speed, executive function/attentional control 
and working memory in older adulthood.

BackgroundFew recent studies have examined the trends in dementia 
hospitalization in high-income countries.ObjectiveTo estimate the trends in 
hospitalization for dementia in people with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and the 
general population in Australia using linked, national 
databases.MethodsAustralians with T2DM and registered on the National Diabetes 
Services Scheme (n = 438,264), and the general population (n = 8,090,993) from 
2010-2011 to 2016-2017 served as the study cohort. Annual rates of 
hospitalization for dementia were calculated for these individuals aged ≥50 
years. Following this, the trends in the rate of hospitalization were estimated 
using joinpoint regression and summarized as annual percent changes 
(APCs).ResultsIncreases in hospitalization for dementia over time were observed 
for the T2DM and the general population; APC 5.2 (95% CI 3.5, 7.3) and 9.4 (95% 
CI 3.8, 14.3), respectively. The absolute age- and sex-standardized rate of 
dementia hospitalization was found to be higher in the T2DM than the general 
population. For vascular dementia, a higher rate of hospitalization was observed 
for the T2DM population compared to the general population. Conversely, the rate 
of hospitalization for Alzheimer's disease was higher in the general population 
than in the T2DM cohort. Further, a higher dementia hospitalization rate was 
observed among males compared to females in both T2DM, and the general 
population.ConclusionsDespite the previous studies reporting a decline in 
dementia incidence in high-income countries, the rate of dementia 
hospitalization in Australia has risen steadily from 2010-2016 in both T2DM 
individuals and the general population.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Alzheimer's disease (AD) progresses with Aβ plaque 
deposition and neuroinflammation. Given the complexity of AD pathology, 
single-target therapies have frequently failed in clinical trials. We 
hypothesized that a multitarget approach could yield better therapeutic 
outcomes. To this end, we identified isobavachalcone (IBC), a natural compound 
with dual pharmacological activity in reducing Aβ plaques and neuroinflammation.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE: Primary astrocytes were isolated from 3 to 4 days old 
C57BL/6J mice pups for in-vitro assays, while in-vivo studies were conducted on 
5x-FAD mice. Protein alterations were evaluated using ELISA, western blotting, 
immunocytochemistry, and immunohistochemistry. Behavioral analyses included the 
radial arm maze, open field, and rotarod tests. Data from all in vitro and in 
vivo experiments were analyzed by using one-way ANOVA and post-hoc Bonferroni 
tests.
RESULTS: In-vitro analyses in astrocytes demonstrated that IBC at 5 and 10 μM 
concentrations induce AMPK phosphorylation through CAMKK2, promoting autophagy 
and inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome in primary astrocytes. IBC-treated 
astrocytes exhibited significant clearance of extracellular amyloid beta. 
Mechanistic studies highlighted autophagy as a key factor in reducing both NLRP3 
inflammasome activity and Aβ levels. Two months of treatment of 5x-FAD mice with 
IBC at 25 and 50 mg/kg significantly improved cognitive functions, as evidenced 
by enhanced memory and motor performance in behavioral tests. Subsequent brain 
tissue analysis revealed that IBC upregulated autophagic proteins to reduce the 
brain's amyloid beta levels, resulting in decreased expression of 
neuroinflammation markers.
CONCLUSION: IBC effectively ameliorates AD pathology through autophagy-mediated 
clearance of Aβ and suppressing neuroinflammation in 5x-FAD mice.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease in 
the elderly. Its pathological features include: A lot of misfolding and abnormal 
aggregation of amyloid protein (Aβ); Autophagy disorder, oxidative stress, 
neuroinflammation, abnormal phosphorylated tau protein and synaptic dysfunction. 
Modern pharmacological studies have found that Paisinhin A (PA) has beneficial 
effects on the prevention and treatment of central nervous system diseases. This 
study aims to explore the role and mechanism of PA in AD through autophagy 
pathway, and lay a scientific foundation for the development of clinical 
prevention and treatment strategies for AD.
METHODS: N2AAPP cells were treated with different concentrations of PA. Cell 
viability was detected by CCK-8 method. Western blotting detected the expression 
levels of proteins related to amyloid production, autophagy pathway, and 
phosphorylated Tau expression levels. Autophagy flow was detected by 
transfecting Lc3 double fluorescent plasmid. After Aβ was injected into the 
hippocampus of WT mice and PA was injected intraperitoneally, the learning and 
memory ability of WT mice were tested by new object recognition, y maze and 
water maze. The oxidative stress level was detected by the kit. The levels of 
inflammatory factors were detected by RT-qpcr.
RESULTS: The viability of N2AAPP cells was not affected at different 
concentrations of PA, but PS1 was significantly decreased at 40μM. PA can 
obviously improve the accumulation of autophagy in AD, and to some extent save 
the autophagy inhibition of CQ. Behavioral studies have shown that PA can also 
improve learning and memory impairments caused by Aβ injections. In addition, in 
vivo experiments, PA can also improve oxidative stress levels, inflammation 
levels and salvage dysfunctions of synapses. PA also reduces the levels of total 
and phosphorylated Tau in N2ATau.
DISCUSSION: Our study provides the first evidence that PA improves learning and 
memory in Aβ-induced AD mice. This effect appears to be mediated by PA by 
promoting autophagy and reducing oxidative stress. It was also found that PA may 
have a role in regulating inflammation, improving abnormally phosphorylated tau, 
and salvaging damaged synaptic function, providing valuable insights into 
potential applications in the treatment and prevention of AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common age-related neurodegenerative 
disease and cause of dementia. AD pathology primarily involves the formation of 
amyloid β (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles containing 
hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau). While Aβ targeted treatments have shown 
clinical promise, other aspects of AD pathology such as microgliosis, 
astrocytosis, synaptic loss, and hypometabolism may be viable targets for 
treatment. Among notable novel therapeutic approaches, the Ras homolog 
(Rho)-associated kinases (ROCKs) are being investigated as targets for AD 
treatment, based on the observations that ROCK1/2 levels are elevated in AD, and 
activation or inhibition of ROCKs changes dendritic/synaptic structures, protein 
aggregate accumulation, inflammation, and gliosis. This review will highlight 
key findings on the effects of ROCK inhibition in Aβ and ptau pathologies, as 
well as its effects on neuroinflammation, synaptic density, and potentially 
metabolism and bioenergetics.

INTRODUCTION: Piperine, the major component in Piper retrofractum and Piper 
nigrum, had potential therapeutic effects on central nervous system diseases 
such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy and fragile 
X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome. However, its low aqueous solubility (0.04 
mg/mL) limits brain uptake and pharmacological investigations at higher doses. 
In the current study, formulation strategies and routes of administration were 
assessed to enhance systemic and brain uptake of piperine.
METHODS: Formulation of piperine nanoparticles (PIP NPs) was developed to 
enhance its solubility. PIP NPs were prepared using flash nanoprecipitation via 
a four-stream Multi-Inlet Vortex Mixer, employing an aqueous solution of 
poloxamer 188 and an ethanolic solution containing piperine and Eudragit 
L100-55. The process was optimized using the Design of Experiments to minimize 
the particle size and maximize the encapsulation efficiency of piperine. 
Additionally, we investigated the impact of administrating PIP NPs via oral and 
intranasal routes on its systemic and brain uptake.
RESULTS: The optimized PIP NPs formulation exhibited a particle size of 
171.45±2.38 nm, polydispersity index of 0.27±0.01, zeta potential of -43.71±5.11 
mV, encapsulation efficiency of 92.49±1.92% and drug loading of 15.07±0.09%. 
Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed the successful encapsulation 
of piperine into nanoparticles. The PIP NPs could significantly increase the 
aqueous solubility of piperine from 0.04 mg/mL to 52.31±0.9 mg/mL and release 
piperine with a 12.83-fold higher rate than that from piperine suspension. Both 
oral and intranasal administrations of PIP NPs to C57BL/6 mice at 20 mg/kg 
demonstrated an increase in AUC0-120min for both plasma (7.9-10 times) and brain 
(4.7-5.0 times) comparing to that from piperine suspension, with no significant 
difference between these two routes.
DISCUSSION: Our findings suggested that increasing solubility rather than 
changing the administration route served as the most critical step to enhance 
the brain uptake of piperine.

Incident Dementia Subtypes.

BACKGROUND: Shared genetic and lifestyle risk factors may underlie the 
development of both coronary artery disease (CAD) and dementia. We examined 
whether an increased genetic risk for CAD is associated with long-term risk of 
developing all-cause, Alzheimer's, or vascular dementia, and investigated 
whether differences in potentially modifiable lifestyle factors in the mid- to 
late-life period may attenuate this risk.
METHODS: A prospective cohort study of 365 782 participants free from dementia 
for at least 5 years after baseline assessment was conducted within the UK 
Biobank cohort. Genetic risk was assessed using a genomewide polygenic risk 
score (PRS) for CAD and lifestyle risk using a modified version of the American 
Heart Association's Life's Essential 8 Lifestyle Risk Score (LRS). Higher values 
for both scores were deemed to represent increased risk. Primary outcomes were 
incident all-cause, Alzheimer's, and vascular dementia diagnoses obtained from 
self-report and electronic health records. Secondary outcomes were neuroimaging 
phenotypes measured in 32 028 participants recalled for magnetic resonance 
imaging. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the extent by which 
biological and behavioral risk factors contributed to observed associations.
RESULTS: A total of 8870 cases of all-cause dementia were observed over a median 
13.9-year follow-up. Both genetic (PRS) and lifestyle (LRS) risk scores for CAD 
were associated with a modestly elevated risk of all-cause dementia (subhazard 
ratio per SD increase, 1.10 [1.08, 1.12], P<0.001, for PRS and 1.04 [1.02, 
1.06], P=0.006, for LRS). This risk appeared largely attributable to underlying 
vascular dementia diagnoses (subhazard ratio, 1.16 [1.11, 1.21], P<0.001 for PRS 
and 1.15 [1.09, 1.22], P<0.001, for LRS), because Alzheimer's disease was found 
to demonstrate moderate associations with PRS alone (subhazard ratio, 1.09 
[1.06, 1.13]; P<0.001). LRS was found to have an additive rather than 
interactive effect with PRS, with individuals in the highest tertiles for both 
genetic and lifestyle risk for CAD ≈70% more likely to develop vascular dementia 
during follow-up compared with those in the lowest tertiles for both (subhazard 
ratio, 1.71 [1.39, 2.11]; P<0.001). This was substantially attenuated in those 
with a low LRS at baseline, however, regardless of underlying genetic risk (30% 
reduction for low versus high LRS tertile regardless of PRS tertile; P<0.001 for 
all). In a subset of individuals recalled for neuroimaging assessments, those in 
the highest tertiles for genetic and lifestyle risk for CAD demonstrated a ≈25% 
greater volume of white matter hyperintensities than those in the lowest risk 
tertiles, but showed little difference in gray matter or hippocampal volumes. 
Sensitivity analyses identified associations between both biological and 
behavioral risk scores with white matter hyperintensity burden and vascular 
dementia, whereas some Alzheimer's dementia associations showed seemingly 
paradoxical relationships.
CONCLUSIONS: Individuals who are genetically predisposed to developing CAD also 
face an increased risk of developing dementia in old age. This risk is reduced 
in those demonstrating healthy lifestyle profiles earlier in the lifespan, 
particularly in those who may be at an increased risk of developing dementia 
caused by an underlying vascular pathology.

Over the past few decades, extensive basic, translational and clinical research 
has been devoted to deciphering the physiological and pathogenic roles of 
extracellular vesicles (EVs) in the nervous system. The presence of brain 
cell-derived EVs in the blood, carrying diverse cargoes, has enabled the 
development of predictive, diagnostic, prognostic, disease-monitoring and 
treatment-response biomarkers for various neurological disorders. In this 
Review, we consider how EV biomarkers can bring us closer to understanding the 
complex pathogenesis of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer disease, 
Parkinson disease, stroke, traumatic brain injury, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
and multiple sclerosis. We describe how translational research on EVs might 
unfold bidirectionally, proceeding from basic to clinical studies but also in 
the opposite direction, with biomarker findings in the clinic leading to novel 
hypotheses that can be tested in the laboratory. We demonstrate the potential 
value of EVs across all stages of the therapeutic development pipeline, from 
identifying therapeutic targets to the use of EVs as reporters in model systems 
and biomarkers in clinical research. Finally, we discuss how the cargo and 
physicochemical properties of naturally occurring and custom-engineered EVs can 
be leveraged as novel treatments and vehicles for drug delivery, potentially 
revolutionizing neurotherapeutics.

Alzheimer's disease is characterized by progressive memory loss and cognitive 
decline. The hippocampal formation is the most vulnerable brain area in 
Alzheimer's disease. Neurons in layer II of the entorhinal cortex and the CA1 
region of the hippocampus are lost at early stages of the disease. A unique 
feature of the hippocampus is the formation of new neurons that incorporate in 
the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. New neurons form synapses with neurons in 
layer II of the entorhinal cortex and with the CA3 region. Immature and new 
neurons are characterized by high level of plasticity. They play important roles 
in learning and memory. Hippocampal neurogenesis is impaired early in mouse 
models of Alzheimer's disease and in human patients. In fact, neurogenesis is 
compromised in mild cognitive impairment (MCI), suggesting that rescuing 
neurogenesis may restore hippocampal plasticity and attenuate neuronal 
vulnerability and memory loss. This review will discuss the current 
understanding of therapies that target neurogenesis or modulate it, for the 
treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

The Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) is a selective barrier between the Central Nervous 
System (CNS) and the peripheral system, regulating the distribution of 
molecules. BBB permeability has been crucial in CNS-targeting drug development, 
such as glioblastoma-related drug discovery. In addition, more CNS diseases 
still present significant challenges, for instance, neurological disorders like 
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and drug abuse. Conversely, cannabinoid drugs that do 
not cross the BBB are needed to avoid off-target CNS psychotropic effects. In 
vitro and in vivo experiments measuring BBB permeability are costly and low 
throughput. Computational pharmacoanalytics modeling, particularly using 
deep-learning Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offers a promising alternative. GNNs 
excel at capturing intricate relationships in graph-based information, such as 
small molecular structures. In this study, we developed GNNs model for BBB 
permeability using the graph representation of drugs. The GNNs were compared 
with other algorithms using molecular fingerprints or physical-chemical 
descriptors. With a dataset of 1924 molecules, the best GNNs model, a 
convolutional graph neural network using a normalized Laplacian matrix (GCN_2), 
achieved a precision of 0.94, recall of 0.96, F1 score of 0.95, and MCC score of 
0.77. This outperformed other machine learning algorithms with molecular 
fingerprints. The findings indicate that the graphic representation of small 
molecules combined with GNNs architecture is powerful in predicting BBB 
permeability with high accuracy and recall. The developed GNNs model can be 
utilized in the initial screening stage for new drug development.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition marked by 
cognitive decline, largely resulting from the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) 
plaques. Targeting Aβ has gained significant attention as a potential 
therapeutic approach for AD. In this study, cellulose beads (CBs) were 
covalently functionalized with human serum albumin (HSA). The functionalized CBs 
were extensively characterized using FTIR, SEM, XPS, and thermal analysis, 
confirming successful stepwise modification and HSA immobilization on their 
surface. The degree of HSA immobilization reached the highest level for fine CBs 
(50-75 μm), yielding 1.25 μg, 5.86 μg, and 6.45 μg of HSA per mg of beads 
treated with 1 %, 5 %, and 7 % HSA solutions, respectively. The GFP-Aβ fusion 
protein, recombinantly expressed and purified as a model ligand, was then 
adsorbed onto HSA-coated CBs and qualitatively analyzed by confocal microscopy. 
Quantitative adsorption studies demonstrated that HSA-coated CBs sequestered 
335 ng/g of GFP-Aβ in PBS and 114 ng/g in human serum. Time-dependent and 
column-based assays also showed 318 ng/g sequestration capacities in PBS and 
115 ng/g in human serum, respectively. These findings demonstrate 
HSA-functionalized CBs as a promising extracorporeal system for Aβ clearance, 
with vast potential therapeutic application as an AD modifying approach.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common and severe degenerative 
disorder of the central nervous system in the elderly, profoundly impacting 
patients' quality of life. However, effective therapeutic agents for AD are 
still lacking. Bazi Bushen capsule (BZBS) is a traditional Chinese herbal 
compound with potential neuroprotective effects, yet its underlying mechanisms 
remain poorly understood.
METHODS: In this study, we utilized APP/PS1 transgenic mice to assess the 
therapeutic efficacy of BZBS. Initially, we evaluated the spatial learning and 
memory of the mice using the Barnes maze. The brain microcirculation was 
assessed through a small-animal ultrasound system, two-photon in vivo imaging, 
and micro-computed tomography angiography. Molecular, biochemical, and 
pathological analyses were conducted on brain tissues. Through network 
pharmacology, we identified potential intervention pathways and targets for BZBS 
in the treatment of AD, which we subsequently validated both in vivo and in 
vitro. Additionally, we employed molecular virtual docking screening and 
biolayer interferometry to elucidate the direct interactions of ginsenoside Rg5 
and ginsenoside Ro in BZBS with AMPK and LKB1 proteins.
RESULTS: The BZBS intervention significantly enhanced spatial learning and 
memory in APP/PS1 mice while decreasing Aβ deposition. Furthermore, BZBS 
protected cerebrovascular homeostasis and mitigated neuroinflammation, as 
evidenced by decreased blood-brain barrier permeability, increased expression of 
tight-junction proteins, and restored cerebral blood flow. Mechanistically, 
ginsenosides Rg5 and Ro in BZBS directly bind to AMPK and LKB1 proteins, 
activating the LKB1-AMPK-SIRT1 signaling pathway, promoting autophagy and 
mitochondrial autophagy, and alleviating oxidative stress damage in endothelial 
cells.
CONCLUSIONS: BZBS enhances autophagy-related activity, decreases Aβ deposition, 
and improves endothelial cell homeostasis through the activation of the 
LKB1-AMPK-SIRT1 signaling pathway, ultimately leading to improved cognitive 
function in mice with AD. This study highlights the importance of enhancing 
autophagic activity and maintaining cerebrovascular homeostasis in mitigating 
cognitive decline in AD, providing evidence and new insights into the 
application of compound medicines for treating age-related neurological 
disorders.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia and one of the 
leading causes of death in the United States, and despite our best efforts and 
recent advancements, a treatment that stops or substantially slows its 
progression has remained elusive. Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs), hold the 
potential to alleviate some of the common issues in the field by serving to 
better differentiate AD and non-AD individuals. These vesicles could provide 
insights into therapeutic targets, and potentially an avenue towards early 
detection. We compared the sEV cargo profiles of AD and non-AD brains (n = 6) 
and identified significant differences in both the micro RNA (miRNA) and 
Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) cargo through sEV isolation from temporal cortex 
tissue, followed by small RNA sequencing, and differential expression analysis. 
Differentially expressed miRNAs targeting systems relevant to AD included 
miR-206, miR-4516, miR-219a-5p, and miR-486-5p. Significant piRNAs included 
piR-6,565,525, piR-2,947,194, piR-7,181,973, and piR-7,326,987. These targets 
warrant further study for their potential role in the progression of AD 
pathology by dysregulating cellular activity; additionally, future large-scale 
studies of neuronal sEV miRNA profiles may facilitate the development of 
diagnostic tools which can aid in clinical trial design and recruitment. 
Longitudinal analysis of sEV data, perhaps accessible through plasma surveyance, 
will help determine at what point these miRNA and/or piRNA profiles begin to 
diverge between AD and non-AD individuals.

BACKGROUND: There have been contradictory findings on the associations between 
lipids and cognitive decline (CD), which may be attributed to the heterogeneity 
in the APOE4 carrier status, given APOE's lipid transportation roles. However, 
extant studies rarely examined the modifying effects of APOE4 carrier status on 
the associations between lipids and CD.
METHODS: We analyzed the Chicago Health and Aging Project, a 20-year cohort 
study comprising older adults with lipid panel assayed, i.e., total cholesterol 
(TC), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and low-density 
lipoprotein (LDL), and longitudinal cognitive tests. We ran adjusted linear 
mixed-effects models, regressing cognitive test composite on each of the four 
lipids independently, first with the total sample and subsequently using 
interaction and stratified subgroup analyses, examining the modifying effects of 
APOE4 carrier status on the associations.
RESULTS: 3,496 biracial community-dwelling older adults were recruited from the 
South side of Chicago (58% African American & 64% women; mean follow-up = 4.6 
years). In the total sample, there was a borderline association between TG and 
CD, estimate (SD, p-value) = 0.0001 (0.0000,0.0565). No associations were 
detected with other lipids. In the interaction and subgroup analyses, only in ε4 
carriers that higher TC levels were significantly associated with accelerated 
CD, -0.020 (0.009,0.035), whereas higher TG levels were significantly associated 
with decelerated CD, 0.001 (0.001,0.045). No modifying effects of ε4 carrier 
status were detected with other lipids.
DISCUSSION: Specific lipids, i.e., TC and TG, were associated with CD only in 
the ε4 carriers, highlighting the potential importance of measuring APOE4 status 
to better inform risk prediction and treatment.

Werner syndrome (WS), caused by mutations in the RecQ helicase WERNER (WRN) 
gene, is a classical accelerated aging disease with patients suffering from 
several metabolic dysfunctions without a cure. While, as we previously reported, 
depleted NAD+ causes accumulation of damaged mitochondria, leading to 
compromised metabolism, how mitochondrial NAD+ changes in WS and the impact on 
WS pathologies were unknown. We show that loss of WRN increases senescence in 
mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) likely related to dysregulation of metabolic and 
aging pathways. In line with this, NAD+ augmentation, via supplementation with 
nicotinamide riboside, reduces senescence and improves mitochondrial metabolic 
profiles in MSCs with WRN knockout (WRN-/-) and in primary fibroblasts derived 
from WS patients compared to controls. Moreover, WRN deficiency results in 
decreased mitochondrial NAD+ (measured indirectly via mitochondrially-expressed 
PARP activity), and altered expression of key salvage pathway enzymes, including 
NMNAT1 and NAMPT; ChIP-seq data analysis unveils a potential co-regulatory axis 
between WRN and the NMNATs, likely important for chromatin stability and DNA 
metabolism. However, restoration of mitochondrial or cellular NAD+ is not 
sufficient to reinstall cellular proliferation in immortalized cells with 
siRNA-mediated knockdown of WRN, highlighting an indispensable role of WRN in 
proliferation even in an NAD+ affluent environment. Further cell and animal 
studies are needed to deepen our understanding of the underlying mechanisms, 
facilitating related drug development.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or 
dementia work with family caregivers and clinicians to manage multidrug 
regimens; however, problems with medication management are common and contribute 
to avoidable hospitalizations among individuals with dementia. We sought to 
describe the initiation of these triadic clinical encounters and medication 
management to identify opportunities to enhance them.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews 
among individuals with MCI or dementia, their family caregivers, and primary 
care clinicians. Clinicians were not required to provide care for enrolled 
patients. Interview guides were informed by the Triadic Dementia Care Framework. 
Transcripts were analyzed following the Framework Method.
RESULTS: We enrolled 32 patients, 32 caregivers, and 25 clinicians. Patients, 
caregivers, and clinicians all prioritized patient-focused clinical encounters 
and noted transitions in medication management responsibilities typically occur 
after observing reduced patient capacity. During these transitions, clinicians 
noted they do not routinely provide an overview of their patients' medications 
to caregivers, yet caregivers expressed desire for this. Three cross-cutting 
themes also emerged: (a) balancing patient cognitive impairment limitations and 
retention of patient autonomy is important to all members of the triad; (b) 
historical relationship dynamics inform current clinical encounters and 
medication management; (c) additional time is needed to manage patients with 
multiple conditions and medications.
DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Opportunities exist to utilize a multidisciplinary 
care team to initiate thoughtful early planning for transitions in medication 
management responsibilities and provide supplemental counseling and materials 
that reiterate the value of triadic relationships, and detail patient-medication 
guidance.

Intervention in chronically activated microglia-mediated neuroinflammation is a 
novel approach to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD). The low permeability of the 
blood‒brain barrier (BBB) and non-selective distribution in the brain severely 
restrict AD drugs' disease-modifying efficacy. Here, an immunosuppressant 
TREM2-lowing antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and resveratrol co-loaded 
cationic liposome is developed as an immune reprogramming nanomodulator modified 
by acid-cleavable BBB-targeting peptide and microglia-targeting peptide 
(Res@TcMNP/ASO) for AD management. Res@TcMNP/ASO can enter brain endothelial 
cells via D-T7 peptides. Then D-T7 undergoes an acid-responsive cleavage, 
facilitating the escape of Res@MNP/ASO from endo/lysosomes to cross the BBB. The 
detached Res@MNP/ASO specifically targets M1-phenotype microglia via exposed MG1 
peptides to prompt the simultaneous delivery of two drugs into activated 
microglia. This nanomodulator can not only restore the immune function of 
microglia through TREM2-lowing ASO but also mitigate the immune stimulation to 
microglia caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) through resveratrol, thereby 
synergistically inhibiting the chronic activation of microglia to alleviate 
neuroinflammation in AD. Our results indicate that this combination treatment 
can achieve significant behavioral and cognitive improvements in late APP/PS1 
mice.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that 
progressively affects the cognitive function and memory of the affected person. 
Unfortunately, only a handful of effective prevention or treatment options are 
available today. Microtubule affinity-regulating kinase 4 (MARK4) is a 
serine/threonine protein that plays a critical role in regulating microtubule 
dynamics and facilitating cell division. The dysregulated expression of MARK4 
has been associated with a range of diseases, including AD.
METHODS: In this study, we synthesized a series of N-hetarenes via 
Pd(0)-catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura cross coupling reaction. All compounds were 
characterized using multi-spectroscopic techniques and evaluated for their 
activity against the MARK4 enzyme through ATPase inhibition assays. The 
experimental data was further supported by computational and quantum chemical 
calculations. We also computed the drug-likeness, bioavailability, and toxicity 
(ADME/T) profiles of the compounds.
RESULTS: Six new 4-(6-(arylpyrimidin-4-yl)piperazine-1-carboximidamides 5-10 
were prepared in good yields. ATPase inhibition assay conducted on these 
compounds demonstrated IC50 values in micromolar range (5.35 ± 0.22 to 
16.53 ± 1.71 μM). Among the tested compounds, 
4-(6-(p-tolyl)pyrimidin-4-yl)piperazine-1-carboximidamide (5; IC50 = 5.35 ± 0.22 
μM) and 4-(6-(benzo[b]thiophen-2-yl)pyrimidin-4-yl)piperazine-1-carboximidamide 
(9; IC50 = 6.68 ± 0.80 μM) showed the best activity. The binding constant (K), 
as determined by the fluorescence quenching assay was estimated to be 
1.5 ± 0.51 × 105 M-1 for 5 and 1.14 ± 0.26 × 105 M-1 for 9. The results of 
molecular docking and MD simulation studies against MARK4 (PDB: 5ES1) indicated 
that compounds were able to bind the ATP binding pocket of the MARK4, leading to 
its stabilization. Additionally, ADME/T analysis revealed a high degree of 
drug-likeness of the compounds.
CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that 
4-(6-(arylpyrimidin-4-yl)piperazine-1-carboximidamides) are a promising class of 
N-hetarenes for developing next-generation anti-AD drugs. The reported class of 
compounds inhibited MARK4 activity in-vitro at micromolar concentration by 
targeting the ATP-binding pocket. These findings provide valuable insights for 
future drug design.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD), the leading cause of dementia, remains 
without adequate treatment. Current models do not fully replicate human 
physiology and pathology. The advent of human induced pluripotent stem cell 
(hiPSC) technology offers a novel approach to studying AD.
METHODS: Our study conducted a bibliometric analysis to assess the application 
and development of hiPSC technology in AD research. We retrieved 531 articles on 
hiPSC models of AD from the Web of Science Core Collection, published between 
January 2010 and June 2024. CiteSpace and VOSviewer were used to analyze 
authorship, geographic contributions, journal influence, and citation patterns.
RESULTS: Our findings reveal a steady increase in publications over 14 years, 
with the United States leading in contributions, followed by China. Li-Huei Tsai 
from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is a prominent researcher. PLoS 
One emerges as the most influential journal. Research trends have focused on 
inflammation, astrocytes, microglia, apolipoprotein E (ApoE), and tau.
DISCUSSION: Bibliometric analysis is crucial in identifying research gaps and 
trends and guiding future studies to address unmet needs in understanding and 
modeling human physiology and pathology. Leveraging hiPSC models to investigate 
the molecular mechanisms of familial and sporadic AD is expected to provide a 
crucial foundation for developing future treatment strategies.
CONCLUSION: In summary, the bibliometric findings from this study provide a 
comprehensive overview of the current research landscape in hiPSC models for AD. 
It also highlights emerging trends and research gaps, crucial for guiding future 
research efforts, particularly in exploring novel therapeutic targets and 
improving understanding of disease mechanisms.

Neurodegeneration is a progressive loss of neurons that leads to affected 
cognitive and motor functions and is characterized by neurodegenerative 
disorders (NDs). Human transferrin (Htf) is a blood plasma glycoprotein that 
binds to iron and regulates the free iron in biological fluids. Free iron is a 
potent neurotoxin associated with the generation of Reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) and is ultimately linked to oxidative stress and neuronal damage. Thus, 
targeting iron homeostasis is an attractive strategy for the management of NDs, 
viz. Alzheimer's disease (AD). Tryptamine (Trp) is a naturally occurring 
monoamine, that has demonstrated promising roles in AD therapeutics. The present 
study aims to delineate the binding mechanism of Trp with Htf employing 
computational and spectroscopic approaches. Molecular docking ascertained the 
vital residues governing the Htf-Trp complex formation. Further, Molecular 
dynamic (MD) studies ascertained the structural dynamics and stability of the 
complex, implying that the binding of Trp causes minimal structural alterations 
in Htf, suggestive of the stability of the complex. The results from 
fluorescence spectroscopy demonstrated the binding of Trp with Htf with a 
binding constant (K) of 0.48 × 106 M-1, validating the in silico observations. 
This study provides a platform to understand the binding mechanism that may lead 
to novel therapeutic approaches targeting AD.

Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's 
are on the rise and pose significant challenges due to the lack of effective 
treatments. This review critically examines the neuroprotective effects of 
various natural products derived from plants, marine organisms, and fungi. 
Natural products have long been used in traditional medicine and are gaining 
attention in modern drug discovery for their unique properties. The review 
explains how these natural products can protect neurons by influencing the key 
biological pathways involved in neurodegeneration. It discusses mechanisms 
including antioxidant effects, anti-inflammatory actions, modulation of cellular 
signalling, and support for mitochondrial function. A systematic literature 
search was conducted to minimize bias and ensure rigorous study selection. 
Preclinical studies using animal models and cell cultures show that secondary 
metabolites like polyphenols, alkaloids, and terpenoids can significantly reduce 
neuronal damage. Some clinical trials have shown promising results. However, 
challenges such as bioavailability, standardization, and dosage must be 
addressed to translate these findings into clinical practice. The review also 
evaluates the potential synergy of combining natural products with conventional 
treatments, offering a complementary therapeutic approach. Natural products 
represent a promising avenue for developing innovative treatments for 
neurodegenerative diseases. The review highlights key research gaps and proposes 
future directions. Future studies should focus on overcoming existing challenges 
and refining these natural products to improve their efficacy and safety in 
clinical settings. The application of existing knowledge has the potential to 
significantly enhance the quality of life for individuals affected by 
neurodegenerative diseases.

BACKGROUND: Thiamine deficiency mimics the features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
like cognitive impairment, amyloid and tau deposition. There is growing evidence 
that links AD with aluminium. The study aims to explore the effect of 
benfotiamine (BFT), a lipid soluble thiamine derivative, on aluminium induced AD 
rat model.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All the rats except control group were administered AlCl3 
for one month to induce dementia. Positive control group received donepezil; BFT 
groups received 50 and 300 mg/kg b.w. /day for last 15 days. Morris water maze 
test was performed to assess learning and memory. Histological changes were 
studied in C3 region of hippocampus. Acetylcholine esterase (AChE), 
malondialdehyde, reduced glutathione, nitric oxide, hyperphosphorylated tau 
proteins and caspase 8 were estimated in brain homogenate.
RESULTS: AlCl3 impaired learning and memory significantly and increased AChE, 
caspase 8, tau proteins. The decrease in NO level was highly significant 
(p<0.001) in BFT treated rats compared to control. Lower dose of BFT had 
profound influence on augmenting GSH levels (p=0.012). Further, higher dose of 
BFT improved learning and memory significantly in AD model (p=0.009) and was 
more effective in preventing taupathy, apoptosis and neuronal damage by acting 
as a potent antioxidant.
CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that oral supplementation of 300mg /kg b.w. /day 
of BFT may reverse AD pathological processes and improve dementia. However, the 
need of thiamine supplementation in elderly persons to delay or halt the 
cognitive loss and eventual dementia needs validation by clinical trial.

BACKGROUND: Personalized repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of 
the precuneus (PC) is emerging as a new non-invasive therapeutic approach in 
treating Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we sought to investigate the effects of 
52 weeks of rTMS applied over the PC on cognitive functions in patients with 
mild-to-moderate dementia due to AD.
METHODS: Forty-eight patients with mild-to-moderate dementia due to AD were 
enrolled for the study. Of those 31 patients were extended to 52 weeks after 
being included in a 24-week trial (NCT03778151) with the same experimental 
design. The trial included a 52-week treatment with a 2-week intensive course 
where rTMS (or sham) was applied over the PC daily (5 times per week, Monday to 
Friday), followed by a 50-week maintenance phase in which the same stimulation 
was applied once weekly. Personalization of rTMS treatment was established using 
neuronavigated TMS in combination with electroencephalography (TMS-EEG). The 
primary outcome measure was change from baseline to week 52 of the Clinical 
Dementia Rating Scale-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB). Secondary outcomes included score 
changes in the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale- Cognitive Subscale 
(ADAS-Cog)11, Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Alzheimer's Disease 
Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living scale (ADCS-ADL) and 
Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Changes in cortical activity and connectivity 
were monitored by TMS-EEG.
RESULTS: Among 48 patients randomized (mean age 72.8 years; 56% women), 32 (68%) 
completed the study. Repetitive TMS of the PC (PC-rTMS) had a significant effect 
on the primary outcome measure. The estimated mean change in CDR-SB after 52 
week was 1.36 for PC-rTMS (95% confidence interval (CI) [0.68, 2.04]) and 2.45 
for sham-rTMS group (95%CI [1.85, 3.05]). There were also significant effects 
for the secondary outcomes ADAS-Cog11, ADCS-ADL and NPI scores. Stronger DMN 
connectivity at baseline was associated with favorable response to rTMS 
treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Fifty-two weeks of PC-rTMS may slow down the impairment of 
cognitive functions, activities of daily living and behavioral disturbances in 
patients with mild-to-moderate AD. Further multicenter studies are needed to 
confirm the clinical potential of DMN personalized rTMS.

Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease 
are increasing globally and represent a significant cause of age-related death 
in the population. Recent studies emphasize the strong association between 
environmental stressors, particularly dietary factors, and brain health and 
neurodegeneration unsatisfactory outcomes. Despite ongoing efforts, the 
efficiency of current treatments for NDDs remains wanting. Considering this, 
nootropic foods with neuroprotective effects are of high interest as part of a 
possible long-term therapeutic strategy to improve brain health and alleviate 
NDDs. However, since it is a new and emerging area in food and neuroscience, 
there is limited information on mechanisms and challenges to consider for this 
to be a successful intervention. Here, we seek to address these gaps by 
presenting a comprehensive review of possible pathways or mechanisms including 
mutual interactions governing nootropic food metabolism, linkages of the 
pathways with NDDs, intake, and neuroprotective properties of nootropic foods. 
We also discuss in-depth intervention with nootropic compounds and dietary 
patterns in NDDs, providing a detailed exploration of their mechanisms of 
action. Additionally, we analyze the demand, challenges, and future directions 
for successful development of nootropic foods targeting NDDs.

Loneliness is a neuropsychiatric symptom that has been associated with cognitive 
impairment and dementia. We aimed to investigate whether depressive 
symptomatology and biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cerebrovascular 
disease (CVD) are associated with loneliness. Secondly, we aimed to investigate 
whether loneliness, depressive symptomatology, and biomarkers of AD and CVD are 
associated with subjective cognitive decline (SCD). We included 215 cognitively 
unimpaired participants (70 y/o) with cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, magnetic 
resonance imaging, and questionnaires for loneliness, depressive symptomatology, 
and SCD. For aim 1, our findings showed that CVD and depressive symptomatology 
were the most relevant measures to discriminate people with loneliness. For aim 
2, a random forest classification model showed that loneliness contributed to 
discriminate individuals with SCD, but logistic regression showed that its 
partial predictive effect was non-significant when depressive symptomatology and 
AD biomarkers were included in the models. We conclude that loneliness is 
associated with SCD, CVD, and depressive symptomatology. Given the complex 
interplay between loneliness, depressive symptomatology, and SCD, more research 
is needed to fully clarify the unique role of each neuropsychiatric symptom in 
relation to biomarkers of brain pathology.

A comprehensive, patient-centered conceptual model of early Parkinson's is 
lacking and is greatly needed. A systematic review and meta-synthesis of 
qualitative and quantitative research was conducted by a multi-stakeholder 
taskforce using JBI Mixed Methods Review criteria and GRADE-CERQual standards 
for assessment of evidence. Over 340 symptoms and impacts were identified across 
ten symptom domains (Movement, Cognitive, Psychiatric, Sleep, Sensory, Speech, 
Digestive, Urinary, Sexual, Autonomic) and two impact domains (Physical and 
Psychosocial functioning). A wide range of motor and non-motor symptoms were 
present in early disease, with strongest support for tremor, dexterity, gait, 
stiffness, slow movements, cognitive, mood, and sleep alterations, urinary 
dysfunction, constipation, pain, and fatigue. These affected mobility, 
self-concept, coping, effort of living, interactions and important activities, 
with evidence of many understudied concepts. This model offers the most 
comprehensive catalogue of symptoms and impacts in Parkinson's to date and will 
support clinical practice and endpoint selection for therapeutic trials.

The reduction of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is associated with 
Alzheimer's disease and depression. Senescence-accelerated mouse prone 10 
(SAMP10), a rapid aging animal model, exhibits age-related cognitive deficits 
and depression-like behavior; however, it is unclear the variation of serum BDNF 
levels. Here, we showed that serum BDNF levels in SAMP10 were lower than those 
in the normal aging characteristics mouse SAM-resistant 1 (SAMR1), and 
Hochuekkito suppressed the decline of serum BDNF levels in SAMP10. These results 
suggest that SAMP10 may be used as an animal model in decreasing serum BDNF 
levels and Hochuekkito could prevent the age-related BDNF decline.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition that 
creates a significant global health challenge and profoundly affects patients 
and their families. Recent research has highlighted the critical role of 
microorganisms, particularly viral infections, in the pathogenesis of AD. The 
involvement of viral infections in AD pathogenesis is predominantly attributed 
to their ability to induce neuroinflammation and amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition in 
the brain. The extant research exploring the relationship between viruses and AD 
has focused largely on Herpesviridae family. Traces of Herpesviruses, such as 
Herpes Simplex Virus-1 and Epstein Barr Virus, have been found in the brains of 
patients with AD. These viruses are thought to contribute to the disease 
progression by triggering chronic inflammatory responses in the brain. They can 
remain dormant in the brain, and become reactivated due to stress, a secondary 
viral infection, or immune-senescence in older adults. This review focuses on 
the association between Herpesviridae and bacterial infections with AD. We 
explore the genetic factors that might regulate viral illness and discuss 
clinical trials investigating antiviral and anti-inflammatory agents as possible 
therapeutic strategies to mitigate cognitive decline in patients with AD. In 
summary, understanding the interplay between infections, genetic factors, and AD 
pathogenesis may pave the way for novel therapeutic approaches, facilitating 
better management and possibly even prevent this debilitating disease.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia worldwide. 
With aging populations and limited access to effective treatments, there is an 
urgent need for innovative markers to support timely preventive interventions. 
Emerging evidence highlights spatial cognition (SC) as a valuable source of 
cognitive markers for AD. This study presents NavegApp, a serious game (SG) 
designed to assess 3 key components of SC, which show potential as cognitive 
markers for the early detection of AD.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the content validity and usability 
perception of NavegApp across multiple groups of interest.
METHODS: A multistep process integrating methodologies from software 
engineering, psychometrics, and health measurement was implemented to validate 
the software. Our approach was structured into 3 stages, guided by the software 
life cycle for health and the Consensus-Based Standards for the Selection of 
Health Status Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) recommendations for evaluating 
the psychometric quality of health instruments. To assess content validity, a 
panel of 8 experts evaluated the relevance and representativeness of tasks 
included in the app. In addition, 212 participants, categorized into 5 groups 
based on their clinical status and risk level for AD, were recruited to evaluate 
the app's digital ergonomics and usability at various stages of development. 
Complementary analyses were performed to identify group differences and to 
explore the association between task difficulty and user agreeableness.
RESULTS: NavegApp was validated as a highly usable tool by both experts and 
users. The expert panel confirmed that the tasks included in the game were 
representative (Aiken V=0.96-1.00) and relevant (Aiken V=0.96-1.00) for 
measuring SC components. Both experts and nonexperts rated NavegApp's digital 
ergonomics positively, with minimal differences between groups (rrb 0.08-0.29). 
Differences in usability perceptions were observed among participants with 
sporadic mild cognitive impairment compared to cognitively healthy individuals 
(rrb 0.26-0.29). A moderate association was also identified between task 
difficulty and user agreeableness (Cramér V=0.37, 95% CI 0.28-0.54).
CONCLUSIONS: NavegApp is a valid and user-friendly SG designed for SC 
assessment, developed by integrating software engineering and psychometric 
evaluation methodologies. While the results are promising, further studies are 
warranted to evaluate its diagnostic accuracy and construct validity. This work 
outlines a comprehensive framework for SG development in cognitive assessment, 
emphasizing the importance of incorporating psychometric validity measures from 
the outset of the design process.

Amyloid β peptide (Aβ) aggregation in the brain represents an initial 
detrimental episode in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently, it 
has been discovered that inhibiting Aβ neurotoxicity by modulating highly toxic 
Aβ oligomers (AβOs) is more rewarding than reducing the overall amyloid fibril 
production. In line with this, here, we discussed the efficiency of 
multifunctional quinazolinone and vanillin acrylamide hybrids (QVA1-5) as 
modulators of aggregation behavior. The thioflavin T (ThT) assay inferred 
dose-dependent intensification of Aβ1-42 aggregation by QVA1-5, which may be due 
to the coassembly of hybrids with AβOs. Field emission-scanning electron 
microscopy (FE-SEM) disclosed enormously distinctive differences among the 
aggregate morphologies of Aβ1-42 and Aβ1-42+ QVA1-5, which intensely reinforced 
the modulatory action of QVA1-5 on the molecular assembly of the Aβ1-42 peptide. 
Supportingly, the Alamar Blue assay proved QVA1-5 as an effective neuroprotector 
in the SH-SY5Y cell line against Aβ1-42-induced toxicity. Consistent with these 
findings, western blot data showed an increased number of Aβ1-42 fibrils in 
SH-SY5Y cells treated with QVA1-5. In our molecular docking approach, all 
ligands had identical binding positions at sites 4-6 of the Aβ fibril structure 
(PDB ID: 2M4J). In the interaction pattern, ligands spanned across five Aβ 
monomers that were stacked together and stabilized the fibril formation by 
hydrophobic interactions with the Aβ monomer residues as well as neighboring 
ligands. In the molecular dynamics simulations, the lower RMSD and similar rGyr 
values for the ligands further supported the stability of the ligands inside the 
binding pocket of the 2M4J Aβ fibril. Overall, the present study provided a 
mechanistic explanation at the atomic level for the impact of small molecules 
(QVA1-5) on Aβ fibril stabilization for the first time. Hence, we strongly 
believe that these findings will be a resource for the development of imminent 
drug candidates against AD that can manipulate Aβ aggregate formation.

GABAergic neurotransmission within the cortex plays a key role in learning and 
is altered in several brain diseases. Quantification of bulk GABA in the human 
brain is typically obtained by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). However, 
the interpretation of MRS-GABA is still debated. A recent mathematical 
simulation contends that MRS detects extrasynaptic GABA, mediating tonic 
inhibition. Nevertheless, no empirical data have yet confirmed this hypothesis. 
Here we collected ultra-high-field 7 Tesla MRS and transcranial magnetic 
stimulation coupled with high-density electroencephalography (TMS-hdEEG) from 
the motor cortex of 20 healthy participants (age 23.95 ± 6.4 years), while they 
were at rest. We first applied a neural mass model (NMM) to TMS-evoked 
potentials to disentangle the contribution of different GABAergic pools. We then 
assessed to which of these different pools MRS-GABA was related to by means of 
parametric empirical Bayesian (PEB) analysis. We found that MRS-GABA was mostly 
positively related to the NMM-derived measures of tonic inhibition and overall 
functionality of the GABAergic synapse. This relationship was reliable enough to 
predict MRS-GABA from NMM-GABA. These findings clarify the mesoscopic 
underpinnings of GABA levels measured by MRS. Our work will help fulfil the 
promises of MRS-GABA, enhancing our understanding of human behaviour, brain 
physiology and pathophysiology. KEY POINTS: GABA neurotransmission is essential 
for synaptic plasticity and learning (especially motor learning) and is altered 
in several brain disorders, such as epilepsy and stroke. Quantification of GABA 
in the human brain is typically obtained by magnetic resonance spectroscopy 
(MRS). However, the interpretation of MRS-GABA is still debated. By using a 
biophysical neural mass model, here we show that MRS-GABA relates to 
physiological measures of tonic inhibition in the human cortex.

PURPOSE: The beneficial effects of a ketogenic diet (KD) on neurodegenerative 
conditions such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
are increasingly acknowledged, with potential implications for the general 
population as well. Thus, our study aimed to explore the effect of a KD on 
cerebral blood flow (CBF) and Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) in 
healthy individuals. We hypothesized that a KD would increase CBF and BDNF, 
thereby presenting itself as an approach to prevent cognitive decline.
METHODS: In total, 11 cognitively healthy individuals with overweight 
participated in a randomized, crossover trial consisting of two three-week 
interventions: 1) a KD and 2) a standard diet. Each diet period concluded with a 
positron emission tomography (PET) study day, accompanied by a separate magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Blood samples were collected prior to the PET scan 
to measure β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB) and BDNF levels. CBF was assessed using a 
[15O]H2O PET scan co-registered with an MRI scan.
RESULTS: A KD led to increased basal plasma β-OHB levels compared to the SDD 
(647 (418-724) vs. 50 (50-60) μmol/l, p<0.05), increased CBF by 22% (p=0.02), 
and elevated BDNF levels by 47% (p=0.04). Moreover, a correlation was observed 
between β-OHB levels and CBF measurements across the two diets (R2=0.54, 
p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: Implementing a KD improved CBF and raised BDNF levels in cognitively 
healthy individuals, indicating that a KD should be assessed for as a potential 
treatment for conditions associated with reduced CBF.

INTRODUCTION: Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an incretin hormone that 
modulates glucose metabolism and insulin secretion. Recent translational and 
clinical research has evaluated the effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 
RAs), a class of drugs that mimic the action of native GLP-1 in the central 
nervous system (CNS). In addition to the efficacy of GLP-1 for the treatment of 
diabetes mellitus and obesity, preliminary evidence indicates GLP-1s have 
neuroprotective, therapeutic, and disease modification effects for 
select neurodegenerative disorders (e.g. Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's 
disease). Among the available GLP-1 RAs, relatively few have been shown to 
be CNS penetrant. This article synthesizes extant literature reporting on CNS 
penetrants of GLP-1 RAs as proxied by brain imaging studies. Where available, 
studies that reported on the bioavailability of GLP-1 RAs in the CNS were 
identified.
METHODS: A comprehensive search of PubMed, Ovid, and Web of Science from 
database inception to July 2024 was conducted. Inclusion criteria were English 
language publications with no date restrictions, preclinical and clinical 
studies with participants aged 18-80 and studies which focused on GLP-1 RAs 
including: "Semaglutide" or "Ozempic" or "Rybelsus" or "Wegovy" or "Dulaglutide" 
or "Trulicity" or "Exenatide" or "Byetta" or "Bydureon" or "Liraglutide" or 
"Lixisenatide" or "Tirzepatide" or "Mounjaro" or "Zepbound" or "Bydureon BCise" 
or "Adlyxin" or "Victoza" or "Saxenda".
RESULTS: We identified 14 studies that were included in this synthesis. 
Preclinical studies suggest that select GLP-1 RAs cross the blood-brain barrier 
(BBB) (i.e. liraglutide, semaglutide, and exenatide). Replicated evidence 
suggests that CNS penetration of GLP-1 RAs can be proxied by reported effects of 
GLP-1 RAs on brain connectivity in human participants.
CONCLUSION:  Preclinical studies indicate that select GLP-1 RAs are CNS 
penetrant; whether GLP-1 RAs reproducibly engage neural targets hypothesized to 
subserve dimensions of psychopathology (e.g., general cognitive functions) 
remains incompletely characterized.

BACKGROUND: The diagnostic value of midbrain atrophy for distinguishing 
behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) from progressive supranuclear 
palsy (PSP) is unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether measures of midbrain atrophy differentiate PSP 
from bvFTD.
METHODS: We included four groups: healthy controls (n = 19), PSP-Richardson 
syndrome (n = 20), bvFTD (n = 19) and Parkinson's disease (PD; n = 12). The 
following quantitative and qualitative measures were calculated: Hummingbird 
sign rating scale [HBS-RS], global midbrain atrophy [GMA], midbrain area, 
midbrain/pons ratio, the Magnetic Resonance Parkinsonism Index (MRPI), the MRPI 
2.0 and brainstem volume.
RESULTS: Compared to controls, PSP and bvFTD had lower values of midbrain area, 
HBS-RS and GMA, and higher MRPI and MRPI 2.0. HBS-RS, GMA, midbrain/pons ratio, 
midbrain area, MRPI, MRPI 2.0 and brainstem volume distinguished PSP from bvFTD 
with 73%, 67%, 75%, 83%, 71%, 69% and 82% accuracies, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Both quantitative and qualitative measures of midbrain atrophy 
provided modest accuracy in distinguishing PSP from bvFTD.

INTRODUCTION: TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 6 (NCT05738486) is a multicenter, double-blind, 
ongoing phase 3b study in early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease.
METHODS: Participants (n = 843) were randomized 1:1:1:1 (standard + three 
alternative donanemab dosing arms). Primary outcome was relative risk reduction 
(RRR) of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities with edema/effusions (ARIA-E) at 
24 weeks assessed with Bayesian logistic regression. Amyloid plaque levels by 
positron emission tomography and serum donanemab pharmacokinetics were measured.
RESULTS: ARIA-E frequencies for standard, modified titration, dose skipping, and 
Cmax arms were 23.7%, 13.7%, 18.6%, and 18.3%, respectively, at 24 weeks and 
similar at 52 weeks: 24.2%, 15.6%, 18.6%, and 18.8%, respectively. Modified 
titration met the 24-week primary outcome with 94% probability of achieving ≥ 
20% RRR versus the standard arm. Modified titration also had significantly lower 
ARIA-E severity, but similar cumulative exposure and mean amyloid reduction 
compared to the standard arm.
DISCUSSION: Gradual up-titration of dose significantly reduced ARIA-E risk while 
demonstrating comparable pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics compared to standard 
dosing.
HIGHLIGHTS: In TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 6, the amyloid-related imaging 
abnormalities-edema/effusions (ARIA-E) frequency was 13.7% in the modified 
titration arm compared to 23.7% in the standard arm at week 24. The modified 
titration arm met the primary endpoint of ARIA-E relative risk reduction at 24 
weeks versus the standard arm. The modified titration versus standard arm at 
week 24 had comparable non-ARIA-E related safety profile, amyloid reduction, 
plasma phosphorylated tau217 reduction, cumulative exposure, and 
pharmacokinetics. Data at week 52 were consistent with week 24 results.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder with an unclear 
pathogenesis; the traditional ″single gene-single target-single drug″ strategy 
is insufficient for effective treatment. This study explores a novel strategy 
for the multitarget therapy of AD by integrating multiomics data and employing 
network analysis. Different from conventional single-target methods, TCnet 
adopts a mechanism-driven strategy, utilizing multiomics data to decompose 
disease mechanisms, construct potential target combinations, and prioritize the 
optimal combinations using a scoring function. TCnet not only advances our 
understanding of disease mechanisms but also facilitates large-scale drug 
screening. This approach was further employed to screen active compounds from 
Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Tang (HLJDT), identifying quercetin as a candidate targeting 
GSK3β and ADAM17. Subsequent in vitro experiments confirmed the neuroprotective 
and anti-inflammatory effects of quercetin. Overall, TCnet offers a promising 
approach for predicting target combinations and provides new insights and 
directions for drug discovery in AD.

Central nervous system (CNS) disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and migraines, rank among the 
most prevalent and concerning conditions worldwide. Despite ongoing research, 
the pathophysiology of these disorders remains incompletely understood, 
primarily due to their complex etiology. Current pharmacological treatments 
mainly focus on alleviating symptoms rather than addressing the underlying 
causes of these diseases. CNS disorders are marked by impairments in 
neurocognitive and neuromuscular functions, and cognitive processes like 
learning and memory. This deterioration not only impacts the quality of life of 
affected individuals but also places a significant burden on their families. 
Neuroplasticity is a key property of the nervous system that enables brain 
repair and functional recovery. However, in CNS disorders, neuroplasticity is 
often compromised. Neuroplasticity, which is regulated by gene expression, is 
also modulated by environmental factors and epigenetic mechanisms, thereby 
reshaping neuronal networks in response to various biological and environmental 
stimuli and brain function. Importantly, neuroplasticity plays a critical role 
in repairing the brain, especially in the context of neurodegenerative diseases, 
where damaged neurons can reorganize and re-establish lost functions. Targeting 
neuroplasticity mechanisms holds significant potential for developing 
therapeutic interventions to improve treatment outcomes and prevent CNS 
disorders. A deeper understanding of neuroplasticity in neurological diseases 
could open new avenues for enhancing patient quality of life. This review aims 
to provide a comprehensive overview of synaptic function and the neuroplasticity 
mechanisms that are disrupted in neurological disorders.

Oddi et al. report the effects of chronic treatment via intranasal delivery with 
URB597, a fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitor, on an Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) transgenic mouse model. They found that prolonged treatment with URB597 
reduced the learning and memory deficits of these mice. Mechanistically, the 
inhibitor modified several genes related to amyloidosis and inflammatory 
responses or anandamide signaling. FAAH inhibition induced a decrease in the 
accumulation, synthesis, and release of β-Amyloid, along with diminished 
expression of β-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), and 
this change may be associated with epigenetic changes induced by the drug. In 
summary, prolonged treatment with URB597 impinges on different aspects of AD 
pathophysiology, suggesting its therapeutic relevance in treating AD.

The pilot phase of the Greek Interventional Geriatric Initiative to Prevent 
Cognitive Impairment and Disability (GINGER) aims to assess the feasibility of a 
multi-level dementia risk reduction intervention in individuals with subjective 
cognitive decline (SCD) over a six-month period. The study design incorporates a 
comprehensive set of trans-disciplinary assessments and interventions in 
multiple centers across Greece. Individuals 55 years or older with subjective 
cognitive complaints who do not fulfill criteria for either mild cognitive 
impairment or dementia are screened for dementia risk factors in the following 
domains: nutrition, physical activities, vision and hearing, vascular and 
metabolic parameters, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and insomnia. All GINGER 
participants receive a cognitive empowerment intervention. Using a precision 
medicine approach, they receive up to three additional domain-specific 
interventions based on their individual risk factor profiles. Changes in 
cognition, dementia risk factors, quality of life and other measures compared to 
baseline are assessed at three- and six months after the initiation of the 
intervention. The GINGER protocol was designed and is run by a 
multi-disciplinary team of dieticians, neurologists, psychiatrists, 
psychologists, and physiotherapists, while computer scientists oversee data 
management. The objectives of this pilot phase are (i) evaluation of the 
protocol's feasibility, (ii) assessment of intervention effects on the 
individual risk domains targeted by the interventions, (iii) estimation of the 
overall effects of the intervention on cognitive function, dementia risk and 
quality of life. The GINGER findings will provide a solid foundation for paving 
the way towards a network of evidence-based brain health clinics in Greece.

Neurological disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease) and 
mental disorders (e.g., depression and anxiety), pose huge challenges to global 
public health. The pathogenesis of these diseases can usually be attributed to 
many factors, such as genetic, environmental and socioeconomic status, which 
make the diagnosis and treatment of the diseases difficult. As research on the 
diseases advances, so does the body of medical data. The accumulation of such 
data provides unique opportunities for the basic and clinical study of these 
diseases, but the vast and diverse nature of the data also make it difficult for 
physicians and researchers to precisely extract the information and utilize it 
in their work. A powerful tool to extract the necessary knowledge from large 
amounts of data is knowledge graph (KG). KG, as an organized form of 
information, has great potential for the study neurological and mental disorders 
when it is paired with big data and deep learning technologies. In this study, 
we reviewed the application of KGs in common neurological and mental disorders 
in recent years. We also discussed the current state of medical knowledge 
graphs, highlighting the obstacles and constraints that still need to be 
overcome.

University, Nanning, Guangxi, China.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease poses a major public health challenge, with 
aducanumab's approval in 2021 as the first disease-modifying therapy raising 
important safety considerations. This study analyzed the Food Drug 
Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database to evaluate 
aducanumab's real-world safety profile and identify potential risk factors.
METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive pharmacovigilance study using the FAERS 
database from January 2004 to June 2024, analyzing 510 aducanumab-associated 
reports from integrated databases containing over 18 million demographic records 
and 66 million drug records. Safety signals were evaluated using four 
complementary disproportionality methods: Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR), 
Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural 
Network (BCPNN), and Multi-item Gamma Poisson Shrinker (MGPS). Analyses were 
stratified by age and sex, with adverse events examined at both System Organ 
Class (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT) levels using SAS 9.4.
RESULTS: Among 510 aducanumab-associated adverse event reports, predominantly 
from elderly patients (55.49% aged ≥65 years), nervous system disorders were the 
most frequent (53.24%, n = 583). Amyloid related imaging 
abnormality-oedema/effusion (ARIA-E) and Amyloid related imaging 
abnormality-microhaemorrhages and haemosiderin deposits (ARIA-H) emerged as the 
most significant safety signals (ROR: 53,538.3 and 38,187.9, respectively). 
Sex-stratified analysis showed comparable safety profiles between males and 
females, with ARIA-E related events, ARIA-H related events, maintaining strong 
signals across all age groups, particularly in patients ≥75 years. The median 
time to adverse event onset was 146.0 days (IQR: 80.0-195.0). Temporal analysis 
revealed increasing signal strength for ARIA-related events from 2004-2024, with 
notable intensification during 2022-2023.
CONCLUSION: Our real-world analysis identified ARIA-related events as the 
primary safety concern for aducanumab, typically occurring within 146 days of 
treatment initiation, with comparable safety profiles across sex but heightened 
risks in patients ≥75 years. These findings support aducanumab's viability as a 
therapeutic option while emphasizing the critical importance of rigorous 
monitoring protocols, particularly for ARIA events during the first year of 
treatment.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a 
progressive onset of symptoms, including memory loss, accompanied by other 
neurological impairments. This progression is attributed to the deterioration of 
neuronal connections and a decrease in neurotransmission. Although this 
phenomenon has been extensively studied in the cholinergic system, it also 
affects other neurobiological pathways, particularly adrenergic transmission. In 
this context, the use of agonists, in particular, β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) 
agonists, may represent a promising therapeutic approach. After reviewing the 
main pharmacological aspects related to these receptors, we will first present 
the different existing modulators and their peripheral effects. We will then 
analyze the results of studies investigating their use in disease models. 
Finally, we will discuss the conditions and prospects for the development of a 
new treatment for Alzheimer's disease using a β2AR agonist.

BackgroundEarly intervention for subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is becoming 
increasingly important to prevent progression to Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Despite the promising results observed in animal models of AD, the 
neuroprotective and cognitive-enhancing effects of Dendropanax morbiferus (DM) 
still need to be evaluated in individuals with cognitive decline.ObjectiveThis 
12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial assessed the effects 
of DM leaf extracts on cognitive function in 85 individuals with SCD 
(KCT0006329, registered on July 7, 2021).MethodsParticipants were randomly 
assigned to either the DM (n = 43) or the placebo (n = 42) group. Cognitive 
functions, including attention and memory, were assessed at baseline, 8 weeks, 
and 12 weeks. High-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging was 
performed at the beginning and end of the study to evaluate cortical thickness. 
Changes in cognition and cortical thickness and their associations were 
evaluated.ResultsThe results demonstrated significant improvements in attention 
(p = 0.014), memory (p = 0.037), and global cognitive function (p = 0.001) in 
the DM group compared to the placebo group, accompanied by increased cortical 
thickness in the left lingual gyrus/cuneus (corrected p < 0.05). Furthermore, in 
the DM group, increased cortical thickness in this region was correlated with 
both memory (r = 0.422, p = 0.016) and global cognitive functions (r = 0.471, 
p = 0.007). DM was well-tolerated, with no adverse events 
reported.ConclusionsThese findings suggest that DM may possess 
cognitive-enhancing properties for individuals with SCD.

AIM: This study investigated knowledge and attitude towards Alzheimer's disease 
among nurses in China.
DESIGN: A cross-sectional design.
METHODS: A total of 186 nurses were recruited in Wuxi, China from January to 
March 2024. The Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Scale and Dementia Attitudes Scale 
were used to evaluate nurses' knowledge and attitudes towards Alzheimer's 
disease. Descriptive statistics, univariate analysis and multivariate linear 
regression analysis were utilised to evaluate the levels and influencing factors 
of their knowledge and attitudes towards Alzheimer's disease.
RESULTS: The participants' average the Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Scale and 
Dementia Attitudes Scale scores were 20.82 ± 2.31 (approximately 69.4% 
correctly) and 86.23 ± 14.14 (approximately 61.6%), respectively. Professional 
titles and whether or not they had received previous training about Alzheimer's 
Disease were among the factors affecting their dementia knowledge. Education 
background and workplace were the influencing factors of nurses' attitude 
towards dementia.
CONCLUSION: Nursing personnel in the Wuxi region demonstrate a limited 
understanding of Alzheimer's disease, coupled with positive attitudes towards 
its care. It is imperative to implement effective strategies to enhance 
in-service training for nurses regarding dementia. This initiative aims to 
elevate their level of knowledge, improve their attitudes towards dementia care, 
and ultimately enhance the quality of nursing provided to individuals with 
dementia.

BackgroundPrevious studies with limited sample sizes have indicated a link 
between mitochondrial traits, inflammatory proteins, and Alzheimer's disease. 
The exact causality and their mediation relationships remain 
unclear.ObjectiveOur study aimed to delve into the genetic underpinnings of 
mitochondrial function and circulating inflammatory proteins in the pathogenesis 
of Alzheimer's disease.MethodsWe leveraged aggregated data from the largest 
genome-wide association study, including 69 mitochondrial traits, 91 circulating 
inflammatory proteins, and Alzheimer's disease. Bidirectional mendelian 
randomization (MR) analyses were performed to investigate their primary causal 
relationships. Thereafter a two-step MR mediation analysis was utilized to 
clarify the modulating effects of inflammatory proteins on mitochondria and 
Alzheimer's disease.ResultsOur study identified mitochondrial phenylalanine-tRNA 
ligase and 4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate aldolase as risk factors for Alzheimer's 
disease, and serine protease HtrA2 and carbonic anhydrase 5A as protective 
factors against Alzheimer's disease. Four inflammatory proteins (T-cell surface 
glycoprotein CD5, C-X-C motif chemokine 11, TGF-α, and TNF-related 
apoptosis-inducing ligand) played protective roles against Alzheimer's disease. 
Axin-1 and IL-6 increased the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, T-cell 
surface glycoprotein CD5 was found to be a significant mediator between 
mitochondrial serine protease HTRA2 and Alzheimer's disease with the two-step MR 
method, accounting for 10.83% of the total effect.ConclusionsOur study 
emphasized mitochondrial HtrA2-T cell CD5 as a negative axis in Alzheimer's 
disease, offering novel perspectives on its etiology, pathogenesis, and 
treatment.

BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), prevalent among older adults, often 
precedes Alzheimer's disease (AD) or Alzheimer's disease-related dementias 
(ADRD), emphasizing the need for effective interventions. Early intervention in 
MCI is crucial, not only to alleviate symptoms but to potentially delay the 
progression of cognitive decline. The lack of definitive treatments for MCI has 
prompted the exploration into alternative non-pharmacological therapeutic 
approaches. Specifically, noninvasive brain stimulation using repetitive 
transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has demonstrated promise in improving 
cognition in MCI and AD.
OBJECTIVES: Our study will test the feasibility of using intermittent theta 
burst stimulation (iTBS) technique of rTMS in MCI, pilot test the study design, 
and collect pilot data on the effect of iTBS over three different brain regions 
on working memory, new learning, and executive function in MCI. Exploratory 
objectives are to assess the feasibility and usefulness of functional magnetic 
resonance imaging (fMRI), high-density electroencephalography (HD-EEG), and 
sleep architecture as potential biomarkers in response to iTBS.
METHODS: A pilot randomized double-blind controlled cross-over trial of iTBS on 
20 MCI participants randomized to 10 days of active iTBS (left dorsolateral 
prefrontal cortex or left lateral parietal cortex) or control (vertex). After 
4-6-week washout period, they cross over to the alternative treatment arm for 
another 10 days. Each participant will undergo a total of 20 iTBS sessions. Pre- 
and post-iTBS assessments include neuropsychological tests, fMRI, HD-EEG, and 
sleep architecture.
DISCUSSION: This innovative study aims to test the feasibility of iTBS as a 
cognitive enhancement strategy in MCI. If our study is feasible, it could lead 
to a future larger trial to further test whether iTBS can modulate underlying 
neurobiology and offer a therapeutic avenue to remediate cognitive decline in 
MCI or ultimately delay progression to dementia.

BACKGROUND: Nanocarriers targeting the blood-brain barrier (BBB) are promising 
drug delivery systems to enhance the penetration of therapeutic molecules into 
the brain. Immunotherapy, particularly monoclonal antibodies designed to bind 
amyloid-beta peptides have become a promising strategy for Alzheimer's disease, 
but ensuring efficacy and safety is challenging and crucial for these therapies. 
Our aim was to develop an innovative nanocarriers conjugated with PepH3, a 
cationic peptide derived from Dengue virus type-2 capsid protein that crosses 
the BBB and acts as a shuttle peptide for the encapsulated single domain 
antibody (sdAb) recognizing Aβ oligomers.
RESULTS: PepH3 peptide enhanced the uptake of the nanoparticles (NPs) into brain 
endothelial cells, and transcytosis of sdAb, as a potential therapeutic 
molecule, across both rat and human BBB culture models. The cargo uptake was a 
temperature dependent active process that was reduced by metabolic and 
endocytosis inhibitors. The cellular uptake of the cationic PepH3-tagged NPs 
decreased when the negative surface charge of brain endothelial cells became 
more positive after treatments with a cationic lipid or with neuraminidase by 
digesting the glycocalyx. The NPs colocalized mostly with endoplasmic reticulum 
and Golgi apparatus and not with lysosomes, indicating the cargo may avoid 
cellular degradation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results support that combination of NPs with a potential brain 
shuttle peptide such as PepH3 peptide can improve the delivery of antibody 
fragments across the BBB.

BACKGROUND: The link between low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels 
and dementia risk is poorly understood, with conflicting evidence on the role of 
LDL-C and the impact of statin therapy on cognitive outcomes. Thus, we aimed to 
examine the association between low-density LDL-C levels and the risk of 
dementia and assess the influence of statin therapy.
METHODS: We retrospectively analysed data from 11 university hospitals 
participating in the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common 
Data Model (CDM). Participants with a prior diagnosis of dementia or those with 
<180 days of observation before cohort inclusion, and those included in both 
cohorts were excluded. The primary outcome was all-cause dementia, with the 
secondary outcome being Alzheimer's disease-related dementia (ADRD). The study 
utilised 1:1 propensity score matching to compare individuals with LDL-C levels 
below 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) against those with levels above 130 mg/dL (3.4 
mmol/L), resulting in a primary analysis cohort of 108 980 matched patients. 
Secondary analyses further examined LDL-C thresholds below 55 mg/dL (1.4 mmol/L) 
and the influence of statin use.
RESULTS: The LDL-C levels below 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) were associated with a 26% 
reduction in the risk of all-cause dementia and a 28% reduction in the risk of 
ADRD, compared with levels above 130 mg/dL (3.4 mmol/L). For LDL-C levels below 
55 mg/dL (1.4 mmol/L), there was an 18% risk reduction for both outcomes. Among 
those with LDL-C <70 mg/dL (<1.8 mmol/L), statin use was associated with a 13% 
reduction in all-cause dementia risk and a 12% decrease in ADRD risk compared 
with non-users.
CONCLUSION: Low LDL-C levels (<70 mg/dL (<1.8 mmol/L)) are significantly 
associated with a reduced risk of dementia, including ADRD, with statin therapy 
providing additional protective effects. These findings support the necessity of 
targeted lipid management as a preventive strategy against dementia, indicating 
the importance of personalised treatment approaches.

Numerous epidemiological and pathophysiological arguments suggest a 
bidirectional link between late-onset epilepsy and Alzheimer's disease. However, 
the temporal and causal relationship between the pathophysiological processes 
underlying these two conditions remains unclear. It is likely that these 
connections are complex, requiring consideration of various scenarios of 
causality and reciprocity. In the absence of targeted therapies that effectively 
address the progression of both diseases, specific measures can be taken to 
improve patient care. These include screening for cognitive disorders in 
patients with late-onset epilepsy, detecting subclinical EEG activity in 
patients with Alzheimer's disease, and identifying and managing cardiovascular 
risk factors in both populations. Looking ahead, it is evident that global 
population aging and the potential demographic surge in these two patient groups 
will necessitate greater efforts to raise awareness and enhance the training of 
physicians and healthcare professionals in the emerging field of 
"epileptogeriatrics".

Lipid compounds from edible wild mushrooms have been reported for their 
biological activities related to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and diabetes mellitus 
(DM) treatment. This research investigated purified oleamide (PEWM) from edible 
wide mushroom and determined its antioxidant activity and inhibition potential 
against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and α-glucosidase. The PEWM was purified by 
preparative thin-layer chromatography (PTLC) with methanol: chloroform: water 
(6:6:1 v/v). The antioxidant activity against ABTS·+ and DPPH· radical of crude 
extracts (CEWM) had higher potent than PEWM. On the other hand, the inhibition 
potential of PEWM against AChE and α-glucosidase had higher potency than CEWM. 
Moreover, the inhibition potency of PEWM and oleamide against AChE was higher 
than α-glucosidase. The inhibition mode of CEWM, PEWM and oleamide exhibited 
mixed-type inhibition on AChE and α-glucosidase. Inhibition constant (Ki) also 
supported that CEWM, PEWM and oleamide have the highest potent on AChE. CEWM, 
PEWM and oleamide showed fluorescence quenching by increasing the inhibitors' 
concentration against AChE and α-glucosidase. Docking analysis revealed that 
oleamide was located in peripheral anionic sites of AChE. The results suggest 
that edible wild mushrooms as the source of lipids related to AChE and 
α-glucosidase inhibitory activity might be applied for AD and DM management.

Nanotechnology-based herbal drug formulations that target multiple aspects of 
the disease are one of the possible approaches to address the pathological 
intricacies of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The present study includes the 
development of rutin embedded with zinc chloride-loaded bovine serum albumin 
nanoparticles (R-BSA-ZnCl2 NPs) to counter AD pathogenesis. In this work, the 
anti-AD potential of selected Phyto active (Rutin) was investigated using a high 
throughput in silico screening technique. Characterisation and optimization of 
the formulation were performed by different analytical methods such as FT-IR, 
zeta sizer and zeta potential, SEM analysis, thermal analysis, x-ray diffraction 
technique, etc. In vitro, free radical scavenging assay of the formulation was 
performed using a DPPH assay, and the ROS quantification was done by taking the 
RAW cell line. The amyloid β disaggregation study was confirmed by the 
thioflavin T assay, and the blood-brain barrier permeability assay was performed 
by taking brain endothelial cells. An anticholinesterase study was conducted to 
ascertain the formulation's potential for treating Alzheimer's disease. The NPs 
was prepared by ion gelation method and characterized for size (164.8 ± 5.6 nm), 
zeta potential (-29.6 mV), encapsulation efficiency (91 ± 1.1 %) and loading 
capacity (10 ± 0.2 %). The FTIR analysis indicated that there was no chemical 
interaction between the functional groups of rutin and other excipients. DSC, 
XRD studies suggested unchanged physical state of rutin in the prepared 
nanoparticle. Surface characterization analysed the irregular morphology of the 
nanoparticle. The antioxidant activity by DPPH and FRAP assay demonstrated a 
significant increase in free radical scavenging for R-BSA-ZnCl2 NPs in compared 
to rutin (p < 0.01). Anti-aggregation studies indicated that the nanoparticle 
inhibited the Aβ fibrils by over 70-80 %, as confirmed by Thioflavin T assay. 
Moreover, the blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability assay indicated permeation 
of nanoparticle via BBB. Thus, the present study highlighted that bovine serum 
albumin-zinc chloride nanoparticle may be used as a multifactorial therapeutic 
platform to address neurodegeneration associated with cognition.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most commonly diagnosed form of 
senile dementia, with limited therapeutic options. Neuronal damage is caused by 
factors secreted by inflammatory cells but also, the lack of antioxidants to 
prevent oxidative stress and help maintain neuronal integrity, which is crucial 
for cognition and memory are mediators of AD. Terminalia macroptera barks 
contain glycosyl terpenoids, known for their strong antioxidant properties. This 
study investigated the antioxidant and neuroprotective effects of the glycosylic 
terpenoid-rich fraction of Terminalia macroptera (GT-TeMac™) in 
scopolamine-treated rats.
METHODS: Glycosylic terpenoids were identified by LC-MS and antiradical activity 
tests (DPPH and ORAC) were performed. Cholinergic cognitive dysfunction and 
oxidative stress were induced in male wistar rats, by intraperitoneal injection 
of scopolamine (1 mg/kg BW/day) for seven consecutive days. GT-TeMac™ at 
100 mg/kg and Donepezil at 5 mg/kg body weight were administered orally 60 min 
after scopolamine. After treatment, rat were sacrificed and brains were 
collected for the evaluation of cholinergic enzyme activity, oxidative stress 
markers and histopathological analysis. In vitro study was carried out to assess 
the ability of GT-TeMac™ to scavenge free radicals and suppress H2O2-induced ROS 
production in SK-N-SH cells. In addition, the ability of GT-TeMac™ to restore 
cell viability reduced by acrolein was performed.
RESULTS: Chebuloside II, Sericoside, 24-deoxysericoside, arjunglucoside 1 and 
23-galloylarjunolic acid 28-O-glucopyranosylester were identified by LC-MS. 
GT-TeMac™ has a SC50 of 9.54 μg/mL and an ORAC value of 1130 µM Trolox 
equivalent per mg of GT-TeMac™. The administration of GT-TeMac™ protected 
against cognitive decline in AD by inhibiting cholinesterase metabolism, 
modulating oxidative stress parameters and protecting hippocampal areas. 
Additionally, GT-TeMac™ absorbed and eliminated ROS produced by hydrogen 
peroxide in SKNSH cells and restored cell viability reduced by acrolein.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the active ingredients in GT-TeMac™ are 
promising drug candidates for the treatment of cognitive disorders associated 
with oxidative stress in AD.

Due to the increase in life expectancy, the prevalence of neurodegenerative 
diseases is estimated to grow considerably in the next decades. Unfortunately, 
there are no current curative treatments for the majority of these disorders and 
this might be due to the lack of early diagnosis. Nowadays, diagnosis of 
neurodegenerative disorders is mainly based on neuroimaging and clinical 
symptoms, although postmortem neuropathologic confirmation remains the 
gold-standard diagnostic technique. In this sense, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
proteome is considered a valuable molecular repository for diagnosing and 
targeting the neurodegenerative process. On the other hand, olfactory 
dysfunction is an early symptom that affects Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other 
tauopathies' patients. That is why we consider that the application of tissue 
proteomics in primary olfactory structures is an ideal approach to explore early 
pathophysiological changes, detecting olfactory proteins that might be tested in 
CSF as potential biomarkers. In this chapter, we have applied peptide 
fractionation methods followed by tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS), in 
silico analysis and semi-quantitative orthogonal techniques in the olfactory 
tract derived from AD subjects. After obtaining the differential OT proteome, we 
suggest that the use of different bioinformatic workflows might be a valuable 
workflow to discover potential disease biomarkers for AD and other tauopathies.
