Research suggests that physical exercise is associated with prevention and 
management of chronic diseases. The influence of physical exercise on brain 
function and metabolism and the mechanisms involved are well documented in the 
literature. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the potential 
implications of physical exercise and the molecular benefits of exercise in 
Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and epilepsy. Here, we present an 
overview of the effects of exercise on various aspects of metabolism and brain 
function. To this end, we conducted an extensive literature search of the 
PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases to identify articles 
published in the past two decades. This review delves into key aspects including 
the modulation of neuroinflammation, neurotrophic factors, and synaptic 
plasticity. Moreover, we explored the potential role of exercise in advancing 
therapeutic strategies for these chronic diseases. In conclusion, the review 
highlights the importance of regular physical exercise as a complementary 
non-pharmacological treatment for individuals with neurological disorders such 
as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease, and epilepsy.

Global concern about Alzheimer's disease (AD) is justified by its increasingly 
younger onset and significant economic burden. AD leads to neurodegeneration and 
cognitive decline, ultimately resulting in loss of autonomy. Against this 
background, the field of biomedical research has seen a surge of interest in the 
potential of carbon-based nanomaterials, mainly due to their ease of degradation 
and high biocompatibility. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been extensively studied 
in AD, including developing biosensors, drug delivery systems, and molecular 
imaging. Here, we introduced the biosafety and biodegradability of CNTs, with a 
particular focus on their uptake and degradation in brain tissue. The 
utilization of CNT in the context of AD therapy can facilitate the advancement 
of control approaches regimens and ensure the clinical safety of patients. This 
is achieved through the employment of these nanotubes as carriers for the 
delivery of drugs to the central nervous system (CNS), the detection of 
neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine (Ach) and monoamines, the development of 
biosensors and molecular imaging materials, the inhibition of Aβ formation and 
the detection of phosphorylated tau proteins, the promotion of CNS regeneration, 
and the modulation of ion-associated AD.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative brain disease without a 
cure. Lonicerae Japonicae Flos (LJF), a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, 
possesses a neuroprotective effect, but its mechanisms for AD are not well 
understood. This study aimed to investigate potential targets and constituents 
of LJF against AD.
METHODS: Network pharmacology and bioinformatics analyses were performed to 
screen potential compounds and targets. Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets 
related to AD patients were used to screen core targets of differential 
expression. Gene expression profiling interactive analysis (GEPIA) was used to 
validate the correlation between core target genes and major causative genes of 
AD. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to evaluate 
the predictive efficacy of core targets based on GEO datasets. Molecular docking 
and dynamics simulation were conducted to analyze the binding affinities of 
effective compounds with core targets.
RESULTS: Network pharmacology analysis showed that 112 intersection targets were 
identified. Bioinformatics analysis displayed that 32 putative core targets were 
identified from 112 intersection targets. Only eight core targets were 
differentially expressed based on GEO datasets. Finally, six core targets of 
MAPK8, CTNNB1, NFKB1, EGFR, BCL2, and NFE2L2 were related to AD progression and 
had good predictive ability based on correlation and ROC analyses. Molecular 
docking and dynamics simulation analyses elucidated that the component of lignan 
interacted with EGFR, the component of β-carotene interacted with CTNNB1 and 
BCL2, the component of β-sitosterol interacted with BCL2, the component of 
hederagenin interacted with NFKB1, the component of berberine interacted with 
EGFR and BCL2, and the component of baicalein interacted with NFKB1, EGFR and 
BCL2.
CONCLUSION: Through a comprehensive analysis, this study revealed that six core 
targets (MAPK8, CTNNB1, NFKB1, EGFR, BCL2, and NFE2L2) and six practical 
components (lignan, β-carotene, β-sitosterol, hederagenin, berberine, and 
baicalein) were involved in the mechanism of action of LJF against AD. Our work 
demonstrated that LJF effectively treats AD through its multi-component and 
multi-target properties. The findings of this study will establish a theoretical 
basis for the expanded application of LJF in AD treatment and, hopefully, can 
guide more advanced experimental research in the future.

TMEM106B is a lysosomal/late endosome protein that is a potent genetic modifier 
of multiple neurodegenerative diseases as well as general aging. Recently, 
TMEM106B was shown to form insoluble aggregates in postmortem human brain 
tissue, drawing attention to TMEM106B pathology and the potential role of 
TMEM106B aggregation in disease. In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, 
TMEM106B has been studied in vivo using animal models of neurodegeneration, but 
these studies rely on overexpression or knockdown approaches. To date, 
endogenous TMEM106B pathology and its relationship to known canonical pathology 
in animal models has not been reported. Here, we analyze histological patterns 
of TMEM106B in murine models of C9ORF72-related amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
and frontotemporal dementia (C9-ALS/FTD), SOD1-related ALS, and tauopathy and 
compare these to postmortem human tissue from patients with C9-ALS/FTD, 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), and AD with limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 
encephalopathy (AD/LATE). We show that there are significant differences between 
TMEM106B pathology in mouse models and human patient tissue. Importantly, we 
also identified convergent evidence from both murine models and human patients 
that links TMEM106B pathology to TDP-43 nuclear clearance specifically in 
C9-ALS. Similarly, we find a relationship at the cellular level between TMEM106B 
pathology and phosphorylated Tau burden in Alzheimer's disease. By 
characterizing endogenous TMEM106B pathology in both mice and human postmortem 
tissue, our work reveals considerations that must be taken into account when 
analyzing data from in vivo mouse studies and elucidates new insights supporting 
the involvement of TMEM106B in the pathogenesis and progression of multiple 
neurodegenerative diseases.

PURPOSE: The Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) Gene Curation Expert Panels 
(GCEPs) have historically focused on specific organ systems or phenotypes; thus, 
the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders GCEP (SD-GCEP) was formed to address an unmet 
need.
METHODS: The SD-GCEP applied ClinGen's framework to evaluate the clinical 
validity of genes associated with rare syndromic disorders. 111 Gene-Disease 
Relationships (GDRs) associated with 100 genes spanning the clinical spectrum of 
syndromic disorders were curated.
RESULTS: From April 2020 through March 2024, 38 precurations were performed on 
genes with multiple disease relationships and were reviewed to determine if the 
disorders were part of a spectrum or distinct entities. 14 genes were lumped 
into a single disease entity and 24 were split into separate entities, of which 
11 were curated by the SD-GCEP. A full review of 111 GDRs for 100 genes 
followed, with 78 classified as Definitive, 9 as Strong, 15 as Moderate, and 9 
as Limited highlighting where further data are needed. All diseases involved two 
or more organ systems, while the majority (88/111 GDRs, 79.2%) had five or more 
organ systems affected.
CONCLUSION: The SD-GCEP addresses a critical gap in gene curation efforts, 
enabling inclusion of genes for syndromic disorders in clinical testing and 
contributing to keeping pace with the rapid discovery of new genetic syndromes.

Integrating spatial transcriptomics and snRNA-seq data enhances differential 
gene expression analysis results of AD-related phenotypes.

Tang S, Liu S, Buchman AS, Bennett DA, De Jager PL, Hu J, Yang J.

Update in
    HGG Adv. 2025 Jul 10;6(3):100447. doi: 10.1016/j.xhgg.2025.100447.

BACKGROUND: Spatial transcriptomics ( ST ) data provide spatially-informed gene 
expression for studying complex diseases such as Alzheimer's disease ( AD ). 
Existing studies using ST data to identify genes with spatially-informed 
differential gene expression ( DGE ) of complex diseases have limited power due 
to small sample sizes. Conversely, single-nucleus RNA sequencing ( snRNA-seq ) 
data offer larger sample sizes for studying cell-type specific ( CTS ) DGE but 
lack spatial information. In this study, we integrated ST and snRNA-seq data to 
enhance the power of spatially-informed CTS DGE analysis of AD-related 
phenotypes.
METHOD: First, we utilized the recently developed deep learning tool CelEry to 
infer the spatial location of ∼1.5M cells from snRNA-seq data profiled from 
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) tissue of 436 postmortem brains in the 
ROS/MAP cohorts. Spatial locations of six cortical layers that have distinct 
anatomical structures and biological functions were inferred. Second, we 
conducted cortical-layer specific ( CLS ) and CTS DGE analyses for three 
quantitative AD-related phenotypes -- β-amyloid, tangle density, and cognitive 
decline. CLS-CTS DGE analyses were conducted based on linear mixed regression 
models with pseudo-bulk scRNA-seq data and inferred cortical layer locations.
RESULTS: We identified 450 potential CLS-CTS significant genes with nominal 
p-values<10 -4 , including 258 for β-amyloid, 122 for tangle density, and 127 
for cognitive decline. Majority of these identified genes, including the ones 
having known associations with AD (e.g., APOE , KCNIP3 , and CTSD ), cannot be 
detected by traditional CTS DGE analyses without considering spatial 
information. We also identified 8 genes shared across all three phenotypes, 21 
between β-amyloid and tangle density, 10 between cognitive decline and tangle 
density, and 10 between β-amyloid and cognitive density. Particularly, Gene Set 
Enrichment Analyses with the CLS-CTS DGE results of microglia in cortical 
layer-6 of β-amyloid identified 12 significant AD-related pathways.
CONCLUSION: Incorporating spatial information with snRNA-seq data detected 
significant genes and pathways for AD-related phenotypes that would not be 
identified by traditional CTS DGE analyses. These identified CLS-CTS significant 
genes not only help illustrate the pathogenesis of AD, but also provide 
potential CLS-CTS targets for developing therapeutics of AD.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer disease (AD)-modifying therapies are approved for 
treatment of early-symptomatic AD. Autosomal dominant AD (ADAD) provides a 
unique opportunity to test therapies in presymptomatic individuals.
METHODS: Using data from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN), 
sample sizes for clinical trials were estimated for various cognitive, imaging, 
and CSF outcomes. Sample sizes were computed for detecting a reduction of either 
absolute levels of AD-related pathology (amyloid, tau) or change over time in 
neurodegeneration (atrophy, hypometabolism, cognitive change).
RESULTS: Biomarkers measuring amyloid and tau pathology had required sample 
sizes below 200 participants per arm (examples CSF Aβ42/40: 47[95%CI 25,104], 
cortical PIB 49[28,99], CSF p-tau181 74[48,125]) for a four-year trial in 
presymptomatic individuals (CDR=0) to have 80% power (5% statistical 
significance) to detect a 25% reduction in absolute levels of pathology, 
allowing 40% dropout. For cognitive, MRI, and FDG, it was more appropriate to 
detect a 50% reduction in rate of change. Sample sizes ranged from 250-900 
(examples hippocampal volume: 338[131,2096], cognitive composite: 
326[157,1074]). MRI, FDG and cognitive outcomes had lower sample sizes when 
including indivduals with mild impairment (CDR=0.5 and 1) as well as 
presymptomatic individuals (CDR=0).
DISCUSSION: Despite the rarity of ADAD, presymptomatic clinical trials with 
feasible sample sizes given the number of cases appear possible.

Disease-specific fluid biomarkers are in demand for parkinsonian syndromes (PS). 
Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) was proposed as a biomarker for Lewy body 
disease. As such, this project aimed to confirm CRH as a potential biomarker for 
different PS. CRH and misfolded α-synuclein (αSyn) were measured in CSF. The 
primary cohort included Lewy body disease patients (i.e. Parkinson's disease or 
dementia with Lewy bodies, n = 77), atypical PS (n = 37) and non-parkinsonian 
neurodegenerative diseases (n = 164), as well as controls (n = 354). A 
replication cohort included Lewy body disease (n = 27), atypical PS (n = 58) and 
controls (n = 58). CRH was downregulated in αSyn positive Lewy body disease, 
αSyn positive controls and in all atypical PS compared with αSyn negative 
controls (P = 3.3e-05, P = 3.1e-10, P = 2.9e-03). CRH was also decreased in αSyn 
positive Lewy body disease compared with αSyn negative non-PS (P = 2e-03) and 
correlated with cognitive impairment and inflammation in αSyn positive Lewy body 
disease. We show that CRH is a promising biomarker for Lewy body disease and 
atypical PS and its association with inflammation and cognitive decline. 
Reductions in CRH in Lewy body disease and other PS suggest this decrease may 
relate to dopaminergic degeneration instead of αSyn pathology.

PURPOSE: β-amyloid overload-induced neuroinflammation and neuronal loss are key 
pathological changes that occur during the progression of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). Dexmedetomidine (Dex) exhibits neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory 
effects on the nervous system. However, the effect of Dex in AD mice remains 
unclear, and its neuroprotective regulatory mechanism requires further 
investigation. This study aimed to reveal how Dex protects against Aβ induced 
neuropathological changes and behavior dysfunction in AD mice.
METHODS: An AD mouse model was established by the injection of Aβ into the 
brains of mice, followed by intraperitoneal injection with Dex. CXCL2 
overexpression and Yohimbine, a Dex inhibitor, were used to investigate the role 
of Dex and CXCL2 in the regulation of neuronal loss, cognitive decline, and 
anxiety-like behavior in AD mice. Behavioral tests were performed to evaluate 
the cognitive and anxiety status of the mice. Nissl staining and 
immunofluorescence experiments were conducted to evaluate the status of the 
hippocampal neurons and astrocytes. qRT-PCR was performed to detect the 
expression of CXCL2, IL-1β, INOS, SPHK1, Bcl2, IFN-γ, and Caspase 1. The 
malondialdehyde (MDA) level was detected using an ELISA kit. Terminal TUNEL and 
Fluoro-Jade C (FJC) staining were used to measure the cell apoptosis rate.
RESULTS: In AD mice, cognitive decline and anxiety-like behaviors were 
significantly improved by the Dex treatment. The number of neurons was increased 
in mice in the Dex + AD group compared to those in the AD group, and the number 
of astrocytes was not significantly different between the two groups. CXCL2, 
IL-1β, iNOS, and SPHK1 levels were significantly lower in Dex-treated AD mice 
than those in AD mice. Overloading of CXCL2 or Yohimbine reversed the protective 
effect of Dex on neuron number and cognitive and anxiety symptoms in AD mice.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that Dex exerts neuroprotective effects by 
downregulating CXCL2. Dex shows potential as a therapeutic drug for AD.

There is growing evidence suggesting that the lysosome or lysosome dysfunction 
is associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Pathway analysis of post mortem 
brain-derived proteomic data from AD patients shows that the lysosomal system is 
perturbed relative to similarly aged unaffected controls. However, it is unclear 
if these changes contributed to the pathogenesis or are a response to the 
disease. Consistent with the hypothesis that lysosome dysfunction contributes to 
AD pathogenesis, whole genome sequencing data indicate that heterozygous 
pathogenic mutations and predicted protein-damaging variants in multiple 
lysosomal enzyme genes are enriched in AD patients compared to matched controls. 
Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the palmitoyl protein thioesterase-1 
(PPT1), α-L-iduronidase (IDUA), β-glucuronidase (GUSB), N-acetylglucosaminidase 
(NAGLU), and galactocerebrosidase (GALC) genes have a gene-dosage effect on Aβ40 
levels in brain interstitial fluid in C57BL/6 mice and significantly increase Aβ 
plaque formation in the 5xFAD mouse model of AD, thus providing in vivo 
validation of the human genetic data. A more detailed analysis of PPT1 
heterozygosity in 18-month-old mice revealed changes in α-, β-, and γ-secretases 
that favor an amyloidogenic pathway. Proteomic changes in brain tissue from aged 
PPT1 heterozygous sheep are consistent with both the mouse data and the 
potential activation of AD pathways. Finally, CNS-directed, AAV-mediated gene 
therapy significantly decreased Aβ plaques, increased life span, and improved 
behavioral performance in 5xFAD/PPT1+/- mice. Collectively, these data strongly 
suggest that heterozygosity of multiple lysosomal enzyme genes represent risk 
factors for AD and may identify precise therapeutic targets for a subset of 
genetically-defined AD patients.

Cellular senescence is a major contributor to aging-related degenerative 
diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) but much less is known on the key 
cell types and pathways driving mechanisms of senescence in the brain. We 
hypothesized that dysregulated cholesterol metabolism is central to cellular 
senescence in AD. We analyzed whole transcriptomic data and utilized single-cell 
RNA seq integration techniques to unveil the convoluted cell-type-specific and 
sub-cell-type-state-specific senescence pathologies in AD using both ROSMAP and 
Sea-AD datasets. We identified that microglia are central components to AD 
associated senescence phenotypes in ROSMAP snRNA-seq data (982,384 nuclei from 
postmortem prefrontal cortex of 239 AD and 188 non-AD) among non-neuron cell 
types. We identified that homeostatic, inflammatory, phagocytic, lipid 
processing and neuronal surveillance microglia states were associated with AD 
associated senescence in ROSMAP (152,459 microglia nuclei from six regions of 
brain tissue of 138 early AD, 79 late AD and 226 control subject) and in Sea-AD 
(82,486 microglia nuclei of 42 dementia, 42 no dementia and 5 reference 
subjects) via integrative analysis, which preserves the meaningful biological 
information of microglia cell states across the datasets. We assessed top 
senescence associated bioprocesses including mitochondrial, apoptosis, oxidative 
stress, ER stress, endosomes, and lysosomes systems. Specifically, we found that 
senescent microglia have altered cholesterol related bioprocesses and 
dysregulated cholesterol. We discovered three gene co-expression modules, which 
represent the specific cholesterol related senescence transcriptomic signatures 
in postmortem brains. To validate these findings, the activation of specific 
cholesterol associated senescence transcriptomic signatures was assessed using 
integrative analysis of snRNA-seq data from iMGs (microglia induced from iPSCs) 
exposed to myelin, Abeta, and synaptosomes (56,454 microglia across two 
replicates of untreated and four treated groups). In vivo cholesterol associated 
senescence transcriptomic signatures were preserved and altered after treatment 
with AD pathological substrates in iMGs. This study provides the first evidence 
that dysregulation of cholesterol metabolism in microglia is a major driver of 
senescence pathologies in AD. Targeting cholesterol pathways in senescent 
microglia is an attractive strategy to slow down AD progression.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurogenerative disease that affects millions 
worldwide with no effective treatment. Several studies have been conducted to 
decipher to genomic underpinnings of AD. Due to its complex nature, many genes 
have been found to be associated with AD. Despite these findings, the 
pathophysiology of the disease is still elusive. To discover new putative 
AD-associated genes, in this study, we integrated multimodal gene and phenotype 
datasets of AD using network biology methods to prioritize potential AD-related 
genes. We constructed a multiplex heterogeneous network composed of patient and 
gene similarity networks utilizing phenotypic and omics datasets of AD patients 
from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. We applied 
PhenoGeneRanker to traverse this network to discover potential AD-associated 
genes. To assess the impact of each network layer and seed gene, we also run 
PhenoGeneRanker on different variants of the network and seed genes. Our results 
showed that top-ranked genes captured several known AD-related genes and were 
enriched in Gene Ontology (GO) terms related to AD. We also observed that 
several top-ranked genes that are not in AD-associated gene list had literature 
supporting their potential relevance to AD.

The search for new treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD) has led to the 
exploration of plant-based drugs as potential options. Acetylcholinesterase 
(AChE) inhibitors are widely used as anti-AD medications. This study aimed to 
investigate the inhibitory mechanism of girinimbine, a constituent of Murraya 
koenigii, on AChE. AChE inhibition was assessed by in vitro experiments using 
the modified Ellman method, as well as in silico molecular docking and molecular 
dynamic simulation. The results were compared to those of the well-known 
anti-AChE agents tacrine and propidium iodide. Girinimbine, propidium, and 
tacrine at concentrations of 3.8X10-5M, 1.1x10-5M, and 6.1x10-7M showed 
percentages of inhibition percentages of 35.6%, 28.2%, and 76.6%, respectively. 
The docking and molecular dynamics simulation analyses indicated that 
girinimbine exhibited a higher binding affinity to AChE compared to propidium 
and tacrine. This finding was further confirmed by the docking, root mean square 
deviation (RMSD), root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), and radius of rotation 
analyses. In conclusion, M. koenigii girinimbine shows promise as an 
acetylcholinesterase inhibitor for Alzheimer's disease. Further research, 
including in vivo studies and clinical trials, is needed to explore its 
potential as a plant-based drug candidate for AD treatment.

Selective vulnerability of neuronal populations occurs in both Down syndrome 
(DS) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), resulting in disproportional degeneration of 
pyramidal neurons (PNs) affecting memory and executive function. Elucidating the 
cellular mechanisms underlying the selective vulnerability of these populations 
will provide pivotal insights for disease progression in DS and AD. Single 
population RNA-sequencing analysis was performed on neurons critical for 
executive function, prefrontal cortex Brodmann area 9 (BA9) layer III (L3) and 
layer V (L5) excitatory PNs in postmortem human DS and age- and sex-matched 
control (CTR) brains. Data mining was performed on differentially expressed 
genes (DEGs) from PNs in each lamina with DEGs divergent between lamina 
identified and interrogated. Bioinformatic inquiry of L3 PNs revealed more 
unique/differentially expressed DEGs (uDEGs) than in L5 PNs in DS compared to 
CTR subjects, indicating gene dysregulation shows both spatial and cortical 
laminar projection neuron dependent dysregulation. DS triplicated human 
chromosome 21 (HSA21) comprised a subset of DEGs only dysregulated in L3 or L5 
neurons, demonstrating partial cellular specificity in HSA21 expression. These 
HSA21 uDEGs had a disproportionally high number of noncoding RNAs, suggesting 
lamina specific dysfunctional gene regulation. L3 uDEGs revealed overall more 
dysregulation of cellular pathways and processes, many relevant to early AD 
pathogenesis, while L5 revealed processes suggestive of frank AD pathology. 
These findings indicate that trisomy differentially affects a subpopulation of 
uDEGs in L3 and L5 BA9 projection neurons in aged individuals with DS, which may 
inform circuit specific pathogenesis underlying DS and AD.

Various biomarkers such as proteins play key roles in controlling crucial 
biochemical processes. The critical concentration of the biomarkers is important 
to maintain a healthy life. In fact, imbalance in concentration or irregular 
activity of these can lead to various diseases like Cancer, Alzheimer's etc. 
Therefore, the disease related biomarkers and their timely detection are key to 
control the illness. In the literature, a few activity-based probes for the 
detection of such biomarkers are available. As per the requirement an ideal 
probe should be very specific to recognize the target analyte and that could be 
achieved by virtue of having a robust structure and stimuli responsive nature. 
In this regard, several fluorescent probes are of great choice. Although these 
fluorescent probes face certain challenges such as aggregation caused quenching, 
which heavily affects the sensitivity and photostability is another major 
concern for many fluorescent probes. To overcome these challenges 
aggregation-induced emissive fluorescent probes found to be an excellent 
alternative. Aggregation induced emissive luminogens (AIEgens) offer higher 
signal to noise ratios and found to possess better photostability during sensing 
and imaging. In the present review we have summarized the development of 
AIEgenic probes for sensing and imaging of disease related biomarkers. We 
believe this review could be a guide to design efficient AIEgenic probes for the 
diagnostics development.

BACKGROUND: While some literature on clinical outcomes in persons with 
dementia-related psychosis exists, little is known regarding Alzheimer's 
disease-related psychosis (ADP).
OBJECTIVE: Describe demographic/clinical characteristics of adults with ADP and 
estimate incidence of clinical events by antipsychotic treatment status.
METHODS: This cohort study identified adults ≥65 years with Alzheimer's disease 
and incident psychosis (US Medicare database [2013-2018]) and no prior exposure 
to antipsychotics. Two nonmutually exclusive ADP subcohorts included: patients 
who initiated treatment with antipsychotic medications (antipsychotic users) and 
those who remained untreated (antipsychotic nonusers). Baseline characteristics 
were evaluated before psychosis diagnosis in untreated patients and before 
antipsychotic initiation in treated patients. Incidence rates were estimated for 
falls and fractures (composite and separately), seizure/epilepsy (new onset and 
any), and mortality.
RESULTS: 145,333 ADP antipsychotic nonusers and 49,452 antipsychotic users were 
identified. Both cohorts had similar baseline demographics; however, 
antipsychotic users versus nonusers had higher baseline skilled nursing facility 
use (40.3% and 27.8%), mood (72.7% and 62.1%) and anxiety (70.9% and 57.3%) 
disorders, falls/fractures (39.5% and 33.8%), urinary tract infections (55.1% 
and 47.0%), and frailty index scores (76.0% and 69.7%). Crude incidence rates 
(95% confidence interval)/100 person-years in antipsychotic users and nonusers 
were 70.0 (68.9-71.2) and 55.8 (55.4-56.1) (falls/fractures composite), 69.0 
(67.9-70.1) and 54.9 (54.5-55.2) (falls), 38.6 (38.1-39.0) and 33.0 (32.7-33.2) 
(mortality), and 45.8 (44.9-46.7) and 54.2 (53.9-54.6) (any seizure/epilepsy).
CONCLUSIONS: Antipsychotic initiators with ADP had a higher burden of some 
baseline comorbidities; experienced higher incidence of falls, fractures, and 
mortality; and had lower incidence of seizure/epilepsy than antipsychotic 
nonusers.

Intermittent theta burst stimulation, a derivative of repetitive transcranial 
magnetic stimulation, has been applied to improve cognitive deficits. However, 
its efficacy and mechanisms in enhancing cognitive function in patients with 
amnestic mild cognitive impairment compared with traditional repetitive 
transcranial magnetic stimulation paradigms remain unclear. This study recruited 
48 amnestic mild cognitive impairment patients, assigning them to intermittent 
theta burst stimulation, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, and sham 
groups (5 times/wk for 4 wk). Neuropsychological assessments and functional 
magnetic resonance imaging data were collected pre- and post-treatment. 
Regarding efficacy, both angular gyrus intermittent theta burst stimulation and 
repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation significantly improved general 
cognitive function and memory compared to the sham group, with no significant 
difference between the 2 treatment groups. Mechanistically, significant changes 
in brain activity within the temporoparietal network were observed in both the 
intermittent theta burst stimulation and repetitive transcranial magnetic 
stimulation groups, and these changes correlated with improvements in general 
cognitive and memory functions. Additionally, intermittent theta burst 
stimulation showed stronger modulation of functional connectivity between the 
hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and temporal regions compared to repetitive 
transcranial magnetic stimulation. The intermittent theta burst stimulation and 
repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation can improve cognitive function in 
amnestic mild cognitive impairment patients, but intermittent theta burst 
stimulation may offer higher efficiency. Intermittent theta burst stimulation 
and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation likely enhance cognitive 
function, especially memory function, by modulating the temporoparietal network.

Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a neurological disorder in the elderly, 
involving the deposition of vascular amyloid-β (Aβ). Sleep deprivation (SD) 
causes memory deficits during CAA. Lysine specific demethylase 6B (KDM6B) is a 
histone H3 lysine 27-specific demethylase associated with neuronal injury and 
inflammation. However, the role of KDM6B in CAA has yet to be studied. In the 
current study, the multi-platform over-water method was used to induce chronic 
SD in APP/PS1 mice. Pathological analysis revealed that SD exacerbated vascular 
lesions in this model, as manifested by extensive formation of Aβ-positive 
deposits. In addition, SD led to a significant increase in the expression of 
KDM6B in the cerebral cortex of APP/PS1 mice. Next, the effect of KDM6B on CAA 
progression was explored through loss of function. Further experiments 
illustrated that KDM6B knockdown diminished SD-induced memory impairment, 
neuronal injury and vascular lesions in vivo. Additionally, isolated primary 
cortical neurons were treated with 10 µM Aβ1-42 for 48 h to induce the cell 
model. As expected, knockdown of KDM6B inhibited the Aβ1-42-induced cytotoxicity 
in primary neurons. Mechanistically, our results demonstrated that KDM6B 
knockdown downregulated poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase16 (PARP16) expression by 
increasing trimethylated lysine 27 on histone 3 (H3K27me3) levels, indicating 
that KDM6B epigenetically regulated PARP16 expression. Function recovery 
experiment results further proved that PARP16 overexpression negated the effect 
of KDM6B knockdown on Aβ1-42-induced cytotoxicity. Overall, our findings uncover 
an unanticipated role of KDM6B in CAA, and KDM6B may serve as a potential 
therapeutic target for CAA. Abbreviations: CAA, cerebral amyloid angiopathy; Aβ,

Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a single-pass transmembrane protein 
abundantly expressed in the central nervous system and implicated in familial 
Alzheimer's disease, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that impairs 
memory. Here, we investigated the role of amyloid precursor protein-like (APPL) 
using the model organism Drosophila melanogaster. In this study, Appl null 
mutants exhibited a reduced lifespan under normal conditions and increased 
triglyceride levels, which were mitigated by metformin treatment. Additionally, 
taste-associative memory impairment in Appld mutants suggested APPL's role in 
memory formation, which was restored by curcumin supplementation. The Appld 
mutants also displayed reduced climbing ability, which was improved by 
supplementation with vitamins C (ascorbic acid) and B2 (riboflavin). These 
findings suggest that APPL is involved in metabolic regulation, cognition, 
climbing activity, and aging in Drosophila melanogaster.

In recent years, the role of the microbiome-gut-brain axis in the pathogenesis 
of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has garnered increasing attention. Specifically, 
tryptophan metabolism via the kynurenine pathway (KP) plays a crucial regulatory 
role in this axis. This study reviews how exercise regulates the 
microbiome-gut-brain axis by influencing kynurenine pathway metabolism, thereby 
exerting resistance against AD. This paper also discusses how exercise 
positively impacts AD via the microbiome-gut-brain axis by modulating the 
endocrine, autonomic nervous, and immune systems. Although the specific 
mechanisms are not fully understood, research indicates that exercise may 
optimize tryptophan metabolism by promoting the growth of beneficial microbiota 
and inhibiting harmful microbiota, producing substances that are beneficial to 
the nervous system and combating AD. The aim of this review is to provide new 
perspectives and potential intervention strategies for the prevention and 
treatment of AD by exploring the links between exercise, KP and the gut-brain 
axis.

Pathological TDP-43 loss from the nucleus and cytoplasmic aggregation occurs in 
almost all cases of ALS and half of frontotemporal dementia patients. Stathmin2 
(Stmn2) is a key target of TDP-43 regulation and aberrantly spliced Stmn2 mRNA 
is found in patients with ALS, frontotemporal dementia, and Alzheimer's Disease. 
STMN2 participates in the axon injury response and its depletion in vivo 
partially replicates ALS-like symptoms including progressive motor deficits and 
distal NMJ denervation. The interaction between STMN2 loss and TDP-43 
dysfunction has not been studied in mice because TDP-43 regulates human but not 
murine Stmn2 splicing. Therefore, we generated trans-heterozygous mice that lack 
one functional copy of Stmn2 and express one mutant TDP-43Q331K knock-in allele 
to investigate whether reduced STMN2 function exacerbates TDP-43-dependent 
pathology. Indeed, we observe synergy between these two alleles, resulting in an 
early onset, progressive motor deficit. Surprisingly, this behavioral defect is 
not accompanied by detectable neuropathology in the brain, spinal cord, 
peripheral nerves or at neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). However, the 
trans-heterozygous mice exhibit abnormal mitochondrial morphology in their 
distal axons and NMJs. As both STMN2 and TDP-43 affect mitochondrial dynamics, 
and neuronal mitochondrial dysfunction is a cardinal feature of many 
neurodegenerative diseases, this abnormality likely contributes to the observed 
motor deficit. These findings demonstrate that partial loss of STMN2 
significantly exacerbates TDP-43-associated phenotypes, suggesting that STMN2 
restoration could ameliorate TDP-43 related disease before the onset of 
degeneration.

Dementia is an increasing disorder, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the cause of 
60% of all dementia cases. Despite all efforts, there is no cure for stopping 
dementia progression. Recent studies reported potential effects of psychedelics 
on neuroinflammation during AD. Psychedelics by 5HT2AR activation can reduce 
proinflammatory cytokine levels (TNF-α, IL-6) and inhibit neuroinflammation. In 
addition to neuroinflammation suppression, psychedelics induce neuroplasticity 
by increasing Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels through Sigma-1R 
stimulation. This review discussed the effects of psychedelics on AD from both 
neuroinflammatory and neuroplasticity standpoints.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease. Nervonic acid 
is a component of breast milk and is also found in fish oil and specific 
vegetable oils. Studies have shown that nervonic acid is essential for the 
development of the human nervous system. In this study, Morris water maze (MWM) 
test and pathological analysis showed that nervonic acid could improve cognitive 
deficits and brain nerve damage in AD rats. Then, through sequencing, we found 
that nervonic acid increased the abundance of beneficial bacteria such as 
Lactobacillus and Bacteroides, and decreased the abundance of 
Pseudomonadaceae_Pseudomonas. Not only that, nervonic acid also regulates the 
production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and the levels of 29 fecal 
metabolites, and affects the metabolism of linoleic acid, α-linolenic acid, 
arachidonic acid, and sphingolipid. Finally, we verified the regulatory effect 
of nervonic acid on metabolic enzyme activity.

White matter hyperintensities (WMH) increase with age, with marked 
interindividual variation. There is a need for normative data by age and sex, to 
improve individualized WMH burden assessment. In this study, we pooled 
cross-sectional data from 15 population-based cohorts (14,876 nondemented 
individuals, age 18-97 years), through the Meta VCI Map consortium. Whole brain 
and tract-specific MRI-assessed WMH volumes were calculated in MNI-152 space. We 
used quantile regression to create centile curves of WMH volume versus age, 
stratified by sex. Total WMH volume and interindividual variance increased 
exponentially with age for both sexes, with females showing higher WMH volumes. 
WMH volume increase with aging was not uniform across the white matter, but 
instead followed one of three different patterns depending on location. Age- and 
sex-specific normative data for total and regional WMH volumes were created. Our 
study provides detailed information on the normal distribution of total and 
regional WMH volumes across adulthood. The normative data enable a quantitative 
approach to interpreting total and regional WMH volumes in clinical practice and 
research settings.

Microglia-mediated neuroinflammation plays a pivotal role in neurodegenerative 
diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. The modulation 
of chronic and sustained inflammatory processes in the brain with small 
molecules presents a promising therapeutic strategy for these devastating 
conditions. Aromatic turmerone (ar-turmerone, ART), an active constituent of 
turmeric essential oil derived from the edible plant Curcuma longa, has shown 
substantial potential in mitigating neuroinflammatory responses and associated 
cognitive deficits. Building on our previous work, we sought to discover more 
potent neuroinflammation suppressors by designing and synthesizing a series of 
ar-turmerone derivatives to investigate their structure-activity relationships. 
Microglia-based cellular evaluations revealed that naphthyl-substituted (7c) and 
N-substituted amides (7a) demonstrated the most pronounced inhibitory effects 
against NO, TNF-α, and IL-1β release in vitro. Furthermore, in a 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation model of Alzheimer's disease 
in mice, these two compounds significantly reduced proinflammatory cytokine 
release, protected neurons from damage, and ameliorated memory impairments and 
cognitive deficits in Morris water maze tests. This structural optimization of 
ar-turmerone yielded highly potent anti-neuroinflammatory compounds, which may 
serve as promising agents for the treatment of neuroinflammation-related 
neurodegenerative disorders.

BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a commonly used 
treatment for severe aortic stenosis. As degenerative aortic stenosis is 
primarily a disease afflicting older adults, a frailty assessment is essential 
to patient selection and optimal periprocedural outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to enhance frailty assessments of TAVR candidates by 
integrating real-world structured and unstructured data.
METHODS: This study analyzed data from 14,000 patients between January 2018 and 
December 2019 to assess frailty in TAVR patients at the University of Florida. 
Frailty was identified using the Fried criteria, which includes weight loss, 
exhaustion, walking speed, grip strength, and physical activity. Latent 
Dirichlet allocation for topic modeling and Extreme Gradient Boosting for 
frailty prediction were applied to unstructured clinical notes and structured 
electronic health record (EHR) data. We also used least absolute shrinkage and 
selection operator regression for feature selection. Model performance was 
rigorously evaluated using nested cross-validation, ensuring the 
generalizability of the findings.
RESULTS: Model performance was significantly improved by combining unstructured 
clinical notes with structured EHR data, achieving an area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve of 0.82 (SD 0.07), which surpassed the EHR-only 
model's area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.64 (SD 
0.08). The Shapley Additive Explanations analysis found that congestive heart 
failure management, back problems, and atrial fibrillation were the top frailty 
predictors. Additionally, the latent Dirichlet allocation topic modeling 
identified 7 key topics, highlighting the role of specific medical treatments in 
predicting frailty.
CONCLUSIONS: Integrating unstructured clinical notes and structured EHR data led 
to a notable enhancement in predicting frailty. This method shows great 
potential for standardizing frailty assessments using real-world data and 
improving patient selection for TAVR.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a 
neurodegenerative tauopathy associated with exposure to repetitive head impacts, 
including from contact sports and military service. Although CTE case reports 
have commonly described aggression during midlife, recent studies failed to show 
associations between CTE tau burden and aggression. First-degree family history 
of mental illness (1°FHMI) is a well-established risk factor of aggression. We 
tested the hypothesis that CTE pathology moderates the association between 
1°FHMI and aggression, providing an explanation for the lack of association 
previously observed.
METHODS: This was a retrospective examination of consecutive, deceased, male 
brain donors with repetitive head impact exposure from the Understanding 
Neurologic Injury and Traumatic Encephalopathy Study at Boston University from 
2014 to 2021. Neuropathologists diagnosed CTE using established National 
Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke criteria. Informants were 
administered the Brown-Goodwin Assessment for Lifetime History of Aggression 
(BGLHA) and were queried regarding 1°FHMI. Exploratory factor analysis evaluated 
BGLHA factor structure. Stratified by CTE status, linear regression analyses 
examined relationships between 1°FHMI and standardized adult BGLHA scores and 
factor scores. Models were adjusted for race, age at death, education, years of 
contact sport play, military history, substance use treatment history, 
psychologically traumatic event history, and BGLHA childhood score.
RESULTS: Among 845 brain donors, the mean age at death was 60.3 (SD = 19.6) 
years. 589 donors (69.7%) had CTE, and 383 donors (45.3%) had a 1°FHMI. 1°FHMI 
was significantly associated with standardized adult BGLHA scores in those with 
CTE, but not in those without CTE (CTE present: β = 0.16, 95% CI 0.02-0.29; CTE 
absent: β = 0.10, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.32). The largest effects were observed among 
those with CTE, aged 40-59 years (CTE present: β = 0.64, 95% CI 0.32-0.96; CTE 
absent: β = 0.05, 95% CI -0.44 to 0.54), particularly for BGLHA factors of 
emotional dysregulation/impulsiveness (CTE present: β = 1.68, 95% CI 0.78-2.58; 
CTE absent: β = 0.09, 95% CI -1.20 to 1.37) and antisocial behavior (CTE 
present: β = 1.56, 95% CI 0.64-2.47; CTE absent: β = 0.10, 95% CI -1.19 to 
1.40).
DISCUSSION: Among brain donors exposed to repetitive head impacts, CTE pathology 
moderated the effect of 1°FHMI on BGLHA scores, with the largest effects in 
midlife. Predisposition to mental illness and CTE pathology may increase risk of 
aggression beyond each risk factor's additive effects. Prospective studies are 
needed to confirm these results.

Multifunctional nitrogen-doped carbon dots (N-CDs) were synthesized, and the 
morphology, composition, and spectral properties of N-CDs were characterized by 
multiple characterization techniques. The inhibition of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide 
aggregation and the destruction of the Aβ fibril structure by N-CDs were also 
studied. The conformational transition and morphology of Aβ42 in the presence of 
N-CDs were monitored by far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and 
transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results demonstrated that the 
prepared N-CDs could effectively inhibit Aβ42 peptide aggregation and 
depolymerize Aβ fibrils. Furthermore, the inhibition and disaggregation 
mechanism of existing Aβ42 fibrils by N-CDs was studied by electron paramagnetic 
resonance spectroscopy (EPR). The results showed that the modulation of reactive 
oxygen species (ROS) by N-CDs and multiple interactions between N-CDs and Aβ42 
fibrils played a crucial part in restraining and reducing the aggregation of 
Aβ42. Our work demonstrates the therapeutic potential of N-CDs in suppressing 
Aβ42 peptide aggregation and destroying existing Aβ42 fibrils, which provides a 
new perspective strategy in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Due to the importance of 4R tau (with four microtubule-binding-repeat domains) 
in the pathogenicity of primary tauopathies, it has been challenging to model 
these diseases in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons, which 
express very low levels of 4R tau. To address this, we have developed a panel of 
isogenic iPSC lines carrying MAPT splice-site mutations, S305S, S305I, or S305N, 
derived from four different donors. All mutations significantly increase 4R tau 
expression in iPSC neurons and astrocytes. Functional analyses of S305 mutant 
neurons reveal shared disruption in synaptic signaling and maturity but 
divergent effects on mitochondrial bioenergetics. In iPSC astrocytes, S305 
mutations promote internalization of exogenous tau that may be a precursor to 
glial pathology. These lines recapitulate previously characterized 
tauopathy-relevant phenotypes and highlight functional differences between the 
wild-type 4R and the mutant 4R proteins in both neurons and astrocytes. As such, 
these lines enable a more complete understanding of pathogenic mechanisms 
underlying 4R tauopathies across different cell types.

ABSTRACT Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is marked by gradual neuronal decline 
and subsequent loss of cognitive functions and memory, poses significant 
treatment challenges. The present study involved the development, in vitro, and 
in vivo evaluation of a novel intranasal mucoadhesive in-situ gel of vinpocetine 
(VIN) with the aim to target the brain. An innovative gel formulation composed 
of poloxamer 407, HPMC E15 LV, and citric acid as a solubilizer was developed by 
23 Factorial Design. The developed optimal formulation exhibited favorable 
rheological properties as it displayed ideal gelation time (31.6 ± 1.52 sec), 
optimum gelling temperature (32 ± 1.0 °C), enhanced mucoadhesive strength (6622 
± 2.64 dynes/cm2), prolonged adhesion (7.22 ± 0.57 hrs) compared with the 
baseline formulation (F18), and improved drug release in 12 hrs (39.59 ± 1.6%). 
In vivo, pharmacokinetics revealed a significant increase in Cmax (∼2-fold) and 
AUC0-t (∼2-fold) in the brain with the in-situ intranasal gel compared to the 
oral route. In the rat model of AD, in-situ intranasal gel demonstrated 
significantly greater efficacy (p < 0.001) than oral administration in 
alleviating AD symptoms as evidenced by behavioral and histological studies. 
Thus, VIN in-situ gel can be safe and noninvasive for nose-to-brain drug 
delivery.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: There is limited evidence on knowledge of related 
health among healthcare personnel who care for older adults. The objective of 
this study was to investigate the knowledge and experience of oral health care 
among family members and medical staff responsible for older adults with varying 
degrees of cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This qualitative study explored the experiences and 
knowledge of 30 family members and medical staff through in-depth, 
semi-structured interviews. The interviews were recorded using both audio and 
video formats: digital platforms were used for immediate family members, while 
formal caregivers were interviewed in person. Researchers transcribed and 
analysed the recordings, categorising the answers to identify emerging topics 
until reaching saturation.
RESULTS: The core emerging themes among the direct family members were: (1) Lack 
of knowledge about oral health; (2) Oral hygiene role for the patients; (3) 
Consequences of a poor oral care; and (4) Recommendations for a better oral 
health care. For the formal caregivers the emerging themes were: (1) Lack of 
knowledge and experiences about oral health; (2) Deficient oral hygiene of 
residents; (3) Impact on quality of life; and (4) Suggestions for improving oral 
health.
CONCLUSION: Despite recognising the significance of oral health, direct family 
members and formal caregivers of older adults with cognitive impairment or 
dementia still need additional tools to effectively carry out necessary hygiene 
techniques and care.

Cerebral microinfarcts represent the most prevalent form of ischemic brain 
injury in the elderly, particularly among those suffering from dementia, 
Alzheimer's disease, and vascular risk factors. Despite their commonality, 
effective treatments have remained elusive. Herein, a novel treatment utilizing 
a polymer-formulated nerve growth factor capable of crossing the blood-brain 
barrier is reported, which effectively reduced oxidative stress and neuronal 
apoptosis, reshaped microglia polarization at infarct sites, and decreased the 
overall microinfarct burden, leading to notable improvements in behavioral and 
cognitive functions in a mouse model. This work provides a promising new avenue 
for the treatment of cerebral microinfarcts and other neurodegenerative 
diseases.

INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has had multifaceted and enduring impacts on 
people with dementia and their caregivers; however, our understanding of the 
long-term outcomes remains limited. We aimed to explore the long-term effects of 
the COVID-19 pandemic on cognitive symptoms and vaccination rates in people 
living with dementia.
METHODS: This study was conducted as a part of a longitudinal study design in 
two specialized hospitals in South India. In this study, patients with dementia 
and their caregivers assessed in earlier phases ('period of lockdown with phased 
relaxations - phase-I' and 'cluster of cases transmission phase - phase-II') 
were telephonically interviewed. We adopted a quantitative approach to 
understand disease progression during the three-year course of the pandemic. 
Changes in cognition and disease severity were measured using the Clinical 
Dementia Rating (CDR) scale. In brief, semistructured interviews were carried 
out with caregivers of people with dementia to gain insights into vaccination 
rates. Data obtained from the current study (phase III) were compared against 
phase I data, which served as the baseline. Among the 72 participants contacted 
in the current phase, 59 (81·9%) could be reevaluated for dementia severity and 
vaccination status, whereas 13 (18·0%) had died. Among the 59 participants, 33 
(55·9%) had severe dementia (CDR 3). This is in contrast to phases I and II, 
when 17·6% and 19·2% of the participants, respectively, were classified as CDR 
3.
RESULTS: A significant difference in dementia severity between the two phases 
(phases I and III) was observed. In addition, we observed vaccination hesitancy 
among caregivers of patients with dementia. This study would provide valuable 
insights into the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the cognitive 
outcomes and vaccination status of patients with dementia.
CONCLUSION: This overall longitudinal study has compared dementia severity 
between different phases throughout the pandemic, with implications for future 
studies to tailor home-based support and healthcare interventions in order to 
meet these evolving needs.

In recent years, significant advancements have been made in utilizing 
nanoparticles (NPs) to modulate immune responses within the central nervous 
system (CNS), offering new opportunities for nanotherapeutic interventions in 
neurological disorders. NPs can serve as carriers for immunomodulatory agents or 
platforms for delivering nucleic acid-based therapeutics to regulate gene 
expression and modulate immune responses. Several studies have demonstrated the 
efficacy of NP-mediated immune modulation in preclinical models of neurological 
diseases, including multiple sclerosis, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and 
Parkinson's disease. While challenges remain, advancements in NPs engineering 
and design have led to the development of NPs using diverse strategies to 
overcome these challenges. The nano-bio interface with the immune system is key 
in the conceptualization of NPs to efficiently act as nanotherapeutics in the 
CNS. The biomolecular corona plays a pivotal role in dictating NPs behavior and 
immune recognition within the CNS, giving researchers the opportunity to 
optimize NPs design and surface modifications to minimize immunogenicity and 
enhance biocompatibility. Here, we review how NPs interact with the CNS immune 
system, focusing on immunosurveillance of NPs, NP-induced immune reprogramming 
and the impact of the biomolecular corona on NPs behavior in CNS immune 
responses. The integration of NPs into CNS nanotherapeutics offers promising 
opportunities for addressing the complex challenges of acute and chronic 
neurological conditions and pathologies, also in the context of preventive and 
rehabilitative medicine. By harnessing the nano-bio immune interface and 
understanding the significance of the biomolecular corona, researchers can 
develop targeted, safe, and effective nanotherapeutic interventions for a wide 
range of CNS disorders to improve treatment and rehabilitation. These 
advancements have the potential to revolutionize the treatment landscape of 
neurological diseases, offering promising solutions for improved patient care 
and quality of life in the future.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with an unknown cause. 
Many studies have suggested that the imbalance between the clearance and 
accumulation of β-amyloid protein (Aβ) in the brain of AD patients is the main 
cause of AD development of AD. Meanwhile, drug transporters play a key role in 
the transport of drugs and endogenous substances in vivo as well as in the 
development of many diseases. Could they be related to the imbalance between Aβ 
clearance and accumulation? OATP1A2 is the most abundant subfamily of organic 
anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs) that transport amphipathic substrates. 
Its high bilateral expression in brain endothelial cells suggests it plays a 
crucial role in delivering drugs and neuroactive peptides to brain tissue. Could 
it also be involved in mediating the production and accumulation of Aβ in the 
central system? This could lead to an imbalance between Aβ clearance and 
accumulation, ultimately resulting in AD development. This hypothesis would be 
bold and novel in the field of science. In this study, we successfully 
established the OATP1A2-HEK293T transgenic cell model, and found that the uptake 
of Aβ1-42 by OATP1A2-HEK293T cells was significantly higher than that of 
NC-HEK293T control cells and human astrocytes by adding different concentrations 
of Aβ1-42 to the cells of each group, suggesting that OATP1A2 expressed in the 
human brain is involved in Aβ amyloid protein transport.

Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by progressive damage to specific 
neuronal cells, resulting in cognitive impairments. Alzheimer's disease is one 
of the most common types of cognitive impairments. Until recently, strategies 
that prevent its clinical progression have remained elusive. It has been 
suggested that oxidative stress, mitochondrial injury, and inflammation might 
lead to brain cell death in many neurological disorders. Therefore, the 
identification of effective neuroprotective agents is a research priority, and 
several autophagy-targeted bioactive compounds are promising candidate 
therapeutics for the prevention of brain cell damage. Some Alzheimer's disease 
risk genes expressed within the brain are linked to cholesterol metabolism, 
lipid transport, endocytosis, exocytosis, and/or caveolae formation, suggesting 
fruitful therapeutic targets for the treatment of cognitive impairments. Among 
them, a well-known genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease is 
allelic variation of the Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genes. APOE proteins may 
regulate aspects of cellular homeostasis, which is perturbed in the brain in 
Alzheimer's disease. Interestingly, the Apolipoprotein E ε4 allele (APOE4) 
protein is related to autophagy and to the biogenesis of caveolae, endosomes, 
and exosomes, processes which might consequently be involved in the pathogenesis 
of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Recent research 
suggests that modification of the diet and/or gut-microbiota could be effective 
for treatment of various neurodegenerative diseases. Collectively, this research 
direction has the potential to improve clinical care through disease-modifying 
treatment strategies with benefits for patients with neurodegenerative diseases.

Approximately 100,000 persons live with Alzheimer's disease in Sweden. As the 
population ages, the need for diagnostics and disease-modifying treatment grows. 
Previously available treatments provide moderate symptom relief but do not 
affect disease progression. New antibody treatments show promising results and 
are typically well tolerated. However, adverse events include brain edema and 
hemorrhages, which can be detected early by MRI. These treatments require 
substantial resources, including increased use of MRI and radiological 
expertise. The introduction of new therapies will lead to higher regional 
healthcare costs and demands for specialized diagnostics. Implementing these 
therapies therefore necessitates national preparation and planning for 
coordinated and efficient management, addressing the significant societal and 
economic challenges posed by Alzheimer's disease.

BACKGROUND: By 2060, the global burden of dementia, particularly Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), is expected to increase significantly, necessitating effective 
palliative care strategies. Dysphagia, a common condition among people with 
dementia, leads to malnutrition, aspiration pneumonia, and a reduced quality of 
life.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify oral health management factors that 
could predict a decline in swallowing function in older adults with AD.
METHODS: Data from the Akita-Omorimachi study, which included 63 adults 
diagnosed with AD, were analysed. Swallowing function was assessed using the 
modified water-swallowing test (MWST) at baseline and after 1 year.
RESULTS: The results indicated that 25.4% of participants exhibited a decline in 
swallowing function, as indicated by a decrease from the highest MWST score of 5 
at baseline to a lower score at follow-up. Poisson regression analysis revealed 
that refusal of oral care (incidence rate ratio (IRR): 7.28), tongue coating 
(IRR: 4.21), and unclear articulation of /ka/ (IRR: 5.79) were significant 
predictors of swallowing function decline. The participants with these 
indicators had a higher risk of developing dysphagia.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that factors related to specific oral health 
problems may predict poor swallowing function in older adults with AD. Moreover, 
implementing targeted oral care interventions, including person-centered care 
and regular tongue cleaning, may improve the outcomes in this vulnerable 
population. Despite the limitations of this study, including a small sample 
size, the results underscore the importance of comprehensive oral health 
management in preventing dysphagia-related complications.

There is increasing interest in research and application of natural bioactive 
compounds due to the growing demand for functional ingredients from the 
pharmaceutical, cosmetic and food industries. A major challenge is finding 
suitable natural plant resources for the development of functional ingredients. 
Leptospermum, a genus of the myrtle family (Myrtaceae), is primarily native to 
Australia. This genus has been traditionally used for the treatment of a range 
of ailments, such as colds, fever, constipation, diarrhoea, skin, inflammation, 
stomach disorder and both internal and external pain. Manuka honey, known for 
its medicinal properties, is produced from the nectar of Leptospermum flowers, 
and the leaves of some species are used for essential oil production. Various 
volatiles, such as pinene, citral and citronellal, have been identified in 
Leptospermum essential oils. In addition, various non-volatile compounds like 
leptosperin, cyanidin, quercetin, ellagic acid, delphinidin and myricetin have 
been isolated from Leptospermum extracts. Preliminary studies have linked 
Leptospermum essential oils and extracts with various health-promoting 
properties, such as antimicrobial activity, antidiabetes, anticancer and 
anti-Alzheimer's disease activities, revealing potential applications of 
Leptospermum as functional ingredients. To provide a comprehensive understanding 
of Leptospermum for future research and applications, this review presents an 
overview of its botanical features, outlines volatile and non-volatile active 
molecules identified in the genus, reviews potential health benefits and finally 
proposes trends for future studies on Leptospermum.

Bidirectional Two-Sample, Two-Step Mendelian Randomisation Study Reveals 
Mediating Role of Gut Microbiota Between Vitamin B Supplementation and 
Alzheimer's Disease.

OBJECTIVES: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder 
with a complex aetiology. The aims of this study were to investigate the 
relationship between vitamin B supplementation and AD risk and to explore the 
potential mediating effect of the gut microbiota in this relationship.
METHODS: We employed a Mendelian randomisation analysis to examine the 
association between different vitamin B supplementation modalities (vitamin B6, 
folic acid, B12, and vitamin B complex tablets) and AD risk. Univariate 
Mendelian randomisation with inverse-variance weighting was used. Additionally, 
mediation analyses were conducted to identify the potential mediating effects of 
119 known bacterial genera.
RESULTS: The univariate Mendelian randomisation analyses showed no significant 
direct associations between individual vitamin B supplements or vitamin B 
complex tablets and AD risk. However, several gut bacterial genera were 
significantly associated with AD risk. Lachnospiraceae (NK4A136 group), 
Paraprevotella, Slackia, and Bifidobacterium were associated with reduced AD 
risk, while Defluviitaleaceae (UCG011), Desulfovibrio, Eubacterium ventriosum 
group, and Ruminococcaceae UCG-003 were associated with increased AD risk. The 
mediation analysis revealed that Lachnospiraceae (NK4A136 group), 
Defluviitaleaceae (UCG011), and Bifidobacterium fully mediated the causal 
relationships between vitamin B12, B6, and B complex supplementation, 
respectively, and AD risk.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence suggesting that certain gut microbiota 
genera are significantly associated with AD risk and may mediate the 
relationship between vitamin B supplementation and AD risk. These findings offer 
new insights into the variable effectiveness of B vitamins in treating 
neurodegenerative diseases and suggest potential new strategies for AD treatment 
and prevention.

This narrative review examines infectious diseases as modifiable risk factors 
for dementia, particularly in the context of an aging global population. As the 
prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias is expected to rise, 
prevention has become increasingly important due to the limited efficacy of 
current treatments. Emerging evidence links specific infectious diseases to 
increased dementia risk, possibly through mechanisms like neuroinflammation and 
disruption to normal cell function. Here, we review findings on how viral and 
bacterial infections contribute to dementia and explore potentially preventive 
measures, including vaccinations and antiviral treatments. Studies indicate that 
vaccinations against influenza, herpes zoster, and hepatitis, as well as 
antiviral treatments targeting human herpesvirus, could reduce the incidence of 
dementia. Additionally, non-pharmaceutical interventions during pandemics and in 
long-term care settings are highlighted as effective strategies for reducing the 
spread of infectious diseases, potentially lowering dementia risk. Putative 
mechanisms underlying the protective effects of these interventions suggest that 
reducing systemic inflammation may be important to their efficacy. While the 
currently available evidence suggests at best an association between some 
infectious diseases and dementia, this narrative review emphasizes the need to 
incorporate infectious disease prevention into broader public health strategies 
to potentially mitigate the growing burden of dementia. Further research is 
required to explore these preventive measures across diverse populations and to 
deepen our understanding of the biological mechanisms involved.

Photonic therapy is emerging as a promising method in neuroscience for 
addressing Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study uses computational simulations 
to investigate the impact of specific wavelengths emitted by photodiodes on the 
light absorption rates in brain tissue for brain implant sensors. Additionally, 
it presents a novel methodology that enhances light absorption via 
multi-parameter optimization. By adjusting the angle and wavelength of the 
incident light, the absorption rate was significantly enhanced using four 
photodiodes, each emitting at 660 nm with a power input of 3 mW. Notably, an 
incident angle of 20 degrees optimized light absorption and minimized thermal 
effects on brain tissue. The findings indicate that photodiodes within the 
near-infrared spectrum are suitable for low-temperature therapeutic applications 
in brain tissues, affirming the viability of non-invasive and safe photonic 
therapy. This research contributes foundational data for advancing brain implant 
photonic sensor design and therapeutic strategies. Furthermore, it establishes 
conditions for achieving high light absorption rates with minimal heat 
generation, identifying optimal parameters for efficient energy transfer.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most widespread neurodegenerative disorder. 
Recently, it was found that mucus extract from Cornu aspersum has beneficial 
effects on memory and cognitive processes in a rat scopolamine model of AD. The 
present study elucidated the mechanisms of action of standardized mucus snail 
extract (SE) enriched with a fraction above 20 kDa on Alzheimer-type dementia in 
rats. Using proteomic analysis on two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel 
electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) on rat cortex extracts, we compared protein expression 
in both groups: the first group was treated intraperitoneally with scopolamine 
(Sco, 2 mg/kg, 11 days) and the second (Sco + SE) group was treated 
intraperitoneally with Sco (Sco, 2 mg/kg) and protected by SE (0.5 mL/100 g bw) 
applied daily orally for 11 days. Brain cortex was separated and the expressions 
of various proteins related to memory and cognitive functions were identified. 
We found that the expression of Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase isozyme 
L1, Calbindin, Vacuolar ATP synthase catalytic subunit A, Tropomyosin beta 
chain, 14-3-3 zeta/delta, Kinesin-1 heavy chain, and Stathmin-4 significantly 
differs in SE-protected rats as compared to dement animals treated only by Sco, 
and these brain proteins might be potential therapeutic targets for 
Alzheimer's-type dementia treatment.

As some previously reported studies have proven that amodiaquine, in addition to 
its primary antimalarial activity, also has potential for new applications such 
as the inhibition of cholinesterases, in our study we focused on the evaluation 
of the influence of different substituents in the aminoquinoline part of the 
amodiaquine structure on the inhibition of human acetylcholinesterase and 
butyrylcholinesterase to investigate the possibility for their use as drugs for 
the treatment of AD. We synthesized a series of amodiaquine derivatives bearing 
H-, F-, CF3-, NO2-, CN-, CO2H- or CH3O- groups on the aminoquinoline ring, and 
determined that all of the tested derivatives were very potent inhibitors of 
both cholinesterases, with inhibition constants (Ki) in the nM and low μM range 
and with prominent selectivity (up to 300 times) for the inhibition of 
acetylcholinesterase. All compounds displayed an ability to chelate biometal 
ions Fe2+, Zn2+ and Cu2+ and an antioxidant power comparable to that of standard 
antioxidants. Most of the compounds were estimated to be able to cross the 
blood-brain barrier by passive transport and were nontoxic toward cells that 
represent the models of individual organs. Considering all these beneficial 
features, our study has singled out compound 5, the most potent AChE inhibitor 
with a CH3O- on C(7) position, followed by 6 and 14, compounds without 
substituent or hydroxyl groups in the C(17) position, respectively, as the most 
promising compounds from the series which could be considered as potential 
multi-target drugs for the treatment of AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with the 
dysregulation of several key enzymes, including acetylcholinesterase (AChE), 
cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β), β-site amyloid 
precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE-1), and caspase-3. In this study, 
machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boost (GB), and 
Extreme Gradient Boost (XGB) were employed to screen US-FDA approved drugs from 
the ZINC15 database to identify potential dual inhibitors of COX-2 and AChE. The 
models were trained using molecules obtained from the ChEMBL database, with 5039 
molecules for AChE and 3689 molecules for COX-2. Specifically, 1248 and 3791 
molecules were classified as active and inactive for AChE, respectively, while 
858 and 2831 molecules were classified as active and inactive for COX-2. The 
three machine learning models achieved prediction accuracies ranging from 92% to 
95% for both AChE and COX-2. Virtual screening of US-FDA drugs from the ZINC15 
database identified sertraline (SETL) as a potential dual inhibitor of AChE and 
COX-2. Further docking studies of SETL in the active sites of AChE and COX-2, as 
well as BACE-1, GSK-3β, and caspase-3, revealed strong binding affinities for 
all five proteins. In vivo validation was conducted using a lipopolysaccharide 
(LPS)-induced rat model pretreated with SETL for 30 days. The results 
demonstrated a significant decrease in the levels of AChE (p < 0.001), BACE-1 (p 
< 0.01), GSK-3β (p < 0.05), and COX-2 (p < 0.05). Additionally, the downstream 
effects were evaluated, showing significant decreases in the apoptosis marker 
caspase-3 (p < 0.05) and the oxidative stress marker malondialdehyde (MDA) (p < 
0.001), indicating that SETL is clinically localized in its effectiveness, 
mitigating both enzymatic activity and the associated pathological changes of 
cognitive impairment and AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves a complex pathophysiology with multiple 
interconnected subpathologies, including protein aggregation, impaired 
neurotransmission, oxidative stress, and microglia-mediated neuroinflammation. 
Current treatments, which generally target a single subpathology, have failed to 
modify the disease's progression, providing only temporary symptom relief. 
Multi-target drugs (MTDs) address several subpathologies, including impaired 
aggregation of pathological proteins. In this review, we cover hybrid molecules 
published between 2014 and 2024. We offer an overview of the strategies employed 
in drug design and approaches that have led to notable improvements and reduced 
hepatotoxicity. Our aim is to offer insights into the potential development of 
new Alzheimer's disease drugs. This overview highlights the potential of 
multi-target drugs featuring heterocycles with N-benzylpiperidine fragments and 
natural compounds in improving Alzheimer's disease treatment.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a significant public health challenge with 
limited effective treatment options. Ramalin, a compound derived from Antarctic 
lichens, has shown potential in the treatment of AD because of its strong 
antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. However, its instability and 
toxicity have hindered the development of Ramalin as a viable therapeutic agent. 
The primary objective of this study was to synthesize and evaluate novel Ramalin 
derivatives with enhanced stabilities and reduced toxic profiles, with the aim 
of retaining or improving their therapeutic potential against AD. The 
antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-BACE-1, and anti-tau activities of four 
synthesized Ramalin derivatives (i.e., RA-Hyd-Me, RA-Hyd-Me-Tol, RA-Sali, and 
RA-Benzo) were evaluated. These derivatives demonstrated significantly improved 
stabilities compared to the parent compound, with RA-Sali giving the most 
promising results. More specifically, RA-Sali exhibited a potent BACE-1 
inhibitory activity and effectively reduced tau phosphorylation, a critical 
factor in AD pathology. Despite exhibiting reduced antioxidant activities 
compared to the parent compound, these derivatives represent a potential 
multi-targeted approach for AD treatment, marking a significant step forward in 
the development of stable and effective AD therapeutics.

Peptides possess a number of pharmacologically desirable properties, including 
greater chemical diversity than other biomolecule classes and the ability to 
selectively bind to specific targets with high potency, as well as 
biocompatibility, biodegradability, and ease and low cost of production. 
Consequently, there has been considerable interest in developing peptide-based 
therapeutics, including amyloid inhibitors. However, a major hindrance to the 
successful therapeutic application of peptides is their poor delivery to target 
tissues, cells or subcellular organelles. To overcome these issues, recent 
efforts have focused on engineering cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) antagonists 
of amyloidogenesis, which combine the attractive intrinsic properties of 
peptides with potent therapeutic effects (i.e., inhibition of amyloid formation 
and the associated cytotoxicity) and highly efficient delivery (to target 
tissue, cells, and organelles). This review highlights some promising CPP 
constructs designed to target amyloid aggregation associated with a diverse 
range of disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, transmissible spongiform 
encephalopathies (or prion diseases), Parkinson's disease, and cancer.

Advancements in Targeting Ion Channels for the Treatment of Neurodegenerative 
Diseases.

Ion channels are integral membrane proteins embedded in biological membranes, 
and they comprise specific proteins that control the flow of ion transporters in 
and out of cells, playing crucial roles in the biological functions of different 
cells. They maintain the homeostasis of water and ion metabolism by facilitating 
ion transport and participate in the physiological processes of neurons and 
glial cells by regulating signaling pathways. Neurodegenerative diseases are a 
group of disorders characterized by the progressive loss of neurons in the 
central nervous system (CNS) or peripheral nervous system (PNS). Despite 
significant progress in understanding the pathophysiological processes of 
various neurological diseases in recent years, effective treatments for 
mitigating the damage caused by these diseases remain inadequate. Increasing 
evidence suggests that ion channels are closely associated with 
neuroinflammation; oxidative stress; and the characteristic proteins in 
neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's 
disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), 
and multiple sclerosis (MS). Therefore, studying the pathogenic mechanisms 
closely related to ion channels in neurodegenerative diseases can help identify 
more effective therapeutic targets for treating neurodegenerative diseases. 
Here, we discuss the progress of research on ion channels in different 
neurodegenerative diseases and emphasize the feasibility and potential of 
treating such diseases from the perspective of ion channels.

Neurodegenerative brain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), multiple 
sclerosis (MS), and Parkinson's disease (PD) are difficult to treat. 
Unfortunately, many therapeutic agents for neurodegenerative disease only halt 
the progression of these diseases and do not reverse neuronal damage. There is a 
demand for finding solutions to reverse neuronal damage in the central nervous 
system (CNS) of patients with neurodegenerative brain diseases. Therefore, the 
purpose of this review is to discuss the potential for therapeutic agents like 
specific neurotrophic and growth factors in promoting CNS neuroregeneration in 
brain diseases. We discuss how BDNF, NGF, IGF-1, and LIF could potentially be 
used for the treatment of brain diseases. The molecule's different mechanisms of 
action in stimulating neuroregeneration and methods to analyze their efficacy 
are described. Methods that can be utilized to deliver these proteins to the 
brain are also discussed.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder that presents a 
significant health concern, often leading to substantial cognitive decline among 
older adults. A prominent feature of AD is progressive dementia, which 
eventually disrupts daily functioning and the ability to live independently. A 
major challenge in addressing AD is its prolonged pre-symptomatic phase, which 
makes early detection difficult. Moreover, the disease's complexity and the 
inefficiency of current diagnostic methods impede the development of targeted 
therapies. Therefore, there is an urgent need to enhance diagnostic 
methodologies for detection and treating AD even before clinical symptoms 
appear. Exosomes are nanoscale biovesicles secreted by cells, including nerve 
cells, into biofluids. These exosomes play essential roles in the central 
nervous system (CNS) by facilitating neuronal communication and thus influencing 
major physiological and pathological processes. Exosomal cargo, particularly 
microRNAs (miRNAs), are critical mediators in this cellular communication, and 
their dysregulation affects various pathological pathways related to 
neurodegenerative diseases, including AD. This review discusses the significant 
roles of exosomal miRNAs in the pathological mechanisms related to AD, focusing 
on the promising use of exosomal miRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers and targeted 
therapeutic interventions for this devastating disease.

Exploring the Connection Between Nanomaterials and Neurodegenerative Disorders.

Nanda SS(1), Yi DK(1).

Author information:

Drug delivery, tissue engineering, and cell promotion in biomedical fields 
heavily rely on the use of nanomaterials (NMs). When they penetrate cells, NPs 
undergo degradation and initiate the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
by causing changes in the structures of organelles linked to mitochondria. 
Inside the cell, the excess production of ROS can initiate a chain reaction, 
along with the autophagy process that helps maintain ROS balance by discarding 
unnecessary materials. At present, there is no effective treatment for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disease. The use of 
NMs for siRNA delivery could become a promising treatment for AD and other CNS 
disorders. Recent research demonstrates that the use of combined NPs can induce 
autophagy in cells. This article emphasizes the importance of the shape of 
siRNA-encapsulated NMs in determining their efficiency in delivering and 
suppressing gene activity in the central nervous system. Because of its strict 
selectivity against foreign substances, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) 
significantly hinders the delivery of therapeutic agents to the brain. 
Conventional chemotherapeutic drugs are significantly less effective against 
brain cancers due to this limitation. As a result, NMs have become a promising 
approach for targeted drug delivery, as they can be modified to carry specific 
ligands that direct them to their intended targets. This review thoroughly 
examines the latest breakthroughs in using NMs to deliver bioactive compounds 
across the BBB, focusing on their use in cancer treatments. The review starts by 
examining the structure and functions of the BBB and BBTB, and then emphasizes 
the benefits that NMs offer.

Background and Objectives: Rosiridin is a monoterpene with outstanding monoamine 
inhibitory activity that is useful to treat depressive episodes and rapid-onset 
dementia. The current investigation aims to evaluate the neurologically 
protective impact of rosiridin, which opposes aluminum chloride (AlCl3) and 
causes memory dysfunction in rats. Materials and Methods: Memory impairment was 
developed in Wistar rats by administering AlCl3 (100 mg/kg p.o.) orally for 42 
days and then supplemented with rosiridin at 10 and 20 mg/kg/p.o. Upon 
completion of the investigation, the behavior factor was performed utilizing the 
Y-maze, Morris Water Maze, and open field tests. Estimating numerous biological 
factors, such as nitric oxide (NO), oxidative stress (malondialdehyde MDA), 
acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase levels (BuChE), antioxidants 
(glutathione GSH, catalase CAT, and superoxide dismutases SODs) and 
neurotransmitter (serotonin-5HT, dopamine-DA, acetylcholine-Ach) in the brain. 
Furthermore, interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), 
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BNDF), nuclear factor kappa B (NFᴋB), 
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and pAkt were assessed in the diffused 
brain cells. Results: The rosiridin-treated group significantly improved in 
terms of behavioral parameters, including in the Y-maze, Morris Water Maze, and 
open field tests. Further, rosiridin restored biochemical parameters, including 
NO, oxidative stress AChE, BuChE, antioxidants, neurotransmitters, IL-6, IL-1β, 
TNF-α, BNDF, NFᴋB, PI3K, and pAkt compared to AlCl3. Conclusions: The current 
investigation reveals that rosiridin could ameliorate the impairment of memory 
that AlCl3 causes in rats via improvements in behavioral and restored 
biochemical parameters.

Background and Objectives: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common 
neurodegenerative disorder in the world. Due to failure of the traditional drugs 
to produce a complete cure for AD, the search for new safe and effective lines 
of therapy has attracted the attention of ongoing research. Canagliflozin is an 
anti-diabetic agent with proven efficacy in the treatment of neurological 
disorders in which mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and 
autophagy play a pathophysiological role. Elucidation of the potential effects 
of different doses of canagliflozin on AD induced by aluminium chloride in rats 
and exploration of the molecular mechanisms that may contribute to these effects 
were the primary objectives of the current study. Materials and Methods: In a 
rat model of AD, the effect of three different doses of canagliflozin on the 
behavioural, biochemical, and histopathological alterations induced by aluminium 
chloride was assessed. Results: Canagliflozin administered to aluminium 
chloride-treated animals induced dose-dependent normalisation in the behavioural 
tests, augmentation of the antioxidant defence mechanisms, inhibition of 
TXNIP/NLRP3 inflammasome signalling, modulation of the SIRT1/HMGB1 axis, 
interference with the pro-inflammatory and the pro-apoptotic mechanisms, and 
restoration of the mitochondrial functions and autophagy in the hippocampal 
tissues to approximately baseline values. In addition, canagliflozin exhibited 
an interesting dose-dependent ability to repress aluminium chloride-induced 
histopathological changes in the brain. Conclusions: The effects of 
canagliflozin on oxidative stress, mitochondrial functions, inflammatory 
pathways, and autophagy signals may open new gates towards the mitigation of the 
pathologic features of AD.

Background: Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is the leading genetic risk factor for 
late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is the leading cause of dementia 
worldwide. Most people have two ApoE-ε3 (ApoE3) alleles, while ApoE-ε2 (ApoE2) 
is protective from AD, and ApoE-ε4 (ApoE4) confers AD risk. How these alleles 
modulate AD risk is not clearly defined, and ApoE's role in lipid metabolism is 
also not fully known. Lipid droplets increase in AD. However, how ApoE 
contributes to lipid accumulation in the brain remains unknown. Methods: Here, 
we use Drosophila to study the effects of ApoE alleles on lipid accumulation in 
the brain and muscle in a cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous manner. 
Results: We report that pan-neuronal expression of each ApoE allele induces 
lipid accumulation specifically in the brain, but not in the muscle. However, 
this was not the case when expressed with muscle-specific drivers. ApoE2- and 
ApoE3-induced lipid accumulation is dependent on the expression of Dgat2, a key 
regulator of triacylglycerol production, while ApoE4 still induces lipid 
accumulation even with knock-down of Dgat2. Additionally, we find that 
implementation of time-restricted feeding (TRF), a dietary intervention in which 
food access only occurs in the active period (day), prevents ApoE-induced lipid 
accumulation in the brain of flies and modulates lipid metabolism genes. 
Conclusions: Altogether, our results demonstrate that ApoE induces lipid 
accumulation in the brain, that ApoE4 is unique in causing lipid accumulation 
independent of Dgat2, and that TRF prevents ApoE-induced lipid accumulation. 
These results support the idea that lipid metabolism is critical in AD, and that 
TRF could be a promising therapeutic approach to prevent ApoE-associated 
dysfunction in lipid metabolism.

The present review investigates the relationship between polyunsaturated fatty 
acids (PUFAs) and mental health disorders, such as dementia, psychosis, 
schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, anorexia nervosa, and impairment problems in 
animals and human models. Data were collected from a variety of studies: 
randomized intervention trials, observational and interventional studies, case 
reports, and epidemiological studies. The evidence suggests that PUFAs are 
beneficial for mental health, brain function, and behavior. ALA, EPA, and DHA 
have very significant neuroprotective properties, particularly in inducing 
changes to the synaptic membrane and modulating brain cell signaling. In the 
case of neurodegenerative disorders, PUFAs incorporated into cellular membranes 
have been shown to protect against cell atrophy and death. The formal analyses 
of the included studies pointed to a decrease in ALA, EPA, and DHA levels in 
various populations (e.g., children, adolescents, adults, and seniors) 
presenting with different types of mental disorders. These results indicate that 
PUFA supplementation may be considered as an innovative therapeutic strategy to 
reduce the risk of neuronal degeneration.

The abnormal deposition and intercellular propagation of disease-specific 
protein play a central role in the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative 
disorders. Recent studies share the common observation that the formation of 
protein oligomers and subsequent pathological filaments is an essential step for 
the disease. Synucleinopathies such as Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with 
Lewy bodies (DLB) or multiple system atrophy (MSA) are neurodegenerative 
diseases characterized by the aggregation of the α-synucleinprotein in neurons 
and/or in oligodendrocytes (glial cytoplasmic inclusions), neuronal loss, and 
astrogliosis. A similar mechanism of protein Tau-dependent neurodegeneration is 
a major feature of tauopathies, represented by Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
corticobasal degeneration (CBD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and 
Pick's disease (PD). The specific inhibition of the protein misfolding and their 
interneuronal spreading represents a promising therapeutic strategy against both 
disease pathology and progression. The most recent research focuses on finding 
potential applications targeting the pathological forms of proteins responsible 
for neurodegeneration. This review highlights the mechanisms relevant to 
protein-dependent neurodegeneration based on the most common disorders and 
describes current therapeutic approaches targeting protein misfolding and 
aggregation.

Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by 
mitochondria dysfunction, accumulation of beta-amyloid plaques, and 
hyperphosphorylated tau tangles in the brain leading to memory loss and 
cognitive deficits. There is currently no cure for this condition, but the 
potential of stem cells for the therapy of neurodegenerative pathologies is 
actively being researched. This review discusses preclinical and clinical 
studies that have used mouse models and human patients to investigate the use of 
novel types of stem cell treatment approaches. The findings provide valuable 
insights into the applications of stem cell-based therapies and include the use 
of neural, glial, mesenchymal, embryonic, and induced pluripotent stem cells. We 
cover current studies on stem cell replacement therapy where cells can 
functionally integrate into neural networks, replace damaged neurons, and 
strengthen impaired synaptic circuits in the brain. We address the paracrine 
action of stem cells acting via secreted factors to induce neuroregeneration and 
modify inflammatory responses. We focus on the neuroprotective functions of 
exosomes as well as their neurogenic and synaptogenic effects. We look into the 
shuttling of mitochondria through tunneling nanotubes that enables the transfer 
of healthy mitochondria by restoring the normal functioning of damaged cells, 
improving their metabolism, and reducing the level of apoptosis.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), a multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by severe cognitive impairment, affects millions of people 
worldwide. However, AD therapy remains limited and mainly symptomatic-focused, 
with acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors being the major available drugs. 
Thus, AD is considered by the WHO as a disorder of public health priority. Among 
several strategies that have been identified to combat AD, the use of natural 
multi-target drug ligands (MTDLs) appears to be a promising approach. In this 
context, we previously found that the essential oils (EOs), obtained via 
hydrodistillation, from Azorean Cryptomeria japonica sawdust (CJS) and 
resin-rich bark (CJRRB) were able to exert antioxidant activity via different 
mechanisms of action. Therefore, in the present work, these EOs were screened 
for their (i) in vitro anti-AChE and anti-butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) 
activities, evaluated by a modified Ellman's assay; (ii) in vitro 
anti-inflammatory potential, using the albumin denaturation method; and (iii) 
toxicity against Artemia salina. The CJRRB-EO exhibited both anti-AChE and 
anti-BChE activities (IC50: 1935 and 600 µg/mL, respectively), whereas the 
CJS-EO only displayed anti-BChE activity, but it was 3.77-fold higher than that 
of the CJRRB-EO. Molecular docking suggested that α-pinene and ferruginol 
compounds contributed to the anti-AChE and anti-BChE activities, respectively. 
Moreover, the anti-inflammatory activity of the CJS-EO, the CJRRB-EO, and 
diclofenac was 51%, 70%, and 59% (at a concentration of only 2.21 μg/mL), 
respectively, with the latter two presenting comparable activity. Concerning the 
EOs' potential toxicity, the CJRRB-EO exhibited a lower effect than the CJS-EO 
(LC50: 313 and 73 µg/mL, respectively). Overall, the EOs from C. japonica 
biomass residues, chiefly the CJRRB-EO, displayed antioxidant, 
anticholinesterase, and anti-inflammatory activities in a 
concentration-dependent manner. These properties demonstrate that these residues 
may be suitable natural MTDLs for AD complementary therapy when administered 
through aromatherapy, or, alternatively, could serve as low-cost sources of 
valuable ingredients, such as α-pinene.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a global health concern and the leading cause of 
dementia in the elderly. The prevalence of this neurodegenerative condition is 
projected to increase concomitantly with increased life expectancy, resulting in 
a significant economic burden. With very few FDA-approved disease-modifying 
drugs available for AD, there is an urgent need to develop new compounds capable 
of impeding the progression of the disease. Given the unclear etiopathogenesis 
of AD, this review emphasizes the underlying mechanisms of this condition. It 
explores not only well-studied aspects, such as the accumulation of Aβ plaques 
and neurofibrillary tangles, but also novel areas, including glymphatic and 
lymphatic pathways, microbiota and the gut-brain axis, serotoninergic and 
autophagy alterations, vascular dysfunction, the metal hypothesis, the olfactory 
pathway, and oral health. Furthermore, the potential molecular targets arising 
from all these mechanisms have been reviewed, along with novel promising 
approaches such as nanoparticle-based therapy, neural stem cell transplantation, 
vaccines, and CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing techniques. Taking into 
account the overlap of these various mechanisms, individual and combination 
therapies emerge as the future direction in the AD strategy.

Oxidative stress is linked to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a 
neurodegenerative disorder marked by memory impairment and cognitive decline. AD 
is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and the 
formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) of hyperphosphorylated tau. AD is 
associated with an imbalance in redox states and excessive reactive oxygen 
species (ROS). Recent studies report that NADPH oxidase (NOX) enzymes are 
significant contributors to ROS generation in neurodegenerative diseases, 
including AD. NOX-derived ROS aggravates oxidative stress and neuroinflammation 
during AD. In this review, we provide the potential role of all NOX isoforms in 
AD pathogenesis and their respective structural involvement in AD progression, 
highlighting NOX enzymes as a strategic therapeutic target. A comprehensive 
understanding of NOX isoforms and their inhibitors could provide valuable 
insights into AD pathology and aid in the development of targeted treatments for 
AD.

Optogenetics is a combination of optical and genetic technologies used to 
activate or, conversely, inhibit specific cells in living tissues. The 
possibilities of using optogenetics approaches for the treatment of epilepsy, 
Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are being actively researched. In 
recent years, it has become clear that one of the most important players in the 
development of AD is astrocytes. Astrocytes affect amyloid clearance, 
participate in the development of neuroinflammation, and regulate the 
functioning of neural networks. We used an adeno-associated virus carrying the 
glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) promoter driving the optogenetic 
channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) gene to transduce astrocytes in primary mouse 
hippocampal cultures. We recorded the bioelectrical activity of neural networks 
from day 14 to day 21 of cultivation using multielectrode arrays. A single 
optogenetic stimulation of astrocytes at 14 day of cultivation (DIV14) did not 
cause significant changes in neural network bioelectrical activity. Chronic 
optogenetic stimulation from DIV14 to DIV21 exerts a stimulatory effect on the 
bioelectrical activity of primary hippocampal cultures (the proportion of spikes 
included in network bursts significantly increased since DIV19). Moreover, 
chronic optogenetic stimulation over seven days partially preserved the activity 
and functional architecture of neuronal network in amyloidosis modeling. These 
results suggest that the selective optogenetic activation of astrocytes may 
represent a promising novel therapeutic strategy for combating AD.

Endocannabinoids have attracted great interest for their ability to counteract 
the neuroinflammation underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our study aimed at 
evaluating whether this activity was also due to a rebalance of autophagic 
mechanisms in cellular and animal models of AD. We supplied URB597, an inhibitor 
of Fatty-Acid Amide Hydrolase (FAAH), the degradation enzyme of anandamide, to 
microglial cultures treated with Aβ25-35, and to Tg2576 transgenic mice, thus 
increasing the endocannabinoid tone. The addition of URB597 did not alter cell 
viability and induced microglia polarization toward an anti-inflammatory 
phenotype, as shown by the modulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, 
as well as M1 and M2 markers; moreover microglia, after URB597 treatment 
released higher levels of Bdnf and Nrf2, confirming the protective role 
underlying endocannabinoids increase, as shown by RT-PCR and immunofluorescence 
experiments. We assessed the number and area of amyloid plaques in animals 
administered with URB597 compared to untreated animals and the expression of 
autophagy key markers in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex from both groups 
of mice, via immunohistochemistry and ELISA. After URB597 supply, we detected a 
reduction in the number and areas of amyloid plaques, as detected by Congo Red 
staining and a reshaping of microglia activation as shown by M1 and M2 markers' 
modulation. URB597 administration restored autophagy in Tg2576 mice via an 
increase in BECN1 (Beclin1), ATG7 (Autophagy Related 7), LC3 (light chain 3) and 
SQSTM1/p62 (sequestrome 1) as well as via the activation of the ULK1 (Unc-51 
Like Autophagy Activating Kinase 1) signaling pathway, suggesting that it 
targets mTOR/ULK1-dependent autophagy pathway. The potential of endocannabinoids 
to rebalance autophagy machinery may be considered as a new perspective for 
therapeutic intervention in AD.

Natural caffeine is found in many plants, including coffee beans, cacao beans, 
and tea leaves. Around the world, many beverages, including coffee, tea, energy 
drinks, and some soft drinks, have this natural caffeine compound. This paper 
reviewed the results of meta-studies on caffeine's effects on chronic diseases. 
Of importance, many meta-studies have shown that regularly drinking caffeine or 
caffeinated coffee significantly reduces the risk of developing Alzheimer's 
disease, epilepsy, and Parkinson's disease. Based on the health supplements of 
caffeine, this review summarizes various aspects related to the application of 
caffeine, including its pharmacokinetics, and various functional health benefits 
of caffeine, such as its effects on the central nervous system. The importance 
of caffeine and its use in alleviating or treating cancer, diabetes, eye 
diseases, autoimmune diseases, and cardiovascular diseases is also discussed. 
Overall, consuming caffeine daily in drinks containing antioxidant and 
neuroprotective properties, such as coffee, prevents progressive 
neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Furthermore, to 
effectively deliver caffeine to the body, recently developed nanoformulations 
using caffeine, for instance, nanoparticles, liposomes, etc., are summarized 
along with regulatory and safety considerations for caffeine. The U.S. 
Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
recommended that healthy adults consume up to 400 mg of caffeine per day or 5~6 
mg/kg body weight. Since a cup of coffee contains, on average, 100 to 150 mg of 
coffee, 1 to 3 cups of coffee may help prevent chronic diseases. Furthermore, 
this review summarizes various interesting and important areas of research on 
caffeine and its applications related to human health.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are two prevalent 
conditions that present considerable public health issue in aging populations 
worldwide. Recent research has proposed a novel conceptualization of AD as "type 
3 diabetes", highlighting the critical roles of insulin resistance and impaired 
glucose metabolism in the pathogenesis of the disease. This article examines the 
implications of this association, exploring potential new avenues for treatment 
and preventive strategies for AD. Key evidence linking diabetes to AD emphasizes 
critical metabolic processes that contribute to neurodegeneration, including 
inflammation, oxidative stress, and alterations in insulin signaling pathways. 
By framing AD within this metabolic context, we can enhance our understanding of 
its etiology, which in turn may influence early diagnosis, treatment plans, and 
preventive measures. Understanding AD as a manifestation of diabetes opens up 
the possibility of employing novel therapeutic strategies that incorporate 
lifestyle modifications and the use of antidiabetic medications to mitigate 
cognitive decline. This integrated approach has the potential to improve patient 
outcomes and deepen our comprehension of the intricate relationship between 
neurodegenerative diseases and metabolic disorders.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a kind of neurodegenerative diseases characterized 
by beta-amyloid deposition and neurofibrillary tangles and is also the main 
cause of dementia. According to statistics, the incidence of AD is constantly 
increasing, bringing a great burden to individuals and society. Nonetheless, 
there is no cure for AD, and the available drugs are very limited apart from 
cholinesterase inhibitors and N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) antagonists, which 
merely alleviate symptoms without delaying the progression of the disease. 
Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a medicine that can delay the 
progression of AD or cure it. In recent years, increasing evidence suggests that 
metal complexes have the enormous potential to treat AD through inhibiting the 
aggregation and cytotoxicity of Aβ, interfering with the congregation and 
hyperphosphorylation of tau, regulating dysfunctional synaptic and unbalanced 
neurotransmitters, etc. In this review, we summarize the current metal complexes 
and their mechanisms of action for treating AD, including ruthenium, platinum, 
zinc, vanadium, copper, magnesium, and other complexes.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2D), and Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) are pathologies that affect millions of people worldwide. They have no 
effective therapy and are difficult to prevent and control when they develop. It 
has been known for many years that these diseases have many pathogenic aspects 
in common. We highlight in this review that neuroglial cells (astroglia, 
oligodendroglia, and microglia) play a vital role in the origin, 
clinical-pathological development, and course of brain neurodegeneration. 
Moreover, we include the new results of a T2D-AD mouse model (APP+PS1 mice on a 
high-calorie diet) that we are investigating.
METHODS: Critical bibliographic revision and biochemical neuropathological study 
of neuroglia in a T2D-AD model.
RESULTS: T2D and AD are not only "connected" by producing complex pathologies in 
the same individual (obesity, T2D, and AD), but they also have many common 
pathogenic mechanisms. These include insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, 
hyperglycemia, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammation 
(both peripheral and central-or neuroinflammation). Cognitive impairment and AD 
are the maximum exponents of brain neurodegeneration in these pathological 
processes. both due to the dysfunctions induced by metabolic changes in 
peripheral tissues and inadequate neurotoxic responses to changes in the brain. 
In this review, we first analyze the common pathogenic mechanisms of obesity, 
T2D, and AD (and/or cerebral vascular dementia) that induce transcendental 
changes and responses in neuroglia. The relationships between T2D and AD 
discussed mainly focus on neuroglial responses. Next, we present neuroglial 
changes within their neuropathological context in diverse scenarios: (a) aging 
involution and neurodegenerative disorders, (b) human obesity and diabetes and 
obesity/diabetes models, (c) human AD and in AD models, and (d) human AD-T2D and 
AD-T2D models. An important part of the data presented comes from our own 
studies on humans and experimental models over the past few years. In the T2D-AD 
section, we included the results of a T2D-AD mouse model (APP+PS1 mice on a 
high-calorie diet) that we investigated, which showed that neuroglial 
dysfunctions (astrocytosis and microgliosis) manifest before the appearance of 
amyloid neuropathology, and that the amyloid pathology is greater than that 
presented by mice fed a normal, non-high-caloric diet A broad review is finally 
included on pharmacological, cellular, genic, and non-pharmacological 
(especially diet and lifestyle) neuroglial-related treatments, as well as 
clinical trials in a comparative way between T2D and AD. These neuroglial 
treatments need to be included in the multimodal/integral treatments of T2D and 
AD to achieve greater therapeutic efficacy in many millions of patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Neuroglial alterations (especially in astroglia and microglia, 
cornerstones of neuroinflammation) are markedly defining brain neurodegeneration 
in T2D and A, although there are some not significant differences between each 
of the studied pathologies. Neuroglial therapies are a very important and p. 
promising tool that are being developed to prevent and/or treat brain 
dysfunction in T2D-AD. The need for further research in two very different 
directions is evident: (a) characterization of the phenotypic changes of 
astrocytes and microglial cells in each region of the brain and in each phase of 
development of each isolated and associated pathology (single-cell studies are 
mandatory) to better understand the pathologies and define new therapeutic 
targets; (b) studying new therapeutic avenues to normalize the function of 
neuroglial cells (preventing neurotoxic responses and/or reversing them) in 
these pathologies, as well as the phenotypic characteristics in each moment of 
the course and place of the neurodegenerative process.

(1) Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) accounts for 70% of dementia cases and 
with no effective pharmacological treatments, new rehabilitation methods are 
needed. Motor and cognitive activities and transcranial direct current 
stimulation (tDCS) have shown promise in stabilizing and enhancing cognitive 
functions. Objective: we want to investigate the effects of tDCS combined with 
motor or cognitive activity on cognitive functions in AD patients. (2) Methods: 
Patients with mild or moderate AD were randomized between anodic tDCS groups 
(MotA or CogA) and sham tDCS groups (MotS or CogS). They received two weeks of 
treatment (45 min, five days/week), with the first 15 min using tDCS stimulation 
on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Cognitive assessments were conducted 
pre-treatment (T0), post-treatment (T1), and one week after (T2). (3) Results: 
Twenty-three patients were included. Statistical analysis showed significant 
differences between anodic tDCS groups (MotA + CogA) and sham tDCS groups (MotS 
+ CogS) with advantages for the first in improving global cognitive status (p = 
0.042), selective attention (p = 0.012), and sustained attention (p = 0.012). 
Further analysis indicated no differences between the two anodic tDCS groups 
between T0 and T1. (4) Conclusions: combined anodal tDCS with motor or cognitive 
activity could improve global cognitive state and attention, slowing cognitive 
decline in AD patients. The trial was registered on Clinical Trials: 
NCT06619795.

Down syndrome (DS) is a genetic disorder caused by an extra copy of chromosome 
21 (trisomy 21 or T21) and is associated with an increased risk of early-onset 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), also known as DS-associated AD (DSAD). Individuals 
with DS typically develop amyloid neuropathology in their late-thirties to 
early-forties and the mean age of onset of clinical dementia is approximately 55 
years. Recent advances in AD clinical research have focused on monoclonal 
antibodies (mAbs) targeting amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques as a potential therapeutic 
approach. Therefore, there has been guarded enthusiasm about using anti-amyloid 
mAbs in the prevention/treatment of DSAD. This narrative review and perspective 
explores the current understanding of amyloid pathology in AD and DSAD, the 
rationale for using anti-amyloid mAbs in the treatment of DSAD, and the 
challenges and opportunities for research toward the application of this 
therapeutic strategy to older adults with DS.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent form of dementia, is a 
leading neurodegenerative disorder currently affecting approximately 55 million 
individuals globally, a number projected to escalate to 139 million by 2050. 
Despite extensive research spanning several decades, the cure for AD remains at 
a developing stage. The only existing therapeutic options are limited to symptom 
management, and are often accompanied by adverse side effects. The pathological 
features of AD, including the accumulation of beta-amyloid plaques and tau 
protein tangles, result in progressive neuronal death, synaptic loss, and brain 
atrophy, leading to significant cognitive decline and a marked reduction in 
quality of life.
OBJECTIVE: In light of the shortcomings of existing pharmacological 
interventions, this review explores the potential of photobiomodulation (PBM) as 
a non-invasive therapeutic option for AD. PBM employs infrared light to 
facilitate cellular repair and regeneration, focusing on addressing the 
disease's underlying biomechanical mechanisms.
METHOD: This paper presents a comprehensive introduction to the mechanisms of 
PBM and an analysis of preclinical studies evaluating its impact on cellular 
health, cognitive function, and disease progression in AD.The review provides a 
comprehensive overview of the various wavelengths and application methods, 
evaluating their efficacy in mitigating AD-related symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings underscore the significant potential of PBM as a safe 
and effective alternative treatment for Alzheimer's disease, emphasizing the 
necessity for further research and clinical trials to establish its therapeutic 
efficacy conclusively.

The inexorable progression of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), including 
Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis, is closely related to irreversible 
brain decline. Accurately characterizing pathophysiological features and 
identifying reliable biomarkers for early diagnosis and optimized treatment are 
critical. Hindered by the blood-brain barrier (BBB), obtaining sensitive 
monitoring indicators for disease progression and achieving efficient drug 
delivery remain significant challenges. Exosomes, endogenous nanoscale vesicles 
that carry key bioactive substances, reflect the intracellular environment and 
play an important role in cell signaling. They have shown promise in traversing 
the BBB, serving dual roles as potential biomarkers for NDs and vehicles for 
targeted drug delivery. However, the specific mechanisms by which exosome 
influence NDs are not fully understood, necessitating further investigation into 
their attributes and functionalities in the context of NDs. This review explores 
how exosomes mediate multifaceted interactions, particularly in exacerbating 
pathogenic processes such as oxidative stress, neuronal dysfunction, and 
apoptosis integral to NDs. It provides a comprehensive analysis of the profound 
impact of exosomes under stress and disease states, assessing their prospective 
utility as biomarkers and drug delivery vectors, offering new perspectives for 
tackling these challenging diseases.

In previous research, 1,2,3-triazolium salts showed significant biological 
activity as potential inhibitors of cholinesterase enzymes (ChEs), which are 
crucial for neurotransmission. In this research, pairs of uncharged 
thienobenzo-triazoles and their charged salts were prepared in order to further 
examine the role of the positive charge on the nitrogen of the triazole ring in 
interactions within the active site of the enzymes, and to compare the 
selectivity of 1,2,3-triazolium salts in relation to their uncharged analogs 
obtained by photochemical cyclization. Neutral thienobenzo-triazoles showed very 
good selective activity toward butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), while their salts 
showed excellent non-selective inhibition toward both BChE (the most active 23: 
IC50 0.47 μM) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzymes (the most active 23: IC50 
4.4 μM). These new structures with incorporated 1,2,3-triazolium salts present 
the new scaffold for drug development as it is known that the current therapy in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) comprises selective AChE inhibitors, while in 
Parkinson's and all stages of AD, non-selective inhibitors of ChEs are 
preferred. Molecular docking of the selected compounds and their corresponding 
salts into the active sites of ChEs was conducted to identify the interactions 
responsible for the stability of the non-covalent cholinesterase-ligand 
complexes. As genotoxicity studies are crucial when developing new active 
substances and finished drug forms, in silico studies for all the synthesized 
compounds have shown that compound 18 is the most promising candidate for 
genotoxic safety.

The gut microbiota is a complex ecosystem that influences digestion, immune 
response, metabolism, and has been linked to health and well-being. Choline is 
essential for neurotransmitters, lipid transport, cell-membrane signaling, 
methyl-group metabolism and is believed to have neuroprotective properties. It 
is found in two forms, water-soluble and lipid-soluble, and its metabolism is 
different. Long-term choline deficiency is associated with many diseases, and 
supplements are prescribed for improved health. Choline supplements can improve 
cognitive function in adults but not significantly. Choline is a precursor of 
phospholipids and an acetylcholine neurotransmitter precursor and can be 
generated de novo from phosphatidylcholine via 
phosphatidylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase and choline oxidase. Choline 
supplementation has been found to have a beneficial effect on patients with 
neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), by increasing 
amyloid-β, thioflavin S, and tau hyper-phosphorylation. Choline supplementation 
has been shown to reduce amyloid-plaque load and develop spatial memory in an 
APP/PS1 mice model of AD. Choline is necessary for normative and improved 
function of brain pathways and can reduce amyloid-β deposition and microgliosis. 
Clinical research suggests that early neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) can 
benefit from a combination of choline supplements and the drugs currently used 
to treat NDs in order to improve memory performance and synaptic functioning.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is an irreversible, progressive syndrome characterized 
by neurocognitive impairment. Two neuropathological features seen in AD are 
extracellular amyloid plaques consisting of amyloid beta1-40 and 1-42, and 
intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). For decades, neuroscience research 
has heavily focused on seeking to understand the primary mechanism of AD and 
searching for pharmacological approaches for the treatment of dementia. Three 
monoclonal antibodies that act against amyloid beta-aducanumab, lecanemab, and 
donanemab-have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the 
treatment of mild cognitive impairment and mild AD, in addition to medications 
for cognitive symptom management such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and the 
N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist. Further trials should focus on the 
combination of therapies targeting amyloid plaques and tau pathology.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) methods have become exciting techniques 
for altering brain activity and improving synaptic plasticity, earning 
recognition as valuable non-medicine treatments for a wide range of neurological 
disorders. Among these methods, repetitive TMS (rTMS) and theta-burst 
stimulation (TBS) show significant promise in improving outcomes for adults with 
complex neurological and neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer's 
disease, stroke, Parkinson's disease, etc. However, optimizing their effects 
remains a challenge due to variability in how patients respond and a limited 
understanding of how these techniques interact with crucial neurotransmitter 
systems. This narrative review explores the mechanisms of rTMS and TBS, which 
enhance neuroplasticity and functional improvement. We specifically focus on 
their effects on GABAergic and glutamatergic pathways and how they interact with 
key receptors like N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) and AMPA receptors, which play 
essential roles in processes like long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term 
depression (LTD). Additionally, we investigate how rTMS and TBS impact 
neuroplasticity and functional connectivity, particularly concerning 
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and tropomyosin-related kinase receptor 
type B (TrkB). Here, we highlight the significant potential of this research to 
expand our understanding of neuroplasticity and better treatment outcomes for 
patients. Through clarifying the neurobiology mechanisms behind rTMS and TBS 
with neuroimaging findings, we aim to develop more effective, personalized 
treatment plans that effectively address the challenges posed by neurological 
disorders and ultimately enhance the quality of neurorehabilitation services and 
provide future directions for patients' care.

Background: Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), a widely used industrial 
chemical, was reported to induce memory and learning process dysfunction. Some 
studies tried to reveal the mechanisms that mediate these effects, but how they 
are produced is still unknown. Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCN) 
maintain cognitive function and their selective neurodegeneration induces 
cognitive decline, as observed in Alzheimer's disease. PFOS was reported to 
disrupt cholinergic and glutamatergic transmissions and thyroid hormone action, 
which regulate cognitive processes and maintain BFCN viability. 
Objective/Methods: To evaluate PFOS neurodegenerative effects on BFCN and the 
mechanisms that mediate them, SN56 cells (a neuroblastoma cholinergic cell line 
from the basal forebrain) were treated with PFOS (0.1 µM to 40 µM) with or 
without thyroxine (T3; 15 nM), MK-801 (20 µM) or acetylcholine (ACh; 10 µM). 
Results: In the present study, we found that PFOS treatment (1 or 14 days) 
decreased thyroid receptor α (TRα) activity by decreasing its protein levels and 
increased T3 metabolism through increased deiodinase 3 (D3) levels. Further, we 
observed that PFOS treatment disrupted cholinergic transmission by decreasing 
ACh content through decreased choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity and 
protein levels and through decreasing muscarinic receptor 1 (M1R) binding and 
protein levels. PFOS also disrupted glutamatergic transmission by decreasing 
glutamate content through increased glutaminase activity and protein levels and 
through decreasing N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit 1 (NMDAR1); effects 
mediated through M1R disruption. All these effects were mediated through 
decreased T3 activity and T3 supplementation partially restored to the normal 
state. Conclusions: These findings may assist in understanding how PFOS induces 
neurodegeneration, and the mechanisms involved, especially in BFCN, to explain 
the process that could lead to cognitive dysfunction and provide new therapeutic 
tools to treat and prevent its neurotoxic effects.

Abnormal EEG Effects of Acute Apomorphine Injection in 5xFAD Transgenic Mice Are 
Partially Normalized in Those Chronically Pretreated with Apomorphine: The 
Time-Frequency Clustering of EEG Spectra.

BACKGROUND: In experimental and clinical studies of pharmacological treatments 
for Alzheimer's disease (AD), the electroencephalogram (EEG) frequency spectrum 
approach has demonstrated its efficacy in determining the characteristics of 
pathological changes in the functioning of different cerebral structures, 
interconnections between them, and disturbances in the brain neurotransmitter 
systems. The main results have been obtained in frames of traditionally used 
so-called "classical" EEG frequency bands: delta, theta, alpha, and beta.
OBJECTIVE: This unified approach simplifies comparing data from different 
studies but loses the dynamic peculiarities of the effects because of their 
time-dependent transition through the borders of the "classical" bands.
METHODS: In this study on non-narcotized freely moving 5xFAD transgenic mice, a 
model of AD, chronically pretreated with a non-selective dopamine (DA) receptor 
agonist, apomorphine (APO), we analyze the transitory EEG effects of acute APO 
injection in different brain areas by use of our "time-frequency" clustering 
program. The acute injection of APO was used to compare DA receptor sensitivity 
in 5xFAD mice pretreated with either APO or saline vs. wild-type (WT) mice 
pretreated with saline.
RESULTS: After acute APO injection, the clusters of enhanced EEG activity 
centered in the theta-alpha frequency range observed in WT mice disappeared in 
5xFAD mice pretreated with saline and practically recovered in 5xFAD mice 
pretreated with APO.
CONCLUSIONS: In 5xFAD mice pretreated with saline, the sensitivity of DA 
receptors was disturbed; chronic APO pretreatment mainly recovered this 
characteristic in 5xFAD mice. The "clustering" of pharmacological EEG effects 
and their time-dependent transition between classical frequency bands is a new 
effective approach for analyzing cerebral neurotransmission in neurodegenerative 
pathologies.

The clinical spectrum of Alzheimer's disease (AD) ranges dynamically from 
asymptomatic and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to mild, moderate, or severe 
AD. Although a few disease-modifying treatments, such as lecanemab and 
donanemab, have been developed, current therapies can only delay disease 
progression rather than halt it entirely. Therefore, the early detection of MCI 
and the identification of MCI patients at high risk of progression to AD remain 
urgent unmet needs in the super-aged era. This study utilized transcriptomics 
data from cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals, MCI, and AD patients in the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort and leveraged machine 
learning models to identify biomarkers that differentiate MCI from CU and also 
distinguish AD from MCI individuals. Furthermore, Cox proportional hazards 
analysis was conducted to identify biomarkers predictive of the progression from 
MCI to AD. Our machine learning models identified a unique set of gene 
expression profiles capable of achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.98 
in distinguishing those with MCI from CU individuals. A subset of these 
biomarkers was also found to be significantly associated with the risk of 
progression from MCI to AD. A linear mixed model demonstrated that plasma tau 
phosphorylated at threonine 181 (pTau181) and neurofilament light chain (NFL) 
exhibit the prognostic value in predicting cognitive decline longitudinally. 
These findings underscore the potential of integrating machine learning (ML) 
with transcriptomic profiling in the early detection and prognostication of AD. 
This integrated approach could facilitate the development of novel diagnostic 
tools and therapeutic strategies aimed at delaying or preventing the onset of AD 
in at-risk individuals. Future studies should focus on validating these 
biomarkers in larger, independent cohorts and further investigating their roles 
in AD pathogenesis.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects a significant portion of the aging 
population, presenting a serious challenge due to the limited availability of 
effective therapies during its progression. The disease advances rapidly, 
underscoring the need for early diagnosis and the application of preventative 
measures. Current diagnostic methods for AD are often expensive and invasive, 
restricting access for the general public. One potential solution is the use of 
biomarkers, which can facilitate early detection and treatment through 
objective, non-invasive, and cost-effective evaluations of AD. This review 
critically investigates the function and role of biofluid biomarkers in 
detecting AD, with a specific focus on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), blood-based, 
and saliva biomarkers.
RESULTS: CSF biomarkers have demonstrated potential for accurate diagnosis and 
valuable prognostic insights, while blood biomarkers offer a minimally invasive 
and cost-effective approach for diagnosing cognitive issues. However, while 
current biomarkers for AD show significant potential, none have yet achieved the 
precision needed to replace expensive PET scans and CSF assays. The lack of a 
single accurate biomarker underscores the need for further research to identify 
novel or combined biomarkers to enhance the clinical efficacy of existing 
diagnostic tests. In this context, artificial intelligence (AI) and 
deep-learning (DL) tools present promising avenues for improving biomarker 
analysis and interpretation, enabling more precise and timely diagnoses.
CONCLUSIONS: Further research is essential to confirm the utility of all AD 
biomarkers in clinical settings. Combining biomarker data with AI tools offers a 
promising path toward revolutionizing the personalized characterization and 
early diagnosis of AD symptoms.

The disorder and heterogeneity of low-molecular-weight amyloid-beta oligomers 
(AβOs) underlie their participation in multiple modes of cellular dysfunction 
associated with the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The lack of specified 
conformational states in these species complicates efforts to select or design 
small molecules to targeting discrete pathogenic states. Furthermore, targeting 
AβOs alone may be therapeutically insufficient, as AD progresses as a 
multifactorial, self-amplifying cascade. To address these challenges, we have 
screened the activity of seven new candidates that serve as Paramagnetic Amyloid 
Ligand (PAL) candidates. PALs are bifunctional small molecules that both remodel 
the AβO structure and localize a potent antioxidant that mimics the activity of 
SOD within live cells. The candidates are built from either a stilbene or 
curcumin scaffold with nitroxyl moiety to serve as catalytic antioxidants. 
Measurements of PAL AβO binding and remolding along with assessments of 
bioactivity allow for the extraction of useful SAR information from screening 
data. One candidate (HO-4450; PMT-307), with a six-membered nitroxyl ring 
attached to a stilbene ring, displays the highest potency in protecting against 
cell-derived Aβ. A preliminary low-dose evaluation in AD model mice provides 
evidence of modest treatment effects by HO-4450. The results for the curcumin 
PALs demonstrate that the retention of the native curcumin phenolic groups is 
advantageous to the design of the hybrid PAL candidates. Finally, the PAL 
remodeling of AβO secondary structures shows a reasonable correlation between a 
candidate's bioactivity and its ability to reduce the fraction of antiparallel 
β-strand.

Background: Neuronal loss is a major pathological feature of neurodegenerative 
diseases. The analysis of plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is an emerging approach 
to track cell death events in a minimally invasive way and from inaccessible 
areas of the body, such as the brain. Previous studies showed that DNA 
methylation (DNAm) profiles can be used to map the tissue of origin of cfDNA and 
to identify molecules released from the brain upon cell death. The aim of the 
present study is to contribute to this research field, presenting the 
development and validation of an assay for the detection of brain-derived cfDNA 
(bcfDNA). Methods: To identify CpG sites with brain-specific DNAm, we compared 
brain and non-brain tissues for their chromatin state profiles and genome-wide 
DNAm data, available in public datasets. The selected target genomic regions 
were experimentally validated by bisulfite sequencing on DNA extracted from 44 
different autoptic tissues, including multiple brain regions. Sequencing data 
were analysed to identify brain-specific epihaplotypes. The developed assay was 
tested in plasma cfDNA from patients with immune effector cell-associated 
neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) following chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) 
therapy. Results: We validated five genomic regions with brain-specific DNAm 
(four hypomethylated and one hypermethylated in the brain). DNAm analysis of the 
selected genomic regions in plasma samples from CAR-T patients revealed higher 
levels of bcfDNA in participants with ongoing neurotoxicity syndrome. 
Conclusions: We developed an assay for the analysis of bcfDNA in plasma. The 
assay is a promising tool for the early detection of neuronal loss in 
neurodegenerative diseases.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative neurological condition characterized 
by cognitive decline, memory loss, and reduced everyday function, which 
eventually causes dementia. Symptoms develop years after the disease begins, 
making early detection difficult. While AD remains incurable, timely detection 
and prompt treatment can substantially slow its progression. This study 
presented a framework for automated AD detection using brain MRIs. Firstly, the 
deep network information (i.e., features) were extracted using various 
deep-learning networks. The information extracted from the best deep networks 
(EfficientNet-b0 and MobileNet-v2) were merged using the canonical correlation 
approach (CCA). The CCA-based fused features resulted in an enhanced 
classification performance of 94.7% with a large feature vector size (i.e., 
2532). To remove the redundant features from the CCA-based fused feature vector, 
the binary-enhanced WOA was utilized for optimal feature selection, which 
yielded an average accuracy of 98.12 ± 0.52 (mean ± standard deviation) with 
only 953 features. The results were compared with other optimal feature 
selection techniques, showing that the binary-enhanced WOA results are 
statistically significant (p < 0.01). The ablation study was also performed to 
show the significance of each step of the proposed methodology. Furthermore, the 
comparison shows the superiority and high classification performance of the 
proposed automated AD detection approach, suggesting that the hybrid approach 
may help doctors with dementia detection and staging.

BACKGROUND: Mutations in the X-linked CDKL5 gene underlie a severe epileptic 
encephalopathy, CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD), characterized by gross motor 
impairment, autistic features and intellectual disability. Absence of Cdkl5 
negatively impacts neuronal proliferation, survival, and maturation in in vitro 
and in vivo models, resulting in behavioral deficits in the Cdkl5 KO mouse. 
While there is no targeted therapy for CDD, several studies showed that 
treatments enabling an increase in brain BDNF levels give rise to structural and 
behavioral improvements in Cdkl5 KO mice. P021, a tetra-peptide derived from the 
biologically active region of the human ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), was 
found to enhance neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity by promoting an increase 
in BDNF expression in preclinical models of brain disorders, such as Alzheimer's 
disease and Down syndrome, resulting in a beneficial therapeutic effect. 
Considering the positive actions of P021 on brain development and cognition 
associated with increased BDNF expression, the present study aimed to evaluate 
the possible beneficial effect of treatment with P021 in an in vitro and in vivo 
model of CDD.
METHODS: We used SH-CDKL5-KO cells as an in vitro model of CDD to test the 
efficacy of P021 on neuronal proliferation, survival, and maturation. In 
addition, both young and adult Cdkl5 KO mice were used to evaluate the in vivo 
effects of P021, on neuroanatomical and behavioral defects.
RESULTS: We found that P021 treatment was effective in restoring neuronal 
proliferation, survival, and maturation deficits, as well as alterations in the 
GSK3β signaling pathway, features that characterize a human neuronal model of 
CDKL5 deficiency. Unexpectedly, chronic in vivo P021 treatment failed to 
increase BDNF levels and did not improve neuroanatomical defects in Cdkl5 KO 
mice, resulting in limited behavioral benefit.
CONCLUSIONS: At present, it remains to be understood whether initiating the 
treatment prenatally, or prolonging the duration of treatment will be necessary 
in order to achieve similar results in vivo in CDD mice to those obtained in 
vitro.

AIMS: Many factors affect the neuroinflammatory response in patients with 
Alzheimer disease (AD). Galectin-3 (Gal-3) is closely related to microglial 
activation in the nervous system and can promote the aggregation of cancer cells 
in tumors. This study aimed to investigate the mechanism by which 
farnesylthiosalicylic acid (FTS) affects neuroinflammation in Aβ1-42 mice 
through Gal-3.
METHODS: We used the Morris water maze, reverse transcription-polymerase chain 
reaction (RT-PCR), Western blotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), 
and immunofluorescence to conduct our study.
RESULTS: FTS reduced the levels of proinflammatory factors and microglial 
activation in Aβ1-42 mice. FTS inhibited total and membrane expression levels of 
Gal-3 in Aβ1-42 mice, and the anti-inflammatory effect of FTS was reversed by 
Gal-3-adeno-associated viral (AAV). FTS reduced the expression levels of 
toll-like receptors (TLRs), effects that were reversed by Gal-3-AAV. Moreover, 
FTS ameliorated Aβ oligomerization and accumulation in Aβ1-42 mice, effects that 
were also reversed by Gal-3-AAV. FTS, through the inhibition of the Gal-3-c-Jun 
N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, reduced PS1 expression; in addition, inhibition 
of Gal-3 increased the Aβ-degrading enzymes in Aβ1-42 mice. FTS-induced 
improvements in cognition in Aβ1-42 mice were reversed by Gal-3-AAV.
CONCLUSION: FTS may through inhibiting Gal-3 reduce the expression of TLR4 and 
CD14 and alleviate Aβ pathology, downregulating Aβ-stimulated TLR2, TLR4, and 
CD14 expression, and thus alleviate neuroinflammation in Aβ1-42 mice.

Recent Trends in Development of Novel Therapeutics for Modulation of 14-3-3 
Protein-Protein Interactions in Diseases.

Nazir A(1).

14-3-3s constitute a group of proteins belonging to the 
phosphoserine/phosphothreonine family that are involved in the regulation of 
several physiological pathways by interacting with several client proteins. All 
the eukaryotic cells are known to possess 14-3-3 isoforms. In addition, 14-3-3s 
isolated from different eukaryotic cells share high sequence homology with each 
other. Seven isoforms (β, γ, ε, η, ζ, σ, and τ/θ) have been yet identified in 
mammals. These proteins participate in several physiological processes by either 
stimulating or interfering with the enzymatic activities of binding partners. 
These proteins take part in several human diseases upon dysregulation which 
include cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Recently, a number of evidences 
suggest that the interaction of 14-3-3s with either oncogenic or pro-apoptotic 
proteins can lead to cancer development in animals. In the case of 
neurodegenerative disorders, 14-3-3s interact with Lewy bodies and 
neurofibrillary tangles in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, respectively. 
The current review focuses on strategies to regulate 14-3-3s' proteins in 
diseases. Potential strategies to regulate 14-3-3 interactions in disease 
conditions include the use of small interfering RNAs (siRNA), microRNA (miRNA), 
and modifications of 14-3-3s or their client proteins. In addition, some 
peptides or chemicals can also serve as potential inhibitors of 14-3-3. However, 
optimization of these therapeutic strategies is required for their practical 
implementations.

INTRODUCTION/OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) 
present significant caregiving challenges, with increasing burdens on informal 
caregivers. This study examines the potential of AI-driven Large Language Models 
(LLMs) in developing digital caregiving strategies for AD/ADRD. The objectives 
include analyzing existing caregiving education materials (CEMs) and mobile 
application descriptions (MADs) and aligning key caregiving tasks with digital 
functions across different stages of disease progression.
METHODS: We analyzed 38 CEMs from the National Library of Medicine's 
MedlinePlus, along with associated hyperlinked web resources, and 57 MADs 
focused on AD digital caregiving. Using ChatGPT 3.5, essential caregiving tasks 
were extracted and matched with digital functionalities suitable for each stage 
of AD progression, while also highlighting digital literacy requirements for 
caregivers.
RESULTS: The analysis categorizes AD caregiving into 4 stages-Pre-Clinical, 
Mild, Moderate, and Severe-identifying key tasks, such as behavior monitoring, 
daily assistance, direct supervision, and ensuring a safe environment. These 
tasks were supported by digital aids, including memory- enhancing apps, Global 
Positioning System (GPS) tracking, voice-controlled devices, and advanced GPS 
tracking for comprehensive care. Additionally, 6 essential digital literacy 
skills for AD/ADRD caregiving were identified: basic digital skills, 
communication, information management, safety and privacy, healthcare knowledge, 
and caregiver coordination, highlighting the need for tailored training.
CONCLUSION: The findings advocate for an LLM-driven strategy in designing 
digital caregiving interventions, particularly emphasizing a novel paradigm in 
AD/ADRD support, offering adaptive assistance that evolves with caregivers' 
needs, thereby enhancing their shared decision-making and patient care 
capabilities.

We conducted a large-scale whole-brain morphometry study by analyzing 3.7 
peta-voxels of mouse brain images at the single-cell resolution, producing one 
of the largest multi-morphometry databases of mammalian brains to date. We 
registered 204 mouse brains of three major imaging modalities to the Allen 
Common Coordinate Framework (CCF) atlas, annotated 182,497 neuronal cell bodies, 
modeled 15,441 dendritic microenvironments, characterized the full morphology of 
1876 neurons along with their axonal motifs, and detected 2.63 million axonal 
varicosities that indicate potential synaptic sites. Our analyzed six levels of 
information related to neuronal populations, dendritic microenvironments, 
single-cell full morphology, dendritic and axonal arborization, axonal 
varicosities, and sub-neuronal structural motifs, along with a quantification of 
the diversity and stereotypy of patterns at each level. This integrative study 
provides key anatomical descriptions of neurons and their types across a 
multiple scales and features, contributing a substantial resource for 
understanding neuronal diversity in mammalian brains.

Phosphodiesterase enzyme 5 (PDE5) inhibitors have emerged as one of the leading 
molecules for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED). PDE5 inhibitors are 
categorized structurally into several classes. PDE5 inhibitors have been a 
multidisciplinary endeavor that attracts the attention of researchers because of 
their multiple pharmaceutical applications. Beyond their action on ED, PDE5 
inhibitors are widely used in treatment of benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH), 
Eisenmenger's syndrome, Raynaud's Disease, Intrauterine growth retardation 
(IUGR), Mountain sickness, Bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis (BPS/IC), 
pulmonary arterial hypertension and type II diabetes (insulin resistance). In 
addition, PDE5 inhibitors also show promising antiproliferative activity, 
anti-Alzheimer and COX-1/COX-2 inhibitory activity (anti-inflammatory). 
Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacogenetics and toxicity of PDE5 inhibitors were finally 
explored. The diverse therapeutic applications, the high feasibility of 
structural modification and the appropriate pharmacokinetic properties of PDE5 
inhibitors have motivated researchers to develop new scaffolds that have been 
either under clinical trials or approved by FDA and utilize them to overcome 
some recent global concerns, such as COVID-19.

Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat 
expansion in the HTT gene encoding a mutant huntingtin (mHtt) protein. mHtt 
aggregates within neurons causing degeneration primarily in the striatum. There 
is currently a need for disease-modifying treatments for HD. Many therapeutic 
studies have focused on lowering mHtt levels by reducing its production or 
enhancing its clearance. One way to clear mHtt aggregates is to promote 
autophagy, which is disrupted in HD. Our previous studies showed that the small 
molecule p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) ligand, LM11A-31, prevented 
HD-related neuropathologies and behavioral deficits in multiple HD mouse models. 
This study investigated whether modulating p75NTR with LM11A-31, would reduce 
mHtt aggregates via autophagic/lysosomal mechanisms in HD models. LM11A-31 
decreased mHtt aggregates in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells expressing mHtt 
(exon 1 with 74 CAG repeats) and in the striatum of R6/2 and zQ175dn mouse 
models of HD. The LM11A-31 associated decrease in mHtt aggregates in vitro was 
accompanied by increased autophagic/lysosomal activity as indicated by altered 
levels of relevant markers including p62/SQSTM1 and the lysosomal protease, 
mature cathepsin D, and increased autophagy flux. In R6/2 and/or zQ175dn 
striatum, LM11A-31 increased AMPK activation, normalized p62/SQSTM1 and LC3II 
levels, and enhanced LAMP1 and decreased LC3B association with mHtt. Thus, 
LM11A-31 reduces mHtt aggregates and may do so via engaging autophagy/lysosomal 
systems. LM11A-31 has successfully completed a Phase 2a clinical trial for 
mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease and our results here strengthen its 
potential as a candidate for HD clinical testing.

Supramolecular protein assemblies have been used as intelligent drug delivery 
systems that can encapsulate drugs and transport them to specific tissues or 
cells. However, the known methods for designing supramolecular protein 
assemblies for transportation across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) remain 
challenging and inefficient. Herein, we report that the supramolecular 
recombinant-protein-based strategy enables the biosynthesis and production of a 
supramolecular protein assembly that is intrinsically capable of crossing the 
BBB. The recombinant protein constituting the essential part of apolipoprotein 
A1 can self-assemble into a supramolecular protein assembly known as a nanodisc. 
The nanodisc could efficiently enter the brain of an Alzheimer's disease mouse 
model, recognize Aβ1-42, eliminate amyloid plaques, promote neurogenesis, and 
ameliorate cognitive impairment. This work opens a new field for supramolecular 
protein assemblies and offers a new avenue for designing versatile and 
intelligent supramolecular biomaterials.

Neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, 
and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis are characterized by progressive destruction 
of neurons and cognitive impairment, and thorough studies have provided evidence 
that these pathologies have a close relationship to the failure of the 
blood-brain barrier (BBB). Nattokinase (NK), a protease found in fermented 
soybeans, has been extensively studied because it displays powerful 
neuroprotective abilities, which is why current research was reviewed in the 
present article. It was concluded that there is enough evidence in preclinical 
studies using experimental animals that NK supplementation can alleviate the 
condition related to BBB dysfunction, reduce brain inflammation, and improve 
cognitive ability. Furthermore, the study of NK on the cardiovascular system 
leads to certain assumptions, which include the impact on vasculature function 
and the ability to manage blood flow, which is the key feature of BBB integrity. 
Such assumed mechanisms are fibrinolytic action, anti-inflammatory and 
antioxidant action, and endothelium function modulation. There are many positive 
research findings, and it seems that NK may serve as an effective opponent for 
BBB breakdown; however, a new research level should be taken to disclose the 
application and therapeutic use of NK in brain neurodegenerative disease.

RNA interference (RNAi) harbors significant potential for treating neurological 
disorders; nevertheless, limited efficacy has been discerned. The presence of 
barriers within the central nervous system, coupled with the inherent 
instability of nucleic acids within biological conditions, poses formidable 
challenges in advancing effective gene delivery strategies. In this study, we 
designed and prepared a virus-mimic non-viral gene vector, rabies virus 
glycoprotein (RVG29)-decorated liposome (f(Lipo)-RVG29), to deliver small 
interfering RNAs to the brain. Alzheimer's disease (AD) was chosen as a model of 
neurodegenerative disease in this context, and b-site APP cleaving enzyme 
silencing siRNA (siBACE1) was used. The developed liposomal delivery system has 
a particle size of under 80 nm with a spherical shape, positive zeta potential, 
and the ability to protect siRNA against nucleases. In vitro studies demonstrate 
that functionalizing the cationic liposome by the RVG29 targeting ligand 
significantly enhances the effectiveness of gene delivery and silencing. 
Examination through ex vivo imaging illustrates an increased deposition of 
fluorescent-labeled f(Lipo)-RVG29 within brain tissue after 12 h post 
application. Additionally, the in vivo delivery of f(Lipo)-RVG29 carrying siRNA 
has substantially suppressed BACE1 expression at both mRNA and protein levels 
within the brain tissue. Our results suggest that the developed non-viral vector 
could be a promising gene carrier system combining the synergistic effect of 
virus-mimic RVG29 ligand with bioinspired liposome that imitates the natural 
lipid bilayers of cell membranes for brain-targeted RNAi therapeutics.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) often leads to dementia, causing cognitive decline and 
increased care needs. Rivastigmine (RV) is a key AD treatment, but its brain 
delivery is limited by the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Aside from oral, 
olfactory, and intradermal injection (i.d.) routes, the application of polymeric 
microneedles via the trigeminal nerve on the facial skin as a pretreatment, 
followed by a solid lipid nanoparticle RV-loaded thermosensitive gel 
(PMN-SLN-RV-TG), is an alternative to deal with the problems. This study aims to 
determine the optimal formula for PMN-SLN-RV-TG application and assess its brain 
delivery ability compared to conventional routes. The optimum SLN-RV formula had 
a particle size <200 nm and sustained release for 72 h, which was selected for 
the SLN-RV-TG formulation. SLN-RV-TG was transformed into a gel at normal skin 
temperature (32-37 °C), with good physical properties and nontoxic behavior. The 
ideal PMN formula was able to penetrate the dermal layer as an alternative to 
i.d. administration. Ex vivo dermatokinetics showed significant improvement of 
PMN-SLN-RV-TG application (p < 0.05) compared to without PMN application. In 
vivo pharmacokinetic studies on rats also revealed that the PMN-SLN-RV-TG had 
superior pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax, AUC, t1/2, and MRT) compared to other 
groups (p < 0.05). Radiolabeling SLN-RV with 99mTc showed good physical 
properties, with a radiochemical yield of >95%. In vivo distribution studies of 
PMN-SLN-RV-TG application exhibited a higher brain:blood ratio than i.v. 
administration after 5 h, as well as being safe for the brain due to a good 
histological profile. These results show that PMN-SLN-RV-TG application via the 
trigeminal nerve on the facial skin has strong potential delivery to the brain 
for AD treatment.

Cognitive impairment affiliated with neurological disorders has a severe impact 
on daily life functioning and the quality of life of patients. This is 
associated with a significant and long-lasting health, social and financial 
burden, not only for the patients, but also for families and the wider society. 
However, treatment for cognitive impairment is only available for the indication 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prodromal stage Mild Cognitive Impairment 
(MCI), although with major adverse effects, i.e. gastrointestinal effects 
(drugs) or hemorrhages (antibodies). Roflumilast (selective phosphodiesterase 
type 4 (PDE4) inhibitor) has been approved as an anti-inflammatory drug for the 
treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), although still 5 % of 
the patients experience nausea or even vomiting at the approved dose of 500 μg. 
Nonclinical studies demonstrated that roflumilast appears a promising drug the 
treat cognitive impairment in healthy rodents and a wide variety of animal 
models of CNS disorders. These effects are attributed to pro-neuroplasticity and 
anti-inflammatory effects, which appeared dose dependent. Roflumilast has also 
been tested in clinical studies and showed cognition enhancement at low dosing 
(100-250 µg) in healthy adults, healthy elderly, MCI and schizophrenia. 
Currently, clinical trials are underway for testing the pro-cognitive effects in 
early AD, post stroke cognitive impairment and Fragile X. Overall, the data 
showed that roflumilast has beneficial effects on cognitive performance. These 
cognition-enhancing effects are found at doses that were well-tolerated. Based 
on this favorable therapeutic window, the repurposing of roflumilast for 
treating cognitive impairments in CNS diseases may offer an affordable treatment 
option for patients.

The transition of peptides or proteins along a misfolding continuum from soluble 
functional states to pathological aggregates, to ultimately deposit as amyloid 
fibrils, is a process that underlies an expanding group of human 
diseases-collectively known as protein-misfolding disorders (PMDs). These 
include common and debilitating conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease, 
Parkinson's disease, and type-2 diabetes. Compelling evidence has emerged that 
the complex interplay between the misfolded proteins and biological membranes is 
a key determinant of the pathogenic mechanisms by which harmful amyloid entities 
are formed and exert their cytotoxicity. Most efforts thus far to develop 
disease-modifying treatments for PMDs have largely focused on anti-aggregation 
strategies: to neutralise, or prevent the formation of, toxic amyloid species. 
Herein, we review the critical role of the phospholipid membrane in mediating 
and enabling amyloid pathogenicity. We consequently propose that the development 
of small molecules, which have the potential to uniquely modify the 
physicochemical properties of the membrane and make it more resilient against 
damage by misfolded proteins, could provide a novel therapeutic approach in 
PMDs. By way of an example, natural compounds shown to intercalate into lipid 
bilayers and inhibit amyloid-lipid interactions, such as the aminosterols, 
squalamine and trodusquamine, cholesterol, ubiquinone, and select polyphenols, 
are discussed. Such a strategy would provide a novel approach to counter a wide 
range of toxic biomolecules implicit in numerous human amyloid pathologies.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a representative neurodegenerative disease 
characterized by the structural and functional degeneration of neurons. The 
present study investigated the neuroprotective effect of Ixeris dentata (ID) 
extract on trimethyltin (TMT)-induced memory deficit in the rat. Cognitive 
improving effect and neuronal activity of ID were assessed by using Morris water 
maze (MWM) test and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), cAMP-response 
element-binding protein (CREB) immunohistochemistry. Seven days after TMT 
injection (8.0 mg/kg, i.p.), each group of rats was administered saline, water 
extract of ID (WID, 400 or 800 mg/kg, p.o.), ethanol extract of ID (EID, 400 or 
800 mg/kg, p.o.), or caffeic acid (CAF, 30 mg/kg, i.p.) daily for fourteen days. 
Results: Treatment with EID and CAF produced a significant improvement in escape 
latency time of the acquisition, and retention time in the target area of the 
MWM task. Additionally, administration of EID or CAF markedly alleviated 
TMT-induced loss of ChAT- and CREB-immunoreactive cells in the hippocampus. The 
results demonstrated that EID has a protective effect against TMT-induced memory 
deficit, partly through increasing the CREB and cholinergic signaling pathway in 
the hippocampus. These results suggest that ethanol extracts of ID might be 
useful for improving cognitive functions in neurodegenerative diseases such as 
Alzheimer's disease.

Fluorescent biosensor, which has the characteristics of high sensitivity, 
specificity, and low cost, can be directly detected in physiological fluids such 
as blood and serum. Therefore, the development of fluorescence sensor platforms 
for miRNA detection has a positive effect on the prevention and treatment of 
various diseases. In this paper, miR-34a was selected as a biological indicator 
of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We designed a circular single-stranded DNA (CSSD) 
biosensor, which uses two unmodified single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) with 
complementary ends, DNAa and DNAb, to form CSSD by DNA sequence pairing to 
improve thermal stability and achieve signal amplification. At the same time, 
CSSD can react with miR-34a, and then the DNA of the DNA-RNA chain is hydrolyzed 
by duplex-specific nuclease (DSN enzyme). Finally, miR-34a is released to 
partake in the subsequent step, thus realizing cycle amplification. By 
evaluating the change in fluorescence signal under the optimized conditions, we 
discovered that this approach exhibits impressive sensitivity, with a detection 
threshold reaching as low as 0.36 nM. This surpasses the performance of numerous 
preceding miRNA detection biosensors. Furthermore, the system displays excellent 
detection capabilities even in intricate settings like serum, showcasing a 
strong ability to differentiate and choose effectively. In summary, this is a 
signal-off fluorescent biosensor, which realizes the purpose of double 
amplification of biosensor signal by using CSSD and enzyme assistance so that it 
can be used as a valuable tool for early diagnosis of diseases.

Synaptic loss and dendritic degeneration are common pathologies in several 
neurodegenerative diseases characterized by progressive cognitive and/or motor 
decline, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal 
dementia/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FTD/ALS). An essential regulator of 
neuronal health, the cAMP-dependent transcription factor CREB positively 
regulates synaptic growth, learning, and memory. Phosphorylation of CREB by 
protein kinase A (PKA) and other cellular kinases promotes neuronal survival and 
maturation via transcriptional activation of a wide range of downstream target 
genes. CREB pathway dysfunction has been strongly implicated in AD pathogenesis, 
and recent data suggest that impaired CREB activation may contribute to disease 
phenotypes in FTD/ALS as well. However, the mechanisms behind reduced CREB 
activity in FTD/ALS pathology are not clear. In this study, we found that 
cortical-like neurons derived from iPSC lines carrying the hexanucleotide repeat 
expansion in the C9ORF72 gene, a common genetic cause of FTD/ALS, displayed a 
diminished activation of CREB, resulting in decreased dendritic and synaptic 
health. Importantly, we determined such impairments to be mechanistically linked 
to an imbalance in the ratio of regulatory and catalytic subunits of the CREB 
activator PKA and to be conserved in C9-ALS patient's postmortem tissue. 
Modulation of cAMP upstream of this impairment allowed for a rescue of CREB 
activity and an amelioration of dendritic morphology and synaptic protein 
levels. Our data elucidate the mechanism behind early CREB pathway dysfunction 
and discern a feasible therapeutic target for the treatment of FTD/ALS and 
possibly other neurodegenerative diseases.

Protein post-translational modifications (PTM) play a crucial role in the 
modulation of synaptic function and their alterations are involved in the onset 
and progression of neurodegenerative disorders. S-palmitoylation is a PTM 
catalyzed by zinc finger DHHC domain containing (zDHHC) S-acyltransferases that 
affects both localization and activity of proteins regulating synaptic 
plasticity and amyloid-β (Aβ) metabolism. Here, we found significant increases 
of both zDHHC7 expression and protein S-palmitoylation in hippocampi of both 
3×Tg-AD mice and post-mortem Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Chronic 
intranasal administration of the S-palmitoylation inhibitor 2-bromopalmitate 
counteracted synaptic plasticity and cognitive deficits, reduced the Aβ 
deposition in the hippocampus and extended the lifespan of both male and female 
3×Tg-AD mice. Moreover, hippocampal silencing of zDHHC7 prevented the onset of 
cognitive deficits in the same experimental model. We also identified a 
FoxO1-mediated epigenetic mechanism inducing zDHHC7 expression, which was 
triggered by brain insulin resistance in 3×Tg-AD mice. Finally, in hippocampi of 
AD patients S-palmitoylation levels of Beta-Secretase 1 were associated with Aβ 
1 to 42 load and they inversely correlated with Mini Mental State Examination 
scores. Our data reveal a key role of both zDHHC7 overexpression and protein 
hyperpalmitoylation in the onset and progression of AD-related alterations of 
synaptic plasticity and memory.
