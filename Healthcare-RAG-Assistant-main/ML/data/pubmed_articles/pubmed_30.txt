The aging population has led to a rise in neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) like 
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's creating significant public health challenges. 
Traditional monitoring methods often lack continuity and real-time data, 
limiting their effectiveness. Advances in flexible sensors, combined with 
artificial intelligence and big data analytics, enable real-time analysis of 
multi-parameter physiological data, improving detection rates and supporting 
personalized treatment. Innovations such as self-powered triboelectric 
nanogenerators and graphene-based materials further enhance sensor reliability 
and efficiency, ensuring seamless patient monitoring. This article discusses the 
integration of flexible sensors with modern monitoring devices, focusing on 
advancements in sensor design optimization, energy management circuits, and 
intelligent data processing algorithms. These innovations aim to develop robust, 
self-sustaining systems for accurate, real-time health data monitoring. Such 
systems hold promise for enabling early interventions and enhancing the quality 
of life for elderly patients.

Alzheimer's disease is regarded as a type of dementia that has significantly 
affected a large population, thus posing a global health concern. The amyloid 
beta hypothesis and tau pathology define the disease pathology. The hallmarks of 
this disease are defined by the presence of neurofibrillary tangles and senile 
plaques, thus supporting the theories presented above. Oxidative stress and 
neuroinflammation can also serve as therapeutic targets for treatment. Current 
conventional treatments have focused on managing the symptoms rather than 
modifying the disease. One of the major challenges this delivery systems face is 
their inability to cross the blood-brain barrier; hence, the development of 
nanoparticle delivery systems incorporates the required active component and 
utilizes different mechanisms such as transcytosis, cell-mediated transport, or 
advanced techniques to surpass the blood-brain barrier. Bioactive components 
possess multiple advantages such as being anti-inflammatory and antioxidant in 
nature. They also target the main pathology involved in the aggregation of 
amyloid fibres and hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins. Various bioactive 
nanoparticles have been demonstrated in disease models to operate on certain 
targets and facilitate blood-brain barrier crossing. The article also covers the 
salient features of some of the nanoparticle systems under investigation 
separating them based on the norms of those aimed at addressing various disease 
pathologies. Despite being able to address the main issues with traditional drug 
delivery, they nevertheless have some disadvantages, such as toxicity, 
bioavailability, and regulatory barriers. However, the prospects for bioactive 
nanoparticles appear bright.

Memory decline is a common hallmark signal of neurodegenerative diseases marked 
by elevated neuroinflammatory cytokines, oxidative damage and cholinergic 
insufficiency in cortical regions. Studies indicate that inhibiting these 
cytokines and associated markers may enhance memory and provide neuroprotection. 
This study investigates the effects of sabinene, a neuroprotective monoterpene 
found in essential oils with neuroprotective and antioxidant properties, on 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation, oxidative stress and 
learning/memory impairment in mice. In this study, mice in groups 1 and 2 
received normal saline, while groups 3-5 were pretreated with sabinene (5, 10, 
and 20 mg/kg). Group 6 received donepezil (1 mg/kg) orally. Groups 2-6 were 
additionally injected with LPS (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) 30 min post-treatment for 
7 days. Behavioral consequences indicating spatial and non-spatial deficits were 
assessed through Y-maze and novel-object recognition tests, along with locomotor 
functions conducted. Biochemical markers of neuroinflammation (TNF-α, IL-6), 
oxidative stress (glutathione, peroxidase, malondialdehyde, nitrite), 
cholinergic function, and molybdenum enzymes were analyzed in the 
prefrontal-cortex (PFC) and hippocampus. Sabinene treatment mitigated 
LPS-induced memory impairments and reduced motor activity. It also significantly 
decreased acetylcholinesterase activity and malondialdehyde levels in the 
hippocampus and PFC while increasing glutathione and glutathione peroxidase 
levels, respectively. Moreover, sabinene reduced LPS-induced molybdenum enzyme 
elevation in the PFC. Compared to LPS, sabinene significantly lowered TNF-α and 
IL-6 levels in the PFC and hippocampus while protecting neuronal cell damage in 
the PFC. Overall, sabinene enhances memory function in LPS-treated mice by 
reducing oxidative stress and neuroinflammation while improving cholinergic 
activity and molybdenum enzymes in the cortical regions of mice brains.

London, London, UK.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the validity and acceptability of an adapted version of 
Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) for the Spanish population and culturally 
adapt the original UK manuals.
METHODS: The process followed the Formative Method for Adapting Psychotherapy 
(FMAP). Two focus groups were conducted with healthcare professionals 
specialized in the care of people with dementia, a pilot study with a small 
sample size (n = 6), and individual interviews with participants, family 
caregivers, and group facilitators. The study was conducted at the National 
Reference Center for Alzheimer's and Dementia Care (CREA), a specialized 
dementia care center in Spain. The participants included eight healthcare 
professionals for the focus groups, six persons with dementia from CREA 
outpatient programs for the pilot study, their family caregivers, and two group 
facilitators. Assessments for the pilot study included the Mini-Mental State 
Examination (MMSE), Cambridge Cognitive Assessment Revised (CAMCOG-R), Geriatric 
Depression Scale (GDS-15), Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease Scale 
(QoL-AD), Barthel Index (BI), and the Lawton and Brody Scale for Instrumental 
Activities of Daily Living (IADL).
RESULTS: The adapted CST principles and structure were deemed suitable for the 
Spanish context, with necessary linguistic and cultural adjustments. The pilot 
study reported no implementation issues, with positive feedback from 
participants, caregivers, and facilitators, alongside significant cognitive and 
quality of life improvements.
DISCUSSION: The culturally adapted Cognitive Stimulation Therapy-Spain (CST-ES) 
is a valid and appropriate intervention for the Spanish population, providing a 
valuable addition to non-pharmacological therapies for dementia in Spain.

BACKGROUND: Clinical trials have recently incorporated plasma glial fibrillary 
acidic protein (GFAP) as an exploratory endpoint. To include plasma GFAP as a 
secondary endpoint, it is essential to characterize its longitudinal progression 
in target populations.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential use of plasma GFAP changes as a secondary 
endpoint in Alzheimer's disease trials.
METHODS: We longitudinally evaluated plasma GFAP in individuals with 
amyloid-beta (Aβ)-PET scans at baseline in three well-characterized cohorts. Cox 
proportional hazards regression tested the association between changes in plasma 
GFAP and cognitive function. Analysis of the 95 % confidence interval of 
annualized change in plasma GFAP provided statistical inference for a 
significant longitudinal change. Effect size was calculated as the group mean 
divided by the standard deviation (SD). We estimated the sample size needed to 
test a 25% drug effect with 80% power on reducing changes in GFAP.
RESULTS: We assessed 487 individuals [176 cognitively unimpaired (CU; 29% Aβ 
positive) and 311 cognitively impaired (CI; 51% Aβ positive)] with some degree 
of cerebrovascular disease (Fazekas 1-3), over a mean (SD) follow-up of 1.84 
(0.46) years. Changes in plasma GFAP were significantly associated with 
worsening in Clinical Dementia Rating sum of boxes (CDR-SB) score across the 
population (p < 0.0001). In CU, only Aβ positive individuals showed significant 
changes in GFAP (p < 0.001). On the other hand, both CI Aβ positive and negative 
individuals showed longitudinal progression in GFAP levels (p < 0.0001). The 
effect size of changes in plasma GFAP was higher in CU Aβ positive (0.44), 
followed by CI Aβ positive (0.42) and CI Aβ negative (0.38). Clinical trials 
focusing on CU Aβ positive would require 1320 individuals per study arm, while 
focusing on CI Aβ positive would require 1440 individuals per study arm.
CONCLUSION: Plasma GFAP increased in parallel with cognitive decline, making it 
a candidate for monitoring disease progression in trials aimed at mitigating 
cognitive deterioration. Although Aβ positivity significantly accelerated GFAP 
progression, the fact that GFAP was increased in CI Aβ negative with 
cerebrovascular disease supports its potential use as a secondary endpoint in 
this population as well.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a major challenge due to limited 
effective therapies. Moreover, direct comparisons between newly developed and 
symptomatic drugs are lacking. This network meta-analysis aimed to compare the 
efficacy and safety of immunotherapies for AD.
METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library and 
ClinicalTrials.gov was conducted for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) up to 
29 June 2024. Eligible studies included adults with AD receiving immunotherapy 
versus placebo or symptomatic treatment.
RESULTS: Fifty-nine RCTs were included. Donanemab and lecanemab ranked among the 
most effective treatments for improving cognitive function (Clinical Dementia 
Rating Scale - Sum of Boxes P-scores: 0.88 and 0.77) and daily activities 
(Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily Living P-scores: 
0.85 and 0.90), based on network meta-analysis findings.
CONCLUSIONS: Anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies, particularly donanemab and 
lecanemab, demonstrated superior efficacy over other immunotherapies in slowing 
cognitive deterioration, supporting their role in AD management.

Accumulation of aggregated β-amyloid peptide is a key histopathological feature 
of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Experimental models of AD based on β-amyloid 
peptide display calcium (Ca2+) signaling alterations, and targeting key 
components of the cellular Ca2+ signaling system has been postulated to modulate 
AD onset and progression. Here we have taken advantage of a C. elegans strain 
that over-expresses the most toxic human ß-amyloid peptide (Aß1-42) in body-wall 
muscle cells, to study the impact of calreticulin (crt-1) silencing on body-wall 
muscle performance. Crt-1 knockdown reduced the percentage of paralyzed worms in 
a dose-dependent manner and improved locomotion parameters in free-mobility 
assays in Aß1-42-overexpressing worms. At the cellular level, crt-1 silencing 
prevented Aß1-42-induced exacerbated mitochondrial respiration and mitochondrial 
ROS production without impacting mitochondrial sarcomere organization. Crt-1 
knockdown reduced the number and size of Aß1-42 aggregates in body-wall muscle 
cells and prevented the formation of Aß1-42 oligomers. We propose that crt-1 
depletion reduces the number of Aß1-42 aggregates, precluding Aß1-42-induced 
mitochondrial toxicity and improving muscle function. We identify C. elegans 
crt-1 as a gene involved in the toxicity associated with the expression of human 
Aß1-42, and thus a potential new target for treatment.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Primarily by targeting the gray matter (GM), repetitive 
transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has shown promise in improving 
cognitive function in individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the 
impact of rTMS on white matter (WM) remains poorly understood. This study aimed 
to investigate the functional connectivity (FC) changes in both GM and WM 
induced by rTMS, and explore their relationship with the clinical manifestation 
of the disease.
METHODS: Sixteen patients with mild to moderate AD were enrolled and randomly 
assigned to either the real rTMS group (n = 8) or the sham treatment group 
(n = 8). Both groups received cognitive training in combination with rTMS. The 
real rTMS group received 10 Hz stimulation targeting the left dorsolateral 
prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) followed by the left lateral temporal lobe (LTL), with 
each session lasting 20 min per day for 4 weeks, while sham with the coil 
positioned at a 90° angle. Resting-state BOLD signals were averaged to generate 
mean time series for each of the 82 GM regions and 48 WM bundles, both before 
and after treatment for each subject. We analyzed the resting-state fMRI data by 
using a 2 × 2 factorial design with "time" as the within-subjects factor and 
"group" as the between-subjects factor.
RESULTS: In the analysis of 82 GM regions, when using left LTL as the seed, 
significant time main effect was observed in right ventral Posterior cingulate 
cortex (vPCC) (F=9.356, p = 0.009, η2=0.401) and right inferior temporal gyrus 
(ITG) (F=11.784, p = 0.004, η2=0.457). In the analysis of 48 WM bundles, when 
using left DLPFC as the seed, significant time × group interactions were found 
in right cingulum (hippocampus part, CGH) (F=12.123, p = 0.004, η2=0.464). The 
FC between left DLPFC and right cerebral peduncle (CBRP) demonstrated 
significant time main effect (F=15.569, p = 0.001, η2=0.527). Moreover, the FC 
between left DLPFC and right CGH was significantly correlated with MMSE scores 
changes (r = -0.610, p = 0.027), reflecting cognitive improvements after 
treatment.
CONCLUSION: The current study suggested that rTMS, when combined with cognitive 
training, can concurrently modulate functional activities in both GM and WM in 
patients with mild to moderate AD, which are associated with cognitive 
improvements. Notably, the limbic system appears to play a pivotal role in 
facilitating this therapeutic process.

INTRODUCTION: Several population-based studies have highlighted an association 
between stroke and dementia. Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related dementia and 
vascular dementia are the most common causes of dementia, with clear 
pathophysiological mechanisms for the latter. Given the ongoing debate 
surrounding the link between stroke and AD, a systematic meta-analysis was 
performed to determine their relationship and the possible influence of some 
moderators (sex, age, and region).
METHODS: We searched five databases (ISI Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, 
Elsevier ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar) with no initial publication date 
restriction, and the last search was conducted in 2022. We included longitudinal 
population-based studies assessing the stroke-AD association, selecting those 
with reported effect sizes, standardized AD diagnosis, and an AMSTAR score ≥9. 
Case reports, reviews, animal studies, and non-English publications were also 
excluded. The meta-analysis, conducted using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis 3.1, 
presented pooled log odds ratios (LogOR) with 95% confidence intervals, 
heterogeneity analysis (Cochran's Q, I2), and moderator analyses by age, sex, 
and region.
RESULTS: The meta-analysis included 3 meta-analyses and 12 primary studies, 
comprising a total of 14,207 stroke cases and 1,952 AD cases. Our analysis 
revealed a significant association between ischemic stroke (IS), hemorrhagic 
stroke (HS), and microinfarcts (MI) and the risk of AD. Despite some 
heterogeneity across studies, no significant differences were observed in the 
stroke-AD association based on age, sex, or region.
CONCLUSION: Our study describes the risk of AD in patients with episodes of 
stroke (IS, HS, and MI) and suggests that the risk of AD may be higher in stroke 
patients than in matched controls without stroke incidence. Moreover, the 
moderator analysis supports the robustness of our results. The link between 
stroke and AD suggests that stroke may accelerate cognitive decline. This calls 
for tighter vascular control and indicates worse prognosis in dementia 
progression.

Chronic bacterial infections exert profound systemic effects beyond their 
primary infection sites, influencing a range of inflammatory, metabolic, and 
neurodegenerative diseases. Helicobacter pylori (Hp) and Porphyromonas 
gingivalis (Pg) are two highly prevalent pathogens that, despite occupying 
distinct niches, share remarkable pathogenic similarities. Both bacteria, 
connected with metabolic syndrome, employ immune evasion strategies, induce 
chronic inflammation, and contribute to systemic diseases such as 
metabolic-associated steatotic liver disease, cardiovascular disease, and 
neurodegeneration, such as Alzheimer's disease. A key unifying factor in their 
pathogenicity is the role of gingipains-cysteine proteases produced by Pg-which 
facilitate bacterial invasion, immune modulation, and tissue destruction. 
Emerging evidence suggests that Hp possesses analogous proteolytic enzymes, 
further supporting their potential synergistic impact on host health. Moreover, 
both pathogens have been implicated in metabolic syndrome-related blood-brain 
barrier disruption, chronic (smoldering) systemic inflammation, and lipid 
metabolism dysregulation, contributing to progressive neurodegenerative and 
cardiovascular disorders. The role of galectins, particularly galectin-3, in 
modulating microglial activation and inflammatory pathways further highlights 
their involvement in neuroinflammatory diseases. Targeting gingipains presents a 
promising therapeutic avenue, with bismuth compounds and novel inhibitors 
showing potential in disrupting these proteases and mitigating their systemic 
effects. Understanding the interactions between Hp and metabolic 
syndrome-related Pg is crucial for developing comprehensive treatment 
strategies, integrating gastroenterology, periodontology, and neurology. 
Addressing these infections at both local and systemic levels may improve 
long-term health outcomes and reduce the burden of chronic inflammatory diseases 
linked to microbial persistence.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Gamma oscillations (30-80 Hz) play a crucial role in sensory 
processing and cognitive functions, with disruptions in these rhythms linked to 
neurological disorders such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. This 
review highlights the emerging role of astrocytes in regulating gamma 
oscillations, emphasizing their contribution to the inhibitory tone and 
extracellular ion homeostasis.
RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies suggest that astrocytes facilitate gamma 
synchrony, while dysfunction in astrocytic activity - such as impaired Ca 2+ 
signaling - is associated with deficits in gamma oscillations and increased 
network hyperexcitability. Thus, astrocytic dysfunction may contribute to the 
pathophysiology of gamma-related disorders.
SUMMARY: By examining the role of astrocytes in maintaining neuronal network 
stability, this review highlights new aspects of neuroglia signaling.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized 
by cognitive decline and memory impairment. Current treatments offer only 
symptomatic relief, underscoring the urgent need for novel therapeutic 
strategies. Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) plays a crucial role in gene 
transcription regulation and has emerged as a potential therapeutic target for 
AD. Building on our previous research on Atractylodes macrocephala, a 
traditional medicinal plant, this study reported chemical modifications on the 
sesquiterpene scaffold in Atractylodes. The compounds were evaluated for their 
LSD1 inhibitory activity and anti-AD properties in both in vitro and in vivo 
studies. Notably, compound A1 exhibited potent LSD1 inhibition, with an IC50 
value of 0.8 μM. In vitro assays demonstrated that A1 significantly inhibits Aβ 
aggregation and enhances Aβ-induced neuronal cell viability. Molecular dynamics 
results revealed stable binding interactions of A1 with LSD1 and Aβ. 
Furthermore, in vivo studies using APP/PS1 transgenic mice showed that A1 
treatment improved cognitive function and learning abilities, reduced 
neuroinflammation by inhibiting the activation of microglia and astrocytes, and 
decreased Aβ deposition in the hippocampus of AD mice. These findings suggest 
that compound A1 is a promising candidate for the development of an effective 
therapy for AD, underscoring the therapeutic potential of novel LSD1 inhibitors.

This is a retrospective cohort study comparing the effectiveness of rivastigmine 
and donepezil in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Of the 250 subjects, 127 
(50.8%) were men, while 123 (49.2%) were women. Baseline cognitive function was 
assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Clinical Dementia 
Rating (CDR), and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale 
(ADAS-Cog). The results showed that 83 (33.2%) patients improved, 84 (33.6%) 
remained stable, and 83 (33.2%) experienced cognitive decline. The difference 
between the two groups was not significant with respect to cognitive outcomes 
(Chi-square = 0.08, df = 2, N = 250, p = 0.96). However, rivastigmine was 
associated with a higher rate of side effects (65, or 52%), which could hinder 
adherence. Both groups had an average of 1.48 hospitalization episodes per 
patient. Biomarker analysis suggested that 144 (57.6%) of patients tested 
positive for amyloid on positron emission tomography (PET) scans. Cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) analysis data, illustrated through mean values, showed amyloid beta 
at 546.38 pg/mL and tau at 219.85 pg/mL - both linked to cognitive decline. 
Higher levels of tau were significantly correlated with greater cognitive 
decline. Statistically, there were significant differences between the treatment 
groups in terms of MMSE scores and CSF biomarkers (p < 0.05). Although there was 
no statistically significant difference in cognitive outcomes between the drugs, 
subgroup analysis revealed significant differences in baseline MMSE scores and 
CSF biomarker levels (p < 0.05), suggesting heterogeneity in disease severity. 
Therefore, personalized strategies for managing patients with AD should be 
constructed based on the drug's side effect profile, comorbidities, and 
biomarker status. Future studies should focus on biomarker-directed and 
combination therapies to improve treatment efficacy.

Research US Food and Drug Administration Silver Spring Maryland USA.

In the context of recent approvals of amyloid-directed monoclonal antibodies for 
the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by the United States (U.S.) Food and 
Drug administration (FDA), there has been much public discussion regarding the 
meaningfulness of the treatment effects demonstrated with these drugs in 
clinical trials. There are a variety of regulatory approaches to evaluate how 
results on a clinical endpoint reflect a meaningful effect of an intervention, 
including qualitative and quantitative methodologies. This article will discuss 
regulatory considerations for clinical benefit across the stages of AD, 
approaches to the assessment of clinical meaningfulness in clinical trials, and 
FDA's assessment of clinical benefit in the recent traditional approvals of 
amyloid-directed monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: Assessment of clinical benefit will depend on the stage of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) being studied, the clinical symptoms or findings that 
occur at that stage of disease, and the mechanism of the drug and its 
anticipated effects.It is critical to obtain input from patients and caregivers 
with lived experience to understand their perspectives on clinical benefit.The 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) encourages the use of clinically meaningful 
within-patient change, which captures the assessment of improvement or decline 
based on the perspective of the individual patient, to assess meaningful score 
differences.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by 
progressive memory loss and cognitive dysfunction that affects millions of 
people worldwide, placing a massive burden on families and economies. Exercise 
training can effectively reduce the prevalence of AD and alleviate its symptoms 
through the modulation of multiple signaling pathways involved in the 
pathophysiological process of AD, including the PI3K/Akt, Wnt/β-catenin, 
AMPK-related, MAPK, NF-κB, PINK1-PARKIN, JAK/STAT, and TREM2 signaling pathways. 
Different signaling pathways also crosstalk with each other through different 
targets to inhibit the formation of Amyloid β (Aβ) plaques, reduce the level of 
hyperphosphorylated tau protein, reduce apoptosis, relieve neuroinflammation, 
reduce autophagy dysfunction, and ultimately improve cognitive impairment in AD 
patients. This review summarizes the pathophysiological processes of AD affected 
by exercise training through different signaling pathways. We further provide a 
reference for the future development of new effective AD prevention and 
treatment targets to develop promising personalized, combined intervention 
strategies.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) presents significant challenges due to its intricate 
pathogenic mechanisms and the limited efficacy of single-target therapies. In 
this study, we investigated the potential of chlorogenic acid (CHA), a 
multifunctional natural active compound, in AD therapy by developing a 
trifunctional nanocarrier (MC-H/R/si). CHA was effectively conjugated with 
iron-based metal-organic frameworks (MIL/Fe-100) through chelation interaction. 
The resulting nanocomplex (MC) not only enhances the bioavailability of CHA but 
also facilitates a synergistic antioxidant effect between CHA and MIL/Fe-100. 
Importantly, CHA can chelate Zn2+ from β-amyloid/Zn2+ (Aβ/Zn2+) polymers, 
inhibiting Aβ aggregation. Furthermore, small interfering RNA targeting BACE1 
was covalently linked to MC to downregulate BACE1 expression. Both in vitro and 
in vivo experiments revealed that MC-H/R/si effectively scavenges ROS, reduces 
inflammation and Aβ plaque, and improves the learning and cognitive abilities of 
APP/PS1 mice. These findings confirm that the trifunctional nanocarrier 
MC-H/R/si has great potential for AD treatment.

INTRODUCTION: This project identified plasma proteins predictive of cognitive 
decline across a robust neuropsychological protocol over a 9-year period.
METHODS: Vanderbilt Memory and Aging Project participants (n = 336, 73 ± 7 
years, 59% male, 87% non-Hispanic White, 10% Black/African American) underwent 
blood draw for baseline plasma protein abundance using mass spectrometry 
analysis of tandem mass tag (TMT)-labeled peptides and serial neuropsychological 
assessment (follow-up = 6.1 ± 2.3 years). Linear mixed-effects regressions 
related protein levels to neuropsychological outcomes in fully adjusted models. 
False discovery rate correction was applied.
RESULTS: Initial proteomics analyses yielded 3764 unique protein identifications 
across 23 16-plex TMT batches, and 686 proteins passed quality control. Proteins 
were identified predicting longitudinal decline in language (EGFR, RTN4RL2), 
information processing speed (EGFR, NOMO2, CLEC3B), executive function (A1BG), 
and visuospatial skills (RTN4RL2, GALNT1, SERPINA4, SERPINA5, C8A, ALDOB), but 
not episodic memory.
DISCUSSION: Large-scale proteomics analyses identified 10 plasma proteins that 
predicted subsequent cognitive decline over a 9-year follow-up in multiple 
cognitive domains.
HIGHLIGHTS: There were 3764 unique protein identifications across 23 16-plex TMT 
batches. Rigorous quality control yielded 686 proteins used as predictors in 
analyses. Identified proteins related to all domains assessed, except for 
episodic memory. Many proteins identified were differentially expressed in MCI.

INTRODUCTION: Phospho-tau peptides from the proline-rich domain (PRD) of tau are 
sensitive biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The PRD is known to be 
relatively resistant to lysosomal proteolytic cleavage, but the effects of 
phosphorylation on cleavage are unknown.
METHODS: Using in silico modeling and in vitro protease assays, we quantified 
the effects of phosphorylation on lysosomal proteolysis of tau. We further 
assessed levels of lysosomal proteases in patient-derived cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) relative to phosphorylated tau-181 (p-tau181).
RESULTS: Phosphorylation renders the PRD significantly resistant to cleavage by 
the lysosome, especially at less acidic pH setpoints. In Alzheimer's disease 
subjects, CSF levels of lysosomal proteases correlate with p-tau181, suggesting 
that p-tau peptides are released with lysosomal contents.
DISCUSSION: Loss of lysosomal acidity may contribute to the release of 
phospho-tau biomarkers. This study shows that phosphorylation of tau impairs its 
cleavage by proteases in a pH-dependent manner and provides a novel molecular 
basis for p-tau biomarker accumulation in AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: Phosphorylated tau-181 (p-tau181) and p-tau217 originate from tau 
regions that are poorly cleaved by lysosomal proteases. Phosphorylation further 
impairs the proteolytic cleavage of AD biomarker peptides. Impaired proteolytic 
cleavage of phosphorylated tau is pH dependent. Levels of p-tau181 are 
correlated with lysosomal proteases in Alzheimer's disease (AD) cerebrospinal 
fluid samples. AD-associated lysosomal dysfunction may contribute to presence of 
disease biomarkers.

INTRODUCTION: The evidentiary base for dementia caregiver programs is still 
emerging and is less clear for diverse racial and ethnic minoritized 
populations. We explored in-depth perspectives about program participation, 
acceptability, and recommendations from diverse caregivers who completed one of 
three versions of the Savvy Caregiver Program.
METHODS: We conducted 19 focus groups with 92 caregivers who participated in an 
online version of the Savvy Caregiver Program (Savvy Caregiver Program, Savvy 
Express, and Unidos en el Cuidado, a Spanish-language version). Data were 
analyzed with thematic analysis.
RESULTS: Caregivers reported positive appraisals of the program's acceptability. 
Time constraints and a desire for more peer interaction were prominent. Key 
themes included programmatic features, cultural and gender considerations, 
program and research participation, and suggestions for improvement.
DISCUSSION: Our findings can inform programmatic improvements to future 
interventions for family caregivers of persons living with dementia, applicable 
to both online and on-site settings.
HIGHLIGHTS: Diverse caregivers report positive experiences in online dementia 
caregiving interventions. Key takeaways include dementia knowledge, self-care, 
and caregiving strategies. Cultural and gender considerations highlight gaps in 
caregiver program representation. Participants suggest expanding discussion time 
and offering follow-up sessions.

MOTIVATION: Developing computational tools for integrative analysis across 
multiple types of omics data has been of immense importance in cancer molecular 
biology and precision medicine research. While recent advancements have yielded 
integrative prediction solutions for multi-omics data, these methods lack a 
comprehensive and cohesive understanding of the rationale behind their specific 
predictions. To shed light on personalized medicine and unravel previously 
unknown characteristics within integrative analysis of multi-omics data, we 
introduce a novel integrative neural network approach for cancer molecular 
subtype and biomedical classification applications, named Integrative Graph 
Convolutional Networks (IGCN).
RESULTS: To demonstrate the superiority of IGCN, we compare its performance with 
other state-of-the-art approaches across different cancer subtype and biomedical 
classification tasks. Our experimental results show that our proposed model 
outperforms the state-of-the-art and baseline methods. IGCN identifies which 
types of omics data receive more emphasis for each patient when predicting a 
specific class. Additionally, IGCN has the capability to pinpoint significant 
biomarkers from a range of omics data types.

BACKGROUND: Aging is the greatest risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease 
(LOAD), which accounts for > 95% of all Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases. 
Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1), an aging-dependent protein, is a key element in 
the classical Hippo-YAP1 pathway mediated by a kinase cascade. Research showed 
that YAP1 was markedly reduced in the brains of individuals with AD. However, 
the mechanisms underlying the susceptibility of the Hippo-YAP1 signaling pathway 
in the context of LOAD remain unclear.
METHODS: AAV9-YAP1-RNAi was injected into the hippocampi of C57BL/6J mice to 
establish a YAP1 knockdown model. Overexpression of full-length YAP1 was 
achieved by injecting AAV9-YAP1 into the hippocampi of SAMP8 mice. To establish 
the model of knockdown of nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 1 (Nr4a1), 
AAV9-Nr4a1-RNAi was injected into the hippocampi of SAMP8 mice. In the C57BL/6J 
mice with YAP1 knockdown, Nr4a1 expression was either knocked down or inhibited 
with DIM-C to examine the impact of Nr4a1 on tau phosphorylation and cognitive 
deficits. Primary hippocampal neurons from Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were 
infected with lentivirus (LV)-YAP1 to create a YAP1 overexpression model, and Aβ 
treatment was used to induce neuronal senescence. Protein levels were assessed 
using immunofluorescence, Western blotting, and ELISA. Animal behavior was 
evaluated using the Morris water maze test, novel object recognition test, and 
open field test.
RESULTS: YAP1 was reduced in the hippocampus of both aged C57BL/6J mice and 
SAMP8 AD model mice through Hippo pathway activation, as well as in Aβ-induced 
senescent neurons. Overexpression of YAP1 in primary neurons significantly 
mitigated the Aβ-induced neuronal senescence by downregulating several 
senescence-related genes, including p16 and p53. The levels of phosphorylated 
AKT/GSK-3β in neurons were increased with overexpression of YAP1 both in vivo 
and in vitro. Knockdown of YAP1 induced AD-like symptoms and exacerbated 
cognitive decline in 2-month-old C57BL/6J mice. Injection of AAV9-YAP1 in the 
brains of SAMP8 mice partially alleviated neuronal senescence and enhanced 
cognitive function. Notably, genetic knockdown and chemical inhibition of Nr4a1 
significantly ameliorated cognitive deficits as well as AD-like pathology in 
these subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal an etiopathogenic relationship between aging 
and AD, which is associated with the YAP1-Nr4a1-AKT/GSK-3β signaling pathway. 
Our findings provide insight into the therapeutic strategies aimed at delaying 
brain aging and combating neurodegenerative diseases such as AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by 
macroscopic features such as cortical atrophy, narrowing of the gyri, widening 
of the sulci, and enlargement of the ventricles. At the cellular level, the 
pathological characteristics include the extracellular aggregation of β-amyloid 
(Aβ) forming senile plaques, and the intracellular accumulation of 
hyperphosphorylated tau proteins forming neurofibrillary tangles. AD leads to 
the progressive decline of cognitive, behavioral, and social abilities, with no 
effective treatment available currently. The pathophysiology of AD is complex, 
involving mechanisms such as immune dysregulation and lipid metabolism 
alterations. Immune cells, such as microglia, can identify and clear 
pathological aggregates like Aβ early in the disease. However, prolonged or 
excessive activation of immune cells may trigger chronic neuroinflammation, 
thereby accelerating neuronal damage and the progression of AD. Lipid metabolism 
plays a critical role in maintaining cell membrane structure and function, 
regulating the production and clearance of Aβ, and supplying energy to the 
brain. Disruptions in these processes are closely linked to the pathological 
progression of AD. The interaction between lipid metabolism and the immune 
system further exacerbates the disease progression of AD. In this review, we 
discuss the lipid metabolism and immune response in AD, summarize their 
intricate interactions, and highlight the complexity of the multifactorial 
pathogenic cascade, offering insights into new interventions targeting the 
immune-metabolic axis in AD.

BACKGROUND: G protein-coupled receptor 43 (GPR43) is a critical signaling 
molecule involved in maintaining energy balance and immune homeostasis, making 
it a widely studied drug target. However, its role in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) 
remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the effects of GPR43 activation 
in an Aβ1−42-induced AD mouse model and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms.
METHODS: Experiments were performed using Aβ1-42-induced C57BL/6 mice (in vivo 
model) and the mouse hippocampal neuronal cell line HT22 (in vitro model). GPR43 
gene expression and protein levels were analyzed in the brains of AD mice. 
Lentivirus-mediated GPR43 overexpression was employed to assess its effects on 
AD-like behaviors and pathological features. Cyclosporin A (CSA), a cyclophilin 
D (CypD) inhibitor, was used to investigate the pathological mechanisms of GPR43 
in AD.
RESULT: Compared to wild-type mice, GPR43 expression was downregulated in the 
cerebral cortex and hippocampus of Aβ1-42-induced AD mice and was primarily 
localized to neurons. GPR43 activation improved spatial learning and memory in 
AD mice. Furthermore, it upregulated the expression of brain-derived 
neurotrophic factor (BDNF), postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95), and 
synaptophysin (SYP), indicating enhanced neuronal and synaptic function. GPR43 
upregulation also modulated the levels of mitochondrial damage-related enzymes, 
including superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), and lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, and reduced mitochondrial swelling. Notably, GPR43 
downregulated CypD protein levels, which are linked to mitochondrial 
permeability transition pore (mPTP) channels, thereby inhibiting apoptosis. 
Finally, in GPR43-knockdown cells, treatment with CSA significantly reduced the 
apoptosis rate, decreased BAX and Caspase-9 levels, and increased BCL-2 
expression.
CONCLUSION: GPR43 inhibits apoptosis in AD mice through the CypD signaling 
pathway, highlighting its potential as a novel target for drug development in AD 
treatment.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized 
by memory loss, synaptic impairment, and biochemical changes. The study aimed to 
investigate the neuroprotective role of ferulic acid (FA) in an AD mouse C57BL/6 
model induced by the Aβ(25-35) peptide. Cognitive deficits, which include memory 
and spatial learning deficits caused by Aβ, were evaluated using a set of 
behavioural tests. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light 
scattering (DLS), and Western blot analysis were used to characterize the 
exosomes from the brain and the serum. The activity of acetylcholinesterase 
(AChE) in exosomes was also evaluated, and the proteomic analysis of the 
serum-derived exosomes was conducted through LC-MS Triple ToF and bioinformatics 
to identify the altered pathways associated with identified proteins. The 
results obtained showed that there were significant alterations in the exosomal 
proteome profile after Aβ treatment. The levels of some of the proteins that are 
involved in energy metabolism, amyloid clearance, cytoskeleton, oxidative 
stress, and neuroinflammation were particularly affected. Treatment with the 
phytochemical FA modulated the exosomal proteome profile alterations and the 
activity of AChE in exosomes, which are some of the hallmarks of cholinergic 
dysfunction in the case of AD. However, the analysis of the proteome of the AD 
condition revealed that there were distinct alterations in the content of 
serum-derived exosomes, which could be used as candidates for non-invasive 
biomarkers of AD progression. This work also highlights the possibility of using 
the phytochemical FA to prevent and treat the neurotoxicity and 
neurodegenerative cascade induced by Aβ and to correct the protein content of 
exosomes in AD.

Mitophagy, the selective autophagic elimination of mitochondria, is essential 
for maintaining mitochondrial quality and cell homeostasis. Impairment of 
mitophagy flux, a process involving multiple sequential intermediates, is 
implicated in the onset of numerous neurodegenerative diseases. Screening 
mitophagy inducers, particularly understanding their impact on mitophagic 
intermediates, is crucial for neurodegenerative disease treatment. However, 
existing techniques do not allow simultaneous visualization of distinct 
mitophagic intermediates in live cells. Here, we introduce an artificial 
intelligence-assisted fluorescence microscopic system (AI-FM) that enables the 
uninterrupted recognition and quantification of key mitophagic intermediates by 
extracting mitochondrial pH and morphological features. Using AI-FM, we identify 
a potential mitophagy modulator, Y040-7904, which enhances mitophagy by 
promoting mitochondria transport to autophagosomes and the fusion of 
autophagosomes with autolysosomes. Y040-7904 also reduces amyloid-β pathologies 
in both in vitro and in vivo models of Alzheimer's disease. This work offers an 
approach for visualizing the entire mitophagy flux, advancing the understanding 
of mitophagy-related mechanisms and enabling the discovery of mitophagy inducers 
for neurodegenerative diseases.

Defining how amyloid-β and pTau together lead to neurodegeneration is 
fundamental to understanding Alzheimer's disease (AD). We used imaging mass 
cytometry to identify neocortical neuronal subtypes lost with AD in post-mortem 
brain middle temporal gyri from non-diseased and AD donors. Here we showed that 
L5,6 RORB+FOXP2+ and L3,5,6 GAD1+FOXP2+ neurons, which accumulate amyloid-β 
intracellularly from early Braak stages, are selectively vulnerable to 
degeneration in AD, while L3 RORB+GPC5+ neurons, which accumulate pTau but not 
amyloid-β, are not lost even at late Braak stages. We discovered spatial 
associations between activated microglia and these vulnerable neurons and found 
that vulnerable RORB+FOXP2+ neuronal transcriptomes are enriched selectively for 
pathways involved in inflammation and glycosylation and, with progression to AD, 
also protein degradation. Our results suggest that the accumulation of 
intraneuronal amyloid-β, which is associated with glial inflammatory pathology, 
may contribute to the initiation of degeneration of these vulnerable neurons.

In recent years, many researchers have focused on natural compounds that can 
effectively delay symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The spearmint extract 
Neumentix, which is rich in phenolic compounds, has been shown to reduce 
inflammatory responses and oxidative stress in mice. However, the effect of 
Neumentix on AD has not been thoroughly studied. In this study, APP23 transgenic 
female and male mice were administered Neumentix orally from 4 to 18 months of 
age at a dosage of 2.65 g/kg/day (containing 0.41 g/kg/day of rosmarinic acid). 
The impact was evaluated by behavioral tests and histological analyses and 
compared with APP23 mice to which Neumentix was not administered. The results 
showed that Neumentix administration increased the survival rate of APP23 mice 
and effectively reduced Aβ accumulation by enhancing its phagocytosis by 
microglial cells. These findings suggest that Neumentix is a potential natural 
nutritional treatment for improving the progression of AD.

Studies indicated that microglial synapse phagocytosis played a critical role in 
synapse loss and pathogenesis in Alzheimer's disease. AXL was one of key 
phagocytic receptors and was upgraded in disease associated microglia. This 
study aimed to investigate the role of AXL-mediated microglial synapse 
phagocytosis in AD mice model. Our data indicated that AXL was increased in 
microglia in 5xFAD mouse AD model. The lentivirus PLV-CXC3CR1-shAXl was applied 
to especially knockdown the AXL expression in microglia and the shAXL treatment 
ameliorated the cognitive impairment in 5xFAD mice. AXL knockdown decreased the 
6E10 positive amyloid plaques, the diffusion index of amyloid plaques and the 
level of phosphorylated Tau. shAXL treatment increased microglial complexity and 
reduced the microglial synapse phagocytosis. This study further demonstrated 
that GEF-H1 was identified as a substrate of AXL and mainly phosphorylated at 
Y470 by AXL. The AXL-mediated GEF-H1-Y470 phosphorylation enhanced the 
phagocytic capacity of BV2. It seems paradoxical that amyloid plaque load and 
microglial phagocytosis were both decreased at the same time when the AXL was 
knockdown, but these indicated that microglia phagocytosis related synapse loss 
played a more critical role in cognitive impairment and AD pathogenesis than 
amyloid plaque load. Our study demonstrated that the activated AXL in microglia 
in 5xFAD enhanced synapse phagocytosis via phosphorylating GEF-H1 at Y470, which 
led to synapse loss and cognitive impairment. The application of AXL blockage 
would be a potential therapeutic strategy for AD treatment.

The hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) integrates multiple sensory inputs and 
encodes spatial memory. DG-dependent spatial memory deficits have been observed 
in early Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our previous study demonstrated that 
glutamate (Glu)-mediated excitotoxicity contributes to spatial learning and 
memory impairment in AD. It has been reported that the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid 
receptor (NMDAR) 2B subunit (NR2B) is predominantly localized to extrasynaptic 
sites, where it is associated with Ca²⁺ neurotoxicity and neuronal loss. 
However, the specific contribution of NR2B-mediated excitotoxicity to DG 
neuronal apoptosis and memory impairment in sporadic AD (sAD) remains unclear. 
In this study, we established a sAD rat model through a single intraventricular 
injection of streptozotocin combined with intraperitoneal injection of 
D-galactose. We investigated the role of NR2B in DG apoptosis and spatial 
learning and memory by microinjecting ifenprodil, an NR2B antagonist, into the 
hippocampal DG. Behavioral tests showed increased escape latency, reduced 
swimming distance in the target quadrant and platform crossings, and the 
significantly increased expression of cleaved caspase-3, PARP, and p-PERK, 
p-eIF2α, and CHOP in the sAD rats. Microinjection of ifenprodil into the DG 
markedly inhibited the levels of p-PERK, p-eIF2α, CHOP, cleaved caspase-3, PARP, 
and neuronal apoptosis in the DG, while also ameliorating the spatial learning 
and memory impairments in sAD rats. These results suggest that NR2B in the 
hippocampal DG is associated with neuronal apoptosis via the PERK-CHOP pathway 
and contributes to the spatial learning and memory deficits observed in sAD 
rats.

the context of Alzheimer's disease.

Peptoids (N-substituted glycine oligomers) represent an excellent platform for 
drug development, such as selective chelators for Cu2+ ions towards chelation 
therapy, due to their efficient synthesis, high stability and good 
bioavailability. We previously showed that peptoids helicity is essential for 
selective Cu2+ binding and identified a unique peptoid hexamer, having 
2,2':6',2″-terpyridine, and 8-hydroxyquinoline as metal-binding sidechains 
facing the same side of the helix, which exhibits high selectivity to Cu2+ ions. 
However, maintaining a stable helix required the incorporation of bulky chiral 
sidechains, resulting in a hydrophobic peptoid, insoluble in aqueous solutions, 
and limited in its use as a drug candidate. Our attempts to solubilize this 
peptoid led to the discovery of a water-soluble sequence able to selectively 
extract Cu2+ from Cu-amyloid complex, and by this stop the formation of reactive 
oxygen species (ROS) in the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This peptoid, 
however, had limited solubility in buffer solutions (that mimic biological 
environment), thus its potential for further development as a therapeutic for AD 
was limited. In this current study, we explore the structure-function 
relationship within a newly synthesized set of helical and water-soluble 
peptoids. By extensive spectroscopic analysis we test the effect of helix 
stability as well as the type and number of the solubilizing group(s) and their 
position along the sequence, on the solubility of these peptoids in buffer, and 
on their selectivity for Cu and ability to inhibit ROS production. The results 
provide insights about the relationships between the structure of the 
peptoids/Cu-peptoids and ROS production inhibition.

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of dementia is increasing in Canada and in many 
countries internationally. People living with dementia are highly dependent on 
family and friend care partners, who may have little knowledge of the disorder. 
Web-based interventions in dementia have been shown to improve care partner 
mental health and reduce burden, but few have been widely implemented or 
rigorously studied. We developed a web- and email-based dementia education 
platform for care partners, iGeriCare, which includes 12 asynchronous, 
multimedia, e-learning lessons and email-based content to reinforce the 
learning.
OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this pilot study is to evaluate the 
feasibility and care partner acceptance of the intervention, including study 
methods. Secondary objectives will examine the effectiveness of the educational 
resources on family care partners' knowledge, self-efficacy, and sense of 
burden.
METHODS: This study is a 2-arm, pilot, feasibility, randomized controlled trial. 
A total of 125 family or friend care partners for a person living with 
dementia-who are residing in Canada, aged 16+ years, and comfortable using the 
internet and email-will be recruited using coinvestigator networks and Facebook 
digital marketing advertisements. Participants will be randomly assigned to 
either the intervention group (receiving the dementia web- and email-based 
educational intervention) or the control group (receiving an alternate topic 
e-learning lesson and emails) and will have 8 weeks to complete baseline surveys 
and the assigned e-learning. After 8 weeks, participants will have 2 weeks to 
complete poststudy surveys. This protocol will be repeated with a second cohort 
of 100 care partners recruited from a paid panel service based on learnings from 
initial feasibility results.
RESULTS: Initial recruitment began on September 6, 2022, and concluded on 
October 2, 2022. A total of 125 participants were randomly assigned to the 
intervention (n=61) or control (n=64) group. Data collection concluded in 
January 2023. Preliminary feasibility results showed a substantial number of 
participants who did not engage with the protocol as intended. A decision was 
made to recruit a second cohort of participants to address these protocol 
deviations. Secondary recruitment began on June 12, 2023, and concluded on June 
27, 2023. A total of 100 participants were randomly assigned to the intervention 
(n=53) or control (n=47) group. Data collection concluded in September 2023. 
Further results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at 
conferences.
CONCLUSIONS: This study is investigating the feasibility, acceptability, and 
effectiveness of a web- and email-based dementia care partner educational 
intervention. The results of this study will contribute to the planning of a 
larger randomized controlled trial in the future, as well as the evaluation of 
innovative, cost-effective, and efficient dementia care partner resources that 
can complement traditional approaches.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review provides an updated overview of amyloid-related 
imaging abnormalities (ARIA) associated with antiamyloid monoclonal antibodies 
(mAbs) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Following regulatory approvals for both 
lecanemab and donanemab in the United States, and pending decisions in Europe, 
standardized understanding of ARIA definitions, risk factors, and optimal MRI 
surveillance is increasingly important to guide treatment and ensure safety.
RECENT FINDINGS: ARIA, including vasogenic edema (ARIA-E) and 
microhemorrhages/siderosis (ARIA-H), are a frequent adverse event in patients 
receiving antiamyloid mAbs, particularly among APOE ε4 homozygotes. Incidence 
varies by agent and trial design. While often asymptomatic and self-limiting, 
ARIA can occasionally present with symptoms or recur. MRI, especially FLAIR and 
susceptibility-sensitive imaging, is essential for baseline risk stratification 
and monitoring. Key imaging biomarkers include microbleeds and superficial 
siderosis. Recent guidelines support genotyping and risk-adapted MRI protocols 
before and during therapy.
SUMMARY: ARIA reflect vascular vulnerability during amyloid clearance in AD. 
Their management requires close collaboration between neurologists and 
neuroradiologists, with harmonized MRI protocols and risk mitigation strategies 
critical for safe and effective use of disease-modifying therapies.

There has been a rapid growth in research on peripheral fluid biomarkers for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-related dementias, because they are 
non-invasive, relatively inexpensive and easily accessible. The most commonly 
used plasma biomarkers include amyloid-β (Aβ), phosphorylated tau (p-tau), 
neurofilament light chain (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). The 
extent to which distinct profiles of multiple plasma biomarkers correlate with 
common neuropathologies is unclear. Using clinicopathologic data from 405 
community-dwelling older adults, we applied latent profile analysis to four 
plasma biomarkers, i.e. Aβ42/40 ratio, p-tau217, NfL and GFAP, and examined the 
correlates of the latent profiles with four degeneration measures: AD, Lewy 
bodies, limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE) and 
hippocampal sclerosis; and five vascular measures: chronic macroscopic infarcts, 
microinfarcts, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, atherosclerosis and 
arteriosclerosis. On average, participants died at the age of 89, and blood 
samples for plasma biomarkers were measured 3.9 years before death. Over 75% 
were female, and 24% were non-Latino Black. We observed three distinct biomarker 
profiles. Profile 1, characterized by low p-tau217, low GFAP, low NfL and high 
Aβ42/40, represented most participants (55.6%), with better than average 
biomarker levels. Both Profile 2 and Profile 3 showed worse than average 
biomarker levels. Profile 2, representing 34.8% of the participants, was high in 
p-tau217 and GFAP. In contrast, Profile 3, representing 9.6% of the 
participants, was high in NfL and GFAP. Examination of neuropathologic 
correlates of these plasma biomarker profiles revealed that Profile 2 
exemplifies older adults with a high burden of neurodegeneration; almost all 
participants (92.9%) in Profile 2 had a diagnosis of pathologic AD, and the 
group also had the highest percentage of participants with Lewy bodies (41.1%). 
In comparison, Profile 3 exemplifies older adults with more severe vascular 
conditions; participants in this group had the highest percentage of macroscopic 
infarcts (31.6%) and moderate or severe atherosclerosis (42.1%). Together, these 
findings suggest that common plasma biomarkers may exhibit profiles reflective 
of distinct pathophysiologic processes.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disease that primarily 
affects the elderly population. The early detection of mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI) holds significant clinical importance for prompt intervention and 
treatment of AD. Currently, functional connectivity (FC) networks-based 
diagnostic methods for early MCI (eMCI) detection are widely employed. FC 
considers the interaction patterns between brain regions as a topological 
structure. Recently, graph neural network (GNN) approaches have been utilized 
for disease diagnosis using FC networks, leveraging their ability to extract 
features from topological structures. However, existing methods typically treat 
FC features as GNN node attributes, disregarding the fact that FC features 
represent the weights of connection edges in FC networks with topological 
characteristics. In this paper, we propose a dynamically weighted GNN-based 
approach for early eMCI detection. Our method takes into account the topological 
structure and dynamic properties of FC networks by utilizing temporal FC 
features as the weighted adjacency matrix for dynamic GNNs. Moreover, the 
weighted graph local clustering coefficient of brain regions is employed as the 
node feature for GNNs. We extensively evaluated our approach using the ADNI 
database and achieved accuracies of 91.67% and 78.33% on low- and high-order FC 
networks, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and 
superiority of our proposed method compared to existing approaches.

BACKGROUND: The growing availability of electronic health records (EHRs) 
presents an opportunity to enhance patient care by uncovering hidden health 
risks and improving informed decisions through advanced deep learning methods. 
However, modeling EHR sequential data, that is, patient trajectories, is 
challenging due to the evolving relationships between diagnoses and treatments 
over time. Significant progress has been achieved using transformers and 
self-supervised learning. While BERT-inspired models using masked language 
modeling (MLM) capture EHR context, they often struggle with the complex 
temporal dynamics of disease progression and interventions.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to improve the modeling of EHR sequences by 
addressing the limitations of traditional transformer-based approaches in 
capturing complex temporal dependencies.
METHODS: We introduce Trajectory Order Objective BERT (Bidirectional Encoder 
Representations from Transformers; TOO-BERT), a transformer-based model that 
advances the MLM pretraining approach by integrating a novel TOO to better learn 
the complex sequential dependencies between medical events. TOO-Bert enhanced 
the learned context by MLM by pretraining the model to distinguish ordered 
sequences of medical codes from permuted ones in a patient trajectory. The TOO 
is enhanced by a conditional selection process that focus on medical codes or 
visits that frequently occur together, to further improve contextual 
understanding and strengthen temporal awareness. We evaluate TOO-BERT on 2 
extensive EHR datasets, MIMIC-IV hospitalization records and the Malmo Diet and 
Cancer Cohort (MDC)-comprising approximately 10 and 8 million medical codes, 
respectively. TOO-BERT is compared against conventional machine learning 
methods, a transformer trained from scratch, and a transformer pretrained on MLM 
in predicting heart failure (HF), Alzheimer disease (AD), and prolonged length 
of stay (PLS).
RESULTS: TOO-BERT outperformed conventional machine learning methods and 
transformer-based approaches in HF, AD, and PLS prediction across both datasets. 
In the MDC dataset, TOO-BERT improved HF and AD prediction, increasing area 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) scores from 67.7 and 
69.5 with the MLM-pretrained Transformer to 73.9 and 71.9, respectively. In the 
MIMIC-IV dataset, TOO-BERT enhanced HF and PLS prediction, raising AUC scores 
from 86.2 and 60.2 with the MLM-pretrained Transformer to 89.8 and 60.4, 
respectively. Notably, TOO-BERT demonstrated strong performance in HF prediction 
even with limited fine-tuning data, achieving AUC scores of 0.877 and 0.823, 
compared to 0.839 and 0.799 for the MLM-pretrained Transformer, when fine-tuned 
on only 50% (442/884) and 20% (176/884) of the training data, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating 
temporal ordering objectives into MLM-pretrained models, enabling deeper 
insights into the complex temporal relationships inherent in EHR data. Attention 
analysis further highlights TOO-BERT's capability to capture and represent 
sophisticated structural patterns within patient trajectories, offering a more 
nuanced understanding of disease progression.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review explores the role of Vitamin D3 and its 
derivatives as inhibitors of pathological metabolic modifications in 
neurodegenerative diseases. The manuscript investigates how Vitamin D3 impacts 
neuronal calcium regulation, antioxidative pathways, immunomodulation, and 
neuroprotection during detoxification, beyond its known functions in intestinal, 
bone, and kidney calcium and phosphorus absorption, as well as bone 
mineralization.
RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have highlighted the synthesis of the active 
metabolite 1,25(OH)2D3 (vitamin D) in glial cells via the hydroxylation process 
of CY-P24A1, an enzyme in the cytochrome P450 system in the brain. The effects 
of vitamin D occur through the vitamin D receptor (VDR), a nuclear steroid 
receptor, which has been identified in various brain regions, including the 
cerebellum, thalamus, hypothalamus, basal ganglia, hippocampus, olfactory 
system, temporal, and orbital regions. Neurodegeneration is primarily associated 
with oxidative stress, protein aggregation, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial 
dysfunction, apoptosis, and autophagy changes, all of which Vitamin D and VDR 
are believed to influence. Vitamin D and VDR are recognized as both 
environmental and genetic factors in the etiopathogenesis of neurodegenerative 
diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's Disease (PD), Alzheimer's 
Disease (AD), and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). A deficiency in Vitamin D 
is postulated to have detrimental effects on the brain and other diseases 
throughout various stages of life. This review consolidates findings from 
clinical and experimental studies, as well as past publications, focusing on the 
implications of Vitamin D deficiency in these neurodegenerative conditions. 
Current articles published in PubMed were extensively considered for this 
review.

BACKGROUND: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of ghrelin gene are 
associated with cognitive function while ghrelin is associated with Alzheimer's 
disease (AD).
AIM: To determine the relationship between ghrelin SNPs, cognitive function, and 
activities of daily living (ADLs) in elderly AD patients.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This study included 100 elderly AD patients as the AD 
group, and 72 elderly healthy patients as the control group. Pearson's 
correlation analysis was performed.
RESULTS: The frequency of the A allele at rs55821288 was significantly higher in 
the AD group than the control group (p < 0.05). Similarly, the frequency of the 
AA genotype at rs55821288 was higher in the AD group than the control group 
(p < 0.05). The MMSE, QOL-AD, and ADLs scores were lower in the AD group than 
the control group (p < 0.05). Pearson's correlation analysis revealed that the A 
allele at rs55821288 was inversely correlated with the MMSE, QOL-AD, and ADLs 
scores (p < 0.05). The distribution of the AA genotype at the rs55821288 locus 
had a negative linear correlation with the MMSE, QOL-AD, and ADLs scores 
(p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Ghrelin allele A and genotype AA are closely associated with 
cognitive function and ADLs among elderly AD patients.

Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a bioactive lipid molecule, has been identified as 
a critical regulator of several cellular processes in the central nervous 
system, with significant impacts on neuronal function, synaptic plasticity, and 
neuroinflammatory responses. While Alzheimer's disease, Multiple Sclerosis, and 
Parkinson's disease have garnered considerable attention due to their incidence 
and socioeconomic significance, many additional neurological illnesses remain 
unclear in terms of underlying pathophysiology and prospective treatment 
targets. This review synthesizes evidence linking LPA's function in neurological 
diseases such as traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, cerebellar ataxia, 
cerebral ischemia, seizures, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis, Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome, autism, migraine, and human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated complications Despite recent advances, 
the specific mechanisms underlying LPA's actions in various neurological 
disorders remain unknown, and further research is needed to understand the 
distinct roles of LPA across multiple disease conditions, as well as to 
investigate the therapeutic potential of targeting LPA receptors in these 
pathologies. The purpose of this review is to highlight the multiple functions 
of LPA in the aforementioned neurological diseases, which frequently share the 
same poor prognosis due to a scarcity of truly effective therapies, while also 
evaluating the role of LPA, its receptors, and signaling as promising actors for 
the development of alternative therapeutic strategies to those proposed today.

INTRODUCTION: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
are essential for the early identification of non-amnestic phenotypes. Increased 
levels of total tau (t-tau) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) have been reported in 
atypical AD cases, although the specific pattern remains a subject of debate. 
This study aimed to evaluate CSF biomarker profiles in relation to clinical 
phenotype.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was performed, analyzing 
demographic data, time to diagnosis, clinical phenotype, and core AD biomarkers 
(beta-amyloid peptide 1-42 (Aβ1-42), t-tau, p-tau) in CSF from patients 
evaluated at University Hospital in Navarra between 2019 and 2022.
RESULTS: The study included 57 patients (54% female, mean age 67 years), of whom 
41 met AD diagnostic criteria. Among these, 10 patients (25%) presented with 
atypical phenotypes (50% aphasic, 30% frontal, 20% mixed non-amnestic). Compared 
with the amnestic phenotype, the atypical group exhibited significantly higher 
t-tau (562.9 pg/mL vs 320.3 pg/mL, p = 0.021) and p-tau (81.5 pg/mL vs 37.7 
pg/mL, p = 0.016) levels, independent of age, sex, and time to diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Atypical cases demonstrated increased tau levels, suggesting 
earlier and more extensive cortical damage than the amnestic phenotype. These 
findings underscore the significance of CSF biomarkers in phenotypic 
differentiation, disease course prediction, and individualized treatment 
strategies for AD.

Publisher: Introducción: Los biomarcadores de la Enfermedad de Alzheimer (EA) en 
líquido cefalorraquídeo (LCR) tienen un papel significativo en el diagnóstico 
precoz de fenotipos no-amnésicos. Se han descrito mayores niveles de tau total 
(t-tau) y tau fosforilada (p-tau) en casos atípicos de EA, aunque la existencia 
de un patrón diferencial sigue siendo controvertida. Nuestro objetivo fue 
estudiar las diferencias en el perfil de biomarcadores de EA en LCR en función 
del fenotipo. Material y Métodos: Revisión retrospectiva de características 
demográficas, tiempo hasta el diagnóstico, fenotipo clínico y biomarcadores 
“core” (péptido beta-amiloide 1-42 (Aβ1-42), t-tau, p-tau) de EA en LCR de 
pacientes valorados en nuestro centro entre 2019–2022. Resultados: 57 fueron 
pacientes analizados (54% mujeres, edad media 67 años). 41 cumplían criterios 
diagnósticos de EA. De ellos, 10 (25%) presentaron un perfil atípico (50% 
afásico, 30% frontal, 20% mixto no amnésico). El grupo atípico presentó niveles 
mayores de t-tau (562,9 pg/mL vs 320,3 pg/mL, p = 0,021) y p-tau (81,5 pg/mL vs 
37,7 pg/mL, p = 0,016) respecto al fenotipo amnésico, independientemente de la 
edad, sexo y tiempo hasta el diagnóstico. Conclusiones: En nuestro estudio, los 
casos atípicos presentaron valores de tau más elevados. Dichos resultados apoyan 
que estos fenotipos presentan daño cortical más precoz y grave que el fenotipo 
amnésico y subrayan la importancia de los biomarcadores en LCR como herramienta 
para la estratificación, predicción del curso clínico y personalización 
terapéutica de nuestros pacientes.

Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by progressive neuronal loss and 
dysfunction, with protein kinases playing crucial roles in their pathogenesis. 
This article explores the involvement of protein kinases in these disorders, 
focusing on their contributions to disease mechanisms, potential as therapeutic 
targets and challenges in developing effective treatments. In Alzheimer's 
disease, kinases such as CDK5, GSK3β and MARK4 are implicated in tau 
hyperphosphorylation and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles. Kinases also 
regulate amyloid-β processing and plaque formation. In Parkinson's disease, 
LRRK2, PINK1 and other kinases contribute to α-synuclein pathology, 
mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation. LRRK2 inhibitors and PROTACs 
have shown promise in preclinical models. Huntington's disease involves altered 
kinase activity, with CK2, GSK3 and MAPK pathways influencing mutant huntingtin 
toxicity and aggregation. Kinases are also implicated in less common 
neurodegenerative diseases, such as ALS and spinocerebellar ataxias. Despite the 
therapeutic potential of targeting kinases, challenges remain, including the 
complexity of kinase networks, blood-brain barrier permeability and the lack of 
robust biomarkers. Emerging technologies, such as covalent inhibitors, targeted 
protein degradation and combination therapies, offer new avenues for addressing 
these challenges and developing more effective treatments for neurodegenerative 
diseases.

In this review, we describe the concept of the glymphatic system as a 
glial-dependent clearance pathway in the brain. The hypothesis of the glymphatic 
system function suggests that dural lymphatic vessels absorb the cerebrospinal 
fluid and brain interstitial fluid via the glymphatic system and transport fluid 
into deep cervical lymph nodes. We present the accumulated data of various 
studies confirming the possible interconnection among the brain interstitial 
fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, and the glymphatic system. Anatomical features are 
discussed here together with a possible variety of glymphatic system functions, 
including the removal of waste products, transport of substances, and immune 
function. The glymphatic system is hypothesized to be involved in pathogenesis 
of many diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and Parkinson's 
disease. We also discuss the role of the glymphatic system in pathophysiology 
and the complications of brain tumors. Meningeal lymphatics is thoroughly 
analyzed as well. Finally, we propose new treatment approaches to brain tumors, 
Parkinson's disease, and stroke using cervical lymph nodes and backward fluid 
flow in the meningeal lymphatic vessels.

Clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease (AD) must be registered on 
clinicaltrials.gov. The registry presents a variety of types of information 
related to the planned clinical trial. We assess clinicaltrials.gov to document 
and compare aspects of drug development across the AD pipeline. Currently, there 
are 138 drugs being assessed in 182 clinical trials in the AD pipeline. 
Biological disease-targeted therapies (DTTs) comprise 30% of the pipeline; small 
molecule DTTs account for 43% of the pipeline; drugs addressing cognitive 
enhancement account for 14% of the pipeline; and drugs aiming to ameliorate 
neuropsychiatric symptoms in participants with AD contribute 11% of the 
pipeline. Biomarkers are among the primary outcomes of 27% of active trials. 
Repurposed agents represent 33% of the pipeline agents. The pipeline has more 
trials and more drugs compared to the 2024 pipeline.
HIGHLIGHTS: The 2025 Alzheimer's disease drug development pipeline hosts 182 
trials and 138 novel drugs.The 2025 Alzheimer's disease drug development 
pipeline is diverse, with agents that address 15 basic disease processes.The 
2025 Alzheimer's disease drug development pipeline has more trials and more 
drugs than the 2024 pipeline.Biomarkers play an important role in current trials 
to determine trial eligibility and as outcomes of trials.Repurposed agents 
comprise approximately one-third of the agents and trials in the 2025 
Alzheimer's disease drug development pipeline.

MCID (minimal clinically important difference) is a patient-centered concept 
used in clinical research that represents the smallest change that someone 
living with Alzheimer's disease would identify as important. There are several 
challenges associated with the universal application of this construct. 
Alzheimer's disease progresses differently for each individual, complicating the 
establishment of a universal standard that accounts for individual-level issues. 
Alzheimer's disease is also a gradual and evolving disorder, and what is 
perceived as clinically meaningful can vary significantly at early and late 
disease stages. People living with Alzheimer's disease and caregivers may have 
differing perspectives on the benefits of treatment outcomes, making it more 
challenging to establish an appropriate MCID. Moreover, Alzheimer's trials rely 
on a variety of tests to evaluate cognitive and functional impairments. However, 
these tests often lack sensitivity to early-stage changes and are affected by 
variability in rater rankings. Digital biomarkers and advanced health 
technologies have emerged as a hot topic in modern medicine. They offer a 
promising approach for detecting real-time, objective clinical differences and 
improving patient outcomes by enabling continuous monitoring, individualized 
assessments, and leveraging artificial intelligence learning for complex 
analytical predictions. However, while these advancements hold great potential, 
they also raise important considerations around standardization, accuracy, and 
integration into current clinical frameworks. As new technologies are introduced 
alongside evolving regulatory frameworks, the primary focus must remain on 
outcomes that truly matter to people living with Alzheimer's disease and their 
caregivers, ensuring that the principle of clinical meaningfulness is not lost.
HIGHLIGHTS: Minimal clinically important difference (MCID) represents the 
smallest change in a patient's condition that would be considered meaningful, 
but defining this for Alzheimer's disease is challenging due to its 
heterogeneity.The perception of what is clinically meaningful may differ at the 
individual level, at different disease stages within the same individual, and 
between patient and caregiver.Traditional tests used as endpoints in Alzheimer's 
trials lack the sensitivity to detect subtle changes and are limited by range 
restrictions, making them less effective for accurately capturing treatment 
efficacy.Digital biomarkers and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven health 
technologies may offer the potential to enhance the detection of clinically 
meaningful changes by providing continuous, objective monitoring and advanced 
analytics for individualized patient assessments.Both the United States Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) are playing 
pivotal roles in advancing the use of digital health technologies, facilitating 
the evolution of regulatory frameworks to ensure these innovations are 
effectively integrated into clinical research and practice.

The identification of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated genomic variants has 
provided powerful insight into disease etiology. Genome-wide association studies 
(GWAS) for AD have successfully identified new targets but have almost 
exclusively utilized additive genetic models. Here, we performed a family-based 
GWAS under a recessive inheritance model using whole genome sequencing from 
families affected by AD. We found that the variant, rs7161410, located in an 
intron of the PRKCH gene, encoding protein kinase C eta (PKCη), was associated 
with AD risk (p-value=1.41 × 10-7). Further analysis revealed a rare PRKCH 
missense mutation K65R in linkage disequilibrium with rs7161410, which was 
present in homozygous carriers of the rs7161410 risk allele. We show that this 
mutation leads to enhanced localization and signaling of PKCη at the Golgi. The 
novel genetically-validated association of aberrant PKCη signaling with AD opens 
avenues for new therapeutic targets aimed at prevention and treatment.

Neuroinflammation plays a crucial role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), contributing to both cognitive decline and motor impairment. This review 
examines the dual impact of neuroinflammatory processes, particularly the 
activation of microglia and astrocytes, and the dysregulated release of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, on cognition and balance in AD. 
Neuroinflammation leads to synaptic dysfunction, oxidative stress, and 
mitochondrial impairment, which accelerate neuronal damage and disrupt motor 
circuits, such as those in the motor cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. 
These disruptions result in motor symptoms like gait disruption and balance 
issues, reflecting the close interplay between cognitive and motor functions. In 
addition, we highlighted the role of blood-brain barrier disruption and 
peripheral neuropathy in increasing motor dysfunction. Despite the promise of 
anti-inflammatory treatments, clinical trials with non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs have yielded mixed results, underscoring the need for 
early intervention and more targeted therapies. Therefore, understanding the 
mechanisms linking neuroinflammation to cognitive and motor impairments may 
guide the development of new therapeutic approaches aimed at mitigating the 
complex pathology of AD.

Alzheimer's subtypes A supervised, unsupervised, multimodal, multilayered 
embedded recursive (SUMMER) AI study.

Kinreich S, Bingly A, Pandey G.

Since Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a heterogeneous disease, different subtypes 
may have distinct biological, genetic, and clinical characteristics, requiring 
tailored interventions. While several proposed subtypes of AD exist, there is 
still no clear consensus on a definitive classification. By leveraging 
complementary AI approaches, including supervised and unsupervised learning, 
within a recursive pipeline (SUMMER) that integrates multimodal datasets 
encompassing MRI measurements, phenotypes, and genetic data, our goal was to 
generate robust scientific evidence for identifying AD subtypes. Data was 
downloaded from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database 
and included neuroimaging data (MRI), genetics (SNPs), clinical diagnosis, and 
demographics. 1133 European American participants' images, aged 55-95, were 
included in this study. The analysis was multi-fold, where the first step 
involved applying an unsupervised application to a subset of the MRI sample (AD 
+ cognitively normal (CN) aged matched groups, 100 men aged 68-85 years, and 76 
women aged 68-85 years). The MRI brain gray matter was segmented into 44 regions 
of interest (ROIs) according to a standard atlas, and 618 features were 
extracted, including ROI voxel intensity measurements such as minimum, maximum, 
and histogram variables. Results identified a cluster of subtype AD men and a 
cluster of subtype AD women that were distinct from the rest of their respective 
samples. In the next step, the integrity of the identified subtype AD clusters 
was investigated using the XGBoost supervised machine learning application with 
genetic features (SNPs, N=36,724) and labels: the identified subtype AD cluster 
vs. the rest of the sample, stratified by sex. A significant AD subtype men 
model (accuracy=0.85, F1=0.72, AUC=0.83) and a significant women AD subtype 
model (accuracy=0.81, F1=0.81, AUC=0.81) were built, confirming the homogeneity 
of the isolated AD subtype clusters. Discriminative biomarkers were extracted 
from the significant models, including selected ROIs and SNPs. Finally, the 
subtype models were tested on an unseen subset of ADNI data. The genetic-based 
models identified clusters of AD subtype participants consisting of 34% of the 
men AD group and 47% of the women AD group. Phenotypic analysis indicates that 
lower body weight was associated with the women's AD subtype. Complex diseases 
like AD demand a sophisticated, multimodal approach for precise diagnosis. 
Effectively identifying disease subtypes enhances the potential for personalized 
treatment, ultimately improving patient outcomes.

Cryo-EM evidence for a common factor in Alzheimer's and other 
neurodegenerations.

In the last seven years, cryo-EM maps of neuropathological fibrils from 
Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerations have been released by various 
authors1-44. The first publication11 noted an unknown component coordinating 
with lysine residues in the protein, a finding recapitulated in many succeeding 
studies. Previous authors have emphasized difficulties in analysing this 
component12,20,28,33,43,45, but current findings, using powerful visualisation 
software UCSF ChimeraX46 on all publicly available maps1-44, indicate that the 
issue is tractable. Lysine-coordinating extra densities have common features, 
including a Y-shaped substructure, suggestive of a molecular factor in common, 
in neuropathological fibrils from a wide range of neurodegenerations and 
involving misfolded proteins beta-amyloid10,35, alpha-synuclein27,37,39,41, 
prion protein17, tau1,5,7,8,11,12,15,16,19,22-26,29-33,35,43 and transmembrane 
protein 106B5,9,18,20,24,28,36,44. A similar component, albeit in non-lysine 
environments, was found in neuropathological fibrils involving TAR DNA-binding 
protein 432,3 and TATA-binding protein-associated factor 1536. The results 
suggest the existence of a common molecular factor, a predominantly anionic 
polymer, linking these diseases and raising the possibility of a unitary basis 
for Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerations. Based on evidence here, RNA is a 
feasible candidate for this putative common factor. Such findings raise the 
possibility of new diagnostic tests and treatments for these devastating 
diseases in the future.

INTRODUCTION: Developing effective therapeutics for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) 
requires a better understanding of the molecular drivers of the disease. Our 
previous work nominated DLGAP2 as a modifier of age-related cognitive decline 
and risk for AD. We tested the hypothesis that overexpression of DLGAP2 in the 
hippocampus would protect against cognitive and synaptic deficits in a 
susceptible F1 5XFAD model.
METHODS: DLGAP2 was overexpressed in the hippocampus of F1 hybrid 5XFAD and 
nontransgenic littermates using a viral approach. Cognitive function, 
electrophysiological properties, and dendritic spine morphology were assessed at 
6 and 14 months of age.
RESULTS: DLGAP2 overexpression impaired synaptic plasticity and exacerbated 
AD-related memory deficits but had minimal effect on spine structure or 
intrinsic neuronal properties.
DISCUSSION: We highlight the complex role of DLGAP2 in AD pathology. Targeted 
interventions involving postsynaptic proteins must consider potential adverse 
effects on synaptic integrity and cognitive performance, particularly in the 
context of AD.

Fluctuations of extracellular brain ion concentrations have been associated with 
transitions between brain states such as sleep and wakefulness, and disturbances 
have been implicated in a variety of neurological conditions, including 
dementia, epilepsy and migraine. This study aims to define the normal CSF ion 
profile and identify key factors influencing its regulation. In this 
cross-sectional study, we analysed samples from 42 individuals (16 men), 
including 28 healthy participants and 14 patients with medically unexplained 
neurological symptoms. Age spanned between 20 and 55 years. Using validated 
clinical assays, we measured paired CSF and serum concentrations of Ca²⁺, Cl⁻, 
K⁺, Mg²⁺ and Na⁺. We examined their interrelationships and assessed the impact 
of blood-brain barrier permeability (the albumin quotient), age, sampling time 
and sex. CSF ion concentrations were highly stable and maintained within 
distinct, narrow ranges, separate from serum ranges for all ions measured (P < 
0.0001), with no overlapping. Cl- (+25%), Na+ (+5%) and Mg2+ (+37%) 
concentrations were higher, while K+ (-30%) and Ca2+ (-50%) concentrations were 
lower. Consistent with an independent and active CNS homeostatic control, CSF 
concentrations of K+, Cl- or Mg2+ showed no significant correlation with their 
serum counterparts, while Na+ and Ca2+ displayed moderate associations with 
serum levels. Moreover, blood-brain barrier permeability had no significant 
impact on CSF ion concentrations. Small, but significant, age-related declines 
were observed for Cl-, Mg2+ and Ca2+ in CSF, and circadian fluctuations affected 
K+, which increased slightly in the afternoon. Minor sex differences were noted, 
with men exhibiting slightly higher Mg2+ and Ca2+ levels. Our findings 
demonstrate that CSF ion concentrations are precisely regulated at the barriers 
of the CNS, largely independent of serum levels and with low interindividual 
variation, reinforcing the concept of a highly controlled CNS environment. This 
distinct ion composition may help modulate neuronal excitability, supporting 
brain state transitions such as sleep-wake cycling. Identification of hydration 
status as a potential confounding factor suggests that normalization to CSF-Na+ 
may improve the detection of pathological disruptions in CSF ion homeostasis. 
These insights reinforce the foundation for using CSF ion profiles as biomarkers 
for neurological disorders.

Glymphatic system has been identified as a fluid exchange network in brain 
parenchymal for removal of toxic metabolites in Alzheimer's disease. However, a 
clinically feasible, accurate, and non-invasive imaging technique for mapping 
global glymphatic fluid distribution throughout the entire brain and monitoring 
its dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease is currently lacking. This 
cross-sectional retrospective study aims to compare three MRI-based measures of 
the glymphatic system structural alterations, a novel multi-echo T2 
relaxometry-based parenchymal CSF (pCSF) mapping, T2 weighted-based segmented 
perivascular space burden, and diffusion tensor imaging-based free-water 
mapping. We evaluated their cross-correlation and investigated their respective 
association with PET measured beta-amyloid deposition using 11C-PiB PET. A total 
of 29 subjects (18 Female, age: 70.07 ± 8.73 years old), among them, 16 were 
cognitively normal and 13 were mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease, 
underwent both MRI and 11C-PiB PET scans. Parenchymal CSF mapping, 
diffusion-based free-water mapping and perivascular spaces burden were generated 
from their respective MRI. Age and sex effects and group differences of these 
biomarkers were evaluated. The associations among these measures and Aβ 
deposition on 11C-PiB PET were analysed and compared. Our analysis demonstrated 
moderate correlations between pCSF, diffusion-based free-water mapping and 
perivascular space burden, suggesting these biomarkers capture overlapping yet 
distinct aspects of glymphatic fluid distribution. Importantly, linear 
regression analyses revealed that pCSF exhibited a significantly stronger 
positive association with beta-amyloid deposition (white matter: t = 3.536, P = 
0.002, R 2 = 0.446; Alzheimer's disease-related meta regions: t = 4.510, P < 
0.001, R 2 = 0.541), compared with diffusion-based free-water mapping in white 
matter (t = 0.843, P = 0.407, R 2 = 0.191) and perivascular space burden (t = 
0.422, P = 0.677, R 2 = 0.174), after adjusting for age and sex. This study 
identifies pCSF mapping, derived from multi-echo T2 data with clinically 
feasible 5 mins scan FAST-T2 sequence, as a potential non-invasive imaging 
biomarker for assessing glymphatic dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease. The 
superior sensitivity of pCSF mapping arises from its direct quantification of 
glymphatic fluid at the water molecular level based on free CSF-specific T2 
relaxation properties. These results suggest that pCSF could be useful in the 
monitoring of Alzheimer's disease progression as beta-amyloid accumulating and 
predicting response to anti-amyloid therapies, potentially leading to better 
diagnostic strategies and therapeutic interventions of Alzheimer's disease.

AIMS: Curcumin (CUR) exhibits strong therapeutic potential for Alzheimer's 
disease due to its antioxidant, neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and 
anti-amyloid effects. However, its clinical application is limited by poor brain 
bioavailability. This study aimed to enhance CUR delivery to the brain via nasal 
administration using a novel formulation of polyethylene glycol 
(PEG)-functionalized carboxylated (COOH) Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes (MWCNT).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: CUR-loaded MWCNT-COOH-PEG was developed and optimized 
using a 32 factorial design. The system was characterized for entrapment 
efficiency, particle size, zeta potential, and in vitro release. Neuroprotective 
efficacy was assessed through apoptosis inhibition in PC12 cells, and CUR 
concentration in the brain was measured post-nasal administration.
RESULTS: The formulation achieved an entrapment efficiency of 91.4 ± 0.8%, a 
zeta potential of -31.1 ± 1.05 mV, and a particle size of 310 ± 7.92 nm. In 
vitro release was 95.42 ± 0.0004% at pH 5.5 and 89.98 ± 0.0039% at pH 7.4. CUR 
at 18.75 µg/mL inhibited apoptosis in PC12 cells after 24 h. Higher brain CUR 
concentrations were observed 4 h post-administration.
CONCLUSION: CUR-loaded MWCNT-COOH-PEG effectively enhances brain bioavailability 
of CUR, demonstrating significant neuroprotective effects, and offers a 
promising approach for Alzheimer's therapy.

Microtubule associated protein tau (MAPT) is a naturally occurring protein that 
plays a significant role in stabilizing microtubules, which are essential for 
the transport of nutrients and other materials within neurons. In tauopathies, 
tau protein assembles into mis-folded multimers ranging from soluble oligomers 
to insoluble aggregates, known as neurofibrillary tangles, neuropil threads and 
are components of neuritic plaques. These abnormal tau assemblies collectively 
are thought to disrupt the normal function of neurons and lead to their death. 
Tauopathies are a leading cause of neurodegeneration, and there are no approved 
disease modifying therapies targeting the tau pathology for any tauopathy. This 
review is a two-year update to an initial review of preclinical, clinical, and 
recently discontinued therapeutic programs in development focused on 
ameliorating tau pathology. This review outlines the landscape of therapeutic 
drugs indexed through January 1, 2025. Currently, there are 170 drugs monitored 
in the pipeline, one less than in the previous period. In the clinic, there are 
five candidates in phase 3 trials, 15 in phase 2 trials, and 12 in phase 1 
trials. In total, there are four less candidates in clinical trials during this 
review period than the last. New to this review is the inclusion of the clinical 
development of tau positron emission tomography (PET) ligands which undergo 
regulatory oversite. In addition to the one FDA-approved tau PET ligand Tauvid™ 
(flortaucipir), there are six additional tau PET ligands currently in active 
clinical trials.

BACKGROUND: As a key inflammatory factor, the nucleotide-binding oligomerization 
domain (NOD)-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome plays a crucial role 
in neuroinflammation and the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. 
Dysregulation of NLRP3 signaling can trigger various inflammatory responses in 
the brain, contributing to the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as 
ischemic stroke, vascular dementia (VaD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's 
disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Therefore, the NLRP3 
signaling pathway is a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of 
neurodegenerative diseases, including VaD.
METHODS: In this study, we investigated the therapeutic effects of a synthetic 
sulfonylurea NLRP3 inhibitor, AMS-17, in a VaD mouse model using bilateral 
common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) and elucidated the underlying mechanisms. 
All mice were randomly divided into three groups: Sham, VaD + Vehicle, and 
VaD + AMS-17. Cognitive function was assessed using the Y-maze and Morris water 
maze (MWM) on the 50th day after BCAS. Brain sections and blood serum samples 
were collected for biomarker analysis and immunohistochemistry. 
Neurodegeneration, expressions of the molecules involved in the NLRP3 signaling 
pathways, tight junction proteins, and myelination were assessed using western 
blotting and immunofluorescence (IF). The levels of Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), 
Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α) and Interleukin-4 (IL-4) in the blood were 
measured using ELISA.
RESULTS: AMS-17 treatment improved cognitive function, enhanced blood-brain 
barrier (BBB) integrity, and promoted remyelination in VaD mice. Additionally, 
AMS-17 reduced neurodegeneration and decreased the expression of NLRP3 and its 
associated proteins, Apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC), and cleaved 
caspase-1 in the brain. It also lowered pro-inflammatory TNF-α and IL-1β levels, 
while increasing the anti-inflammatory IL-4 level in the blood.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study provide the first promising evidence for 
the use of AMS-17 in VaD treatment in mice. This study introduces AMS-17 as a 
novel chemical scaffold with NLRP3 inhibitory activity, which can be further 
developed for the treatment of VaD in humans.

BACKGROUND: Physical exercise is known to promote cognitive resilience in aging 
and Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely 
understood. Lactate, a metabolic byproduct elevated during exercise, has 
recently emerged as a potential neuromodulator of brain function.
METHODS: Three AD-like mouse models (SAMP8, Aβ1-42 injection, and 5xFAD) were 
used to evaluate the effects of treadmill exercise on cognitive function and 
synaptic plasticity. Serum lactate levels were assessed, and sodium L-lactate 
(NaLA) was administered to determine its neuroprotective effects. Transcriptomic 
analysis was performed on hippocampal tissue to explore lactate-regulated 
pathways. Lactate transport was pharmacologically inhibited using 4-CIN for 
mechanistic validation.
RESULTS: Treadmill exercise significantly improved cognitive performance and 
increased synapse-associated protein expression in AD models. Exercise elevated 
serum lactate levels, and exogenous NaLA administration recapitulated the 
cognitive and synaptic benefits of exercise. Transcriptomic profiling revealed 
enrichment of genes involved in axon guidance and synaptic organization, 
including upregulation of multiple Eph receptor family genes. 
α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (4-CIN) administration abolished the 
exercise-induced neuroprotective effects, confirming the essential role of 
lactate transport in mediating these benefits.
CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies lactate as a critical mediator linking 
exercise to enhanced synaptic function and cognitive improvement in AD-like 
models, providing mechanistic insights and highlighting lactate metabolism as a 
potential therapeutic target for AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common age-related neurodegenerative 
disease worldwide. The pathogenesis of AD is related to the progressive neuronal 
apoptosis due to the advanced accumulation of extracellular amyloid beta (Aβ) 
peptide and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which are caused by 
hyperphosphorylation of tau protein. The accumulation of Aβ and NFTs in AD is 
affected by diverse signaling pathways, such as Janus tyrosine kinase (JAK) and 
signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT), which are involved in 
the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. This signaling pathway controls cell 
proliferation, differentiation, and survival. The JAK/STAT signaling pathway 
plays a critical role in the development of neurodegeneration and 
neuroinflammation in AD. Also, suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS), a 
negative regulator of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, is also affected in AD. 
Nevertheless, the fundamental mechanism for the dysregulation of the 
JAK/STAT3/SOCS signaling pathway in AD is not completely explained. Henceforth, 
this review aims to explain and discuss the precise role of the JAK/STAT3/SOCS 
signaling pathway in AD and how targeting of this pathway could be effective in 
the management of AD.

Neurological and psychiatric disorders are considered one of the major problems 
of today's societies and cause many individual and social problems. Current 
treatments are effective, but due to their burdens, there is always an effort to 
introduce novel treatments. Psychedelics, a diverse group of psychoactive 
compounds, including LSD, psilocybin, DMT, MDMA, and ketamine, have shown 
potential in modulating neurologic and psychiatric disorders due to several 
mechanisms. This review investigates the therapeutic potential of psychedelics 
in both neurologic and neuropsychiatric disorders due to their several 
mechanisms such as anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and biological properties. 
This study was conducted across major databases, such as PubMed, Scopus, Web of 
Science, Google Scholar, and Medline, due to the systematically searched 
literature including clinical, preclinical, and in vitro studies. Psychedelic 
compounds such as psilocybin, LSD, and MDMA have demonstrated beneficial effects 
across various models of neuropsychiatric and neurologic disorders, including 
depression, PTSD, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. These effects 
are mediated through multiple mechanisms, including anti-inflammatory actions 
(e.g., downregulation of cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α), antioxidant activity 
(e.g., induction of SOD), and enhancement of neuroplasticity through increased 
expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor such as BDNF. Additionally, 
psychedelics modulate key neurotransmitter systems, notably increasing synaptic 
levels of serotonin and dopamine, which are critically involved in mood 
regulation and cognitive function. Compared to conventional treatments, 
psychedelics offer faster onset, durable effects, and possible disease-modifying 
properties, making them promising candidates for future neurotherapeutics.

Amyloid burden impacts cognitive decline in the pre-dementia stages of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), but there remains significant variability in cognitive 
trajectories that may be explainable by markers of synaptic function and 
neurodegeneration. Leveraging longitudinal data from two harmonized, at-risk but 
predominantly unimpaired cohorts, we examined how several proteins measured from 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) differ by amyloid status, cognitive status, and impact 
cognitive decline measured using a Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite. 
Four hundred and thirty-four individuals provided CSF biomarkers of 
amyloid-beta42 (ab42), phosphorylated tau (181), from which we identified 
Aβ + individuals using a cutoff based on a p-tau181/Aβ42 ratio. Other markers of 
neurodegeneration (N) included neurofilament light, neurogranin, SNAP-25, and 
NPTX2. Most biomarkers of N were higher in the Aβ + group and lower in 
cognitively unimpaired individuals, though NPTX2 exhibited the opposite pattern. 
Even in the face of Aβ+, NPTX2 was higher in individuals who showed slower rates 
of cognitive decline, suggesting NPTX2 may be associated with cognitive 
resilience. Moreover, a SNAP-25/NPTX2 ratio of synaptic dysfunction explained 
more variance in cognitive decline than other biomarkers alone. This work 
provides support for potentially useful biomarkers of synaptic function 
implicated in the clinical syndrome of AD, aiding in future diagnosis and 
staging efforts.

The advancement of neuroprotective pharmacological agents to proficiently avert 
amyloid-β (Aβ) clustering persists as a significant obstacle in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) management. This analysis focuses on the inhibitory characteristics 
related to amyloid formation of selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) enveloped in 
5-caffeoylquinic acid (CQA), which are biosynthesized using violet sweet potato 
(PSP) extract. Engineered SeNPs revealed an absorption peak at 260 nm, were 
spherical and non-crystalline (50-60 nm), and had a zeta potential measured at 
24.3 ± 2.1 mV. The antioxidant traits of SeNPs were showcased (IC50 = 8.01 ± 
1.21 µg/mL), by obstructing AChE (IC50 = 3.70 ± 0.02 µg/mL) and BChE (IC50 = 72 
± 0.5 µg/mL), while also diminishing Aβ fibrillation, thereby emphasizing their 
function in the modulation of amyloid clustering. Molecular dynamics simulations 
elucidated that CQA-SeNPs preferentially associate with hydrophobic residues 
(e.g., Leu34 and Phe19) of the Aβ peptide, obstructing β-sheet formation. These 
findings suggest that CQA-SeNPs interfere with Aβ aggregation, offering a 
potential therapeutic strategy for AD.

Caloric restriction and ketogenic diets may modify the progression of 
neurological disorders, including HIV-associated neurological disorders and 
Alzheimer's disease, in part by influencing astrocyte function. This study 
examines how metabolic substrate availability affects metabolic processes and 
gene expression in human astrocytes. We exposed astrocytes to the glycolysis 
inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), to mimic caloric restriction, prior to 
stimulation with interleukin-1β and measured extracellular flux using the 
Seahorse ® platform. We next analyzed gene expression and chromatin 
accessibility changes using RNA-sequencing and ATAC-sequencing, respectively. 
Finally, we tested the effects of glucose deprivation and the ketone body 
β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) on inflammatory gene expression. 2-DG reduced oxygen 
consumption rate and extracellular acidification rate in the presence of IL-1β, 
while concomitantly decreasing expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF, 
IL-6, and C3. These changes were linked to altered chromatin structure. The 
metabolic substrate β-hydroxybutyrate was associated with reduced cytokine 
expression compared to glucose. Inhibition of glycolysis attenuated 
IL-1β-induced inflammation and gene expression changes and altered chromatin 
architecture. Both glucose deprivation and BHB treatment reduced inflammatory 
cytokine expression, with additive effects when combined with 2-DG. These 
results suggest that targeting glycolysis could provide therapeutic strategies 
for treating neurological diseases through modulation of astrocyte-driven 
inflammation.

In this study, a novel series of 1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalines containing a 
sulfonamide moiety was designed and synthesized through regioselective synthesis 
from 2 and/ 3-hydrazino-6-(pyrrolidin-1-ylsulfonyl)quinoxaline derivatives 5 and 
7. The structures of two isomers were confirmed and characterized by IR,1H 
NMR,13C NMR, and elemental analysis data. The synthesized 
1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-a]quinoxaline derivatives 8-13 were evaluated for their 
antidiabetic activities by targeting α-amylase and α-glucosidase, as well as for 
their anti-Alzheimer activity by targeting acetylcholinesterase (AChE) at a 
concentration of 100 µM. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis was 
conducted for all analogs, emphasizing the nature of the substituent groups at 
position one of the triazole nucleus and the positioning of the sulfonamide 
moiety. For α-amylase and α-glucosidase activity, the designed compounds 
exhibited moderate to good activity, with inhibitory percentage values ranging 
from 21.85 ± 0.01% to 64.70 ± 0.02% and from 23.93 ± 0.01% to 75.36 ± 0.01%, 
respectively. The N-allyl-[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-amine derivative 
10a demonstrated the most significant inhibitory activity, with percentages of 
64.70 ± 0.02% and 75.36 ± 0.01% against α-amylase and α-glucosidase, 
respectively, in comparison to acarbose (IP = 67.33 ± 0.01% and 57.79 ± 0.01%). 
Furthermore, the 1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-a]quinoxaline derivatives 8-13 exhibited low 
to moderate inhibitory percentages against the acetylcholinesterase enzyme, 
except for the 1-methyl-[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a]quinoxaline derivative 11b which 
demonstrated the highest inhibitory percentage of 44.78 ± 0.01%, compared to 
donepezil (IP = 67.27 ± 0.60%). Moreover, the promising derivative 10a 
demonstrated exceptional inhibitory activity, exhibiting IC50 values of 
3.46 ± 0.06 µM and 6.89 ± 0.09 µM against α-glucosidase and α-amylase, 
respectively, when compared to acarbose, which has IC50 values of 4.27 ± 0.06 µM 
and 5.90 ± 0.09 µM. Finally, molecular docking simulations were performed for 
compound 10a within α-amylase (PDB: 2QV4) and α-glucosidase (PDB: 3W37), while 
compound 11b was analyzed within acetylcholinesterase (AChE) (PDB: 4EY7) to 
assess binding affinity and to explore the binding interactions with the active 
sites of the enzymes.

Dysregulation of dendritic spine dynamics, a process essential for synaptic 
plasticity and memory, is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Actin 
dynamics, largely regulated by the LIMK1-cofilin pathway, are central to 
maintaining structural and functional stability in neurons. In healthy brains, 
the LIMK1-cofilin-actin axis modulates actin polymerization within dendritic 
spines, supporting spine growth and plasticity. However, in AD, this pathway is 
altered, leading to both actin and synaptic dysfunction. Studies report 
conflicting findings, with some indicating LIMK1 hyperactivation leading to 
cofilin inactivation, while others observe elevated cofilin activity, suggesting 
divergent regulatory mechanisms depending on the disease stage or neuronal 
environment. The paradoxical effects of LIMK1-cofilin signaling in AD may result 
from a context-dependent regulation influenced by factors such as amyloid-beta 
(Aβ) and tau protein accumulation, which disrupt actin dynamics and promote 
synaptic degeneration. The presence of cofilin-actin rods and Hirano bodies in 
AD highlights the role of aberrant actin stabilization and its impact on 
neurodegenerative processes. This review synthesizes current findings on 
LIMK1-cofilin-actin signaling in AD, emphasizing the dual role of cofilin in 
stabilizing and severing actin filaments. Targeting the LIMK1-cofilin-actin axis 
presents a promising therapeutic approach to restore dendritic spine dynamics 
and mitigate cognitive decline. However, resolving inconsistencies in cofilin 
regulation is essential to developing effective treatments for AD.

This study explored the potential therapeutic targets and mechanisms of Danggui 
Shaoyao San(DSS) in the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease(AD) 
through transcriptomics and metabolomics, combined with animal experiments. 
Fifty male C57BL/6J mice, aged seven weeks, were randomly divided into the 
following five groups: control, model, positive drug, low-dose DSS, and 
high-dose DSS groups. After the intervention, the Morris water maze was used to 
assess learning and memory abilities of mice, and Nissl staining and 
hematoxylin-eosin(HE) staining were performed to observe pathological changes in 
the hippocampal tissue. Transcriptomics and metabolomics were employed to 
sequence brain tissue and identify differential metabolites, analyzing key genes 
and metabolites related to disease progression. Reverse 
transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction(RT-qPCR) was employed to 
validate the expression of key genes. The Morris water maze results indicated 
that DSS significantly improved learning and cognitive function in 
scopolamine(SCOP)-induced model mice, with the high-dose DSS group showing the 
best results. Pathological staining showed that DSS effectively reduced 
hippocampal neuronal damage, increased Nissl body numbers, and reduced nuclear 
pyknosis and neuronal loss. Transcriptomics identified seven key genes, 
including neurexin 1(Nrxn1) and sodium voltage-gated channel α subunit 1(Scn1a), 
and metabolomics revealed 113 differential metabolites, all of which were 
closely associated with synaptic function, oxidative stress, and metabolic 
regulation. RT-qPCR experiments confirmed that the expression of these seven key 
genes was consistent with the transcriptomics results. This study suggests that 
DSS significantly improves learning and memory in SCOP model mice and alleviates 
hippocampal neuronal pathological damage. The mechanisms likely involve the 
modulation of synaptic function, reduction of oxidative stress, and metabolic 
balance, with these seven key genes serving as important targets for DSS in the 
treatment of AD.

Insomnia increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease and is associated with 
increased amyloid-β (Aβ) levels, but assessments using rigorous objective 
measures are lacking. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to determine 
the association between sleep characteristics and Aβ burden using 
polysomnography and positron emission tomography (PET). Cognitively normal older 
adults (ages 60-85) with symptoms of insomnia underwent PET and overnight 
polysomnography. Pearson correlations determined the association between sleep 
variables and the standard uptake values ratio (SUVR) within global cerebral 
cortex, precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and the medial prefrontal 
cortex (mPFC). Multivariable stepwise regression was performed for each region 
of interest with apolipoprotein-ε (APOE) genotype and age as potential 
covariates. Sleep parameters between those who were Aβ elevated vs. non-elevated 
were compared using t-tests. Forty-three adults (69.3 ± 5.5 years old; 32.6% Aβ 
elevated; mostly non-Hispanic white and female) were included in analyses. 
Longer stage 1 was related to greater cortical and mPFC SUVR, greater wake after 
sleep onset was related to greater cortical, mPFC, and precuneus SUVR, and 
shorter stage 2 was associated with greater PCC SUVR. Compared to those who were 
Aβ non-elevated, those who were Aβ elevated had longer stage 1 and shorter stage 
2 sleep. Greater sleep fragmentation, longer stage 1 sleep, and shorter stage 2 
sleep were associated with greater Aβ burden in various regions of the brain in 
cognitively normal older adults. The results support poor sleep as an early risk 
factor for Aβ accumulation and possible target for Alzheimer's prevention. Trial 
Registration: The study was registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03954210).

The urgent need for sustainable treatments for neurodegenerative disorders has 
led to the development of novel cholinesterase inhibitors. In this work, sixteen 
lactam-1,2,3-triazole hybrids were efficiently synthesized via copper 
nanoparticle-catalyzed click chemistry under green conditions and without 
additives. Most compounds exhibited good to excellent inhibition of AChE and 
BChE in vitro, with compound 4 m emerging as the most potent (IC₅₀ = 0.7 μM for 
AChE and 0.2 μM for BChE). Molecular docking, dynamics simulations, and kinetic 
analyses revealed key binding interactions and identified 4 m as a mixed-type 
inhibitor. ADMETox predictions indicated favorable pharmacokinetic profiles, and 
all compounds were fully characterized using spectroscopic and HRMS techniques. 
This study highlights a modern, eco-friendly strategy for designing potent dual 
cholinesterase inhibitors with therapeutic potential for Alzheimer's disease.

PURPOSE: Human-centered artificial intelligence (AI) plays a crucial role in 
medical research. This paper evaluates the impact of human expertise in AI 
systems, using dementia prediction as a case study. Specifically, plasma 
phospho-tau181 (ptau181) is employed as the ground truth for Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) to advance early detection and treatment strategies.
METHODS: In this empirical study, we investigated three distinct cases to 
explore AI's role in predicting ptau181 levels through finger-tapping analysis. 
Case 1 employed explicit features from finger movements combined with a Ridge 
regression model, emphasizing the interpretability enabled by human-engineered 
features. Case 2 introduced temporal dynamics using Long Short-Term Memory 
(LSTM) networks with displacement-vs-time data, highlighting how human experts 
can integrate temporal dependencies into AI models. Case 3 utilized a 3D 
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to autonomously extract temporal and spatial 
features from processed video data, showcasing AI's ability to learn and adapt 
with minimal human intervention.
RESULTS: Evaluation demonstrated Case 3's superior performance, illustrating the 
trade-offs between model effectiveness and human involvement. Case 1 provided 
interpretability through explicit feature engineering, while Case 2 introduced 
complexity with temporal dependencies.
CONCLUSION: This study underscores the crucial role of human-centered AI in 
medical research, particularly in predictive modeling for AD. By combining human 
expertise with advanced AI capabilities, we can unlock new avenues for early 
diagnosis and intervention, thereby advancing our understanding and treatment of 
complex AD conditions to improve patient outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: To characterize the response of extracellular vesicles (EV) in the 
serum of mice and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients following focused ultrasound 
(FUS)-mediated blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening (FUS-BBBO) as a means to 
improve liquid biopsy.
METHODS: Blood was collected from C57BL/6 mice before, and one hour after 
FUS-BBBO, and from AD patients before, one hour after, and three days after 
FUS-BBBO. EVs were isolated from serum using the Exoquick precipitation solution 
and their concentration was quantified using nanoparticle tracking analysis. The 
transcriptomic and proteomic content of EVs from mice was assessed using RNA 
sequencing and mass spectrometry protein analysis respectively. Additionally, 
the release of EVs in mice was inhibited using the GW4869 drug to assess the 
role of EVs in the restoration of the BBB. Finally, the biomarker content of EVs 
in AD patients was detected using a Luminex multiplex assay.
RESULTS: We observed a 164±85% (95% confidence interval: 78.998 - 249.202) 
increase in murine EV concentration one hour after treatment, as well as an 
increase in EV RNA associated with FUS-BBBO neuroimmunotherapy. Inhibition of 
EVs reduced the inflammatory response and BBBO volume in mice. Patient EV 
concentration also increased one hour after treatment and was dependent on the 
volume of BBB opening three days post-treatment. Furthermore, EV isolation was 
found to significantly enhance (p<0.05) the detection of FUS-BBBO-induced 
amplification of AD and CNS biomarkers such as GFAP, beta-amyloid 42 and 
phosphorylated tau 181, exhibiting on average a 1.2 times higher log-fold change 
in biomarker levels in isolated EVs compared to total serum.
CONCLUSION: Overall, we hereby present the first evidence of altered murine and 
AD patient EV concentration and content in response to FUS-BBBO, providing 
evidence of EVs' role within FUS-BBBO neuroimmunotherapy as well as their 
utility in improving FUS-BBBO biomarker amplification. Our results pave the way 
for clinical applications of EV-based liquid biopsy in patients with 
neurodegenerative diseases following FUS-BBBO, as a way of noninvasively 
monitoring disease progression.

Epigenetic alterations are key contributors to Alzheimer's disease (AD), driving 
age-related cognitive decline. This study explores the combined neuroprotective 
effects of G9a histone methyltransferase inhibition (via UNC0642) and 
cannabinoid receptor activation (CB1R: ACEA; CB2R: JWH133) in AD models. We used 
HEK-293T cells and hippocampal neurons to demonstrate that G9a inhibition 
selectively enhances CB1R-mediated ERK/cAMP signaling. In SAMP8 mice (sporadic 
AD model), we evaluated the effects of pharmacological inhibition of G9a 
(UNC0642), combined with CB1R agonism (ACEA) and/or CB2R agonism (JWH133), on 
cognitive recovery, neuronal morphology, and neuroinflammation. Our results 
demonstrated that SAMP8 mice treated with UNC0642 and ACEA exhibited significant 
recovery in short-term memory, as assessed by the Novel Object Recognition Test 
(NORT), and complete recovery of spatial memory in the Object Location Test 
(OLT). These improvements were accompanied by enhanced neuronal morphology 
(increased dendritic length and density) and reduced neuroinflammation markers, 
suggesting a synergistic effect of G9a inhibition and CB1R activation. 
Importantly, JWH133 treatment, both alone and in combination with UNC0642, 
resulted in a pronounced reduction of neuroinflammatory markers (Trem2, Cd33, 
iNOS) and a significant restoration of dendritic spine density and branching 
length, with the dual treatment showing the most robust effects. JWH133 alone 
produced moderate cognitive improvement, but its combination with G9a inhibition 
led to outcomes comparable to those of control animals. Thus, the results 
underscore G9a inhibition's potential to amplify cannabinoid receptor-mediated 
neuroprotection while mitigating psychoactive risks, offering a promising 
multi-target approach for neurodegenerative diseases.

The brain and spinal cord, which constitute the central nervous system, were 
historically considered immune-privileged sites, as it was believed they lacked 
an equivalent to the systemic lymphatic system. However, in 2013, a pathway 
facilitating the clearance of waste products through the brain parenchyma via 
the perivascular space was proposed, garnering attention as the 'glymphatic 
system'. Similar to the systemic lymphatic system, the glymphatic system plays a 
critical role in immune responses and has been implicated not only in 
Alzheimer's disease and inflammatory brain disorders but also in conditions such 
as hydrocephalus and glaucoma, which are associated with cerebrospinal fluid 
circulation impairments. Recent studies have suggested that dysfunction of the 
glymphatic system may promote the progression of brain tumors and reduce the 
efficacy of immune responses and pharmacological therapies targeting tumors. 
Radiotherapy is a major treatment option for brain tumors; however, while it can 
enhance immune responses against tumors, it may also suppress these responses at 
the same time. Additionally, cranial irradiation has been suggested to impair 
the function of the glymphatic system. This review provides an overview of the 
structure and functional evaluation methods of the glymphatic system, summarizes 
the effects of its dysfunction on brain tumor treatment, and explores recent 
findings on the impact of radiation therapy on glymphatic system functioning. 
Lastly, it also explores the potential for radiation therapy strategies that 
account for their effects on the glymphatic system.

Alzheimer's disease, affecting 7.24 million globally, requires combination 
therapies, including cholinesterase inhibitors and immunotherapy, for optimal 
management, emphasizing the benefits of these treatments. The current study 
investigated the potential synergy between superparamagnetic iron oxide 
nanoparticles (SPIONs) and a soluble product of Dipylidium caninum adult worms 
to enhance biochemical and cognitive changes in a colchicine-induced rat model 
of Alzheimer's disease. The study involved 50 male albino rats randomly assigned 
into five groups: group I, the negative control; group II, the positive control; 
group III, the soluble product of D. caninum excretory-secretory product 
(ESP)-intervened group; group IV, the SPION-intervened group; and group V, the 
combination of SPIONs and the soluble product of D. caninum adult worm 
ESP-intervened group. Each group consisted of 10 rats. The study compared the 
biochemical and cognitive abilities of the three intervention groups to the 
negative control using the MANOVA test, revealing a significant fit model 
(p = 0.000) and a large effect size (partial eta squared = 0.750) for the 
biochemical improvement. The same results were found for all biochemical tests, 
including amyloid beta (AB1-42), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB), malondialdehyde 
(MDA), and superoxide dismutase (SOD). The effect sizes were large (0.551, 
0.729, 0.674, and 0.445, respectively), and the fit models were significant 
(P = 0.000). When comparing the experimental groups pairwise, it was clear that 
group V was the most effective therapy, as it had the smallest mean difference 
across all biochemical markers when compared to the negative control group. 
Regarding cognitive changes, both the multivariate test and tests of 
between-subject effects of all seven cognitive parameters were significant, with 
P values ≤ 0.05 and a large effect size due to the partial eta squared values 
above 0.1. However, for the passive avoidance (PA) effect, initial latency and 
locomotor activity have medium effect sizes with values between 0.01 and 0.1 
(0.061 and 0.018, respectively). Pairwise comparisons between intervention and 
negative control groups revealed that group IV (SPION-intervened) had the 
smallest values of cognitive parameters, making it the best intervention therapy 
for cognitive changes. The Log Rank (Mantel-Cox) Kaplan-Meier curve indicated 
that the least mean timing needed for cognitive changes to normalize was 20 days 
at a median point of 0.5, with group III (D. caninum ESP-intervened group) 
having a significantly different Log Rank (Chi-Square = 85.490, P = 0.000).

Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative condition associated with oxidative 
stress, affecting millions of people worldwide, with expected increases due to 
the aging population. The development of efficient therapies is still 
challenging. Propolis, with its antioxidant properties, shows potential in 
controlling the oxidative stress associated with the disease. The present study 
aimed to determine the chemical composition of ethanolic extract from propolis 
produced by Plebeia catamarcensis (EEP-Pc) and Tetragonisca fiebrigi (EEP-Tf), 
as well as their in vitro and in vivo antioxidant effects, lifespan influence 
and induced paralysis in Caenorhabditis elegans, mutant model for Alzheimer's 
disease. The chemical profile of EEP-Pc and EEP-Tf was characterized through 
GC-MS and HPLC, identifying phenolic compounds and terpenes. In vitro 
antioxidant activity was observed using the DPPH• free radicals scavenging 
method and protection against proteins and DNA oxidation. In vivo, P. 
catamarcensis and T. fiebrigi propolis extracts showed no reproductive or 
locomotor toxicity and promoted resistance to oxidative stress in nematodes 
exposed to the oxidative agent Juglone. Both propolis extracts increased 
longevity and reduced the signs of paralysis caused by the accumulation of 
β-amyloid peptides, a marker for Alzheimer's disease. Together, these data show 
that propolis from stingless bees P. catamarcensis and T. fiebrigi exhibits 
promising antioxidant activities against oxidative stress, indicating 
pharmacological potential with the capacity to reduce symptoms of Alzheimer's 
disease.

Frailty is an age-related syndrome commonly associated with different 
comorbidities, and its occurrence is particularly frequent in patients with 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). A persisting low-grade inflammation has been suggested 
to favor the onset of both AD and frailty. Besides their role in hemostasis and 
thrombosis, blood platelets are true inflammatory cells, and their direct 
contribution to the onset and progression of AD has been documented. In this 
work, we investigated whether platelet hyperreactivity and pro-oxidative 
functions are implicated in the development of frailty in a mouse model of AD, 
the APP23 mice. Assessment of 31 specific clinical signs of deterioration in 
mice at 3, 9, and 18 months of age demonstrated that the development of frailty 
was significantly more pronounced in the APP23 mice compared to wild-type 
littermates. In 18-month-old APP23 mice, a significant platelet hyperreactivity 
was detected as shown by a significantly stronger platelet aggregation in 
response to submaximal stimulation of both collagen and thrombin receptors. 
Moreover, the pro-inflammatory function of platelets, evaluated as circulating 
and agonist-induced platelet-neutrophil aggregate formation, was significantly 
increased in aged APP23 mice compared to wild-type littermates. Platelet 
hyperreactivity was partially prevented by prolonged treatment with the 
anti-oxidant agent Tempol, which reduced both agonist-induced aggregation and 
platelet-neutrophil aggregate formation. Importantly, prolonged treatment of 
APP23 mice with Tempol significantly reduced also the frailty index score in 
18-month-old animals. These results outline the possible beneficial effect of an 
anti-oxidant treatment in hampering platelet hyperreactivity and preventing the 
onset of frailty associated to AD.

Clinical trials of anti-amyloid-β (Aβ) monoclonal antibodies in Alzheimer 
disease (AD) infer target engagement from Aβ positron emission tomography (PET) 
and/or fluid biomarkers such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ42/40. However, 
these biomarkers measure brain Aβ deposits indirectly and/or incompletely. In 
contrast, neuropathologic assessments allow direct investigation of treatment 
effects on brain Aβ deposits-and on potentially myriad 'downstream' pathologic 
features. From a clinical trial of anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies in dominantly 
inherited AD (DIAD), in the largest study of its kind, we measured 
immunohistochemistry area fractions (AFs) for Aβ deposits (10D5), tauopathy 
(PHF1), microgliosis (IBA1), and astrocytosis (GFAP) in 10 brain regions from 10 
trial cases-gantenerumab (n = 4), solanezumab (n = 4), placebo/no treatment 
(n = 2)-and 10 DIAD observational study cases. Strikingly, in proportion to 
total drug received, Aβ deposit AFs were significantly lower in the gantenerumab 
arm versus controls in almost all areas examined, including frontal, temporal, 
parietal, and occipital cortices, anterior cingulate, hippocampus, caudate, 
putamen, thalamus, and cerebellar gray matter; only posterior cingulate and 
cerebellar white matter comparisons were non-significant. In contrast, AFs of 
tauopathy, microgliosis, and astrocytosis showed no differences across groups. 
Our results demonstrate with direct histologic evidence that gantenerumab 
treatment in DIAD can reduce parenchymal Aβ deposits throughout the brain in a 
dose-dependent manner, suggesting that more complete removal may be possible 
with earlier and more aggressive treatment regimens. Although AFs of tauopathy, 
microgliosis, and astrocytosis showed no clear response to partial Aβ removal in 
this limited autopsy cohort, future examination of these cases with more 
sensitive techniques (e.g., mass spectrometry) may reveal more subtle 
'downstream' effects.

This study investigates the phytochemical composition, antioxidant activity, and 
anti-Alzheimer effects of curcumin used in the green synthesis of silver 
nanoparticles (curcumin-Ag NPs). The synthesis process and nanoparticle 
characteristics were thoroughly examined using UV-visible spectroscopy, Fourier 
transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS), X-ray 
diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The resulting 
nanoparticles exhibited a particle size between 50 and 100 nm with a zeta 
potential of - 33 mV, indicating colloidal stability. FTIR spectra showed 
characteristic peaks at 3537, 1627, 1509, and 1278 cm-1, corresponding to 
phenolic hydroxyl groups, C = O, and CH groups, confirming the presence of 
curcumin on the nanoparticle surface. SEM imaging revealed spherical 
nanoparticles with sizes ranging from 61 to 78 nm, and EDX analysis confirmed 
the presence of silver with characteristic peaks at approximately 3 keV. XRD 
patterns demonstrated that the nanoparticles possess a crystalline structure. 
Antioxidant activity assessed via DPPH assay increased with concentration, with 
an IC50 value of 1167.9 µg/ml. Anti-Alzheimer effects were observed at lower 
concentrations, with up to 44.3% inhibition of acetylcholinesterase activity at 
585 µg/ml. Notably, the dual properties of antioxidant and enzyme inhibitory 
effects highlight the potential of curcumin-Ag NPs as multifunctional agents for 
neurodegenerative diseases. This work offers new insights into the green 
synthesis of bioactive nanoparticles and their therapeutic prospects against 
Alzheimer's disease.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article explores the intricate relationship between 
androgens, androgen receptors, and the central nervous system. We examine the 
role of physiologically derived androgens and androgenic supplements in 
neurodevelopment and neuroplasticity and delve into the involvement of androgen 
pathways in the pathogenesis of various neurological disorders.
RECENT FINDINGS: This review highlights the increasing recognition of 
testosterone and androgen signaling in various neurological conditions, with 
evidence of both protective and harmful effects depending on dosage and context. 
Although limited to experimental use, testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) may 
serve potential benefits in the management of multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, 
headache, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and 
Parkinson disease. On the other hand, androgen-blocking treatments may help 
alter disease progression in spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy. Testosterone 
supplementation can have potential adverse events when used at a 
supratherapeutic level, and prenatal testosterone exposure is believed to 
contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disease. Additionally, 
androgen-blocking agents could increase the risk of neurodegenerative 
conditions, such as Parkinson disease and Alzheimer disease. Despite the above 
findings, there is no established indication of TRT or androgen-blocking 
medication in neurological disorders. The body of evidence highlighting the 
involvement of androgens and androgen receptors (ARs) in pathogenesis of 
neurological diseases is growing. This includes ongoing research exploring the 
potential therapeutic targets involving the androgen signaling pathway for 
management of neurological disorders. Future placebo-controlled clinical trials 
are essential to determine the efficacy and safety of TRT or androgen-blocking 
therapies in managing neurological disease.

Clinical Features and Diagnosis of Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus.

Moghekar AR.

OBJECTIVE: This article serves as a practical guide for the assessment of 
patients with suspected idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH).
LATEST DEVELOPMENTS: Significant advancements in neuroimaging, biomarker 
identification, and neurosurgical techniques have considerably improved the 
diagnostic accuracy and outcomes of treatment for idiopathic NPH. The full triad 
of gait disturbance, cognitive impairment, and urinary incontinence is not 
present in all patients and is not a prerequisite to pursuing treatment. 
Comorbid cervical stenosis is common and may also require surgical intervention.
ESSENTIAL POINTS: NPH remains a challenging clinical entity with significant 
overlap in presentation with other neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer 
disease, vascular dementia, and parkinsonian syndromes, especially progressive 
supranuclear palsy and dementia with Lewy bodies. Gait tends to be affected 
first and more severely than other domains in patients with idiopathic NPH. The 
CSF tap test is a key diagnostic tool where both objective and subjective 
improvements in symptoms help identify patients likely to have a good outcome 
after shunt surgery.

BACKGROUND: Genetic variants on the X chromosome have been linked to 
susceptibility for Parkinson's disease (PD), but their roles in disease 
progression remain unclear.
OBJECTIVES: This study investigated associations between X chromosome variants 
and longitudinal cognitive decline or motor impairment in patients with PD.
METHODS: We conducted combined (male + female) and stratified X-chromosome-wide 
survival studies (XWSS) in 4467 patients with PD with 33,406 longitudinal 
visits. Cognitive decline was defined as global cognitive impairment (GCI, Mini 
Mental State Exam score ≤25), whereas motor impairment was evaluated by Hoehn 
and Yahr stage 3 (HY3). Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) and genetic 
colocalization analyses were systematically performed.
RESULTS: We identified 40 common variants in the X-chromosome-wide screen 
associated with longitudinal progression of PD with P-value <9.27 × 10-6, 
including 11 independent loci associated with cognitive decline and two with 
motor impairment. The rs142724191 and rs144112368 variants were associated with 
cognitive decline in both combined and male-only analyses. rs111708875 reached 
genome-wide significance for motor progression in female cases (hazard ratio 
[HR] = 3.98, 95% confidence interval [CI]:  2.54-6.25) with 
P-value = 1.84 × 10-9. All these variants were independent with X chromosome 
susceptibility loci associated with PD, Alzheimer's disease, or Lewy body 
dementia.
CONCLUSIONS: Our XWSS identified novel genetic progression-associated loci on 
the X chromosome for PD, providing new insights into the X chromosome-linked 
genetic underpinnings of PD. © 2025 International Parkinson and Movement

BACKGROUND: Blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction contributes to the 
pathogenesis of cerebral small vessel disease. This study assessed SEW2871, a 
selective agonist of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1, as a potential novel 
therapy for small vessel disease by targeting BBB damage using a rat model of 
small vessel disease.
METHODS: Twelve-week male and female spontaneously hypertensive rat 
stroke-prones were subjected to unilateral carotid artery occlusion (UCAO) and 
Japanese permissive diet (JPD). Three doses of SEW2871 (0.5, 1.0, and 5.0 mg/kg, 
delivered every other day up to 5 weeks) were tested. Dynamic body weight, 
oxygen saturation, and SEW2871 plasma concentration were evaluated. BBB 
permeability, white matter lesions and gray matter lesions, and cerebral blood 
flow (CBF) were assessed with preclinical magnetic resonance imaging at 2 and 5 
weeks after UCAO/JPD onset. Cognitive outcomes were evaluated using Morris Water 
Maze during week 5 of UCAO/JPD.
RESULTS: We found that SEW2871 delayed the occurrence of UCAO/JPD-induced 
chronic hypoxic hypoperfusion in the spontaneously hypertensive rat 
stroke-prones. Magnetic resonance imaging showed increased BBB permeability, 
white matter lesions and gray matter lesions, and decreased CBF at 2 and 5 weeks 
after UCAO/JPD onset. T2-weighted and fractional anisotropy magnetic resonance 
imaging showed that all doses of SEW2871 demonstrated a protective effect on 
white matter lesions and gray matter lesions with the most significant 
improvements in the 1.0 mg/kg group. Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic 
resonance imaging and arterial spin labeling maps showed significantly reduced 
BBB leakage and improved CBF in 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg groups. Immunohistochemical 
analysis for serum IgG extravasation and microglia/macrophage activation in rat 
brains verified the protective effects of SEW2871 on BBB leakage and 
neuroinflammation. Morris Water Maze test revealed a significant improvement in 
spatial memory in 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg groups compared with the vehicle animals.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term treatment with SEW2871 mitigated BBB leakage and brain 
injury, improved CBF and cognitive impairment in the spontaneously hypertensive 
rat stroke-prone model of small vessel disease. SEW2871 is effective at all 
doses, while 1.0 mg/kg dose demonstrated exceptional protection against the 
neuropathological cascades associated with small vessel disease.

Tacca chantrieri André is a native plant from Northern Thailand with reported 
pharmacological effects, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and 
neuroprotective properties. This study investigated the neuroinflammatory and 
cognitive-enhancing effects of Tacca chantrieri André rhizome extract (TCE) in a 
scopolamine-injected model, which mimics an Alzheimer's disease (AD) animal 
model. Animals were divided into six groups: (1) a control group, (2) a 
vehicle-treated group, (3) a donepezil-treated group (3 mg/kg BW) as a positive 
control, and (4-6) three TCE-treated groups receiving 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg BW 
once daily for 14 days. Starting on Day 8, animals received daily 
intraperitoneal injections of scopolamine (3 mg/kg BW) for 7 consecutive days to 
induce cognitive impairment. On day 14, behavioral tests were conducted, 
including the Y-maze and open field tests. On day 15, animals were euthanized, 
and their brains were collected for Nissl staining, immunofluorescence staining, 
and biochemical analyses using an ELISA kit. Our results demonstrated that TCE 
treatment attenuated scopolamine-induced memory deficits and neuroinflammation. 
Specifically, TCE administration reduced levels of proinflammatory cytokines, 
including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and 
decreased glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression in the hippocampus. 
Additionally, TCE improved neuronal survival and enhanced serotonin levels, 
contributing to cognitive improvements. The qualitative analysis of TCE using 
LC-QTOF-MS identified various chemical constituents, including saponins, 
flavonoids, and phenolic compounds. These bioactive compounds contributed to the 
neuroprotective effects of TCE by modulating neuroinflammation and cognitive 
function. The neuroprotective effects of TCE suggested its potential as a 
therapeutic agent for memory impairment associated with AD.

BackgroundAlzheimer's disease (AD) patients are at greater risk of focal 
seizures than similarly aged adults, which may accelerate cognitive decline. 
Older people with epilepsy generally respond well to antiseizure medications 
(ASMs). However, whether specific ASMs can differentially control seizures in AD 
is unknown. The corneal kindled model of chronic seizures allows for precisely 
timed drug administration studies to expediently evaluate efficacy and 
tolerability of investigational treatments in AD-associated mouse 
models.ObjectiveWe hypothesized that mechanistically distinct ASMs would 
differentially control seizures of aged AD mice (9-14 months), thereby informing 
rational ASM selection for AD.MethodsPSEN2-N141I and APPswe/PS1dE9 mice 
underwent corneal kindling at 9-14 months old to quantify latency to kindled 
criterion versus matched wild-type mice. Dose-related response to commonly 
prescribed ASMs for older adults with epilepsy (valproic acid, levetiracetam, 
lamotrigine, phenobarbital, and gabapentin) was then assessed.ResultsSex and AD 
genotype differentially impacted seizure susceptibility. Male PSEN2-N141I mice 
required more kindling stimulations to reach criterion (χ2 = 5.521; p < 0.05). 
Male APP/PS1 mice were no different in kindling rate versus controls, but did 
have more severe seizures. There were significant ASM class-specific differences 
in acute seizure control and dose-related tolerability. APP/PS1 mice were more 
sensitive to valproic acid, levetiracetam, and gabapentin. PSEN2-N141I mice were 
more sensitive to valproic acid and lamotrigine.ConclusionsAD genotypes may 
differentially impact ASMs activity in vivo with advanced biological age. These 
findings highlight the heterogeneity of seizure risk in AD and suggest that 
precisely selected ASMs may beneficially control seizures in AD to slow 
cognitive decline.

Neurodegenerative diseases present a considerable challenge to healthcare 
systems worldwide, prompting the exploration of innovative treatment strategies. 
Heterocyclic compounds, specifically those originating from the indole and 
imidazole structures, have garnered increasing interest due to their potential 
to protect neurons. Based on an in-depth literature survey in this review, we 
have compiled various derivatives of indole and imidazole scaffolds with 
potential in neurodegenerative disorders. This review also emphasized the 
Structure-Activity Relationship (SAR) and pharmacokinetics to reveal the active 
pharmacophores of various indole and imidazole analogs. We delve into the 
underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in neurodegeneration, 
highlighting how indole and imidazole derivatives exert neuroprotective effects 
by modulating oxidative stress, inflammation, protein misfolding, inhibiting 
cholinesterase, and neuroinflammation. Finally, we address the challenges and 
prospects in translating these findings into clinical therapies, underscoring 
the need for continued research to optimize the safety and efficacy of 
heterocyclic compounds in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.

The adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and its downstream 
effector Unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1 (ULK1) represent a key 
cellular signaling node, the alteration of which likely contribute to AD 
development. This study investigated the AMPK-ULK1 pathway activation state in 
AD and the impact of its modulation on mitochondria structure and function as 
well as on AD-related alterations. We show in human sporadic AD and 3xTgAD mice 
brains a defective activating phosphorylation of ULK1 despite the active 
phosphorylation of AMPK. In addition, we reported defective p-AMPK and p-ULK1 in 
cells expressing the amyloid precursor protein with the familial Swedish 
mutation. We then show that the antidiabetic metformin (Met) drug-mediated 
AMPK-ULK1 cascade activation alleviates structural and functional mitochondrial 
abnormalities in AD cells and mice brains. Furthermore, in the 3xTgAD brains, it 
reduces the early accumulation of APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs) as well as 
amyloid beta (Aβ) burden, microgliosis and astrogliosis occurring at a later 
disease stage. AMPK-ULK1 activation increases the localization of APP-CTFs 
within cathepsin D-positive lysosomal compartments and the recruitment of Iba1+ 
cells to Aβ plaques in vivo and enhances cathepsin D activity and phagocytic 
activity of microglia in vitro. Additionally, AMPK-ULK1 activation normalizes 
dendritic spine morphology in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures modeling AD 
and alleviates learning deficit in symptomatic 3xTgAD mice. Our study 
demonstrates potential therapeutic benefits of targeting AMPK-ULK1 cascade to 
reverse both early and late AD-related alterations, deserving further 
investigation in fundamental research and in human clinical studies.

BACKGROUND: Silica nanoparticles (SiO2 NPs) are widely used in the food and 
pharmaceutical industries and dramatically increase the health risks associated 
with gastrointestinal exposure. However, the neurotoxicological effects and 
mechanisms of exposure to SiO2 NPs and their relationship with the gut 
microbiome require further in-depth investigation. Here, we performed a 
systematic assessment of the toxicity of gavage containing 20 nm SiO2 NPs to 
C57BL/6 J mice.
RESULTS: After 14 weeks administration, we comprehensively discovered that 
gastrointestinal exposure to SiO2 NPs led to mice Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like 
neurotoxicity, including Aβ accumulation, cognitive impairment, oxidative stress 
burden, and neuroinflammation, which was microbiota-gut-brain axis-dependent and 
proven using a low-load gut-bacteria experiment and antibiotic treatment. 
Mechanistically, gastrointestinal exposure to SiO2 NPs disrupted intestinal 
homeostasis. Specifically, the total faecal short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) levels 
were reduced as analysed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and liquid chromatography 
mass-spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis. The reduced SCFA content damaged the 
integrity of gut-brain axis by increasing gut permeability, which may have 
caused metabolite redistribution, brain basement membrane dissolution, activated 
the neuroinflammation signalling pathway TLR4/NF-κB, and interfered with HDAC3 
and HDAC1/OGG1 pathways.
CONCLUSIONS: We showed for the first time that gastrointestinal exposure to SiO2 
NPs depends on the gut microbiome and causes neurological and cognitive 
impairment via gut-brain axis information transmission. These findings suggest 
that the gut microbiota, as a mediator between intestinal and brain information 
communications, contributes to gastrointestinal exposure to SiO2 NPs-induced 
neurotoxicity. The health risks of exposure to SiO2 NPs should be recognised, 
and addressing strategies should be extensively reconsidered.

BACKGROUND: Evidence indicates phenotypic and biological overlap between 
psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Further identification of 
underlying mutual and unique biological mechanisms may yield novel 
multi-disorder and disorder-specific therapeutic targets. The metabolome 
represents an important domain for target identification as metabolites play 
critical roles in modulating a diverse range of biological processes.
METHODS: We used Mendelian randomisation (MR) to test the causal effects 
of ~ 1000 plasma metabolites and ~ 300 metabolite ratios on anxiety, bipolar 
disorder, depression, schizophrenia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's 
disease, Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis. Follow-up analyses were 
conducted using statistical colocalisation, multivariable Bayesian model 
averaging MR (MR-BMA) and polygenic risk score analysis in the UK Biobank.
RESULTS: MR analyses identified 85 causal effects involving 77 unique 
metabolites passing FDR correction and robust sensitivity analyses (IVW-MR OR 
range 0.73-1.48; pFDR < 0.05). No evidence of reverse causality was identified. 
Multivariable MR-BMA analyses implicated sphingolipid metabolism in psychiatric 
disorder risk and carnitine derivatives in risk for amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis and multiple sclerosis. Although polygenic risk scores for prioritised 
metabolites showed limited prediction in the UK Biobank, those nominally 
significant were directionally consistent with MR estimates. Downstream 
colocalisation in regions containing influential variants identified greater 
than suggestive evidence (PP.H4 ≥ 0.6) for a shared causal variant for 29 
metabolite/psychiatric disorder trait-pairs on chromosome 11 at the FADS gene 
cluster. Most of these metabolites were lipids containing linoleic or 
arachidonic acid. Additional colocalisation was identified between the ratio of 
histidine-to-glutamine, glutamine, Alzheimer's disease and SPRYD4 gene 
expression on chromosome 12.
CONCLUSIONS: Although no single metabolite had a causal effect on both a 
psychiatric and a neurodegenerative disease, results suggest a broad effect of 
lipids across brain disorders, with a particular role for lipids containing 
linoleic or arachidonic acid in psychiatric disorders. The metabolites 
identified here may help inform future targeted interventions.

BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) often results in tau 
hyperphosphorylation, a key pathological feature of neurodegenerative diseases 
such as Alzheimer's disease. Hypothermia (HT) is a promising therapeutic 
intervention for TBI, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. 
This study investigates the role of RNA-binding motif protein 3 (RBM3) in 
mediating the neuroprotective effects of HT on tau phosphorylation and its 
involvement in glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3β) and AMP-activated 
protein kinase (AMPK) signaling.
METHODS: We used a TBI mouse model to assess the effects of HT on tau 
phosphorylation using Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. The 
phosphorylation status of GSK-3β (Ser9) and AMPK (Thr172) was also analyzed to 
explore key signaling pathways. RBM3 expression was modulated using RBM3 short 
hairpin RNA (knockdown) and adenovirus-RBM3 plasmid (overexpression) to 
determine its role in HT-induced changes in tau phosphorylation.
RESULTS: Hypothermia treatment significantly reduced tau hyperphosphorylation in 
TBI mice compared with controls. Western blotting revealed a significant 
increase in GSK-3β Ser9 phosphorylation (p < 0.01) and AMPK Thr172 
phosphorylation (p < 0.05) in the HT group. Manipulation of RBM3 expression 
showed that both RBM3 knockdown and overexpression affected the extent of tau 
dephosphorylation mediated by HT. Specifically, RBM3 overexpression enhanced the 
protective effects of HT, whereas knockdown diminished its efficacy.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that RBM3 is a crucial mediator of the 
neuroprotective effects of hypothermia in TBI, acting through modulation of 
GSK-3β and AMPK signaling pathways. These results provide new insights into the 
molecular mechanisms of TBI treatment and highlight RBM3 as a potential 
therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases associated with tauopathies. 
Limitations include the need for further validation in clinical models.

In the pursuit of therapeutic agents for Alzheimer's disease (AD), this study 
employed a molecular hybridization strategy to design and synthesize substituted 
cinnamoyl piperidinyl acetates. A total of 17 novel derivatives were evaluated 
for their inhibitory effects against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and 
butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), key enzymes implicated in AD pathogenesis. 
Notably, compound 5b, featuring a 2-chloro substitution, emerged as the most 
potent AChE inhibitor (IC50 = 19.74 ± 0.96 µM), while compound 5q, possessing a 
4-ethoxy-3-methoxy moiety, demonstrated superior BChE inhibition 
(IC50 = 13.49 ± 0.44 µM). Kinetic studies revealed mixed-type inhibition for 
compound 5b (Ki = 10.03 µM, Kis = 36.16 µM), and molecular docking confirmed its 
stable interactions with AChE's catalytic and peripheral anionic sites. These 
findings underscore the potential of cinnamoyl piperidinyl acetate derivatives 
as promising scaffolds for further optimization and development into effective 
AD therapeutics.

Therapeutic Targeting of the α7 Nicotinic Receptor: Challenges and Prospects for 
Cognitive Improvement in Alzheimer's and Schizophrenia.

Magnussen JH(1).

The α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7 nAChR) has emerged as a key target 
for treating cognitive dysfunction in neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) and schizophrenia. α7 nAChRs play essential roles in 
neurotransmission, neuroinflammation and synaptic plasticity, not only in 
neurons but also in glial cells, where they engage in metabotropic signalling. 
Despite promising preclinical findings, clinical trials of α7 nAChR agonists, 
partial agonists and positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) have yielded 
inconsistent results, with few achieving sustained cognitive benefits in 
patients. This review examines the functional properties of α7 nAChRs, 
ionotropic and metabotropic signalling roles, and their contribution to 
cognitive processes in AD and schizophrenia. We provide a comprehensive analysis 
of key α7-targeted compounds that advanced to clinical trials, detailing their 
outcomes and challenges. Additionally, we discuss major translational barriers, 
including receptor desensitization, pharmacokinetic limitations, 
inter-individual variability (e.g., effects of smoking on metabolism) and 
species differences in preclinical models. Finally, we explore innovative 
strategies to improve trial success, including optimized dosing regimens, 
co-administration with PAMs and neuroimaging techniques like PET to refine 
patient selection and drug evaluation. These approaches may offer a more 
effective pathway for developing α7-targeted cognitive therapies in AD and 
schizophrenia.

BACKGROUND: Polyphenols have been associated with brain health, but their impact 
on humans, especially in combinations, has been less explored.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the association between dietary 
polyphenol patterns (PPs), dementia incidence, and cognitive changes over time 
in the elderly.
METHODS: A total of 1041 individuals without dementia (mean age 73.1, standard 
deviation [SD] = 4.9) were followed longitudinally. Participants provided 
baseline dietary data via a validated food frequency questionnaire. Dementia was 
diagnosed through clinical and neuropsychological evaluations, and cognitive 
performance was assessed using a neuropsychological battery. Principal component 
analysis of 11 polyphenol classes identified 3 distinct PPs. Generalized 
Estimating Equations assessed cognitive decline rates, whereas Cox regression 
models evaluated dementia risk, adjusting for covariates such as age, sex, 
education, energy intake, physical activity, smoking, alcohol consumption, 
hypertension, diabetes mellitus, stroke history, coronary disease, and baseline 
mild cognitive impairment.
RESULTS: Over the follow-up period of 3.0 y (SD = 0.8), 62 participants 
developed dementia. The PPs explained up to 77.4% of the variance. The third 
polyphenol pattern (PP3), characterized by lignans, flavonols, and 
isoflavonoids, predominantly provided by cruciferous vegetables, pulses, and 
leafy vegetables, was associated with a slower rate of cognitive decline. A 
1-unit increase in PP3 intake was associated with 0.9% of a SD less decline per 
year in the global cognitive score (β = 0.009; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 
0.000, 0.017, P = 0.041). For incident dementia, participants in the third 
quartile of PP3 had a 71% lower risk than those in the first quartile (hazard 
ratio [HR]: 0.29; 95% CI: 0.12, 0.67, P-trend = 0.018). No significant 
associations were observed for the other PPs.
CONCLUSIONS: A PP high in lignans, flavonols, and isoflavonoids was associated 
with a reduced risk of dementia and cognitive decline in elderly Greeks. These 
findings offered encouraging evidence for combined polyphenol intake, suggesting 
further validation in different population samples.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a critical global health problem characterized by 
cognitive degeneration and memory loss. Recent advancements in MicroRNA (miRNA) 
research have revealed their crucial role in AD development, Leading the way for 
early diagnosis and targeted treatments. Nanomaterials, renowned for their 
exceptional properties, have been integrated into biosensors to create highly 
sensitive and specific diagnostic tools. Among these, electrochemical 
biosensors, known for their simplicity and affordability, are particularly 
promising for clinical applications and point-of-care diagnostics. This review 
focuses on the application of miR-based electrochemical biosensors in early AD 
detection. We explore the innovative use of nanoparticles to enhance the 
sensitivity and specificity of these biosensors.

Biperiden (BIP), a muscarinic type 1 (M1) receptor antagonist, has been proposed 
as a pharmacological model for episodic memory impairment in mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) and early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Understanding the 
effects of BIP on memory could also be relevant for the development of M1 
agonists to improve memory. In this study, we specifically examined how BIP 
affected the serial position effect (SPE) in a word learning task. Since MCI and 
AD show memory deficits for the first words of a list (primacy effect) we 
predicted a similar effect for BIP. Data from four previous studies were 
collated in which the effects of BIP or placebo treatment was tested a 
double-blind randomized design. For testing the SPE effect, we calculated the 
average of the first 3 words (primacy), the last 3 words (recency) and the 
middle 10 words. To control for the level of performance in the different 
studies, z-scores were calculated. Overall, the analyses revealed a clear SPE 
effect. BIP did not impair the primacy or recency effect but was found to impair 
the memory for the middle 10 words in the delayed recall test. These findings 
indicate that blocking the M1 receptor not does impair the primacy or the 
recency effect in the SPE. Although BIP treatment has an overall impairing 
effect on episodic memory, it does not model primacy effect deficits in MCI and 
AD. However, M1 receptors appear to modulate the memory for weakly 
encoded/stored information suggesting that M1 agonist could improve verbal 
episodic memory.

PURPOSE: Different tasks have been used to elicit connected speech samples and 
analyze speech and language production in dementia. In this study, we explored 
whether there was a differential performance for individuals with Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) and the logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia (lvPPA) on 
two elicitation tasks, picture description and story retell. Moreover, we 
investigated the relationship between connected speech measures and formal 
neuropsychological tests.
METHOD: A total of 18 individuals participated in this study: six with lvPPA, 
six with AD, and six neurotypical adults matched for gender, age, and education. 
Connected speech analysis was based on a quantitative production analysis.
RESULTS: Differences between the two tasks were found for mean logarithmic 
frequency of open-class words, number of sentences, and mean utterance length. 
Individuals with lvPPA differed from individuals with AD and neurotypical adults 
on type-token ratio square root, mean utterance length, and sentence elaboration 
index. Significant intercorrelations between connected speech measures in the 
two tasks were found for speech rate and total dysfluencies. Finally, 
significant associations were detected between connected speech measures and 
formal neuropsychological tests.
CONCLUSIONS: Connected speech analysis can assist in diagnosing lvPPA and 
distinguishing it from AD. While dysfluencies and speech rate remain consistent 
across connected speech tasks, other variables vary. Story retell demands 
greater executive resources and encourages richer vocabulary and morphosyntactic 
production, more accurately reflecting real-life communication compared to 
traditional picture description tasks. The study highlights the value of using 
connected speech assessment in clinical evaluations and carefully selecting 
appropriate tasks.

IMPORTANCE: Previous studies have described a potential association between 
epilepsy and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), but no systematic data are 
available.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether epilepsy is more prevalent in patients with FTD 
than in healthy controls (HCs) or patients with Alzheimer disease (AD).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this case-control study, we compared the 
prevalence of epilepsy and purchases of antiseizure medicines (ASMs) among 
patients with FTD, matched HCs, and patients with AD from 2 early-onset dementia 
diagnostics centers in the same geographic regions of Finland. AD or FTD 
diagnoses were made between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2021. Data were 
analyzed from January 26, 2024, to January 16, 2025.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was to describe the prevalence 
of epilepsy in patients with FTD, covering the time period from 10 years before 
to 5 years after the FTD diagnosis. We used International Statistical 
Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes to identify all patients with 
epilepsy and tracked purchases of ASMs.
RESULTS: The study cohort included 245 patients with FTD (121 female [49.4%], 
124 male [50.6%]; mean [SD] age, 65.2 [8.7] years), 2416 matched HCs (1190 
female [49.3%], 1226 male [50.7%]; mean [SD] age, 65.0 [8.5] years), and 1326 
patients with AD (777 female [58.6%], 549 male [41.4%]; mean [SD] age, 71.7 
[9.8] years). The prevalence of epilepsy was higher in the FTD group compared 
with the HC group (3.3% vs 0.8%, respectively; P = .002) and AD group (3.3% vs 
1.4%, respectively; P = .01) 10 years before FTD diagnosis. At the year of the 
diagnosis, the prevalence was 6.5% in patients with FTD, 1.8% in HCs (FTD vs HC 
difference, 4.7 percentage points [ppt] [95% CI, 2.2-8.6 ppt]; P < .001), and 
5.0% in patients with AD (FTD vs AD difference, 1.6 ppt [95% CI, -1.2 to 5.5 
ppt]; P = .32); at 5 years after the diagnosis, the prevalence was 11.2% in 
patients with FTD, 2.2% in HCs (FTD vs HC difference, 9.0 ppt [95% CI, 5.0-14.6 
ppt]; P < .001), and 6.9% in patients with AD (FTD vs AD difference, 4.2 ppt 
[95% CI, 0-10.0 ppt]; P = .05). ASM purchases were made significantly more often 
among patients with FTD (10.2%) compared with HCs (1.8%) and patients with AD 
(4.2%) (FTD vs HC difference, 8.4 ppt [95% CI, 5.2-12.9 ppt]; P < .001; FTD vs 
AD difference, 6.1 ppt [95% CI, 2.6-10.6 ppt]; P < .001) at all time points and 
increased during the study period.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This case-control study found a higher prevalence of 
epilepsy and increased ASM use among patients with FTD compared with HCs and 
patients with AD , suggesting an association between epileptic abnormalities and 
the pathophysiology of FTD. Further studies are warranted to investigate a 
potential overlap in the pathophysiologic mechanisms of epilepsy and FTD.

This study aims to examine the effects of tectoridin in both in vitro and in 
vivo models of Alzheimer's disease. In vitro, oxidative stress was induced in 
PC12 cells using 400 µM of hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) to simulate cellular damage. 
In vivo, a rat model of Alzheimer's disease was established through repeated 
intracerebroventricular administration of soluble amyloid-beta (Aβ1-42) to 
induce neurodegeneration. The effects of tectoridin on oxidative stress markers 
and protein expression levels were assessed. Tectoridin treatment significantly 
improved cell survival and enhanced antioxidant defense by increasing the 
activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), as well as 
glutathione (GSH) levels in H₂O₂-exposed PC12 cells. Polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR) and western blot analyses revealed that tectoridin upregulated the 
expression of Bcl-2 while downregulating the expression of Bax, caspase-3, and 
caspase-9, suggesting a reduction in apoptotic signaling. In the in vivo rat 
model, tectoridin mitigated Aβ1-42-induced neurodegeneration, leading to 
improvements in spatial learning and memory performance and reduced 
neurofibrillary tangles. Tectoridin treatment also improved oxidative stress 
parameters by increasing SOD and GSH levels while reducing malondialdehyde (MDA) 
content. Western blot analysis further demonstrated that tectoridin 
downregulated the expression of amyloid-beta (Aβ1-40), amyloid precursor protein 
(APP), tau, Bax, caspase-3, and caspase-9, while upregulating Bcl-2. These 
results suggest that tectoridin exerts neuroprotective effects by modulating 
oxidative-antioxidant balance and inhibiting apoptotic pathways, indicating its 
potential as a therapeutic agent for Alzheimer's disease.

Immunotherapies targeting extracellular tau share the premise that interrupting 
cell-to-cell spread of tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) will slow 
dementia pathogenesis. Whether these interventions affect the actions of 
synaptotoxic, extracellular tau species that may contribute to cognitive 
impairment is relatively unknown. Here, we assayed synaptic plasticity 
disruption in anaesthetised live rats caused by intracerebral injection of 
synaptotoxic tau present either in (a) secretomes of induced pluripotent stem 
cell-derived neurons (iNs) from people with Trisomy 21, the most common genetic 
cause of AD, or (b) aqueous extracts of human AD brain. Extracellular tau in iN 
secretomes was found to include fragments that contain the extended 
microtubule-binding regions of tau, MTBR/R' and adjacent C-terminal sequences. 
Immunodepletion or co-injection with antibodies targeting epitopes within these 
fragments prevented the acute disruption of synaptic plasticity by these 
patient-derived synaptotoxic tau preparations. Moreover, a recombinant human tau 
fragment encompassing the core MTBR/R'-region present in tau fibrils, 
tau297-391, potently mimicked the deleterious action of patient-derived tau. 
MTBR/R'-directed antibodies also rapidly reversed a very persistent synaptotoxic 
effect of soluble brain tau. Our findings reveal a hitherto relatively 
unexplored potential benefit of targeting extracellular MTBR/R' tau on 
correcting synaptic dysfunction.

Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia affecting more than 6 
million people in the United States. Currently, 3 monospecific antibodies 
targeting different Amyloid β (Aβ) species have been approved by the US FDA as 
disease modifying therapeutics for treatment in early AD patients with amyloid 
pathology. ABBV-916 is a clinical stage human IgG1 monoclonal antibody which 
binds to N-terminal truncated, pyroglutamate-modified at amino acid position 3, 
Aβ (AβpE3). The current study characterized ABBV-916 using human tissue samples 
and amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice. ABBV-916 selectively bound 
to recombinant AβpE3-42 fibrils and native amyloid plaques in unfixed AD brain 
tissue but did not bind targets in human CSF. ABBV-916 significantly reduced 
dense plaques from brain tissue that were co-cultured with hiPSC-derived 
phagocytes. In APPPS1-21 mice, ABBV‑916 bound plaques in a dose-dependent manner 
after a single intravenous injection. In addition, three months of weekly 
administration of ABBV-916 murine surrogate antibody significantly decreased 
amyloid plaques in APPPS1-21 mice. In vivo two-photon imaging revealed that the 
murine version of ABBV-916 inhibited the growth of the plaques in APPPS1-21 
mice. ABBV-916 murine surrogate antibody recruited microglia to plaques within 
24-48 hours after a single intraperitoneal injection in 
Cx3cr1-tdTomato/APPPS1-21 mice. Importantly, in contrast to a positive control 
antibody, ABBV‑916 murine precursor antibody did not cause microhemorrhage in 
aged APPPS1-21 mice. Taken together, our results suggest that ABBV-916 is a 
promising drug candidate. Clinical testing is on-going to evaluate the plaque 
removal and safety profiles of ABBV-916 in AD patients.

Opioid abuse is a severe global health challenge, leading to rising morbidity, 
mortality, and increasing societal costs. The aim of this study was to 
investigate neuroinflammation, neuronal damage and potential changes in the 
orexin system or beta-amyloid metabolism in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 
individuals undergoing opioid substitution therapy (OST). This cross-sectional 
study investigates CSF biomarkers in individuals undergoing OST, compared to 
control subjects. Participants receiving OST were recruited from the outpatient 
clinic at the Department of Psychiatry, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, 
Gothenburg (Sweden). Each participant provided a complete medical history, 
including details of drug use over the past 6 months, followed by a lumbar 
puncture to obtain CSF samples. Molecules associated with neuroinflammation, 
neuronal and glial damage, beta-amyloid metabolism and orexinergic function were 
analysed in the participants' CSF, alongside electrolyte levels. Specifically, 
we analysed levels of sTREM-2, YKL-40, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-α, AXL, 
MER, TYRO3, GAS6, NfL, GFAP, total tau (T-tau), phosphorylated tau (P-tau), 
neurogranin, Aβ40, Aβ42, the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio, orexin-A, sPDGFR-β and 
electrolytes. The study included 15 control subjects and 17 in the opioid 
substitution group. Patients undergoing opioid substitution therapy exhibited 
elevated levels of sTREM-2, Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio and NfL in their CSF. Conversely, 
concentrations of Na+ and Cl- were lower compared to controls. No significant 
differences were found between groups for other biomarkers, including orexin-A. 
However, when normalized to Aβ40 levels, YKL-40, IL-8, TYRO3 and P-Tau were also 
elevated in individuals with opioid dependence. Elevated biomarkers of 
neuroimmune activation, neuronal damage and beta-amyloid metabolism in opioid 
dependence suggest CNS inflammation as a contributor to its pathophysiology. 
Reduced electrolyte levels imply disrupted CSF water regulation, possibly linked 
to impaired glial function. These findings highlight both neural and non-neural 
mechanisms in opioid dependence.

Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) is a promising drug target for alleviating the 
symptoms of canine cognitive dysfunction (CCD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). We 
have recently developed lead compound 2, a racemic, nanomolar BChE inhibitor 
with procognitive effects in mice with scopolamine-induced AD-like symptoms and 
dogs suffering from CCD. To overcome its modest brain exposure, we developed 
compound (R)-(-)-3, a more potent BChE inhibitor with a 7-fold higher in vivo 
brain exposure. It has procognitive effects in mice with scopolamine-induced 
AD-like symptoms and, superior to compound 2, also in mice with Aβ1-42-induced 
AD-like symptoms. Compound (R)-(-)-3 produces no cholinergic adverse effects or 
motor deficits and has no acute toxic effects in mice. This makes sulfonamide 
(R)-(-)-3 an optimized lead compound for alleviating the symptoms of AD.

Anti-neurodegenerative treatment in Alzheimer's disease: Multifaceted mechanisms 
of action of berberine.

Song D, Zhang C.

BACKGROUND: Berberine, a traditional Chinese medicine, has demonstrated 
significant therapeutic influences in treating diabetes, obesity, and diarrhea, 
among other conditions. It has exhibited potential therapeutic benefits for 
various neurodegenerative diseases, namely, Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
Huntington's disease (HD), and Parkinson's disease (PD).
AIMS: This study aims to elucidate the mechanism behind berberine 
pharmacological action in treating AD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We search the articles published in PubMed and CNKI and 
summarize the mechanism of berberine in AD.
RESULTS: In recent years, as research into the pharmacology of berberine has 
deepened, researchers have discovered its strong neuroprotective properties. The 
ability of berberine to enhance cognitive function is thought to result from 
inhibiting the spread of AD-related proteins, reducing oxidative stress and 
inflammation, increasing choline levels, and regulating autophagy.
CONCLUSION: This review explores the latest research on berberine in AD, 
suggesting that berberine and its analogs may offer a promising new approach to 
treating the condition.
