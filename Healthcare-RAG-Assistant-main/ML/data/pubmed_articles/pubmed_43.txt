The severe neurodegenerative disease known as Alzheimer's disease (AD) is 
typified by a progressive loss of memory and cognitive function. The prevalence 
of AD is rising due to an aging global population, calling for novel treatment 
strategies. A potential treatment option for AD that shows promise is the use of 
functionalized nanoparticles (NPs). Recent developments in the synthesis, 
design, and use of functionalized NPs in AD therapy are examined in this review. 
An outline of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying AD is given in the 
first section, focusing on the roles played by tau protein aggregates and 
amyloid-beta plaques in the development of the illness. We then explore the many 
approaches used to functionalize NPs, such as surface alterations and 
bioconjugation methods, which enable accurate drug administration, targeted 
delivery, and enhanced biocompatibility. The review also emphasizes the 
therapeutic potential of functionalized NPs, highlighting their capacity to 
improve neuroprotection, lower amyloid-beta aggregation, and improve blood-brain 
barrier penetration. The potential of NPs as a tool for disease modification and 
symptom relief is highlighted by recent pre-clinical and clinical research. 
Concerns about toxicity and safety are also covered, underscoring the 
significance of thorough testing and the field's future directions. 
Functionalized NPs have great promise as a multimodal strategy to treat AD, 
offering patients hope for better quality of life, early diagnosis, and 
efficient disease treatment. This study highlights the growing role of 
nanotechnology in the search for novel and potent therapies for AD.

Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) is a naturally occurring redox-active compound 
with potent antioxidant, mitochondrial-enhancing, and neuroprotective 
properties. Originally identified as a cofactor in bacterial enzymes, PQQ has 
garnered significant interest for its potential therapeutic role in 
neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's 
disease (PD). It has reported that PQQ exerts its effects through several key 
molecular mechanisms, including the activation of antioxidant pathways via 
Nrf2/ARE signaling, enhancement of mitochondrial biogenesis and function through 
AMPK/PGC-1α, and the regulation of inflammatory processes through NF-κB 
inhibition. By improving cellular energy metabolism, reducing oxidative stress, 
and promoting neuronal survival, PQQ offers a multifaceted approach to 
counteracting the pathophysiological factors underlying neurodegeneration. Our 
review focusing on current study of PQQ on its enhancing neuroplasticity, and 
protecting neurons from damage induced by oxidative stress, mitochondrial 
dysfunction, and inflammation. Further we reviewed the significant signaling 
pathways that involved PQQ neuroprotective mechanisms, positioning it as a novel 
candidate for future therapeutic strategies targeting these debilitating 
conditions.

Impaired adult hippocampal neurogenesis is a key pathological mechanism 
contributing to memory deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies have 
shown that elevating magnesium levels promotes neurogenesis by enhancing the 
neuronal differentiation of adult neural progenitor cells in vitro. Therefore, 
this in vivo study aims to determine if magnesium-L-threonate (MgT) can 
ameliorate cognitive deficit of AD mice by attenuating adult hippocampal 
neurogenesis impairment and to reveal the underlying mechanisms. APPswe/PS1dE9 
mice were treated with different doses of MgT and ERK inhibitor PD0325901. The 
memory ability of each mouse was recorded by Morris Water Maze test. After 
cognitive test, hippocampus tissues were collected to measure the proportion of 
BrdU/doublecortin double-labeled cells using the flow cytometry test and assess 
the expression of doublecortin using PCR and Western blot. Furthermore, the 
activations of CREB, ERK, P38 and JNK were measured by Western blot to identify 
the involved mechanisms. The cognitive test confirmed that MgT treatment 
attenuated the memory impairment of APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. Flow cytometry test 
showed that Brdu/doublecortin labeled newborn neurons gradually increased 
following MgT administration. In line with the flow cytometry results, Western 
blot and PCR confirmed that MgT administration significantly increased 
doublecortin expression levels. Furthermore, the ratios of p-ERK/ERK and 
p-CREB/CREB increased with MgT elevation. In addition, these effects of MgT 
treatment were markedly reversed by PD0325901 supplementation. In conclusion, 
MgT treatment improved cognitive decline by ameliorating adult hippocampal 
neurogenesis impairment in this AD model, possibly via ERK/CREB activation.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Liver X receptors (LXRs) are promising therapeutic 
targets for alleviating Alzheimer's disease (AD) symptoms. We assessed the 
impact of the semi-synthetic LXR agonist 22-ketositosterol on disease 
progression in an AD mouse model.
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: From 5.5 months of age, APPswePS1ΔE9 (AD) mice and 
wild-type (WT) littermates received a regular or 22-ketositosterol-supplemented 
diet (0.017% w/w). Cognition was assessed with object location and recognition 
tasks and a spontaneous alternation Y-maze test. Amyloid β was quantified using 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), 
microglia (Iba1, CD68) and astrocyte (GFAP) markers using IHC. Sterols were 
determined in food, serum, liver and cerebellum.
KEY RESULTS: 22-Ketositosterol activated both liver X receptors-α and -β and 
promoted cholesterol efflux in cell cultures. Diet supplementation with 
22-ketositosterol prevented a decline in the performance of APPswePS1ΔE9 mice in 
the object location task but not in the other two tasks. Without affecting 
amyloid β deposition, 22-ketositosterol decreased microglia (Iba1, CD68) and 
astrocyte (GFAP) markers in the cortex and hippocampus of APPswePS1ΔE9, 
suggesting potential anti-inflammatory effects. No lipid accumulation was 
detected in the liver or serum upon 22-ketositosterol supplementation.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Diet supplementation with 22-ketositosterol 
prevented the decline in spatial memory of APPswePS1ΔE9 mice. Our data suggest 
therapeutic benefits of 22-ketositosterol possibly by enhancing cholesterol 
efflux and mitigating inflammatory responses, without inducing hepatosteatosis 
or hypertriglyceridemia.

The advent of disease-modifying therapies for neurodegenerative diseases may 
result in a growing demand for nuclear neuroimaging procedures presenting 
opportunities but also challenges to the nuclear medicine community. Whether 
capacity and expertise in Germany are sufficient to meet an increasing demand 
for nuclear neuroimaging is under discussion. Against this background, the 
Neuroimaging Working Group of the German Society of Nuclear Medicine initiated 
the first survey on the status of nuclear neuroimaging in Germany in 2023. 82 
institutions participated in the survey: 33 practices, 15 community hospitals, 
34 university hospitals. Primary findings were the following. In practices, 
brain scans are less frequently performed than in hospitals and are often 
limited to dopamine transporter SPECT. Brain PET is mainly performed in 
hospitals, and in community hospitals it is often restricted to FDG PET. 
Nevertheless, availability of amyloid PET with well-certified quality can be 
taken for granted. Thus, access to amyloid PET will not be a major bottleneck 
for new treatments of Alzheimer's disease. Adequate reimbursement and clear 
anchoring in clinical guidelines have the greatest potential to advance nuclear 
neuroimaging in Germany. Clinical dopamine transporter SPECT is largely in 
agreement with procedure guidelines. An area for improvement is the limited 
availability of MR images to avoid misinterpretation of structural/vascular 
lesions as nigrostriatal degeneration. The survey provides the first systematic 
assessment of the status of nuclear neuroimaging in Germany. It underscores the 
capacity of the German nuclear medicine community to meet an increasing demand 
for neuroimaging procedures, its adherence to procedure guidelines and 
identifies topics for improvement.

Widespread delivery of therapeutic proteins to the brain remains challenging. To 
determine whether human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-microglia (iMG) 
could enable brain-wide and pathology-responsive delivery of therapeutic cargo, 
we utilized CRISPR gene editing to engineer iMG to express the Aβ-degrading 
enzyme neprilysin under control of the plaque-responsive promoter, CD9. To 
further determine whether increased engraftment enhances efficacy, we utilized a 
CSF1R-inhibitor resistance approach. Interestingly, both localized and 
brain-wide engraftment in Alzheimer's disease (AD) mice reduced multiple 
biochemical measures of pathology. However, within the plaque-dense subiculum, 
reductions in plaque load, dystrophic neurites, and astrogliosis and 
preservation of neuronal density were only achieved following widespread 
microglial engraftment. Lastly, we examined chimeric models of breast cancer 
brain metastases and demyelination, demonstrating that iMG adopt diverse 
transcriptional responses to differing neuropathologies, which could be 
harnessed to enable widespread and pathology-responsive delivery of therapeutics 
to the CNS.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between duration of benzodiazepine 
exposure and the risk of dementia.
DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study using administrative health data followed 3 
age-based strata (ages 55, 65 and 75) for up to a maximum of 22 years to examine 
risk of dementia due to benzodiazepine use. Each stratum was analyzed as a 
whole, then restricted to persons with depression or anxiety, and finally using 
high dimension propensity scores (HDPS) matched cohort.
SETTING: We used administrative data on subjects receiving standard medical care 
in Manitoba, Canada.
MEASUREMENTS: Prescription data was used to quantify benzodiazepine using 
cumulative defined-daily-dose (DDD). Comorbidities and cases of dementia were 
determined using medical and hospital data.
RESULTS: Dementia risk in high-dose users of the youngest strata was elevated 
compared to non-users (adjusted HR (aHR) 1.33; 95 % CI 1.05-1.68)). Little to no 
difference was found in the middle (aHR 1.17; 1.02-1.33) and oldest strata (aHR 
1.02; 0.93-1.11). Restriction to persons with depression or anxiety eliminated 
the association. No association was found using HDPS-matched comparison groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Only a modest increase in dementia risk was seen in the high-dose 
benzodiazepine users. This association appears to be driven by the confounding 
due to higher rates of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, depression, and anxiety 
among users. Using restriction or HDPS to better control for confounding effects 
eliminates the association. While benzodiazepines do not appear to be a 
significant risk factor for dementia, tolerance, dependency and adverse effects 
caution against their long-term use.

Vigna radiate also known as mung beans, contains various bioactive compounds 
like polyphenols, flavonoids, and saponins. V. radiata therapeutic potential is 
enhanced by preparation of its extract in Pumpkin oil and soya bean oil by 
enrichment of bioactive compounds holding antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and 
neuro-protective properties. The research study was aimed was to explore the 
healing endeavors of V. radiate pumpkin and soya bean oil extract in 
rectification of neuro-motor dysfunction and mental health decline in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) rat model. After preliminary physico-phytochemical 
characterization and GC-MS analysis, AD model was established by administration 
of oral D-galactose and aluminum chloride 150 mg/kg each for 42 days daily. V. 
radiate extract in pumpkin and soya bean oil at doses 250 and 500 mg/kg was 
administered and rivastigmine (3 milligrams per kilogram) to treatment animals. 
To determine the cognitive decline and neuro-coordination dysfunctions 
behavioral tests were performed along with biochemical, neurochemical and 
histopathological analysis. ELISA and real time polymerase chain reaction were 
carried out to estimate the expression of tumor necrosis factor-α, 
Interleukine-6 and mRNA expression of neurodegenerative biomarkers. Gas 
chromatography Mass Spectrometry findings revealed the existence of favorable 
amount of neuro-defensive bioactive compounds in both oil extracts.V. radiate 
pumpkin and soya bean oil extract dose proportionally alleviated the behavioral 
dysfunctions, modulated the first line antioxidant enzymes and neurotransmitters 
s' level with anticholinesterase pursuits. The mRNA expression of AChE, IL-1β, 
TNF-α, IL-1α and β secretase were downregulated by these extracts treatment. V. 
radiate oil extracts also modulated the neuro-inflammatory protein expression 
and histopathological hallmarks in AD model animals. Therefore, it is purposed 
that V. radiate enriched extract in pumpkin and soya bean oil could be used to 
treat AD like memory dysfunction and motor symptoms.

Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease 
(PD), Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Multiple sclerosis (MS), and 
Huntington's disease (HD) represent a growing global health challenge, 
especially with aging populations. Characterized by progressive neuronal loss, 
these diseases lead to cognitive, motor, and behavioral impairments, 
significantly impacting patients' quality of life. Current therapies largely 
address symptoms without halting disease progression, underscoring the need for 
innovative, disease-modifying treatments. Ginseng, a traditional herbal medicine 
with well-known adaptogenic and neuroprotective properties, has gained attention 
as a potential therapeutic agent for neurodegeneration. Rich in bioactive 
compounds called ginsenosides, ginseng exhibits antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, 
and anti-apoptotic effects, making it a promising candidate for addressing the 
complex pathology of neurodegenerative diseases. Recent studies demonstrate that 
ginsenosides modulate disease-related processes such as oxidative stress, 
protein aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammation. In AD models, 
ginsenosides have been shown to reduce amyloid-beta accumulation and tau 
hyperphosphorylation, while in PD, they help protect dopaminergic neurons and 
mitigate motor symptoms. Ginseng's effects in ALS, MS, and HD models include 
improving motor function, extending neuronal survival, and reducing cellular 
toxicity. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the neuroprotective 
mechanisms of ginseng, emphasizing its therapeutic potential across various 
neurodegenerative diseases and discussing future research directions for its 
integration into clinical practice.

BackgroundHealthy dietary patterns have been linked to reduced risks for 
cardiovascular diseases and dementia, making nutrition an essential part of a 
comprehensive approach for dementia prevention. Knowledge about factors 
associated with a healthy diet in people with increased dementia risk is 
scarce.ObjectiveTo analyze dietary habits and associated factors in older adults 
with increased dementia risk in Germany.MethodsWe used baseline-data of the 
AgeWell.de-trial (n = 1001, %female = 52.2, Mage = 69.0, SD = 4.9). Nutrition 
was assessed using a composite score, comprising 11 components covered by 
national recommendations for a healthy diet (range = 0-11 points). Linear 
regressions assessed associations of sociodemographic, social, health-related 
and psychological factors with consumption of a healthy diet. Further, we 
assessed stages of change based on the transtheoretical model of behavior 
change.ResultsConsumption of a healthy diet was moderate (Median = 4, IQR = 2). 
Female sex (b = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.41, 0.88), higher levels of motivation for 
healthy eating (b = 0.22, 95% CI: 0.10, 0.34) and higher self-efficacy 
(b = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.20, 0.46) were linked to a healthy diet. Regarding the 
stages of behavior change, the majority were in the maintenance stage (45.2%), 
followed by the contemplation (21.5%) and precontemplation (21.2%) 
stages.ConclusionsResults suggest room for improvement regarding a healthy diet 
in our sample. Lifestyle-based interventions in older adults should be tailored 
towards current levels of motivation and self-efficacy of participants. 
Including modules targeting motivation and self-efficacy might help maximize 
intervention effectiveness.

BackgroundAlzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing neurodegenerative disorder 
causing cognitive decline, memory loss, and functional impairment. Lecanemab has 
shown safety and efficacy in clinical trials.ObjectiveThis review aims to 
understand the clinical evidence of lecanemab's effectiveness and safety in 
managing early AD.MethodsA systematic search was conducted using the Scopus 
database and ClinicalTrials.gov. Studies from 2014 to 2024 on lecanemab's 
safety, efficacy, and clinical outcomes for AD were included. Data extraction 
involved two independent reviewers, with synthesis using qualitative 
methodology.ResultsFindings from 13 studies and 13 ongoing clinical trials were 
reported, showing that lecanemab substantially reduces amyloid plaque load in 
the brains of AD patients. The therapeutic regimens vary across reported studies 
and trials, ranging from 2.5 mg/kg biweekly, 5 mg/kg monthly, 5 mg/kg biweekly, 
10 mg/kg monthly, and 10 mg/kg intravenously biweekly. The Clarity AD phase 3 
trial, the AHEAD study, and the DIAN-TU-001 trials have reported positive study 
outcomes with robust efficacy and safety outcomes with minimal side effects. 
Completed and ongoing trials report on the onset of amyloid-related imaging 
abnormalities (ARIA) and the continuation of care status following the onset of 
ARIA in these patients. The common infusion-related reactions were observed in 
26.4% of the lecanemab group compared to 7% in the placebo group.ConclusionsThe 
management of AD has evolved over the years with the introduction of novel 
therapeutic agents like lecanemab. While its safety profile is generally 
favorable, careful monitoring is essential.

BackgroundCurrent functional rating scales are not sensitive to the earliest 
functional changes in Huntington's disease (HD).ObjectiveThe Functional Rating 
Scale 2.0 (FuRST 2.0) is a patient-reported outcome (PRO) measure designed to be 
sensitive to the initial functional changes in HD, specifically stage 2 and mild 
stage 3, as defined by the Huntington's Disease Integrated Staging System 
(HD-ISS).MethodsWe followed standard assessment development methodology to 
create a PRO. Study 1 consisted of a Delphi panel which analyzed data from focus 
groups comprised of people with HD and companions from 6 countries. This was 
followed by four rounds of cognitive interviews through which we evaluated 
respondents' comprehension of the instructions, understanding of question and 
response options, and comfort with the material. Informal advice from a 
regulatory agency was garnered throughout the process.ResultsConcerns from the 
target population and regulators regarding instructions, questions, response 
options, and comfort with the material were addressed through modifications to 
the scale's wording and format.ConclusionsWe developed the FuRST 2.0 official 
working document (OWD), the penultimate version of the scale, using focus 
groups, a Delphi panel, iterative rounds of cognitive interviewing, and informal 
regulatory advice. Its psychometric properties are being evaluated in the 
FOCUS-HD validation studies from which the final version of the scale will be 
derived. The FuRST 2.0 OWD is available for use.

Introduction: Dementia leads to progressive cognitive decline, impairing 
self-care and decision making. Advance directives (AdvDirs) enable individuals 
to document healthcare preferences while cognitively capable, ensuring 
value-aligned care and reducing caregiver burden. This study explores factors 
influencing preferences for unlimited medical treatment in hypothetical 
Alzheimer's disease/dementia scenarios among community-dwelling adults. Methods: 
This cross-sectional study surveyed 163 community-dwelling adults (18+), using 
structured questionnaires to collect sociodemographic, health, and 
AdvDir-related data. Key predictors included attitudes toward life-sustaining 
treatments, comfort discussing death, religious practices, and interest in 
quality-of-life information related to end-of-life care. The primary outcome was 
preference for unlimited medical treatment in hypothetical dementia scenarios. 
Bivariate and multivariate logistic analyses assessed associations, adjusting 
for covariates. Results: In the dementia scenario, 26.9% of participants 
preferred unlimited medical treatment. This preference was strongly associated 
with a pre-existing attitude favoring life-sustaining treatments (OR = 4.24, 95% 
CI: 1.73 - 10.37, P = 0.002) and religious beliefs (OR = 5.68, 95% CI: 
1.51-21.43, P = 0.01). Conversely, an interest in learning about quality of life 
at the end of life was negatively associated with preferring unlimited treatment 
(OR = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.09-0.89, P = 0.03). Discussion: Our findings highlight the 
need to align advance care planning with individuals' values, beliefs, and 
religious practices. Raising awareness of quality-of-life considerations in 
end-of-life care may lead to a shift in preference toward palliative care rather 
than aggressive treatment. Healthcare providers should discuss treatment 
trade-offs with cultural and religious sensitivity to support informed decision 
making.

BACKGROUND: Prolonged or repeated psychological stress triggers dental and 
orthodontic diseases via inflammatory pathways and oxidative stress. This review 
aims to elucidate the role of inflammation, gut microbiota, stress, and 
cognition, exploring their impact on the development of therapeutics to enhance 
oral health.
OBJECTIVE: The primary aim pertinent to this systematic review is to elucidate 
the significant implications of cognition and stress in dental and orthodontic 
health. Specifically, the review aims to (1) investigate the association between 
emotional stress and the incidence or progression of periodontal disease; (2) 
explore the impact of physiological and emotional stress on cellular and 
molecular inflammatory responses in orthodontics; (3) examine the influence of 
gut-mediated psychophysiological factors on emotional changes in mental health 
and cognition with a focus on periodontics and orthodontics; and (4) investigate 
the potential of gut microbiota alterations to influence oral and 
cognitive/mental health, including the impact of probiotic supplementation and 
dietary interventions.
METHODS: A systematic review was conducted without comprehensive meta-analysis, 
focusing on literature from 1960 to 2024. Databases searched included PubMed, 
Embase, ReleMed, National Library of Medicine (NLM), Scopus, and Google Scholar. 
Keywords used were "cognition," "emotional stress," "gut microbiota," 
"orthodontics," "prosthetics," "pathophysiology," and "mental health." Studies 
were selected based on relevance, publication date, access to full texts, and 
adherence to PRISMA guidelines. The review integrated findings on the impact of 
emotional stress on periodontal disease and orthodontic health through 
pathophysiological implications.
RESULTS: Age-related neurodegeneration causes Alzheimer's disease and severe 
dementia that subsequently promotes poor oral health. The review identified a 
complex interplay between emotional stress and periodontal disease. While a 
direct association remains to be conclusively proven, several studies highlight 
the influence of stress on the severity and incidence of periodontal disease 
through inflammatory and immunological pathways. Stress manifests in various 
ways, such as increased masticatory muscle tone, changes in eating behavior, and 
the initiation of bruxism, all of which can affect dental health. Physiological 
stress induces an inflammatory response to orthodontic tooth movement, impacting 
orthodontic treatment outcomes. Furthermore, the review elucidates the role of 
gut-mediated psychophysiological factors in emotional changes, influencing 
periodontal and orthodontic health. Emerging evidence suggests that gut 
microbiota alterations can significantly impact oral and cognitive health 
through systemic inflammation and neuroimmune mechanisms.
CONCLUSION: This review highlights the significant impact of physiological and 
emotional stress on periodontal and orthodontic health. Detailed exploration of 
cellular and molecular inflammatory responses provides insights into the 
pathophysiology of orthodontic diseases and their impact on oral health. 
Gut-brain-oral axis has significance in oral health, exploring how alterations 
in gut microbiota influence oral and cognitive health. It is essential to 
investigate the impact of probiotic supplementation and dietary modifications on 
gut microbiota composition, systemic inflammation, and their influence on both 
cognitive and oral health. Clinical trials assessing the effectiveness of 
anti-inflammatory treatments in reducing periodontal disease and cognitive 
decline could offer valuable insights. Integrating advanced microbiome analysis 
techniques and neuroimaging can help clarify the mechanisms linking gut health, 
systemic inflammation, and cognitive function. Exploring specific gut microbiota 
strains that regulate systemic inflammation and cognitive function may lead to 
targeted probiotic therapies, potentially alleviating neuroinflammation and 
enhancing cognitive performance. Additionally, understanding the role of oral 
probiotics in periodontal health and their effects on gut microbiota and 
systemic inflammation could contribute to the development of innovative 
treatment approaches. This knowledge can aid molecular biologists, dentists, and 
researchers in managing oral and gut health more effectively.

BACKGROUND: The search for effective treatments for neurodegenerative diseases, 
particularly Alzheimer's disease, has been fraught with challenges. Alzheimer's 
disease accounts for 60-80% of dementia cases globally, affecting approximately 
about 50 million people. Currently, drug repurposing has emerged as a promising 
strategy in new drug development, attracting significant attention from 
regulatory agencies, such as the US FDA.
AIM: This study aimed to investigate the potential therapeutic role of 
dolutegravir in Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment using a novel network 
pharmacology approach. Specifically, it explored the interaction of dolutegravir 
with key molecular targets involved in AD pathology, predicted its effects on 
relevant biological pathways, and evaluated its viability as a new therapeutic 
candidate.
OBJECTIVE: This study employed a network pharmacology framework to evaluate 
dolutegravir, an antiretroviral drug, as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's 
disease, shedding light on its possible therapeutic mechanisms.
METHOD: A network pharmacology approach was used to predict the drug targets of 
dolutegravir. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and 
Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed to identify interacting pathways. 
Additionally, protein- protein interaction (PPI) network analysis was conducted 
to assess key interactions and molecular docking studies were performed to 
evaluate the binding affinity of dolutegravir to the predicted targets.
RESULT: PPI network analysis revealed that dolutegravir interacted with several 
key targets, including BRAF, mTOR, MAPK1, MAPK3, NOS1, BACE1, CAPN1, CASP3, 
CASP7, CASP8, CHUK, IKBKB, PIK3CA, and PIK3CD. KEGG pathway analysis suggested 
that dolutegravir could influence amyloid-beta formation, amyloid precursor 
protein metabolism, and the cellular response to amyloid-beta. Molecular docking 
results showed the highest binding affinity of dolutegravir for PI3KCD (-8.5 
kcal/mol) and MTOR (-8.7 kcal/mol).
CONCLUSION: The findings indicated that dolutegravir holds significant potential 
in modulating key pathways involved in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. These 
results provide a strong foundation for further investigations into the 
therapeutic efficacy and safety of dolutegravir in the treatment of Alzheimer's 
disease. The use of drug repurposing strategies, leveraging Dolutegravir's 
established pharmacological profile, offers a promising route for accelerated 
therapeutic development in AD.

Alzheimer's disease is the leading cause of dementia worldwide. It belongs to 
the group of neurodegenerative ailments caused by the accumulation of 
extracellular β-amyloid plaques (Aβ) and intracellular neurofibrillary tau 
tangles, which damage brain tissue. One of the mechanisms proposed involves 
protein neurotoxicity and neuroinflammation through the purinergic system 
pathway. Several endogenous nucleotides, such as Adenosine 5'-triphosphate 
(ATP), are involved in cell signaling. High ATP levels can cause P2X7 receptor 
hyper-stimulation, resulting in an exacerbated inflammatory process and in 
apoptosis of cells. From this perspective, searching for new therapies becomes 
important to assist in the patient's treatment and quality of life. As a 
flavonoid with several properties, including anti-inflammatory activity, 
Quercetin may be an alternative to alleviate the damage and symptoms caused by 
Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, this review aims to examine the potential of 
Quercetin through P2X7 modulation against neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's 
disease, as it affects the P2X7 receptor by direct and indirect interactions, 
resulting in decreased inflammation levels. Therefore, we believe that Quercetin 
may have significant power in modulating the P2X7 receptor, demonstrating that 
the purinergic system has the potential to modulate neuroinflammation and can 
add to the treatment, reduce disease progression, and result in better 
prognoses. Furthermore, technological alternatives such as Quercetin 
micronization might improve its delivery to target tissues.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, requires 
early intervention to delay cognitive decline and enhance quality of life. This 
national survey of 100 neurologists explored their clinical practices in 
managing early-stage AD, including diagnostic approaches, treatment selection, 
patient counseling and perceived barriers. While neurologists acknowledged the 
importance of early intervention, challenges such as limited resources, time 
constraints and patient non-cooperation hindered optimal care. Variability in 
diagnostic and counseling practices often stemmed from disparities in resources 
and training. These findings highlight the need for revised guidelines, enhanced 
training and improved resources to support neurologists in providing consistent 
and effective early-stage AD care.

BACKGROUND: Beta-synuclein (β-syn), measured at N-terminal epitopes, is an 
emerging cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker for synaptic degeneration in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Targeting the mid-region or C-terminus of β-syn may 
enhance analytical specificity due to the distinct structures of these 
regions across the synuclein protein family, unlike targeting the N-terminus, 
which is conserved across the family. This study aimed to confirm that β-syn is 
a promising CSF biomarker in AD, using novel assays designed to target different 
regions of β-syn, to investigate whether these regions are differentially 
affected in AD.
METHODS: We developed two novel CSF β-syn-specific ELISAs targeting mid-region 
and C-terminus epitopes and assessed their analytical performance. Using these 
novel assays in combination with the established N-terminus ELISA, we analyzed a 
proof-of-concept cohort comprising biomarker-confirmed AD (n = 25) and non-AD 
subjects (n = 25) and a larger clinical cohort (n = 160) from the Amsterdam 
Dementia Cohort, wich included 41 individuals with subjective cognitive decline 
(SCD, controls; AD biomarker negative; 64.3 ± 3.3 years, 23 females), 39 with 
SCD (AD biomarker positive; 65.7 ± 3.1 years, 17 females), 40 with mild 
cognitive impairment due to AD (MCI-AD; 66.2 ± 2.9 years, 20 females), and 40 
with AD dementia (AD-dem; 65.3 ± 3.4 years, 20 females).
RESULTS: Both the mid-region and C-terminus assays demonstrated reliable 
analytical performance. All assays consistently detected β-syn in all clinical 
samples above their limits of detection, with a good average intra-assay 
coefficient of variation (range of the three assays: 2.7-6.5%CV) in the 
proof-of-concept cohort and clinical cohort (range of the three assays: 
3.9-7.5%CV). CSF β-syn levels, with all the assays, were significantly elevated 
in all the AD groups compared with the controls in both cohorts. The diagnostic 
performance of the assays for distinguishing AD patients from controls was 
comparable (Delong's p > 0.05, AUC 0.71-0.80). Notably, mid-region β-syn 
significantly differentiated SCD-AD patients from AD-dem patients (p = 0.035) 
and MCI-AD patients at a trend level. Only mid-region and C-terminal levels 
correlated with MMSE scores (mid-region rho = -0.22, p = 0.006; C-terminal 
rho = -0.19, p = 0.016; N-terminus rho = -0.14, p = 0.069).
CONCLUSION: Our novel assays demonstrated good analytical and clinical 
performance. CSF β-syn reliably indicates early synaptic degeneration in AD. The 
mid-region assay uniquely differentiated SCD-AD from AD-dem, showing promise for 
early disease detection.

Alzheimer disease (AD) is a life-limiting neurodegenerative disorder that 
disproportionately affects women. Indeed, sex and gender are emerging as crucial 
modifiers of diagnostic and therapeutic pathways in AD. This Review provides an 
overview of the interactions of sex and gender with important developments in AD 
and offers insights into priorities for future research to facilitate the 
development and implementation of personalized approaches in the shifting 
paradigm of AD care. In particular, this Review focuses on the influence of sex 
and gender on important advances in the treatment and diagnosis of AD, including 
disease-modifying therapies, fluid-based biomarkers, cognitive assessment tools 
and multidomain lifestyle interventional studies.

Emerging evidence indicates that inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and dementia 
may share underlying pathological mechanisms and risk factors. However, the 
association between a prior IBD diagnosis and the subsequent risk of dementia 
remains largely unexplored. We conducted a comprehensive search of PubMed, 
Embase, and the Cochrane Library up to February 4, 2025, without language 
restrictions. Two reviewers independently extracted data and evaluated 
methodological quality and risk of bias. Observational studies comparing 
dementia risk in IBD and non-IBD populations were included. Pooled effect 
estimates for odds ratios (OR) were calculated using random-effects models. A 
total of 10 population-based studies, involving 7,895,339 participants (269,387 
with IBD), were included. Meta-analysis of eight studies showed a significant 
association between IBD and dementia risk (OR 1.17, 95% CI: 1.08-1.27, 
P = 0.0001). However, IBD was not associated with an increased risk of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) (OR 1.15, 95% CI: 0.98-1.36, P = 0.09). Stratified 
analysis by IBD type revealed a positive association between both ulcerative 
colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) and dementia risk (UC: OR 1.15, 95% CI: 
1.05-1.25, P = 0.002, I² = 81%; CD: OR 1.26, 95% CI: 1.11-1.43, P = 0.0003, I² = 
53%). This study identifies a significant correlation between IBD and dementia, 
suggesting that IBD patients have an elevated risk of developing dementia. 
However, current evidence is insufficient to establish a causal relationship. 
Further research should explore whether effective IBD treatments can mitigate 
this risk and elucidate the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms connecting 
these conditions.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) disproportionately affects women, with postmenopausal 
hormonal changes contributing to elevated risk. Physical exercise is a 
promising, non-pharmacological strategy to mitigate cognitive decline and AD 
progression. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and irisin are key 
molecular mediators of exercise-induced brain health and protection against AD 
pathology by promoting synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis, and reducing 
amyloidosis, tau pathology, and neuroinflammation in sex-specific mechanisms. 
This review explores sex and gender influences on exercise outcomes and their 
interaction with FNDC5/irisin and BDNF signaling pathways in the context of AD 
prevention. We highlight emerging evidence on the interplay between exercise, 
sex, and neuroprotective pathways, emphasizing the need for sex-sensitive 
research designs to advance precision approaches for AD prevention.

BACKGROUND: Transcranial electric stimulation (TES) is a non-invasive 
neuromodulation technique with therapeutic potential for diverse neurological 
disorders including Alzheimer's disease. Conventional TES montages with 
stimulation electrodes in standardized positions suffer from highly varying 
electric fields across subjects due to variable anatomy. Biophysical modelling 
using individual's brain imaging has thus become popular for montage planning 
but may be limited by fixed scalp electrode locations.
OBJECTIVE: Here, we explore the potential benefits of flexible electrode 
positioning with 3D-printed neurostimulator caps.
METHODS: We modeled 10 healthy subjects and simulated montages targeting the 
left angular gyrus, which is relevant for restoring memory functions impaired by 
Alzheimer's disease. Using quantitative metrics and visual inspection, we 
benchmark montages with flexible electrode placement against well-established 
montage selection approaches.
RESULTS: Personalized montages optimized with flexible electrode positioning 
provided tunable intensity and control over the focality-intensity trade-off, 
outperforming conventional montages across the range of achievable target 
intensities. Compared to montages optimized on a reference model, personalized 
optimization significantly reduced variance of the stimulation intensity in the 
target. Finally, increasing available electrode positions from 32 to around 86 
significantly increased target engagement across a range of target intensities 
and current limits.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we provide an in silico proof-of-concept that digitally 
designed and 3D-printed TES caps with flexible electrode positioning can 
increase target engagement with precise and tunable control of applied dose to a 
cortical target. This is of interest for stimulation of brain networks such as 
the default mode network with spatially proximate correlated and anti-correlated 
cortical nodes.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the active components and mechanisms of Lingguizhugan 
decoction (LGZGD) in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through an 
integrated approach.
METHODS: The active components of LGZGD in rat serum were identified using 
HPLC-FTICR MS. Network pharmacology and molecular docking analyses were 
conducted, and their findings were validated using an Aβ1-42-induced AD rat 
model.
RESULTS: Twenty-four active components and 324 common targets were identified 
and used to construct the networks. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis linked key 
target genes with MAPK, Rap1, and NF-κB signaling pathways. Molecular docking 
results indicated that three key targets (IL-6, TNF, and EGFR) and 10 core 
components are closely associated with LGZGD in the treatment of AD. LGZGD 
improved the spatial learning and memory abilities of AD rats. LGZGD reduced 
neuronal damage and increased the number of neurons in the cortex and 
hippocampal CA1 region of AD rats. LGZGD decreased Aβ1-42 expression in the rat 
hippocampus, alleviated oxidative stress in AD rats, and decreased TNF-α, IL-6, 
IL-1β, and HMGB1 levels in the cerebral cortical tissue. LGZGD markedly 
decreased Iba-1 and iNOS expression and increased CD206 levels to inhibit M1 
activation and promote M2 activation. LGZGD increased the expression of 
p-GSK-3β, ERK, and p-ERK, while decreasing the expression of p-Tau, IKKβ, 
p-IκBα, p-p65, p-p38, and p-JNK in the hippocampus of AD rats.
CONCLUSION: LGZGD treats AD by modulating targets like IL-6, TNF, MAPK3, and 
BCL2, thereby alleviating cognitive impairments in rats. Its neuroprotective 
effects in treating AD are mediated through the NF-κB/MAPK signaling pathways.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), the leading cause of dementia, is characterized by 
amyloid plaques and neuroinflammation, which collectively result in cognitive 
decline. Peripheral inflammation, particularly intestinal inflammation, has been 
implicated in exacerbating AD pathology via the gut-brain axis. This study 
investigated the effects of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis on 
amyloid-beta (Aβ) pathology, synaptic integrity, and cognitive function in 5xFAD 
mice, and explored the roles of neutrophil elastase (NE) and Cathepsin B in 
these processes. DSS-induced colitis significantly worsened Aβ pathology, 
evidenced by increased Aβ plaque deposition and elevated soluble Aβ1-42 levels 
in the brain of 5xFAD mice. The inflammatory state triggered extensive 
neutrophil infiltration and elevated NE levels in the hippocampus, which were 
closely associated with Cathepsin B activation. This enzymatic cascade is 
associated with synaptic damage and cognitive deficits. Treatment with the NE 
inhibitor Sivelestat effectively suppressed NE-mediated Cathepsin B activation, 
reduced Aβ pathology, restored dendritic spine density, and improved cognitive 
performance. Additionally, the Cathepsin B inhibitor CA-074 methyl ester 
(CA-074Me) mitigated the adverse effects of DSS-induced colitis, further 
emphasizing the role of Cathepsin B in mediating inflammation-driven AD 
pathology. These findings reveal that the NE-Cathepsin B axis links peripheral 
inflammation to exacerbated Aβ pathology, synaptic damage, and cognitive 
impairment, underscoring the potential of targeting NE and Cathepsin B as 
therapeutic strategies for inflammation-driven AD progression.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of disability worldwide. Risk 
for MDD is heritable, and the genetic structure of founder populations enables 
investigation of rare susceptibility alleles with large effect. In an extended 
Old Order Mennonite family cohort, we identified a rare missense variant in 
GPR156 (c.1599G>T, p.Glu533Asp) associated with a two-fold increase in the 
relative risk of MDD. GPR156 is an orphan G protein-coupled receptor localized 
in the medial habenula, a region implicated in mood regulation. Insertion of a 
human sequence containing c.1599G>T into the murine Gpr156 locus induced medial 
habenula hyperactivity and abnormal stress-related behaviors. This work reveals 
a human variant that is associated with depression, implicates GPR156 as a 
target for mood regulation, and introduces informative murine models for 
investigating the pathophysiology and treatment of affective disorders.

The cerebral microvasculature forms a complex network of vessels essential for 
maintaining brain function. Diseases such as stroke, Alzheimer's disease, 
gliomas, and vascular dementia can profoundly disrupt the microvascular system. 
Unfortunately, current medical imaging modalities offer only indirect 
observations at this scale. Inspired by optical microscopy, ultrasound 
localization microscopy (ULM) overcomes the classical trade-off between 
penetration depth and spatial resolution. By localizing and tracking individual 
injected microbubbles (MBs) with sub-wavelength precision, vascular and velocity 
maps can be generated at the micrometer scale. Here, we present a robust 
protocol for super-resolution imaging of the brain microvasculature in vivo in 
rats using a commercial ultrasound platform. This method achieves 12.5 µm 
spatial resolution, reconstructing the microvascular architecture and providing 
detailed information on blood flow direction and velocity, greatly enhancing our 
understanding of cerebral microcirculation. The protocol can be extended to rat 
disease models, offering a powerful tool for the early diagnosis and treatment 
of neurovascular diseases.

IMPORTANCE: The risk of developing epilepsy substantially increases after the 
age of 60 years (late-onset epilepsy [LOE]), particularly in people with 
cognitive decline ([PWCD] ie, dementia and/or mild cognitive impairment). 
Epilepsy is associated with worse cognitive and mortality outcomes in PWCD. 
Identifying PWCD at risk for developing LOE can facilitate early screening and 
treatment of epilepsy.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate factors associated with LOE in PWCD.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This longitudinal, multicenter study is based 
on participants from 39 US Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers from September 
2005 through December 2021. Of 44 713 participants, 25 119 PWCD were identified. 
Of these, 14 685 were included who did not have epilepsy at enrollment, had 2 or 
more visits, and were 60 years or older at the most recent follow-up.
EXPOSURE: The association between various factors and LOE development in PWCD 
was investigated.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was LOE, defined as seizures 
starting at or after 60 years of age. Those who did not develop LOE but were 60 
years or older at follow-up served as controls. A multivariable Cox regression 
analysis assessed the association between various factors and LOE. Independent 
variables included age, sex, and socioeconomic factors (education, race, 
ethnicity), cardiovascular risks (hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia), 
cerebrovascular disease (stroke or history of transient ischemic attack [TIA]), 
other neurologic comorbidities (Parkinson disease [PD], traumatic brain injury), 
cognition (age at dementia onset, dementia severity, type of dementia [Alzheimer 
disease (AD) vs non-AD]), genetics (apolipoprotein E4 [APOE4] status), lifestyle 
(alcohol misuse, smoking), and depression.
RESULTS: Of the 14 685 participants (7355 female [50%] and 7330 male [50%]; mean 
[SD] age, 73.8 [8.5] years) who met the inclusion criteria, 221 participants 
(1.5%) developed LOE during follow-up. After adjusting for demographics, 
cardiovascular risks, neurologic comorbidities, genetics, cognitive factors, and 
depression, the following were associated with a higher risk of developing LOE: 
APOE4 allele (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.39; 95% CI, 1.04-1.86; P = .03), 
dementia onset before age 60 years (aHR, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.53-3.95; P < .001), 
worse cognition (aHR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.97-2.79; P < .001), AD dementia subtype 
(aHR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.13-2.49; P = .01), stroke/TIA (aHR, 2.03; 95% CI, 
1.37-3.01; P < .001), and PD (aHR, 2.53; 95% CI, 1.08-5.95; P = .03). In 
sensitivity analysis, using an alternative LOE definition of epilepsy onset 
after age 65 years revealed the same factors associated with LOE.
CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: This study showed that the APOE4 allele, dementia 
onset before age 60 years, AD dementia subtype, worse cognition, stroke/TIA, and 
PD are associated with LOE development in PWCD. PWCD with these risk factors may 
be considered for routine screening with an electroencephalogram for early 
identification of LOE.

The antioxidant/anti-inflammatory compound carnosic acid (CA) is a phenolic 
diterpene found in the herbs rosemary and sage. Upon activation, CA manifests 
electrophilic properties to stimulate the Nrf2 transcriptional pathway via 
reaction with Keap1. However, purified CA is readily oxidized and thus highly 
unstable. To develop CA as an Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapeutic, we 
synthesized pro-drug derivatives, among which the di-acetylated form (diAcCA) 
showed excellent drug-like properties. diAcCA converted to CA in the stomach 
prior to absorption into the bloodstream, and exhibited improved stability and 
bioavailability as well as comparable pharmacokinetics (PK) and efficacy to CA. 
To test the efficacy of diAcCA in AD transgenic mice, 5xFAD mice (or littermate 
controls) received the drug for 3 months, followed by behavioral and 
immunohistochemical studies. Notably, in addition to amyloid plaques and tau 
tangles, a hallmark of human AD is synapse loss, a major correlate to cognitive 
decline. The 5xFAD animals receiving diAcCA displayed synaptic rescue on 
immunohistochemical analysis accompanied by improved learning and memory in the 
water maze test. Treatment with diAcCA reduced astrocytic and microglial 
inflammation, amyloid plaque formation, and phospho-tau neuritic aggregates. In 
toxicity studies, diAcCA was as safe or safer than CA, which is listed by the 
FDA as "generally regarded as safe", indicating diAcCA is suitable for human 
clinical trials in AD.

Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dynamics imbalance are key contributors to AD 
pathogenesis. GLPS, an extract from Ganoderma lucidum spores, exhibits 
anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory properties. However, the 
roles of GLPS in regulating oxidative stress and mitochondrial dynamics in AD 
remain poorly understood. Here, the underlying mechanisms of neuroprotective 
effects on cognitive dysfunction in 5 × FAD mice were explored. C57BL/6 mice 
served as WT controls, while 5 × FAD mice were divided into an AD group and an 
AD + GLPS group. The mice in AD + GLPS group were administered daily GLPS (25 
mg/kg) by i.p. injection for two months, while WT and AD mice received an 
equivalent volume of normal saline. The results indicated that GLPS markedly 
improved cognitive function and decreased p-tau and Aβ levels in 5 × FAD mice. 
Moreover, GLPS alleviated oxidative stress by increasing SOD levels and 
decreasing MDA concentrations. It also inhibited excessive mitochondrial 
fragmentation by decreasing the expression of p-Drp1 and Fis1, while increasing 
the levels of Mfn1, Mfn2, and OPA1 in 5 × FAD mice. Mechanistically, GLPS 
activated Nrf2, leading to a marked upregulation of antioxidant enzymes, 
including HO- 1, NQO1, and SOD2 in 5 × FAD mice. Collectively, these findings 
suggest that GLPS ameliorates cognitive deficits in 5 × FAD mice by reducing 
oxidative stress and modulating mitochondrial dynamics through Nrf2-mediated 
antioxidant enzyme activation.

Oxidative stress (OS) is an important factor in the pathophysiology of numerous 
neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, 
cerebrovascular pathology or Alzheimer's disease. OS also significantly 
influences progression among the various neurodegenerative disorders. The 
imbalance between the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the body's 
capacity to neutralize these toxic byproducts renders the brain susceptible to 
oxidative injury. Increased amounts of ROS can result in cellular malfunction, 
apoptosis and neurodegeneration. They also represent a substantial factor in 
mitochondrial dysfunction, a defining characteristic of neurodegenerative 
disorders. Comprehending the fundamental mechanisms of OS and its interactions 
with mitochondrial function, neuroinflammation and cellular protective pathways 
becomes essential for formulating targeted therapeutics to maintain brain health 
and reduce the impacts of neurodegeneration. We address recent highlights on the 
role of OS in brain function in terms of significance for neuronal health and 
the progression of neurodegenerative disorders.

The aggregation of the microtubule-associated protein tau is a distinctive 
characteristic of several neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease 
and frontotemporal dementia. Small-molecule inhibitors have been investigated as 
a potential therapy for tau aggregation-related diseases. Here, we identified 
4-Amino-3',4'-dihydroxychalcone (4-ADHC), a substituted aminochalcone, as an 
inhibitor of different stages of tau aggregation, namely, liquid-liquid phase 
separation, oligomerization, and filamentation. Size exclusion chromatography, 
absorbance, and fluorescence spectroscopic experiments suggested that 4-ADHC 
bound to purified tau. The dissociation constant for the binding of 4-ADHC to 
tau was determined to be 5.1 ± 0.8 μM using surface plasmon resonance. The 
compound potently inhibited heparin and arachidonic acid-induced tau aggregation 
in vitro. However, 4-ADHC neither inhibited tubulin polymerization nor the 
enzymatic activity of alcohol dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase. 
Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments showed that 4-ADHC 
increased tau dynamics in phase-separated droplets, suggesting that the compound 
impeded the maturation of the droplets by increasing their liquid-like behavior. 
Further, atomic force microscopy, dot blot assay, and dynamic light scattering 
experiments demonstrated that the compound suppressed tau oligomerization. In 
addition, 4-ADHC inhibited tau filamentation and disaggregated preformed 
filaments. Thus, 4-ADHC is a candidate for developing potent tau aggregation 
inhibitors.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the major cause of dementia in the elderly, and 
investigations on the impact of risk factors on neurocognitive performance are 
crucial in preventative treatment. While existing statistical regression models, 
such as single-index models, have proven effective tools for uncovering the 
relationship between the neurocognitive scores and covariates of interest such 
as demographic information, clinical variables, and neuroimaging features, 
limited research has explored scenarios where jump discontinuities exist in the 
regression patterns and the covariates are unobservable but measured with 
errors, which are common in real applications. To address these challenges, we 
propose a single-index measurement error jump regression model (SMEJRM) that can 
handle both jump discontinuities and measurement errors in image covariates 
introduced by different image processing software. This development is motivated 
by data from 168 patients in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. We 
establish both the estimation procedure and the corresponding asymptotic 
results. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the finite sample 
performance of our SMEJRM and the estimation procedure. The real application 
reveals that jump discontinuities do exist in the relationship between 
neurocognitive scores and some covariates of interest in this study.

Alzheimer's disease has a prolonged asymptomatic phase during which pathological 
changes accumulate before clinical symptoms emerge. This study aimed to stratify 
the risk of clinical disease to inform future disease-modifying treatments. 
Cerebrospinal fluid analysis from participants in the Emory Healthy Brain Study 
was used to classify individuals based on amyloid beta 42 (Aβ42), total tau 
(tTau) and phosphorylated tau (pTau) levels. Cognitively normal (CN), 
biomarker-positive (CN)/BM+individuals were identified using a tTau: Aβ42 ratio 
> 0.24, determined by Gaussian mixture models. CN/BM+ individuals (n = 134) were 
classified as having asymptomatic Alzheimer's disease (AsymAD), while CN, 
biomarker-negative (CN/BM-) individuals served as controls (n = 134). 
Cognitively symptomatic, biomarker-positive individuals with an Alzheimer's 
disease diagnosis confirmed by the Emory Cognitive Neurology Clinic were 
labelled as Alzheimer's disease (n = 134). Study groups were matched for age, 
sex, race and education. Cerebrospinal fluid samples from these matched Emory 
Healthy Brain Study groups were analysed using targeted proteomics via selected 
reaction monitoring mass spectrometry. The targeted cerebrospinal fluid panel 
included 75 peptides from 58 unique proteins. Machine learning approaches 
identified a subset of eight peptides (ADQDTIR, AQALEQAK, ELQAAQAR, 
EPVAGDAVPGPK, IASNTQSR, LGADMEDVCGR, VVSSIEQK, YDNSLK) that distinguished 
between CN/BM- and symptomatic Alzheimer's disease samples with a binary 
classifier area under the curve performance of 0.98. Using these eight peptides, 
Emory Healthy Brain Study AsymAD cases were further stratified into 
'Control-like' and 'Alzheimer's disease-like' subgroups, representing varying 
levels of risk for developing clinical disease. The eight peptides were 
evaluated in an independent dataset from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative, effectively distinguishing CN/BM- from symptomatic Alzheimer's 
disease cases (area under the curve = 0.89) and stratifying AsymAD individuals 
into control-like and Alzheimer's disease-like subgroups (area under the curve = 
0.89). In the absence of matched longitudinal data, an established 
cross-sectional event-based disease progression model was employed to assess the 
generalizability of these peptides for risk stratification. In summary, results 
from two independent modelling methods and datasets demonstrate that the 
identified eight peptides effectively stratify the risk of progression from 
asymptomatic to symptomatic Alzheimer's disease.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects and safety of combining rivastigmine hydrogen 
tartrate capsules with memantine tablets for Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on AD patients admitted to The 
Third People's Hospital of Yongkang from November 2021 to June 2023. There were 
two groups: a single drug group (n=21) given only memantine tablets, and a 
combination group (n=39) treated with both rivastigmine hydrogen tartrate 
capsules and memantine tablets. Data were collected, including age, gender, 
education, overall response rate, adverse reaction rate, mini-mental state 
examination (MMSE), activity of daily living (ADL), behavioral pathology in 
Alzheimer's disease scale (BEHAVE-AD), serum tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), 
serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) and serum Tau at baseline and at week 12.
RESULTS: In both groups, compared to baseline, at week 12, MMSE increased, while 
ADL, BEHAVE-AD, serum TNF-α, IL-6, and Tau decreased (all P<0.05). After 
treatment, compared with the single drug group at week 12, the combination group 
had a higher MMSE (t=2.519, P=0.015), better effectiveness (χ2=4.331, P=0.037), 
and lower ADL (t=2.418, P=0.019), BEHAVE-AD (t=3.231, P=0.002), TNF-α (t=3.496, 
P=0.001), IL-6 (t=2.513, P=0.015) and Tau (t=2.290, P=0.026) levels.
CONCLUSION: The combination of the two drugs was more effective in alleviating 
AD symptoms with comparable safety. It also showed an edge in suppressing 
pro-inflammatory cytokines and Tau in AD.

Rationale: The translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO) is mainly expressed on the 
outer mitochondrial membrane and is implicated in inflammation, cell survival, 
and proliferation. TSPO expression in activated microglia is upregulated in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), representing both a biomarker and therapeutic target 
for neuroinflammation. Methods: We synthesized a new TSPO ligand, TEMNAP, a 
hybrid of temazepam, a compound well known for its ability to bind TSPO, and 
naproxen, a drug with anti-inflammatory properties that is potentially useful to 
mitigate neuroinflammation. TEMNAP was encapsulated in a self-assembling 
nanoparticle transferrin-targeted (SANP-TF-TEMNAP) for brain delivery. The 
effectiveness of TEMNAP in mitigating inflammatory processes and cognitive 
behavior was investigated in genetically modified Tg2576 mice, a model of 
Alzheimer's disease. Its effect on neuroinflammation has also been explored in 
lipopolysaccharide-activated BV2 microglial cells. Results: SANP-TEMNAP 
significantly reduced the expression of proinflammatory markers in activated 
microglia, and this effect was abrogated by TSPO silencing. More importantly, 
TEMNAP was mass-spectrometrically detected in the hippocampus and cortex of 
Tg2576 mice after SANP-TF-TEMNAP intraperitoneal administration, preventing 
hippocampal neuroinflammation and improving cognitive function. Conclusions: 
These results emphasize the following: (i) the role of transferrin-conjugated 
self-assembling nanoparticles (SANP-TF) as CNS nanovectors, and (ii) the 
potential therapeutic effectiveness of peripherally administered SANP-TF-TEMNAP 
in preventing neuroinflammation associated with cognitive decline.

INTRODUCTION: Minimal clinically important differences (MCIDs) for Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) have previously been estimated using clinician-based anchors. 
However, MCIDs have been criticized for not reflecting the preferences of people 
living with AD (PLWAD). Furthermore, interpretations of clinical trial results 
have been criticized for conflating within-person meaningfulness thresholds and 
between-group differences. Here, we simulate scenarios of disease slowing and 
compare those to published MCIDs.
METHODS: Scenarios of 5%-95% disease slowing were simulated using Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data. Time saved and point differences on 
the Clinical Dementia Rating scale-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) were estimated for 
these scenarios and compared to published MCIDs.
RESULTS: Scenario analyses resulted in estimates of time saved at ∼3 weeks-17 
months and mean changes at 0.08-1.5 CDR-SB points over 18 months. The often 
referenced MCID for mild cognitive impairment (0.98) thereby corresponded to 11 
months slowing, whereas the MCID for mild dementia (1.63) corresponded to >17 
months slowing.
DISCUSSION: Translating trial endpoints to estimates of time saved supports that 
often-referenced MCIDs may not be aligned with realistic and meaningful slowing 
of clinical progression.
HIGHLIGHTS: AD slowing of clinical progression by 5%-95% resulted in 0.74-17 
months saved and 0.08-1.5 CDR-SB points change at 18 months.Slowing of at least 
60% or 11 months of time saved over 18 months met an often-cited MCID threshold 
of 0.98 points for mild cognitive impairment.For mild AD dementia, an MCID of 
1.63 meant that even an 18-month delay over 18 months would be considered only 
borderline meaningful-a face invalid and unrealistic proposition.

INTRODUCTION: We aimed to determine the clinical efficacy of treating 
apolipoprotein E (ApoE) ε4 homozygotes with recently approved anti-amyloid 
antibodies.
METHODS: Data were derived from supplementary analyses in the regulatory studies 
Clarity (lecanemab) and TRAILBLAZER-ALZ2 (donanemab). We used Bayesian 
reanalysis with an independent t-statistic to determine evidence for or against 
an effect of antibody treatment on Clinical Dementia Rating scale Sum of Boxes 
(CDR-SB) in ApoE ε4 homozygotes, and a Bayesian random-effect meta-analysis to 
determine the effect size.
RESULTS: The Bayesian reanalysis showed moderate evidence of no effect for both 
antibodies. For donanemab and lecanemab, the odds of no difference in treatment 
effect were nearly three times greater than the odds of a difference. The 
meta-analysis revealed a small effect of -0.06 CDR-SB points in favor of 
treatment with a moderate heterogeneity estimate. The Bayes factor was 0.26, 
indicating that the absence of an effect was almost four times more likely than 
the presence of an effect.
DISCUSSION: The most likely explanation for our results is the lack of a 
treatment effect for lecanemab and donanemab in ApoE ε4 homozygotes. This could 
reflect inadequate exposure to the antibody due to more severe side effects, 
subsequent treatment interruptions, and lower dosing or a biologically driven 
lack of efficacy in a genetically determined disease. Our results support the 
view that excluding these cases from treatment is justifiable because of the 
higher risk of side effects and the lack of clinical efficacy.
HIGHLIGHTS: Lecanemab and donanemab were clinically ineffective in ApoE ε4 
homozygotes.ApoE ε4 homozygotes should not receive these treatments due to 
inefficacy.Future trials should adopt Bayesian analysis strategies.Bayesian 
analysis provides evidence for or against treatment effects.Bayesian inference 
provides clinically interpretable results.

Movement disorders associated with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in 
Alzheimer's dementia: A systematic review.

Rissardo JP(1), Caprara ALF(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Neurology, Cooper University Hospital, Camden, NJ, USA.

BACKGROUND: Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) are widely used in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aims to systematically review the 
literature about movement disorders (MDs) associated with AChEIs for AD, which 
include donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine, tacrine, and ipidacrine.
METHODOLOGY: Two reviewers conducted a comprehensive review of relevant studies 
across six databases, without language restrictions, covering publications from 
1992 to 2024.
RESULTS: Overall, 74 studies containing 92 cases were found of MDs related to 
ACHEIs. The MDs found were Pisa syndrome in 33 patients, parkinsonism in 31, 
myoclonus in 11, dystonia in 10, dyskinesia in 6, and extrapyramidal symptoms in 
1. Regarding the medications, the abnormal movements were associated with 
donepezil in 62 cases, rivastigmine in 15, galantamine in 10, and tacrine in 5. 
No case of ipidacrine-induced MD was found. Overall, the most commonly affected 
sex was the female, accounting for 61.9% of the cases. The mean and median age 
was 74.1 (standard deviation: 8.9) and 75 years (range: 49-93 years). The MD 
occurred within 6 months of the starting of AChEI in approximately 70% of the 
patients. Furthermore, the full recovery of the MD after the main management was 
noticed within 6 months in about 80% of the patients. About 86.3% of the 
individuals fully recovered after treatment, which included AChEI 
discontinuation, dose adjustment, and prescription of additional therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of tacrine-induced tremor indicated a potential 
predisposition to movement disorders associated with AChEI therapy. Based on the 
drug class side effect profile, it is possible that future studies may observe 
abnormal movements with other AChEIs.

BACKGROUND: The disorder of the intestinal fungal community is closely 
associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Gut fungal dysbiosis exacerbates 
β-amyloid (Aβ) plaque burden through the brain-gut axis, thereby promoting the 
progression of AD. Previous research has demonstrated that acupuncture can 
ameliorate AD symptoms by modulating the gut bacterial community. However, the 
potential regulatory effects of acupuncture on the fungal microbiota have been 
largely overlooked.
METHODS: APP/PS1 mice were used as AD animal model and randomly divided into the 
AD model (AD) group, the acupuncture (Ac) group, and the probiotics (Pr) group. 
Mice in the Ac group received acupuncture treatment. In the Pr group, mice were 
treated with probiotics. Morris water maze, ITS sequencing, immunofluorescence 
(IF) staining, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Hematoxylin and eosin 
analysis, and Nissl staining were employed to validate our hypothesis.
RESULTS: Acupuncture and probiotics significantly improved the behavioral 
performance of APP/PS1 mice, reduced the level of Aβ in the brain, and 
alleviated neuronal damage. Moreover, acupuncture improved the Sobs, Chao and 
Ace indices, decreased the abundance of Ascomycota, Aspergilaceae, 
Trichocomaceae, Candida, and unclassified-penicillium, while simultaneously 
increasing the abundance of Basidiomycota, which differed from the fungal 
regulation observed with probiotics.
CONCLUSION: Acupuncture may improve the cognitive impairment of APP/PS1 mice, 
reduce Aβ plaque burden in the brain, protect neurons, and mitigate intestinal 
fungi dysbiosis. The beneficial effects of acupuncture on Aβ deposition and 
cognitive function in APP/PS1 mice may be achieved by regulating the intestinal 
fungal community.

The exploration of GLP-1 receptor agonists as pleiotropic agents in the 
treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders and substance use disorders is a rapidly 
evolving field. While early studies have shown promising results, much of the 
research is still nascent, and larger clinical trials are definitely needed to 
confirm the safety and efficacy of these agents on real grounds.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder among 
older adults, significantly impairs behavioral and cognitive functions, posing a 
severe threat to patients' health and quality of life. The Tricetin (TRN), a 
natural flavonoid found in wheat, pomegranate, and eucalyptus honey, has 
demonstrated anti-inflammatory, antitumor, and neuroprotective properties. 
However, its role in the context of AD has not been previously explored. This 
study investigated the antineuroinflammatory and autophagic protective effects 
of TRN in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced BV2 cells and D-galactose/sodium 
nitrite/aluminum chloride (D-gal/NaNO2/AlCl3)-induced AD mice. The RNA 
sequencing examined the underlying mechanisms by which TRN ameliorates 
AD-related pathologies. Our research findings revealed that TRN significantly 
improved memory and mobility in AD mice, reduced Aβ deposition, and inhibited 
Tau protein phosphorylation. Furthermore, TRN regulated enzyme activities and 
reduced pathological markers associated with AD. Moreover, it modulated 
inflammatory mediators, inhibited the nuclear translocation of NF-κB in 
LPS-induced BV2 cells, and exerted anti-inflammatory and autophagic protective 
effects via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. In conclusion, TRN demonstrated 
robust neuroprotective effects in vitro and in vivo AD models by regulating the 
PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. These findings highlight its potential as a 
promising therapeutic agent for treating AD.

BACKGROUND: The development of the Richmond Brain Health Initiative (RBHI) was 
guided by the need to address local brain health service gaps to improve 
Alzheimer's/Dementia health disparities in racially diverse communities. This 
paper describes the establishment of RBHI through 1) community and provider 
stakeholder input and 2) community brain health screening/intake development and 
testing.
METHODS: Phase 1 involved provider and community stakeholder questionnaires to 
gather feedback as part of the Plan-Do-Study-Act cycle. Subsequently, 
stakeholder findings directed the RBHI structure and screening/intake 
registration testing in the community.
RESULTS: Based on the stakeholder responses from fifteen providers and twenty 
community members, there was strong consensus in the need for local brain health 
services. The most highly recommended screening needs were for caregiving, 
cognitive status, and lifestyle risks. Thereafter the RBHI screening/intake was 
developed and completed by 45 community participants. Participants showed 
hypertension (62%) as the most prevalent brain health risk factor, followed by 
depression/anxiety (56%), and loneliness (44%). The intake also indicated 
cognitive and functional deficits, with the Montreal Cognitive mean equaling 
18.4 and the Functional Activities mean equaling 14.9. Additionally, 73% of 
participants reported experiencing subjective cognitive decline.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showcases a model for promoting brain health in racially 
diverse communities to improve access to Alzheimer's disease and related 
dementia resources and services.

Exploring Metformin's Therapeutic Potential for Alzheimer's Disease: An 
In-Silico Perspective Using Well-Tempered Funnel Metadynamics.

Technology Patna, Patna 801106, India.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), often referred to as the "diabetes of the brain", is 
intricately linked to insulin resistance. Metformin, a first-line antidiabetic 
drug, has been anticipated as a potential treatment for AD and is currently 
undergoing phase 3 clinical trials. The potential success of metformin in 
treating AD could herald a new era in the management of this debilitating 
disease, providing hope for millions of people affected worldwide. Despite this 
fact, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of 
metformin on AD remain poorly understood. To pursue this, in this present work, 
we implement a comprehensive computational approach combining classical 
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and the advanced enhanced sampling technique 
funnel metadynamics (FM) to explore the dynamics and affinity of metformin and 
acetylcholinesterase (AChE), a novel target for AD. The MD and FM simulations 
suggest that metformin induces significant configurational changes within the 
AChE, resulting in weak and nonspecific binding. Furthermore, the presence of 
metformin alters the conformational landscape of AChE causing the emergence of 
metastable states and less rigid binding patterns. The binding energies for the 
metformin-AChE complex are -4.89 ± 1.2 kcal/mol and -1.68 ± 0.2 kcal/mol, as 
estimated through the molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area 
(MMPBSA) and FM approaches, respectively. To elucidate the binding energy 
relevance calculated by MMPBSA and FM approach with experimental inhibitory 
potency, ΔGexp is calculated using IC50 value reported in prior experimental 
studies. ΔGexp is estimated to be -3.59 kcal/mol. A comparison of these binding 
energy values with different methods highlights the moderate inhibitory potency 
of metformin toward AChE. This work provides molecular-level insights 
emphasizing the dynamic configurational changes induced by metformin within AChE 
and underscores its translational potential in the repurposing of AD.

Neuroinflammation precedes the clinical symptoms onset of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) by decades. However, the anti-inflammatory drugs were not always effective 
at all stages of the disease. Here, using the fly and mouse AD models, we 
evaluated the effects of anti-inflammatory drugs on inflammatory-related factors 
and the proinflammatory cytokines at different ages of AD animals. We also 
performed behavioral tests to evaluate the cognitive aspects of AD. Combined 
with the bioinformatics analysis, we would like to exhibit a better 
understanding of AD. Based on the previous studies and reanalysis of published 
database, we found aged AD animals might better represent the inflammatory 
status of symptomatic AD. Our results showed that mRNA levels of antimicrobial 
peptides (AMPs) were highly expressed in 10-day-old AD flies, while no 
significant difference was observed in 40-day-old AD. In aged APP/PS1 mice (22.5 
months), inflammatory-related factors NF-κB, IBA1, and the mRNA levels of 
proinflammatory cytokines Il-1β and Il-6 were not differentially expressed. In 
contrast, a significant increase was observed in 7.5-month-old APP/PS1 mice. 
Moreover, the anti-inflammatory drug Montelukast (MON) did not ameliorate the 
inflammatory and cognitive defects in 22.5-month-old aged mice but showed a 
rescue effect in 7.5-month-old young APP/PS1 mice. Altogether, our study 
demonstrates the different inflammatory status might lead to variations of 
anti-inflammatory drug efficacy, which helps to clarify the importance of 
considering the pathological stage of the disease when administering treatment.

BACKGROUND: The impact of the environmentally sustainable EAT-Lancet diet on 
dementia risk remains poorly understood. The aim was to investigate associations 
between the EAT-Lancet diet and incident dementia.
METHODS: Associations of the EAT-Lancet diet with all-cause dementia, 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), and vascular dementia (VaD) were investigated among 
25,898 participants from the Malmö Diet and Cancer study, Sweden. Participants 
aged 45-73 years were recruited for the baseline examination between 1991 and 
1996, and the mean follow-up time was 18 years. To assess robustness of 
estimations, we used seven previously constructed EAT-Lancet diet scores. 
Multi-adjusted Cox proportional hazard analyses were performed, with results 
presented per 10 % in increment scores. Additionally, we explored the 
potentially modifying effect of APOE ε4 status in this context.
RESULTS: With one of the scores, higher adherence to the EAT-Lancet diet was 
associated with a reduced risk of AD and all-cause dementia. Moreover, the 
results suggest an interplay between the EAT-Lancet diet and APOE ε4 status. A 
risk-reducing effect was observed among APOE ε4 non-carriers with three of the 
scores in relation to AD, and with five of the scores in relation to all-cause 
dementia. No associations were observed among APOE ε4 carriers, or in relation 
to VaD.
CONCLUSION: The results indicate a risk reducing effect of adhering to the 
EAT-Lancet diet among APOE ε4 non-carriers, and no negative effects on dementia 
risk were detected. Future studies should consider the potentially modifying 
effect of APOE ε4 status, and the implications of methodological differences in 
measuring adherence to the EAT-Lancet diet.

Stress, a common life experience, impacts both mental and physical health, 
contributing to conditions such as anxiety and cardiovascular disease. It 
triggers physiological and psychological responses, primarily through the 
Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) and Sympathetic-Adrenal-Medullary (SAM) 
axes, which are coordinated by the autonomic nervous system. Dysregulation of 
the glucocorticoid system, mediated by mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid 
receptors, plays a critical role in neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's 
disease. Cellular pathways like PI3K/Akt, NF-κB, and AP-1 transcription factors 
maintain homeostasis during stress and are targets for therapeutic research. 
Epigenetic influences and genomic modifications highlight the long-lasting 
effects of stress on gene expression. Adaptive responses, such as allostasis, 
allow the body to maintain stability amid stress. However, excessive stress 
leads to allostatic load, negatively impacting the immune, endocrine, and 
nervous systems. Current treatments include pharmacological and lifestyle 
interventions, with emerging approaches such as psychobiotics and precision 
medicine offering future potential.

Aging serves as a pivotal factor in the etiology of numerous diseases, such as 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease, diabetes, osteoarthritis, 
atherosclerosis and aging-related macular degeneration. Notably, these diseases 
often interact with AD through various pathways, facilitating the onset or 
progression of one another. Semaphorin 3 A (Sema3A), a protein that is essential 
for axonal guidance during neural development, has recently been identified as a 
novel regulator in the pathogenesis and progression of multiple aging-related 
diseases. This article provides a comprehensive review of the expression 
patterns and mechanisms of action of Sema3A in these diseases. Specifically, 
Sema3A influences the occurrence and development of aging-related diseases by 
participating in oxidative stress, inflammatory responses, apoptosis, and 
synaptic plasticity. Therefore, therapeutic strategies targeting Sema3A present 
promising avenues for delaying the progression of aging-related diseases and 
offer novel insights and strategies for their treatment.

Disrupted or insufficient sleep is a well-documented risk factor for Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) and related dementias. Previous studies in our lab and others have 
shown that chronic fragmentation of the daily sleep-wake rhythm in mice can 
accelerate the development of AD-related neuropathology in the brain, including 
increases in the levels of amyloid-β (Aβ). Although sleep is known to increase 
clearance of Aβ via the glymphatic system, little is known about the effect of 
sleep on Aβ production and the role this might play in amyloid deposition. To 
examine the relationship of Aβ production and its interaction with sleep and 
sleep dysfunction, we treated mice from an APP × PS1 mutant knock-in line 
(APPΔNLh/ΔNLh × PS1P264L/P264L) with an inhibitor of γ-secretase (LY-450,139; 
Semagacestat®) during a protocol of mild sleep fragmentation (SF). Compared to 
the male mice, the female mice slept less, and had more Aβ pathology. 
Semagacestat treatment reduced Aβ, but only in the most soluble extractable 
fraction. Although the female mice showed an increase in the amount of Aβ 
following SF, this effect was blocked by Semagacestat, an effect that was not 
seen in the male mice. SF also led to a significant, sex-dependent changes in 
the relative amounts of C-terminal fragments of the amyloid precursor protein, 
the immediate substrate of the γ-secretase enzyme. These findings indicate that 
the relationship between disruption of the daily sleep-wake rhythm and the 
development of AD-related pathology is complex, and may involve unappreciated 
interactions with biological sex. Consideration of these factors is necessary 
for a better understanding of AD risk, especially the elevated risk in women.

Tau hyperphosphorylation was the initial recognized pathogenic tau protein 
post-translational modification in Alzheimer's disease. In our present research, 
treatment of diethyl (3,4-dihydroxy phenethylamine) (quinolin-4-yl) 
methylphosphonate (DDQ) HT22 cells with mTau transfected HT22 cells decreased 
the phosphorylation of tau at Ser202, Thr205, p-ERK, and increased LC3B, and 
TOM20 as detected by Western blots. Moreover, DDQ p-tau and p-ERK inhibition of 
phosphorylation also contributed to significant mitochondrial protection in the 
presence of mTau. Taken together, for the first time, we found that DDQ is 
involved in phosphorylation inhibition to restore the mitophagy, which may 
relate to the Sirt3 activation of the ERK-CREB mediated pathway.

The association of Swiss Memory Clinics (SMC) provides intersocietal 
recommendations for the use of anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in 
Switzerland. The recommendations are the result of extensive interdisciplinary 
discussions in a group of Swiss dementia experts from August 2023 until December 
2024. They reflect the opinion of all societies involved in the diagnosis and 
treatment of dementia patients in Switzerland. Special emphasis is given to 
aspects that are specific to the Swiss landscape, including recommendations for 
infrastructural and personnel standards for institutions aiming to administer 
anti-amyloid mAbs in Switzerland.

BackgroundParkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive degenerative disease 
affecting people at any age; however, it is generally more prevalent in older 
age groups. Younger individuals, especially women, are facing significant 
challenges that pertain to pregnancy. Unfortunately, the available information 
is limited and supported mostly by anecdotical experience.ObjectiveTo gain 
insight into the interaction between early-onset PD and pregnancy.MethodsWe 
report on a case series of women, diagnosed with PD, that underwent pregnancy to 
explore the disease catachrestic, natural history, and different challenges 
associated with these unique group of people.ResultsWe identified a total of 9 
participants who met our inclusion criteria, who had gone through a total of 12 
pregnancies after onset of PD motor symptoms. In 10 out of 12 pregnancies, 
participants did not use any PD medication; throughout 1 pregnancy, a 
participant used pramipexole and throughout 1 pregnancy, a participant used 
levodopa/carbidopa.ConclusionsOur study supports the importance of further 
multicentric studies on pregnant women with PD to prospectively collect data on 
complications, birth outcomes, lactation, and PD severity.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, and the role 
of ANO6 in its progression remains largely unexplored. GSE118553 database was 
analyzed for ANO6 expression in AD. A total of 1 μmol/L Aβ1-42 treated SH-SY5Y 
cells were constructed as a cell model of AD. qRT-PCR and ELISA were used to 
detect the expression of ANO6, GPX4, ATF6, GRP78, IREIα expression and lipid 
peroxidation level. Endoplasmic reticulum(ER) stress was induced by using 
clindamycin and lipid peroxidation indicators were detected. ANO6 was 
concurrently regulated in ER stress induced by clindamycin treatment. The 
STRING-DB database was utilized to predict potential target molecules of ANO6, 
while Western blot analysis was conducted to detect the expression levels of 
TMEM30A and evaluate the impact of ANO6-targeted TMEM30A on the protein levels 
within the PERK-eIF2α-ATF4-CHOP pathway. ANO6 was highly expressed in AD model, 
Aβ1-42 induced ANO6 enrichment in SH-SY5Y cells. ANO6 interference increased the 
proliferation level of AD model cells, decreased the levels of GPX4, an 
indicator of ferroptosis, and lipid peroxidation, and down-regulated the 
expression of the ER stress-related proteins ATF6, GRP78, and IREIα. 
Clotrimazole-induced ER stress in AD model cells showed elevated expression of 
ANO6. ANO6 could target and inhibit TMEM30A to affect PERK-eIF2α-ATF4-CHOP 
pathway activity, regulate ER stress-dependent ferroptosis, and reduce neuronal 
loss injury. ANO6 can target inhibition of TMEM30A affecting PERK- IF2α- ATF4- 
CHOP pathway activity, modulate ER stress-dependent ferroptosis-induced AD 
progression to reduce neuronal loss injury.

The co-occurrence of insulin resistance (IR)-related metabolic conditions with 
neuropsychiatric disorders is a major public health challenge. Evidence of the 
genetic links between these phenotypes is emerging, but little is currently 
known about the genomic regions and biological functions that are involved. To 
address this, we performed Local Analysis of [co]Variant Association (LAVA) 
using large-scale (N = 9,725-933,970) genome-wide association studies (GWASs) 
results for three IR-related conditions (type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, and 
metabolic syndrome) and nine neuropsychiatric disorders. Subsequently, 
positional and expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL)-based gene mapping and 
downstream functional genomic analyses were performed on the significant loci. 
Patterns of negative and positive local genetic correlations (|rg| = 0.21-1, 
pFDR < 0.05) were identified at 109 unique genomic regions across all phenotype 
pairs. Local correlations emerged even in the absence of global genetic 
correlations between IR-related conditions and Alzheimer's disease, bipolar 
disorder, and Tourette's syndrome. Genes mapped to the correlated regions showed 
enrichment in biological pathways integral to immune-inflammatory function, 
vesicle trafficking, insulin signalling, oxygen transport, and lipid metabolism. 
Colocalisation analyses further prioritised 10 genetically correlated regions 
for likely harbouring shared causal variants, displaying high deleterious or 
regulatory potential. These variants were found within or in close proximity to 
genes, such as SLC39A8 and HLA-DRB1, that can be targeted by supplements and 
already known drugs, including omega-3/6 fatty acids, immunomodulatory, 
antihypertensive, and cholesterol-lowering drugs. Overall, our findings 
highlight the complex genetic architecture of IR-neuropsychiatric 
multimorbidity, advocating for an integrated disease model and offering novel 
insights for research and treatment strategies in this domain.

Characteristic cerebral pathological changes of Alzheimer's disease (AD) such as 
glucose hypometabolism or the accumulation of cleavage products of the amyloid 
precursor protein (APP), known as Aβ peptides, lead to sustained endoplasmic 
reticulum (ER) stress and neurodegeneration. To preserve ER homeostasis, cells 
activate their unfolded protein response (UPR). The rhomboid-like-protease 4 
(RHBDL4) is an enzyme that participates in the UPR by targeting proteins for 
proteasomal degradation. We demonstrated previously that RHBDL4 cleaves APP in 
HEK293T cells, leading to decreased total APP and Aβ. More recently, we showed 
that RHBDL4 processes APP in mouse primary mixed cortical cultures as well. 
Here, we aim to examine the physiological relevance of RHBDL4 in the brain. We 
first found that brain samples from AD patients and an AD mouse model (APPtg) 
showed increased RHBDL4 mRNA and protein expression. To determine the effects of 
RHBDL4's absence on APP physiology in vivo, we crossed APPtg mice to a RHBDL4 
knockout (R4-/-) model. RHBDL4 deficiency in APPtg mice led to increased total 
cerebral APP and amyloidogenic processing when compared to APPtg controls. 
Contrary to expectations, as assessed by cognitive tests, RHBDL4 absence rescued 
cognition in 5-month-old female APPtg mice. Informed by unbiased RNA-seq data, 
we demonstrated in vitro and in vivo that RHBDL4 absence leads to greater levels 
of active β-catenin due to decreased proteasomal clearance. Decreased β-catenin 
activity is known to underlie cognitive defects in APPtg mice and AD. Our work 
suggests that RHBDL4's increased expression in AD, in addition to regulating APP 
levels, leads to aberrant degradation of β-catenin, contributing to cognitive 
impairment.

BACKGROUND: Agitation and aggression are challenging behavioral and 
psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) in Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is 
diagnosed based on NINCDS-ADRDA criteria. Limited efficacy and safety of 
existing pharmacotherapies complicate treatment. Agomelatine, a melatonergic 
agonist and serotonergic antagonist, may provide a safer and more effective 
alternative.
OBJECTIVES: The primary outcome is to evaluate the efficacy of agomelatine as an 
add-on therapy to nonpharmacological treatment in reducing agitation and 
aggression in patients with AD, with secondary outcomes assessing its safety and 
potential neuroprotective effects.
METHODS: In a randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 56 patients 
with AD (aged ≥65) experiencing agitation and aggression received 12.5 mg 
agomelatine (n = 28) or placebo (n = 28) daily for 6 weeks. The primary outcome 
was the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) score change. Secondary 
outcomes included serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels and 
safety.
RESULTS: At 6 weeks, the agomelatine group showed a greater reduction in CMAI 
scores than placebo (mean difference: -12.39, 95% CI: -19.37 to -5.42; p = 
0.001). No significant BDNF changes were detected (p = 0.848). Total adverse 
events (AEs) were more common in the agomelatine group (50.0% vs. 21.4%, p = 
0.050), but no serious AEs or liver enzyme abnormalities were reported.
CONCLUSION: A daily dose of 12.5 mg agomelatine may effectively and safely 
reduce agitation and aggression in patients with AD when used as an add-on 
therapy. However, further studies with larger samples and extended durations are 
needed to definitively confirm agomelatine's role in managing BPSD in AD.

BACKGROUND: Dietary nitrate, as a nitric oxide (NO) precursor, may support brain 
health and protect against dementia.
OBJECTIVE: Our primary aim was to investigate whether dietary nitrate is 
associated with neuroimaging markers of brain health linked with Alzheimer's 
disease (AD).
PARTICIPANTS: Study participants were cognitively unimpaired individuals from 
the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle Study of Ageing (AIBL) who had 
β-amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) scans (n = 554) and magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) scans (n = 335) and had completed a Food Frequency 
Questionnaire at baseline.
METHODS: Source-specific nitrate intakes were estimated using comprehensive 
nitrate food composition databases. Rates of cerebral β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition, 
measured using PET, and rates of brain atrophy, measured using MRI, were 
assessed between baseline and 126-months follow-up, at intervals of 18 months. 
Multivariable-adjusted linear mixed effect models were used to examine 
associations between baseline source-specific nitrate intake and rates of (i) 
cerebral Aβ deposition and (ii) brain atrophy, over the 126 months of follow-up. 
Analyses were carried out following stratification of the sample by established 
dementia Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk factors including sex and presence or 
absence of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele.
RESULTS: In women carriers of the APOE ε4 allele, higher plant sourced nitrate 
intake (median intake 121 mg/day), was associated with a slower rate of cerebral 
Aβ deposition [β: 4.47 versus 8.99 Centiloid (CL) /18 months, p < 0.05] and 
right hippocampal atrophy [-0.01 versus -0.03 mm3 /18 months, p < 0.01], after 
multivariable adjustments. Moderate intake showed protective associations in men 
carriers and in both men and women non-carriers of APOE ε4.
CONCLUSIONS: Associations were observed between plant-derived nitrate intake and 
cerebral Aβ deposition, particularly in high-risk populations (women and APOE ε4 
carriers). Associations were also observed for brain volume atrophy, however 
these exhibited subgroup variability without clear patterns relative to sex and 
APOE ε4 allele carriage. These findings suggest a potential link between 
plant-sourced nitrate and AD related neuroimaging markers of brain health 
improved brain health, but further validation in larger studies is required.

Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), including Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD), are characterized by 
progressive neuronal loss and functional decline, posing significant global 
health challenges. Emerging evidence highlights nicotinamide N-methyltransferase 
(NNMT), a cytosolic enzyme regulating nicotinamide (NAM) methylation, as a 
pivotal player in NDs through its dual impact on epigenetic regulation and 
metabolic homeostasis. This review synthesizes current knowledge on NNMT's role 
in disease pathogenesis, focusing on its epigenetic modulation via DNA 
hypomethylation and histone modifications, alongside its disruption of NAD+ 
synthesis and homocysteine (Hcy) metabolism. Elevated NNMT activity depletes 
NAD+, exacerbating mitochondrial dysfunction and impairing energy metabolism, 
while increased Hcy levels drive oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and 
aberrant protein aggregation (e.g., Aβ, tau, α-synuclein). Notably, NNMT 
overexpression in AD and PD correlates with neuronal hypomethylation and 
neurotoxicity, as observed in postmortem brain studies and transgenic models. 
Mechanistically, NNMT consumes S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), limiting methyl donor 
availability for DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and histone methyltransferases 
(HMTs), thereby altering gene expression patterns critical for neuronal 
survival. Concurrently, NNMT-mediated NAD+ depletion disrupts sirtuin activity 
(e.g., SIRT1) and mitochondrial biogenesis, accelerating axonal degeneration. 
Therapeutic strategies targeting NNMT, such as RNA interference (RNAi), 
small-molecule inhibitors and exercise therapy, show promise in preclinical 
models by restoring NAD+ levels and reducing Hcy toxicity. However, challenges 
persist in achieving cellular specificity, optimizing blood-brain barrier 
penetration, and mitigating off-target effects. This review underscores NNMT's 
potential as a multifactorial therapeutic target, bridging metabolic and 
epigenetic dysregulation in NDs. Future research should prioritize elucidating 
tissue-specific NNMT interactions, refining inhibitor pharmacokinetics, and 
validating translational efficacy in clinical trials. Addressing these gaps 
could pave the way for novel disease-modifying therapies to combat the rising 
burden of neurodegeneration.

BACKGROUND: As an adjunct or alternative to conventional pharmacotherapy, vagus 
nerve stimulation (VNS) which is FDA-approved has arisen as a novel means for 
various neurological disorders.
METHOD: We searched multiple databases (through 2024) for randomised trials and 
observational studies of VNS (invasive and transcutaneous) and pharmacological 
treatments (e.g. cholinergic agents, antiepileptics, antidepressants) across 
several neurological disorders. Prior to comparing between VNS and 
pharmacological treatments, subgroup analyses of VNS studies were performed for 
disorder type, patient demographics, VNS stimulation parameters, and treatment 
duration to illustrate whether VNS itself can be effective to a satisfactory 
extent to be compared against the conventional method. Efficacy and adverse 
effects were evaluated, based on the proportion of patients achieving more than 
50 % symptom reduction or equivalent clinical improvement, or all-cause 
mortality where applicable. Evaluation between VNS and pharmacological 
treatments was performed through network meta-analysis, followed by assessment 
of heterogeneity (I2) and meta-regression. Risk of bias was evaluated with 
Cochrane criteria, and all studies (including those with high risk of bias) were 
included in the primary analysis (with sensitivity analyses excluding high-bias 
studies).
RESULTS: We included 56 VNS-related studies (n = 5773 participants) and 29 
pharmacological drug-based studies (n = 14827 participants) from spanning 
epilepsy, depression, migraine/headache, Alzheimer's disease, inflammatory 
disorders, and heart failure. A network meta-analysis directly comparing VNS to 
pharmacological drugs yielded an overall advantage for VNS (summary SMD = 0.27 
favouring VNS, 95 % CI 0.19-0.35). However, the high heterogeneity and risk of 
bias have been assessed, indicating potential issues with the VNS studies.
CONCLUSION: Overall, VNS was shown to be a viable therapeutic modality across 
diverse neurological disorders, superior to standard pharmacological treatments 
with a distinct adverse effect profile. It appears particularly beneficial in 
conditions where conventional drugs have limited success (e.g. refractory 
epilepsy, depression), although patient-specific factors influence outcomes. 
Further high-quality trials are anticipated to optimise stimulation parameters, 
confirm long-term benefits, and manage patient selection for VNS.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown significant sex differences in AD with 
regarding its epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and 
treatment response. However, the transcriptome variances associated with sex in 
AD remain unclear.
METHODS: RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and transcriptomic analyses were performed on 
peripheral blood samples from total of 54 patients, including male AD patients 
(n = 15), female AD patients (n = 10), male MCI patients (n = 7), female MCI 
patients (n = 11), male healthy controls (n = 6), female healthy controls 
(n = 5). The snRNA-seq dataset (GSE167494, GSE157827) of prefrontal cortex 
tissues was obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). We conducted an 
investigation into differentially expressed genes and pathways in the peripheral 
blood cells as well as prefrontal cortex tissues of both male and female AD 
patients with consideration to sex-related factors. Additionally, we analyzed 
the distribution and characteristics of cells in the cerebral cortex as well as 
the interaction and communication between cells of male and female AD patients. 
Connectivity Map (CMap) was utilized for predicting and screening potential 
sex-specific drugs for AD.
RESULTS: The transcriptome profile and associated biological processes in the 
peripheral blood of male and female AD and MCI patients exhibit discernible 
differences, including upregulation of BASP1 in AD male patients and arousing 
TNS1 in AD female patients. The distribution of various cell types in the 
prefrontal cortex tissues differs between male and female AD patients, like 
neuron and oligodendrocyte decreased and endothelial cell and astrocyte 
increased in female compared with male, while a multitude of genes exhibit 
significant differential expression. The results of cell communication analysis, 
such as collagen signaling pathway, suggest that sex disparities impact 
intercellular interactions within prefrontal cortex tissues among individuals 
with AD. By drug repositioning, several drugs, including torin-2 and YM-298198, 
might have the potential to therapeutic value of MCI or AD, while drugs like 
homoharringtonine and teniposide have potential opposite effects in different 
sexes.
CONCLUSION: The characteristics of the transcriptome in peripheral blood and 
single-cell transcriptome in the prefrontal cortex exhibit significant 
differences between male and female patients with AD, which providing a basis 
for future sex stratified treatment of AD.

This study examined the efficacy and mechanism of Polygala tenuifolia 
glycoprotein (ZPG) in alleviating Alzheimer's disease (AD) for clinical 
application. ZPG's effects were tested in scopolamine hydrobromide-induced AD 
mice using behavioral, histological, and biomarker investigations. Additionally, 
16S rDNA sequencing and lipidomics revealed ZPG's impact on gut microbiota and 
lipid metabolism, supported by pathway enrichment and correlation analyses. JNK 
pathway modulation was studied in vitro with purified and characterized ZPG-2. 
Results showed ZPG significantly improved cognitive deficits, reduced 
hippocampal pathology, and normalized APP, p-JNK, bax, and bcl-2 levels in AD 
mice. It also modulated gut microbiota and lipid metabolism, particularly 
glycerophospholipid pathways. ZPG-2 exhibited neuroprotective effects in 
Aβ25-35-induced PC12 cells by reducing apoptosis, inhibiting LDH release, and 
regulating oxidative stress and JNK activity. Structural analysis identified 
ZPG-2 as a 26 kDa glycoprotein with an O-linked glycopeptide bond and random 
coil conformation. Correlation analysis showed significant gut microbiota-AD 
biomarker relationships. These findings suggest ZPG may alleviate AD by reducing 
oxidative stress, inhibiting apoptosis, modulating gut microbiota, enhancing 
lipid metabolism, and suppressing the JNK signaling pathway. ZPG may be 
medicinal, however, more research is needed to validate its efficacy and 
mechanisms. This study lays the foundation for ZPG as an AD therapy for the 
future.

Amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tubulin-associated unit (tau) proteins are key biomarkers 
of Alzheimer's disease (AD), detectable by Positron Emission Tomography (PET) 
imaging and Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) assays. They reflect insoluble fibrils in 
the brain and soluble monomers in the cerebrospinal fluid, respectively. PET and 
CSF biomarkers have been utilized in diagnosing AD; however, their incomplete 
agreement significantly confounds the early detection. Additionally, the 
molecular mechanisms underlying the dynamics of AD biomarkers remain elusive and 
are yet to be quantitatively revealed. To answer these questions, we develop a 
multiscale mathematical model that characterizes various forms of AD biomarkers, 
including soluble molecules in cerebrospinal fluid, diffusive biomarkers across 
brain regions, and insoluble fibrils in the brain. Mathematical modeling of 
soluble and insoluble molecules enables the explanation of the asynchronous 
trajectory of AD biomarkers. Our model captures the spatiotemporal dynamics of 
Aβ and tau with neurodegeneration in AD. Simulation results demonstrate that the 
PET-CSF discordance is a typical stage in the natural history of protein 
aggregation, with CSF becoming abnormal before the onset of PET abnormality. 
Furthermore, correlation analysis reveals that neurodegeneration is more 
strongly associated with tau-PET than Aβ-PET. These findings suggest CSF Aβ is 
recognized as a biomarker at the early stage of AD, while tau-PET is more 
suitable for neurodegeneration assessment. The proposed multiscale model 
explains the underlying neurobiological factors contributing to 
neurodegeneration and offers a valuable tool for improving early detection and 
treatment strategies in clinical trials.

Tangeretin, a flavonoid from Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium, is known for its 
neuroprotective effects, but the mechanisms are not fully understood. 
Alzheimer's disease, a leading neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by 
amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulation, represents a significant therapeutic challenge. 
This study investigates the protective effects of tangeretin against 
Aβ1-42-induced neurotoxicity using HT22 cells and zebrafish larvae as 
experimental models. Tangeretin mitigated Aβ1-42-induced cytotoxicity, as 
evidenced by enhanced cell viability and reduced apoptosis. Tangeretin treatment 
mitigated Aβ1-42-induced cytotoxicity in HT22 cells, as evidenced by enhanced 
cell viability and reduced apoptosis. Mechanistically, tangeretin ameliorated 
mitochondrial dysfunction by reducing mitochondrial fragmentation, decreasing 
donut-shaped mitochondria, restoring mitochondrial membrane potential, and 
attenuating reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Moreover, tangeretin 
modulated mitochondria-lysosome interactions by promoting mitophagy and 
normalizing the prolonged mitochondria-lysosome contact induced by Aβ1-42. In 
zebrafish larvae, Aβ1-42 exposure resulted in developmental malformations, 
including pericardial and yolk sac edema, elevated ROS levels, increased 
apoptosis, and impaired neurodevelopment. Tangeretin effectively counteracted 
these deficits, as revealed by live imaging, supporting its neuroprotective role 
observed in cellular models. Collectively, our study suggests that tangeretin 
may serve as a promising protective agent against Aβ1-42-induced neurotoxicity.

Prior cross-sectional studies revealed that multiple chronic conditions (MCC) 
and polypharmacy are associated with cognitive impairment. The purpose of this 
study was to determine whether the number of chronic conditions and the number 
of medications are associated with longitudinal changes in cognition (memory, 
attention/working memory, semantic ability/language, processing speed, executive 
function). We analyzed data from 5671 individuals (age 71.4 ± 9.3, 68 % female) 
from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center database who were cognitively 
unimpaired at baseline and had 3 or more subsequent visits. 57 % had more than 
two chronic conditions, and 44 % were taking 5 or more medications at baseline. 
At baseline, we observed that individuals with MCC had lower memory, 
attention/working memory, semantic ability/language, processing speed, and 
executive function performance than those without MCC. Using mixed-effect 
modeling approaches, we found that having a higher number of chronic conditions 
was associated with greater decline in semantic ability/language and executive 
function, and having a higher number of medications was associated with greater 
decline in attention/working memory, semantic ability/language, and executive 
function. The findings suggest that healthcare professionals and service 
providers should be conscious of the fact that patients dealing with MCC and 
those on multiple medications are vulnerable and require careful monitoring. 
Future studies are warranted using more comprehensive multimorbidity data and 
advanced analytic approaches, and prospective, controlled trials are warranted 
to test whether managing MCC and reducing the number of unnecessary medications 
or certain medications can prevent decline.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of menopausal hormone 
therapy (MHT) on the risk of Alzheimer disease (AD) by examining its duration, 
initiation time, routes of administration, and formulations through systematic 
review and meta-analysis. PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and 
Scopus were searched on March 15, 2023. We selected cohort studies, case-control 
studies, and randomized controlled trials on the effect of MHT on AD in women. 
Odds ratio, relative risk, and hazard ratio were extracted. Random-effect models 
were used to estimate the polled estimates (relative risk [RR] or odds ratio 
[OR]) and their 95% confidence interval (95% CI). We included 3 randomized 
controlled trials, 12 cohort studies, and 16 case-control studies. A total of 
7,710,379 women were included. Pooled estimates showed that MHT use for 3-5 
years (cohort, RR = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.34-0.93) or initiation within 5 years of 
menopause (cohort, RR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.49-0.99) reduced the risk of AD. Oral 
administration reduced AD risk (cohort, RR = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.40-0.44). Combining 
estrogen and progesterone (case-control, OR = 1.13, 95% CI: 1.05-1.21) or 
progesterone only (case-control, OR = 1.13, 95% CI: 1.10-1.17) increases AD 
risk. Tibolone increased AD risk (cohort, RR = 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01-1.07; 
case-control, OR = 1.07, 95% CI: 1.01-1.14). MHT-protected apolipoprotein E 
genotype 4 carriers (cohort, RR = 0.13, 95% CI: 0.02-0.90), depressed 
populations (cohort, RR = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.80-0.90), and Americas (cohort, RR = 
0.54, 95% CI: 0.37-0.80; case-control, OR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.47-0.99) from AD. 
Using MHT early (within 5 years after menopause) for about 5 years may protect 
against AD. However, combining estrogen with progesterone, or using progesterone 
only, could increase AD risk. Oral MHT methods are more effective than 
transdermal ones in reducing this risk. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Menopausal 
hormone therapy (MHT) use within 5 years after menopause could offer protective 
benefits against Alzheimer disease (AD). A combination of estrogen and 
progesterone, using progesterone only or tibolone usage was connected with an 
elevated risk of AD. Oral MHT was more effective than transdermal methods in 
lowering AD risk. MHT lowered AD risk in apolipoprotein E genotype 4 allele 
carriers, individuals with depression, and Americans. MHT regimens should be 
highly personalized.

Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the 
pathological accumulation of alpha-synuclein (α-syn) in the neuronal cell bodies 
of the substantia nigra. The glymphatic system within the Central Nervous System 
(CNS) is responsible for clearing metabolic waste and abnormal proteins and its 
dysfunction may significantly contribute to the pathogenesis of PD. Our previous 
study showed that OAB-14, the novel small molecular compound, showed a great 
potential effect in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Given the similarities in the 
pathogenesis of PD and Alzheimer's disease (AD), it is pertinent to explore the 
therapeutic potential of OAB-14 in the context of PD. This study utilized a 
rotenone-induced PD mice model to evaluate the effects of oral administration of 
OAB-14, and its underlying mechanisms. Here we confirmed the neuroprotective 
effect and motor improvement of OAB-14 in rotenone-induced PD model mice. Our 
research has shown that OAB-14 is capable of enhancing the glymphatic system 
function by promoting the influx and efflux of the CSF tracers to the brain and 
deep cervical lymph nodes, respectively, to promote the clearance of α-syn. In 
addition, OAB-14 could down-regulate MyD88, NF-kB (Ser 536) phosphorylation, and 
TLR4 to reduce glial cell activation; and down-regulate cleaved-caspase1, NLRP3, 
ASC, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-18, TNF-α, and IL-10 to reduce the expression of 
inflammatory vesicles and pro-inflammatory factors, and to reduce neuronal 
oxidative stress. In summary, OAB-14 may promote the clearance of brain α-syn 
through the glial lymphatic system, inhibit the α-syn/TLR4/NF-κB/NLRP3 
inflammatory pathway, and improve movement disorders.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder marked by a 
gradual decline in memory and cognitive functions. It is characterized by the 
presence of senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuronal degeneration, 
affecting a significant portion of the human population. A key feature of 
various nervous system disorders, including AD, is extensive cellular death 
caused by apoptosis, which affects not only neurons but also glial cells. While 
apoptosis plays a vital role in eliminating certain cells and supporting normal 
development, alterations or disruptions in apoptotic pathways can lead to 
harmful neurodegenerative conditions such as AD. Thus, targeting apoptosis 
presents a promising therapeutic approach for these diseases. MicroRNAs 
(miRNAs), a class of non-coding RNA, play diverse roles in cellular functions, 
including proliferation, gene expression regulation, programmed cell death, 
intercellular communication, and angiogenesis. By modulating regulatory genes, 
miRNAs can influence apoptosis, either promoting or inhibiting it. Aberrant 
expression of miRNAs can impact multiple apoptotic pathways, potentially driving 
the progression of AD and related health issues. This review summarizes recent 
research on miRNAs and their dual role in exacerbating or protecting against 
neural cell damage in AD by altering apoptotic pathways. The regulation of 
apoptosis by miRNAs offers a prospective therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's 
disease.

Previous studies have reported a correlation between telomere length (TL) and 
Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the specific biological mechanisms supporting 
this association remain unclear. We used two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) 
to systematically explore the putative causal relationships between TL, brain 
imaging-derived phenotypes (IDPs), and AD, while further evaluating the 
mediating role of IDPs using both two-step MR and multivariable MR. In addition, 
we utilized several independent validation cohorts to repeat the analysis, 
further strengthening our inferences. The MR analysis showed that a longer TL 
was causally associated with a lower risk for AD (OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75 to 
0.93; P = 0.001). In addition, the subsequent two-step MR results indicate that 
nine brain IDPs partially mediate the effect of TL on AD. The inverse 
association of genetically predicted TL with AD was attenuated after adjusting 
for these IDPs in multivariable MR. Our study provides further evidence for the 
causal relationship between TL and AD, with IDPs potentially partially mediating 
this association. Therefore, telomere biology may be a potential pathway 
involved in AD development, and identifying the important role of telomeres can 
draw more attention to the development of telomere-related diagnostics, 
treatments, and AD therapies.

Lewy body dementia (LBD), the second most common degenerative dementia after 
Alzheimer's disease, is frequently associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms 
such as depression, anxiety, and apathy. These symptoms may precede cognitive 
decline, often resulting in misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment. 
Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has emerged as a promising option for 
treatment-resistant depression in LBD. This report describes a 68-year-old 
female patient with LBD who received multiple ECT sessions for persistent severe 
depression and suicidal ideation. ECT led to marked symptom improvement across 
several hospitalizations. This case underscores the diagnostic and therapeutic 
challenges of neuropsychiatric symptoms in LBD and highlights ECT as a potential 
alternative when pharmacotherapy is inadequate. Early identification of LBD in 
patients with late-onset depression is essential to guide individualized 
treatment strategies.

INTRODUCTION: White matter (WM) microstructure is essential for brain function 
but deteriorates with age and in neurodegenerative conditions such as 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Diffusion MRI, enhanced by advanced bi-tensor models 
accounting for free water (FW), enables in vivo quantification of WM 
microstructural differences.
METHODS: To evaluate how AD genetic risk factors affect limbic WM microstructure 
- crucial for memory and early impacted in disease - we conducted linear 
regression analyses in a cohort of 2,614 non-Hispanic White aging adults (aged 
50.12 to 100.85 years). The study evaluated 36 AD risk variants across 26 genes, 
the association between AD polygenic scores (PGSs) and WM metrics, and 
interactions with cognitive status.
RESULTS: AD PGSs, variants in TMEM106B, PTK2B, WNT3, and apolipoprotein E 
(APOE), and interactions involving MS4A6A were significantly linked to WM 
microstructure.
DISCUSSION: These findings implicate AD-related genetic factors related to 
neurodevelopment (WNT3), lipid metabolism (APOE), and inflammation (TMEM106B, 
PTK2B, MS4A6A) that contribute to alternations in WM microstructure in older 
adults.
HIGHLIGHTS: AD risk variants in TMEM106B, PTK2B, WNT3, and APOE genes showed 
distinct associations with limbic FW-corrected WM microstructure metrics. 
Interaction effects were observed between MS4A6A variants and cognitive status. 
PGS for AD was associated with higher FW content in the limbic system.

INTRODUCTION: Sexism is prevalent in academia and is a crucial factor driving 
women out of the academic workforce. However, sexism in dementia research 
remains underexplored. This study aimed to understand the perceptions and 
experiences of early-career dementia researchers (ECDRs) with sexism in the 
field.
METHODS: In September/October 2021, a global online survey was conducted 
targeting ECDRs. The survey assessed their career experiences, including sexism, 
and was distributed through networks, social media, and e-mail lists. Responses 
were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics.
RESULTS: Of the 345 respondents, more than half of the female ECDRs (52%) 
reported facing sexism in their careers, ranging from overt discrimination to 
subtle biases. Experiences varied by career stage and location, and many ECDRs 
reported a lack of institutional support.
DISCUSSION: These findings reveal the prevalent nature of sexism in dementia 
research and highlight the need for targeted interventions to foster a more 
inclusive research environment.
HIGHLIGHTS: A global survey revealed 52% of female early-career dementia 
researchers experience sexism. Subtle sexism, like microaggressions, impacts 
confidence, and collaboration choices. Experiences of sexism vary by geography, 
with North America reporting higher prevalence. Assistant professors report 
higher rates of institutional and overt sexism. Findings emphasize the need for 
policies addressing implicit bias and sex inequality.

INTRODUCTION: A subset of amyloid beta (Aβ)-positive Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
patients is tau-positron emission tomography (PET) negative. We aimed to 
characterize this subgroup using [18F]flortaucipir PET visual read (VR), as this 
is important for prognosis and selection for therapies.
METHODS: Aβ-positive VR tau-PET-negative AD dementia patients (AD A+T-) were 
compared to tau-PET-positive AD patients (AD A+T+) and control groups (CU A-T-; 
CU A+T-) included from the Amsterdam-based cohort and Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We compared [18F]flortaucipir binding in an 
early- and late-stage tau ROI, atrophy, cognition, and co-pathologies.
RESULTS: AD A+T- were older, showed less hippocampal atrophy and slower 
cognitive decline compared to AD A+T+. In ADNI, AD A+T- showed higher 
early-stage tau binding compared to both control groups and more late-stage tau 
compared to CU A-T-, but no tau accumulation over time.
DISCUSSION: VR tau-PET-negative AD patients show neurodegenerative and cognitive 
processes consistent with the AD trajectory, but milder progression compared to 
tau-PET-positive AD patients.
HIGHLIGHTS: We used the novel Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved VR 
method for defining tau-PET positivity. AD A+T- patients were older and showed 
less atrophy and cognitive decline than AD A+T+. We did not find convincing 
evidence of tau accumulation in AD A+T- or copathologies. The group of AD A+T- 
patients is likely very heterogeneous.

The ketogenic diet (KD) is a dietary intervention comprising a high-fat, 
low-carbohydrate, and moderate-protein intake designed to induce a metabolic 
state known as ketosis, whereby ketone bodies are produced as an alternative 
source of energy. Initially established as a treatment for intractable epilepsy, 
the KD has subsequently gained significant attention for its potential to manage 
neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's 
disease. Ketone bodies, such as beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), have been 
demonstrated to possess neuroprotective properties. The increasing prevalence of 
neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's 
disease, poses a significant public health challenge worldwide. With 
neurological disorders being the second-leading cause of death globally, the 
need for effective therapeutic interventions has never been more urgent. Recent 
evidence suggests that dietary interventions, particularly the ketogenic diet, 
offer promising potential in mitigating the progression of these diseases by 
influencing metabolic processes and providing neuroprotective benefits. The 
ketogenic diet, characterized by high-fat and low-carbohydrate intake, induces 
ketosis, leading to the production of ketone bodies like beta-hydroxybutyrate, 
which enhance mitochondrial efficiency, reduce oxidative stress, and modulate 
inflammatory pathways-mechanisms critical in neurodegenerative pathophysiology. 
This review explores the role of the ketogenic diet in managing neurological 
conditions, examining its mechanisms of action, historical context, and 
therapeutic efficacy. The paper also discusses emerging evidence linking the 
ketogenic diet to improved cognitive function, reduced motor symptoms, and 
enhanced mitochondrial activity in patients with neurodegenerative disorders. 
Additionally, the review highlights the need for further research to refine the 
therapeutic applications of the ketogenic diet, investigate its impact on 
various neurodegenerative diseases, and better understand its potential 
long-term effects. This study underscores the importance of nutrition as a vital 
aspect of the treatment strategy for neurological diseases, advocating for 
continued exploration of dietary interventions to improve brain health and 
function.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized 
by progressive cognitive decline, memory loss, and behavioral changes. It poses 
a significant global health challenge. AD is associated with the accumulation of 
amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the brain, along 
with chronic inflammation, dysfunctional neurons, and synapse loss. While the 
prevalence of AD continues to rise, the current FDA-approved drugs offer only 
limited effectiveness. Emerging evidence suggests that obesity, insulin 
resistance (IR), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are also implicated in AD 
pathogenesis, with epidemiological studies and animal models confirming the 
impact of IR on Aβ accumulation, and high-fat diets also exacerbating Aβ 
accumulation. Since neuroinflammation activated by Aβ involves the nuclear 
factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of the activated B cell (NF-κB) pathway, the 
inhibition of NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome activation are potential therapeutic 
strategies in AD. Bioactive compounds, including polyphenols (resveratrol, 
epigallocatechin-3-gallate, curcumin, and quercetin), and omega-3 
polyunsaturated fatty acids, show promising results in animal studies and 
clinical trials for reducing Aβ levels, improving cognition and modulating the 
signaling pathways implicated in AD. This review explores the interplay between 
obesity, IR, inflammation, and AD pathology, emphasizing the potential of 
dietary compounds and their role in reducing inflammation, oxidative stress, and 
cognitive decline, as viable strategies for AD prevention and treatment. By 
integrating epidemiological findings, observational studies, and clinical 
trials, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understating of how 
metabolic dysfunctions and bioactive compounds influence AD progression.

INTRODUCTION: Longitudinal subtypes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been 
identified based on their distinct brain atrophy trajectories, encompassing 
mediotemporal and cortical pathways. These subtypes include minimal atrophy, 
limbic predominant, limbic predominant plus, diffuse atrophy and hippocampal 
sparing. The impact of sex on the progression of these subtypes remains a 
crucial area of investigation.
METHODS: We analysed MRI data from 320 amyloid-β positive individuals with AD 
from three international cohorts (ADNI, J-ADNI and AIBL). Longitudinal 
clustering was conducted to identify atrophy trajectories over eight years from 
the clinical disease onset, with separate trajectories delineated for women and 
men.
RESULTS: Women consistently exhibited earlier hippocampal atrophy and a higher 
burden of white matter abnormalities compared to men, yet women displayed less 
cognitive decline over time. Additionally, specific risk factors and distinct 
neuropsychiatric symptoms were associated with sex within specific trajectories.
CONCLUSIONS: AD subtypes show sex-specific differences in disease progression, 
highlighting the need to account for these differences from the early disease 
stages. Integrating imaging biomarkers with sex differences can enable the 
identification of more precise treatments for each patient, ensuring that both 
women and men have equal access to tailored care.

The anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody lecanemab received the US accelerated 
approval for mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia stage of Alzheimer 
disease in January 2023, which was converted into traditional approval in June 
2023. However, its regulatory assessment in Europe is still ongoing, and the 
European Commission has asked the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use 
of the European Medicines Agency to consider an update on the safety of 
lecanemab. Thus, timely post-marketing real-life studies are essential to 
clarify its long-term safety profile and to establish relevant place in therapy. 
In this regard, a recent study by Xing et al., analyzed individual case safety 
reports (ICSRs) collected in the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event 
Reporting System (FAERS), a consolidated pharmacovigilance archive. In this 
Matters Arising article, we highlighted important methodological aspects that 
should not be overlooked by clinicians who are not fully familiar with this kind 
of study (the so-called disproportionality analysis through the case/non-case 
design), thus supporting enhanced awareness of stakeholders on interpretation, 
limitations and opportunities of FAERS data. To this end, we focused on the 
unexpected signal of pancreatic carcinoma raised by Xing et al., attempted to 
replicate the statistical findings and also provided a descriptive inspection of 
ICSRs: these are current rights and duties of modern pharmacovigilance to ensure 
evidence-based decision making.

Long-term preservation of fully differentiated human neurons poses a 
longstanding challenge in neuroscience research. Numerous cellular disease 
models have been established using cultured human neuronal cells, including our 
three-dimensional (3D) human neural cell culture model of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). However, the absence of a reliable method for preserving fully 
differentiated human neural cell cultures for a long time has hindered the 
sharing and standardization of these models. To address this critical 
limitation, we focused on cryopreservation, which is the gold standard for 
long-term preservation, and combined this with three key technological 
advancements. First, we employed parallelized microfluidic devices for the 
efficient generation of 3D cell cultures within uniform hydrogel microbeads 
(~ 220 μm), which facilitate the rapid exchange of media ingredients and 
cryoprotectants. Second, we implemented a cytophobic microwell system to 
safeguard neuron-encapsulated microbeads from fusion and aggregation. Third, we 
developed a novel inducible AD cell model optimized for cryopreservation and AD 
drug testing. We have successfully maintained encapsulated control and AD neural 
progenitor cells in microwells during differentiation for 12 days. Notably, 
fully differentiated human neural cells can be cryopreserved within Matrigel 
microbeads while retaining intact and mature neuronal processes, exhibiting no 
signs of damage to neurites following freeze/thaw cycles. Furthermore, we have 
demonstrated the successful cryopreservation, thawing, and induction of 
pathogenic Amyloid-β 42 (Aβ42) generation in fully differentiated AD neural 
progenitor cells. Our study offers a solution for one of the major challenges in 
neuroscience research, utilizing porous hydrogel microbead structures to 
facilitate rapid delivery of cryoprotectants and protect complex neuronal 
structures without undergoing damaging cell dissociation steps. The inducible 
"3D human microbead model of AD" enhances the speed, efficacy, and 
reproducibility of AD drug screening.

This study employs a bibliometric analysis to examine the evolution and future 
trajectories in epigenetic modifications in neurology from 2004 to 2024. A total 
of 12,964 publications were scrutinized via the R bibliometrix package and 
VOSviewer for network visualization, complemented by Scimagp Graphica to 
elucidate global collaborative networks. Our extensive review reveals a 
significant growth in the field of epigenetic neurology studies, driven by an 
increased output of publications and evidenced by an enhanced focus on 
epigenetic modifications. The USA and McGill University are recognized as 
central contributors, with Nature leading as the most prolific journal and J. 
Mill and E.J. Nestler distinguishing themselves as key authors by publication 
volume and citation impact, respectively. A detailed keyword analysis 
highlighted "expression," "DNA methylation," "brain," "gene-expression," and 
"gene" as the most recurrent terms, indicating core areas of research 
concentration. Subsequent manual analysis due to software-detected inaccuracies 
reaffirmed Alzheimer's disease, cancer, and schizophrenia as predominant 
neurological diseases associated with epigenetic studies. Pathophysiological 
processes such as DNA methylation, oxidative stress, and synaptic plasticity 
have been extensively examined in relation to epigenetic modifications in 
neurology. Synthesis of the reference literature analysis identifies critical 
themes such as the role of glucocorticoid receptors, the significance of 
hydroxymethylcytosine in neural DNA, the implications of epigenetic patterns in 
mental health, and the impact of BDNF gene on memory consolidation. Emerging 
technologies and underexplored areas further highlight future directions. These 
insights into epigenetic research in neurology indicate a sustained and 
intensifying trajectory, hinting at expanding horizons for future therapeutic 
approaches and interventions. Our findings underscore an active and progressing 
interest in neurological epigenetics, suggesting a continued expansion and 
specialization in the exploration of epigenetic mechanisms and their clinical 
relevance.

Increasing evidence of ocular impairments in Alzheimer's disease (AD) has drawn 
the attention of researchers worldwide towards retinal neurodegeneration in AD. 
The AD-associated changes observed in the retina include visual discrepancies, 
pupil size modulations, retinal nerve layer changes, retinal blood flow 
alterations and histopathological changes. The brain cells that act as 
pathological triggers for the progression of retinal neurodegeneration 
associated with AD are microglia, astrocytes and neurons. Various molecular 
pathways lead to structural and functional abnormalities in the retina, 
significantly affecting the brain including Aβ accumulation, apoptosis, 
inflammation and oxidative stress. Therapeutic agents under development that 
ameliorate disease conditions by targeting retinal anomalies include mesenchymal 
stem cell-conditioned media, BDNF, glatiramer acetate, salvianolic acid B, 
Lycium barbarum extract and exosomes. Investigating real-time alterations in the 
retina in AD may not only affect diagnostic approaches but also help to clarify 
neuropathological pathways and offer helpful measurements for assessing novel 
therapeutic approaches for AD.

Day care centers are medical and social facilities that provide day care for 
people over 60 with Alzheimer's or related diseases. The main aim of the study 
presented here was to assess the impact of horticultural therapy sessions on the 
well-being of users, as well as on anxiety, depression and balance. While both 
day-care professionals and users have embraced the practice, the study failed to 
show an immediate benefit on users' well-being. This may be linked to the 
methodological limitations of this first pilot study.

The study examines the impact of personalized virtual reality (VR) on mood 
disorders in elderly people with neurocognitive disorders (NCD) living in 
nursing homes and long-term care units. Twenty-seven participants were divided 
into two groups ("personalized" versus "generic") and underwent twelve immersive 
VR sessions. Results showed an improvement in mood disorders and quality of 
life, with no significant difference between groups. Future research is needed 
on the use of VR in non-drug interventions.

Age-related diseases are often associated with a disruption of RedOx balance 
that can lead to lipid peroxidation with the formation of oxysterols, especially 
those oxidized on carbon-7: 7-ketocholesterol (also known as 7-oxo-cholesterol) 
and 7β-hydroxycholesterol. Like cholesterol, these oxysterols have 27 carbons, 
they are composed of a sterane nucleus and have a hydroxyl function in position 
3. The oxysterols 7-ketocholesterol and 7β-hydroxycholesterol are mainly formed 
by cholesterol autoxidation and are biomarkers of oxidative stress. These two 
oxysterols are frequently found at increased levels in the biological fluids 
(plasma, cerebrospinal fluid), tissues and/or organs (arterial wall, retina, 
brain) of patients with age-related diseases, especially cardiovascular 
diseases, neurodegenerative diseases (mainly Alzheimer's disease), ocular 
diseases (cataract, age-related macular degeneration), and sarcopenia. Depending 
on the cell type considered, 7-ketocholesterol and 7β-hydroxycholesterol induce 
either caspase- dependent or -independent types of cell death associated with 
mitochondrial and peroxisomal dysfunctions, autophagy and oxidative stress. The 
caspase dependent type of cell death associated with oxidative stress and 
autophagy is defined as oxiapoptophagy. These two oxysterols are also inducers 
of inflammation. These biological features associated with the toxicity of 
7-ketocholesterol, and 7β-hydroxycholesterol are often observed in patients with 
age-related diseases, suggesting an involvement of these oxysterols in the 
pathophysiology of these disorders. The cytotoxic effects of 7-ketocholesterol 
and 7β-hydroxycholesterol are counteracted on different cell models by 
representative nutrients of the Mediterranean diet: ω3 and ω9 fatty acids, 
polyphenols, and tocopherols. There are also evidences, mainly in cardiovascular 
diseases, of the benefits of α-tocopherol and phenolic compounds. These in vitro 
and in vivo observations on 7-ketocholesterol and 7β-hydroxycholesterol, which 
are frequently increased in age-related diseases, reinforce the interest of 
nutritherapeutic treatments to prevent and/or cure age-related diseases 
currently without effective therapies.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing neurological disorder giving impact 
cognition and memory, posing a global health challenge with over 55 million 
individuals affected. It is the 7th foremost cause of dying worldwide, and its 
pervasiveness is expected to twofold in each five years, reaching 115 million by 
2050. AD is characterized by neurofibrillary tangles, senile plaques, and 
oxidative stress, leading to synaptic failure and cognitive decline. Currently, 
there is no cure, and available FDA-approved drugs provide only symptomatic 
relief. The disease progresses through five phases- mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI), very severe, severe, moderate and mild AD. Research on AD focuses on 
various neurodegenerative pathways, including inflammation, oxidative stress, 
genetic factors, environmental variables, and amyloid-beta accumulation. 
Existing FDA-accepted drugs, like rivastigmine, memantine, galantamine, and 
donepezil, primarily address early symptoms but have limitations, including side 
effects and high costs. In this context, phytochemicals from plants, such as 
resveratrol, huperzine, quercetin, galantamine, and rosmarinic acid, show 
promise as potential treatments for AD and overcome the challenges and 
limitation of conventional treatment. These natural substances are being 
investigated for their ability to lower the risk of AD safely. However, there is 
a lack of comprehensive knowledge about their application, necessitating further 
research and clinical trials to explore their potential benefits and 
limitations. This review serves as an essential reference for advancing future 
studies on Alzheimer's disease. By thoroughly analyzing neurodegenerative 
pathways, addressing drug limitations, and highlighting the potential of 
phytochemicals, we establish a strong foundation for developing innovative 
therapeutic strategies. Closing the knowledge gap related to the use of 
phytochemicals in Alzheimer's management is not just important; it is critical 
for creating novel and more effective treatments for this challenging 
neurological condition.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition resulting in cognitive 
impairment and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles and plaques in the 
brain. The drivers of AD's molecular progression and pathology include the 
accumulation of amyloid β protein (Aβ); thus, Aβ is an intervention target. 
However, the limitations in clinical trials of Aβ-targeted medicine and the 
failure to intervene in disease progression have raised concerns about the use 
of this drug and its veracious route. In particular, we comprehensively reviewed 
the potential effect of marine compounds and the mechanism of isolation and 
extraction from marine organisms resulting in the optimization of AD treatment. 
Furthermore, the hub compounds were docked with Beta-secretase receptors to 
strengthen the extrapolation of mechanistic interactions thus inhibiting the 
activity of an enzyme. An extensive review revealed that marine aquaculture and 
its byproducts are a promising source and isolated with green methods or less 
investment, ensuring their sustainability. MNPs harbor specific pharmacological 
features that enable them to exert neuroprotective effects by minimizing events 
such as Aβ peptide formation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by 
progressive cognitive dysfunction and memory loss. Tenuifoliside A (TFSA) is a 
constituent of RADIX POLYGALAE, a medicinal herb traditionally used in the 
clinical treatment of AD in China. However, the therapeutic mechanism of this 
compound is unknown.
AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the effects and pharmacological mechanisms of 
TFSA in ameliorating AD symptoms in APP/PS1 mice.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The neuroprotective effects of TFSA were assessed using 
behavioral tests, transmission electron microscopy, and immunofluorescence 
staining. The differential metabolites in the feces of model mice were obtained 
from non-targeted metabolomics analysis. Differential abundances of microbiota 
in the gut were investigated by 16S rRNA sequencing, and correlations among 
differential metabolites and microbiota were investigated using an integrated 
approach.
RESULTS: Cognitive impairment and Aβ burden were mitigated in APP/PS1 mice 
treated with TFSA. TFSA intervention led to an increase in the diversity of gut 
microbiota and a reduction in the relative abundance of Firmicutes, 
Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria. There were 71 differential metabolites in 
mice given high dose of TFSA. In comparison to the AD group, the mice treated 
with TFSA exhibited a notable enrichment in various pathways including glucose 
and lipid metabolism, tryptophan metabolism. Based on integrated metabolomics 
and 16S rRNA sequencing, 23 metabolite-microbiota pairs were different between 
the TFSA and AD groups, and there was an especially strong correlation between 
Alistipes and 2,3-dinor-8-epi-prostaglandin F2α. Validation experiment 
demonstrated TFSA ameliorates AD by regulating metabolism pathways and 
inhibiting neuroinflammation.
CONCLUSIONS: This study offers a theoretical basis for elucidating the molecular 
mechanism of TFSA's amelioration of AD. Although the potential pharmacological 
mechanisms of TFSA are still unknown, we have demonstrated that TFSA inhibits 
neuroinflammation and improves AD symptoms in APP/PS1 mice by remodeling the 
microbiota and its metabolites.

Illness anxiety (IA) is characterized by worry or fear in response to living 
with a chronic illness or a preoccupation with having or acquiring a serious 
disease in conjunction with absent to mild somatic symptomatology. Death anxiety 
(DA) may underpin IA and is more common in individuals with life-threatening 
illness. Treatments for DA and IA, such as psychotherapy and antidepressant 
drugs, are limited. Serotonergic psychedelic assisted therapy (PT) is a 
promising treatment alternative as it acts more rapidly than antidepressants and 
has been shown to decrease anxiety associated with life-threatening illness. 
This meta-analysis aims to systematically analyze PTs efficacy for DA and IA. A 
literature search of English language publications was conducted through the 
Ovid database using Medline®, PsychINFO®, and Embase® from date of inception to 
February 2024. Validated measures were available to assess DA. However, the 
State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was the only measure consistently available 
across studies to assess anxiety. Given the STAI State scale assesses transient 
anxiety, which may occur as a result of stressful circumstances, we employed it 
as a measure of anxiety in the context of a life-threatening illness. Five 
randomized controlled trials were included. The results showed that PT was 
associated with sustained decreases in DA and State and Trait anxiety in the 
context of having a life-threatening illness. This meta-analysis highlights PT 
as a treatment for DA and anxiety in the context of a life-threatening illness. 
Future studies should attempt to replicate these findings in other contexts, 
such as IA Disorder and somatic symptom disorders.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by a progressive decline in cognitive function and memory. This 
study explores cellular subgroups in AD using single-nucleus RNA sequencing 
(snRNA-seq). It integrates the pharmacological network of traditional Chinese 
medicine (TCM) to identify potential therapeutic targets, providing a 
theoretical basis for the development of clinical AD.
METHODS: We obtained data information from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) for 
snRNA-seq analysis. Enrichment and pseudotime analysis were performed to explore 
the functions and differentiation pathways of cellular subgroups. Cellular 
communication networks were mapped to reveal subgroup interactions. 
Additionally, a pharmacological network for AD was constructed using the TCM 
pharmacology database.
RESULTS: We identified several cell subgroups associated with AD pathology, 
contributing to disease progression in various ways. Notably, the TNC+ CD44+ 
astrocyte subgroup activated the I-kappa B kinase/ NF-κB signaling pathway, 
leading to increased expression of inflammatory cytokines. In the 
pharmacological network, fisetin was identified as a promising compound with the 
potential to bind to the CD44 protein, mitigating the inflammatory response and 
preventing further neuronal damage.
CONCLUSIONS: By exploring the ecological landscape of various cellular subgroups 
in AD and investigating the roles and mechanisms, combined with molecular 
docking and pharmacological network screening, our findings provide new insights 
and therapeutic possibilities for AD treatment.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease 
characterized by amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition, phosphorylated Tau protein 
aggregation, inflammation, and neuronal damage. Neuronal autophagy plays an 
important role in ameliorating central nervous system diseases such as AD. As an 
emerging form of iron-dependent cell death, ferroptosis has attracted great 
attention in the field of neurodegenerative diseases. Berberine (BBR), a natural 
alkaloid, has demonstrated excellent in inflammation reduction, inhibition of Aβ 
production, and neuroprotection, making it a potential candidate for AD 
treatment. However, the mechanisms of autophagy and ferroptosis in BBR treatment 
of AD have not been elucidated.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the potential of BBR in alleviating 
AD and evaluate its molecular mechanism through a combination of network 
pharmacology and biological experiments.
METHODS: We assessed alterations in Aβ plaques, neurons, neuroinflammation, and 
autophagy-related markers in the mice brain using immunofluorescence staining. 
Network pharmacology and molecular docking were used to analyze the potential 
targets and signaling pathways of BBR in the treatment of AD. Morris Water Maze 
(MWM) and new object recognition (NOR) experiments were used to test the spatial 
memory ability of mice. In addition, we validated the relationship between 
JNK-P38MAPK, autophagy, ferroptosis, and BBR treatment in 5xFAD mice and A 
β-induced SH-SY5Y cell models.
RESULTS: The results of immunofluorescence staining showed that BBR effectively 
mitigated Aβ plaque deposition, ameliorated neuronal damage and 
neuroinflammation. The autophagy-related markers Beclin1 and LC3B were 
upregulated and P62 was downregulated after BBR treatment. The expression levels 
of ROS and lipid peroxide MDA decreased significantly after BBR treatment. qPCR 
results showed that the expression levels of ferroptosis-related genes TFR1, 
ASCL4, DMT1, and IREB2 were decreased, while the expression levels of FTH1 and 
SLC7A11 increased after BBR treatment. Behavioral experiments showed that BBR 
treatment enhanced spatial memory impairment in 5xFAD mice. Network 
pharmacological and in vitro analyses demonstrated that BBR activated autophagy 
and inhibited ferroptosis by inhibiting the JNK-P38MAPK signaling pathway. 
Following treatment with an autophagy inhibitor on SH-SY5Y cells, autophagy was 
markedly suppressed, and ferroptosis was induced.
CONCLUSION: In summary, we found that BBR alleviates AD by inhibiting the 
JNK-P38MAPK pathway to enhance autophagy and inhibit ferroptosis, further 
reducing Aβ plaque deposition, inhibiting inflammatory response, and improving 
neuronal damage.

Monomeric C-reactive protein (mCRP) is a pro-inflammatory molecule generated by 
the dissociation of native CRP. Clinical and experimental studies suggest that 
mCRP deposition in the brain induces Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology and 
cognitive loss. Pathological neuroinflammation is increasingly suggested as 
relevant in AD. Innovative therapies against neuroinflammation are desperately 
needed, and inhibitors of the enzyme soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) are a 
promising new generation of anti-inflammatory drugs. Mouse primary microglia and 
BV2 cell line cultures were exposed to mCRP to analyze its pro-inflammatory 
mechanisms. sEH inhibitors, both newly synthesized UB-SCG-55 and UB-SCG-65, and 
the reference agent TPPU, were tested for their anti-inflammatory action against 
mCRP. Phenotypic changes were analyzed through cell imaging techniques, as well 
as molecular analysis of inflammatory mediators and gene activation pathways. 
Results show that mCRP triggers a pro-inflammatory response through three main 
inflammatory pathways: iNOS, NLRP3, and COX-2, followed by increased cytokine 
generation. Polarization of microglia toward a M1-like phenotype was confirmed 
by morphological analysis. Also, mCRP can bind to and cross the cell membrane, 
providing further insight into its mechanisms of action. sEH inhibitors were 
effective against mCRP induction of a reactive microglial phenotype. The 
first-line compound UB-SCG-55 emerged as the most potent anti-inflammatory 
against mCRP injury. Therefore, the direct activation of microglia by mCRP 
provides evidence of its role in triggering and exacerbating neurodegenerative 
diseases with a neuroinflammatory component, such as AD. Furthermore, the 
protection given by inhibitors of sEH confirms its potential as innovative drugs 
against deleterious effects of neuroinflammation.

High fidelity neuronal signaling is enabled by a stable local microenvironment. 
A high degree of homeostatic regulation of the brain microenvironment, and its 
separation from the variable and potentially neurotoxic contents of the blood, 
is brought about by the central nervous system barriers. Evidence from clinical 
and preclinical studies implicates brain microcirculation, cerebral 
hypoperfusion, blood-brain barrier dysfunction, and reduced amyloid clearance in 
Alzheimer pathophysiology. Studying this dysregulation is key to understanding 
Alzheimer disease (AD), identifying drug targets, developing treatment 
strategies, and improving prescribing to this vulnerable population. This review 
has 2 parts: part 1 describes the cerebral microcirculation, cerebral blood 
flow, extracellular fluid drainage, and the neurovascular unit components with 
an emphasis on the blood-brain barrier, and part 2 summarizes how each aspect is 
altered in AD. Discussing the neurovascular unit structures separately allows us 
to conclude that aberrant pericytes are an early contributor and central to 
understanding AD pathophysiology. Pericytes have multiple functions including 
maintenance of blood-brain barrier integrity and the control of capillary blood 
flow, capillary stalling, neurovascular coupling, intramural periarterial 
drainage, glia-lymphatic (glymphatic) drainage, and consequently amyloid and tau 
clearance. Pericytes are vasoactive, express cholinergic and adrenergic 
receptors, and exhibit apolipoprotein E isoform-specific transport pathways. 
Hypoperfusion in AD is linked to a pericyte-mediated response. Deficient 
endothelial cell-pericyte (PDGBB-PDGFRβ) signaling loops cause pericyte 
dysfunction, which contributes and even initiates AD degeneration. We conclude 
that pericytes are central to understanding AD pathophysiology, are an 
interesting therapeutic target in AD, and have an emerging role in regenerative 
therapy. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Dysregulation and dysfunction of the 
neurovascular unit and fluid circulation (including blood, cerebrospinal fluid, 
and interstitial fluid) occurs in Alzheimer disease. A central player is the 
aberrant pericyte. This has fundamental implications to understanding disease 
pathophysiology and the development of therapies.

Neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and macular degeneration 
represent major sources of human suffering, yet factors influencing disease 
severity remain poorly understood. Sex has been implicated as one modifying 
factor. Here, we show that female sex is a risk factor for worsened outcomes in 
a model of retinal degeneration and that this susceptibility is caused by the 
presence of female-specific sex hormones. The adverse effect of female sex 
hormones was specific to diseased retinal neurons, and depletion of these 
hormones ameliorated this phenotypic effect, while reintroduction worsened rates 
of disease in females. Transcriptional analysis of retinas showed significant 
differences between genes involved in pyroptosis, inflammatory responses, and 
endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis between males and females with 
retinal degeneration. These findings provide crucial insights into the 
pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases and how sex hormones can affect 
disease severity. These findings have far-reaching implications for clinical 
trial design and the use of hormonal therapy in females with certain 
neurodegenerative disorders.

Phosphodiesterase-2A (PDE2A) is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment 
of ganglion dysfunction-related diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, 
schizophrenia, cognitive impairment, anxiety, and depression. However, most 
current PDE2A inhibitors have moderate selectivity compared to other PDEs. In 
this study, we described the discovery of 6 novel PDE2A inhibitors by bioassays, 
molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulations. Six molecules out of 2592 
compounds from the L6000-Natural Compound Library inhibited PDE2A with affinity 
ranging from 4.03 to 39.84 μM. Selective experiments were carried out on PDE4D, 
PDE5A, PDE9A, and PDE10A, among which 5-5H and 16-2H exhibited good dual 
inhibition against both PDE2A and PDE4D. Their IC50 values for PDE2A were 4.03 
and 9.08 μM, respectively, and for PDE4D they were 3.89 and 10.96 μM, 
respectively. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation were used to 
explore the binding modes of active compounds with PDE2A. It is shown that in 
addition to the common interactions with Gln859 and Phe862 of PDE2A, 6 molecules 
formed extra hydrogen bonds with Ile826 and Leu809. These molecules may serve as 
starting points for further optimization of selective PDE2A inhibitors.

We summarize the state of the evidence on the long-term services and supports 
infrastructure to support aging-in-place. We find an extensive literature 
describing the importance of affordable medical and social services delivered in 
the home, support for family caregivers, and the role of technology for 
improving communication among patients, caregivers, and health care teams to 
support aging-in-place. We identify gaps in access to affordable services and an 
inadequate workforce prepared to support aging-in-place, raising concerns about 
meeting the future needs of our aging population. Interventions have been 
directed primarily at the individual level rather than at the system or policy 
level. Those systems-level interventions that do exist have been primarily 
within the health care sector: Little attention has been directed at developing 
holistic interventions that address multiple sectors, which reflects the lack of 
a cohesive public health delivery system for long-term services and supports 
nationally. Our findings collectively highlight the multifaceted nature of 
supports to enable aging-in-place and the necessity for future research to focus 
on drawing connections across domains of health services infrastructure.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by metabolic dysregulation, oxidative stress, amyloid-β (Aβ) 
aggregation, metal dyshomeostasis, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Current 
treatments provide only symptomatic relief, highlighting the need for novel 
therapeutic strategies. This study investigates the metabolic effects of the 
alkaloids galantamine (GAL) and lycorine (LYC) in differentiated SH-SY5Y 
neuroblastoma cells, an established in vitro model for AD, which acquire a 
neuronal phenotype upon differentiation. Using untargeted and targeted NMR-based 
metabolomics combined with multivariate statistical analysis, we analyzed 
extracellular metabolic profiles under basal conditions and following Aβ42 
exposure, both in the presence and absence of GAL and LYC. Our findings reveal 
distinct metabolic responses to Aβ toxicity, with significant alterations in 
pyruvate and glutamine metabolism. Both GAL and LYC contributed to the 
restoration of glutamine and lysine homeostasis, but LYC had a more pronounced 
effect, better sustaining cellular energy balance and mitochondrial function. 
Unlike LYC, GAL treatment was associated with pyruvate accumulation, 
highlighting a distinct metabolic response between the two compounds. These 
variations may reflect distinct mechanisms of action, potentially influencing 
their therapeutic roles in counteracting Aβ-induced toxicity. This study 
highlights the value of metabolic profiling for assessing neuroprotective agents 
and reinforces the potential of natural alkaloids in this context.

BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial dynamics is an important field in cell biology, 
encompassing mitochondrial fission and fusion. The balance between fission and 
fusion is responsible for the stability of the mitochondrial network and can be 
a regulator of mitochondrial function. Recent studies have emphasized that an 
imbalance in mitochondrial dynamics is the root cause of dysfunction and is 
involved in various stages, such as oxidative stress, inflammation and 
apoptosis. Reversing this imbalance can effectively alleviate disease 
conditions. Although the importance of mitochondrial dynamics has been widely 
recognized, there is still a lack of literature on the qualitative and 
quantitative description and analysis of advances in this field.
OBJECTIVES: This study is a bibliometric analysis of research trends, 
collaboration networks and thematic evolution in mitochondrial dynamics from 
2000 to 2023.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Using the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database, 
we performed a bibliometric review, applying VOSviewer and CiteSpace to 
visualize and analyze publications, citations, collaborations, and key word 
trends.
RESULTS: We analyzed 332 publications, identifying China and the USA as leaders 
in research output and international collaborations. Significant contributions 
were made by institutions like Chiang Mai University and the California 
Institute of Technology (Caltech), with major research shifts from basic 
mitochondrial functions to roles in diseases like Alzheimer's and cardiovascular 
disease.
CONCLUSION: Mitochondrial dynamics research has expanded, with increasing 
attention to its role in disease mechanisms. Future research should further 
explore these connections, potentially leading to innovative treatments.

BACKGROUND: As individuals experience age-related changes, such as cognitive 
decline or hospitalizations, their ability to live independently at home may be 
impacted. Decision-making and planning are essential in order to support 
successful aging-in-place (AIP), which is defined as continuing to live in one's 
home and community. Despite making plans at one single time-point, prior 
research has demonstrated that decision-making among older adults is not 
stagnant.
AIMS: The objective of this qualitative study was to understand what influences 
older adults to change their plans about AIP versus living in long-term care 
(LTC) settings.
METHODS: We analyzed a subset of the PlanYourLifespan study subjects (a 
longitudinal cohort study of community dwelling older adults) who have shown a 
fluctuation in their AIP/LTC decisions over a 6-month period and surveyed what 
influenced their decisions to change. Decisions related to support needed in the 
case of a hospitalization and Alzheimer's disease/memory loss (rehabilitation 
preferences, caregiver support, living preferences, and LTC facilities) were 
assessed. Three investigators individually coded open-ended survey responses to 
identify emerging themes using constant comparative analysis with triangulation 
of themes.
RESULTS: Of the 293 PYL study subjects, 134 expressed a change to at least one 
of their decisions. Through a qualitative analysis of survey responses, five 
overarching themes emerged that influenced fluctuating decision-making: (1) 
personal health experience, (2) health experience of a loved one, (3) increased 
contemplation, (4) social support network influences, and (5) denying change.
DISCUSSION: This study was the first to examine the factors that influence 
fluctuating AIP/LTC decision-making among older adults. The key influencers 
identified highlight the importance of ongoing discussions to revisit AIP/LTC 
planning in the case of changing or unexpected life events. Having a strong 
understanding of what influences seniors in their AIP/LTC decision-making 
processes will enable us to include these factors and people in decision-making 
discussions.

University, No. 103, Wenhua Road, Shenyang, 110016, P. R. China.

Bitter taste receptors (TAS2R) are expressed in the oral cavity, intestine, 
airways, and vascular smooth muscle, where they regulate physiological 
processes, including immune responses. However, the activation of TAS2R triggers 
signaling pathways that influence inflammation, metabolism, and cell 
proliferation, suggesting their potential as therapeutic targets for diseases 
such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, asthma, and cancer. Bitter 
compounds capable of activating TAS2R have shown potential in modulating these 
pathways, presenting novel opportunities for drug development. This review 
examines the expression of TAS2R across diverse tissues, their complex 
physiological roles, and potential therapeutic applications, including disease 
management and targeted drug delivery.

Technology School of Medicine, Guangzhou, China.

CTNND2 gene is located on the short arm of human chromosome 5 and encodes 
δ-catenin protein, which interacts with different proteins and plays different 
cell functions. Studies have demonstrated that δ-catenin plays an important role 
in regulating synaptic maturation and neuronal integrity. The CTNND2 gene is 
closely associated with a variety of neurological diseases, including 
Cri-du-Chat syndrome, Autism spectrum disorders, Alzheimer's disease, and 
Epilepsy. Furthermore, an increasing number of studies have demonstrated that 
CTNND2 is involved in various cancers and may serve as a novel biomarker for the 
diagnosis and treatment for these diseases. In this review, we will focus on the 
signaling regulatory functions of CTNND2 and its encoded protein δ-catenin in 
neuro-related diseases and cancers, and discuss the limitations of previous 
investigative studies and the challenges of the future researches on CTNND2 and 
δ-catenin signaling.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the impact of menopause for age at diagnosis (AAD) of 
glaucoma in women and illustrate its interaction with the apolipoprotein E 
(APOE) E4 allele.
DESIGN: A retrospective, case-only analysis using the UK Biobank participants 
with complete data (2006-2010) for analysis.
PARTICIPANTS: One thousand three hundred fifty-eight female glaucoma patients.
METHODS: Multivariable-adjusted associations of AAD of glaucoma, APOE E4 allele, 
age of menopause, and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) were analyzed by linear 
mixed model (LMM) analyses across groups stratified by whether glaucoma 
developed before or after menopause and whether or not HRT was used.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Age at diagnosis of glaucoma, age of menopause, APOE E4 
allele, and HRT information.
RESULTS: The age-adjusted univariate LMM showed that later menopause was 
significantly associated with an older AAD of glaucoma in both the overall 
cohort and subgroups where glaucoma developed before or after menopause (model 
1, all P < 0.05). The age-adjusted multivariate LMM found that carrying the APOE 
E4 allele combined with later menopause significantly increased the AAD of 
glaucoma in patients diagnosed before menopause (model 3: βage of 
menopause = 0.711 ± 0.074, P < 0.001; βe4 = 1.406 ± 0.596, P = 0.019; model 1 
vs. model 3: P = 0.018). No similar association was observed in patients 
diagnosed after menopause (P > 0.05). Additionally, the age-adjusted univariate 
LMM showed that HRT was associated with an older AAD of glaucoma (model 4: 
βHRT = 1.239 ± 0.368, P = 0.001), with this effect being more pronounced in 
patients with later menopause (model 5: βHRT = 1.625 ± 0.356, P < 0.001; βage of 
menopause = 0.301 ± 0.033, P < 0.001; model 4 vs. model 5: P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Later menopause was associated with an older AAD of glaucoma, with 
the APOE E4 allele providing increased protection against glaucoma in those 
diagnosed before, but not after, menopause. The protective effect of later 
menopause was also enhanced by HRT use after menopause. These findings 
underscore the interaction of hormonal status and APOE genotype in glaucoma 
onset, potentially guiding the prevention or management of glaucoma and other 
age-related health conditions in women.
