ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Kai-Xin-San (KXS) has a significant effect 
therapeutic on Alzheimer's disease (AD) in clinical practice. According to the 
compatibility theory of traditional Chinese medicine, Acori Tatarinowii Rhizoma 
(ATR) serves as the guiding drug in the KXS formulation and is believed to 
enhance the bioavailability and brain tissue distribution of the other drugs. 
However, the mechanism underlying the "guiding medicine upwards" effect of ATR 
in KXS remains unexplored.
AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study is to investigate the role of ATR in the 
efficacy of KXS on amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) mice, as 
well as its impact on the brain tissue distribution of other active ingredients 
in the KXS formula, and to elucidate the mechanism of ATR's "guiding medicine 
upwards" effect in KXS.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The pharmacodynamic effects of ATR in KXS were assessed 
through behavioral tests, immunohistochemical staining, and Nissl staining. 
Additionally, the levels of inflammatory factors, as well as the activities of 
malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase, and acetylcholinesterase, were measured 
using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. Subsequently, the effect of ATR on 
the ultrastructure of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in APP/PS1 mice was observed 
using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and the pharmacodynamic components 
of KXS in cerebrospinal fluid were quantified by ultra-high-performance liquid 
chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Furthermore, 
Western blot (WB) analysis was used to quantitatively assess the expression of 
tight junction proteins (Claudin-5, Occludin, and ZO-1) and transporters (OCT3, 
OATP2, P-gp, and MRP1) in the BBB. Finally, bEND.3 cells and astrocyte cells 
were co-cultured to validate the effect of ATR on KXS. The expressions of 
OCT3/OATP2 and P-gp/MRP1 in BBB cell model were determined by WB and the content 
of pharmacodynamic components in the lower chamber of the transwell were also 
analyzed by UPLC-MS/MS.
RESULTS: Behavioral test results suggest that KXS significantly improved the 
learning and memory capacities of APP/PS1 mice compared to the ATR-free KXS 
group. Furthermore, KXS was more effective in reducing amyloid-β protein 
deposition in the brain and repairing damaged neurons in the CA1 and CA3 regions 
than ATR-free KXS. Notably, KXS significantly reversed the pathological 
biochemical indices compared to the ATR-free KXS group. These results indicate 
that ATR has a positive effect on the pharmacodynamics of KXS in treating AD. 
Most importantly, TEM results revealed that KXS repaired the damaged BBB in AD 
mice, and ATR contributed to the improvement of BBB integrity. Furthermore, KXS 
and ATR increased the expression levels of Claudin-5, Occludin, and ZO-1 
proteins in AD mice. Meanwhile, the levels of ginsenoside Rg1, ginsenoside Rb1, 
and polygalaxanthone III in the cerebrospinal fluid of the KXS group were 1.47, 
1.39, and 2.02 times higher than those in the ATR-free KXS group, respectively. 
WB results showed that ATR and KXS significantly upregulated the expression of 
OCT3/OATP2 uptake transporters and downregulated the expression of P-gp/MRP1 
efflux transporters compared to ATR-free KXS. Concurrently, in vitro BBB cell 
experimental results suggest that ATR promoted the transport of ginsenoside Rg1, 
ginsenoside Rb1, and polygalaxanthone III across BBB cells in KXS, and the 
regulation of OCT3/OATP2 and P-gp/MRP1 expression was consistent with the in 
vivo trends observed in AD mice.
CONCLUSIONS: ATR plays a critical role in enhancing the efficacy of KXS in 
treating AD and facilitates the entry of other pharmacodynamic components into 
the brain. The mechanism underlying the "guiding medicine upwards" effect of ATR 
may involve the regulation of OCT3/OATP2 and P-gp/MRP1 transporters.

<p>Introduction: Given the elevated dementia risk in underrepresented 
demographic groups in the USA - particularly in Latino and Non-Latino Black 
individuals compared to Non-Latino White individuals - it is vital that these 
groups are well-represented in dementia prevention research. Eligibility 
criteria and recruitment strategies may play a key role in promoting participant 
diversity. The aim of this review was to examine eligibility criteria and 
recruitment strategies in US dementia prevention trials in light of participant 
diversity.
METHODS: A systematic review was conducted using Medline (including PubMed), 
Embase, Cochrane Library, and CINAHL. We explored the percent White participants 
for trials using versus not using a specific eligibility criterion or 
recruitment strategy using Hodges-Lehmann median difference estimation.
RESULTS: Of forty-four studies meeting the inclusion criteria, twenty-seven 
reported on racial/ethnic diversity. Analyses demonstrated that criteria 
regarding cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, hearing impairment, and 
sedentary lifestyle were associated with relatively high participant diversity, 
while gastro-intestinal/liver disease, motivation to participate, and language 
proficiency criteria were associated with relatively little diversity. 
Information on recruitment strategies was often lacking. Three studies described 
recruitment efforts explicitly aimed at increasing diversity. Recruitment 
strategies associated with relatively high racial/ethnic diversity included 
recruitment via referral/word-of-mouth, television/radio advertising, and 
recruitment at church.
CONCLUSION: Eligibility criteria could be improved by revisiting and revising 
how they are defined (e.g., motivation to participate). Regarding recruitment, 
several recommendations are provided, including (1) lifting barriers to study 
participation (e.g., through reimbursement), (2) collaborating with community 
partners, and (3) formally studying the effectiveness of recruitment strategies.

Human glutaminyl cyclase (hQC) has emerged as a critical target in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) due to its role in generating pyroglutamate-modified amyloid β 
(pE-Aβ). In this study, 13 compounds were designed as target compounds by 
fragment-based drug design (FBDD) and molecular docking, and subsequently 
assessed for drug-like properties and predicted inhibitory activities through 
ADMET analysis and Uni-QSAR modeling. Target compounds were synthesized via 
systematic multi-step approaches, with acceptable yields. The in vitro hQC 
enzyme inhibition assay revealed that all target compounds exhibited superior 
inhibitory activity compared to the reference compound PBD150 (140.50 ± 
0.93 nM), with compounds A3 (3.36 ± 0.90 nM), A4 (3.20 ± 1.15 nM), B1 (3.99 ± 
0.99 nM), and B2 (3.64 ± 0.98 nM) standing out for further investigation. 
Further, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were conducted on compounds A3, A4, 
B1, and B2, revealing the stability and binding interactions of the compounds 
within the hQC active site over a 200 ns simulation period. Then, the results of 
binding free energy calculations validated the superior binding affinities of 
compounds A3, A4, B1, and B2 than PBD150. These findings highlight A3, A4, B1, 
and B2 as promising hQC inhibitors, offering insights for AD drug development.

BACKGROUND: The use of unsupervised digital cognitive assessments provides 
considerable opportunities for early and comprehensive testing for Alzheimer 
disease, minimizing the demand on time and personnel resources in medical 
practices. However, the acceptance within health care has yet to be assessed.
OBJECTIVE: In this implementation study, the acceptance of an app-based, 
repeated cognitive assessment for early symptoms of Alzheimer disease in the 
outpatient care setting from both physicians' and patients' perspectives was 
examined.
METHODS: In total, 15 primary care practices participated, where patients with 
self- or relative-reported memory problems could be prescribed an app 
(neotivCare app [neotiv GmbH]) for comprehensive cognitive testing. Patients 
used the app to test their episodic memory function weekly for 12 weeks at home. 
After the testing period and the final consultation, physicians and patients 
received questionnaires to assess the app's acceptance.
RESULTS: We received completed questionnaires from physicians for 45 patients. 
In addition, we received 45 completed questionnaires from the patients 
themselves. The physicians reported that, for most patients, the app supported 
their decision-making in the diagnostic process (26/45, 58%). In addition, most 
physicians found the app's information dependable (34/45, 76%) and felt more 
certain in their decisions (38/45, 84%). From the patients' perspective, a 
majority felt thoroughly tested (34/45, 76%), and only a few considered the time 
commitment for the cognitive tests to be too burdensome (7/45, 16%). 
Furthermore, despite the weekly cognitive testing and the lengthy 12-week 
testing period, a majority of patients participated in all tests (39/54, 72%).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate a high level of acceptance by physicians and 
patients, suggesting significant potential for the implementation of 
unsupervised digital cognitive assessments into routine health care. In the 
future, acceptance should be assessed in large-scale studies, with a particular 
focus on the impact on health care delivery and patient outcomes.

Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) present a significant global 
disease burden that is only expected to grow in the future. As such, there is a 
need to develop and investigate biomarkers that identify individuals at risk of 
developing ADRD with the goal of providing early interventions and treatments. 
Non-human primate (NHP) models of neurodegeneration present opportunities to 
examine such biomarkers in a preclinical model with the ability to control 
several confounding factors present in research with humans. Baboons naturally 
develop several ADRD-related neuropathologies that humans also exhibit, 
including age-related tau and amyloid deposition. However, to our knowledge, 
there are no data characterizing fluid biomarkers relevant to neurodegeneration 
or ADRD in baboons. We collected plasma (N = 139) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, 
N = 44) from captive baboons ranging in age from 3-19 years old. We 
characterized biomarkers as a function of age, sex, and rearing status in 
baboons using a bead-based bioplex human assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific's 
Neuroscience 18-Plex Human ProcartaPlex™ Panel). Fluid biomarkers were more 
detectable in CSF compared to plasma. Additionally, while sex and rearing did 
not significantly predict biomarkers in baboons, age significantly predicted 
levels of eight of the 12 biomarkers detected in the assay. Linear regressions 
showed that CSF levels of total tau, pTau181, NGF-beta, GFAP, NF-H, and S100B 
were higher in older baboons, as were plasma levels of NGF-beta. Lastly, older 
baboons showed a higher incidence of co-occurrence of multiple biomarkers as 
measured in CSF, but not in plasma. These data show that baboons exhibit 
age-dependent changes in biomarkers used in humans for clinical screening, 
diagnosis, and prognosis of ADRD, thereby further demonstrating the value of 
baboons as a model of aging and, possibly, ADRD.

Kidney dysfunction often leads to neurological impairment, yet the complex 
kidney-brain relationship remains elusive. We employed spatial and bulk 
metabolomics to investigate a mouse model of rapid kidney failure induced by 
mouse double minute 2 (Mdm2) conditional deletion in the kidney tubules to 
interrogate kidney and brain metabolism. Pathway enrichment analysis of a 
focused plasma metabolomics panel pinpointed tryptophan metabolism as the most 
altered pathway with kidney failure. Spatial metabolomics showed toxic 
tryptophan metabolites in the kidneys and brains, revealing a connection between 
advanced kidney disease and accelerated kynurenine degradation. In particular, 
the excitotoxic metabolite quinolinic acid was localized in ependymal cells in 
the setting of kidney failure. These findings were associated with brain 
inflammation and cell death. Separate mouse models of ischemia-induced acute 
kidney injury and adenine-induced chronic kidney disease also exhibited systemic 
inflammation and accumulating toxic tryptophan metabolites. Patients with 
advanced chronic kidney disease (stage 3b-4 and stage 5) similarly demonstrated 
elevated plasma kynurenine metabolites, and quinolinic acid was uniquely 
correlated with fatigue and reduced quality of life. Overall, our study 
identifies the kynurenine pathway as a bridge between kidney decline, systemic 
inflammation, and brain toxicity, offering potential avenues for diagnosis and 
treatment of neurological issues in kidney disease.

OBJECTIVES: Alzheimer's disease (AD) results from different risk variables, such 
as metabolic syndrome (MetS) and environmental factors. The benefits of Cornus 
mas L. on diabetes are well-known. However, the impacts of C. mas fruits on AD 
or MetS-related cognitive dysfunction have not yet been studied. We evaluated 
the impact of C. mas fruit (80% ethanol) extract in an animal model of MetS and 
AD.
METHODS: Male Spraque-Dawley rats were administered a high-fat, high-sugar diet 
for 105 days alone or with an AlCl3 intraperitoneal injection for the last 60 
days. C. mas fruit extract (400, 700, and 1000 mg/kg peroral) was administered 
for 60 days. After conducting behavioral tests and measuring blood pressure, 
hippocampal tissues and serum samples were obtained. The phytochemical analyses 
were conducted on C. mas fruit extract.
RESULTS: C. mas alleviated MetS by reducing blood glucose, total cholesterol, 
and systolic blood pressure levels. Behavioral tests demonstrated that C. mas 
improves AlCl3-related cognitive decline in rats with MetS, which was supported 
by the neuroprotective effect of C. mas in histological analysis. C. mas 
dose-dependently reduced amyloid-β, malondialdehyde levels, acetylcholinesterase 
activity in the hippocampus, proinflammatory cytokines in serum, and elevated 
glutathione levels in the hippocampus. Phytochemical analyses revealed that C. 
mas fruit contains loganic acid, cornuside, and anthocyanins.
DISCUSSION: C. mas fruit extract in every three doses given could improve 
cognitive decline due to MetS and AlCl3 through alleviation of MetS, oxidative 
stress and inflammation, prevention of amyloid deposition, and increased 
cholinergic transmission.

Onobrychis Adans. species, known as 'sainfoin,' are commercially valuable plants 
cultivated to produce high-protein animal feed. In this study, the ethanol 
extract of Onobrychis buhseana Boiss., which is widely distributed in 
Azerbaijan, was subjected to silica gel column and thin-layer chromatography for 
the first time, leading to the isolation of a new natural hydroquinone oligomer, 
named buhseanol (1), along with two known compounds, β-arbutin (2) and an 
inositol derivative (3). The chemical structure of buhseanol (1) was 
characterized by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR), carbon-13 NMR, 
Attached Proton Test NMR, and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. 
Buhseanol (1), β-arbutin (2), and the ethanol extract were evaluated for their 
anti-Alzheimer's, anti-glaucoma, and anti-diabetic effects, with both the 
extract and buhseanol (1) potentially showing these activities. The inositol 
derivative (3) did not exhibit any of these activities.

Alzheimer disease (AD) is a common neurologic disorder, impairing memory and 
spatial perception. Consistent with the extensive search for its treatment, we 
investigated the effect of Picein on inhibitory avoidance memory, lipid 
peroxidation, and the activity of hippocampal antioxidant enzymes in rats. Forty 
adult male Wistar rats were randomized into control group (no intervention), 
model group (intraperitoneal injection of 3-mg/kg scopolamine), and three 
interventional groups (1.5-, 2.5-, and 5-mg/kg intraventricular Picein, once a 
day for 7 days, 24 h after scopolamine injection). After behavioral test, the 
rats' hippocampus was isolated for measuring oxidative stress markers, including 
enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione 
peroxidase (GPX), catalase (CAT), and total antioxidant capacity (TAC). One-way 
ANOVA was used for comparing numeric variables among the groups using SPSS v.21. 
The results showed scopolamine decreased SOD, GPX, and CAT enzymes, and TAC 
level, and increased MDA level, compared with the control group (P < 0.001) that 
confirmed the scopolamine-induced AD model. The two doses of 2.5- and 5-mg/kg 
Picein increased latency for entering the dark room, compared to the scopolamine 
group (P < 0.05), making them similar to the control group. The number of 
entries into the dark room in the 2.5-mg/kg Picein reduced and approached the 
control group (P < 0.05). The 2.5-mg/kg Picein decreased MDA and increased SOD, 
GPX, and TAC, more than 5 mg/kg Picein, both different than scopolamine; only 
2.5-mg/kg Picein had different CAT, compared to scopolamine group (P < 0.05). In 
conclusion, by lowering oxidative stress in the hippocampus, Picein was able to 
prevent the scopolamine-induced impaired learning and avoidance memory in rats.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The most common type of cardiac amyloidosis is transthyretin 
amyloidosis (ATTR-CM). Early forms of the disease can often go undetected. 
Effective pharmacological treatments are available for ATTR-CM. However, current 
treatment options may be more effective when used earlier in the disease, making 
early detection paramount. Below, we discuss updates with regards to the role 
that blood-based biomarkers play in detecting subclinical cardiac amyloidosis.
RECENT FINDINGS: Carriers of amyloidogenic mutations in the TTR gene are at a 
heightened risk of developing heart failure and have higher mortality rates 
compared with noncarrier counterparts. Conventional biomarkers, such as the 
cardiac troponins and natriuretic peptides, may be useful to monitor subclinical 
cardiac amyloidosis. In addition, recent studies have demonstrated links between 
amyloidogenic TTR carrier status and low levels of circulating transthyretin 
(TTR) and retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4). Laboratory advances have also 
allowed for the development of peptide-based detection methods. Probes targeting 
transthyretin aggregates and nonnative TTR peptides have shown promise in 
differentiating ATTR from non-ATTR amyloidosis populations. Finally, recent 
studies have identified neurofilament light chains as potential biomarkers for 
detecting polyneuropathy-predominant amyloidosis. Conventional biomarkers, such 
as cardiac troponin and natriuretic peptides may indicate evolving amyloid 
deposition in early ATTR-CM. However, they are non-specific and emerging 
biomarkers such as serum transthyretin levels, retinol-binding protein 4, 
transthyretin aggregates, nonnative TTR, and neurofilament light chains may hold 
promise in characterizing subclinical ATTR.

This study investigates the interaction of alkaloids of Withania somnifera with 
Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), an enzyme implicated in the 
pathology of various neurodegenerative diseases. Initially, the Withania 
somnifera phytochemicals were optimised then molecular dockings were performed. 
The molecular docking results identified key interactions between these 
alkaloids and active sites of the enzyme. Several alkaloids from Withania 
somnifera exhibited better binding affinities to GAPDH such as Withanolides G, 
I, and K with binding affinity of -10.1, -10, and - 10 kcal/mol. The binding 
orientations and stability of these withanolide derivatives complexes GAPDH were 
investigated through comprehensive molecular dynamics simulations over 100 
nanoseconds. The molecular dynamics simulations revealed stable interactions 
over the simulation period, suggesting a strong binding propensity. Furthermore, 
we determined the free energy binding profiles with GAPDH using BAR method, 
whichresulted in improved free energybinding forWithanolide-G and I.The results 
envisage that withanolides showed excellent bindings and stable interaction with 
the GAPDH, making them an effective therapeutic agent. The current study 
providesan excellent platform for developing new therapeutic agents derived from 
Withania somniferaagainst neurodegenerative diseasesassociated with GAPDH 
malfunction. These novel results open novel avenues for future research in drug 
discovery, particularly in developing novel treatments for Alzheimer's, 
Parkinson's, and other neurodegenerative diseases where GAPDH dysfunction plays 
crucial roles.Furthermore, experimental validation is required to validate the 
results of the current study.

Microglia impact brain development, homeostasis, and pathology. One important 
microglial function in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is to contain proteotoxic 
amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques. Recent studies reported the involvement of 
autophagy-related (ATG) proteins in this process. Here, we found that 
microglia-specific deletion of Atg7 in an AD mouse model impaired microglia 
coverage of Aβ plaques, increasing plaque diffusion and neurotoxicity. 
Single-cell RNA sequencing, biochemical, and immunofluorescence analyses 
revealed that Atg7 deficiency reduces unfolded protein response (UPR) while 
increasing oxidative stress. Cellular assays demonstrated that these changes 
lead to lipoperoxidation and ferroptosis of microglia. In aged mice without Aβ 
buildup, UPR reduction and increased oxidative damage induced by Atg7 deletion 
did not impact microglia numbers. We conclude that reduced UPR and increased 
oxidative stress in Atg7-deficient microglia lead to ferroptosis when exposed to 
proteotoxic stress from Aβ plaques. However, these microglia can still manage 
misfolded protein accumulation and oxidative stress as they age.

BACKGROUND: Whether the differing mechanistic effects between angiotensin-2 
receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) on 
the renin-angiotensin system translate to differential effects on clinical 
cognitive outcomes is unclear.
METHODS: We employed an active comparator, new-user cohort study to emulate a 
target trial evaluating the per-protocol effect of initiating and continuously 
adhering to an ARB versus ACEI on adjudicated amnestic mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI) and probable dementia (PD) in the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention 
Trial (SPRINT). Inverse probability of treatment and censoring weighted 
cumulative incidence functions accounted for confounding, the competing risk of 
death, adherence, and loss to follow-up.
RESULTS: Of 9,361 SPRINT participants (mean age 67.1 ± 9.5 years, 36.7% female, 
58.7% non-Hispanic White), 710 and 1,289 were new users of an ARB or ACEI. 
Overall, 291 (41.0%) ARB initiators and 854 (66.3%) ACEI initiators were 
nonadherent during follow-up. The IP-weighted 4-year probabilities of full 
adherence and being alive among ARB was 56.0% (95% CI: 52.2%-59.9%) and 30.5% 
(95% CI: 28.0%-33.1%) for ACEI. The 4-year weighted risk ratios (RR) for 
amnestic MCI/PD and for amnestic MCI/PD/death with initiation and full adherence 
to ARB versus ACEI were 0.94 (95% CI: 0.66-1.29) and 0.79 (95% CI: 0.58-1.06). 
The weighted 4-year weighted RR for all-cause death with ARB versus ACEI 
initiation and adherence was 0.36 (95% CI: 0.14-0.76).
CONCLUSIONS: In this target trial emulation of older adults at high risk for 
cardiovascular disease, there was insufficient evidence to conclude a beneficial 
effect of initiating and continuously adhering to an ARB versus ACEI on 
adjudicated clinical cognitive outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of 
anti-tau protein monoclonal antibodies for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Tau protein 
aggregation, a key pathological feature of AD, is closely associated with 
neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Targeting tau protein has emerged as a 
promising therapeutic strategy. By investigating the effects of monoclonal 
antibodies on cognitive function, disease progression, and overall quality of 
life in patients with AD, which can provide valuable insights into their 
potential as a therapeutic option for this devastating neurodegenerative 
disorder.
METHODS: The randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the efficacy of 
Gosuranemab, Semorinemab, Tilavonemab, and Zagotenemab in Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) were systematically searched across PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and 
Cochrane Library, up to May 2024. The control group included placebo. The 
efficacy indicators were change in the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), 
Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), Alzheimer's Disease 
Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-Cog), Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative 
Study-Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADCS-ADL) from baseline until the time 
of efficacy observation. Statistical analysis was conducted using Stata 14 and 
RevMan 5.4. The purpose of data processing, including generating network 
evidence plots, surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) ranking, 
league plots, and funnel plots, is to visually summarize and evaluate the 
relative effectiveness and safety and potential publication bias of multiple 
interventions. Mean differences (MD) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) as 
effect sizes to analyze continuous variables.
RESULTS: This study encompassed six RCTs involving 2,193 patients. Semorinemab 
were more effective than placebo in MMSE and ADAS-Cog scores (MDs ranging 
between 0.52 and 3.21; MDs ranging between 0.17 and 3.30). Placebo showed 
relatively good efficacy according to SUCRA ranking on change in CDR-SB and 
ADCS-ADL scores (75.7 and 79.5%). Tilavonemab and Semorinemab exhibited efficacy 
similar to that of a placebo in the analysis of the two indicators. Tilavonemab 
showed a lower incidence of AE, SAE, fall, and urinary tract infections than 
placebo, and the differences were statistically significant. Most safety 
analysis results showed no statistical difference.
CONCLUSION: The results indicated that anti-tau protein monoclonal antibodies, 
such as Semorinemab and Tilavonemab, showed promise in terms of efficacy and 
safety for managing AD. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings, 
assess long-term effects, and refine treatment protocols.

BACKGROUND: Vitamins are essential micronutrients for the prevention and 
treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. The objectives of the present study 
were to evaluate the association between dietary vitamin intake and cognitive 
function in elderly adults and to explore the potential impact of serum 
neurofilament light chain (NfL) concentration.
METHODS: Data from 468 elderly individuals, including information on the dietary 
consumption of 10 vitamins, were used. Cognitive performance was assessed 
according to a composite Z-score of the Animal Fluency Test (AFT), Consortium to 
Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD), and Digit Symbol 
Substitution Test (DSST). Serum NfL levels were measured using a highly 
sensitive immunoassay. Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) models were 
used to estimate the combined effects of vitamin mixtures on cognitive function.
RESULTS: In both single- and multiple-vitamin models, individuals with a higher 
intake of dietary vitamin K exhibited greater global cognitive function, 
compared to those with a lower vitamin intake. BKMR revealed positive 
associations between vitamin mixtures and global cognitive function, AFT 
Z-scores, and DSST Z-scores. Individuals in the third vitamin K intake tertile 
exhibited lower serum NfL levels than those in the first tertile (regression 
coefficient, β = -0.16 [95% confidence interval -0.29 to -0.02]; p = 0.023). 
Serum NfL levels mediated the association between higher vitamin K intake and 
global cognitive function (8.73%).
CONCLUSION: Vitamin mixtures were positively associated with global cognitive 
function in elderly participants. The association between vitamin K intake and 
cognitive function may be mediated by serum NfL concentration.

INTRODUCTION: The multi-targeted ligands (MTDL) strategy has been recognized as 
a promising Approach for the development of effective treatments against 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), due to the presence of multiple pathological 
mechanisms in AD. In this study, a series of bis(7)-harmine derivatives were 
designed and synthesized as multifunctional drugs for the treatment of AD.
METHODS: The derivatives were synthesized by chemical methods and their 
structure was confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The Ellman's assay 
was utilized to assess the inhibitory potential of derivatives against hAChE and 
hBuChE. The inhibitory activity of these derivatives on both hMAO-A and hMAO-B 
was assessed using a fluorescence-based method. The thioflavin T (Th-T) 
fluorescence assay was used to assess the inhibition of Aβ 1-42 
self-aggregation. The cytotoxicity was evaluated using the MTT assay. The 
Surflex-Dock program in Sybyl-X2.0 Software was employed for molecular docking.
RESULTS: In vitro studies revealed that numerous synthesized compounds exhibited 
potent inhibitory activity against hAChE, and hMAO-B (IC50 < 1 μM), as well as 
Aβ 1-42 aggregation (IC50 < 20 μM). Importantly, the multitarget compounds 6d, 
8c, and 8d exhibited remarkable efficacy in simultaneously mitigating Aβ-induced 
toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells while demonstrating minimal cytotoxicity. Furthermore, 
predicted ADMET results suggested that 6d, 8c, and 8d possessed favorable 
pharmacokinetic properties and demonstrated low toxicity levels. Additionally, 
molecular docking studies of 6d within the activesites of hAChE, hMAO-B, and Aβ 
1-42 elucidated the inhibition mechanism.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Based on these findings, it is evident that 6d, 8c, 
and 8d hold potential as promising multi-functional drugs for AD treatment.

Late-onset epilepsy has been linked with accelerated cognitive decline and a 
higher risk of dementia. In this study, we sought to characterize the cognitive 
profile of participants with late-onset unexplained epilepsy and compare their 
MRI findings to healthy controls, to better understand underlying disease 
mechanisms. We recruited participants with at least one new-onset unexplained 
seizure at age 55 or later, without cortical lesions on MRI, within 5 years of 
the first seizure. We administered a neuropsychological battery to generate 
Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite and composite scores for delayed 
verbal recall, processing speed and executive function. We held a consensus 
meeting to determine whether the participants fulfilled criteria for mild 
cognitive impairment. An MRI volumetric analysis of hippocampal, amygdalae, and 
white matter hyperintensity volume was performed and compared to 353 healthy 
controls from the Harvard Aging Brain Study. On late-onset unexplained epilepsy 
participants, we also obtained 24-h EEG recording. Seventy participants were 
recruited, mean age 71.0 ± 7.0 years, 49% female, 15.6 ± 3.0 years of education. 
Impaired cognition (z-score ≤ -1.5) for late-onset unexplained epilepsy included 
the following: 15.9% for Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite -5, 23.2% for 
delayed verbal recall, 15.6% for processing speed and 7.5% for executive 
function. Seventeen percent were found to have mild cognitive impairment. 
Late-onset unexplained epilepsy participants who were drug resistant were more 
likely to have cognitive impairment (50% vs. 9%). When controlling for age, sex 
and race, late-onset unexplained epilepsy group had lower left AV (%; β = 
-0.003, P = 0.0016), right AV (%) (β = -0.003, P = 0.01), and log-transformed 
WMV (mm3; β = -0.21, P = 0.03) compared with Harvard Aging Brain Study (HABS); 
there were no differences in left or right HV between groups. EEG captured 
epileptiform abnormalities in 49% late-onset unexplained epilepsy participants, 
with a left temporal predominance (54%). In this single-site study of 
prospectively enrolled participants with late-onset unexplained epilepsy, we 
show that individuals with late-onset unexplained epilepsy exhibit cognitive 
impairments, mostly in verbal memory, and temporal dysfunction with left-sided 
predominance. Neuroimaging, when compared with healthy controls, shows lower 
amygdalae and white matter hyperintensity but not hippocampal volumes suggesting 
that the amygdalae is one of the earliest sites involved in the disease. The 
results also highlight the importance of seizure control given the association 
between mild cognitive impairment and drug-resistant epilepsy. Future studies 
extending these findings to Alzheimer's disease biomarkers and longitudinal 
follow-up will inform predictors of cognitive decline.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common diseases of the central 
nervous system in the middle-aged and elderly population. It is a 
neurodegenerative disorder, and its main clinical symptoms include the loss of 
established memories, a decline in learning capacity, and the buildup of 
β-amyloid peptides. The disease is often accompanied by neurodegenerative 
changes and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles. However, the number of 
drugs available for the clinical treatment of AD remains limited. Currently, 
existing medications are not effective in completely curing the disease or 
stopping its progression. Due to their excellent biocompatibility and 
biodegradability, polymers have been widely used as drug delivery carriers in 
various fields including cancer therapy and wound healing. The use of polymers 
enables targeted drug delivery and prolonged release profiles. In recent years, 
researchers have made significant progress in utilizing polymers such as 
polyethylene glycol, poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), and chitosan (CS) to 
deliver drugs and blood-brain barrier receptor ligands for the treatment of AD. 
Moreover, many polymers with inherent therapeutic properties have been 
developed, including the already marketed GV-971 as well as experimental 
polymers such as PLGA and CS oligosaccharide. This review summarizes the 
applications of polymers in AD treatment over the past few years and highlights 
their current limitations to help researchers better understand current 
advancements in polymer development and identify future research directions.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), the leading cause of dementia, poses a growing global 
health challenge due to an aging population. Early and accurate diagnosis is 
essential for optimizing treatment and management, yet traditional diagnostic 
methods often fall short in addressing the complexity of AD pathology. Recent 
advancements in radiomics and artificial intelligence (AI) offer novel solutions 
by integrating quantitative imaging features and machine learning algorithms to 
enhance diagnostic and prognostic precision. This review explores the 
application of radiomics and AI in AD, focusing on key imaging modalities such 
as PET and MRI, as well as multimodal approaches combining structural and 
functional data. We discuss the potential of these technologies to identify 
disease-specific biomarkers, predict disease progression, and guide personalized 
interventions. Additionally, the review addresses critical challenges, including 
data standardization, model interpretability, and the integration of AI into 
clinical workflows. By highlighting current achievements and identifying future 
directions, this article underscores the transformative potential of AI-driven 
radiomics in reshaping AD diagnostics and care.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Dementia often accompanies behavioral and psychological 
symptoms of dementia (BPSD), including agitation, aggression, depression, and 
psychosis, which impact patients' quality of life and caregiver burden. 
Effective management of BPSD is essential to support patient and caregiver 
well-being. This study presents evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for 
pharmacological treatments of BPSD in dementia, focusing on antipsychotics, 
antidepressants, cognitive enhancers, and other medications.
METHODS: This guideline was developed by the Korean Dementia Association's 
Quality Management Committee. Key questions were framed using the Population, 
Intervention, Comparison, Outcome methodology, followed by systematic literature 
searches. Randomized controlled trials were assessed for quality, and 
recommendations were graded based on evidence levels, employing the Grading of 
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation system to establish 
strength and applicability.
RESULTS: Recommendations vary by medication type and symptom severity. 
Antipsychotics, such as risperidone, are conditionally recommended for managing 
aggression and psychosis in dementia, while antidepressants, specifically 
citalopram, are advised for agitation in Alzheimer's disease. Cognitive 
enhancers, including cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine, showed moderate 
efficacy for general BPSD improvement and rapid eye movement sleep behavior 
disorder in Lewy body dementia. Specific drugs, like pimavanserin, demonstrated 
efficacy in addressing psychosis in Alzheimer's patients.
CONCLUSIONS: These guidelines provide a structured approach to pharmacological 
management of BPSD in dementia, addressing efficacy and safety profiles across 
drug categories. The recommendations emphasize personalized treatment plans to 
optimize therapeutic outcomes while minimizing risks, with a conditional 
approach suggested in cases with limited evidence.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This clinical practice guideline provides evidence-based 
recommendations for treatment of dementia, focusing on cholinesterase inhibitors 
and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists for Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) and other types of dementia.
METHODS: Using the Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes (PICO) 
framework, we developed key clinical questions and conducted systematic 
literature reviews. A multidisciplinary panel of experts, organized by the 
Korean Dementia Association, evaluated randomized controlled trials and 
observational studies. Recommendations were graded for evidence quality and 
strength using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and 
Evaluation (GRADE) methodology.
RESULTS: Three main recommendations are presented: (1) For AD, cholinesterase 
inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine) are strongly recommended for 
improving cognition and daily function based on moderate evidence; (2) 
Cholinesterase inhibitors are conditionally recommended for vascular dementia 
and Parkinson's disease dementia, with a strong recommendation for Lewy body 
dementia; (3) For moderate to severe AD, NMDA receptor antagonist (memantine) is 
strongly recommended, demonstrating significant cognitive and functional 
improvements. Both drug classes showed favorable safety profiles with manageable 
side effects.
CONCLUSIONS: This guideline offers standardized, evidence-based pharmacologic 
recommendations for dementia management, with specific guidance on 
cholinesterase inhibitors and NMDA receptor antagonists. It aims to support 
clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes in dementia care. Further 
updates will address emerging treatments, including amyloid-targeting therapies, 
to reflect advances in dementia management.

Xanthohumol (XN), a bioactive plant flavonoid, is an antioxidant, and as such, 
it exhibits numerous beneficial properties, including anti-inflammatory, 
antimicrobial, and antioxidative effects. The main dietary source of XN is beer, 
where it is introduced through hops. Although the concentration of XN in beer is 
low, the large quantities of hop-related post-production waste present an 
opportunity to extract XN residues for technological or pharmaceutical purposes. 
The presented study focuses on the role of XN in the prevention of 
neurodegenerative diseases, analyzing its effect at a molecular level and 
including its signal transduction and metabolism. The paper brings up XN's 
mechanism of action, potential effects, and experimental and clinical studies on 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis (ALS). Additionally, challenges and future research directions on XN, 
including its bioavailability, safety, and tolerance, have been discussed.

Methionine aminopeptidase 2 (MetAP2) plays an important role in the regulation 
of protein synthesis and post-translational processing. Preclinical/clinical 
applications of MetAP2 inhibitors for the treatment of various diseases have 
been explored because of their antiangiogenic, anticancer, antiobesity, 
antidiabetic, and immunosuppressive properties. However, the effects of MetAP2 
inhibitors on CNS diseases are rarely examined despite the abundant presence of 
MetAP2 in the brain. Previously, we synthesized a novel boron-containing MetAP2 
inhibitor, BL6, and found that it suppressed angiogenesis and adipogenesis yet 
improved glucose uptake. Here, we studied the anti-inflammatory effects of BL6 
in SIM-A9 microglia and in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease generated by the 
intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of streptozotocin (STZ). We found that 
BL6 reduced proinflammatory molecules, such as nitric oxide, iNOS, IL-1β, and 
IL-6, together with phospho-Akt and phospho-NF-κB p65, which were elevated in 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated microglial SIM-A9 cells. However, the 
LPS-induced reduction in Arg-1 and CD206 was attenuated by BL6, suggesting that 
BL6 promotes microglial M1 to M2 polarization. BL6 also decreased glial 
activation along with a reduction in phospho-tau and an elevation in 
synaptophysin in the icv-STZ mouse model. Thus, our experiments demonstrate an 
anti-neuroinflammatory action of BL6, suggesting possible clinical applications 
of MetAP2 inhibitors for brain disorders in which neuroinflammation is involved.

Quinazoline, a privileged scaffold in medicinal chemistry, offers promising 
potential in the synthesis of anti-Alzheimer's disease (AD) drugs. This 
heterocyclic compound, characterized by its fused benzene and pyrimidine rings, 
enables the design of multifunctional agents targeting AD pathology. The 
drug-like aspects and pharmaceutical features of quinazoline derivatives have 
the potential to give rise to various therapeutic drugs. AD is a progressive 
neurodegenerative condition marked by memory decline, cognitive deterioration, 
and language disorders. Given its complexity and multifaceted nature, there is a 
pressing need to discover multi-target drugs to effectively address this 
debilitating disorder. A comprehensive literature review has demonstrated that 
quinazoline derivatives exhibit a wide range of therapeutic potential for AD. 
These compounds function as inhibitors of cholinesterases, β-amyloid 
aggregation, oxidative stress, and tau protein, among other protective effects. 
Here, we highlight the most significant and recent research on quinazoline-based 
anti-AD agents, aiming to support the development and discovery of novel 
treatments for AD.

loaded with the dihydropyridine calcium antagonist drug Nimodipine (NIMO). 
Although NIMO is used to treat stroke, migraine, Alzheimer's disease, 
cerebrovascular spasms, and hypertension, this drug is poorly water-soluble, 
with low bioavailability and lack of selectivity. Thus, there is an urgent need 
for a novel approach to creating NIMO formulations that are safe, effective, and 
have better solubility and bioavailability. To overcome these problems, we 
develop a cationic biopolymer functionalized MoS2 nanosheets as a photothermal 
drug carrier system to facilitate the NIR light-induced release of NIMO drugs. 
MoS2 nanosheets (<150 nm) as NIMO drug carriers are prepared through simple 
exfoliation of their bulk phase and then functionalized with CHIT-SH biopolymer 
to increase their physiological stability and biocompatibility. According to the 
results, MoS2-NIMO-CHIT-SH nanocomposites show strong NIR absorbance, which 
makes them a promising candidate for photothermal therapy.

The accumulation of D-amino acid-containing peptides is associated with 
age-related diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and cataracts, while 
glycosylation is an important modification of proteins and plays a key role in 
improving the physicochemical properties of peptides and facilitating their 
regulation in biological systems. This study investigates the effects of 
glycosylation position, glycan number, and monosaccharide structure on the 
conformation and enzymatic degradation of D-amino acid-containing peptides, 
using KYNEtWRSED (5-t) as a model peptide and six monosaccharides as model 
glycans. The results demonstrated that glycosylation inhibited the enzymatic 
degradation of 5-t in the presence of most serine-like proteases. However, in 
the presence of chymotrypsin, glycosylation with modified monosaccharides 
(except for β-D-GalNAc) promoted the degradation of 5-t. Furthermore, 
glycosylation had no effect on the cleavage site of 5-t. Molecular docking 
analysis revealed that the hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions 
between the glycopeptide and chymotrypsin were markedly strengthened, likely 
serving as a key determinant of the enzymatic effects. Collectively, these 
findings highlight the potential of glycosylation to enhance the therapeutic and 
biomedical applications of D-amino acid-containing peptides in disease treatment 
and drug design.

Selenium (Se) is an essential trace element crucial for human health that 
primarily functions as an immunonutrient. It is incorporated into polypeptides 
such as selenocysteine (SeC) and selenomethionine (SeMet), two key amino acids 
involved in various biochemical processes. All living organisms can convert 
inorganic Se into biologically active organic forms, with SeMet being the 
predominant form and a precursor for SeC production in humans and animals. The 
human genome encodes 25 selenoprotein genes, which incorporate 
low-molecular-weight Se compounds in the form of SeC. Organic Se, especially in 
the form of selenoproteins, is more efficiently absorbed than inorganic Se, 
driving the demand for selenoprotein-based health products, such as functional 
foods. Se-enriched functional foods offer a practical means of delivering 
bioavailable Se and are associated with enhanced antioxidant properties and 
various health benefits. Recent advancements in selenoprotein synthesis have 
improved our understanding of their roles in antioxidant defense, cancer 
prevention, immune regulation, anti-inflammation, hypoglycemia, cardiovascular 
health, Alzheimer's disease, fertility, and COVID-19. This review highlights key 
selenoproteins and their biological functions, biosynthetic pathways, and 
emerging applications while highlighting the need for further research.

The Brain Toxin Cleansing of Sleep Achieved During Wakefulness.

Arendash GW(1).

Author information:
(1)RF Longevity, 428 E. Thunderbird Rd., Suite 431, Phoenix, AZ 85022, USA.

A primary purpose of sleep for humans is to remove toxins and metabolic wastes 
from the brain (e.g., Aβ, tau, lactate) that would otherwise build up and 
compromise brain functionality. There are currently no drugs or devices that 
have been clinically shown in humans to enhance brain toxin removal, either 
during sleep or wakefulness. This perspective article focuses on a recently 
(re)discovered major route of toxin drainage from the human brain through 
meningeal lymphatic vessels (mLVs) and the primary enhancer of their flow-the 
cytokine Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF). The purpose of this 
perspective article is to present pre-clinical and clinical evidence relevant to 
a new bioengineered technology (Transcranial Radiofrequency Treatment; TRFT) 
that appears to enhance mLV flow to increase brain toxin cleansing in humans 
during wakefulness. In being both safe and non-invasive, TRFT is administered 
in-home, presently through a device called "MemorEM". Two months of daily TRFT 
during wakefulness increased the typically low plasma/brain levels of VEGF in 
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) subjects, which was associated with increased Aβ and 
tau toxin removal from their brains during wakefulness-ostensibly through 
VEGF-increased mLV flow. Even irrespective of baseline VEGF levels, brain toxin 
cleansing was increased by TRFT in AD subjects, who also experienced a notable 
reversal of their cognitive impairment after TRFT. Additional clinical studies 
are nonetheless required to firmly establish TRFT's brain cleansing abilities 
during wakefulness. In performing a major duty of sleep, TRFT during wakefulness 
is proposed as a viable intervention to counter the decline in nighttime brain 
toxin cleansing that occurs with aging and in multiple brain diseases, most 
notably Alzheimer's Disease. The implications of TRFT for insomnia and for sleep 
deprivation are also discussed, as is the potential for TRFT to extend healthy 
human longevity.

Due to a continuous increase in life expectancy and the progress made in 
specialized healthcare, the incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has 
dramatically increased to the point that it has become one of the main 
challenges of contemporary medicine. Despite a huge scientific and clinical 
effort, current treatments manage just a temporary alleviation of symptomatology 
but offer no cure. Modern trials involving cell transplantation in experimental 
animals require the involvement of neurosurgeons in the treatment protocol. CSF 
shunting, intraventricular infusions, or DBS for symptoms relief have been an 
integral part of the therapeutic arsenal from the very beginning. The 
development of stereotactic surgery has facilitated the experimental potential 
of cell transplantation in the hippocampus for Alzheimer's disease. We conducted 
a narrative review of the literature in the top three medical databases (PubMed, 
Science Direct, and Google Scholar) using the keywords "Alzheimer's disease", 
"hippocampus", and "transplant". After eliminating duplicates, 241 papers were 
selected and screened by title and abstract. Two reviewers independently 
analyzed the 88 papers and chose 32 experiments that involved stereotactic 
hippocampal transplantation of cells in experimental animals with AD. The 
stereotactic transplantation of cells such as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), 
neuronal stem cells (NSCs), induced pluripotent cells (iPSCs), astrocytes, and 
derivates from stem cells was analyzed. The experiments used either a chemically 
induced or transgenic AD model and observed the impact of the stereotactic 
transplantation with behavioral testing, MRS spectroscopy, and biochemical 
analysis. The stereotaxic method delivers minimal invasive treatment option by 
cell transplantation at the hippocampus. The results showed that amyloid 
deposits were lower after transplantation, showing a positive impact. Other 
impactful results involve proliferation of neurogenesis, downregulation of 
anti-inflammatory response, and increased neuronal plasticity. The increased 
precision with which the stereotaxic method manages to target deep structures of 
the brain and the results of the reviewed papers could represent an argument for 
future human trials. More studies are needed to confirm the viability of the 
transplanted cells and the long-term effects.

Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition that has 
no definitive treatment, and its early diagnosis can help to prevent or slow 
down its progress. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) and the progress 
of artificial intelligence (AI) have significant attention in AD detection. This 
study aims to differentiate AD from NC and distinguish between LMCI and EMCI 
from the other two classes. Another goal is the diagnostic performance (accuracy 
and AUC) of sMRI for predicting AD in its early stages. Methods: In this study, 
398 participants were used from the ADNI and OASIS global database of sMRI 
including 98 individuals with AD, 102 with early mild cognitive impairment 
(EMCI), 98 with late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI), and 100 normal controls 
(NC). Results: The proposed model achieved high area under the curve (AUC) 
values and an accuracy of 99.7%, which is very remarkable for all four classes: 
NC vs. AD: AUC = [0.985], EMCI vs. NC: AUC = [0.961], LMCI vs. NC: AUC = 
[0.951], LMCI vs. AD: AUC = [0.989], and EMCI vs. LMCI: AUC = [1.000]. 
Conclusions: The results reveal that this model incorporates DenseNet169, 
transfer learning, and class decomposition to classify AD stages, particularly 
in differentiating EMCI from LMCI. The proposed model performs well with high 
accuracy and area under the curve for AD diagnostics at early stages. In 
addition, the accurate diagnosis of EMCI and LMCI can lead to early prediction 
of AD or prevention and slowing down of AD before its progress.

Background/Objectives: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive 
brain atrophy marked by cognitive decline and memory loss, which significantly 
affect patients' quality of life. Transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) is a 
potential physical treatment for AD patients. However, the specific brain 
regions stimulated by TUS and its therapeutic effects remain unclear. Methods: 
In this study, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and FreeSurfer segmentation were 
employed to assess alterations in the brain volume of AD patients after TUS. 
Results: Our findings revealed significant volume increases in the corpus 
callosum (CC) and lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC) in the TUS group. 
Moreover, the volumetric changes in the CC were strongly correlated with 
improvements in the Mini-Mental State Examination score, which is a widely used 
measure of cognitive function of AD patients. Conclusions: TUS has the potential 
to alleviate disease progression and offers a non-invasive therapeutic approach 
to the improvement of cognitive function in AD patients.

The role of 11β-HSD1 in Alzheimer's disease (AD) has garnered significant 
attention due to its involvement in glucocorticoid metabolism, 
neuroinflammation, and cognitive decline. This review explores the current 
understanding of 11β-HSD1 in AD, examining genetic, preclinical, and clinical 
research. Genetic studies have identified 11β-HSD1 polymorphisms that may 
influence AD risk, although findings remain inconsistent. Mechanistically, 
11β-HSD1 promotes neurodegeneration through the dysregulation of glucocorticoid 
activity, contributing to hippocampal atrophy, amyloid plaque formation, and tau 
pathology. Preclinical studies have shown that 11β-HSD1 inhibitors offer 
neuroprotective effects, including enhanced cognitive function, reduced 
inflammation, and improved mitochondrial activity. However, clinical trials, 
including those involving ABT-384 and Xanamem, have produced mixed results, with 
no substantial cognitive improvements despite effective enzyme inhibition. These 
inconsistencies highlight the complexity of AD and the challenges in translating 
preclinical findings into clinical outcomes. Moreover, while 11β-HSD1 inhibition 
holds therapeutic potential, other strategies targeting neuroinflammation, 
autophagy, and glucocorticoid signaling are also being explored. Ongoing 
research is focusing on optimizing 11β-HSD1 inhibitors, identifying biomarkers 
for patient selection, and investigating combination therapies to enhance 
treatment efficacy. Ultimately, 11β-HSD1's role in AD presents a promising 
therapeutic target, but further studies are required to fully understand its 
potential in managing the disease.

Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease 
(PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and multiple sclerosis (MS), which 
are a consequence of the progressive loss of neuronal function and structure, 
cause significant cognitive impairment. The incidence of these diseases in the 
world's population is constantly increasing as a result of an aging population. 
Although genetic and environmental factors are most often mentioned as the 
pathogenetic factors of these diseases, increasing evidence points to the 
important role of proper nutrition in the prevention and support of the 
treatment of these disorders. A healthy, balanced diet can mitigate the risks 
associated with the risk factors mentioned above and slow the progression of the 
disease by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. Vitamins B, D, E, C, K, 
and A have been shown to support cognitive functions and protect the nervous 
system. This review demonstrates the importance of vitamins in preventing and 
supporting the therapy of neurodegenerative diseases. Information regarding the 
health-promoting properties of these vitamins must be effectively communicated 
to consumers seeking to protect their health, particularly in the context of 
neurodegenerative diseases. Consequently, this review also examines the 
authorized health claims under EU food law related to these vitamins, assessing 
their role in promoting awareness of the vitamins' potential benefits for 
neuroprotection and the management of neurodegenerative diseases.

The complexity of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology represents a 
significant challenge in the development of effective therapeutic agents for its 
treatment. CNEURO-201 (CN, also Amylovis-201) is a novel pharmaceutical agent 
with dual activity as an anti-amyloid-β (Aβ) agent and σ1 receptor agonist. CN 
exhibits great efficacy at very low doses, delaying cognitive impairment and 
alleviating Aβ load in animal models of AD. However, CN functions on other 
remains related to this pathology remain to be investigated. The present study 
sought to evaluate the effects of CN treatment at a dosage of 0.1 mg kg-1 (p.o) 
over an eight-week period in the 3xTg-AD mouse model. In silico studies, as well 
as biochemical and immunofluorescence assays, were conducted on brain tissue to 
investigate the CN effects on acetylcholine metabolism, redox system, and glial 
cell activation-related biomarkers in brain regions that are relevant for 
memory. The results demonstrated that CN effectively rescues cognitive 
impairment of 3xTg-AD mice by influencing glial activity to reduce existing Aβ 
plaques but also modulating acetylcholine metabolism and the enzymatic response 
of proteins involved in the redox system. Our outcomes reinforced the potential 
of CN in treating AD by acting on multiple pathways altered in this disease.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a significant health challenge in the 21st century. 
In spite of the approval of many new disease-modifying therapies for AD, the 
clinical advantages of these new treatments are less certain.
AIM: This investigation was intended to determine the potential neuroprotective 
impact of morin hydrate (MH), zeolite clinoptilolite (ZC), and/or physical and 
mental activities (PhM) on an aluminum chloride (AlCl3)-induced AD rat model.
METHODS: Male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly allocated into seven groups. 
Group I was the control group. Groups II-VII were treated with AlCl3 for 5 
weeks. Groups III-VII were tested for the effects of MH, ZC, and/or PhM. 
Biochemical, brain histopathological, and behavioral studies were performed.
RESULTS: PhM, MH, and ZC combined therapy exhibited a significant 
neuroprotective effect demonstrated by corrected catecholamines and tau and 
β-amyloid levels, as well as the antioxidant and anti-ferroptotic effects 
probably through Nrf2/HO-1/GPX4 and ACSL4 signaling pathways. In addition, 
combined therapy counteracted the inflammatory responses through modulating the 
TLR4/NF-κβ/NLRP3 inflammasome expression. Moreover, combined therapy groups 
showed the maximum improvement of both APOE4/LRP1 and Wnt3/β-catenin/GSK-3β 
signaling expressions.
CONCLUSION: This research highlights the neuroprotective impact of MH and ZC 
plus PhM against AlCl3-induced AD via modulation of Nrf2/HO-1/GPX4, 
TLR4/NF-κβ/NLRP3, APOE4/LRP1, and Wnt3/β-catenin/GSK-3β signaling pathways. It 
is the first to point out the inclusion of ferroptosis-Nrf2/inflammasomes 
cross-talk in the neuroprotection mechanism of MH/ZC against the AlCl3-mediated 
AD model.

Light-Sheet Fluorescence Imaging Reveals Three-Dimensional Amyloid Burden 
Reduction Following Five Weeks of Swimming Exercise in Alzheimer's Mouse.

Emerging evidence from observational studies suggests that lifestyle 
modifications, particularly moderate-intensity exercise, may confer 
neuroprotective benefits against dementia, potentially by enhancing brain 
resistance through clearance mechanisms. Using light-sheet fluorescence 
microscopy (LSFM) with tissue clearing, we investigated the role of voluntary 
swimming in ameliorating β-amyloid pathology in a transgenic Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) mouse model. Twenty 52-week-old hAPPsw mice were randomly divided into a 
5-week voluntary swimming intervention group and a control group (each n = 10). 
Each session included a 10-min swim followed by a 10-min rest, escalating from 
one session per day in the first week to three sessions per day by the fifth 
week. The excised brains were prepared using tissue-clearing and volume 
immunostaining with thioflavin-S for β-amyloid. For LSFM imaging, the individual 
plaque area and volume, total plaque load, and morphological parameters were 
quantified via an Imaris-based three-dimensional (3D) volumetric surface model. 
Visual comparison revealed that the intervention group presented significantly 
lower β-amyloid accumulation. The total surface volume of β-amyloid accumulation 
in the intervention group was significantly lower than that of the control group 
(intervention, 122,180,948 μm3 [105,854,660-169,063,081]; control, 167,201,016 
μm3 [139,367,765-193,535,450]; p = 0.043). There were no significant differences 
in the morphological parameters, such as ellipticity and sphericity. Our LSFM 
study demonstrated notable reductions in β-amyloid, as evidenced by a decrease 
in total surface volume, in 52-week-old transgenic mice after a 5-week 
structured swimming program, supporting the notion that even in advanced AD 
stages, leisure-time voluntary swimming serves as an efficacious intervention 
for augmenting resistance to pathology.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common and severe forms of dementia 
and neurodegenerative disease. As life expectancy increases in line with 
developments in medicine, the elderly population is projected to increase in the 
next few decades; therefore, an increase in the prevalence of some diseases, 
such as AD, is also expected. As a result, until a radical treatment becomes 
available, AD is expected to be more frequently recorded as one of the top 
causes of death worldwide. Given the current lack of a cure for AD, and the only 
treatments available being ones that alleviate major symptoms, the 
identification of contributing factors that influence disease incidence is 
crucial. In this context, genetic and/or epigenetic factors, mainly 
environmental, disease-related, dietary, or combinations/interactions of these 
factors, are assessed. In this review, we conducted a literature search focusing 
on environmental factors such as air pollution, toxic elements, pesticides, and 
infectious agents, as well as dietary factors including various diets, vitamin D 
deficiency, social factors (e.g., tobacco and alcohol use), and variables that 
are affected by both environmental and genetic factors, such as dietary behavior 
and gut microbiota. We also evaluated studies on the beneficial effects of 
antibiotics and diets, such as the Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for 
Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) and Mediterranean diets.

Nuclear receptors (NRs) are ligand-activated transcription factors that regulate 
a broad array of biological processes, including inflammation, lipid metabolism, 
cell proliferation, and apoptosis. Among the diverse family of NRs, peroxisome 
proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), estrogen receptor (ER), liver X 
receptor (LXR), farnesoid X receptor (FXR), retinoid X receptor (RXR), and aryl 
hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) have garnered significant attention for their roles 
in neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD). NRs 
influence the pathophysiology of AD through mechanisms such as modulation of 
amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition, regulation of inflammatory pathways, and 
improvement of neuronal function. However, the dual role of NRs in AD 
progression, where some receptors may exacerbate the disease while others offer 
therapeutic potential, presents a critical challenge for their application in AD 
treatment. This review explores the functional diversity of NRs, highlighting 
their involvement in AD-related processes and discussing the therapeutic 
prospects of NR-targeting strategies. Furthermore, the key challenges, including 
the necessity for the precise identification of beneficial NRs, detailed 
structural analysis through molecular dynamics simulations, and further 
investigation of NR mechanisms in AD, such as tau pathology and autophagy, are 
also discussed. Collectively, continued research is essential to clarify the 
role of NRs in AD, ultimately facilitating their potential use in the diagnosis, 
prevention, and treatment of AD.

Depositions of protein aggregates are typical pathological hallmarks of various 
neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). For example, amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau 
aggregates are present in the brain and plasma of patients with Alzheimer's 
disease (AD); α-synuclein in Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies 
(DLB), and multiple system atrophy (MSA); mutant huntingtin protein (Htt) in 
Huntington's disease (HD); and DNA-binding protein 43 kD (TDP-43) in amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and limbic-predominant 
age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE). The same misfolded proteins can be 
present in multiple diseases in the form of mixed proteinopathies. Since there 
is no cure for all these diseases, understanding the mechanisms of protein 
aggregation becomes imperative in modern medicine, especially for developing 
diagnostics and therapeutics. A Multimer Detection System (MDS) was designed to 
distinguish and quantify the multimeric/oligomeric forms from the monomeric form 
of aggregated proteins. As the unique epitope of the monomer is already occupied 
by capturing or detecting antibodies, the aggregated proteins with multiple 
epitopes would be accessible to both capturing and detecting antibodies 
simultaneously, and signals will be generated from the oligomers rather than the 
monomers. Hence, MDS could present a simple solution for measuring various 
conformations of aggregated proteins with high sensitivity and specificity, 
which may help to explore diagnostic and treatment strategies for developing 
anti-aggregation therapeutics.

Oxidative stress plays a role in various pathophysiological diseases, including 
neurogenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is the most 
prevalent neuro-pathology in the aging population. Oxidative stress has been 
reported to be one of the earliest pathological alterations in AD. Additionally, 
it was demonstrated that in older adults, there is a loss of free radical 
scavenging ability. The Nrf2 transcription factor is a key regulator in 
antioxidant defense systems, but, with aging, both the amount and the 
transcriptional activity of Nrf2 decrease. With the available treatments for AD 
being poorly effective, reinforcing the antioxidant defense systems via the Nrf2 
pathway may be a way to prevent and treat AD. To highlight the predominant role 
of Nrf2 signaling in defending against oxidative stress and, therefore, against 
neurotoxicity, we present an overview of the natural compounds that exert their 
own neuroprotective roles through the activation of the Nrf2 pathway. This 
review is an opportunity to promote a holistic approach in the treatment of AD 
and to highlight the need to further refine the development of new potential 
Nrf2-targeting drugs.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major neurodegenerative dementia, with its complex 
pathophysiology challenging current treatments. Recent advancements have shifted 
the focus from the traditionally dominant amyloid hypothesis toward a 
multifactorial understanding of the disease. Emerging evidence suggests that 
while amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulation is central to AD, it may not be the primary 
driver but rather part of a broader pathogenic process. Novel hypotheses have 
been proposed, including the role of tau protein abnormalities, mitochondrial 
dysfunction, and chronic neuroinflammation. Additionally, the gut-brain axis and 
epigenetic modifications have gained attention as potential contributors to AD 
progression. The limitations of existing therapies underscore the need for 
innovative strategies. This study explores the integration of machine learning 
(ML) in drug discovery to accelerate the identification of novel targets and 
drug candidates. ML offers the ability to navigate AD's complexity, enabling 
rapid analysis of extensive datasets and optimizing clinical trial design. The 
synergy between these themes presents a promising future for more effective AD 
treatments.

Currently, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most frequent forms of 
dementia. From a molecular perspective, the molecular characteristics that 
better define this disease consist of abnormal protein deposits between neuronal 
cells, namely senile plaques (SPs) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), 
consisting of protein aggregates of amyloid-β and hyperphosphorylated tau 
protein, respectively. In addition to these protein aggregates, a third 
molecular hallmark of AD consists of depleted neurotransmitter acetylcholine 
levels. To date, the treatments developed for this disease are mostly focused on 
the use of AChE inhibitors, presenting only a symptomatic approach against the 
disease instead of a cure. Triazines are nitrogen-containing heterocyclic 
compounds that, throughout the years, have attracted a lot of curiosity from 
medicinal chemists for presenting numerous biological properties and being 
widely present in nature. In particular, this class of compounds has been 
associated with inhibiting several biological targets, emerging as a promising 
class for developing new pharmacological agents. However, there is still a 
scarcity of knowledge regarding the potential of this type of compound against 
any of the hallmarks of AD. For this reason, this paper intends to fulfill this 
absence by highlighting the potential of a subclass of triazines, 
1,3,5-triazines (sym-triazines), as promising molecules for developing novel AD 
treatments. Thus, an in-depth analysis of 1,3,5-triazine derivatives is 
performed regarding its inhibitory activity against AChE (cholinergic 
hypothesis) and its capability to inhibit amyloid-β formation and aggregation 
(amyloid hypothesis). Through this analysis, it is possible to indicate some 
structural features optimal for each described activity, a compilation that we 
believe to be essential for the scientific community in this never-ending 
pursuit.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and is 
characterized by memory impairment that significantly interferes with daily 
life. Therapeutic options for AD that substantively modify disease progression 
remain a critical unmet need. In this regard, the gut microbiota is crucial in 
maintaining human health by regulating metabolism and immune responses, and 
increasing evidence suggests that probiotics, particularly beneficial bacteria, 
can enhance memory and cognitive functions. Recent studies have highlighted the 
positive effects of Bifidobacterium breve MCC1274 (B. breve MCC1274) on 
individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and schizophrenia. 
Additionally, oral supplementation with B. breve MCC1274 has been shown to 
effectively prevent memory decline in AppNL-G-F mice. In relation to Alzheimer's 
pathology, oral supplementation with B. breve MCC1274 has been found to reduce 
amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation and tau phosphorylation in both AppNL-G-F and 
wild-type (WT) mice. It also decreases microglial activation and increases 
levels of synaptic proteins. In this review, we examine the beneficial effects 
of B. breve MCC1274 on AD, exploring potential mechanisms of action and how this 
probiotic strain may aid in preventing or treating the disease. Furthermore, we 
discuss the broader implications of B. breve MCC1274 for improving overall host 
health and provide insights into future research directions for this promising 
probiotic therapy.

The incidence of cognitive disorders is increasing globally, with a reported 
prevalence of over 50 million individuals affected, and current interventions 
offer limited efficacy. This study investigates the effects of sunflower oil 
fortified with sunflower lecithin, vitamin D, and vitamin A on 
scopolamine-induced cognitive dysfunction in mice and explores the underlying 
mechanisms. The incidence of cognitive disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, 
is increasing yearly, and current interventions offer limited efficacy. 
Therefore, this research aims to evaluate the cognitive improvement effects of 
the three added functional factors on mice with learning and memory impairments, 
along with the associated molecular mechanisms. Behavioral tests, biochemical 
assays, and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) were 
utilized to examine the intervention effects of these functional factors on 
scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment in mice. The results revealed that the 
groups treated with sunflower lecithin and vitamin D significantly enhanced the 
mice's exploratory behavior, working memory, and spatial memory, with increases 
of 1.6 times and 4.5 times, respectively, in the open field and novel object 
recognition tests (VD group). Additionally, these treatments reduced levels of 
inflammatory markers and IL-6, increased antioxidant GSH levels, and decreased 
oxidative stress marker MDA levels, with all effects showing significant 
differences (p < 0.01). The effects were further enhanced when vitamin A was 
combined with these treatments. Transcriptomic analysis demonstrated that the 
intervention groups had markedly improved learning and memory abilities through 
upregulation of key gene expression levels in the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, 
cholinergic pathway, and folate biosynthesis pathway. These findings provide a 
theoretical basis for the development of nutritionally fortified edible oils 
with added sunflower lecithin, vitamin D, and vitamin A, which may help prevent 
and ameliorate cognitive disorders.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
with poorly understood pathology. Elevated tau, phospho-tau and mitochondrial 
dysfunction are significantly correlated with an increased risk of AD and are 
therefore targets for disease-modifying therapy. In this study, we examined the 
effects of polyphenolic extracts from six different varieties of sorghum: 
Shawaya short black-1 (Black), IS1311C (Brown), QL33/QL36 (Red), B923296 (Red), 
QL12 (White), and QL33 (Red) on the attenuation of beta amyloid-induced 
phospho-tau levels, total tau levels, and mitochondrial dysfunction in neuronal 
cells.
METHOD: Tau proteins (231 (pT231), Serine- 199 (pS199), and total tau proteins 
(T-tau)) were detected and quantified using sandwich ELISA kits, while 
mitochondrial dysfunction was measured in terms of mitochondrial membrane 
potential (Δψm) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels.
RESULTS: Almost all varieties of the sorghum extracts reduced the beta 
amyloid-induced pS199 and pT231 levels (p ≤ 0.05). The optimum concentration of 
QL33/QL36 (1000 µg/mL), QL12 (2000 µg/mL), and QL33 (2000 µg/mL) strongly 
attenuated the phospho-tau level. Sorghum IS1311C (750 µg/mL) showed the highest 
Δψm reduction (39.8%), whereas QL33 (2000 µg/mL) most strongly improved the ATP 
level (37.7%) (p ≤ 0.01). For both Δψm and ATP assays, the least activity was 
observed in sorghum B923296 at 21% and 25.5%, respectively (p ≤ 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: The polyphenol extracts from sorghum attenuated the tau toxicity 
and Aβ-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in a variety- and dose-dependent manner 
and made a promising disease-modifying agent against AD. However, extensive 
research is needed to validate the efficacy of the sorghum extracts prior to 
animal and clinical studies.

Background/Objectives: This systematic review focused on collecting the most 
significant findings on the impact of the administration of Bifidobacterium 
infantis (or Bifidobacterium longum subps. infantis) and Bifidobacterium breve, 
alone, in conjunction, or in combination with other strains, in the treatment of 
neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's 
disease (PD). These diseases are characterized by the progressive degeneration 
of neurons, resulting in a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations. AD is 
typified by a progressive decline in cognitive abilities, while PD is marked by 
motor symptoms associated with the loss of dopamine (DA). Methods: Five 
different databases, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Wiley, PubMed, and Web of Science 
(WoS), were reviewed and the studies were screened for inclusion by the 
following criteria: (i) studies that specifically evaluated the use of 
Bifidobacterium infantis, Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis, or 
Bifidobacterium breve as a therapeutic intervention, either in human or animal 
models, in the context of neurodegenerative diseases; (ii) the studies were 
required to address one or more of the pathologies examined in this article, and 
the pathologies included, but were not limited to, neurodegeneration, 
Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and oxidative stress; (iii) the full 
text was accessible online; and (iv) the article was written in English. 
Results: The data suggest that these probiotics have neuroprotective effects 
that may delay disease progression. Conclusions: This study provides updated 
insights into the use of these Bifidobacterium strains in neurodegenerative 
diseases like AD and PD, with the main limitation being the limited number of 
clinical trials available.

BACKGROUND: Aggregation of cohort data increases precision for studying 
neurodegenerative disease pathways, but efforts to combine data and expertise 
are often hampered by infrastructural, ethical and legal considerations. We 
aimed to unite various cohort studies in the Netherlands to enhance research 
infrastructure and facilitate research on dementia etiology and its public 
health implications.
METHODS: The Netherlands Consortium of Dementia Cohorts (NCDC) includes 
participants with initially no established cognitive impairment from 9 Dutch 
cohorts: the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort (ADC), Doetinchem Cohort Study (DCS), 
European Medical Information Framework for Alzheimer's Disease (EMIF-AD), 
Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (LASA), the Leiden Longevity Study (LLS), The 
Maastricht Study, the Memolife substudy of the Lifelines cohort, Rotterdam Study 
and Second Manifestations of ARTerial disease-Magnetic Resonance (SMART-MR) 
study. The objectives of NCDC are to improve data infrastructure and access to 
cohorts related to aging and dementia, investigate the role of Alzheimer's 
disease and vascular pathology in the development of dementia and estimate the 
public health impact of established dementia risk factors by assessing their 
relative contribution to the population burden of dementia.
RESULTS: We increased the findability, accessibility, interoperability and 
reusability (FAIR) status of the cohorts through harmonization of data across 
cohorts, implementation of medical imaging repositories for scan management, 
implementation of the Personal Health Train infrastructure and provision of 
meta-data in existing cohort catalogues. We established the ethical and legal 
frameworks required for federated and pooled analyses and performed the first 
remote federated data analyses using the Personal Health Train infrastructure. 
To determine biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease, endothelial dysfunction and 
inflammation, 2554 plasma samples were analyzed centrally. Federated, pooled, 
and coordinated meta-analyses have led to multiple publications in the context 
of NCDC.
CONCLUSION: The combination of population-based and clinical cohorts, the 
coordinated assessment of plasma markers in previously collected samples and 
implementation and use of the Personal Health Train infrastructure for federated 
analysis are both feasible and promising for future collaborative efforts.

BACKGROUND: Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) are conditions characterized by 
irreversible progressive degeneration to the nervous tissue and are usually 
associated with cognitive decline and functional deficits, especially in 
elderly. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) like donepezil, rivastigmine, 
and galantamine are commonly prescribed to alleviate cognitive symptoms 
associated with NDs. However, their long-term impact on slowing structural brain 
degeneration, particularly hippocampal atrophy, remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: This systematic review and meta-analysis assess the efficacy of 
AChEIs in reducing hippocampal atrophy in patients with NDs or clinical 
syndromes that lead to cognitive decline.
METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane 
databases, since inception till 20th August 2024, identified randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs) and comparative studies that measured hippocampal 
volume changes in elderly patients with NDs and other clinical syndromes. Random 
effect model was employed to estimate the pooled atrophy rates. Subgroup 
analysis was conducted by disease, dosage, and side of the measurement.
RESULTS: From 5,943 initially screened studies, nine were included in the 
review, and six were analyzed in the meta-analysis, encompassing a total of 
2,179 participants. The meta-analysis showed that donepezil at a 10 mg dose 
significantly reduced hippocampal atrophy compared to placebo (SMD = 0.44, 95% 
CI [0.08 to 0.81], p = 0.01), whereas the 5 mg dose showed no significant effect 
on hippocampal volume. Overall, pooled results favored donepezil in reducing 
hippocampal atrophy (SMD = 0.33, p = 0.04), indicating that higher doses are 
more effective. Among patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), both 
donepezil and vitamin E were associated with a significant reduction in 
hippocampal atrophy compared to placebo (SMD = 0.27, p = 0.01). In contrast, 
galantamine did not significantly reduce hippocampal atrophy in the overall 
analysis, but it was associated with reduced whole brain atrophy in APOE ε4 
carriers. Further analysis revealed no significant difference in the reduction 
of right or left hippocampal atrophy in donepezil-treated patients. These 
findings suggest that donepezil, particularly at higher doses, may have a 
protective effect against hippocampal atrophy in patients with AD and MCI, while 
galantamine's effect may be more limited, especially in certain genetic 
subgroups.
CONCLUSION: Higher doses of donepezil (10 mg) significantly reduce hippocampal 
atrophy in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment, suggesting 
potential neuroprotective effects. In contrast, lower doses (5 mg) and 
galantamine showed no significant impact on hippocampal volume, though 
galantamine reduced whole brain atrophy in APOE ε4 carriers. Dosage and genetic 
factors are crucial in determining the efficacy of acetylcholinesterase 
inhibitors in slowing neurodegeneration.

BACKGROUND: The importance of natural killer (NK) cells of the innate immune 
system in neurodegenerative disease has largely been overlooked despite studies 
demonstrating their ability to reduce neuroinflammation (thought to be mediated 
by the elimination of activated T cells, degradation of protein aggregates and 
secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines). SNK01 is an autologous 
non-genetically modified NK cell product showing increased activity in vitro. We 
hypothesized that SNK01 can be safely infused to reduce neuroinflammation in 
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients.
METHODS: SNK01 was produced and characterized for its ability to eliminate 
activated T cells, degrade protein aggregates and secrete anti-inflammatory 
cytokines. In this phase 1 study, SNK01 was administered intravenously every 
three weeks for a total of 4 treatments using a 3 + 3 dose escalation design (1, 
2 and 4 × 109 cells) in subjects with either mild, moderate, or severe AD 
(median CDR-SB 10.0). Cognitive assessments and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers 
associated with protein aggregation, neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation 
including amyloid-β42 and 42/40, α-synuclein, total Tau, pTau217 and pTau181, 
neurofilament light, GFAP and YKL-40 analyses were performed at baseline, at 1 
and 12 weeks after the last dose. The primary endpoint was safety; secondary 
endpoints included changes in cognitive assessments and biomarker levels.
RESULTS: In preclinical in vitro studies, SNK01 were able to uptake and degrade 
the protein aggregates of amyloid-β and α-synuclein, produce anti-inflammatory 
cytokines and eliminate activated T cells. In the phase 1 clinical study, eleven 
subjects were enrolled (10 evaluable). No drug-related adverse events were 
observed. Despite 70% of subjects being treated at relatively low doses of SNK01 
(1 and 2 × 109 cells), 50-70% of all enrolled subjects had stable/improved 
CDR-SB, ADAS-Cog and/or MMSE scores and 90% had stable/improved ADCOMS at 
one-week after the last dose. SNK01 also appeared to have beneficial effects on 
protein aggregate levels and neuroinflammatory biomarkers in the cerebrospinal 
fluid, with decreases in pTau181 and GFAP appearing to be dose-dependent.
CONCLUSIONS: SNK01 was well tolerated and appeared to have clinical activity in 
AD while also having beneficial effects on cerebrospinal fluid protein and 
neuroinflammatory biomarker levels. A larger trial with a higher dosing/duration 
has been initiated in the USA in 2023.

The Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the concentrations of 
neurofilament light (NfL) and total tau (t-tau) are changed in the early stages 
of Alzheimer's disease (AD)1, but their neurobiological correlates are not 
entirely understood. Here, we used 5xFAD transgenic mice to investigate the 
associations between these CSF biomarkers and measures of cerebral Aβ, including 
Aβ42/Aβ40 ratios in plaques, insoluble fibrillar deposits and soluble 
protofibrils. A high Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio in soluble protofibrils was the strongest 
independent predictor of low CSF Aβ42/Aβ40 ratios and high CSF NfL and t-tau 
concentrations when compared to Aβ42/Aβ40 ratios in plaques and insoluble 
fibrillar deposits. Furthermore, the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio in soluble protofibrils 
fully mediated the associations between the corresponding ratio in plaques and 
all the investigated CSF biomarkers. In AppNL-G-F/NL-G-F knock-in mice, 
protofibrils fully mediated the association between plaques and the CSF 
Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio. Together, the results suggest that the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio in CSF 
might better reflect brain levels of soluble Aβ protofibrils than insoluble Aβ 
fibrils in plaques in AD. Furthermore, elevated concentrations of NfL and t-tau 
in CSF might be triggered by increased brain levels of soluble Aβ protofibrils.

Fagonia arabica L. is a widely used traditional medicinal herb. This study 
explored the flavonoid and phenolic acid content in the aerial parts of F. 
arabica, leading to the tentative identification of 42 compounds using 
Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography-Quadrupole Time-of-Flight Mass/Mass 
Spectrometry and analyzed with the phytochemical-focused RIKEN tandem mass 
spectral database (ReSpect) for identification based on authentic standards. The 
total phenolic and flavonoid content was measured in the ethyl acetate and 
butanol fractions. The flavonoid content in the ethyl acetate fraction was 
101 ± 1.43 µg Rutin/mg, compared to 6.48 ± 0.29 µg rutin/mg in the butanol 
fraction. Similarly, the ethyl acetate fraction contained 199.14 ± 1.58 µg 
gallic acid/mg, while the butanol fraction had 47.69 ± 0.54 µg gallic acid/mg. 
Also, the study demonstrated the effectiveness of the different fractions of 
Fagonia arabica L. in inhibiting the butyrylcholinesterase enzyme, which is a 
key contributor to the progression of Alzheimer's disease. At a concentration of 
0.45 mg/mL, the ethyl acetate fraction showed the highest efficiency, inhibiting 
butyrylcholinesterase by 50% (IC50). Based on the in vitro results, a molecular 
docking study suggested the selectivity of the tentatively identified compounds 
towards butyrylcholinesterase over acetylcholinesterase, as 
kaempferol-3-O-glucoside achieved the highest selectivity. This insight could 
inform potential modifications to enhance selectivity, which may be applied in 
the synthesis, semi-synthesis, and development of novel treatments for 
Alzheimer's disease.

Amyloidoses, which are characterized by abnormal accumulation of amyloid 
proteins leading to organ dysfunction, represent a major therapeutic challenge. 
They include neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer disease (AD), 
tauopathies and synucleinopathies. Since amyloids are causative factors in these 
diseases, the importance of proteolytic methods to remove amyloid, such as 
immunotherapy and Proteolysis Targeting Chimera (PROTAC) technology, has been 
recognized. Immunotherapy removes target proteins by antibody-mediated reactions 
and is the most studied method in practical use for the treatment of AD. PROTAC 
is a small molecule that uses the ubiquitin-proteasome system to degrade 
intracellular target proteins and has demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials 
for other diseases. In addition, a new modality called photo-oxygenation has 
been developed. Photo-oxygenation is a method of selectively adding oxygen to 
amyloid using a photocatalyst, which is a small molecule compound that is 
activated by light. Studies both in vitro and in vivo have shown promising 
results in inhibiting amyloid aggregation and enhancing the clearance of amyloid 
proteins. In this review, we introduce and discuss these proteolytic modalities, 
and provide insights into potential future directions for the clinical 
application in amyloidoses.

Astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, once considered passive support cells, are now 
recognized as active participants in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. 
Emerging evidence highlights the critical role that these glial cells play in 
the pathological features of Alzheimer's, including neuroinflammation, 
excitotoxicity, synaptic dysfunction, and myelin degeneration, which contribute 
to neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Here, we review the current 
understanding of astrocyte and oligodendrocyte pathology in Alzheimer's disease 
and highlight research that supports the therapeutic potential of modulating 
astrocyte and oligodendrocyte functions to treat Alzheimer's disease.

Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are a class of cognitive and motor disorders 
including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's 
disease (HD), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), and others. They are caused 
by lesions in cells and tissues of the central nervous system, resulting in 
corresponding dysfunctions and consequent decline in cognitive and motor 
functions. Neural tissues are extremely vulnerable to oxidative stress, which 
plays critical biological roles in NDDs. Aromatic compounds are found 
extensively in natural plants and have substantial effects of anti-oxidative 
stress damage, which not only have a wide range of research applications in 
cosmetics, foods, etc., but are also frequently utilized in the treatment of 
various central nervous system diseases. This review summarizes the relevant 
oxidative stress mechanisms in NDDs (AD, PD, HD, and ALS) and reviews aromatic 
compounds such as polyphenols, terpenoids, and flavonoids that can be used in 
the management of neurodegenerative diseases, as well as their specific 
mechanisms of antioxidant action. This review will serve as a reference for 
future experimental studies on neurodegenerative illnesses while also offering 
fresh insights into clinical therapy.

Anoectochilus roxburghii is a high-value plant resource for nutraceutical 
efficacy and medicinal applications, among which kinsenoside is recognized as 
the main bioactive glycoside. However, the anti-aging and anti-Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) activities of kinsenoside have long been neglected. The objective 
of this study was to investigate the influences of kinsenoside on aging and 
amyloid-β (Aβ) proteotoxicity and underlying molecular mechanisms in 
Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). Kinsenoside (50 μM) could significantly 
prolong the mean lifespan of C. elegans by 26.3 %. Moreover, it improved the 
physiological functions, stress resistance and in vivo antioxidant activities of 
C. elegans. Further studies indicated that kinsenoside upregulated the mRNA 
expression levels of aging-associated genes including sir-2.1, hsp-16.2, sek-1, 
skn-1, sod-3, hsf-1, gst-4. The genetic studies and molecular docking studies 
supported that SKN-1 and HSF-1 transcription factors were requirements for the 
kinsenoside-mediated longevity. Furthermore, kinsenoside could exert a 
protective effect on Aβ-induced proteotoxicity by regulating stress-responsive 
and autophagy-related genes in C. elegans CL4176. The results sheds light on the 
bioactive properties and pharmaceutical potential of kinsenoside including 
anti-aging and anti-AD, broadening the prospects of kinsenoside for industrial 
applications.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses a significant obstacle in today's healthcare 
landscape, with limited effective treatments. Recent studies have revealed 
encouraging findings about how exercise-triggered irisin might help slow down 
the advancement of AD. Irisin, a myokine, released during physical activity, has 
garnered significant attention for its pleiotropic effects, extending beyond its 
traditional role in metabolic regulation. This review explores irisin's 
multifaceted potential in combating AD. Research indicates that irisin enhances 
synaptic plasticity, crucial for learning and memory, and exhibits 
neuroprotective properties that may slow AD progression by safeguarding neurons 
from degeneration. Additionally, irisin's ability to modulate inflammatory 
responses is significant, as neuroinflammation is a key feature of AD pathology. 
Irisin may also influence the metabolism and clearance of amyloid-beta plaques 
and tau tangles, hallmark pathological markers of AD. Furthermore, irisin boosts 
brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression, vital for neuronal health, and 
improves insulin glucose regulation, addressing impaired brain insulin signaling 
observed in AD. Exercise-induced irisin presents a non-pharmacological strategy, 
leveraging physical activity's brain health benefits. Future research should 
focus on elucidating irisin's mechanisms and conducting clinical trials to 
assess its therapeutic efficacy and safety in AD patients. Overall, irisin 
therapy offers a promising avenue for AD treatment, potentially slowing disease 
progression and enhancing cognitive function, paving the way for innovative 
therapeutic strategies in the fight against AD.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) have similar 
clinical characteristics in the brain and islet, as well as an increased 
incidence with ageing and familial susceptibility. Therefore, in recent years 
there has been a great desire for research that elucidates how anti-diabetic 
drugs affect AD. This work attempts to first elucidate the possible mechanism of 
action of DPP-IV inhibitors in the treatment of AD by employing techniques from 
network pharmacology, molecular docking, molecular dynamic simulation, principal 
component analysis, and MM/PBSA. A total of 463 targets were identified from the 
SwissTargetPrediction and 784 targets were identified from the SuperPred 
databases. 79 common targets were screened using the PPI network. The GO and 
KEGG analyses indicated that the activity of DPP-IV against AD potentially 
involves the hsa04080 neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction signalling 
pathway, which contains 17 proteins, including CHRM2, CHRM3, CHRNB1, CHRNB4, 
CHRM1, PTGER2, CHRM4, CHRM5, TACR2, HTR2C, TACR1, F2, GABRG2, MC4R, HTR7, CHRNG, 
and DRD3. Molecular docking demonstrated that sitagliptin had the greatest 
binding affinity of -10.7 kcal/mol and established hydrogen bonds with the 
Asp103, Ser107, and Asn404 residues in the active site of the CHRM2 protein. 
Molecular dynamic simulation, PCA, and MM/PBSA were performed for the complex of 
sitagliptin with the above-mentioned proteins, which revealed a stable complex 
throughout the simulation. The work identifies the active component and possible 
molecular mechanism of sitagliptin in the treatment of AD and provides a 
theoretical foundation for future fundamental research and practical 
implementation.

Suppression of the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme is a prevalent strategy 
for curing diverse mental disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the 
chronic autoimmune disease Myasthenia gravis. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors 
promote cholinergic transmission via blocking AChE, which is implicated in the 
degradation and deficiency of acetylcholine. Various studies proved that the 
lack of cholinergic neurons in the central nervous system is the substantial 
reason for the behavioral abnormalities and cognitive retogradation that 
distinguish mental diseases such as dementia and AD. Moreover, thiazole 
scaffolds have emerged as prominent pharmacophores in drug discovery owing to 
their numerous outstanding therapeutic efficacy, comprising 
anti-acetylcholinesterase efficacy. This review presents various thiazole-based 
AChE inhibitors in the recent decade. In addition, the various interactions of 
thiazole derivatives within the active pocket of AChE have been highlighted. 
Also, structure-activity relationship (SAR) has been discussed.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects more than 10% of the population ≥65 y of age, 
but the underlying biological risks of most AD cases are unclear. We show 
anti-poly-glycine-arginine (a-polyGR) positive aggregates frequently accumulate 
in sporadic AD autopsy brains (45/80 cases). We hypothesize that these 
aggregates are caused by one or more polyGR-encoding repeat expansion mutations. 
We developed a CRISPR/deactivated-Cas9 enrichment strategy to identify candidate 
GR-encoding repeat expansion mutations directly from genomic DNA isolated from 
a-polyGR(+) AD cases. Using this approach, we isolated an interrupted (GGGAGA)n 
intronic expansion within a SINE-VNTR-Alu element in CASP8 (CASP8-GGGAGAEXP). 
Immunostaining using a-polyGR and locus-specific C-terminal antibodies 
demonstrate that the CASP8-GGGAGAEXP expresses hybrid poly(GR)n(GE)n(RE)n 
proteins that accumulate in CASP8-GGGAGAEXP(+) AD brains. In cells, expression 
of CASP8-GGGAGAEXP minigenes leads to increased p-Tau (Ser202/Thr205) levels. 
Consistent with other types of repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) proteins, 
poly(GR)n(GE)n(RE)n protein levels are increased by stress. Additionally, levels 
of these stress-induced proteins are reduced by metformin. Association studies 
show specific aggregate promoting interrupted CASP8-GGGAGAEXP sequence variants 
found in ~3.6% of controls and 7.5% AD cases increase AD risk 
[CASP8-GGGAGA-AD-R1; OR 2.2, 95% CI (1.5185 to 3.1896), P = 3.1 × 10-5]. Cells 
transfected with a high-risk CASP8-GGGAGA-AD-R1 variant show increased toxicity 
and increased levels of poly(GR)n(GE)n(RE)n aggregates. Taken together, these 
data identify polyGR(+) aggregates as a frequent and unexpected type of brain 
pathology in AD and CASP8-GGGAGA-AD-R1 alleles as a relatively common AD risk 
factor. Taken together, these data support a model in which CASP8-GGGAGAEXP 
alleles combined with stress increase AD risk.

The relationship between aging, mitochondrial dysfunction, neurodegeneration, 
and the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex area of study. Aging is 
the primary risk factor for AD, and it is associated with a decline in 
mitochondrial function. This mitochondrial dysfunction is believed to contribute 
to the neurodegenerative processes observed in AD. Neurodegeneration in AD is 
characterized by the progressive loss of synapses and neurons, particularly in 
regions of the brain involved in memory and cognition. It is hypothesized that 
mitochondrial dysfunction plays a pivotal role by disrupting cellular energy 
metabolism and increasing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which 
can damage cellular components and exacerbate neuronal loss. Despite extensive 
research, the precise molecular pathways linking mitochondrial dysfunction to AD 
pathology are not fully understood. Various hypotheses have been proposed, 
including the mitochondrial cascade hypothesis, which suggests that 
mitochondrial dysfunction is an early event in AD pathogenesis that triggers a 
cascade of cellular events leading to neurodegeneration. With this narrative 
review, we aim to summarize some specific issues in the literature on 
mitochondria and their involvement in AD onset, with a focus on the development 
of therapeutical strategies targeting the mitochondria environment and their 
potential application for the treatment of AD itself.

The recent approval of lecanemab highlights that the amyloid beta (Aβ) protein 
is an important pathological target in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and further 
emphasizes the significance of neuroinflammatory pathways in regulating Aβ 
accumulation. Indeed, Aβ accumulation triggers microglia activation, which are 
key mediators in neuroinflammation. The inflammatory responses in this process 
can lead to neuronal damage and functional decline. Microglia secrete 
proinflammatory cytokines that accelerate neuronal death and release 
anti-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors contributing to neuronal recovery 
and protection. Thus, microglia play a dual role in neurodegeneration and 
neuroprotection, complicating their function in AD. Therefore, elucidating the 
complex interactions between Aβ protein, microglia, and neuroinflammation is 
essential for developing new strategies for treating AD. This review 
investigates the receptors and pathways involved in activating microglia and 
aims to enhance understanding of how these processes impact neuroinflammation in 
AD, as well as how they can be regulated. This review also analyzed studies 
reported in the existing literature and ongoing clinical trials. Overall, these 
studies will contribute to understanding the regulatory mechanisms of 
neuroinflammation and developing new therapies that can slow the pathological 
progression of AD.

Cognitive disorders and psychiatric pathologies, particularly Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) and Major depressive disorder (MDD), represent a considerable 
health burden, impacting millions of people in the United States and worldwide. 
Notably, comorbidities of MDD and anxiety are prevalent in the early stages of 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which is the preceding phase of Alzheimer's 
disease and related dementia (ADRD). The symptoms of MDD and anxiety affect up 
to 80% of individuals in the advanced stages of the neurodegenerative 
conditions. Despite overlapping clinical manifestations, the pathogenesis of 
AD/ADRD and MDD remains inadequately elucidated. Until now, dozens of drugs for 
treating AD/ADRD have failed in clinical trials because they have not proven 
beneficial in reversing or preventing the progression of these neuropsychiatric 
indications. This underscores the need to identify new drug targets that could 
reverse neuropsychiatric symptoms and delay the progress of AD/ADRD. In this 
context, phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) arises as a primary enzyme in the modulation 
of cognition and mood disorders, particularly through its enzymatic action on 
cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and its downstream anti-inflammatory 
pathways. Despite the considerable cognitive and antidepressant potential of 
PDE4 inhibitors, their translation into clinical practice is hampered by 
profound side effects. Recent studies have focused on the effects of PDE4 and 
its subtype-selective isoform inhibitors, aiming to delineate their precise 
mechanistic contributions to neuropsychiatric symptoms with greater specificity. 
This review aims to analyze the current advances regarding PDE4 
inhibition-specifically the selective targeting of its isoforms and elucidate 
the therapeutic implications of enhanced cAMP signaling and the consequent 
anti-inflammatory responses in ameliorating the symptomatology associated with 
AD and ADRD.

Traumatic brain injuries (TBI) are diverse with heterogeneous injury 
pathologies, which creates challenges for the clinical treatment and prevention 
of secondary pathologies such as post-traumatic epilepsy and subsequent 
dementias. To develop pharmacological strategies that treat TBI and prevent 
complications, animal models must capture the spectrum of TBI severity to better 
understand pathophysiological events that occur during and after injury. To 
address such issues, we improved upon our recent larval zebrafish TBI paradigm 
emphasizing titrating to different injury levels. We observed coordination 
between an increase in injury level and clinically relevant injury phenotypes 
including post-traumatic seizures (PTS) and tau aggregation. This preclinical 
TBI model is simple to implement, allows dosing of injury levels to model 
diverse pathologies, and can be scaled to medium- or high-throughput screening.

BACKGROUND: A major issue with neurodegenerative diseases is cholinergic 
depletion, the development of oxidative stress, and the reduction in the ability 
to control the expression of genes involved in the regulation of neurogenesis. 
The most widespread neurodegenerative disease is Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Current treatments are not able to improve the symptoms of the disease. Thus, 
selecting or creating a safe and effective drug is very important.
OBJECTIVE: In this context, the potential of sweroside (Swe) to regulate 
acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, malondialdehyde (MDA) level, and bdnf, 
npy, egr1, nfr2a, and creb1 gene expression in the scopolamine (Sco)-induced 
zebrafish model of cognitive impairment was investigated.
METHODS: Swe was administered daily for 16 days chronically to zebrafish at 
concentrations of 1 μg/L, 3 μg/L, and 5 μg/L whereas Sco (100 μM) was given to 
zebrafish for 30 min.
RESULTS: Exposure to Swe decreased AChE activity and MDA level along with 
upregulating of gene expression in the brain of the Sco-induced zebrafish model.
CONCLUSION: Overall, our findings suggested that Swe has a positive role in the 
cholinergic system activity and brain antioxidant status and showed for the 
first time that it can restore the downregulated expression of bdnf, npy, egr1, 
nfr2a, and creb1 genes in the brain of the Sco-induced zebrafish model.

Exploring the Impact of Curcumin and Carbon Nanotubes on BetaAmyloid Peptide 
Dimer: Insights from Molecular Dynamics Simulation and Density Functional Theory 
Methods.

AIM: At the molecular level, the accumulation of beta-amyloid peptide is one of 
the important mechanisms in the formation of amyloid plaques. These plaques, in 
turn, are considered one of the important factors in the development of 
Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, it is important to study the factors affecting 
beta-amyloid peptides. This study aimed to investigate the impact of curcumin on 
the structure of beta-amyloid peptide dimers and how carbon nanotubes influence 
this interaction. The research focused on understanding the molecular dynamics 
and structural changes induced by curcumin to reduce beta-amyloid toxicity.
BACKGROUND: Curcumin, a phenolic compound, is known for its ability to prevent 
the aggregation of beta-amyloid peptides, which are associated with 
neurodegenerative diseases. On the other hand, due to the hydrophobic nature of 
curcumin, its solubility in aqueous media is limited. To overcome this, a 
carrier is used. Carbon nanotubes are among the carriers of curcumin. Nanotubes 
are popular candidates for the delivery of effective pharmaceutical compounds 
due to their unique surface properties and biocompatibility. The use of a 
carrier affects the study of the mechanism of interaction of curcumin with the 
peptide, which in turn makes it difficult to study this mechanism. Thus, despite 
its recognized inhibitory action on beta-amyloid aggregation, there is limited 
understanding of its precise effects on the peptide's structure. This study 
addresses this gap by employing molecular dynamics simulations and density 
functional theory methods.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to elucidate the structural effects 
of curcumin on betaamyloid peptide dimers and assess the modifying role of 
carbon nanotubes using computational methods.
METHOD: The effect of curcumin on beta-amyloid peptide dimers was studied using 
molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory. The simulations 
were conducted both in the presence and absence of carbon nanotubes to assess 
their influence on curcumin's activity and the structural stability of the 
peptide.
RESULTS: The presence of curcumin and carbon nanotubes induced relative 
instability in betaamyloid dimers. Curcumin exhibited stronger interactions with 
the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of the peptide than with the middle 
section. It also reduced the toxicity of the peptide by particularly affecting 
the salt bridge and the arrangement of Phe19, Ile31, and Leu34 residues. Carbon 
nanotubes mitigated curcumin's effects on the peptide, altering curcumin's 
behavior by reducing its activity, but increasing its solvation energy.
CONCLUSION: Curcumin plays a significant role in destabilizing beta-amyloid 
dimers and reducing their toxicity, with its effect being modulated by the 
presence of carbon nanotubes. This dual influence highlights the potential of 
using curcumin, alongside nanomaterials, in therapeutic strategies for 
neurodegenerative diseases. This study provided valuable insights into the 
molecular interactions among curcumin, beta-amyloid peptides, and carbon 
nanotubes. These findings can contribute to the development of more effective 
treatments targeting amyloid-related toxicity in neurodegenerative conditions.

INTRODUCTION: The potential therapeutic role of nicotine in Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) remains controversial, particularly regarding its age-dependent effects and 
underlying mechanisms.
METHODS: This study investigated the impact of chronic nicotine administration 
on cognitive function and molecular pathways in Presenilin 1/2 double knockout 
(DKO) mice, an amyloid-β: (Aβ:)- independent model of AD. Three-month-old and 
eight-month-old DKO and wild-type (WT) mice received oral nicotine treatment 
(100 μg/ml) for three months. Behavioral assessments revealed that while the 
6-month-old cohort showed no significant differences between nicotine-treated 
and control groups regardless of genotype, nicotine improved contextual fear 
memory in 11-month- old DKO mice but impaired nest-building ability and cued 
fear memory in age-matched WT controls. Transcriptome analysis of the prefrontal 
cortex identified distinct molecular responses to nicotine between genotypes.
RESULTS: In DKO mice, nicotine modulated neuropeptide signaling and reduced 
astrocyte activation, while in WT mice, it disrupted cytokine-cytokine receptor 
interaction and neuroactive ligand- receptor interaction pathways. Western blot 
analysis revealed that nicotine treatment significantly reduced tau 
hyperphosphorylation and Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) expression in 
11-month-old DKO mice, which was further confirmed by immunohistochemistry 
showing decreased astrocyte activation in multiple brain regions
CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that nicotine's effects on cognition and 
molecular pathways are both age- and genotype-dependent, suggesting its 
therapeutic potential may be limited to specific stages of neurodegeneration 
while potentially having adverse effects in healthy aging brains.

Inhibiting β-amyloid aggregation and enhancing its clearance are the key 
strategies in Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment. Liver X receptors (LXRs) plays 
a crucial role in cholesterol homeostasis and inflammation, and their activation 
can clear Aβ aggregates in AD. Allopregnanolone, a neurosteroid, positively 
influences AD through LXR regulation, while ganaxolone, its synthetic analog, is 
known for its neuroprotective properties. This study explores the effect of 
ganaxolone on LXR activation and regulation of genes involved in mitigating Aβ 
toxicity and tauopathy in SH-SY5Y cells transfected with APP695 Swe/Ind plasmid 
and an Aβ1-42 induced AD mouse model. Molecular docking stimulations indicated 
ganaxolone's binding and interaction with LXRβ. Subsequently, transfected 
neuronal cells exhibited increased mRNA levels of APP, TNF-α and IL-1β, 
decreased cell viability, reduced MMP and altered protein expression of Aβ, LXR, 
BCL-2, APOE, ABCA1, along with increased levels of mROS, Bax, and caspase 3 
activity. Ganaxolone treatment significantly abrogated Aβ-induced effect in 
transfected neuronal cells by enhancing LXRβ expression, inducing LXR:RXR 
colocalization, thereby increasing APOE and ABCA1 expression. It also decreased 
tau mRNA levels in transfected cells. Importantly, in AD mice, ganaxolone 
ameliorated cognitive impairment, reduced Aβ toxicity, tau levels, and 
neuroinflammatory markers, restored mitochondrial function, and decreased 
neuronal apoptosis. Taken together, these novel results highlight the central 
role of LXR in mediating Aβ-induced toxicity and provide preclinical evidence 
for ganaxolone as a potential agent to reduce toxicity in an LXR-dependent 
manner. This may serve as a promising treatment strategy to slow or prevent 
neurodegeneration in AD patients.

INTRODUCTION: Modeling the survival rate in syndromes associated with 
frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is essential to assess disease 
trajectories.
METHODS: In 262 patients with FTLD, we considered plasma neurofilament light 
chain (NfL), glial fibrillary acidic protein, brain-derived tau, phosphorylated 
tau217 and amyloid beta (Aβ42/Aβ40). The FTLD Survival Score (FTLD-SS) was 
calculated by the β coefficients of the variables independently associated with 
survival rate.
RESULTS: Increased plasma NfL levels (p < 0.001), older age at evaluation 
(p = 0.002), positive family history (p = 0.04), and motor phenotypes 
(p < 0.001) were associated with reduced survival. The predictive validity of 
FTLD-SS was 0.75 (95% confidence interval, 0.59-0.91) at 1 year.
DISCUSSION: Survival rate in FTLD is shaped by intensity of neurodegeneration 
(using plasma NfL as proxy) together with certain clinical variables. The 
FTLD-SS may serve as a simple tool for survival rate estimation and for patient 
stratification in clinical trials.
HIGHLIGHTS: Plasma neurofilament light chain and clinical variables can predict 
survival in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD)-associated syndromes. FTLD 
Survival Score (FTLD-SS), computed with survival predictors, may serve as a 
simple tool for patient stratification. FTLD-SS is associated with greater 
atrophy in frontal and putamen areas.

INTRODUCTION: This study aims to establish the fingerprint spectra of 
Kai-Xin-San (KXS) and investigate its spectrum-effect relationship in treating 
Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: Initially, the fingerprints of 15 batches of KXS were established and 
analyzed using HPLC, with the method's precision, stability, and repeatability 
thoroughly evaluated. Subsequently, the effects of the 15 batches of KXS were 
assessed in an olfactory escape memory experiment, utilizing Aβ42 transgenic 
drosophila as a model. Finally, the spectrum-effect relationship between the KXS 
fingerprint and memory improvement was analyzed, with the active ingredients 
subjected to validation testing.
RESULTS: The results identified seventeen common peaks in the fingerprint, and 
eight active components were determined: polygalaxanthone III, 
3-6-disinapoylsucrose, ginsenoside Rg1, ginsenoside Rb1, β-asarone, α-asarone, 
dehydrotumulosic acid, and dehydropachymic acid. Treatment with KXS (1%, for 
4 days) significantly enhanced the performance index of Aβ42 flies in the 
olfactory experiment. Both spectrum-effect analysis and validation tests 
indicated that polygalaxanthone III, ginsenoside Rg1, ginsenoside Rb1, 
β-asarone, and α-asarone were positively correlated with the performance index 
and improved the performance index in the olfactory experiment. The HPLC 
fingerprint method for KXS demonstrated excellent precision, accuracy, and 
reproducibility, making it suitable for quality evaluation and control of KXS. 
Polygalaxanthone III, ginsenoside Rg1, ginsenoside Rb1, β-asarone, and α-asarone 
are identified as potential active ingredients of KXS for anti-AD effects.
DISCUSSION: These findings provide an experimental basis for developing new 
drugs based on KXS and its active ingredient combinations.

INTRODUCTION: New Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatments have created an urgent 
need for accurate early diagnosis of high-risk adults with Down syndrome (DS), 
distinguishing prodromal DS-AD symptoms from lifelong cognitive impairments. 
Often, clinicians will need to evaluate dementia status during a single 
assessment, and here we describe empirically supported methods effective under 
such circumstances.
METHODS: Archived data collected between 1987 and 2017 included longitudinal 
findings for 144 individuals maintaining cognitive stability and 126 developing 
prodromal DS-AD. Response operating characteristic analyses compared groups, 
defined by the presence/absence of prodromal DS-AD, for a single assessment.
RESULTS: Groups differed on all measures without adjusting for developmental 
history, 0.717 < areas under the curve < 0.859, Ps < 0.0001. The balance between 
sensitivity and specificity improved slightly when developmental histories were 
considered.
DISCUSSION: The present study demonstrated that one-time assessments can inform 
clinical judgments when diagnosing adults at risk for DS-AD. Knowledge of 
developmental history is valuable but non-essential.
HIGHLIGHTS: Non-overlapping distributions were observed for preclinical and 
prodromal Alzheimer's disease (AD) groups.Receiver operating characteristic area 
under the curve analyses were in the acceptable to excellent range for all 
measures.Performance was sensitive to both the severity of intellectual 
disability and the stage of Down syndrome-AD progression.Episodic memory tests 
were sensitive to the transition from preclinical to prodromal AD.Performance 
results at a single time point can inform dementia status decisions.

INTRODUCTION: Motivated by the difficulties in detecting cognitive deterioration 
in the context of Down syndrome (DS), we aimed to identify markers of prodromal 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) in this population.
METHODS: Sixty-two participants with DS (age > 45) distributed in three groups 
(asymptomatic [ADS], prodromal [PDS], and dementia [DDS]) completed the 
Cambridge Examination for Mental Disorders of Older People with Down's Syndrome 
and Others with Intellectual Disabilities, Cambridge Cognitive Examination for 
older adults with Down's Syndrome, and Barcelona Test for Intellectual 
Disability tests and a magnetic resonance imaging scan.
RESULTS: Although temporal orientation showed significant differences among 
groups, only a predictive diagnostic model based on verbal short-term memory 
tasks (relying on "cued" recall) allowed the correct classification of 88.5% of 
ADS, 75.0% of PDS, and 95% of DDS individuals. Cognitive decline strongly 
correlated with brain volume reductions in orbitofrontal, medial-temporal, and 
bilateral thalamus within the DDS group.
DISCUSSION: Neuropsychological results showed that PDS cases were characterized 
by a significant deterioration of verbal memory and temporal orientation, 
compared to ADS. This pattern might be crucial to support diagnosis in clinical 
settings.Highlights: Detecting signs of prodromal dementia is a major challenge 
in Down syndrome.Such challenge is due to a poor definition of the early 
cognitive manifestations.Memory tasks relying on "cued" recall allowed the 
detection of prodromal cases.A pattern of temporal disorientation was also 
evident in the prodromal phase.These cognitive deficits preceded volumetric 
brain changes only present in dementia.

The design of clinical trials in Alzheimer's disease (AD) must consider the 
development of new plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and imaging biomarkers. 
They must also define clinically meaningful outcomes for patients and set 
endpoints that measure these outcomes accurately. With the accelerated United 
States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the first anti-amyloid, 
disease-modifying treatment for AD, a monoclonal antibody called aducanumab, the 
landscape of clinical trial design is evolving. Enrolment in clinical trials may 
be impacted by the availability of this and other treatments, and trial design 
must take into consideration that patients may desire a disease-modifying 
treatment rather than potentially being randomized to the placebo arm. The 
Alzheimer's Association Research Roundtable (AARR) Fall 2021 meeting discussed 
the consideration of well-defined AD staging criteria in protocol design and how 
they influence more standardized inclusion/exclusion criteria for trials, as 
well as what constitutes meaningful differentiation between the stages. 
Discussion explored the current state of knowledge regarding biomarkers and how 
they can inform AD staging criteria, as many trials are now designed based on 
specific biomarker features, further underscoring the importance of coordinating 
AD staging criteria and biomarkers. The relationship between cognition and 
biomarkers has been studied and this must continue as trials move forward. 
Researchers, patients, clinicians, regulatory scientists, and payers discussed 
the state of the field as well as the future of symptomatic Alzheimer's disease 
clinical trials.
HIGHLIGHTS: The Alzheimer's Association Research Roundtable (AARR) convened 
leaders from academia and industry as well as patients, care partners, 
clinicians, regulators, and payers to discuss the topic of operationalizing 
selection criteria for clinical trials and the role of biomarkers.Well-defined 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) staging criteria are an important consideration in 
study protocol design.Staging criteria and biomarkers must be coordinated to 
yield high-quality clinical trial results that have meaning for patients with AD 
by selecting a population most likely to benefit from a specific treatment.

INTRODUCTION: Brain steady-state gamma oscillations evoked using a non-invasive 
medical device (Spectris) have shown potential clinical benefits in patients 
with mild-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD), including reduced functional and 
cognitive decline, reduced brain volume and myelin loss, and increased brain 
functional connectivity. We analyzed changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
proteins after Spectris treatment in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and their 
relationship to established biological pathways implicated in AD.
METHODS: Unbiased proteomic analysis of CSF samples from participants with 
amyloid-positive MCI (n = 10) was conducted from the FLICKER (NCT03543878) 
clinical trial. Participants used the Cognito Therapeutics medical device 
(Spectris), confirmed to evoke steady-state gamma oscillations. Participants 
were instructed to use the device daily for 1 hour each day during the trial. 
CSF was collected prior to the start of stimulation and after 4 and 8 weeks of 
treatment. The proteome was analyzed using tandem mass tag mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: Differential expression analysis of proteins at baseline and after 8 
weeks of treatment (N = 5) revealed that 110 out of 2951 proteins met the 
significance threshold (analysis of variance, P < 0.05, no false discovery 
rate). Sixty proteins were upregulated, and 50 proteins were downregulated after 
treatment. Changes in protein expression were mapped to the consensus human AD 
protein network, representing co-expressed and functionally linked modules 
linked to cell type and biochemical pathways. Treatment altered CSF proteins 
linked to AD-related brain proteome modules, including those involved in 
myelination (proteolipid protein 1, ecotropic viral integration site 2A), 
synaptic and neuroimmune functions, and regulation of cellular lipid 
transportation. Biological pathway analysis revealed that most impacted pathways 
were associated with lipoproteins, cholesterol, phospholipids processing, and 
phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis.
DISCUSSION: The CSF proteomic changes observed in this study suggest pleiotropic 
effects on multiple pathways involved in AD, including myelination, synaptic and 
neuroimmune function, and lipid transport. These findings are also consistent 
with observations of white matter and myelin preservation after Spectris 
treatment of AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: We analyzed changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins in 
response to sensory-evoked gamma oscillations in individuals with mild cognitive 
impairment.Sensory evoked steady-state gamma oscillations were evoked by 
Spectris medical device.Changes in CSF proteins were observed after 8 weeks of 
daily 1 hour treatment.Affected proteins were related to myelination, synaptic 
and neuroimmune functions, and regulation of cellular lipid 
transportation.Proteomic changes support clinical outcomes and myelin 
preservation of Spectris treatment.

INTRODUCTION: We investigated the association between alpha-synuclein (α-syn) 
pathology and brain glucose metabolism across the cognitive spectrum of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) co-pathologies.
METHODS: Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) data from 829 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative participants (648 cognitively 
impaired [CI], 181 unimpaired [CU]) were compared between α-syn seed 
amplification assay (SAA) positive and negative groups. Interactions with 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers were examined.
RESULTS: SAA+ was associated with widespread hypometabolism among CI 
individuals, particularly in posterior cortical regions, independent of CSF 
amyloid and tau levels in the occipital lobes. Regional hypometabolism mediated 
the effect of α-syn SAA on disease severity in CI individuals, independent of 
CSF amyloid and tau levels. There were no influences of SAA on FDG-PET in CU 
individuals.
DISCUSSION: This study supports a model in which α-syn aggregation influences 
metabolic dysfunction, which then influences clinical disease severity, 
independent of AD. SAA+ could help optimize participant selection and outcome 
measures for clinical trials in AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: α-synuclein seed amplification positivity (SAA+) was associated with 
hypometabolism in cognitively impaired individuals. Hypometabolism mediated the 
influence of α-synuclein on disease severity. Occipital hypometabolism in SAA+ 
was independent of cerebrospinal fluid levels of Alzheimer's disease pathology. 
These findings can optimize future clinical trials targeting α-synuclein 
pathology.

INTRODUCTION: No studies in India have explored subjective cognitive decline 
(SCD), a hallmark of stage II of preclinical Alzheimer's disease. This study 
aims to assess the prevalence and correlates of SCD in a South Indian, urban, 
elderly population.
METHODS: We screened 403 individuals 60 years of age and older using the 
Subjective Memory Complaints Questionnaire (SMCQ) and measured objective 
cognition with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Physical health 
parameters were evaluated for all participants.
RESULTS: Among the participants, 377 (93.5%) reported subjective memory 
complaints. Of the 26 individuals without SCD, 15(57.7%) had objective cognitive 
impairment (MoCA <25). A total of 182 participants (45.2%) were identified with 
SCD. Higher educational attainment was significantly associated with fewer SCD 
reports and better cognitive performance (p < 0.001).
DISCUSSION: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is highly prevalent among older 
adults. Screening for SCD can help identify individuals at risk for Alzheimer's 
disease. SCD assessement combined with cost-effective biomarkers that confirms 
AD will help individuals to be identified for disease-modifying therapies.
HIGHLIGHTS: Nearly half of older adults population screened has reported 
subjective cognitive decline (SCD), highlighting the widespread occurrence of 
SCD in urban South India. Participants with higher educational attainment had 
significantly fewer memory complaints and performed better on cognitive 
assessments. SCD was prevalent even among individuals without major comorbid 
conditions such as diabetes and hypertension and those who were on regular 
treatment for metabolic and cardiovascular disorders. Identifying subjective 
cognitive decline (SCD) can facilitate early and accurate diagnosis of cognitive 
disorders and help delay progression to dementia. This highlights the importance 
of developing and implementing improved public health strategies to address 
these challenges. Further longitudinal studies are necessary to explore the 
progression of SCD to dementia, focusing on the interplay between cognitive 
health, biomarkers, and educational factors in the Indian population.

INTRODUCTION: Tau pathology impacts neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), with the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) being among the 
brain regions showing the earliest tau pathology. As a serotonergic hub, DRN 
activity is altered by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which 
also have variable effects on cognitive decline and pathology in AD.
METHODS: We examined N = 191 subjects with baseline 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose 
positron emission tomography and plasma biomarker data to study the effects of 
SSRIs on tau pathology, cognitive decline, and DRN metabolism.
RESULTS: Plasma phosphorylated tau 181 (p-tau181) was lower with SSRI use. The 
effect of SSRIs on cognition varied by cognitive assessment. The DRN was 
hypometabolic in AD patients relative to healthy controls; however, SSRI use 
restored the metabolic activity of this region in AD patients.
DISCUSSION: Long-term SSRI use may reduce the pathological presentation of AD 
but has variable effects on cognitive performance.
HIGHLIGHTS: Tau pathology spreads throughout the brain during AD pathogenesis. 
The DRN is among the first regions to develop tau pathology during this process. 
SSRI use restores the metabolic activity of the DRN and reduces plasma p-tau181.

Lecanemab, the first monoclonal antibody drug targeting amyloid beta (Aβ), was 
approved for slowing the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild 
dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the United States and Japan. On the 
other hand, Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) has been reported in 
clinical trials, and its management and countermeasures remain a clinical issue. 
Given the large number of patients who is indicated of and would benefit from 
this type of AD therapy, physicians prescribing lecanemab should be familiar 
with how to appropriately manage and reduce the risks of ARIA. In this review, 
we outline the imaging characteristics and pathogenesis of ARIA that have 
emerged from the clinical trials and will also discuss risk factors and 
management protocol. (Recieved April 12, 2024; Accepted September 18, 2024;

We evaluated whether drugs approved for other indications that also target 
metabolic drivers of Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD) 
pathogenesis are associated with delayed onset of ADRD. Using routinely 
collected healthcare data from two population-based data sources from the US 
(Medicare) and UK (CPRD), we conducted active comparator, new-user cohort 
studies. Four alternate analytic and design specifications were implemented: (1) 
an as-treated follow-up approach, (2) an as-started follow-up approach 
incorporating a 6-month induction period, (3) incorporating a 6-month symptom to 
diagnosis period to account for misclassification of ADRD onset, and (4) 
identifying ADRD through symptomatic prescriptions and diagnosis codes. Of the 
10 drug pairs evaluated, hydrochlorothiazide vs. dihydropyridine CCBs showed 
meaningful reductions in 3 out of 4 analyses that addressed specific biases 
including informative censoring, reverse causality, and outcome 
misclassification (pooled hazard ratios [95% confidence intervals] across 
Medicare and CPRD: 0.81 [0.75-0.88] in Analysis 1, 0.98 [0.92-1.06] in Analysis 
2, 0.83 [0.75-0.91] in Analysis 3, 0.75 [0.65-0.85] in Analysis 4). Amiloride 
vs. triamterene, although less precise, also suggested a potential reduction in 
risk in 3 out of 4 analyses (0.86 [0.66-1.11] in Analysis 1, 0.98 [0.79-1.23] in 
Analysis 2, 0.74 [0.54-1.00] in Analysis 3, 0.61 [0.36-1.05] in Analysis 4). 
Other analyses suggested likely no major differences in risk (probenecid, 
salbutamol, montelukast, propranolol/carvedilol, and anastrozole) or had limited 
precision precluding a definitive conclusion (semaglutide, ciloztozol, 
levetiracetam). Future replication studies should be considered to validate our 
findings.

Over the past two decades, there has been a growing recognition of the 
physiological importance and pathological implications surrounding the surface 
diffusion of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) and their diffusional trapping at synapses. 
AMPAR surface diffusion entails the thermally powered random Brownian lateral 
movement of these receptors within the plasma membrane, facilitating dynamic 
exchanges between synaptic and extrasynaptic compartments. This process also 
enables the activity-dependent diffusional trapping and accumulation of AMPARs 
at synapses through transient binding to synaptic anchoring slots. Recent 
research highlights the critical role of synaptic recruitment of AMPARs via 
diffusional trapping in fundamental neural processes such as the development of 
the early phases of long-term potentiation (LTP), contextual fear memory, memory 
consolidation, and sensory input-induced cortical remapping. Furthermore, 
studies underscore that regulation of AMPAR diffusional trapping is altered 
across various neurological disease models, including Huntington's disease (HD), 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), and stress-related disorders like depression. Notably, 
pharmacological interventions aimed at correcting deficits in AMPAR diffusional 
trapping have demonstrated efficacy in restoring synapse numbers, LTP, and 
memory functions in these diverse disease models, despite their distinct 
pathogenic mechanisms. This review provides current insights into the molecular 
mechanisms underlying the dysregulation of AMPAR diffusional trapping, 
emphasizing its role as a converging point for multiple pathological signaling 
pathways. We propose that targeting AMPAR diffusional trapping represents a 
promising early therapeutic strategy to mitigate synaptic plasticity and memory 
deficits in a spectrum of brain disorders, encompassing but not limited to HD, 
AD, and stress-related conditions. This approach underscores an integrated 
therapeutic target amidst the complexity of these neurodegenerative and 
neuropsychiatric diseases.

The venom peptides from terrestrial as well as aquatic species have demonstrated 
potential in regulating the NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 
(NLRP3) inflammasome, a sophisticated assemblage present in immune cells 
responsible for detecting and responding to external mediators. The NLRP3 
inflammasome plays a role in several pathological conditions such as type 2 
diabetes, hyperglycemia, Alzheimer's disease, obesity, autoimmune disorders, and 
cardiovascular disorders. Venom peptides derived from animal venoms have been 
discovered to selectively induce certain signalling pathways, such as the NLRP3 
inflammasome, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and nuclear factor 
kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB). Experimental evidence 
has demonstrated that venom peptides can regulate the expression and activation 
of the NLRP3 inflammasome, resulting in the secretion of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines including interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18. Furthermore, these peptides 
have been discovered to impede the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, 
therefore diminishing inflammation and tissue injury. The functional properties 
of venom proteins and peptides obtained from snakes, bees, wasps, and scorpions 
have been thoroughly investigated, specifically targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome 
pathway, venom proteins and peptides have shown promise as therapeutic agents 
for the treatment of certain inflammatory disorders. This review discusses the 
pathophysiology of NLRP3 inflammasome in the onset of various diseases, role of 
venom as therapeutics. Further, various venom components and their role in the 
modulation of NLRP3 inflammasome are discoursed. A substantial number of 
venomous animals and their toxins are yet unexplored, and to comprehensively 
grasp the mechanisms of action of them and their potential as therapeutic 
agents, additional research is required which can lead to the development of 
novel therapeutics.

The FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP51) is an important regulator of 
glucocorticoid receptor activity and an Hsp90 cochaperone. FKBP51 has previously 
been identified as a drug target due to its roles in stress-related disorders 
and pain tolerance. Two recent publications in Cell Stress and Chaperones 
further explore FKBP51 functions. To understand whether FKBP51 plays a role in 
sleep disturbances linked to stress disorders, one study examined the role of 
FKBP51 in regulating the circadian rhythm. Broadening the range of Hsp90 
cochaperone function, the other article summarized the role of multiple 
cochaperones in Alzheimer's disease, discussing how cochaperones affect both Aβ 
and tau. They emphasize the role of FKBP51 in promoting tau pathogenesis and 
discuss the small molecule LA1011, which binds Hsp90 and competes with 
Hsp90-FKBP51 interaction. Further studies with LA1011 may lead to new treatments 
for Alzheimer's disease and will help clarify the contributions of FKBP51 to 
human disorders.

Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), including Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and multiple 
sclerosis (MS), arise from complex interactions between genetic factors, 
environmental exposures, and aging. Additionally, gut dysbiosis has been linked 
to systemic inflammation and neurodegeneration. Advances in microbiome and 
metabolome profiling techniques have provided deeper insights into how 
alterations in gut microbiota and dietary patterns affect metabolic pathways and 
contribute to the progression of NDs. This review explores the profiles of gut 
microbiome and metabolome derived biomarkers and their roles in NDs. Across 
phyla, families, and genera, we identified 55 microbial alterations in PD, 24 in 
AD, 4 in ALS, and 17 in MS. Some notable results include an increase in 
Akkermansia in PD, AD, and MS and a decrease in short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) 
in PD and AD. We examined the effects of probiotics, prebiotics, fecal 
microbiota transplants (FMT), sleep, exercise, and diet on the microbiota, all 
of which contributed to delayed onset and alleviation of symptoms. Further, 
artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms applied to 
omics data have been crucial in identifying novel therapeutic targets, 
diagnosing and predicting prognosis, and enabling personalized medicine using 
microbiota-modulating therapies in NDs patients.

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a class of transmembrane proteins that 
distribute in various organs extensively. They can regulate physiological 
functions such as perception, neurotransmission and endocrinology through the 
synergies of signaling pathways. At present, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
have approved more than 500 drugs targeting GPCRs to treat a variety of 
conditions, including neurological diseases, gastrointestinal diseases and 
tumors. Conformational diversity and dynamic changes make GPCRs a star target 
for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, GPCRs can also open 
biased signaling pathways for G protein and β-arrestin, which has unique 
functional selectivity and the possibility of overcoming side effects. Some 
studies believe that biased drugs will be the mainstream direction of drug 
innovation in the future. To disclose the essential role and research process of 
GPCRs in neurodegenerative diseases, we firstly reviewed several pivotal GPCRs 
and their mediated signaling pathways in Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's 
disease (PD) and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Then we focused on the 
biased signaling pathway of GPCRs in these diseases. Finally, we updated the 
GPCR drugs under research for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases in the 
clinical trials or approval. This review could provide valuable targets for 
precision therapy to cope with the dysfunction of neurodegenerative diseases in 
the future.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), the leading cause of dementia, affects 1 in 9 people 
aged 65 and older. The disease impacts patients on multiple levels, from memory 
and problem-solving issues to difficulties with basic functions and personality 
changes. Unfortunately, there is only a handful of FDA-approved drugs, and none 
of them offer an effective cure. Therefore, recent strategies have focused on 
preventing and delaying disease onset, rather than curing already developed 
pathological changes in the brain. In this study, we investigated the 
therapeutic potential of carnosine (CAR), a naturally occurring dipeptide known 
for its multimodal mechanism of action, such as the ability to mitigate 
neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and deficiencies in neurotropic factors, 
all of which are connected with aging-related cognitive decline and an increased 
risk of developing dementia. For this purpose, we utilized an okadaic 
acid-induced zebrafish model of AD, which replicates some of the key features of 
the disease, including hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, changes in 
Aβ-fragments, and cognitive decline. By employing a latent learning behavioral 
assay and fast-scan cyclic voltammetry, we evaluated the effect of CAR on the 
prevention of cognitive decline and neurochemical changes in the AD-like 
zebrafish brain. Our findings revealed that CAR prevents impaired learning and 
motor dysfunction in a sex-dependent manner and reduces anxiety-like behavior. 
Additionally, we found that CAR inhibits dopamine release impairment. Hence, our 
study demonstrates the potential of CAR as a promising candidate for further 
investigations focused on identifying molecules that could potentially serve as 
therapeutics for delaying the onset of AD.

The effectiveness of robot-assisted board games targeting older adults with mild 
cognitive impairment was investigated to improve their cognitive function, 
general self-efficacy, and life satisfaction and reduce depression. A 
quasiexperimental research design was adopted with 109 older adults from 8 
long-term care facilities and day-care centers assigned to the experimental (n = 
52) and comparison groups (n = 57). The experimental group underwent a 12-week 
cognitive training program. Both groups completed before-and-after and 3-month 
follow-up measurements for outcome variables, including cognitive function 
(scores of mini-mental state examination [MMSE] and Alzheimer's Disease 
Assessment Scale Cognitive Subscale [ADAS-Cog]), depression, general 
self-efficacy, and life satisfaction. The data were analyzed using the 
generalized estimating equation (GEE). The program's usability was assessed 
using the system usability scale (SUS). The GEE analyses revealed significant 
postintervention improvements in the experimental group's MMSE, ADAS-Cog, 
depression, general self-efficacy, and satisfaction with life scores. These 
effects persisted for the 3-month follow-up. The mean SUS score was 87.50, 
indicating the feasibility of robot-assisted interventions among older adults. 
These findings confirmed that interactive robot-assisted board games can improve 
cognitive function, general self-efficacy, and life satisfaction and reduce 
depression among older adults. The administration of long-term care facilities 
or day-care centers can adopt robot-assisted board games as a training tool to 
supplement health promotion activities to prevent cognitive deterioration and 
enhance mental health among older adults.

The involvement of the neocortex in memory processes depends on neuronal 
plasticity, the ability to restructure inter-neuronal connections, which is 
essential for learning and long-term memory. Understanding these mechanisms is 
crucial for advancing early diagnosis and treatment of cognitive disorders such 
as Parkinson's, epilepsy, and Alzheimer's disease. This study explores a 
neuronal model with expanded populations, using information-theoretic cues to 
uncover dynamics underlying plasticity. By employing Bandt-Pompe's 
entropy-complexity (H×C) and Fisher entropy-information (H×F) planes, hidden 
patterns in neuronal activity are revealed. These methodologies are particularly 
suitable for analyzing nonlinear dynamics and causal relationships in time 
series. In addition, the Hénon map is applied to capture nonlinear behaviors, 
such as neural firing, highlighting the trade-off between stability and 
unpredictability in neural networks. Our approach integrates local field 
potential and intracranial electroencephalograms' data in multiple frequency 
bands, connecting computational models with experimental evidence. By addressing 
higher-order interactions, such as action potential triplets, this work advances 
the understanding of synaptic adjustments and their implications for neuronal 
complexity and cognitive disorders.

PURPOSE: The study investigates patient perspectives on the use of 
Preimplantation Genetic Testing for Polygenic disease (PGT-P) to select embryos 
with lower risks for common polygenic diseases. Participant responses and 
attitudes were evaluated after receiving simulated embryo PRS generated from 
their personal genetic profile.
METHODS: Couples seeking OB/GYN or Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility 
(REI) care with an interest in genetic risks for common diseases in their 
prospective children participated. A tool provided PRS scores for 11 conditions, 
using parental DNA to simulate genetic risks for hypothetical embryos produced 
during IVF. Participants received counseling, reviewed results online, and 
completed a post-test survey. Feedback from 90 participants assessed 
understanding and attitudes toward PRS use in IVF.
RESULTS: Participants were overall more supportive of screening embryos for 
childhood-onset diseases (80%) compared to adult-onset conditions (63%); 
however, among specific diseases, participants expressed the greatest interest 
in screening for adult-onset cognitive disorders (Schizophrenia, 86%, 
Alzheimer's disease, 82%). Participant-free responses noted the importance of 
personalized counseling and participants not of European ancestry expressed 
frustration with limited PRS applicability. Negative reactions to testing 
(nervousness or anxiety 5%, regret 2%) were explored.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings examine the receipt of simulated embryo PRS in a 
patient population in which support for using PRS during embryo prioritization 
is high. Positive patient interest was consistent with other US studies; as 
prior studies identify significant clinician discomfort, these results highlight 
the need for comprehensive genetic counseling and inclusive stakeholder input in 
shaping guidelines for PRS during IVF.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. Characterized by 
progressive neurodegeneration, AD typically begins with mild cognitive decline 
escalating to severe impairment in communication and responsiveness. It 
primarily affects cerebral regions responsible for cognition, memory, and 
language processing, significantly impeding the functional independence of 
patients. With nearly 50 million dementia cases worldwide, a number expected to 
triple by 2050, the need for effective treatments is more urgent than ever. 
Recent insights into the association between obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, 
and neurodegenerative disorders have led to the development of promising 
treatments involving antidiabetic and anti-obesity agents. One such novel 
promising candidate for addressing AD pathology is a lipidized analogue of 
anorexigenic peptide called prolactin-releasing peptide (palm11-PrRP31). 
Interestingly, anorexigenic and orexigenic peptides have opposite effects on 
food intake regulation, however, both types exhibit neuroprotective properties. 
Recent studies have also identified ghrelin, an orexigenic peptide, as a 
potential neuroprotective agent. Hence, we employed both anorexigenic and 
orexigenic compounds to investigate the common mechanisms underpinning their 
neuroprotective effects in a triple transgenic mouse model of AD (3xTg-AD mouse 
model) combining amyloid-beta (Aβ) pathology and Tau pathology, two hallmarks of 
AD. We treated 3xTg-AD mice for 4 months with two stable lipidized anorexigenic 
peptide analogues - palm11-PrRP31, and liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 
(GLP-1) analogue - as well as Dpr3-ghrelin, a stable analogue of the orexigenic 
peptide ghrelin, and using the method of immunohistochemistry and western blot 
demonstrate the effects of these compounds on the development of AD-like 
pathology in the brain. Palm11-PrRP31, Dpr3-ghrelin, and liraglutide reduced 
intraneuronal deposits of Aβ plaque load in the hippocampi and amygdalae of 
3xTg-AD mice. Palm11-PrRP31 and Dpr3-ghrelin reduced microgliosis in the 
hippocampi, amygdalae, and cortices of 3xTg-AD mice. Palm11-PrRP31 and 
liraglutide reduced astrocytosis in the amygdalae of 3xTg-AD mice. We propose 
that these peptides are involved in reducing inflammation, a common mechanism 
underlying their therapeutic effects. This is the first study to demonstrate 
improvements in AD pathology following the administration of both orexigenic and 
anorexigenic compounds, highlighting the therapeutic potential of food 
intake-regulating peptides in neurodegenerative disorders.

Neurodegenerative diseases raise public health concerns. Recent evidence 
indicates that Alzheimer's disease (AD) sufferers will triple by 2050. The 
rising incidence of dementia diagnoses raises concerns about the 
socio-economical and emotional impact of this uncurable illness, which reduces 
quality of life through cognitive decline. Although genetic and environmental 
factors may contribute to its aetiology, neuropathological mechanisms underlying 
these disorders are still under investigation. One is brain insulin resistance 
(BIR), which has been associated with clinical cognitive dysfunction and linked 
to mitochondrial dysfunction, neurogenesis deficits, and cell death. Not limited 
to neurodegeneration, these phenotypes have been associated with other 
neuropsychiatric disorders. Streptozotocin (STZ), a diabetes-causing drug that 
targets pancreatic β-cells, may imitate BIR in suitable models. From patients' 
neuroimaging to in vitro approaches, scientists have been striving to understand 
the pathophysiology of such disorders at the behavioural, molecular, and 
cellular levels. Although animal models are useful for studying insulin 
resistance's systemic effects, in vitro phenotypic research represents an 
alternative to study molecular and cellular aspects. STZ and hypoglycaemia-like 
scenarios have been successful for studying neurodegenerative disorders in 
primary cell culture (e.g., neuroblastoma cells) and patient-specific neural 
cell lines derived from pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Intriguingly, STZ 
treatment or hypoglycaemia-like conditions in a dish were able to induce AD 
pathological characteristics such Aβ plaque deposition and Tau protein 
hyperphosphorylation. Such approaches have shown potential in understanding 
molecular and cellular implications of metabolic changes in neuropsychiatric 
disorders, according to this review. Furthermore, these models may help identify 
novel treatment targets.

Dual-functional peptides exhibiting both anti-amyloid and antimicrobial 
activities have attracted attention as promising candidates for Alzheimer's 
disease treatment. The advantage of these peptides lies in their ability to 
simultaneously target both the amyloid cascade hypothesis and the microbial 
infection hypothesis, in contrast to single-function inhibitors. However, most 
of the reported dual-functional peptides to date are natural peptides, and the 
development of synthetic peptides in this area remains limited. In this study, 
we propose two strategies to aid in the discovery of synthetic dual-functional 
peptides. We then report four distinct synthetic dual-functional peptides 
identified using these strategies, with the Aβ1-40/Aβ1-42 fibrillation system 
and common bacterial strains serving as a proof-of-concept platform. One 
strategy involves repurposing existing knowledge, while the other breaks from 
established conventions. Using the first strategy, we discovered a very short 
dual-functional linear peptide. With the second strategy, we identified a simple 
dual-functional cyclic peptide. Furthermore, by combining these two strategies, 
we developed a hybrid dual-functional peptide incorporating both linear and 
cyclic structures. We hope that our findings will contribute to the future 
discovery of more synthetic dual-functional peptides for treating Alzheimer's 
disease.

Sodium channels are necessary for electrical activity in modules of the nervous 
system. When such channels fail to work properly, it may cause different 
neurological diseases. This review will discuss how particular mutation in these 
channels leads to different diseases. Positive alterations can lead to such 
diseases as epilepsy, or any muscle disorder due to over activation of neurons. 
Conversely, loss-of-function mutations may cause heart diseases and problems 
regarding motor and mental activity since neurons are not functioning well 
because of lost machinery. The review would discuss over familiar 
channelopathies such as genetic epilepsies, the familial hemiplegic migraine, 
and Para myotonia congenital and relatively new interrelations with the complex 
ailments including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and multiple sclerosis. Thus, 
knowledge of these mechanisms is important in designing specific therapeutic 
approaches. There is a rationale for altering the sodium channel activity in the 
treatment of these neurological disorders by drugs or indeed genetic methods. 
Thus, the review is undertaken to provide clear distinctions and discuss the 
issues related to sodium channel mutations for the potential development of 
individualized medicine. The review also gives information on the function and 
general distribution of voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs), how their 
activity is controlled, and what their structure is like. The purpose therefore 
is to draw understanding over the apparently multifaceted functions exerted by 
VGSCs in the nervous system relative to several diseases. This knowledge is 
imperative in the attempt to produce treatments for these disabling disorders.

INTRODUCTION: Memory loss and cognitive decline are prominent symptoms of 
various neurodegenerative diseases, impacting daily activities and posing a 
significant burden on healthcare systems. The study aimed to explore the effect 
of barbigerone against LPS-induced memory impairment in rats and may offer novel 
therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases.
METHODS: A total of 30 male Wistar rats were utilized and subsequently divided 
into five distinct experimental groups: group I received saline as a control, 
group II- received LPS, group III - received LPS, and barbigerone (10 
mg/kg/p.o.), group IV- received LPS and a higher dose of barbigerone (20 
mg/kg/p.o.), and group V -barbigerone alone (20 mg/kg/p.o.). Behavioural test 
was performed through the Morris water maze (MWM) and Y-maze test. Biochemical 
markers such as oxidative, proinflammatory, apoptotic, and further molecular 
docking and simulations elucidate the mechanisms of barbigerone effects.
RESULTS: Barbigerone significantly improved the learning capacity of rats in 
both the MWM and Y-maze tests, indicating enhanced memory and reduced latency 
times. Furthermore, barbigerone exhibited beneficial effects on oxidative stress 
and inflammation markers, suggesting its potential to protect against neuronal 
damage and promote cognitive function. Based on molecular docking, barbigerone 
showed a greater binding affinity with different intermolecular interactions; 
among them, NF-KB (ISVC) had the most potent interaction. Molecular dynamics 
simulations were performed to assess the stability and convergence of complexes 
formed by Barbigerone with 1NME_ Barbigerone, 1SVC_Barbigerone, and 4AQ3 
4AQ3_Barbigerone.
CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that barbigerone possesses neuronal 
protective effects against LPS-induced memory deficits in rats by restoring 
endogenous antioxidant and pro-inflammatory cytokines.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), a degenerative disease of the central nervous system, 
affects approximately 70 million individuals worldwide. As the number of elderly 
in the population increases, the prevalence and incidence of AD are increasing 
annually. Although the drugs are currently used to alleviate certain cognitive 
symptoms, their overall therapeutic efficacy remains unclear. Consequently, 
there is significant societal demand for safe and effective therapeutic options. 
Icaritin (ICT), a bioactive compound derived from Epimedium brevicornu Maxim, 
has anti-apoptotic, antioxidant, anti-neuroinflammatory, anti-aging, and 
neuroprotective properties. In recent years, it has garnered significant 
interest because of its potential preventative and therapeutic effects in the 
context of AD. In this review, we analyze the therapeutic effects of ICT on AD, 
namely the inhibition of neuroinflammation, effects against oxidative stress and 
apoptosis, and promotion of cellular autophagy. The aim of this review was to 
provide a general reference for the research and development of new drugs, in 
particular ICT, for the prevention and treatment of AD.

A major goal in Alzheimer disease (AD) research is the reduction of the abnormal 
tau burden. Using multispectral analyses on brain tissues from humans who died 
of AD it was documented that neurons with hyperphosphorylated tau protein 
accumulate many proteins of the BCL2 family, including those that block cell 
turnover (eg, BCL2, MCL1, BCLXL) and those that promote cell turnover (eg, NOXA, 
PUMA, BAK, BAX). A mouse model of AD with the humanized hyperphosphorylated tau 
protein was used to test the hypothesis that shifting this balance to a pro-cell 
turnover milieu would reduce the tau burden with concomitant clinical 
improvement. Here, we show that a mouse model of AD with death at 11 to 15 
months due to CNS tauopathy had a marked reduction in the tau burden after 
treatment with the FDA-approved drug venetoclax, which blocks BCL2. The 
reduction of the number of target neurons positive for hyperphosphorylated tau 
protein after venetoclax treatment in the brain and spinal cord neurons was 
94.5% as determined by immunohistochemistry and 98.1% as documented with the 
modified Bielchowsky stain. The venetoclax treatment began after documented 
neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) were evident and there was a concomitant 
reduction in neuroinflammation. The treated mice were robust until sacrificed at 
13 months as compared with the untreated mice that showed unequivocal evidence 
of brain and spinal cord damage both clinically and at autopsy. We conclude that 
otherwise inexorable abnormal tau protein deposition, even after initiation, can 
be prevented by a drug that blocks one anti-cell turnover protein abundant in 
the NFTs of human AD.

In spite of great advances in modern medicine, there are a few effective 
strategies for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases characterised by 
neuron loss or degeneration. This results from complex pathogenesis of the 
diseases and the limited drug uptake of the brain due to the presence of 
blood-brain barrier. Nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems are expected to 
improve the drug utilisation. Polymeric nanoparticles represent promising drug 
delivery carriers to the brain due to their unique advantages such as good 
biodegradability and biocompatibility, flexibility in surface modification and 
nontoxicity. In addition, the delivery of genetic drugs may stop the progression 
of neurodegenerative diseases at the genetic level and even avoid the 
irreversible damage in the central nervous system. In this review, an overview 
of studies on polymer-based nanoparticles for drug delivery to the central 
nervous system in typical neurodegenerative diseases, especially Alzheimer's 
diseases and Parkinson's diseases, is described. Meanwhile, their applications 
in gene delivery in these disorders are discussed. And the challenges and future 
perspectives for the development of polymeric nanoparticles as drug delivery 
carriers in neurodegenerative diseases are concluded.

INTRODUCTION: For over a decade, AMPA receptor allosteric potentiators 
(AMPAkines) have shown significant effectiveness in multiple preclinical studies 
related to neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders underpinned by deficient 
excitatory synaptic activity. Despite promising preclinical evidence, the 
clinical translation of AMPAkines has been slow due to the propensity of some of 
these compounds to produce seizures at or around therapeutic doses.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The preclinical activity of the AMPAkine CX1837 is 
disclosed in the current work.
RESULTS: CX1837 enhanced synaptic transmission in hippocampal slices in vitro 
and dose-dependently enhanced long-term potentiation, which is believed to 
control memory consolidation. CX1837 boosted performance in cognition tests, 
such as the novel object recognition test and the win-shift radial arm maze. 
CX1837 also increased attentional functioning in the 5-choice serial reaction 
time task in rats. CX1837 produced positive preclinical effects at 0.01-1.0 
mg/kg dose and elicited epileptic effects at 10 mg/kg dose.
DISCUSSION: CX1837 has one of the largest safety margins to date in preclinical 
studies. Low doses of CX1837, which produce acute increases in cognition, may 
potentially increase neurotrophins when given chronically. This could slow the 
progression of Alzheimer's disease and reverse deficits secondary to ischemic 
stroke.
CONCLUSION: Together, our findings highlight CX1837 as a potential candidate for 
clinical development in order to treat multiple neurodegenerative and 
psychiatric disorders.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the leading causes of cognitive decline, 
which leads to dementia and poses significant challenges for its therapy. The 
reason is primarily the ineffective available treatments targeting the 
underlying pathology of AD. It is a neurodegenerative disease that is mainly 
characterised by the various molecular pathways contributing to its complex 
pathology, including extracellular amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques, intracellular 
neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. One of 
the crucial features is the hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins, which is 
facilitated by microtubule affinity-regulating kinase-4 (MARK-4). The kinase 
plays a crucial role in the disease development by modifying microtubule 
integrity, leading to neuronal dysfunction and death. MARK-4 is thus a druggable 
target and has a pivotal role in AD. Amongst MARK-4 inhibitors, 16 compounds 
demonstrate significant capacity in molecular docking studies, showing high 
binding affinity to MARK-4 and promising potential for tau inhibition. Further, 
in-vitro investigations provide evidence of their neuroprotective properties. 
The present review mainly focuses on the role of MARK-4 and its potential 
inhibitors used in treating AD, which have been thoroughly investigated in 
silico and in vitro..

INTRODUCTION: The rapid growth of mobile phone use and internet access among 
older adults can provide valuable opportunities for clinicians and researchers 
to incorporate these technologies into the memory rehabilitation of patients 
with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Building on this opportunity, previous research 
has used smartphone calendar applications to cue prospective memory in patients 
with AD. However, in these studies, the calendar has been programmed to send 
cues only about the time of prospective events.
METHODS: We investigated the benefits of the smartphone calendar applications 
sending notifications about both the time and location of the prospective 
events. We recruited two groups. In the first group (time-and-location-cued 
group), we configured smartphone-based calendars to send notifications about the 
time and location of prospective events, while in the second group (time-cued 
group), we configured smartphone-based calendars to send notifications only 
about the time of prospective events. In both groups, we invited patients to 
attend three prospective events per week during a three-week period.
RESULTS: The results demonstrated fewer omissions in the time- and location-cued 
group than in the time-cued group.
CONCLUSION: Providing patients with AD with several contextual cues through 
smartphone-based calendars may result in better prospective performance than 
providing them with only one contextual cue.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder 
for which no effective cure currently exists. Research has identified 
β-Secretase (BACE1) as a promising therapeutic target for the management of AD. 
BACE1 is involved in the rate-limiting step and produces toxic amyloid-beta (Aβ) 
peptides that lead to deposits in the form of amyloid plaques extracellularly, 
resulting in AD.
METHOD: In this connection, 60 small peptides were evaluated for their in-silico 
studies to predict the bonding orientation with BACE1. Next, 5 peptides (12, 20, 
21, 51, and 52) were selected based on high scoring of Vander Waal interactions 
with the catalytic site of the enzyme.
RESULTS: The identified hit peptides were synthesized using Solid-Phase Peptide 
Synthesis (SPPS), and Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (ESI-MS) 
elucidated their structures and 1 1 HNMR spectroscopy. According to their 
In-vitro BACE1 inhibitory study, peptides 21 having high Vander Waal forces 
showed significant BACE1 inhibition with IC50 = 4.64 ± 0.1μM). Moreover, the 
kinetic study revealed that peptide 21 is a mixed-type inhibitor and can 
interact at the active site and the allosteric site of BACE1.
CONCLUSION: According to the cytotoxicity study, peptide 21 was found to be 
noncytotoxic at 4.64 μM, 10 μM and 20 μM. The forthcoming target of this study 
is to evaluate further the effect of peptide 21 in an in-vivo mice model.
