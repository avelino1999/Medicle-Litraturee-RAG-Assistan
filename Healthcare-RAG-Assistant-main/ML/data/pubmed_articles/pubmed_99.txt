A series of scutellarein 7-l-amino acid carbamate-4'-cycloalkylamine propyl 
ether conjugates were designed and synthesized for the first time as 
multifunctional agents for Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapy. The designed 
compounds exhibited more balanced and effective multi-target potency. Among 
them, compound 11l, l-Valine carbamate derivative of scutellarein 
cycloheptylamine ether, exhibited the most potent inhibition of electric eel 
AChE enzymes and human AChE enzymes, with an IC50 values of 7.04 μM and 9.73 μM, 
respectively. Moreover, 11l exhibited more potent H3R antagonistic activities 
than clobenpropit, with an IC50 value of 1.09 nM. Compound 11l not only 
displayed excellent inhibition of self- and Cu2+-induced Aβ1-42 aggregation 
(95.48 % and 88.63 % inhibition, respectively) but also induced the disassembly 
of self- and Cu2+-induced Aβ fibrils (80.16 % and 89.30 % disaggregation, 
respectively). Moreover, 11l significantly reduced tau protein 
hyperphosphorylation induced by Aβ25-35. It exhibited effective antioxidant 
activity and neuroprotective potency, and inhibited RSL3-induced PC12 cell 
ferroptosis. Assays of hCMEC/D3 and hPepT1-MDCK cell line permeability indicated 
that 11l would have optimal blood-brain barrier permeability and intestinal 
absorption characteristics. In addition, in vivo studies revealed that compound 
11l significantly attenuated learning and memory impairment in an AD mouse 
model. Finally, a pharmacokinetic characterization of 11l indicated favorable 
druggability and pharmacokinetic properties. Taken together, our results suggest 
that 11l is a potential candidate for AD treatment and merits further 
investigation.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive degenerative neurological condition 
characterized by cognitive decline, primarily affecting memory and logical 
thinking, attributed to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in the brain, 
leading to neuronal loss and brain atrophy. Neuroinflammation, a hallmark of AD, 
involves the activation of microglia and astrocytes in response to pathological 
changes, potentially exacerbating neuronal damage. The gut-brain axis is a 
bidirectional communication pathway between the gastrointestinal and central 
nervous systems, crucial for maintaining brain health. Phytochemicals, natural 
compounds found in plants with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, 
such as flavonoids, curcumin, resveratrol, and quercetin, have emerged as 
potential modulators of this axis, suggesting implications for AD prevention. 
Intake of phytochemicals influences the gut microbial composition and its 
metabolites, thereby impacting neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in the 
brain. Consumption of phytochemical-rich foods may promote a healthy gut 
microbiota, fostering the production of anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective 
substances. Early dietary incorporation of phytochemicals offers a non-invasive 
strategy for modulating the gut-brain axis and potentially reducing AD risk or 
delaying its onset. The exploration of interventions targeting the gut-brain 
axis through phytochemical intake represents a promising avenue for the 
development of preventive or therapeutic strategies against AD initiation and 
progression.

Comprehending the Efficacy of Whitlock's Caffeine-Pincered Molecular Tweezer on 
β-Amyloid Aggregation.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) stands as one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative 
conditions, leading to cognitive impairment, with no cure and preventive 
measures. Misfolding and aberrant aggregation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides are 
believed to be the underlying cause of AD. These amyloid aggregates culminate in 
the development of toxic Aβ oligomers and subsequent accumulation of β-amyloid 
plaques amidst neuronal cells in the brain, marking the hallmarks of AD. Drug 
development for the potentially curative treatment of Alzheimer's is, therefore, 
a tremendous challenge for the scientific community. In this study, we 
investigate the potency of Whitlock's caffeine-armed molecular tweezer in 
combating the deleterious effects of Aβ aggregation, with special emphasis on 
the seven residue Aβ16-22 fragment. Extensive all-atom molecular dynamics 
simulations are conducted to probe the various structural and conformational 
transitions of the peptides in an aqueous medium in both the presence and 
absence of tweezers. To explore the specifics of peptide-tweezer interactions, 
radial distribution functions, contact number calculations, binding free 
energies, and 2-D kernel density plots depicting the variation of distance-angle 
between the aromatic planes of the peptide-tweezer pair are computed. The 
central hydrophobic core, particularly the aromatic Phe residues, is crucial in 
the development of harmful amyloid oligomers. Notably, all analyses indicate 
reduced interpeptide interactions in the presence of the tweezer, which is 
attributed to the tweezer-Phe aromatic interaction. Upon increasing the tweezer 
concentration, the residues of the peptide are further encased in a hydrophobic 
environment created by the self-aggregating tweezer cluster, leading to the 
segregation of the peptide residues. This is further aided by the weakening of 
interstrand hydrogen bonding between the peptides, thereby impeding their 
self-aggregation and preventing the formation of neurotoxic β-amyloid. 
Furthermore, the study also highlights the efficacy of the molecular tweezer in 
destabilizing preformed amyloid fibrils as well as hindering the aggregation of 
the full-length Aβ1-42 peptide.

BACKGROUND: With disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
prognostic tools for the pre-dementia stage are needed. This study aimed to 
evaluate the prognostic value of an 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission 
tomography (18F-FDG-PET)-based deep-learning (DL) model in the pre-dementia 
stage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and normal cognition (NC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 18F-FDG-PET-based DL model was developed to classify 
diagnosis of AD-dementia vs NC using AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and 
Japanese-ADNI (J-ADNI) datasets (n = 756), which provided the degree of 
similarity to AD-dementia. The prognostic value of the DL output for cognitive 
decline was assessed in the ADNI MCI (n = 663), J-ADNI MCI (n = 129), and 
Harvard Aging Brain Study (HABS) NC (n = 274) participants using Cox regression 
and calculating the integrated area under the time-dependent ROC curves (iAUC), 
along with clinical information and 18F-FDG-PET standardized uptake value ratio 
(SUVR). Subgroup analysis in the amyloid-positive ADNI MCI participants was 
performed using Cox regression and calculating the area under the time-dependent 
ROC (tdAUC) curves at 4-year follow-up to assess prognostic value of DL output 
over clinical information, 18F-FDG-PET SUVR, and amyloid PET Centiloids.
RESULTS: DL output remained independently prognostic among other factors in all 
three datasets (P < .05 for all by Cox regression). By adding DL output to other 
prognostic factors, prediction significantly improved in ADNI-MCI (iAUC 
differences 0.020 [0.007-0.034] before and after adding DL output) and improved 
without statistical significance in J-ADNI (0.020 [-0.005 to 0.044], and HABS-NC 
sets (0.059 [-0.003 to 0.126]). DL output showed independent (P = .002 by Cox 
regression) and significant added prognostic value (tdROC difference 0.019 
[<0.001-0.036]) over clinical information, 18F-FDG-PET SUVR, and Centiloids in 
the amyloid-positive ADNI MCI participants.
CONCLUSION: The 18F-FDG-PET-based DL model demonstrated the potential to improve 
cognitive decline prediction beyond clinical information, and conventional 
measures from 18F-FDG-PET and amyloid PET and may prove useful for clinical 
trial recruitment and individualized management.

INTRODUCTION: GB-5001 is an intramuscular (IM) formulation of donepezil under 
development for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The objective of this 
study was to develop a population pharmacokinetic (PK) model for donepezil in 
both IM and oral formulations, and to optimize the IM dosage of GB-5001 using 
bioequivalence (BE) simulation.
METHODS: A population PK model of donepezil was developed using NONMEM. It was 
based on plasma concentration data from a Phase 1 dose escalation study, which 
involved a single administration of donepezil IM formulation at doses of 70, 
140, and 280 mg, and the oral formulation at 10 mg. The model was evaluated 
based on goodness-of-fit plots, conditional weighted residuals, visual 
predictive checks, and bootstrapping. BE simulations were conducted using a 
parallel design between various doses of the IM formulation and the 10-mg dose 
of oral formulation.
RESULTS: The PKs of donepezil were best described by a two-compartment model, 
which incorporated distinct absorption compartments for the IM (dual first-order 
absorption and simultaneous zero-order absorption with lag time) and oral 
(first-order absorption with lag time) formulations. Based on the simulation 
results, an IM dosage range of 210-215 mg in a sample size of over 92 was 
estimated to achieve a success rate of approximately 80% for BE.
CONCLUSION: The population PK model well explained the PKs of donepezil 
following administration of both the IM and oral formulations. This model could 
be applied for the design and dose selection of future BE trials.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and irreversible neurological 
condition that occurs with age and poses a significant global public health 
concern, is distinguished by the degeneration of neurons and synapses in various 
regions of the brain. While the exact processes behind the neurodegeneration in 
AD are not completely known, it is now acknowledged that inflammation may have a 
significant impact on the beginning and advancement of AD neurodegeneration. The 
severity of many neurological illnesses can be influenced by the equilibrium 
between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators. The IL-1 family of 
cytokines is linked to innate immune responses, which are present in both acute 
inflammation and chronic inflammatory diseases. Research on the role of the IL-1 
family in chronic neurological disease has been concentrated on AD. In this 
context, there is indirect evidence suggesting its involvement in the 
development of the disease. This review aims to provide a summary of the 
contribution of every IL-1 family member in AD pathogenesis, current 
immunotherapies in AD disease, and present treatment possibilities for either 
targeting or boosting these cytokines.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a condition in the brain that is marked by a gradual 
and ongoing reduction in memory, thought, and the ability to perform simple 
tasks. AD has a poor prognosis but no cure yet. Therefore, the need for novel 
models to study its pathogenesis and therapeutic strategies is evident, as the 
brain poorly recovers after injury and neurodegenerative diseases and can 
neither replace dead neurons nor reinnervate target structures. Recently, 
mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), particularly those from the human olfactory 
mucous membrane referred to as the olfactory ecto-MSCs (OE-MSCs), have emerged 
as a potential avenue to explore in modeling AD and developing therapeutics for 
the disease due to their lifelong regeneration potency and facile accessibility. 
This review provides a comprehensive summary of the current literature on 
isolating OE-MSCs and delves into whether they could be reliable models for 
studying AD pathogenesis. It also explores whether healthy individual-derived 
OE-MSCs could be therapeutic agents for the disease. Despite being a promising 
tool in modeling and developing therapies for AD, some significant issues 
remain, which are also discussed in the review.

Two-thirds of Americans with Alzheimer's disease are women, indicating a 
profound variance between the sexes. Variances exist between the sexes in the 
age and intensity of the presentation, cognitive deficits, neuroinflammatory 
factors, structural and functional brain changes, as well as psychosocial and 
cultural circumstances. Herein, we summarize the existing evidence for sexual 
dimorphism and present the available evidence for these distinctions. 
Understanding these complexities is critical to developing personalized 
interventions for the prevention, care, and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

In the pathological process of Alzheimer's disease, neuronal cell death is 
closely related to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Our previous 
studies have found that oxidative stress can activate microtubule 
affinity-regulating kinases, resulting in elevated phosphorylation levels of tau 
protein specifically at the Ser262 residue in N1E-115 cells that have been 
subjected to exposure to hydrogen peroxide. This process may be one of the 
pathogenic mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease. Vitamin E is a fat-soluble, 
naturally occurring antioxidant that plays a crucial role in biological systems. 
This study aimed to examine the probable processes that contribute to the 
inhibiting effect on the abnormal phosphorylation of tau protein and the 
neuroprotective activity of a particular type of vitamin E, α-tocotrienol. The 
experimental analysis revealed that α-tocotrienol showed significant 
neuroprotective effects in the N1E-115 cell line. Our data further suggest that 
one of the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of α-tocotrienol 
may be through the inhibition of microtubule affinity-regulated kinase 
activation, which significantly reduces the oxidative stress-induced aberrant 
elevation of p-Tau (Ser262) levels. These results indicate that α-tocotrienol 
may represent an intriguing strategy for treating or preventing Alzheimer's 
disease.

With the rapid progress in deciphering the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), it has been widely accepted that the accumulation of misfolded amyloid β 
(Aβ) in the brain could cause the neurodegeneration in AD. Although much 
evidence demonstrates the neurotoxicity of Aβ, the role of Aβ in the nervous 
system are complex. However, more comprehensive studies are needed to understand 
the physiological effect of Aβ40 monomers in depth. To explore the physiological 
mechanism of Aβ, we employed mass spectrometry to investigate the altered 
proteomic events induced by a lower submicromolar concentration of Aβ. Human 
neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were exposed to five different concentrations of 
Aβ1-40 monomers and collected at four time points. The proteomic analysis 
revealed the time-course behavior of proteins involved in biological processes, 
such as RNA splicing, nuclear transport and protein localization. Further 
biological studies indicated that Aβ40 monomers may activate PI3K/AKT signaling 
to regulate p-Tau, Ezrin and MAP2. These three proteins are associated with 
dendritic morphogenesis, neuronal polarity, synaptogenesis, axon establishment 
and axon elongation. Moreover, Aβ40 monomers may regulate their physiological 
forms by inhibiting the expression of BACE1 and APP via activation of the ERK1/2 
pathway. A comprehensive exploration of pathological and physiological 
mechanisms of Aβ is beneficial for exploring novel treatment.

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), transgenic mouse models have established links 
between abnormalities in the retina and those in the brain. APPNL-F/NL-F is a 
murine, humanized AD model that replicates several pathological features 
observed in patients with AD. Research has focused on obtaining quantitative 
parameters from optical coherence tomography (OCT) in AD. The aim of this study 
was to analyze, in a transversal case-control study using manual retinal 
segmentation via SD-OCT, the changes occurring in the retinal layers of the 
APPNL/F-NF/L AD model in comparison to C57BL/6J mice (WT) at 6, 9, 12, 15, 17, 
and 20 months of age. The analysis focused on retinal thickness in RNFL-GCL, 
IPL, INL, OPL, and ONL based on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study 
(ETDRS) sectors. Both APPNL-F/NL-F-model and WT animals exhibited thickness 
changes at the time points studied. While WT showed significant changes in INL, 
OPL, and ONL, the AD model showed changes in all retinal layers analyzed. The 
APPNL-F/NL-F displayed significant thickness variations in the analyzed layers 
except for the IPL compared to related WT. These thickness changes closely 
resembled those found in humans during preclinical stages, as well as during 
mild and moderate AD stages, making this AD model behave more similarly to the 
disease in humans.

Neurodegenerative diseases are a group of complex diseases characterized by a 
progressive loss of neurons and degeneration in different areas of the nervous 
system. They share similar mechanisms, such as neuroinflammation, oxidative 
stress, and mitochondrial injury, resulting in neuronal loss. One of the biggest 
challenges in diagnosing neurodegenerative diseases is their heterogeneity. 
Clinical symptoms are usually present in the advanced stages of the disease, 
thus it is essential to find optimal biomarkers that would allow early 
diagnosis. Due to the development of ultrasensitive methods analyzing proteins 
in other fluids, such as blood, huge progress has been made in the field of 
biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases. The application of protein biomarker 
measurement has significantly influenced not only diagnosis but also prognosis, 
differentiation, and the development of new therapies, as it enables the 
recognition of early stages of disease in individuals with preclinical stages or 
with mild symptoms. Additionally, the introduction of biochemical markers into 
routine clinical practice may improve diagnosis and allow for a stratification 
group of people with higher risk, as well as an extension of well-being since a 
treatment could be started early. In this review, we focus on blood biomarkers, 
which could be potentially useful in the daily medical practice of selected 
neurodegenerative diseases.

Human brain aging is characterized by the production and deposition of β-amyloid 
(Aβ) in the form of senile plaques and cerebral amyloid angiopathy and the 
intracellular accumulation of hyper-phosphorylated tau (Hp-tau) to form 
neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and dystrophic neurites of senile plaques. The 
process progresses for years and eventually manifests as cognitive impairment 
and dementia in a subgroup of aged individuals. Aβ is produced and deposited 
first in the neocortex in most aged mammals, including humans; it is usually not 
accompanied by altered behavior and cognitive impairment. Hp-tau is less 
frequent than Aβ pathology, and NFTs are rare in most mammals. In contrast, NFTs 
are familiar from middle age onward in humans; NFTs first appear in the 
paleocortex and selected brain stem nuclei. NFTs precede for decades or years Aβ 
deposition and correlate with dementia in about 5% of individuals at the age of 
65 and 25% at the age of 85. Based on these comparative data, (a) Aβ deposition 
is the most common Alzheimer's disease neuropathological change (ADNC) in the 
brain of aged mammals; (b) Hp-tau is less common, and NFTs are rare in most aged 
mammals; however, NFTs are the principal cytoskeletal pathology in aged humans; 
(c) NFT in aged humans starts in selected nuclei of the brain stem and 
paleocortical brain regions progressing to the most parts of the neocortex and 
other regions of the telencephalon; (d) human brain aging is unique among 
mammalian species due to the early appearance and dramatic progression of NFTs 
from middle age onward, matching with cognitive impairment and dementia in 
advanced cases; (e) neither mammalian nor human brain aging supports the concept 
of the amyloid cascade hypothesis.

Methylsulfinyl hexyl isothiocyanate (6-MSITC) isolated from Eutrema japonicum is 
a promising candidate for the treatment of breast cancer, colorectal and stomach 
cancer, metabolic syndrome, heart diseases, diabetes, and obesity due to its 
anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Also, its neuroprotective 
properties, improving cognitive function and protecting dopaminergic neurons, 
make it an excellent candidate for treating neurodegenerative diseases like 
dementia, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease. 6-MSITC acts on many signaling 
pathways, such as PPAR, AMPK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, Nrf2/Keap1-ARE, 
ERK1/2-ELK1/CHOP/DR5, and MAPK. However, despite the very promising results of 
in vitro and in vivo animal studies and a few human studies, the molecule has 
not yet been thoroughly tested in the human population. Nonetheless, wasabi 
should be classified as a "superfood" for the primary and secondary prevention 
of human diseases. This article reviews the current state-of-the-art research on 
6-MSITC and its potential clinical uses, discussing in detail the signaling 
pathways activated by the molecule and their interactions.

Glutathione (GSH), a tripeptide synthesized intracellularly, serves as a pivotal 
antioxidant, neutralizing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen 
species (RNS) while maintaining redox homeostasis and detoxifying xenobiotics. 
Its potent antioxidant properties, particularly attributed to the sulfhydryl 
group (-SH) in cysteine, are crucial for cellular health across various 
organelles. The glutathione-glutathione disulfide (GSH-GSSG) cycle is 
facilitated by enzymes like glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione 
reductase (GR), thus aiding in detoxification processes and mitigating oxidative 
damage and inflammation. Mitochondria, being primary sources of reactive oxygen 
species, benefit significantly from GSH, which regulates metal homeostasis and 
supports autophagy, apoptosis, and ferroptosis, playing a fundamental role in 
neuroprotection. The vulnerability of the brain to oxidative stress underscores 
the importance of GSH in neurological disorders and regenerative medicine. 
Nebulization of glutathione presents a novel and promising approach to 
delivering this antioxidant directly to the central nervous system (CNS), 
potentially enhancing its bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy. This method 
may offer significant advantages in mitigating neurodegeneration by enhancing 
nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) pathway signaling and 
mitochondrial function, thereby providing direct neuroprotection. By addressing 
oxidative stress and its detrimental effects on neuronal health, nebulized GSH 
could play a crucial role in managing and potentially ameliorating conditions 
such as Parkinson's Disease (PD) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Further clinical 
research is warranted to elucidate the therapeutic potential of nebulized GSH in 
preserving mitochondrial health, enhancing CNS function, and combating 
neurodegenerative conditions, aiming to improve outcomes for individuals 
affected by brain diseases characterized by oxidative stress and 
neuroinflammation.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative process responsible for almost 
70% of all cases of dementia. The clinical signs consist in progressive and 
irreversible loss of memory, cognitive, and behavioral functions. The main 
histopathological hallmark is the accumulation of amyloid-ß (Aß) peptide fibrils 
in the brain. To date, the origin of Aß has not been determined. Recent studies 
have shown that the gut microbiota produces Aß, and dysbiotic states have been 
identified in AD patients and animal models of AD. Starting from the hypothesis 
that maintaining or restoring the microbiota's eubiosis is essential to control 
Aß's production and deposition in the brain, we used a mixture of probiotics and 
prebiotics (symbiotic) to treat APPPS1 male and female mice, an animal model of 
AD, from 2 to 8 months of age and evaluated their cognitive performances, mucus 
secretion, Aβ serum concentration, and microbiota composition. The results 
showed that the treatment was able to prevent the memory deficits, the reduced 
mucus secretion, the increased Aβ blood levels, and the imbalance in the gut 
microbiota found in APPPS1 mice. The present study demonstrates that the 
gut-brain axis plays a critical role in the genesis of cognitive impairment, and 
that modulation of the gut microbiota can ameliorate AD's symptomatology.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder marked by 
the accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau proteins, 
leading to cognitive decline and neuronal death. However, despite extensive 
research, there are still no effective treatments for this condition. In this 
study, a series of chloride-substituted Ramalin derivatives is synthesized to 
optimize their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and their potential to target key 
pathological features of Alzheimer's disease. The effect of the chloride 
position on these properties is investigated, specifically examining the 
potential of these derivatives to inhibit tau aggregation and beta-site amyloid 
precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE-1) activity. Our findings demonstrate 
that several derivatives, particularly RA-3Cl, RA-4Cl, RA-26Cl, RA-34Cl, and 
RA-35Cl, significantly inhibit tau aggregation with inhibition rates of 
approximately 50%. For BACE-1 inhibition, Ramalin and RA-4Cl also significantly 
decrease BACE-1 expression in N2a cells by 40% and 38%, respectively, while 
RA-23Cl and RA-24Cl showed inhibition rates of 30% and 35% in SH-SY5Y cells. 
These results suggest that chloride-substituted Ramalin derivatives possess 
promising multifunctional properties for AD treatment, warranting further 
investigation and optimization for clinical applications.

Recent advancements in brain stimulation and nanomedicine have ushered in a new 
era of therapeutic interventions for psychiatric and neurodegenerative 
disorders. This review explores the cutting-edge innovations in brain 
stimulation techniques, including their applications in alleviating symptoms of 
main neurodegenerative disorders and addiction. Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is 
an FDA-approved treatment for specific neurodegenerative disorders, including 
Parkinson's Disease (PD), and is currently under evaluation for other 
conditions, such as Alzheimer's Disease. This technique has facilitated 
significant advancements in understanding brain electrical circuitry by enabling 
targeted brain stimulation and providing insights into neural network function 
and dysfunction. In reviewing DBS studies, this review places particular 
emphasis on the underlying main neurotransmitter modifications and their 
specific brain area location, particularly focusing on the dopaminergic system, 
which plays a critical role in these conditions. Furthermore, this review delves 
into the groundbreaking developments in nanomedicine, highlighting how 
nanotechnology can be utilized to target aberrant signaling in neurodegenerative 
diseases, with a specific focus on the dopaminergic system. The discussion 
extends to emerging technologies such as magnetoelectric nanoparticles (MENPs), 
which represent a novel intersection between nanoformulation and brain 
stimulation approaches. These innovative technologies offer promising avenues 
for enhancing the precision and effectiveness of treatments by enabling the 
non-invasive, targeted delivery of therapeutic agents as well as on-site, 
on-demand stimulation. By integrating insights from recent research and 
technological advances, this review aims to provide a comprehensive 
understanding of how brain stimulation and nanomedicine can be synergistically 
applied to address complex neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, 
paving the way for future therapeutic strategies.

The main feature of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, 
is the network of complex and not fully recognized neuronal pathways and targets 
involved in their onset and progression. The therapeutic treatment, at present 
mainly symptomatic, could benefit from a polypharmacological approach based on 
the development of a single molecular entity designed to simultaneously modulate 
different validated biological targets. This strategy is principally based on 
molecular hybridization, obtained by linking or merging different chemical 
moieties acting with synergistic and/or complementary mechanisms. The coumarin 
core, widely found in nature, endowed with a recognized broad spectrum of 
pharmacological activities, large synthetic accessibility and favourable 
pharmacokinetic properties, appears as a valuable, privileged scaffold to be 
properly modified in order to obtain compounds able to engage different selected 
targets. The scientific literature has long been interested in the multifaceted 
profiles of coumarin derivatives, and in this review, a survey of the most 
important results of the last four years, on both natural and synthetic 
coumarin-based compounds, regarding the development of anti-Alzheimer's 
compounds is reported.

Quantitative mobility analysis using wearable sensors, while promising as a 
diagnostic tool for Parkinson's disease (PD), is not commonly applied in 
clinical settings. Major obstacles include uncertainty regarding the best 
protocol for instrumented mobility testing and subsequent data processing, as 
well as the added workload and complexity of this multi-step process. To 
simplify sensor-based mobility testing in diagnosing PD, we analyzed data from 
262 PD participants and 50 controls performing several motor tasks wearing a 
sensor on their lower back containing a triaxial accelerometer and a triaxial 
gyroscope. Using ensembles of heterogeneous machine learning models 
incorporating a range of classifiers trained on a set of sensor features, we 
show that our models effectively differentiate between participants with PD and 
controls, both for mixed-stage PD (92.6% accuracy) and a group selected for mild 
PD only (89.4% accuracy). Omitting algorithmic segmentation of complex mobility 
tasks decreased the diagnostic accuracy of our models, as did the inclusion of 
kinesiological features. Feature importance analysis revealed that Timed Up and 
Go (TUG) tasks to contribute the highest-yield predictive features, with only 
minor decreases in accuracy for models based on cognitive TUG as a single 
mobility task. Our machine learning approach facilitates major simplification of 
instrumented mobility testing without compromising predictive performance.

INTRODUCTION: Research efforts to characterize and evaluate care delivery and 
outcomes for older adults with cancer and comorbid dementia are limited by 
varied methods used to classify Alzheimer's disease and related dementias 
(ADRD). The purpose of this study is to evaluate differences in demographic, 
clinical, and cancer characteristics of people newly diagnosed with cancer and 
concomitant dementia comparing two common methods to identify ADRD using 
administrative claims data.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using 
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare data. Our sample 
included adults aged 66 years and older with a first primary diagnosis of lung 
or colorectal cancer between 2011 and 2017. For each cancer diagnosis, we 
constructed analytical cohorts using the Center for Medicare and Medicaid 
Services' Chronic Condition Warehouse (CCW) flag and the Bynum-Standard one- and 
three-year algorithms to capture diagnosed ADRD. We estimated ADRD prevalence 
using the algorithms and compared Bynum and CCW cohorts on demographic, 
clinical, and cancer characteristics at cancer diagnosis and survival for lung 
and colorectal cancer separately.
RESULTS: Among older adults with lung cancer, ADRD prevalence was 4.7% with the 
one-year Bynum, 6.5% with the three-year Bynum, and 12.5% using the CCW flag. In 
the colorectal cohort, ADRD prevalence was 5.6% with the one-year Bynum, 7.6% 
with the three-year Bynum, and 14.1% with the CCW flag. Demographic 
characteristics were similar across ADRD cohorts. The Bynum cohorts identified 
higher proportions of individuals with moderate to severe dementia (13.8% and 
11.2% versus 7.1% CCW in lung cancer; 13.1% and 10.6% versus 6.8% CCW in 
colorectal cancer), higher frailty rates (27.4% and 22.7% versus 15.0% CCW in 
lung cancer; 26.4% and 22.3% versus 14.8% CCW in colorectal cancer). Median 
survival was lower for the Bynum cohorts compared to the CCW, regardless of 
cancer type.
DISCUSSION: Findings demonstrate that ADRD prevalence and certain clinical 
characteristics vary based on dementia ascertainment method and observation 
period used to classify individuals with ADRD. Considering differences in the 
cohorts of registry cases generated by the identification method used is 
essential when interpreting findings related to treatment, utilization, and

OBJECTIVES: There are currently 29 genome regions that demonstrate associations 
with Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk. Regular physical exercise can promote 
systemic change in gene expression and may modify the risk of cognitive decline 
and AD. This study is a secondary analysis of a randomised controlled trial and 
examines the effect of a six-month exercise intervention versus control on 
AD-related gene expression.
DESIGN: Single-site parallel pilot randomised controlled trial.
METHODS: 91 cognitively unimpaired older adults were enrolled in the Intense 
Physical Activity and Cognition (IPAC) study. Participants were randomised into 
one of three groups: high-intensity exercise, moderate-intensity exercise, or 
inactive control for six months. Blood samples were collected prior to, and 
within two weeks of intervention completion, for later expression analysis of 96 
genes. To explore the relationship between changes in gene expression and the 
intervention groups, an interaction term ("time point × intervention group") was 
subsequently used.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in gene expression between the 
three intervention groups at baseline, nor after the intervention. Within 
groups, five genes were upregulated, seven were downregulated and the remainder 
remained unchanged. None of the examined genes showed significant change from 
pre- to post-intervention in the exercise groups compared to the control.
CONCLUSIONS: Exercise does not change AD-related gene expression in cognitively 
unimpaired older adults. Several gene expression targets have been identified 
for further study.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an intricate neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by the accumulation of misfolded proteins, including beta-amyloid 
(Aβ) and tau, leading to cognitive decline. Despite decades of research, the 
precise mechanisms underlying its onset and progression remain elusive. 
Cathepsins are a family of lysosomal enzymes that play vital roles in cellular 
processes, including protein degradation and regulation of immune responses. 
Emerging evidence suggests that cathepsins may be involved in AD pathogenesis. 
Cathepsins can influence the activation of microglia and astrocytes, the 
resident immune cells in the brain. However, cathepsin dysfunction may lead to 
the accumulation of misfolded proteins, notably Aβ and tau. In addition, 
dysregulated cathepsin activity may induce an exaggerated immune response, 
promoting chronic inflammation and neuronal dysfunction in patients with AD. By 
unraveling the classification, functions, and roles of cathepsins in AD's 
pathogenesis, this review sheds light on their intricate involvement in this 
devastating disease. Targeting cathepsin activity could be a promising and novel 
approach for mitigating the pathological processes that contribute to AD, 
providing new avenues for its treatment and prevention.

[18F]-Florbetazine ([18F]-92) is a selective PET tracer for β-amyloid (Aβ) 
depositions with a novel diaryl-azine scaffold to reduce lipophilicity and to 
achieve higher gray-to-white matter contrast. We aimed to assess its diagnostic 
value in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and pharmacokinetics characteristics in human 
subjects.
METHODS: Six healthy controls (HCs) and nine AD patients underwent dynamic PET 
examination with [18F]-Florbetazine and a structural MRI scan. The 
time-activity-curves (TACs) for volumes of interest (VOIs) in cerebral cortex, 
cerebellar cortex and cerebral white matter was depicted and their standardized 
uptake value ratios (SUVRs) with cerebellar cortex as reference were compared 
between HCs and AD patients. The cerebral gray-to-white matter SUV ratio (GWR) 
was also calculated.
RESULTS: In HCs, radioactivities in the cerebral cortex VOIs were homogeneously 
low and at the same level as in cerebellar cortex, while in AD patients, 
cortical VOIs expected to contain Aβ exhibited high radioactivity. Cerebral 
cortex SUVRs remain relatively low in HCs while keep increasing along with time 
in AD patients. After 15 min, the cerebral cortex SUVRs became significant 
higher in AD patients compared to HCs with 100 % discrimination accuracy. In AD 
patients, GWR remained over 1.3 for all time intervals and visual inspection 
showed lower uptake in cerebral white matter compared to cerebral cortex.
CONCLUSION: [18F]-Florbetazine PET showed high uptake on Aβ plaques and high 
gray-to-white contrast in AD patients that are favorable in visual read. 
[18F]-Florbetazine can be potentially used for detection and quantification of 
Aβ depositions in the living human brain.

BACKGROUND: Clinical and translational research has identified deficits in the 
dopaminergic neurotransmission in the striatum in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 
this could be related to the pathophysiology of psychiatric symptoms appearing 
even at early stages of the pathology.
HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesized that AD pathology in the hippocampus may influence 
dopaminergic neurotransmission even in the absence of AD-related lesion in the 
mesostriatal circuit.
METHODS: We chemogenetically manipulated the activity of hippocampal neurons and 
astrocytes in wild-type and hemizygous TgF344-AD (Tg) rats, an animal model of 
AD pathology. We assessed the brain-wide functional output of this manipulation 
using in vivo Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography to measure cerebral 
blood flow and D2/3 receptor binding, in response to acute (3 mg kg-1 i.p.) and 
chronic (0.015 mg/ml in drinking water, 28 days) stimulation of neurons or 
astrocytes with clozapine N-oxide. We also assessed the effects of the chronic 
chemogenetic manipulations on D2 receptor density, low or high aggregated forms 
of amyloid Aβ40 and Aβ42, astrocytes and microglial reactivity, and the capacity 
of astrocytes and microglia to surround and phagocytize Aβ both locally and in 
the striatum.
RESULTS: We showed that acute and chronic neuronal and astrocytic stimulation 
induces widespread effects on the brain regional activation pattern, notably 
with an inhibition of striatal activation. In the Tg rats, both these effects 
were blunted. Chemogenetic stimulation in the hippocampus increased microglial 
density and its capacity to limit AD pathology, whereas these effects were 
absent in the striatum perhaps as a consequence of the altered connectivity 
between the hippocampus and the striatum.
CONCLUSIONS: Our work suggests that hippocampal AD pathology may alter 
mesostriatal signalling and induce widespread alterations of brain activity. 
Neuronal and astrocytic activation may induce a protective, Aβ-limiting 
phenotype of microglia, which surrounds Aβ plaques and limits Αβ concentration 
more efficiently.

The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasing globally due to 
population aging. However, effective clinical treatment strategies for AD still 
remain elusive. The mechanisms underlying AD onset and the interplay between its 
pathological factors have so far been unclear. Evidence indicates that AD 
progression is ultimately driven by neuronal loss, which in turn is caused by 
neuroapoptosis and neuroinflammation. Therefore, the inhibition of 
neuroapoptosis and neuroinflammation could be a useful anti-AD strategy. 
Nonetheless, the delivery of active drug agents into the brain parenchyma is 
hindered by the blood-brain barrier (BBB). To address this challenge, we 
fabricated a black phosphorus nanosheet (BP)-based methylene blue (MB) delivery 
system (BP-MB) for AD therapy. After confirming the successful preparation of 
BP-MB, we proved that its BBB-crossing ability was enhanced under near-infrared 
light irradiation. In vitro pharmacodynamics analysis revealed that BP and MB 
could synergistically scavenge excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) in 
okadaic acid (OA)-treated PC12 cells and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated BV2 
cells, thus efficiently reversing neuroapoptosis and neuroinflammation. To study 
in vivo pharmacodynamics, we established a mouse model of AD mice, and 
behavioral tests confirmed that BP-MB treatment could successfully improve 
cognitive function in these animals. Notably, the results of pathological 
evaluation were consistent with those of the in vitro assays. The findings 
demonstrated that BP-MB could scavenge excessive ROS and inhibit Tau 
hyperphosphorylation, thereby alleviating downstream neuroapoptosis and 
regulating the polarization of microglia from the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype 
to the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype. Overall, this study highlights the 
therapeutic potential of a smart nanomedicine with the capability of reversing 
neuroapoptosis and neuroinflammation for AD treatment.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains one of the most challenging neurodegenerative 
disorders to treat, with oxidative stress playing a significant role in its 
pathology. Recent advancements in nanoenzymes technology offer a promising 
approach to mitigate this oxidative damage. Nanoenzymes, with their unique 
enzyme-mimicking activities, effectively scavenge reactive oxygen species and 
reduce oxidative stress, thereby providing neuroprotective effects. This review 
delves into the underlying mechanisms of AD, focusing on oxidative stress and 
its impact on disease progression. We explore the latest developments in 
nanoenzymes applications for AD treatment, highlighting their multifunctional 
capabilities and potential for targeted delivery to amyloid-beta plaques. 
Despite the exciting prospects, the clinical translation of nanoenzymes faces 
several challenges, including difficulties in brain targeting, consistent 
quality production, and ensuring safety and biocompatibility. We discuss these 
limitations in detail, emphasizing the need for rigorous evaluation and 
standardized protocols. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of 
the current state of nanoenzymes research in AD, shedding light on both the 
opportunities and obstacles in the path towards effective clinical applications.

Pertaining to Light, Noise, Temperature, and Humidity and the Behavioral and 
Psychological Symptoms of People Living With Dementia: Scoping Review.

BACKGROUND: A common challenge for individuals caring for people with Alzheimer 
disease and related dementias is managing the behavioral and psychological 
symptoms of dementia (BPSD). Effective management of BPSD will increase the 
quality of life of people living with dementia, lessen caregivers' burden, and 
lower health care cost.
OBJECTIVE: In this review, we seek to (1) examine how indoor environmental 
quality parameters pertaining to light, noise, temperature, and humidity are 
associated with BPSD and how controlling these parameters can help manage these 
symptoms and (2) identify the current state of knowledge in this area, current 
gaps in the research, and potential future directions.
METHODS: Searches were conducted in the CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO 
databases for papers published from January 2007 to February 2024. We searched 
for studies examining the relationship between indoor environmental quality 
parameters pertaining to light, noise, temperature, and humidity and BPSD.
RESULTS: A total of 3123 papers were identified in the original search in 
October 2020. After an additional 2 searches and screening, 38 (0.69%) of the 
5476 papers were included. Among the included papers, light was the most studied 
environmental factor (34/38, 89%), while there were fewer studies (from 5/38, 
13% to 11/38, 29%) examining the relationships between other environmental 
factors and BPSD. Of the 38 studies, 8 (21%) examined multiple indoor 
environmental quality parameters. Subjective data were the only source of 
environmental assessments in 6 (16%) of the 38 studies. The findings regarding 
the relationship between agitation and light therapy are conflicted, while the 
studies that examined the relationship between BPSD and temperature or humidity 
are all observational. The results suggest that when the environmental factors 
are deemed overstimulating or understimulating for an individual with dementia, 
the behavioral symptoms tend to be exacerbated.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this scoping review may inform the design of 
long-term care units and older adult housing to support aging in place. More 
research is still needed to better understand the relationship between indoor 
environmental quality parameters and BPSD, and there is a need for more 
objective measurements of both the indoor environmental quality parameters and 
behavioral symptoms. One future direction is to incorporate objective sensing 
and advanced computational methods in real-time assessments to initiate 
just-in-time environmental interventions. Better management of BPSD will benefit 
patients, caregivers, and the health care system.

OBJECTIVE: To report a case of fatal super-refractory status epilepticus 
associated with amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA).
METHODS: We describe the history, neuroimaging, EEG, and brain pathology 
findings of a 75-year-old patient with mild cognitive impairment due to 
Alzheimer disease (homozygous ε4 apolipoprotein status) and a remote history of 
3 asymptomatic ARIA episodes, who developed super-refractory status epilepticus 
related to severe ARIA.
RESULTS: The patient was participating in an extended open-label trial of 
aducanumab when she was admitted to hospital for focal seizures and ARIA in 2 
noncontiguous regions of the left frontal and occipital lobes. Despite 
aggressive treatment with high-dose corticosteroids, sedation, and antiseizure 
medications, she died from refractory focal status epilepticus. In retrospect, 
routine surveillance brain magnetic resonance imaging performed 11 weeks before 
hospitalization had signs of ARIA, which had not been identified.
DISCUSSION: Clinicians should be aware that anti-amyloid therapies may cause 
rare serious adverse events. A high degree of vigilance is required in the 
interpretation of surveillance imaging for ARIA. Longitudinal studies are 
justified to further characterize the safety profile of anti-amyloid antibody 
therapies and identify participants at high risk of serious adverse events.

BACKGROUND: Measurement of freezing of gait (FOG) relies on the sensitivity and 
reliability of tasks to provoke FOG. It is currently unclear which tasks provide 
the best outcomes and how medication state plays into this.
OBJECTIVE: To establish the sensitivity and test-retest reliability of various 
FOG-provoking tasks for presence and severity of FOG, with (ON) and without 
(OFF) dopaminergic medication.
METHODS: FOG-presence and percentage time frozen (% TF) were derived from video 
annotations of a home-based FOG-provoking protocol performed in OFF and ON. This 
included: the four meter walk (4MW), Timed Up and Go (TUG) single (ST) and dual 
task (DT), 360° turns in ST and DT, a doorway condition, and a personalized 
condition. Sensitivity was tested at baseline in 63 definite freezers. 
Test-retest reliability was evaluated over 5 weeks in 26 freezers.
RESULTS: Sensitivity and test-retest reliability were highest for 360° turns and 
higher in OFF than ON. Test-retest intra-class correlation coefficients of % TF 
varied between 0.63-0.90 in OFF and 0.18-0.87 in ON, and minimal detectable 
changes (MDCs) were high. The optimal protocol included TUG ST, 360° turns ST, 
360° turns DT and a doorway condition, provoking FOG in all freezers in OFF and 
91.9% in ON and this could be done reliably in 95.8% (OFF) and 84.0% (ON) of the 
sample. Combining OFF and ON further improved outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: The highest sensitivity and reliability was achieved with a 
multi-trigger protocol performed in OFF + ON. However, the high MDCs for % TF 
underscore the need for further optimization of FOG measurement.

Plain Language Summary: Freezing of gait is a very burdensome and episodic 
symptom in Parkinson’s disease that is difficult to measure. Measurement of 
freezing is needed to determine whether someone has freezing and how severe this 
is, and relies on observation during a freezing-triggering protocol. However, it 
is unclear what protocol is sufficiently sensitive to trigger freezing in many 
freezers, and whether freezing can be triggered reliably at different 
timepoints. Here, we investigated 1) which tasks can trigger freezing-presence 
and freezing-severity sensitively and reliably, 2) how medication state 
influences this, and 3) what task combination was most reliable. Sixty-three 
patients with daily freezing performed several freezing-triggering tasks in 
their homes, both with (ON) and without (OFF) anti-Parkinsonian medication. In 
twenty-six patients, the measurement was repeated 5 weeks later to determine 
test-retest reliability. First, we found that performing 360° turns in place 
with a cognitive dual task was the most sensitive and reliable task to trigger 
FOG. Second, sensitivity and reliability were better in OFF than in ON. Third, 
the most reliable protocol included: the Timed-Up and Go, 360° turns in place 
with and without the dual task, and a doorway condition. This protocol triggered 
freezing in all patients in OFF and 91.9% in ON and did so reliably in 95.8% 
(OFF) and 84.0% (ON) of the sample. We recommend to measure freezing with this 
protocol in OFF + ON, which further improved reliability. However, the 
measurement error for freezing-severity was high, even for this optimal 
protocol, underscoring the need for further optimization of freezing 
measurement.

BACKGROUND: Synaptic dysfunction is closely associated with cognitive function 
in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and is present already in an early stage of the 
disease.
OBJECTIVE: Using serial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling, we aimed to 
investigate slopes of CSF synaptic proteins, and their relation with cognition 
along the AD continuum.
METHODS: We included subjects with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) or mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) (n = 50 amyloid-β+ [A +], n = 50 A-) and 50 patients 
with AD dementia from the Amsterdam dementia cohort, with CSF at two time points 
(median[IQR] 2.1[1.4-2.7] years). We analyzed 17 synaptic proteins and 
neurofilament light (NfL). Using linear mixed models we assessed trajectories of 
protein levels, and associations with cognitive decline (repeated Mini-Mental 
State Examination). We used Cox regression models to assess predictive value of 
protein levels for progression to AD dementia.
RESULTS: At baseline most proteins showed increased levels in AD dementia 
compared to the other groups. In contrast NPTX2 levels were lower in AD 
dementia. Higher baseline levels of SNAP25, β-syn, and 14-3-3 proteins were 
associated with faster cognitive decline (St.B[SE] -0.27[0.12] to -0.61[0.12]). 
Longitudinal analyses showed that SYT1 and NPTX levels decreased over time in AD 
dementia (st.B[SE] -0.10[0.04] to -0.15[0.05]) and SCD/MCI-A+ (St.B[SE] 
-0.07[0.03] to -0.12[0.03]), but not in SCD/MCI-A- (pinteraction < 0.05). 
Increase over time in NfL levels was associated with faster cognitive decline in 
AD dementia (St.B[SE] -1.75[0.58]), but not in the other groups 
(pinteraction < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: CSF synaptic proteins showed different slopes over time, suggesting 
complex synaptic dynamics. High levels of especially SNAP-25 may have value for 
prediction of cognitive decline in early AD stages, while increase in NfL over 
time correlates better with cognitive decline in later stages.

BACKGROUND: Tau accumulation in Alzheimer's disease is associated with short 
term clinical progression and faster rates of cognitive decline in individuals 
with high amyloid-β deposition. Defining an optimal threshold of tau 
accumulation predictive of cognitive decline remains a challenge.
OBJECTIVE: We tested the ability of regional tau PET sensitivity and specificity 
thresholds to predict longitudinal cognitive decline. We also tested the 
predictive performance of thresholds in the proposed new NIA-AA biological 
staging for Alzheimer's disease where multiple levels of tau positivity are used 
to stage participants.
METHODS: 18F-flortaucipir scans from 301 non-demented participants were 
processed and sampled. Four cognitive measures were assessed longitudinally. 
Regional standardized uptake value ratios were split into infra- and 
suprathreshold groups at baseline using previously derived thresholds. Survival 
analysis, log rank testing, and Generalized Estimation Equations assessed the 
relationship between the application of regional sensitivity/specificity 
thresholds and change in cognitive measures as well as tau threshold performance 
in predicting cognitive decline within the new NIA-AA biological staging.
RESULTS: The meta temporal region was best for predicting risk of short-term 
cognitive decline in suprathreshold, as compared to infrathreshold participants. 
When applying multiple levels of tau positivity, each subsequent level of tau 
identified cognitive decline at earlier timepoints.
CONCLUSIONS: When using 18F-flortaucipir, meta temporal suprathreshold 
classification was associated with increased risk of cognitive decline, 
suggesting that abnormal tau deposition in the cortex predicts decline. 
Likewise, the application of multiple levels of tau clearly predicts the 
distinctive cognitive trajectories in the new NIA-AA biological staging 
framework.

BACKGROUND: Laminopathy is a pathological manifestation observed in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), leading to neuronal apoptosis.
OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to assess inhibitors of enzymes involved in 
laminopathy.
METHODS: The mRNA expression of the cathepsins L and B, caspases 3 and 6, lamins 
b1 and b2, granzymes A and B, and lamins A and C were extracted and analyzed 
from GSE5281 and GSE28146 datasets. A total of 145 ligands were selected for 
molecular docking. Subsequently, 10 ns and 100 ns atomistic molecular dynamics 
(MD) and Martini 3 were performed with NAMD for two selected ligands (PubChem 
id: 608841 and ChEMBL id: 550872).
RESULTS: The mRNA expression level highlighted caspase 6 and lamin A/C 
upregulation in the hippocampus of the AD samples, in contrast to cathepsin B, 
lamin b2, and caspase 3. Moreover, there was a strong correlation between the 
expression level of cathepsin B, lamin A/C, and caspase 6 in the AD group. The 
MD results suggested molecule with ChEMBL id of 550872 had higher free binding 
energy, while in longer simulation the molecule with PubChem id of 608841 was 
suggested to be more stable in complex with the receptor.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that lamins A/C, cathepsins B/L, caspase 6, 
and lamin B2 are associated with laminopathy as potential factors contributing 
to apoptosis in AD. We propose that simultaneous inhibition of caspases 6 and 
cathepsins L may decrease the rate of apoptosis triggered by lamin degradation. 
Nevertheless, further studies are required to confirm these observations due to 
the lack of in vivo findings.

BACKGROUND: Clinical trial findings on cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) for 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are inconclusive, offering limited support for 
their MCI treatment. Given that nearly half of amnestic MCI cases lack cerebral 
amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease; this Aβ 
heterogeneity may explain inconsistent results.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess whether Aβ deposition moderates ChEI 
effects on amnestic MCI cognition.
METHODS: We examined 118 individuals with amnestic MCI (ages 55-90) in a 
longitudinal cohort study. Baseline and 2-year follow-up assessments included 
clinical evaluations, neuropsychological testing, and multimodal neuroimaging. 
Generalized linear models were primarily analyzed to test amyloid positivity's 
moderation of ChEI effects on cognitive change over 2 years. Cognitive outcomes 
included Mini-Mental Status Examination score, the total score of the Consortium 
to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease neuropsychological battery, and 
Clinical Dementia Rating-sum of boxes.
RESULTS: The analysis found no significant ChEI use x amyloid positivity 
interaction for all cognitive outcomes. ChEI use, irrespective of Aβ status, was 
associated with more cognitive decline over the 2-year period.
CONCLUSIONS: Aβ pathology does not appear to moderate ChEI effects on cognitive 
decline in MCI.

BACKGROUND: Lewy body dementia (LBD) is the second most common neurodegenerative 
dementia in the US, presenting unique end-of-life challenges.
OBJECTIVE: This study examined healthcare utilization and care continuity in the 
last year of life in LBD.
METHODS: Medicare claims for enrollees with LBD, continuously enrolled in the 
year preceding death, were examined from 2011-2018. We assessed hospital stays, 
emergency department (ED) visits, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, 
life-extending procedures, medications, and care continuity.
RESULTS: We identified 45,762 LBD decedents, predominantly female (51.8%), White 
(85.9%), with average age of 84.1 years (SD 7.5). There was a median of 2 ED 
visits (IQR 1-5) and 1 inpatient stay (IQR 0-2). Higher age was inversely 
associated with ICU stays (Odds Ratio [OR] 0.96; 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 
0.96-0.97) and life-extending procedures (OR 0.96; 95% CI 0.95-0.96). Black and 
Hispanic patients experienced higher rates of ED visits, inpatient 
hospitalizations, ICU admissions, life-extending procedures, and in-hospital 
deaths relative to White patients. On average, 15 (7.5) medications were 
prescribed in the last year. Enhanced care continuity correlated with reduced 
hospital (OR 0.72; 95% CI 0.70-0.74) and ED visits (OR 0.71; 95% CI 0.69-0.87) 
and fewer life-extending procedures (OR 0.71; 95% CI 0.64-0.79).
CONCLUSIONS: This study underscored the complex healthcare needs of people with 
LBD during their final year, which was influenced by age and race. Care 
continuity may reduce hospital and ED visits and life-extending procedures.

Herein, we highlight the significance of molecular modeling approaches prior to 
in vitro and in vivo studies; particularly, in diseases with no recognized 
treatments such as neurological abnormalities. Alzheimer disease is a 
neurodegenerative disorder that causes irreversible cognitive decline. Toxicity 
and ADMET studies were conducted using the Qikprop platform in Maestro software 
and Discovery Studio 2.0, respectively, to select the promising skeletons from 
more than 45 reviewed compounds isolated from mushrooms in the last decade. 
Using rigid and flexible molecular docking approaches such as induced fit 
docking (IFD) in the binding sites of β-secretase (BACE1) and acetylcholine 
esterase (ACHE), promising structures were screened through high precision 
molecular docking compared with standard drugs donepezil and 
(2E)-2-imino-3-methyl-5,5-diphenylimidazolidin-4-one (OKK) using Maestro and 
Cresset Flare platforms. Molecular interactions, binding distances, and RMSD 
values were measured to reveal key interactions at the binding sites of the two 
neurodegenerative enzymes. Analysis of IFD results revealed consistent bindings 
of dictyoquinazol A and gensetin I in the pocket of 4ey7 while inonophenol A, 
ganomycin, and fornicin fit quite well in 4dju demonstrating binding poses very 
close to native ligands at ACHE and BACE1. Respective key amino acid contacts 
manifested the least steric problems according to their Gibbs free binding 
energies, Glide XP scores, RMSD values, and molecular orientation respect to the 
key amino acids. Molecular dynamics simulations further confirmed our findings 
and prospected these compounds to show significant in vitro results in their 
future pharmacological studies.

IMPORTANCE: Black or African American (hereinafter, Black) and Hispanic or 
Latino/a/x (hereinafter, Latinx) adults are disproportionally affected by 
Alzheimer disease, but most research studies do not enroll adequate numbers of 
both of these populations. The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative-3 
(ADNI3) launched a diversity taskforce to pilot a multipronged effort to 
increase the study inclusion of Black and Latinx older adults.
OBJECTIVE: To describe and evaluate the culturally informed and 
community-engaged inclusion efforts to increase the screening and enrollment of 
Black and Latinx older adults in ADNI3.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study used baseline data 
from a longitudinal, multisite, observational study conducted from January 15, 
2021, to July 12, 2022, with no follow-up. The study was conducted at 13 ADNI3 
sites in the US. Participants included individuals aged 55 to 90 years without 
cognitive impairment and those with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer 
disease.
EXPOSURES: Efforts included (1) launch of an external advisory board, (2) 
changes to the study protocol, (3) updates to the digital prescreener, (4) 
selection and deployment of 13 community-engaged research study sites, (5) 
development and deployment of local and centralized outreach efforts, and (6) 
development of a community-science partnership board.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Screening and enrollment numbers from centralized 
and local outreach efforts, digital advertisement metrics, and digital 
prescreener completion.
RESULTS: A total of 91 participants enrolled in the trial via centralized and 
local outreach efforts, of which 22 (24.2%) identified as Latinx and 55 (60.4%) 
identified as Black (median [IQR] age, 65.6 [IQR, 61.5-72.5] years; 62 women 
[68.1%]). This represented a 267.6% increase in the monthly rate of enrollment 
(before: 1.11 per month; during: 4.08 per month) of underrepresented 
populations. For the centralized effort, social media advertisements were run 
between June 1, 2021, and July 31, 2022, which resulted in 2079 completed 
digital prescreeners, of which 1289 met criteria for subsequent site-level 
screening. Local efforts were run between June 1, 2021, to July 31, 2022. A 
total of 151 participants underwent site-level screening (100 from local 
efforts, 41 from centralized efforts, 10 from other sources).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study of pilot inclusion 
efforts, a culturally informed, community-engaged approach increased the 
inclusion of Black and Latinx participants in an Alzheimer disease cohort study.

Preeclampsia (PE) is a life-threatening pregnancy-specific complication with 
controversial mechanisms and no effective treatment except delivery is 
available. Currently, increasing researchers suggested that PE shares 
pathophysiologic features with protein misfolding/aggregation disorders, such as 
Alzheimer disease (AD). Evidences have proposed defective autophagy as a 
potential source of protein aggregation in PE. Endoplasmic reticulum-selective 
autophagy (ER-phagy) plays a critical role in clearing misfolded proteins and 
maintaining ER homeostasis. However, its roles in the molecular pathology of PE 
remain unclear. We found that lncRNA DUXAP8 was upregulated in preeclamptic 
placentae and significantly correlated with clinical indicators. DUXAP8 
specifically binds to PCBP2 and inhibits its ubiquitination-mediated 
degradation, and decreased levels of PCBP2 reversed the activation effect of 
DUXAP8 overexpression on AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Function experiments showed 
that DUXAP8 overexpression inhibited trophoblastic proliferation, migration, and 
invasion of HTR-8/SVneo and JAR cells. Moreover, pathological accumulation of 
swollen and lytic ER (endoplasmic reticulum) was observed in 
DUXAP8-overexpressed HTR8/SVneo cells and PE placental villus trophoblast cells, 
which suggesting that ER clearance ability is impaired. Further studies found 
that DUXAP8 overexpression impaired ER-phagy and caused protein aggregation 
medicated by reduced FAM134B and LC3II expression (key proteins involved in 
ER-phagy) via activating AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. The increased level of 
FAM134B significantly reversed the inhibitory effect of DUXAP8 overexpression on 
the proliferation, migration, and invasion of trophoblasts. In vivo, DUXAP8 
overexpression through tail vein injection of adenovirus induced PE-like 
phenotypes in pregnant rats accompanied with activated AKT/mTOR signaling, 
decreased expression of FAM134B and LC3-II proteins and increased protein 
aggregation in placental tissues. Our study reveals the important role of lncRNA 
DUXAP8 in regulating trophoblast biological behaviors through FAM134B-mediated 
ER-phagy, providing a new theoretical basis for understanding the pathogenesis 
of PE.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Cognitive impairment and dementia as well as affective 
disorders are common and debilitating syndromes that develop in people with 
Parkinson's disease (PwPD). The authors summarized recommendations for the 2023 
updated German guidelines on "Parkinson's disease" from the German Neurological 
Society (DGN), focusing on the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders.
METHODS: The recommendations were based on literature reviews, other relevant 
guidelines, and expert opinions.
RESULTS: Measurements to assess cognitive and affective states were reviewed for 
psychometric properties, use in routine clinical practice, and availability in 
German. To improve mild cognitive impairment, cognitive training and physical 
aerobic training are recommended. To treat Parkinson's disease (PD)-related 
dementia, cognitive stimulation (as a non-pharmacological intervention) and 
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs, i.e., rivastigmine) are recommended. 
Cognitive behavioral therapy is recommended to treat depression, anxiety, and 
fear of progression. Physical interventions are recommended to treat depression, 
fatigue, and apathy. Optimized dopaminergic treatment is the first-line 
pharmacological strategy recommended to manage depression, apathy, anhedonia, 
fatigue, and mood swings. Major depression can be additionally treated using 
venlafaxine or desipramine, while moderate depression can be treated 
pharmacologically according to its clinical phenotype (psychomotor retardation 
or agitation) and comorbidities (e.g., sleep disturbances, pain). Venlafaxine 
and nortriptyline can be used to treat anhedonia, while citalopram can be used 
for anxiety.
CONCLUSIONS: In addition to the updated pharmacological treatment options, new 
insights into recommendations for standardized diagnostics and 
non-pharmacological interventions were provided for the German health care 
system. However, more studies are needed to explore the full potential of 
non-pharmacological interventions to treat and prevent cognitive impairment and 
affective disorders.

Senescent cells accumulate throughout the body and brain contributing to 
unhealthy aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The APPNL-F/NL-F amyloidogenic AD 
mouse model exhibits increased markers of senescent cells and the 
senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in visceral white adipose 
tissue and the hippocampus before plaque accumulation and cognitive decline. We 
hypothesized that senolytic intervention would alleviate cellular senescence 
thereby improving spatial memory in APPNL-F/NL-F mice. Thus, 4-month-old male 
and female APPNL-F/NL-F mice were treated monthly with vehicle, 5 mg/kg 
dasatinib + 50 mg/kg quercetin, or 100 mg/kg fisetin. Blood glucose levels, 
energy metabolism, spatial memory, amyloid burden, and senescent cell markers 
were assayed. Dasatinib + quercetin treatment in female APPNL-F/NL-F mice 
increased oxygen consumption and energy expenditure resulting in decreased body 
mass. White adipose tissue mass was decreased along with senescence markers, 
SASP, blood glucose, and plasma insulin and triglycerides. Hippocampal 
senescence markers and SASP were reduced along with soluble and insoluble 
amyloid-β (Aβ)42 and senescence-associated-β-gal activity leading to improved 
spatial memory. Fisetin had negligible effects on these measures in female 
APPNL-F/NL-F mice while neither senolytic intervention altered these parameters 
in the male mice. Considering women have a greater risk of dementia, identifying 
senotherapeutics appropriate for sex and disease stage is necessary for 
personalized medicine.

The first objective is to highlight the lack of tools to measure whether a given 
intervention affords neuroprotection in patients with Alzheimer's or Parkinson's 
diseases. A second aim is to present the primary outcome measures used in 
clinical trials in cohorts of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. The 
final aim is to discuss whether metabolomics using body fluids may lead to the 
discovery of biomarkers of neuroprotection. Information on the primary outcome 
measures in clinical trials related to Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease 
registered since 2018 was collected. We analysed the type of measures selected 
to assess efficacy, not in terms of neuroprotection since, as stated in the 
aims, there is not yet any marker of neuroprotection. Proteomic approaches using 
plasma or CSF have been proposed. PET could estimate the extent of lesions, but 
disease progression does not necessarily correlate with a change in tracer 
uptake. We propose some alternatives based on considering the metabolome. A new 
opportunity opens with metabolomics because there have been impressive 
technological advances that allow the detection, among others, of metabolites 
related to mitochondrial function and mitochondrial structure in serum and/or 
cerebrospinal fluid; some of the differentially concentrated metabolites can 
become reliable biomarkers of neuroprotection.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an intricate endocrine disorder that targets 
millions of women globally. Recent research has drawn attention to its 
association with cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk, yet the 
exact mechanism remains elusive. This study aimed to explore the potential role 
of PCOS-associated insulin resistance (IR) and inflammation in linking PCOS to 
AD pathogenesis. It additionally investigated the therapeutic merits of 
pterostilbene (PTS) in ameliorating PCOS and associated cognitive deficits in 
comparison to metformin (MET). Rats were divided into five groups; vehicle 
group, PTS group [30 mg/kg, per os (p.o.) for 13 days], and the remaining three 
groups received letrozole (1 mg/kg, p.o. for 21 days) to represent the PCOS, 
PCOS + MET (300 mg/kg, p.o. for 13 days), and PCOS + PTS groups, respectively. 
Behavioral tests were conducted, along with a histopathological investigation of 
brains and ovaries. Assessment of serum hormonal profile and hippocampal 
IRS-1/PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β insulin signaling pathway components were performed. PTS 
rats exhibited improved insulin sensitivity and hormonal profile, besides 
enhanced neurobehavioral tests performance and histopathological findings. These 
effects may be attributed to modulation of the IRS-1/PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β pathway, 
reducing GSK-3β activity, and mitigating Tau hyperphosphorylation and Aβ 
accumulation in the brain. Likewise, PTS attenuated nuclear factor kappa 
B-mediated inflammation and reversed AChE elevation, suggesting multifaceted 
neuroprotective effects. Comparatively, PTS showed outcomes similar to those of 
MET in most parameters. The obtained findings validated that dysregulated 
insulin signaling in PCOS rats detrimentally affects cognitive function, which 
is halted by PTS, unveiling the potential of PTS as a novel therapy for PCOS and 
related cognitive deficits.

University, Luzhou, Sichuan, China.

BACKGROUND: In recent years, with the rapid advancement of fundamental 
ultrasonography research, the application of ultrasound in disease treatment has 
progressively increased. An increasing body of research indicates that 
microbubbles serve not only as contrast agents but also in conjunction with 
ultrasound, enhancing cavitation effects and facilitating targeted drug 
delivery, thereby augmenting therapeutic efficacy. The objective of this study 
is to explore the current status and prevailing research trends in this field 
from 2009 to 2023 through bibliometric analysis and to forecast future 
developmental trajectories.
METHODS: We selected the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-Expanded) from the 
Web of Science Core Collection (WOSCC) as our primary data source. On 19 January 
2024, we conducted a comprehensive search encompassing all articles and reviews 
published between 2009 and 2023 and utilized the bibliometric online analysis 
platform, CiteSpace and VOSviewer software to analyze countries/regions, 
institutions, authors, keywords, and references, used Microsoft Excel 2021 to 
visualize the trends of the number of articles published by year.
RESULTS: Between 1 January 2009, and 31 December 2023, 3,326 publications on 
ultrasound combined with microbubble therapy technology were included. There 
were a total of 2,846 articles (85.6%) and 480 reviews (14.4%) from 13,062 
scholars in 68 countries/regions published in 782 journals. China and the United 
States emerged as the primary contributors in this domain. In terms of 
publication output and global institutional collaboration, the University of 
Toronto in Canada has made the most significant contribution to this field. 
Professor Kullervo Hynynen has achieved remarkable accomplishments in this area. 
Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology is at the core of the publishing of research 
on ultrasound combined with microbubble therapy technology. Keywords such as 
"sonodynamic therapy," "oxygen," "loaded microbubbles" and "Alzheimer's disease" 
indicate emerging trends in the field and hold the potential to evolve into 
significant areas of future investigation.
CONCLUSION: This study provides a summary of the key contributions of ultrasound 
combined with microbubble therapy to the field's development over the past 
15 years and delves into the historical underpinnings and contemporary trends of 
ultrasound combined with microbubble therapy technology, providing valuable 
guidance for researchers.

Neurological diseases often manifest with psychiatric symptoms, profoundly 
impacting patients' well-being and treatment outcomes. This comprehensive review 
examines the psychiatric manifestations associated with Alzheimer's disease, 
frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis (MS), 
stroke, epilepsy, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), 
traumatic brain injury (TBI), and multiple system atrophy (MSA). Key psychiatric 
symptoms include agitation, depression, anxiety, apathy, hallucinations, 
impulsivity, and aggression across these diseases. In addition, ethical 
considerations in treating these symptoms are paramount, particularly regarding 
genetic testing implications, end-of-life discussions, informed consent, and 
equitable access to innovative treatments. Effective management necessitates 
interdisciplinary collaboration, personalized interventions, and a focus on 
patient autonomy. Understanding the psychiatric burden of neurological diseases 
is crucial for enhancing patients' quality of life. Further research is needed 
to elucidate underlying mechanisms and develop targeted interventions. This 
review underscores the importance of comprehensive assessment and ethical 
treatment practices to address psychiatric manifestations effectively.

BACKGROUND: Wandering behaviour affects a significant portion of dementia 
patients, ranging from 15% to 80%, presenting a serious safety concern and 
adding to caregivers' burden. Recent studies emphasise the effectiveness of 
non-pharmacological interventions over pharmacological ones due to their minimal 
side effects. Consequently, in current literature there has been a surge of 
interest in exploring non-pharmacological methods for managing wandering.
PURPOSE: This integrative literature review aims to deepen comprehension of 
wandering behaviour, presents recent studies on non-pharmacological approaches, 
and inspires further research in this field.
METHODS: Electronic data collection spanned from 2019 to 2024, sourcing 20 
relevant articles from PubMed and Scopus databases using search terms such as 
'dementia', 'Alzheimer's disease', 'wandering', and 'management'. A thematic 
analysis methodology was employed to identify non-pharmacological treatment 
themes for managing wandering. This approach involves scrutinising and 
synthesising themes within the dataset. Qualitative data analysis focused on 
significant phrases and keywords, grouping them to derive relevant themes.
RESULTS: Recent literature extensively explores non-pharmacological methods for 
managing wandering. These include understanding behaviours, identifying and 
targeting high-risk groups, facilitating safe wandering, addressing 
environmental factors, promoting exercise and activity, and offering caregiver 
support.
CONCLUSIONS: This study significantly advances understanding of wandering 
behaviour and highlights recent research on non-pharmacological interventions. 
The findings suggest the potential for providing safe and effective treatment to 
wandering dementia patients, thereby alleviating stress for both patients and 
caregivers.

The aims of this paper are to estimate the monetary value of informal care for 
people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in Spain, to compare results with those 
obtained in 2008 and to analyse the main determinants of the time of the value 
of informal care. The Survey on Disabilities, Autonomy and Dependency carried 
out in Spain in 2020/21 was used to obtain information about disabled 
individuals with AD and their informal caregivers. Assessment of informal care 
time was carried out using two alternative approaches: the replacement method, 
and the contingent valuation method (willingness to pay & willingness to 
accept). The number of people with AD residing in Spanish households and 
receiving informal care rose to more than 200,000, representing an increase of 
43% compared with 2008. The average number of hours of informal care per week 
ranged from 86 to 101 h, with an estimated value of between €31,584 - €37,019 
per year per caregiver (willingness to accept) or €71,653 - €83,984 per year 
(replacement). The annual total number of caregiving hours ranged between 896 
and 1,061 million hours, representing between 0.52 and 0.62 of GDP in 2021 
(willingness to accept) or 1.19-1.40 of GDP (replacement). The level of care 
needs plays a central role in explaining heterogeneity in estimates. These 
results should be taken into account by decision-makers for long-term care 
planning in the coming years.

Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects elderly, and 
its incidence is continuously increasing across the globe. Unfortunately, 
despite decades of research, a complete cure for Alzheimer's disease continues 
to elude us. The current medications are mainly symptomatic and slow the disease 
progression but do not result in reversal of all disease pathologies. The 
growing body of knowledge on the factors responsible for the onset and 
progression of the disease has resulted in the identification of new targets 
that could be targeted for treatment of Alzheimer's disease. This has opened new 
vistas for treatment of Alzheimer's disease that have moved away from 
chemotherapeutic agents modulating a single target to biologics and combinations 
that acted on multiple targets thereby offering better therapeutic outcomes. 
This review discusses the emerging directions in therapeutic interventions 
against Alzheimer's disease highlighting their merits that promise to change the 
treatment paradigm and challenges that limit their clinical translation.

Neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis are central pathogenic consequences 
associated with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Parkinson's Disease (PD). Limonin 
(LM), a tetracyclic triterpenoid available in citrus fruits, has anti-tumor, 
antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, and neuroprotective actions. 
LM derivative, V-A-4 emerged as a potential neuroprotective drug due to their 
ability to target multiple molecular pathways intertwined with neuroinflammation 
and neuronal apoptosis. To date, the treatment of AD and PD is not successful 
even though the understanding of the mechanism of neuroinflammation and neuronal 
apoptosis is vast in the literature. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify 
novel neuroprotective drugs that could target the multiple molecular pathways 
associated with neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis. The various online 
databases (Google scholar, Pubmed, Scopus) were searched via keywords: limonin, 
limonin derivatives and neuroprotection. This review highlights the 
multifunctional nature of LM and derivatives in combating neuroinflammation and 
neuronal apoptosis by stimulating PI3K/AKT and downregulating TLR4/NF-κB 
critical pathways. By intervening in the secretion of NO and TNF-α from glial 
cells, V-A-4 attenuates the damaging cascade of neuroinflammation by suppressing 
IKK-α and IKK-β. Furthermore, V-A-4 demonstrates its versatility by suppressing 
the manifestation of miR-146a and miR-155, both intimately linked to 
neuroinflammation, this review summarized the activities of LM and its 
derivatives against AD and PD, with a special focus on V-A-4 as an effective 
neuroprotective drug. V-A-4's ability to stimulate PI3K/AKT signaling further 
underscores its neuroprotective effect in combating AD and PD. More in-vitro 
cell line studies are needed to develop V-A-4 as an upcoming neuroprotective 
compound.

Chronic inflammation is an important pathogenetic factor that leads to the 
progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and specialized pro-resolving lipid 
mediators (SPMs) play critical role in regulating inflammatory responses during 
AD pathogenesis. Maresin1 (MaR1) is the latest discovered SPMs, and it is found 
that MaR1 improves AD cognitive impairment by regulating neurotrophic pathways 
to protect AD synapses and reduce Aβ production, which made MaR1 as candidate 
agent for AD treatment. Unfortunately, the underlying mechanisms are still 
largely known. In this study, the AD mice and cellular models were subjected to 
MaR1 treatment, and we found that MaR1 reduced Aβ production to ameliorate 
AD-related symptoms and increased the expression levels of ADAM10/17, sAPPα and 
sAPPβ to exert its anti-inflammatory role. In addition, as it was determined by 
Western Blot analysis, we observed that MaR1 could affected the neuroprotective 
signal pathways. Specifically, MaR1 downregulated p57NTR and upregulated TrkA to 
activate the p75NTR/TrkA signal pathway, and it could increase the expression 
levels of p-PI3K and p-Akt, and downregulated p-mTOR to activate the 
PI3K/AKT/ERK/mTOR pathway. Finally, we verified the role of ADAM10/17 in 
regulating AD progression, and we found that silencing of ADAM10/17 inactivated 
the above neuroprotective signal pathways to aggravate AD pathogenesis. In 
conclusion, MaR1 is verified as potential therapeutic agent for AD by 
eliminating Aβ production, upregulating ADAM10/17, sAPPα and sAPPβ, and 
activating the neuroprotective p75NTR/TrkA pathway and the PI3K/AKT/ERK/mTOR 
pathway.

BACKGROUND: Chemokine ligands and their corresponding receptors are essential 
for regulating inflammatory responses. Chemokine receptors can stimulate immune 
activation or inhibit/promote signaling pathways by binding to specific 
chemokine ligands. Among these receptors, CC chemokine receptor 1 (CCR1) is 
extensively studied as a G protein-linked receptor target, predominantly 
expressed in various leukocytes, and is considered a promising target for 
anti-inflammatory therapy. Furthermore, CCR1 is essential for monocyte 
extravasation and transportation in inflammatory conditions. Its involvement in 
inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system (CNS), including multiple 
sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and stroke, has been extensively studied along 
with its ligands. Animal models have demonstrated the beneficial effects 
resulting from inhibiting CCR1 or its ligands.
SUMMARY: This review demonstrates the significance of CCR1 in CNS inflammatory 
diseases, the molecules implicated in the inflammatory pathway, and potential 
drugs or molecules for treating CNS diseases. This evidence may offer new 
targets or strategies for treating inflammatory CNS diseases.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-dependent incurable neurodegenerative 
disorder accompanied by neuroinflammation, amyloid accumulation, and memory 
impairment. It begins decades before the first clinical symptoms appear, and 
identifying early biomarkers is key for developing disease-modifying therapies. 
We show now in a mouse model of AD that before any amyloid deposition the brains 
of 1.5-month-old mice contain increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines 
IL-1β and IL-6, decreased levels of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) 
in the brain and brain mitochondria and increased amounts of α7 nAChR-bound 
Aβ1-42, along with impaired episodic memory and increased risk of apoptosis. 
Both acute (1-week-long) and chronic (4-month-long) treatments with α7-selective 
agonist PNU282987, starting at 1.5 months of age, were well tolerated. The acute 
treatment did not affect the levels of soluble Aβ1-42 but consistently 
upregulated the α7 nAChR expression, decreased the level of α7-Aβ1-42 complexes, 
and improved episodic memory of 1.5-month-old mice. The chronic treatment, 
covering the disease development phase, strongly upregulated the expression of 
all abundant brain nAChRs, reduced both free and α7-coupled Aβ1-42 within the 
brain, had anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic effects, and potently upregulated 
cognition, thus identifying α7 nAChRs as both early biomarker and potent 
therapeutic target for fighting this devastating disease.

Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder caused by a dysfunction in insulin 
action or secretion, leading to an elevation in blood glucose levels. It is a 
highly prevalent condition and as a result, the NHS spends 10 % of its entire 
budget on diabetes mellitus care, that is equivalent to £10 billion a year. 
Diabetes mellitus has been linked with vascular and neurological complications 
which may be associated with the progression of neurodegeneration and 
Alzheimer's disease. Chronic hyperglycaemia increases the production of the 
reactive oxidant species (ROS) such as methylglyoxal (MGO). MGO has been linked 
with vascular complications, neuropathy and cytotoxicity. The main aim of this 
study was to investigate the potential beneficial effect of antidiabetic agents 
such as metformin and dapagliflozin on human brain neuronal cells (SH-SY5Y) 
treated with MGO. SH-SY5Y cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 media and subjected 
overnight incubation with one of the following treatment conditions: Control 
(untreated); MGO (1 μM); MGO (100 μM); metformin (100 μM) + MGO (100 μM); and 
dapagliflozin (10 μM) + MGO (100 μM). Several assays were conducted to explore 
the effect of the treatment groups on the SH-SY5Y cells. These included: MTT 
assay; LDH assay, peroxynitrite fluorescence assay, and laser scanning confocal 
microscopy. MGO (100 μM) led to significant cell injury and damage and 
significantly reduced the survival of the cells by approximately 50-75 %, 
associated with significant increase in peroxynitrite. The addition of metformin 
(100 μM) or dapagliflozin (10 μM) represented significant protective effects on 
the cells and prevented the cell damage caused by the high MGO concentration. As 
a result, the findings of this research reveal that MGO-induced cell damage may 
partly be mediated by the generation of peroxynitrite, while the antidiabetic 
agents such as metformin and dapagliflozin prevent brain cell death, which 
potentially may play prophylactic roles against the risk of dementia in diabetic 
patients.

Cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease is associated with 
electroencephalographic (EEG) biosignatures even at early stages of mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI). The aim of this work is to provide a unified measure 
of cognitive decline by aggregating biosignatures from multiple EEG modalities 
and to evaluate repeatability of the composite measure at an individual level. 
These modalities included resting state EEG (eyes-closed) and two event-related 
potential (ERP) tasks on visual memory and attention. We compared individuals 
with MCI (n = 38) to age-matched healthy controls HC (n = 44). In resting state 
EEG, the MCI group exhibited higher power in Theta (3-7Hz) and lower power in 
Beta (13-20Hz) frequency bands. In both ERP tasks, the MCI group exhibited 
reduced ERP late positive potential (LPP), delayed ERP early component latency, 
slower reaction time, and decreased response accuracy. Cluster-based permutation 
analysis revealed significant clusters of difference between the MCI and HC 
groups in the frequency-channel and time-channel spaces. Cluster-based measures 
and performance measures (12 biosignatures in total) were selected as predictors 
of MCI. We trained a support vector machine (SVM) classifier achieving AUC = 
0.89, accuracy = 77% in cross-validation using all data. Split-data validation 
resulted in (AUC = 0.87, accuracy = 76%) and (AUC = 0.75, accuracy = 70%) on 
testing data at baseline and follow-up visits, respectively. Classification 
scores at baseline and follow-up visits were correlated (r = 0.72, p<0.001, ICC 
= 0.84), supporting test-retest reliability of EEG biosignature. These results 
support the utility of EEG/ERP for prognostic testing, repeated assessments, and 
tracking potential treatment outcomes in the limited duration of clinical 
trials.

Phase four of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI4) magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) protocols aim to maintain longitudinal consistency 
across two decades of data acquisition, while adopting new technologies. Here we 
describe and justify the study's design and targeted biomarkers. The ADNI4 MRI 
protocol includes nine MRI sequences. Some sequences require the latest hardware 
and software system upgrades and are continuously rolled out as they become 
available at each site. The main sequence additions/changes in ADNI4 are: (1) 
compressed sensing (CS) T1-weighting, (2) pseudo-continuous arterial spin 
labeling (ASL) on all three vendors (GE, Siemens, Philips), (3) 
multiple-post-labeling-delay ASL, (4) 1 mm3 isotropic 3D fluid-attenuated 
inversion recovery, and (5) CS 3D T2-weighted. ADNI4 aims to help the 
neuroimaging community extract valuable imaging biomarkers and provide a 
database to test the impact of advanced imaging strategies on diagnostic 
accuracy and disease sensitivity among individuals lying on the cognitively 
normal to impaired spectrum. HIGHLIGHTS: A summary of MRI protocols for phase 
four of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI 4). The design and 
justification for the ADNI 4 MRI protocols. Compressed sensing and multi-band 
advances have been applied to improve scan time. ADNI4 protocols aim to 
streamline safety screening and therapy monitoring. The ADNI4 database will be a 
valuable test bed for academic research.

Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. 
Inflammatory response after stroke determines the outcome of ischemic injury. A 
recent study has reported an efficient method, epidural arterial implantation 
(EAI), for accelerating interstitial fluid (ISF) drainage, which provides a 
promising strategy to clear pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brain 
extracellular space (ECS). In this study, the method of EAI was modified (m-EAI) 
to control its function of accelerating the ISF drainage at different time 
points following ischemic attack. The neuroprotective effect of m-EAI on 
ischemic stroke was evaluated with the transient middle cerebral artery 
occlusion (tMCAO) rat model. The results demonstrated the accumulation of IL-1β, 
IL-6, and TNF-α was significantly decreased by activating m-EAI at 7 d before 
and immediately after ischemic attack in tMCAO rats, accompanied with decreased 
infarct volume and improved neurological function. This study consolidates the 
hypothesis of exacerbated ischemic damage by inflammatory response and provides 
a new perspective to treat encephalopathy via brain ECS. Further research is 
essential to investigate whether m-EAI combined with neuroprotective drugs could 
enhance the therapeutic effect on ischemic stroke.

Attrition is a particular concern in studies examining the efficacy of a 
treatment for Alzheimer disease. Analyzing reasons for withdrawal in Alzheimer 
studies is crucial to ruling out attrition bias, which can undermine a study's 
validity. In contrast, attrition in studies using repetitive transcranial 
magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has received much less attention. Our goal was to 
identify any commonalities between participants who withdrew for the same 
reasons. Three independent coders rated each response concerning the reasons for 
withdrawal, and frequency tables were generated to characterize the participants 
within each category. This study was conducted on the 28 withdrawn cases from a 
7-month study investigating the short-term and long-term therapeutic effects of 
rTMS for Alzheimer disease among 156 participants across 3 sites of the study. 
Seven reasons for withdrawal were identified, with health and medical changes 
being the most commonly reported reason (7 participants). Personal issues 
involving family or caregivers were the next most common (5 participants), and 
the remaining 5 categories consisted of 3 participants each. Although the 
limited sample size prevented the use of inferential statistics, our findings 
highlight the need for more transparent reporting of attrition rates and 
withdrawal reasons by rTMS researchers.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition 
characterized by gradual cognitive impairment, including loss of synapses and 
nerve cells involved in learning, memory, and habit formation processes. Bone 
Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells (BM-MSCs) are multipotent cells. Because of their 
self-renewable, differentiation, and immunomodulatory capabilities, they are 
commonly used to treat many disorders. Hence, the current study intends to 
examine the effect of BM-MSCs transplantation on Aluminum chloride 
(AlCl3)-induced cognitive problems, an experimental model resembling AD's 
hallmarks in rats.
METHODS: The study was conducted in 2022 at The Biomedical Laboratory Faculty of 
Medicine, Andalas University, Indonesia. Adult male Wistar rats (three groups: 
negative control; no intervention+treatment with PBS; positive control: 
AlCl3+treatment with aqua dest; AlCl3+BM-MSCs: AlCl3+treatment with BM-MSCs, n=5 
each) were treated daily with AlCl3 orally for five days. Stem cells were 
intraperitoneally injected into rats at a dose of 1x106 cells/rat. The same 
quantity of phosphate-buffered saline was given to the control group. One month 
after stem cell injection, the rat brain tissue was removed and placed in the 
film bottles that had been created. The expression of neural progenitor cell 
markers, including nestin and sex-determining Y-box 2 (SOX-2), was analyzed 
using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Rats' cognitive and 
functional memory were examined using Y-maze. Data were analyzed using SPSS 
software (version 26.0) with a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test.
RESULTS: The gene expression of nestin (29.74±0.42), SOX-2 (31.44±0.67), and 
percent alternation of Y-maze (67.04±2.28) increased in the AlCl3+BM-MSCs group 
compared to that in the positive control group. RT-PCR analysis indicated that 
nestin (P<0.001) and SOX-2 (P<0.001) were significantly enhanced in the 
AlCl3+BM-MSCs group compared to the positive control group. This group also 
indicated an increased percent alternation of Y-maze (P<0.001) in the 
AlCl3+BM-MSCs group compared to the positive control group.
CONCLUSION: Due to its potential effects on cell therapy, BM-MSCs were found 
effective in a rat model of AD on the impairment of the rats' behavior and 
increased expression of neural progenitor cell markers.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is a 
progressive neurodegenerative disorder that predominantly affects the elderly 
population. Traditional assessment methods, including neuropsychological tests 
like the MMSE, have been the cornerstone of AD diagnosis for decades. These 
methods are grounded in a wealth of research and clinical experience, providing 
a robust framework for understanding the cognitive deficits of AD. The evolution 
of AD assessment and rehabilitation has recently been tackled with the 
introduction of Virtual Reality (VR) technologies.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the use of storytelling and reminiscence therapy in 
virtual reality programs as a complementary and enhancing modality alongside 
standard assessment and rehabilitation for Alzheimer's patients. To explore how 
regular interaction with VR narratives can slow cognitive decline or improve 
relevant features of cognitive functioning over the time. To propose a new 
assessment and rehabilitative tool based on the use of VR and digital 
storytelling.
METHOD: A comparative analysis of Standard Neuropsychological Approaches and 
Virtual Reality Interventions in patients with Alzheimer disorder was carried 
out. A literature overview on the empirical studies between 2019 and 2024 was 
conducted.
RESULTS: We propose a new VR-based setup mediated by the use of storytelling for 
the assessment and recovery of AD.
CONCLUSION: The employment of storytelling within VR programs for the assessment 
and rehabilitation of Alzheimer's disease can positively impact both the 
cognitive and emotional realms of patients, with beneficial outcomes on 
caregivers' and families' burden. The successful implementation of this approach 
requires careful consideration of accessibility, data interpretation, and 
standard validation protocols.

BACKGROUND: Age-related neuronal changes impact cognitive integrity, which is a 
major contributor to health and quality of life. The best strategy to prevent 
cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease is still debated.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the long-term effects of the eight-week multicomponent 
training program BrainProtect® on cognitive abilities compared to general health 
counseling (GHC) in cognitively healthy adults in Germany.
METHODS: Healthy adults (age ≥50 years) previously randomized to either GHC 
(n = 72) or BrainProtect (intervention group, IG, n = 60) for eight-weeks (once 
weekly, 90 minutes, group-based) underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological 
test battery and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) evaluation 3- and 
12-months after intervention end.
RESULTS: Dropout rates were n = 8 after 3 months and n = 19 after 12 months. No 
significant long-term effect of BrainProtect was observed for the primary 
endpoint Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD-Plus) 
total score. Logical reasoning was significantly improved (p = 0.024) 12 months 
after completion of the training program in IG participants compared to the GHC 
group independent of sex, age, education, diet, and physical activity. In IG 
participants, thinking flexibility (p = 0.019) and confrontational naming 
(p = 0.010) were improved 3 months after completing the intervention compared to 
the GHC group, however, after conservative Bonferroni adjustment, significance 
was lost.
CONCLUSIONS: BrainProtect® independently improved logical reasoning compared to 
GHC up to 12 months after cognitive training's end in healthy adults. To uncover 
the long-term clinical significance of multicomponent cognitive training in 
healthy adults, studies with larger sample size and frequent follow up visits 
are necessary.

BACKGROUND: Many observational studies have investigated the link between the 
gut microbiota and Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the causality remains 
uncertain.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the causal impact of gut microbiota on 
AD.
METHODS: A two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study was conducted employing 
summary data. Summary statistics for AD were from the latest genome-wide 
association study (cases and proxy cases: 85,934; controls: 401,577). Summary 
data for gut microbiota were acquired from MiBioGen consortium. Causal effect 
estimations primarily relied on the inverse variance weighting method along with 
the sensitivity analyses for testing for pleiotropy and heterogeneity. 
Additionally, reverse MR analyses were performed to examine potential reverse 
causality.
RESULTS: Seven gut microbiota were identified as associated with AD risk. Order 
Selenomonadales (odds ratio [OR] 1.13, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-1.24, 
p = 0.01), Family Pasteurellaceae (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.01-1.13, p = 0.01), and 
Genus Methanobrevibacter (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.00-1.13, p = 0.04) were correlated 
with an elevated likelihood of AD, while Class Mollicutes (OR 0.87, 95% CI 
0.79-0.95, p = 0.00), Genus Ruminiclostridium9 (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.78-0.97, 
p = 0.01), Genus Clostridiuminnocuumgroup (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.89-0.99, p = 0.03), 
and Genus Eggerthella (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.89-1.00, p = 0.04) exerted beneficial 
impact in mitigating AD. No statistically significant reverse causality was 
found between AD and each of these seven specific gut microbiota species.
CONCLUSIONS: This study unveiled a causal link between certain gut microbiota 
and AD, offering new insights for advancing clinical treatments.

BACKGROUND: Glycogen synthase-3 kinase (GSK3) is one of the major contributors 
of tau hyperphosphorylation linked to neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD).
OBJECTIVE: To determine a mechanism of GSK-3β activation by two periodontal 
bacteria consistently confirmed in AD autopsied brains.
METHODS: Porphyromonas gingivalis FDC381 and Actinomyces naeslundii ATCC10301 
conditioned media were collected. IMR-32 cells were challenged for 48 h with the 
conditioned media alongside P. gingivalis (ATCC33277) ultrapurified 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) designated Pg.LPS under established cell culture 
conditions either alone or combined. Gene expression and protein analyses for 
GSK-3β were carried out.
RESULTS: qPCR demonstrated that GSK-3β gene was overexpressed in IMR-32 cells 
treated with Pg.LPS with a 2.09-fold change (p = 0.0005), while A. naeslundii 
treated cells demonstrated 1.41-fold change (p = 0.004). Western blotting of the 
cells challenged with Pg.LPS (p = 0.01) and A. naeslundii conditioned medium 
(p = 0.001) demonstrated the 37 kDa band for each treatment with variable 
intensity across the medium control. Immunohistochemistry with the GSK-3β of the 
IMR-32 cells challenged with Pg.LPS and A. naeslundii alone demonstrated 
cytoplasmic and nuclear localization.
CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to various bacterial factors upregulated the gene 
expression of GSK-3β. Western blotting for GSK-3β confirmed the presence of the 
cleaved fragment by Pg.LPS (37 kDa band p = 0.01) and A. naeslundii conditioned 
medium (37 kDa band p = 0.001). Immunostaining demonstrated both cytoplasmic and 
nuclear localization of GSK-3β. Therefore, Pg.LPS and an unknown factor from the 
A. naeslundii conditioned medium mediated GSK-3β activation via its 
transcriptionally active, cleaved, fragment. These virulence factors in the body 
appear to be detrimental to brain health.

With the advent of the first generation of disease-modifying treatments for 
Alzheimer's disease, it is clearer now more than ever that the field needs to 
move toward personalized medicine. Pooling data from past trials may help 
identify subgroups most likely to benefit from specific treatments and thus 
inform future trial design. In this perspective, we report on our effort to pool 
data from past Alzheimer's disease trials to identify patients most likely to 
respond to different treatments. We delineate challenges and hurdles, from our 
proof-of-principle study, for which we requested access to trial datasets from 
various pharmaceutical companies and encountered obstacles in the process of 
arranging data-sharing agreements through legal departments. Six phase I-III 
trials from three sponsors provided access to their data (total n = 3170), which 
included demographic information, vital signs, primary and secondary endpoints, 
and in a small subset, cerebrospinal fluid amyloid (n = 165, 5.2%) and tau (n = 
212, 6.7%). Data could be analyzed only within specific data access platforms, 
limiting potential harmonization with data provided through other platforms. 
Limited overlap in terms of outcome measures, clinical and biological 
information hindered analyses. Thus, while it is a commendable advancement that 
(some) trials now allow researchers to study their data, we conclude that 
gaining access to past trial datasets is complicated, frustrating the field's 
communal effort to find the best treatments for the right individuals. We 
provide a plea to promote harmonization and open access to data, by urging trial 
sponsors and the academic research community alike to remove barriers to data 
access and improve collaboration through practicing open science and harmonizing 
outcome measures, to allow investigators to learn all there is to learn from 
past failures and successes.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) has an increasing prevalence, complicated pathogenesis 
and no effective cure. Emerging evidences show that flavonoid compounds such as 
xanthohumol (Xn) could play an important role as a dietary supplement or 
traditional Chinese herbal medicine in the management of diseases such as AD. 
This study aims to analyze the target molecules of Xn in the prevention and 
treatment of AD, and its potential mechanism from the perspective of 
metabolites. APP/PS1 mice 2- and 6-months old were treated with Xn for 3 months, 
respectively, the younger animals to test for AD-like brain disease prevention 
and the older animals to address therapeutic effects on the disease. Memantine 
(Mem) was selected as positive control. Behavioral tests were performed to 
assess the course of cognitive function. Urine samples were collected and 
analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with tandem mass 
spectrometry (MS/MS) coupled with online Compound Discoverer software. Morris 
Water Maze (MWM) tests showed that Xn, like Mem, had a therapeutic but not a 
preventive effect on cognitive impairment. The expression levels of urinary 
metabolites appeared to show an opposite trend at different stages of Xn 
treatment, downregulated in the prevention phase while upregulated in the 
therapy phase. In addition, the metabolic mechanisms of Xn during preventive 
treatment were also different from that during therapeutic treatment. The 
signaling pathways metabolites nordiazepam and genistein were specifically 
regulated by Xn but not by Mem in the disease prevention stage. The signaling 
pathway metabolite ascorbic acid was specifically regulated by Xn in the 
therapeutic stage. In conclusion, dietary treatment with Xn altered the urinary 
metabolite profile at different stages of administration in APP/PS1 mice. The 
identified potential endogenous metabolic biomarkers and signal pathways open 
new avenues to investigate the pathogenesis and treatment of AD.

Background: Triggering receptor expressed in myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), a 
transmembrane receptor, has garnered extensive research attention due to its 
pivotal role in the diagnosis and treatment of various diseases. Despite the 
abundance of studies on its function, there is a gap in comprehensive analysis 
and summarization of the current state of this research field. Methods: Articles 
and reviews related to TREM2 were retrieved from the Web of Science Core 
Collection (WOSCC) on October 1, 2023. A bibliometric analysis of TREM2 was 
conducted using CiteSpace, VOSviewer and Bibliometrix (R package). Results: A 
total of 1,502 articles, spanning from 2001 to 2022, met the search criteria. 
The number of publications and citations has increased steadily over the years. 
The United States and China are the most active countries in TREM2 research, 
with the University of Washington as the leading research institution. The most 
influential journal in the field is Neurology of Aging. The predominant research 
areas include molecular, biology and immunology. Alzheimer's disease, microglia, 
variants, and inflammation are significant keywords. Emerging directions such as 
metabolism and tumor microenvironment have recently gained attention in numerous 
studies. Conclusion: The current study utilizes bibliometric analysis software 
and visual graphics to intuitively highlight TREM2-related hotspots, trends, and 
prospects in human disease. Such insights are valuable for scholars seeking a 
deeper understanding of TREM2-related research progress, enabling a focused 
approach to its application in human disease.

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has been associated with adverse effects on 
the brain. ADT leads to altered testosterone levels that may affect brain 
morphology as well as cognition. Considering the reliability of cortical 
thickness (CT) as a marker of cognitive and brain changes, e.g., in Alzheimer's 
disease, we assessed the impacts of ADT on CT and working memory. Thirty men 
with non-metastatic prostate cancer receiving ADT and 32 patients not receiving 
ADT (controls or CON), matched in age and years of education, participated in 
N-back task and quality-of-life (QoL) assessments as well as brain imaging at 
baseline and prospectively at 6 months. Imaging data were processed with 
published routines to estimate CT and the results of a group by time flexible 
factorial analysis were evaluated at a corrected threshold. ADT and CON did not 
differ in N-back performance or QoL across time points. Relative to CON, 
patients receiving ADT showed significantly higher frontopolar cortex (FPC) CT 
at 6-month follow-up vs. baseline. Follow-up vs. baseline FPC CT change 
correlated negatively with changes in 2-back correct response rate and in 
testosterone levels across all participants. In mediation analysis, FPC CT 
change mediated the association between testosterone level change and 2-back 
accuracy rate change. Increases in FPC CT following 6 months of ADT may reflect 
early neurodegenerative changes in response to androgen deprivation. While no 
significant impact on working memory or QoL was observed over 6 months, further 
research of longer duration of treatment is warranted to unravel the full 
spectrum of cognitive and neural consequences of ADT in prostate cancer 
patients.

Background : Focused ultrasound (FUS) in combination with microbubbles has 
recently shown great promise in facilitating blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening 
for drug delivery and immunotherapy in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it is 
currently limited to systems integrated within the MRI suites or requiring 
post-surgical implants, thus restricting its widespread clinical adoption. In 
this pilot study, we investigate the clinical safety and feasibility of a 
portable, non-invasive neuronavigation-guided FUS (NgFUS) system with integrated 
real-time 2-D microbubble cavitation mapping. Methods : A phase 1 clinical study 
with mild to moderate AD patients (N = 6) underwent a single session of 
microbubble-mediated NgFUS to induce transient BBB opening (BBBO). Microbubble 
activity under FUS was monitored with real-time 2-D cavitation maps and dosing 
to ensure the efficacy and safety of the NgFUS treatment. Post-operative MRI was 
used for BBB opening and closure confirmation as well as safety assessment. 
Changes in AD biomarker levels in both blood serum and extracellular vesicles 
(EVs) were evaluated, while changes in amyloid-beta (Aβ) load in the brain were 
assessed through 18F-florbetapir PET. Results : BBBO was achieved in 5 out of 6 
subjects with an average volume of 983 ± 626 mm3 following FUS at the right 
frontal lobe both in white and gray matter regions. The outpatient treatment was 
completed within 34.8 ± 10.7 min. Cavitation dose significantly correlated with 
the BBBO volume (R 2 > 0.9, N = 4), demonstrating the portable NgFUS system's 
capability of predicting opening volumes. The cavitation maps co-localized 
closely with the BBBO location, representing the first report of real-time 
transcranial 2-D cavitation mapping in the human brain. Larger opening volumes 
correlated with increased levels of AD biomarkers, including Aβ42 (R 2 = 0.74), 
Tau (R 2 = 0.95), and P-Tau181 (R 2 = 0.86), assayed in serum-derived EVs 
sampled 3 days after FUS (N = 5). From PET scans, subjects showed a lower Aβ 
load increase in the treated frontal lobe region compared to the contralateral 
region. Reduction in asymmetry standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR) 
correlated with the cavitation dose (R 2 > 0.9, N = 3). Clinical changes in the 
mini-mental state examination over 6 months were within the expected range of 
cognitive decline with no additional changes observed as a result of FUS. 
Conclusion : We showed the safety and feasibility of this cost-effective and 
time-efficient portable NgFUS treatment for BBBO in AD patients with the first 
demonstration of real-time 2-D cavitation mapping. The cavitation dose 
correlated with BBBO volume, a slowed increase in pathology, and serum detection 
of AD proteins. Our study highlights the potential for accessible FUS treatment 
in AD, with or without drug delivery.

Background: The impediment to β-amyloid (Aβ) clearance caused by the invalid 
intracranial lymphatic drainage in Alzheimer's disease is pivotal to its 
pathogenesis, and finding reliable clinical available solutions to address this 
challenge remains elusive. Methods: The potential role and underlying mechanisms 
of intranasal oxytocin administration, an approved clinical intervention, in 
improving intracranial lymphatic drainage in middle-old-aged APP/PS1 mice were 
investigated by live mouse imaging, ASL/CEST-MRI scanning, in vivo two-photon 
imaging, immunofluorescence staining, ELISA, RT-qPCR, Western blotting, RNA-seq 
analysis, and cognitive behavioral tests. Results: Benefiting from multifaceted 
modulation of cerebral hemodynamics, aquaporin-4 polarization, meningeal 
lymphangiogenesis and transcriptional profiles, oxytocin administration 
normalized the structure and function of both the glymphatic and meningeal 
lymphatic systems severely impaired in middle-old-aged APP/PS1 mice. 
Consequently, this intervention facilitated the efficient drainage of Aβ from 
the brain parenchyma to the cerebrospinal fluid and then to the deep cervical 
lymph nodes for efficient clearance, as well as improvements in cognitive 
deficits. Conclusion: This work broadens the underlying neuroprotective 
mechanisms and clinical applications of oxytocin medication, showcasing its 
promising therapeutic prospects in central nervous system diseases with 
intracranial lymphatic dysfunction.

OBJECTIVES: This study investigates factors associated with the person with 
dementia and the caregiver to identify those associated with an increased risk 
of transition to a care home.
METHOD: IDEAL data were collected at baseline and at 12- and 24-month follow-up 
for 1545 people with dementia and 1305 caregivers. Modified Poisson regressions 
with an offset for 'person years at risk' were used. Person with dementia 
factors explored were personal characteristics, cognition, health, self- and 
informant-rated functional ability, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Caregiver 
factors explored were personal characteristics, stress, health, and quality of 
the dyadic relationship.
RESULTS: A 5% people moved into care. Risk of moving into a care home was higher 
among people with dementia who were ≥80 years, among people with Parkinson's 
disease dementia or dementia with Lewy bodies, and among those without a spousal 
caregiver. Poorer cognition and more self-rated or informant-rated functional 
difficulties increased the risk of moving into care.
CONCLUSION: Factors related to increased dementia severity and greater 
disability are the primary influences that place people with dementia at greater 
risk of moving into a care home. Strategies that help to maintain everyday 
functional ability for people with dementia could help delay people with 
dementia moving into care.

Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder with polygenic etiology. 
Genetic risk variants for Alzheimer's disease differ among populations. Thus, 
discovering them in each population is clinically important. A total of 118 
patients and 97 controls for VDR rs11568820 and 88 patients and 100 healthy 
controls for MTHFR C677T polymorphism were genotyped to evaluate the association 
of these polymorphisms with late-onset Alzheimer's disease in the Iranian 
population, along with their impacts on the response to Rivastigmine treatment. 
The VDR C allele was significantly associated with Alzheimer's disease and 
provided protection against it (P = 0.003, RR = 1.14, 95% CI 1.04-1.24), while 
the T allele increased susceptibility (P = 0.003, RR = 1.93, 95% CI 1.23-3.02). 
These results were also considerable upon excluding the effect of APOE ε4 
allele. The Prevalence-corrected Positive Predictive Value was 1.71% for the VDR 
CC genotype and 4% for the VDR CT genotype, indicating lower and almost twofold 
higher chances of developing Alzheimer's disease, respectively. No significant 
correlation was observed between MTHFR C677T and Alzheimer's disease. Based on 
our pharmacogenetic study, MTHFR T allele carriers lacking APOE ε4 allele showed 
a better response to Rivastigmine treatment after a 2-year follow-up. Moreover, 
patients with VDR CC genotype displayed milder Alzheimer's disease, particularly 
when coincided with the APOE ε4 allele. The VDR rs11568820 polymorphism affects 
both Alzheimer's disease risk and the response to Rivastigmine in Iranian 
patients. Also, MTHFR C677T polymorphism may play a role in the response to 
Rivastigmine, through a pathway that needs to be elucidated in future studies.

Cognitive impairment associated with diabetes and Alzheimer's disease has become 
a major health issue affecting older individuals, with morbidity rates growing 
acutely each year. Ferroptosis is a novel form of cell death that is triggered 
by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. A growing body of evidence suggests a 
strong correlation between the progression of cognitive impairment and diabetes, 
Alzheimer's disease, and ferroptosis. The pharmacological modulation of 
ferroptosis could be a promising therapeutic intervention for cognitive 
impairment associated with diabetes and Alzheimer's disease. In this review, we 
summarize evidence on ferroptosis in the context of cognitive impairment 
associated with diabetes and Alzheimer's disease and provide detailed insights 
into the function and potential action pathways of ferroptosis. Furthermore, we 
discuss the therapeutic importance of natural ferroptosis products in improving 
the cognitive impairment associated with diabetes and Alzheimer's disease and 
provide new insights for clinical treatment.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative brain disease that affects millions 
of people worldwide. It is caused by abnormalities in cholinergic neurons, 
oxidative stress, and inflammatory cascades. The illness is accompanied by 
personality changes, memory issues, and dementia. Metabolic signaling pathways 
help with fundamental processes like DNA replication and RNA transcription. 
Being adaptable is essential for both surviving and treating illness. The body's 
metabolic signaling depends on adipokines, including adiponectin (APN) and other 
adipokines secreted by adipose tissues. Energy homeostasis is balanced by 
adipokines, and nutrients. Overconsumption of nutrients messes with irregular 
signaling of adipokines, such as APN in both peripheral and brain which leads to 
neurodegeneration, such as AD. Despite the failure of traditional treatments 
like memantine and cholinesterase inhibitors, natural plant bioactive substances 
like Osmotin (OSM) have been given a focus as potential therapeutics due to 
their antioxidant properties, better blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability, 
excellent cell viability, and especially nanoparticle approaches. The review 
highlights the published preclinical literature regarding the role of OSM in AD 
pathology while there is a need for more research to investigate the hidden 
therapeutic potential of OSM which may open a new gateway and further strengthen 
its healing role in the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration, especially AD.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer disease (AD) and AD-related dementia are prevalent 
concerns for aging populations. With a growing older adult population living in 
the United States, the number of people living with dementia is expected to 
grow, posing significant challenges for informal caregivers. The mental and 
physical burdens associated with caregiving highlight the importance of 
developing novel and effective resources to support caregivers. However, 
technology solutions designed to address their needs often face low adoption 
rates due to usability issues and a lack of contextual relevance. This study 
focuses on developing a web-based platform providing financial and legal 
planning information and education for dementia caregivers and evaluating the 
platform's usability and adoptability.
OBJECTIVE: The goal of this project is to create a web-based platform that 
connects caregivers with personalized and easily accessible resources. This 
project involves industrial, academic, and community partners and focuses on two 
primary aims: (1) developing a digital platform using a Dementia Care 
Personalization Algorithm and assessing feasibility in a pilot group of 
caregivers, and (2) evaluating the acceptability and usability of the digital 
platform across different racial or ethnic populations. This work will aid in 
the development of technology-based interventions to reduce caregiver burden.
METHODS: The phase I study follows an iterative Design Thinking approach, 
involving at least 25 dementia caregivers as a user feedback panel to assess the 
platform's functionality, aesthetics, information, and overall quality using the 
adapted Mobile Application Rating Scale. Phase II is a usability study with 300 
dementia caregivers in Texas (100 African American, 100 Hispanic or Latinx, and 
100 non-Hispanic White). Participants will use the digital platform for about 4 
weeks and evaluate its usefulness and ease of use through the Technology 
Acceptance Survey.
RESULTS: The study received funding from the National Institute on Aging on 
September 3, 2021. Ethical approval for phase I was obtained from the Texas A&M 
University Institutional Review Board on December 8, 2021, with data collection 
starting on January 1, 2022, and concluding on May 31, 2022. Phase I results 
were published on September 5, 2023, and April 17, 2024, respectively. On June 
21, 2023, ethical approval for human subjects for phase II was granted, and 
participant recruitment began on July 1, 2023.
CONCLUSIONS: Upon completing these aims, we expect to deliver a widely 
accessible digital platform tailored to assist dementia caregivers with 
financial and legal challenges by connecting them to personalized, contextually 
relevant information and resources in Texas. If successful, we plan to work with 
caregiving organizations to scale and sustain the platform, addressing the needs 
of the growing population living with dementia.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: It is widely cited that dementia occurs in up to 80% 
of patients with Parkinson disease (PD), but studies reporting such high rates 
were published over two decades ago, had relatively small samples, and had other 
limitations. We aimed to determine long-term dementia risk in PD using data from 
two large, ongoing, prospective, observational studies.
METHODS: Participants from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative 
(PPMI), a multisite international study, and a long-standing PD research cohort 
at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn), a single site study at a tertiary 
movement disorders center, were recruited. PPMI enrolled de novo, untreated PD 
participants and Penn a convenience cohort from a large clinical center. For 
PPMI, a cognitive battery is administered annually, and a site investigator 
makes a cognitive diagnosis. At Penn, a comprehensive cognitive battery is 
administered either annually or biennially, and a cognitive diagnosis is made by 
expert consensus. Interval-censored survival curves were fit for time from PD 
diagnosis to stable dementia diagnosis for each cohort, using cognitive 
diagnosis of dementia as the primary end point and Montreal Cognitive Assessment 
(MoCA) score <21 and Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease 
Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part I cognition score ≥3 as secondary end points for 
PPMI. In addition, estimated dementia probability by PD disease duration was 
tabulated for each study and end point.
RESULTS: For the PPMI cohort, 417 participants with PD (mean age 61.6 years, 65% 
male) were followed, with an estimated probability of dementia at year 10 
disease duration of 9% (site investigator diagnosis), 15% (MoCA), or 12% 
(MDS-UPDRS Part I cognition). For the Penn cohort, 389 participants with PD 
(mean age 69.3 years, 67% male) were followed, with 184 participants (47% of 
cohort) eventually diagnosed with dementia. The interval-censored curve for the 
Penn cohort had a median time to dementia of 15 years (95% CI 13-15); the 
estimated probability of dementia was 27% at 10 years of disease duration, 50% 
at 15 years, and 74% at 20 years.
DISCUSSION: Results from two large, prospective studies suggest that dementia in 
PD occurs less frequently, or later in the disease course, than previous 
research studies have reported.

Episodic memory in older adults is varied and perceived to rely on numbers of 
synapses or dendritic spines. We analyzed 2157 neurons among 128 older 
individuals from the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project. 
Analysis of 55,521 individual dendritic spines by least absolute shrinkage and 
selection operator regression and nested model cross-validation revealed that 
the dendritic spine head diameter in the temporal cortex, but not the premotor 
cortex, improved the prediction of episodic memory performance in models 
containing β amyloid plaque scores, neurofibrillary tangle pathology, and sex. 
These findings support the emerging hypothesis that, in the temporal cortex, 
synapse strength is more critical than quantity for memory in old age.

Effective intracellular delivery of therapeutic proteins can potentially treat a 
wide array of diseases. However, efficient delivery of functional proteins 
across the cell membrane remains challenging. Exosomes are nanosized vesicles 
naturally secreted by various types of cells and may serve as promising 
nanocarriers for therapeutic biomolecules. Here, we engineered exosomes equipped 
with a photoinducible cargo protein release system, termed mMaple3-mediated 
protein loading into and release from exosome (MAPLEX), in which cargo proteins 
can be loaded into the exosomes by fusing them with photocleavable protein 
(mMaple3)-conjugated exosomal membrane markers and subsequently released from 
the exosomal membrane by inducing photocleavage with blue light illumination. 
Using this system, we first induced transcriptional regulation by delivering 
octamer-binding transcription factor 4 and SRY-box transcription factor 2 to 
fibroblasts in vitro. Second, we induced in vivo gene recombination in Cre 
reporter mice by delivering Cre recombinase. Last, we achieved targeted 
epigenome editing in the brains of 5xFAD and 3xTg-AD mice, two models of 
Alzheimer's disease. Administration of MAPLEXs loaded with β-site amyloid 
precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (Bace1)-targeting single guide 
RNA-incorporated dCas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes, coupled with the catalytic 
domain of DNA methyltransferase 3A, resulted in successful methylation of the 
targeted CpG sites within the Bace1 promoter. This approach led to a significant 
reduction in Bace1 expression, improved recognition memory impairment, and 
reduced amyloid pathology in 5xFAD and 3xTg-AD mice. These results suggest that 
MAPLEX is an efficient intracellular protein delivery system that can deliver 
diverse therapeutic proteins for multiple diseases.

OBJECTIVES: A low handgrip strength (HGS) is a significant risk factor for 
multiple diseases. However, most relevant studies investigate the complications 
of a low HGS, while the risk potential of causative factors of low HGS remain 
poorly characterized.
METHODS: We investigated the potentials of quality of life, depression, 
dyslipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, frailty, 
and difficulties performing daily activities in predicting low HGS (≤ 27 kg for 
men, ≤ 16 kg for women) in European older adults aged 50 or above from 15 
countries (n = 42,183). All data was collected from four successive waves of 
survey of health, ageing, and retirement in Europe (SHARE) conducted between 
2013 and 2020. Logistic models are applied, and estimated effects are presented 
as odds ratios and probabilities.
RESULTS: Collectively, 3016 participants (men; n = 1395; 7.38%, women; n = 1621, 
6.97%) developed low HGS during the 6.5 years study period. After adjusting for 
covariables, we identified an advancing age (1.6-48.1% points higher risk of low 
HGS), male gender (1.0%-point higher risk of low HGS), lower quality of life 
(1.6%-point higher), and stroke (1.5%-points) as significant risk factors for 
low HGS. We also found a dose-dependent association of Euro-D depression scores 
with the risk of low HGS, as the higher scores were associated with between 0.6- 
and 2.3%-points higher risk of developing low HGS than participants without 
depression. Among physical performance indicators, difficulty climbing stairs 
(2.0%-points higher low HGS risk) or rising from a chair (0.7%-points) were 
significantly associated with developing low HGS. Lastly, frailty (0.9%-points 
higher risk of low HGS) and the fear of falling down (1.6%-points higher risk) 
also increased the risk of developing low HGS.
CONCLUSION: Altogether, we report several risk factors for developing low HGS. 
Our observations may help evaluating and monitoring high-risk population for 
developing low HGS in pre-clinical settings.

Identifying and validating a biomarker with high specificity in early-stage 
dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) using a feasible method is crucial to enhance 
the current suboptimal diagnostic procedure. Previous research revealed 
abnormalities, including hypoperfusion in the right anterior insular cortex at 
group level, in prodromal DLB. Exploring hypoperfusion of the right anterior 
insula, at an individual-level and assessing its relevance as a potential 
imaging biomarker in early DLB, has, to our knowledge, not been investigated. 
Our preliminary study aims to assess the feasibility of the technique and to 
provide a methodological framework for further investigation. We assessed the 
feasibility and accuracy of the hypoperfusion of the right anterior insula per 
arterial spin labelling magnetic resonance imaging (ASL-MRI) as a diagnostic 
biomarker in early DLB and provided rough estimates of its sensitivity and 
specificity. Defining the region of interest based on previous research, we 
established the biomarker as the hypoperfusion of the right anterior insula. 
Discriminative and analytical performances were assessed in comparison to a 
control group of treatment-resistant depression patients. Bayesian diagnostic 
reasoning was employed to assess the biomarker diagnostic usability in early DLB 
in two scenarios: healthy elderly controls and mild cognitive impairment. 
Additionally, we updated probabilities by integrating data from the Mayo-clinic 
cognitive fluctuations scale and real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) 
α-synuclein data. Lastly, a whole-brain perfusion analysis of DLB patients was 
conducted to identify further brain regions with discriminative abilities. We 
successfully replicated the right anterior insular hypoperfusion (RAI-Hypo) in 
all DLB patients at the individual level. The overall sensitivity of the 
biomarker was 96%, and the specificity was 92%. Bayesian testing revealed the 
biomarker's highest performance in early-stage DLB with cognitive fluctuations, 
showcasing a diagnostic potential associated with a high precision and moderate 
accuracy. In a cognitively non-impaired population, the RAI-Hypo showed a 
limited usability and lacked in selectivity to qualify as a screening tool. The 
exploratory whole-brain analysis revealed perfect discriminative capacities in 
the bilateral anterior insulae and the left inferior parietal lobule. Further 
studies are needed to confirm our preliminary results. If performance is 
maintained in subsequent studies and is compared to a more suitable control 
population, the proposed biomarker may be eventually sufficient to discriminate 
early-stage DLB from non-DLB.

Amyloid-beta aggregation is considered one of the factors influencing the onset 
of the Alzheimer's disease. Early prevention of such aggregation should 
alleviate disease condition by applying small molecule compounds that shift the 
aggregation equilibrium toward the soluble form of the peptide or slow down the 
process. We have discovered that fluorinated benzenesulfonamides of particular 
structure slowed the amyloid-beta peptide aggregation process by more than 
three-fold. We synthesized a series of ortho-para and meta-para 
double-substituted fluorinated benzenesulfonamides that inhibited the 
aggregation process to a variable extent yielding a detailed picture of the 
structure-activity relationship. Analysis of compound chemical structure effect 
on aggregation in artificial cerebrospinal fluid showed the necessity to arrange 
the benzenesulfonamide, hydrophobic substituent, and benzoic acid in a 
particular way. The amyloid beta peptide aggregate fibril structures varied in 
cross-sectional height depending on the applied inhibitor indicating the 
formation of a complex with the compound. Application of selected inhibitors 
increased the survivability of cells affected by the amyloid beta peptide. Such 
compounds may be developed as drugs against Alzheimer's disease.

Recent advancements in Alzheimer's disease treatment have focused on the 
elimination of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaque, a hallmark of the disease. Monoclonal 
antibodies such as lecanemab and donanemab can alter disease progression by 
binding to different forms of Aβ aggregates. However, these treatments raise 
concerns about adverse effects, particularly amyloid-related imaging 
abnormalities (ARIA). Careful assessment of safety, especially regarding ARIA, 
is crucial. ARIA results from treatment-related disruption of vascular integrity 
and increased vascular permeability, leading to the leakage of proteinaceous 
fluid (ARIA-E) and heme products (ARIA-H). ARIA-E indicates treatment-induced 
edema or sulcal effusion, while ARIA-H indicates treatment-induced 
microhemorrhage or superficial siderosis. The minimum recommended magnetic 
resonance imaging sequences for ARIA assessment are T2-FLAIR, T2* gradient echo 
(GRE), and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). T2-FLAIR and T2* GRE are necessary 
to detect ARIA-E and ARIA-H, respectively. DWI plays a role in differentiating 
ARIA-E from acute to subacute infarcts. Physicians, including radiologists, must 
be familiar with the imaging features of ARIA, the appropriate imaging protocol 
for the ARIA workup, and the reporting of findings in clinical practice. This 
review aims to describe the clinical and imaging features of ARIA and suggest 
points for the timely detection and monitoring of ARIA in clinical practice.

Inhibiting O-GlcNAcase and thereby up-regulation of the O-GlcNAc levels of tau 
was a potential approach for discovering AD treatments. Herein, a series of 
novel highly potent OGA inhibitors embracing a 4-(arylethynyl)piperidine moiety 
was achieved by capitalizing on the substrate recognition domain. Extensive 
structure-activity relationships resulted in compound 81 with significant 
enzymatic inhibition (IC50 = 4.93 ± 2.05 nM) and cellular potency (EC50 = 7.47 ± 
3.96 nM in PC12 cells). It markedly increased the protein O-GlcNAcylation levels 
and reduced the phosphorylation on Ser199, Thr205, and Ser396 of tau in the 
OA-injured SH-SY5Y cell model, suggesting its potential role for AD treatment. 
In fact, an in vivo efficacy of ameliorating cognitive impairment was observed 
following treatment of APP/PS1 mice with compound 81 (100 mg/kg). Additionally, 
the appropriate plasma PK and beneficial BBB penetration properties were also 
observed. Compound 81 deserves to be further explored as an anti-AD agent.

Photoreceptor death causes blinding inheritable retinal diseases, such as 
retinitis pigmentosa (RP). As disease progression often outpaces therapeutic 
advances, finding effective treatments is urgent. This study focuses on 
developing a targeted approach by evaluating the efficacy of small peptides 
derived from pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), known to restrict common 
cell death pathways associated with retinal diseases. Peptides with affinity for 
the PEDF receptor, PEDF-R, (17-mer and H105A) delivered via eye drops reached 
the retina, efficiently promoted photoreceptor survival, and improved retinal 
function in RP mouse models based on both the rd10 mutation and the rhodopsin 
P23H mutation. Additionally, intravitreal delivery of AAV-H105A vectors delayed 
photoreceptor degeneration in the latter RP mouse model. Furthermore, peptide 
H105A specifically prevented photoreceptor death induced by oxidative stress, a 
contributing factor to RP progression, in human retinal organoids. This 
promising approach for peptide eye drop delivery holds significant potential as 
a therapeutic for preventing photoreceptor death in retinal disorders, offering 
a high safety profile, low invasiveness and multiple delivery options.

Introduction: Chemicals, such as MNU (N-methyl-N-nitrosourea) and NaIO3 (sodium 
iodate), are widely used to induce retinal degeneration in rodents. 
Streptozotocin (STZ) is an analog of N-acetyl glucosamine in which an MNU moiety 
is linked to a hexose and has a special toxic effect on insulin-producing 
pancreatic β-cells. It is commonly used to induce hyperglycemia to model 
diabetes. While intracerebroventricular injection of STZ can produce Alzheimer's 
disease independent of hyperglycemia, most retinal studies using STZ focus on 
the effects of hyperglycemia on the retina, but whether STZ has any impact on 
retinal cells independent of hyperglycemia is unknown. We aimed to investigate 
the role of cytotoxicity of STZ in rat retina. Methods: Intravitreal or 
subcutaneous injection of STZ was performed on newborn rats. Electroretinogram 
(ERG) and H&E staining investigated retinal function and morphological changes. 
Retinal cell types, cell death, proliferation, inflammation, and angiogenesis 
were studied by immunostaining. RNA sequencing was performed to examine the 
transcriptome changes of retinal cells after intravitreal injection of STZ. 
Results: Intravitreal (5 μg or 10 μg) or subcutaneous (30 mg/kg) injection of 
STZ at the early stage of newborn rats couldn't induce hyperglycemia but caused 
NSIR (Neonatal STZ-induced retinopathy), including reduced ERG amplitudes, 
retinal rosettes and apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, microglial activation, and 
delayed retinal angiogenesis. STZ did not affect the early-born retinal cell 
types but significantly reduced the late-born ones. Short-term and long-term 
hyperglycemia had no significant effects on the NSIR phenotypes. RNA sequencing 
revealed that STZ induces oxidative stress and activates the p53 pathway of 
retinal cells. Locally or systemically, STZ injection after P8 couldn't induce 
SINR when all retinal progenitors exit the cell cycle. Conclusion: NSIR in rats 
is independent of hyperglycemia but due to STZ's direct cytotoxic effects on 
retinal progenitor cells. NSIR is a typical reaction to STZ-induced retinal 
oxidative stress and DNA damage. This significant finding suggests that NSIR may 
be a valuable model for studying retinal progenitor DNA damage-related diseases, 
potentially leading to new insights and treatments.

INTRODUCTION: The Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) quantifies the 
frequency of agitation behaviors in elderly persons. This post hoc analysis of 
data from the brexpiprazole clinical program aimed to determine a meaningful 
within-patient change (MWPC) threshold for CMAI Total score among patients with 
agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease.
METHODS: Data were included from three 12-week, multicenter, randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm trials of brexpiprazole for the 
treatment of agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease 
(ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT01862640, NCT01922258, NCT03548584). Change 
in CMAI Total score (range 29-203; higher scores indicate higher frequency of 
agitation behaviors) from baseline to Week 12 was the primary endpoint in each 
trial. MWPC thresholds were estimated from anchor-based mean change analyses and 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The Clinical Global 
Impression-Severity of illness (CGI-S) and Clinical Global 
Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) scales, both as related to agitation, were used 
as anchors. Empirical cumulative distribution functions (eCDFs) and probability 
density functions (PDFs) were plotted as supportive evidence. Distribution-based 
methods were also employed.
RESULTS: Data from 898 patients were analyzed (mean age, 73.7 years; mean 
baseline CMAI Total score, 73.8). The mean CMAI Total score change corresponding 
to a difference of small improvement vs. stable (CGI-S one-point decrease vs. no 
change), or minimally improved vs. no change (CGI-I rating of 3 vs. 4), ranged 
from -10.6 to -13.5 points. The mean CMAI Total score change corresponding to a 
difference of moderate improvement vs. stable (CGI-S two-point decrease vs. no 
change), or much improved vs. no change (CGI-I rating of 2 vs. 4), ranged from 
-20.2 to -25.7 points. ROC curve analyses generally produced smaller estimates 
of meaningful change. eCDFs and PDFs showed good distribution and separation of 
CMAI Total score change between CGI-S/CGI-I categories. In distribution-based 
analyses, the minimal detectable change for CMAI Total score (10.5-11.8 points) 
was generally lower than anchor-suggested thresholds.
CONCLUSION: Triangulation of evidence from anchor- and distribution-based 
analyses supports an MWPC threshold for CMAI Total score of -20 points, with a 
threshold range of -15 to -25 points, in patients with agitation associated with 
dementia due to Alzheimer's disease.

INTRODUCTION: For many patients and caregivers, a major goal of 
disease-modifying treatments (DMT) for Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia is to 
extend independence in instrumental and basic activities of daily living (IADLs 
and BADLs). The goal of this study was to estimate the effect of treatments on 
the time remaining independent in IADLs and BADLs.
METHODS: Participants at the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center were 
selected who were potentially eligible for recent DMT trials: age ≥ 60 years at 
baseline, clinical diagnosis of very mild or mild AD dementia (global Clinical 
Dementia Rating® (CDR®) score 0.5 or 1), biomarker confirmation of amyloid 
pathology, and at least one follow-up CDR assessment within 5 years. For IADLs, 
a subset of the Functional Assessment Questionnaire (FAQ) was examined that 
rated the degree of independence in the following: paying bills, driving, 
remembering medications and appointments, and preparing meals. For BADLs, the 
Personal Care domain of the CDR was used. Mixed-effects logistic and ordinal 
regression models were used to examine the relationship between CDR Sum Boxes 
(CDR-SB) and the individual functional outcomes and their components. The change 
in CDR-SB over time was estimated with linear mixed effects models.
RESULTS: 282 participants were followed for an average of 2.9 years (SD 1.3 
years). For 50% of individuals, loss of independence in IADLs occurred at 
CDR-SB>4.5 and in BADLs at CDR-SB>11.5. For individuals with a baseline 
CDR-SB=2, treatment with lecanemab would extend independence in IADLs for 10 
months (95% CI 4-18 months) and treatment with donanemab in the low/medium tau 
group would extend independence in IADLs by 13 months (95% CI 6-24 months).
DISCUSSION: Independence in ADLs can be related to CDR-SB and used to 
demonstrate the effect of AD treatments in extending the time of independent 
function, a meaningful outcome for patients and their families.

INTRODUCTION: Biomarkers have been essential to understanding Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) pathogenesis, pathophysiology, progression, and treatment effects. 
However, each biomarker measure is a representation of the biological target, 
the assay used to measure it, and the variance of the assay. Thus, biomarker 
measures are difficult to compare without standardization, and the units and 
magnitude of effect relative to the disease are difficult to appreciate, even 
for experts. To facilitate quantitative comparisons of AD biomarkers in the 
context of biologic and treatment effects, we propose a biomarker 
standardization approach between normal ranges and maximum abnormal AD ranges, 
which we refer to as CentiMarker, similar to the Centiloid approach used in PET.
METHODS: We developed a standardization scale that creates percentile values 
ranging from 0 for a normal population to 100 for the most abnormal measures 
across disease stages. We applied this scale to CSF and plasma biomarkers in 
autosomal dominant AD, assessing the distribution by estimated years from 
symptom onset, between biomarkers, and across cohorts. We then validated this 
approach in a large national sporadic AD cohort.
RESULTS: We found the CentiMarker scale provided an easily interpretable metric 
of disease abnormality. The biologic changes, range, and distribution of several 
AD fluid biomarkers including amyloid-β, phospho-tau and other biomarkers, were 
comparable across disease stages in both early onset autosomal dominant and 
sporadic late onset AD.
DISCUSSION: The CentiMarker scale offers a robust and versatile framework for 
the standardized biological comparison of AD biomarkers. Its broader adoption 
could facilitate biomarker reporting, allowing for more informed cross-study 
comparisons and contributing to accelerated therapeutic development.

BACKGROUND: Among LRRK2-associated parkinsonism cases with nigral degeneration, 
over two-thirds demonstrate evidence of pathologic alpha-synuclein, but many do 
not. Understanding the clinical phenotype and underlying biology in such 
individuals is critical for therapeutic development. Our objective was to 
compare clinical and biomarker features, and rate of progression over 4 years 
follow-up, among LRRK2-associated parkinsonism cases with and without in vivo 
evidence of alpha-synuclein aggregates.
METHODS: Data were from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative, a 
multicenter prospective cohort study. The sample included individuals diagnosed 
with Parkinson disease with pathogenic variants in LRRK2. Presence of CSF 
alpha-synuclein aggregation was assessed with seed amplification assay. A range 
of clinician- and patient- reported outcome assessments were administered. 
Biomarkers included dopamine transporter SPECT scan, CSF amyloid-beta1-42, total 
tau, phospho-tau181, urine bis(monoacylglycerol)phosphate levels, and serum 
neurofilament light chain. Linear mixed effects models examined differences in 
trajectory in CSF negative and positive groups.
RESULTS: 148 LRRK2-parkinsonism cases (86% with G2019S variant), 46 negative and 
102 positive for CSF alpha-synuclein seed amplification assay were included. At 
baseline, the negative group were older than the positive group (median 
[interquartile range] 69.1 [65.2-72.3] vs 61.5 [55.6-66.9] years, p<0.001) and a 
greater proportion were female (28 (61%) vs 43 (42%), p=0.035). Despite being 
older, the negative group had similar duration since diagnosis, and similar 
motor rating scale (16 [11-23] vs 16 [10-22], p=0.480) though lower levodopa 
equivalents. Only 13 (29%) of the negative group were hyposmic, compared to 75 
(77%) of the positive group. Lowest putamen dopamine transporter binding 
expected for age and sex was greater in the negative vs positive groups (0.36 
[0.29-0.45] vs 0.26 [0.22-0.37], p<0.001). Serum neurofilament light chain was 
higher in the negative group compared to the positive group (17.10 [13.60-22.10] 
vs 10.50 [8.43-14.70]; age-adjusted p-value=0.013). In terms of longitudinal 
change, the negative group remained stable in functional rating scale score in 
contrast to the positive group who had a significant increase (worsening) of 
0.729 per year (p=0.037), but no other differences in trajectory were found.
CONCLUSION: Among individuals diagnosed with Parkinson disease with pathogenic 
variants in the LRRK2 gene, we found clinical and biomarker differences in cases 
without versus with in vivo evidence of CSF alpha-synuclein aggregates. LRRK2 
parkinsonism cases without evidence of alpha-synuclein aggregates as a group 
exhibit less severe motor manifestations and decline may have more significant 
cognitive dysfunction. The underlying biology in LRRK2-parkinsonism cases 
without evidence of alpha-synuclein aggregates requires further investigation.

BACKGROUND: Mutations within the genes PRKN and PINK1 are the leading cause of 
early onset autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the genetic 
cause of most early-onset PD (EOPD) cases still remains unresolved. Long-read 
sequencing has successfully identified many pathogenic structural variants that 
cause disease, but this technology has not been widely applied to PD. We 
recently identified the genetic cause of EOPD in a pair of monozygotic twins by 
uncovering a complex structural variant that spans over 7 Mb, utilizing Oxford 
Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long-read sequencing. In this study, we aimed to 
expand on this and assess whether a second variant could be detected with ONT 
long-read sequencing in other unresolved EOPD cases reported to carry one 
heterozygous variant in PRKN or PINK1.
METHODS: ONT long-read sequencing was performed on patients with one reported 
PRKN/PINK1 pathogenic variant. EOPD patients with an age at onset younger than 
50 were included in this study. As a positive control, we also included EOPD 
patients who had already been identified to carry two known PRKN pathogenic 
variants. Initial genetic testing was performed using either short-read targeted 
panel sequencing for single nucleotide variants and multiplex ligation-dependent 
probe amplification (MLPA) for copy number variants.
RESULTS: 48 patients were included in this study (PRKN "one-variant" n = 24, 
PINK1 "one-variant" n = 12, PRKN "two-variants" n = 12). Using ONT long-read 
sequencing, we detected a second pathogenic variant in six PRKN "one-variant" 
patients (26%, 6/23) but none in the PINK1 "one-variant" patients (0%, 0/12). 
Long-read sequencing identified one case with a complex inversion, two instances 
of structural variant overlap, and three cases of duplication. In addition, in 
the positive control PRKN "two-variants" group, we were able to identify both 
pathogenic variants in PRKN in all the patients (100%, 12/12).
CONCLUSIONS: This data highlights that ONT long-read sequencing is a powerful 
tool to identify a pathogenic structural variant at the PRKN locus that is often 
missed by conventional methods. Therefore, for cases where conventional methods 
fail to detect a second variant for EOPD, long-read sequencing should be 
considered as an alternative and complementary approach.

INTRODUCTION: We investigated how cerebrospinal fluid levels of synaptic 
proteins associate with memory function in normal cognition (CN) and mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI), and investigated the effect of amyloid positivity on 
these associations.
METHODS: We included 242 CN (105(43%) abnormal amyloid), and 278 MCI individuals 
(183(66%) abnormal amyloid) from EMIF-AD MBD and ADNI. For 181 (EMIF-AD MBD) and 
36 (ADNI) proteins with a synaptic annotation in SynGO, associations with word 
learning recall were analysed with linear models.
RESULTS: Subsets of synaptic proteins showed lower levels with worse recall in 
preclinical AD (EMIF-AD MBD: 7, ADNI: 5 proteins, none overlapping), prodromal 
AD (EMIF-AD MBD only, 27 proteins) and non-AD MCI (EMIF-AD MBD: 1, ADNI: 7 
proteins). The majority of these associations were specific to these groups.
DISCUSSION: Synaptic disturbance-related memory impairment occurred very early 
in AD, indicating it may be relevant to develop therapies targeting the synapse 
early in the disease.

Update in
    Alzheimers Dement. 2025 May;21(5):e70243. doi: 10.1002/alz.70243.

This study explored the role of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) in 
dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease (DIAD) by examining changes in 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of UPS proteins along with disease progression, 
AD imaging biomarkers (PiB PET, tau PET), neurodegeneration imaging measures 
(MRI, FDG PET), and Clinical Dementia Rating® (CDR®). Using the SOMAscan assay, 
we detected subtle increases in specific ubiquitin enzymes associated with 
proteostasis in mutation carriers (MCs) up to two decades before the estimated 
symptom onset. This was followed by more pronounced elevations of UPS-activating 
enzymes, including E2 and E3 proteins, and ubiquitin-related modifiers. Our 
findings also demonstrated consistent correlations between UPS proteins and CSF 
biomarkers such as Aβ42/40 ratio, total tau, various phosphorylated tau species 
to total tau ratios (ptau181/T181, ptauT205/T205, ptauS202/S202, ptauT217/T217), 
and MTBR-tau243, alongside Neurofilament light chain (NfL) and the CDR®. 
Notably, a positive association was observed with imaging markers (PiB PET, tau 
PET) and a negative correlation with markers of neurodegeneration (FDG PET, 
MRI), highlighting a significant link between UPS dysregulation and 
neurodegenerative processes. The correlations suggest that the increase in 
multiple UPS proteins with rising tau levels and tau-tangle associated markers, 
indicating a potential role for the UPS in relation to misfolded 
tau/neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and symptom onset. These findings indicate 
that elevated CSF UPS proteins in DIAD MCs could serve as early indicators of 
disease progression and suggest a link between UPS dysregulation and amyloid 
plaque, tau tangles formation, implicating the UPS as a potential therapeutic 
target in AD pathogenesis.

BACKGROUND: We aimed to investigate the association between OA and treatment 
with dementia risk and structural brain abnormalities.
METHODS: We recruited a total of 466,460 individuals from the UK Biobank to 
investigate the impact of OA on the incidence of dementia. Among the total 
population, there were 63,081 participants diagnosed with OA. We subsequently 
categorised the OA patients into medication and surgery groups based on 
treatment routes. Cox regression models explored the associations between OA/OA 
treatment and dementia risk, with the results represented as hazard ratios (HRs) 
and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Linear regression models assessed the 
associations of OA/OA therapy with alterations in cortical structure.
RESULTS: During an average of 11.90 (± 1.01) years of follow-up, 5,627 
individuals were diagnosed with all-cause dementia (ACD), including 2,438 AD 
(Alzheimer's disease), and 1,312 VaD (vascular dementia) cases. Results revealed 
that OA was associated with the elevated risk of ACD (HR: 1.116; 95% CI: 
1.039-1.199) and AD (HR: 1.127; 95% CI: 1.013-1.254). OA therapy lowered the 
risk of dementia in both medication group (HR: 0.746; 95% CI: 0.652-0.854) and 
surgery group (HR: 0.841; 95% CI: 0.736-0.960). OA was negatively associated 
with cortical area, especially precentral, postcentral and temporal regions.
CONCLUSIONS: Osteoarthritis increased the likelihood of developing dementia, and 
had an association with regional brain atrophy. OA treatment lowered the 
dementia risk. OA is a promising modifiable risk factor for dementia.

Studying the effect of duration of treatment on prognostic outcomes using 
real-world data is challenging because only people who survive for a long time 
can receive a treatment for a long time. Specifying a target trial helps 
overcome such challenge. We aimed to estimate the effect of different durations 
of treatment with antihypertensive drugs with anticholinergic properties (AC 
AHT) on the risk of vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease by emulating a 
target trial using the UK CPRD GOLD database (2001-2017). Comparing treatment 
for 3-6 years vs ≤3 years yielded null results for both types of dementia. 
Comparing a longer duration of treatment, >6 years vs ≤3 years, yielded a 
10-year risk ratio of 0.69 (95% CI, 0.54-0.90) for vascular dementia and 0.91 
(95% CI, 0.77-1.10) for Alzheimer's disease. For illustration, we performed an 
analysis that failed to emulate a target trial by assigning exposure categories 
using postbaseline information, obtaining implausible beneficial estimates. Our 
findings indicate a modest benefit of longer duration of treatment with AC AHT 
on vascular dementia and highlight the value of the target trial emulation to 
avoid selection bias in the evaluation of the effect of different durations of 
treatment. This article is part of a Special Collection on Pharmacoepidemiology.

This study examines pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic salts of memantine, 
specifically focusing on hydrogen sulfate, sulfate, and dihydrogen phosphate 
salts, with the aim of finding alternatives to the commonly used chloride salt 
in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Through comprehensive solid-state 
characterization, including powder X-ray diffraction, thermal analysis, and 
solubility testing, we unveil complex polymorphic behaviors, reversible 
solid-state transitions, and significant differences in solubility and stability 
among the salts. Notably, the hydrogen sulfate salt emerges as a promising 
candidate for drug formulations, offering improved solubility, nonhygroscopic 
nature, and favorable morphological characteristics compared to the existing 
chloride salt. This work establishes a foundation for further investigation into 
memantine salts as potential therapeutics with improved efficacy.

Neurological disorders, characterized by oxidative stress (OS) and inflammation, 
have become a major global health concern. Redox reactions play a vital role in 
regulating the balance of the neuronal microenvironment. Specifically, the 
imbalance leads to a significant weakening of the organism's natural defensive 
mechanisms. This, in turn, causes the development of harmful oxidative stress, 
which plays a crucial role in the onset and progression of neurodegenerative 
diseases. The quest for effective therapeutic agents has led to significant 
advancements in the synthesis of antioxidant derivatives. This review provides a 
comprehensive overview of the recent developments in the use of novel 
antioxidant compounds with potential pharmacological applications in the 
management of neurological disorders. The discussed compounds encompass a 
diverse range of chemical structures, including polyphenols, vitamins, 
flavonoids, and hybrid molecules, highlighting their varied mechanisms of 
action. This review also focuses on the mechanism of oxidative stress in 
developing neurodegenerative disease. The neuroprotective effects of these 
antioxidant derivatives are explored in the context of specific neurological 
disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's 
disease. The ultimate goal is to provide effective treatments for these 
debilitating conditions and improve the quality of life for patients.

We investigate the mechanism of action of astragalin (AST) in the treatment of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Network pharmacology was conducted to analyze the 
relationships among AST, AD, and neuroinflammation, The APP/PS1 transgenic mice 
with AD were used in the experiments; to be specific, the influence of AST on 
the behavior of mice was analyzed by Morris water maze and eight-arm radial maze 
tests, the tissue inflammatory factor levels were detected by ELISA, and 
pathological changes were analyzed by H&E and immunohistochemical staining. 
Analysis results of network pharmacology suggested that AST exerted the 
multi-target effect on neuroinflammation in AD. Through molecular docking and 
dynamics analyses, COX2 might be the target of AST. Moreover, animal 
experimental results demonstrated that AST improved the behavior of AD mice, and 
enhanced the motor and memory abilities, meanwhile, it suppressed the expression 
of inflammatory factors in tissues and the activation of microglial cells. this 
study discovers that AST can suppress microglial cell activation via COX2 to 
improve neuroinflammation in AD.

BACKGROUND: Physical activity can improve cognition; however, little is known 
regarding the relationships between longitudinal objectively measured physical 
activity, cognition, and inflammation in older breast cancer survivors.
METHODS: Older (aged 60 years and older) breast cancer survivors (n = 216) and 
frequency-matched noncancer control participants (n = 216) were assessed at 
baseline (presystemic therapy for survivors) and annually for up to 5 years. 
Assessments included hip-worn actigraphs worn for 7 days, neuropsychological 
tests, the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive Function perceived 
cognitive impairment subscale, and circulating levels of C-reactive protein and 
interleukin-6. Data were analyzed using linear mixed-effect, random-effect 
contemporaneous fluctuation, and multilevel mediation models, considering 
covariates; a P value less than .05 (2-sided) was considered statistically 
significant.
RESULTS: Survivors had fewer minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity 
than controls at 36-, 48-, and 60-month time points (P < .03). Fewer survivors 
met aerobic physical activity guidelines at 36 months than control participants 
(17.7% vs 33.0%, P = .030). When guidelines were met (vs not), Functional 
Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive Function perceived cognitive impairment 
scores were 2.1 (1.0) (P = .034) points higher. Higher moderate-to-vigorous 
physical activity and meeting aerobic guidelines were not related to objective 
neuropsychological performance. Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was 
inversely associated with C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 (P < .001), but 
inflammation did not mediate physical activity effects on perceived cognition.
CONCLUSIONS: Older breast cancer survivors were less physically active than 
older noncancer controls, especially farther from baseline. Meeting aerobic 
guidelines was associated with better perceived cognition in survivors. 
Survivorship care should consider physical activity monitoring and referral to 
rehabilitation and supervised exercise programs to promote physical activity and 
improve recovery in older survivors.

The deposition of abnormal tau protein is characteristic of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) and a class of neurodegenerative diseases called tauopathies. 
Physiologically, tau maintains an intrinsically disordered structure and plays 
diverse roles in neurons. Pathologically, tau undergoes abnormal 
post-translational modifications and forms oligomers or fibrous aggregates in 
tauopathies. In this review, we briefly introduce several tauopathies and 
discuss the mechanisms mediating tau aggregation and propagation. We also 
describe the toxicity of tau pathology. Finally, we explore the early diagnostic 
biomarkers and treatments targeting tau. Although some encouraging results have 
been achieved in animal experiments and preclinical studies, there is still no 
cure for tauopathies. More in-depth basic and clinical research on the 
pathogenesis of tauopathies is necessary.

Multinucleated microglia have been observed in contexts associated with 
infection, inflammation, and aging. Though commonly linked to pathological 
conditions, the larger cell size of multinucleated microglia might enhance their 
phagocytic functions, potentially aiding in the clearance of brain debris and 
suggesting a reassessment of their pathological significance. To assess the 
phagocytic capacity of multinucleated microglia and its implications for brain 
debris clearance, we induced their formation by inhibiting Pyk2 activity using 
the pharmacological inhibitor PF-431396, which triggers cytokinesis regression. 
Multinucleated microglia demonstrate enhanced phagocytic function, as evidenced 
by their increased capacity to engulf β-amyloid (Aβ) oligomers. Concurrently, 
the phosphorylation of Pyk2, induced by Aβ peptide, was diminished upon 
treatment with a Pyk2 inhibitor (Pyk2-Inh, PF-431396). Furthermore, the 
increased expression of Lamp1, a lysosomal marker, with Pyk2-inh treatment, 
suggests an enhancement in proteolytic activity. In vivo, we generated an acute 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) model by infusing Aβ into the brains of Iba-1 EGFP 
transgenic (Tg) mice. The administration of the Pyk2-Inh led to an increased 
migration of microglia toward amyloid deposits in the brains of Iba-1 EGFP Tg 
mice, accompanied by morphological activation, suggesting a heightened affinity 
for Aβ. In human microglia, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory 
responses showed that inhibition of Pyk2 signaling significantly reduced the 
transcription and protein expression of pro-inflammatory markers. These results 
suggest that Pyk2 inhibition can modulate microglial functions, potentially 
reducing neuroinflammation and aiding in the clearance of neurodegenerative 
disease markers. This highlights Pyk2 as a promising target for therapeutic 
intervention in neurodegenerative diseases.

Lewy body dementia (LBD), a class of disorders comprising Parkinson's disease 
dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), features substantial 
clinical and pathological overlap with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The 
identification of biomarkers unique to LBD pathophysiology could meaningfully 
advance its diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment. Using quantitative mass 
spectrometry (MS), we measured over 9,000 proteins across 138 dorsolateral 
prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) tissues from a University of Pennsylvania autopsy 
collection comprising control, Parkinson's disease (PD), PDD, and DLB diagnoses. 
We then analyzed co-expression network protein alterations in those with LBD, 
validated these disease signatures in two independent LBD datasets, and compared 
these findings to those observed in network analyses of AD cases. The LBD 
network revealed numerous groups or "modules" of co-expressed proteins 
significantly altered in PDD and DLB, representing synaptic, metabolic, and 
inflammatory pathophysiology. A comparison of validated LBD signatures to those 
of AD identified distinct differences between the two diseases. Notably, 
synuclein-associated presynaptic modules were elevated in LBD but decreased in 
AD relative to controls. We also found that glial-associated matrisome 
signatures consistently elevated in AD were more variably altered in LBD, 
ultimately stratifying those LBD cases with low versus high burdens of 
concurrent beta-amyloid deposition. In conclusion, unbiased network proteomic 
analysis revealed diverse pathophysiological changes in the LBD frontal cortex 
distinct from alterations in AD. These results highlight the LBD brain network 
proteome as a promising source of biomarkers that could enhance clinical 
recognition and management.
