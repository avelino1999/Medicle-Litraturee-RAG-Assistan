Microglial polarization and ferroptosis are important pathological features in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Ghrelin, a brain-gut hormone, has potential 
neuroprotective effects in AD. This study aimed to explore the potential 
mechanisms by which ghrelin regulates the progression of AD, as well as the 
crosstalk between microglial polarization and ferroptosis. Mouse BV2 microglial 
cells and male mice were treated with beta-amyloid (Aβ) (1-42) to simulate the 
AD environment. Microglia ferroptosis was measured by detecting levels of 
ferroptosis-related proteins (SLC7A11, GPX4, FTL1, and FTH1), metabolic markers 
(ROS, MDA, GSH, SOD), and observing mitochondrial morphological changes. 
Microglial polarization was evaluated by measuring levels of inflammatory 
markers and surface markers. The impact of ghrelin on Aβ1-42-exposed microglia 
was assessed by coupling with the ferroptosis activator Erastin. Cognitive 
impairment in AD mice was evaluated through behavioral tests. Tissue staining 
was applied to determine neuronal damage. In Aβ1-42-exposed microglia, ghrelin 
upregulated the protein expression of SLC7A11, GPX4, FTL1 and FTH1, reduced ROS 
and MDA levels, and elevated GSH and SOD levels through the BMP6/SMAD1 pathway. 
Ghrelin alleviated mitochondrial structural damage. Additionally, ghrelin 
reduced levels of pro-inflammatory factors and CD86, while increasing levels of 
anti-inflammatory factors and CD206. Erastin reversed the effects of ghrelin on 
ferroptosis and phenotypic polarization in Aβ1-42-exposed microglia. In AD mice, 
ghrelin ameliorated abnormal behavior, neuroinflammation, and plaque deposition. 
Ghrelin attenuated iNOS/IBA1-positive expression and enhanced 
Arg-1/IBA1-positive expression in the hippocampus. Ghrelin induces microglial M2 
polarization by inhibiting microglia ferroptosis, thereby alleviating 
neuroinflammation. Our results indicate that ghrelin may serve as a promising 
potential agent for treating cognitive impairment in AD.

Phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors have shown great potential in treating 
Alzheimer's disease by improving memory and cognitive function. In this study, 
we evaluated fluspirilene, a drug commonly used to treat schizophrenia, as a 
potential PDE5 inhibitor using computational methods. Molecular docking revealed 
that fluspirilene binds strongly to PDE5, supported by hydrophobic and aromatic 
interactions. Molecular dynamics simulations confirmed that the 
fluspirilene-PDE5 complex is stable and maintains its structural integrity over 
time. Binding energy calculations further highlighted favorable interactions, 
indicating that the drug forms a strong and stable bond with PDE5. Additional 
analyses, including studies of protein dynamics and energy landscape mapping, 
revealed how the drug interacts dynamically with PDE5, adapting to different 
conformations and maintaining stability. These findings suggest that 
fluspirilene may modulate PDE5 activity, potentially offering therapeutic 
benefits for Alzheimer's disease. This study provides strong evidence for 
repurposing fluspirilene as a treatment for Alzheimer's and lays the foundation 
for further experimental and clinical investigations.

The inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), an enzyme responsible for the 
inactivation and decrease in acetylcholine in the cholinergic pathway, has been 
considered an attractive target for small-molecule drug discovery in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) therapy. In the present study, a series of TZD derivatives were 
designed, synthesized, and studied for drug likeness, blood-brain barrier (BBB) 
permeability, and adsorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity 
(ADMET). Additionally, docking studies of the designed compounds were performed 
on AChE. Additionally, all the TZD derivatives (CHT1-5) showed an acceptable 
affinity for AChE inhibition, and the results showed convincing binding modes in 
the active site of AChE. Among them, 5-(4-methoxybenzylidene) 
thiazolidine-2,4-dione (CHT1) was identified as the most potent AChE inhibitor 
(IC50 of 165.93 nM) with the highest antioxidant activity. Following the 
exposure of PC12 cells to Aβ1-42 (100 μM), a marked reduction in cell survival 
was observed. Pretreatment of PC12 cells with TZD derivatives had a 
neuroprotective effect and significantly enhanced cell survival in response to 
Aβ-induced toxicity. Western blotting analysis revealed that CHT1 (5 and 8 μM) 
downregulated p-Tau and HSP70 expression levels. The results indicate that CHT1 
is a promising and effective AchE-I that could be utilized as a powerful 
candidate against AD.

BACKGROUND: A neuroinflammatory disease such as Alzheimer's disease, presents a 
significant challenge in neurotherapeutics, particularly due to the complex 
etiology and allostatic factors, referred to as CNS stressors, that accelerate 
the development and progression of the disease. These CNS stressors include 
cerebral hypo-glucose metabolism, hyperinsulinemia, mitochondrial dysfunction, 
oxidative stress, impairment of neuronal autophagy, hypoxic insults and 
neuroinflammation. This study aims to explore the efficacy and safety of 
DAG-MAG-ΒHB, a novel ketone diester, in mitigating these risk factors by 
sustaining therapeutic ketosis, independent of conventional metabolic pathways.
METHODS: We evaluated the intestinal absorption of DAG-MAG-ΒHB and the metabolic 
impact in human microglial cells. Utilizing the HMC3 human microglia cell line, 
we examined the compound's effect on cellular viability, Acetyl-CoA and ATP 
levels, and key metabolic enzymes under hypoglycemia. Additionally, we assessed 
the impact of DAG-AG-ΒHB on inflammasome activation, mitochondrial activity, ROS 
levels, inflammation and phagocytic rates.
RESULTS: DAG-MAG-ΒHB showed a high rate of intestinal absorption and no 
cytotoxic effect. In vitro, DAG-MAG-ΒHB enhanced cell viability, preserved 
morphological integrity, and maintained elevated Acetyl-CoA and ATP levels under 
hypoglycemic conditions. DAG-MAG-ΒHB increased the activity of BDH1 and SCOT, 
indicating ATP production via a ketolytic pathway. DAG-MAG-ΒHB showed remarkable 
resilience against low glucose condition by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome 
activation.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, DAG-MAG-ΒHB emerges as a promising treatment for 
neuroinflammatory conditions. It enhances cellular health under varying 
metabolic states and exhibits neuroprotective properties against low glucose 
conditions. These attributes indicate its potential as an effective component in 
managing neuroinflammatory diseases, addressing their complex progression.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) prevention is a critical challenge for aging societies, 
necessitating the exploration of food ingredients and whole foods as potential 
therapeutic agents. This study aimed to identify natural compounds (NCs) with 
therapeutic potential in AD using an innovative bioinformatics-integrated deep 
neural analysis approach, combining computational predictions with molecular 
docking and in vitro experiments for comprehensive evaluation. We employed the 
bioinformatics-integrated deep neural analysis of NCs for Disease Discovery 
(BioDeepNat) application in the data collected from chemical databases. Random 
forest regression models were utilized to predict the IC50 (pIC50) values of 
ligands interacting with AD-related target proteins, including 
acetylcholinesterase (AChE), amyloid precursor protein (APP), beta-secretase 1 
(BACE1), microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT), presenilin-1 (PSEN1), tumor 
necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and valosin-containing protein (VCP). Their activities 
were then validated through a molecular docking analysis using Autodock Vina. 
Predictions by the deep neural analysis identified 166 NCs with potential 
effects on AD across seven proteins, demonstrating outstanding recall 
performance. The top five food sources of these predicted compounds were black 
walnut, safflower, ginger, fig, corn, and pepper. Statistical clustering 
methodologies segregated the NCs into six well-defined groups, each 
characterized by convergent structural and chemical signatures. The systematic 
examination of structure-activity relationships uncovered differential molecular 
patterns among clusters, illuminating the sophisticated correlation between 
molecular properties and biological activity. Notably, NCs with high activity, 
such as astragalin, dihydromyricetin, and coumarin, and medium activity, such as 
luteolin, showed promising effects in improving cell survival and reducing lipid 
peroxidation and TNF-α expression levels in PC12 cells treated with 
lipopolysaccharide. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate the efficacy of 
combining bioinformatics with deep neural networks to expedite the discovery of 
previously unidentified food-derived active ingredients (NCs) for AD 
intervention.

The Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products (RAGE), part of the 
immunoglobulin superfamily, plays a significant role in various essential 
functions under both normal and pathological conditions, especially in the 
progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). RAGE engages with several 
damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including advanced glycation end 
products (AGEs), beta-amyloid peptide (Aβ), high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), 
and S100 calcium-binding proteins. This interaction impairs the brain's ability 
to clear Aβ, resulting in increased Aβ accumulation, neuronal injury, and 
mitochondrial dysfunction. This further promotes inflammatory responses and 
oxidative stress, ultimately leading to a range of age-related diseases. Given 
RAGE's significant role in AD, inhibitors that target RAGE and its ligands hold 
promise as new strategies for treating AD, offering new possibilities for 
alleviating and treating this serious neurodegenerative disease. This article 
reviews the various pathogenic mechanisms of AD and summarizes the literature on 
the interaction between RAGE and its ligands in various AD-related pathological 
processes, with a particular focus on the evidence and mechanisms by which RAGE 
interactions with AGEs, HMGB1, Aβ, and S100 proteins induce cognitive impairment 
in AD. Furthermore, the article discusses the principles of action of RAGE 
inhibitors and inhibitors targeting RAGE-ligand interactions, along with 
relevant clinical trials.

Melatonin is a hormone released by the pineal gland that regulates the 
sleep-wake cycle. It has been widely studied for its therapeutic effects on 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), particularly through the amyloidosis, oxidative 
stress, and neuroinflammation pathways. Nevertheless, the mechanisms through 
which it exerts its neuroprotective effects in AD are still largely unknown. 
Data mining was used to identify potential gene targets that link melatonin's 
effects to AD pathways, yielding a comprehensive view of the underlying 
molecular mechanisms. We identified 3397 genes related to AD from DisGeNet and 
329 melatonin gene targets from ChEMBL, which revealed 223 overlapping genes and 
the potential shared pathways. These genes were used to construct a 
protein-protein interaction (PPI) network comprising 143 nodes and 823 edges, 
which demonstrated significant PPI enrichment. A cluster analysis highlighted 
two key clusters centered on MMP2 and NR3C1, with both genes playing crucial 
roles in steroid hormone signaling, apoptosis, and monoamine neurotransmission. 
Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment and KEGG pathway analyses further elucidated their 
involvement in critical pathways, for instance, steroid hormone signaling and 
apoptosis regulation, significantly influencing AD pathology through mechanisms 
such as extracellular matrix remodeling, epigenetic modifications, and 
neuroinflammation. Our findings emphasize MMP2 and NR3C1 as important gene 
targets for future research on melatonin treatment in AD, paving the way for 
further investigations into their roles in AD pathophysiology.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses a significant worldwide health challenge, 
requiring novel approaches for improved models and treatment development. This 
comprehensive review emphasises the systematic development and improvement of a 
biomimetic brain environment to address the shortcomings of existing AD models 
and enhance the efficiency of screening potential drug treatments. We identify 
drawbacks in traditional models and emphasise the necessity for more 
physiologically accurate systems through an in-depth analysis of current 
literature. This review aims to study the development of an advanced AD model 
that accurately replicates key AD pathophysiological aspects using cutting-edge 
biomaterials and microenvironment design. Incorporating biomolecular elements 
like Tau proteins and beta-amyloid (Aβ) plaques improve the accuracy of 
illustrating disease mechanisms. The expected results involve creating a solid 
foundation for high-throughput screening with enhanced scalability, 
translational significance, and the possibility of speeding up drug discovery. 
Thus, this review fills the gaps in AD modelling and shows potential for 
creating precise and efficient drug treatments for AD.

Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia, is characterized by the 
deposition of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain, leading 
to the loss of neurons and a decline in a person's memory and cognitive 
function. As a multifactorial disease, Alzheimer's involves multiple pathogenic 
mechanisms, making its treatment particularly challenging. Current drugs 
approved for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease only alleviate symptoms but 
cannot stop the progression. Moreover, these drugs typically target a single 
pathogenic mechanism, leaving other contributing factors unaddressed. Recent 
advancements in drug design have led to the development of multi-target-directed 
ligands (MTDLs), which have gained popularity for their ability to 
simultaneously target multiple pathogenic mechanisms. This paper focuses on 
analyzing the activity, mechanism of action, and binding properties of the 
anti-Alzheimer's MTDLs developed between 2020 and 2024.

BACKGROUND: Neurodegenerative diseases (NGD) encompass a range of progressive 
neurological conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's 
disease (PD), characterised by the gradual deterioration of neuronal structure 
and function. This degeneration manifests as cognitive decline, movement 
impairment, and dementia. Our focus in this investigation is on PD, a 
neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopamine-producing 
neurons in the brain, leading to motor disturbances. Early detection of PD is 
paramount for enhancing quality of life through timely intervention and tailored 
treatment. However, the subtle nature of initial symptoms, like slow movements, 
tremors, muscle rigidity, and psychological changes, often reduce daily task 
performance and complicate early diagnosis.
METHOD: To assist medical professionals in timely diagnosis of PD, we introduce 
a cutting-edge Multimodal Diagnosis framework (PMMD). Based on deep learning 
techniques, the PMMD framework integrates imaging, handwriting, drawing, and 
clinical data to accurately detect PD. Notably, it incorporates cross-modal 
attention, a methodology previously unexplored within the area, which 
facilitates the modelling of interactions between different data modalities.
RESULTS: The proposed method exhibited an accuracy of 96% on the independent 
tests set. Comparative analysis against state-of-the-art models, along with an 
in-depth exploration of attention mechanisms, highlights the efficacy of PMMD in 
PD classification.
CONCLUSIONS: The obtained results highlight exciting new prospects for the use 
of handwriting as a biomarker, along with other information, for optimal model 
performance. PMMD's success in integrating diverse data sources through 
cross-modal attention underscores its potential as a robust diagnostic decision 
support tool for accurately diagnosing PD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses a significant public health issue. Despite the 
fact that today there are several methods of maintenance therapy, one of the 
most widely used methods is designed to correct the deficiency of acetylcholine. 
In the search for new potential inhibitors of cholinesterase enzymes, eight new 
derivatives of 3-oxo- or 2,3-indolo-triterpenic acid conjugated with 
amino-quinuclidine bicyclic cores were designed and synthesized. Then, the 
obtained compounds were screened in Ellman's assays for their ability to inhibit 
acetylcholinesterase enzyme, and for each of the active compounds, the type of 
inhibition was determined. The obtained results demonstrate the dependence of 
the activity on the triterpenoid structure and the type of substituents. The 
best activity for ursolic acid derivatives was observed for the 3-oxoamide 8, 
with an IC50 value of 0.43 µM, acting as a mixed-type inhibitor. In turn, for 
the oleanane type, the amide with an indole unit in the A ring 11 exhibited the 
best activity with an IC50 value of 0.47 µM (while the ursane-type analog was 
weakly active) and led to an uncompetitive type of inhibition. Thus, 
3-amidoquinuclidine-triterpenoids conjugates could be considered novel 
inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase with a different mechanism of action.

e.g., for diagnosis and risk stratification. Less is known about the value of ML 
for predicting cognitive decline in people with dementia (PwD). The aim of this 
study was to use an ML approach to identify variables associated with a 
multimodal PA intervention that may impact cognitive changes in PwD, i.e., by 
distinguishing between cognitive decliners and non-decliners.
METHODS: This is a secondary, exploratory analysis using data from a Randomized 
Controlled Trial that included a 16-week multimodal PA intervention for the 
intervention group (IG) and treatment as usual for the control group (CG) in 
nursing homes. Predictors included in the ML models were related to the 
intervention (e.g., adherence), physical performance (e.g., mobility, balance), 
and pertinent health-related variables (e.g., health status, dementia form and 
severity). Primary outcomes were global and domain-specific cognitive 
performance (i.e., attention/ executive function, language, visuospatial skills, 
memory) assessed by standardized tests. A Support Vector Machine model was used 
to perform the classification of each primary outcome into the two classes of 
decline and non-decline. GridSearchCV with fivefold cross-validation was used 
for model training, and area under the ROC curve (AUC) and accuracy were 
calculated to assess model performance.
RESULTS: The study sample consisted of 319 PwD (IG, N = 161; CG, N = 158). The 
proportion of PwD experiencing cognitive decline, in the different domains 
measured, ranged from 27-48% in CG, and from 23-49% in IG, with no statistically 
significant differences and no time*group effects. ML models showed accuracy and 
AUC values ranging from 40.6-75.6. The strongest predictors of cognitive decline 
or non-decline were performance of activities of daily living in IG and CG, and 
adherence and mobility in IG.
CONCLUSIONS: ML models showed moderate performance, suggesting that the selected 
variables only had limited value for classification, with adherence and 
performance of activities of daily living appearing to be predictors of 
cognitive decline. While the study provides preliminary evidence of the 
potential use of ML approaches, larger studies are needed to confirm our 
observations and to include other variables in the prediction of cognitive 
decline, such as emotional health or biomarker abnormalities.

Three monoclonal antibodies directed against specific forms of the amyloid-β 
(Aβ) peptide have been granted accelerated or traditional approval by the FDA as 
treatments for Alzheimer disease, representing the first step towards bringing 
disease-modifying treatments for this disease into clinical practice. Here, we 
review the detection, underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and clinical 
implications of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), the most impactful 
adverse effect of anti-Aβ immunotherapy. ARIA appears as regions of oedema or 
effusions (ARIA-E) in brain parenchyma or sulci or as haemorrhagic lesions 
(ARIA-H) in the form of cerebral microbleeds, convexity subarachnoid 
haemorrhage, cortical superficial siderosis or intracerebral haemorrhage. 
Analysis of the radiographic appearance of ARIA, its clinical risk factors and 
underlying neuropathology, and results from animal models point to a central 
role for cerebral amyloid angiopathy - a condition characterized by 
cerebrovascular Aβ deposits - as a key component, either as a direct target for 
antibody-mediated inflammation or as recipient of Aβ mobilized from plaques in 
the Alzheimer brain parenchyma. The great majority of ARIA occurrences are 
associated with mild or no clinical symptoms. However, ~5% of all ARIA events 
are severe enough to result in hospitalization, permanent disability or death 
and thus raise challenging clinical questions regarding patient selection and 
use of concomitant agents. Therefore, identifying novel approaches to 
predicting, modelling, preventing and treating ARIA remains a key step towards 
allowing safe use of anti-Aβ immunotherapy for the world's rapidly ageing 
population.

Microbiome abnormalities (dysbiosis) significantly contribute to the progression 
of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the therapeutic efficacy of microbiome 
modulators in protecting against these ailments remains poorly studied. Herein, 
we tested a cocktail of unique probiotics, including 5 Lactobacillus and 5 
Enterococcus strains isolated from infant gut with proven microbiome modulating 
capabilities. We aimed to determine the probiotics cocktail's efficacy in 
ameliorating AD pathology in a humanized AD mouse model of APP/PS1 strains. 
Remarkably, feeding mice with 1 × 1011 CFU per day in drinking water for 16 
weeks significantly reduced cognitive decline (measured by the Morris Water Maze 
test) and AD pathology markers, such as Aβ aggregation, microglia activation, 
neuroinflammation, and preserved blood-brain barrier (BBB) tight junctions. The 
beneficial effects were linked to a reduced inflammatory microbiome, leading to 
decreased gut permeability and inflammation in both systemic circulation and the 
brain. Although both male and female mice showed overall improvements in 
cognition and biological markers, females did not exhibit improvements in 
specific markers related to inflammation and barrier permeability, suggesting 
that the underlying mechanisms may differ depending on sex. In conclusion, our 
results suggest that this unique probiotics cocktail could serve as a 
prophylactic agent to reduce the progression of cognitive decline and AD 
pathology. This is achieved by beneficially modulating the microbiome, improving 
intestinal tight junction proteins, reducing permeability in both gut and BBB, 
and decreasing inflammation in the gut, blood circulation, and brain, ultimately 
mitigating AD pathology and cognitive decline.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer disease is incurable, but it is possible to intervene and 
slow down the progression of dementia during periods of mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) through virtual reality (VR) technology.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to analyze the effects of VR interventions on older 
adults with MCI. The examined outcomes include cognitive abilities, mood, 
quality of life, and physical fitness, including general cognitive function, 
memory performance, attention and information processing speed, executive 
function, language proficiency, visuospatial abilities, depression, daily 
mobility of individuals, muscle performance, and gait and balance.
METHODS: A total of 4 web-based databases (Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, and 
Ovid) were searched up to December 30, 2023, for randomized controlled trials 
assessing the self-reported outcomes of VR-based technology on cognition, mood, 
quality of life, and physical fitness in older adults (aged ≥55 years) with MCI. 
Two reviewers independently screened the search results and reference lists of 
the identified papers and related reviews. Data on the intervention components 
and delivery and behavioral change techniques used were extracted. A 
meta-analysis, risk-of-bias sensitivity analysis, and subgroup analysis were 
performed where appropriate to explore potential moderators. The Grading of 
Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) approach was 
used to assess the quality of evidence.
RESULTS: This review analyzed 18 studies involving 722 older adults with MCI. VR 
was delivered through different immersion levels with VR cognitive training, VR 
physical training, or VR cognitive-motor dual-task training. VR interventions 
showed significant improvements in memory (standardized mean difference [SMD] 
0.2, 95% CI 0.02-0.38), attention and information processing speed (SMD 0.25, 
95% CI 0.06-0.45), and executive function (SMD 0.22, 95% CI 0.02-0.42). VR 
without therapist involvement improved memory as well as attention and 
information processing speed. VR cognitive training also resulted in significant 
improvements in attention and information processing speed in older adults with 
MCI (SMD 0.31, 95% CI 0.05-0.58). In addition, immersive VR had a significant 
impact on improving attention and information processing speed (SMD 0.25; 95% CI 
0.01-0.50) and executive function (SMD 0.25; 95% CI 0.00-0.50). However, the 
effects of the intervention were very small in terms of general cognitive 
function, language proficiency, visuospatial abilities, depression, daily living 
ability, muscle performance, and gait and balance. Quality of evidence varied, 
with moderate ratings for certain cognitive functions and low ratings for 
others, based on the GRADE approach.
CONCLUSIONS: VR interventions can improve memory, attention and information 
processing speed, and executive function in older adults with MCI. The quality 
of evidence is moderate to low, and further research is needed to confirm these 
findings and explore additional health-related outcomes.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive degenerative disease that affects a 
growing number of elderly individuals worldwide. OAB-14, a novel chemical 
compound developed by our research group, has been approved by the China Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical trials in patients with AD (approval 
no. YD-OAB-220210). Previous studies have shown that OAB-14 enhances cognitive 
function in APP/PS1 transgenic mice and ameliorates abnormal mitochondrial 
morphology in the hippocampus. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a major risk factor 
for the development of AD, and maintaining healthy mitochondrial morphology and 
function is essential for improving the pathological changes and symptoms of AD. 
However, the protective effects of OAB-14 on mitochondria in AD and the 
underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the 
protective effects of OAB-14 on the mitochondria of APP/PS1 transgenic mice and 
N2a/APP cells. Treatment with OAB-14 restored impaired mitochondrial function, 
mitochondrial dynamics, mitophagy, and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in APP/PS1 
transgenic mice and N2a/APP cells. In APP/PS1 transgenic mice and N2a/APP cells, 
OAB-14-treated elevated the expression and activity of SIRT3, decreased 
mitochondrial acetylation, and reduced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species 
(mtROS) levels. OAB-14 also attenuated mitochondrial acetylation, improved 
mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy, and mitigated mtDNA damage in a 
SIRT3-dependent manner. In addition, OAB-14 suppressed mitochondrial Aβ 
accumulation in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 transgenic mice. This study provides 
further clarification on the potential therapeutic mechanisms of OAB-14 in the 
treatment of AD and lays the groundwork for future drug applications.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nanoscale, membrane-enclosed structures 
released by cells into the extracellular milieu. These vesicles encapsulate a 
diverse array of molecular constituents, including nucleic acids, proteins, and 
lipids, which provide insights into the physiological or pathological conditions 
of their parent cells. Despite their potential, the study of EV-derived DNA 
(EV-DNA) has gathered relatively limited attention. This review aims to present 
a thorough examination of the emerging knowledge surrounding the utility of 
EV-DNA as a non-invasive biomarker across a spectrum of diseases. The review 
delves into various mechanisms underlying DNA packaging within EVs and the 
prevalent methodologies employed for extraction of EV-DNA. The relevance of 
EV-DNA is assessed across numerous health conditions, notably cancer, 
cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, infectious diseases, and 
pregnancy-related complications. The use of EV-DNA for cancer mutation detection 
has demonstrated remarkable sensitivity and specificity, thereby enhancing both 
diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic monitoring. In the context of cardiovascular 
diseases, EV-DNA serves as a predictive marker for events such as myocardial 
infarctions and shows a correlation with the severity of the disease. With 
respect to neurodegenerative conditions, including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, 
EV-DNA contributes to the understanding of disease mechanisms and progression. 
Additionally, it plays an essential role in modulating immune tolerance and 
facilitating communication between maternal and fetal systems. Although there is 
a pressing need for standardized protocols for EV isolation and DNA analysis to 
facilitate clinical implementation, the prospect of EV-DNA as a non-invasive 
biomarker for diagnostic and prognostic purposes across diverse pathological 
conditions is considerable.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by cognitive decline, extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque 
accumulation, and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. Recent efforts to find 
effective therapies have increased interest in natural compounds with 
multifaceted effects on AD pathology. This study explores natural compounds for 
their potential to mitigate AD pathology using molecular docking, ADME 
screening, and in vitro assays, with ruscogenin─a steroidal sapogenin from 
Ruscus aculeatus─emerging as a promising candidate. Ruscogenin, known for its 
antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, was investigated for its effects 
on Aβ aggregation, a critical process in AD progression. In vitro assays 
demonstrated that ruscogenin inhibits Aβ oligomerization at equimolar and higher 
molar ratios. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations further revealed that 
ruscogenin targets aggregation-prone regions, reducing noncovalent interactions 
and the solvent-accessible surface area of Aβ aggregates. These effects were 
concentration-dependent, with higher concentrations yielding optimal inhibition, 
pointing to a multiphasic behavior in ruscogenin's modulation of Aβ aggregation. 
This study highlights ruscogenin's potential as a natural therapeutic agent for 
AD, capable of addressing both oxidative stress and inflammation. The findings 
lay the groundwork for further exploration of ruscogenin-based interventions and 
underscore the broader potential of natural compounds in AD treatment 
strategies.

OBJECTIVE: Focused ultrasound (FUS)-mediated blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening 
is safe and potentially beneficial in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) for 
the removal of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques. However, the optimal BBB opening 
intervals and number of treatment sessions for clinical improvement remain 
undefined. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and 
benefits of repeated and more extensive BBB opening alone.
METHODS: In this open-label prospective study, 6 patients with AD were enrolled 
from June 2022 to July 2023. FUS-mediated BBB opening was performed three times 
at 2-month intervals targeting the bilateral frontal lobes. 18F-florbetaben 
positron emission tomography (FBB-PET) was performed before the first procedure 
and after the third procedure. Patients were administered neuropsychological and 
neuropsychiatric evaluations.
RESULTS: All 6 participants completed the study without any acute 
treatment-related adverse events. An extensive area of BBB opening (mean 43.1 
cm3), more than twice as large as the opening volume (mean 20 cm3) in the 
authors' previous study, was confirmed by contrast-enhanced MRI. FBB-PET scans 
demonstrated a 14.9-Centiloid average decrease in Aβ plaques in 4 of the 6 
participants (67%), but the Aβ plaques increased in 2 participants after BBB 
opening, compared with baseline. No significant changes were observed in the 
Korean version of the Mini-Mental State Examination in either group. 
Caregiver-Administered Neuropsychiatric Inventory scores improved in 5 of 6 
participants (83%), indicating an improvement in neuropsychiatric symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the safety and efficacy of more frequent and 
extensive bilateral frontal BBB opening over multiple sessions in patients with 
AD. Furthermore, this is the first clinical trial to demonstrate improvement in 
neuropsychiatric symptoms through BBB opening alone, without concurrent 
administration of antibody medications.

SIGNIFICANCE: In an aging population, the number of people living with 
neurodegenerative disease is projected to increase. It is vital to develop 
reliable, noninvasive biomarkers to detect disease onset and monitor 
progression, and there is a growing body of research into the ocular surface as 
a potential source of such biomarkers.
BACKGROUND: This article reviews the potential of in vivo corneal confocal 
microscopy and tear fluid analysis as tools for biomarker development. Corneal 
confocal microscopy, traditionally used for studying corneal health, offers 
high-resolution imaging of corneal nerves and has shown promise for examining 
systemic diseases such as Alzheimer disease and Parkinson's disease. 
Complementarily, tear fluid analysis, known for its ease of collection, reflects 
systemic changes in neurodegenerative conditions.
CONCLUSION: Together, these noninvasive techniques provide insights into disease 
onset and progression and hold potential for advancing diagnostic and treatment 
strategies.

BACKGROUND: Dementia leads to cognitive decline affecting memory, thinking, and 
behavior. Current pharmaceutical treatments are symptomatic, with limited 
efficacy and significant drawbacks. Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb761) is being 
explored as an adjuvant therapy for dementia because of its potential 
neuroprotective effects.Areas of Uncertainty:Despite decades of study, EGb761 
has not been incorporated into treatment guidelines for these conditions. This 
review evaluates research futility in EGb761 trials for dementia, analyzing 
efficacy and methodological challenges to inform future research directions.
DATA SOURCES: In this review, we investigate the efficacy and adverse reactions 
of Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb761) as a treatment for Alzheimer disease or 
vascular dementia. We searched the randomized controlled trials published 
between 2006 and 2023 on PubMed and ScienceDirect.
RESULTS: The 7 selected studies have shown that the degree of improvement in 
standard cognitive assessment scores [Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), 
short cognitive performance test (SKT), neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI)] was 
not significant enough for a substantial proportion of patients. Improvements of 
the SKT score with at least 3 points in the Alzheimer disease/vascular dementia 
groups were found only in 2 out of 7 studies, changes of less than 2 points in 
MMSE score were found in 2 of the studies, while an improvement of at least 4 
points in NPI scores was reported in 4 out of 7 studies. We aim to understand 
why this extract has not reached the level of evidence to be included in 
guideline recommendation despite extensive research and what have we learned 
from systematic reviews performed since 2010? Studies included in this review 
have shown some improvement in outcome scores with EGb761 treatment compared 
with placebo, but these improvements did not reach the threshold for clinically 
significant enhancement in MMSE/SKT/NPI scores. Limitations such as small sample 
sizes, minimal score changes, predominantly placebo comparisons, and short 
follow-up durations make it challenging to determine the usefulness of EGb761 in 
dementia treatment. The changes observed and methodological constraints 
underscore the uncertainty surrounding the efficacy of EGb761.
CONCLUSION: The findings do not consistently demonstrate the clinical utility of 
EGb761, and improved scores on cognitive and neuropsychiatric assessments may 
not necessarily translate into meaningful clinical outcomes for patients with 
dementia. Starting from the question "What have we learned in the past 18 
years?", the answer would be: not much. Consequently, the question raised is: 
how long should we go on with the same conclusion, continuing to spend time and 
financial resources to replicate these results? Research strategies should be 
refined to optimize decision making and advance evidence-based care for 
neurocognitive disorders.

Identifying drug-target binding affinity (DTA) plays a critical role in 
early-stage drug discovery. Despite the availability of various existing 
methods, there are still two limitations. Firstly, sequence-based methods often 
extract features from fixed length protein sequences, requiring truncation or 
padding, which can result in information loss or the introduction of unwanted 
noise. Secondly, structure-based methods prioritize extracting topological 
information but struggle to effectively capture sequence features. To address 
these challenges, we propose a novel deep learning model named GraphkmerDTA, 
which integrates Kmer features with structural topology. Specifically, 
GraphkmerDTA utilizes graph neural networks to extract topological features from 
both molecules and proteins, while fully connected networks learn local sequence 
patterns from the Kmer features of proteins. Experimental results indicate that 
GraphkmerDTA outperforms existing methods on benchmark datasets. Furthermore, a 
case study on lung cancer demonstrates the effectiveness of GraphkmerDTA, as it 
successfully identifies seven known EGFR inhibitors from a screening library of 
over two thousand compounds. To further assess the practical utility of 
GraphkmerDTA, we integrated it with network pharmacology to investigate the 
mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of Lonicera japonica flower in 
treating Alzheimer's disease. Through this interdisciplinary approach, three 
potential compounds were identified and subsequently validated through molecular 
docking studies. In conclusion, we present not only a novel AI model for the DTA 
task but also demonstrate its practical application in drug discovery by 
integrating modern AI approaches with traditional drug discovery methodologies.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Growing evidence suggests that the gut-brain axis 
influences brain function, particularly the role of intestinal microbiota in 
modulating cognitive processes. Probiotics may alter brain function and behavior 
by modulating gut microbiota, with implications for neurodegenerative diseases 
like Alzheimer's disease (AD). The purpose of this review is to systematically 
review the current literature exploring the effects of probiotic supplementation 
on gut microbiota and cognitive function in AD and mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI).
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted across PubMed/Medline, 
Embase, and Scopus to identify relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from 
inception to 20 August 2024. The search focused on comparing outcomes between 
intervention and control/placebo groups. Data searches, article selection, data 
extraction, and risk of bias assessment were performed in accordance with 
Cochrane guidelines.
SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO registration no: CRD42023446796.
RESULTS: Data from four RCTs involving 293 Individuals (AD and MCI patients) 
receiving mainly Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains showed some 
beneficial effects on cognitive function, altered gut microbiota composition, 
and positively affected metabolic biomarkers. However, variability in microbiota 
assessment across studies limits the interpretation of results. The limited 
number and quality of the existing studies make it difficult to draw definitive 
conclusions from the data. Additional high-quality research is clearly needed.
CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics show promise as an adjunctive intervention for cognitive 
decline, but larger, long-term trials are needed to confirm their efficacy and 
clinical applicability in neurodegenerative diseases like AD.

BACKGROUND: We sought to characterize the cognitive profile among individuals 
with mild cognitive impairment with Lewy bodies (MCI-LB) to help guide future 
clinical criteria.
METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis included MCI-LB studies with 
cognitive data from PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and PsycINFO (January 1990 
to March 2023). MCI-LB scores were compared to controls, MCI due to Alzheimer's 
disease (MCI-AD), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) groups with random-effects 
models.
RESULTS: We included 26 studies and 2823 participants. Across all domains, the 
MCI-LB group performed worse than controls and better than DLB. Compared to 
MCI-AD, the MCI-LB group performed worse in attention/processing speed 
(g = -0.24, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.35, -0.12), attention/executive 
(g = -0.42, 95% CI: -0.56, -0.28); better in verbal immediate recall (g = 0.37; 
95% CI: 0.15, 0.59) and delayed memory (g = 0.40; 95% CI: 0.22, 0.58).
DISCUSSION: The cognitive profiles in MCI-LB and MCI-AD are consistent with 
established profiles in DLB and AD. Neuropsychological assessment may be helpful 
in differential diagnosis, even in early disease states.
HIGHLIGHTS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis for cognition in 
mild cognitive impairment with Lewy bodies (MCI-LB). Compared to MCI due to 
Alzheimer's disease (MCI-AD), MCI-LB had worse attention, executive function, 
and processing speed. Compared to MCI-AD, MCI-LB had better verbal immediate and 
delayed recall. The MCI-LB group was worse on all cognitive domains than 
controls, and better than dementia with Lewy bodies. Studies used different 
tests and there is a need for global efforts for harmonization.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease 
marked by increased amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition, tau hyperphosphorylation, 
impaired energy metabolism, and chronic ischemia-type injury. Cerebral 
microvascular dysfunction likely contributes to AD pathology, but its precise 
pathogenic role has been poorly defined.
OBJECTIVE: To examine microvascular reactivity to endothelium-dependent 
vasodilators and small conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channel 
activity in an intracerebral streptozotocin (STZ)-induced AD mouse model.
METHODS: Control and STZ-AD mice underwent Morris Water Maze and Barnes testing, 
after which cerebral microvascular and brain microvascular endothelial cells 
(MBMECs) were dissected to assess microvascular reactivity, responses to SK 
channel activator NS309, and ion-channel current recordings using whole-cell 
patch clamp methodology. Control mouse cerebral microvascular and human brain 
microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) were treated with soluble Aβ1-42 
peptide to characterize microvascular reactivity and endothelial potassium 
currents.
RESULTS: STZ-AD mice exhibited impaired performance vs control mice in 
behavioral testing. STZ-AD mice also exhibited diminished cerebral microvascular 
responsiveness and MBMECs potassium current augmentation in response to NS309 
compared with control mice. Incubation of control mouse cerebral micro-vessels 
and HBMECs with soluble Aβ (1 µM) for 2 h attenuated relaxation responses to 
NS309 and diminished NS309-sensitive endothelial potassium currents.
CONCLUSIONS: STZ-AD mice exhibited impaired microvascular relaxation responses 
to endothelium-dependent vasodilators; SK/IK channel dysfunction may be involved 
in the mechanism of this impairment. Acute treatment with Aβ produced 
dysregulated cerebrovascular endothelial SK/IK channels. Further elucidation of 
the role of microvascular dysfunction in AD is needed to prevent the chronic 
ischemia-type injury that contributes to cognitive decline.

BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are two 
prevalent chronic diseases that pose significant global health challenges. 
Increasing evidence suggests a complex bidirectional relationship between these 
conditions, where T2D elevates the risk of AD, and AD exacerbates glucose 
metabolism abnormalities in T2D.
OBJECTIVE: This review explores the molecular mechanisms linking T2D and AD, 
focusing on the role of insulin signaling pathways and oxidative stress.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search from PubMed, Web of Science, and 
other relevant databases was conducted and analyzed.
RESULTS: Insulin resistance in T2D leads to impaired insulin signaling in the 
brain, contributing to cognitive decline and the development of AD. 
Hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress exacerbates neuronal damage, promoting 
the formation of amyloid-β plaques and neurofibrillary tangles characteristic of 
AD. Clinically antidiabetic drugs such as metformin show potential against AD in 
preclinical studies; Many natural products such as Dendrobium nobile Lindl. have 
anti-T2D efficacy and are also effective against AD in various in vivo and in 
vitro models.
CONCLUSIONS: Improving insulin resistance and reducing oxidative stress are 
important strategies in the treatment of T2D and AD. To understand the bridging 
role of insulin singling and oxidative stress in T2D and AD will provide 
insights and broader applications in alleviating T2D and AD.

Evoked potential metrics extracted from an EEG exam can provide novel sources of 
information regarding brain function. While the P300 occurring around 300 ms 
post-stimulus has been extensively investigated in relation to mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI), with decreased amplitude and increased latency, the P200 
response has not, particularly in an oddball-stimulus paradigm. This study 
compares the auditory P200 amplitudes between MCI (28 patients aged 74(8)) and 
non-MCI, (35 aged 72(4)). Data were collected in routine clinical evaluations 
where EEG with audio oddball ERPs were measured as part of a health screening 
exam from 2 clinics serving MCI patients and one clinic serving a non-MCI 
population as part of a wellness/preventative care program. We also investigated 
the disease course for 3 patients as case studies. The results revealed the P200 
amplitudes to be significantly increased in the MCI compared to the non-MCI 
groups, alongside the expected reduction in P300, Trail Making, and reaction 
time. Moreover, the ratio of P200-to-P300 was also increased in the MCI groups 
even in cases where the P300 was strong. This trend continued for patients who 
were tracked from early-to-later stages in the case studies. While the 
pathophysiology of the P200 response in a 2-tone auditory oddball protocol is 
not well understood, this measure may help indicate signs of early MCI, 
particularly in cases where the P300 is still strong.

BACKGROUND: There is consistent evidence for the contribution of modifiable risk 
factors to dementia risk, offering opportunities for primary prevention. Yet, 
most individuals are unaware of these opportunities.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether online education about dementia risk reduction 
may be a low-level means to increase knowledge and support self-management of 
modifiable dementia risk factors.
METHODS: A pre-post study was conducted with Dutch community-dwelling 
individuals who registered for a free e-learning course called "Keep your brain 
healthy". The e-learning covers seven themes delivered week-by-week covering 
cognitive and physical activity, diet, and cardiovascular health, amongst 
others. Participants completed an online survey before starting the e-learning, 
immediately afterwards, and three months later. The survey covered user 
experience, knowledge on dementia risk reduction, motivation for, and engagement 
in, health behaviors.
RESULTS: Of the 477 participants (70.9% women, mean age = 63 years), 339 (71.1%) 
completed the survey immediately after the e-learning, and 241 (50.5%) completed 
the three-month follow-up survey. User experiences were positive with weekly 
themes receiving average ratings between 7.9-8.1 out of 10. Improvements over 
time were seen in knowledge of dementia risk reduction, Mediterranean diet 
adherence, social contact satisfaction, and motivation for physical activity. 
Cognitive activity levels and alcohol consumption improved over time in women. 
Moreover, improvements in knowledge and Mediterranean diet adherence remained 
present three months after course completion.
CONCLUSIONS: This e-learning program was positively perceived, increased 
knowledge of dementia risk reduction, and promoted engagement in brain-healthy 
lifestyles. The program can easily be implemented as a stand-alone tool or as 
part of larger dementia risk reduction initiatives.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to examine the potential added value of 
including neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in machine learning (ML) models, along 
with demographic features and Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers, to predict 
decline or non-decline in global and domain-specific cognitive scores among 
community-dwelling older adults.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of adding NPS to AD biomarkers on ML model 
accuracy in predicting cognitive decline among older adults.
METHODS: The study was conducted in the setting of the Mayo Clinic Study of 
Aging, including participants aged ≥ 50 years with information on demographics 
(i.e., age, sex, education), NPS (i.e., Neuropsychiatric Inventory 
Questionnaire; Beck Depression and Anxiety Inventories), at least one AD 
biomarker (i.e., plasma-, neuroimaging- and/or cerebrospinal fluid 
[CSF]-derived), and at least 2 repeated neuropsychological assessments. We 
trained and tested ML models using a stepwise feature addition approach to 
predict decline versus non-decline in global and domain-specific (i.e., memory, 
language, visuospatial, and attention/executive function) cognitive scores.
RESULTS: ML models had better performance when NPS were included along with a) 
neuroimaging biomarkers for predicting decline in global cognition, as well as 
language and visuospatial skills; b) plasma-derived biomarkers for predicting 
decline in visuospatial skills; and c) CSF-derived biomarkers for predicting 
decline in attention/executive function, language, and memory.
CONCLUSIONS: NPS, added to ML models including demographic and AD biomarker 
data, improves prediction of downward trajectories in global and domain-specific 
cognitive scores among community-dwelling older adults, albeit effect sizes are 
small. These preliminary findings need to be confirmed by future cohort studies.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD), the leading cause of dementia, is 
characterized by cognitive decline and the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ). It 
affects millions, with numbers expected to double by 2050. SMOC2, implicated in 
inflammation and fibrosis, may play a role in AD pathogenesis, particularly in 
microglial cell function, offering a potential therapeutic target.
OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) leads to neurodegeneration, affecting 
cognition, language, and personality, underscoring the urgency for effective 
treatments. Our study investigates the role of secreted modular calcium-binding 
protein 2 (SMOC2) in microglial cells and its impact on AD pathology.
METHODS: We introduced SMOC2 overexpression and interference vectors into 
microglial cells treated with Aβ. Activity and phagocytosis were assessed using 
CCK8 and flow cytometry. SMOC2 mRNA levels were quantified by qPCR, and protein 
levels of SMOC2, TGF-β1, p-NF-κB/NF-κB were analyzed by western blot. Aβ content 
was determined by ELISA, and immunofluorescence detected TNF-α, IL-1β, CD163, 
and CD206.
RESULTS: Aβ treatment inhibited microglial activity and phagocytosis, but SMOC2 
disruption enhanced these functions (p < 0.05). SMOC2 overexpression increased 
its expression and Aβ levels, while interference reduced them (p < 0.001). SMOC2 
overexpression also decreased TGF-β1, CD163, and CD206, and increased 
p-NF-κB/NF-κB, TNF-α, and IL-1β (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: SMOC2 plays a crucial role in microglial cell activity, 
phagocytosis, and polarization, potentially through the TGF-β1/NF-κB pathway, 
offering insights into AD pathogenesis.

INTRODUCTION: Neuroinflammation derived from the activation of the microglia is 
considered a vital pathogenic factor of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). T-006, a 
tetramethylpyrazine derivative, has been found to alleviate cognitive deficits 
via inhibiting tau expression and phosphorylation in AD transgenic mouse models. 
Recently, T-006 has been proven to dramatically decrease the levels of total 
Amyloid β (Aβ) peptide and Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) and suppress 
the expression of ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule-1 (Iba-1) in APP/PS1 
mice. Therefore, we have further investigated the effects of T-006 on 
neuroinflammation in AD-like pathology.
METHODS: The anti-inflammatory effects of T-006 and its underlying mechanisms 
were evaluated in Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced AD rats. The potential 
protective effects against LPS-activated microglia-mediated neurotoxicity were 
also measured.
RESULTS: T-006 significantly improved the cognitive impairment in LPS-induced AD 
rats by inhibiting the microglia/astrocyte activation. Further cellular assays 
found that T-006 significantly reserved the anomalous elevation of inflammatory 
cytokines in LPS-induced BV2 microglial cells in a concentration-dependent 
manner, while T-006 treatment alone showed no effects on the normal cultured 
cells. T-006 also reduced the levels of Toll-like Receptor 4 (TLR4)/Myeloid 
Differentiation protein-88 (MyD88)/NF-κB signaling-related proteins in BV2 cells 
exposed to LPS stimulation. TAK242, which selectively inhibits TLR4, slightly 
lessened the effects of T-006 in LPS-treatment BV2 cells without significance. 
Importantly, T-006 protected neurons against LPS-induced neuroinflammation by 
inhibiting the Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) production and maintaining 
mitochondrial function.
CONCLUSION: T-006 inhibited TLR4-mediated MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathways to 
suppress neuroinflammation in the LPS-induced AD rat model.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia, 
characterized by amyloid-β plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. With an aging 
population, both AD and comorbidities are increasingly common. Managing 
comorbidities often requires multiple medications, leading to polypharmacy, 
defined as the concurrent use of five or more medications.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to estimate and compare the prevalence of 
polypharmacy one-year prior AD diagnosis compared to non-AD individuals.Methods: 
A matched cross-sectional design used data from the IADB.nl prescription 
database (1994-2021), including individuals aged 65 and older with at least one 
AD medication prescription within a year. Controls were matched by age and sex 
at a 9:1 ratio. Analyses were stratified by time period (≤2010 and >2010) and 
further by sex and age.
RESULTS: 4150 AD individuals were included and matched with 37,350 controls. AD 
individuals had a higher prevalence of polypharmacy compared to controls, ≤ 2010 
(OR: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.03-1.29), > 2010 (OR: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.16-1.36). Females 
with AD had slightly higher odds of polypharmacy than males. The prevalence was 
consistent across different time periods and age groups, with the highest odds 
in individuals aged 65-74.
CONCLUSIONS: AD individuals in the Netherlands exhibit a significantly higher 
prevalence of polypharmacy in a year pre-AD diagnosis. The findings highlight 
the complexity of managing multiple comorbid conditions in AD individuals, 
emphasizing the need for regular review and optimization of medication regimens 
and the inclusion of non-pharmacological interventions to minimize adverse 
outcomes and improve quality of life.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex, incurable neurological condition 
characterized by cognitive decline, cholinergic neuron reduction, and neuronal 
loss. Its exact pathology remains uncertain, but multiple treatment hypotheses 
have emerged. The current treatments, single or combined, alleviate only 
symptoms and struggle to manage AD due to its multifaceted pathology. The 
developmental drugs target pivotal disease factors involved in the envisaged 
hypotheses and include targets such as amyloid aggregation, hyperphosphorylated 
tau proteins, and receptors like cholinergic, adrenergic, etc. Present-day 
research focuses on multi-target directed ligands (MTDLs), which inhibit 
multiple factors simultaneously, helping slow the disease's progression. This 
review attempts to collate the recent information related to proposed hypotheses 
for AD etiology. It systematically organizes the advances in various therapeutic 
options for AD, with a particular emphasis on clinical candidates. Also, it is 
expected to help medicinal chemists design novel AD treatments based on 
available information, which could be helpful to AD patients.

Brain damage induced by ischemia promotes the development of cognitive 
dysfunction, thus increasing the risk of dementia such as Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). Studies indicate that cellular acidification-triggered activation of 
asparagine endopeptidase (AEP) plays a key role in ischemic brain injury, 
through multiple molecular pathways, including cleavage of its substrates such 
as SET (inhibitor 2 of PP2A, I2 PP2A) and Tau. However, whether direct targeting 
AEP can effectively prevent post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) remains 
unanswered. Here, we explored the therapeutic effect and underlying mechanism of 
the AEP inhibitor AENK on cognitive impairment of the rats with middle cerebral 
artery occlusion (MCAO) and on neuronal damage in cultured primary neurons 
exposed to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD). We found that the 
administration of AENK significantly reduces activated AEP levels in ischemic 
rat brains, attenuates cognitive deficits, and rescues synaptic dysfunction. For 
the mechanism, with AEP inhibition, cleavage of SET, inhibition of protein 
phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and Tau hyperphosphorylation resulted from PP2A 
inhibition, were all completely or partially reversed. In primary neurons, AENK 
effectively prevents AEP activation, SET cleavage and cytoplasmic retention, tau 
hyperphosphorylation and synaptic damage induced by OGD. We conclude that AENK 
ameliorates cognitive impairment and prevents tau hyperphosphorylation, through 
inhibiting AEP-mediated cleavage of SET in ischemic brain injury, and direct 
inhibition of AEP might be a potential therapeutic strategy for preventing 
synaptic damage and cognitive impairment after stroke.

OBJECTIVE: Cognitive impairment is a common nonmotor symptom among individuals 
with Parkinson's disease (PD). Although cognitive impairment generally develops 
progressively, individuals with PD-associated mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) 
may revert to being cognitively normal (CN), which is referred to as PD-MCI 
reversion. Previous studies are inconsistent in whether PD-MCI reverters are at 
greater risk for PD-MCI recurrence relative to CN individuals. Even less is 
known about how PD-MCI reverters compare with CN individuals or PD-MCI 
nonreverters in terms of neurodegenerative biomarkers. The authors examined 
group differences (CN, PD-MCI reversion, and PD-MCI nonreversion) in 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers of Alzheimer's disease (AD), including amyloid 
beta, tau (total [t-tau] and phosphorylated [p-tau]), and alpha-synuclein.
METHODS: Data from the longitudinal international multisite Parkinson 
Progression Marker Initiative were used. Participants were newly diagnosed as 
having PD (N=430) and completed a battery of neurocognitive assessments at 
baseline and annual follow-ups for up to 5 years. Participants were classified 
as CN, PD-MCI reverters, or PD-MCI nonreverters on the basis of the first two 
neurocognitive assessments.
RESULTS: The PD-MCI nonreversion group had greater p-tau:amyloid beta and 
t-tau:amyloid beta ratios relative to the PD-MCI reversion group. The CN and 
PD-MCI reversion groups did not significantly differ in any of the CSF markers.
CONCLUSIONS: PD-MCI reverters may have a more favorable trajectory in terms of 
AD pathology relative to PD-MCI nonreverters. Future studies are needed to 
verify whether PD-MCI reversion may represent an intermediate prognostic group 
between CN individuals and those with MCI nonreversion.

Alzheimer disease is a neurodegenerative pathology-modifying mitochondrial 
metabolism with energy impairments where the effects of biological sex and DNA 
repair deficiencies are unclear. We investigated the therapeutic potential of 
dietary ketosis alone or with supplemental nicotinamide riboside (NR) on 
hippocampal intermediary metabolism and mitochondrial bioenergetics in older 
male and female wild-type (Wt) and 3xTgAD-DNA polymerase-β-deficient 
(3xTg/POLβ+/-) (AD) mice. DNA polymerase-β is a key enzyme in DNA base excision 
repair (BER) of oxidative damage that may also contribute to mitochondrial DNA 
repair. Metabolic alterations imparted by ketosis and/or NR were assessed in 16 
male and female groups, 4 Wt and 4 AD. At 73 weeks of age, mice were divided 
into: (A) carbohydrate diet (Carb); (B) Carb diet with NR (Carb-NR); (C) Ket 
diet (Ket); and (D) Ket diet with NR (Ket-NR) groups and remained on their 
respective treatments for 12 weeks. Mice were euthanized and hippocampi were 
rapidly removed and frozen. Glycolytic and TCA cycle intermediates were 
determined by quantitative GC-MS and the ratios of the mitochondrial free 
[NADox]/[NADHred] and coenzyme ubiquinone (CoQ/CoQH2) couples and the Gibbs free 
energy of the Complex I-II system of the electron transport chain (ETC) ( 
∆Gmitochondrial Complex I-II' ) were calculated from selected metabolites. Mice 
in Groups C and D had elevated blood ketones (1-2 mM). In most groupings, male 
mice had higher concentrations of TCA cycle intermediates than females. 
Moreover, higher concentrations of fumarate in Wt males were associated with 
elevations in the ΔG' of Complex I-II compared to females. In Wt males, NR 
treatments were associated with elevated concentrations of α-ketoglutarate and 
malate and linked to increased energy of Complex I-II. In AD males, both NR 
treatment and dietary ketosis restored the ΔG' of Complex I-II, where the ratio 
of the CoQ/CoQH2 couple was oxidized and the [NADox]/[NADHred] couple was 
reduced. In AD females, only mice in the Ket diet group had a sufficiently 
reduced [NADox]/[NADHred] couple to restore the free energy profile.

OBJECTIVES: The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasing globally, 
however its pathogenesis is still unclear. The evidence showed that the 
progression of AD was closely related to the apoptosis of nerve cells. This 
study amis to explore the role and specific mechanism of miR-15a and Bag5 in the 
apoptosis of nerve cells induced by beta-amyloid protein (Aβ) in AD.
METHODS: The AD rat model was constructed by injecting Aβ42 into SD rat brain 
and the AD cell model was constructed by treating SH-SY5Y cells with Aβ42. The 
learning and memory ability of rats was detected by Morris Water Maze. 
Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining was used to detect the pathological changes 
of brain tissues. Nissl staining was used to detect the changes of cell 
morphology and number in brain tissues. The upstream miRNA that interacted with 
Bag5 were screened by bioinformatics analysis. Methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium 
(MTT) assay was used to detect cell proliferation. Flow cytometry was used to 
detect the apoptosis rate of cells. Real-time reverse transcription PCR 
(real-time RT-PCR) was used to detect the mRNA levels of miR-15a and Bag5. 
Western blotting was used to detect the protein expression levels of Bag5, Bax 
and Caspase-3. MiR-15a knockdown or overexpression vectors or Bag5 knockdown 
vectors were transfected into AD rat model and AD cell models, respectively. 
Luciferase reporter assay was used to verify the binding relationship between 
miR-15a and Bag5.
RESULTS: Morris Water Maze, HE staining and Nissl staining showed that the rat 
model of AD was established successfully, and Aβ could induce neuronal apoptosis 
and inhibit the expression of miR-15a in AD rats. Compared with normal cells, Aβ 
treatment significantly increased apoptosis rate and Bag5 expression, and 
weakened cell proliferation and miR-15a (all P<0.01). Overexpression of miR-15a 
further enhanced the effect of Aβ on cell proliferation and apoptosis, while 
knockdown of miR-15a expression had the opposite effect (all P<0.01). Luciferase 
reporter assay confirmed that there was a negative targeting relationship 
between miR-15a and Bag5. Compared with Bag5 knockdown alone, the 
co-transfection of miR-15a inhibitor and si-Bag5 significantly increased the 
cell proliferation ability and mRNA and protein levels of Bag5, and 
significantly reduced the cell apoptosis rate and the expression of Bax and 
Caspase-3, animal studies have also shown consistent results (all P<0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Aβ can inhibit the expression of miR-15a, thereby inducing the 
expression of Bag5 and activating the protective mechanism of Bag5 against Aβ 
induced apoptosis.

protein，Aβ)诱导的AD神经细胞凋亡中的作用及其具体机制。方法: 
通过给SD大鼠脑部注射Aβ42构建AD大鼠模型，并使用Aβ42处理SH-SY5Y细胞构建AD细胞模型。采用莫里斯(Morris)水迷宫实验检测大鼠的学习记忆能力；苏木精-伊红(hematoxylin

thiazolyl tetrazolium，MTT)检测细胞增殖能力；流式细胞术检测细胞的凋亡率；实时反转录聚合酶链反应(real-time reverse 
transcription PCR，real-time 
RT-PCR)检测miR-15a和Bag5的mRNA水平；蛋白质印迹法检测Bag5、Bax和Caspase-3的蛋白质表达水平。分别采用miR-15a敲减或过表达载体以及Bag5敲减载体处理大鼠和细胞，萤光素酶报告实验验证miR-15a与Bag5之间的结合关系。结果: 
Morris水迷宫实验、HE染色和Nissl染色结果表明AD大鼠模型成功建立，且Aβ可诱导AD大鼠中神经细胞凋亡和抑制miR-15a表达。与正常细胞相比，Aβ处理可显著增加细胞凋亡率和Bag5的表达，降低细胞活力和miR-15a表达，过表达miR-15a会进一步加强Aβ对细胞增殖和凋亡的效果，而敲减miR-15a的表达则起到相反的作用(均P<0.01)。萤光素酶报告实验证明miR-15a与Bag5存在负向靶向关系。且与单独敲减Bag5相比，敲减miR-15a和Bag5共转染会显著提高细胞活力以及Bag5的表达，同时明显降低细胞的凋亡率以及Bax、Caspase-3的表达，体内实验也得到一致的结果(均P<0.01)。结论: 
Aβ可抑制miR-15a的表达，进而诱导Bag5表达，以激活Bag5对于Aβ引起凋亡的保护作用。.

mRNA and protein levels of Bag5, and significantly reduced the cell apoptosis 
rate and the expression of Bax and Caspase-3, animal studies have also shown 
consistent results.
CONCLUSION: Aβ can inhibit the expression of miR-15a, thereby inducing the 
expression of Bag5 and activating the protective mechanism of Bag5 against Aβ 
induced apoptosis.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive central neurodegenerative disorder 
with an insidious onset. With global aging, the incidence and mortality of AD 
have been steadily increasing, yet effective treatments remain elusive. Obesity, 
characterized by excessive or abnormal fat accumulation, is a complex metabolic 
disorder and a confirmed risk factor for numerous diseases. Both obesity and AD 
have become major public health concerns, posing significant threats to human 
health and economic development. Studies have revealed a strong correlation 
between obesity and AD, with multiple contributing factors, including metabolic 
abnormalities of endocrine factors, inflammatory responses, and genetic 
interactions. Exploring the correlation and mechanisms between obesity and AD 
provides important insights and new strategies for the prevention and treatment 
of AD.

Publisher: 阿尔茨海默病(Alzheimer’s 
disease，AD)是一种起病隐匿的进行性发展的中枢神经退行性疾病。随着人口老龄化，全球AD的发病率和病死率逐年上升，但目前仍没有非常有效的治疗方法。肥胖是一种体内脂肪堆积过多或分布异常的代谢异常性疾病，其病因复杂，已被证实是多种疾病的危险因素。现阶段，AD和肥胖均已成为威胁人类健康和影响经济发展的重大公共卫生问题。研究发现，肥胖与AD的发病密切相关，二者通过内分泌环境因子代谢异常、炎症反应和遗传基因等多种因素相互作用。探究肥胖与AD之间的相关性及作用机制，对未来AD的预防与治疗提供新的思路与方法具有重要的参考意义。.

Alzheimer’s disease is a kind of central nervous degenerative disease with 
hidden onset and progressive development. With the growth of the aging 
population, the global incidence rate and mortality of AD are increasing year by 
year, but there is still no very effective treatment. Obesity is a metabolic 
disorder characterized by excessive accumulation or abnormal distribution of fat 
in the body. Its etiology is complex and has been proven to be a risk factor for 
various diseases.At present, both have become major public health issues that 
threaten human health and affect economic development.Research has found that 
obesity is closely related to the incidence rate of AD, and the two interact 
through a variety of factors and mechanisms such as abnormal metabolism of 
endocrine environmental factors, inflammatory response and genetic genes. 
Exploring the correlation and mechanism between obesity and AD has important 
theoretical reference significance for providing new ideas and methods for the 
prevention and treatment of AD in the future.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) stands as one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative 
disorders, characterized by a progressive decline in cognitive function, 
neuroinflammation, amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles 
(NFTs). With the global aging population, the incidence of AD continues to rise, 
yet current therapeutic strategies remain limited in their ability to 
significantly alleviate cognitive impairments. Therefore, a deeper understanding 
of the molecular mechanisms underlying AD is imperative for the development of 
more effective treatments. In recent years, the transcription factor C/EBPβ has 
emerged as a pivotal regulator in several pathological processes of AD, 
including neuroinflammation, lipid metabolism, Aβ processing, and tau 
phosphorylation. Through intricate post-translational modifications, C/EBPβ 
modulates these processes and may influence the progression of AD on multiple 
fronts. This review systematically explores the multifaceted roles of C/EBPβ in 
the pathogenesis of AD, delving into its crucial involvement in 
neuroinflammation, Aβ production, tau pathology, and lipid metabolism 
dysregulation. Furthermore, we critically assess therapeutic strategies 
targeting C/EBPβ, examining the challenges and opportunities in regulating this 
factor. By synthesizing the latest research findings, we offer a more 
comprehensive understanding of the role of C/EBPβ in AD and discuss its 
potential as a therapeutic intervention target.

The blood-brain barrier (BBB) plays a vital role in protecting the central 
nervous system (CNS) by preventing the entry of harmful pathogens from the 
bloodstream. However, this barrier also presents a significant obstacle when it 
comes to delivering drugs for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and 
brain cancer. Recent breakthroughs in nanotechnology have paved the way for the 
creation of a wide range of nanoparticles (NPs) that can serve as carriers for 
diagnosis and therapy. Regarding their promising properties, organic NPs have 
the potential to be used as effective carriers for drug delivery across the BBB 
based on recent advancements. These remarkable NPs have the ability to penetrate 
the BBB using various mechanisms. This review offers a comprehensive examination 
of the intricate structure and distinct properties of the BBB, emphasizing its 
crucial function in preserving brain balance and regulating the transport of 
ions and molecules. The disruption of the BBB in conditions such as stroke, 
Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease highlights the importance of 
developing creative approaches for delivering drugs. Through the encapsulation 
of therapeutic molecules and the precise targeting of transport processes in the 
brain vasculature, organic NP formulations present a hopeful strategy to improve 
drug transport across the BBB. We explore the changes in properties of the BBB 
in various pathological conditions and investigate the factors that affect the 
successful delivery of organic NPs into the brain. In addition, we explore the 
most promising delivery systems associated with NPs that have shown positive 
results in treating neurodegenerative and ischemic disorders. This review opens 
up new possibilities for nanotechnology-based therapies in cerebral diseases.

Reduced docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) concentrations seem to be associated with an 
increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and DHA accretion to the brain 
across the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) can be modulated by various factors. 
Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify an efficient and non-invasive 
method to ensure brain DHA enrichment. In the present study, a safe and stable 
DHA-enriched nanoemulsion, designed to protect DHA against oxidation, was 
designed and administered intranasally in a transgenic mouse model of AD, the 
J20 mice. Intranasal treatment with nanoformulated DHA significantly improved 
well-being and working spatial memory in six-months-old J20 mice. These 
behavioral effects were associated with a reduction of amyloid deposition, 
oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation in brain tissues, which may be partially 
due to DHA-induced inactivation of the pleiotropic kinase GSK3β. In conclusion, 
intranasal DHA administration exhibited strong therapeutic effects and 
disease-modifying benefits in the J20 AD model. Given that DHA has already shown 
safety and tolerability in healthy human subjects, our results further support 
the need for clinical trials to assess the potential of this approach in 
Alzheimer's patients.

progression of many diseases. In recent years, the antioxidant effects of 
acupuncture have been gradually confirmed. However, bibliometric analysis in 
this field, which is still lacking. This study aimed to explore the current 
state of research and recent trends in the regulating of oxidative stress by 
acupuncture using bibliometric methods.
METHODS: Articles pertaining to the acupuncture antioxidant effects were 
systematically retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection database, 
encompassing the temporal scope from inception to September 6, 2024. Countries, 
publications, authors, co-citations, and keywords were visualized and analyzed 
using CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and R software.
RESULTS: A total of 438 articles have been published in the field, with the 
number increasing yearly. Chinese scholars constitute a significant force in the 
domain of research pertaining to this field. Beijing University of Traditional 
Chinese Medicine is the institution with the highest number of publications. 
Cunzhi Liu (17) is the author with the highest number of publications. The 
journals with the most publications (39) and citations (652) are EVIDENCE-BASED 
COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE. Basic research is the main type of 
research. Both co-cited literature analysis and keyword examination have 
indicated neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's 
disease, and stroke, as prominent research domains. Electroacupuncture is the 
most common intervention. Pain and inflammation may be a trend in research in 
this area.
CONCLUSION: This bibliometric analysis summarises the disease mapping and some 
of the mechanisms of acupuncture's antioxidant effects. Neurological disorders 
such as Parkinson's disease, vascular dementia, and stroke are major research

The contemporary understanding that the immune response significantly supports 
higher brain functions has emphasized the notion that the brain's condition is 
linked in a complex manner to the state of the immune system. It is therefore 
not surprising that immunity is a key factor in shaping brain aging. In this 
perspective article, we propose amending the Latin phrase "mens sana in corpore 
sano" ("a healthy mind in a healthy body") to "a healthy mind in a healthy 
immune system." Briefly, we discuss the emerging understanding of the pivotal 
role of the immune system in supporting lifelong brain maintenance, how the 
aging of the immune system impacts the brain, and how the potential rejuvenation 
of the immune system could, in turn, help revitalize brain function, with the 
ultimate ambitious goal of developing an anti-aging immune therapy.

JNK3, a brain-specific stress-activated protein kinase, plays a critical role in 
Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis through phosphorylation of Tau and APP. This 
study aimed to develop selective JNK3 inhibitors based on a pyrazole scaffold, 
focusing on (E)-1-(2-aminopyrimidin-4-yl)-4-styryl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide 
derivatives. Through systematic structural modifications and extensive SAR 
analysis, we identified compounds 24a and 26a as highly potent JNK3 inhibitors, 
with IC50 values of 12 and 19 nM, respectively. Especially, 24a revealed its 
potent and selective inhibition of JNK3, coupled with inhibition of the GSK3α/β 
kinases involved in Tau phosphorylation. In vitro studies revealed significant 
neuroprotective effects against Aβ1-42-induced toxicity in primary neuronal 
cells and western blot analyses confirmed the compounds' ability to mitigate 
Aβ1-42-induced c-Jun and APP phosphorylation, suggesting a multi-faceted 
approach to neuroprotection. Docking studies validated the retention of optimal 
interactions within the JNK3 binding pocket. Importantly, BBB PAMPA assays and 
ADME predictions indicated favorable blood-brain barrier permeability and 
pharmacokinetic profiles for the lead compounds. These findings represent a 
significant advancement in the development of selective JNK3 inhibitors, 
providing a strong foundation for further preclinical development of potential 
Alzheimer's disease therapeutics.

BACKGROUND: Shenghui Decoction (SHD) is a frequently utilized traditional 
Chinese medicine formula in clinical settings for addressing cognitive 
impairment in elderly individuals. Nevertheless, the precise mechanism by which 
SHD exerts its effects on the most prevalent form of dementia, Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), remains to be elucidated.
METHODS: Temperature-induced transgenic C. elegans assess Aβ deposition and 
toxicity. Behavioral experiments are utilized to assess learning and memory 
capabilities as well as cognitive impairment in APP/PS1 mice. Immunofluorescence 
and immunohistochemistry are employed to identify Aβ deposits, while UHPLCOE/MS 
combine network pharmacology is utilized to characterize chemical composition, 
predict target and analyze the biological processes and signaling pathways 
modulated by SHD. Molecular biology methodologies confirm the functionality of 
regulatory pathways. Molecular docking, molecular dynamic simulations (MD) and 
ultrafiltration-liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) are employed for 
the assessment of the binding interactions between active ingredients of SHD and 
target proteins.
RESULTS: SHD effectively reduced the deposition of Aβ in the head of C. elegans 
and mitigated its toxicity, as well as improved the learning deficits and 
cognitive impairment in APP/PS1 mice. Network pharmacology analyses revealed 
that G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and cell apoptosis are the primary 
biological processes modulated by SHD, with KEEG results indicating that SHD 
regulated the cAMP signaling pathway. Subsequent experimental investigations 
demonstrated that SHD attenuated the loss of neurons in APP/PS1 mice, 
upregulated the expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and downregulated the 
expression of pro-apoptotic proteins like cleave-Caspase-3 both in vivo and in 
vitro. Additionally, SHD decreased intracellular AMP levels while increasing 
cAMP levels, leading to the phosphorylation of PKA to activate CREB. This 
process ultimately regulated the expression of Bcl-2, Bdnf, among others, to 
prevent cell apoptosis and safeguard neurons. Molecular docking, MD, and 
ultrafiltration-LC/MS revealed that the active constituents of SHD formed stable 
interactions with the cAMP hydrolysis enzyme phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B).
CONCLUSION: SHD regulated the cAMP/CREB signaling pathway to inhibit neuronal 
cell apoptosis and improve AD. Furthermore, it is worth noting that this 
mechanism may be associated with the specific and consistent binding of SHD 
active ingredients to PDE4B, potentially offering promising candidates for drug 
development aimed at addressing AD.

Sound and Alzheimer's Disease-From Harmful Noise to Beneficial Soundscape 
Augmentation and Music Therapy.

Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.

Exposure to sound energy may be a risk factor or a therapeutic intervention for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). On one hand, noise has a harmful effect on people with 
AD by contributing to hearing loss, sleep disturbance, oxidative stress, 
inflammation, and excitotoxicity. But on the other hand, clinical trials and 
nursing home interventions with soundscape augmentation involving natural sounds 
have shown promising results in alleviating psychophysiological symptoms in 
people with AD. Music therapy, an emerging non-pharmacological treatment, can 
improve cognition, reduce anxiety and depression, and enhance self-awareness in 
patients with AD. To ensure that music does not become noise in clinical trials, 
only favorite music at levels safe for hearing should be used. From a public 
health standpoint, noise countermeasures, soundscape augmentation with natural 
sounds, and active or passive engagement with music may be regarded as

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most frequent cause of dementia. Since there are 
complex pathophysiological mechanisms behind AD, and there is no effective 
treatment strategy, it is necessary to introduce novel multi-targeting agents 
with fewer side effects and higher efficacy. Polydatin (PD) is a naturally 
occurring resveratrol glucoside employing multiple mechanisms toward 
neuroprotection. In the current study, the anti-AD mechanisms of a novel 
amphiphilic chitosan nanocarrier formulation (ACN) of PD (NPD) were studied. 
After preparing the amphiphilic chitosan nanoformulation (i.e., NPD), 
physicochemical properties were assessed, including particle size, zeta 
potential, drug loading, drug release, MTT, Fourier transform infrared 
spectroscopy (FT-IR), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). For in vivo 
analysis, aluminum chloride (AlCl3) was injected intraperitoneally for 14 days 
to induce AD in male Albino Wistar rats. To examine the anti-AD mechanisms of 
NPD, a total of 36 rats were divided into six groups of six. Behavioral tests, 
including open field, Y-maze, elevated plus maze, and shuttle box were done on 
days 7, 8, 14, and 15. Additionally, zymography, biochemical analysis, and 
histological studies were done. NPD, as a newly synthesized formulation for PD, 
potentially improved memory and cognitive behavioral parameters and reduced the 
activity of inflammatory matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) and serum nitrite 
levels, while increasing anti-inflammatory MMP2, antioxidant catalase, and 
glutathione. NPD also prevented morphological changes and increased neuronal 
survival in the CA2, CA4, and DG regions of the rat hippocampus. In 
conclusion, NPD is a novel formulation against AD through anti-inflammatory, 
antioxidant, and neuroprotective mechanisms.

IMPORTANCE: Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) is a rare, rapidly 
progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disease. Definite sCJD diagnosis can 
only be made post mortem, and little is known about the prodromal phase of the 
disease.
OBJECTIVE: To compare drug prescription patterns before the clinical onset of 
sCJD between patients and matched controls for exploration of potential risk 
factors and to assess correlations between drug exposure and sCJD survival.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective analysis was designed as a 
case-control study, with data collected from January 2013 to December 2020 and 
analyzed in 2023. Follow-up was available until December 2020. Cases were 
collected from the Austrian Reference Centre for Human Prion Diseases, which 
receives all suspected cases at a national level in Austria. The analyses were 
conducted at a single center. Patients with autopsy-confirmed sCJD were linked 
with insurance claims data, and a minimum of 10 control individuals were matched 
by sex, age at onset, and area of residence for each patient with sCJD.
EXPOSURE: Medication prescribed to 10% or more of the cohort with sCJD up to 5 
years before symptom onset or the matching date in the control cohort.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Drug prescription before symptom onset or the 
matching date was compared between patients with sCJD and controls using 
conditional regression, and prescriptions in the cohort with sCJD were assessed 
for correlation with survival using Cox proportional hazard models.
RESULTS: A total of 129 patients with sCJD (median [IQR] age, 68.9 [62.4-75.5] 
years; 67 female [51.9%]) and 1350 controls (median [IQR] age, 69.0 [62.2-75.3] 
years; 700 female [51.9%]) were included. As compared with controls, patients 
with sCJD were found to have significantly higher odds of being prescribed 
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in the year preceding disease 
onset (odds ratio, 2.86; 95% CI, 1.63-4.95; P < .001). SSRI prescription rates 
started to increase 3 years before symptom onset in the cohort with sCJD.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Results of this case-control study provide evidence 
for prodromal mood alterations as early as 3 years before symptom onset in 
patients with sCJD. Although sCJD remains an extremely rare cause of mood 
alterations, increased vigilance for neurodegenerative diseases in this setting 
could eventually help to extend the diagnostic window.

Seizures in people with Alzheimer's disease are increasingly recognized to 
worsen disease burden and accelerate functional decline. Harnessing established 
antiseizure medicine discovery strategies in rodents with Alzheimer's disease 
associated risk genes represents a novel way to uncover disease modifying 
treatments that may benefit these Alzheimer's disease patients. This commentary 
discusses the recent evaluation by Dejakaisaya and colleagues to assess the 
antiseizure and disease-modifying potential of the repurposed cephalosporin 
antibiotic, ceftriaxone, in the Tg2576 mouse model. The use of established 
epilepsy models in Alzheimer's disease research carries the potential to advance 
novel disease-modifying treatments.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease. At present, 
there are currently no drugs that can cure AD.
OBJECTIVE: A number of empirical studies have shown that transcranial direct 
current stimulation (tDCS) may be used to treat cognitive abnormalities in 
patients with AD. We will through meta-analysis reviews tDCS overall research on 
the effects of cognitive function in patients with AD.
METHODS: Systematic searches were performed in the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane 
Library databases from their creation until 8 March 2024. Using a fixed effect 
model and random effect model to evaluate the average difference between the 
treatment group and control group (MD) and its 95% confidence interval (CI).
RESULTS: The study included 10 randomized controlled trials (Nactive = 165, 
Nsham = 167). The results of the overall analysis showed that tDCS did not 
significantly improve the overall cognitive function (SMD = 0.17; 95%CI = -0.05, 
0.39; p = 0.14; I² = 51%). Quality of life of AD patients after treatment was 
also evaluated, but no improvement was seen. Subgroup analysis showed no 
significant improvement in global cognitive function after tDCS treatment. The 
sensitivity analysis to confirm the reliability of the data, risk assessment did 
not find any high-risk projects.
CONCLUSIONS: The tDCS treatment did not improve cognitive function in patients 
with AD. Further empirical research in the future will help to explore new 
schemes for tDCS to improve cognitive function of patients.

Imaging abnormal copper/iron with effective fluorescent tools is essential to 
comprehensively put insight into many pathological events. However, conventional 
coordination-based detection is mired in the fluorescence quenching induced by 
paramagnetic Cu(II)/Fe(III). Moreover, the strong chelating property of the 
probe will consume dissociative metal ions and inevitably interfere with the 
physiological microenvironment. Here, a new strategy is developed by employing 
this aberrant Cu(II)/Fe(III) to catalyze bond cleavage for fluorescent imaging 
of them. A short series of near-infrared fluorescent molecules (NIRB1-NIRB6) is 
devised as substrates, wherein the specific C═C bonds can be effectively cleaved 
to activate red fluorophore by Cu(II)/Fe(III) catalyzing. Representatively, 
NIRB1 is applied for fluorescent imaging of Cu(II)/Fe(III) in living cells, 
zebrafish, and Alzheimer's disease (AD)-afflicted mouse brains which is of 
significance to monitor metal safety. The successful cleavage of C═C bonds 
catalyzed by Cu(II)/Fe(III) enriches the application of abiotic bond cleavage 
reactions in metal detection, and may also inspire the development of 
fluorescent tools for the future diagnosis and therapy of diseases.

INTRODUCTION: Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT), along with the apolipoprotein E 
(APOE) ε4 allele, has been suggested as a possible risk factor for Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). However, the relationship between MHT and cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) biomarkers is unknown: we investigated this association, and whether APOE 
ε4 carrier status moderates it.
METHODS: In an observational study of 136 cognitively unimpaired female 
participants (Mage = 66.0; standard deviation = 6.3), we examined whether MHT 
use alone or in interaction with APOE ε4 carrier status was associated with CSF 
levels of phosphorylated tau (p-tau), amyloid beta (Aβ)40, Aβ42, p-tau/Aβ42, and 
Aβ42/40 ratios.
RESULTS: Significant interactions were found between APOE ε4 and MHT use for CSF 
biomarkers. APOE ε4 carriers who were MHT users showed worse levels of CSF 
p-tau/Aβ42 and Aβ42/40 ratios than all other users and non-users.
DISCUSSION: The presence of both APOE ε4 and MHT may be associated with elevated 
amyloid deposition and AD pathology in this sample of participants who 
demonstrated high familial AD risk.
HIGHLIGHTS: Significant interactions were found between apolipoprotein E (APOE) 
ε4 and menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) use for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
phosphorylated tau (p-tau)/amyloid beta (Aβ)42 and Aβ42/40 ratios. APOE ε4 
carriers who were MHT users showed worse levels of CSF biomarkers than non-users 
and non-carriers, both users and non-users. Younger age at MHT initiation was 
associated with worse levels of the p-tau/Aβ42 and Aβ42/40 ratios in carriers 
only. The presence of both APOE ε4 carriage and MHT use may be associated with 
elevated amyloid deposition and AD pathology. Further studies with larger sample 
sizes are necessary to confirm the differences observed in the current study.

Scutellarein, a flavone found in the perennial herb Scutellaria baicalensis, has 
a wide range of pharmacological actions, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, 
and neuroprotective. Increasing evidence has emphasized the developing 
significance of scutellarein in several neurological illnesses, such as 
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, cerebral ischemia, and neuroblastoma. This 
review is centered on the molecular processes that underlie the neuroprotective 
properties of scutellarein in various neurological disorders, as indicated by 
recent pre-clinical research. Furthermore, it critically examines the potential 
challenges and advantages of scutellarein inclusion within the range of 
treatments for neurological disorders.

Amyloid beta (Aβ) dyshomeostasis is considered the main biological aberration in 
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathology. The interplay between Aβ formation and 
clearance is predominantly modulated by a disintegrin and a metalloproteinase 10 
(ADAM10, α-secretase) and β-site APP Cleaving Enzyme 1 (BACE1), the two pivotal 
enzymes in both non-amyloidogenic/amyloidogenic and amyloidolytic pathways. 
Emerging evidence suggests that aberrations in ADAM10 and BACE1 expression, 
activity, and function in the brain of AD patients also manifest in peripheral 
fluids, suggesting their potential as blood-based biomarkers for AD diagnosis. 
This review provides a comprehensive overview of the literature by exploring the 
roles of ADAM10 and BACE1 in AD, spanning from their involvement as pathological 
AD drivers to their potential utility as promising biomarkers.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative illnesses place a heavy 
strain on the world's healthcare systems, particularly among the aging 
population. With a focus on research from January 2022 to September 2023, this 
scoping review, which adheres to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
Reviews and Meta-Analysis extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-Scr) criteria, 
examines the changing landscape of artificial intelligence (AI) applications for 
early AD detection and diagnosis. Forty-four carefully chosen articles were 
selected from a pool of 2,966 articles for the qualitative synthesis. The 
research reveals impressive advancements in AI-driven approaches, including 
neuroimaging, genomics, cognitive tests, and blood-based biomarkers. Notably, AI 
models focusing on deep learning (DL) algorithms demonstrate outstanding 
accuracy in early AD identification, often even before the onset of clinical 
symptoms. Multimodal approaches, which combine information from various sources, 
including neuroimaging and clinical assessments, provide comprehensive insights 
into the complex nature of AD. The study also emphasizes the critical role that 
blood-based and genetic biomarkers play in strengthening AD diagnosis and risk 
assessment. When combined with clinical or imaging data, genetic variations and 
polygenic risk scores help to improve prediction models. In a similar vein, 
blood-based biomarkers provide non-invasive instruments for detecting metabolic 
changes linked to AD. Cognitive and functional evaluations, which include 
neuropsychological examinations and assessments of daily living activities, 
serve as essential benchmarks for monitoring the course of AD and directing 
treatment interventions. When these evaluations are included in machine learning 
models, the diagnosis accuracy is improved, and treatment monitoring is made 
more accessible. In addition, including methods that support model 
interpretability and explainability helps in the thorough understanding and 
valuable implementation of AI-driven insights in clinical contexts. This review 
further identifies several gaps in the research landscape, including the need 
for diverse, high-quality datasets to address data heterogeneity and improve 
model generalizability. Practical implementation challenges, such as integrating 
AI systems into clinical workflows and clinician adoption, are highlighted as 
critical barriers to real-world application. Moreover, ethical considerations, 
particularly surrounding data privacy and informed consent, must be prioritized 
as AI adoption in healthcare accelerates. Performance metrics (e.g., 
sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC)) for AI-based 
approaches are discussed, with a need for clearer reporting and comparative 
analyses. Addressing these limitations, alongside methodological clarity and 
critical evaluation of biases, would strengthen the credibility of AI 
applications in AD detection. By expanding its scope, this study highlights 
areas for improvement and future opportunities in early detection, aiming to 
bridge the gap between innovative AI technologies and practical clinical 
utility.

INTRODUCTION: Neighborhood disadvantage may be an important determinant of 
cardiometabolic health and cognitive aging. However, less is known about 
relationships among individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
METHODS: The objective of this study is to investigate the relationship between 
neighborhood disadvantage measured by national Area Deprivation Index (ADI) rank 
with measures of cardiometabolic health and cognition among Wake Forest (WF) 
Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) participants, with and without MCI.
RESULTS: ADI was positively associated with blood pressure and cardiometabolic 
index (CMI), and negatively associated with global and Preclinical Alzheimer's 
Cognitive Composite (PACC5) scores, in cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals. 
ADI was only positively associated with hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in MCI.
DISCUSSION: Neighborhood disadvantage is associated more strongly with measures 
of cardiometabolic health and cognition among CU individuals rather than MCI. 
These findings demonstrate a need for structural solutions to address social 
determinants of health in an attempt to reduce cardiometabolic and cognitive 
risks.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent and progressive neurodegenerative 
disorder that is the leading cause of dementia. The underlying mechanisms of AD 
have not yet been completely explored. Neuroinflammation, an inflammatory 
response mediated by certain mediators, has been exhibited to play a crucial 
role in the pathogenesis of AD. Additionally, disruption of the gut microbiota 
has been found to be associated with AD, and fecal microbiota transplantation 
(FMT) has emerged as a potential therapeutic approach. However, the precise 
mechanism of FMT in the treatment of AD remains elusive. In this study, FMT was 
performed by transplanting fecal microbiota from healthy wild-type mice into 
APP/PS1 mice (APPswe, PSEN1dE9) to assess the effectiveness of FMT in mitigating 
AD-associated inflammation and to reveal its precise mechanism of action. The 
results demonstrated that FMT treatment improved cognitive function and reduced 
the expression levels of inflammatory factors by regulating the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB 
signaling pathway in mice, which was accompanied by the restoration of gut 
microbial dysbiosis. These findings suggest that FMT has the potential to 
ameliorate AD symptoms and delay the disease progression in APP/PS1 mice.

BACKGROUND: Disease-modifying therapies targeting the diverse pathophysiology of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), including neuroinflammation, represent potentially 
important and novel approaches. The glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist 
semaglutide is approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity and has 
an established safety profile. Semaglutide may have a disease-modifying, 
neuroprotective effect in AD through multimodal mechanisms including 
neuroinflammatory, vascular, and other AD-related processes. Large randomized 
controlled trials are needed to assess the efficacy and safety of semaglutide in 
early-stage symptomatic AD.
METHODS: evoke and evoke+ are randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 
3 trials investigating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of once-daily oral 
semaglutide versus placebo in early-stage symptomatic AD. Eligible participants 
were men or women aged 55-85 years with mild cognitive impairment or mild 
dementia due to AD with confirmed amyloid abnormalities (assessed by positron 
emission tomography or cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] analysis). After a maximum 
12-week screening phase, an anticipated 1840 patients in each trial are 
randomized (1:1) to semaglutide or placebo for 156 weeks (104-week main 
treatment phase and 52-week extension). Randomized participants follow an 8-week 
dose escalation regimen (3 mg [weeks 0-4], 7 mg [weeks 4-8], and 14 mg [weeks 
8-156]). The primary endpoint is the semaglutide-placebo difference on change 
from baseline to week 104 in the Clinical Dementia Rating - Sum of Boxes score. 
Analyses of plasma biomarkers, collected from all participants, and a CSF 
sub-study (planned n = 210) will explore semaglutide effects on AD biomarkers 
and neuroinflammation.
RESULTS: Enrollment was undertaken between May 18, 2021, and September 8, 2023. 
Completion of the trials' main phase is expected in September 2025, and the 
52-week extension (in which participants and investigators remain blinded to 
treatment assignment) will continue to October 2026.
CONCLUSION: evoke and evoke+ are the first large-scale trials to investigate the 
disease-modifying potential of semaglutide in participants with early-stage 
symptomatic AD, including exploration of effects on AD biomarkers and 
neuroinflammation. The trials will provide data on the potential 
disease-modifying effects of semaglutide and will be important in evaluating its 
utility in the treatment of early-stage symptomatic AD.

BACKGROUND: The safety data of lecanemab in the post-marketing period has yet to 
be fully investigated in the current literature. We aimed to identify and 
characterise the safety profile of lecanemab in the post-marketing period.
METHODS: We searched and reviewed the reports submitted to the FDA's Adverse 
Event Reporting System (FAERS). We used a case/non-case approach to estimate the 
reporting odds ratio (ROR) and information component (IC) with 95% confidence 
intervals (CI) for lecanemab-related adverse events (AEs) reported at least four 
counts. We compared the difference between serious and non-serious reports using 
non-parametric tests.
RESULTS: The FAERS recorded 1,986 lecanemab-related AEs affecting 868 patients. 
Two hundred and three patients experienced serious AEs, including 22 deaths. The 
most frequently reported AEs were headache (n = 193), chills (n = 100), fatigue 
(n = 93), and amyloid-related imaging abnormality-oedema/effusion (ARIA-E) 
(n = 91). Safety signals were detected, such as headache (ROR: 10.4, 95%CI: 
8.97, 12.07; IC: 3.25, 95%CI: 2.97, 3.40), ARIA-E (ROR: 18,299.69, 95%CI: 
14,001.27, 23,917.73; IC: 13.37, 95%CI: 6.15, 6.87), and infusion-related 
reaction (ROR: 35.25, 95CI 27.58, 45.07; IC: 5.09, 95CI 4.15, 4.87). We also 
identified several new AEs, such as migraine and pancreatic carcinoma. Patients 
with serious AEs were more likely to be on polypharmacy for Alzheimer's disease 
and use aspirin, acid-suppressing medications, statins, antidepressants, or 
benzodiazepines compared to those with non-serious AEs.
CONCLUSIONS: Lecanemab may have a significant potential for AEs. Our results 
provide evidence for healthcare professionals and patients to weigh the risks 
and benefits of lecanemab treatment. Further prospective studies are needed to 
explore rare and unexpected AEs.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder 
worldwide, and microglia are thought to play a central role in neuroinflammatory 
events occurring in AD. Chemerin, an adipokine, has been implicated in 
inflammatory diseases and central nervous system disorders, yet its precise 
function on microglial response in AD remains unknown.
METHODS: The APP/PS1 mice were treated with different dosages of chemerin-9 (30 
and 60 µg/kg), a bioactive nonapeptide derived from chemerin, every other day 
for 8 weeks consecutively. The primary mouse microglia were stimulated by 
amyloid beta 42 (Aβ42) oligomers followed by treatment with chemerin-9 in vitro. 
ChemR23 inhibitor α-NETA was further used to investigate whether the effects of 
chemerin-9 were ChemR23-dependent.
RESULTS: We found that the expression of chemerin and ChemR23 was increased in 
AD. Intriguingly, treatment with chemerin-9 significantly ameliorated Aβ 
deposition and cognitive impairment of the APP/PS1 mice, with decreased 
microglial proinflammatory activity and increased phagocytic activity. 
Similarly, chemerin-9-treated primary microglia showed increased phagocytic 
ability and decreased NLRP3 inflammasome activation. However, the ChemR23 
inhibitor α-NETA abolished the neuroprotective microglial response of 
chemerin-9.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our data demonstrate that chemerin-9 ameliorates 
cognitive deficits in APP/PS1 transgenic mice by boosting a neuroprotective 
microglial phenotype.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major neurodegenerative disorder with 
significant environmental factors, including diet and lifestyle, influencing its 
onset and progression. Although previous studies have suggested that certain 
diets may reduce the incidence of AD, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.
METHOD: In this post-hoc analysis of a randomized crossover study of 20 elderly 
adults, we investigated the effects of a modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet 
(MMKD) on the plasma lipidome in the context of AD biomarkers, analyzing 784 
lipid species across 47 classes using a targeted lipidomics platform.
RESULTS: Here we identified substantial changes in response to MMKD 
intervention, aside from metabolic changes associated with a ketogenic diet, we 
identified a a global elevation across all plasmanyl and plasmenyl ether lipid 
species, with many changes linked to clinical and biochemical markers of AD. We 
further validated our findings by leveraging our prior clinical studies into 
lipid related changeswith AD (n = 1912), and found that the lipidomic signature 
with MMKD was inversely associated with the lipidomic signature of prevalent and 
incident AD.
CONCLUSIONS: Intervention with a MMKD was able to alter the plasma lipidome in 
ways that contrast with AD-associated patterns. Given its low risk and cost, 
MMKD could be a promising approach for prevention or early symptomatic treatment 
of AD.

Plain Language Summary: Previous research has suggested that different diets 
might alter the risk of a person developing Alzheimer’s disease. We compared the 
blood of 20 older adults, some with memory impairment, following a change in 
diet. The two diets we compared were the Modified Mediterranean Ketogenic and 
American Heart Association Diets. The changes that were seen following 
consumption of the Mediterranean-ketogenic diet were the opposite to those 
typically seen in people with Alzheimer’s disease or those likely to develop it. 
These data suggest adopting this diet could potentially be a promising approach 
to slow down or prevent the development of Alzheimer’s disease. Aligning these 
results with previous larger clinical studies looking at lipids, we identified 
that these changes were opposite to what was typically seen in people with 
Alzheimer’s disease or those likely to develop it. As this diet was generally 
safe and inexpensive, this intervention could be a promising approach to 
mitigate some risk Alzheimer’s disease and help with early symptoms.

OBJECTIVE: To summarise available evidence on time to nursing home admission and 
death among people with dementia, and to explore prognostic indicators.
DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis.
DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane, and Google Scholar from 
inception to 4 July 2024.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: Longitudinal studies on survival or 
nursing home admission in people with dementia. Studies with fewer than 150 
participants, recruitment during acute hospital admission, or less than one year 
of follow-up were excluded.
RESULTS: 19 307 articles were identified and 261 eligible studies included. 235 
reported on survival among 5 553 960 participants and 79 reported on nursing 
home admission among 352 990 participants. Median survival from diagnosis 
appeared to be strongly dependent on age, ranging from 8.9 years at mean age 60 
for women to 2.2 years at mean age 85 for men. Women overall had shorter 
survival than men (mean difference 4.1 years (95% confidence interval 2.1 to 
6.1)), which was attributable to later age at diagnosis in women. Median 
survival was 1.2 to 1.4 years longer in Asia than in the US and Europe, and 1.4 
years longer for Alzheimer's disease compared with other types of dementia. 
Compared with studies before 2000, survival was longer in contemporary clinic 
based studies (Ptrend=0.02), but not in community based studies. Taken together, 
variation in reported clinical characteristics and study methodology explained 
51% of heterogeneity in survival. Median time to nursing home admission was 3.3 
years (interquartile range 1.9 to 4.0). 13% of people were admitted in the first 
year after diagnosis, increasing to 57% at five years, but few studies 
appropriately accounted for competing mortality risk when assessing admission 
rates.
CONCLUSIONS: The average life expectancy of people with dementia at time of 
diagnosis ranged from 5.7 years at age 65 to 2.2 at age 85 in men and from 8.0 
to 4.5, respectively, in women. About one third of remaining life expectancy was 
lived in nursing homes, with more than half of people moving to a nursing home 
within five years after a dementia diagnosis. Prognosis after a dementia 
diagnosis is highly dependent on personal and clinical characteristics, offering 
potential for individualised prognostic information and care planning.

The Alzheimer's Association and the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular 
Imaging convened a multidisciplinary workgroup to update appropriate use 
criteria (AUC) for amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) and to develop AUC 
for tau PET. Methods: The workgroup identified key research questions that 
guided a systematic literature review on clinical amyloid/tau PET. Building on 
this review, the workgroup developed 17 clinical scenarios in which amyloid or 
tau PET may be considered. A modified Delphi approach was used to rate each 
scenario by consensus as "rarely appropriate," "uncertain," or "appropriate." 
Ratings were performed separately for amyloid and tau PET as stand-alone 
modalities. Results: For amyloid PET, 7 scenarios were rated as appropriate, 2 
as uncertain, and 8 as rarely appropriate. For tau PET, 5 scenarios were rated 
as appropriate, 6 as uncertain, and 6 as rarely appropriate. Conclusion: AUC for 
amyloid and tau PET provide expert recommendations for clinical use of these 
technologies in the evolving landscape of diagnostics and therapeutics for 
Alzheimer's disease.

Non-pharmacologic interventions are effective for persons showing mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). We used activation likelihood 
estimation (ALE) meta-analysis to systematically quantify the results of 19 
neuroimaging studies in order to identify brain regions in which patients showed 
stable increases or decreases in activation after interventions. We also tested 
the moderating effects of disease stage (MCI vs. AD) and intervention modality 
(cognitive training vs. exercise intervention). The results showed increased 
activation in the cuneus, precuneus and medial frontal gyrus in the combined 
groups after treatment, whereas the anterior cingulate gyrus showed decreased 
activation. Secondly, in the MCI group there was increased activation in the 
precuneus and precentral gyrus after treatment, whereas there was decreased 
activation in the anterior cingulate gyrus; in the AD group there was only 
increased activation after treatment, including in the lingual gyrus and 
bilateral superior temporal gyrus. Finally, the bilateral cuneus and precentral 
gyrus showed increased activation after cognitive training, while bilateral 
insula, among others, showed decreased activation. This suggests that there are 
brain activation changes after non-pharmacological treatments for MCI and AD 
patients, but that the treatment mechanisms are moderated by stage and 
intervention modality. Future studies could continue to explore specific neural 
mechanisms involved in different intervention conditions for these patients.

In recent years, the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases, including 
Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis, has exhibited a steadily rising trend, which has posed a 
major challenge to the global public health. Traditional Chinese medicine, with 
its multicomponent and multitarget characteristics, offers a promising approach 
to treating neurodegenerative diseases. However, comprehensively elucidating the 
complex mechanisms underlying traditional Chinese medicine formulations remains 
challenging. As an emerging systems biology method, network pharmacology has 
provided a vital tool for revealing the multitarget mechanisms of traditional 
Chinese medicine through high-throughput technologies, molecular docking, and 
network analysis. This paper reviews the advancements in the application of 
network pharmacology in treating neurodegenerative diseases using traditional 
Chinese medicine, analyzes the current status of relevant databases and 
technological methods, discusses the limitations, and proposes future directions 
to promote the modernization of traditional Chinese medicine and the development 
of precision medicine.

BACKGROUND: Ginkgo biloba leaf extract EGb 761® has shown clinical efficacy in 
patients with mild cognitive impairment and dementia. However, the 
pharmacological action of EGb 761® in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unclear 
and molecular mechanisms targeted in the brain are not completely understood.
HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE: We aimed to investigate 1) the potential sex-dependent 
effects of oral administration of EGb 761® in 5xFAD mice, an AD mouse model, and 
2) the underlying microglial subtype responsible for the observed 
anti-inflammatory effects in the brain.
METHODS: Eight-week old 5xFAD and wild type mice received EGb 761®-supplemented 
diet or control diet for eight weeks. The study investigated changes in 
cognitive function as well as amyloid plaque load, expression of AD-related 
genes, and anti-inflammatory effects. Moreover, we used organotypic brain slices 
for confirmation and assessment of concentration-dependency of the observed EGb 
761® effects and performed single cell RNA sequencing on the prefrontal cortex 
of male mice with focus on microglia.
RESULTS: We demonstrate that EGb 761® treatment improves cognitive function in 
5xFAD mice in several behavioral tests. Analysis of the brain tissue from these 
animals indicated a reduction in amyloid plaque load in the prefrontal cortex 
(PFC). This brain area was further investigated to assess the molecular changes 
that occurred following EGb 761® intake. Alterations in the expression of genes 
related to AD were highly sex-specific with effects on the cholinergic system, 
the γ-secretase complex, and neuroinflammation. Anti-inflammatory effects of EGb 
761® with a particularly pronounced reduction of the TNFα-response could be 
shown for the PFC but also peripherally in the serum of 5xFAD mice of both 
sexes. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that EGb761® mainly affected 
disease-associated microglia stage 2 (DAM2), which are thought to have a 
detrimental role in AD.
CONCLUSIONS: EGb 761® shows efficacy in the treatment of cognitive deficits in 
the 5xFAD mouse model via multimodal activity, including sex-specific and 
sex-unrelated mechanisms including the normalization of neuroinflammatory 
parameters.

Designing a Multimodal and Culturally Relevant Alzheimer Disease and Related 
Dementia Generative Artificial Intelligence Tool for Black American Informal 
Caregivers: Cognitive Walk-Through Usability Study.

BACKGROUND: Many members of Black American communities, faced with the high 
prevalence of Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRD) within their 
demographic, find themselves taking on the role of informal caregivers. Despite 
being the primary individuals responsible for the care of individuals with ADRD, 
these caregivers often lack sufficient knowledge about ADRD-related health 
literacy and feel ill-prepared for their caregiving responsibilities. Generative 
AI has become a new promising technological innovation in the health care 
domain, particularly for improving health literacy; however, some generative AI 
developments might lead to increased bias and potential harm toward Black 
American communities. Therefore, rigorous development of generative AI tools to 
support the Black American community is needed.
OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to test Lola, a multimodal mobile app, 
which, by relying on generative AI, facilitates access to ADRD-related health 
information by enabling speech and text as inputs and providing auditory, 
textual, and visual outputs.
METHODS: To test our mobile app, we used the cognitive walk-through methodology, 
and we recruited 15 informal ADRD caregivers who were older than 50 years and 
part of the Black American community living within the region. We asked them to 
perform 3 tasks on the mobile app (ie, searching for an article on brain health, 
searching for local events, and finally, searching for opportunities to 
participate in scientific research in their area), then we recorded their 
opinions and impressions. The main aspects to be evaluated were the mobile app's 
usability, accessibility, cultural relevance, and adoption.
RESULTS: Our findings highlight the users' need for a system that enables 
interaction with different modalities, the need for a system that can provide 
personalized and culturally and contextually relevant information, and the role 
of community and physical spaces in increasing the use of Lola.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that, when designing for Black American older 
adults, a multimodal interaction with the generative AI system can allow 
individuals to choose their own interaction way and style based upon their 
interaction preferences and external constraints. This flexibility of 
interaction modes can guarantee an inclusive and engaging generative AI 
experience.

INTRODUCTION: Sarcopenia, with its complex diagnostic process, is a likely 
independent predictor of poor prognosis in patients with Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). However, research on the clinical characteristics and biomarkers of AD 
patients with sarcopenia (ADSA) is limited.
METHODS: This study included 180 ADSA and 188 AD patients without sarcopenia 
(ADNSA), and evaluated demographics, cognitive function, motor capacity, 
emotional state, and daily living abilities.
RESULTS: ADSA patients were older, with worse motor and cognitive functions, 
more severe depression, poorer social functioning, and lower daily living 
abilities compared to ADNSA patients. Multivariate regression identified age, 
low Frailty Rating Scale (FRS) scores, low serum albumin level, and low 
creatinine/cystatin C ratio (CCR) as risk factors for sarcopenia. A nomogram 
model based on these indicators demonstrated high discriminative power and 
clinical utility.
DISCUSSION: Sarcopenia significantly affects AD patients' various functions. The 
nomogram model aids in the early detection of and personalized interventions for 
sarcopenia in AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: Sarcopenia is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the 
coexistence of sarcopenia affects various functions and quality of life in 
patients with AD. Serum albumin and Frailty Rating Scale (FRS) scores are 
significantly associated with both sarcopenia and cognitive assessment 
indicators in AD patients with sarcopenia (ADSA). The combined sarcopenia 
nomogram model with indexes of age at diagnosis, creatinine/cystatin C ratio 
(CCR), FRS score, and albumin levels can aid in effectively identifying and 
personalizing interventions for sarcopenia in the AD population.

BACKGROUND: Dementia, a rapidly growing cognitive disorder, has a profound 
impact on the lives of individuals and their caregivers across the globe. 
Digital life storybooks have emerged as a promising non-pharmacological 
intervention to improve the wellbeing of people living with dementia (PLWD).
OBJECTIVES: This study aims to investigate the feasibility of developing and 
applying a digital life storybook for PLWD using telehealth, while evaluating 
its impact on communication skills, quality of life (QoL) and satisfaction 
levels.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A mixed-method study design will be employed, involving 
pairs of PLWD and their primary caregivers (dyads) recruited from a teaching 
hospital and a non-profit organization in Malaysia. The intervention involves 
the creation and use of a digital life storybook facilitated remotely via 
telehealth channels. Data will be collected at 6 points in time: prior to the 
commencement of development, prior to the submission of an application, on a 
biweekly basis, and at the conclusion of the assessment period. Quantitative 
measures will include the Holden Communication Scale, Quality of 
Life-Alzheimer's Disease Scale (QoL-AD) and Quality of the Caregiving 
Relationship (QCPR) questionnaire. Qualitative data will be gathered through 
validated open-ended questions.
RESULTS: Implications of the study include facilitating future research, 
contributing to person-centered care practices, and providing caregivers with 
tools to better understand and connect with PLWD. The findings will contribute 
to the understanding of the mechanisms through which digital life storybooks can 
benefit PLWD and their caregivers.
CONCLUSION: The successful implementation of this protocol could have 
significant implications for dementia care in both formal and informal settings, 
and could ultimately improve the lives of those affected by dementia.

INTRODUCTION: We integrated plasma biomarkers from the Taiwan Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and propose a workflow to identify individuals 
showing amyloid-positive positron emission tomography (PET) with 
low/intermediate tau burden based on [18F]Florzolotau PET-based quantification.
METHODS: We assessed 361 participants across the Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 
non-AD continuum and measured plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau)217, p-tau181, 
amyloid beta (Aβ)42/40 ratio, neurofilament light chain, and glial fibrillary 
acidic protein levels at two medical centers. We evaluated the diagnostic 
potential of these biomarkers.
RESULTS: Among all plasma biomarkers, p-tau217 had the highest consistency with 
amyloid PET results (area under the curve = 0.94), and a cutoff value could have 
reduced the number of confirmatory amyloid PET scans by 57.5%. In amyloid 
PET-positive cases intending to use anti-amyloid therapy, p-tau217 level, along 
with clinical parameters, had the highest predictive ability for 
low/intermediate tau burden.
DISCUSSION: A two-step workflow based on p-tau217 and confirmatory amyloid PET 
could accurately classify AD patients showing low/intermediate tau burden.
HIGHLIGHTS: The emergence of anti-amyloid therapy increases the need to 
accurately diagnose Alzheimer's disease (AD). The use of plasma biomarkers, 
especially phosphorylated tau 217 (p-tau217), can help in the diagnosis of AD. 
P-tau217 is a better predictor of amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) 
positivity than other core biomarkers. In amyloid PET-positive individuals, 
p-tau217 can predict tau burden. We propose a two-step workflow to identify AD 
cases suitable for treatment.

Long COVID (also known as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection [PASC] or 
post-COVID syndrome) is characterized by persistent symptoms that extend beyond 
the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, affecting approximately 10% to over 30% 
of those infected. It presents a significant clinical challenge, notably due to 
pronounced neurocognitive symptoms such as brain fog. The mechanisms underlying 
these effects are multifactorial, with mounting evidence pointing to a central 
role of cerebromicrovascular dysfunction. This review investigates key 
pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to cerebrovascular dysfunction in 
long COVID and their impacts on brain health. We discuss how endothelial tropism 
of SARS-CoV-2 and direct vascular infection trigger endothelial dysfunction, 
impaired neurovascular coupling, and blood-brain barrier disruption, resulting 
in compromised cerebral perfusion. Furthermore, the infection appears to induce 
mitochondrial dysfunction, enhancing oxidative stress and inflammation within 
cerebral endothelial cells. Autoantibody formation following infection also 
potentially exacerbates neurovascular injury, contributing to chronic vascular 
inflammation and ongoing blood-brain barrier compromise. These factors 
collectively contribute to the emergence of white matter hyperintensities, 
promote amyloid pathology, and may accelerate neurodegenerative processes, 
including Alzheimer's disease. This review also emphasizes the critical role of 
advanced imaging techniques in assessing cerebromicrovascular health and the 
need for targeted interventions to address these cerebrovascular complications. 
A deeper understanding of the cerebrovascular mechanisms of long COVID is 
essential to advance targeted treatments and mitigate its long-term 
neurocognitive consequences.

Background: Disrupted hippocampal functions and progressive neuronal loss 
represent significant challenges in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
How to achieve the improvement of pathological progression and effective neural 
regeneration to ameliorate the intracerebral dysfunctional environment and 
cognitive impairment is the goal of the current AD therapy. Methods: We examined 
the therapeutic potential of clinical-grade human derived dental pulp stem cells 
(hDPSCs) in cognitive function and neuropathology in AD. Specifically, we 
investigated the effect of neural crest-specific derived hDPSCs on endogenous 
neural regeneration and long-term efficacy following a single transplantation in 
the triple-transgenic mouse model (3xTg-AD). Results: Our research demonstrated 
that a single administration of clinical-grade hDPSCs yielded dramatic 
short-term therapeutic benefits (5 weeks) and sustained partial efficacy (6 
months) with respect to improving cognitive impairment and delaying typical 
pathological progression in 3xTg-AD mice. Intriguingly, exogenous hDPSCs were 
robustly self-differentiated into newborn functional neurons in the hippocampus 
of 3xTg-AD mice. The foremost evidence is provided that hDPSCs promote endogenic 
neural regeneration by enhancing the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, 
which may contribute to stabilizing the hippocampal neural network to reverse 
memory deficits. Conclusion: These findings highlight the multifunctional 
potential of hDPSCs in AD treatment, which enhances cognition through 
alleviating neuropathology and providing neural regenerative driving force. 
Understanding these multiplicity effects is critical to advancing the clinical 
translation of stem cell-based therapies for AD.

Leaky Gut Syndrome Along With Clostridium perfringens Bacteremia in a 
Neurodegenerative Disease Patient: A Case Report.

Leaky gut syndrome (LGS) is caused by intestinal epithelial injury and increased 
intestinal permeability due to a variety of factors, including chronic stress, 
inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, surgery, and chemotherapy, resulting in an 
increased influx of matter from the intestinal lumen causing constipation and 
bacteremia. To our knowledge, this is the first known case of LGS along with 
Clostridium perfringens (C. perfringens) bacteremia in a neurodegenerative 
disease patient. The patient was an 81-year-old male with a history of 
Alzheimer's disease, cerebral infarction, and diverticulitis in a psychiatric 
hospital, fed via a nasogastric tube. During hospitalization, he developed a 
37.4℃ temperature and disturbance of consciousness evaluated as 3 points on the 
Glasgow Coma Scale. A follow-up blood examination revealed a white blood cell 
count of 29,000/µL and a C-reactive protein value of 11.2 mg/dL. Computed 
tomography revealed an increased concentration of peripheral adipose tissue from 
the sigmoid colon to the rectum and significant quantities of stool in the 
rectum. Treatment was initiated with doripenem (DRPM) for sepsis of unknown 
focus. C. perfringens was subsequently identified in both two blood culture 
tests. He improved with decreased inflammatory response; DRPM was terminated 
after 14 days. He remains free of recurrence. We speculate that the LGS in this 
case may have developed from dopaminergic neuronal decrease and impaired amino 
acid metabolism caused by chronic hypo-inflammation due to neurodegenerative 
disease (Alzheimer's disease). We report the first known case of LGS along with 
C. perfringens bacteremia in a neurodegenerative disease patient.

Mitochondrial dysfunction is a common feature of brain disorders. Mitochondria 
play a central role in oxidative phosphorylation; thus changes in energy 
metabolism in the brain have been reported in conditions such as Alzheimer's 
disease, Parkinson's disease, and stroke. In addition, mitochondria regulate 
cellular responses associated with neuronal damage such as the production of 
reactive oxygen species (ROS), opening of the mitochondrial permeability 
transition pore (mPTP), and apoptosis. Therefore, interventions that aim to 
protect mitochondria may be effective against brain disorders. Fucoxanthin is a 
marine carotenoid that has recently gained recognition for its neuroprotective 
properties. However, the cellular mechanisms of fucoxanthin in brain disorders, 
particularly its role in mitochondrial function, have not been thoroughly 
discussed. This review summarises the current literature on the effects of 
fucoxanthin on oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and apoptosis using in vitro 
and in vivo models of brain disorders. We further present the potential 
mechanisms by which fucoxanthin protects mitochondria, with the objective of 
developing dietary interventions for a spectrum of brain disorders. Although the 
studies reviewed are predominantly preclinical studies, they provide important 
insights into understanding the cellular and molecular functions of fucoxanthin 
in the brain. Future studies investigating the mechanisms of action and the 
molecular targets of fucoxanthin are warranted to develop translational 
approaches to brain disorders.

Aging rhesus macaques provide a unique model for learning how age and 
inflammation drive early-stage pathology in sporadic Alzheimer's disease, and 
for testing potential therapeutics. Unlike mice, aging macaques have extensive 
association cortices and inflammatory signaling similar to humans, are 
apolipoprotein E ε4 homozygotes, and naturally develop tau and amyloid pathology 
with marked cognitive deficits. Importantly, monkeys provide the unique 
opportunity to study early-stage, soluble hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau), 
including p-tau217. As soluble p-tau is rapidly dephosphorylated post mortem, it 
is not captured in human brains except with biopsy material. However, new 
macaque data show that soluble p-tau is toxic to neurons and capable of seeding 
across cortical circuits. Extensive evidence indicates that age-related 
inflammatory signaling contributes to calcium dysregulation, which drives tau 
hyperphosphorylation and amyloid beta generation. Pharmacological studies in 
aged macaques suggest that inhibiting inflammation and restoring calcium 
regulation can reduce tau hyperphosphorylation with minimal side effects, 
appropriate for potential preventive therapeutics. HIGHLIGHTS: Aging monkeys 
provide a unique window into early stage, soluble phosphorylated tau (p-tau). 
Inflammation with advancing age leads to calcium dysregulation, p-tau, and 
amyloid beta (Aβ). Macaque research shows p-tau undergoes transsynaptic seeding 
early in the cortex. p-tau traps amyloid precursor protein-containing endosomes, 
which may increase Aβ and drive vicious cycles. Restoring calcium regulation in 
cortex reduced p-tau217 levels in aged macaques.

INTRODUCTION: The Alzheimer's Association and the Society of Nuclear Medicine 
and Molecular Imaging convened a multidisciplinary workgroup to update 
appropriate use criteria (AUC) for amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) 
and to develop AUC for tau PET.
METHODS: The workgroup identified key research questions that guided a 
systematic literature review on clinical amyloid/tau PET. Building on this 
review, the workgroup developed 17 clinical scenarios in which amyloid or tau 
PET may be considered. A modified Delphi approach was used to rate each scenario 
by consensus as "rarely appropriate," "uncertain," or "appropriate." Ratings 
were performed separately for amyloid and tau PET as stand-alone modalities.
RESULTS: For amyloid PET, seven scenarios were rated as appropriate, two as 
uncertain, and eight as rarely appropriate. For tau PET, five scenarios were 
rated as appropriate, six as uncertain, and six as rarely appropriate.
DISCUSSION: AUC for amyloid and tau PET provide expert recommendations for 
clinical use of these technologies in the evolving landscape of diagnostics and 
therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease.
HIGHLIGHTS: A multidisciplinary workgroup convened by the Alzheimer's 
Association and the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging updated 
the appropriate use criteria (AUC) for amyloid positron emission tomography 
(PET) and to develop AUC for tau PET. The goal of these updated AUC is to assist 
clinicians in identifying clinical scenarios in which amyloid or tau PET may be 
useful for guiding the diagnosis and management of patients who have, or are at 
risk for, cognitive decline These updated AUC are intended for dementia 
specialists who spend a significant proportion of their clinical effort caring 
for patients with cognitive complaints, as well as serve as a general reference 
for a broader audience interested in implementation of amyloid and tau PET in 
clinical practice.

Conflict of interest statement: The workgroup members were required to provide 
disclosure statements of all relationships that might be perceived as a real or 
potential COI. These statements were reviewed and discussed by the workgroup 
co‐chairs and updated and reviewed by an objective third party at the beginning 
of every task force meeting and/or teleconference. Disclosures for task force 
members can be found in the table below. To adjudicate the COIs, the leadership 
from the AA, SNMMI, and Avalere first determined the threshold for a real COI. 
Following consultation with various experts and review of other policies used, 
the team defined COIs as the following: An individual that had relationships 
with industry, including consulting, speaking, research, and other non‐research 
activities, that exceed $5,000 in funding over the previous or upcoming 12‐month 
period. [Table: see text] The AA, SNMMI, and Avalere rigorously attempted to 
avoid any actual, perceived, or potential conflicts of interest (COIs) that 
might have arisen because of an outside relationship or personal interest of 
workgroup members. Both organizations reviewed their own industry relationship 
policies to ensure that the ensuing process adhered to both standards. Author 
disclosures are available in the supporting information.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder characterized 
by memory decline and cognitive impairments. The clinical treatments for AD have 
numerous adverse effects; hence, the exploration of natural products for AD 
therapy is of significant importance. Protocatechuic acid (PA), a natural 
phenolic acid, has been shown to possess various pharmacological activities, 
including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antitumor effects. However, the 
mechanisms underlying its therapeutic potential for AD remain elusive. This 
study utilized a β-amyloid (Aβ) injection into the hippocampus of mice as an AD 
model and L-glu-induced HT-22 cell neurotoxicity and lipopolysaccharides 
(LPS)-induced cellular neuroinflammation models to assess reactive oxygen 
species (ROS), JC-1, and relevant biochemical markers. This study examined 
behavioral, pathological, and inflammatory factors and investigated the 
molecular mechanisms through transcriptomics, western blot, and molecular 
docking studies. This study's findings reveal that high-dose PA (50 mg/kg) 
improves symptoms in AD mice through the cholinergic synaptic signaling pathway. 
This study indicates that PA is a potential candidate for AD treatment targeting 
the cholinergic synaptic signaling pathway, providing a lead compound for AD 
therapy.

INTRODUCTION: Plasma-based biomarkers have shown promise for clinical 
implementation, but their accuracy in differentiating Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
from syndromes associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) has yet 
to be fully investigated. This study assessed the potential of plasma biomarkers 
for differential diagnosis.
METHODS: This cohort study included 374 participants (96 AD, 278 FTLD). Plasma 
phosphorylated tau (p-tau)217, neurofilament light chain (NfL), brain-derived 
tau, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and the amyloid beta1-42/1-40 ratio were 
measured. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses assessed diagnostic 
accuracy, and a three-range threshold approach was used to stratify patients 
based on the most accurate biomarker.
RESULTS: Plasma p-tau217 effectively distinguished AD from FTLD, with the 
NfL/p-tau217 ratio showing superior accuracy. The three-range approach 
identified thresholds with 95% and 97.5% sensitivity and specificity, reducing 
the need for cerebrospinal fluid testing by 75% and 54%, respectively.
DISCUSSION: Plasma p-tau217 and the NfL/p-tau217 ratio are promising 
non-invasive biomarkers for differentiating AD from FTLD, suggesting their use 
as a potential alternative to traditional diagnostic methods.
HIGHLIGHTS: Plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau)217 distinguishes Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) from frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with high accuracy. 
The neurofilament light chain/p-tau217 ratio showed the highest accuracy for 
differentiating AD from FTLD. A three-range threshold reduces the need for 
invasive cerebrospinal fluid testing or amyloid positron emission tomography 
imaging.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a type of neurodegenerative disease that describes 
cognitive decline and memory loss resulting in disability in movement, memory, 
speech etc. Which first affects the hippocampal and entorhinal cortex regions of 
brain. Pathogenesis of AD depends on Amyloid-β, hyper-phosphorylation of tau 
protein, mitochondrial dysfunction, cholinergic hypothesis and oxidative stress. 
In comparison with males, females are more prone to AD due to reduced estrogen 
level. Some of the FDA-approved drugs and their conventional formulations 
available in the market are discussed in this review. Nose-to-brain delivery 
system provides the target specific drug delivery via olfactory and trigeminal 
nerve (active and passive drug targeting strategies) and bypassing the Blood 
Brain Barrier. Mucoadhesive agents and permeation enhancers are mostly utilized 
to enhance the retention time and bioavailability of the drugs. Liposomes, 
niosomes, cubosomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, nanoemulsions, micelles, and 
many more nanocarriers for nose-to-brain delivery of drugs are also described 
thoroughly in this review. It also covers the clinical trials and patents for 
nose-to-brain delivery. In this article, we investigate the nose-to-brain 
pathways for AD treatment strategies.

IMPORTANCE: The ability to predict the onset of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 
and Alzheimer dementia (AD) could allow older adults and clinicians to make 
informed decisions about dementia care.
OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the age at onset of MCI and AD can be predicted 
using a statistical modeling approach.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prognostic study used data from 2 aging 
and dementia cohort studies-the Australian Imaging, Biomarker and Lifestyle 
(AIBL) study and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)-for 
model development and validation of the Florey Dementia Index (FDI), a tool used 
to predict the age at onset of MCI and AD in older adults. Data from the 
Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer (A4) study were used for a 
simulated trial. Data were collected from 1665 AIBL participants, 2029 ADNI 
participants, and 93 A4 participants from October 1, 2004, to March 1, 2023. The 
data analysis was conducted between January and August 2024.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Predicted age at onset compared with clinically 
observed age at onset.
RESULTS: Among the 1665 AIBL participants (741 [44.5%] female) and 2029 ADNI 
participants (925 [45.6%] female), the mean (SD) age at first evaluation was 
71.8 (7.1) years and 74.5 (6.7) years, respectively. The FDI achieved mean 
absolute errors of 2.78 (95% CI, 2.63-2.93) years for predicting MCI onset and 
1.48 (95% CI, 1.32-1.65) years for predicting AD onset. In the simulated trial 
with 93 A4 participants (48 [51.6%] female; mean [SD] age at baseline, 73.4 
[5.1] years), the FDI achieved mean absolute errors of 1.57 (95% CI, 1.41-1.71) 
years for predicting MCI onset and 0.70 (95% CI, 0.53-0.88) years for predicting 
AD onset.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this prognostic study, the FDI was developed and 
validated to predict the onset age of MCI and AD. This tool may be useful in 
organizing health care for older adults with cognitive decline or dementia and 
in the future may help prioritize patients for the use of disease-modifying 
monoclonal antibody drugs.

Amyloid beta 1-42 (Aβ1-42) peptide is one of the most studied disease-related 
amyloidogenic peptides implicated in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). Despite significant scientific breakthroughs in the recent past, the 
existing non-transgenic animal models do not demonstrate accurate pathology of 
AD progression. This review has presented a concise mechanistic understanding of 
the intranasal amyloid-based animal model of AD, along with its advantages, 
challenges, and major limitations. Furthermore, discussions on how to combat 
these challenges to pave the road toward developing novel therapeutics for AD, 
have also been included. Preclinical exploration of repeated intranasal 
amyloid-beta exposure would certainly aid the translational development of a 
robust animal model of AD. This will also provide a better understanding of 
disease progression and pathology in the intranasal animal model.

The brain is the organ with the highest cholesterol content in the body. 
Cholesterol in the brain plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of 
synapses and myelin sheaths to ensure normal brain function. Disruptions in 
cholesterol metabolism are closely associated with various central nervous 
system (CNS) diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease 
(HD), and multiple sclerosis (MS). In this review, we explore the synthesis, 
regulation, transport, and functional roles of cholesterol in the CNS. We 
discuss in detail the associations between cholesterol homeostasis imbalance and 
CNS diseases including AD, HD, and MS, highlighting the significant role of 
cholesterol metabolism abnormalities in the development of these diseases. 
Sterol regulatory element binding protein-2 (SREBP2) and liver X receptor (LXR) 
are two critical transcription factors that play central roles in cholesterol 
synthesis and reverse transport, respectively. Their cooperative interaction 
finely tunes the balance of brain cholesterol metabolism, presenting potential 
therapeutic value for preventing and treating CNS diseases. We particularly 
emphasize the alterations in SREBP2 and LXR under pathological conditions and 
their impacts on disease progression. This review summarizes current therapeutic 
agents targeting these two pathways, with the hope of broadening the 
perspectives of CNS drug developers and encouraging further study into SREBP2 
and LXR-related therapies for CNS diseases.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to assess the screening properties of Foderaro et 
al.s' updated normative framework for the Italian MMSE in detecting mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia due to neurodegenerative, chronic 
cerebrovascular, and mixed etiologies, as well as in differentiating between 
these two syndromes.
METHODS: Data on 234 patients with either MCI (N = 83) or dementia (N = 151) due 
to Alzheimer's disease (N = 112), Lewy body disease (N = 11), frontotemporal 
lobar degeneration (N = 20), chronic cerebrovascular disease (N = 39), or mixed 
(N = 47) etiologies having been administered Foderaro et al.'s version of the 
MMSE were retrospectively recruited. Moreover, N = 247 healthy controls (HCs) 
with a normal Montreal Cognitive Assessment performance were prospectively 
recruited. Receiver-operating characteristics analyses were run to test the 
capability of both raw and demographically adjusted MMSE scores to discriminate 
both HCs from MCI/dementia and MCI from dementia. For these comparisons, 
screening metrics were also computed at Foderaro et al.'s cut-off (<26.02).
RESULTS: The capability of demographically adjusted MMSE scores to discriminate 
both HCs from dementia and MCI from dementia was excellent (AUC = 0.91 and 0.93, 
respectively), whilst good for MCI case-finding (AUC = 0.85). Consistently, the 
screening metrics associated with the cut-off at hand were optimal-to-excellent 
for dementia case-finding (sensitivity = 0.95; specificity = 0.99) and for the 
differentiation between MCI and dementia (sensitivity = 0.95; 
specificity = 0.64), whilst imbalanced for detecting MCI (sensitivity = 0.35; 
specificity = 0.99).
DISCUSSION: Foderaro et al.'s updated normative framework for the Italian MMSE 
has optimal screening properties for both dementia case-finding and the 
discrimination between MCI and dementia, being at variance unbalanced towards 
specificity when it comes to detecting MCI.

INTRODUCTION: Antipsychotic prescriptions are frequent in nursing homes due to 
the challenging management of symptoms associated with Alzheimer's disease and 
related neurodegenerative disorders. This study aimed to assess the association 
between Health-related Quality Of Life (HrQOL) and antipsychotic use in nursing 
homes.
METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study of the KASEHPAD (Karukera Study of 
Ageing in Nursing Homes) study conducted in six nursing homes in Guadeloupe and 
Martinique (French West Indies). The EuroQol 5-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D) 
was used to measure HRQoL. Clinical characteristics and use of antipsychotic 
drugs of 194 older adults with both self-reported and proxy informant HrQOL 
index were extracted. Other outcomes measures included the frequency and 
severity of delusions, hallucinations and agitation using the reduced 
Neuropsychiatric Inventory Nursing Home (NPI-R) score, Activities of Daily 
Living (ADL) score and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score.
RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 81.3 years and 63.6% had major 
cognitive impairment (MMSE score ≤18). The prevalence of delusions (39.7%), 
hallucinations (27.8%) and agitation (40.7%) was high. Antipsychotic medication 
was prescribed to 37.1% of the participants. The self-reported HrQOL Index of 
older adults was higher than the proxy HrQOL Index (0.54 ± 0.43 versus 0.40 ± 
0.43) with a correlation coefficient of 0.63 (p<0.001). The use of antipsychotic 
medication was associated with a higher self-reported HrQOL index, after 
controlling for the frequency (β = 0.144, p = 0.024) or severity (β = 0.159, p = 
0.009) of delusions, hallucinations and agitation symptoms. Conversely, 
antipsychotic use was not associated with proxy HrQOL Index.
CONCLUSION: Despite the adverse effects of long-term use of antipsychotic drugs 
in older adults, it is associated with better-perceived HrQOL among nursing home 
residents. However, this association was not observed when HrQOL was assessed by 
proxy informants. This finding may explain the challenges in reducing the use of 
this therapeutic class in nursing homes.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder that increases 
the prevalence of cognitive impairment in the geriatric population. Aerobic 
exercise is an excellent non-pharmacological therapeutic strategy to prevent 
Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia. The exact molecular 
mechanism of aerobic exercise (Exe) as an intervention to counter cognitive 
decline is far from clear. Metformin is a first-line agent against T2DM with 
neuroprotective properties. The present study assessed the role of treadmill 
exercise in combination with a low dose of metformin (Met; 70 mg/kg) in 
cognitive impairment and its associated molecular mechanism in T2DM rats. The 
experimental model of T2DM-associated cognitive decline was created by 
administration of a high-fat diet (HFD) with a low dose of streptozotocin (STZ; 
35 mg/kg). Neurobehavioral assessments were performed to evaluate spatial 
recognition and fear-conditioned memory across the groups: control, HFD + STZ, 
HFD + STZ + Exe, and HFD + STZ + Exe + Met. In addition, we performed 
immunohistochemistry and western blotting on the rat hippocampal tissue from the 
above groups for protein expression studies. T2DM rats showed a significant 
cognitive decline compared to the control group, which improved in the long-term 
exercise and metformin co-administered animals. The level of neuroinflammation 
was significantly elevated in the hippocampal tissue of T2DM rats compared to 
the control and lowered after exercise and metformin treatment. T2DM reduced 
mature neurons and neurogenesis while increasing astrogliosis and microgliosis, 
ameliorated by exercise and metformin treatment. Moreover, T2DM impaired 
hippocampal neurogenesis by reducing the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway, which 
got upregulated in exercise and metformin-co-administered rats. Long-term 
aerobic exercise with metformin treatment ameliorated neuroinflammation and 
promoted adult hippocampal neurogenesis via upregulating the canonical 
Wnt/β-catenin pathway in T2DM rats.

AIMS: Cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) have beneficial effects on the heart. 
Associations between ChEI-use and reduced mortality and cardiovascular events in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been shown. Whether these associations exist in 
those with both heart failure (HF) and AD is unknown.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A propensity score (PS) matched cohort with patients with 
HF and AD was obtained through linking registers for cognitive/dementia 
disorders, comorbidities, drug prescription, and death, in Sweden, to analyse 
associations between ChEI-use and risk of mortality or hospitalization for HF, 
stroke, or myocardial infarction, were examined. In 455 patients with and 455 
without ChEI treatment, ChEI use was associated with reductions of mortality and 
hospitalization due to HF by 21% [0.79; (confidence interval) CI 0.66-0.96] and 
47% (0.53; CI 0.38-0.75), respectively. Donepezil and galantamine but not 
rivastigmine were associated with a lower risk of death compared with non-users. 
Donepezil was associated with a lower risk of hospitalization due to HF compared 
with non-users. There was no significant difference in hospitalization for 
bradycardia, AV block, or implantation of pacemaker between ChEI use and 
non-use.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that in persons with HF and AD, treatment with 
ChEIs is associated with improved survival and a decreased risk of hospital care 
for HF, but results due to the type of ChEI vary.

A major challenge in the development of more effective therapeutic strategies 
for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the identification of molecular mechanisms 
linked to specific pathophysiological features of the disease. Importantly AD 
has a two-fold higher incidence in women than men and a protracted prodromal 
phase characterized by amnestic mild-cognitive impairment (aMCI) suggesting that 
biological processes occurring early can initiate vulnerability to AD. Here, we 
used a sample of 125 subjects from two independent study cohorts to determine 
the levels in plasma (the most accessible specimen) of two essential 
mitochondrial markers acetyl-L-carnitine (LAC) and its derivative free-carnitine 
motivated by a mechanistic model in rodents in which targeting mitochondrial 
metabolism of LAC leads to the amelioration of cognitive function and boosts 
epigenetic mechanisms of gene expression. We report a sex-specific deficiency in 
free-carnitine levels in women with aMCI and early-AD compared to cognitively 
healthy controls; no change was observed in men. We also replicated the prior 
finding of decreased LAC levels in both women and men with AD, supporting the 
robustness of the study samples assayed in our new study. The magnitude of the 
sex-specific free-carnitine deficiency reflected the severity of cognitive 
dysfunction and held in two study cohorts. Furthermore, patients with the lower 
free-carnitine levels showed higher β-amyloid(Aβ) accumulation and t-Tau levels 
assayed in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Computational analyses showed that the 
mitochondrial markers assayed in plasma are at least as accurate as CSF measures 
to classify disease status. Together with the mechanistic platform in rodents, 
these translational findings lay the groundwork to create preventive 
individualized treatments targeting sex-specific changes in mitochondrial 
metabolism that may be subtle to early cognitive dysfunction of AD risk.

The value of involving people living with diseases in the research process is 
increasingly recognized by professional associations and regulatory agencies 
alike. Patient contributions range from disease prevention and diagnosis to 
medication planning, and from advocacy to guideline production and clinical 
trial design. Thanks to the efforts of activists and advocates, new models of 
patient inclusion in medical research are being developed to replace outdated 
non-participative and tokenistic paradigms. New modalities of patient 
participation in research - for example, the introduction of patient experts, 
who work closely with researchers and clinicians - have progressively empowered 
individuals who are living with diseases. In this Perspective, we provide an 
overview of the current status of patient involvement in medical research, with 
a specific focus on neurology. We also discuss the existing and future roles of 
patient experts in neurological research.

OBJECTIVES: To summarize the delirium treatment trial literature, identify the 
unique challenges in delirium treatment trials, and formulate recommendations to 
address each in older adults.
DESIGN: A 39-member interprofessional and international expert working group of 
clinicians (physicians, nurses, and pharmacists) and nonclinicians 
(biostatisticians, epidemiologists, and trial methodologists) was convened. Four 
expert panels were assembled to explore key subtopics 
(pharmacological/nonpharmacologic treatment, methodological challenges, and 
novel research designs).
METHODS: To provide background and context, a review of delirium treatment 
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between 2003 and 2023 was 
conducted and evidence gaps were identified. The four panels addressed the 
identified subtopics. For each subtopic, research challenges were identified and 
recommendations to address each were proposed through virtual discussion before 
a live, full-day, and in-person conference. General agreement was reached for 
each proposed recommendation across the entire working group via moderated 
conference discussion. Recommendations were synthesized across panels and 
iteratively discussed through rounds of virtual meetings and draft reviews.
RESULTS: We identified key evidence gaps through a systematic literature review, 
yielding 43 RCTs of delirium treatments. From this review, eight unique 
challenges for delirium treatment trials were identified, and recommendations to 
address each were made based on panel input. The recommendations start with 
design of interventions that consider the multifactorial nature of delirium, 
include both pharmacological and nonpharmacologic approaches, and target 
pathophysiologic pathways where possible. Selecting appropriate at-risk patients 
with moderate vulnerability to delirium may maximize effectiveness. Targeting 
patients with at least moderate delirium severity and duration will include 
those most likely to experience adverse outcomes. Delirium severity should be 
the primary outcome of choice; measurement of short- and long-term clinical 
outcomes will maximize clinical relevance. Finally, plans for handling 
informative censoring and missing data are key.
CONCLUSIONS: By addressing key delirium treatment challenges and research gaps, 
our recommendations may serve as a roadmap for advancing delirium treatment 
research in older adults.

BACKGROUNDS: Digital, online assessments are efficient means to detect early 
cognitive decline, but few studies have investigated the relationship between 
remotely collected subjective cognitive change and cognitive decline. We 
hypothesized that the Everyday Cognition Scale (ECog), a subjective change 
measure, predicts longitudinal change in cognition in the Brain Health Registry 
(BHR), an online registry for neuroscience research.
METHODS: This study included BHR participants aged 55 + who completed both the 
baseline ECog and repeated administrations of the CANTAB® Paired Associates 
Learning (PAL) visual learning and memory test. Both self-reported ECog 
(Self-ECog) and study partner-reported ECog (SP-ECog), and two PAL scores (first 
attempt memory score [FAMS] and total errors adjusted [TEA]) were assessed. We 
estimated associations between multiple ECog scoring outputs (ECog positive 
[same or above cut-off score], ECog consistent [report of consistent decline in 
any item], and total score) and longitudinal change in PAL. Additionally we 
assessed the ability of ECog to identify 'decliners', who exhibited the worst 
PAL progression slopes corresponding to the fifth percentile and below.
RESULTS: Participants (n = 16,683) had an average age of 69.07 ± 7.34, 72.04% 
were female, and had an average of 16.66 ± 2.26 years of education. They were 
followed for an average of 2.52 ± 1.63 visits over a period of 11.49 ± 11.53 
months. Both Self-ECog positive (estimate = -0.01, p < 0.001, R²m = 0.56) and 
Self-ECog consistent (estimate=-0.01, p = 0.002, R²m = 0.56) were associated 
with longitudinal change in PAL FAMS after adjusting demographics and clinical 
confounders. Those who were Self-ECog total (Odds ratio [95% confidence 
interval] = 1.390 [1.121-1.708]) and SP-ECog consistent (2.417 [1.591-3.655]) 
had higher probability of being decliners based on PAL FAMS.
CONCLUSION: In the BHR's unsupervised online setting, baseline subjective change 
was feasible in predicting longitudinal decline in neuropsychological tests. 
Online, self-administered measures of subjective cognitive change might have a 
potential to predict objective subjective change and identify individuals with 
cognitive impairments.

PurposeAnticholinergic medication use measured via the Anticholinergic Cognitive 
Burden (ACB) scale has been associated with an increased dementia incidence in 
older adults but has not been explored specifically for Parkinson disease 
dementia (PDD). We used adjusted Cox models to estimate the risk of incident PDD 
associated with demographic factors, clinical characteristics, and time-varying 
total ACB in a longitudinal, deeply-phenotyped prospective PD cohort.Major 
findings56.5% of study participants were taking ACB-scale drugs at enrollment. 
Increasing age, motor symptom burden and psychosis were associated with PDD 
risk. Female sex and educational achievement were protective against PDD. ACB 
categories were not associated with PDD overall, but depression and impulse 
control disorder were strongly associated with PDD in a subsample with high 
baseline ACB.ConclusionsPatient and clinical factors modify PDD risk. PD drug 
safety and drug-disease interaction studies may require considering multiple 
mechanisms and including dose-based, prospectively acquired medication exposure 
measures.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common disease associated with cognitive 
dysfunction, which is closely associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in 
clinical manifestations, pathological changes and prevention. Inhibition of 
dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) can lower blood glucose levels by stimulating 
insulin secretion. Besides, it can affect cognitive function through the 
neuroprotective effect of DPP-4 substrates, such as glucose-dependent insulin 
peptide and glucagon-like peptide-1, the proteolytic effect on amyloid-β and the 
protective effect on neuronal structure. This review discusses the relationship 
between cognitive impairment in T2DM and in AD, summarizes the effect of DPP-4 
inhibitor (DPP-4i) on improving cognitive impairment in these two diseases based 
on the current studies. Given the lack of clinical randomized trials that 
evaluate the effect of DPP-4i on AD, this review is expected to provide 
preclinical evidence for DPP-4i as a potential therapy for the treatment and 
prevention of AD.

BACKGROUND: While the preventive effects of green tea and coffee on cognitive 
decline have been demonstrated, their long-term effects on cognition remain 
unclear.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the effect of green tea and coffee 
consumption in middle age on the prevention of dementia.
METHODS: This population-based cohort study included 1155 participants (aged 
44-66 in 1995). Participants' consumption of green tea and coffee was assessed 
using questionnaires in 1995 and 2000. Their cognitive levels were 
neuropsychologically evaluated in 2025-2015. Logistic regression analyses were 
conducted with significant cognitive decline (defined as multi-domain cognitive 
decline and more severe conditions) as the dependent variable. Stratified 
analyses were also conducted by sex and age.
RESULTS: Individuals who consumed 2-3 cups of green tea daily had a 
significantly reduced risk of cognitive decline (OR = 0.56, 95%CI: 0.35-0.91) 
after adjusting potential confounders. However, this effect was not significant 
with consumption of 4 or more cups. This protective effect was particularly 
observed in males (OR = 0.38, 95%CI: 0.19-0.76). A significant risk reduction 
was also observed in individuals consuming one or more cups of coffee daily 
(OR = 0.54, 95%CI: 0.34-0.84) in the older subjects (median age [53 years old] 
and older in 1995) in the same fully adjusted model, but not in the entire 
sample.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that moderate green tea consumption in midlife 
may have a beneficial effect on preventing dementia, particularly in males. The 
effects of coffee consumption may be more advantageous for older individuals.

BACKGROUND: Medications for comorbid conditions may affect cognition in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD).
OBJECTIVE: To explore the association between common medications and cognition, 
measured with the Mini-Mental State Examination.
METHODS: Cohort study including persons with AD from the Swedish Registry for 
Cognitive/Dementia Disorders (SveDem). Medications were included if they were 
used by ≥5% of patients (26 individual drugs). Each follow-up was analyzed 
independently by performing 100 Monte-Carlo simulations of two steps each 1) 
k-means clustering of patients according to Mini-Mental State Examination at 
follow-up and its decline since previous measure, and 2) Identification of 
medications presenting statistically significant differences in the proportion 
of users in the different clusters.
RESULTS: 15,428 patients (60.38% women) were studied. Four clusters were 
identified. Medications associated with the best cognition cluster (relative to 
the worse) were atorvastatin (point estimate 1.44 95% confidence interval 
[1.15-1.83] at first follow-up, simvastatin (1.41 [1.11-1.78] at second 
follow-up), warfarin (1.56 [1.22-2.01] first follow-up), zopiclone (1.35 
[1.15-1.58], and metformin (2.08 [1.35-3.33] second follow-up. Oxazepam (0.60 
[0.50-0.73] first follow-up), paracetamol (0.83 [0.73-0.95] first follow-up), 
cyanocobalamin, felodipine and furosemide were associated with the worst 
cluster. Cholinesterase inhibitors were associated with the best cognition 
clusters, whereas memantine appeared in the worse cognition clusters, consistent 
with its indication in moderate to severe dementia.
CONCLUSIONS: We performed unsupervised clustering to classify patients based on 
their current cognition and cognitive decline from previous testing. 
Atorvastatin, simvastatin, warfarin, metformin, and zopiclone presented a 
positive and statistically significant associations with cognition, while 
oxazepam, cyanocobalamin, felodipine, furosemide and paracetamol, were 
associated with the worst cluster.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by cognitive impairment.
OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the potential mechanisms of Sheng-Hui-Yi-Zhi (SHYZ) for 
the treatment of AD and explore the effective substances of SHYZ.
METHODS: Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to identify 
the active components of SHYZ. Network pharmacology was employed to predict the 
potential targets and pathways of SHYZ in the treatment of AD. SAMP8 mice were 
used as a model for AD and were treated with SHYZ. The Morris water maze was 
utilized to assess the learning and memory capabilities of mice. Additionally, 
the levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in the brain hippocampus of mice were 
quantified using ELISA. The protein expression of PI3 K/p-PI3 K, AKT/p-AKT, 
MAPK38/p-MAPK38, and NFκB p65/p-NFκB p65 in the hippocampus was analyzed using 
Western blotting. Additionally, qRT-PCR was employed to assess the gene 
expressions of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in the hippocampus.
RESULT: The network pharmacological prediction results showed that the treatment 
of AD with SHYZ was closely related to the inhibition of inflammatory response. 
Behavioral experiments revealed that SHYZ significantly reduced the time taken 
to escape, increased the number of times the platform was crossed, and prolonged 
the residence time in the target quadrant. Meanwhile, SHYZ treatment suppressed 
the expression of Aβ1-42 protein and inflammatory factors. SHYZ significantly 
inhibited the expression of proteins of PI3 K, AKT, MAPK p38, and NF-κB p65.
CONCLUSIONS: SHYZ has been shown to effectively ameliorate learning and memory 
impairment in SAMP8 AD mice by inhibiting the expression of Aβ1-42 and reducing 
the increase of inflammatory factors.
