BACKGROUND: People with Down syndrome have a genetically increased risk of 
developing early onset Alzheimer's dementia. An interview study with healthcare 
providers, patient representatives and employees in residential and work 
facilities was conducted to identify deficits in the healthcare process and 
approaches to overcoming them.
METHOD: In this study 14 semi-structured interviews were conducted and analyzed 
using qualitative content analysis.
RESULTS: A lack of knowledge and experience on the part of medical service 
providers in dealing with and providing medical care for people with Down 
syndrome was identified as a key challenge. In addition, the diagnosis of 
dementia in people with Down syndrome is difficult for various reasons 
(including lack of appropriate diagnostic tools in standard care and lack of 
time or financial resources). Doubts were expressed about the efficacy of 
antidementia medications and the reasons for the increased use of sedatives were 
discussed. Attentive observation of behavior and involvement of caregivers, 
regular review and reduction of polypharmacy and the use of alternative behavior 
modification techniques were mentioned as possible solutions.
CONCLUSION: The identified deficits in the medical care of the target population 
and the approaches to solving them will be incorporated into the development of 
health policy recommendations in order to optimize the care situation of those 
affected in the long term.

Publisher: ZUSAMMENFASSUNG: HINTERGRUND: Menschen mit einem Down-Syndrom (MmDS) 
haben ein genetisch bedingt stark erhöhtes Risiko, an einer früh beginnenden 
Alzheimer-Demenz zu erkranken. In einer Interviewstudie mit Ärzt:innen, 
Patientenvertretungen sowie Mitarbeitenden in Wohn- und Arbeitseinrichtungen 
wurden Defizite im medizinischen Versorgungsprozess und Lösungsansätze erhoben.
METHODIK: Es wurden 14 teilstrukturierte Interviews durchgeführt und über eine 
qualitative Inhaltsanalyse ausgewertet.
ERGEBNISSE: Fehlende Kenntnisse und Erfahrungen von Ärzt:innen im Umgang mit 
sowie in der medizinischen Versorgung von MmDS zeigten sich als zentrale 
Herausforderung. Zudem ist die Diagnostik der Demenz bei MmDS aufgrund 
verschiedener Ursachen (u. a. Fehlen geeigneter Diagnostikinstrumente in der 
Regelversorgung, fehlende zeitliche/finanzielle Ressourcen) erschwert. Zweifel 
an der Wirksamkeit von Antidementiva wurden geäußert sowie Hintergründe für 
einen erhöhten Einsatz sedierender Medikamente diskutiert. Eine aufmerksame 
Verhaltensbeobachtung und eine Einbindung von Betreuenden, eine regelmäßige 
Überprüfung und Reduktion von Multimedikation sowie der Einsatz alternativer 
Verhaltensmodifikationstechniken wurden als Lösungsansätze genannt.
SCHLUSSFOLGERUNG: Die identifizierten Defizite in der medizinischen Versorgung 
der Zielpopulation sowie die Lösungsansätze gehen in die Entwicklung 
gesundheitspolitischer Handlungsempfehlungen ein, um die Versorgungssituation 
nachhaltig zu optimieren.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Alzheimer's disease-related dementias (ADRDs) are 
broad-impact multifactorial neurodegenerative diseases. Their complexity 
presents unique challenges for developing effective therapies. This review 
highlights research presented at the 2024 Society for Neuroscience meeting which 
emphasized the gut microbiome's role in AD pathogenesis by influencing brain 
function and neurodegeneration through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. This 
emerging evidence underscores the potential for targeting the gut microbiota to 
treat AD/ADRD.

OBJECTIVES: The advent of Disease Modifying Therapies (DMTs) for the treatment 
of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) has the potential to transform the lives of those 
with early AD. Timely identification of eligible patients is needed to ensure 
treatments are delivered during a narrow window of therapeutic opportunity. 
Appropriate clinical service design will hinge on improved understanding of 
future demands, thus there is a pressing need to investigate patient eligibility 
in real world clinical cohorts. The primary aim of this study is to assess the 
eligibility by appropriate use criteria (AUC) for lecanemab therapy in a 
real-world, undifferentiated clinical patient cohort attending a Regional 
Specialist Memory Clinic (RSMC), with the secondary aims of determining the 
proportion of patients with biomarker positive Alzheimer's Disease (AD) who 
would be eligible for lecanemab therapy by AUC. Clinical trial eligibility 
criteria were also applied to both groups and discrepancies that exist between 
eligibility rates explored.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of all new patients attending a RSMC from 
1st January 2022 to 31st December 2022 was conducted. Data collected included 
demographic details, outcomes of diagnostic assessments and comorbidities. MRI 
images, where indicated, were reviewed. Amyloid positivity was defined as either 
Amyloid and Tau positive (A+T+) or Amyloid positive with a positive P-Tau/Ab42 
ratio on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing. Appropriate use criteria (AUC) and 
clinical trial criteria for lecanemab were applied. Proportion of eligible 
patients was calculated.
RESULTS: Eleven (5.9%) of 188 new patient attenders were eligible (average age 
66.7 years [SD 8.9], 63.6% female) by AUC, with 26.2% of patients with biomarker 
positive Alzheimer's Disease eligible for lecanemab therapy. The most common 
reason for exclusion was a lack of biomarker confirmation of AD pathology 
followed by cognitive ineligibility (based on defined cognitive testing 
cut-offs) at the time of referral and/or initial assessment. Only 40.4% of 
patients had CSF testing for AD biomarkers while almost 20% of the patients with 
biomarker positive AD were excluded due to lack of a screening MRI in the 
previous 12 months.
CONCLUSION: In this study, the potential eligibility rate by AUC of the entire 
patient cohort (5.9%) was limited by the small proportion of patients who had 
CSF testing for AD biomarkers. So while disease-modification with Lecanemab is a 
welcome therapeutic advance, although only a small proportion of people 
currently attending specialist services will be eligible. Successful delivery of 
DMTs will require significant resource allocation and optimisation of referral 
pathways to facilitate early identification of potentially eligible patients.

BACKGROUND: The predicted prevalence of people with dementia (PWD) in Germany 
has risen to 1.8 million since 2010. In the near future, we will see the 
approval of antibody therapies. The study aims to demonstrate the recent 
anti-dementia medication prescriptions and diagnosis prevalence.
METHODS: Data from 357 general practitioner (GP) and 71 specialist practices 
(SP) (1.1 Mio. patients) were analyzed to demonstrate the prevalence of dementia 
diagnoses and anti-dementia drug prescriptions between 2010 and 2021.
RESULTS: The diagnosis prevalence of PWD (Alzheimer's dementia) remained 
relatively constant in GP practices at 1.0-1.3% (0.19-0.21%). Among SP, the 
prevalence increased from 4.9% (2.8%) to 5.9% (3.6%). The anti-dementia 
prescription rate decreased in GP (from 0.14% to 0.10%) and increased in SP 
practices (from 2.1% to 2.4%).
DISCUSSION: The diagnosis and prescription rate, especially in GP practices, 
remained below the prevalence forecasts and the expected prescriptions.

Publisher: HINTERGRUND: Die prognostizierte Anzahl der Menschen mit Demenz (MmD) 
ist in Deutschland auf 1,8 Mio. MmD angestiegen. In naher Zukunft wird die 
Zulassung einer Antikörper-Therapie erwartet. Ziel der Studie ist es, die 
bisherige Antidementiva-Versorgung im Verhältnis zur Diagnoseprävalenz 
darzustellen.
METHODE: Auf Basis von Abrechnungsdaten von 357 Haus- und 71 Facharztpraxen (1,1 
Mio. Versicherte) wurde die dokumentierte Demenzdiagnose- und die Antidementiva 
Verordnungsprävalenz von 2010 bis 2021 analysiert.
ERGEBNISSE: In Hausarztpraxen blieb die Diagnoseprävalenz der MmD 
(Alzheimer-Demenz) mit 1,0–1,3% (0,19–0,21%) relativ konstant. Bei Fachärzten 
zeigte sich ein Prävalenzanstieg von 4,9% (2,8%) auf 5,9% (3,6%). Die 
Antidementiva-Verordnungsrate nahm in Hausarztpraxen ab (von 0,14% auf 0,10%) 
und in Facharztpraxen zu (von 2,1% auf 2,4%).
DISKUSSION: Das Diagnose- und Verordnungsgeschehen blieb, vor allem in 
Hausarztpraxen, hinter den Prognosen und Erwartungen zurück.

BACKGROUND: Sex differences in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are gaining increasing 
attention. Previously research has shown that sodium benzoate treatment can 
improve cognitive function in AD patients, particularly in the female patients; 
and 1000 mg/day of benzoate appears more efficacious than lower doses. Catalase 
is a crucial endogenous antioxidant; and deficiency of catalase is regarded to 
be related to the pathogenesis of AD. The current study aimed to explore the 
role of sex and benzoate dose in the change of catalase activity among 
benzoate-treated AD patients.
METHODS: This secondary analysis used data from a double-blind trial, in which 
149 CE patients were randomized to receive placebo or one of three benzoate 
doses (500, 750, or 1000 mg/day) and measured with Alzheimer's disease 
assessment scale-cognitive subscale. Plasma catalase was assayed before and 
after treatment.
RESULTS: Benzoate treatment, particularly at 1000 mg/day, increased catalase 
among female patients, but not among male. The increases in the catalase 
activity among the benzoate-treated women were correlated with their cognitive 
improvements. In addition, higher baseline catalase activity was associated with 
more cognitive improvement after benzoate treatment among both female and male 
patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Supporting the oxidative stress theory and sex difference in AD, 
the finding suggest that sex (female) and benzoate dose co-determine catalase 
increase in benzoate-treated AD patients and the catalase increment contributes 
to cognitive improvement of benzoate-treated women.

OBJECTIVES: Decision-analytic models assessing the value of emerging Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) treatments are challenged by limited evidence on short-term trial 
outcomes and uncertainty in extrapolating long-term patient-relevant outcomes. 
To improve understanding and foster transparency and credibility in modeling 
methods, we cross-compared AD decision models in a hypothetical context of 
disease-modifying treatment for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD.
METHODS: A benchmark scenario (US setting) was used with target population MCI 
due to AD and a set of synthetically generated hypothetical trial efficacy 
estimates. Treatment costs were excluded. Model predictions (10-year horizon) 
were assessed and discussed during a 2-day workshop.
RESULTS: Nine modeling groups provided model predictions. Implementation of 
treatment effectiveness varied across models based on trial efficacy outcome 
selection (clinical dementia rating - sum of boxes, clinical dementia rating - 
global, mini-mental state examination, functional activities questionnaire) and 
analysis method (observed severity transitions, change from baseline, 
progression hazard ratio, or calibration to these). Predicted mean time in MCI 
ranged from 2.6 to 5.2 years for control strategy and from 0.1 to 1.0 years for 
difference between intervention and control strategies. Predicted 
quality-adjusted life-year gains ranged from 0.0 to 0.6 and incremental costs 
(excluding treatment costs) from -US$66 897 to US$11 896.
CONCLUSIONS: Trial data can be implemented in different ways across 
health-economic models leading to large variation in model predictions. We 
recommend (1) addressing the choice of outcome measure and treatment 
effectiveness assumptions in sensitivity analysis, (2) a standardized reporting 
table for model predictions, and (3) exploring the use of registries for future 
AD treatments measuring long-term disease progression to reduce uncertainty of 
extrapolating short-term trial results by health-economic models.

Dihydroquercetin is a natural flavonoid with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and 
neuroprotective activities. Dihydroquercetin exhibits a great neuroprotector 
promise in Alzheimer's disorder via preventing the aggregation of 
amyloid-beta-peptide-Aβ(1-42). The goal of the study was to create 
dihydroquercetin-loaded-chitosan nanoparticles (DHQ-CS NPs) loaded to a 
mucoadhesive, thermosensitive in-situ gel for direct nasal administration to 
cure Alzheimer's disorder. Loading drug in chitosan nanoparticles and 
incorporation into thermosensitive gel enhanced residence time and reduced 
mucociliary-clearance. Different in-vitro-physicochemical-characteristics of 
gels and nanoparticles-characterization were used to evaluate the formulations. 
The therapeutic effectiveness of DHQ-CS NPs gel was evaluated behaviorally, 
biochemically and histopathologically in Alzheimer's-rat-model compared to 
intranasal DHQ gel. The small particles-size was obtained = 235.3 nm of DHQ-CS 
NPs. The DHQ-CS NPs gel demonstrated a greater release rate compared to the raw 
DHQ gel. Additionally, the nasal-administration of the DHQ-CS NPs gel showed 
better In-vivo results compared to DHQ gel, through improvement of memory and 
learning deficits and also the exploratory behavior and new object memory in 
streptozotocin induced-Alzheimer rats. Biochemically, the intranasal DHQ-CS NPs 
gel, showed reduced both Aβ-protein formation and tau protein 
hyperphosphorylation, inhibition of acetylcholine esterase activity and 
oxidative stress in the brain with increase of total antioxidants in the brain 
and serum, compared to DHQ gel. Histopathologically, the DHQ-CS NPs nasal gel 
produced improvement in the hippocampal and cerebral cortex structures, being 
comparable to the normal group. Consequently, the intranasal DHQ-CS NPs loaded 
in-situ gel seems to be a promising therapeutic formulation for Alzheimer's 
disease medication.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that leads 
to development of cognition and memory dysfunctions. Currently, there is no 
known cure for AD, although limited medications are approved for the management 
of disease condition. Various plant-based leads give new hope for considering 
phytoconstituents as anti-AD drugs. The Piper nigrum L. fruit extract was 
reported to have anti-Alzheimer's activity. It creates an interest in the 
finding of active moieties that may be accountable for anti-AD activity.
HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE: Identification of multitarget directed ligands isolated from 
Piper nigrum fruits through AI based studies.
STUDY DESIGN: The phytochemical analysis of alkaloid fraction was carried out by 
LCMS, followed by the evaluation of constituents through in silico studies.
METHODS: The fruits methanolic extract was prepared by cold maceration 
technique. The chemical profiling of the alkaloidal fraction was carried out 
using LCMS/MS analysis. The obtained compound's target hit genes were identified 
through network pharmacology studies using String, Metascape, and Cytoscape 
tools. Further, docking studies and MD simulations were carried out using 
AutoDock4 and Desmond-Maestro software. Then, electrochemical properties of hit 
compound P4 were determined using Gaussview6 software.
RESULTS: From LCMS/MS analysis data, 29 compounds were considered based on 
compound intensity and accuracy (>95 %). Then, 41 common gene targets were 
identified from AD genes and compound-targeted genes. The 41 common genes in the 
PPI network suggested that AChE and BACE1 were the most abundant proteins. 
Further, docking studies revealed the hit compound P4 binding interaction and 
energies when compared to other 28 ligands. The molecular dynamics studies 
showed that P4-AChE and P4-BACE1 complexes were stable, and there were no RMSD 
and RMSF fluctuations were observed up to 100 ns. Further, PCA and MM-GBSA 
analysis data supported that complexes (P4-AChE and P4-BACE1) were stable. The 
DFT and surface properties indicated that compound P4 was ideal candidate for AD 
treatment and must be considered for further biological activity studies.
CONCLUSION: The study identified compound P4 (dehydropipernonaline) from 
alkaloidal fraction of Piper nigrum fruits, suggesting it may be hit candidate 
for AD treatment.

Neuroprotective Effects of Amifostine in Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease.

Alwaeli NLW, Al-Zubaidy AAK.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that 
causes an irreversible decline in the functional, cognitive, and behavioral 
activities of affected individuals. Amifostine is a cytoprotective drug with 
well-documented pleiotropic effects such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and 
anti-apoptotic effects. The study was carried out to investigate the 
neuroprotective effect of amifostine in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
METHODS: Swiss Webster albino mice were divided into four groups (n = 10): (I) 
control, (II) scopolamine (1 mg/kg i.p. once daily for 7 days), and two 
treatment groups. The treatment groups received the test drugs prophylactically 
for 2 weeks, followed by induction with scopolamine and the test drug at the 
same doses for one week, followed by (III) donepezil (5 mg/kg daily, i.p. for 
three weeks) or (IV) amifostine (200 mg/kg daily, i.p. for three weeks). After 
the treatments, behavioral tests were conducted using the spontaneous Y maze 
test and the novel object recognition test (NORT). The brain tissue homogenates 
of the experimental mice were processed for biological analysis. The levels of 
inflammatory (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β), and oxidative stress (SOD and MDA) 
markers, as well as acetyl cholinesterase, were determined.
RESULTS: Scopolamine intraperitoneal administration resulted in impairment of 
cognitive performance and neuro-toxicity. Amifostine significantly attenuated 
scopolamine-induced injury, as observed in improved spatial working memory. 
Moreover, amifostine significantly reduced lipid peroxidation, increased SOD 
level, and reduced the proinflammatory markers and acetyl cholinesterase 
activity in brain tissue homogenates.
CONCLUSION: Preconditioning with amifostine had a neuroprotective effect, 
maintained cognitive function, and enhanced cholinergic activity in the 
scopolamine-induced mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.

Alphaherpesviruses, including herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), pseudorabies 
virus (PRV), and bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BoHV-1), are significant pathogens 
affecting humans and animals. These viruses penetrate the upper respiratory 
tract mucosa, yet the mechanisms facilitating this invasion are not fully 
understood. This study investigates the role of the gE/gI glycoprotein complex 
and proteases in mucosal invasion by these viruses. Using species-specific 
respiratory mucosal explants, we observed that the removal of extracellular 
calcium disrupts epithelial junction integrity, enhancing viral infection across 
all viruses and suggesting a common mechanism of targeting a basolaterally 
located receptor. PRV exhibited significantly faster replication and deeper 
invasion compared to HSV-1 and BoHV-1. The gE glycoprotein was consistently 
polarized at the basement membrane across all viruses, indicating a critical 
role in the process of viral entry and subsequent spread through the epithelium. 
In this context, "infection" refers to the virus's attachment to its 
cell-surface receptor, entry into the cell, and completion of the viral life 
cycle, culminating in the production of progeny virions. Notably, in gE/gI null 
mutants of PRV and HSV-1, while the infection was not abortive and the viral 
life cycle was completed, the infection was delayed, and the invasion into the 
deeper layers of the epithelium and underlying mucosa was significantly reduced. 
In BoHV-1 mutants, this effect was even more pronounced, with infection 
restricted to the apical cells, failing to progress to the basal cells. In 
addition, PRV and HSV-1 invasion involved serine protease activity, unlike 
BoHV-1, which correlates with its slower invasion pace. Notably, the protease 
facilitating PRV invasion was identified as a urokinase plasminogen activator 
(uPA), while the specific protease for HSV-1 remains unidentified. These 
findings highlight the critical roles of the gE/gI complex and proteases in 
alphaherpesvirus pathogenesis, offering potential targets for therapeutic 
intervention.
IMPORTANCE: Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infections are a worldwide 
issue. More than three billion people are infected with HSV-1 globally. Although 
most infections with HSV-1 occur subclinically, severe symptoms and 
complications are numerous and can be life-threatening. Complications include 
encephalitis and blindness. Recently, HSV-1 infections have been associated with 
the development of Alzheimer's Disease. To date, no effective vaccines against 
HSV-1 are on the market. Pseudorabies virus (PRV) and bovine herpesvirus type 1 
(BoHV-1) are two alphaherpesviruses of major veterinary importance. Although 
efforts have been made to eradicate these viruses from livestock animals, 
clinical problems still occur, resulting in great economic losses for farmers. 
It is evident that new insights into the pathogenesis of alphaherpesviruses are 
needed, to develop effective treatments and novel preventive therapies.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial form of dementia mainly affecting 
people in the elderly, but no effective cure is available. According to the 
amyloid hypothesis the aggregation of Amyloid-β (Aβ) into oligomeric toxic 
species is believed to concur with the onset and progression of the disease 
heavily. By using a click chemistry approach, we conjugated a suitable designed 
peptide sequence to a metalloporphyrin moiety to obtain three hybrid peptide 
systems to be studied for their interaction with Amyloid-β peptides. The aim is 
to get new tools for the diagnosis and therapy in AD. The results described in 
this study, which were obtained through spectroscopic techniques (UV-Vis, CD, 
bis-Ans and intrinsic porphyrin Fluorescence), Microfluidics (GCI) and cell 
biology (MTT, Live cell imaging and flow cytometry), reveal interesting features 
about the structure-activity relationships connecting these conjugates with the 
interaction with Aβ, as well as on their potential use as sensing systems. In 
our opinion the data reported in this paper make the porphyrin-peptide 
conjugates highly compelling for further exploration as spectroscopic probes to 
detect Aβ biomarkers in biological fluids.

Objective. The purpose of this study is to develop, optimize, and evaluate the 
in vivo effectiveness of orally administered silibinin-loaded nanostructured 
lipid carriers (SB-NLCs) in amyloid β-induced Alzheimer's disease in Wistar 
rats. Methods. The emulsification-solvent evaporation method was used for 
preparing the NLCs, using stearic acid, triacetin, and Cremophor® RH40. The 
statistical optimization of SB-NLCs was done using the Box-Behnken design (BBD). 
Then, the following parameters were evaluated: zeta potential, average size, in 
vitro drug release, and drug entrapment efficiency. Physicochemical properties 
of the optimized SB-NLCs were determined by FTIR, DSC, and P-XRD. The behavioral 
(OFT, NOR, MWM), histological (H&E, Congo Red), and biochemical (TAC, MDA, GSH) 
tests were conducted on 48 male Wistar rats. Results. The findings showed that 
the mean particle size, zeta potential and entrapment efficiency of optimized 
SB-NLCs were 194.71 ± 14.06 nm, -12.46 ± 0.25 mV, and 72.13% ± 1.41, 
respectively. XRD and DSC studies confirmed a reduction in the crystallinity of 
SB which occurred due to its embedment in the nanostructured lipid. The FTIR 
results indicated the lack of existence of any chemical interaction between the 
carrier components and the drug. Drug release in the external environment was 
slow and steady. Drug-containing nanoparticles showed good stability during 
three months of storage at 4 °C. The behavioral test of OFT showed no 
significant change between groups. The group treated with SB-NLCs showed a 
markedly higher discrimination rate compared to the Aβ group (p < 0.001). The 
time of the SB-NLC treated group in the target area was considerably more than 
the time of the SB and Aβ groups, respectively (p < 0.01, p < 0.001), in the MWM 
test. Histological and biochemical analysis revealed better results in the 
SB-NLC group as against the SB group. Conclusion. SB-NLCs can be considered as a 
promising formulation for the proper treatment of Alzheimer's disease in the 
oral drug delivery system.

BACKGROUND: Current AT(N) stratification for Alzheimer's disease (AD) accounts 
for complex combinations of amyloid (A), tau proteinopathy (T) and 
neurodegeneration (N) signatures. Understanding the transition between these 
different stages is a major challenge, especially in view of the recent 
development of disease modifying therapy.
METHODS: This is an observational study, CSF levels of Tau, pTau181, pTau217, 
Aβ38/40/42, sAPPα/β, BACE1 and neurogranin were measured in the BALTAZAR cohort 
of cognitively impaired patients and in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI). Biomarkers levels were related to the AT(N) framework. (A) 
and (T) were defined in BALTAZAR with CSF Aβ42/40 ratio and pTau217 
respectively, and in ADNI with amyloid and tau PET. (N) was defined using total 
CSF tau in both cohorts.
RESULTS: As expected, CSF Aβ42 decreased progressively with the AD continuum 
going from the A-T-N- to the A + T + N + profile. On the other hand, Tau and 
pTau181 increased progressively with the disease. The final transition from 
A + T + N- to A + T + N + led to a sharp increase in Aβ38, Aβ42 and sAPP levels. 
Synaptic CSF biomarkers BACE1 and neurogranin, were lowest in the initial 
A + T-N- stage and increased with T + and N + . CSF pTau181 and total tau were 
closely related in both cohorts.
CONCLUSIONS: The early transition to an A + phenotype (A + T-N-) primarily 
impacts synaptic function. The appearance of T + and then N + is associated with 
a significant and progressive increase in pathological Alzheimer's disease 
biomarkers. Our main finding is that CSF pTau181 is an indicator of N + rather 
than T + , and that N + is associated with elevated levels of BACE1 protein and 
beta-amyloid peptides. This increase may potentially fuel the amyloid cascade in 
a positive feedback loop. Overall, our data provide further insights into 
understanding the interconnected pathological processes of amyloid, tau, and 
neurodegeneration underlying Alzheimer's disease.

Recent studies suggest that heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) contribute to 
the predisposition to, protection from, and potential treatment and prevention 
of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we used electronic health records (EHR) from 
two different health systems to examine whether heparin therapy was associated 
with a delayed diagnosis of AD dementia. Longitudinal EHR data from 15,183 
patients from the Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS) and 6207 patients from 
Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC) were used in separate survival 
analyses to compare those who did or did not receive heparin therapy, had a 
least 5 years of observation, were at least 65 years old by their last visit, 
and had subsequent diagnostic code or drug treatment evidence of possible AD 
dementia. Analyses controlled for age, sex, comorbidities, follow-up duration 
and number of inpatient visits. Heparin therapy was associated with significant 
delays in age of clinical diagnosis of AD dementia, including +1.0 years in the 
MSMS cohort (P < 0.001) and +1.0 years in the CUMC cohort (P < 0.001). While 
additional studies are needed, this study supports the potential roles of 
heparin-like drugs and HSPGs in the protection from and prevention of AD 
dementia.

Abnormal hyperphosphorylation and microtubule-associated protein tau aggregation 
development in the brain are characteristics of neurodegenerative diseases 
referred to as tauopathies, which include Alzheimer's disease (AD). The current 
review summarizes the complex relationships that exist between oxidative stress 
and tau illness, with particular attention to the roles played by the tau 
protein, reactive oxygen species and their consequences, and tau phosphorylation 
and oxidative stress. Two key elements of detrimental cycle that are critical in 
neurodegenerative tauopathies are tau hyperphosphorylation and oxidative stress. 
When tau and microtubules are not connected properly, microtubule instability, 
issues with microtubule transport, and ultimately neuronal death result. While 
the causes of the more prevalent sporadic late-onset variants and the 
connections between tau hyperphosphorylation and neurodegeneration remain 
largely unknown, mutations in the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) gene 
have been identified in familial cases of early-onset tauopathies. Another 
detrimental feature of tauopathies is oxidative stress, but the exact role it 
plays in the development of the disease is unclear. The source of reactive 
oxygen species (ROS), which lead to oxidative stress within neural tissue, 
remains an unresolved topic. Although mitochondria have historically been 
thought to be a primary source of oxidative stress, microglial cells have 
recently been discovered to create reactive oxygen species in tauopathies. In 
conclusion, enhancing our comprehension of the impact of oxidative stress on 
various diseases could facilitate the identification of new disease markers and 
lead to the formulation of treatment strategies aimed at halting, reversing, or 
mitigating disease progression.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of hearing loss in patients with 
dementia, examine the use of hearing aids in those with hearing loss, and 
ascertain if the cause of hearing loss is central or peripheral in origin.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study involving 143 patients with dementia which 
was conducted in Saudi Arabia from 2020 to 2023 in King Abdulaziz Medical City, 
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, to determine hearing loss. The study included patients 
aged ≥60 years who had dementia, hearing loss, and neurological diseases. Those 
with Parkinson's disease and secondary epilepsy were excluded. Data was analyzed 
for its demographics, clinical features, predisposing factors, treatment, 
dementia duration and progression, and hearing loss outcomes. All statistical 
analyses were performed using IBM's SPSS software, version 29.0.0. Statistical 
significance was established at a p-value of ≤0.05 and a confidence interval of 
95%.
RESULTS: The findings indicated that 88.8% of the 143 patients exhibited 
dementia, with Alzheimer's disease being the most prevalent type. Moreover, 
18.2% had hearing issues, and 11.2% had other complaints. Audiometry was 
performed in 15.4% of the cases. Hearing loss was present in 14.7% of the 
patients, being primarily bilateral, ranging from mild to severe.
CONCLUSION: This study has clarified the link between hearing loss and dementia 
onset and has emphasized the need for early evaluation and intervention for 
individuals with hearing impairment.

BACKGROUND: There is a critical gap in understanding the symptom experience and 
health outcomes of older adults with and without Alzheimer's Disease and related 
dementias (ADRD) and polypharmacy (PPY). The primary aim of the study was to 
compare the number of symptoms experienced over time in older adults with and 
without ADRD by polypharmacy status. The secondary aim was to examine the 
trajectory of physical function and health outcomes over time in each group.
METHODS: This study utilized longitudinal data from the National Health and 
Aging Trends Study, a nationally representative sample of Medicare beneficiaries 
from 2016-2019. The sample was separated into four groups (N = 2,052): neither 
ADRD or PPY (n = 1,048), PPY only (n = 761), ADRD only (n = 116), and both ADRD 
and PPY(n = 127).
RESULTS: The overall sample was predominately female (57.9%), White (70.9%), 
aged 84 or younger (75%), married (46%), and had some college or a college 
degree (50%). Participants with both ADRD and PPY experienced more symptoms on 
average, had higher odds of falls, hospitalizations, and mortality than all 
other groups. Older adults with both ADRD and PPY had lower physical function, 
needed more assistance with activities of daily living and higher assistive 
device utilization compared to the other three groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate that older adults with both ADRD and PPY 
experience more symptoms, negative health outcomes and physical function decline 
that can negatively impact their quality of life. Further research is needed to 
identify strategies for reducing PPY in people with ADRD.

Neurodegenerative diseases (ND) are often accompanied by dementia, motor 
dysfunction, or disability. Caring for these patients imposes a significant 
psychological and financial burden on families. Until now, there are no 
effective methods for the treatment of NDs. Among them, Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
and Parkinson's disease (PD) are the two most common. Recently, studies have 
revealed that the overexpression of certain genes may be linked to the 
occurrence of AD and PD. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are a powerful tool for 
gene silencing because they can specifically bind to and cleave target mRNA. 
However, the intrinsic properties of naked siRNA and various physiological 
barriers limit the application of siRNA in the brain. Nanotechnology is a 
promising option for addressing these issues. Nanoparticles are not only able to 
protect siRNA from degradation but also have the advantage of crossing various 
physiological barriers to reach the brain target of siRNA. In this review, we 
aim to introduce diverse nanotechnology used for delivering siRNA to treat AD 
and PD. Finally, we will briefly discuss our perspectives on this promising 
field.

The increasing attention towards age-related diseases has generated significant 
interest in the concept of cognitive dysfunction associated with Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). Certain limitations are associated with the current therapies, and 
flavonoids have been reported to exhibit multiple biological activities and 
anti-AD effects in several AD models owing to their antioxidative, 
anti-inflammatory, and anti-amyloidogenic properties. In this study, we 
performed an initial in silico predictions of the pharmacokinetic properties of 
three flavonoids (rhoifolin, baicalein 5,6-dimethyl ether and agathisflavone). 
Subsequently, we evaluated the antiamnesic and antioxidant potential of 
flavonoids in concentrations of 1, 3, and 5 μg/L in scopolamine (100 μM)-induced 
amnesic zebrafish (Danio rerio) model. Zebrafish behavior was analyzed by novel 
tank diving test (NTT), Y-maze, and novel object recognition test (NOR). 
Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, brain antioxidant status and the 
expression of bdnf, npy, egr1, nrf2α, creb1 genes, and CREB-1 protein level was 
measured to elucidate the underlying mechanism of action. Our flavonoids 
improved memory and decreased anxiety-like behavior of scopolamine-induced 
amnesia in zebrafish. Also, the studied flavonoids reduced AChE activity and 
brain oxidative stress and upregulated the gene expression, collectively 
contributing to neuroprotective properties. The results of our study add new 
perspectives on the properties of flavonoids to regulate the evolution of 
neurodegenerative diseases, especially AD, by modulating the expression of genes 
involved in the regulation of synaptic plasticity, axonal growth, and guidance, 
sympathetic and vagal transmission, the antioxidant response and cell 
proliferation and growth.

Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) plays a pivotal role in the cholinergic system, and 
its inhibition is sought after in a wide range of applications, from insect 
control to Alzheimer's disease treatment. While the primary physiological 
isoforms of AChE are membrane-bound proteins, most assays for discovering new, 
safer, and potent inhibitors are conducted using commercially available soluble 
isoforms, such as the electric eel AChE (eeAChE). In this study, we conducted a 
comparative analysis of the activity and selectivity to phenolic inhibitors of 
recombinant human AChE, eeAChE and a mutant variant of human AChE known as 
dAChE4. Despite numerous mutations, dAChE4 closely resembles its parental 
protein and serves as a suitable model for monomeric human AChE. We also 
established an in vitro system of membrane-bound AChE to create a model that 
closely mimics the physiological isoforms. This system ensures the proper work 
of the enzyme and allowed us to control the exact concentration of enzyme and 
lipids per assay.

The multifaceted nature of the neurodegenerative diseases, as Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) with several interconnected 
etiologies, and the absence of effective drugs, led herein to the development 
and study of a series of multi-target directed ligands (MTDLs). The developed 
RIV-IND hybrids, derived from the conjugation of an approved anti-AD drug, 
rivastigmine (RIV), with melatonin analogues, namely indole (IND) derivatives, 
revealed multifunctional properties, by associating the cholinesterase 
inhibition of the RIV drug with antioxidant activity, biometal (Cu(II), Zn(II), 
Fe(III)) chelation properties, inhibition of amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregation (self- 
and Cu-induced) and of monoamine oxidases (MAOs), as well as neuroprotection 
capacity in cell models of AD and PD. In particular, two hybrids with 
hydroxyl-substituted indoles (5a2 and 5a3) could be promising multifunctional 
compounds that inspire further development of novel anti-neurodegenerative 
drugs.

BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Automatic lesion segmentation techniques on MRI scans of 
people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) could support lesion detection and 
segmentation in trials and clinical practice. However, knowledge on their 
reliability across scanners is limited, hampering clinical implementation. The 
aim of this study was to investigate the within-scanner repeatability and 
between-scanner reproducibility of lesion segmentation tools in pwMS across 
three different scanners and examine their accuracy compared to manual 
segmentations with and without optimization.
METHODS: 30 pwMS underwent a scan and rescan on three MRI scanners. GE Discovery 
MR750 (3.0 T), Siemens Sola (1.5 T) and Siemens Vida (3.0 T)). 3D-FLuid 
Attenuated Inversion Recovery (3D-FLAIR) and 3D T1-weighted scans were acquired 
on each scanner. Lesion segmentation involved preprocessing and automatic 
segmentation using the Lesion Segmentation Toolbox (LST) and nicMSlesions 
(nicMS) as well as manual segmentation. Both automated segmentation techniques 
were used with default settings, and with settings optimized to match manual 
segmentations for each scanner specifically and combined for the three scanners. 
LST settings were optimized by adjusting the threshold to improve the Dice 
similarity coefficient (DSC) for each scanner separately and a combined 
threshold for all scanners. For nicMS the last layers were retrained, once with 
the multi-scanner data to represent a combined optimization and once separately 
for each scanner for scanner specific optimization. Volumes and counts were 
extracted. DSC was calculated for accuracy, and reliability was assessed using 
intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC). Differences in DSC between software 
was tested with a repeated measures ANOVA and when appropriate post-hoc paired 
t-tests using Bonferroni correction.
RESULTS: Scanner-specific optimization significantly improved DSC for LST 
compared to default and combined settings, except for the GE scanner. NicMS 
showed significantly higher DSC for both the scanner-specific and combined 
optimization than default. Within-scanner repeatability was excellent (ICC>0.9) 
for volume and counts. Between-scanner ICC for volume between Vida and Sola was 
higher (0.94-0.99) than between GE MR750 and Vida or Sola (0.18-0.93), with 
improved ICCs for nicMS scanner-specific (0.87-0.93) compared to others 
(0.18-0.79). This was not present for Sola vs. Vida where all ICCs were 
excellent (>0.94).
CONCLUSION: Scanner-specific optimization strategies proved effective in 
mitigating inter-scanner variability, addressing the issue of insufficient 
reproducibility and accuracy found with default settings.

Mind Language Disturbances and PET-Signs of Depression vs Alzheimer's Disease: 
Are There Any Common Patterns Identified?

Smirnova D(1), Cumming P.

Author information:

BACKGROUND: There is a broad appreciation that a diagnosis of depression (D) in 
the elderly is a strong risk factor for incident dementia, particularly 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Indeed, the two disorders might constitute a dyad, 
although their causal relationship is uncertain, given the likely bidirectional 
and compounding effects of social withdrawal and loss of previous activities, 
and the manifestation of language disturbances, cognitive dysfunction, and 
social disruption that are typical of both conditions. We argue that language 
declines in D and AD share common patterns and biological underpinnings, and 
that D/AD patients might benefit from intensive language remediation training 
aiming to improve the functioning of neural networks that are linked to similar 
cognitive impairments.
METHODS: A literature search in PubMed database included topics of language 
disturbances, cognitive impairments, and molecular brain imaging by positron 
emission tomography (PET) to identify common patterns in D and AD regarding 
language decline and its neurobiological underpinnings.
RESULTS: Language disturbances show a particular commonality in the two 
disorders, manifesting in simplified language and particular speech markers 
(e.g., lexical and semantic repetitions, arguably due to ruminations in D and 
memory deficits in AD). PET can reveal abnormal protein deposits that are 
practically diagnostic of AD, but cerebrometabolic deficits to PET with the 
glucose tracer FDG show a certain commonality in D and AD. Typical findings of 
hypometabolism in the frontal lobes doubtless underlie the executive function 
deficits, where frontal hypometabolism in prodromal D increases with AD 
progression. This may reflect overlapping changes in noradrenaline and other 
neurotransmitter (e.g. serotonin) changes. Cerebrometabolic deficits associated 
with language dysfunction may inform targeted language remediation treatments in 
the D/AD progression.
CONCLUSIONS: Language remediation techniques targeting specific language 
disturbances might present an important complimentary treatment strategy along 
with an adjusted pharmacotherapy approach and standard psychosocial 
rehabilitation interventions. We see a need for investigations of language 
remediation informed by the overlapping pathologies and language disturbances in 
D and AD.

OBJECTIVES: Alzheimer's disease (AD) presents a major global health issue of 
significant socio-economic impact. Pharmacological treatments for AD have 
limited efficacy, prompting the exploration of alternative therapies, such as 
repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a promising non-invasive 
technique to enhance cognitive function in AD patients. Our systematic review 
and meta-analysis aim to evaluate the efficacy of rTMS in relation to cognitive 
function in AD patients, identify optimal rTMS stimulation parameters, and 
understand the underlying neural mechanisms.
METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive literature search in PubMed using 
predefined search terms to identify original research articles investigating the 
effects of rTMS on cognitive function in AD patients. We selected only 
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with sufficient quantitative data for 
comparing active rTMS to the sham-coil treatment, and then performed a random 
effects meta-analysis using standardized mean differences (SMDs) to synthesize 
the effects across studies.
RESULTS: The systematic review included 22 studies, among which 14 RCTs met our 
criteria for meta-analysis. High-frequency rTMS, particularly targeting the 
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), evoked significant cognitive 
improvements in AD patients, with a moderate positive effect size of rTMS on 
cognitive function (Hedges' g=0.580, 95% CI [0.268, 0.892], p<0.001), albeit 
with substantial heterogeneity (I²=59%). Funnel plot asymmetry and Egger's test 
suggested a potential publication bias, but fail-safe N analysis indicated a 
robust finding. Moreover, anhedonia-apathy symptoms and motor-cognitive 
exercises mediated the efficacy of tTMS in ameliorating cognitive functioning 
across several studies.
CONCLUSION: rTMS demonstrates moderate efficacy in improving cognitive function 
in AD-patients, most distinctly with high-frequency rTMS stimulation protocols 
targeting the DLPFC area. The meta-analysis support rTMS as a viable therapeutic 
intervention for cognitive enhancement in AD. Future promising research should 
focus on personalized treatment strategies targeting mediating factors, baseline 
connectivity patterns, and TMS-induced neuroplasticity in AD.

    medRxiv. 2024 Jul 03:2024.07.01.24309777. doi: 10.1101/2024.07.01.24309777.

Spinocerebellar ataxia 27B (SCA27B) is a common autosomal dominant ataxia caused 
by an intronic GAA•TTC repeat expansion in FGF14. Neuropathological studies have 
shown that neuronal loss is largely restricted to the cerebellum. Although the 
repeat locus is highly unstable during intergenerational transmission, it 
remains unknown whether it exhibits cerebral mosaicism and progressive 
instability throughout life. We conducted an analysis of the FGF14 GAA•TTC 
repeat somatic instability across 156 serial blood samples from 69 individuals, 
fibroblasts, induced pluripotent stem cells and post-mortem brain tissues from 
six controls and six patients with SCA27B, alongside methylation profiling using 
targeted long-read sequencing. Peripheral tissues exhibited minimal somatic 
instability, which did not significantly change over periods of more than 
20 years. In post-mortem brains, the GAA•TTC repeat was remarkably stable across 
all regions, except in the cerebellar hemispheres and vermis. The levels of 
somatic expansion in the cerebellar hemispheres and vermis were, on average, 
3.15 and 2.72 times greater relative to other examined brain regions, 
respectively. Additionally, levels of somatic expansion in the brain increased 
with repeat length and tissue expression of FGF14. We found no significant 
difference in methylation of wild-type and expanded FGF14 alleles in post-mortem 
cerebellar hemispheres between patients and controls. In conclusion, our study 
revealed that the FGF14 GAA•TTC repeat exhibits a cerebellar-specific expansion 
bias, which may explain the pure cerebellar involvement in SCA27B.

BACKGROUND: Analysis of existing mutations of Angiotensin-I-Converting Enzyme 
(ACE) led us to hypothesize that the carriers of damaging ACE mutations 
(accompanied by low ACE levels) could be at risk for the development of 
late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We quantified blood ACE levels in 
EDTA-containing plasma from 15 patients with 11 different heterozygous ACE 
mutations and estimated the effects of these mutations on ACE phenotypes, using 
a set of mAbs to ACE and two ACE substrates. We confirmed prior observations 
that the relatively frequent Y215C mutation in the N domain of ACE (present in 
~1% of the population) is associated with both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 
reduced plasma levels of ACE (~50% of controls), indicating that it likely 
results in a transport-deficient protein. In addition, we identified another 4 
mutations in both ACE domains (M118T, C734Y, V992M and V997M) which are also 
associated with decreased ACE levels in the blood, and, thus, could be putative 
risk factors for late-onset AD. One of these mutations, C734Y, is likely 
transport-deficient, while the other mutations appear to influence ACE catalytic 
properties. The precipitation of mutant M118T by mAb 2D1 and ACE mutant C734Y by 
mAb 3F10 increased 2-3-fold compared to native ACE, and therefore, these mAbs 
could be markers of these mutations. Also, we identified a mutation I989T, which 
is associated with increased ACE levels in the blood.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Conducting a systematic analysis of blood ACE levels 
in patients with ACE mutations holds promise for identifying individuals with 
low blood ACE levels. Such individuals may be at increased risk for late-onset 
AD. The patients with transport-deficient ACE mutations may benefit from 
therapeutic treatment with a combination of chemical and pharmacological 
chaperones and proteasome inhibitors, as was demonstrated previously using a 
cell model of the transport-deficient ACE mutation, Q1069R [Danilov et al, PLoS 
One, 2010].

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that significantly 
impairs cognitive and functional abilities, placing a substantial burden on both 
patients and caregivers. Current symptomatic treatments fail to halt the 
progression of AD, highlighting the urgent need for more effective 
disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). DMTs under development are classified as 
either passive or active on the basis of their mechanisms of eliciting an immune 
response. While this review will touch on active immunotherapies, we primarily 
focus on anti-amyloid beta monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), a form of passive 
immunotherapy, discussing their multifaceted role in AD treatment and the 
critical factors influencing their therapeutic efficacy. With two mAbs now 
approved and prescribed in the clinical setting, it is crucial to reflect on the 
lessons learned from trials of earlier mAbs that have shaped their development 
and contributed to their current success. These insights can then guide the 
creation of even more effective mAbs, ultimately enhancing therapeutic outcomes 
for patients with AD while minimizing adverse events.

Chitosan nanoparticles have emerged as a promising therapeutic platform for 
treating neurological disorders due to their biocompatibility, biodegradability, 
and ease of functionalization. One of the significant challenges in treating 
neurological conditions is overcoming the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which 
restricts the effective delivery of therapeutic agents to the brain. Addressing 
this barrier is crucial for the successful treatment of various neurological 
diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, 
migraine, psychotic disorders, and brain tumors. Chitosan nanoparticles offer 
several advantages: they enhance drug absorption, protect drugs from 
degradation, and enable targeted delivery. These properties open new 
possibilities for non-invasive therapies for neurological conditions. Numerous 
studies have highlighted the neuroprotective potential of chitosan 
nanoparticles, demonstrating improved outcomes in animal models of 
neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. Additionally, surface modifications of 
these nanoparticles allow for the attachment of specific ligands or molecules, 
enhancing the precision of drug delivery to neuronal cells. Despite these 
advancements, several challenges persist in the clinical translation of chitosan 
nanoparticles. Issues such as large-scale production, regulatory hurdles, and 
the need for further research into long-term safety must be addressed. This 
review explores recent advancements in the use of chitosan nanoparticles for 
managing neurological disorders and outlines potential future directions in this 
rapidly evolving field of research.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease causing cognitive 
and memory decline. AD is characterized by the deposition of amyloid-β and 
hypophosphorylated forms of tau protein. AD brains are found to be associated 
with neurodegeneration, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Cannabidiol (CBD) 
shows neuroprotective, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties and 
simultaneously reduces amyloid-β production and tau hyperphosphorylation. The 
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a vital role in the development 
and maintenance of the plasticity of the central nervous system. A decline of 
BDNF levels in AD patients results in reduced plasticity and neuronal cell 
death. Current therapeutics against AD are limited to only symptomatic relief, 
necessitating a therapeutic strategy that reverses cognitive decline. In this 
scenario, combination therapy of CBD and BDNF could be a fruitful strategy for 
the treatment of AD. We designed mannose-conjugated chitosan-coated 
poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide (PLGA) (CHTMAN-PLGA) nanoparticles for the 
codelivery of CBD and BDNF to the brain. Chitosan is modified with mannose to 
specifically target the glucose transporter-1 (GLUT-1) receptor abundantly 
present in the blood-brain barrier for selectively delivering therapeutics to 
the brain. The CBD-encapsulated nanoparticles showed an average hydrodynamic 
diameter of 306 ± 8.12 nm and a zeta potential of 31.7 ± 1.53 mV. The coated 
nanoparticles prolonged encapsulated CBD release from the PLGA matrix. The 
coated nanoparticles exhibited sustained release of CBD for up to 22 days with 
91.68 ± 2.91% release of the encapsulated drug. The coated nanoparticles, which 
had a high positive zeta potential (31.7 ± 1.53 mV), encapsulated the plasmid 
DNA. The qualitative transfection efficiency was investigated using 
CHTMAN-PLGA-CBD/pGFP in bEND.3, primary astrocytes, and primary neurons, while 
the quantitative transfection efficiency of the delivery system was determined 
using CHTMAN-PLGA-CBD/pBDNF. In vitro, the pBDNF transfection study revealed 
that the BDNF expression was 4-fold higher for CHTMAN-PLGA-CBD/pBDNF than for 
naked pBDNF in all of the cell lines. The cytotoxicity and hemocompatibility of 
the designed nanoparticles were tested in bEND.3 cells and red blood cells, 
respectively, and the nanoparticles were found to be nontoxic and 
hemocompatible. Hence, mannose-conjugated chitosan-coated PLGA nanoparticles 
could be useful as brain-targeting delivery vehicles for the codelivery of CBD 
and BDNF for possible AD treatment.

Inflammation within the brain is a hallmark of a wide range of brain diseases. 
The complex role of inflammatory processes in these conditions suggests that 
neuroinflammation could be a valuable therapeutic target. While several 
promising anti-inflammatory agents have been identified, their clinical 
application in brain diseases is often hampered by the inability to cross the 
blood-brain barrier (BBB) and reach therapeutically effective concentrations at 
the pathological sites. This limitation highlights the urgent need for effective 
BBB-penetrating drug delivery systems designed to target brain inflammation. 
This review critically examines the recent advances over the past five years in 
drug delivery strategies aimed at mitigating brain inflammation in Alzheimer's 
disease and ischemic stroke─two of the leading causes of death and disability 
worldwide. Additionally, we address the key challenges in this field, offering 
insights into future directions for targeting neuroinflammation in the treatment 
of brain diseases.

Alzheimer's disease is a significant concern due to its high prevalence and the 
limitations of current treatments. In our research, we investigated Mauritia 
flexuosa, a medicinal plant traditionally used for headaches, to identify active 
compounds with potential anti-Alzheimer's effects. Three pentacyclic triterpenes 
were isolated through column chromatography and characterised from the 
dichloromethane/methanol extract from Mauritia flexuosa (DCMEMf), with 
(3β)-3-hydroxy-11-oxours-12-en-28-oic acid (3) showing the highest in vitro 
activity in the HMC3 and SVG p12 cell lines. Compound 3 inhibited the 
pharmacological targets NF-κB, PGE2, IDO1, and EGFR with IC50 values of 9.83, 
3.86, 1.63 μM, and 49.57 nM, respectively, attributed to a hydroxyl group at the 
C-3 position of its structure. These findings suggest the potential of these 
compounds in treating neurological diseases, including headaches, and offer 
promising prospects for the development of new therapies against Alzheimer's.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are secreted by all major cell types of the brain, 
providing a mode of intercellular communication and a pathway for disposal of 
cellular debris. EVs help maintain healthy brain function, but may also 
contribute to diseases affecting the brain. EVs might contribute to aging of the 
brain, as aging-related processes such as inflammation and cellular senescence 
may alter EV cargo, promoting further inflammation and senescence. However, the 
effects of aging on brain EVs and the function of EVs in the aging brain remain 
poorly understood. To address this question, we measured the levels and protein 
cargo of EVs isolated from the brains of 4-, 12-, and 22-month-old C57BL/6J 
mice. We detected no changes in EV levels, but observed age-dependent changes in 
EV proteins. EV fractions from aged (22 month old) brains contained higher 
levels of extracellular matrix proteins than EV fractions from young (4 month 
old) brains, with intermediate levels in 12-month-old brains. Specifically, EV 
fractions from aged mice contained elevated levels of hyaluronan and 
proteoglycan link proteins 1 and 2 and several chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans 
(CSPGs). Analysis of extracellular matrix in several brain regions of aged mice 
revealed increased immunolabeling for the CSPG aggrecan, but reduced labeling 
with Wisteria floribunda agglutinin, which binds to chondroitin sulfate side 
chains of CSPGs. These data are consistent with prior studies showing changes to 
the composition of extracellular matrix in aged brains, and indicate a novel 
association of EVs with changes in the extracellular matrix of the aging brain.

Resveratrol (RSV), as a natural polyphenol exhibiting antioxidative properties, 
is studied in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. However, RSV has low 
oral bioavailability. In this study and in order to overcome the issue, RSV was 
encapsulated into the solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs). In this study, 
RSV-loaded solid lipid nanoparticles (RSV-SLNs) were prepared by the solvent 
emulsification-evaporation technique, and their physicochemical properties were 
optimized using Box-Behnken response surface methodology. The morphology of the 
particles was evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and 
transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The neuroprotective effects of the 
nanoparticles were investigated in animal models using the Morris water maze 
(MWM). Then after, the rats were sacrificed, their brains were collected, and 
the extent of lipid peroxidase (LPO) as well as the level of reduced glutathione 
(GSH) were determined in the hippocampus section samples. Finally, the collected 
brain tissues were histologically studied. The particle size, polydispersity 
index (PDI), zeta potential, entrapment efficiency (EE%), and drug loading (DL%) 
of the optimized nanoparticles were 104.5 ± 12.3 nm, 0.322 ± 0.11, -3.1 ± 
0.15 mV, 72.9 ± 5.31% and 14.6 ± 0.53%, respectively. The microscopic images 
revealed spherically shaped and nonaggregated nanoparticles. The in vivo studies 
demonstrated higher efficiency of RSV-SLN in the reduction of escape latency 
time and improvement in the time spent in the target quadrant compared to free 
RSV. Moreover, it was demonstrated that RSV-SLN posed a higher potency in the 
reduction of LPO as well as elevation of the GSH levels in the brain samples. 
The histological studies revealed a decline in neural degeneration and an 
improvement in the CA1 pyramidal cell morphology. The obtained data revealed 
that RSV-SLNs caused more reduction in Alzheimer-related symptoms rather than 
free RSV.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a debilitating condition with 
limited treatments and additional therapeutic targets needed. Identifying AD 
protective genetic loci may identify new targets and accelerate identification 
of therapeutic treatments. We examined a founder population to identify loci 
associated with cognitive preservation into advanced age.
METHODS: Genome-wide association and linkage analyses were performed on 946 
examined and sampled Amish individuals, aged 76-95, who were either cognitively 
unimpaired (CU) or impaired (CI).
RESULTS: A total of 12 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) demonstrated 
suggestive association (P ≤ 5 × 10-4) with cognitive preservation. Genetic 
linkage analyses identified > 100 significant (logarithm of the odds 
[LOD] ≥ 3.3) SNPs, some which overlapped with the association results. Only one 
locus on chromosome 2 retained significance across multiple analyses.
DISCUSSION: A novel significant result for cognitive preservation on chromosome 
2 includes the genes LRRTM4 and CTNNA2. Additionally, the lead SNP, rs1402906, 
impacts the POU3F2 transcription factor binding affinity, which regulates LRRTM4 
and CTNNA2.
HIGHLIGHTS: GWAS and linkage identified over 100 loci associated with cognitive 
preservation. One locus on Chromosome 2 retained significance over multiple 
analyses. Predicted TFBSs near rs1402906 regulate genes associated with 
neurocognition.

INTRODUCTION: Clinicians lack the tools to incorporate physical activity into 
clinical care for Alzheimer's disease prevention. We tested a 52-week exercise 
and health education program (Lifestyle Empowerment for Alzheimer's Prevention 
[LEAP! Rx]) that integrates clinician referrals and community-based fitness 
resources.
METHODS: We randomized 219 participants to the LEAP! Rx (ie, exercise and 
monthly brain health education) or a standard-of-care control group and tested 
the effects on cardiorespiratory fitness, insulin resistance, body composition, 
lipids, and cognitive performance.
RESULTS: Physicians were able to connect their patients to a community lifestyle 
intervention. The intervention group increased in cardiorespiratory fitness at 
12 and 52 weeks (p = 0.005). We observed no effects on secondary measures. 
Participants meeting 80% of weekly goals (150 min, moderate to vigorous 
activity) saw greater fitness improvements than those with less than 80% 
(p < 0.001).
DISCUSSION: These results hold promise for broad implementation of exercise 
interventions into larger healthcare systems and have implications for improved 
research recruitment strategies.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT No. NCT03253341.
HIGHLIGHTS: Our community-based exercise program increased cardiorespiratory 
fitness. Our digital physician referral method increased the diversity of the 
participant sample. Our findings have implications for personalized dementia 
risk reduction strategies.

With the increasing prevalence of diabetes mellitus worldwide, type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (T2D) combined with cognitive impairment and aging has become one of 
the common and important complications of diabetes mellitus, which seriously 
affects the quality of life of the patients, and imposes a heavy burden on the 
patients' families and the society. Currently, there are no special measures for 
the treatment of cognitive impairment and aging in type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
Therefore, the search for potential biological markers of type 2 diabetes 
mellitus combined with cognitive impairment and aging is of great significance 
for future precisive treatment. We downloaded three gene expression datasets 
from the GEO database: GSE161355 (related to T2D with cognitive impairment and 
aging), GSE122063, and GSE5281 (related to Alzheimer's disease). Differentially 
expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, followed by gene set enrichment analysis 
(GSEA). A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using the 
STRING database, and the top 15 hub genes were identified using the CytoHubba 
plugin in Cytoscape. Core genes were ultimately determined using three machine 
learning methods: LASSO regression, Support Vector Machine Recursive Feature 
Elimination (SVM-RFE), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). The diagnostic 
performance of these genes was assessed using ROC curve analysis and validated 
in an independent dataset (GSE5281). Regulatory genes related to ferroptosis 
were screened from the FerrDb database, and their biological functions were 
further explored through GO and KEGG enrichment analyses. Finally, the CIBERSORT 
algorithm was used to analyze immune cell infiltration, and the correlation 
between core genes and immune cell infiltration levels was calculated, leading 
to the construction of an mRNA-miRNA regulatory network. In the GSE161355 and 
GSE122063 datasets, 217 common DEGs were identified. GSEA analysis revealed 
their enrichment in the PI3K-PLC-TRK signaling pathway, TP53 regulation of 
metabolic genes pathway, Notch signaling pathway, among others. PPI network 
analysis identified 15 candidate core genes, and further selection using LASSO, 
LDA, and SVM-RFE machine learning algorithms resulted in 6 core genes: BCL6, 
TP53, HSP90AA1, CRYAB, IL1B, and DNAJB1. ROC curve analysis indicated that these 
genes had good diagnostic performance in the GSE161355 dataset, with TP53 and 
IL1B achieving an AUC of 0.9, indicating the highest predictive accuracy. BCL6, 
HSP90AA1, CRYAB, and DNAJB1 also had AUCs greater than 0.8, demonstrating 
moderate predictive accuracy. Validation in the independent dataset GSE5281 
showed that these core genes also had good diagnostic performance in Alzheimer's 
disease samples (AUC > 0.6). Ferroptosis-related analysis revealed that IL1B and 
TP53 play significant roles in apoptosis and immune response. Immune cell 
infiltration analysis showed that IL1B is significantly positively correlated 
with infiltration levels of monocytes and NK cells, while TP53 is significantly 
negatively correlated with infiltration levels of follicular helper T cells. The 
construction of the miRNA-mRNA regulatory network suggested that miR-150a-5p 
might play a key role in the regulation of T2D-associated cognitive impairment 
and aging by TP53. This study, by integrating bioinformatics and machine 
learning methods, identified BCL6, TP53, HSP90AA1, CRYAB, IL1B, and DNAJB1 as 
potential diagnostic biomarkers for T2D with cognitive impairment and aging, 
with a particular emphasis on the significance of TP53 and IL1B in immune cell 
infiltration. These findings not only enhance our understanding of the molecular 
mechanisms linking type 2 diabetes to cognitive impairment and aging, providing 
new targets for early diagnosis and treatment, but also offer new directions and 
targets for basic research.

Alzheimer disease (AD) is among the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases 
globally, marked by cognitive and behavioral disruptions. Ferroptosis is a form 
of controlled cell death characterized by intracellular iron accumulation 
associated with lipid peroxide formation, which subsequently promotes AD 
initiation and progression. We hypothesized that targeting the ferroptosis 
pathway may help in AD management. Therefore, our study aimed to evaluate the 
potential neuroprotective effect of the antifungal Ciclopirox olamine (CPX-O) 
that acts through iron chelation. We employed CPX-O separately or in combination 
with the JNK inhibitor (SP600125) in a mice model of AlCl3-induced AD. Animals 
underwent examination for behavioral, biochemical, histological, and 
immunohistochemical findings. Our results revealed that AlCl3 was associated 
with disruptions in learning and memory parameters, neuronal degeneration in the 
hippocampus, increased immunoreactivity of amyloid-β and tau proteins, a 
significant rise in iron, nitric oxide (NO), malondialdehyde (MDA), JNK, and P53 
levels, along with the significant decrease in glutathione peroxidase activity. 
Interestingly, the administration of CPX-O alone or in combination with SP600125 
in the AlCl3-induced AD model caused an improvement in the previously described 
examination findings. Therefore, CPX-O may be a promising candidate for AD 
treatment, and future clinical trials will be required to confirm these 
preclinical findings.

Metformin is one of the most commonly used oral hypoglycemic drugs in clinical 
practice, with unique roles in neurodegeneration and vascular lesions. 
Neurodegeneration and vasculopathy coexist in many diseases and typically affect 
the neurovascular unit (NVU), a minimal structural and functional unit in the 
central nervous system. Its components interact with one another and are 
indispensable for maintaining tissue homeostasis. This review focuses on retinal 
(diabetic retinopathy, retinitis pigmentosa) and cerebral (ischemic stroke, 
Alzheimer's disease) diseases to explore the effects of metformin on the NVU. 
Metformin has a preliminarily confirmed therapeutic effect on the retinal NUV, 
affecting many of its components, such as photoreceptors (cones and rods), 
microglia, ganglion, Müller, and vascular endothelial cells. Since it rapidly 
penetrates the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and accumulates in the brain, metformin 
also has an extensively studied neuronal protective effect in neuronal diseases. 
Its mechanism affects various NVU components, including pericytes, astrocytes, 
microglia, and vascular endothelial cells, mainly serving to protect the BBB. 
Regulating the inflammatory response in NVU (especially neurons and microglia) 
may be the main mechanism of metformin in improving central nervous system 
related diseases. Metformin may be a potential drug for treating diseases 
associated with NVU deterioration, however, more trials are needed to validate 
its timing, duration, dose, clinical effects, and side effects.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate how Wii Fit exercises affect muscle 
strength and fear of falling in older adults with Alzheimer's disease.
METHOD: The study included a total of 32 volunteers with Alzheimer's disease, 
aged 65-80 years. These participants were divided into two groups: the exercise 
group and the control group. The exercise group received a 30-min (one session) 
twice-weekly exercise program for 6 weeks with games selected from different 
categories, such as balance and aerobic exercises, with the Nintendo Wii virtual 
reality device. During this period, the control group did not receive any 
treatment, and routine medical treatments continued. At baseline and 6 weeks 
later, Mini-Mental State Examination, knee extension muscle strength, Timed Up 
and Go Test, and Tinetti Fall Efficacy Scale results were recorded in the 
exercise and control groups.
RESULTS: In intragroup comparison, a statistically significant difference was 
found in all tests (muscle strength, Timed Up and Go Test, and Tinetti Fall 
Efficacy Scale) in the exercise group after the exercise program (p < .05), 
while no significant difference was found in the control group (p > .05). 
According to the interaction of group and time in the intergroup comparison, 
there was no difference between the groups (exercise and control group) in 
muscle strength and Timed Up and Go Test (p > .05), but there was a difference 
in Tinetti Fall Efficacy Scale (p < .05).
CONCLUSIONS: This randomized controlled trial supports the claim that Wii Fit 
exercises can reduce the fear of falling in older adults with Alzheimer's 
disease.

The Renin Angiotensin System (RAS) plays a pathophysiological role in traumatic 
brain injury (TBI) but the evidence of its involvement in mild TBI (mTBI) is 
still limited. We aimed at investigating the levels of components from both the 
classical and counter-regulatory axis of the RAS in a mTBI animal model. Mice 
with mTBI displayed enhanced ACE/Ang II/AT1R axis ipsilateral- and 
contralaterally to the trauma in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex during 
acute (24 and 72 h) and later (30 days) timepoints. Increase in Ang-(1-7) levels 
alongside reduction in Mas receptor expression in hippocampus and prefrontal 
cortex was also observed after injury. Conversely, mTBI-mice presented higher 
expression of AT2 receptor in the contralateral hippocampus and the ipsilateral 
prefrontal cortex. Importantly, treatment with telmisartan, an AT1R blocker, and 
perindopril, an ACE inhibitor, were able to prevent mTBI-associated locomotor 
activity impairment and anxiety-like behavior, corroborating the involvement of 
RAS in the pathophysiology of mTBI. We provided original evidence that 
components of classical and alternative RAS axes undergo alterations in key 
brain areas following a mTBI in a time and hemisphere dependent manner. Our 
findings also open new avenues for investigating the therapeutic potential of 
RAS components in mTBI.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Hyperhomocysteinemia (Hhcy) is a pathological condition 
marked by increased level of homocysteine and serves as an independent risk 
factor for a range of diseases including cardiovascular diseases and Alzheimer's 
disease. This study aims to examine alterations in Hhcy-related metabolites 
using serum metabolomics and unravel the distinct metabolic pathways involved, 
thereby offering a theoretical foundation for the early prevention and treatment 
of Hhcy.
METHODS: Serum samples were collected from 56 individuals with Hhcy and 44 
healthy controls. Metabolic alterations in Hhcy were assessed through 
multi-platform serum metabolomics analyses. Through multivariate statistical 
analysis and regression modeling, distinct metabolites in the serum were 
identified, and various metabolic pathways associated with Hhcy were 
investigated.
RESULTS: Our findings revealed 21 significant different metabolites that 
distinguished Hhcy from healthy controls. These varied metabolites primarily 
comprised 10 organic acids, 4 amino acids, 2 fatty acids, and 5 other 
metabolites. The key differential metabolic pathways identified were the TCA 
cycle, pyruvate metabolism, arginine biosynthesis, as well as alanine, 
aspartate, and glutamate metabolism.
CONCLUSIONS: This study elucidated the variances in metabolic profiles between 
Hhcy and healthy control groups, highlighting distinct metabolic pathways that 
may help explain the etiology of Hhcy. These findings offer valuable insights to 
address the knowledge gaps related to the metabolic alterations associated with 
Hhcy.

Berberine and palmatine are isoquinoline quaternary alkaloids derived from 
Chinese medicinal herbs. These alkaloids have shown promising synergy in 
inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE), indicating their potential in treating 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Besides, the anti-inflammatory effects of berberine 
and palmatine have been widely reported, although the underlying mechanism 
remains unclear. Here, we found that berberine and palmatine could induce 
calcium ion (Ca2+) influx via activating α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7 
nAChR) in cultured microglial cells, possibly serving as its allosteric 
potential ligands. Furthermore, we examined the synergistic anti-inflammatory 
effects of berberine and palmatine in the LPS-induced microglia, that 
significantly suppressed the production of TNF-α and iNOS. Notably, this 
suppression was reversed by co-treatment with a selective antagonist of α7 
nAChR. Moreover, the alkaloid-induced microglial phagocytosis was shown to be 
mediated by the induction of Ca2+ influx through α7 nAChR and subsequent 
CaMKII-Rac1-dependent pathway. Additionally, the combination of berberine and 
palmatine, at low concentration, protected against the LPS-induced endoplasmic 
reticulum stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in microglia. These findings 
indicate the potential of berberine and palmatine, either individually or in 
combination, in contributing to anti-AD drug development, which provide valuable 
insights into the mechanisms by which natural products, such as plant alkaloids, 
exert their anti-AD effects.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial neurological disorder that involves 
multiple enzymes in the process of developing. Conventional monotherapies 
provide relief, necessitating alternative multi-targeting approaches to address 
AD complexity. Therefore, we synthesize N-(benzo[d]thiazol-2-yl) benzamide-based 
compounds and tested against monoamine oxidases (MAO-A and MAO-B). In the in 
vitro experimental evaluation of MAO, all the compounds displayed remarkable 
potency, having IC50 values in the lower micromolar range. The most potent MAO-A 
inhibitor was (3e) with an IC50 value of 0.92 ± 0.09 μM, whereas, (3d) was the 
most potent inhibitor of MAO-B with an IC50 value of 0.48 ± 0.04 μM. Moreover, 
Enzyme kinetics studies revealed that the potent inhibitors of MAO-A and MAO-B 
showed competitive mode of inhibition. Furthermore, molecular docking studies 
were also performed to confirm the mode of inhibition and obtain an intuitive 
picture of potent inhibitors. It also revealed several important interactions, 
particularly hydrogen bonding interaction. All the newly synthesized compounds 
showed good ADME pharmacokinetic profile and followed Lipinski rule; these 
compounds represent promising hits for the development of promising lead 
compounds for AD treatment.

The incidence of Alzheimer's is increasing and poses a significant social and 
economic burden. The pathogenesis involved in the expansion of AD includes 
neuronal oxidative damage, tau phosphorylation, amyloid beta aggregation, 
neuroinflammation, etc. Despite enormous efforts, there is currently no 
effective treatment or cure for this condition in the allopathic system. Marine 
compounds are appealing options and have a strong neuroprotective impact. 
Marine-derived compounds from sponges, algae, and marine invertebrates can be 
used for neuroprotection, with fewer adverse effects than synthetic drugs. 
Various compounds such as bryostatin-1, docosahexaenoic acid, spirolides, and 
astaxanthin, GV-971, have demonstrated outstanding activity and bioavailability.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to investigate sex differences in the 
relationship between sleep quality (self-report and objective) and cognitive 
function across three domains (executive function, verbal memory, and attention) 
in older adults.
METHODS: We analyzed cross-sectional data from 207 participants with normal 
cognition (NC) or mild cognitive impairment (89 males and 118 females) aged over 
60 years. The relationship between sleep quality and cognitive performance was 
estimated using generalized additive models. Objective sleep was measured with 
the GT9X Link ActiGraph, and self-reported sleep was measured with the 
Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.
RESULTS: We found that females exhibited lower executive function with increased 
objective total sleep time, with a steeper decline in performance after 400 
minutes (p = .015). Additionally, longer objective sleep correlated with lower 
verbal memory linearly (p = .046). In males, a positive linear relationship 
emerged between objective sleep efficiency and executive function (p = .036). 
Self-reported sleep was not associated with cognitive performance in females and 
males with NC. However, in males with cognitive impairment, there was a 
nonlinear positive relationship between self-reported sleep and executive 
function (p < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the association between sleep parameters 
on cognition varies between older males and females, with executive function 
being most strongly associated with objective sleep for both sexes top of form. 
Interventions targeting sleep quality to mitigate cognitive decline in older 
adults may need to be tailored according to sex, with distinct approaches for 
males and females.

INTRODUCTION: Holistic phenotyping of rodent models is increasing, with a 
growing awareness of the 3Rs and the fact that specialized experimental setups 
can also impose artificial restrictions. Activity is an important parameter for 
almost all basic and applied research areas involving laboratory animals. 
Locomotor activity, the main form of energy expenditure, influences metabolic 
rate, muscle mass, and body weight and is frequently investigated in metabolic 
disease research. Additionally, it serves as an indicator of animal welfare in 
therapeutic, pharmacological, and toxicological studies. Thus, accurate and 
effective measurement of activity is crucial. However, conventional monitoring 
systems often alter the housing environment and require handling, which can 
introduce artificial interference and lead to measurement inaccuracies.
METHODS: Our study focused on evaluating circadian activity profiles derived 
from the DVC and comparing them with conventional activity measurements to 
validate them statistically and assess their reproducibility. We utilized data 
from metabolic studies, an Alzheimer's disease model known for increased 
activity, and included DVC monitoring in a project investigating treatment 
effects on activity in a type-1-like diabetes model.
RESULTS: The DVC data yielded robust, scientifically accurate, and consistent 
circadian profiles from group-housed mice, which is particularly advantageous 
for longitudinal experiments. The activity profiles from both systems were fully 
comparable, providing matching profiles. Using DVC monitoring, we confirmed the 
hyperactivity phenotype in an AD model and reproduced a decline in activity in 
type-1-like diabetes model.
DISCUSSION: In our work, we derived robust circadian activity profiles from the 
DVC data of group-housed mice, which were scientifically accurate, reproducible 
and comparable to another activity measurement. This approach can not only 
improve animal welfare according to the 3R principles but can also be implement 
in high-throughput longitudinal studies. Furthermore, we discuss the advantages 
and limitations of DVC activity measurements to highlight its potential and 
avoid confounders.

INTRODUCTION: The pathophysiological mechanism of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has 
not been clearly identified, and effective treatment methods have not yet been 
established. Scopolamine causes cholinergic dysfunction in the brain, including 
the accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques, thereby increasing oxidative stress 
and neuroinflammation, mimicking AD. Glial cells such as astrocytes have 
recently been identified as possible biomarkers for AD. Photobiomodulation (PBM) 
elicits a beneficial biological response in cells and tissues. PBM effects on 
the central nervous system (CNS) have been widely researched, including effects 
on astrocyte activity.
METHODS: In the present study, PBM was performed using light at the 
near-infrared wavelength of 825 nm. The Morris water maze and Y-maze tests were 
employed to evaluate cognitive function decline in a scopolamine-induced memory 
dysfunction model and its improvement with PBM. In addition, alteration of the 
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and immunofluorescence 
expression levels of active astrocytes were observed in the hippocampus, which 
is one of the areas affected by AD, to evaluate the mechanism of action of PBM.
RESULTS: A reduction in the neuronal cell death in the hippocampus caused by 
scopolamine was observed with PBM. Moreover, alteration of a MAPK 
pathway-related marker and changes in glial fibrillary acidic protein (an active 
astrocyte marker) expression were observed in the PBM-treated group. Finally, 
significant correlations between functional and histological results were found, 
validating the results.
DISCUSSION: These findings indicate the possibility of behavioral and 
histological improvement due to PBM in scopolamine-induced CNS alteration, which 
mimics AD. This improvement could be related to neuroinflammatory modulation and 
altered astrocyte activity.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by 
progressive cognitive degeneration and motor impairment, affecting millions 
worldwide. Mapping the progression of AD is crucial for early detection of loss 
of brain function, timely intervention, and development of effective treatments. 
However, accurate measurements of disease progression are still challenging at 
present. This study presents a novel approach to understanding the heterogeneous 
pathways of AD through longitudinal biomarker data from medical imaging and 
other modalities. We propose an analytical pipeline adopting two popular machine 
learning methods from the single-cell transcriptomics domain, PHATE and 
Slingshot, to project multimodal biomarker trajectories to a low-dimensional 
space. These embeddings serve as our pseudotime estimates. We applied this 
pipeline to the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset to 
align longitudinal data across individuals at various disease stages. Our 
approach mirrors the technique used to cluster single-cell data into cell types 
based on developmental timelines. Our pseudotime estimates revealed distinct 
patterns of disease evolution and biomarker changes over time, providing a 
deeper understanding of the temporal dynamics of AD. The results show the 
potential of the approach in the clinical domain of neurodegenerative diseases, 
enabling more precise disease modeling and early diagnosis.

Neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Mild Cognitive 
Impairment (MCI) significantly impact brain function and cognition. Advanced 
neuroimaging techniques, particularly Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), play a 
crucial role in diagnosing these conditions by detecting structural 
abnormalities. This study leverages the ADNI and OASIS datasets, renowned for 
their extensive MRI data, to develop effective models for detecting AD and MCI. 
The research conducted three sets of tests, comparing multiple groups: 
multi-class classification (AD vs. Cognitively Normal (CN) vs. MCI), binary 
classification (AD vs. CN, and MCI vs. CN), to evaluate the performance of 
models trained on ADNI and OASIS datasets. Key preprocessing techniques such as 
Gaussian filtering, contrast enhancement, and resizing were applied to both 
datasets. Additionally, skull stripping using U-Net was utilized to extract 
features by removing the skull. Several prominent deep learning architectures 
including DenseNet-201, EfficientNet-B0, ResNet-50, ResNet-101, and ResNet-152 
were investigated to identify subtle patterns associated with AD and MCI. 
Transfer learning techniques were employed to enhance model performance, 
leveraging pre-trained datasets for improved Alzheimer's MCI detection. 
ResNet-101 exhibited superior performance compared to other models, achieving 
98.21% accuracy on the ADNI dataset and 97.45% accuracy on the OASIS dataset in 
multi-class classification tasks encompassing AD, CN, and MCI. It also performed 
well in binary classification tasks distinguishing AD from CN. ResNet-152 
excelled particularly in binary classification between MCI and CN on the OASIS 
dataset. These findings underscore the utility of deep learning models in 
accurately identifying and distinguishing neurodegenerative diseases, showcasing 
their potential for enhancing clinical diagnosis and treatment monitoring.

Emerging evidence suggests that the genetic architecture of Alzheimer's (AD) and 
Parkinson's diseases (PD) risk varies across ancestries. This study seeks to 
explore distinct and universal genetic targets across individuals of Latino, 
African/African Admixed, East Asian, and European populations by implementing 
Population Attributable Risk (PAR) comparisons on summary statistics from 
genome-wide association studies (GWAS). PAR was calculated for the most 
significant disease variants using summary statistics derived from select 
multi-ancestry GWAS meta-analyses, followed by fine-mapping analysis to validate 
genetic contribution of disease variants to European, African/African Admixed, 
East Asian, and Latino individuals. For both AD, APOE4 PAR estimates were 
universally high across all ancestries, with TSPAN14 and PICALM emerging as 
other common targets. Attributable risk varied across PD-related major risk loci 
including variation nearby GBA1 and LRRK2. In contrast, SNCA, MCCC1, VPS13C, and 
MAPT loci demonstrated comparable attributable risk across ancestries. This 
cross-ancestry evaluation of PAR reinforces the genetic heterogeneity of AD and 
PD. In consideration of the complex etiology of these diseases, these findings 
may inform the strategic prioritization of therapeutic targets and improve 
global health outcomes.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are influenced by genetic 
and environmental factors. Using data from UK Biobank, SAIL Biobank, and 
FinnGen, we conducted an unbiased, population-scale study to: 1) Investigate how 
155 endocrine, nutritional, metabolic, and digestive system disorders are 
associated with AD and PD risk prior to their diagnosis, considering known 
genetic influences; 2) Assess plasma biomarkers' specificity for AD or PD in 
individuals with these conditions; 3) Develop a multi-modal classification model 
integrating genetics, proteomics, and clinical data relevant to conditions 
affecting the gut-brain axis. Our findings show that certain disorders elevate 
AD and PD risk before AD and PD diagnosis including: insulin and non-insulin 
dependent diabetes mellitus, noninfective gastro-enteritis and colitis, 
functional intestinal disorders, and bacterial intestinal infections, among 
others. Polygenic risk scores revealed lower genetic predisposition to AD and PD 
in individuals with co-occurring disorders in the study categories, underscoring 
the importance of regulating the gut-brain axis to potentially prevent or delay 
the onset of neurodegenerative diseases. The proteomic profile of AD/PD cases 
was influenced by comorbid endocrine, nutritional, metabolic, and digestive 
systems conditions. Importantly, we developed multi-modal prediction models 
integrating clinical, genetic, proteomic and demographic data, the combination 
of which performs better than any single paradigm approach in disease 
classification. This work aims to illuminate the intricate interplay between 
various physiological factors involved in the gut-brain axis and the development 
of AD and PD, providing a multifactorial systemic understanding that goes beyond 
traditional approaches. Further, we have developed an interactive resource for 
the scientific community [https://gut-brain-nexus.streamlit.app/] where 
researchers can investigate components of the predictive model and can 
investigate feature effects on a sample level.

A Qualitative Study of People with Alzheimer's Disease in a Memory Clinic 
Considering Lecanemab Treatment.

BACKGROUND: People with Alzheimer's disease (AD) now have access to 
disease-modifying treatment with anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). 
Their perception of risks and benefits and approach to treatment decisions 
remain unknown.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to understand how people with AD weigh the benefits and 
costs of anti-amyloid mAbs and incorporate these into decisions about treatment.
METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews with people with biomarker- or 
imaging-confirmed AD and mild or moderate cognitive impairment who were seen at 
memory care clinics and discussed lecanemab with a clinician. Interviews were 
recorded, transcribed, and deidentified. Thematic analysis identified themes and 
subthemes.
RESULTS: Among 22 participants (mean age 70, 8 [36%] women, 22 [100%] White), 
analysis revealed 3 major themes and associated subthemes: 1) People with AD 
sought and obtained information from different sources-advocacy organizations, 
the Internet, and clinicians; 2) Hopes, expected benefits, and the existential 
threat of dementia drove willingness and readiness to start lecanemab; 3) 
Individual traits, family factors, and degree of trust in expertise influenced 
how people balanced risks and benefits. Some would accept treatment at any cost; 
others carefully weighed risks and burdens, but were motivated by supportive 
families, insurance coverage, and trust in expertise; for a few, costs decidedly 
outweighed their personal benefits. People with AD desired more individualized 
information and to hear more from patients who took the medication.
CONCLUSION: Results from this first qualitative study of people with AD 
considering treatment with anti-amyloid mAbs can inform clinician, health system 
and policy efforts to individualize decisions.

Subcortical brain structures are involved in developmental, psychiatric and 
neurological disorders. We performed GWAS meta-analyses of intracranial and nine 
subcortical brain volumes (brainstem, caudate nucleus, putamen, hippocampus, 
globus pallidus, thalamus, nucleus accumbens, amygdala and, for the first time, 
the ventral diencephalon) in 74,898 participants of European ancestry. We 
identified 254 independent loci associated with these brain volumes, explaining 
up to 35% of phenotypic variance. We observed gene expression in specific neural 
cell types across differentiation time points, including genes involved in 
intracellular signalling and brain ageing-related processes. Polygenic scores 
for brain volumes showed predictive ability when applied to individuals of 
diverse ancestries. We observed causal genetic effects of brain volumes with 
Parkinson's disease and ADHD. Findings implicate specific gene expression 
patterns in brain development and genetic variants in comorbid neuropsychiatric 
disorders, which could point to a brain substrate and region of action for risk 
genes implicated in brain diseases.

Aging is the primary risk factor for cognitive decline, impacting multiple 
cognitive domains and significantly elevating the risk of conditions such as 
mild cognitive impairment and dementia. In addition to aging, several diseases 
contribute to cognitive decline. Alzheimer's disease, a progressive 
neurodegenerative disorder, leads to the loss of neurons and synapses in the 
brain, resulting in a profound decline in cognitive abilities and functional 
capacity. Several studies provide compelling evidence that modifiable lifestyle 
factors play a crucial role in influencing cognitive health. Adopting healthier 
behaviors has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of cognitive decline. 
Genetic factors also play a crucial role in cognitive decline, with several 
genes being identified that influence the risk of developing conditions like 
Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Long-term use of opioids and cocaine is 
also associated with cognitive decline, affecting functions such as memory and 
executive processes. Understanding the factors contributing to cognitive decline 
in aging and disease is essential for developing strategies to mitigate its 
impact. The drugs available to treat patients with cognitive decline due to 
advanced aging and drug abuse are also summarize.

[Anti-Amyloid Antibody Therapy for Alzheimer's Disease].

[Article in Japanese]

Sciences.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is pathologically characterized by deposition of 
amyloid plaques (comprising amyloid β [Aβ] protein) and neurofibrillary tangles 
(comprising tau protein), and neuronal death. Aβ monomers aggregate to form 
oligomers, protofibrils, and mature fibrils. Previously, the mature fibrils and 
plaques were implicated as contributors to neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration. 
However, a growing body of evidence proves stronger toxicity of oligomers and 
protofibrils. Among the many recent phase 3 clinical trials that have 
investigated the role of anti-Aβ antibodies in AD, some have shown the clinical 
efficacy of aducanumab, lecanemab, and donanemab in these patients. Lecanemab 
showed selectivity towards protofibrils over fibrils, and donanemab was 
specifically directed against Aβ only in brain-specific amyloid plaques. In 
contrast, other anti-Aβ antibodies did not show efficacy in AD.

Cognitive impairment is a typical symptom of both neurodegenerative and certain 
other diseases. In connection with these different pathologies, the etiology and 
neurological and metabolic changes associated with cognitive impairment must 
differ. Until these characteristics and differences are understood in greater 
detail, pharmacological treatment of the different forms of cognitive impairment 
remains suboptimal. Neurotransmitter receptors, including neuronal nicotinic 
acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), dopamine receptors, and glutamine receptors, 
play key roles in the functions and metabolisms of the brain. Among these, the 
role of nAChRs in the development of cognitive impairment has attracted more and 
more attention. The present review summarizes what is presently known concerning 
the structure, distribution, metabolism, and function of nAChRs, as well as 
their involvement in major cognitive disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, 
Parkinson's disease, vascular dementia, schizophrenia, and diabetes mellitus. As 
will be discussed, the relevant scientific literature reveals clearly that the 
α4β2 and α7 nAChR subtypes and/or subunits of the receptors play major roles in 
maintaining cognitive function and in neuroprotection of the brain. Accordingly, 
focusing on these as targets of drug therapy can be expected to lead to 
breakthroughs in the treatment of cognitive disorders such as AD and 
schizophrenia.

The activated M1-like microglia induced neuroinflammation is the critical 
pathogenic event in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Microglial polarization from 
pro-inflammatory M1 toward anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype is a promising 
strategy. To efficiently accomplish this, amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregates as the 
culprit of M1 microglia activation should be uprooted. Interestingly, this study 
finds out that the self-reassembly of curcumin molecules into carrier-free 
curcumin nanoparticles (CNPs) exhibits multivalent binding with Aβ to achieve 
higher inhibitory effect on Aβ aggregation, compared to free curcumin with 
monovalent effect. Based on this, the CNPs loaded cardiolipin liposomes are 
developed for efficient microglial polarization. After intranasal 
administration, the liposomes decompose to release CNPs and cardiolipin in 
response to AD oxidative microenvironment. The CNPs inhibit Aβ aggregation and 
promote Aβ phagocytosis/clearance in microglia, removing roadblock to microglial 
polarization. Subsequently, CNPs are endocytosed by microglia and inhibit 
TLR4/NF-κB pathway for microglia polarization (M1→M2). Meanwhile, cardiolipin is 
identified as signaling molecule to normalize microglial dysfunction to prevent 
pro-inflammatory factors release. In AD transgenic mice, neuroinflammation, Aβ 
burden, and memory deficits are relieved after treatment. Through combined 
attack by extracellularly eradicating roadblock of Aβ aggregation and 
intracellularly inhibiting inflammation-related pathways, this nanotechnology 
assisted delivery system polarizes microglia efficiently, providing a reliable 
strategy in AD treatment.

In the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the amyloid hypothesis, 
which posits that amyloid β-protein (Aβ) abnormally aggregates and damages 
neurons with tau, has been proposed. It was originally thought that the 
accumulation of insoluble amyloid fibrils in the brain leads to AD-inducing 
neurotoxicity; however, in recent years, the positioning of early and 
intermediate aggregates has also been emphasized. In particular, following the 
positive results of phase 3 clinical trials of lecanemab and its approval in 
Japan and the United States, the pathology of protofibrils, which are the target 
molecules of lecanemab, has attracted attention. Using high-speed atomic force 
microscopy, we have previously reported that lecanemab, which has a high 
affinity for protofibrils, binds to and surrounds them. Donanemab, a recombinant 
monoclonal antibody that primarily targets fibrils composed of N3pG Aβ, has also 
attracted attention because of its efficacy in phase 3 clinical trials in 
patients with early stage AD.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are produced, secreted, and targeted by most human 
cells, including cells that compose nervous system tissues. EVs carry several 
types of biomolecules, such as lipids, proteins and microRNA, and can function 
as signaling agents in physiological and pathological processes. In this 
chapter, we will focus on EVs and their cargo secreted by brain cells, 
especially neurons and glia, and how these aspects are affected in pathological 
conditions. The chapter covers neurodegenerative disorders, including 
Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, as 
well as several psychiatric disorders, namely schizophrenia, autism spectrum 
disorder and major depressive disorder. This chapter also addresses other types 
of neurological dysfunctions, epilepsy and traumatic brain injury. EVs can cross 
the blood brain barrier, and thus brain EVs may be detected in more accessible 
peripheral tissue, such as circulating blood. Alterations in EV composition and 
contents can therefore impart valuable clues into the molecular etiology of 
these disorders, and serve biomarkers regarding disease prevalence, progression 
and treatment. EVs can also be used to carry drugs and biomolecules into brain 
tissue, considered as a promising drug delivery agent for neurological diseases. 
Therefore, although this area of research is still in its early development, it 
offers great potential in further elucidating and in treating neurological 
disorders.

Cells, pathogens, and other systems release extracellular vesicles (EVs). The 
particles promote intercellular communication and contain proteins, lipids, RNA 
and DNA. Initially considered to be cellular waste in the twentieth century, EVs 
were becoming recognized for their function in biological communication and 
control. EVs are divided into many subtypes: exosomes, microvesicles, and 
apoptotic bodies. Exosomes form in the late endosome/multivesicular body and are 
released when the compartments fuse with the plasma membrane. Microvesicles are 
generated by direct budding of the plasma membrane, whereas apoptotic bodies are 
formed after cellular apoptosis. The new guideline for EVs that describes 
alternate nomenclature for EVs. The particles modulate the immune response by 
affecting both innate and adaptive immunity, and their specific the structure 
allows them to be used as biomarkers to diagnose a variety of diseases. EVs have 
a wide range of applications, for example, delivery systems for medications and 
genetic therapies because of their ability to convey specific cellular material. 
In anti-tumor therapy, EVs deliver therapeutic chemicals to tumor cells. The EVs 
promote transplant compatibility and reduce organ rejection. Host-parasite 
interactions, therapeutic and diagnostic for cancer, cardiovascular disease, 
cardiac tissue regeneration, and the treatment of neurological diseases such as 
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. The study of EVs keeps on expanding, revealing new 
functions and beneficial options. EVs have the potential to change drug 
delivery, diagnostics, and specific therapeutics, creating a new frontier in 
biomedical.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic progressive, age-related neurodegenerative 
brain disorder characterized by the irreversible decline of memory and other 
cognitive functions. It is one of the major health threat of the 21st century, 
which affects around 60% of the population over the age of 60 years. The problem 
of this disease is even more major because the existing pharmacotherapies only 
provide symptomatic relief without addressing the basic factors of the disease. 
It is characterized by the extracellular deposition of amyloid β (Aβ) to form 
senile plaques, and the intracellular hyperphosphorylation of tau to form 
neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Due to the complex pathophysiology of this 
disease, various hypotheses have been proposed, including the cholinergic, Aβ, 
tau, oxidative stress, and the metal-ion hypothesis. Among these, the 
cholinergic and Aβ hypotheses are the primary targets for addressing AD. 
Therefore, continuous advances have been made in developing potential 
cholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists 
to delay disease progression and restore cholinergic neurotransmission. In this 
review article, we tried to comprehensively summarize the recent advancement in 
NMDA receptor antagonist (memantine) and their hybrid analogs as potential 
disease-modifying agents for the treatment of AD. Furthermore, we also depicted 
the design, rationale, and SAR analysis of the memantine-based hybrids used in 
the last decade for the treatment of AD.

In this review, we examine the role of oxidative stress in the pathophysiology 
of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Amyloid-beta (Aβ) induces damage not only 
extracellularly but also within the intracellular environment. Mitochondria, a 
principal source of free radicals, are closely associated with Aβ, as it binds 
to heme, thereby disrupting the normal electron flow in the respiratory chain. 
At the turn of the century, it was hypothesized that the majority, if not all, 
pathological events in AD are linked to free radical damage. Notably, free 
radicals also possess signaling capabilities that contribute to the disease's 
progression. A substantial body of evidence suggests that radical signaling is 
implicated in the relationship between amyloid-β and tau hyperphosphorylation. 
Antioxidant therapy represents a potential strategy to delay the progression 
from cognitive impairment to overt dementia. Enhancing endogenous antioxidant 
defenses, for instance, through polyphenol supplementation, offers a promising 
approach to partially prevent dementia onset, particularly in at-risk 
populations. Understanding the redox-related pathophysiology of AD opens new 
avenues for prevention and treatment, providing a source of hope in the fight 
against Alzheimer's Disease.

PURPOSE: Both retinal changes and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) have 
been shown to be associated with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias 
(ADRD). In AMD, the outer retina is impacted significantly and early, but little 
is known about its association with cognition or changes in brain morphometry. 
This study investigates the relationship between retinal and brain morphometry 
in older adults with early and intermediate AMD.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
METHODS: Adults ≥70 years with normal, early, and intermediate AMD were 
recruited from Callahan Eye Hospital Clinics at the University of Alabama at 
Birmingham. Participants underwent cognitive testing, optical coherence 
tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Associations of retinal layer 
thickness with brain volume and thickness of specific brain regions were 
evaluated utilizing multivariable linear regression. The relevance of retinal 
thickness variables in brain volumetrics was quantified using least absolute 
shrinkage and selection operator regression models. Correlations between 
demographic variables, cognitive scores, and brain morphometry were evaluated.
RESULTS: Participants with thinner outer retina had significantly smaller 
hippocampus (β = 0.019, P = .022), lower occipital cortex regions of interest 
(occipital ROIs) thickness (β = 5.68, P = .020), and lower cortical thickness in 
ADRD-related brain regions (β = 7.72, P = .006). People with thinner total 
retina had significantly lower occipital ROIs (β = 3.19, P = .009) and 
ADRD-related brain region (β = 3.94, P = .005) thickness. Outer retinal 
thickness in the outer Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study ring was 
the most frequently reported retinal variable associated with brain morphometry 
on least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression. Total gray matter 
volume showed positive correlations with education (Pearson's r = 0.30, P = 
.022).
CONCLUSIONS: In older adults with normal retinal aging and early and 
intermediate AMD, thinner outer retina had specific associations with brain 
regions primarily involved in vision and cognition, such as lower hippocampal 
volume and lower thickness of the occipital ROIs and brain regions known to show 
early structural changes in dementia.

Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the aggregation of β-amyloid, a 
pathological feature believed to drive the neuronal loss and cognitive decline 
commonly seen in the disease. Given the growing prevalence of this progressive 
neurodegenerative disease, understanding the exact mechanisms underlying this 
process has become a top priority. Microelectrode arrays are commonly used for 
chronic, non-invasive recording of both spontaneous and evoked neuronal activity 
from diverse in vitro disease models and to evaluate therapeutic or toxic 
compounds. To date, microelectrode arrays have been used to investigate 
β-amyloids' toxic effects, β-amyloids role in specific pathological features and 
to assess pharmacological approaches to treat Alzheimer's disease. The 
versatility of microelectrode arrays means these studies use a variety of 
methods and investigate different disease models and brain regions. This review 
provides an overview of these studies, highlighting their disparities and 
presenting the status of the current literature. Despite methodological 
differences, the current literature indicates that β-amyloid has an inhibitory 
effect on synaptic plasticity and induces network connectivity disruptions. 
β-amyloid's effect on spontaneous neuronal activity appears more complex. 
Overall, the literature corroborates the theory that β-amyloid induces 
neurotoxicity, having a progressive deleterious effect on neuronal signaling and 
plasticity. These studies also confirm that microelectrode arrays are valuable 
tools for investigating β-amyloid pathology from a functional perspective, 
helping to bridge the gap between cellular and network pathology and disease 
symptoms. The use of microelectrode arrays provides a functional insight into 
Alzheimer's disease pathology which will aid in the development of novel 
therapeutic interventions.

Type C hepatic encephalopathy (Type C HE) is a major and complex neurological 
condition that occurs following chronic liver failure. The molecular basis of 
Type C HE remains elusive. Type C HE is characterized by mental confusion, 
cognitive and motor disturbances. The presence of Alzheimer type II astrocytes 
(AT2A) is the key histopathological finding observed in Type C HE. However, 
nothing is currently known regarding AT2A development and its involvement in 
cognitive, and motor deficits in Type C HE. We, therefore, examined in rats the 
mechanisms by which liver failure contributes to the progression of AT2A, and 
its role in the development of cognitive and motor deficits in thioacetamide 
(TAA) model of Type C HE. We and others earlier reported increased 
oxidative/nitrosative stress (ONS), JNK1/2, and cMyc activation in 
ammonia-treated astrocyte cultures, as well as in brains from chronic liver 
failure. We now found increased levels of astrocytic glia maturation factor 
(GMF, a factor strongly implicated in neuroinflammation), as well as various 
inflammatory factors (IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, MMP-3, COX2, CXCL1, and PGE2), and 
reduced levels of GFAP and increased levels of aggregated nuclear protein Lamin 
A/C in rat brain cortex post-chronic liver failure. We also found increased 
levels of GMF and inflammatory factors (MMP-3, COX2, CXCL1, and PGE2) in 
astrocytes post-ammonia treatment in vitro. Additionally, pharmacological 
inhibition of upstream signaling of GMF (ONS, JNK1/2, and cMyc) or GMF 
inhibitors W-7 and trifluoperazine significantly reduced the levels of 
inflammatory factors, the number of AT2A cells, as well as the cognitive and 
motor deficits in TAA-treated rats. Increased levels of GMF were also identified 
in human post-mortem brain sections. These findings strongly suggest that 
increased levels of astrocytic GMF due to elevated levels of ONS, JNK1/2, and 
cMyc and the subsequent inflammation contribute to the development of AT2A and 
the consequent cognitive, and motor deficits in chronic liver failure.

People with intellectual disability are a vulnerable cohort who face challenges 
accessing health care. Compared with the general population, people with 
intellectual disability have an elevated risk of developing dementia, which 
often presents at a younger age and with atypical symptoms. The lifelong 
cognitive and functional difficulties faced by people with intellectual 
disability further complicate the diagnostic process. Specialised intellectual 
disability memory services and evaluation using reliable biomarkers of 
neurodegeneration are needed to improve diagnostic and prognostic certainty in 
this group. Inadequate specialist services and paucity of research on biomarkers 
in this population hinders progress and impedes the delivery of adequate health 
care. Although cerebrospinal fluid-based biomarkers and radiological biomarkers 
are used routinely in the evaluation of Alzheimer's disease in the general 
population, biological variation within the clinically heterogenous group of 
people with intellectual disability could affect the clinical utility of 
existing biomarkers. As disease-modifying therapies become available for the 
treatment of early Alzheimer's disease, and hopefully other neurodegenerative 
conditions in the future, biomarkers will serve as gatekeepers to establish the 
eligibility for such therapies. Inadequate representation of adults with 
intellectual disability in biomarker research will result in their exclusion 
from treatment with disease-modifying therapies, thus perpetuating the inequity 
in health care that is already faced by this group. The aim of this Series paper 
is to summarise current evidence on the application of biomarkers for 
Alzheimer's disease in a population with intellectual disability (that is not 
attributable to Down syndrome) and suspected cognitive decline.

Blood biomarkers have emerged as accessible, cost-effective, and highly 
promising tools for advancing the diagnostics of Alzheimer's disease. However, 
transitioning from cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers to blood biomarkers-eg, to 
verify amyloid β pathology-requires careful consideration. This Series paper 
highlights the main challenges in the implementation of blood biomarkers for 
Alzheimer's disease in different possible contexts of use. Despite the 
robustness of measuring blood biomarker concentrations, the widespread adoption 
of blood biomarkers requires rigorous standardisation efforts to address 
inherent challenges in diverse contexts of use. The challenges include 
understanding the effect of pre-analytical and analytical conditions, potential 
confounding factors, and comorbidities that could influence outcomes of blood 
biomarkers and their use in diverse populations. Additionally, distinct 
scenarios present their own specific challenges. In memory clinics, the 
successful integration of blood biomarkers in diagnostic tests will require 
well-established diagnostic accuracy and comprehensive assessments of the effect 
of blood biomarkers on the diagnostic confidence and patient management of 
clinicians. In primary care settings, and even more when implemented in 
population-based screening programmes for which no experience with any 
biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease currently exists, the implementation of blood 
biomarkers will be challenged by the need for education of primary care clinical 
staff and clear guidelines. However, despite the challenges, blood biomarkers 
hold great promise for substantially enhancing the diagnostic accuracy and 
effectively streamlining referral processes, leading to earlier diagnosis and 
access to treatments. The ongoing efforts that are shaping the integration of 
blood biomarkers across diverse clinical settings pave the way towards precision 
medicine in Alzheimer's disease.

on memory and cognitive impairment in scopolamine-induced Alzheimer's disease 
rats.

The progressive form of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurological condition 
marked by decline in older people's memory and cognition. Scopolamine is a 
behavioral technique that is frequently used to study cognitive disorders, such 
as Alzheimer's disease. This investigation aimed to determine the protective 
effects of ethanolic extracts derived from Sterculia guttata (ESG) on 
neurological & pathological changes induced by Scopolamine in rats with 
Alzheimer's. The ESG procured through a 48-hour hot maceration, followed by 
column chromatography, isolation and characterization using techniques such as 
FTIR, 1HNMR, 13CNMR and mass spectra. A flavonoid called Diosmin was identified 
in the extract. Rats were segregated into five groups: normal, scopolamine, 
scopolamine + Donepezil, scopolamine + ESG (200mg per kg orally), & scopolamine 
+ ESG (400mg per kg orally) for a study of 14 day duration. Memory & learning 
abilities were assessed using the rectangular maze and Cook's pole climbing 
model. Additionally, biochemical parameters and brain histology were analyzed. 
ESG treatment mitigated scopolamine-induced changes in acetylcholinesterase, 
dopamine, serotonin, glutamate, and GABA levels, suggesting neuroprotection. 
These findings propose that ethanolic extracts of Sterculia guttata (ESG) show 
promise as effective preventive or therapeutic agents due to their potential for 
neuroprotection & cognitive enhancement in AD.

INTRODUCTION: Nursing home (NH) residents with Alzheimer's disease or related 
dementias (ADRD) are at high risk for hospital transfer. We aimed to (1) 
describe characteristics and predictors of avoidable transfer of residents with 
ADRD and (2) explore how "what matters" influences the decision to transfer.
METHODS: We applied an exploratory, mixed methods design using data collected as 
part of a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services demonstration project. 
Advanced practice registered nurses documented retrospective details about 
nursing home (NH)-to-hospital transfers (n = 3687) from 16 NHs.
RESULTS: NH residents with ADRD had 1.22 times higher odds of having an 
avoidable NH-to-hospital transfer (odds ratio = 1.22; 95% confidence 
interval = 1.03, 1.45). Factors contributing to avoidable transfers were age, 
stage of ADRD, what matters to the resident and their family, changes in 
condition, and resources available in the NH.
DISCUSSION: These findings highlight the need for enhanced specificity in the 
discussion and documentation of resident and family preferences and continued 
investments in the NH workforce.
HIGHLIGHTS: This article reports on factors contributing to avoidable nursing 
home (NH)-to-hospital transfer of residents with Alzheimer's disease and related 
dementias (ADRD). The mixed methods design used in this study offers insight 
beyond what is possible using a single-method design. Using data collected from 
a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services demonstration project, advanced 
practice registered nurses documented retrospective details about NH-to-hospital 
transfers (n = 3687) of residents. NH residents with ADRD were more likely to 
have an avoidable NH-to-hospital transfer. Factors contributing to avoidable 
transfers were age, stage of ADRD, what matters to the resident and their 
family, changes in condition, and resources available in the NH. These findings 
highlight the need for enhanced specificity in discussion and documentation of 
resident and family preferences and continued investments in the NH workforce.

A brief history of events surrounding the conceptualization and original 
implementation of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) as a 
public-private partnership (PPP) is provided from the perspective of three 
individuals directly involved from the outset. Potential barriers and how they 
were addressed are summarized, especially the decision to make all data freely 
accessible in real-time. Decisions made at the beginning of ADNI are revisited 
in light of what has been learned over the past 20 years, especially the 
importance of the investment in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood measures and 
the commitment to data sharing. The key elements of ADNI's success from the 
authors' perspective are also summarized. HIGHLIGHTS: Informal interactions 
among colleagues were the beginning of something big. An NIH Director's personal 
decision on open data sharing has had perhaps the greatest impact of any single 
decision in the past several decades in terms of advancing clinical biomarker 
research. After 20 years, blood-based biomarkers of brain disease may soon take 
the place of brain imaging for purposes of diagnosis and drug development.

Diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses significant challenges to health care, 
often resulting in delayed or inadequate patient care. The clinical integration 
of blood-based biomarkers (BBMs) for AD holds promise in enabling early 
detection of pathology and timely intervention. However, several critical 
considerations, such as the lack of consistent guidelines for assessing 
cognition, limited understanding of BBM test characteristics, insufficient 
evidence on BBM performance across diverse populations, and the ethical 
management of test results, must be addressed for widespread clinical 
implementation of BBMs in the United States. The Global CEO Initiative on 
Alzheimer's Disease BBM Workgroup convened to address these challenges and 
provide recommendations that underscore the importance of evidence-based 
guidelines, improved training for health-care professionals, patient empowerment 
through informed decision making, and the necessity of community-based studies 
to understand BBM performance in real-world populations. Multi-stakeholder 
engagement is essential to implement these recommendations and ensure credible 
guidance and education are accessible to all stakeholders.

INTRODUCTION: We evaluated the efficacy and safety of brexpiprazole for the 
treatment of agitation in Alzheimer's dementia (AAD) in Japanese patients.
METHODS: This was a phase 2/3 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Patients with AAD were randomized to 
receive brexpiprazole 1 mg/day or 2 mg/day, or placebo (3:4:4) for 10 weeks.
RESULTS: For the primary endpoint (change in Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory 
[CMAI] total score from baseline to Week 10), both brexpiprazole 1 mg and 2 mg 
groups demonstrated statistically significant improvement versus placebo (2 mg: 
least squares [LS] mean difference -7.2 [95% confidence interval (CI): -10.0 to 
-4.3], p-value < 0.0001, 1 mg: LS mean difference -3.7 [95% CI: -6.8 to -0.7], 
p-value = 0.0175). The incidences of treatment-emergent adverse events reported 
in the brexpiprazole 1 mg, 2 mg, and placebo groups were 76.8%, 84.6%, and 
73.8%, respectively.
DISCUSSION: Brexpiprazole 1 mg/day and 2 mg/day for 10 weeks was efficacious and 
well tolerated.
HIGHLIGHTS: Brexpiprazole treatment for 10 weeks improved agitation in 
Alzheimer's dementia. The efficacy of brexpiprazole 1 mg/day has been confirmed 
for the first time. The incidence of adverse events was higher compared to the 
previous studies. Both brexpiprazole 1 mg/day and 2 mg/day were generally well 
tolerated.

INTRODUCTION: People with neurodegenerative disorders (ND) frequently face 
diagnostic delay and misdiagnosis. We investigated blood and cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) neurofilament light chain (NfL) to distinguish ND from primary psychiatric 
disorders (PPD), a common challenge in clinical settings.
METHODS: Plasma and CSF NfL levels were measured and compared between groups, 
adjusting for age, sex, and weight.
RESULTS: A total of 337 participants were included: 136 ND, 77 PPD, and 124 
Controls. Plasma NfL was 2.5-fold elevated in ND compared to PPD and had strong 
diagnostic performance (area under the curve, [AUC]: 0.86, 81%/85% 
specificity/sensitivity) that was comparable to CSF NfL (2-fold elevated, AUC: 
0.89, 95%/71% specificity/sensitivity). Diagnostic performance was especially 
strong in younger people (40- < 60 years). Additional findings were cutoffs 
optimized for sensitivity and specificity, and issues important for future 
clinical translation.
CONCLUSIONS: This study adds important evidence for a simple blood-based 
biomarker to assist as a screening test for neurodegeneration and distinction 
from PPD, in clinical settings.
HIGHLIGHTS: NfL levels were significantly higher in ND versus PPD. Plasma NfL 
showed strong diagnostic performance, comparable to CSF NfL, to distinguish ND 
from PPD. Diagnostic performance was higher in younger people, where diagnostic 
challenges are greater. Further research is needed on analytical and reference 
range factors, for clinical translation. These findings support a simple 
screening blood test for neurodegeneration.

The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) has fostered 
collaboration among researchers around the world, catalyzing innovation and 
accelerating progress in the field. In Latin America, this initiative advanced 
the validation and development of Alzheimer's disease biomarkers for the first 
time in our region. In 2011, as part of the international ADNI, Argentina-ADNI 
(Arg-ADNI) was founded. The following years were characterized by strong support 
from entities such as the Alzheimer's Association, transforming into the 
emergence of several multinational studies focusing on prevention and diagnosis, 
and treatment of dementias. These studies are heirs to the tradition of 
Arg-ADNI: the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network, Latin American Initiative 
for Lifestyle Intervention to Prevent Cognitive Decline, Longitudinal 
Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease Study, and Initiative for the Study of Down 
Syndrome and Alzheimer's Disease. These initiatives have contributed 
significantly to the development of regional research and serve as essential 
tools for health policy planning in Latin America. HIGHLIGHTS: In Latin America, 
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) advanced the validation 
and development of Alzheimer's disease biomarkers for the first time in our 
region. ADNI has been the basis that boosted several multinational studies 
focusing on both prevention and diagnosis, and treatment of dementias 
(Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network, LatAm-FINGER, LEADS). These initiatives 
with the support from the Alzheimer's Association have contributed significantly 
to the development of regional research This is an example of collaboration 
between high-income countries with low- and middle-income countries aimed at 
global scientific development and inclusion.

BACKGROUND: Huanshaodan (HSD) is a Chinese Herbal Compound which has a definite 
clinical effect on Alzheimer's disease (AD), however, the underlying mechanism 
remains unclear. The aim of this study is to preliminarily reveal the mechanism 
of HSD in the treatment of AD model of SAMP8 mice.
METHODS: Chemical composition of HSD and its drug-containing serum were 
identified by Q-Orbitrap high resolution liquid mass spectrometry. Six-month-old 
SAMP8 mice were treated with HSD and Donepezil hydrochloride by gavage for 
2 months, and Wogonin for 28 days. Behavioral test was performed to test the 
learning and memory ability of mice. Immunofluorescence (IF) or Western-blot 
methods were used to detect the levels of pSer404-tau and β-amyloid (Aβ) in the 
brain of mice. Hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining and Transmission electron 
microscopy (TEM) assay was applied to observe the pathological changes of 
neurons. Proteomic technology was carried out to analyze and identify the 
protein network of HSD interventions in AD. Then the pathological process of the 
revealed AD-related differential proteins was investigated by IF, Q-PCR, 
Western-blot, Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and 16S rRNA sequencing 
methods.
RESULTS: The results showed that HSD and Wogonin, one of the components in its 
drug-containing serum, can effectively improve the cognitive impairments of 
SAMP8 mice, protect hippocampal neurons and synapses, and reduce the expression 
of pSer404-tau and Aβ. HSD and Wogonin reduced the levels of fibrinogen β chain 
(FGB) and γ chain (FGG), the potential therapeutic targets revealed by 
proteomics analysis, reduced the colocalization of FGB and FGG with Aβ, ionized 
calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba-1), glial fibrillary acidic protein 
(GFAP), increased level of and myelin basic protein (MBP). Meanwhile, HSD and 
Wogonin increased ZO-1 and Occludin levels, improved brain microvascular injury, 
and reduced levels of bacteria/bacterial DNA and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the 
brain of mice. In addition, 16S rRNA sequencing indicated that HSD regulated the 
structure of intestinal microbiota of mice.
CONCLUSION: The effects of HSD on AD may be achieved by inhibiting the levels of 
fibrinogen and the interactions on glia cells in the brain, and by modulating 
the structure of intestinal microbiota and improving the blood-brain barrier 
function.

The monoaminergic nuclei are thought to be some of the earliest sites of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology in the brain, with tau-containing pretangles 
appearing in these nuclei decades before the onset of clinical impairments. It 
has increasingly been recognized that monoamine systems represent a critical 
target of investigation towards understanding the progression of AD and 
designing early detection and treatment approaches. This review synthesizes 
evidence across animal studies, human neuropathology, and state-of-the-art 
neuroimaging and daily life assessment methods in humans, which demonstrate 
robust relationships between monoamine systems and AD pathophysiology and 
behavior. Further, the review highlights the promise of multimethod, multisystem 
approaches to studying monoaminergic mechanisms of resilience to AD pathology.

INTRODUCTION: It is unclear how early neuronal deficits occur in tauopathies, if 
these are associated with changes in neuronal network activity, and if they can 
be alleviated with therapies.
METHODS: To address this, we performed in vivo two-photon Ca2+ imaging in 
tauopathy mice at 6 versus 12 months, compared to controls, and treated the 
younger animals with a tau antibody.
RESULTS: Neuronal function was impaired at 6 months but did not deteriorate 
further at 12 months, presumably because cortical tau burden was comparable at 
these ages. At 6 months, neurons were mostly hypoactive, with enhanced neuronal 
synchrony, and had dysregulated responses to stimulus. Ex vivo, 
electrophysiology revealed altered synaptic transmission and enhanced 
excitability of motor cortical neurons, which likely explains the altered 
network activity. Acute tau antibody treatment reduced pathological tau and 
gliosis and partially restored neuronal function.
DISCUSSION: Tauopathies are associated with early neuronal deficits that can be 
attenuated with tau antibody therapy.
HIGHLIGHTS: Neuronal hypofunction in awake and behaving mice in early stages of 
tauopathy. Altered network activity disrupted local circuitry engagement in 
tauopathy mice. Enhanced neuronal excitability and altered synaptic transmission 
in tauopathy mice. Tau antibody acutely reduced soluble phospho-tau and improved 
neuronal function.

This study investigated the therapeutic effect of Conocarpus erectus leaves 
methanolic extract against AlCl3 -induced Alzheimer's disease (AD) in rats 
comparing with Donepezil-hydrochloride as a reference drug. The bioactive 
compounds of C. erectus leaves were isolated and identified by GC/MS and 
LC-ESI-MS analysis. Malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH), superoxide 
dismutase (SOD), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), 
amyloid-β-peptide (Aβ-peptide), tau protein, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), 
serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA) and nor-adrenaline (NE) levels were estimated. 
The neuromuscular strength, memory behavior and histopathological examination of 
cerebral cortex region were also conducted. Forty-three compounds were 
characterized from the non-polar fraction of C. erectus L. leaves extract and 
nineteen compounds were identified from the defatted extract. AlCl3- induction 
caused significant elevation of brain oxidative stress, Aβ-peptide, tau protein, 
IL-6, TNF-α and AChE levels. A significant decrease in 5-HT, ND and DA levels 
were noticed. Additionally, AlCl3 reduced neuromuscular strength and compromised 
memory function. Treatment of AlCl3- induced rats with C. erectuse extract 
ameliorated these selected parameters by variable degrees. In conclusion, C. 
erectus protects against AlCl3- induced AD in rats through its antioxidant, 
anti-inflammatory, and antineural damage. [Correction added on 3 December 2024, 
after first online publication: The term "antineutron" was corrected to 
"antineural" in the preceding sentence.]. It could be considered as a new 
nutraceutical agent for attenuating symptoms associated with Alzheimer's 
disease.

BACKGROUND: It is well known that rare cases of Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
pathology may cause corticobasal or posterior cortical atrophy syndromes, and 
that cases with advanced AD may develop parkinsonism. However, reports of 
parkinsonism as an initial manifestation of AD have rarely been documented.
OBJECTIVES: To demonstrate that a syndrome meeting all criteria for a clinical 
diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) may be an initial and 
years-long sustained manifestation of pathologically confirmed AD.
METHODS: Clinico-pathological case.
RESULTS: We present a case with a 12-year clinical presentation consistent with 
a typical course of idiopathic Parkinson's disease, including dementia 
developing 6 years after the PD diagnosis. The patient improved, but only 
mildly, to standard treatment for PD motor symptoms. The neuropathological 
examination identified AD changes, and no evidence to support a concomitant 
diagnosis of PD.
CONCLUSIONS: The absence of alpha-synucleinopathy, coupled with the patient's 
dementia history and AD changes in neuropathological examination, indicated the 
diagnosis of AD and no supplementary explanation. Neuronal loss with 
neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques in the brainstem, substantia nigra, 
and locus coeruleus likely contributed to Parkinsonism features.

Biomarkers have been instrumental in population selection and disease monitoring 
in clinical trials of recently FDA-approved drugs targeting amyloid-β to slow 
the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). As new therapeutic strategies and 
biomarker techniques emerge, the importance of biomarkers in drug development is 
growing exponentially. In this emerging landscape, biomarkers are expected to 
serve a wide range of contexts of use in clinical trials focusing on AD and 
related dementias. The joint FDA-NIH BEST (Biomarkers, EndpointS, and other 
Tools) framework provides standardised terminology to facilitate communication 
among stakeholders in this increasingly complex field. This review explores 
various applications of biomarkers relevant to AD clinical trials, using the 
BEST resource as a reference. For simplicity, we predominantly provide 
contextual characterizations of biomarkers use from the perspective of drugs 
targeting amyloid-β and tau proteins. However, general definitions and concepts 
can be extrapolated to other targets.

Advances in treatment are changing not only the therapeutic options for patients 
with Alzheimer's disease; they're also changing their diagnostic options. 
Technologies to detect amyloid such as PET imaging and blood or CSF testing now 
have a central role in Alzheimer's disease care. Notably, this role has been 
made possible by regulatory approval and coverage by payers of therapies. Access 
to treatments and the diagnostic tests needed to prescribe them is encourageing 
but it reveals a problem. These tests are tailored to the needs of the 
therapies, not to the needs of patients. Patients and families need to 
understand the causes of their impairments and their prognosis. This requires 
access to the best available diagnostic tests and this access should not depend 
on the availability of treatments. These tests should be used to their fullest 
capacity to inform patients of the causes of their cognitive impairments and 
their prognosis. Unfortunately, compared to diagnostic testing, treatment 
options are overvalued. We call this problem the tyranny of treatment.

BACKGROUND: Findings regarding the protective effect of Angiotensin II receptor 
blockers (ARBs) against Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) and 
cognitive decline have been inconclusive.
METHODS: Individuals with hypertension who do not have any prior ADRD diagnosis 
were included in this retrospective cohort study from Optum's de-identified 
Clinformatics® Data Mart. We identified antihypertensive medication (AHM) drug 
classes and subclassified ARBs by blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. We 
compared baseline characteristics and used the Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival curve 
and adjusted Cox proportional hazards (PH) model for survival analyses.
FINDINGS: From 6,390,826 individuals with hypertension, there were 1,839,176 ARB 
users, 3,366,841 non-ARB AHM users, and 1,184,809 AHM non-users. The unadjusted 
KM curve showed that ARB users had lower cumulative hazard than other AHM users 
or AHM non-users (P < 0.0001). In Cox PH analysis, ARB users showed a 20% lower 
adjusted hazard of developing ADRD compared to angiotensin-converting enzyme 
inhibitor (ACEI) users and a 29% and 18% reduced hazard when compared to 
non-ARB/ACEI AHM users and AHM non-users (all P < 0.0001). Consumption of 
BBB-crossing ARBs was linked to a lower hazard of ADRD development than 
non-BBB-crossing ARBs, undetermined ARBs, and non-consumption of AHMs by 11%, 
25%, and 31% (all P < 0.0001).
INTERPRETATION: This study suggests that ARBs are superior to ACEIs, 
non-ARB/ACEI AHMs, or non-use of AHMs in reducing the hazard of ADRD among 
patients with hypertension. Also, BBB-permeability in ARBs was associated with 
lower ADRD incidence. There is no cure for AD, ADRD, or vascular dementia; 
hence, these findings are significant in preventing those disorders in an 
inexpensive, convenient, and safe way. Limitations in claims data should be 
considered when interpreting our findings.

Mitochondrial dysfunction in microglia has been implicated as a key pathogenesis 
of most neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abnormal 
production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and neuroinflammation caused by 
mitochondrial oxidative stress are important factors leading to neuronal death 
in AD. Herein, a "dual brake" strategy to synergistically halt mitochondrial 
dysfunction and neuroinflammation targeting mitochondria in microglia is 
proposed. To achieve this goal, (3-carboxypropyl) triphenyl-phosphonium bromide 
(TPP)-modified Cu2-xSe nanozymes (Cu2-xSe-TPP NPs) with dual enzyme-like 
activities was designed. Cu2-xSe-TPP NPs with superoxide dismutase-mimetic (SOD) 
and catalase-mimetic (CAT) activities can effectively scavenge ROS in the 
mitochondria of microglia and relieve mitochondrial oxidative stress. In vivo 
studies demonstrated that Cu2-xSe-TPP NPs can alleviate oxidative stress and 
promote neuroprotection in the hippocampus of AD model mice. In addition, 
Cu2-xSe-TPP NPs can regulate the polarization of microglia from the 
pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype to the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype, promote Aβ 
phagocytosis and reshape the AD inflammatory microenvironment, thus effectively 
attenuating AD neuropathology and rescuing cognitive deficits in AD model mice. 
Taken together, this strategy preventing mitochondrial damage and remodeling the 
inflammatory microenvironment will provide a new perspective for AD therapy.

Embolization of a ruptured cystic artery pseudoaneurysm by percutaneous 
injection.

BackgroundPseudoaneurysm of the cystic artery is very rare. It usually presents 
with rupture and hemorrhagic shock, which may be life-threatening. 
Ultrasonography and contrast-enhanced tomography can be used for the diagnosis. 
The mainstay of treatment for this disease is cholecystectomy.ObjectiveHere we 
present an 86-year-old man with known diabetes and Alzheimer's disease whose 
pseudoaneurysm was treated with percutaneous thrombin injection and highlight 
the technical aspect of the procedure.MethodWith ultrasonography guidance, a 
21-gauge Chiba needle was passed through the liver and advanced into the 
pseudoaneurysm sac. A controlled, slow injection of 0.5-cc thrombin into the sac 
was performed with instant occlusion. Doppler imaging performed immediately 
following the procedure revealed that the pseudoaneurysm was not 
filled.ConclusionPseudoaneurysm of the gallbladder is extremely rare, and its 
diagnosis is difficult. If the condition is not treated right away, it can 
quickly become life-threatening. The majority of the pseudoaneurysms have 
already ruptured, and the patients are clinically septic, making surgery 
dangerous. Also, the use of contrast media in these patients may increase the 
risk of nephropathy, which is not an issue with percutaneous injection. Due to 
the obvious risk of rupture and bleeding, we propose injecting pseudoaneurysms 
only if they have a visible wall.ResultPercutaneous injection of the gallbladder 
pseudoaneurysms can be an option when treating gallbladder pseudoaneurysms. More 
research on long-term success rates is required.

Orexins/hypocretins are neuropeptides produced by the hypothalamic neurons, 
binding two G-protein coupled receptors (orexin 1 and orexin 2 receptors) and 
playing a critical role in regulating arousal, wakefulness, and various 
physiological functions. Given the high prevalence of sleep disturbances in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their reported involvement in AD pathophysiology, 
the orexin system is hypothesized to contribute to the disease pathogenesis. 
Specifically, recent evidence suggests that orexin's influence may extend beyond 
sleep regulation, potentially affecting amyloid-β and tau pathologies. Dual 
orexin receptor antagonists (DORAs), namely suvorexant, lemborexant, and 
daridorexant, demonstrated efficacy in treating chronic insomnia disorder across 
diverse clinical populations. Considering their stabilizing effects on sleep 
parameters and emerging evidence of a possible neuroprotective role, these 
agents represent a promising strategy for AD management. This leading article 
reviews the potential use of orexin receptor antagonists in AD, particularly 
focusing on their effect in modulating disease-associated sleep disturbances and 
clinical outcomes. Overall, clinical studies support the use of DORAs to enhance 
sleep quality in patients with AD with comorbid sleep and circadian sleep-wake 
rhythm disorders. Preliminary results also suggest that these compounds might 
influence AD pathology, potentially affecting disease progression. Conversely, 
research on selective orexin receptor antagonists in AD is currently limited. 
Further investigation is needed to explore orexin antagonism not only as a 
symptomatic treatment for sleep disturbances, but also for its broader 
implications in modifying AD neurodegeneration, emphasizing mechanisms of action 
and long-term outcomes.

BACKGROUND: The apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele, type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(T2DM), and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are well-established risk factors for 
dementia. Relationships between APOE and incidence of T2DM and CVD are not fully 
understood but may shed light on the mechanisms underlying dementia 
pathogenesis.
METHODS: Postmenopausal women (N = 6 795) from the Women's Health Initiative 
hormone therapy clinical trial with APOE genotyping and no prior diagnosis of 
T2DM or CVD were included. We examined associations of APOE status (APOE2+ 
[ε2/ε2, ε2/ε3], APOE3 [ε3/ε3], and APOE4+ [ε4/ε4, ε3/ε4] carriers) with 
incidence of T2DM, coronary heart disease, stroke, and total CVD events using 
Cox regression. CVD outcomes were examined in baseline non-statin users and 
adjusted for statin initiation over follow-up to account for possible 
confounding by statins.
RESULTS: Among all participants (mean age 66.7 ± 6.5 years, 100% non-Hispanic 
White), 451 (6.6%) were using statins at baseline. Over the follow-up (mean 14.9 
and 16.0 years for T2DM and CVD, respectively), 1 564 participants developed 
T2DM and 1 578 developed CVD. T2DM incidence did not differ significantly by 
APOE status (ps ≥ .09). Among non-statin users, APOE4+ had higher incidence of 
total CVD (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval] = 1.18 [1.02-1.38], p = .03) 
compared with APOE3 carriers, but risks for coronary heart disease (1.09 
[0.87-1.36], p = .47) and stroke (1.14 [0.91-1.44], p = .27) were not 
significantly elevated when examined individually. CVD outcomes did not differ 
between APOE2+ and APOE3 carriers (ps ≥ 0.11).
CONCLUSIONS: T2DM risk did not differ by APOE status among postmenopausal women, 
but APOE4+ carriers not using statins had an increased risk of total CVD events.

OBJECTIVES: To explore the effectiveness of an adapted 14-week cognitive 
stimulation therapy (CST) protocol on psychoaffective symptoms and quality of 
life (QOL) for people living with mild dementia.
METHOD: The sample for this pragmatic study were people with dementia who 
underwent CST between May 2016 and September 2022 during routine healthcare. 
Measures of participants' psychoaffective symptoms and QOL were administered 
before CST ('baseline') and following CST ('post-intervention'). The Hospital 
Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to measure anxiety symptoms, 
depression symptoms, and their sum score (referred to as HADS-total). The 
Quality of Life-Alzheimer's Disease (QOL-AD) scale was used to measure 
participants' quality of life (both patient and carer ratings were available). 
Change in these outcomes was assessed using linear mixed models.
RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty-five participants attended ≥1 session of adapted 
CST (84% attended at least 9/14 sessions, considered 'high' adherence). The mean 
change [95% confidence interval] in HADS-total scores indicated improvement 
(-0.9; [-1.9, -0.0]). Mean scores on the other outcomes showed neither 
improvement nor worsening.
CONCLUSION: Overall, this pragmatic study shows that an adapted 14-week 
face-to-face CST protocol is effective in improving mental health in people with 
mild dementia and has the potential to be widely implemented within routine 
healthcare.

Protein aggregation (PA) is a critical phenomenon associated with Alzheimer's 
and Parkinson's disease. Recent studies have suggested that factors like 
aggregation-prone regions (APRs) and β-strand interactions are crucial in 
understanding such behavior. While experimental methods have provided valuable 
insights, there has been a shift towards computational strategies, particularly 
machine learning, for their efficacy and speed. The challenge, however, lies in 
effectively incorporating structural information into these models. This study 
constructs a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to predict PA scores with the 
expanded and refined Protein Data Bank (PDB) and AlphaFold2.0 dataset. We 
employed AGGRESCAN3D 2.0 to calculate PA propensity and to enhance the dataset, 
we systematically separated multi polypeptide chains within PDB data into single 
polypeptide chains, removing redundancy. This effort resulted in a dataset 
comprising 302 032 unique PDB entries. Subsequently, we compared sequence 
similarity and obtained 22 774 Homo sapiens data from AlphaFold2.0. Using this 
expanded and refined dataset, the trained GCN model for PA prediction achieves a 
remarkable coefficient of determination (R 2) score of 0.9849 and a low mean 
absolute error (MAE) of 0.0381. Furthermore, the efficacy of the active learning 
process was demonstrated through its rapid identification of proteins with high 
PA propensity. Consequently, the active learning approach achieved an MAE of 
0.0291 in expected improvement, surpassing other methods. It identified 99% of 
the target proteins by exploring merely 29% of the entire search space. This 
improved GCN model demonstrates promise in selecting proteins susceptible to PA, 
advancing protein science. This work contributes to the development of efficient 
computational tools for PA prediction, with potential applications in disease 
diagnosis and therapy.

Alzheimer's disease is the most common major neurocognitive disorder. Although 
currently, no cure exists, understanding the neurobiological substrate 
underlying Alzheimer's disease progression will facilitate early diagnosis and 
treatment, slow disease progression, and improve prognosis. In this study, we 
aimed to understand the morphological changes underlying Alzheimer's disease 
progression using structural magnetic resonance imaging data from cognitively 
normal individuals, individuals with mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's 
disease via a contrastive variational autoencoder model. We used contrastive 
variational autoencoder to generate synthetic data to boost the downstream 
classification performance. Due to the ability to parse out the nonclinical 
factors such as age and gender, contrastive variational autoencoder facilitated 
a purer comparison between different Alzheimer's disease stages to identify the 
pathological changes specific to Alzheimer's disease progression. We showed that 
brain morphological changes across Alzheimer's disease stages were significantly 
associated with individuals' neurofilament light chain concentration, a 
potential biomarker for Alzheimer's disease, highlighting the biological 
plausibility of our results.

Mentha aquatica L., or water mint, is an important member of the Mentha genus, 
and has long been used in traditional medicine, mainly to treat respiratory 
diseases such as the common cold. Nevertheless, although over the years many 
studies have shown that it's potential grows beyond this use, a review that 
highlights M. aquatica L.'s true potential is still lacking. Thus, the main 
purpose of the present article is to provide a thorough and multidisciplinary 
critical review of M. aquatica L., including its phytochemical characterization, 
main bioactivities, and current marketed cosmetic products. Many compounds have 
been identified as part of M. aquatica L. composition, such as terpenes, 
phenolic acids, phenols, and terpenoids, which have been linked to a vast 
therapeutic potential, namely anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antibacterial, 
antifungal, antiobesity, and hepatoprotection bioactivities, with additional 
anticancer potential for several types of tumors (breast, lung, and skin), and 
psycho and neuroactive potential in depression, or Alzheimer's or Parkinson's 
disease. Additionally, it has been proven to be suitable for cosmetic 
application since several cleansing, hydrating, protecting, and/or odor masking 
products containing it are already available, with the main functions attributed 
to M. aquatica including refreshing/cooling effects, calming/soothing/relaxing 
effects, and purifying effects, properties closely related to its 
anti-inflammatory and antioxidant bioactivities. Hence, M. aquatica is an 
extremely versatile plant, with its extracts and essential oils having great 
therapeutic and cosmetic potential. With many marketed cosmetic products, future 
studies should focus on this plant's medicinal aspects, so that 1 day it can be 
part of therapeutic regimens.

Despite electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) being recognized as an effective 
treatment for major depressive episodes (MDE), its application is subject to 
controversy due to concerns over cognitive side effects. The pathophysiology of 
these side effects is not well understood. Here, we examined the effects of ECT 
on blood-based biomarkers of neuronal injury and astrocytic reactivity. 
Participants with a major depressive episode (N = 99) underwent acute ECT. Blood 
was sampled just before (T0) and 30 min after (T1) the first ECT session, as 
well as just before the sixth session (T2; 48-72 h after the fifth session). 
Age- and sex-matched controls (N = 99) were recruited from the general 
population. Serum concentrations of neurofilament light chain (NfL), total tau 
protein, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were measured with 
ultrasensitive single-molecule array assays. Utilizing generalized least squares 
regression, we compared baseline (T0) biomarker concentrations against those of 
our control group, and calculated the shifts in serum biomarker concentrations 
from baseline to immediately post-first ECT session (T1), and prior to the sixth 
session (T2). Baseline analysis revealed that serum levels of NfL (p < 0.001) 
and tau (p = 0.036) were significantly elevated in ECT recipients compared with 
controls, whereas GFAP levels showed no significant difference. Relative to T0, 
serum NfL concentration neither changed at T1 (mean change 3.1%, 95%CI -0.5% to 
6.7%, p = 0.088) nor at T2 (mean change -3.2%, 95%CI -7.6% to 1.5%, p = 0.18). 
Similarly, no change in total tau was observed (mean change 3.7%, 95%CI -11.6% 
to 21.7%, p = 0.65). GFAP increased from T0 to T1 (mean change 20.3%, 95%CI 
14.6 to 26.3%, p < 0.001), but not from T0 to T2 (mean change -0.7%, 95%CI -5.8% 
to 4.8%, p = 0.82). In conclusion, our findings suggest that ECT induces a 
temporary increase in serum GFAP, possibly reflecting transient astrocytic 
activation. Importantly, we observed no indicators of neuronal damage or 
long-term elevation in any assessed biomarker.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition marked by 
memory impairments and distinct histopathological features such as amyloid-beta 
(Aβ) accumulations. Alzheimer's patients experience sleep disturbances at early 
stages of the disease. APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP) mice exhibit sleep disruptions, 
including reductions in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, that contribute to 
their disease progression. In addition, astrocytic calcium transients associated 
with a sleep-dependent brain rhythm, slow oscillations prevalent during NREM 
sleep, are disrupted in APP mice. However, at present it is unclear whether 
restoration of circuit function by targeting astrocytic activity could improve 
sleep in APP mice. To that end, APP mice expressing channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) 
targeted to astrocytes underwent optogenetic stimulation at the slow oscillation 
frequency. Optogenetic stimulation of astrocytes significantly increased NREM 
sleep duration but not duration of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Optogenetic 
treatment increased delta power and reduced sleep fragmentation in APP mice. 
Thus, optogenetic activation of astrocytes increased sleep quantity and improved 
sleep quality in an AD mouse model. Astrocytic activity provides a novel 
therapeutic avenue to pursue for enhancing sleep and slowing AD progression.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a pressing global health concern, necessitating 
comprehensive investigations into its underlying molecular mechanisms. While the 
late-stage pathophysiology of this disease is well understood, it is crucial to 
examine the role of amyloid beta oligomers (Aβo), which form in the brain during 
the early stages of disease development. These toxic oligomers could affect 
neuronal viability and generate oxidative stress in the brain. In this study, we 
exposed SHSY-5Y cells to Aβo. The increase in intracellular reactive oxygen 
species and apoptosis observed in Aβo-treated cells mimics the early stages of 
AD. Comprehensive proteomic profiling identified 2966 differentially expressed 
proteins, with 123 significantly modulated. Utilizing the NeuroPro database, we 
identified 80 confirmed AD-related proteins and 43 novel candidates. Seven 
AD-related proteins with a NeuroPro score ≥ 5 were shortlisted. Furthermore, 
these proteins are found to be associated with Aβ plaques in AD brains. VGF, 
LTF, PARP1, and MAOA have been implicated in various mechanisms underlying AD, 
including synaptic plasticity, iron homeostasis, DNA repair, and 
neurotransmitter degradation. Our study also revealed the involvement of 
less-explored proteins like MYH9, CISD1, and SNRNP70, which play critical roles 
in cytoskeletal dynamics, mitochondrial function, and RNA splicing, 
respectively. These findings underscore the complex pathophysiology of AD, 
highlighting potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for early 
intervention. The present study advances the understanding of Aβo-induced 
oxidative stress and neuronal damage, providing a foundation for future research 
into early-stage AD diagnosis and subsequent treatment strategies.

Extracellular aggregation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) in the brain plays a central role 
in the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Moreover, 
intraneuronal accumulation of Aβ via oligomer internalization might play an 
important role in the progression of AD. Deficient autophagy, which is a 
lysosomal degradation process, occurs during the early stages of AD. Tripeptidyl 
peptidase-1 (TPP1) functions as a lysosomal enzyme, and TPP1 gene mutations are 
associated with type 2 late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (LINCL). 
Nevertheless, there is little information about the role of TPP1 in the 
pathogenesis of AD; therefore, the present study aimed to measure the decrease 
in intraneuronal Aβ accumulation by a recombinant analog of the TPP1 enzyme, 
cerliponase alfa (CER) (Brineura®), and to determine whether autophagy pathways 
play a role in this decrease. In this study, endogenous Aβ accumulation was 
induced by fAβ1-42 (a toxic fragment of full-length Aβ) exposure, and mouse 
hippocampal neuronal cells (HT-22) were treated with CER (human recombinant 
rhTPP1 1 mg mL-1). Soluble Aβ, TPP1, and the proteins involved in autophagy, 
including mammalian target of rapamycin (p-mTOR/mTOR), p62/sequestosome-1 
(p62/SQSTM1), and microtubule-associated protein 1 A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3), 
were evaluated using western blotting. The sirtuin-1, beclin-1, and Atg5 genes 
were also studied using RT-PCR. Aβ and TPP1 localizations were observed via 
immunocytochemistry. CER reduced the Aβ load in HT-22 cells by inducing TPP1 
expression and converting pro-TPP1 into the mature form. Furthermore, exposure 
to CER and fAβ1-42 induced the autophagy-regulatory/related pathways in HT-22 
cells and exposure to CER alone increased sirtuin-1 activity. Based on the 
present findings, we suggest that augmentation of TPP1 with enzyme replacement 
therapy may be a potential therapeutic option for the treatment of AD.

AIMS: Alzheimer's disease is characterized by memory loss and pathological 
changes in the brain, such as amyloid beta and tau pathology, disruptions in 
neural circuits and neuronal oscillations are also significant indicators of 
this disease and potential therapeutic targets. We studied how intranasal 
insulin impacts memory and neural oscillations in an Alzheimer's disease rat 
model induced by STZ.
MAIN METHODS: Male Wistar rats were intracerebroventricularly injected with STZ, 
followed by intranasal insulin therapy. Electrophysiological recordings were 
conducted in the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex to assess local field 
potentials. Memory was assessed using novel object recognition and Y-maze tests. 
Amyloid and tau pathology and neuronal loss were also evaluated in the 
hippocampus.
KEY FINDING: Alterations in theta-gamma oscillations following insulin treatment 
were not significant. However, insulin administration ameliorated hippocampal 
sharp-wave ripples deficit and augmented hippocampal-prefrontal theta coherence. 
Concurrently, insulin therapy enhanced spatial memory and object recognition 
memory performance in behavioral tests. Insulin mitigated tau and amyloid 
pathology and hippocampal neuronal loss.
SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings underscore the potential of intranasal insulin to 
enhance memory function by modulating hippocampal-prefrontal cortical 
synchronization and alleviating impairments in hippocampal sharp-wave ripples.

AIMS: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by β-amyloid (Aβ) aggregation 
and neuroinflammation, leading to progressive synaptic loss and cognitive 
decline. Recent evidence suggests that Galectin-3 (Gal-3) plays a critical role 
in Aβ pathogenesis. However, strategies to simultaneously target Gal-3 and Aβ 
are currently insufficient. This study evaluates the therapeutic efficacy of 
(E)-2-(3,4-dihydroxystyryl)-3-hydroxy-4H-pyran-4-one (D30), in reducing Gal-3 
and Aβ pathogenesis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We applied exogenous oligomeric Aβ and used 5 × FAD mice 
to assess the impact of Aβ on Gal-3 deposition, microglial activation, and 
cognitive function. Thy1-EGFP mice were employed to observe dendritic spines. 
Comprehensive evaluations of D30's effects included behavioral studies, 
transcriptomic analysis, Western blotting, and immunofluorescent staining. The 
interaction between D30 and Gal-3 was examined using fluorescence resonance 
energy transfer (FRET) and microscale thermophoresis (MST).
KEY FINDINGS: D30 effectively reduced Aβ monomer production by inhibiting 
Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) and presenilin 1 (PS1) expression, and decreased 
Aβ aggregation. Treatment with D30 improved cognitive functions, reversed 
dendritic spine loss, and increased PSD95 expression in 5 × FAD mice. 
Additionally, D30 significantly lowered Gal-3 levels in both plasma and 
hippocampal tissues. D30 binds to Gal-3 and disrupts the interaction between 
Gal-3 and TREM2, as confirmed by FRET and MST.
SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings underscore the interaction between Gal-3 and Aβ in AD 
and its role in systemic inflammation using the 5 × FAD mouse model. Being able 
to target and regulate Gal-3 together with Aβ is crucial for preventing 
neuroinflammation and protecting synapses, D30 emerged as a novel compound with 
promising potential for AD treatment.

Although Alzheimer's disease (AD) cause is still unknown, there are several 
known risk factors, such as dyslipidemia. Statins are the most prescribed 
lipid-modifying therapies. Recent research has suggested a relationship between 
statins and AD, nevertheless, their ability to prevent AD is still unclear. 
Therefore, this cross-sectional study aimed to examine the relationship between 
statin use and anti-AD drug prescription. For that purpose, a database 
containing information on medications prescribed to patients aged 50 years or 
older (n = 233183) between 2018 and 2020 was used. Defined daily doses (DDDs) 
were calculated according to the ATC/DDD index 2023. Statistical analyses, with 
logistic regression and cumulative incidence, were carried out to assess statins 
and anti-AD drug consumption. As a result, a total of 47852 patients aged more 
than 70 years who were prescribed at least one antihypertensive, antidiabetic or 
lipid-modifying agent were included in the study. Of these, 45345 patients were 
classified within the cardiovascular risk group and 2483 were classified as 
patients with only hyperlipidemia. Patients using low-potency or hydrophilic 
statins had lower odds of anti-AD usage when compared to high-potency or 
lipophilic statins, respectively. Similarly, rosuvastatin and pitavastatin had 
lower odds of anti-AD medication intake when compared to atorvastatin. Finally, 
pitavastatin DDDs were prone to lower the odds of anti-AD medication usage when 
compared to rosuvastatin. In conclusion, a potential association between statins 
and the intake of AD medication has been observed. Specifically, low-potency 
(pitavastatin) and hydrophilic (rosuvastatin) statins were associated with less 
use of anti-AD medication.

Nasal delivery has emerged as a non-invasive route to administer drugs for brain 
delivery. In particular, polyelectrolyte complexes-based nanocarriers have been 
demonstrated to be advantageous for nasal delivery of peptide drugs and 
vaccines. Pramlintide (Pram) is a peptide that emerges as a novel 
neuroprotective strategy to modify the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
In this study, we examined the effects of the intranasal administration of 
dextran-pramlintide polyelectrolyte complex-coated nanoemulsions 
(PEC-NEDexS/Pram) in an experimental model of AD induced by 
intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusion of amyloid-beta (Aβ1-42) peptide in 
mice. PEC-NEDexS/Pram displayed droplet size lower than 200 nm and a negatively 
charged surface. The locomotor activity of the animals was not affected by the 
i.c.v. Aβ1-42 injection or Pram treatment. On the other hand, the intranasal 
administration of PEC-NEDexS/Pram at a dose of 100 μg/day for 14 consecutive 
days restored the impairment induced by Aβ1-42 injection in the discriminative 
learning and the short-term spatial reference memory of mice. However, Pram 
treatment did not alter the Aβ1-42-induced anhedonic behavior, oxidative stress 
parameters, or the pre-synaptic SNAP-25 and post-synaptic PSD-95 levels in the 
hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. These findings indicate cognitive-enhancing 
properties of intranasal Pram administration in an animal model of AD.

Numerous studies conducted over the last ten years have shown a strong 
correlation between the gut microbiota and the onset and progression of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the exact underlying mechanism is still 
unknown. An ongoing communication mechanism linking the gut and the brain is 
highlighted by the term "microbiota-gut-brain axis," which was originally coined 
the "gut-brain axis." Key metabolic, endocrine, neurological, and immunological 
mechanisms are involved in the microbiota‒gut‒brain axis and are essential for 
preserving brain homeostasis. Thus, the main emphasis of this review is how the 
gut microbiota contributes to the development of AD and how various natural 
products intervene in this disease. The first part of the review provides an 
outline of various pathways and relationships between the brain and gut 
microbiota, and the second part provides various mechanisms involved in the gut 
microbiota and AD. Finally, this review provides knowledge about natural 
products and their effectiveness in treating gut microbiota-induced AD. AD may 
be treated in the future by altering the gut microbiota with a customized diet, 
probiotics/prebiotics, plant products, and natural products. This entails 
altering the microbiological partners and products (such as amyloid protein) 
that these partners generate.
