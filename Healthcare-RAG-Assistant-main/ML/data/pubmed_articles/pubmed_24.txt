Familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD), often linked to presenilin 1 (PSEN1) 
mutations, is characterized by an autosomal dominant inheritance and earlier 
onset compared to sporadic Alzheimer's disease. We report a 48-year-old female 
patient diagnosed with early-onset FAD carrying a PSEN1 (p.Met139Leu) mutation, 
who initially presented with cognitive decline and later developed acute 
psychotic symptoms. Despite combined antipsychotic and anti-dementia treatment, 
her cognitive function rapidly deteriorated, resulting in significant functional 
loss. This case highlights the atypical early psychiatric manifestations of FAD, 
emphasizing the importance of genetic testing and prompt intervention in younger 
patients presenting with cognitive and psychiatric symptoms.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Multiple sclerosis (MS) are progressive 
neurodegenerative conditions. AD is characterized by neuroinflammation, plaques, 
tangles, and synaptic loss, while MS involves inflammatory demyelination. 
Although AD and MS have different pathogenesis, they may share some 
neurodegenerative mechanisms, so similar therapeutic strategies could 
potentially be effective for both. Research suggests that natural substances 
such as carotenoids may be beneficial for neurological disorders. Notably, 
Astaxanthin (AXT) has demonstrated promising effects as an adjunct therapy.
METHODS: In this review, we aimed to shed light on the effects of AXT on MS and 
AD by searching published articles from inception to 1 August 2024, in the 
Scopus, Google Scholar, PubMed, and PubMed/Medline databases.
RESULTS: The therapeutic effects of AXT in neurodegenerative disorders are 
associated with its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and 
neuroplasticity improvement properties. Literature have confirmed that AXT can 
positively impact AD by modulating anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory 
cytokines, mitochondrial function, amyloid beta production, and microglial 
activation, which collectively leads to memory and learning enhancement. 
Additionally, AXT has demonstrated advantages in MS by reducing demyelination 
and preserving nerve functions through its effects on pro- and anti-inflammatory 
cytokines, as well as promoting the differentiation of oligodendrocyte 
precursors into mature oligodendrocytes.
CONCLUSION: AXT, as a promising versatile adjunctive neuroprotective therapy, 
can influence multiple recovery pathways rather than focusing on a single target 
or mechanism. According to the results of preclinical studies, we can recommend 
assessing AXT effects in clinical trials of AD and MS.

Rhizoma Anemarrhenae, in which the primary active components are saponins, has 
shown potential in treating Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the specific 
mechanisms of action and the active saponins responsible remain unclear. This 
study aimed to explore the mechanisms of action and identify the active 
components of Rhizoma Anemarrhenae saponins (RAS). First, 24 saponin components 
in RAS and eight absorbed saponins in rats were identified. Then, a 
component-target interaction network between eight saponins and 83 targets was 
constructed after target refinement and SPR validation. Bioinformatics analysis 
indicated that these targets were closely related to lipid metabolism, iron 
metabolism, and the AMPK signaling pathway. In addition, differentially 
expressed genes from RAS intervention were significantly enriched in the 
ferroptosis pathway. In vitro and in vivo assays demonstrated that RAS could 
inhibit neuronal ferroptosis and alleviate cognitive impairment. Notably, the 
ferroptosis inducer markedly reversed the neuroprotective effects of RAS. 
Moreover, silencing AMPK or Nrf2 using the siRNA or AMPK inhibitor abolished the 
neuroprotective and ferroptosis-inhibitory effects of RAS in vivo or in vitro. 
Silencing LKB1 reversed the RAS-induced activation of the AMPK/Nrf2 pathway, and 
co-immunoprecipitation assay revealed that RAS could promote the LKB1-AMPK 
interaction. Finally, a 2D comprehensive NC/CMC system was used to screen out 
four potential saponins that inhibit neuronal ferroptosis, with Timosaponin 
B-III, Timosaponin A-I, and Timosaponin A-III being validated. In conclusion, 
RAS exerts anti-AD effects by enhancing the LKB1-AMPK interaction, and 
activating the AMPK/Nrf2 pathway, inhibiting neuronal ferroptosis as a result. 
Three saponins are identified as the active components potentially responsible 
for this effect.

Vascular dementia (VD) is the second most common type of dementia after 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), and chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) is the main 
causative factor of VD. Previous reports have confirmed that there is a 
relationship between VD and gut microbiota, and that some plant-based foods can 
improve VD through the gut-brain axis (GBA). Panax notoginseng leaves are a 
specialty food in Yunnan, China, and saponin is its main bioactive component. In 
this study, we investigated the effects of the total saponins of Panax 
notoginseng leaves (TSPNL) on CCH-induced VD and their potential mechanisms. In 
this experiment, the model was replicated using bilateral common carotid artery 
occlusion (BCCAO) and divided into Sham, Model, TSPNL-L, TSPNL-H and Positive 
drug control. At the end of the treatment, behavior, brain-derived neurotrophic 
factor (BDNF), hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis-related indices, 
neuronal apoptosis-related indices, gut microbiota composition, and colon and 
brain pathology were tested. The results showed that TSPNL attenuated 
CCH-induced VD, promoted BDNF synthesis, and inhibited neuronal apoptosis. 
Predictions of network pharmacology and experiments demonstrated that these 
beneficial effects are mediated in part through BDNF-TrKB-PI3K/Akt signaling. In 
addition, TSPNL prevented intestinal dysbiosis by increasing the abundance of 
the probiotic Ligilactobacillus and decreasing the abundance of the deleterious 
bacterium Clostridia_ UCG_014_unclassified relative to the model group. TSPNL 
was also able to partially reverse intestinal barrier disruption and inhibit 
intestinal inflammation and the hyperactivation of the HPA axis. The results of 
this study support the conclusion that TSPNL has potential in the prevention of 
CCH-induced VD and warrants further investigation.

The long-term malfunctioning of brain in older people neurons is known as 
Alzheimer's disease (Alz-D), the most prevalent form of dementia worldwide. 
Pathophysiology of Alz-D includes, amyloid plaque, cholinergic neuron loss, 
choline acetyltransferase reduction, and tau fibrillary tangle progression. 
Several theories were also developed mainly involving the cerebral cortex and 
hippocampus, but unfortunately, there is currently no medication that protects 
or regenerates neurons. Symptoms may include impairment in memory, speech, 
personality, verbal fluency, and progressive mental failure. Symptoms are 
managed with a variety of FDA-approved medications; however, researchers are 
still searching for new molecular targets to treat Alz-D in addition to working 
on drug development. Clinical trials for the treatment of Alz-D are among the 
various strategies being tried in the current scenario. Thus, the main purpose 
of this study was to provide an overview of the key developments in Alz-D, and 
novel pharmacological therapies. Extensive review of various database, journals, 
books and websites are explored to select and analyse data based on 
pathophysiology, aetiology and different medications either approved or 
undergoing clinical trials, along with special emphasis on novel therapeutic 
approach; 'thiolutin' safety, efficacy, therapeutic outcomes, mode of action, 
structure activity relationship and molecular targets. We also emphasized on 
preparation of microneedle formulation of thiolutin to address its toxicity and 
to improve its efficacy. By utilizing microneedles nanomedicines and numerous 
novel approaches, currents study also aims to elucidate recent advancements and 
treatment options in future medicines.

AIM OF THE STUDY: The biomarker neurofilament light (NfL) measured from plasma 
predicts outcome at 12-72 h after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). We 
performed a post-hoc analysis of NfL using samples from 112 patients in the 
COMACARE trial, applying the Siemens Atellica NfL.
METHODS: We analyzed samples collected between 2016 and 2017 using the Siemens 
Atellica NfL and compared the results with those from the Quanterix Simoa 
NF-Light-method. We defined poor outcome as Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) 
3-5 at six months after OHCA. We evaluated the accuracy of NfL measured at 
24-72 h for outcome prediction with high specificity. We calculated the areas 
under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROC) and compared the 
results of the two methods.
RESULTS: The Atellica NfL showed high prognostic performance, with AUROCs 
(0.97-0.98) comparable to those of the Simoa NfL method with a minimal 
difference (-0.008-0.001). Tentative cut-off values based on this limited sample 
size for predicting poor outcome at six months after OHCA with 99 % specificity 
were 112, 229, and 331 ng/L at 24, 48 and 72 h, respectively. Cut off values for 
predicting good outcome with 100 % sensitivity were below 29 ng/L at 24, 48, and 
72 h.
CONCLUSION: The Atellica NfL assay accuracy appears well comparable to that 
obtained using the more laborious Simoa method. Further larger studies are 
needed to determine cut-off values in heterogenous populations of cardiac arrest 
patients.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, and 
early diagnosis is crucial to enable effective interventions. Currently, 
Alzheimer's disease is diagnosed through cognitive assessments, brain imaging 
and fluid biomarkers focused on determining amyloid (A) and, tau (T) protein 
levels as well as neurodegeneration (N) in the AT(N) framework. Prognostic 
biomarkers for predicting cognitive decline within the amyloid positive (Aβ+) 
individuals would further strengthen the framework.
OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated small RNAs as novel auxiliary biomarkers, 
independent of the AT(N) framework, either alone or in combination with 
established protein markers, for detecting the earliest cognitive decline in AD.
DESIGN: The European Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease (EPAD) clinical trial 
platform is a prospective, multi-center study designed to investigate biomarkers 
for preclinical and prodromal AD.
SETTING: Peripheral whole blood RNA sequencing was performed on participants 
across Europe with no cognitive impairment or very mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI), stratified by cerebrospinal fluid amyloid levels.
PARTICIPANTS: 1,913 participants, 50 years or older and free of dementia 
diagnosis at enrollment, were analyzed.
INTERVENTION: (if any) Not applicable.
MEASUREMENTS: Ultra-deep small RNA sequencing was performed on whole blood 
samples using a refined blocking protocol to eliminate highly abundant erythroid 
small RNAs, and thereby to open sequencing bandwidth for the discovery of less 
abundant biomarker RNAs. Biomarker RNAs were deconvolved into plasma or blood 
cell origin and analyzed for functional relevance. We define high and low 
amyloid groups based on a cutoff on the p-tau181/Aβ1-42 ratio as determined from 
cerebrospinal fluid.
RESULTS: We identified a combination of small RNAs that predicted early 
cognitive decline (Clinical Dementia Rating of 0.5) with an area under the 
receiver-operator curve of ∼0.7. Notably, when focusing on individuals with 
cognitive decline and high amyloid burden (Aβ+), the predictive accuracy 
improved to an AUC of 0.77. This performance could be extended to the entire 
cohort when combining blood RNA and CSF amyloid markers (AUC 0.76). We conducted 
bioinformatic analyses to interrogate the likely functional relevance of these 
small RNAs, uncovering several links to dementia-relevant pathways, including 
neuronal, cardiovascular, and inflammatory activities. Our findings also suggest 
that small nucleolar RNAs warrant further investigation as potential 
disease-relevant markers, in addition to microRNAs.
CONCLUSIONS: Integrating small RNA biomarkers with protein-based assays offers 
preliminary evidence for stratifying MCI, particularly within the amyloid 
positive continuum. Small nucleolar RNAs and microRNAs warrant further 
exploration as complementary diagnostic tools, and their use may enable more 
precise and effective interventions.

Recently, histone deacetylases 6 (HDAC6) has been extensively studied for 
involvement in pathogenesis of central nervous system (CNS) diseases, especially 
for Alzheimer's disease (AD). A lot of literatures have disclosed that HDAC6 
inhibitors (HDAC6is) are effective and promising in AD treatment. Though many 
HDAC6is were reported, only a handful of them displayed appropriate in vivo 
activities in models of neurological diseases. BBB permeability and off-target 
toxicity are the major obstacle and challenge for the development of available 
HDAC6is. In this review, we summarized recent brain-permeable HDAC6is from drug 
design perspective, and discussed the challenges and structural modification 
attempts in developing HDAC6is with better blood-brain barrier (BBB) 
permeability.

Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), typically have an 
insidious onset and unclear aetiology and are characterized mainly by 
progressive cognitive decline and behavioural impairments. Currently, 
interactions among genetic factors, environmental factors, oxidative stress, 
mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and impaired energy metabolism are 
the most common pathophysiological mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative 
diseases. Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), a key enzyme involved in glycolysis, has 
both metabolic and nonmetabolic functions; signal transducer and activator of 
transcription 3 (STAT3) is the core of the JAK-STAT inflammatory signalling 
pathway, which is involved in the transcriptional regulation of many target 
genes; and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNPA1), an RNA-binding 
protein, regulates RNA posttranscriptional processing and other processes. In 
recent years, increasing evidence has suggested that hnRNPA1, STAT3 and PKM2 are 
interrelated and interact with each other. The formation of the 
PKM2-STAT3-hnRNPA1 feedback loop plays a key role in cellular metabolism, the 
inflammatory response, cell survival and gene expression regulation, and its 
aberrant activation is closely related to the occurrence and development of a 
variety of central nervous system diseases. Focusing on the molecular mechanism 
of PKM2-STAT3-hnRNPA1 feedback loop formation, we reveal how the three interact 
and regulate each other at the molecular level, with an emphasis on their 
pathophysiological roles in AD-dominated neurodegenerative diseases. These 
findings will contribute to the identification of potential therapeutic targets 
in neurodegenerative diseases.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition, with mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) often presenting as an early symptom. Patients with 
MCI are more likely to experience subsequent long-term cognitive impairments and 
memory dysfunction. Currently, there are no effective therapeutic agents 
available for the clinical treatment of AD due to its highly complex 
pathogenesis. We investigated the neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects 
of green oat cognitaven® in vitro, using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated 
BV-2 microglial cells, and in vivo, using a scopolamine-injected C57BL/6 J 
amnesic mouse model. The mice were orally administered green oat cognitaven® 
(90, 180, and 270 mg/kg/b.w.) for 14 days and injected intraperitoneally with 
scopolamine (1 mg/kg/b.w.) for 14 days. In vitro, green oat cognitaven® 
exhibited multiple actions in LPS-stimulated BV-2 microglial cells, including 
strong inhibition of NO release, significantly reduced inflammatory responses, 
and anti-inflammatory effects. Green oat cognitaven® also demonstrated vigorous 
anti-neuroinflammatory activity in these cells, inhibiting the activation and 
phosphorylation of the NF-κB/MAPK signaling pathway. In vivo, the oral 
administration of green oat cognitaven® in scopolamine-induced amnesic mice 
produced significant anti-amnesic effects-preventing spatial learning and memory 
impairments-and demonstrated potent neuroprotective activity through the 
upregulation of associated biomarkers, including p-CREB and BDNF protein 
expression. Further experiments showed that green oat cognitaven® upregulates 
Nrf2/HO-1 expression and mitigates neuroinflammation by inhibiting NF-κB and 
MAPK signaling. Overall, our study indicated that green oat cognitaven® is a 
functional dietary component and explores its therapeutic potential to support 
the treatment and management of AD-associated MCI.

Tau pathological aggregation in neurofibrillary tangles is a hallmark of several 
neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Phase separation is a 
thermodynamic process that plays an important role in biomolecular membrane-less 
condensate formation, while abnormal phase separation of tau leads to 
pathological aggregate formation. However, the detailed molecular mechanism 
underlying tau condensation remains not fully understood. Moreover, whether 
condensation-based pharmacological intervention will be helpful for the 
treatment of tau-associated neurodegenerative diseases remains elusive. Here, we 
used an optogenetic tool (optoDroplets) in combination with cell biology and 
pharmacology to explore the contribution of different domains for tau 
condensation in cells, and we found that proline-rich domain (PRD) 
phosphorylation, which is mainly regulated by glycogen synthase kinase 3 β 
(GSK3β), plays important roles for tau condensation. Moreover, phosphorylation 
of tau PRD regulates its mis-localization on nuclear speckle. Interestingly and 
importantly, we found that pharmacological inhibition of GSK3β can impede 
abnormal tau condensation to slow down the tau-associated pathological process.

Despite advances in understanding neurodegenerative disease mechanisms, 
effective treatments remain elusive. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), key mediators 
of intercellular communication within the central nervous system (CNS), are 
increasingly recognized for their involvement in the pathogenesis of 
neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease 
(PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis (MS) and 
Huntington's disease (HD). In vivo studies demonstrate EVs' crucial role in 
maintaining CNS homeostasis, modulating neuroinflammatory responses, and 
influencing tissue repair and regeneration following injury, thereby impacting 
disease progression and recovery. Their unique properties, including small size 
and ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), position them as promising 
candidates for both biomarkers and therapeutics in CNS diseases. This review 
delves into the significant impact of neuroinflammation on neurodegenerative 
conditions, specifically focusing on the multifaceted contributions of EVs and 
their intricate interplay with the inflammatory landscape. We explore EV 
biogenesis, cargo composition, diverse roles in neuroinflammation (including 
intercellular communication and neuroprotection), their potential as biomarkers 
and drug delivery vehicles across the BBB for diagnosis or treatment of 
neuroinflammation implemented neurodegenerative diseases.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by a gradual decline in cognitive ability and memory function. It 
is a progressive disease characterized by worsening dementia symptoms over time, 
starting with mild memory loss and advancing to severe impairments in 
communication and responsiveness. The key motive of this work is to explore the 
new hybrid technique with parameter tuning for segmenting the brain sub regions, 
by satisfying the clinical targets in finding major biomarkers of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). This study aims to explore a new bioinspired hybrid technique for 
segmenting various brain regions to assist in Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
diagnosis. To refine the segmentation accuracy, a combination of Gray Wolf 
Optimization (GWO) and Harris Hawk Optimization (HHO) approaches is proposed. 
Initially, the population is divided into two smaller groups, designated HHO and 
GWO, where both methods update subpopulation positions concurrently. The 
segmented region (SR) is validated with ground truth (GT) using different 
statistical measures and shows the highlighted accuracy of 92 %. According to 
the experimental results, the proposed hybrid technique provides an improved 
solution than HHO. After segmentation, deep learning (DL) technique is applied 
to classify the normal controls (NC) and AD. A 90 % classification accuracy is 
achieved when HHO and GWO are combined. Finally, the results are validated with 
clinical score, namely Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), which gives the 
support to observe the disease progression. This process demonstrates the hybrid 
method and it proves with remarkable results, in segmentation, classification 
and clinical validation. In this work, clinicians have assisted in disease 
progression monitoring, thereby improving patient care. Significance: This work 
provides assistance to diagnose AD and doctors to make a decision for further 
treatment.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder and the 
predominant form of dementia among the elderly. Berberine (BBR) is an approved 
drug for Alzheimer's disease (AD) that has demonstrated a substantial 
improvement in cognitive function, proficient management of neurobehavioral 
symptoms, and enhancement of performance in vital everyday activities. 
Nonetheless, the adverse effects of the drug encompass vomiting and nausea, 
considerable variations in blood concentrations, and inadequate patient 
adherence. Consequently, the primary objectives are to optimize the 
administration method and enhance therapeutic efficiency. Hence, we suggest 
utilizing a hierarchical hydrogel (HGL)-incorporated mesoporous silica 
nanocarrier (MSN) to incorporate BBR, aiming to reduce adverse effects in the 
stomach. These hydrogels facilitate the gradual release of drugs at a rate of 
62% over a prolonged duration, aiming to decrease dose frequency, optimize the 
efficacy of drug administrations, and improve patient adherence. Due to these 
characteristics, drug-encapsulating MSN-BBR hydrogels can facilitate optimal 
drug administration and have developed into superior options for Alzheimer's 
disease therapy, with innovation promising effective treatment.

Age-related neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular neuropathologies often coexist 
in the brain of older adults and contribute to brain abnormalities, cognitive 
decline and dementia. While deep gray matter structures are implicated early 
and/or strongly in these processes, the independent effects of various 
age-related neuropathologies on these structures remain poorly understood. The 
goal of this study was to investigate the independent association of various 
age-related neuropathologies with the volume and shape of deep gray matter 
structures in a large number of community-based older adults that came to 
autopsy. Cerebral hemispheres from 842 participants of four community studies at 
the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center were imaged with MRI ex vivo and underwent 
detailed neuropathologic examination. Linear regression was used to study the 
association of various neuropathologies with the volume and shape of six deep 
gray matter structures (hippocampus, amygdala, caudate, thalamus, nucleus 
accumbens, putamen) controlling for age at death, sex, years of education, 
scanner, and postmortem intervals. Both the volumetric and shape analyses showed 
independent associations of tangles with structural abnormalities in all deep 
brain structures, of limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy 
neuropathological change (LATE-NC) with hippocampus and amygdala, of 
atherosclerosis with hippocampus, and of gross infarcts with caudate (all 
p < 0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons). Shape analysis revealed the 
corresponding independent spatial patterns of inward deformation and also showed 
additional associations of neuropathologies with deep brain structures (p < 0.05 
corrected for multiple comparisons). When analyses were repeated in left and 
right hemispheres separately, the results were mostly similar in both 
hemispheres. Mixed pathologies are very common in the older adult brain and the 
present comprehensive study disentangles their independent effects on multiple 
deep gray matter structures. These neuropathologic signatures may potentially be 
used in combination with other features toward in vivo prediction of 
neuropathologies which could have important implications in future clinical 
trials and the development of prevention and treatment strategies.

INTRODUCTION: Neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple Sclerosis (MS), 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD) share overlapping 
clinical and pathological features, complicating early diagnosis and management. 
Demyelination, a key pathological hallmark, underscores the importance of 
accurately assessing white matter (WM) integrity.
CONTENT: Myelin water imaging (MWI), an advanced non-invasive MRI technique, 
quantifies the myelin water fraction (MWF) and offers high specificity for 
detecting myelin abnormalities. This systematic review explores the feasibility 
and diagnostic utility of MWI across MS, AD, and PD by analyzing 21 high-quality 
studies from major databases, following PRISMA guidelines.
SUMMARY: MWI consistently revealed reduced MWF in MS patients across various WM 
regions, lesion types, and disease stages, including responsiveness to early 
treatment. In AD, MWF decline correlated with disease progression and 
apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) genotype, supporting its potential in early diagnosis. 
Findings in PD were inconsistent, reflecting secondary or minimal myelin 
involvement in its pathology.
OUTLOOK: MWI shows strong promise as a non-invasive imaging biomarker, 
particularly in MS and AD. Standardization of acquisition protocols, integration 
with multimodal imaging, and further longitudinal studies are essential to 
establish its clinical utility and support broader implementation in 
neurodegenerative disease diagnostics.

Depression has been widely recognized as an important accelerating factor 
contributing to the aggravation of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
patients. Previous studies show that microglia-mediated neuroinflammation is a 
common and critical event in the etiology of both depression and dementia, but 
whether and how microglia participate in the process of depression-exacerbating 
AD pathology is largely unknown. By establishing the learned helplessness 
depression model on 5×FAD mice, we confirmed that depression can indeed promote 
Aβ plaque deposition and deteriorate the cognitive performance of the AD mice. 
Importantly, we found that microglial lactate concentration is dramatically 
increased in the depressed AD brain, leading to activation of potassium channel 
Kv1.3 likely through non-direct-lactylation. The activated Kv1.3 further 
facilitates Aβ-containing exosome spreading from microglia in the vicinity of Aβ 
plaque into the surrounding brain tissue. Notably, conditional knock-out of 
Kv1.3 in microglia can reverse the depression-induced acceleration of AD 
pathology and cognitive decline. Together, our study highlights an important 
function of microglia Kv1.3 in the promotion of Aβ propagation in the context of 
depression-exacerbating AD pathology.

BACKGROUND: Cognitive aging is a growing public health concern, and curcumin, a 
bioactive compound derived from turmeric, has been proposed as a potential 
intervention to support cognitive function due to its anti-inflammatory and 
antioxidant properties.
OBJECTIVES: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the 
effects of curcumin on cognitive outcomes related to aging.
METHODS: A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of 
Science, and Scopus was conducted to identify studies published up to June 18, 
2024, including both in vivo preclinical animal studies and randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs) assessing curcumin's effects on cognitive function. In 
vivo animal studies using Alzheimer's disease (AD) models and RCTs in human 
participants were included. Data were extracted and analyzed using meta-analytic 
techniques.
RESULTS: In preclinical in vivo murine studies (n = 25; total animals = 572), 
curcumin consistently improved both acquisition memory (SMD = -1.78, 95 % CI: 
-2.12 to -1.43) and retention memory (SMD = 2.36, 95 % CI: 1.72 to 3.00) in 
rodent models of AD. Ten human studies include 531 participants. Overall, 
curcumin showed no significant effect on global cognitive outcomes compared to 
placebo (SMD = 0.14, 95 % CI: -0.78 to 1.07). Subgroup analyses revealed 
significant improvements in working memory (SMD = 1.01, 95 % CI: 0.15 to 1.87) 
and processing speed (SMD = 0.37, 95 % CI: 0.07 to 0.67). The incidence of 
adverse events was higher in the curcumin group than in the control group.
CONCLUSIONS: Preclinical in vivo evidence suggests curcumin enhances cognitive 
function in AD models. However, human studies show inconsistent findings with 
benefits limited to specific cognitive domains. Larger, well-designed randomized 
controlled trials are needed to establish curcumin's efficacy and safety in 
cognitive aging.

Tau protein, a microtubule-binding protein, is an important biomarker of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Sensitive and accurate detection of Tau is crucial for 
the diagnosis and treatment of AD. Even though both immunoassays and mass 
spectrometry have revealed their advantages in biofluid Tau measurement, 
significant variation exists among results from different assays due to 
variability in selectivity or calibrators, which underlines the importance of 
establishing a traceability chain for Tau measurements. The development of 
Tau-related certified reference material (CRM) and the establishment of 
traceability could help to standardize clinical result variation, which could 
further provide an opportunity for unifying clinical diagnosis interval and 
cutoff values. In this study, Tau-441 solution CRM (NIM-RM 2901) with the 
certified value and uncertainty of (74.1 ± 3.6) μg g-1 was developed with 
high-purity Tau-441 as the raw material. After purity and structure 
confirmation, three independent isotope dilution mass spectrometry strategies 
based on amino acids, signature peptides, and sulfur were employed to certify 
the candidate Tau-441 solution CRM. The candidate Tau-441 CRM showed good 
homogeneity, and satisfying stability was also demonstrated for at least 7 days 
at -20 °C and 13 months at -70 °C. The Tau-441 solution CRM (NIM-RM 2901) is 
primarily intended to be used for value assignment to secondary calibrators or 
CRMs with clinical matrix, which will help the early diagnosis of AD in the 
clinic.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Identifying amyloid-beta (Aβ)-positive patients is 
essential for Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical trials and disease-modifying 
treatments but currently requires PET or cerebrospinal fluid sampling. Previous 
MRI-based deep learning models, using only T1-weighted (T1w) images, have shown 
moderate performance.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Multi-contrast MRI and PET-based quantitative Aβ 
deposition were retrospectively obtained from three public datasets: ADNI, 
OASIS3, and A4. Aβ positivity was defined using each dataset's recommended 
centiloid threshold. Two EfficientNet models were trained to predict amyloid 
positivity: one using only T1w images and another incorporating both T1w and 
T2-FLAIR. Model performance was assessed using an internal held-out test set, 
evaluating AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. External validation was 
conducted using an independent cohort from Stanford Alzheimer's Disease Research 
Center. DeLong's and McNemar's tests were used to compare AUC and accuracy, 
respectively.
RESULTS: A total of 4,056 exams (mean [SD] age: 71.6 [6.3] years; 55% female; 
55% amyloid-positive) were used for network development, and 149 exams were used 
for external testing (mean [SD] age: 72.1 [9.6] years; 58% female; 56% 
amyloid-positive). The multi-contrast model outperformed the single-modality 
model in the internal held-out test set (AUC: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.65-0.70, P < 
0.001; accuracy: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.62-0.65, P < 0.001) compared to the T1w-only 
model (AUC: 0.61; accuracy: 0.59). Among cognitive subgroups, the highest 
performance (AUC: 0.71) was observed in mild cognitive impairment. The 
multi-contrast model also demonstrated consistent performance in the external 
test set (AUC: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.60-0.71, P = 0.014; accuracy: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.58- 
0.65, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The use of multi-contrast MRI, specifically incorporating T2-FLAIR 
in addition to T1w images, significantly improved the predictive accuracy of 
PET-determined amyloid status from MRI scans using a deep learning approach.

INTRODUCTION: Cognitive frailty (CF) is a clinical syndrome characterised by the 
concurrent occurrence of physical frailty and cognitive impairment, excluding 
Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. Recent studies have shown that 
combining aerobic exercise (AE) and meditation (ME) effectively enhances both 
physical and cognitive functions in individuals with CF. The study aims to 
determine whether the combined application of AE and ME can elicit significantly 
greater improvements in physical and cognitive functions among individuals with 
CF compared with the independent practice of either AE or ME alone.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The research design employs a four-arm, assessor-blind 
randomised controlled trial. A total of 140 qualified subjects will be randomly 
allocated among four groups: AE, ME, AE combined with ME and a health education 
control group, ensuring equivalent distribution across groups. The intervention 
phase of the study will last for 12 weeks. The primary outcomes will include the 
Edmonton Frailty Scale, while secondary outcomes will encompass evaluations of 
cognitive functions (including global cognitive function, memory, attention, 
executive function and visuospatial abilities), physical performance (measured 
by gait speed and lower extremity strength), subjective experiences (such as 
fatigue, quality of life, mindfulness, mood and sleep quality), as well as 
structural and functional MRI assessments and serum biomarkers. Outcomes will be 
evaluated at baseline and following the 12-week intervention.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Ethics Committee of the Affiliated Rehabilitation 
Hospital of the Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine granted 
ethical approval for the study (2023KY-012-02). The findings will be 
disseminated through publications in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at 
academic conferences.

The clinical significance of interindividual variation in circulating adropin 
levels is unclear. To better understand adropin biology at the whole-body level, 
we surveyed transcriptional structures co-regulated with the Energy Homeostasis 
Associated (ENHO) gene encoding adropin across human tissues using Gene-Derived 
Correlations Across Tissues (GD-CAT). ENHO/adropin-related transcriptional 
structures with >1000 genes meeting the selection threshold (q < 0.001) occurred 
in 11/20 tissues. While most reflect local relationships, liver 
ENHO/adropin-related structures are dominated by transcripts expressed across 
metabolic tissues (skeletal muscle, adipose tissues, thyroid). Relationships 
between liver ENHO/adropin expression and skeletal muscle mitochondrial function 
were corroborated using liver-specific knockout mice. Within-liver ENHO/adropin 
transcriptional structures reflect lipoprotein metabolism (e.g., APOC1, p = 4.91 
x 10-11; APOA1, p = 8.03 x 10-9), confirmed by correlations between plasma 
concentrations of adropin and indices of lipoprotein metabolism in MAPT samples. 
Moreover, statin treatment which increases hepatic cholesterol efflux, reduces 
plasma adropin levels. The ENHO gene contains retinoic acid receptor-related 
orphan receptor response elements (RORE), suggesting circadian control. 
Pan-organ transcriptional structures with liver ENHO/adropin or RORC overlap, 
reflecting the liver clock. Strong, local relationships between ENHO/adropin and 
circadian genes were also observed in most non-hepatic tissues. ENHO/adropin 
expression widely reflects activation of oxidative metabolic pathways and 
suppression of ribosomal functions and cell division. Finally, hippocampal 
ENHO/adropin expression correlates strongly with Alzheimer's disease risk genes 
identified by GWAS. In summary, activation of ENHO/adropin expression reflects 
cellular circadian and mitochondrial oxidative processes, but with inhibition of 
anabolic processes. Plasma adropin concentrations may thus reflect hepatic 
lipoprotein production and activation of metabolic stress responses across human 
tissues.

Anorexigenic neuropeptides have shown a remarkable potential in the treatment of 
neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). One of the strong 
anorexigenic neuropeptides is called cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated 
transcript peptide (CARTp), which is the third most abundant transcript in the 
hypothalamus. Previously, we introduced a novel palmitoylated analog of 
2-SS-CART(61-102), a specific analog of natural CART(61-102) with two disulfide 
bridges, with anorexigenic and neuroprotective properties. This study explores 
the impact of 2-SS-CART(61-102) and its palmitoylated analog, 
palm-2-SS-CART(61-102), on the early progression of Tau pathology characteristic 
of AD, utilizing the THY-Tau22 transgenic mouse model. Chronic subcutaneous 
treatment with CARTp analogs improved short-term spatial memory in the Y-maze, 
reduced the number of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) in the hippocampal CA1 
region, and decreased the level of GFAP + astrocytes in the hippocampus of 
THY-Tau22 mice. Furthermore, treatment with CARTp analogs showed increased 
levels of synaptic markers in the hippocampus. A beneficial effect on these 
attributes makes CARTp analogs promising for AD therapy.

Development of therapeutic options for Alzheimer's disease (AD) faces severe 
challenges. Only a few new anti-amyloid drugs based on monoclonal antibodies 
have been approved in recent years. Although the diversity of etiology and 
complexity of pathology make AD difficult to cure, these offer various molecular 
targets amenable for pharmaceutical interventions and disease modulation. In 
this study, we report an orally bioavailable quinolinium small molecule 
inhibitor, 88, to modulate neuropathologic changes in triple transgenic AD 
(3 × Tg-AD) mice. We have shown that 88 exhibited decent cerebral exposure, as 
compared with the forerunner quaternary isoquinolinium compound, 9Q, that we 
previously developed. In vivo studies revealed that 88 significantly mitigated 
cognitive deficits in 3 × Tg AD mice and decreased the amyloid burden as well as 
tau tangles in the hippocampus. Our data indicated that 88 treatments 
ameliorated the neuroinflammation via inhibiting glial activation and reducing 
cytokines IL-1β and IL-6. In vitro studies showed that 88 stabilized 
mitochondria membrane potential (MMP), decreased ROS generation, recovered 
respiratory function and ATP production in β-amyloid (Aβ)-induced PC12 cell 
model, suggesting mitigation of mitochondrial dysfunction. Such restored 
mitochondrial activity reduced the release of cytochrome c, which helped to 
prevent neuronal apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings suggested 
that 88 could be useful in modulating AD, while the restoration of mitochondria 
functions and amelioration of neuroinflammation could be promising avenues for 
disease modulation.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifaceted neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by low levels of acetylcholine, oxidative stress, amyloid-beta 
(Aβ) aggregation, and metal dysregulation. This study aimed to address the 
limitations associated with natural products for Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
management by designing and synthesizing in vivo efficacious caffeic acid 
derivatives as multifunctional cholinesterase inhibitors. A comprehensive 
structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis was carried out in a calibrated 
manner to improve upon the cholinesterase inhibitory potential of caffeic acid 
along with its multifunctional properties. Among the synthesized compounds, 12d 
emerged as a lead molecule, exhibiting selective AChE inhibition 
(IC50 = 3.72 ± 0.34 μM) over BChE (IC50 = 9.65 ± 0.08 μM), with significant 
improvement over parent caffeic acid (AChE and BChE 35.39 ± 0.66 % and 
18.94 ± 0.91 %, respectively). Enzyme kinetic studies revealed 12d as a mixed 
inhibition mechanism against human AChE (hAChE) and equine BChE (eqBChE). 
Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that 12d 
interacts with key active-site residues of AChE (TRP86, HIS447, SER293, and 
ARG296), and BChE (TRP82, LEU286, HIS438, PHE329, G197, and TRP231). 
Additionally, 12d displayed potent antioxidant activity in the DPPH assay, 
exhibiting a strong free radical scavenging effect with an IC50 value of 
6.32 ± 0.15 μM. 12d also demonstrated metal-chelating properties, suggesting its 
potential to prevent metal-induced neurotoxicity. Furthermore, blood-brain 
barrier (BBB) permeability predictions (Pe = 4.12 ± 0.40) indicated that 12d can 
cross the BBB. 12d's ability to modulate Aβ1-42 self-aggregation was confirmed 
through Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy 
(TEM) analysis. The neuroprotective potential of 12d against oxidative stress 
was further evaluated in SH-SY5Y neuronal cells. Pretreatment followed by the 
co-treatment with 12d at varying concentrations effectively protected the cells 
from H2O2-induced neurotoxicity. Also, 12d significantly reduced intracellular 
reactive oxygen species (ROS), as MitoSOX and H2DCFDA assays demonstrated. 
Finally, in an in vivo scopolamine-induced AD mouse model, 12d improved spatial 
memory in the Y-maze test. Moreover, it effectively restored AChE and BChE 
levels while displaying potent ex vivo antioxidant activity. These findings 
collectively highlight 12d as a promising multitarget-directed ligand (MTDL) 
with therapeutic potential for AD management.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains an incurable neurodegenerative disorder with 
significant diagnostic challenges. The abnormal aggregation of amyloid-β (Aβ) 
and the dysregulated activity of Monoamine Oxidase B (MAO-B) are closely 
associated with the pathogenesis of AD and present promising targets for both 
diagnosis and treatment. Herein we synthesized a series of merocyanine 
derivatives as fluorescent probes for Aβ aggregates via donor-π-acceptor (D-π-A) 
framework. Moreover, the pharmacophore selectively targeting MAO-B was 
introduced into the probes to realize simultaneous integration of diagnosis and 
therapy. Experiments results demonstrate that the representative probe LA4-1 
exhibits low cytotoxicity and high-sensitivity imaging of Aβ aggregates in both 
cellular and AD mouse model. Remarkably, it inhibited Aβ aggregation and MAO-B 
activity, reaching 97 % and 89 %, respectively. Additionally, LA4-1 exhibited 
good MAO-B selectivity and antioxidant capability. Our findings confirm that 
LA4-1 not only possesses superior Aβ imaging capabilities, but also demonstrates 
versatile and effective multimodal drug actions. This research further lays a 
foundation for the creation of potent Aβ-targeted theranostic agents for AD.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Distinguishing neurodegenerative diseases is a 
challenging task requiring neurologic expertise. Clinical decision support 
systems (CDSSs) powered by machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence can 
assist with complex diagnostic tasks by augmenting user capabilities, but 
workflow integration poses many challenges. We propose that a modeling framework 
based on fluorodeoxyglucose PET (FDG-PET) imaging can address these challenges 
and form the basis of an effective CDSS for neurodegenerative disease.
METHODS: This retrospective study focused on FDG-PET images in a discovery 
cohort drawn from 3 research studies plus routine clinical patients. When 
selecting research study participants, the inclusion criterion was the 
availability of an FDG-PET image from within 2.5 years of diagnosis with 1 of 9 
specific neurodegenerative syndromes or designation as unimpaired. Participants 
from disease groups were recruited from the clinical patient population while 
unimpaired participants came primarily from a population study. The discovery 
cohort was used to develop a clinical decision support framework we call 
StateViewer, which applies a neighbor matching algorithm to detect the presence 
of 9 different neurodegenerative phenotypes. The ML performance of this 
framework was evaluated in the discovery cohort by nested cross-validation and 
externally validated in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. 
Potential for clinical integration was demonstrated in a radiologic reader study 
focused on differentiating posterior cortical atrophy from Lewy body dementia.
RESULTS: The discovery cohort contained 3,671 individuals with a mean age of 68 
years and consisted of 49% reported female. Our model framework was able to 
detect the presence of 9 different neurodegenerative phenotypes with a 
sensitivity of 0.89 ± 0.03 and an area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve of 0.93 ± 0.02. In the radiologic reader study, readers 
using our model were found to have 3.3 ± 1.1 times greater odds of making a 
correct diagnosis than readers using a current standard-of-care workflow.
DISCUSSION: Our proposed framework provides strong classification performance 
with high interpretability, and it addresses many of the challenges that face 
clinical integration of ML-based decision support tools. One limitation of this 
study is a uniform discovery cohort that is not representative of other patient 
populations in some regards.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Previous research of associations between statins and 
Alzheimer disease and Alzheimer disease-related dementias (AD/ADRDs) has been 
limited by short follow-up, small samples, and confounding. We aimed to estimate 
the association between the 1st statin prescription and incident AD/ADRD among 
members of a large population-based cohort of older adults.
METHODS: We used a cohort study design emulating a target trial using data from 
Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), an integrated health care delivery 
system. Participants were born before 1951 and KPNC members for 4+ years during 
1997-2010. Embedded subsamples included sociodemographic and genetic data. 
Statin initiators were matched at first prescription ("baseline") with up to 5 
"noninitiators" based on age and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). 
Participants with extreme propensity scores were excluded. The outcome was time 
to incident AD/ADRD diagnosis, censoring, or the administrative end of study 
(December 31, 2020). Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard 
ratios for statin initiation on AD/ADRD incidence. Follow-up time was divided at 
the first year of follow-up to account for increased AD/ADRD detection in the 
first year due to increased interaction with the health care system after a 
statin prescription.
RESULTS: Among eligible participants (n = 705,061), 264,294 individuals (37.5% 
of eligible participants) initiated any statin during 2001-2010 ("initiators"), 
of whom 249,613 (94.4%) were matched with 255,937 unique noninitiators to create 
the analytic sample (322,358 unique participants; mean age at baseline = 67.4 
years; 55.1% female). The average follow-up was 11.8 years. In the first year 
after initiating statins, AD/ADRD diagnoses were elevated by 46% (hazard ratio 
[HR] = 1.46, 95% CI 1.42-1.53) compared with noninitiators. After 1 year, statin 
initiators experienced no difference in AD/ADRD incidence (full sample: HR = 
1.00, 95% CI 0.99-1.01; subsample with survey covariates: HR = 1.01, 95% CI 
0.98-1.06; subsample with survey and genetic covariates: HR = 0.97, 95% CI 
0.91-1.07). Adjustment for sociodemographic covariates and apolipoprotein E e4 
allele count did not materially change the findings.
DISCUSSION: In this large emulated target trial, statin initiation was 
inconsistent with more than a 3% increase or decrease in the hazard of AD/ADRD 
after the first year of follow-up. This intent-to-treat analysis does not 
directly quantify effects of long-term exposure to statins. Associations in the 
first year likely reflect increased medical observation immediately after statin 
initiation.
CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This emulated trial provides Class II evidence that 
statin initiation is not associated with AD/ADRD or AD incidence after the first 
year of follow-up.

Neurodegenerative disorders, including Huntington's disease, Amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease, create more challenges 
as the population gets older and there are no curative therapies available. 
Recent advances in gut microbiome research have spotlighted postbiotics and 
psychobiotics as innovative therapeutic strategies targeting the gut-brain axis 
to alleviate neurodegenerative symptoms and slow disease progression. 
Postbiotics, which are metabolites and cellular components released by probiotic 
bacteria, and psychobiotics, a class of probiotics with potential mental health 
benefits, offer novel approaches to neuroprotection. This chapter examines the 
ways in which postbiotics and psychobiotics modulate inflammation, oxidative 
stress, neurotrophic factors, and gut barrier integrity to provide 
neuroprotective effects. We review scientific research that highlights the 
efficacy of specific microbial strains and their metabolites in enhancing 
cognitive function and reducing neurodegeneration. In addition, we explore the 
consequences of diet and specific nutrition on strengthening the therapeutic 
results of these medications. The purpose of this chapter is to provide a 
detailed analysis of the existing data supporting the use of postbiotics and 
psychobiotics in both the prevention and management of neurological diseases. By 
integrating perspectives from microbiology, neurology, and clinical nutrition, 
we highlight the potential of these interventions to enhance patient outcomes 
and quality of life. In addition, we discuss the translational limitations and 
future research approaches required to successfully transition these 
microbiome-based treatments from the laboratory to clinical practice, 
emphasizing the importance of a holistic and personalized approach in combating 
neurodegenerative diseases.

Piper kadsura (Choisy) Ohwi, a traditional medicinal plant used in East Asia, is 
renowned for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Its bioactive 
components, such as Hancinone and Futoquinol, show potential in treating 
neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aim of the study: 
This study investigates the neuroprotective effects of Piper kadsura extract 
(PK) and its active components, Hancinone (C1) and Futoquinol (C2), in 
Aβ25-35-induced AD models. PK, C1, and C2 were evaluated in Aβ25-35-induced 
PC-12 and N9 cells, as well as a mouse model of AD. Cellular assays, Seahorse 
analysis, and molecular docking were used to explore glycolysis, oxidative 
stress, and apoptosis. Gut microbiota composition was analyzed via 16 S rDNA 
sequencing. PK, C1, and C2 significantly improved cell viability, restored 
glycolysis, and reduced oxidative stress by activating the SIRT1/PPARγ/GLUT1 
pathway. PK also alleviated neuronal damage and enhanced cognitive performance 
in mice. Gut microbiota analysis revealed increased beneficial bacteria (e.g., 
Lactobacillus) and enriched glycolysis-related pathways. Piper kadsura and its 
components exhibit multifaceted neuroprotective effects by modulating energy 
metabolism, reducing oxidative stress, and regulating the gut-brain axis. These 
findings support the therapeutic potential of Piper kadsura in AD treatment.

Aims: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder 
among the elderly. Uric acid (UA), the end product of purine metabolism, 
functions as a potent free radical scavenger and helps mitigate oxidative 
stress. Several epidemiological studies revealed that serum UA levels are 
negatively correlated with the risk of AD; however, the molecular mechanisms 
remain unclear. Notably, β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition is implicated in the 
disruption of mitophagy, leading to neuronal apoptosis. In this study, we aim to 
elucidate the link between UA and AD and explore the underlying mechanisms. 
Results: We demonstrated that UA improved cognitive impairment in 5×FAD mice and 
reduced neuronal apoptosis both in vivo and in vitro. UA reversed the expression 
of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-induced kinase 1 (PINK1), p-ParkinS65, 
parkin, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 II/I, and p62 proteins 
inhibited by Aβ treatment, alleviated Aβ induced mitochondrial dysfunction, and 
disturbed dynamics. We found that UA activated nuclear factor erythroid 
2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/heme oxygenase-1(HO-1) signaling both in vivo and in 
vitro. Furthermore, ML385, a Nrf2-specific inhibitor, reversed the increase in 
mitochondrial membrane potential and mitophagy promoted by UA and increased 
neuronal apoptosis in HT22 cells. The antiapoptotic effects of UA in HT22 cells 
were prevented by treatment with small interfering RNAs targeting PINK1. 
Conclusions and Innovation: These data suggest that UA stimulates 
PINK1/parkin-mediated mitophagy reducing Aβ-induced neuronal apoptosis through 
the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, which plays a neuroprotective role in AD. Our findings 
confirmed that UA effectively reduces neuronal damage and cognitive impairment, 
highlighting its potential clinical applications in the treatment of AD.

This paper is a review of my life as a sleep researcher and clinician. I chanced 
into sleep by being at the right place at the right time. Over the last 45 
years, I became an expert on sleep and circadian rhythms in aging, in 
Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease and in cancer. We were one of the 
first to show how common sleep apnea and periodic limb movements in sleep are in 
the elderly. We "moved" into the nursing home and showed how disrupted sleep is 
in these patients. We used light therapy to improve sleep in the nursing home. 
We studied the effect of CPAP on sleep and cognition in both Alzheimer's disease 
and Parkinson's disease. And we were some of the first to study sleep and 
circadian rhythms in women with breast cancer, starting the evaluations before 
they started their chemotherapy. These studies were both observational and 
treatment studies. I am very proud of the work we did. For me, everything 
revolves around sleep. And that is the beginning of my story.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder marked by 
cognitive deterioration and behavioral symptoms, significantly impacting 
patients and caregivers. Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia 
(BPSD), including agitation, depression, and apathy, are common in AD and 
complicate its management. Conventional treatments, such as cholinesterase 
inhibitors and antipsychotics, offer limited benefits and often carry adverse 
effects. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a non-invasive 
neuromodulatory technique, has emerged as a promising alternative by modulating 
cortical excitability and promoting neuroplasticity. This narrative review aims 
to evaluate the current literature on the therapeutic effects of rTMS in AD, 
with a focus on its impact on cognitive function and behavioral symptoms. A 
comprehensive literature search was conducted across PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, 
Embase, and the Cochrane Library. Studies were selected based on predefined 
inclusion and exclusion criteria, with quality assessed using the Cochrane Risk 
of Bias Tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Findings indicate that 
high-frequency rTMS can improve memory, language, and executive functions, while 
also reducing neuropsychiatric symptoms such as agitation and depression. 
Mechanistically, rTMS appears to influence cortical plasticity, neurotransmitter 
regulation, and neurotrophic factor expression. Despite these encouraging 
outcomes, heterogeneity in study design, stimulation protocols, and patient 
populations limit generalizability. Further research through large-scale, 
standardized, multicentric trials is necessary to confirm its efficacy and 
define optimal therapeutic parameters. In conclusion, rTMS holds promise as an 
adjunctive intervention in AD, potentially improving cognitive and behavioral 
outcomes while offering a favorable safety profile.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder driven by amyloid-β 
accumulation, tau pathology, and synaptic dysfunction. Recent studies highlight 
miR-137, a brain-enriched microRNA, as a pivotal regulator of AD pathogenesis. 
This review synthesizes evidence that miR-137 modulates amyloid-β production, 
tau phosphorylation, synaptic plasticity, and neuroinflammation, while also 
preserving mitochondrial function and mitigating oxidative stress. Notably, 
circulating miR-137 levels correlate with AD progression, offering promise as a 
non-invasive diagnostic biomarker. Beyond diagnostics, miR-137's ability to 
target multiple AD-related pathways positions it as a novel therapeutic 
candidate for neuroprotection. Hence, miR-137 serves as both a biomarker and 
therapeutic target, offering promising strategies to slow AD progression and 
improve outcomes. Our bioinformatic analyses further identify miR-137-regulated 
genes and disrupted networks, underscoring its central role in AD. By bridging 
molecular mechanisms and clinical potential, miR-137-based strategies could 
transform AD management, addressing both pathological hallmarks and cognitive 
decline. Hence, this review article consolidates evidence of miR-137's 
multifaceted functions in AD, encouraging further investigation into its 
molecular mechanisms and translational potential to address this pathogenic 
condition.

Tau phosphorylation plays an important role in brain physiology and pathology. 
During foetal development, it supports microtubule dynamics and neuroplasticity, 
whereas in Alzheimer's disease (AD), it drives pathological tau aggregation and 
tangle formation. In this multicentre study (n = 462), we measured plasma 
phosphorylated-tau217 in healthy newborns, premature infants, patients with AD 
and healthy controls across various age groups. Plasma phosphorylated-tau217 
levels were significantly higher in newborns compared to healthy individuals of 
any age group and even exceeded levels observed in patients with AD. In 
newborns, plasma phosphorylated-tau217 levels inversely correlated with 
perinatal factors such as gestational age. Longitudinal analysis of preterm 
infants demonstrated a decline in serum phosphorylated-tau217 levels over the 
first months of life, approaching levels observed in young adults. In contrast, 
elevated plasma phosphorylated-tau217 in older individuals was associated with 
AD pathology. Our findings corroborate the crucial role of tau phosphorylation 
in early brain development. However, in AD, tau phosphorylation transitions into 
a pathological mechanism. The high levels of blood-based phosphorylated-tau217 
observed at birth and subsequent clearance might indicate distinct regulatory 
mechanisms that prevent tau aggregation in early life. Further studies are 
needed to explore the shared mechanisms of tau phosphorylation in newborns and 
AD.

BACKGROUND: The role of cerebral microvascular dysfunction in early cognitive 
impairment and dementia has become increasingly recognized. Furthermore, 
pathological changes in both Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia are 
almost always associated with cerebral hemodynamic deficits.
AIM: To investigate the diagnostic performance of dynamic contrast-enhanced 
magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) assessment of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) 
in combination with relevant plasma biomarkers for mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI).
METHODS: This study selected 50 patients with non-amnestic MCI (na-MCI group), 
52 patients with amnestic MCI (a-MCI group), and 55 healthy elderly controls 
(control group). The Chinese version of the Montreal cognitive assessment 
(MoCA), auditory verbal learning test (AVLT), Hamilton anxiety/depression scale 
(HAMA/HAMD), and activity of daily living (ADL) scales were used to analyze the 
characteristics of mental and behavioral symptoms of patients with MCI. The 
DCE-MRI technique was used to assess the contrast enhancement kinetics. The 
Patlak model was utilized to analyze the BBB permeability (volume transfer 
constants). Further, fasting blood was was used to quantify plasma homocysteine 
(Hcy), β-amyloid protein (Aβ) 40, Aβ42, human phosphorylated tau-181 protein 
(p-tau181), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion 
molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) levels, as 
well as serum neurofilament light chain (NFL) and glial fibrillary acidic 
protein (GFAP) concentrations.
RESULTS: The na-MCI and a-MCI groups demonstrated significantly lower MoCA and 
AVLT-Huashan version scores, and statistically higher HAMA, HAMD, and ADL scores 
compared to the control group. Moreover, the a-MCI group showed notably higher 
HAMA, HAMD, and ADL scores compared to the na-MCI group. Cranial MRI results 
revealed significant disparities in cerebral blood flow in the left and right 
frontal lobes, temporal lobes, hippocampi, cuneus, precuneus, parietal lobes, 
basal ganglia, and occipital lobes between the a-MCI and na-MCI groups. Compared 
to healthy controls, patients with MCI demonstrated a smaller amplitude of 
hippocampal contrast enhancement kinetics and a slower decay rate, indicating 
smaller vascular volume and increased BBB permeability. Further, Hcy, p-tau181, 
ICAM-1, VCAM-1, PAI-1, and NFL levels were substantially higher in the a-MCI 
group than in the na-MCI group, whereas the Aβ42 level was significantly lower. 
We did not observe any significant differences in Aβ40 and GFAP levels.
CONCLUSION: Patients with MCI may have experienced cerebrovascular system 
changes in the hippocampal region. Disorders associated with changes in cerebral 
blood supply may begin before pathophysiological changes are visible by imaging, 
which provides references for the assessment and treatment of patients with 
cognitive disorders. Further, DCE-MRI provides a noninvasive approach to 
diagnose subtle BBB leakage associated with cerebrovascular pathology.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Most persons with dementia live in the community, 
relying on caregiving networks to meet their needs. Caregiving network precarity 
refers to insecurity or instability in these networks, defined as caregiver(s) 
being unable or unwilling to continue in their role. Given the importance of 
caregiving to aging in place and the high burden associated with dementia 
caregiving, we sought to identify factors associated with caregiving network 
precarity for community-living, dually enrolled persons with dementia.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We linked 2021-2022 administrative, claims, and 
clinical assessment (baseline and follow-up) data for a diverse sample of 
community-living, dually enrolled persons with dementia in New York State. We 
operationalized caregiving network precarity as having one or more caregivers 
report being unable or unwilling to continue providing care. We modelled 
incident caregiving network precarity as a function of care recipient 
characteristics, health services utilization, and caregiving network factors 
using multivariable logistic regression.
RESULTS: Declines in health status among care recipients were strongly 
associated with caregiving network precarity. Individuals were more likely to 
experience caregiving network precarity if they had recently experienced an 
increase in cognitive impairment (aOR: 2.98; 95% CI: 1.97-4.51), functional 
impairment (aOR: 1.71; 95% CI: 1.07-2.74), or bowel incontinence frequency (aOR: 
2.33; 95% CI: 1.38-3.93), or began resisting care (aOR: 2.47; 95% CI: 
1.69-3.61).
DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Findings highlight the importance of identifying 
and addressing shifts in care recipient status and offering targeted supports to 
caregivers during key inflection points in the care recipient's disease 
trajectory.

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) precedes most forms of neurodegenerative 
dementias and is considered an important time window for treatment initiation. 
It is however unclear whether the widespread use of demographically adjusted 
norms improve detection of dementia-related impairment and identification of 
individuals at risk for dementia. In the current multicenter study (n = 561), we 
compared three Petersen/Winblad criteria-based MCI diagnoses with varying levels 
of demographic adjustments, in relation to their associations with biomarkers 
for Alzheimer's disease and neurodegeneration, as well as risk of conversion to 
future dementia. Our MCI diagnoses were (1) demographically unadjusted; (2) 
adjusted for sex and education; or (3) adjusted for age, sex, and education. In 
our cohort, we found the differences between the models to be small, albeit 
consistent, and our results show a tendency for an unadjusted MCI diagnosis to 
be more strongly associated to dementia biomarkers and conversion to dementia. 
Our results thus suggest that an MCI diagnosis based on unadjusted test scores 
may provide a more valid diagnosis of prodromal dementia, while no evidence is 
provided to support this in other contexts. This goes against the 
recommendations from the major diagnostic classification systems, indicating the 
need for further research to explore these relationships.

Analysis of 470,000 exome-sequenced UK biobank participants identifies genes 
containing rare variants which confer dementia risk.

Previous studies have reported that rare coding variants in a handful of genes 
have major effects on risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A recent exome wide 
association study (ExWAS) of dementia in a subset of the UK Biobank cohort 
implicated a number of genes, including five which were novel. Here we report a 
similar analysis, carried out on the full cohort of 470,000 exome-sequenced 
participants. A score was assigned to each participant depending on individual 
and/or parental diagnosis of dementia. Regression analysis including APOE ε3 and 
ε4 doses as covariates was applied to gene-wise tests for association with loss 
of function (LOF) and nonsynonymous variants. 45 tests using different 
pathogenicity predictors were applied to the first cohort of 200,000 
participants. Subsequently the 100 genes showing strongest evidence for 
association were analysed in the second cohort of 270,000 participants, using 
only the best-performing predictor for each gene. Three genes achieved 
statistical significance, TREM2, SORL1 and ABCA7. The five genes reported as 
novel in the ExWAS did not produce any appreciable evidence for association in 
this study. The effects and frequencies of variants in different functional 
categories were characterised for these genes. Rare coding variants in a small 
number of genes have important effects on dementia risk. Further study of 
individual variant effects might elucidate mechanisms of pathogenesis. 
Incorporating rare variant effects for individual risk assessment might become 
important if preventative treatments for dementia become available. This 
research has been conducted using the UK Biobank Resource.

INTRODUCTION: Not only drug and non-drug development but also non-therapeutic 
research in Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical trials is unclear.
METHODS: The participants were AD clinical trials obtained from the 
clinicaltrials.gov registry. The research objectives and interventions of those 
trials were analyzed. Bibliometric network analysis of those published articles 
in PubMed was also conducted.
RESULTS: A total of 1681 clinical trials and 565 corresponding published 
articles in the past 20 years were included in the analysis. "Safety", "dose", 
"adverse events", and "biomarker" were the most frequently used words that 
appeared in the title or abstract of published articles. The top three classes 
of 362 drugs were anti-Amyloid, enhancing acetylcholine, neurotransmitter, or 
targeting its receptor. The physical therapy, diet, and cognitive training 
ranked as the first three classes of non-drug therapy. Imaging, risk factors, 
and molecular biomarkers were the three most abundant categories in 
non-therapeutic research, and three fields of prevention, risk factors, and the 
dental or intestinal microbiome showed an escalated trend (All Ptrend < 0.05).
DISSUSION: The results described a comprehensive landscape for the clinical 
studies of AD. Although most drugs treated AD abortively, the success of 
lecanemab and decanemab provides confidence for us to further study the 
pathogenesis of AD and explore new therapeutic targets to develop anti-AD drugs. 
Rising non-drug and non-therapeutic research will provide more possible methods 
for the treatment and prevention of AD in thefuture.

As population aging becomes an increasingly critical global issue, the incidence 
of central nervous system (CNS) diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
Parkinson's disease (PD), and stroke, has risen sharply. However, the 
blood-brain barrier (BBB) presents a significant obstacle to the effective 
treatment of these CNS disorders, limiting the ability of therapeutic agents to 
reach the brain. In this context, intranasal drug delivery, which bypasses the 
BBB, has attracted considerable attention in recent years. By utilizing pathways 
such as the olfactory and trigeminal nerves, intranasal drug delivery 
facilitates the rapid transport of drugs to the brain, thereby enhancing both 
the bioavailability and targeting efficiency of the drugs. This review provides 
an overview of the molecular mechanisms underlying intranasal drug delivery, its 
advancements in the treatment of CNS diseases, strategies to improve delivery 
efficiency, and a discussion of the challenges and potential future directions 
in this field. The aim of this paper is to offer valuable insights and guidance 
for researchers and clinicians working in the area of CNS disease treatment.

Human Alpha Herpesviruses Infections (HSV1, HSV2, and VZV), Alzheimer's Disease, 
and the Potential Benefits of Targeted Treatment or Vaccination-A Virological 
Perspective.

Understanding the contribution of human herpesviruses to the aetiology of 
neurodegenerative diseases is an emerging field of interest. The association of 
Epstein-Barr virus with multiple sclerosis is the most researched example; 
however, the definitive proof of causation is still lacking. Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) is the most common form of dementia and typically manifests in individuals 
aged over 65 years; however, it also occurs in a small number of individuals 
aged less than 65 years. A combination of environmental, genetic, and lifestyle 
factors is believed to contribute to the development of AD. There have been 
several reports describing potential associations of infections or reactivations 
of human alphaherpesviruses with AD. A particular characteristic of human 
alphaherpesviruses (herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2, varicella zoster virus) is 
that they are neurotropic and that lifelong infection (latency) is established 
mainly in the dorsal root and trigeminal ganglia. There have also been reports 
that suppression of alphaherpesvirus infections through either vaccination or 
the application of antiviral treatments may be protective against the 
development of AD. Zoster vaccines and acyclovir may prove to be effective 
interventions for preventing or limiting the progression of AD. This is 
particularly relevant as there are currently no available cheap and effective 
treatments for AD. In this review, the basic virology of human 
alphaherpesviruses is described followed by their epidemiology and associations 
with AD. Finally, the prevention and treatment of human alphaherpesviruses are 
considered in the context of potential applications for the prevention of AD.

specifically, maintaining/reestablishing tissue integrity, remains a central 
challenge in pharmacology, particularly when the process is misdirected or not 
properly controlled. Robert and Szabo's concept of cytoprotection holds that 
innate cell (epithelial (Robert), endothelial (Szabo)) integrity and 
protection/maintenance/reestablishment in the stomach is translated to other 
organ therapy (cytoprotection → organoprotection) via the cytoprotection agent's 
effect. Therefore, we defend stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 therapy's 
efficacy and pleiotropic beneficial effects, along with its high safety (LD1 not 
achieved), against speculation of its negative impact, speculation of 
angiogenesis toward tumorigenesis, increased NO and eNOS, damaging free radical 
formation, and neurodegenerative diseases (Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's 
disease). Contrarily, in wound healing and general healing capabilities, as 
reviewed, as a cytoprotective agent and native cytoprotection mediator, BPC 157 
controls angiogenesis and the NO-system's healing functions and counteracts the 
pathological presentation of neurodegenerative diseases in acknowledged animal 
models (i.e., Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease), and it presents 
prominent anti-tumor potential in vivo and in vitro. BPC 157 resolved cornea 
transparency maintenance, cornea healing "angiogenic privilege" (vs. 
angiogenesis/neovascularization/tumorigenesis), and it does not produce corneal 
neovascularization but rather opposes it. Per Folkman's concept, it demonstrates 
an anti-tumor effect in vivo and in vitro. BPC 157 exhibits a distinctive effect 
on the NO-level (increase vs. decrease), always combined with the counteraction 
of free radical formation, and, in mice and rats, BPC 157 therapy counteracts 
Parkinson's disease-like and Alzheimer's disease-like disturbances. Thus, BPC 
157 therapy means targeting angiogenesis and NO's cytotoxic and damaging actions 
but maintaining, promoting, or recovering their essential protective functions.

Multitarget drugs are molecules with the ability to act simultaneously on 
different targets at the same time, and they have been evaluated in the last 
decade as a powerful tool in the development of promising therapeutics for 
neurodegenerative diseases. This is very useful for multifactorial diseases such 
as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases, a group of neurological 
disorders that induce neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. Successful drug 
design for multifactorial diseases depends on an interdisciplinary and 
collaborative approach. The complexity of the above pathologies has clearly 
demonstrated that such single-target drugs are inadequate to achieve a 
successful therapeutic result. Furthermore, molecules hitting more than one 
biological target exhibit also a safer profile. In this review, we present a 
comprehensive knowledge of recent research on multitarget synthetic approaches 
to confront Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's neurodegenerative 
diseases.

Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common dementia, characterized 
by significant cognitive impairments and neural network dysfunction. Currently, 
multiple therapeutic strategies are being developed to design effective anti-AD 
drugs. Among them, Withaferin A (WA), a natural steroidal lactone extracted from 
Withania somnifera leaves, has been shown to reduce amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide 
levels in vitro. However, its potential to improve cognitive function in AD 
remains unclear. Methods: In this study, 5xFAD mice were administered WA (2 
mg/kg intraperitoneally every 2 days) for 14 days, and its neuroprotective 
effects were evaluated through behavioral tests, wide-field imaging, 
immunohistochemistry, and ELISA. Results: WA significantly improved short-term 
memory, as evidenced by enhanced performance in the Novel Object Recognition 
Test (NORT) (p < 0.001, n = 10), Novel Location Recognition Test (NLRT) (p < 
0.01, n = 14), and Three-Chamber Social Test (TCST) (p < 0.001, n = 8). WA also 
ameliorated long-term memory deficits in the Morris Water Maze Test (MWMT) (p < 
0.05, n = 7). Furthermore, cortical wide-field Ca2+ imaging revealed that WA 
treatment rescued slow-wave impairments by enhancing long-range coherence 
(0.8363 ± 0.0185, p < 0.01, n = 8) and reducing the frequency of slow-wave 
activity (0.6578 ± 0.0512 Hz, p < 0.01, n = 8). Additionally, WA treatment 
significantly reduced Aβ plaque deposition in both cortical and hippocampal 
regions. Conclusions: These findings suggest that WA may be a promising 
therapeutic agent for AD, exerting neuroprotective effects.

Lipid metabolism disorders represent a significant risk factor for the 
pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Apolipoprotein E (APOE) has been 
regarded as a pivotal regulator of lipid homeostasis in the central nervous 
system (CNS), with polymorphic alleles identified as genetic risk factors for 
late-onset AD. Despite advances in APOE research and the development of numerous 
pharmaceutical approaches targeting distinct APOE isoforms, there remain limited 
treatment approaches for AD that focus on lipid metabolic homeostasis. 
Consequently, it is necessary to reevaluate the lipid metabolic process in the 
CNS. Apolipoprotein A1 (APOA-I), a major component of high-density lipoprotein 
(HDL), plays a crucial role in reverse cholesterol transport from tissues to the 
liver to maintain lipid homeostasis. Over the past few decades, numerous studies 
have suggested a connection between reduced APOA-I levels and a higher risk of 
AD. APOA-I is synthesized exclusively in the liver and intestines, and there is 
a lack of conclusive evidence supporting its functional significance within the 
central nervous system, in contrast to APOE, which is produced locally by glial 
cells and neurons within the CNS. Moreover, APOA-I's ability to penetrate the 
blood-brain barrier (BBB) is still poorly understood, which causes its 
significance in central lipid metabolism and AD pathophysiology to be mainly 
disregarded. Recent advancements in tracing methodologies have underscored the 
essential role of APOA-I in regulating lipid metabolism in the CNS. This review 
aims to elucidate the physiological functions and metabolic pathways of APOA-I, 
integrating its associations with AD-related pathologies, risk factors, and 
potential therapeutic targets. Through this discourse, we aim to provide novel 
insights into the intricate relationship between AD and APOA-I, paving the way 
for future research in this field.

Background/Objectives: Glaucoma and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are 
neurodegenerative conditions with vascular underpinnings. This study aimed to 
explore the relationship between blood pressure parameters such as mean arterial 
pressure (MAP), pulse pressure (PP), and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and 
cognitive performance in patients with AD, normal-tension glaucoma (NTG), and 
healthy controls. We hypothesized that NTG patients, like those with mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI), may experience subtle cognitive changes related to 
vascular dysregulation. Methods: Ninety-eight participants (35 NTG, 17 AD, 46 
controls) were assessed for CPP, MAP, OPP, and cognitive performance. 
Statistical analyses compared groups and examined correlations. Results: AD 
patients showed lower CPP and MAP (p < 0.001), indicating systemic vascular 
dysfunction, while NTG patients had higher ocular perfusion pressure (OPP) (p = 
0.008), suggesting compensatory mechanisms. CPP correlated with visuospatial 
abilities in AD (r = 0.492, p = 0.045). MAP correlated with the Clock drawing 
test (CDT) scores in the NTG group (r = 0.378, p = 0.025). PP negatively 
correlated with cognition in AD (r = -0.527, p = 0.016 for CDT scores) and 
controls (r = -0.440, p = 0.002 for verbal fluency and r = -0.348, p = 0.019 for 
total ACE scores). Conclusions: The study highlights distinct hemodynamic 
profiles: systemic dysfunction in AD and localized dysregulation in NTG. These 
findings emphasize the role of vascular dysregulation in neurodegeneration, with 
implications for personalized treatment approaches targeting vascular health in 
neurodegenerative conditions.

The incorporation of selenium into tacrine derivatives has been explored as a 
novel strategy to enhance therapeutic efficacy while minimizing toxicity in the 
treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's. This study utilized 
computational and experimental approaches, including Density Functional Theory 
(DFT), molecular docking, pharmacokinetic profiling, and toxicological 
predictions, to evaluate the potential of these derivatives. The 
selenium-modified compounds demonstrated improved electronic properties, such as 
narrower HOMO-LUMO gaps and optimized electronegativity, resulting in enhanced 
stability and reactivity. Pharmacokinetic analyses revealed favorable 
absorption, distribution, and blood-brain barrier penetration, while 
toxicological assessments indicated reduced hepatotoxicity and skin 
sensitization risks compared to tacrine. Molecular docking and dynamic 
simulations highlighted strong and stable interactions of the derivatives with 
critical enzymes, including acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and beta-secretases 
(BACE1 and BACE2). Compounds 12 and 13, in particular, emerged as the most 
promising candidates due to their superior stability and binding affinity. These 
findings underscore the potential of selenium-modified tacrine derivatives as 
safer and more effective therapeutic agents for Alzheimer's disease, warranting 
further experimental validation.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by cognitive decline, memory loss and limited therapeutic options. 
Metal-based drugs have emerged as promising alternatives in the search for 
effective treatments, and vanadium coordination complexes have shown significant 
potential due to their neuroprotective and anti-aggregant properties. This 
review explores the advances in the development of vanadium-based metallodrugs 
for AD, focusing on their ability to modulate amyloid-beta (Aβ) aggregation, 
oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. Recent in vitro and in vivo studies 
highlight the efficacy of oxovanadium (IV) and peroxovanadium (V) complexes in 
inhibiting Aβ fibril formation and reducing neuronal toxicity. Additionally, the 
interaction of vanadium complexes with key biological targets, such as 
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and protein-tyrosine 
phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), suggests a multifaceted therapeutic approach. While 
these findings underscore the potential of vanadium compounds as innovative 
treatments for AD, further research is needed to optimize their bioavailability, 
selectivity, and safety for clinical applications.

INTRODUCTION: Recent studies have found that gut microbial tryptophan metabolism 
is altered in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. However, the functional 
consequences of these changes and their therapeutic potential remain unclear.
METHODS: The metagenomic data of 49 preclinical AD patients and 115 healthy 
controls were analyzed. A synbiotic with targeted metabolic functions was 
formulated based on in vitro testing, and its effect on AD was evaluated using 
female 5×FAD mice.
RESULTS: Indole lactic acid (ILA) synthesis was downregulated in AD patients. 
Synbiotic treatment combining Lactobacillus suilingensis and inulin outperformed 
probiotic treatment alone in enhancing tryptophan metabolism, and increasing ILA 
biosynthesis. Increased ILA could reduce Aβ accumulation and significantly 
alleviate cognitive impairment in female AD mice by inhibiting neuroinflammation 
through activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signaling pathway.
DISCUSSION: This study highlights the therapeutic potential of targeting gut 
microbial tryptophan metabolism in AD and provides a rationale for future 
precision strategies aimed at modulating microbiota-derived metabolic pathways.
HIGHLIGHTS: Gut metagenomic analysis reveals reduced indole lactic acid (ILA) 
biosynthesis genes in preclinical AD patients. Screening and formulating 
ILA-producing synbiotic by using whole-genome analysis. Synbiotic treatment 
alleviates cognitive impairment and promotes ILA synthesis in female 5×FAD mice. 
ILA alleviates neuroinflammation in female 5×FAD mice by activating aryl 
hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in the brain. Synbiotic targeting tryptophan 
metabolism provides a novel approach for Alzheimer's intervention.

γ neuromodulation has emerged as a promising strategy for addressing 
neurological and psychiatric disorders, particularly in regulating executive and 
cognitive functions. This review explores the latest neuromodulation techniques, 
focusing on the critical role of γ oscillations in various brain disorders. 
Direct γ neuromodulation induces γ-frequency oscillations to synchronize 
disrupted brain networks, while indirect methods influence γ oscillations by 
modulating cortical excitability. We investigate how monitoring dynamic features 
of γ oscillations allows for detailed evaluations of neuromodulation 
effectiveness. By targeting γ oscillatory patterns and restoring healthy 
cross-frequency coupling, interventions may alleviate cognitive and behavioral 
symptoms linked to disrupted communication. This review examines clinical 
applications of γ neuromodulations, including enhancing cognitive function 
through 40 Hz multisensory stimulation in Alzheimer's disease, improving motor 
function in Parkinson's disease, controlling seizures in epilepsy, and 
modulating emotional dysfunctions in depression. Additionally, these 
neuromodulation strategies aim to regulate excitatory-inhibitory imbalances and 
restore γ synchrony across neurological and psychiatric disorders. The review 
highlights the potential of γ oscillations as biomarkers to boost restorative 
results in clinical applications of neuromodulation. Future studies might focus 
on integrating multimodal personalized protocols, artificial intelligence (AI) 
driven frameworks for neural decoding, and global multicenter collaborations to 
standardize and scale precision treatments across diverse disorders.

BACKGROUND: With the availability of first disease-modifying treatments, 
evidence on costs across the entire Alzheimer's Continuum, especially for early 
disease stages, becomes increasingly important to inform healthcare planning, 
resource allocation, and policy decisions. This study assessed costs and 
cost-associated factors in patients with subjective cognitive decline (SCD), 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) dementia compared 
to healthy controls.
METHODS: The German DELCODE cohort study assessed clinical data, healthcare 
resource use, and informal care provision. Costs were calculated from payer and 
societal perspectives using standardized unit costs, and multivariate regression 
analyses identified cost-associated factors.
RESULTS: From a payer perspective, costs were elevated by 26% for SCD (adjusted 
mean 5,976€ [95%CI 4,598-7,355€]), 85% for MCI (8,795€ [6,200-11,391€]) and 36% 
for AD (6,454€ [2,796-10,111€]) compared to controls (4,754€ [3,586-5,922€]). 
Societal costs were elevated by 52% for SCD (adjusted mean 8,377€ 
[95%CI 6,009-10,746€]), 170% for MCI (14,886€ [9,524-20,248€]) and 307% for AD 
(22,481€ [9,994-34,969€]) compared to controls (5,522€ [3,814-7,230€]). APOE e4 
negative patients showed higher costs compared to APOE e4 positive patients. 
Hypertension was associated with higher costs.
CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare costs are already elevated in early subjective and 
objective cognitive impairment, driven by formal and informal care. The study 
emphasizes the importance of early interventions to reduce the economic burden 
and delay progression.

Cognitive dysfunction often occurs in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, 
cerebrovascular disease, or other neurodegenerative diseases, and can 
significantly impact the life quality of patients and create serious social, 
psychological, and economic burdens for individuals and their families. Numerous 
studies have confirmed that exercise can slow the decline in cognitive function 
through multiple pathways, in which fibronectin type III domain-containing 
protein 5 (FNDC5) plays an important role. However, the current research on the 
modulation of FNDC5 by exercise and its ability to improve hippocampal cognitive 
function lacks a systematic and comprehensive understanding. Therefore, this 
review focuses on the latest research progress regarding the role of 
exercise-induced FNDC5 in cognitive function, systematically reviews the 
positive effects of FNDC5 on cognitive function impairment caused by various 
factors, and clarifies the specific mechanisms by which exercise-induced FNDC5 
improves cognitive function by inhibiting neuroinflammation and improving 
hippocampal neurogenesis and hippocampal synaptic plasticity. Based on the 
existing literature, we also identify the areas that require further research in 
this field. Overall, this review provides a theoretical basis for exercise-based 
prevention and improvement of cognitive function impairment.

A series of 35C-1-alkynylated THIQ compounds (25 new and 10 known) was 
synthesized, and their inhibitory potential against monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) 
and cholinesterase enzymes was assessed by evaluating the effects of introducing 
substituents at R1, R2, and on the phenylacetylene motif. Drug-likeness, 
including stability, lipophilicity and membrane permeability, was assessed 
theoretically and using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography and 
parallel artificial membrane assays. The cytotoxic effects were evaluated on 
three human cell lines. The inhibition mechanism was examined by analysing the 
reversibility of inhibition combined with kinetic and fluorescence measurements 
and docking studies. Structure-activity relationship studies revealed that 
introducing of an alkynyl group at the C-1 position of the N-aryl-THIQs 
significantly influenced their inhibitory potential towards MAO-B and 
cholinesterase enzymes, with the effects being primarily determined by the 
nature of the substituents on the phenylacetylene motif and at the R2 position. 
Only fluoro substitution at R1 led to a significant reduction in inhibition 
potency for cholinesterase enzyme while in the case of MAO-B any R1 substituent 
was found to notably diminish the inhibitory potential. With low cytotoxic 
effects, satisfactory stability, and the ability to cross a blood-brain barrier, 
the synthesized compounds are promising candidates for further optimization in 
AD drug discovery.

Dendrobium officinale, a traditional edible and medicinal plant, possesses 
significant medicinal and nutritional value. Specifically, the neuroprotective 
effect of Dendrobium officinale polysaccharide (DOP) has been increasingly 
recognized. However, the precise mechanism through which DOP exerts its 
neuroprotective effects remains incompletely elucidated. Accordingly, the 
present study integrated pharmacodynamics, serum metabolomics, lipidomics and 
hippocampal proteomics analyses to investigate the therapeutic effects of DOP 
and elucidate its underlying mechanisms in AD mice. Results showed that DOP 
significantly ameliorated cognitive impairment and hippocampal pathological 
damage in AD mice. Metabolomic and proteomic analyses revealed that DOP 
effectively reversed 43 differential metabolites (polar metabolites and lipids) 
and 137 different proteins. Joint analysis combined with Western blot validation 
suggested that the GnRH signaling pathway may function as a predominant 
neuroprotective mechanism associated with DOP. Collectively, this study provides 
novel evidence for DOP as a potential drug candidate for treating AD.

Clioquinol (CQ), a halogenated 8-hydroxyquinoline, was once an oral 
antiparasitic for intestinal amoebiasis in the 1950s-1970s but was withdrawn due 
to neurotoxicity. Lately, it shows activities beyond antimicrobials, like in 
osteoarthritis and neurodegenerative diseases, yet its anti-aging effects are 
unclear. This study used Drosophila melanogaster to test CQ's effects on healthy 
aging and age-related diseases. Results showed CQ extended lifespan in normal or 
high-fat diet flies, enhanced stress resistance and glycolipid metabolism, 
improved motility, and prevented intestinal inflammation and obesity, and 
alleviated age-related digestive decline. In addition, CQ also prolonged 
lifespan and improved motor activity in Alzheimer's flies. Gene-deficient 
lifespan experiments and transcriptomic analysis revealed CQ's anti-aging 
mechanisms involving multiple signaling pathways, such as differential gene 
expression in HIF-1 signaling, Notch signaling, P53 signaling, JAK-STAT 
signaling, FOXO signaling, and IL-17 signaling pathway, activated TNF signaling 
and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and inhibited mTOR signaling pathway. Overall, 
CQ shows promise as a candidate for anti-aging interventions and treating 
aging-related diseases.

Nucleocytoplasmic transport defects are observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 
frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Here, we assess mRNA nucleocytoplasmic 
localization by performing transcriptome-wide profiling on nuclear and 
cytoplasmic fractions of human iPSC-derived cortical neurons from healthy 
individuals compared to those with familial AD or FTD. We find that AD- and 
FTD-causing mutations induce significant changes in mRNA nucleocytoplasmic 
distribution. We additionally observe the redistribution of mitochondria-related 
transcripts across AD and FTD neurons. The significantly increased mitochondrial 
RNA (mtRNA) in the cytosol of AD and FTD mutant neurons raised the possibility 
of leakage, which motivated us to investigate mtDNA leakage. We reveal abnormal 
cytoplasmic accumulation of mtDNA in AD and FTD cortical neurons together with 
evidence of mitochondrial aberrance. Importantly, mislocalisation of nucleic 
acids, mitochondrial dysfunction and cGAS-STING activation can be ameliorated 
through VCP D2 ATPase inhibition.

Myeloid cells, including brain-resident microglia and peripheral macrophages, 
play key roles in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Studying their disease-associated states is limited by the lack of robust in 
vitro models. Here, we test whether a cytokine mix (interleukin [IL]-4, CSF1, 
IL-34, and transforming growth factor-β) reprograms human THP-1 macrophages 
toward AD-relevant phenotypes. This treatment induces significant transcriptomic 
changes, driving THP-1 macrophages toward a transcriptional state reminiscent of 
disease-associated microglia and lipid-associated macrophages (LAM), 
collectively referred to as DLAM. Transcriptome profiling reveals gene 
expression changes related to oxidative phosphorylation, lysosome function, and 
lipid metabolism. Single-cell RNA sequencing shows an increased proportion of 
DLAM clusters in cytokine mix-treated THP-1 macrophages. Functional assays 
demonstrate alterations in cell motility, phagocytosis, lysosomal activity, and 
metabolic profiles. These findings provide insights into cytokine-mediated 
reprogramming of macrophages toward disease-relevant states, highlighting their 
role in neurodegenerative diseases and potential for therapeutic development.

OBJECTIVE: Compared to nouns, the impairment of the capacity of retrieving verbs 
in spoken production is much less documented. In the clinical field, there are 
also very few tests that have been developed specifically for verb anomia. 
Clinicians and researchers lack a concise and practical naming test to assess 
verb anomia, a condition that can occur in adults and the elderly due to various 
factors. The aim of this study was to adapt the Quebec Action Video Naming 
Test-30 items (DVAQ-30) into Turkish, establish its validity and develop 
normative data adapted to the Turkish population.
METHOD: This research consists of three studies. In Study 1, the DVAQ-30 was 
linguistically and culturally adapted to the Turkish language, resulting in the 
DVAQ-TR. In Study 2, a group of adults and older Turkish-speaking people were 
assessed with the DVAQ-TR to obtain normative data. In Study 3, the psychometric 
properties of the DVAQ-TR (known-group discriminant validity and convergent 
validity) were investigated by comparing the performance of healthy individuals 
and patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or with Alzheimer's disease 
(AD).
RESULTS: Normative data were obtained based on the performance of 424 
participants aged between 18 and 81 years. The percentiles were stratified 
according to the sociodemographic influencing variables of age, sex and level of 
education. The DVAQ-TR had good convergent validity and distinguished the 
performance of healthy participants from that of participants with MCI or AD.
CONCLUSIONS: The DVAQ-TR fills an important gap and has the capacity to assist 
clinicians and researchers in more accurately identifying acquired verb anomia, 
including in people with MCI or AD.
WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: What is already known on this subject Verb anomia is a 
frequent symptom in various neurocognitive disorders, yet it remains 
under-assessed in clinical settings, especially compared to noun naming. 
Existing tools in Turkish primarily focus on object naming and often rely on 
static images, which may not effectively capture action concepts. Recent studies 
suggest that video-based assessments provide a more ecologically valid approach 
to verb naming evaluation. What this study adds to existing knowledge This study 
presents the Turkish adaptation and validation of the DVAQ-30, a video-based 
verb naming test, offering culturally and linguistically appropriate normative 
data for Turkish-speaking adults and elderly individuals. It also demonstrates 
that the DVAQ-TR successfully differentiates between healthy controls and 
individuals with MCI or Alzheimer's disease and shows good convergent validity 
with the Boston Naming Test. These findings highlight the clinical utility of 
the DVAQ-TR in detecting verb anomia in Turkish-speaking populations. What are 
the clinical implications of this study? The DVAQ-TR provides clinicians with a 
quick, valid, and culturally sensitive tool for assessing verb anomia in adults 
with suspected neurocognitive impairments. It enhances diagnostic accuracy and 
may inform tailored language intervention strategies in individuals with MCI and 
Alzheimer's disease. The availability of Turkish normative data ensures accurate 
interpretation of test results across different age, sex, and education groups.

Fabomotizole is an original anxiolytic agent developed at the Federal Research 
Center for Innovator and Emerging Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Technologies 
that acts on a number of important receptor systems of the brain. In a model of 
Parkinson's disease induced in rats by a course of rotenone administration, 
fabomotizole attenuated manifestations of behavioral impairments and influenced 
the profile and relative content of brain proteins. Five days after the last 
administration of rotenone, the fabomotizole effect on the behavioral reactions 
of rats persisted. According to the proteomic study, the profile of brain 
proteins and changes in their relative content differed significantly from the 
results obtained immediately after the last administration of rotenone, as well 
as rotenone in combination with fabomotizole. Changes in the relative content of 
almost all proteins detected immediately after the last administration of 
rotenone or rotenone with fabomotizole were not detectable five days later. 
However, at this time point, there were changes in the relative content of other 
proteins associated with neurodegeneration in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's 
diseases. Such dynamics suggests a wave-like change in the content of 
pathogenetically important brain proteins involved in the mechanisms of 
neurodegeneration and neuroprotection.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the largest global health burden among age-related 
conditions; it involves inflammation, plaque buildup, and oxidative stress 
combined with tangles that lead to brain atrophy and a decline in cognitive 
function. Though intensive research efforts have been focused on identifying the 
etiology of AD, its causative factors, especially concerning therapeutic 
interventions that can make a significant impact in this regard, are relatively 
vague due to several impediments such as the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Prodrugs 
and nanomedicine deliver new promising alternatives for drug administration over 
the BBB with better therapeutic results. This paper documents several prodrugs 
created for AD along with in vitro techniques for analyzing prodrug kinetics and 
recently developed nanotechnology-based delivery systems. The innovations 
discussed herein aim to enhance the bioavailability, stability, and activity of 
drugs toward offering better treatment opportunities as well as new research 
avenues against AD.

The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is complex, and there are currently 
no effective therapeutic drugs available. Growing evidence suggested that 
dietary factors may play a vital role in the prevention and mitigation of AD. In 
this study, we investigated the effects of ergothioneine (ET), administered 
through drinking water for 6 months, on cognitive impairment in APPswe/PS 1dE9 
(APP/PS1) mice. Treatment with ET (40 mg/kg) significantly enhanced cognitive 
function, reduced neuronal damage, decreased Aβ accumulation, suppressed 
microglial overactivation, and lowered TNF-α expression in the mouse brain. 
Moreover, ET treatment partially restored neurotransmitter and chemokine 
homeostasis in the brain. Notably, ET administration reshaped the gut microbiota 
of APP/PS1 mice, including increased abundance of Alistipes, 
Clostridiales_unclassified, and Peptococcaceae_unclassified. ET also enhanced 
the formation of butyric acid, isobutyric acid, and valeric acid. Serum 
metabolomic analysis revealed distinct metabolic profiles of APP/PS1 from 
wild-type (WT) mice, with sphingolipids and glycerophospholipids identified as 
the most enriched pathways influenced by ET treatment. Correlation analysis 
elucidated the alterations in gut microbiota networks, contributions of the gut 
microbiota to short-chain fatty acids and serum metabolic profiles, and 
mediatory roles of metabolites between the gut microbiota and AD. Altogether, 
this study elucidated the protective effects of ET on the gut-brain axis in AD, 
underscoring its potential as an early dietary intervention to improve memory 
function and alleviate AD symptoms. These findings provide a foundational and 
theoretical basis for the development of ET-based dietary strategies for AD 
prevention.

Brain structural volumes are highly heritable and are linked to multiple 
neuropsychological outcomes, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Genome-wide 
association studies have successfully identified genetic variants associated 
with intracranial volume (ICV), total brain volume (TBV), hippocampal volume 
(HV), and lateral ventricular volume (LVV). However, these studies mostly 
focused on common genetic variants with minor allele frequencies (MAF) > 1%, and 
individuals included in most of these studies were of predominantly European 
ancestry. Here, we performed whole-genome sequence (WGS) association studies of 
MRI brain volumes in 7,674 individuals of diverse race and ethnicity from the 
Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program. We identified novel genetic 
loci on chromosomes 13 and 16 near LINC00598 and CACNG3 associated with HV and 
TBV, respectively (lead variants rs115674829, P-value = 1.7×10-9 in pooled 
analysis and rs150440001, P-value = 6.6×10-9 in black participants). Both lead 
variant minor A alleles are rarer in white participants (MAF = 0.14% and 0.03%) 
and in Hispanic participants (MAF = 1.5% and 0.17%) but more common in black 
participants (MAF = 13% and 1.5%). Rare variant aggregated analyses identified 
RIPK1, a gene encoding a kinase involved in neuroinflammation and promising 
target for AD treatment, suggestively associated with LVV (P-value=5×10-6). This 
study provides new insights into the genetic correlates of brain structural 
volumes and illustrates the importance of leveraging WGS data and cohorts of 
diverse race and ethnicity to better characterize the genetic architecture of 
complex polygenic traits.

BACKGROUND: High intake of red and/or processed meat are established colorectal 
cancer (CRC) risk factors. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have reported 
204 variants (G) associated with CRC risk. We used functional annotation data to 
identify subsets of variants within known pathways and constructed pathway-based 
Polygenic Risk Scores (pPRS) to model pPRS x environment (E) interactions.
METHODS: A pooled sample of 30,812 cases and 40,504 CRC controls of European 
ancestry from 27 studies were analyzed. Quantiles for red and processed meat 
intake were constructed. The 204 GWAS variants were annotated to genes with 
AnnoQ and assessed for overrepresentation in PANTHER-reported pathways. pPRS's 
were constructed from significantly overrepresented pathways. Covariate-adjusted 
logistic regression models evaluated pPRSxE interactions with red or processed 
meat intake in relation to CRC risk.
RESULTS: A total of 30 variants were overrepresented in four pathways: Alzheimer 
disease-presenilin, Cadherin/WNT-signaling, Gonadotropin-releasing hormone 
receptor, and TGF-β signaling. We found a significant interaction between 
TGF-β-pPRS and red meat intake (p = 0.003). When variants in the TGF-β pathway 
were assessed, significant interactions with red meat for rs2337113 (intron 
SMAD7 gene, Chr18), and rs2208603 (intergenic region BMP5, Chr6) (p = 0.013 & 
0.011, respectively) were observed. We did not find evidence of pPRS x red meat 
interactions for other pathways or with processed meat.
CONCLUSIONS: This pathway-based interaction analysis revealed a significant 
interaction between variants in the TGF-β pathway and red meat consumption that 
impacts CRC risk.
IMPACT: These findings shed light into the possible mechanistic link between CRC 
risk and red meat consumption.

BACKGROUND: Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for Alzheimer's 
Disease and related dementias (ADRD) have increased statistical power via larger 
analysis datasets from biobanks by 1) including non-age-matched controls and 
prevalent cases, and/or 2) including individuals who report a family history of 
ADRD as proxy cases. However, these methods have the potential to increase noise 
and distort genetic associations which are important for genomic-informed 
prevention and treatment of ADRD. Here, we sought to understand how the effect 
sizes of genetic associations in ADRD could be sensitive to these methodological 
choices, using APOE genotypes as an example.
METHODS: Participants in the All of Us Research Program over the age of 49 at 
enrollment (n=258,693) were assigned one of four categories: incident ADRD 
(developed after enrollment in All of Us), prevalent ADRD (present on 
enrollment), proxy ADRD (participant noted a family history of ADRD), and 
control (no history or diagnosis of ADRD). Dementia diagnoses were determined 
using available Electronic Health Records (EHR) and APOE genotype was determined 
using whole-genome sequencing. Effect sizes for the associations between APOE 
risk alleles and ADRD diagnoses were compared using polychotomous logistic 
regression.
RESULTS: The mean age of the cohort was 67±10 years, and it was 58% female; 63% 
clustered predominantly with European genetic reference populations. Among the 
participants, 3,107 (1.2%) had prevalent ADRD, 301 (0.1%) had incident ADRD, and 
19,910 (7.7%) reported a family history of ADRD (proxy ADRD). Both prevalent and 
proxy ADRD had attenuated associations with APOE genotype compared to incident 
ADRD. The adjusted generalized ratio (95% CI) (AGR) for incident ADRD for APOE 
ε4 heterozygotes was 2.95 (2.31-3.74) compared to 2.10 (1.96-2.24) and 1.42 
(1.32-1.55) for proxy and prevalent ADRD, respectively. For APOE ε4 homozygotes, 
the effect sizes were even more different. Furthermore, APOE association effect 
sizes increased when restricting the control (no ADRD) group to older age 
brackets.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights how genetic associations with ADRD can be 
sensitive to how cases are defined in biobanks like All of Us, with effect sizes 
downwardly biased when using prevalent or by-proxy cases compared to incident 
cases.

Apathy is a prevalent and persistent neuropsychiatric syndrome across many 
neurological disorders, significantly impacting both patients and caregivers. We 
systematically quantified discrepancies between self- and caregiver-reported 
apathy in 335 patients with a variety of diagnoses, such as frontotemporal 
dementia (behavioural variant and semantic dementia subtypes), Parkinson's 
disease, Parkinson's disease dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, Alzheimer's 
disease dementia, mild cognitive impairment, small vessel cerebrovascular 
disease, subjective cognitive decline and autoimmune encephalitis. Using the 
Apathy Motivation Index (AMI) and its analogous caregiver version (AMI-CG), we 
found that caregiver-reported apathy consistently exceeded self-reported levels 
across all conditions. Moreover, self-reported apathy accounted for only 14.1% 
of the variance in caregiver ratings. This apathy reporting discrepancy was most 
pronounced in conditions associated with impaired insight, such as behavioural 
variant frontotemporal dementia, and was significantly correlated with cognitive 
impairment. Deficits in memory and fluency explained an additional 11.2% of the 
variance in caregiver-reported apathy. Specifically, executive function deficits 
(e.g. indexed by fluency) and memory impairments may contribute to behavioural 
inertia or recall of it. These findings highlight the need to integrate patient 
and caregiver perspectives in apathy assessments, especially for conditions with 
prominent cognitive impairment. To improve diagnostic accuracy and deepen our 
understanding of apathy across neurological disorders, we highlight the need for 
adapted apathy assessment strategies that account for cognitive impairment 
particularly in individuals with insight or memory deficits. Understanding the 
cognitive mechanisms underpinning discordant apathy reporting in dementia might 
help inform targeted clinical interventions and reduce caregiver burden.

The coexistence of lophomoniasis and tuberculosis (TB), both airborne diseases, 
is relatively uncommon. Co-infections like these can complicate treatment 
strategies due to overlapping symptoms and potential drug interactions. We 
report a rare case of comorbidity involving two pulmonary diseases, 
lophomoniasis and TB, in an 82-year-old woman with Alzheimer's disease (AD) from 
northern Iran. Her primary symptoms included weakness, lethargy, dyspnea, sputum 
production, night sweats, and significant weight loss. Both TB and lophomoniasis 
can compromise the immune system, potentially worsening the progression or 
severity of AD by increasing susceptibility to infections or enhancing 
neuroinflammation. Following the prescription of appropriate drug regimens for 
both diseases, the patient was discharged from the hospital in stable condition. 
Overall, it is crucial to consider lophomoniasis in the differential diagnosis 
of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, especially in endemic areas where both 
infections are prevalent, to ensure timely diagnosis and effective management.

Chronic neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration are critical but unresolved 
drivers of disability accumulation in progressive multiple sclerosis (MS). 
Chronic active white matter lesions (CAL), identifiable radiologically as 
paramagnetic rim lesions (PRL), indicate progression-relevant chronic 
neuroinflammation. Using single-cell transcriptomics (scRNAseq) and T-cell 
receptor sequencing (scTCR-seq), we profiled cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood 
immune cells of 34 radiologically characterized adults with MS (17 untreated, 6 
treated with B-cell-depletion) and 5 healthy controls. Coupled with proteomics, 
we found PRL-associated enrichment of interferon (IFN) signaling and 
upregulation of TCR signaling in CSF and blood. This was accompanied by clonal 
expansion of CD8+ T effector memory (TEM) cells, with the highly expanded clonal 
cells exhibiting T helper type 1 (TH1) and cytotoxic profiles. Validating the 
cytotoxic immune profile in blood using flow cytometry, we identified a cellular 
correlate of PRL exhibiting features of CD8+ TEMRA cells. Despite B-cell 
depletion, PRL-associated neuroinflammation, driven by myeloid activation and 
CD8+ T-cell cytotoxicity, persisted. Serum and CSF proteomic networks showed 
PRL-pertinent signatures, including networks unaffected by B-cell depletion. 
Using in silico perturbation, we nominated therapeutic targets, including MYD88, 
TNF, MYC, TYK2, JAK2, and BTK, for alleviating chronic neuroinflammation in MS. 
Our findings highlight mechanisms of chronic neuroinflammation in MS and point 
to potential biomarkers for monitoring disease progression.

BACKGROUND: The global aging population is increasingly inflicted with 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), but a cure is still unavailable. Neurotrophic 
Factor-α1/carboxypeptidase E (NF-α1/CPE) gene therapy has been shown to prevent 
and reverse memory loss and pathology AD mouse models However, the mechanisms of 
action of NF-α1/CPE are not fully understood. We investigated if a non-enzymatic 
form of NF-α1/CPE-E342Q is efficient in reversing AD pathology and carried out a 
proteomic study to uncover the mechanisms of action of NF-α1/CPE in AD mice.
METHODS: AAV-human NF-α1/CPE and a non-enzymatic form, NF-α1/CPE -E342Q were 
delivered into hippocampus of 3xTg-AD mice and effects on cognitive function, 
neurodegeneration, synaptogenesis and autophagy were investigated. A 
quantitative proteomic analysis of hippocampus of 3xTg-AD mice with and without 
AAV-NF-α1/CPE treatment was carried out.
RESULTS: Hippocampal delivery of AAV-NF-α1/CPE-E342Q prevented memory loss, 
neurodegeneration and increase in activated microglia in 3xTg-AD mice, 
indicating its action is independent of its enzymatic activity. Quantitative 
proteomic analysis of hippocampus of 3xTg-AD mice that underwent NF-α1/CPE gene 
therapy revealed differential expression of >2000 proteins involving many 
metabolic pathways. Of these, two new proteins down-regulated by NF-α1/CPE: 
Nexin4 (SNX4) and Trim28 which increase Aβ production and tau levels, 
respectively were identified. Western blot analysis verified that they were 
reduced in AAV-NF-α1/CPE treated 3xTg-AD mice compared to untreated mice. Our 
proteomic analysis indicated synaptic organization as top signaling pathway 
altered as a response to CPE expression. Synaptic markers PSD95 and Synapsin1 
were decreased in 3xTg-AD mice and were restored with AAV-NF-α1/CPE treatment. 
Proteomic analysis hypothesized involvement of autophagic signaling pathway. 
Indeed, multiple proteins known to be markers of autophagy were down-regulated 
in 3xTg-AD mice, accounting for impaired autophagy. Expression of these proteins 
were upregulated in 3xTg-AD mice with NF-α1/CPE gene therapy, thereby reversing 
autophagic impairment.
CONCLUSIONS: This study uncovered vast actions of NF-α1/CPE in restoring 
expression of networks of critical proteins including those necessary for 
maintaining neuronal survival, synaptogenesis and autophagy, while 
down-regulating many proteins that promote tau and Aβ accumulation to reverse 
memory loss and AD pathology in 3xTg-AD mice. AAV-NF-α1/CPE gene therapy 
uniquely targets many metabolic levels, offering a promising holistic approach 
for AD treatment.

INTRODUCTION: The accumulation of core Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology 
contributes to cognitive decline. Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) influences AD 
pathological progression resulting in improvement or maintenance of cognitive 
function with age. CRF-related differences in accumulation rates or risk of 
reaching clinically relevant AD biomarker levels, and potentially interactive 
effects of core AD pathology and CRF on cognitive decline, remain largely 
unknown.
METHODS: Participants (N = 533; MeanAGE = 65, 70% female) from the Wisconsin 
Alzheimer's Disease Research Center and the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's 
Prevention underwent serial blood draws, and cognitive and imaging assessments 
(MeanFollow-up = 6.0 years). Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of 
amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau (T) and plasma phosphorylated tau-217 (p-tau217) were 
used to determine biomarker status (±). Sex-specific estimated CRF (eCRF) 
tertiles were created using a validated equation. Kaplan-Meier survival curves 
and Cox proportional hazards examined the risk of becoming biomarker-positive. 
Linear mixed-effects models, stratified by biomarker status, estimated 
associations between baseline eCRF and core AD biomarker accumulation, and 
whether eCRF modified relationships between biomarker accumulation and cognitive 
decline.
RESULTS: There were no significant relationships between eCRF and biomarker 
trajectories. However, those in high eCRF group who were Aβ- at baseline had a 
significantly lower risk of becoming biomarker-positive (Aβ-PET: HR, 95% 
confidence interval [CI] = 0.42, 0.20-0.88; p-tau-217: 0.45, 0.21-0.97) compared 
to the low eCRF group. The detrimental relationship between Aβ accumulation and 
cognitive decline was significantly attenuated for Aβ+/T+ with high eCRF.
DISCUSSION: Although eCRF did not influence core AD biomarker accumulation 
trajectories, high eCRF seems protective against becoming biomarker-positive and 
attenuates the known deleterious relationship between biomarker accumulation and 
cognitive decline in Aβ+/T+.
HIGHLIGHTS: High estimated cardiorespiratory fitness (eCRF) is associated with a 
lesser likelihood of becoming AD biomarker positive.High eCRF did not alter 
biomarker accumulation in those positive for Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
pathology.High eCRF attenuated the relationship between AD biomarkers and 
cognitive decline.Innovative methods: Stratifying analyses by amyloid beta and 
tau status.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative 
disorders and is characterized by memory loss and cognitive decline. The amyloid 
cascade hypothesis posits that the pathogenesis of AD is initiated by the 
oligomerization and accumulation of toxic amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides within the 
brain. The aspartic protease γ-secretase, which catalyzes the final step in the 
cellular production of Aβ peptides, has been identified as a potential target 
for anti-amyloid intervention strategies. This target has attracted increasing 
attention in recent years, and novel small molecules have been developed as 
selective γ-secretase inhibitors and γ-secretase modulators. This review aims to 
discuss the role of γ-secretase protein hydrolysis activity in the pathogenesis 
of AD and to review the molecular mechanisms and prospects for the future 
development of strategies that target γ-secretase to intervene in AD 
development, which is expected to provide new ideas for the treatment of AD.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative 
disorder characterized by amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptide accumulation, oxidative 
stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and cholinergic deficits, all of which 
contribute to neuronal damage and cognitive decline.
METHODS: This study investigated the neuroprotective potential of quercetin, a 
natural flavonoid, in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells exposed to Aβ-induced 
toxicity. Various assays were conducted to evaluate cell viability, reactive 
oxygen species (ROS) levels, mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), 
acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and Aβ aggregation.
RESULTS: Quercetin significantly enhanced cell viability and reduced oxidative 
stress by lowering intracellular ROS levels. It preserved mitochondrial 
integrity by stabilizing ΔΨm and inhibited AChE activity, thereby supporting 
cholinergic function. Additionally, quercetin reduced Aβ aggregation and the 
formation of toxic amyloid fibrils.
DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that quercetin confers neuroprotection by 
targeting multiple pathological mechanisms involved in AD, including oxidative 
stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, AChE activity and Aβ aggregation. Quercetin 
demonstrates promise as a natural therapeutic agent for the treatment of AD. 
However, further in-vivo investigations and clinical studies are warranted to 
validate these findings and explore its translational potential.

BackgroundThe cognitive reserve (CR) hypothesis presumes higher tolerance of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related pathology without functional decline for those 
with high education and more rapid decline after AD onset. Evidence supporting 
the second part of the hypothesis has been largely confined to U.S.-based 
studies.ObjectiveTo assess the relationship between education and cognitive 
decline in a multi-national European cohort of older adults living with 
AD.MethodsWe analyzed data from participants recruited into the GERAS-EU cohort 
study from AD clinics in the United Kingdom, Germany, and France. Linear mixed 
models were employed to assess the relationship between education (dichotomized 
using a 12-year cutoff) and cognitive decline measured by Mini-Mental State 
Examination (MMSE) scores during 1.5 to 3 years of follow-up, adjusting for age, 
sex, time from formal diagnosis, country, comorbidities, and AD 
treatment.ResultsA total of 1313 participants were analyzed, with mean age of 
77.3 years (SD = 7.6), 715 (54.5%) females, and 378 (28.8%) with high education 
(≥12 years). Participants with high education experienced a 0.19-point greater 
decline (versus low education group) in MMSE scores every 6 months during 
follow-up (95% Confidence Interval: 0.03-0.35, p = 0.02). The secondary analyses 
(stratified by disease severity, sex, or country) showed a consistent direction 
of the association, although only significant in the severe AD group 
(p = 0.01).ConclusionsOur findings provide partial support for the CR 
hypothesis. Delayed AD diagnosis in individuals with high education may 
contribute to faster decline after diagnosis, highlighting the importance of 
sensitive screening for early signs of cognitive impairment.

BackgroundCognitive processing speed is integral to everyday activities and can 
be improved with training in persons with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). 
However, whether this training maintains everyday abilities is not 
known.ObjectiveWe aimed to determine whether everyday functions key to 
independence could be preserved with two years of processing speed 
training.MethodsIn a randomized controlled trial, we objectively evaluated a 
processing speed training protocol compared to a control training protocol, in 
103 persons with MCI (n = 90) or very mild dementia (n = 13) due to Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). Each protocol involved serial assessments, laboratory training, 
and home training over a two-year period. We accounted for APOE ε4 carrier 
status and MRI-based neurodegeneration conducted at baseline. Outcomes were 
longitudinal changes in performance-based Instrumental Activities of Daily 
Living (IADLs), community mobility, and on-road driving. We used linear mixed 
models to evaluate changes in these outcomes over time.ResultsChanges in IADL 
function, driving, and community mobility did not differ by training assignment. 
Greater baseline neurodegeneration predicted larger declines in all functional 
outcomes (p values < 0.001).ConclusionsIn persons with MCI or very mild 
dementia, processing speed training was no more effective for maintaining 
everyday functions than training involving common computer activities and games 
that do not target processing speed. Greater baseline neurodegeneration 
predicted worse performance over time on all measures of function.

BackgroundFew studies have examined whether chronic stress and social support 
are potential modifiable risk factors for Alzheimer's disease and related 
dementias.ObjectiveTo examine the associations of chronic stress and social 
support with domain-specific cognitive z-scores (attention, memory, executive 
functioning, and language) and assess whether gender or race/ethnicity modify 
these associations.MethodsParticipants included 3005 older adults (age range: 
50-92) enrolled in the Health and Aging Brain Study-Health Disparities. Social 
support was measured using the Interpersonal Support and Evaluations List, and 
chronic stress measured with the Chronic Burden Scale. Linear regression models 
evaluated associations of chronic stress and/or social support with 
domain-specific cognitive z-scores, adjusting for age, education, gender, 
race/ethnicity, and symptoms of anxiety. Interactions between chronic stress or 
social support and gender or race/ethnicity in relation to cognition were 
assessed. Additional analyses examined the interrelationship between chronic 
stress and social support in relation to cognition.ResultsHigher chronic stress 
was associated with lower cognitive z-scores; results differed by 
race/ethnicity. Higher social support was associated with higher cognitive 
z-scores; results differed by gender and race/ethnicity. In models incorporating 
both chronic stress and social support, associations between social support and 
cognition remained, however associations between chronic stress and cognition 
were attenuated. A combination of high chronic stress/low social support, 
compared to low chronic stress/high social support, was associated with lower 
cognitive z-scores.ConclusionsHigh chronic stress and low social support is 
associated with worse cognition. Future studies are needed to understand the 
underlying mechanisms, with consideration of gender and race/ethnicity.

Berkshire, UK.

OBJECTIVES: Remotely delivered attentional bias modification (ABM) studies 
involving persons with cognitive impairment are lacking. Thus, the feasibility 
of an adapted ABM paradigm with webcam-based eye tracking was explored.
METHODS: Four of the eight participants recruited (males, Mage = 69 years, 
Alzheimer's disease = 3, mild cognitive impairment = 1) completed up to four 
daily ABM sessions. Tasks comprised pre- and post-intervention depression 
(PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), and rumination (RRS) measures, a cognitive screen 
(TICS) (A), affect (PANAS) (B) and dot-probe AB measures (C), and dot-probe ABM 
(D) (Session 1-A, B, C, D, C, and B; Sessions 2 to 4-B, D, C, and B).
RESULTS: The intervention was feasible (as defined by completion rates) and 
appeared beneficial in this small sample (as defined by post-intervention 
improvements in mood). Sessions were long, and task completion/adherence was 
impacted by task access/participants' ability to complete tasks independently. 
Mind wandering, stimuli familiarity, and eye/fatigue were reported.
CONCLUSIONS: The intervention requires further adaptation (e.g. fewer 
eye-tracking tasks per session). Limitations include participant 
self-selection/loss, a lack of control group, and that the determinants of mood 
change are unclear.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: ABM, a novel intervention, may be an effective 
mood-disorder treatment for individuals with cognitive impairment.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative illness affecting nearly 
7 million people in the United States. Until 2023, no disease-targeting 
pharmacotherapeutics were widely available outside of research studies. With 
relatively recent regulatory approval and increasing availability of antiamyloid 
therapies (AATs) in the United States, management of AD is rapidly shifting from 
symptomatic and supportive care alone to treatments aimed at disease 
modification. Appropriate selection of patients for AATs can be challenging and 
varies among health care settings and systems despite published appropriate-use 
recommendations. The first of this two-part Treatment in Behavioral Neurology & 
Neuropsychiatry series from the American Neuropsychiatric Association Dementia 
Special Interest Group addresses the challenges with patient selection. In this 
second part, the authors offer dementia-focused health care vignettes to 
illustrate challenges with AAT delivery encountered in different settings and 
discuss emerging logistical issues associated with delivery of dementia-focused 
care based on AAT protocols.

INTRODUCTION: Traditional Healing Practitioners (THPs) provide care to the 
majority of the population in South Africa. Despite their widespread presence, 
they remain largely excluded from dementia research and policy. This reinforces 
healthcare inequities and overlooks the realities of communities where THPs 
provide care.
METHODS: This paper explores the role of THPs in dementia care by examining 
literature in South Africa. It identifies key barriers to collaboration between 
THPs and medical doctors and discusses pathways for integration.
RESULTS: Barriers include epistemological historical marginalization, mutual 
distrust, fragmented care pathways, and language barriers. These challenges 
hinder knowledge exchange and joint dementia care strategies.
DISCUSSION: Strengthening relationships through structured engagement, 
bidirectional knowledge exchange, and ethical collaboration could bridge the gap 
between THPs and Medical Doctors (MDs). A pluralistic, integrated model valuing 
both systems could lead to more equitable and effective dementia care.
HIGHLIGHTS: The majority of people in South Africa engage with Traditional 
Healing Practitioners (THPs) as part of their healthcare, yet THPs remain 
largely excluded from dementia research and policy. Barriers to collaboration 
between THPs and Medical Doctors (MDs) include historical marginalization, 
mutual distrust, fragmented care pathways, and language differences. Integrating 
THPs and MDs through structured engagement, bidirectional knowledge exchange, 
and ethical collaboration could enhance dementia care. Shifting away from the 
binary opposition of Indigenous Knowledge Systems (IKS) and biomedical 
approaches toward a more integrated and collaborative model of dementia care 
could lead to more equitable and effective healthcare. The FUNDISA (Framework 
for Understanding Neurocognitive Disorders via Indigenous Systems in South 
Africa) project aims to understand how dementia is conceptualized by THPs and 
foster collaboration between THPs and MDs to support effective dementia care.

Kenpaullone is known for its neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties. 
We explored the potential of a specific intervention to influence cognitive 
abilities and disease-related brain changes in a mice model replicating key 
aspects of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We employed 5XFAD transgenic mice, which 
develop Aβ plaques and cognitive impairments that mirror those observed in 
individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The animals were treated with 
Kenpaullone (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 5 mg/kg) or a vehicle (DMSO). The study 
evaluated memory using the Morris water maze (MWM) and the novel object 
recognition (NOR) task. This study employed immunohistochemistry, ELISA, and 
Western blot to analyze Aβ plaques and proinflammatory factors, investigating 
neurodegeneration. In contrast, the expression of genes related to 
neurodegeneration and apoptosis was evaluated using polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR). Administration of Kenpaullone yielded significant improvements in 
cognitive performance in the 5XFAD mice. Mice that received the 5 mg/kg 
treatment demonstrated the highest improvement in spatial learning and 
recognition memory. Furthermore, Kenpaullone decreased the burden of 
amyloid-beta plaques in key brain regions associated with memory (hippocampus 
and cortex), along with decreased levels of proinflammatory cytokines. 
Furthermore, Kenpaullone treatment resulted in a downregulation of genes related 
to neurodegeneration and apoptosis, suggesting a potential therapeutic benefit 
in mitigating neural apoptosis in AD. Our results suggest that Kenpaullone holds 
promise for improving cognitive function and mitigating neuropathological 
changes in AD, warranting further exploration as a potential medicinal 
substance.

INTRODUCTION: Deep brain stimulation of the fornix (fx-DBS) is being 
investigated for treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The therapy aims at 
alleviating memory and cognitive circuit dysfunction. In preclinical models of 
AD, electrical stimulation of the memory circuit has demonstrated a possible 
disease-modifying potential. Here we examined changes resulting from fx-DBS in 
hippocampal atrophy and amyloid accumulation in AD patients with fx-DBS.
METHODS: Repeated magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography 
(PET) images acquired over the course of 12 months were used to assess changes 
in hippocampal volume in 36 ADvance trial patients compared to 40 matched 
untreated AD patients from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, and 
in 10 separate patients with repeated flutemetamol PET and cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) markers.
RESULTS: We observed a reduction of hippocampal atrophy and amyloid beta (Aβ) 
PET binding, and an increase in the CSF Aβ/total-tau ratio in DBS patients.
DISCUSSION: These findings highlight the potential of fornix deep brain 
stimulation to modify AD biomarkers and possibly progression in some patients.
HIGHLIGHTS: Fornix deep brain stimulation (fx-DBS) is being investigated to 
treat Alzheimer's disease (AD). Results show that fx-DBS modifies imaging and 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers. It reduces hippocampal atrophy and increases 
the amyloid beta/total-tau CSF ratio. These findings highlight the potential of 
fx-DBS to modify AD.

INTRODUCTION: Due to its metabolic effects, dapagliflozin, a sodium-glucose 
transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, holds potential as an Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
therapeutic.
METHODS: We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 
parallel-group, 12-week single-site study to investigate the effect of 
dapagliflozin in participants with probable AD (Mini-Mental State Examination 
[MMSE] score 15-26). We planned to enroll 48 participants with 2:1 randomization 
to 10 mg dapagliflozin once daily (n = 32) versus matching placebo (n = 16). The 
primary objective was the effect of dapagliflozin on cerebral N-acetylaspartate 
(NAA). We also assessed safety, glycemic control, body composition, brain 
metabolism, and cognition.
RESULTS: There was no change in the primary outcome. There were no significant 
adverse event differences. Hemoglobin A1c, fat mass, and fat-free lean mass 
decreased; brain glutathione increased; and Stroop Interference test (but not 
other cognitive test) performance improved.
DISCUSSION: Treated participants manifested metabolic effects observed in 
clinical studies of other cohorts. In AD, dapagliflozin use may affect the 
brain.
HIGHLIGHTS: Dapagliflozin did not alter magnetic resonance spectroscopy 
N-acetylaspartate (primary outcome) in this exploratory Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
trial. Dapagliflozin-induced glucose disposal is sufficient to alter systemic 
metabolism. AD patients taking dapagliflozin exhibited metabolic effects seen in 
diabetics.

INTRODUCTION: Sleep disturbances are prevalent in Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
probably emerging during its preclinical stage. Poor subjective sleep quality is 
linked to reduced brain volume and cortical thickness (CTh), but associations 
with objective sleep measures, particularly regarding sex and AD pathology, 
remain unclear.
METHODS: We characterized 171 cognitively unimpaired adults from the ALzheimer 
and FAmilies (ALFA) Sleep study using actigraphy, MRI, amyloid beta 42/40, and 
phosphorylated tau at threonine 181 in cerebrospinal fluid.
RESULTS: Lower sleep efficiency, higher wake after sleep onset (WASO), and sleep 
fragmentation were associated with lower CTh in the medial temporal lobe and 
other regions linked with AD and sleep disruption, even after adjusting for AD 
biomarkers. Sex and AD biomarkers modified these associations, with longer WASO 
showing a stronger correlation with lower CTh in females.
DISCUSSION: Disrupted sleep may reduce cortical integrity independently of AD 
biomarkers, suggesting alternative pathways. Females appear more vulnerable to 
impaired sleep, and AD pathology may exacerbate AD-related changes in CTh.
HIGHLIGHTS: Poor sleep efficiency, increased WASO, and sleep fragmentation are 
associated with reduced CTh in regions vulnerable to early AD, independently of 
amyloid and tau pathology. In the presence of AD pathology, this relationship is 
altered, with A+T+ individuals exhibiting increased CTh associated with sleep 
disruption. Sex-specific effects suggest females are more vulnerable to 
sleep-related cortical thinning. These findings highlight the potential of 
targeting sleep as a secondary prevention strategy to preserve brain integrity 
and mitigate neurodegenerative processes in AD-vulnerable regions.

Background: One of the major contributors to homeostasis at the level of the 
central nervous system, specifically the brain, is the glymphatic system, which 
is described as an exchange occurring at the level of and between the 
interstitial fluid and cerebrospinal fluid that has been linked to 
neurodegenerative processes. Methods: Fourteen studies were included after 
PROSPERO registration and a literature search. Screening, reviewing, and data 
extraction were performed by two reviewers. Quality assessment scales were used. 
General continuous and subgroup analysis, heterogeneity tests, and random effect 
models were run using SPSS. Forest plots were constructed based on subgroup 
analysis. Results: Significant correlations (p < 0.05) were detected between MRI 
indices and outcomes quantifying neurodegenerative diseases. Studies on 
Alzheimer's disease showed a positive correlation between diffusivity indices 
and cognitive scores. Studies on Parkinson's disease showed negative 
correlations between diffusivity indices and disease severity, progression, and 
motor function (p < 0.05). As for other conditions, the conclusions remain 
uncertain, yet positive results were detected (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Positive 
significant correlations were deduced between the ALPS index and cognitive 
scores, indicating that low cognition is correlated with a low ALPS index and 
enlarged PVSs. Negative significant correlations were deduced between ALPS 
indices and UPDRS scores, indicating motor dysfunction is correlated with lower 
ALPS indices and enlarged PVSs. Finally, MRI parameters may help to deduce 
disease progression across subgroups. Despite the presence of heterogeneity 
between studies, significant correlations with moderate to large effect sizes 
were detected. Glymphatic dysfunction measured through MRI indices is correlated 
with neurodegenerative changes across various neurological conditions.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic progressive neurodegenerative disease that 
leads to disabilities such as difficulty moving and slowed cognitive processing. 
It is the leading non-traumatic cause of disability worldwide. MS also has a 
high potential to become a model for neurodegenerative diseases with a 
progression like Alzheimer's or Parkinson's. Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) 
remain the leading cause of global deaths and have a considerable economic 
impact. The higher incidence of cardiovascular comorbidities in patients with MS 
compared to healthy individuals of the same age worsens the prognosis of 
neurological pathology, leading to a higher level of disability, poorer physical 
outcomes, higher depression scores, cognitive aging, and diminished quality of 
life. Classical observational studies often have questionable elements that can 
represent a source of error, making it difficult to establish a causal 
relationship between MS and CVD. Genetic studies, including genome-wide 
evaluation, may resolve this issue and may represent a topic for future 
research. We report the case of a 31-year-old male patient with a history of 
multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosed seven years prior, who presented with acute 
chest pain upon returning from vacation. Despite the previous recommendation for 
disease-modifying therapy, the patient had discontinued treatment by personal 
choice. Electrocardiography (ECG) revealed ST-segment elevation in inferior 
leads, and emergent coronary angiography identified severe multi-vessel coronary 
artery disease (CAD), requiring immediate revascularization. This case 
highlights the potential cardiovascular risks in young patients with MS and the 
importance of continuous medical supervision.

Background: Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) represents a progressive 
cerebrovascular disorder, characterized by aberrant accumulation of beta-amyloid 
isoforms in cortical and leptomeningeal vessel walls of cerebrum and cerebellum. 
Methods: We sought to investigate the clinical manifestations, current different 
diagnostic tools, various therapeutic strategies and most uncommon subtypes of 
the disease. Results: The vast majority of CAA remains sporadic, with increasing 
prevalence with age and very frequent coexistence with Alzheimer's disease. 
Clinically, CAA can present with spontaneous lobar intracerebral hemorrhage, 
transient focal neurologic episodes attributed to convexity subarachnoid 
hemorrhage or cortical superficial siderosis, and progressive cognitive decline 
leading to dementia. Inflammatory CAA subtype should be recognized early and 
treated promptly so that better functional outcomes may be achieved. Moreover, 
genetic and iatrogenic CAA forms are rare, yet increasingly recognized during 
the last years. Therapeutic management remains challenging for clinicians, 
especially when markers indicative of higher bleeding risk are present. A 
targeted therapy does not currently exist. However, various clinical trials are 
in progress, focusing on offering new promising insights into the disease 
treatment. Conclusions: This review aims to deepen our understanding of CAA 
diagnosis and therapeutic approach but also summarizes current evidence on the 
most uncommon subtypes of this cerebral small-vessel disease.

Brain endothelial cells (BECs) constitute the core component of the blood-brain 
barrier (BBB), regulating substance exchange between blood and the brain 
parenchyma to maintain central nervous system homeostasis. In pathological 
states, the BBB exhibits the disruption of tight junctions, endothelial cell 
(EC) damage, and increased permeability, accompanied by neuroinflammation, 
oxidative stress, and abnormal molecular signaling pathways, leading to 
neurotoxic effects in the brain parenchyma and exacerbating neurodegeneration 
and disease progression. This review systematically summarizes the developmental 
origin, structural characteristics, and pathological mechanisms of BECs in 
diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, stroke, and 
glioblastoma with a particular focus on the regulatory mechanisms of the 
Wnt/β-catenin and VEGF signaling pathways. By integrating the latest research 
advances, this review aims to provide a comprehensive perspective for 
understanding the role of BECs in physiological and pathological states and to 
provide a theoretical basis for the development of BBB-based therapeutic 
approaches for neurological diseases.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative condition that is 
characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-β, the hyperphosphorylation of tau, 
and persistent neuroinflammation. However, these hallmarks alone do not fully 
capture the intricacies of AD pathology, thus necessitating the investigation of 
emerging mechanisms and innovative tools. Exosomes (nanoscale vesicles involved 
in cell communication and immune modulation) have emerged as pivotal cellular 
vehicles due to their dual role-both in the propagation of pathological proteins 
and the regulation of inflammatory responses. Furthermore, these vesicles have 
been demonstrated to play a crucial role in the mediation of the effects of 
microbiota-derived metabolites and the reflection of systemic influences such as 
dysbiosis, thereby establishing a link between the gut-brain axis and the 
progression of AD. A comprehensive narrative literature review was conducted 
using the following databases: ScienceDirect, Scopus, Wiley, Web of Science, 
Medline, and PubMed, covering studies published between 2015 and 2025. Inclusion 
and exclusion criteria were established to select research addressing exosomal 
biogenesis, their functional and diagnosis role, their therapeutic potential, 
and the emerging evidence on microbiota-exosome interplay in Alzheimer's 
disease. Exosomes have been identified as integral mediators of intercellular 
communication, reflecting the molecular state of the central nervous system. 
These particles have been shown to promote the propagation of pathological 
proteins, modulate neuroinflammatory responses, and serve as non-invasive 
biomarkers due to their detectability in peripheral fluids. Advances in exosomal 
engineering and microbiome-based interventions underscore the potential for 
targeting systemic and CNS-specific mechanisms to develop integrative therapies 
for AD. Exosomes present a promising approach for the early diagnosis and 
personalized treatment of Alzheimer's disease. However, methodological 
challenges and ongoing controversies, including those related to the influence 
of systemic factors such as dysbiosis, necessitate multidisciplinary research to 
optimize and standardize these strategies.

Aluminum (Al) is one of the most abundant metals on Earth and is well known as 
an environmental neurotoxic agent in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. 
Aluminum toxicity is associated with oxidative stress, reduction of antioxidant 
enzymes, and disruption of the balance of cellular metals, such as iron (Fe), 
calcium (Ca), and copper (Cu), which causes structural and functional changes in 
the nervous tissue of the brain or peripheral nervous system. The intake of 
functional foods, rich in antioxidants, such as quercetin, may be beneficial in 
combating oxidative stress and neurodegenerative changes in the brain. The aim 
of this study was to provide deeper insight into the cellular and molecular 
neuroprotective effects of quercetin in regulating amyloid-beta (Aβ) 
accumulation, tau pathology, and neuroinflammation in the Al/D-galactose-induced 
rat model (Al/D-gal) of AD. The results showed that quercetin successfully 
modulated the impaired homeostatic and neuropathological consequences of 
aluminum chloride and D-galactose administration over 28 days: it directly 
protected neurons by regulating the level of oxidative stress and antioxidants, 
reduced Aβ aggregation by inhibiting the activity of acetylcholinesterase 
(AChE), increased the survival, growth, and differentiation of nerve cells by 
maintaining the level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and regulated 
microglial immunoreactivity and neuroinflammation by reducing the level of 
proinflammatory cytokines. The multiple effects confirm that quercetin can be 
applied as an alternative non-pharmaceutical approach in reducing Al-induced 
neurotoxicity and maintaining adaptive homeostasis, which consequently affects 
the functioning of the central nervous system and the whole organism.

Stroke, the third leading cause of death worldwide, is a major cause of 
functional disability. Cerebral ischemia causes a rapid elevation of adenosine, 
the main neuromodulator in the brain. The inhibition of adenosine A2A receptors 
(A2ARs) has been introduced as a potential target in neurodegenerative disorders 
involving extracellular adenosine elevation. Istradefylline, a selective A2AR 
antagonist, has been approved for Parkinson's disease (PD) adjunctive therapy 
and showed neuroprotective effects in PD and Alzheimer's disease. However, the 
role of A2ARs in post-stroke neuronal damage and behavioral deficits remains 
unclear. We recently showed that A2AR antagonism prevented the adenosine-induced 
post-hypoxia synaptic potentiation of glutamatergic neurotransmission following 
the hypoxia/reperfusion of hippocampal slices. Here, we investigated the 
potential neuroprotective effects of istradefylline in male Sprague-Dawley rats 
subjected to pial vessel disruption (PVD) used to model a small-vessel stroke. 
Rats were treated with either a vehicle control or istradefylline (3 mg/kg i.p.) 
following PVD surgery for three days. Istradefylline administration prevented 
anxiety and depressive-like behaviors caused by PVD stroke. In addition, 
istradefylline significantly attenuated ischemia-induced cognitive impairment 
and motor deficits. Moreover, istradefylline markedly reduced hippocampal 
neurodegeneration, as well as GFAP/Iba-1, TNF-α, nNOS, and iNOS levels after 
PVD, but prevented the downregulation of anti-inflammatory markers TGF-β1 and 
IL-4. Together, these results suggest a molecular link between stroke and PD and 
that the anti-PD drug istradefylline displays translational potential for drug 
repurposing as a neuroprotective agent for cerebral ischemic damage.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of dementia and a growing public 
health concern worldwide. Despite decades of research, effective 
disease-modifying treatments remain elusive, partly due to limitations in 
current experimental models. The purpose of this review is to critically assess 
and compare existing murine and alternative models of AD to identify key 
strengths, limitations, and future directions for model development that can 
enhance translational relevance and therapeutic discovery. Traditional 
transgenic mouse models have advanced the understanding of amyloid-beta and tau 
pathologies, but often fail to capture the complexity of sporadic, late-onset 
AD. In response, alternative models-including zebrafish, Drosophila 
melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, non-human primates, and human brain 
organoids-are gaining traction due to their complementary insights and diverse 
experimental advantages. This review also discusses innovations in genetic 
engineering, neuroimaging, computational modelling, and drug repurposing that 
are reshaping the landscape of AD research. By integrating these diverse 
approaches, the review advocates for a multi-model, multidisciplinary strategy 
to improve the predictive power, accelerate clinical translation, and inform 
personalised therapeutic interventions. Ethical considerations and equitable 
access to diagnostics and emerging treatments are also emphasised. Ultimately, 
this work aims to support the development of more accurate, effective, and 
human-relevant models to combat AD.

Background/Objectives: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia 
and is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration, resulting in cognitive 
impairment and structural brain changes. Although no curative treatment exists, 
pharmacological therapies like cholinesterase inhibitors and NMDA receptor 
antagonists may deliver symptomatic relief and modestly delay disease 
progression. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is a commonly utilized 
modality for the diagnosis of brain neurological diseases and may indicate 
abnormalities. However, improving the recognition of discriminative 
characteristics is the primary difficulty in diagnosis utilizing sMRI. Methods: 
To tackle this problem, the Fuzzy Optimized Attention Network with 
Multi-Instance Deep Learning (FOA-MIDL) system is presented for the prodromal 
phase of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and the initial detection of AD. 
Results: An attention technique to estimate the weight of every case is 
presented: the fuzzy salp swarm algorithm (FSSA). The swarming actions of salps 
in oceans serve as the inspiration for the FSSA. When moving, the nutrient 
gradients influence the movement of leading salps during global search 
exploration, while the followers fully explore their local environment to adjust 
the classifiers' parameters. To balance the relative contributions of every 
patch and produce a global distinct weighted image for the entire brain 
framework, the attention multi-instance learning (MIL) pooling procedure is 
developed. Attention-aware global classifiers are presented to improve the 
understanding of the integral characteristics and form judgments for AD-related 
categorization. The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the 
Australian Imaging, Biomarker, and Lifestyle Flagship Study on Ageing (AIBL) 
provided the two datasets (ADNI and AIBL) utilized in this work. Conclusions: 
Compared to many cutting-edge techniques, the findings demonstrate that the 
FOA-MIDL system may determine discriminative pathological areas and offer 
improved classification efficacy in terms of sensitivity (SEN), specificity 
(SPE), and accuracy.

Background/Objectives: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive 
neurodegenerative disorder causing memory, cognitive, and behavioral decline. 
Early and accurate diagnosis is critical for timely treatment and management. 
This study proposes a novel hybrid deep learning framework, GLCM + VGG16 + FMO + 
CNN-LSTM, to improve AD diagnosis using MRI data. Methods: MRI images were 
preprocessed through normalization and noise reduction. Feature extraction 
combined texture features from the Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and 
spatial features extracted from a pretrained VGG-16 network. Fisher Mantis 
Optimization (FMO) was employed for optimal feature selection. The selected 
features were classified using a CNN-LSTM model, capturing both spatial and 
temporal patterns. The MLP-LSTM model was included only for benchmarking 
purposes. The framework was evaluated on The ADNI and MIRIAD datasets. Results: 
The proposed method achieved 98.63% accuracy, 98.69% sensitivity, 98.66% 
precision, and 98.67% F1-score, outperforming CNN + SVM and 3D-CNN + BiLSTM by 
2.4-3.5%. Comparative analysis confirmed FMO's superiority over other 
metaheuristics, such as PSO, ACO, GWO, and BFO. Sensitivity analysis 
demonstrated robustness to hyperparameter changes. Conclusions: The results 
confirm the efficacy and stability of the GLCM + VGG16 + FMO + CNN-LSTM model 
for accurate and early AD diagnosis, supporting its potential clinical 
application.

Disease.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) has become an increasingly pressing concern for the 
aging population. Current AD treatments mainly focus on cognitive and 
neuropsychiatric symptoms-with few FDA-approved treatments targeting disease 
progression itself. The amyloid cascade hypothesis describes the formation and 
accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) oligomers and plaques as a primary event in AD 
pathogenesis. This hypothesis has served as the foundation of disease-modifying 
treatment development over the last decade. Recently, glutaminyl cyclase (QC) 
has been identified as a potential drug target in the amyloid cascade. QC 
catalyzes the cyclization of Aβ to form pyroglutamated Aβ (pEAβ). pEAβ acts as 
the seed for the formation of Aβ plaques, thus preventing the formation of pEAβ 
via QC inhibition, and offers a promising therapeutic strategy against AD. Here, 
we offer an overview of the pathway QCI research has followed-from the initial 
testing of imidazole-based inhibitor scaffolds to QCI structural optimization 
via pharmacophore identification, Varoglutamstat entering clinical trials, and 
further avenues of bettering specificity and potency for future QCI development.

Nanotherapeutics have emerged as novel unparalleled drug delivery systems (DDSs) 
for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. By applying different 
technological approaches, nanoparticles can be engineered to possess different 
functionalities. In recent years, the developed, stimuli-responsive nanocarriers 
stand out as novel complex DDSs ensuring selective and specific drug delivery in 
response to different endogenous and exogenous stimuli. Due to the multifaceted 
pathophysiology of the nervous system, a major challenge in modern 
neuropharmacology is the development of effective therapies ensuring high 
efficacy and low toxicity. Functionalization of the nanocarriers to react to 
specific microenvironmental changes in the nervous system tissues or external 
stimulations significantly enhances the efficacy of drug delivery. This review 
discusses the microenvironmental characteristics of some common neurological 
diseases in-depth and provides a comprehensive overview on the progress of the 
development of exogenous and endogenous stimuli-sensitive nanocarriers for the 
treatment of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.

The human gut microbiome is intricately linked to systemic and organ-specific 
immune responses and is highly responsive to dietary modulation. As metagenomic 
techniques enable in-depth study of an ever-growing number of gut microbial 
species, it has become increasingly feasible to decipher the specific functions 
of the gut microbiome and how they may be modulated by diet. Diet exerts both 
supportive and selective pressures on the gut microbiome by regulating a 
multitude of factors, including energy density, macronutrient and micronutrient 
content, and circadian rhythm. The microbiome, in turn, contributes to local and 
systemic immune responses by providing colonization resistance against 
pathogens, shaping immune cell activity and differentiation, and facilitating 
the production of bioactive metabolites. Emerging research has strengthened the 
connections between the gut microbiome and cardiometabolic disorders (e.g., 
cardiovascular disease, obesity, type-2 diabetes), autoimmune conditions (e.g., 
type-1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, celiac disease), respiratory disease, 
chronic kidney and liver disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and neurological 
disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease, depressive disorders). Here, 
we outline ways in which dietary factors impact host response in diseases 
through alterations of gut microbiome functionality and composition. 
Consideration of diet-mediated microbial effects within the context of the 
diseases discussed highlights the potential of microbiome-targeted treatment 
strategies as alternative or adjunct therapies to improve patient outcomes.

Sleep is essential for physical and mental health, playing a critical role in 
memory consolidation, behavioral stability, and the regulation of immune and 
metabolic functions. The incidence of sleep disorders, particularly sleep 
deprivation (SD), increases with age and is prevalent in neurodegenerative and 
psychiatric disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nearly 40% of AD 
patients experience significant chronic sleep impairments. The clinical 
distinction between late-life sleep disorders and AD is often challenging due to 
overlapping symptoms, including cognitive decline and behavioral impairments. 
Although the exact causal relationship between SD and AD remains complex and 
multifaceted, strong evidence suggests a bidirectional link, with AD patients 
frequently exhibiting disrupted sleep architecture, reduced slow-wave activity, 
and shorter total sleep duration. On a pathophysiological level, SD contributes 
to neuroinflammation, amyloid-β plaque deposition, and tau tangles, which are 
key features of AD. Current treatments, such as sedatives and antidepressants, 
often have limitations, including inconsistent efficacy, dependency risks, and 
poor long-term outcomes/recurrence, highlighting the need for safer and more 
effective alternatives. This review examines the interplay between SD and AD and 
proposes omega (n)-3 fatty acids (FAs) as a potential therapeutic intervention. 
Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that n-3 supplementation may improve 
sleep onset/quality, reduce neuroinflammation, support synaptic function, and 
decrease amyloid-β aggregation, thereby alleviating early AD-related 
neurological changes. Given their safety profile and neuroprotective effects, 
n-3 FAs represent a promising strategy for managing the comorbidity of sleep 
disorders in AD.

Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by progressive neurodegeneration and connectivity deterioration. 
While resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides 
critical insights into brain network abnormalities, traditional mutual 
information-based methods exhibit inherent limitations in characterizing the 
dynamic synergistic mechanisms between cerebral regions. Method: This study 
pioneered the application of an Integrated Information Decomposition (ΦID) 
framework in AD brain network analysis, constructing single-sample network 
models based on ΦID-derived synergy metrics to systematically compare their 
differences with mutual information-based methods in pathological sensitivity, 
computational robustness, and network representation capability, while detecting 
brain regions with declining dynamic synergy during AD progression through 
intergroup t-tests. Result: The key finding are as follows: (1) synergy metrics 
exhibited lower intra-group coefficient of variation than mutual information 
metrics, indicating higher computational stability; (2) single-sample 
reconstruction significantly enhanced the statistical power in intergroup 
difference detection; (3) synergy metrics captured brain network features that 
are undetectable by traditional mutual information methods, with more pronounced 
differences between networks; (4) key node analysis demonstrated spatiotemporal 
degradation patterns progressing from initial dysfunction in 
orbitofrontal-striatal-temporoparietal pathways accompanied by multi-regional 
impairments during prodromal stages, through moderate-phase decline located in 
the right middle frontal and postcentral gyri, to advanced-stage degeneration of 
the right supramarginal gyrus and left inferior parietal lobule. ΦID-driven 
dynamic synergy network analysis provides novel information integration 
theory-based biomarkers for AD progression diagnosis and potentially lays the 
foundation for pathological understanding and subsequent targeted therapy 
development.

Background: Dementia is a global condition affecting over 55 million people. 
Since there is no treatment, non-pharmacological interventions aim to delay its 
progression in a safe and cost-effective way. The extant literature suggests 
that Positive Psychology Interventions (PPIs) can probably be effective for this 
purpose. The systematic review aims to assess the effectiveness of PPIs as 
non-pharmacological interventions for mild cognitive decline related to dementia 
by evaluating their effectiveness in cognitive functions and brain functioning 
in people with Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD), Mild Cognitive Impairment 
(MCI), and mild Alzheimer's disease dementia (AD). Methods: A comprehensive 
search conducted in the databases Scopus, PubMed, ScienceDirect and PsychINFO 
(December 2024-March 2025) published between 2015 and 2025 to identify records 
that met inclusion criteria: studies included patients with SCD, MCI and mild AD 
dementia, implemented PPIs, Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and pre-post 
intervention studies with measurable outcomes, assess at least one of the 
following: cognitive functions and brain functioning. Results: The systematic 
review included 12 studies (N = 669 participants) that can answer the research 
question. Only mindfulness interventions were identified. Findings suggest that 
different types of mindfulness interventions, such as the Mindfulness Awareness 
Program (MAP) and Mindfulness Training (MT), may be efficient for improving 
specific cognitive functions (e.g., working memory and attention) and 
influencing biological pathways related to cognitive decline. However, long-term 
efficacy has not been demonstrated, and results are mixed and unclear. 
Conclusions: Μindfulness interventions seem promising for enhancing cognition 
and brain functioning in older adults with cognitive decline, although the data 
is limited. However, limitations such as the heterogeneity of the studies and 
the diversity of the interventions make it necessary for more systematic and 
organized research to be conducted on the implementation of such interventions. 
At the same time, it is proposed to examine the effectiveness of other 
constructs of positive psychology, such as character strengths (CS).

Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), are a global 
problem affecting millions of people. Thanks to years of research and huge 
efforts, it has been possible to discover the pathophysiological changes 
accompanying Alzheimer's disease at the cellular level. It turns out that the 
formation of amyloid-beta plaques and hyperphosphorylation of tau protein in the 
brain play a key role in disease development. Purinergic signaling (PS) is 
implicated in the pathophysiology of several disorders in the central nervous 
system, and recent findings link some disturbances in PS with Alzheimer's 
disease. The primary objective of our review is to comprehensively explore and 
identify key purinergic signaling targets that hold therapeutic potential in the 
treatment of patients suffering from the disease. In particular, we focus on the 
dual role of purinergic compounds and extracellular vesicles (EVs), which have 
emerged as critical components in cellular communication and disease modulation. 
The extracellular vesicles that are naturally released by various cells fulfill 
the role of communication tools, also by harnessing the purinergic compounds. In 
this context, our review presents a thorough and integrative analysis of how 
extracellular vesicles can influence purinergic signaling and how this 
interaction might be leveraged to develop novel, targeted treatment strategies. 
Ultimately, this line of research may lead to innovative therapeutic approaches 
that are not only effective in slowing or halting disease progression but also 
demonstrate a high degree of biocompatibility and safety for the human organism.
