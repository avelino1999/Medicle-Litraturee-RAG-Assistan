INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative condition 
characterized by the gradual deterioration of cognitive functions. Early 
identification of functional brain changes is crucial for timely diagnosis and 
effective intervention. This study employs multiplex network analysis to examine 
alterations in brain connectivity topology associated with Alzheimer's Disease, 
to identify early biomarkers and uncover potential therapeutic targets.
METHODS: This study presents a secondary cross-sectional analysis based on a 
publicly available EEG dataset comprising spectral coherence measurements from 
25 patients with clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and 25 age- and 
gender-matched Healthy Controls (HC). Functional connectivity matrices were 
generated across seven distinct frequency bands, with each brain region modeled 
as a network node and inter-regional coherence values represented as weighted 
edges. These matrices were then used to construct multiplex brain networks, 
which were rigorously analyzed using graph-theoretical approaches. The analysis 
encompassed key metrics, including modularity, centrality measures (Betweenness 
and MultiRank), motif distribution, and network controllability, to characterize 
and compare the underlying patterns of functional brain organization in AD and 
healthy aging.
RESULTS: Networks associated with AD exhibited significantly reduced modularity, 
disrupted centrality patterns, and a higher occurrence of 2 and 3-node motifs, 
indicating local reorganization of connectivity. Additionally, the spatial 
distribution of driver nodes was markedly altered in AD. Centrality analyses 
revealed a pronounced shift in network hubs toward the temporal and insular 
cortices, suggesting compensatory or pathological reallocation of influence. 
Controllability assessments demonstrated a lower energy requirement for network 
control in AD, accompanied by increased inter-layer fragmentation, reflecting 
compromised integrative function across frequency bands.
DISCUSSION: The findings revealed specific topological alterations, including 
reduced modularity, altered centrality, and decreased controllability, all of 
which are closely linked to AD-related network degeneration. By leveraging 
multi-frequency EEG data, the multiplex approach shows significant clinical 
potential for monitoring disease progression and supporting personalized 
treatments, with the ability to detect subtle connectivity disruptions before 
cognitive symptoms manifest.
CONCLUSION: Multiplex network analysis reveals distinct and robust alterations 
in the functional brain architecture of individuals with Alzheimer's Disease. 
These network-level disruptions offer valuable insights into the pathophysiology 
of AD and highlight potential avenues for early diagnosis and targeted 
therapeutic strategies aimed at preserving cognitive function.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading source of dementia, evidenced by cognitive 
debility, tau neurofibrillary tangles, and amyloid-β plaques. Recent studies 
emphasize the gut-brain axis as a vital element in the pathogenesis of 
Alzheimer's disease, involving microbial, neuronal, immunological, and hormonal 
mechanisms. The composition of gut microbiota dysbiosis is determined by growth 
in intestinal barrier permeability and activation of immune cells, which causes 
impaired function of the blood-brain barrier that stimulates neural injury, 
neuronal loss, neuroinflammation, and eventually AD. Various studies have 
reported that the gut microbiota plays a crucial role in brain function and 
changes in individual behavior, as well as in bacterial amyloid formation. 
Growing experimental and clinical data specify the conspicuous role of 
intestinal dysbiosis and microbiota- host interactions in AD. The importance of 
this paper is the focus on the potential association of AD and gut microbiota 
and also a discussion of the therapeutic modalities of inhibiting gut dysbiosis.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder in the aging 
population, remains without definitive therapeutic solutions. Emerging insights 
into the gut microbiota (GM) and its bidirectional communication with the 
central nervous system(CNS) through the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA) have 
unveiled potential correlative mechanisms that may contribute to AD 
pathogenesis, though causal evidence remains limited. Dysregulation of GM 
composition (dysbiosis) exacerbates AD progression via neuroinflammation, 
amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition, and tau hyperphosphorylation (p-tau), while restoring 
microbial homeostasis presents a promising therapeutic strategy. Fecal 
microbiota transplantation (FMT), a technique to reconstitute gut ecology by 
transferring processed fecal matter from healthy donors, has demonstrated 
efficacy in ameliorating cognitive deficits and neuropathology in AD animal 
models. Preclinical studies reveal that FMT reduces Aβ plaques, normalizes tau 
phosphorylation, suppresses inflammasome activation, and restores microglial 
homeostasis through modulation of microbial metabolites and immune pathways. 
Although clinical evidence remains limited to case reports and small-scale 
trials showing potential therapeutic effect, safety concerns regarding long-term 
effects and protocol standardization necessitate further investigation. This 
review synthesizes current knowledge on GM-AD interactions, evaluates FMT's 
mechanistic potential, and discusses challenges in translating this ancient 
practice into a cutting-edge AD therapy. Rigorous randomized controlled trials 
and personalized microbiota-based interventions are imperative to advance FMT 
from bench to bedside.

There is a growing body of research showing that Alzheimer's disease (AD) is 
related to enteric dysbacteriosis. Exercise can be effective in alleviating AD, 
but the effects that exercise has on the gut microbiota in AD patients needs to 
be further studied. Through this study, we aimed to investigate the differences 
in the diversity of gut microorganisms between AD model mice and wild-type mice 
and the effect that treadmill exercise has on the composition of the gut 
microbiota in both types of mice. C57BL/6 wild-type mice were randomly divided 
into a sedentary control group (WTC) and an exercise group (WTE); APP/PS1 double 
transgenic mice were also randomly divided into a sedentary control group (ADC) 
and an exercise group (ADE). After the control group remained sedentary for 12 
weeks and a 12-week treadmill exercise intervention was adopted for the exercise 
group, the rectal contents were collected so that they could undergo V3-V4 16S 
rDNA sequencing, and a comparative analysis of the microbial composition and 
diversity was also performed. The alpha diversity of the gut microbiota in AD 
mice was lower than that in wild-type mice, but exercise increased the gut 
microbial diversity in both types of mice. At the phylum level, the dominant 
microorganisms in all four groups of mice were Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. 
There was an increase in the Bacteroidetes phylum in AD mice. Treadmill exercise 
reduced the abundance of Bacteroidetes in both groups of mice, whereas the 
abundance of Firmicutes increased. At the genus level, Muribaculaceae, the 
Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group, Alloprevotella, and Alistipes were in relatively 
high abundance. Muribaculaceae and Alloprevotella were in greater abundance in 
AD mice than in wild-type mice, but both decreased after treadmill exercise. 
Through performing linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe), we found 
that the dominant strains in AD mice were Campilobacterota, Helicobacteraceae, 
Escherichia-Shigella, and other malignant bacteria, whereas exercise resulted in 
an increase in probiotics among the dominant strains in both types of mice. 
Although gut microbial diversity decreases and malignant bacteria increase in AD 
mice, treadmill exercise can increase gut microbial diversity and lead to the 
development of dominant strains of probiotics in both types of mice. These 
findings provide a basis for applying exercise as a treatment for AD.

Background and Objectives: Alzheimer's disease (AD) has become a serious health 
problem. Agomelatine (Ago) is a neuroprotective antidepressant. This study aimed 
to assess how Ago influences behavioral outcomes in AD-like rat model. Materials 
and Methods: Forty-eight Wistar albino rats were allocated into four groups: 
Control (C), Alzheimer's disease-like model (AD), Alzheimer's disease-like model 
treated with Ago (ADAgo), and Ago alone (Ago). Physiological saline was injected 
intrahippocampally in C and Ago animals, whereas Aβ peptide was delivered 
similarly in AD and ADAgo rats. On day 15, 0.9% NaCl was administered to the C 
and AD groups, and Agomelatine (1 mg/kg/day) was infused into ADAgo and Ago rats 
via osmotic pumps for 30 days. Behavioral functions were evaluated using Open 
Field (OF), Forced Swim (FST), and Morris Water Maze (MWM) tests. Brain tissues 
were examined histopathologically. Neuritin, Nestin, DCX, NeuN, BDNF, MASH1, 
MT1, and MT2 transcripts were quantified by real-time PCR. Statistical analyses 
were performed in R 4.3.1, with p < 0.05 deemed significant. Results: In the 
FST, swimming, climbing, immobility time, and mobility percentage differed 
significantly among groups (p < 0.05). In the MWM, AD rats exhibited impaired 
learning and memory that was ameliorated by Ago treatment (p < 0.05). DCX 
expression decreased in AD rats but was elevated by Ago (p < 0.05). Nestin 
levels differed significantly between control and AD animals; MT1 expression 
varied between control and AD cohorts; and MT2 transcript levels were 
significantly lower in AD, ADAgo, and Ago groups compared to C (all p < 0.05). 
Conclusions: Ago exhibits antidepressant-like activity in this experimental AD 
model and may enhance cognitive function via mechanisms beyond synaptic 
plasticity and neurogenesis.

Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is a critical serine/threonine kinase that 
plays a central role in regulating various cellular processes. In the nervous 
system, GSK-3 is particularly implicated in the pathogenesis of 
neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. 
Recent studies have demonstrated that GSK-3 modulates multiple pathological 
mechanisms through diverse signaling pathways, including PI3K/Akt and 
Wnt/β-catenin. These mechanisms involve Tau protein hyperphosphorylation, 
β-amyloid production and deposition, autophagic dysfunction in neurons, and 
impaired synaptic plasticity. This review summarizes the biological functions of 
GSK-3, its signaling mechanisms, and its multifaceted roles in neurodegenerative 
disease progression. Furthermore, we highlight current therapeutic strategies 
targeting GSK-3 and recent advances in preclinical studies. In particular, three 
representative classes of GSK-3 inhibitors-namely allosteric covalent 
inhibitors, multi-target regulators, and ATP-competitive inhibitors-are 
discussed with respect to their mechanisms of action and research progress. 
Summary, GSK-3 represents a central pathological mediator and a promising 
therapeutic target in neurodegenerative disorders, and targeted modulation of 
GSK-3 activity may offer a potential disease-modifying approach for future 
interventions.

Neuroinflammation contributes to cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
and the neurokinin pathway has been implicated in the pathophysiology of AD. 
Although Substance P (SP), an endogenous ligand to the neurokinin 1 receptor 
(NK1R), is primarily known as a neurotransmitter, but emerging evidence 
indicates it has shown both pro and anti-inflammatory actions. However, the 
dose-dependent nature of the SP-NK1R axis's functional role remains to be fully 
elucidated. In this study, we examined the effects of SP in a rat model of AD 
induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). A dose of 150 μg/10 μl of LPS was 
administered through intracerebroventricular injection to induce cognitive 
impairment in the rats. Two doses of SP, 50 μg/kg and 500 μg/kg were 
administered intraperitoneally once a day for 21 days. Behavioral assessments 
included the Morris water maze test and novel object recognition test to 
investigate cognitive defects, and the open field test evaluated locomotion. 
Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), amyloid-beta (Aβ), 
acetylcholinesterase (AChE), lipid peroxidation, and catalase were estimated in 
the frontal cortex and hippocampus. The cAMP-responsive element-binding (CREB) 
protein levels in the whole brain were estimated by western blot. The LPS 
treatment significantly impaired cognition, increased levels of cytokines, Aβ, 
oxidative stress, and AChE, while decreasing CREB levels. Notably, the lower 
dose of SP (50 μg/kg) restored cognitive performance and markers of AD. In 
contrast, the higher dose of SP (500 μg/kg) failed to reverse spatial memory 
impairment and neuroinflammation. Thus, our data propose the dose-dependent 
effect of SP on neuroinflammation-induced cognitive deficits in AD.

Anti-amyloid treatments for early Alzheimer's disease very effectively remove 
amyloid deposits from the brain and have shown an approximately 30 % less 
worsening in cognitive functions compared to placebo. Some additional metrics, 
such as time-saved, i.e. the additional time people may live independently, have 
been suggested to better inform patients and the general public about the 
benefits and risks of these medications. Some authors report 4-6 months, and 
others 10-13 months, depending on the treatment period, time of follow-up, and 
the methodology used. Taking into consideration that these drugs' regimens are 
monthly or bi-weekly intravenous infusions requiring clinical supervision, and 
the necessary brain MRIs for follow-up, we argue that the time spent travelling 
by the patients and their family members should also be taken into consideration 
when proposing anti-amyloid treatments, and specifically, when discussing the 
amount of time saved. In this study, we report that nearly half of the possible 
eligible patients for anti-amyloid treatments experience a reduction in 
motivation after receiving the information about the number of times required to 
come to the hospital, especially those travelling long distances (average time: 
60 min for one-way). We propose a rough estimate for the additional time 
patients and their family members are likely to spend in these arrangements and 
suggest these additional calculations should be part of the decision-making 
process.

Centella asiatica, commonly known as Gotu Kola, has been used for centuries in 
traditional medicine due to its neuroprotective and cognitive-enhancing 
properties. This study explores the potential of bioactive compounds from 
Centella asiatica, including asiaticoside, madecassoside, and asiatic acid, as 
natural inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), a key enzyme implicated in 
neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Using a comprehensive 
in silico approach, we performed multiple-ligand mapping, docking simulations, 
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann 
Surface Area (MM-PBSA) calculations. Docking results revealed that asiaticoside 
and madecassoside exhibited strong binding affinities to the AChE active site, 
with binding free energies of -190.87 kJ/mol and -197.06 kJ/mol, respectively, 
outperforming the reference compound Donepezil (-133.51 kJ/mol). MD simulations 
further confirmed the stability of these interactions, supported by consistent 
hydrogen bonding with key residues, including Trp86, Tyr72, Trp286, Ser293, 
Phe295, Tyr337, Phe338, and Tyr341. MM-PBSA calculations validated these 
findings, highlighting the potential of Centella asiatica compounds as effective 
and stable AChE inhibitors. These results underscore the promise of Centella 
asiatica as a natural source for developing novel therapeutics targeting 
cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases.

Marine ecosystems are characterized by an immense biodiversity and represent a 
rich source of biological compounds with promising potential for the development 
of novel therapeutic drugs. This review describes the most promising 
marine-derived neuroprotective compounds with strong potential for the treatment 
of neurodegenerative disorders. We focus specifically on the retina and 
brain-two key components of the central nervous system-as primary targets for 
therapeutic interventions against neurodegeneration. Alzheimer's disease and 
retinal degeneration diseases are used here as a representative model of 
neurodegenerative disorders, where complex molecular processes such as protein 
misfolding, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation drive disease progression. 
We also examine gene therapy approaches inspired by marine biology, with 
particular attention to their application in retinal diseases, aimed at 
preserving or restoring photoreceptor function and vision.

The popularity of bioactive compounds extracted from sea cucumbers is growing 
due to their wide application in the pharmaceutical industry, particularly in 
the development of drugs for neurological disorders. Different types of 
compounds, such as saponins, phenolic compounds, cerebrosides, and 
glucocerebrosides, are being studied intensively for their efficacy in assessing 
the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, 
Parkinson's disease, and brain tumors, among others. Positive results have been 
observed in the upregulation in the content of p-CREB, p-PL3K, BDNF, SOD, and 
MDA. Furthermore, the neuroprotective mechanism of the compounds against 
Alzheimer's disease revealed that suppressing the phosphorylation of tau protein 
by the PI3K/Akt/GSK3β pathway leads to improved synaptic plasticity and reduced 
nerve fiber tangles. This comprehensive review explores recent findings on the 
therapeutic potential of sea cucumber bioactives in the treatment of 
brain-related disorders.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Multifactorial prevention of falls in persons with 
dementia has minimal or non-significant effects. Personalised prevention is 
recommended. We have previously shown that gait speed, basic activities of daily 
living (ADL), and depression (high Cornell scores) were independent predictors 
of falls in persons with mild and moderate cognitive impairment. This study 
explored person-specific risks of falls related to physical, mental, and 
cognitive functions and types of dementia: Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular 
dementia (VD), mixed Alzheimer's disease/vascular dementia (MixADVD), 
frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB).
METHODS: The study used data from "The Norwegian Registry of Persons Assessed 
for Cognitive Symptoms" (NorCog). Differences between the dementia groups and 
predictors of falls, gait speed, ADL, and Cornell scores were analysed.
RESULTS: Among study participants, 537/1321 (40.7%) reported a fall in the past 
year, with significant variations between dementia diagnoses. Fall incidence 
increased with age, comorbidity/polypharmacy, depression, and MAYO fluctuation 
score and with reduced physical activity, gait speed, and ADL. Persons with VD 
and MixADVD had high fall incidences and impaired gait speed and ADL. Training 
of physical fitness, endurance, muscular strength, coordination, and balance and 
optimising treatment of comorbidities and medication enhance gait speed. 
Improving ADL necessitates, in addition, relief of cognitive impairment and 
fluctuations. Relief of depression and fluctuations by psychological and 
pharmacological interventions is necessary to reduce the high fall risk in 
persons with DLB.
CONCLUSIONS: The fall incidence and fall predictors varied significantly. 
Personalised interventions presuppose knowledge of each individual's fall risk 
factors.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder with a 
pressing need for novel therapeutics. However, current medications only offer 
symptomatic relief, without tackling the underlying pathology. To explore the 
bioactive potential of marine-derived fungi, this study focused on Aspergillus 
terreus C23-3, a strain isolated from the coral Pavona cactus in Xuwen County, 
China, which showed a richer metabolite fingerprint among the three deposited A. 
terreus strains. AntiSMASH analysis based on complete genome sequencing 
predicted 68 biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) with 7 BGCs synthesizing 
compounds reported to have anti-AD potential, including benzodiazepines, 
benzaldehydes, butenolides, and lovastatin. Liquid chromatography coupled with 
mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based combinational metabolomic annotation verified 
most of the compounds predicted by BGCs with the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) 
inhibitor territrem B characterized from its fermentation extract. Subsequently, 
molecular docking showed that these compounds, especially aspulvione B1, 
possessed strong interactions with AD-related targets including AChE, 
cyclin-dependent kinase 5-p25 complex (CDK5/p25), glycogen synthase kinase-3β 
(GSK-3β), and monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B). In conclusion, the 
genomic-metabolomic analyses and molecular docking indicated that C23-3 is a 
high-value source strain for anti-AD natural compounds.

Periodontitis, a chronic inflammatory disease affecting the supporting tissues 
of the teeth, has been linked to the onset of neurological diseases, including 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). A primary mechanism connecting these two issues is 
oxidative stress caused by an imbalance between antioxidant defenses and 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) synthesis. This review compiles results from both 
animal and human studies that explore how oxidative stress resulting from 
periodontitis leads to neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and 
cognitive decline in AD. Studies in animals indicate that periodontal infections 
worsen brain oxidative damage, as evidenced by elevated lipid peroxidation 
markers, such as malondialdehyde (MDA), and indicators of oxidative DNA damage, 
including 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG). Additionally, significant 
reductions in crucial antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD) 
and glutathione peroxidase, along with neuroinflammation and cognitive deficits, 
are observed in mouse models of induced periodontitis. Supporting evidence from 
human studies reveals lower total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in individuals with 
both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and periodontitis, as well as increased systemic 
oxidative stress markers, such as advanced oxidation protein products (AOPRs). 
These findings suggest a mechanistic relationship through oxidative stress 
pathways between periodontal inflammation and neurodegeneration. Given the 
extensive impact of periodontitis, enhancing periodontal health could be a 
viable strategy to reduce oxidative damage and lower the risk of cognitive 
decline. Further research is needed to clarify causality and to investigate 
antioxidant treatments aimed at preventing or slowing the progression of AD in 
patients with periodontal disease.

Roles of Type 10 17β-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase in Health and Disease.

Type 10 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17β-HSD10) is the HSD17B10 gene 
product. It plays an appreciable part in the carcinogenesis and pathogenesis of 
neurodegeneration, such as Alzheimer's disease and infantile neurodegeneration. 
This mitochondrial, homo-tetrameric protein is a central hub in various 
metabolic pathways, e.g., branched-chain amino acid degradation and neurosteroid 
metabolism. It can bind to other proteins carrying out diverse physiological 
functions, e.g., tRNA maturation. It has also previously been proposed to be an 
Aβ-binding alcohol dehydrogenase (ABAD) or endoplasmic reticulum-associated 
Aβ-binding protein (ERAB), although those reports are controversial due to data 
analyses. For example, the reported km value of some substrate of ABAD/ERAB was 
five times higher than its natural solubility in the assay employed to measure 
km. Regarding any reported "one-site competitive inhibition" of ABAD/ERAB by Aβ, 
the ki value estimations were likely impacted by non-physiological 
concentrations of 2-octanol at high concentrations of vehicle DMSO and, 
therefore, are likely artefactual. Certain data associated with ABAD/ERAB were 
found not reproducible, and multiple experimental approaches were undertaken 
under non-physiological conditions. In contrast, 17β-HSD10 studies prompted a 
conclusion that Aβ inhibited 17β-HSD10 activity, thus harming brain cells, 
replacing a prior supposition that "ABAD" mediates Aβ neurotoxicity. 
Furthermore, it is critical to find answers to the question as to why elevated 
levels of 17β-HSD10, in addition to Aβ and phosphorylated Tau, are present in 
the brains of AD patients and mouse AD models. Addressing this question will 
likely prompt better approaches to develop treatments for Alzheimer's disease.

Amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregates are considered as the important factors of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). Multifunctional materials have shown significant effects in the 
diagnosis and treatment of AD by modulating the aggregation of Aβ and production 
of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Compared to traditional surgical treatment and 
radiotherapy, phototherapy has the advantages, including short response time, 
significant efficacy, and minimal side effects in disease diagnosis and 
treatment. Recent studies have shown that local thermal energy or singlet oxygen 
generated by irradiating certain organic molecules or nanomaterials with 
specific laser wavelengths can effectively degrade Aβ aggregates and depress the 
generation of ROS, promoting progress in AD diagnosis and therapy. Herein, we 
outline the development of photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy 
(PDT) strategies for the diagnosis and therapy of AD by modulating Aβ 
aggregation. The materials mainly include organic photothermal agents or 
photosensitizers, polymer materials, metal nanoparticles, quantum dots, 
carbon-based nanomaterials, etc. In addition, compared to traditional 
fluorescent dyes, aggregation-induced emission (AIE) molecules have the 
advantages of good stability, low background signals, and strong resistance to 
photobleaching for bioimaging. Some AIE-based materials exhibit excellent 
photothermal and photodynamic effects, showing broad application prospects in 
the diagnosis and therapy of AD. We further summarize the advances in the 
detection of Aβ aggregates and phototherapy of AD using AIE-based materials.

Stem cell therapies, including mesenchymal (MSCs) and haematopoietic stem cells 
(HSCs), have shown promise in neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we investigated 
the therapeutic effects of a defined combination of unmanipulated MSCs and CD34+ 
HSCs, termed Neuro-Cells (NC), in a murine model of Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
the APPswe/PS1dE9 mouse. At 12 months of age, mice received intracisternal 
injections of NC (1.39 × 106 MSCs + 5 × 105 HSCs) or vehicle. After 45 days, 
behavioural testing, immunohistochemical analyses of amyloid plaque density 
(APD), and cortical gene expression profiling were conducted. NC-treated APP/PS1 
mice exhibited preserved object recognition memory and reduced anxiety-like 
behaviours, contrasting with deficits observed in untreated transgenic controls. 
Histologically, NC treatment significantly reduced the density of small amyloid 
plaques (<50 μm2) in the hippocampus and thalamus, and total plaque burden in 
the thalamus. Gene expression analysis revealed that NC treatment normalised or 
reversed disease-associated changes in insulin receptor (IR) signalling and 
neurotrophic pathways. Specifically, NC increased expression of Bdnf, Irs2, and 
Pgc-1α, while attenuating aberrant upregulation of Insr, Igf1r, and markers of 
ageing and AD-related pathology (Sirt1, Gdf15, Arc, Egr1, Cldn5). These findings 
indicate that NC therapy mitigates behavioural and molecular hallmarks of AD, 
potentially via restoration of BDNF and insulin receptor-mediated signalling.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a set 
of multifactorial conditions that progressively impair memory processing and 
cognitive function. The study of this pathology is particularly challenging due 
to its complex etiology, which involves several pathological hallmarks, 
including amyloid plaque formation, tau protein hyperphosphorylation, 
neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and other contributing factors-all leading 
to neuronal loss. The primary therapeutic approach for AD involves the use of 
anticholinesterase agents; however, these treatments are associated with adverse 
effects, and their efficacy has been increasingly questioned. Against this 
backdrop, researchers have investigated cannabidiol (CBD) as a potential 
complementary treatment for AD. This study compiles and synthesizes current 
evidence regarding the therapeutic effects of CBD in the context of AD, 
examining its impact on the amyloid cascade, tau phosphorylation, 
neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, the cholinergic pathway, glucose and lipid 
metabolism, behavioral alterations, and physiological changes. In addition, an 
in silico analysis was conducted based on studies that identified differential 
gene expression in response to CBD. Through this analysis, we mapped the gene 
network and biological pathways involved in CBD's mechanism of action in AD, 
contributing to the identification of potential gene targets for further 
research and providing deeper insight into its therapeutic potential.

Neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) present a 
significant global health challenge, characterized by cognitive decline, 
functional impairment, and other debilitating effects. Current AD clinical 
trials often assess multiple longitudinal primary endpoints to comprehensively 
evaluate treatment efficacy. Traditional methods, however, may fail to capture 
global treatment effects, require larger sample sizes due to multiplicity 
adjustments, and may not fully utilize the available longitudinal data. To 
address these limitations, we introduce the Longitudinal Rank Sum Test (LRST), a 
novel nonparametric rank-based omnibus test statistic. The LRST enables a 
comprehensive assessment of treatment efficacy across multiple endpoints and 
time points without the need for multiplicity adjustments, effectively 
controlling Type I error while enhancing statistical power. It offers 
flexibility for various data distributions encountered in AD research and 
maximizes the utilization of longitudinal data. Simulations across realistic 
clinical trial scenarios, including those with conflicting treatment effects, 
and real-data applications demonstrate the LRST's performance, underscoring its 
potential as a valuable tool in AD clinical trials.

Despite extensive efforts dedicated to developing therapies for Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), we still lack effective approaches capable of curing or halting 
its progression. Mounting evidence highlights the critical roles of 
dysfunctional microglia, which promote the abnormal accumulation of harmful 
protein deposits and initiate aggressive neuroinflammation, contributing to both 
the onset and advancement of AD. Hereby, we develop a brain-targeted ceria 
nanoparticle (T-CeNP) that exhibits both superoxide dismutase and catalase 
mimicking activities, for AD therapy. The functionalization of advanced 
glycation endproducts (RAGE) targeting peptide facilitates the blood-brain 
barrier (BBB) penetration of T-CeNP, prevents the formation of Aβ fibrils, and 
boosts Aβ degradation by microglia. By integrating the multifunctional 
RAGE-targeting ligand and bioactive CeNPs, T-CeNP can effectively cross the BBB, 
quench elevated reactive oxygen species, attenuate microglial activation, 
disrupt Aβ aggregation, and promote its clearance in an AD mouse model, thereby 
slowing the progression of AD.

BACKGROUND: The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) did not introduce a cap on 
out-of-pocket (OOP) for newly approved Alzheimer's Disease (AD) drugs, such as 
lecanemab which is covered under Medicare Part B. Therefore, expanding the use 
of conventional anti-dementia drugs is critical to addressing the growing 
economic burden of dementia. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the causal 
relationship between specific conventional anti-dementia drug use and various 
healthcare costs with the Double/Debiased Machine Learning (DML) approach.
METHODS: Leveraging data from the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) 
spanning 2015 to 2019, we utilized a nationally representative survey linked to 
Medicare data in this study. The presence of Alzheimer's Disease and Related 
Dementias (ADRD) and anti-dementia drug use was determined through Medicare 
claims data. The health care costs were measured as total medical costs and 
categorized into Medicare costs, OOP costs, inpatient costs, and outpatient 
costs. Conventional anti-dementia drugs include Cholinesterase inhibitors 
(ChEIs) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists. The DML 
techniques were employed to investigate causal relationships.
RESULTS: A total of 12,764,487 weighted older adults with ADRD were included, 
with 34.60% of them using anti-dementia drugs. Using anti-dementia drugs could 
significantly reduce Medicare costs and inpatient costs by $4,804.26 and 
$2,842.48 on average (P < 0.001), while did not significantly influence total 
costs, OOP costs, and outpatient costs. ChEIs use could help decrease Medicare 
costs and inpatient costs significantly (P < 0.05), whereas the NMDAR antagonist 
(memantine) showed no statistically significant effect across all cost types. 
Both donepezil and rivastigmine could help significantly decrease Medicare costs 
and inpatient costs (P < 0.001). Additionally, anti-dementia drug use could 
significantly reduce Medicare costs and inpatient costs among non-Hispanic 
Whites, and significantly lower inpatient costs among non-Hispanic Blacks 
(P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: This study revealed the causal relationship between anti-dementia 
drug use and Medicare costs by employing DML. ChEIs were found to be 
contributors to the decreased Medicare costs and inpatient costs, which could 
mainly be attributed to donepezil. The use of donepezil should be expanded, 
considering the significant benefits. Furthermore, a lower OOP cap for ADRD 
beneficiaries should be established under the IRA.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) presents a significant and unmet medical need. 
Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzymes are key contributors to AD pathogenesis, 
instigating a cholinergic deficit and subsequent neurodegenerative progression, 
leading to neuronal loss and cognitive decline. This study leverages in silico 
methods to elucidate the structure-activity relationships (SAR) governing 
binding interactions and affinity between human AChE (hAChE, PDB ID: 4EY6) and 
potential novel ligands. Galantamine, a cornerstone cholinergic therapy for AD, 
serves as the template for the design of structurally diverse galantamine 
analogs. Employing rigorous molecular docking simulations and molecular dynamics 
simulations, these analogs exhibit promising potential for modulating the 
cholinergic system and mitigating cognitive dysfunction associated with AD. Our 
findings demonstrate the efficacy of computational drug design in developing 
superior galantamine analogs with enhanced target selectivity and potentially 
improved therapeutic profiles for AD patients, aiming to achieve superior 
cognitive outcomes and improved quality of life.

IMPORTANCE: Developing disease-modifying treatments is a priority for Alzheimer 
disease research.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the potential of plasma phosphorylated tau 217 
(p-tau217) and tau positron emission tomography (PET) to assess disease 
modification in treatment trials.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This diagnostic/prognostic study used 
longitudinal data from the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's 
Disease (A4) study collected from April 2014 to June 2023. Recruited from 67 
sites in the US, Canada, Australia, and Japan, participants included older 
individuals (age 65-85 years) who were cognitively unimpaired at screening and 
underwent an amyloid PET scan. Participants without elevated amyloid PET were 
included from a companion to the A4 study, the Longitudinal Evaluation of 
Amyloid Risk and Neurodegeneration (LEARN) study.
EXPOSURE: 18F-florbetapir PET imaging.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: 18F-florbetapir PET imaging was used to classify 
participants as having elevated amyloid β (Aβ+). Measures of tau included 
longitudinal plasma p-tau217 and 18F-flortaucipir PET. Cognition was assessed 
using the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (PACC).
RESULTS: A total of 1169 individuals were included from A4 Study and 538 without 
elevated amyloid PET were included from the LEARN Study. Among these 1707 
participants, the baseline mean (SD) age was 71.5 (4.7) years, 1024 (60%) were 
female, and 683 (40%) male; 1169 participants were Aβ+, and the mean (SD) 
Mini-Mental State Examination score was 28.8 (1.2). The tau PET substudy 
included 443 participants; plasma p-tau217 levels were available for 1643 
participants. The largest effect size of longitudinal tau PET accumulation at 36 
months in Aβ+ participants was in the inferior temporal gyrus. Baseline 
associations with longitudinal change in PACC score in Aβ+ participants were 
strongest in the entorhinal cortex (correlation [ρ] = -0.55; 95% CI, -0.63 to 
-0.45) and plasma p-tau217 levels (ρ = -0.47; 95% CI, -0.56 to -0.37). Tau PET 
changes in frontoparietal regions were strongly correlated with concurrent 
cognitive changes. Levels of plasma p-tau217 increased significantly in Aβ+ 
participants before showing significant deceleration (χ2 = 21.7; P < .001) and 
were not associated with concurrent cognitive change in the tau PET substudy 
(ρ = -0.03; 95% CI, -0.23 to 0.16) but were modestly associated with concurrent 
cognitive changes in the full plasma sample (n = 1119; ρ = -0.24; 95% CI, -0.34 
to -0.14).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study found that tau PET is valuable for both 
prognostic and real-time tracking of disease progression. Plasma p-tau217 
predicts cognitive changes prior to overt cognitive impairment and can 
efficiently guide participant selection. Imaging-based tau measures may enhance 
detection of disease-modifying effects and refine therapeutic targets in future 
Alzheimer disease trials.

INTRODUCTION: Small non-coding microRNAs (miRNAs) play essential roles in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Repressor element 1-silencing 
transcription factor (REST) is involved in AD, though its regulation remains 
unclear.
METHODS: We performed real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in 
autopsied brain tissues to determine miR-153-3p and AD associations. A 
reporter-based assay measured the activity of REST mRNA 3'-untranslated region 
(3'-UTR). Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)-derived neurons and human cell 
lines were applied to determine miR-153-3p regulation of endogenous proteins.
RESULTS: Elevation of miR-153-3p is associated with a reduced probability of AD, 
while elevated REST is associated with a greater probability of AD. The 3'-UTR 
functional assay pinpointed the miR-153-3p binding sites. miR-153-3p treatment 
reduced REST, amyloid precursor protein (APP), and α-synuclein (SNCA) 3'-UTR 
activities and protein levels. miR-153-3p treatment altered REST and neuronal 
differentiation in iPSC-derived neuronal stem cells. RNA-sequencing and 
proteomics revealed miR-153-3p-associated networks.
DISCUSSION: miR-153-3p reduces REST, APP, and SNCA expression, pointing toward 
its therapeutic and biomarker potential in neurodegenerative diseases.
HIGHLIGHTS: With the increased emphasis on comorbidities of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases, we identified that miR-153-3p, as a 
master regulator, reduced a group of neurodegeneration related proteins: REST, 
amyloid precursor protein (APP) and α-synuclein (SNCA) levels. The elevation of 
miR-153-3p levels is associated with reduced probability of AD in posterior 
cingulate cortex (PCC), while REST, by contrast, is associated with a greater 
probability of AD. miR-153-3p treatment alters REST protein levels and neuronal 
differentiation in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) derived neuronal cells. 
RNA sequencing proteomics and interactome analysis revealed the role of 
miR-153-3p in axonal guidance.

Bioenergetic failure and oxidative stress: mitochondrial contributions to 
Alzheimer's disease.

The pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative 
illness marked by memory loss and cognitive decline, is greatly impacted by 
mitochondrial dysfunction. Recent research suggests that a number of 
interconnected processes, such as elevated oxidative stress, disturbed energy 
metabolism, compromised calcium homeostasis, and malformed mitochondrial 
dynamics, all lead to neuronal injury. The mitochondria in AD brains have 
structural defects and the function of important oxidative 
phosphorylation-related enzymes is lowered, which results in less ATP being 
produced. Further exacerbated by mitochondrial dysfunction is the build-up of 
amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides and hyperphosphorylated tau proteins, which interact 
directly with mitochondrial membranes and proteins to cause mitochondrial 
fragmentation and hinder mitochondrial transport along neuronal axons. These 
occurrences cause an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, which 
exacerbates oxidative damage and feeds a vicious cycle. In AD, mutations in 
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and changes in mitochondrial biogenesis have also been 
documented, indicating a key involvement in the development of the illness. 
Preclinical models show promise for therapeutic approaches that attempt to 
maintain mitochondrial function, including antioxidants, drugs that target the 
mitochondria. It is crucial to comprehend the intricate relationship between 
mitochondrial dysfunction and other pathological aspects of AD to find new 
treatment targets and enhance patient outcomes. In addition to underlining its 
role in the development of AD, this review examines the complex interaction 
between mitochondrial dysfunction and AD pathogenesis, taking into account its 
potential as a biomarker and a target for intervention.

The treatment of Alzheimer's disease by acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and 
N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) inhibitors is limited by the narrow 
therapeutic window and adverse side effects of the drugs. This study aims to 
increase the efficacy and limit the side effects of donepezil, an AChE 
inhibitor, and memantine, an NMDAR inhibitor, through the addition of amyloid-β 
(Aβ)-targeting fragments to create dual-function compounds. The incorporation of 
the amyloid-targeting fragments successfully produced compounds with affinity 
for Aβ fibrils, and that can stain amyloid plaques in the brains of 5xFAD mice. 
The donepezil-based compounds showed significant changes in AChE inhibition 
compared to donepezil due to the incorporation of the Aβ-targeting fragment and 
as confirmed by molecular docking studies. The memantine-derived compound showed 
good brain uptake in 5xFAD mice but lacked compatibility with NMDAR inhibition 
based on in vitro assays and molecular docking. Importantly, the 
memantine-derived compound acts as a prodrug in vivo, releasing memantine within 
a pharmacologically relevant time frame. Overall, these findings suggest that 
dual-function compounds may be useful as drug delivery agents that can be 
metabolized to release an active drug in areas of the brain rich in amyloid 
plaques and thus could lead to improved treatments for Alzheimer's disease.

In this research work, bis-thiadiazole based sulfonamide hybrid analogues (1-15) 
were synthesized by a novel synthetic approach. Structural confirmation was 
accomplished through 1HNMR, 13CNMR, and HREI-MS techniques. Further, these 
analogues were examined for their biological activities against AChE and BuChE 
(Alzheimer disease). These compounds have a diverse range of potency against 
targeted enzymes with inhibitory concentration ranges for AChE 
(2.80 ± 0.30-21.10 ± 0.10 μM) and for BuChE (3.20 ± 0.10-22.40 ± 0.70 μM), 
respectively. Compounds 4, 9, and 11 emerged as the potent compounds against 
targeted enzymes and have inhibitory concentrations lower than donepezil 
(IC50 = 5.50 ± 0.10 and 6.10 ± 0.20 μM) used as a reference drug. In addition, 
versatile computational approaches were adopted to determine interactive 
properties (by molecular docking), electronic distribution and stability 
(through DFT calculations), and drug likeness characteristics (by ADMET 
predictions) of the synthesized potent scaffolds. Product confirmation was 
confirmed by thin layer chromatography.

Early and accurate Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis is essential due to its 
progressive nature and significant impact. This study reviews and analyses 
FDG-PET and HPLC techniques in detecting inflammation and microglia activation 
in AD, marking the first comparison of their diagnostic capabilities. Through a 
literature search of publications from January 2021 to December 2023 across 
Scopus, Science Direct, and PubMed databases, 31 relevant articles were selected 
for analysis. FDG-PET and HPLC data on sensitivity, specificity, and 
inflammation were examined, highlighting their roles in detecting amyloid 
plaques, microglial activation, and blood/CSF metabolite regulation. Although 
amyloid PET offers higher sensitivity, FDG-PET uniquely classifies cognitive 
stages in AD despite its limitations due to glucose metabolism variance. Whereas 
HPLC provides insight into metabolic profile changes, it is noted for being 
invasive and costly. The combined use of FDG-PET and HPLC promises a 
comprehensive AD diagnostic approach by offering unique, complementary insights 
into functional and molecular brain changes. However, further validation is 
needed to overcome technical challenges and confirm their effectiveness before 
widespread adoption. The advancement of these diagnostic tools, alongside 
ongoing research, could significantly improve early AD detection, monitoring, 
and treatment. This review provides a novel assessment and comparison of the 
diagnostic utility of FDG-PET and HPLC techniques for detecting 
neuroinflammation and microglia activation in Alzheimer's disease by analyzing 
relevant studies between 2021 and 2023, highlighting their complimentary 
strengths and limitations.

INTRODUCTION: White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are characteristic of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), and cognitive reserve (CR) protects cognitive 
function. However, whether WMHs mediate the CR-cognition relationship remains 
unclear.
METHODS: Brain imaging, clinical features, and neuropsychological assessments 
were performed, and CR was measured using the Cognitive Reserve Index 
questionnaire. Bootstrap mediation analysis examined CR's role in specific 
cognitive functions, controlling for covariates.
RESULTS: Participants who were cognitively unimpaired (CU; n = 85, mean 
age = 68.6 ± 5.7) and who had mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n = 43, mean 
age = 71.8 ± 6.5) or AD (n = 61, mean age = 72.8 ± 6.2) were included. CR was 
positively associated with global and non-memory cognitive functions in the CU 
and MCI groups. In the CU group, WMHs served as a mediator between CR and global 
cognitive ability.
DISCUSSION: CR may maintain the optimal cognitive function by mitigating the WMH 
burden independently of AD-related brain changes.
HIGHLIGHTS: Cognitive reserve (CR) positively links to non-memory 
cognition.Cognitive reserve mitigates white matter hyperintensities to preserve 
cognition.Cognitive reserve primarily protects cognition in pre-Alzheimer's 
stages.

OBJECTIVE: The dried succulent stem of C. tubulosa (Schenk) Wight has long been 
used as herbal medicine in China and other regions of Asia for its tonifying 
properties. This study aimed to elucidate the pharmacological mechanisms of the 
total glycosides from Cistanche tubulosa (GCT) in ameliorating cognitive 
decline, with a focus on gut microbiota remodeling and metabolic regulation.
METHODS: Six-month-old APP/PS1 double-transgenic mice received oral GCT at three 
doses or donepezil for 60 days. Cognitive function was assessed by the Morris 
water maze. Aβ burden and inflammatory factors were evaluated by 
immunohistochemistry and ELISA. Gut microbiota was analyzed using 16S rRNA 
sequencing. Metabolomic profiles of mice serum and brain were profiled by a 
targeted metabolomics approach that enabled simultaneous quantitation of 306 
metabolites. The effect of GCT on pure-cultured bacterial strain was assessed 
via growth curve analysis in vitro.
RESULTS: GCT treatment significantly improved spatial memory and reduced the 
protein levels of Aβ and proinflammatory factors in APP/PS1 mice. Multi-omics 
analyses revealed that GCT rapidly enriched beneficial taxa like Akkermansia and 
suppresses Firmicutes since the seventh day of intervention, leading to 
increased neuroprotective short-chain fatty acids (e.g., β-hydroxybutyrate) and 
decreased pro-inflammatory long-chain fatty acids in both serum and brain. 
Crucially, in-vitro experiments demonstrated that GCT directly promoted the 
proliferation of Akkermansia muciniphila, a key probiotic implicated in AD 
amelioration.
CONCLUSION: This work uncovers a novel "gut microbiota-fatty acid 
metabolism-neuroinflammation" axis as the primary mechanism underlying GCT's 
anti-AD effects. These findings highlight GCT's therapeutic potential and offer 
new mechanistic insights into how low-bioavailability phytochemicals exert 
systemic benefits via the gut-brain axis.

In this study, novel 1E,1'E-hydrazine-bis(phenoxy-1,2,3-triazol-acetamide) 
derivatives 10a-n were synthesized, and because of their structural features, 
they were evaluated against acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase 
(BChE), and α-glucosidase. AChE and BChE are two important targets in the 
treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and α-glucosidase is a 
carbohydrate-hydrolyzing enzyme with therapeutic importance in diabetes. 
Furthermore, cell studies were performed on the title compounds against SH-SY5Y 
neuroblastoma cells as a cancer cell line and HEK293 cells as a normal cell 
line. In vitro enzymatic evaluations demonstrated that these new compounds were 
active against the studied enzymes in comparison to standard inhibitors. In this 
regard, all the synthesized compounds were more potent than the standard 
inhibitors tacrine and donepezil against BChE, and most of these compounds were 
more potent than tacrine against AChE. Moreover, most of the target synthesized 
compounds were more potent than the standard inhibitor acarbose against 
α-glucosidase. The most potent compound against AChE and BChE was the 
2,4-dichloro derivative 10k, and the most potent compound against α-glucosidase 
was the 2-chloro derivative 10h. Moreover, in vitro cell studies demonstrated 
that compounds 10k and 10h with a selectivity index of >10 demonstrated more 
cytotoxic effects on the cancer cell line SH-SY5Y than on the normal cell line 
HEK293. A docking study showed that the latter compounds attached to the active 
sites of the target enzymes with binding energies more favorable than those of 
the selected standard inhibitors. Furthermore, docking studies demonstrated that 
compound 10k interacted with both the catalytic and peripheral anionic sites of 
AChE and BChE. This property led to the better efficacy of the compound in the 
treatment of AD.

Astrocytes, the most prevalent glial cells in the central nervous system (CNS), 
play crucial roles in maintaining CNS homeostasis and responding to various 
pathological stimuli. They play key roles in neural development, 
neurotransmission, neuroinflammation, metabolic support, and tissue repair. 
Recent advancements in single-cell sequencing have revealed the remarkable 
heterogeneity of astrocytes, with distinct subpopulations differentially 
contributing to disease progression in neurological disorders, including 
Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis, ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and multiple 
sclerosis. In addition, they play an important role in various behavioral 
neuropsychiatric disorders. This review highlights the dual roles of astrocytes 
in disease progression, driven by their diverse molecular profiles and 
functions. It outlines the key molecular mechanisms underlying astrocyte 
heterogeneity and their impact on neuroinflammation, neuronal support, and ionic 
balance regulation. Additionally, the review discusses potential therapeutic 
strategies targeting astrocytes to modulate these processes, aiming to improve 
treatment outcomes in neurological diseases. By elucidating the specific roles 
of astrocyte subsets in disease, this review seeks to advance the development of 
precision medicine for astrocyte-related neurological disorders.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder. Despite 
substantial research efforts, our understanding of its pathogenesis remains 
incomplete, limiting the development of effective treatments and preventive 
strategies. The potential role of microbial pathogens in AD etiology has gained 
increasing attention. Various human microbial pathogens have been identified in 
the brains of AD patients, leading to the pathogen hypothesis, which posits that 
these microorganisms may disrupt the brain's immune regulation and homeostasis. 
In this study, we examine the effects of proteins from three pathogens, Borrelia 
burgdorferi, HSV-1, and Porphyromonas gingivalis, on the aggregation of 
antimicrobial peptide amyloid-β (Aβ). Three of the four studied proteins were 
found to attenuate the aggregation of Aβ42 by interacting with its soluble form 
and inhibiting primary and secondary pathways. These in vitro findings were 
further supported by experiments using mature neurons derived from human 
pluripotent stem cells, which showed an increased accumulation of amyloid 
precursor protein (APP) aggregates upon infection with HSV-1 or exposure to the 
OspA surface protein from B. burgdorferi. Together, our results provide 
mechanistic insights into how pathogen-associated proteins modulate Aβ42 
aggregation, contributing to an understanding of their potential role in AD 
pathogenesis.

The intricate pathological mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease (AD), along with 
the restrictive nature of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) that further impedes the 
drug brain entry, underscore the pressing need for innovative combinational 
therapy to achieve effective treatment outcomes. Intranasal administration, 
capable of bypassing BBB by direct transport through olfactory and trigeminal 
nerves, provides a promising approach for treating neurological disorders. 
Herein, the guanidinium-modified calix[5]arene (GC5AY) is developed as a 
single-molecule pleuripotent scaffold, demonstrating small size, positive charge 
and desirable amphiphilicity, which facilitate its efficient traverse of nasal 
mucosal barrier. The multifunctionality of GC5AY, including inhibiting amyloid 
fibrosis, scavenging reactive oxygen species and drug delivery, enables it to 
serve as a sophisticated platform for constructing multi-target AD therapeutic 
agents. In light of this, by loading neuroprotective agent Trilobatin (TLB) into 
the cavity of GC5AY, intranasal administration of the TLB@GC5AY formulation is 
verified to effectively attenuate the cognitive impairment of AD mice, 
demonstrating multifaceted pathological improvements, while also possessing good 
biocompatibility. In response to the growing appeal for combinational therapy of 
AD, the approach proposed in this study has provided a readily generalizable 
strategy to fulfill this pursuit.

A hallmark pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease is the aberrant 
aggregation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) protein. While current therapeutics that target 
the imbalance between Aβ synthesis and clearance demonstrate the ability to 
clear amyloid plaques, their limited clinical efficacy underscores the need for 
alternative approaches that directly disrupt Aβ aggregates. In this study, we 
employed a hydrogel model constructed from the Aβ core peptide to validate the 
peptide cleavage capability of enediyne derivatives, followed by high-resolution 
liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of the resulting cleavage 
fragments. Building on the established paradigm of radical-mediated protein 
damage, we propose that biradical species generated via cycloaromatization of 
enediynes destabilize the hydrophobic core of Aβ through either hydrogen 
abstraction from peptide or modification of its backbone. Furthermore, the 
elevate concentration of oxidation products leads to alterations in the local 
chemical environment, thereby facilitating hydrolysis of the peptide bonds. 
These findings highlight the potential of enediynes as chemically tractable 
tools for modulating Aβ aggregation and validate radical-based strategies for 
targeting amyloid species in neurodegenerative diseases.

Neuronal interactions between inhibitory and excitatory neurons play a pivotal 
role in regulating the balance of excitation and inhibition in the central 
nervous system (CNS). Consequently, the efficacy of inhibitory/excitatory 
synapses profoundly affects neural network processing and overall neuronal 
functions. Here, we describe a novel form of long-term potentiation (LTP) 
induced at cortical inhibitory synapses and its behavioral consequences. We show 
that high-frequency laser stimulation (HFLS) of GABAergic neurons elicit 
inhibitory LTP (i-LTP) in pyramidal neurons of the auditory cortex (AC). The 
selective activation of cholecystokinin-expressing GABA (GABACCK) neurons is 
essential for the formation of HFLS-induced i-LTP, rather than the classical 
parvalbumin (PV) neurons and somatostatin (SST) neurons. Intriguingly, i-LTP can 
be evoked in the AC by adding the exogenous neuropeptide CCK when PV neurons and 
SST neurons are selectively activated in PV-Cre and SST-Cre mice, respectively. 
Additionally, we discovered that low-frequency laser stimulation (LFLS) of PV 
neurons paired with HFLS of GABACCK neurons potentiates the inhibitory effect of 
PV interneurons on pyramidal neurons, thereby generating heterosynaptic i-LTP in 
the AC. Notably, light activation of GABACCK neurons in CCK-Cre mice 
significantly attenuates sound- shock associative memory, while stimulation of 
PV neurons does not affect this memory in PV-Cre mice. In conclusion, these 
results demonstrate a critical mechanism regulating the excitation-inhibition 
balance and modulating learning and memory in cortical circuits. This mechanism 
might serve as a potential target for the treatment of neurological disorders, 
including epilepsy and Alzheimer's disease.

OBJECTIVE: This study examines how social and healthcare structures in Ireland 
shape the experiences of individuals diagnosed with Lewy body dementia (LBD) and 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), with particular attention to diagnostic pathways, care 
access, and social constructions of dementia.
METHODS: Twenty-three participants with mild to moderate dementia resulting from 
LBD (n = 12) and AD (n = 11) participated in in-depth interviews between 
September 2022 and February 2023. Using a descriptive phenomenological approach 
informed by social constructivist perspectives, interviews were analysed to 
understand how institutional, geographical, and social factors influence 
experiences of diagnosis, post-diagnostic support, and public awareness.
RESULTS: Healthcare structures and social understanding of dementia created 
divergent experiences for individuals with LBD and AD. While AD participants 
generally encountered established diagnostic pathways aligned with dominant 
cultural understanding of dementia as memory loss, LBD participants faced 
structural barriers due to complex symptomatology and limited specialist 
knowledge. Geographic inequalities in accessing specialised diagnostic services 
particularly affected rural LBD participants. Post-diagnosis, LBD participants 
encountered greater institutional barriers in accessing appropriate support, 
reflecting systemic gaps in service provision. Both groups highlighted how 
societal misconceptions about dementia shaped their lived experiences, with LBD 
participants particularly affected by the cultural dominance of the Alzheimer's 
narrative.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates how social structures, healthcare systems, 
and cultural understandings of dementia create inequitable experiences for 
individuals with different forms of dementia in Ireland. Findings highlight the 
need for structural changes in healthcare delivery, increased professional 
education about LBD, and broader societal awareness to address these 
disparities.

People with dementia (PWD) are frequently exposed to polypharmacy and 
potentially inappropriate medication use, in which the risks of medication use 
outweigh the benefits or the medication is not aligned with treatment goals. 
Appropriate deprescribing of unnecessary or potentially inappropriate 
medications is essential to high-quality care for PWD, to avoid iatrogenic harm 
and improve health and well-being for patients and their care partners. In this 
article, we review the risks of polypharmacy in PWD and evidence for the safety 
and efficacy of deprescribing in this population. Building off existing 
deprescribing frameworks for older adults with multimorbidity and limited life 
expectancy, we provide a roadmap for deprescribing in PWD that addresses the 
unique challenges of living dementia, including the variable disease course, 
high prevalence of distressing behavioral symptoms, and central role of care 
partners. The steps include: (1) identify potential targets for deprescribing by 
eliciting medication-related goals and considering tradeoffs, (2) develop a 
tapering plan, (3) complete additional actions that are necessary before 
deprescribing, and (4) provide close follow-up. Lastly, we provide 
evidence-based strategies for communicating with patients and their care 
partners about deprescribing, adapted from the FRAME tool.

Mitochondria serve as an important cellular organelle for maintaining 
neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity in neuronal cells by playing a key 
role in ATP generation, maintaining calcium homeostasis, and regulating the 
levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), etc. The regulation of the dynamic 
nature of mitochondria, including their fission, fusion, and removal of damaged 
mitochondria by mitophagy, is also very important for neuronal health. 
Abnormalities in mitochondrial processes, including but not limited to fission, 
fusion, and mitophagy, are known to be associated with numerous 
neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Huntington's disease 
(HD). In the recent past, the Rho kinase (ROCK) isoforms, particularly ROCK1 and 
ROCK2, have gained a lot of attention in NDDs, mainly for their role in 
regulating the dynamics of the mitochondria, mitophagy, and other cell 
signalling pathways. By adding phosphate groups to Drp1, ROCK1 is crucial in 
supporting excessive mitochondrial fission, causing the death of neuronal cells. 
On the other hand, ROCK2 inhibits Parkin-dependent mitophagy by inhibiting the 
PTEN protein, the activator of Parkin-dependent mitophagy. This impaired 
mitochondrial quality control via reduced mitophagic flux leads to oxidative 
stress and neuronal degeneration, the central pathological feature of NDDs. The 
inhibition of ROCK isoforms has shown great promise in neuroprotective effects, 
controlling the dynamics of mitochondria in neuronal cells, lowering 
inflammation, and improving motor and cognitive functions in preclinical models 
of different NDDs, indicating ROCK isoforms as an attractive therapeutic target 
in different NDDs. This review aims to highlight the therapeutic significance of 
targeting ROCK isoforms in different NDDs.

Blueberries are anthocyanin-rich fruits widely consumed by the general 
population, with well-established health benefits on the endocrine and 
cardiovascular systems attributed to their potent anti-inflammatory properties. 
However, the potential impact of blueberry consumption on cognitive function in 
elderly individuals with prior cognitive decline, such as Alzheimer's disease 
and dementia, remains insufficiently explored in the literature. Therefore, we 
aimed to evaluate the potential effects of chronic blueberry consumption on 
cognitive performance in this population through various memory assessment 
tools. We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane for randomized controlled trials 
(RCTs) evaluating the effect of chronic blueberry consumption on cognitive 
function. We pooled standard mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence interval 
(CI) using a random-effects model. We identified nine eligible RCTs involving 
513 patients. In elderly individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 
subjective cognitive decline, blueberry intake showed a statistically 
significant improvement in episodic memory. (SMD = 0.34; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.57; 
p < 0.05). The subgroup analysis revealed that diagnostic objetivity was not a 
statistically significant effect modifier. Blueberry intake was also associated 
with improved language memory in MCI patients (SMD = 0.30; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.60; 
p < 0.05). No improvements were seen in processing speed (SMD = - 0.33; 95% CI - 
0.85 to 0.19, p > 0.05), recognition memory (SMD = 0.14; 95% CI - 0.17 to 0.46, 
p > 0.05), visuospatial learning (SMD = 0.32; 95% CI - 0.16 to 0.79, p > 0.05) 
and working memory (SMD = 0.09; 95% CI - 0.21 to 0.39, p > 0.05). Chronic 
blueberry intake may improve episodic memory in the elderly with MCI and 
subjective cognitive decline, and also language in the elderly with MCI. These 
findings should be confirmed in further multicenter trials to confirm 
generalizability and long-term impact.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major life-limiting neurodegenerative disorder 
caused by extracellular aggregation of amyloid β (Aβ) peptides. This forms 
amyloid plaques in the brain resulting in dementia and even causing death. In 
spite of great efforts towards developing therapies to cure AD, unfortunately, 
treatment is often ineffective. Herein, we investigate the possibility of 
state-of-the-art two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials to treat AD by evaluating 
their potential to perturb and disrupt Aβ peptide aggregates. The adsorption 
mechanism for a pre-formed Aβ fibril is carefully studied on five 2D materials, 
namely graphene, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), h2D-C2N, g-C3N3, and g-C3N4. 
They are screened for their disrupting effects on the peptide aggregate. It is 
found that disruption of the Aβ fibril is directly related to the strength of 
its adsorption on the 2D material, which in turn, is dominated by the van der 
Waals interactions. h-BN shows a profound disruption of the Aβ fibril followed 
by graphene. The nitrogen-containing carbon-based 2D materials, h2D-C2N, g-C3N3, 
and g-C3N4, are found to be rather poor in this aspect. Structural disruption 
parameter ρd is proposed as an index to rank the potency of 2D materials to 
inhibit Aβ fibrillation. h-BN and graphene are shown to be highly potent towards

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by cognitive decline, extracellular amyloid plaque accumulation, 
and neuronal dysfunction. The diphenylalanine (Phe-Phe) dipeptide, a core 
self-assembling motif of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides, has recently gained attention 
as a simplified and cost-effective model for mimicking amyloid aggregation in 
vitro. In this study, we established a Phe-Phe-induced AD model in SH-SY5Y 
neuroblastoma cells to investigate the effects of naringin (NAR), a 
Citrus-derived flavanone glycoside known for its antioxidative and 
anti-inflammatory properties, on AD. Following Phe-Phe exposure, cells were 
treated with NAR at subcytotoxic concentrations. Multiple end points including 
cytotoxicity, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, DNA damage (Comet 
assay), AD-related biomarkers (acetylcholinesterase (AChE), amyloid beta (Aβ), 
amyloid precursor protein (APP), tau protein), cytokine levels, caspase 
activation, and apoptosis were evaluated. NAR treatment significantly attenuated 
Phe-Phe-induced ROS production, genotoxicity, and inflammatory responses, while 
reducing apoptotic cell death and restoring biomarker levels toward 
physiological norms. These findings demonstrate that NAR exerts multitargeted 
neuroprotective effects and suggest its therapeutic potential in AD. 
Additionally, the Phe-Phe model was validated as a reproducible and biologically 
relevant in vitro system for screening anti-amyloid agents.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that leads 
to dementia. Many cases are diagnosed annually and there is no currently 
available cure. Understanding the underlying disease biology of AD through the 
study of molecular networks, particularly by mapping clinical variants to 
tissue-specific interactomes and regulatory macromolecular assemblies, offers a 
promising avenue to elucidate altered disease pathways. In this study, we 
applied differential interactome analysis using a manually curated AD dataset to 
identify how disease-associated mutations alter both transient and stable 
protein interactions. By focussing on variant-specific associations detected in 
brain-relevant tissues, we mapped disruptions in stable macromolecular 
assemblies and performed Reactome enrichment analysis to uncover perturbed 
pathways unique to each variant. Additionally, we explored therapeutic insights 
through the analysis of amyloid precursor protein (APP) physical interactors, 
identifying potential intervention points that influence amyloidogenic 
processing. Complementing protein-level data, we integrated microRNA 
(miRNA)-mediated regulatory interactions, revealing an additional layer of 
posttranscriptional control over key AD genes. Together, this multilayered 
strategy provides a framework for precision therapeutics in AD.

This study aimed to examine the effects of music therapy on cognitive functions 
and adaptation levels in older adults residing in a nursing home. The research 
was designed as a randomized controlled pilot study with a parallel group, 
pretest-posttest design (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02432763). Conducted between 
October and November 2019 in a nursing home in Turkey, the study included 30 
older adults (intervention = 15, control = 15). Data were collected using the 
Demographic Information Form, the Standardized Mini-Mental State Examination 
(SMMSE), and the Assessment Scale of Adaptation Difficulty for the Elderly 
(ASADE). The intervention group received music therapy twice a week for five 
weeks, while no intervention was applied to the control group. Data analysis 
involved independent and paired samples t-tests, Mann-Whitney U, Wilcoxon, 
chi-square, Fisher's exact test, and mixed ANOVA. Cronbach's alpha coefficients 
were 0.78 for the SMMSE and 0.81 for the ASADE. Results showed that music 
therapy led to a significant improvement in cognitive functions (p < 0.001; 
Cohen's d = 0.863, large effect) and a marked reduction in total adaptation 
difficulty scores (p < 0.001; Cohen's d = 0.778-0.845, large effect) in the 
intervention group. Significant improvements were also observed in ASADE 
subscales, including role and self-actualization (p < 0.001), mutual attachment 
(p < 0.01), self-perception (p < 0.01), and physiological condition (p < 0.05), 
whereas no significant changes were observed in the control group (p > 0.05). 
Between-group comparisons revealed significant post-intervention differences 
favoring the intervention group in both SMMSE and ASADE mean scores (p < 0.05). 
Mixed ANOVA analyses confirmed significant time-by-group interactions with large 
partial eta-squared values (≥0.14), highlighting the robustness of the 
intervention effects. Music therapy emerges as an effective non-pharmacological 
intervention for enhancing cognitive functions and adaptation levels in older 
adults residing in nursing homes. Given its ease of implementation and 
multifaceted benefits, the integration of music therapy into routine elder 
adults care is recommended.

Understanding the correlative relationship between obesity and Alzheimer 
disease.

Foreman RM, Rodriguez M.

Current literature suggests obesity can increase the risk of developing 
dementia, in addition to all-cause mortality. Although cardiovascular disease 
and metabolic disorders are well-known risks of obesity, the increased risk of 
Alzheimer disease is lesser known. This article explores the pathophysiologic 
processes behind obesity and dementia and offers recommendations for 
identification, treatment, and optimal health planning in primary care.

Acupuncture has a definite effect on the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
and its molecular mechanism has been studied more and more deeply. The 
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) signaling pathway is 
mainly involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, apoptosis, autophagy 
and synaptic plasticity, and plays an important role in the occurrence and 
development of AD. In this paper, we reviewed the role of PI3K/AKT pathway in 
the pathogenesis of AD and the mechanism of acupuncture intervention, and 
concluded that the abnormal expression of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway can lead to 
imbalance of cellular oxidative defense system, impairment of mitochondrial 
structure and function synaptic destruction, abnormal autophagy and energy 
metabolism disorders, and acupuncture can improve oxidative stress damage, 
enhance synaptic plasticity, regulate autophagic activity and regulate energy 
metabolism by regulating PI3K/AKT signaling pathway to cure AD.

OBJECTIVES: Social connectedness is associated with positive health outcomes. 
Patients discharged to skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) after heart failure 
(HF) hospitalization face a high risk of hospital readmission, but the 
association between social connectedness and successful discharge from postacute 
SNF care is unknown. This study aimed to quantify the association between social 
connectedness and successful discharge from postacute SNF care among veterans 
with HF.
DESIGN: This retrospective cohort study's primary outcome was successful 
discharge, defined as discharge to the community within 90 days of admission to 
the SNF, and survival 30 days after discharge without hospitalization or 
institutionalization. Social connectedness was measured by the Social 
Connectedness Index [SCI, range 0-5: binarized into low (SCI = 0-4) or high 
social connectedness (SCI = 5)].
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Veterans admitted to a Department of Veterans Affairs 
Medical Center for HF and subsequently discharged to a SNFs between January 2011 
and June 2019.
METHODS: We estimated the association of high SCI with successful discharge 
using a modified Poisson regression with robust error variance.
RESULTS: A total of 29,725 veterans were included. Veterans with high social 
connectedness (SCI = 5) in SNF settings were more likely to have successful 
discharge than those with lower social connectedness [adjusted relative risk 
(95% CI): 1.21 (1.13-1.31)]. This association was seen in patients with 
Alzheimer disease or Alzheimer disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) [1.32 
(1.16-1.49)] and without ADRD [1.14 (1.04-1.25)] cohorts.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Veterans with HF who were more socially connected 
in the SNF setting had higher rates of successful discharge than those with 
lower social connectedness. Low social connectedness may be an indicator of care 
needs that make discharge from SNF to home more challenging. Clinical social 
isolation measurement may be a useful tool in identifying successful discharge 
candidates.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and depression share common neuropathological 
mechanisms, with neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and impaired 
neurosteroid signalling contributing to both conditions. Allopregnanolone 
(ALLO), a potent neurosteroid, plays a crucial role in modulating mood, 
cognition, and neuroprotection via its interaction with GABA-A receptors and its 
ability to promote neurogenesis. Emerging evidence suggests that ALLO levels are 
significantly altered in AD, correlating with cognitive decline and 
neuropsychiatric symptoms, including depression. This review explores the 
pathological connection between AD and depression, highlighting the role of ALLO 
in mitigating disease progression and depressive symptoms. Preclinical studies 
demonstrate ALLO's ability to enhance synaptic plasticity, reduce β-amyloid 
toxicity, and alleviate depressive-like behaviours in AD models. Additionally, 
clinical trials investigating ALLO's therapeutic potential in AD and depression 
have shown promising results, though challenges remain in optimizing dosing, 
delivery, and patient selection. As a neurosteroid with both neuroprotective and 
antidepressant properties, ALLO represents a novel therapeutic approach that 
could bridge the gap between neurodegeneration and mood disorders. This review 
discusses the current understanding of ALLO's mechanistic role, its altered 
levels in AD and depression, and its potential as a disease-modifying therapy. 
Furthermore, we evaluate preclinical and clinical evidence supporting ALLO's 
efficacy, along with its limitations and future therapeutic prospects. By 
integrating neurosteroid-based strategies into AD treatment paradigms, ALLO may 
offer a promising avenue for addressing both cognitive decline and 
neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD-induced depression.

Lysine succinylation is a major post-translational modification affecting 
diverse proteins, and its excessive occurrence can lead to protein misfolding 
and aggregation-hallmarks of various proteinopathies, such as amyloid-β and Tau 
tangle formation in Alzheimer's disease and islet amyloid polypeptide 
aggregation in type 2 diabetes. Here, we investigated the inhibitory effects of 
bile acid metabolites (deoxycholic acid, glycocholic acid, and taurocholic acid 
sodium) and natural polyphenols (anthocyanin and salidroside) on succinylation 
and succinylation-induced amyloid aggregation. Succinylation levels were 
evaluated using the ninhydrin assay before and after treatment, and aggregation 
behavior and structural alterations were characterized by SDS-PAGE, inverted 
fluorescence microscopy, and intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy. Additionally, 
fluorescence quenching and molecular docking were used to explore the underlying 
mechanisms. All five small molecules significantly reduced succinylation in a 
concentration-dependent manner (p < 0.05). Among bile acids, taurocholic acid 
sodium exhibited the strongest suppression of aggregation (40.99 %), followed by 
glycocholic acid (28.32 %) and deoxycholic acid (27.94 %). Anthocyanin showed 
greater inhibition (33.81 %) than salidroside (26.54 %) (all p < 0.05). The 
results suggest that these small molecules inhibit succinylation-induced 
aggregation potentially by interacting with proteins and altering their 
conformations, thereby preventing excessive succinylation at lysine residues. 
This study provides new insight into the interplay between bile acid metabolism 
and protein homeostasis and highlights the therapeutic potential of natural 
compounds in preventing protein aggregation-related diseases.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-associated neurodegenerative disease marked 
by progressive cognitive deterioration and beta-amyloid (Aβ) protein buildup, 
which currently lacks therapeutic interventions to decelerate its pathogenesis. 
The M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) is integral to synaptic 
plasticity and memory processes and has emerged as a critical target for 
ameliorating AD-associated cognitive deficits. Although M1 mAChR agonists have 
pro-cognitive potential, their clinical application is limited by significant 
cholinergic side effects. Our recent findings demonstrate that VU0486846, an M1 
mAChR positive allosteric modulator (PAM) devoid of cholinergic toxicity, 
exhibits therapeutic benefits in a female APPswe/PSEN1ΔE9 (APP/PS1) Alzheimer's 
disease mouse model. This compound reversed memory deficits, alleviated 
anxiety-like behaviours, reduced Aβ pathology, and attenuated neuroinflammation 
in female mice. However, its therapeutic potential in male AD models remains to 
be fully characterized. In this study, we find that VU0486846 treatment restored 
cognitive function in male APP/PS1 mice, as evidenced by improved performance in 
the novel object recognition and Morris water maze tasks, and reduced 
anxiety-like behaviours in the open field test. VU0486846 ameliorates impaired 
autophagy signaling in the hippocampus, however, it does not alter hippocampal 
Aβ oligomer or plaque burden, despite decreasing BACE1 expression. These 
findings suggest that VU0486846 exerts behavioural and cognitive benefits via 
Aβ-independent mechanism(s). Collectively, this study highlights the therapeutic 
potential of VU0486846 in modulating AD pathophysiology, albeit via sex-specific 
signaling pathways.

Five compounds were isolated from Ferula assa-foetida and their beta-secretase 1 
inhibitory activities were evaluated. Farnesiferol B and kamolonol showed potent 
beta-secretase 1 inhibitory activity with IC50 values of 8.11 and 1.00 µM and 
competitive inhibition patterns against beta-secretase 1 with Ki values of 6.51 
and 0.41 µM, respectively. In silico pharmacokinetics showed that farnesiferol B 
was predicted to have high gastrointestinal absorption and blood-brain barrier 
permeability. In cell studies, farnesiferol B and kamolonol were nontoxic to 
normal Madin-Darby canine kidney and neuroblastoma cells, and both showed 
protective effects on neuroblastoma cells for Aβ42-induced neurotoxicity. In 
molecular docking simulations, we found that the efficacy of the compounds may 
be related to their interaction with the flap region and hydrogen bonding with 
ARG368. In addition, molecular dynamics simulation of kamolonol showed the 
ligand maintained its stability in interaction with the loop residues. These 
results show that farnesiferol B and kamolonol are potent beta-secretase 1 
inhibitors with neuroprotective effects, suggesting that they are potential 
candidates for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's 
disease.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as key regulators of neuroplasticity, 
influencing essential processes such as neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, and 
neuroinflammatory responses. This review provides a comprehensive overview of 
the general roles of miRNAs in neuroplasticity and synthesizes recent insights 
from both preclinical and clinical studies, including transcriptomic analyses 
and miRNA profiling, to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which these miRNAs 
modulate neuronal function. We have examined specific miRNAs, such as miR-132, 
miR-124, miR-134, miR-135 and miR-146a, and their roles in synaptic remodeling, 
neuronal differentiation, and regulation of neuroinflammation. Furthermore, we 
have explored the therapeutic potential of targeting these miRNAs in 
neurodegenerative diseases, with a focus on Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's 
disease. The review highlights the novelty of miRNA-based interventions and 
innovative therapeutic delivery strategies, such as exosome-based systems, and 
lipid nanoparticles. Despite promising results in animal models, clinical 
translation remains limited due to challenges in delivery systems, off-target 
effects, and the need for validated biomarkers. Therefore, further studies, 
especially longitudinal trials in humans, are essential to advance the clinical 
utility of miRNA-targeted therapies in neurology.

BACKGROUND: The field of Alzheimer disease (AD) has been moving toward earlier 
detection, personalized assessment of dementia risk, and dementia prevention. In 
the near future, a gap is expected between the growing demand for 
Alzheimer-related health care and a shrinking workforce. Responsibility is 
increasingly assigned to individuals to take an active role in their own brain 
health management and dementia prevention. Digital tools are thought to offer 
support regarding these processes.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this scoping review is to create an overview of digital 
tools published in scientific literature in the context of AD and dementia aimed 
at people without an AD or dementia diagnosis as primary end users interacting 
with these digital tools. Additionally, we aim to gain insight into study sample 
diversity, the stage of maturity and evaluation of these tools, and recommended 
future directions.
METHODS: PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Ovid, and Web of Science were searched in January 
2023, using terms related to AD and dementia, (pre-)disease stages, digital 
tools, and various purposes of digital tools. Two independent reviewers screened 
the titles and abstracts of 2811 records and subsequently 408 full-text 
articles, based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Articles on tools targeting 
those with an AD or dementia diagnosis were excluded. Data extraction included 
information on the sample characteristics, the digital tool, stage of maturity 
and evaluation, and future (research) directions.
RESULTS: We included 39 articles, which were aimed at primary prevention (14/39, 
36%), secondary prevention (11/39, 28%), daily life support (8/39, 21%), 
self-administered screening (4/39, 10%), or decision-making (2/39, 5%). 
Variation in the study sample emerged regarding cognitive abilities (healthy: 
11/39, 28%; mild cognitive impairment: 12/39, 31%; [subjective] cognitive 
impairment: 9/39, 23%; "no dementia": 1/39, 3%; and variation of cognitive 
abilities: 6/39, 15%). Less variation was found regarding sex (>50% female: 
27/39, 69%), education (>50% high education: 13/39, 33%), and age (>50% >60 y: 
23/39, 59%). Few articles reported on ethnicity (12/39, 31%) and digital 
literacy (11/39, 28%). Most tools were in an early evaluation and maturity stage 
(31/39, 80%), comprising preprototyping (1/35, 3%), prototyping (15/35, 43%), 
pilot testing (19/35, 54%), efficacy testing (18/40, 45%), usability testing 
(12/40, 30%), and feasibility testing (10/40, 25%). Future (research) directions 
comprised the need for further tool development, attention to diversity, and 
study advancements, such as large-scale longitudinal studies.
CONCLUSIONS: Almost 80% of tools as reported on in academic literature are in 
early development comprising early stages of maturity and evaluation. Studies 
and evidence gathered for digital tools developed in the context of AD or 
dementia aimed at people without an AD or dementia diagnosis are thus 
preliminary and further development, research, and policy are required before 
these tools can be implemented for assessing, supporting, and preventing 
cognitive decline.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and the 
most common cause of dementia. AD diagnosis often involves a thorough 
assessment, including clinical evaluation, cognitive testing, medical history 
examination, genetic testing, and biomarker analysis. Currently, the invasive 
nature and high costs of biomarker testing, such as cerebrospinal fluid analysis 
and neuroimaging, have limited the early detection and intervention of the 
disease. Therefore, researchers have explored cheaper and less invasive options, 
such as ocular imaging. This review discusses the close relationship between the 
eye and the central nervous system and ocular changes as a potential 
non-invasive AD biomarker. Ocular changes in AD have frequently been reported in 
the literature, particularly in the later stages of the disease. However, 
identifying biomarkers specifically attributable to AD remains a challenge. 
Additionally, this review provides a comprehensive overview of existing studies 
and highlights potential pathways for enhancing AD detection through ocular 
structural and functional evaluation. HIGHLIGHTS: Widespread screening for early 
detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is limited by cost and time constraints 
with current methods. Non-invasive and inexpensive methods are needed to 
overcome these difficulties. The eye is readily accessible and has shared 
developmental origins, neurobiology, and neurochemistry with the brain. The 
expanding field of ocular biomarker studies needs larger, well-characterized 
cohorts and longitudinal studies to understand the ocular changes for 
preclinical AD screening. Standards should be established for more methodical 
investigative approaches to identify ocular biomarkers that are specifically 
attributable to AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. This study 
investigated the roles of HOMER1, ATAD1, and miR-361 in AD pathogenesis using 
microarray (GSE106241, GSE157239; n = 60) and RT-PCR (n = 100; 50 AD patients, 
50 controls from Northwest Iran) analyses. Decreased expression of HOMER1 and 
ATAD1, key regulators of glutamatergic synapses, and miR-361, a potential 
regulator of both, was observed in AD brain tissue (GSE106241, categorized into 
seven Braak stages), suggesting a link between their dysregulation, impaired 
synaptic function, and increased neuroinflammation. However, blood-based RT-PCR 
showed no significant difference in HOMER1 or ATAD1. miR-361 was significantly 
lower in AD patients (adjusted p < 0.043). These findings, limited by sample 
size and lacking a formal power analysis, require further investigation to 
validate their potential as peripheral biomarkers for AD. Future studies with 
larger sample sizes are warranted.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with major 
symptoms including memory and learning deficits. Neuroinflammation associated 
with reactive microglia promotes AD progression. These reactive microglia 
secrete prostaglandins, which are synthesized through the enzymatic activity of 
cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2. Here, we aimed to elucidate the specific 
mechanisms of COX1 in AD pathogenesis and its interactions with 
neuroinflammatory processes.
METHODS: We conducted backcrossing between COX-1 knockout (KO) and 5 × FAD mice 
to evaluate the effect of COX-1 deficiency on neuroinflammation. In addition, 
single-cell sequencing and microarray datasets from public databases and 
ingenuity pathway analysis in vitro were employed to explore gene expression 
profiles in the brains of AD mice.
RESULTS: We identified a significant upregulation of COX-1 in 5 × FAD mice, with 
expression specifically localized to microglia in an age-dependent manner. 
Additionally, COX-1 KO alleviated neuroinflammation and accumulation of Aβ 
plaques, subsequently improving cognitive behavior in 5 × FAD mice. Moreover, 
microglia exhibited an amoeboid morphology in 5 × FAD mice, whereas in 
age-matched 5 × FAD/COX-1 KO mice, microglia had a ramified appearance. 
Additionally, our study demonstrated a pharmacological approach that inhibits 
the prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)/EP2 receptors via inhibition of the 
cAMP-PKA-NFκB-p65 pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome activation, producing similar 
beneficial effects as observed in COX-1 KO mice.
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that targeting the COX-1/PGE2/EP2 signaling 
pathway may alleviate neuroinflammation and impede AD progression. Moreover, the 
EP2 receptor presents a promising pharmacological target for mitigating the 
pathological effects associated with COX-1 activity in AD patients.

BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) is primarily based 
on clinical features. The main driver of DLB is alpha-synuclein-related 
pathology, but cerebrovascular disease (CVD) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) 
co-pathologies are often found in patients with DLB. Fluid biomarkers and 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide mechanistic and diagnostic 
information beyond clinical features. Therefore, the aim of this study was to 
investigate the association of plasma biomarkers (GFAP, NfL, Aβ42/40, pTau231, 
pTau181) with MRI markers of neurodegeneration and CVD in DLB and in patients 
with AD as a control group. We also evaluated the ability of biomarkers and 
clinical features to discriminate between DLB and AD.
METHODS: We included 134 patients from the European DLB consortium (DLB (n = 92) 
and AD (n = 43)) with plasma biomarkers determined with Simoa and MRI assessed 
with radiological scales for medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA), global cortical 
atrophy scale - frontal subscale (GCA-F), posterior atrophy (PA), and 
cerebrovascular disease (Fazekas scale). Associations between plasma and MRI 
biomarkers were assessed with the Mann-Whitney U test, and group differences and 
the discrimination between DLB and AD were assessed with ANCOVA, Random Forest, 
and ROC analyses.
RESULTS: In DLB, plasma concentrations of GFAP and NfL were associated with MTA, 
GCA-F, and Fazekas scale; and the Aβ42/40 ratio was associated with PA and 
Fazekas. Most of these associations were not statistically significant in AD. 
Individually, plasma and MRI biomarkers had a limited ability to discriminate 
DLB from AD. Plasma biomarkers helped increase the low specificity of core 
clinical features from 68% up to 79%, keeping the high sensitivity of 90%.
CONCLUSIONS: Plasma biomarkers of AD co-pathology, glial processes and 
unspecific neurodegeneration are associated with MRI biomarkers of atrophy and 
cerebrovascular disease in DLB patients. Plasma biomarkers increase the ability 
of core clinical features to discriminate between DLB and AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized 
by progressive decline of cognitive functions, yet its underlying aetiology 
remains elusive. While amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau pathologies have been extensively 
studied, emerging evidence suggests that metal and especially copper 
dyshomeostasis may also play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of AD. This 
review explores the intricate relationship between copper and AD, shedding light 
on the multifaceted mechanisms through which copper dysregulation contributes to 
neurodegeneration. We delve into the impact of copper ions on Aβ aggregation, 
tau phosphorylation, and oxidative stress, providing a comprehensive overview of 
the molecular pathways involved. Furthermore, we discuss the interplay between 
different brain cell types and the impact Cu dysregulation may have on them. The 
therapeutic implications of targeting copper dysregulation for AD treatment are 
also addressed, emphasizing the potential of copper-modulating agents in 
ameliorating cognitive decline. In summary, this review discusses copper 
dyshomeostasis as a central player in the intricate tapestry of AD pathology, 
offering new insights and avenues for therapeutic interventions.

Hemoglobin (Hb) is well known for transporting oxygen in the blood, but its role 
in the brain remains poorly understood. Here, we identified Hb in the cytosol, 
mitochondria, and nuclei of hippocampal and substantia nigra astrocytes and 
dopaminergic neurons. As a pseudoperoxidase, Hb decomposes hydrogen peroxide 
(H2O2) and mitigates H2O2-induced oxidative damage. However, in Alzheimer's 
disease, Parkinson's disease, and aging, excessive H2O2 diminishes astrocytic 
Hb, perpetuating a vicious cycle of oxidative stress and neurodegeneration. To 
counter the harmful effects of aberrant H2O2 production in diseases, we 
developed KDS12025, a BBB-permeable small molecule that enhances Hb 
pseudoperoxidase activity 100-fold, even at a low level of Hb. KDS12025 and its 
analogs achieve this enhancement through its electron-donating amine group, 
possibly stabilizing the complex between Hb, H2O2, and KDS12025. KDS12025 
reduces astrocytic H2O2, alleviates astrogliosis, normalizes Hb, and reverts to 
a virtuous cycle of redox balance, preventing neurodegeneration without altering 
the oxygen-transport function of Hb. Gene silencing of Hb abrogates the impact 
of KDS12025 in both culture and animal models, confirming the necessity of Hb 
for the effects of KDS12025. KDS12025 extends survival and improves motor 
function even in severe amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and aging. Furthermore, 
the enrichment of astrocytic Hb in the nucleolus highlights a novel 
antioxidative mechanism potentially protecting against nuclear oxidative damage. 
Our findings suggest that Hb is a new therapeutic target for neurodegenerative 
diseases, with KDS12025 emerging as a first-in-class approach that enhances Hb 
pseudoperoxidase activity to reduce H2O2. Increasing Hb pseudoperoxidase 
activity with KDS12025 mitigates oxidative stress and alleviates 
neurodegeneration in AD, PD, and ALS patients and increases the degree of aging, 
with broad applicability for numerous oxidative-stress-driven diseases.

BACKGROUND: Dementia is a major public health priority due to its increasing 
prevalence and the considerable burden it places on individuals living with the 
condition and their carers. Internet-based tools can help carers and the people 
they support to manage daily tasks, access resources and support, track health 
data, and connect with health care professionals. However, the benefits of these 
tools will only be realized if the intended users have access to the internet 
and are confident in its use.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the patterns of internet access and use 
among dementia carers in Australia and the people they support.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of carers providing informal support to a 
person diagnosed with dementia and living in the community was conducted. Carers 
were recruited through geriatric clinics, aged care providers, and community 
organizations between July 2018 and June 2020. Consenting carers self-completed 
a multitopic survey that included study-specific questions about their access to 
the internet, confidence using the internet, and whether the person with 
dementia they support was able to use the internet. Multivariate regression 
analysis identified sociodemographic factors associated with carers' internet 
access.
RESULTS: A total of 172 carers (consent rate 47%) with an average age of 71.8 
(SD 10.91) years completed the survey. Most carers (126/155, 81%) had access to 
the internet; however, 31% (47/153) reported they were not at all confident in 
using it. The likelihood of carers having access to the internet decreased with 
carers' age (OR [odds ratio] 0.87, 95% CI 0.80-0.96; P=.003). Male carers were 4 
times more likely to have internet access than female carers (OR 4.32, 95% CI 
1.00-18.6; P=.05). Similarly, carers with private health insurance (an indicator 
of individual socioeconomic status) were 8 times more likely to have internet 
access than those without private health insurance (OR 8.45, 95% CI 2.74-26; 
P<.001). Only 17% (29/166) of carers perceived that the person with dementia 
they support was able to use the internet independently or with assistance.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite high rates of internet access among carers, significant 
age, gender, and socioeconomic disparities were found, and a notable proportion 
lacked confidence in its use. Internet use among people with dementia was 
limited. The digital disparities identified in this study suggest that targeted 
training to build digital literacy to effectively use internet resources and 
co-design new technologies is needed. The findings further highlight that in 
this digital era, alternative methods to deliver dementia care and resources are 
essential to accommodate those who are unable to access or are less comfortable 
using the internet.

IMPORTANCE: Persons from marginalized racial and ethnic groups and of low 
socioeconomic status are at high risk of dementia but are underrepresented in 
clinical trials. Financial incentives may improve representation.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of financial incentives on enrollment of 
county health system patients into a memory concerns registry.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Between March 1, 2024, and April 24, 2024, 
patients 50 years and older without a dementia diagnosis within a single 
integrated county health system that includes a hospital and 9 outpatient health 
centers were invited to enroll in the Alzheimer Prevention Trials (APT) 
Webstudy, an online observational study aimed at accelerating enrollment into 
Alzheimer disease clinical trials.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to an invitation message (arm 1), 
a message with a small ($25) enrollment incentive (arm 2), or a message with an 
enrollment incentive of entry into a $2500 lottery with 1 in 100 odds of award 
(arm 3).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was enrollment, defined as APT 
Webstudy registration and completion of at least 1 of 2 remote cognitive 
assessments. Outcomes were measured through April 30, 2024.
RESULTS: Of 44 844 patients invited to the APT Webstudy, the mean (SD) age was 
64.7 (10.1) years, 25 447 (56.8%) were women, 25 044 (55.8%) had Medicaid 
insurance, 11 347 (25.3%) were Hispanic/Latino, 9526 (21.2%) were non-Hispanic 
Asian, 6044 (13.5%) were non-Hispanic Black, and 12 109 (27%) were non-Hispanic 
White. A total of 401 participants (0.9%) enrolled in the APT Webstudy. Relative 
to the message-only arm, participants randomized to the small incentive arm were 
more likely to enroll (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.39; 95% CI, 1.09-1.76; 
P = .008) in the APT Webstudy while those in the prize incentive arm were not 
more likely to enroll (adjusted OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.84-1.39; P > .99). 
Enrollment in the prize incentive arm was lower relative to the small incentive 
arm (adjusted OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.61-0.98; P = .04). Secondary heterogeneity 
analyses indicated that patients of White race (adjusted OR, 1.61; 95% CI, 
1.15-2.25; P = .006) and male sex (adjusted OR, 2.40; 95% CI, 1.55-3.75; 
P < .001) were most responsive to the small $25 incentive relative to the 
message-only arm.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, relative to 
message invitations, invitations with guaranteed, small financial incentives but 
not lottery incentives increased enrollment of economically but not necessarily 
racially or ethnically diverse participants to a study that aimed to increase 
enrollment in clinical studies.

S100β is a significant signaling molecule and biomarker that is primarily 
expressed in the brain. At low physiological concentrations, S100β induces 
astrocyte maturation, microglial migration, and neural proliferation. However, 
high concentrations activate inflammatory and pro-apoptotic pathways. Due to 
this dual role, increased research is being invested into the role of S100β in 
neuronal homeostasis and inflammation. In fact, increased S100β expression is 
seen in many neuropathologies including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's 
disease, cerebral ischemia, and traumatic brain injury. High S100β is generally 
associated with worsened disease outcome. Here, we provide an overview of the 
structure and role of S100β in various pathways, particularly in the context of 
neurological disorders. Modulation of S100β levels also holds promise as a 
therapeutic strategy. Micro-RNAs (miRNA) post-transcriptionally regulate gene 
expression and provide a novel approach reduce excess S100β protein. However, 
much of this research is still in its infancy. We outline current studies 
identifying miRNA in human and animal models of various neurological disorders. 
S100β itself has several predicted miRNA interactions although most have not yet 
been directly validated. Together, we compile the literature identifying S100β 
and miRNAs to guide future research in this field. We also comment on the 
feasibility and future uses of miRNA for pharmaceutical regulation of S100β, 
particularly for neurological treatments.

We tested the efficacy of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplementation on 
aggressive behavior among people with dementia. We used secondary data from a 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Analyses included 402 
individuals with dementia. We compared group differences in mean aggressive 
behavior change at baseline vs six (primary), 12, and 18 months (secondary 
outcome). We used independent samples t-tests with the aggressive behavior item 
from the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire. We stratified group 
differences by ApoE-ε4 status, gender, baseline aggressive behavior, and 
dementia severity. All tests favored DHA but no differences reached statistical 
significance. For example, the group differences between baseline and month 6 
aggressive behavior were 0.11 (p=0.22). Group differences nearly reached 
statistical significance with clinically important effect sizes when excluding 
participants without baseline aggressive behavior. Despite obtaining null 
results, these trends suggest avenues for future research that includes 
participants with higher baseline aggressive behavior levels and more sensitive 
outcome scales.

BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is considered a preclinical or 
prodromal stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD). MCI patients have an annual 
probability of progression to dementia of 10%-15%, far higher than the normal 
elderly (∼1%-2%). We conducted a network meta-analysis (NMA) on the efficacy of 
various exercise modes on MCI adults.
METHODS: A computer search was conducted in Embase, PubMed, the Cochrane 
Library, and Web of Science for RCTs on the effects of exercise training on MCI 
patients from their inception to February 22, 2025. Two reviewers were 
independently responsible for study screening, data extraction, and quality 
assessment. RevMan 5.4, Stata15, and R4.4.1 were utilized for data analysis.
RESULTS: Thirty-five studies with 2717 patients were included. The NMA results 
revealed that combination training (CT) performed best in increasing the MoCA 
and MMSE scores of MCI patients, with SUCRA of 99.43% and 87.04%, respectively. 
Resistance training and sensorimotor training were the second-best interventions 
for increasing MMSE and MoCA scores, respectively.
CONCLUSION: CT is the best intervention to improve MOCA and MMSE scores in 
patients with MCI, which can effectively alleviate the disease progression of 
MCI. However, a variety of double-blind, large-sample clinical trials are still 
needed to further verify this conclusion.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau 
pathologies that drive neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Free water (FW), 
a diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metric reflecting extracellular fluid changes, 
has emerged as a sensitive marker of neuroinflammation. This study examined the 
role of FW in AD and its associations with plasma biomarkers, brain structural 
measures, and cognitive decline. We analyzed 968 participants across the AD 
continuum from Samsung Medical Center. Plasma biomarkers were measured using 
Single Molecule Array technology. DTI metrics (FW, fractional anisotropy (FA), 
and mean diffusivity (MD)) and structural MRI-derived hippocampal volume and 
cortical thickness were assessed. Plasma phosphorylated tau 217 (pTau217) 
significantly correlated with FW in both white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM), 
but not with FA or MD. All DTI metrics were associated with reduced hippocampal 
volume and lower cortical thickness. Mediation analyses revealed that FW in WM 
and GM had both direct and indirect associations with cognitive decline, while 
FA and MD were indirectly linked to cognitive outcomes through structural 
measures. These findings support FW as a sensitive marker of neuroinflammation, 
linking microstructural changes to macrostructural changes and cognitive 
outcomes. Integrating plasma biomarkers, DTI, and MRI may improve understanding 
of AD pathophysiology and support the development of targeted diagnostic and 
therapeutic approaches.

BACKGROUND: Increasing life expectancy will lead to more people living with 
dementia (PLwD) and, consequently, more caregivers experiencing burden. 
Caregivers burden is influenced by characteristics of both PLwD and caregivers 
themselves, as well as healthcare services organisation. The COVID-19 pandemic 
and lockdown measures implemented in Italy worsened PLwD and their caregivers' 
well-being. Recognising the importance of understanding the profiles and care 
needs of PLwD and their caregivers, a national survey was conducted within the 
Italian Fund for Alzheimer's and Dementias to investigate the sociodemographic 
characteristics of PLwD caregivers and their care recipients in Italy. This 
study aimed to describe the characteristics of Italian caregivers of PLwD, their 
use of services, and satisfaction with the latter.
METHODS: A cross-sectional national survey was conducted. A self-administered 
questionnaire was developed consisting mainly of multiple-choice questions.
RESULTS: A total of 2369 caregivers participated in the survey. Most of them 
resided in Northern Italy (60.1%), were females (73.4%) and care recipients' 
children (74.1%). Median diagnostic delay ranged from 7 to 36 months. Diagnosis 
was formulated mainly by a physician from a Centre for Cognitive Disorders and 
Dementia. Caregiver training was poorly reported (34.1%). PLwD clinical 
condition worsened during the pandemic. The mean degree of satisfaction with 
services dedicated to dementia was "acceptable". Negative/very negative degree 
of satisfaction was associated with not living in the North, increased 
caregiver's age, not having received training, severe degree of disease, having 
received the diagnosis suspicion from a private doctor, and not having used day 
care centres or Centres for Cognitive Disorders and Dementia.
CONCLUSIONS: Differences in the sociodemographic profile of caregivers and 
disparity in services across Italy emerged. The establishment of a 
comprehensive, accessible, and well-integrated network of services across all 
stages of the disease progression is needed.

5,7-dimethoxyflavone (DMF) and 5,7,4'-trimethoxyflavone (TMF) are natural 
methoxyflavones known for their potential neuroprotective properties. This study 
investigates their mechanisms of action through in silico target predictions and 
memory-impaired mice. Ligand-based and proteochemometric models were used to 
predict potential protein targets, followed by molecular docking using PyRx and 
Discovery Video Visualiser. To validate these findings, DMF and TMF 
(10/20/40 mg/kg) were administered to LPS-induced mice for 21 days. Morris Water 
Maze (MWM) and Open Field Test (OFT) were conducted to assess cognitive 
functions. Expression levels of predicted targets were determined by RT-PCR, and 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was conducted to measure BDNF, Aβ, and 
pro-inflammatory markers. GABRA1, GABRG2, 5-HT2A, IGF1R, and 5-HT2C were 
predicted for DMF. Meanwhile, GABRG2, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C were predicted 
for TMF. Molecular docking showed DMF formed strong binding interactions with 
GABRA1 and GABRG2 (9.40 kcal/mol), interacting with His102 and Tyr160. 
Meanwhile, TMF formed strong binding interactions with 5-HT2A (- 9.30 kcal/mol) 
interacting with Ser242 and Ser159. TMF enhanced spatial memory in MWM, while 
both compounds reduced anxiety-related measures in OFT. DMF significantly 
upregulated hippocampal mRNA of GABRA1, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT2C, while TMF increased 
GABRG2, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C expression. Additionally, both compounds 
significantly reduced Aβ, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α levels, while DMF-treated 
groups significantly increased BDNF level. These findings suggest that DMF and 
TMF exert neuroprotective effects when administered prophylactically, acting 
through distinct molecular targets involved in neurotransmission and 
inflammation. Their multi-target activity makes them promising candidates for 
early intervention in Alzheimer's disease.

Periodontal diseases (PDs) are prevalent chronic inflammatory conditions linked 
to the progression of systemic disorders. Gingipains, cysteine proteases 
produced by Porphyromonas gingivalis, are key virulence factors involved in PD 
pathogenesis and host-tissue degradation. Inhibiting these enzymes has emerged 
as a promising therapeutic approach.
OBJECTIVE: This systematic review evaluates the potential of gingipain 
inhibitors in the management of PDs and related systemic conditions.
METHODS: A systematic search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, and Web of 
Science using the PICOS framework. Studies were evaluated based on their 
objectives, experimental models, inhibitor types, and outcomes.
RESULTS: Seven preclinical studies met the inclusion criteria. No clinical 
studies were identified. In preclinical models, gingipain inhibitors 
demonstrated consistent therapeutic benefits, including reduced inflammation, 
bacterial load, and tissue destruction in PDs, as well as improved outcomes in 
cardiovascular and AD models. Dual inhibitors targeting both Rgp and Kgp enzymes 
were more effective than single-target agents.
CONCLUSION: Gingipain inhibitors hold promise as therapeutic agents for PDs and 
associated systemic diseases. However, the absence of clinical studies 
highlights the need for further development and clinical evaluation to support 
their translational potential.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: By targeting specific and key components of host-bacterium 
interactions, gingipain inhibitors represent a promising adjunctive therapy for 
modulating periopathogen virulence factors, thereby mitigating the progression 
of PDs and associated systemic diseases.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is on the rise worldwide, consequently driving a 
growing demand for effective prevention and treatment strategies. Alamandine is 
a member of the renin-angiotensin system family. Although alamandine exhibits 
protective effects in the pathophysiology of various disorders, its role in AD 
remains an unexplored area. This research aims to elucidate the benefits and 
mechanisms of alamandine in an in vivo model of AD. The mice received 
intracerebroventricular injections of vehicle or alamandine once daily for 4 
weeks. The Morris water maze was conducted to assess spatial learning ability. 
Nissl staining was performed to evaluate neuronal injury. Important inflammation 
indictors were detected both by qRT-PCR and ELISA. Representative oxidative 
stress indicators and Fe2+ levels were measured using corresponding assay kits. 
Western blot was employed to detect the expression levels of the related 
proteins. We found that alamandine mitigates cognitive function and spatial 
learning impairment in APP/PS1 mice. Alamandine shows positive therapeutic 
effects by ameliorating the phosphorylation of tau proteins and suppressing 
neuroinflammation. In addition, alamandine mitigates the oxidative stress, 
ferroptosis and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) in the brain of APP/PS1 mice. 
Our research indicates that alamandine alleviates cognitive impairment in 
APP/PS1 mice and inhibits inflammation, oxidative stress, ferroptosis, and ERS. 
It may serve as a promising approach to alleviate symptoms and promote remission 
in AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and debilitating neurodegenerative 
disorder. β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and 
glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) contribute to Aβ plaque development, tau 
hyperphosphorylation, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuronal dysfunction in AD 
pathogenesis. This study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective potential of 
sabinene in an Aluminum chloride (AlCl3)-induced model of AD in male Wistar 
rats. Thirty male Wistar rats were randomly divided into six groups (n = 6 per 
group). Group I (control) received normal saline for 30 days. Groups II-V were 
administered only AlCl3 (100 mg/kg, orally) for 20 consecutive days to induce 
AD-like pathology, which was confirmed through behavioral assessments. Following 
induction, Group II (AD control) received 1% Tween 80; Group III (standard 
treatment) was administered rivastigmine (2.5 mg/kg); while Groups IV-VI 
received sabinene at doses of 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg, respectively, for 10 days 1 h 
prior to AlCl3. Behavioral evaluations were conducted on days 0, 20, and 31. On 
the 31st day, animals were sacrificed for biochemical and molecular analyses. In 
silico molecular docking studies revealed that sabinene exhibited a higher 
binding affinity towards AD-related targets (BACE1, GSK-3β, TACE, and AChE) 
compared to rivastigmine. In vivo, sabinene treatment significantly mitigated 
oxidative stress, restored antioxidant enzyme activities, reduced 
pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, AChE, BACE1, and GSK3β expression, and 
ameliorated histopathological alterations in the rat brain. Thus, sabinene 
exerts potent neuroprotective and disease-modifying effects in AlCl3-induced AD 
via AchE, BACE-1, and GSK3β Modulation.

BackgroundSeveral hypotheses suggest that type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a 
risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), and antidiabetic medications may 
influence cognitive function in these patients.ObjectiveThis study aims to 
provide a comprehensive evaluation of the impact of single and combination 
antidiabetic therapies on cognitive function in patients with both AD and 
T2DM.MethodsWe analyzed data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center 
(NACC), covering a 17-year period from June 2005 to August 2022. This study 
included 3234 patients with both AD and T2DM. After applying exclusion criteria, 
964 patients were analyzed using propensity score matching and a generalized 
linear mixed model. Patients were categorized based on their longitudinal use of 
oral antidiabetic medications.ResultsBased on the 964 patients' cohort, the 
study found that patients receiving metformin with sulfonylureas (RR = 1.105 
[1.022, 1.195], p = 0.013) and metformin with a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor 
(DPP-4i) (RR = 1.132 [1.021, 1.256], p = 0.019) experienced a significantly 
slower decline in MMSE scores over time when compared to patients receiving 
metformin with thiazolidinediones (TZD).ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that 
combination therapies involving metformin with sulfonylureas or DPP-4i are 
associated with a slower rate of cognitive decline compared to metformin with 
TZD in patients with AD and T2DM. These findings provide novel evidence for the 
long-term cognitive benefits of specific antidiabetic therapies and offer 
valuable insights for clinical decision-making in this dual-affected population.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to look for a correlation between personal 
resources, care burden and life satisfaction in carers of people with dementia 
of the Alzheimer type.
METHODS: The study involved 100 family and professional carers providing care 
for a person with dementia of the Alzheimer type. Carers answered survey 
questions and completed questionnaires: Orientation to Life Questionnaire - 
SOC-29, Generalised Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES), Social Support Questionnaire 
(F-SozU K-22), Depression Assessment Questionnaire (KPD), Perceived Stress 
Questionnaire (KPS), Involvement Evaluation Questionnaire (IEQ) and Satisfaction 
with Life Scale (SWLS).
RESULTS: Higher levels of a sense of satisfaction with life were observed in 
carers who had a higher education, were the sole carer of a person with the 
disease, and who spent less time providing care. Higher levels of available 
resources and a lower sense of care burden (fewer depressive symptoms, less 
involvement in care and less stress) were associated with a higher sense of life 
satisfaction. Depressiveness of carers and high levels of perceived stress 
reduce the level of satisfaction with life.
CONCLUSIONS: Personal resources play an important role among carers in reducing 
the burden and maintaining proper levels of life satisfaction. The proper 
management of the resources available to carers is important to counteract the 
negative consequences of caregiving.

Advances in the Synthetic Approaches to β‑Secretase (BACE-1) Inhibitors in 
Countering Alzheimer's: A Comprehensive Review.

Alzheimer's disease is a progressive, irreversible, neurodegenerative disease, 
i.e., characterized by the presence of amyloid plaques, hyperphosphorylated tau 
protein (hyper p-tau), neural damage, etc. β-amyloid precursor protein cleavage 
enzyme 1 (BACE-1) inhibition is a promising avenue for slowing AD progression. 
In a rate-limiting step, BACE-1 cleaves the amyloid precursor protein (APP) into 
soluble amyloid precursor protein β (sAPPβ) and a membrane-bound C-terminal 
fragment called C99. γ-secretase processes C99, resulting in neurotoxic amyloid 
β (Aβ). Selective and potent BACE-1 inhibitors offer promising therapeutic 
avenues for Alzheimer's disease. While BACE-1 inhibitors have shown significant 
assurance as potential treatments for Alzheimer's disease, many early compounds 
struggled to advance clinically due to poor brain penetration, limited 
selectivity, and unwanted side effects. Over the last two decades, substantial 
progress has been made in the development of BACE-1 inhibitors, leading to the 
emergence of diverse structural frameworks such as aminohydontoins, 
dihydropyridines, pyrimidines, and iminohydantoins, and fused heterocycles. This 
review provides an in-depth analysis of the synthetic strategies employed. It 
emphasizes the structure-activity relationship (SAR) trends that have guided 
their optimization and the crystal structure of the enzyme used in the 
inhibition study.

The spreading of MAPT/Tau pathology is closely associated with the progression 
of neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in Alzheimer disease and other 
tauopathies. A key event in this process is the rupture of endolysosomal 
vesicles following the intercellular transfer of MAPT/Tau aggregates, releasing 
the transferred MAPT/Tau species into the cytosol where they can promote the 
aggregation of endogenous MAPT/Tau. However, understanding of the cellular 
pathways involved in this process remains limited. In this study, we 
investigated cellular pathways that prevent endolysosomal vesicle rupture. We 
established a new C. elegans model of MAPT/Tau spreading by introducing an 
mCherry-labeled, disease-associated aggregation-prone fragment of human MAPT/Tau 
(F3ΔK281::mCh) into the six touch receptor neurons. F3ΔK281::mCh transgenic 
animals exhibited significant neurotoxicity and mechanosensory deficits due to 
the accumulation of this MAPT/Tau fragment. In addition, its intercellular 
transmission compromised the endolysosomal system in receiving hypodermal cells. 
Using this model, we conducted an unbiased genome-wide RNAi screen and 
identified 59 genes critical for maintaining endolysosomal integrity. GO-term 
analysis revealed an enrichment of genes related to the ESCRT complex, the 
ubiquitin-proteasome system, mRNA splicing, and fatty acid metabolism. Silencing 
of selected conserved genes exacerbated seeded MAPT/Tau aggregation in a human 
induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cortical neuron model and 
triggered endolysosomal rupture in HEK293T cells, confirming the crucial role of 
endolysosomal damage in seeded MAPT/Tau aggregation. Overall, this study 
discovered novel cellular pathways that safeguard endolysosomal integrity. These 
findings may guide the development of therapeutics that improve endolysosomal 
integrity to halt the progression of MAPT/Tau pathology.Abbreviations: AD:

Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology has been recently shown to accumulate in 
multiple brainstem nuclei in pre-cortical disease stages. However, the impact of 
neurotransmission alterations on brain atrophy and their genetic correlates in 
AD remain unexplored. This study investigated (1) associations between grey 
matter (GM) loss and uptake values of PET/SPECT ligands tracing concentration of 
multiple neurotransmitter receptors/transporters and pathways; (2) the impact of 
AD polygenic risk scores (AD-PRSs) on such associations along the AD continuum. 
T1-weighted MRI scans, genetic and clinical data were selected for 800 ADNI 
participants: 203 cognitively unimpaired older adults (CU), 442 with mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) and 155 with AD. JuSpace was used to calculate 
correlations between GM volume (GMV) and the concentration of several 
neurotransmitters. Two PRSs, with (AD-PRS) and without APOE (AD-PRSnoAPOE), were 
investigated as predictors of the strength of correlation between GMV and 
neurotransmitters in general linear models. In both patient groups, atrophy was 
negatively associated with serotoninergic and dopaminergic 
receptors/transporters. In the whole sample, both PRSs were associated with the 
strength of correlation between GMV and different serotonin receptors and 
fluorodopa uptake. The pattern of associations was replicated in participants 
with evidence of amyloid pathology. GM loss in AD may be particularly affected 
by the alterations in serotoninergic and in presynaptic dopaminergic activity 
that are known to influence functioning of medio-temporal and frontal cortices. 
Such alterations appear to be driven by higher AD-PRS values. Investigating 
further neurotransmitter-related neural alterations may help clarifying 
neuropathological changes in pre-clinical AD and response to treatments.

INTRODUCTION: We evaluated the potential cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical 
primary prevention screening and treatment program to avert the biological and 
clinical onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in cognitively unimpaired older 
adults.
METHODS: This hypothetical program would use an amyloid plaque-clearing antibody 
therapy monthly in the first six months and annually thereafter in cognitively 
unimpaired 55-79 year-old APOE4 carriers and 60-79 year-old non-carriers with a 
negative AD blood test (sensitivity and specificity of 0.9), averting the onset 
of moderately frequent neuritic amyloid plaques by 75 %. Lifetime hypothetical 
treatment outcomes were compared to natural history outcomes to estimate 
cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: The program would be cost-effective up to a per-dose price of $1173 in 
APOE4 carriers and $307 in non-carriers or a lifetime cost of $20,167 and $5146, 
respectively.
DISCUSSION: Primary AD prevention could be cost-effective in older adults, 
especially in those at higher risk. Our findings and assumptions need to be 
confirmed with actual data.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by cognitive decline and cholinergic dysfunction. Given the 
limitations of current acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase 
(BuChE) inhibitors, novel multi-target drug candidates are urgently needed. In 
this study, a series of DHEA-carbamate derivatives were rationally designed and 
synthesized to integrate cholinesterase inhibition with potential 
neuroprotective and pharmacokinetic advantages. The synthesized compounds were 
characterized via NMR and HRMS, and their inhibitory activities were determined 
by Ellman's method. While native DHEA displayed negligible cholinesterase 
inhibition (IC50 > 75 μM), carbamate derivatization significantly enhanced 
potency. D1 exhibited the highest AChE selectivity (IC50 = 0.09 μM, SI = 424), 
D8 showed the strongest BuChE inhibition (IC50 = 0.1 μM), and D9 emerged as a 
dual-action inhibitor (AChE IC50 = 0.15 μM; BuChE IC50 = 0.7 μM). Molecular 
docking supported the observed in vitro activities, particularly the binding 
affinity of D1 toward AChE (-9.2 kcal/mol). Beyond enzyme inhibition, the most 
potent compounds (D1, D8, D9) were evaluated for their ability to mitigate 
H2O2-induced cytotoxicity in HT-22 neuronal cells. D9 exhibited the strongest 
protective effect, restoring cell viability up to 78 %. Additionally, the 
antioxidant activities of D9 were confirmed through DPPH scavenging and ferrous 
chelation assays, where it again demonstrated superior activity. DNA and HSA 
interaction studies revealed favorable binding properties, suggesting genomic 
stability and prolonged systemic availability. ADMET predictions indicated 
desirable pharmacokinetic profiles, including blood-brain barrier permeability. 
These results highlight the therapeutic relevance of hybrid steroid-carbamate 
scaffolds that combine cholinesterase inhibition, antioxidant capacity, and 
cellular neuroprotection, offering a promising strategy for next-generation AD 
drug development.

In recent years, TLR4, as a key member of the TLRs family, has attracted 
increasing attention for its role in neuroimmune diseases. As a critical immune 
surveillance molecule, TLR4 is considered a promising target for the modulation 
of neuroimmune disorders. A growing body of research has confirmed that 
artemisinin and its derivatives, as natural immunomodulators, participate in the 
regulation of TLR signaling pathways-particularly showing a close relationship 
with TLR4 among the TLR family.Recent studies have revealed a novel dual 
regulatory effect of artemisinin and its derivatives on the TLR4 signaling 
pathway. These compounds can not only selectively modulate TLR4-mediated 
inflammatory signaling cascades, such as the NF-κB pathway, effectively 
suppressing the excessive activation of microglia, but also inhibit TLR4 
dimerization and endocytosis, thereby blocking downstream signal transduction 
and alleviating neuroinflammatory responses. This novel finding provides a 
molecular basis for targeting TLR4 in the treatment of neuroimmune diseases such 
as multiple sclerosis (MS) and Alzheimer's disease (AD).Moreover, as naturally 
derived TLR4 modulators, artemisinin and its derivatives show great potential as 
new lead compounds for targeted therapies in neuroimmune diseases, offering new 
avenues and strategies for treatment. Therefore, this review focuses on the 
molecular structural characteristics of artemisinin and its derivatives, and the 
TLR4-mediated signaling pathways. It explores their potential mechanisms of 
action in modulating neuroimmune disorders from multiple perspectives-including 
drug structural properties, molecular docking simulations, and target 
regulation. The objective is to identify safe and effective neuroimmune 
modulators from natural products and provide new research perspectives and 
strategies for the TLR4-targeted treatment of neuroimmune diseases.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by neuroinflammation, synaptic dysfunction and neuronal loss. 
Research has revealed a connection between copper metabolism and the 
pathophysiology of AD, particularly through a newly identified form of 
copper‑dependent cell death referred to as cuproptosis. Cuproptosis is driven by 
the aggregation of lipoylated proteins and proteotoxic stress caused by 
excessive copper accumulation, leading to cellular demise, which is a key event 
in AD. While studies on copper levels in the brain in AD remain inconclusive, 
there is mounting evidence suggesting that an imbalance in copper homeostasis, 
particularly elevated labile copper levels, contributes to oxidative damage and 
neurodegeneration in patients with AD. The present review examines the role of 
cuproptosis in AD and discusses how targeting this pathway may provide novel 
therapeutic opportunities. By investigating the underlying mechanisms and 
potential clinical implications, the present review highlights that regulation 
of cuproptosis provides a promising approach for modulating disease progression 
and developing personalized treatment strategies for AD.

20006, USA.

Intracellular calcium (Ca2+) levels are critical in maintaining cellular 
activities and are tightly regulated. Neuronal degeneration and regeneration 
rely on calcium-binding proteins. Calmodulin (CaM) is a calcium sensor and the 
primary regulator of receptors and ion channels that maintain calcium 
homeostasis. The calmodulin binding domains are present in proteins that serve 
as risk factors and biomarkers associated with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's 
disease, Huntington's disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and other 
neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting calmodulin ligands as emerging 
therapeutic targets for treatment. Inhibiting CaM to develop new therapies has 
drawbacks, as CaM is a ubiquitous molecule involved in many regulatory pathways. 
Recently, new strategies for disrupting CaM interactions with its targets have 
shown promising approaches to treatment. The structures of human CaM, its 
binding proteins, and inhibitors are well studied, with particular emphasis on 
the conservation of CaM amino acid sequences and the ability to bind protein 
fragments of high sequence variability, which exhibit common characteristics of 
amphipathic helices carrying basic amino acids. In this review, we discuss 
structural characteristics of CaM and its ligands in the context of 
transcriptional regulation. Specific binding of CaM to (1) basic 
region/helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper and (2) helix-turn-helix high mobility 
group box containing Sox families of transcription factors highlights common 
features of CaM binding sequences, which suggest their regulatory functions. We 
describe key proteins involved in neurodegeneration and transcription factors 
subject to calmodulin regulation that are candidates for the development of new 
approaches to treating neuronal diseases.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized 
by progressive cognitive decline and hallmark pathological features, such as 
amyloid-beta plaques and tau protein tangles. Despite substantial research, 
current therapeutic strategies remain primarily symptomatic, with limited 
success in preventing or reversing disease progression. One major challenge is 
the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB), which restricts the delivery of therapeutic 
agents to the brain. Nanotechnology provides innovative solutions to these 
challenges by enabling the development of targeted drug delivery systems 
tailored to AD's unique pathophysiology. Nanoparticles offer several advantages 
for AD therapy, including their small size, surface modifiability, and the 
ability to traverse the BBB. These carriers can enhance drug stability, prolong 
systemic circulation, and enable controlled drug release, reducing systemic 
toxicity while maximizing therapeutic efficacy. Among various approaches, 
nanoparticles functionalized with ligands targeting AD show promise in promoting 
the clearance of pathological aggregates, potentially slowing disease 
progression and alleviating neurotoxicity. Liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, 
dendrimers, and exosomes are notable nanocarriers that have been successfully 
engineered to deliver a range of therapeutic agents, including anti-amyloid 
drugs, neuroprotective compounds, and gene therapies. Recent advancements also 
emphasize stimulus-responsive nanocarriers that release drugs in response to 
specific pathological cues, further enhancing treatment precision. This article 
delves into the most recent advancements in nanotechnology for AD therapy, and 
the potential of these innovative systems to overcome long-standing barriers in 
AD treatment and paving the way for more effective and targeted interventions.

INTRODUCTION: JNK3 is a specific isoform of c-Jun N-terminal kinase, mainly 
found in the brain, and is highly sensitive to stress-associated signals in the 
central nervous system. It has been reported that JNK3 plays a crucial role in 
neurite formation and cognition. During pathological states such as Alzheimer's 
disease, cerebral ischemia, Traumatic brain injury (TBI), Parkinson's disease, 
and epilepsy, it is found to be in a hyperactivated form. Hyperphosphorylation 
of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and tau leads to toxic Aβ42 and 
neurofibrillary tangles. Excess Aβ activates JNK3 signaling, causing neuronal 
loss. JNK3 also contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction, Oxidative stress, 
neuroinflammation, and apoptosis, driving AD progression.
METHODS: This study aims to identify possible therapeutics based on their 
physicochemical, ADMET, toxicity, and drug-likeness properties. Moreover, we 
utilized Molecular docking and Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to reveal 
possible inhibitors against JNK3.
RESULTS: Based on the highest binding affinity against JNK3, the best compounds, 
Myricetin and Kaempferol, were subjected to an MD simulation study. RMSD 
analysis indicated that the JNK3- Kampferol complex showed more stability; at 
the same time, myricetin formed more hydrogen bonds with JNK3. Moreover, both 
compounds exhibited favorable ADMET properties.
DISCUSSION: This study identified Kaempferol and myricetin as potential 
inhibitors that target JNK3 through molecular docking and MD simulation studies. 
Both compounds demonstrated favorable ADMET profiles, supporting their promise 
as safe, orally available drug candidates.
CONCLUSION: Therefore, Kaempferol and myricetin emerge as promising candidates 
for further investigations in both in vitro and in vivo studies to treat 
Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders.

Tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), comprise microtubule-associated 
protein tau aggregates that cause neuronal cell death and clinical cognitive 
decline. Reducing overall tau abundance remains a central strategy for 
therapeutics; however, no disease-modifying treatment exists to date. One 
principal pathway for balancing cellular proteostasis includes the mechanistic 
target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling. Recently, arginine emerged as 
one of the primary amino acids to activate mTORC1 through several intracellular 
arginine sensors and an extracellular arginine receptor, namely the G 
protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family C, group 6, member A (GPRC6A). Human AD 
brains were previously reported with elevated mTORC1 signaling; however, it is 
unclear whether arginine sensing and signaling to mTORC1 plays a role in 
tauopathies. Herein, we examined arginine sensing associated with mTORC1 
signaling in the human AD and animal models of tauopathy. We found that human AD 
brains maintained elevated levels of arginine sensors with potential uncoupling 
of arginine sensing pathways. Furthermore, we observed increased GPRC6A and 
arginine in the brain, accompanied by increased mTORC1 signaling and decreased 
autophagy in a mouse model of tauopathy (Tau PS19). We also discovered that both 
supplementing arginine and overexpressing GPRC6A in cell culture models could 
independently activate mTORC1 and promote tau accumulation. In addition, we 
found that suppressing GPRC6A signaling by either genetic reduction or 
pharmacological antagonism reduced tau accumulation, phosphorylation, and 
oligomerization. Overall, these findings uncover the crucial role of arginine 
sensing pathways in deregulating mTORC1 signaling in tauopathies and identify 
GPRC6A as a promising target for future therapeutics in tauopathies and other 
proteinopathies. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Tauopathies, including Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), accumulate pathogenic tau protein inclusions that potentially 
contribute to the hyperactive mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) 
signaling and eventually cause neuronal cell death. Here, we presented novel 
findings that AD and animal models of tauopathy maintained increased expression 
of arginine sensors and uncoupling of arginine sensing associated with mTORC1 
signaling. We investigated the role of a putative extracellular arginine and 
basic L-amino acid sensing G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family C, group 6, 
member A (GPRC6A) in activating mTORC1 and accelerating pathogenic tau 
phenotypes in several cell models. Additionally, we showed that genetic 
repression or antagonism of GPRC6A signaling provides a novel therapeutic target 
for tauopathies and other proteinopathies.

Yanghuo Sanqi capsule (YSC) consists of Yingyanghuo (Epimedium brevicornu 
Maxim., YYH) and Sanqi (Panax notoginseng (Burk.) F.H.Chen, SQ), which is used 
to treat cardiovascular diseases in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). 
Additionally, the accumulated evidence suggests that it has the potential to 
treat Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study tries to elucidate the mechanisms of 
YSC against AD by combining network pharmacology of absorbed components with 
multi-omics of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). Firstly, network 
pharmacology was used to predict the target of the YSC in the treatment of AD. 
Then, Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) CL4176 and CL2355 were used to study 
the effect of YSC on AD, and the mechanism was studied through multi-omics. 
Finally, potential therapeutic targets and bioactivity ingredients were 
identified through validation experiments, molecular docking, and molecular 
dynamics simulation. The network pharmacology of 15 mice blood components 
suggested that YSC may intervene in AD by regulating lipid metabolism and 
amyloid precursor protein (APP). In addition, YSC can alleviate Aβ-induced 
toxicity in both muscle and nerve in C. elegans. Transcriptomic and metabolomic 
analysis in C. elegans showed that YSC protected against AD by increasing lipid 
metabolism, which can maintain lipid homeostasis inside and outside the cell and 
down-regulating APP to alleviate Aβ-induced toxicity. Anhydroicaritin (AHI) is 
an important bioactive ingredient involved in regulating APP error clipping and 
lipid metabolism in YSC. This study reveals the mechanism of YSC anti-AD and 
provides experimental support for expanding its clinical use.

Cibotium barometz (L.) J. Sm. (C. barometz), an ancient fern has a long history 
as a natural medicine in China, India, Vietnam, and other countries. In the 
traditional medical system, it is often used to treat bone pain, urinary system 
diseases, reproductive disorders, and so on. This paper aims to provide a 
comprehensive overview of current research on botany, traditional uses, 
phytochemistry, pharmacology, processing, and applications of C. barometz. In 
addition, resource conservation, quality control, and perspectives for future 
research on C. barometz are also discussed. Recent phytochemical studies of C. 
barometz have shown that over 100 compounds have been isolated from the plant, 
including phenylpropanoids, polyphenols, flavonoids, terpenoids, steroids, 
polysaccharides, and other compounds. Modern pharmacological studies have also 
confirmed that C. barometz has anti-osteoporosis activity, anti-microorganism 
activity, anti-osteoarthritis activity, anti-cancer activity, hepatoprotective 
activity, protective activity on muscle, alleviating Alzheimer's disease, and so 
on. As an important means of preclinical application, the type and content of 
the components contained in C. barometz changed significantly before and after 
processing, and the strength of its pharmacological activity also changed. 
Furthermore, it has many applications in the fields of compound preparations and 
biomedicine, which have great development potential. Nevertheless, there are 
also some research gaps in C. barometz. This review appeals for more studies on 
C. barometz to better understand its pharmacological mechanism and active 
substance basis. Besides, more research on resource conservation and quality 
control is also necessary to ensure its sustainable use and development.

Mirtazapine (MTZ) is a Food and Drug Administration-approved medication used 
primarily for the treatment of severe depression. It is a BCS class II drug 
having poor aqueous solubility (0.092 mg/mL), low oral bioavailability (50%), 
and high first-pass metabolism. This narrative review summarizes the ongoing 
research for the development of MTZ's novel formulations, keeping in view its 
physicochemical properties and its pharmacokinetic limitations. Owing to its 
novel pharmacodynamics, MTZ offers considerable potential for the management of 
various diseases, including schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's 
disease, epilepsy, post-traumatic stress disorder, diabetes, irritable bowel 
syndrome, and infertility, in addition to its widely established utility in 
depression. Nevertheless, the literature findings on the usage of MTZ in the 
aforementioned diseases remain contentious, which can be attributed to the 
inconsistencies in the research evidence and variable study outcomes. However, 
promising results of therapeutic effectiveness of MTZ against pruritus, 
cancer-induced nausea, emesis, and anorexia have been reported from preliminary 
investigations. Lastly, the present review provides a worthwhile overview of 
clinical trials and patents, which together put forward substantial evidence 
suggesting the potential repurposing of MTZ beyond from its use in depression, 
thereby accelerating advancements in drug delivery technologies.

Recent research reveals Formyl Peptide Receptor 2 (FPR2) as a relevant G 
Protein-Coupled Receptor involved in the resolution phase of inflammation. 
Therefore, FPR2 agonists are promising agents to tackle neuroinflammatory-based 
diseases, such as Alzheimer's Disease or Autism Spectrum Disorder. Here, we 
describe the synthesis and biological evaluation of novel FPR2 agonists designed 
through the bioisosteric replacement of the phenyl urea function in the potent 
FPR2 agonist 
(S)-1-(3-(4-cyanophenyl)-1-(indolin-1-yl)-1-oxopropan-2-yl)-3-(4-fluorophenyl)urea 
(5), obtaining novel heteroaryl, squaramide, and indolcarboxamide derivatives. 
The structural modification had a profound effect on FPR2 agonist potency, 
metabolic stability, aqueous solubility, and cell permeability, resulting in 
compounds with distinct profiles. Computational studies have shown that the new 
compounds exhibit the same contacts with key amino acids in the binding site as 
the starting FPR2 agonist 5. However, subtle differences in the orientation or 
the presence and position of heteroatoms in the selected scaffolds translate to 
substantial differences in FPR2 potency. Among the new compounds, (S)-9a, 
(S)-12a, and (S)-16b demonstrated neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and 
pro-resolving properties in mouse primary microglial cells, stimulated with 
lipopolysaccharide. Although the replacement of the phenyl urea with different 
scaffolds did not lead to the identification of a bioisostere, compounds (S)-9a, 
(S)-12a, and (S)-16b represent a starting point for the development of a new 
class of FPR2 agonists.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects over 50 million people worldwide and is the 
sixth leading cause of death in North America with no cure and limited 
disease-modifying therapies. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a 
potential therapeutic agent, as it promotes the survival and synaptic plasticity 
of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons in brain regions associated with 
cognitive and emotive decline in AD, and mice lacking BDNF exhibits hippocampal 
long-term potentiation (LTP) impairment, reversible with recombinant BDNF. 
However, the poor blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and pharmacokinetic 
properties of BDNF limit its clinical use. To address these limitations, a BDNF 
nanocarrier system is designed using a novel BBB-permeable terpolymer (TP). This 
terpolymer-based nanoparticle system (BDNF-TPN) with optimized physiochemical 
properties protects BDNF in circulation and enables sufficient neuronal delivery 
of BDNF and neuron survival following Aβ exposure in vitro. The biodistribution 
and safety of BDNF-TPN are evaluated via imaging, enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay, hematologic, clinical biochemical, immunotoxicity, and histology tests. 
Biomarker studies demonstrate BDNF-mediated neuroprotective signaling in an APP 
transgenic mouse model following intravenous injection of BDNF-TPN with reduced 
apoptosis and neuron inflammation and increased neuronal survival and synaptic 
plasticity. Improved hippocampal-dependent contextual learning in APP transgenic 
Alzheimer's mice is observed as determined by fear-conditioning assay following 
two months of weekly treatments.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the efficacy and safety of brexpiprazole for the treatment 
of agitation symptoms in clinically relevant subgroups of patients with dementia 
due to Alzheimer's disease.
METHODS: Data were pooled for brexpiprazole (2 or 3 mg/day) and placebo from two 
international, randomized, double-blind trials in adults with a clinical 
diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia with mild-to-severe cognitive dysfunction and 
with agitation (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT01862640, NCT03548584). 
Change in agitation frequency over 12 weeks was measured using the 
Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI). Safety measures included 
treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). In this post hoc analysis, thirteen 
clinically relevant subgroups were investigated based on care setting 
(institutionalized, non-institutionalized), severity of cognitive dysfunction 
(mild/moderate, severe), co-occurring behavioral symptoms (psychosis, 
depression, anxiety, irritability, sleep disturbance), and use of concomitant 
medications for dementia (acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, memantine) and 
psychiatric conditions (antidepressant, benzodiazepine).
RESULTS: In the randomized sample (N = 621), mean age was 74 years (range 
55-90 years), 344 (55.4%) participants were female, and 277 (44.6%) were male. 
Over 12 weeks, brexpiprazole showed numerically greater reduction in agitation 
frequency than placebo in 12 of 13 subgroups. The only exception was 
"concomitant benzodiazepines", which was a small subgroup (n = 71), but showed 
efficacy for brexpiprazole in secondary analyses. The largest differences in 
favor of brexpiprazole versus placebo were for the concomitant antidepressant, 
co-occurring sleep disorder, and co-occurring psychosis subgroups. The overall 
incidence of TEAEs was generally consistent across subgroups.
CONCLUSION: In these exploratory analyses, brexpiprazole reduced symptoms of 
agitation across a wide range of patients with agitation associated with 
dementia due to Alzheimer's disease.

Plain Language Summary: Alzheimer’s dementia is a brain disorder that affects a 
person’s thinking and memory. These symptoms gradually worsen over time. Many 
people with Alzheimer’s dementia also become agitated. Agitation may be 
movement-related (such as pacing around the room or rocking back and forth), 
verbal (such as shouting or swearing), or aggressive (such as shoving or hitting 
other people). Agitation symptoms are difficult to tolerate, and are often the 
reason that patients are moved from their own home into a nursing home. People 
with Alzheimer’s dementia and agitation may benefit from a medication called 
brexpiprazole. Brexpiprazole improved agitation in clinical trials, and the 
improvement was more than in patients who took a placebo (dummy drug). However, 
it is also important to determine if brexpiprazole can help patients in 
different personal situations. For example, patients may live at home or in a 
nursing home, may have differing dementia severity, may have additional 
behavioral or emotional changes besides agitation, and may be taking medications 
for other conditions. In this study, researchers used data from clinical trials 
to investigate if brexpiprazole can improve agitation symptoms in these 
different subgroups. Agitation was measured using a questionnaire in which 
caregivers were asked about 29 different types of agitation symptoms. The 
results showed that brexpiprazole reduced agitation more than placebo in almost 
all subgroups. There were no clear differences in side effects across the 
different subgroups. This means that brexpiprazole may help people with 
Alzheimer’s dementia with agitation across many different personal situations.

A blood biomarker-based staging system for Alzheimer's disease (AD) could 
improve the diagnosis, prognosis and identification of individuals most likely 
to benefit from specific therapies. Here, using targeted mass spectrometry, we 
measured six phosphorylated and six nonphosphorylated tau peptides in plasma 
from two independent cohorts: BioFINDER-2 and TRIAD (n = 689). We also analyzed 
the ratios of phosphorylated to nonphosphorylated peptides. Our results revealed 
that specific tau species became abnormal at different points along the disease 
continuum. Based on these findings, we developed a data-driven, blood-based 
staging model that demonstrated strong consistency across cohorts (>85% 
agreement in ≥90% initializations) and reflected changes in other AD biomarkers. 
These plasma-based stages were associated with clinical diagnoses, positron 
emission tomography-based stages and distinct patterns of longitudinal disease 
progression, including Aβ- and tau-positron emission tomography uptake, atrophy 
and cognitive decline. This study highlights the potential of tau blood-based 
biomarkers for biological staging in AD, offering a scalable tool for tracking 
disease progression and guiding clinical decisions.

Alzheimer's disease research is moving into a new era, yet significant questions 
remain about its underlying biological mechanisms. In this article, we consider 
how the field might refine the transfer of evidence between research cohorts 
focused on rare, genetically defined familial forms of dementia, clinical trial 
cohorts, highly selective of relatively younger people, with single 
neuropathologies and few co-morbidities, and the overall picture of the dementia 
syndrome in the whole population. We examine four key areas in which the 
evidence base must be improved: i) how 'disease' definitions apply across these 
three groups, ii) the precise molecular identification of the protein at the 
heart of current Alzheimer's research - amyloid beta protein, iii) the 
contributions of the full amyloid precursor protein proteolytic system and iv) 
how this complex proteolytic system relates to wider cellular systems. We 
describe how a cross-disciplinary approach based on the APP matrix framework, 
could allow a systematic investigation of new perspectives to inform 
translational research and precision medicine approaches. Addressing these gaps 
will give us the biological grounding needed to provide a sound underpinning to 
innovations in the field.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with 
increasing prevalence among the ageing population, necessitating early and 
accurate diagnosis for effective disease management. In this study, we present a 
novel hybrid deep learning framework, AlzhiNet, that integrates both 2D 
convolutional neural networks (2D-CNNs) and 3D convolutional neural networks 
(3D-CNNs), along with a custom loss function and volumetric data augmentation, 
to enhance feature extraction and improve classification performance in AD 
diagnosis. According to extensive experiments, AlzhiNet outperforms standalone 
2D and 3D models, highlighting the importance of combining these complementary 
representations of data. The depth and quality of 3D volumes derived from the 
augmented 2D slices also significantly influence the model's performance. The 
results indicate that carefully selecting weighting factors in hybrid 
predictions is imperative for achieving optimal results. Our framework has been 
validated on the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) from Kaggle and MIRIAD 
datasets, obtaining accuracies of 98.9% and 99.99%, respectively, with an AUC of 
100%. Furthermore, AlzhiNet was studied under a variety of perturbation 
scenarios on the Alzheimer's Kaggle dataset, including Gaussian noise, 
brightness, contrast, salt and pepper noise, color jitter, and occlusion. The 
results obtained show that AlzhiNet is more robust to perturbations than 
ResNet-18, making it an excellent choice for real-world applications. This 
approach represents a promising advancement in the early diagnosis and treatment 
planning for AD.

Age-related neurodegeneration is one of the primary causes associated with the 
pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Currently, there are 5.8 million cases 
of AD worldwide. With the advancement in technology, the paradigm of treating 
the disease has shifted from one treatment or diagnosis to simultaneously 
diagnosing as well as treating the disease. Excellent efforts have been made by 
the scientists towards the development of nanotheranostics. Among them, quantum 
dots (QDs) have shown promising results due to their nanometer size, which 
enables them to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and optical properties which 
help in imaging the environment/pathology inside the brain. Furthermore, their 
functionalization with the specific biomolecules or coupling with 
aptamers/proteins/peptides/antibodies offers site-specific detection of 
pathological biomarkers. The long-lasting, tunable, and strong fluorescence 
generated by them within the body helps in the selective detection of biomarkers 
at very low concentrations. This helps in the accurate and early diagnosis of 
AD. Their multiplexed sensing of multiple markers at a time due to the tunable 
property of their emission wavelengths, makes it a more specific and sensitive 
tool over microarray or other assays. Additionally, real-time tracking of drug 
delivery and parallel treatment of the disease at the targeted site make them a 
unique theranostic tool over other techniques. This review consolidates recent 
advances in QDs-based approaches, encompassing their physicochemical properties, 
blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration strategies, synthesis, and 
functionalization techniques. The roles in targeted drug delivery, bioimaging, 
and biomarker detection, as well as their intrinsic therapeutic actions, 
including inhibition of amyloid beta formation and tau aggregation, 
antioxidative effects, and neuroprotection, have also been discussed. Multiple 
preclinical studies demonstrate the ability of QDs to enhance drug stability, 
improve BBB transport, enable high-sensitivity imaging of AD biomarkers, and 
modulate neuroinflammatory responses.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder primarily 
characterized by Aβ deposition and tau hyperphosphorylation. Clinically, AD 
manifests as progressive episodic-memory loss that ultimately erodes global 
cognition and the ability to perform activities of daily living. Despite decades 
of investigation, the molecular underpinnings of AD remain incompletely 
understood and no disease-modifying therapies are available. Recently, 
disulfidptosis, a novel form of programmed cell death (PCD) caused by disulfide 
stress with high expression of SLC7A11 (solute carrier family 7 member 11) under 
glucose starvation conditions, has emerged as a potential contributor to 
neurodegeneration. This review systematically summarizes the discovery, 
molecular features, and regulatory mechanisms of disulfidptosis, and critically 
evaluates its relevance to AD pathogenesis. We show that disulfidptosis can 
directly or indirectly modulate pivotal disease pathways, including Aβ 
accumulation, tau hyper-phosphorylation, and oxidative stress, through 
interconnected molecular cascades. Furthermore, we also delved into its 
potential application prospects in AD treatment, including inhibiting SLC7A11 
activity, regulating NADPH (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate) levels, 
targeting actin cytoskeleton dynamics, and antioxidant therapy. By integrating 
disulfidptosis into the AD landscape for the first time, this review offers a 
novel mechanistic perspective and identifies actionable therapeutic targets, 
thereby laying the groundwork for precision strategies against 
disulfidptosis-driven neurodegeneration.

Eichhornia crassipes (Mart.) Solms, also known as Pontederia crassipes Mart, has 
traditionally been used for its sedative, antipsychotic, and memory-enhancing 
properties. However, its effects against Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain 
unexplored. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the in vitro anti-AD 
properties of methanol (MEECF), ethanol (EEECF), and ethyl acetate (EAEECF) 
extracts of E. crassipes flowers and to identify potential multi-modal anti-AD 
phytocompounds using computational drug discovery targeting acetylcholinesterase 
(AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), and beta-site amyloid precursor protein 
cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE-1). Initially, 204 phytocompounds were metabolically 
annotated through GC-MS analysis of the extracts, and their functional groups 
and chemical nature were identified using PPS and FT-IR analysis, respectively. 
Molecular docking identified two hit phytocompounds (CID 4970, fumarine, and CID 
106962, cyclopentanemethanamine, 5-amino-2,2,4-trimethyl-) in MEECF and EEECF, 
which exhibited higher binding affinities toward all targets compared to the 
control drug donepezil (-5.721 kcal/mol). Further molecular analysis revealed 
favorable pharmacokinetics, drug-likeness, and no toxicity for these two 
phytocompounds. Molecular dynamics simulation confirmed their binding stability 
to the active sites of AChE, BChE, and BACE-1, exhibiting multi-modal inhibitory 
activity. MEECF, EEECF, and EAEECF showed concentration-dependent antioxidant 
and AChE and BChE inhibition, supporting the in silico results regarding 
oxidative stress and cholinergic pathways. These findings suggest the anti-AD 
potential of E. crassipes flowers, with fumarine and cyclopentanemethanamine, 
5-amino-2, 2, 4-trimethyl- identified as multi-modal inhibitors of AChE, BChE, 
and BACE-1. However, further in vivo research is required to comprehensively 
evaluate their efficacy in combating AD.

antibodies at tracer dose.

BACKGROUND: Transferrin receptor (TfR)-mediated transcytosis is a 
well-established method for delivering biologic therapeutics and diagnostics to 
the brain. Although moderate affinity towards TfR is beneficial for TfR-mediated 
brain delivery at therapeutic doses, emerging evidence has indicated that high 
TfR affinity may be more beneficial at tracer doses. With the development of 
antibody-based PET radioligands for neurodegenerative diseases, such as 
Alzheimer's disease, understanding the pharmacokinetics of TfR-binders at tracer 
dose is essential. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of TfR affinity 
on brain uptake at a tracer dose in both wild-type (WT) and amyloid-beta (Aβ) 
pathology presenting mice and to demonstrate the usability of TfR-mediated brain 
delivery of immunoPET diagnostic radioligands to visualize intrabrain Aβ 
pathology in vivo.
METHODS: Three different affinity variants of anti-mouse TfR-binding antibody 
8D3, engineered by alanine point mutations, were selected. Bispecific antibodies 
were designed with knob-into-hole technology with one arm targeting TfR (8D3) 
and the other arm targeting human Aβ (bapineuzumab). Antibody affinities were 
measured in an in vitro cell assay. In vivo pharmacokinetic analyses of 
radioiodinated bispecific antibodies and bapineuzumab in brain, blood and 
peripheral organs were performed over 7 days post-injection in WT mice and a 
model of Aβ pathology (AppNL-G-F). The strongest TfR affinity bispecific 
antibody was also evaluated as a positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand 
for detecting Aβ pathology in WT and AppNL-G-F mice.
RESULTS: The three bispecific antibodies bound to TfR with affinities of 10 nM, 
20 nM and 240 nM. Independent of genotype, stronger TfR-affinity resulted in 
higher initial brain uptake. The two higher-affinity bispecific antibodies 
behaved similarly and differentiated between WT and AppNL-G-F mice earlier than 
the lowest affinity variant. Finally, the 10 nM bispecific antibody was able to 
clearly differentiate between WT and AppNL-G-F mice when used as a PET 
radioligand.
CONCLUSION: This study supports the hypothesis that stronger TfR affinity 
enhances brain uptake at a tracer dose. With the more effective detection of Aβ 
pathology, stronger TfR affinity is a crucial design feature for future 
bispecific immunoPET radioligands for intrabrain targets via TfR-mediated 
transcytosis.

NeuroFormer: A Deep Learning Framework for Alzheimer's Detection Using EEG 
Signals.

Lalawat RS, Kushwaha N, Bajaj V, Padhy PK.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, 
characterized by cognitive decline. Alongside AD, and Frontotemporal dementia 
(FTD) poses significant challenges in clinical diagnosis due to overlapping 
symptoms and heterogeneous pathological mechanisms. This overlap often 
complicates timely and accurate diagnosis, which is crucial for effective 
intervention and treatment planning. To address this, a novel deep learning 
architecture, NeuroFormer is proposed for the classification of EEG signals 
captured through non-invasive neurophysiological measurement instruments into 
three categories: AD, FTD, and healthy controls (CN). The model integrates 
spectral processing, neural oscillatory dynamics, hierarchical capsule routing, 
adaptive normalization, and attention-based feature fusion to effectively 
extract discriminative spatiotemporal features from raw EEG signals. Advanced 
mechanisms such as dynamic spectral gating and graph convolutions capture both 
local and global brain activity patterns, while a multi-scale adaptive feature 
pyramid enhances feature representation. A lightweight classifier decodes the 
learned features, achieving a classification accuracy of 95.76%, significantly 
outperforming benchmark models across all key evaluation metrics. These findings 
demonstrate the strong potential of NeuroFormer as a measurement-driven 
diagnostic framework for early and accurate classification of dementia-related 
disorders using EEG instrumentation.

BACKGROUND: Primary Lateral Sclerosis (PLS) is a rare, adult-onset 
neurodegenerative disease that predominantly affects upper motor neurons. 
Despite being considered mostly sporadic, familial cases and rare genetic 
variants in genes associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, hereditary 
spastic paraplegia and other neurological disorders have been reported in some 
PLS cases. Due to its rare prevalence among general population, large genetic 
studies of PLS are lacking.
METHODS: Fifty patients diagnosed with PLS based on consensus criteria were 
enrolled between 2013 and 2022 for comprehensive phenotypic and genotypic 
analysis using whole genome sequencing. We analyzed rare single nucleotide 
variants (SNVs), deemed pathogenic, likely pathogenic or of uncertain 
significance (VUS) based on the American College of Medical Genetics and 
Genomics criteria, and repeat expansions (REs) exceeding the pathogenic 
threshold, in 290 genes involved in neurological disorders.
RESULTS: We identified mutations in 7 patients (13.7%), specifically SNVs in 
CAPN1 (Spastic paraplegia 76), TBK1 (amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis/frontotemporal dementia, ALS4/FTD), LITAF (Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease 
1C), POLG (chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia), APP (Alzheimer's 
disease) and OPTN (ALS12 ± FTD), and one RE in ATXN8OS (spinocerebellar ataxia 
8). Additionally, two VUS were found in ANTXR2, a candidate gene for PLS 
recently identified via truncating variant collapsing analysis, but none of them 
was loss-of-function (one synonymous and one in-frame insertion).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates a notable genetic intersection between PLS 
and various neurological disorders, including motor neuron diseases, 
neuropathies, mitochondrial disorders, ataxias, and dementias. These findings 
underscore the relevance of further investigation in larger cohorts to fully 
elucidate PLS genetic architecture and highlight the need to reconsider the role 
of genetic testing in its diagnostic criteria.
