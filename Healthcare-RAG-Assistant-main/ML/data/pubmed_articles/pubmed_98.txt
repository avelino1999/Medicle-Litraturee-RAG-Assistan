PURPOSE: Current therapy strategies still provide only limited success in the 
treatment of glioblastoma, the most frequent primary brain tumor in adults. In 
addition to the characterization of the tumor microenvironment, global changes 
in the brain of patients with glioblastoma have been described. However, the 
impact and molecular signature of neuroinflammation distant of the primary tumor 
site have not yet been thoroughly elucidated.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We performed translocator protein (TSPO)-PET in patients 
with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (n = 41), astrocytoma WHO grade 2 (n = 7), and 
healthy controls (n = 20) and compared TSPO-PET signals of the non-lesion (i.e., 
contralateral) hemisphere. Back-translation into syngeneic SB28 glioblastoma 
mice was used to characterize Pet alterations on a cellular level. Ultimately, 
multiplex gene expression analyses served to profile immune cells in remote 
brain.
RESULTS: Our study revealed elevated TSPO-PET signals in contralateral 
hemispheres of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma compared to healthy 
controls. Contralateral TSPO was associated with persisting epileptic seizures 
and shorter overall survival independent of the tumor phenotype. 
Back-translation into syngeneic glioblastoma mice pinpointed myeloid cells as 
the predominant source of contralateral TSPO-PET signal increases and identified 
a complex immune signature characterized by myeloid cell activation and 
immunosuppression in distant brain regions.
CONCLUSIONS: Neuroinflammation within the contralateral hemisphere can be 
detected with TSPO-PET imaging and associates with poor outcome in patients with 
newly diagnosed glioblastoma. The molecular signature of remote 
neuroinflammation promotes the evaluation of immunomodulatory strategies in 
patients with detrimental whole brain inflammation as reflected by high TSPO 
expression.

INTRODUCTION: Antidiabetic drugs, reduction of carbohydrates intake, maintaining 
normal weight and physical activity are the cornerstone of diabetes 2 treatment.
METHODS: This opinion article is not intended to challenge hundreds of studies 
unequivocally demonstrating the benefits of a healthy lifestyle including 
appropriate diet in controlling the consequences of T2DM. The article questions 
whether the benefits of dietary restrictions for the management of T2D in older 
adults who are already demented, are worth the potential detrimental effects on 
quality of life for the patients and their caregivers, as well as the effects of 
dietary restrictions on frailty, sarcopenia.
DISCUSSION: However, the benefit of dietary restrictions including carbohydrates 
restrictions, might not manifest in elderly Alzheimer and vascular dementia 
patients with type 2 diabetes. On the contrary, such restrictions might hinder 
the patients' and caregiver's quality of life and encumber attempts to maintain 
normal weight in a population which tends to be underweight. Therefore, the 
benefit/risk ratio of dietary restriction should be weighed in this population 
on an individual basis.

There is a critical need to increase Latino participation in research on 
Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (ADRD). Applying principles of 
community-based participatory research, we convened a community advisory board 
(CAB) to identify barriers and recommend strategies to increase participation of 
older Latinos in a longitudinal observational research study of ADRD at the 
Shiley-Marcos Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. Six major barriers were 
identified and programmatic changes to overcome them were implemented. Changes 
resulted in a nearly three-fold increase in the number of Latino individuals 
recruited, with the proportion of all newly recruited participants who were 
Latino increasing from 12.2% to 57.4%. Newer Latino recruits were more 
representative of the elderly Latino population in San Diego County than those 
recruited pre-CAB and remained highly agreeable to blood draw and neuroimaging, 
though less so to lumbar puncture and autopsy. Results demonstrate the value of 
CAB involvement in enhancing diversity in ADRD research.

Author information:

AIM: To date, there is no reported effective biomarker that can predict which 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients will respond to donepezil and which will not. 
This study aimed to investigate whether baseline values of Aβ oligomers (AβOs), 
measured by the Multimer Detection System-Oligomeric Aβ (MDS-OAβ), can be used 
to predict responders after 6 months of donepezil medication.
METHODS: The study enrolled 104 patients diagnosed with probable AD. After 
6 months of donepezil medication, the response to treatment was evaluated by 
re-assessing the Korean version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (K-MMSE) 
and Clinical Dementia Rating scale-Sum of Box (CDR-SB) scales conducted at 
baseline. The patients were categorized into two groups according to the 
baseline MDS-OAβ values known as the cut-off for AD diagnosis: a group with 
values below 0.78 and another group with values equal to or above 0.78.
RESULTS: After 6 months of medication, the number of responders was 50 (49.5%). 
Responders exhibited significantly worse baseline CDR, CDR-SB, K-MMSE, and 
Barthel index compared with non-responders. There was a significantly higher 
number of responders among patients with MDS-OAβ values below the cut-off of 
0.78 compared with those with values equal to or above this threshold. 
Furthermore, there was a significant improvement in the K-MMSE and CDR-SB after 
6 months of donepezil medication in patients with MDS-OAβ values below 0.78 
compared with those with values equal to or above 0.78.
CONCLUSIONS: Baseline MDS-OAβ values might constitute a novel biochemical marker 
for the efficacy of 6 months of donepezil treatment in AD. Geriatr Gerontol Int

Catechins, a class of phytochemicals found in various fruits and tea leaves, 
have garnered attention for their diverse health-promoting properties, including 
their potential in combating neurodegenerative diseases. Among these catechins, 
(-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the most abundant polyphenol in green 
tea, has emerged as a promising therapeutic agent due to its potent antioxidant 
and anti-inflammatory effects. Chronic neuroinflammation and oxidative stress 
are key pathological mechanisms in neurodegenerative diseases such as 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). EGCG has neuroprotective 
efficacy due to scavenging free radicals, reducing oxidative stress and 
attenuating neuroinflammatory processes. This review discusses the molecular 
mechanisms of EGCG's anti-oxidative stress and chronic neuroinflammation, 
emphasizing its effects on autoimmune responses, neuroimmune system 
interactions, and focusing on the related effects on AD and PD. By elucidating 
EGCG's mechanisms of action and its impact on neurodegenerative processes, this 
review underscores the potential of EGCG as a therapeutic intervention for AD, 
PD, and possibly other neurodegenerative diseases. Overall, EGCG emerges as a 
promising natural compound for combating chronic neuroinflammation and oxidative 
stress, offering novel avenues for neuroprotective strategies in the treatment 
of neurodegenerative disorders.

The canonical AD pathological cascade posits that the accumulation of amyloid 
beta ( Aβ ) is the initiating event, accelerating the accumulation of tau in the 
entorhinal cortex (EC), which subsequently spreads into the neocortex. Here in a 
sample of over 1300 participants with multimodal imaging and genetic information 
we queried how genetic variation affects these stages of the AD cascade. We 
observed that females and APOE-ε4 homozygotes are more susceptible to the 
effects of Aβ on the primary accumulation of tau, with greater EC tau for a 
given level of Aβ . Furthermore, we observed for individuals who have rare risk 
variants in Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells 2 (TREM2) and/or 
APOE-ε4 homozygotes there was a greater spread of primary tau from the EC into 
the neocortex. These findings offer insights into the function of sex, APOE and 
microglia in AD progression, and have implications for determining personalised 
treatment with drugs targeting Aβ and tau.

Metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance and hypertension are potential 
risk factors for aging and neurodegenerative diseases. These conditions are 
reversed in Chromogranin A knockout (CgA-KO) mice. This study investigates the 
role of CgA in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD). CgA 
ablation in tauopathy mice (hTau) (CgA-KO/hTau) exhibited reduced tau 
aggregation, spreading, extended lifespan, and improved cognitive function. 
Transcriptomic and metabolite analysis of mouse cortices revealed altered 
alpha1-adrenergic receptors (Adra1) and high epinephrine (EPI) levels in hTau 
mice compared to WT mice, mirroring observations in AD and CBD patients. 
CgA-KO/hTau mice exhibited a reversal of EPI levels in the cortex and the 
expression of Adra1, nearly returning them to WT levels. Treatment of 
hippocampal slices with EPI or Adra1 agonist intensified, while an Adra1 
antagonist inhibited tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation. These findings 
highlight the interplay between the EPI-Adra signaling system and CgA in 
tauopathy.

Meibomian glands secrete lipid-rich meibum, which prevents tear evaporation. 
Aging-related Meibomian gland shrinkage may result in part from stem cell 
exhaustion and is associated with evaporative dry eye disease, a common 
condition lacking effective treatment. The identities and niche of Meibomian 
gland stem cells and the signals controlling their activity are poorly defined. 
Using snRNA-seq, in vivo lineage tracing, ex vivo live imaging, and genetic 
studies in mice, we identified markers for stem cell populations that maintain 
distinct regions of the gland and uncovered Hh signaling as a key regulator of 
stem cell proliferation. Consistent with this, human Meibomian gland carcinoma 
exhibited increased Hh signaling. Aged glands displayed decreased Hh and EGF 
signaling, deficient innervation, and loss of collagen I in niche fibroblasts, 
indicating that alterations in both glandular epithelial cells and their 
surrounding microenvironment contribute to age-related degeneration. These 
findings suggest new approaches to treat aging-associated Meibomian gland loss.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial neurological disorder that affects 
millions of people worldwide. Despite extensive research efforts, there are 
currently no effective disease-modifying therapeutics available for the complete 
cure of AD. In the current study, we have designed and synthesized a series of 
phenyl-styryl-pyrimidine derivatives as potential multifunctional agents against 
different targets of AD. The compounds were evaluated for their ability to 
inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE), monoamine oxidase (MAO) and β amyloid 
aggregation which are associated with the initiation and progression of the 
disease. Several compounds in the series exhibited potent inhibitory activity 
against AChE and MAO-B, with IC50 values in the low micromolar range. In 
particular, two compounds, BV-12 and BV-14, were found to exhibit a multipotent 
profile and showed non-competitive inhibition against MAO-B with IC50 values of 
4.93 ± 0.38 & 7.265 ± 0.82 μM, respectively and AChE inhibition with IC50 values 
of 7.265 and 9.291 μM, respectively. BV-12 and BV-14 also displayed β amyloid 
self-aggregation inhibition of 32.98% and 23.25%, respectively. Furthermore, 
molecular modelling studies revealed that BV-14 displayed a docking score of 
-11.20 kcal mol-1 with MAO-B & -6.767 kcal mol-1 with AChE, forming a stable 
complex with both proteins. It was concluded that phenyl-styryl-pyrimidine 
derivatives have the potential to be developed as multitarget directed ligands 
for the treatment of AD.

Protein-protein interactions, or PPIs, are a part of every biological activity 
and have been linked to a number of diseases, including cancer, infectious 
diseases, and neurological disorders. As such, targeting PPIs is considered a 
strategic and vital approach in the development of new medications. Nonetheless, 
the wide and flat contact interface makes it difficult to find small-molecule PP 
inhibitors. An alternative strategy would be to use the PPI interaction motifs 
as building blocks for the design of peptide-based inhibitors. Herein, we 
designed 12-mer peptide inhibitors to target p25-inducing-cyclin-dependent 
kinase (Cdk5) hyperregulation, a PPI that has been shown to perpetuate 
neuroinflammation, which is one of the major causal implications of 
neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, 
and frontotemporal dementia. We generated a library of 5 062 500 peptide 
combination sequences (PCS) derived from the interaction motif of Cdk5/p25 PP 
interface. The 20 amino acids were differentiated into six groups, namely, 
hydrophobic (aliphatic), aromatic, basic, acidic, unique, and polar uncharged, 
on the basis of their physiochemical properties. To preserve the interaction 
motif necessary for ideal binding, de novo modeling of all possible peptide 
sequence substitutions was considered. A set of filters, backed by the Support 
Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, was then used to create a shortlisted custom 
peptide library that met specific bioavailability, toxicity, and therapeutic 
relevance, leading to a refined library of 15 PCS. A greedy algorithm and 
coarse-grained force field were used to predict peptide structure and folding 
before subsequent modeling studies. Molecular docking was performed to estimate 
the relative binding affinities, and out of the top hits, Pep15 was subjected to 
molecular dynamics simulations and binding free-energy calculations in 
comparison to a known peptide inhibitor with experimental data (template 
peptide). Interestingly, the identified peptide through our protocol, Pep15, was 
found to show a significantly higher binding affinity than the reference 
template peptide (-48.10 ± 0.23 kcal/mol and -17.53 ± 0.27 kcal/mol, 
respectively). In comparison to the template peptide, Pep15 was found to possess 
a more compact and buried surface area, tighter binding landscape, and reduced 
conformational variability, leading to enhanced structural and kinetic stability 
of the Cdk5/p25 complex. Notably, both peptide inhibitors were found to have a 
minimal impact on the architectural integrity of the Cdk5/p25 secondary 
structure. Herein, we propose Pep15 as a novel and potentially disruptive 
peptide drug for Cdk5/p25-mediated neurodegenerative phenotypes that require 
further clinical investigation. The systematic protocol and findings of this 
report would serve as a valuable tool in the identification of critical PPI 
interface reactive residues, designing of analogs, and identification of more 
potent peptide-based PPI inhibitors.

BACKGROUND: The cholinergic neurotransmitter system is crucial to cognitive 
function, with the basal forebrain (BF) being particularly susceptible to 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. However, the interaction of white matter 
hyperintensities (WMH) in cholinergic pathways and BF atrophy without amyloid 
pathology remains poorly understood.
METHODS: We enrolled patients who underwent neuropsychological tests, magnetic 
resonance imaging, and 18F-florbetaben positron emission tomography due to 
cognitive impairment at the teaching university hospital from 2015 to 2022. 
Among these, we selected patients with negative amyloid scans and additionally 
excluded those with Parkinson's dementia that may be accompanied by BF atrophy. 
The WMH burden of cholinergic pathways was quantified by the Cholinergic 
Pathways Hyperintensities Scale (CHIPS) score, and categorized into tertile 
groups because the CHIPS score did not meet normal distribution. Segmentation of 
the BF on volumetric T1-weighted MRI was performed using FreeSurfer, then was 
normalized for total intracranial volume. Multivariable regression analysis was 
performed to investigate the association between BF volumes and CHIPS scores.
RESULTS: A total of 187 patients were enrolled. The median CHIPS score was 12 
[IQR 5.0; 24.0]. The BF volume of the highest CHIPS tertile group (mean ± SD, 
3.51 ± 0.49, CHIPSt3) was significantly decreased than those of the lower CHIPS 
tertile groups (3.75 ± 0.53, CHIPSt2; 3.83 ± 0.53, CHIPSt1; P = 0.02). In the 
univariable regression analysis, factors showing significant associations with 
the BF volume were the CHIPSt3 group, age, female, education, diabetes mellitus, 
smoking, previous stroke history, periventricular WMH, and cerebral microbleeds. 
In multivariable regression analysis, the CHIPSt3 group (standardized beta 
[βstd] = -0.25, P = 0.01), female (βstd = 0.20, P = 0.04), and diabetes mellitus 
(βstd = -0.22, P < 0.01) showed a significant association with the BF volume. 
Sensitivity analyses showed a negative correlation between CHIPS score and 
normalized BF volume, regardless of WMH severity.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified a significant correlation between strategic WMH 
burden in the cholinergic pathway and BF atrophy independently of amyloid 
positivity and WMH severity. These results suggest a mechanism of cholinergic 
neuronal loss through the dying-back phenomenon and provide a rationale that 
strategic WMH assessment may help identify target groups that may benefit from 
acetylcholinesterase inhibitor treatment.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in older adults, and 
the need for effective, sustainable therapeutic targets is imperative. The 
complement pathway has been proposed as a therapeutic target. C5aR1 inhibition 
reduces plaque load, gliosis, and memory deficits in animal models, however, the 
cellular bases underlying this neuroprotection were unclear. Here, we show that 
the C5aR1 antagonist PMX205 improves outcomes in the Arctic48 mouse model of AD. 
A combination of single cell and single nucleus RNA-seq analysis of hippocampi 
derived from males and females identified neurotoxic disease-associated 
microglia clusters in Arctic mice that are C5aR1-dependent, while microglial 
genes associated with synapse organization and transmission and learning were 
overrepresented in PMX205-treated mice. PMX205 also reduced neurotoxic astrocyte 
gene expression, but clusters associated with protective responses to injury 
were unchanged. C5aR1 inhibition promoted mRNA-predicted signaling pathways 
between brain cell types associated with cell growth and repair, while 
suppressing inflammatory pathways. Finally, although hippocampal plaque load was 
unaffected, PMX205 prevented deficits in short-term memory in female Arctic 
mice. In conclusion, C5aR1 inhibition prevents cognitive loss, limits 
detrimental glial polarization while permitting neuroprotective responses, as 
well as leaving most protective functions of complement intact, making C5aR1 
antagonism an attractive therapeutic strategy for AD.

BACKGROUND: Depression among older adults is a pressing public health concern, 
necessitating accurate assessment tools. The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) 
offers a brief and efficient means of screening depressive symptoms, yet its 
performance across ethno-racial groups remains understudied. This study aimed to 
compare the ability of various brief forms of the GDS to detect depressive 
symptoms and to assess potential ethno-racial differences in symptom endorsement 
among White, Black/African-American, and American Indian/Alaska Native older 
adults.
METHODS: Data were obtained from the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research 
Center (ADRC) clinical cohort, comprising 555 cognitively healthy individuals at 
risk for dementia. We used participants' baseline data for this cross-sectional 
analysis. Depressive symptoms were assessed using multiple brief forms of the 
GDS, derived from a systematic review and meta-analysis. We examined internal 
consistency and correlations with global Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scores. 
We conducted Kruskal-Wallis tests and post hoc pairwise comparisons to assess 
ethno-racial group differences in symptom endorsement.
RESULTS: Descriptive statistics revealed a predominance of female and White 
participants, with notable representation from Black and American Indian/Alaska 
Native groups. All GDS versions demonstrated moderate to high internal 
consistency. Significant positive correlations were observed between GDS scores 
and global CDR scores. Ethno-racial group differences in depressive symptom 
endorsement were evident, with Black participants consistently reporting higher 
levels of symptoms across most GDS versions. However, American Indian/Alaska 
Native participants endorsed significantly fewer symptoms than Black 
participants in one GDS version.
CONCLUSION: The study highlights the importance of considering ethno-racial 
differences in depressive symptomatology when assessing older adults. While the 
GDS demonstrates overall reliability, variations in symptom endorsement across 
different ethno-racial groups underscore the need for culturally sensitive 
assessment tools and interventions. Future research should further explore these 
group differences and develop tailored approaches to depression screening and 
treatment in diverse older adult populations.

CD2-Associated protein (CD2AP) is a candidate susceptibility gene for 
Alzheimer's disease, but its role in the mammalian central nervous system 
remains largely unknown. We show that CD2AP protein is broadly expressed in the 
adult mouse brain, including within cortical and hippocampal neurons, where it 
is detected at pre-synaptic terminals. Deletion of Cd2ap altered dendritic 
branching and spine density, and impaired ubiquitin-proteasome system activity. 
Moreover, in mice harboring either one or two copies of a germline Cd2ap null 
allele, we noted increased paired-pulse facilitation at hippocampal 
Schaffer-collateral synapses, consistent with a haploinsufficient requirement 
for pre-synaptic release. Whereas conditional Cd2ap knockout in the brain 
revealed no gross behavioral deficits in either 3.5- or 12-month-old mice, Cd2ap 
heterozygous mice demonstrated subtle impairments in discrimination learning 
using a touchscreen task. Based on unbiased proteomics, partial or complete loss 
of Cd2ap triggered perturbation of proteins with roles in protein folding, lipid 
metabolism, proteostasis, and synaptic function. Overall, our results reveal 
conserved, dose-sensitive requirements for CD2AP in the maintenance of neuronal 
structure and function, including synaptic homeostasis and plasticity, and 
inform our understanding of possible cell-type specific mechanisms in 
Alzheimer's Disease.

OBJECTIVES: To discuss the social, psychological, and access barriers that 
inhibit weight loss, and to propose steps and initiatives for addressing the 
growing obesity epidemic.
STUDY DESIGN: Narrative review of the obesity epidemic in the US and associated 
racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities.
METHODS: An internet search of relevant studies and government reports was 
conducted.
RESULTS: Obesity is a significant health crisis affecting more than 123 million 
adults and children/adolescents in the US. An estimated 1 in 5 deaths in Black 
and White individuals aged 40 to 85 years in the US is attributable to obesity. 
Obesity puts individuals at elevated risk for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular 
disease, chronic kidney disease, gastrointestinal disorders, nonalcoholic fatty 
liver disease, cancer, respiratory ailments, dementia/Alzheimer disease, and 
other disorders. In the US, significantly more Black (49.9%) and Hispanic 
(45.6%) individuals are affected by obesity than White (41.4%) and Asian (16.1%) 
individuals. Health care costs for obesity account for more than $260 billion of 
annual US health care spending-more than 50% greater in excess annual medical 
costs per person than individuals with normal weight.
CONCLUSIONS: Addressing the obesity epidemic will require a multifaceted 
approach that focuses on prevention, treatment, and reducing the impact of 
stigma. Continued advocacy and education efforts are necessary to make progress 
and improve the health and well-being of individuals affected by obesity.

Exercise increases peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 
1-alpha (PGC-1α) expression, which in turn causes the fibronectin type III 
domain containing 5 (FNDC5) protein to be produced. This protein is then 
cleaved, primarily in skeletal muscle fibers, to produce irisin. When the mature 
FNDC5 is cleaved by proteases, Irisin - which is the fibronectin III domain 
without the signal sequence - is released. Resistance, aerobic, and 
high-intensity interval training (HIIT) are recognized as forms of physical 
exercise that raise irisin levels, and insulin receptor phosphorylation in 
tyrosine residues, favoring an increase in the activity of the insulin-dependent 
pathway (PI3K pathway) and assisting in the fight against insulin resistance, 
inflammation, and cognitive decline. Irisin may represent a promising option for 
the therapeutic targeting in several brain-related pathological conditions, like 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), epilepsy, type 2 diabetes, 
and obesity. Exercise protocols are healthy and inexpensive interventions that 
can help find cellular and molecular changes in several brain-related 
pathological conditions. Here, it was reviewed what is known about 
exercise-produced irisin studies involving AD, PD, epilepsy, type 2 diabetes, 
and obesity.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder marked by the 
gradual deterioration of dopaminergic neurons, especially in the substantia 
nigra pars compacta (SNc). Dysregulation of the transcription factor FoxO1 is 
associated with various neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer's 
disease and PD, though the specific mechanisms involved are not fully 
understood. This study explores the effects of α-Synuclein preformed fibrils 
(PFF) on BV-2 microglial cells, focusing on changes in molecular characteristics 
and their impact on neuronal degeneration. Our results demonstrate that PFF 
treatment significantly increases FoxO1 mRNA (p = 0.0443) and protein 
(p = 0.0216) levels, leading to its nuclear translocation (p = 0.0142) and 
enhanced expression of genes involved in the detoxification of reactive oxygen 
species (ROS), such as Catalase (Cat, p = 0.0249) and superoxide dismutase 2 
(Sod2, p = 0.0313). Furthermore, we observed that PFF treatment elevates 
mitochondrial ROS levels. However, cells lacking FoxO1 or treated with FoxO1 
inhibitors showed increased vulnerability to PFF-induced ROS, attributed to 
reduced expression of ROS detoxifying enzymes Cat and Sod2 (p < 0.0001). Besides 
enhancing ROS production, inhibiting FoxO1 also heightens neurotoxicity induced 
by PFF treatment in microglia-conditioned medium (p < 0.0001). Conversely, 
treatment with N-acetylcysteine or bacterial superoxide dismutase A mitigated 
the ROS increase induced by PFF (p < 0.0001). These findings suggest the 
essential role of FoxO1 in regulating ROS levels, which helps alleviate 
pathology in PFF-induced PD models. Our study provides insights into the genetic 
mechanisms of PD and suggests potential pathways for developing novel 
therapeutic strategies.

Preclinical and clinical studies have indicated that compromised blood-brain 
barrier (BBB) function contributes to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. BBB 
breakdown ranged from mild disruption of tight junctions (TJs) with increased 
BBB permeability to chronic integrity loss, affecting transport across the BBB, 
reducing brain perfusion, and triggering inflammatory responses. We recently 
developed a high-throughput screening (HTS) assay to identify hit compounds that 
enhance the function of a cell-based BBB model. The HTS screen identified 
(S,E)-2-acetyl-6-[3-(4'-fluorobiphenyl-4-yl)acryloyl]-3,7,9-trihydroxy-8,9b-dimethyldibenzo-[b,d]furan-1(9bH)-one 
(4-FPBUA), a semisynthetic analogue of naturally occurring usnic acid, which 
protected the in vitro model against Aβ toxicity. Usnic acid is a lichen-derived 
secondary metabolite with a unique dibenzofuran skeleton that is commonly found 
in lichenized fungi of the genera Usnea. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the 
effect of 4-FPBUA in vitro on the cell-based BBB model function and its in vivo 
ability to rectify BBB function and reduce brain Aβ in two AD mouse models, 
namely, 5xFAD and TgSwDI. Our findings demonstrated that 4-FPBUA enhanced 
cell-based BBB function, increased Aβ transport across the monolayer, and 
reversed BBB breakdown in vivo by enhancing autophagy as an mTOR inhibitor. 
Induced autophagy was associated with a significant reduction in Aβ accumulation 
and related pathologies and improved memory function. These results underscore 
the potential of 4-FPBUA as a candidate for further preclinical exploration to 
better understand its mechanisms of action and to optimize dosing strategies. 
Continued research may also elucidate additional pathways through which 4-FPBUA 
contributed to the amelioration of BBB dysfunction in AD. Collectively, our 
findings supported the development of 4-FPBUA as a therapeutic agent against AD.

Comment on
    The Alzheimer’s disease-linked protease BACE2 cleaves VEGFR3 and modulates 
its signaling.

Production, aggregation, and clearance of the amyloid β peptide (Aβ) are 
important processes governing the initial pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). Inhibition of β-site amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleaving enzyme 
(BACE1) (one of two key proteases responsible for Aβ production) as an 
AD-therapeutic approach so far has failed to yield a successful drug. BACE1 and 
its homologue BACE2 are frequently inhibited by the same inhibitors. Several 
genetic and cerebral organoid modeling studies suggest that BACE2 has 
dose-dependent AD-suppressing activity, which makes its unwanted inhibition 
potentially counterproductive for AD treatment. The in vivo effects of an 
unwanted cross inhibition of BACE2 have so far been impossible to monitor 
because of the lack of an easily accessible pharmacodynamic marker specific for 
BACE2 cleavage. In this issue of the JCI, work led by Stefan F. Lichtenthaler 
identifies soluble VEGFR3 (sVEGFR3) as a pharmacodynamic plasma marker for BACE2 
activity not shared with BACE1.

Comment on
    SLC44A2 regulates vascular smooth muscle cell phenotypic switching and 
aortic aneurysm.

The phenotypic switch of vascular smooth cells (VSMCs) from a contractile to a 
synthetic state is associated with the development and progression of aortic 
aneurysm (AA). However, the mechanism underlying this process remains unclear. 
In this issue of the JCI, Song et al. identified SLC44A2 as a regulator of the 
phenotypic switch in VSMCs. Inhibition of SLC44A2 facilitated the switch to the 
synthetic state, contributing to the development of AA. Mechanistically, SLC44A2 
interacted with NRP1 and ITGB3 to activate the TGF-β/SMAD signaling pathway, 
resulting in VSMCs with a contractile phenotype. Furthermore, VSMC-specific 
SLC44A2 overexpression by genetic or pharmacological manipulation reduced AA in 
mouse models. These findings suggest the potential of targeting the SLC44A2 
signaling pathway for AA prevention and treatment.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease in the 
central nervous system, characterized by memory and cognitive dysfunction. 
Acupuncture is an effective means to alleviate the symptoms of AD. Recent 
studies have shown that microglia play an important role in the occurrence and 
development of AD. Acupuncture can regulate the activity of microglia, inhibit 
neuroinflammation, regulate phagocytosis, and clear Aβ Pathological products 
such as plaque can protect nerve cells and improve cognitive function in AD 
patients. This article summarizes the relationship between microglia and AD, as 
well as the research progress in the mechanism of acupuncture regulating 
microglia in the treatment of AD. The mechanism of acupuncture regulating 
microglia in the treatment of AD is mainly reviewed from two aspects: inhibiting 
neuroinflammatory activity and regulating phagocytic function.

INTRODUCTION: The approved amyloid antibodies for early Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
carry a boxed warning about the risk of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities 
(ARIAs) that are highest in apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4/ε4 homozygotes. 
ALZ-801/valiltramiprosate, an oral brain-penetrant amyloid beta oligomer 
inhibitor is being evaluated in APOE ε4/ε4 homozygotes with early AD.
METHODS: This Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 78-week 
study of ALZ-801 administered as 265 mg twice per day tablets, enrolled 50- to 
80-year-old homozygotes with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) ≥ 22 and 
Clinical Dementia Rating-Global Score 0.5 or 1.0. The study is powered to detect 
a 2.0 to 2.5 drug-placebo difference on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale 
13-item Cognitive subscale primary outcome with 150 subjects/arm. The key 
secondary outcomes are Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes and Instrumental 
Activities of Daily Living; volumetric magnetic resonance imaging and fluid 
biomarkers are additional outcomes.
RESULTS: The APOLLOE4 Phase 3 trial enrolled 325 subjects with a mean age of 69 
years, 51% female, MMSE 25.6, and 65% mild cognitive impairment. Topline results 
are expected in 2024.
DISCUSSION: APOLLOE4 is the first disease-modification AD trial focused on APOE 
ε4/ε4 homozygotes. Oral ALZ-801 has the potential to be the first effective and 
safe anti-amyloid treatment for the high-risk APOE ε4/ε4 population.
HIGHLIGHTS: The APOLLOE4 Phase 3, placebo-controlled, 78-week study is designed 
to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ALZ-801 265 mg twice per day in early 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects with the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4/ε4 
genotype.The enrolled early AD population (N = 325) has 51% females, a mean age 
= 69 years, and a mean Mini-Mental State Examination = 25.6, with the majority 
being mild cognitive impairment subjects, a similar disease stage to the 
lecanemab Phase 3 AD trial (Clarity AD).The primary outcome is the cognitive 
Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale 13-item Cognitive subscale, with two 
functional measures as key secondary outcomes (Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of 
Boxes, Amsterdam-Instrumental Activities of Daily Living), and with hippocampal 
volume and fluid biomarkers as additional outcomes.The study is unique in 
allowing a large number of microhemorrhages or siderosis at baseline magnetic 
resonance imaging, lesions that indicate concomitant cerebral amyloid angiopathy 
(CAA).At baseline, 32% of the enrolled population had at least 1 
microhemorrhage, 24% had 1 to 4, and 8% had > 4 microhemorrhages; 10% had at 
least 1 siderosis lesion; with more males than females having microhemorrhages 
(63% vs. 37%) and siderosis (68% vs. 32%).Study results will become available in 
the second half of 2024 and, if positive, ALZ-801 may become the first oral drug 
to demonstrate a favorable benefit/risk profile in APOE ε4/ε4 AD subjects.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Including women of childbearing age in a clinical trial makes 
it necessary to consider two factors from a bioethical perspective: first, the 
lack of knowledge about the potential teratogenic effects of an investigational 
product, and also, the principle of justice not to exclude any population from 
the benefits of research. The most common way to address this issue is by 
requiring volunteers to use contraceptives before, during, and a few weeks after 
the clinical trial. This work presents all the strategies used to promote 
contraception use and prevent pregnancy during the Alzheimer's Prevention 
Initiative Autosomal-Dominant Alzheimer's Disease (API ADAD) Colombia clinical 
trial. Two characteristics of this trial make it of special interest for closely 
monitoring contraception use. One is that the trial lasted more than 7 years, 
and the other is that participants could be carriers of the E280A PSEN1 
mutation, leading to a mild cognitive impairment as early as their late 30s.
METHODS: An individual medical evaluation to select the contraception method 
that best fits the volunteer was carried out during the screening visit, 
remitting to the gynecologist when necessary. All non-surgical contraception 
methods were supplied by the sponsor. Staff were trained on contraception 
counseling, correctly dispensing contraceptive drugs to volunteers, and 
identifying, reporting, and following up on pregnancies. Two comprehensive 
educational campaigns on contraception use were performed, and the intervention 
included all volunteers. In addition, volunteers were asked on an annual survey 
to evaluate the dispensing procedure. Finally, the effectiveness of these 
strategies was retrospectively evaluated, comparing by extrapolation the number 
of pregnancies presented throughout the trial with the General Fertility Rate in 
Colombia.
RESULTS: A total of 159 female volunteers were recruited. All strategies were 
implemented as planned, even during the COVID-19 contingency. Ten pregnancies 
occurred during the evaluation period (2015-2021). Two were planned; the rest 
were associated with a potential therapeutic failure or incorrect use of 
contraceptive methods for a contraceptive failure of 0.49% per year. Sixty 
percent of pregnancies led to an abortion, either miscarriage or therapeutic 
abortion. However, there was not enough data to associate the pregnancy outcome 
with the administration of the investigational product. Finally, we observed a 
lower fertility rate in women participating in the trial compared to the 
Colombian population.
CONCLUSION: The lower rates of contraceptive failure and the decrease in the 
incidence of pregnancies in women participating in the trial compared to the 
Colombian population across the 7 years of evaluation suggest that the 
strategies used in API ADAD Colombia were adequate and effective in addressing 
contraception use.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurogenerative disorder 
without effective treatments. Defects in mitochondrial complex I are thought to 
contribute to AD pathogenesis. The aim of this study is to explore whether a 
novel gene therapy transducing yeast complex I gene NDI1 can be used to treat AD 
with severely reduced complex I function in cell and animal models.
METHODS: The differentiated human neural cells were induced by Aβ1-42 to 
establish the AD cell model, and adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) was 
used to transduce yeast NDI1 into the cell model. Aβ1-42 was injected into the 
hippocampus area of the brain to establish the AD mouse model. AAV9-NDI1 was 
injected stereotaxically into the hippocampus area to test the therapeutic 
effect.
RESULTS: The expressed yeast complex I had an ameliorating effect on the 
defective function of human complex I and cellular pathological characteristics 
in the AD cell model. Furthermore, AAV9-NDI1 gene therapy in the hippocampus had 
a therapeutic effect on various aspects of mitochondrial function, 
histopathological characteristics and neurological defects in the AD mouse 
model. In addition, AAV9-NDI1 injection into the hippocampus of normal mice did 
not cause any adverse effect.
CONCLUSIONS: Compensating mitochondrial complex I function with yeast NDI1 is 
effective for gene therapy in Aβ-induced AD cell and mouse models. The results 
of this study offer a novel strategy and approach for treating AD types 
characterized by complex I abnormalities.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) cause significant neuronal 
loss and severely impair daily living. Despite different clinical 
manifestations, these disorders share common pathological molecular hallmarks, 
including mitochondrial dysfunction and synaptic degeneration. A detailed 
comparison of molecular changes at single-cell resolution in the cortex, as one 
of the main brain regions affected in both disorders, may reveal common 
susceptibility factors and disease mechanisms. We performed single-cell 
transcriptomic analyses of post-mortem cortical tissue from AD and PD subjects 
and controls to identify common and distinct disease-associated changes in 
individual genes, cellular pathways, molecular networks, and cell-cell 
communication events, and to investigate common mechanisms. The results revealed 
significant disease-specific, shared, and opposing gene expression changes, 
including cell type-specific signatures for both diseases. Hypoxia signaling and 
lipid metabolism emerged as significantly modulated cellular processes in both 
AD and PD, with contrasting expression alterations between the two diseases. 
Furthermore, both pathway and cell-cell communication analyses highlighted 
shared significant alterations involving the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, which 
has been implicated in the inflammatory response in several neurodegenerative 
disorders. Overall, the analyses revealed common and distinct alterations in 
gene signatures, pathway activities, and gene regulatory subnetworks in AD and 
PD. The results provide insights into coordinated changes in pathway activity 
and cell-cell communication that may guide future diagnostics and therapeutics.

Over the past 40 years, the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor family, 
particularly the M1-receptor and M4-receptor subtypes, have emerged as validated 
targets for the symptomatic treatment of neurological diseases such as 
schizophrenia and Alzheimer disease. However, despite considerable effort and 
investment, no drugs have yet gained clinical approval. This is largely 
attributable to cholinergic adverse effects that have halted the majority of 
programmes and resulted in a waning of interest in these G-protein-coupled 
receptor targets. Recently, this trend has been reversed. Driven by advances in 
structure-based drug design and an appreciation of the optimal pharmacological 
properties necessary to deliver clinical efficacy while minimizing adverse 
effects, a new generation of M1-receptor and M4-receptor orthosteric agonists 
and positive allosteric modulators are now entering the clinic. These agents 
offer the prospect of novel therapeutic solutions for 'hard to treat' 
neurological diseases, heralding a new era of muscarinic drug discovery.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an important geriatric disease that creates 
challenges in health policy planning. There is no previous attempt to quantify 
the actual direct healthcare cost of AD among older adults in Malaysia. This 
retrospective observational study with bottom-up micro-costing approach aimed to 
evaluate the direct healthcare expenditure on AD along with its potential 
predictors from healthcare providers' perspective, conducted across six tertiary 
hospitals in Malaysia. AD patients aged 65 and above who received AD treatment 
between 1 January 2016 and 31 December 2021 were included. Direct healthcare 
cost (DHC) of AD was estimated by extracting one-year follow-up information from 
patient medical records. As a result, 333 AD patients were included in the 
study. The mean DHC of AD was estimated RM2641.30 (USD 572.45) per patient per 
year (PPPY) from the healthcare payer's perspective. Laboratory investigations 
accounted for 37.2% of total DHC, followed by clinic care (31.5%) and 
prescription medicine (24.9%). As disease severity increases, annual DHC 
increases from RM2459.04 (mild), RM 2642.27 (moderate), to RM3087.61 (severe) 
PPPY. Patients aged 81 and above recorded significantly higher annual DHC 
(p = 0.003). Such real-world estimates are important in assisting the process of 
formulating healthcare policies in geriatric care.

BACKGROUND: Emerging data suggest that glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists 
(GLP-1 RAs) improve kidney outcomes for people with type 2 diabetes (T2D). 
Direct comparisons of the kidney and cardiovascular effectiveness of GLP-1 RA 
with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), a first-line therapy 
for this population, are needed.
OBJECTIVES: The authors compared kidney and cardiovascular outcomes for new 
users of SGLT2i and GLP-1 RAs with T2D.
METHODS: Using propensity score overlap weighting, we analyzed electronic health 
record data from 20 U.S. health systems contributing to PCORnet between 2015 and 
2020. The primary kidney outcome was a composite of sustained 40% estimated 
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline, incident end-stage kidney disease, or 
all-cause mortality over 2 years or until censoring. In addition, we examined 
cardiovascular and safety outcomes.
RESULTS: The weighted study cohort included 35,004 SGLT2i and 47,268 GLP-1 RA 
initiators. Over a median of 1.2 years, the primary outcome did not differ 
between treatments (HR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.81-1.02), although SGLT2i were 
associated with a lower risk of 40% eGFR decline (HR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.65-0.91). 
Risks of mortality (HR: 1.08; 95% CI: 0.92-1.27), a composite of stroke, 
myocardial infarction, or death (HR: 1.03; 95% CI: 0.93-1.14), and heart failure 
hospitalization (HR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.80-1.13) did not differ. Genital mycotic 
infections were more common for SGLT2i initiators, but other safety outcomes did 
not differ. The results were similar regardless of chronic kidney disease 
status.
CONCLUSIONS: SGLT2i and GLP-1 RAs led to similar kidney and cardiovascular 
outcomes in people with T2D, though SGLT2i initiation was associated with a 
lower risk of 40% eGFR decline. (Evaluating Comparative Effectiveness of 
Empagliflozin in Type 2 Diabetes Population With and Without Chronic Kidney

AIMS: Microglial cells are integral to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). The observed sex disparity in AD prevalence, with a notable predominance 
in women, implies a potential influence of sex hormones, such as androgens, on 
disease mechanisms. Despite this, the specific effects of androgens on microglia 
remain unclear. This study is designed to delineate the interplay between 
androgens and the survival and inflammatory profile of microglial cells, as well 
as to explore their contribution to the progression of AD.
METHODS AND KEY FINDINGS: To create a chronic androgen deficiency model, 
3-month-old wild-type (WT) mice and APP/PS1 mice underwent bilateral orchiectomy 
(ORX), with age-matched sham-operated controls. Cognitive and memory were 
evaluated at 5 and 12 months, paralleled by assessments of amyloid-beta (Aβ) and 
microglial morphology in hippocampal and cortical areas. The ORX treatment in 
mice resulted in diminished microglial populations and morphological 
alterations, alongside an increase in Aβ plaques and a concomitant decline in 
cognitive performance that exacerbated over time. In vitro, dihydrotestosterone 
(DHT) was found to stimulate microglial proliferation and ameliorate 
Aβ1-42-induced apoptosis.
SIGNIFICANCE: These findings suggested that androgens may exert a protective 
role, maintaining the normal proliferation and functionality of microglial 
cells. This preservation could potentially slow the progression of AD. As a 
result, our study provided a conceptual framework for the development of novel 
therapeutic strategies for AD.

Amyloid-β (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau protein are targets for Alzheimer's 
Disease (AD) immunotherapies, which are generally focused on single epitopes 
within Aβ or tau. However, due to the complexity of both Aβ and tau in AD 
pathogenesis, a multipronged approach simultaneously targeting multiple epitopes 
of both proteins could overcome limitations of monotherapies. Herein, we propose 
an active AD immunotherapy based on a nanoparticle vaccine comprising two Aβ 
peptides (1-14 and pyroglutamate pE3-14) and three tau peptides (centered on 
phosphorylated pT181, pT217 and pS396/404). These correspond to both soluble and 
aggregated targets and are displayed on the surface of immunogenic liposomes in 
an orientation that maintains reactivity with epitope-specific monoclonal 
antibodies. Intramuscular immunization of mice with individual epitopes resulted 
in minimally cross-reactive antibody induction, while simultaneous co-display of 
5 antigens ("5-plex") induced antibodies against all epitopes without immune 
interference. Post-immune sera recognized plaques and neurofibrillary tangles 
from human AD brain tissue. Vaccine administration to 3xTg-AD mice using a 
prophylactic dosing schedule inhibited tau and amyloid pathologies and resulted 
in improved cognitive function. Immunization was well tolerated and did not 
induce antigen-specific cellular responses or persistent inflammatory responses 
in the peripheral or central nervous system. Antibody levels could be reversed 
by halting monthly vaccinations. Altogether, these results indicate that active 
immune therapies based on nanoparticle formulations of multiple Aβ and tau 
epitopes warrant further study for treating early-stage AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifaceted neurodegenerative condition marked by 
gradual cognitive deterioration and the loss of neurons. While conventional bulk 
RNA sequencing techniques have shed light on AD pathology, they frequently 
obscure the cellular diversity within brain tissues. The advent of single-cell 
RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has transformed our capability to analyze the 
cellular composition of AD, allowing for the detection of unique cell 
populations, rare cell types, and gene expression alterations at an individual 
cell level. This review examines the use of scRNA-seq in AD research, focusing 
on its contributions to understanding cellular diversity, disease progression, 
and potential therapeutic targets. We discuss key technological innovations, 
data analysis techniques, and challenges associated with scRNA-seq in studying 
AD. Furthermore, we highlight recent studies that have utilized scRNA-seq to 
identify novel biomarkers, uncover disease-associated pathways, and elucidate 
the role of non-neuronal cells, such as microglia and astrocytes, in AD 
pathogenesis. By providing a comprehensive overview of advancements in scRNA-seq 
for unraveling cellular heterogeneity in AD, this review highlights the 
transformative impact of scRNA-seq on our comprehension of disease mechanisms 
and the creation of targeted treatments.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by disorders in brain energy. The lack 
of sufficient energy for nerve function leads to cognitive dysfunction and 
massive neuronal loss in AD. Ketone bodies are an alternative to glucose as a 
source of energy in the brain, and alternate-day fasting (ADF) promotes the 
production of the ketone body β-hydroxybutyric acid (βOHB). In this study, 
7-month-old male WT mice and 3xTg mice underwent dietary control for 20 weeks. 
We found that ADF increased circulating βOHB concentrations in 3xTg mice, 
improved cognitive function, reduced anxiety-like behaviors, improved 
hippocampal synaptic plasticity, and reduced neuronal loss, Aβ oligomers and tau 
hyperphosphorylation. In addition, ADF improved mitochondrial bioenergetic 
function by promoting brain ketone metabolism and rescued brain energy deficits 
in 3xTg mice. A safety evaluation showed that ADF improved exercise endurance 
and liver and kidney function in 3xTg mice without negatively affecting muscle 
motor and heart functions. This study provides a theoretical basis and strong 
support for the application of ADF as a non-drug strategy for preventing and 
treating brain energy defects in the early stage of AD.

Objective.Recent studies have indicated that repetitive transcranial magnetic 
stimulation (rTMS) could enhance cognition in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients, 
but to now the molecular-level interaction mechanisms driving this effect remain 
poorly understood. While cognitive scores have been the primary measure of rTMS 
effectiveness, employing molecular-based approaches could offer more precise 
treatment predictions and prognoses. To reach this goal, it is fundamental to 
assess the electric field (E-field) and the induced current densities (J) within 
the stimulated brain areas and to translate these values toin vitrosystems 
specifically devoted in investigating molecular-based interactions of this 
stimulation.Approach.This paper offers a methodological procedure to guide 
dosimetric assessment to translate the E-field induced in humans (in a specific 
pilot study) intoin vitrosettings. Electromagnetic simulations on patients' head 
models and cellular holders were conducted to characterize exposure conditions 
and determine necessary adjustments forin vitroreplication of the same dose 
delivered in humans using the same stimulating coil.Main results.Our study 
highlighted the levels of E-field andJinduced in the target brain region and 
showed that the computed E-field andJwere different among patients that 
underwent the treatment, so to replicate the exposure to thein vitrosystem, we 
have to consider a range of electric quantities as reference. To match the 
E-field to the levels calculated in patients' brains, an increase of at least 
the 25% in the coil feeding current is necessary whenin vitrostimulations are 
performed. Conversely, to equalize current densities, modifications in the cells 
culture medium conductivity have to be implemented reducing it to one fifth of 
its value.Significance.This dosimetric assessment and subsequent experimental 
adjustments are essential to achieve controlledin vitroexperiments to better 
understand rTMS effects on AD cognition. Dosimetry is a fundamental step for 
comparing the cognitive effects with those obtained by stimulating a cellular 
model at an equal dose rigorously evaluated.

The ancient messenger molecule hydrogen sulfide (H2S) modulates myriad signaling 
cascades and has been conserved across evolutionary boundaries. Although 
traditionally known as an environmental toxin, H2S is also synthesized 
endogenously to exert modulatory and homeostatic effects in a broad array of 
physiologic functions. Notably, H2S levels are tightly physiologically 
regulated, as both its excess and paucity can be toxic. Accumulating evidence 
has revealed pivotal roles for H2S in neuroprotection and normal cognitive 
function, and H2S homeostasis is dysregulated in neurodegenerative conditions. 
Here, we review the normal neuroprotective roles of H2S that go awry in 
Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of neurodegenerative disease.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Previous randomized controlled trials and 
longitudinal studies have indicated that ongoing antihypertensive use in late 
life reduces all-cause dementia risk, but the specific impact on Alzheimer 
dementia (AD) and non-AD risk remains unclear. This study investigates whether 
previous hypertension or antihypertensive use modifies AD or non-AD risk in late 
life and the ideal blood pressure (BP) for risk reduction in a diverse 
consortium of cohort studies.
METHODS: This individual participant data meta-analysis included community-based 
longitudinal studies of aging from a preexisting consortium. The main outcomes 
were risk of developing AD and non-AD. The main exposures were hypertension 
history/antihypertensive use and baseline systolic BP/diastolic BP. 
Mixed-effects Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess risk and 
natural splines were applied to model the relationship between BP and the 
dementia outcomes. The main model controlled for age, age2, sex, education, 
ethnoracial group, and study cohort. Supplementary analyses included a fully 
adjusted model, an analysis restricting to those with >5 years of follow-up and 
models that examined the moderating effect of age, sex, and ethnoracial group.
RESULTS: There were 31,250 participants from 14 nations in the analysis (41% 
male) with a mean baseline age of 72 (SD 7.5, range 60-110) years. Participants 
with untreated hypertension had a 36% (hazard ratio [HR] 1.36, 95% CI 1.01-1.83, 
p = 0.0406) and 42% (HR 1.42, 95% CI 1.08-1.87, p = 0.0135) increased risk of AD 
compared with "healthy controls" and those with treated hypertension, 
respectively. Compared with "healthy controls" both those with treated (HR 1.29, 
95% CI 1.03-1.60, p = 0.0267) and untreated hypertension (HR 1.69, 95% CI 
1.19-2.40, p = 0.0032) had greater non-AD risk, but there was no difference 
between the treated and untreated groups. Baseline diastolic BP had a 
significant U-shaped relationship (p = 0.0227) with non-AD risk in an analysis 
restricted to those with 5-year follow-up, but otherwise there was no 
significant relationship between baseline BP and either AD or non-AD risk.
DISCUSSION: Antihypertensive use was associated with decreased AD but not non-AD 
risk throughout late life. This suggests that treating hypertension throughout 
late life continues to be crucial in AD risk mitigation. A single measure of BP 
was not associated with AD risk, but DBP may have a U-shaped relationship with 
non-AD risk over longer periods in late life.

BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a pre-clinical stage of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Understanding the transition probabilities across the 
disease continuum of AD, ranging from MCI to AD to Mortality is crucial for the 
economic modeling of AD and effective planning of future interventions and 
healthcare resource allocation decisions. This study uses the Multi-state Markov 
model to quantify the transition probabilities along the disease progression and 
specifically investigates medications as modifiable risk factors of AD 
associated with accelerated or decelerated transition times from MCI to AD, MCI 
to mortality, and AD to mortality.
METHODS: Individuals with MCI were identified from the National Alzheimer's 
Coordinating Center between September 2005 and May 2021. A three-state Markov 
model was postulated to model the disease progression among three states: MCI, 
AD, and mortality with adjustment for demographics, genetic characteristics, 
comorbidities and medications. Transition probabilities, the total length of 
stay in each state, and the hazard ratios of the use of medications for 
diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia (the known modifiable risk 
factors of AD) were evaluated for these transitions.
RESULTS: 3,324 individuals with MCI were identified. The probability of 
developing AD after one year since the initial diagnosis of MCI is 14.9%. After 
approximately 6 years from the initial diagnosis of MCI, the probability of 
transitioning to AD increases to nearly 41.7% before experiencing a subsequent 
decline. The expected total lengths of stay were 5.38 (95% CI: 0.002-6.03) years 
at MCI state and 7.61 (95%CI: 0.002-8.88) years at AD state. Patients with 
active use of lipid-lowering agents were associated with significantly lower 
hazards of transitioning from MCI to AD (HR: 0.83, 95%CI:0.71-0.96), MCI to 
mortality (HR: 0.51, 95%CI:0.34-0.77), and AD to mortality (HR: 0.81, 
95%CI:0.66-0.99).
CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that lipid-lowering agents may confer a protective 
effect, delaying the onset of AD. Additionally, lipid-lowering agents indicate a 
favorable association with a longer survival time.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) imposes a major burden on affected individuals, their 
caregivers and health-care systems alike. Though quite many risk factors for 
disease progression have been identified, there is a lack of prospective studies 
investigating the interplay and predictive value of a wide variety of patient 
variables associated with cognitive deterioration (defined as key feature of AD 
progression). Study participants were patients with probable and possible AD, 
that were assessed at four time points over a period of two years (T1-T4). The 
main results were threefold: (i) over time, significant changes were observed 
regarding patients' cognitive functioning, activities of daily living and 
caregiver load (but not depression, pain, neuropsychiatric symptoms); (ii) 
intercorrelations between caregiver load and patients' cognitive and functional 
variables were high, correlation patterns remaining rather stable across time; 
(iii) cognitive functioning at T4 was best predicted by patients' age, sex, 
atrial fibrillation and activities of daily living at T1; and (iv) across all 
four assessment points, cognitive functioning was best predicted by time (i.e., 
disease duration), age, sex, activities of daily living and depression. Overall, 
even in early stages of AD and during a short two-year period, functional 
changes were significant and tightly intertwined with caregiver load, thus 
stressing the need to consider caregiver load when diagnosing and treating 
patients with AD. A novel and clinically relevant finding is that even in early 
stages of AD, cognitive deterioration was best predicted by a combination of 
patients' demographic, somatic and functional variables.

Experiences of African American caregivers providing care for family living with 
Alzheimer's disease: A descriptive phenomenological study.

This study aimed to describe how African American family caregivers of people 
living with Alzheimer's disease manage caregiving. A qualitative study design 
using a descriptive phenomenological approach was used to understand the lived 
experiences of African American family caregivers. Fifteen individual 
semi-structured and in-depth interviews were conducted via telephone or 
videoconference between January and June 2023 to address the research question. 
Guided by Swanson's theory of caring, the data transcribed verbatim from the 
audio-recorded interviews were analyzed using Colaizzi's methodology. Eight 
themes emerged from the data: (a) Parenting all over again, (b) Self-sacrifice, 
(c) Caring for the caregiver, (d) Connecting to God, (e) Responsibility to care, 
(f) Trapped, (g) Beyond exhaustion, and (h) Loss of self. The findings of the 
study indicate that African American family caregivers of people living with 
Alzheimer's disease often experience physical, mental, and emotional exhaustion 
while managing care. Thus, there is a considerable need for greater support, 
health promotion, and development of appropriate interventions to alleviate the 
challenges experienced so that they can continue in their caregiving role with 
some respite.

The goal of the Biostatistics Core of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) has been to ensure that sound study designs and statistical 
methods are used to meet the overall goals of ADNI. We have supported the 
creation of a well-validated and well-curated longitudinal database of clinical 
and biomarker information on ADNI participants and helped to make this 
accessible and usable for researchers. We have developed a statistical 
methodology for characterizing the trajectories of clinical and biomarker change 
for ADNI participants across the spectrum from cognitively normal to dementia, 
including multivariate patterns and evidence for heterogeneity in cognitive 
aging. We have applied these methods and adapted them to improve clinical trial 
design. ADNI-4 will offer us a chance to help extend these efforts to a more 
diverse cohort with an even richer panel of biomarker data to support better 
knowledge of and treatment for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. 
HIGHLIGHTS: The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) Biostatistics 
Core provides study design and analytic support to ADNI investigators. Core 
members develop and apply novel statistical methodology to work with ADNI data 
and support clinical trial design. The Core contributes to the standardization, 
validation, and harmonization of biomarker data. The Core serves as a resource 
to the wider research community to address questions related to the data and 
study as a whole.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Recent guidelines point to lifestyle as a tool for 
decreasing Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk. To address the limited practice and 
availability of AD risk reduction interventions, this study aimed to explore the 
feasibility of a community-level lifestyle intervention targeting high-risk 
groups.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Diverse older adults (60+) living in the Richmond, 
VA, local area, with the following risk factors, incomes below $12,000/year and 
managing diabetes or cardiovascular disease, were offered weekly lifestyle 
telephone health coaching for 12 weeks in 2019-2020 (intervention group). The 
health coaching sessions provided Alzheimer's disease (AD) lifestyle risk 
reduction education and goal setting/planning. The intervention sample (n = 40, 
mean age 68 years (range: 60-76 years), was 90% African American/Black (n = 36) 
and 45% male (n = 18). Thereafter, in 2021-2022, n = 37 individuals in the same 
area were recruited as a comparison group and not given health coaching (control 
group), mean age of 65.5 years (range: 57-83 years), 92% African American/Black 
(n = 34), and 50% male (n = 18).
RESULTS: Repeated-measures intervention effects were seen for cognitive ability, 
indicating greater improvement in the intervention group (p < .01). Significant 
difference scores indicated greater cognitive ability (p < .01) and physical 
activity (p < .001) gains in the intervention group, with intervention subjects 
with reported memory problems showed relatively less physical activity gains 
(p < .05).
DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: This work creates the impetus for future 
large-scale AD risk reduction investigations to mitigate and improve modifiable 
risk among diverse older adults. Our positive trends in AD risk reduction 
support telephone-based health coaching as a feasible AD risk reduction 
intervention.

INTRODUCTION: Brain glucose hypometabolism, indexed by the fluorodeoxyglucose 
positron emission tomography ([18F]FDG-PET) imaging, is a metabolic signature of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the underlying biological pathways involved 
in these metabolic changes remain elusive.
METHODS: Here, we integrated [18F]FDG-PET images with blood and hippocampal 
transcriptomic data from cognitively unimpaired (CU, n = 445) and cognitively 
impaired (CI, n = 749) individuals using modular dimension reduction techniques 
and voxel-wise linear regression analysis.
RESULTS: Our results showed that multiple transcriptomic modules are associated 
with brain [18F]FDG-PET metabolism, with the top hits being a protein 
serine/threonine kinase activity gene cluster (peak-t(223) = 4.86, P 
value < 0.001) and zinc-finger-related regulatory units (peak-t(223) = 3.90, P 
value < 0.001).
DISCUSSION: By integrating transcriptomics with PET imaging data, we identified 
that serine/threonine kinase activity-associated genes and zinc-finger-related 
regulatory units are highly associated with brain metabolic changes in AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: We conducted an integrated analysis of system-based transcriptomics 
and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ([18F]FDG-PET) at the voxel 
level in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The biological process of serine/threonine 
kinase activity was the most associated with [18F]FDG-PET in the AD brain. 
Serine/threonine kinase activity alterations are associated with brain 
vulnerable regions in AD [18F]FDG-PET. Zinc-finger transcription factor targets 
were associated with AD brain [18F]FDG-PET metabolism.

The P2X7 receptor (P2X7R), an ATP-gated ion channel, has emerged as a crucial 
player in neuroinflammation and a promising therapeutic target for 
neurodegenerative disorders. This review explores the current understanding of 
P2X7R's structure, activation, and physiological roles, focusing on its 
expression and function in microglial cells. The article examines the receptor's 
involvement in calcium signaling, microglial activation, and polarization, as 
well as its role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's 
disease, multiple sclerosis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The review 
highlights the complex nature of P2X7R signaling, discussing its potential 
neuroprotective and neurotoxic effects depending on the disease stage and 
context. It also addresses the development of P2X7R antagonists and their 
progress in clinical trials, identifying key research gaps and future 
perspectives for P2X7R-targeted therapy development. By providing a 
comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge and future directions, 
this review serves as a valuable resource for researchers and clinicians 
interested in exploring the therapeutic potential of targeting P2X7R for the 
treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.

PURPOSE: The production/excretion rate of Amyloid-β (Aβ) is the basis of the 
plaque burden in alzheimer's disease (AD), which depends on both central and 
peripheral clearance. In this study, the effect of silymarin and rosuvastatin on 
serum markers and clinical outcomes in dyslipidemic AD patients was 
investigated.
METHODS: Participants (n=36) were randomized to silymarin (140 mg), placebo, and 
rosuvastatin 10 mg orally three times a day for 6 months. Serum collection and 
clinical outcome tests were performed at baseline and after completion of 
treatment. Lipid profile markers, oxidative stress markers, Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio, 
and Soluble Low-density lipoprotein receptor-Related Protein-1 (sLRP1)/Soluble 
Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products (sRAGE) ratio were measured.
RESULTS: There was a statistically significant increase in Δ-high density 
lipoprotein (ΔHDL) between silymarin and placebo (P<0.000) and also between 
rosuvastatin and placebo (p=0.044). The level of Δ-triglycerides (ΔTG) in the 
silymarin group has a significant decrease compared to both the placebo and the 
rosuvastatin group (p<0.000 and p=0.036, respectively). The Δ-superoxide 
dismutase (ΔSOD) level in the silymarin group compared to placebo and 
rosuvastatin had a significant increase (p<0.000 and p=0.008, respectively). The 
ΔAβ1-42/Aβ1-40 in the silymarin group compared to both the placebo and 
rosuvastatin groups had a significant increase (p<0.05). There was an inverse 
relationship between ΔTG and ΔAβ1-42/Aβ1-40 (p=-0.493 and p=0.004). 
ΔAβ1-42/Aβ1-40 has a direct statistical relationship with ΔSOD marker (p=0.388 
and p=0.031). Also, there was a direct correlation between the level of 
ΔAβ1-42/Aβ1-40 and ΔsLRP1/sRAGE (p=0.491 and p=0.005).
CONCLUSION: Our study showed the relationship between plasma lipids, especially 
ΔTG and ΔHDL, with ΔAβ1-42/Aβ1-40 in dyslipidemic AD patients, and modulation of 
these lipid factors can be used to monitor the response to treatments.

Computerized cognitive training (CCT) is a rapidly developing area of cognitive 
rehabilitation at the intersection of information technology and healthcare, the 
constantly updated results of which can be successfully translated into 
practical application in clinical medicine and in particular in gerontology. The 
basis of CCT, as a non-invasive method of influencing the functional activity of 
the brain and the processes of neuroplasticity, is software for stimulating 
cognitive functions in order to improve their productivity. The level of 
scientific and practical interest in CCP technology is growing rapidly. The 
article reports on the current state of research on the use of CCT aimed at 
correcting cognitive impairment. The purpose of this work is to systematize the 
available scientific data in this area, as well as to promote further 
integration of research in the field of information technology into clinical 
practice, in particular, to study the potential of CCT as a promising 
therapeutic tool in the paradigm of successful aging and prevention of the 
progression of cognitive impairment. This noninvasive intervention may improve 
global cognitive function in patients with clinically defined impairments and 
during normal aging in cognitively healthy older adults. However, new studies 
with fully comparable protocols are needed to evaluate in more detail the 
duration of the effect and the effectiveness of CCT in preventing cognitive 
decline in the long term.

Publisher: Компьютеризированный когнитивный тренинг (ККТ) представляет собой 
быстро развивающееся направление когнитивной реабилитации на пересечении 
информационных технологий и здравоохранения, постоянно обновляемые результаты 
которого возможно с успехом транслировать в сферу практического применения в 
клинической медицине и, в частности, в геронтологии. Основу ККT, как 
неинвазивного метода воздействия на функциональную активность мозга и процессы 
нейропластичности, составляет программное обеспечение для стимуляции когнитивных 
функций с целью улучшения их продуктивности. Научный и практический интерес к 
технологии ККТ растет быстрыми темпами, и в определенной степени он даже больше, 
чем к некоторым другим областям реабилитации, ориентированным на здоровое 
старение. В статье сообщается о современном состоянии исследований применения 
ККТ, направленного на коррекцию когнитивных нарушений. Цель настоящей работы — 
не только систематизировать имеющиеся научные данные в этой области, но также 
способствовать дальнейшей интеграции быстро развивающихся исследований в области 
информационных технологий в клиническую практику. В частности, необходимо 
изучить потенциал ККТ как перспективного терапевтического инструмента в 
парадигме успешного старения и профилактики прогрессирования когнитивных 
нарушений. Проведенный анализ показывает, что такое вмешательство может улучшить 
глобальные когнитивные функции у пациентов с клинически установленными 
нарушениями и в процессе нормального старения у когнитивно-здоровых людей 
пожилого возраста. Однако необходимы новые исследования с максимально 
сопоставимыми протоколами, чтобы более детально оценить длительность эффекта и 
результативность ККТ для предотвращения снижения когнитивных функций в 
долгосрочной перспективе.

INTRODUCTION: Well-chosen biomarkers have the potential to increase the 
efficiency of clinical trials and drug discovery and should show good precision 
as well as clinical validity.
METHODS: We suggest measures that operationalize these criteria and describe a 
general approach that can be used for inference-based comparisons of biomarker 
performance. The methods are applied to measures obtained from structural 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) from individuals with mild dementia (n = 70) or 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n = 303) enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative.
RESULTS: Ventricular volume and hippocampal volume showed the best precision in 
detecting change over time in both individuals with MCI and with dementia. 
Differences in clinical validity varied by group.
DISCUSSION: The methodology presented provides a standardized framework for 
comparison of biomarkers across modalities and across different methods used to 
generate similar measures and will help in the search for the most promising 
biomarkers.
HIGHLIGHTS: A framework for comparison of biomarkers on pre-defined criteria is 
presented. Criteria for comparison include precision in capturing change and 
clinical validity. Ventricular volume has high precision in change for both 
dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) trials. Imaging measures' 
performance in clinical validity varies more for dementia than for MCI.

Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a neurodegenerative disease 
characterized by 4R tau deposition in neurons as well as in astrocytes and 
oligodendrocytes. While astrocytic tau deposits are rarely observed in normal 
aging (so-called aging-related tau astrogliopathy, ARTAG) and Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), astrocytic tau in the form of tufted astrocytes is a pathognomonic 
hallmark of PSP. Classical biochemical experiments emphasized tau synthesis in 
neurons in the central nervous system, suggesting that astrocytic tau inclusions 
might be derived from uptake of extracellular neuronal-derived tau. However, 
recent single-nucleus RNAseq experiments highlight the fact that MAPT, the gene 
encoding tau, is also expressed by astrocytes, albeit in lower amounts. We, 
therefore, revisited the question of whether astrocyte-driven expression of tau 
might contribute to astrocytic tau aggregates in PSP by performing fluorescent 
in situ hybridization/immunohistochemical co-localization in human postmortem 
brain specimens from individuals with PSP and AD with ARTAG as well as normal 
controls. We find that, in PSP but not in AD, tau-immunoreactive astrocytes have 
higher levels of MAPT mRNA compared to astrocytes that do not have tau 
aggregates. These results suggest that astrocytic responses in PSP are unique to 
this tauopathy and support the possibility that fundamental changes in PSP 
astrocyte-endogenous mRNA biology contribute to increased synthesis of tau 
protein and underlies the formation of the astrocytic tau deposits 
characteristic of PSP.

Despite the growing interest in precision medicine-based therapies for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), little research has been conducted on how individual 
AD risk factors influence changes in cognitive function following transcranial 
direct current stimulation (tDCS). This study evaluates the cognitive effects of 
sequential tDCS on 63 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, considering AD 
risk factors such as amyloid-beta deposition, APOE ε4, BDNF polymorphism, and 
sex. Using both frequentist and Bayesian methods, we assessed the interaction of 
tDCS with these risk factors on cognitive performance. Notably, we found that 
amyloid-beta deposition significantly interacted with tDCS in improving 
executive function, specifically Stroop Word-Color scores, with strong Bayesian 
support for this finding. Memory enhancements were differentially influenced by 
BDNF Met carrier status. However, sex and APOE ε4 status did not show 
significant effects. Our results highlight the importance of individual AD risk 
factors in modulating cognitive outcomes from tDCS, suggesting that precision 
medicine may offer more effective tDCS treatments tailored to individual risk 
profiles in early AD stages.

INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Evidence suggests an association between periodontitis 
and neurodegenerative diseases, but a comprehensive analysis of research trends 
remains absent. Therefore, we aim to identify research trends and hotspots on 
the comorbidity between periodontitis and neurodegenerative diseases, understand 
mechanisms, provide guidance for subsequent studies and show its clinical 
translational possibility.
METHODS: A bibliometric analysis covering 1982 to 2023 was conducted using the 
Web of Science Core Collection. English-language articles range from January 1, 
1982 to November 30, 2023 were analyzed. Data were downloaded on November 30, 
2023 and analyzed on December, 2023. Data visualization and statistical analysis 
were performed to identify trends of annual publications, countries, sources, 
institutions, authors, most cited articles, and keywords by using Microsoft 
Excel, VOSviewer, Citespace, R-bibliometrix and Origin Pro.
RESULTS: A total of 1,238 articles from 1982 to 2023 on the comorbidity between 
periodontitis and neurodegenerative diseases were identified. Annual 
publications showed an upward trend. The United States, University College of 
London, BRAIN and Shy, Michael E. were the leading nation, affiliation, source 
and author, respectively. The United States, NEUROLOGY, and Curtis Maurice A. 
were the most cited nation, source, and author. Keywords network analysis 
highlighted 'Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease', 'Alzheimer's Disease' and 
'Periodontitis' as focal points. Detection of keywords citation bursts 
demonstrated 'Porphyromonas gingivalis' and 'Cognitive Dysfunction' as hot 
topics in recent research.
CONCLUSIONS: In recent years, emerging interests of the comorbidity between 
periodontitis and neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) are growing. Our study 
enhances the understanding of recent research trends of periodontitis and NDs 
and provides valuable perspectives within this expanding field, offering new 
insights into research trends regarding the interplay between 'Porphyromonas 
gingivalis' and 'Cognitive Dysfunction'. Further research of the molecular 
mechanisms between P. gingivalis-induced periodontitis, neuroinflammation, that 
leads neurodegeneration are clearly warranted.

The digitisation of health care is offering the promise of transforming the 
management of paediatric sepsis, which is a major source of morbidity and 
mortality in children worldwide. Digital technology is already making an impact 
in paediatric sepsis, but is almost exclusively benefiting patients in 
high-resource health-care settings. However, digital tools can be highly 
scalable and cost-effective, and-with the right planning-have the potential to 
reduce global health disparities. Novel digital solutions, from wearable devices 
and mobile apps, to electronic health record-embedded decision support tools, 
have an unprecedented opportunity to transform paediatric sepsis research and 
care. In this Series paper, we describe the current state of digital solutions 
in paediatric sepsis around the world, the advances in digital technology that 
are enabling the development of novel applications, and the potential effect of 
advances in artificial intelligence in paediatric sepsis research and clinical 
care.

Mutations in the PSEN genes are the major cause of familial Alzheimer's disease, 
and presenilin (PS) is the catalytic subunit of γ-secretase, which cleaves type 
I transmembrane proteins, including the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to 
release Aβ peptides. While PS plays an essential role in the protection of 
neuronal survival, PSEN mutations also increase the ratio of Aβ42/Aβ40. Thus, it 
remains unresolved whether PSEN mutations cause AD via a loss of its essential 
function or increases of Aβ42/Aβ40. Here, we test whether the knockin (KI) 
allele of Psen1 L435F, the most severe FAD mutation located closest to the 
active site of γ-secretase, causes age-dependent cortical neurodegeneration 
independent of Aβ by crossing various Psen mutant mice to the App-null 
background. We report that removing Aβ completely through APP deficiency has no 
impact on the age-dependent neurodegeneration in Psen mutant mice, as shown by 
the absence of effects on the reduced cortical volume and decreases of cortical 
neurons at the ages of 12 and 18 mo. The L435F KI allele increases Aβ42/Aβ40 in 
the cerebral cortex while decreasing de novo production and steady-state levels 
of Aβ42 and Aβ40 in the presence of APP. Furthermore, APP deficiency does not 
alleviate elevated apoptotic cell death in the cerebral cortex of Psen mutant 
mice at the ages of 2, 12, and 18 mo, nor does it affect the progressive 
microgliosis in these mice. Our findings demonstrate that Psen1 mutations cause 
age-dependent neurodegeneration independent of Aβ, providing further support for 
a loss-of-function pathogenic mechanism underlying PSEN mutations.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder characterized by 
cognitive decline. This study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of 
selegiline (SEL) against AD-induced cognitive deficits and explore the possible 
involved mechanisms. AD was induced by unilateral intracerebroventricular 
(U-ICV) injection of 5 μg of amyloid beta1-42 (Aβ1-42), and oral administration 
of SEL (0.5 mg/kg/day) was performed for 30 consecutive days. Aβ injection 
resulted in spatial cognitive decline, as demonstrated by a decrease in the time 
spent in the target zone on the probe day (P < 0.01) in the Barnes maze test 
(BMT). This spatial cognitive decline was associated with disrupted synaptic 
plasticity, as indicated by reductions in both components of hippocampal 
long-term potentiation (LTP), namely population spike amplitude (P < 0.001) and 
field excitatory postsynaptic potential (P < 0.001). On the other hand, the 
injection of Aβ resulted in oxidative stress by decreasing total thiol group 
(TTG) content and increasing malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in the rat plasma 
(P < 0.001). Additionally, the number of healthy cells in the hippocampal 
dentate gyrus (DG) and CA1 regions was reduced in AD rats (P < 0.001). However, 
oral administration of SEL improved spatial cognitive decline in the Aβ-induced 
AD rats. The results suggest that improvement of neuroplasticity deficiency, 
regulation of oxidant/antioxidant status, and suppression of neuronal loss by 
SEL may be the mechanisms underlying its beneficial effect against AD-related 
spatial cognitive impairment.

Precise control of norepinephrine (NE) levels and NE-receptor interaction is 
crucial for proper function of the brain. Much evidence for this view comes from 
experimental studies that indicate an important role for NE in the 
pathophysiology and treatment of various conditions, including cognitive 
dysfunction, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and 
sleep disorders. NE provides neuroprotection against several types of insults in 
multiple ways. It abrogates oxidative stress, attenuates neuroinflammatory 
responses in neurons and glial cells, reduces neuronal and glial cell activity, 
promotes autophagy, and ameliorates apoptotic responses to a variety of insults. 
It is beneficial for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases because it 
improves the generation of neurotrophic factors, promotes neuronal survival, and 
plays an important role in the regulation of adult neurogenesis. This review 
aims to present the evidence supporting a principal role for NE in 
neuroprotection, and molecular mechanisms of neuroprotection.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects approximately 50 million people 
globally and is expected to triple by 2050. Arctiin is a lignan found in the 
Arctium lappa L. plant. Arctiin possesses anti-proliferative, antioxidative and 
anti-adipogenic.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to explore the potential therapeutic effects of Arctiin on 
rats with AD by evaluating the expression of TLR4, NLRP3, STAT3, TGF-β, cyclin 
D1, and CDK2.
METHODS: AD was induced in rats by administering 70 mg/kg of aluminum chloride 
through intraperitoneal injection daily for six weeks. After inducing AD, some 
rats were treated with 25 mg/kg of Arctiin daily for three weeks through oral 
gavage. Furthermore, to examine the brain tissue structure, hippocampal sections 
were stained with hematoxylin/eosin and anti-TLR4 antibodies. The collected 
samples were analyzed for gene expression and protein levels of TLR4, NLRP3, 
STAT3, TGF-β, cyclin D1, and CDK2.
RESULTS: In behavioral tests, rats showed a significant improvement in their 
behavior when treated with Arctiin. Microimages stained with hematoxylin/eosin 
showed that Arctiin helped to improve the structure and cohesion of the 
hippocampus, which was previously impaired by AD. Furthermore, Arctiin reduced 
the expression of TLR4, NLRP3, STAT3, TGF-β, cyclin D1, and CDK2.
CONCLUSION: Arctiin can enhance rats' behavior and structure of the hippocampus 
in AD rats. This is achieved through its ability to reduce the expression of 
both TLR4 and NLRP3, hence inhibiting the inflammasome pathway. Furthermore, 
Arctiin can improve tissue fibrosis by regulating STAT3 and TGF-β. Lastly, it 
can block the cell cycle proteins cyclin D1 and CDK2.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia among middle-aged 
and elderly individuals. Accelerating the prevention and treatment of AD has 
become an urgent problem. New technology including Computer-aided drug design 
(CADD) can effectively reduce the medication cost for patients with AD, reduce 
the cost of living, and improve the quality of life of patients, providing new 
ideas for treating AD. This paper reviews the pathogenesis of AD, the latest 
developments in CADD and other small-molecule docking technologies for drug 
discovery and development; the current research status of small-molecule 
compounds for AD at home and abroad from the perspective of drug action targets; 
the future of AD drug development.

BACKGROUND: Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is characterized by a marked shift 
of electroencephalographic (EEG) power and dominant rhythm, from the α toward 
the θ frequency range. Transcranial alternate current stimulation (tACS) is a 
non-invasive brain stimulation technique that allows entrainment of cerebral 
oscillations at desired frequencies.
OBJECTIVES: Our goal is to evaluate the effects of occipital α-tACS on cognitive 
functions and neurophysiological measures in patients with DLB.
METHODS: We conducted a double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled, cross-over 
clinical trial in 14 participants with DLB. Participants were randomized to 
receive either α-tACS (60 minutes of 3 mA peak-to-peak stimulation at 12 Hz) or 
sham stimulation applied over the occipital cortex. Clinical evaluations were 
performed to assess visuospatial and executive functions, as well as verbal 
episodic memory. Neurophysiological assessments and EEG recordings were 
conducted at baseline and following both α-tACS and sham stimulations.
RESULTS: Occipital α-tACS was safe and well-tolerated. We observed a significant 
enhancement in visuospatial abilities and executive functions, but no 
improvement in verbal episodic memory. We observed an increase in short latency 
afferent inhibition, a neurophysiological marker indirectly and partially 
dependent on cholinergic transmission, coinciding with an increase in α power 
and a decrease in Δ power following α-tACS stimulation, effects not seen with 
sham stimulation.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that occipital α-tACS is safe and enhances 
visuospatial and executive functions in patients with DLB. Improvements in 
indirect markers of cholinergic transmission and EEG changes indicate 
significant neurophysiological engagement. These findings justify further 
exploration of α-tACS as a therapeutic option for DLB patients. © 2024 The

China.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to explore the treatment effect and therapeutic mechanisms 
of baicalin in Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: The AD rat model was established by intracerebroventricular injection 
of Aβ1-40, with rats in the baicalin group receiving baicalin intraventricular 
injections. Morris Water Maze and Hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) Staining were employed 
to detect the successful model construction and baicalin treatment effect. The 
proteins extracted from the hippocampus were subjected to proteomics analysis. 
Bioinformatics technology was employed for differential protein screening, 
functional classification, and enrichment. Western Blot was employed to validate 
the expressions of differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) and the protein 
modification alternations.
RESULTS: Water maze test confirmed the successful AD model construction and 
baicalin can improve learning and memory abilities. A total of 26 DEPs 
associated with 28 Gene Ontology (GO) functions were identified in the model and 
32 DEPs were obtained between the baicalin group and the model. Bioinformatics 
analysis demonstrated that AD occurrence resulted in neuronal dysfunction and 
was associated with immune responses. The baicalin therapeutic effect on AD may 
be associated with metabolic processes, vitamin response, angiogenesis 
regulation, and fatty acid response. Immunoglobulin heavy constant mu (Ighm) and 
Immunoglobulin G2a (IgG2a) exhibited significant increases in AD and baicalin 
attenuated their expressions, while Fatty acid desaturase 1 (Fads1) exhibited a 
significantly diminished expression and baicalin could reverse the trend. 
Succinylation detection exhibited the differentially expressed at 35 kD between 
the model and baicalin group.
CONCLUSION: Baicalin intervention may ameliorate cognitive impairment in AD rats 
by modulating the expressions of proteins and the succinylation modifications.

INTRODUCTION: In this study, we investigated biomarkers in a midlife, racially 
diverse, at-risk cohort to facilitate early identification and intervention. We 
examined neuroimaging measures, including resting state functional magnetic 
resonance imaging (fMRI), white matter hyperintensity vo (WMH), and hippocampal 
volumes, alongside cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers.
METHODS: Our data set included 76 cognitively unimpaired, middle-aged, Black 
Americans (N = 29, F/M = 17/12) and Non-Hispanic White (N = 47, F/M = 27/20) 
individuals. We compared cerebrospinal fluid phosphorylated tau141 and amyloid 
beta (Aβ)42 to fMRI default mode network (DMN) subnetwork connectivity, WMH 
volumes, and hippocampal volumes.
RESULTS: Results revealed a significant race × Aβ42 interaction in Black 
Americans: lower Aβ42 was associated with reduced DMN connectivity and increased 
WMH volumes regions but not in non-Hispanic White individuals.
DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that precuneus DMN connectivity and temporal 
WMHs may be linked to Alzheimer's disease risk pathology during middle age, 
particularly in Black Americans.
HIGHLIGHTS: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid beta (Aβ)42 relates to precuneus 
functional connectivity in Black, but not White, Americans. Higher white matter 
hyperintensity volume relates to lower CSF Aβ42 in Black Americans. Precuneus 
may be a hub for early Alzheimer's disease pathology changes detected by 
functional connectivity.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer pathology (AD) is characterized by the deposition of 
amyloid beta (Aβ) and chronic neuroinflammation, with the NLRP3 inflammasome 
playing a significant role. This study demonstrated that the OCD drug 
fluvoxamine maleate (FXN) can potently ameliorate AD pathology in 5XFAD mice by 
promoting autophagy-mediated clearance of Aβ and inhibiting the NLRP3 
inflammasome.
METHODS: We used mice primary astrocytes to establish the mechanism of action of 
FXN against NLRP3 inflammasome by using various techniques like ELISA, Western 
blotting, confocal microscopy, Immunofluorescence, etc. The anti-AD activity of 
FXN was validated in transgenic 5XFAD mice following two months of treatment. 
This was followed by behavior analysis, examination of inflammatory and 
autophagy proteins and immunohistochemistry analysis for Aβ load in the 
hippocampi.
RESULTS: Our data showed that FXN, at a low concentration of 78 nM, induces 
autophagy to inhibit NF-κB and the NLRP3 inflammasome, apart from directly 
inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome in primary astrocytes. FXN activated the PRKAA2 
pathway through CAMKK2 signaling, leading to autophagy induction. It inhibited 
the ATP-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation by promoting the autophagic 
degradation of NF-κB, resulting in the downregulation of pro-IL-1β and NLRP3. 
The anti-NLRP3 inflammasome effect of FXN was reversed when autophagy was 
inhibited by either genetic knockdown of the PRKAA2 pathway or pharmacological 
inhibition with bafilomycin A1. Furthermore, FXN treatment led to improved AD 
pathology in 5XFAD mice, resulting in significant improvements in various 
behavioral parameters such as working memory and neuromuscular coordination, 
making their behavior more similar to that of wild-type animals. FXN improved 
behavior in 5XFAD mice by clearing the Aβ deposits from the hippocampi and 
significantly reducing multiple inflammatory proteins, including NF-κB, GFAP, 
IBA1, IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6, which are associated with NF-κB and NLRP3 
inflammasome in the brain. Moreover, these changes were accompanied by increased 
expression of autophagic proteins.
DISCUSSION: Our data suggest that FXN ameliorates AD pathology, by 
simultaneously targeting two key pathological features: Aβ deposits and 
neuroinflammation. As an already approved drug, FXN holds potential as a 
candidate for human studies against AD.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other forms of dementia have a 
devastating effect on the community and healthcare system, as neurodegenerative 
diseases are causing disability and dependency in older population. 
Pharmacological treatment options are limited to symptomatic alleviation of 
cholinergic deficit and accelerated clearance of β-amyloid aggregates, but 
accessible disease-modifying interventions are needed especially in the early 
phase of AD. Melatonin was previously demonstrated to improve cognitive function 
in clinical setting and experimental studies also.
METHODS: In this study, the influence of melatonin supplementation was studied 
on behavioral parameters and morphological aspects of the hippocampus and 
amygdala of rats. Streptozotocin (STZ) was injected intracerebroventricularly to 
induce AD-like symptoms in male adult Wistar rats (n = 18) which were compared 
to age-matched, sham-operated animals (n = 16). Melatonin was administered once 
daily in a dose of 20 mg/kg body weight by oral route. Behavioral analysis 
included open-field, novel object recognition, and radial-arm maze tests. TNF-α 
and MMP-9 levels were determined from blood samples to assess the 
anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects of melatonin. Immunohistological 
staining of brain sections was performed using anti-NeuN, anti-IBA-1, and 
anti-GFAP primary antibodies to evaluate the cellular reorganization of 
hippocampus.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The results show that after 40 days of treatment, 
melatonin improved the cognitive performance of STZ-induced rats and reduced the 
activation of microglia in both CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus. 
STZ-injected animals had higher levels of GFAP-labeled astrocytes in the CA1 
region, but melatonin treatment reduced this to that of the control group. In 
conclusion, melatonin may be a potential therapeutic option for treating AD-like 
cognitive decline and neuroinflammation.

Stem cell therapy (SCT) is a promising solution for addressing health challenges 
in Africa, particularly non-communicable diseases (NCDs). With their 
regenerative potential, stem cells have the inherent capacity to differentiate 
into numerous cell types for tissue repair. Despite infrastructural, ethical, 
and legal challenges, SCT holds immense promise for managing chronic illnesses 
and deep-seated tissue injuries. The rising prevalence of NCDs in Africa 
highlights the need for innovative strategies and treatment options. SCT offers 
hope in combating conditions like burns, osteoarthritis, diabetes, Alzheimer's 
disease, stroke, heart failure and cancer, potentially reducing the burden of 
NCDs on the continent. Despite SCT's opportunities in Africa, there are 
significant obstacles. However, published research on SCT in Africa is scarce, 
but recent initiatives such as the Basic School on Neural Stem Cells (NSC) 
express interest in developing NSC research in Africa. SCT research in African 
regions, notably on neurogenesis, demonstrates a concentration on studying 
neurological processes in indigenous settings. While progress has been made in 
South Africa and Nigeria, issues such as brain drain and impediments to 
innovation remain. Clinical trials have investigated the efficacy of stem cell 
treatments, emphasising both potential benefits and limitations in implementing 
these therapies efficiently. Financing research, developing regulatory 
frameworks, and resolving affordability concerns are critical steps toward 
realizing the potential of stem cell treatment in Africa.

Tissue-resident macrophages and recruited macrophages play pivotal roles in 
innate immunity and the maintenance of brain homeostasis. Investigating the 
involvement of these macrophage populations in eliciting pathological changes 
associated with neurodegenerative diseases has been a focal point of research. 
Dysregulated states of macrophages can compromise clearance mechanisms for 
pathological proteins such as amyloid-β (Aβ) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 
TDP-43 in Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Additionally, recent evidence 
suggests that abnormalities in the peripheral clearance of pathological proteins 
are implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of neurodegenerative 
diseases. Furthermore, numerous genome-wide association studies have linked 
genetic risk factors, which alter the functionality of various immune cells, to 
the accumulation of pathological proteins. This review aims to unravel the 
intricacies of macrophage biology in both homeostatic conditions and 
neurodegenerative disorders. To this end, we initially provide an overview of 
the modifications in receptor and gene expression observed in diverse macrophage 
subsets throughout development. Subsequently, we outlined the roles of resident 
macrophages and recruited macrophages in neurodegenerative diseases and the 
progress of targeted therapy. Finally, we describe the latest advances in 
macrophage imaging methods and measurement of inflammation, which may provide 
information and related treatment strategies that hold promise for informing the 
design of future investigations and therapeutic interventions.

BACKGROUND: Gender is a significant risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), often attributed to the decline of estrogen. The plant estrogen 
secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) has demonstrated anti-inflammatory and 
neuroprotective effects. However, the protective effects and mechanisms of SDG 
in female AD remain unclear.
METHODS: Ten-month-old female APPswe/PSEN1dE9 (APP/PS1) transgenic mice were 
treated with SDG to assess its potential ameliorative effects on cognitive 
impairments in a female AD model through a series of behavioral and biochemical 
experiments. Serum levels of gut microbial metabolites enterodiol (END) and 
enterolactone (ENL) were quantified using HPLC-MS. Correlation analysis and 
broad-spectrum antibiotic cocktail (ABx) treatment were employed to demonstrate 
the involvement of END and ENL in SDG's cognitive improvement effects in female 
APP/PS1 mice. Additionally, an acute neuroinflammation model was constructed in 
three-month-old C57BL/6J mice treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and 
subjected to i.c.v. injection of G15, an inhibitor of G protein-coupled estrogen 
receptor (GPER), to investigate the mediating role of the estrogen receptor GPER 
in the cognitive benefits conferred by SDG.
RESULTS: SDG administration resulted in significant improvements in spatial, 
recognition, and working memory in female APP/PS1 mice. Neuroprotective effects 
were observed, including enhanced expression of CREB/BDNF and PSD-95, reduced 
β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition, and decreased levels of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10. SDG 
also altered gut microbiota composition, increasing serum levels of END and ENL. 
Correlation analysis indicated significant associations between END, ENL, 
cognitive performance, hippocampal Aβ-related protein mRNA expression, and 
cortical neuroinflammatory cytokine levels. The removal of gut microbiota 
inhibited END and ENL production and eliminated the neuroprotective effects of 
SDG. Furthermore, GPER was found to mediate the inhibitory effects of SDG on 
neuroinflammatory responses.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that SDG promotes the production of gut 
microbial metabolites END and ENL, which inhibit cerebral β-amyloid deposition, 
activate GPER to enhance CREB/BDNF signaling pathways, and suppress 
neuroinflammatory responses. Consequently, SDG exerts neuroprotective effects 
and ameliorates cognitive impairments associated with AD in female mice.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease that is 
characterized by memory loss and cognitive impairment. Evidence shows that 
depression is a common co-occurrence in AD patients, and major depressive 
disorder (MDD) is considered a risk factor for AD. The crosstalk between the 
biological procedures related to the two disorders makes it very difficult to 
treat the comorbid conditions caused by them. Considering the common 
pathophysiological mechanisms underlying AD and MDD, antidepressant drugs may 
have beneficial therapeutic effects against their concurrence. In this study, we 
aimed to explore the potential drug candidates for the prevention and treatment 
of the comorbidity of AD and MDD. First, we screened the potential drugs for 
treating MDD by evaluating the distances of drug targets to MDD-related genes on 
the human protein-protein interaction network (PPIN) via a network-based 
algorithm. Then, the drugs were further screened to identify those that may be 
effective for AD treatment by analyzing their affinities with tau protein and 
Aβ42 peptide via molecular docking. Furthermore, the most stable binding modes 
were identified via molecular dynamics simulations, and the regulatory effects 
of drug candidates on genes involved in the pathogenesis of AD and MDD were 
analyzed. A total of 506 MDD-related genes were retrieved, and 831 drug 
candidates for MDD treatment were screened via the network-based approach. The 
results from molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations indicated 
dihydroergotamine had the lowest binding affinity with tau protein and 
bromocriptine could form the most stable binding mode with Aβ42 peptide. Further 
analyses found that both dihydroergotamine and bromocriptine could regulate the 
expression of genes involved in the pathogenesis of AD and/or MDD in the brain. 
The exact mechanisms of the two drugs in treating AD and MDD, as well as their 
comorbidity, are still unclear, and further exploration is needed to evaluate 
their roles and mechanisms, both in vitro and in vivo. This study revealed that 
dihydroergotamine and bromocriptine may be the potential drug candidates for the 
treatment of the comorbidity of AD and MDD, and the therapeutic effects may be 
achieved by inhibiting the accumulation and aggregation of Aβ42 and tau protein 
and regulating the expression of disease-related genes in the brain.

There is an increasing amount of evidence that biomolecular condensates are 
linked to neurodegenerative diseases associated with protein aggregation, such 
as Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, although the 
mechanisms underlying this link remain elusive. In this Review, we summarize the 
possible connections between condensates and protein aggregation. We consider 
both liquid-to-solid transitions of phase-separated proteins and the 
partitioning of proteins into host condensates. We distinguish five key factors 
by which the physical and chemical environment of a condensate can influence 
protein aggregation, and we discuss their relevance in studies of protein 
aggregation in the presence of biomolecular condensates: increasing the local 
concentration of proteins, providing a distinct chemical microenvironment, 
introducing an interface wherein proteins can localize, changing the energy 
landscape of aggregation pathways, and the presence of chaperones in 
condensates. Analysing the role of biomolecular condensates in protein 
aggregation may be essential for a full understanding of amyloid formation and 
offers a new perspective that can help in developing new therapeutic strategies 
for the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is closely associated with the neurotoxic effects of 
amyloid-β (Aβ), leading to synaptic damage, neuronal loss and cognitive 
dysfunction. Previous in vitro studies have demonstrated the potential of 
corilagin to counteract Aβ-induced oxidative stress, inflammatory injury, and 
β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE1) activity in Aβ 
production. However, the in vivo protective effects of corilagin on Alzheimer's 
disease remain unexplored. The purpose of this study was to investigate the 
protective effects of corilagin on APP/PS1 mice and the underlying mechanisms. 
The cognitive function of the mice was assessed by step-through passive 
avoidance and Morris water maze tests. Nissl staining was used to evaluate 
neuronal damage in the hippocampus. ELISA and Western blotting analyses were 
used to determine the associated protein expression. Transmission electron 
microscopy was utilized to observe the synaptic ultrastructure of hippocampal 
neurons. Golgi staining was applied to assess dendritic morphology and dendritic 
spine density in hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Immunohistochemistry and Western 
blotting were performed to examine the expression of synaptic-associated 
proteins. The results showed that corilagin improves learning and memory in 
APP/PS1 mice, reduces hippocampal neuron damage, inhibits BACE1 and reduces Aβ 
generation. It also improves synaptic plasticity and the expression of 
synaptic-associated proteins. Corilagin effectively reduces Aβ generation by 
inhibiting BACE1, ultimately reducing neuronal loss and enhancing synaptic 
plasticity to improve synaptic transmission. This study sheds light on the 
potential therapeutic role of corilagin in Alzheimer's disease.

Accumulation in the brain of amyloid-β (Aβ), derived from cleavage of Aβ 
precursor protein (APP), is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Oleanonic 
acid (OA), a phytochemical from several plants, has proven anti-inflammatory 
effects, but its role in AD remains unknown. Here we found that OA reduced APP 
expression and inhibited oxidative stress via Nrf2/HO-1 signaling in SH-SY5Y 
neuroblastoma cells stably overexpressing APP. OA suppressed phosphorylated mTOR 
but increased autophagy markers ATG5 and LC3-II. Moreover, OA rescued 
ferroptosis-related factors GPX4, NCOA, and COX2 and ER stress markers GRP78, 
CHOP, and three main induction pathways of ER stress including IRE1/XBP1s, 
PERK/EIF2α, and ATF6. OA alleviated mitochondrial damage through MFN1, MFN2, 
OPA1, FIS1, and DRP1. Furthermore, OA upregulated GDF11 expression and 
downregulated phosphorylation of ErbB4 and TrkB without affecting BDNF levels. 
Thus, OA might protect neurons from APP-induced neurotoxicity by inhibiting 
oxidative stress, autophagy deficits, ferroptosis, mitochondrial damage, and ER 
stress in AD, providing a new promising therapeutic strategy in patients with 
AD.

In general, Cu(II) is the critical factor in catalyzing reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) production and accelerating amyloid-β (Aβ) oligomer formation in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Natural chelating agents with good biocompatibility 
and appropriate binding affinity with Cu(II) have emerged as potential 
candidates for AD therapy. Herein, we tested the capability of guluronic acid 
disaccharide (Di-GA), a natural chelating agent with the moderate association 
affinity to Cu(II), in inhibiting ROS production and Aβ oligomer formation. The 
results showed that Di-GA was capable of chelating with Cu(II) and reducing ROS 
production, even in solutions containing Fe(II), Zn(II), and Aβ. In addition, 
Di-GA can also capture Cu(II) from Cu-Aβ complexes and decrease Aβ oligomer 
formation. The cellular results confirmed that Di-GA prevented SH-SY5Y cells 
from ROS and Aβ oligomer damage by reducing the injury of ROS and Aβ oligomers 
on cell membrane and decreasing their intracellular damage on mitochondria. 
Notably, the slightly higher efficiency of Di-GA in chelating with Cu(I) than 
Cu(II) can be benefit for its in vivo applications, as Cu(I) is not only the 
most active but also the special intermediate specie during ROS production 
process. All of these results proved that Di-GA could be a promising marine drug 
candidate in reducing copper-related ROS damage and Aβ oligomer toxicity 
associated with AD.

Pomegranate polyphenol ellagic acid has medicinal potential in neurodegenerative 
disorders. The advantageous effect of this polyphenol in improving cognition in 
okadaic acid (OA)-instigated murine model with unraveling some modes of its 
action was assessed. Rats received ICV okadaic acid (OA) and post-treated with 
oral ellagic acid for 3 weeks (25 and 100 mg/kg/day). Cognition was analyzed in 
behavioral tasks besides assessment of oxidative, apoptotic, and inflammatory 
factors in addition to hippocampal histochemical analysis. Ellagic acid at a 
dose of 100 mg/kg properly attenuated cognitive abnormalities in novel object 
recognition (NOR), Y maze, and Barnes maze tests. Additionally, ellagic acid 
diminished hippocampal changes of malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyl, 
reactive oxygen species (ROS), glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase, 
superoxide dismutase (SOD), apoptotic factors caspases 1 and 3, tumor necrosis 
factor α (TNFα), and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and beta secretase 1 (BACE 1) 
besides reversal of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and hyperphosphorylated 
tau (p-tau). Moreover, lower glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and less 
injury of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons were observed upon ellagic acid. To 
conclude, neuroprotective potential of ellagic acid was shown which is somewhat 
attributable to its reversal of oxidative, apoptotic, and neuroinflammatory 
events in addition to proper regulation of AMPK and p-tau.

BACKGROUND: Levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) is a common adverse effect of 
levodopa, one of the main therapeutics used to treat the motor symptoms of 
Parkinson's disease (PD). Previous evidence suggests a connection between LID 
and a disruption of the dopaminergic system as well as genes implicated in PD, 
including GBA1 and LRRK2.
OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to investigate the effects of genetic variants on risk 
and time to LID.
METHODS: We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and analyses 
focused on GBA1 and LRRK2 variants. We also calculated polygenic risk scores 
(PRS) including risk variants for PD and variants in genes involved in the 
dopaminergic transmission pathway. To test the influence of genetics on LID risk 
we used logistic regression, and to examine its impact on time to LID we 
performed Cox regression including 1612 PD patients with and 3175 without LID.
RESULTS: We found that GBA1 variants were associated with LID risk (odds ratio 
[OR] = 1.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.21-2.26; P = 0.0017) and LRRK2 
variants with reduced time to LID onset (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.42; 95% 
CI, 1.09-1.84; P = 0.0098). The fourth quartile of the PD PRS was associated 
with increased LID risk (ORfourth_quartile = 1.27; 95% CI, 1.03-1.56; 
P = 0.0210). The third and fourth dopamine pathway PRS quartiles were associated 
with a reduced time to development of LID (HRthird_quartile = 1.38; 95% 
CI, 1.07-1.79; P = 0.0128; HRfourth_quartile = 1.38; 95% CI = 1.06-1.78; 
P = 0.0147).
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that variants implicated in PD and in the 
dopaminergic transmission pathway play a role in the risk/time to develop LID. 
Further studies will be necessary to examine how these findings can inform 
clinical care. © 2024 The Author(s). Movement Disorders published by Wiley

Pyroglutamate (pE)-modified amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides play a crucial role in the 
development of Alzheimer's disease. pEAβ3-42 can rapidly form oligomers that 
gradually elongate hydrophobic segments to form β-sheet-rich amyloid 
intermediates, ultimately resulting in the formation of mature amyloid fibrils. 
pEAβ3-42 can also catalyze the aggregation of Aβ species and subsequently 
accelerate the formation of amyloid senile plaques. Considering the recent 
clinical success of the pEAβ3-42-targeting antibody donanemab, molecules that 
strongly bind pEAβ3-42 and prevent its aggregation and catalytic effect on Aβs 
may also provide potential therapeutic options for Alzheimer's disease. Here, we 
demonstrate that the natural antibiotic cyclopeptide tyrocidine A (TA) not only 
strongly inhibits the aggregation of Aβ1-42 as previously reported, but also 
interacts with the hydrophobic C-terminus and middle domain of pEAβ3-42 to 
maintain an unordered conformation, effectively impeding the formation of 
initial oligomers and subsequently halting the aggregation of pEAβ3-42. 
Furthermore, TA can disrupt the "catalytic effect" of pEAβ3-42 on amyloid 
aggregates, effectively suppressing Aβ aggregation and ultimately preventing the 
pathological events induced by Aβs.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The risk of cognitive impairment is higher in people with CKD 
than in the general population. The complex relationship between CKD and 
cognitive dysfunction has not been extensively characterized. Here, we review 
epidemiological associations, specific patterns of CKD-related cognitive 
impairment, the underlying mechanisms, and recently published data on relevant 
biomarkers.
RECENT FINDINGS: Despite some discrepancies, recent published studies have 
confirmed that CKD is associated with cognitive function (e.g. incident 
cognitive events). Although patients with CKD often exhibit impairments in 
executive functions and attention, it is noteworthy that other cognitive 
functions (e.g. memory) can be preserved. The key mechanisms described recently 
include vascular damage, genetic factors, the accumulation of uremic toxins, 
disruption of the blood-brain barrier, glymphatic system dysfunction, and 
changes in the gut-brain axis. Kidney function is increasingly seen as a game 
changer in the interpretation of biomarkers of cognitive impairment and, 
especially, hallmarks of Alzheimer disease.
SUMMARY: The data reviewed here highlight the need for interdisciplinary 
collaboration between nephrologists and neurologists in the care of patients 
with CKD at risk of cognitive impairment. In order to further improving 
diagnosis and therapy, future research must elucidate the mechanisms underlying 
the CKD-cognitive impairment association and confirm the value of biomarkers.

INTRODUCTION: Chronic air pollution (AirPoll) is associated with accelerated 
cognitive decline and risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Correspondingly, 
wild-type and AD-transgenic rodents exposed to AirPoll have increased amyloid 
peptides and behavioral impairments.
METHODS: We examined the γ-secretase modulator GSM-15606 for potential AirPoll 
protection by its attenuating of amyloid beta (Aβ)42 peptide production. Male 
and female wild-type mice were fed GSM-15606 during an 8-week inhalation 
exposure to AirPoll subfractions, ambient nanoparticulate matter (nPM), and 
diesel exhaust particles (DEP).
RESULTS: GSM-15606 decreased Aβ42 during nPM and DEP exposure without changing 
beta- or gamma-secretase activity or BACE1 and PS1 protein levels. DEP increased 
lateral ventricle volume by 25%.
DISCUSSION: These enzyme responses are relevant to AD drug treatments, as well 
as to the physiological functions of the Aβ42 peptide. GSM-15606 attenuation of 
Aβ42 may benefit human exposure to AirPoll.
HIGHLIGHTS: Gamma-secretase modulator (GSM-15606) attenuates the amyloidogenic 
amyloid beta (Aβ)42 peptide during exposure to air pollution, which may be a 
mechanism by which air pollution increases Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk. AD 
drug treatments may also consider Aβ homeostasis among the chronic effects of 
GSM-15606 and other amyloid reduction treatments on secretase enzymes.

INTRODUCTION: Sodium phenylbutyrate and taurursodiol (PB and TURSO) is 
hypothesized to mitigate endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial 
dysfunction, two of many mechanisms implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
pathophysiology.
METHODS: The first-in-indication phase 2a PEGASUS trial was designed to gain 
insight into PB and TURSO effects on mechanistic targets of engagement and 
disease biology in AD. The primary clinical efficacy outcome was a global 
statistical test combining three endpoints relevant to disease trajectory 
(cognition [Mild/Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Composite Score], function 
[Functional Activities Questionnaire], and total hippocampal volume on magnetic 
resonance imaging). Secondary clinical outcomes included various cognitive, 
functional, and neuropsychiatric assessments. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
biomarkers spanning multiple pathophysiological pathways in AD were evaluated in 
participants with both baseline and Week 24 samples (exploratory outcome).
RESULTS: PEGASUS enrolled 95 participants (intent-to-treat [ITT] cohort); 
cognitive assessments indicated significantly greater baseline cognitive 
impairment in the PB and TURSO (n = 51) versus placebo (n = 44) group. Clinical 
efficacy outcomes did not significantly differ between treatment groups in the 
ITT cohort. CSF interleukin-15 increased from baseline to Week 24 within the 
placebo group (n = 34). In the PB and TURSO group (n = 33), reductions were 
observed in core AD biomarkers phosphorylated tau-181 (p-tau181) and total tau; 
synaptic and neuronal degeneration biomarkers neurogranin and fatty acid binding 
protein-3 (FABP3); and gliosis biomarker chitinase 3-like protein 1 (YKL-40), 
while the oxidative stress marker 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) increased. 
Between-group differences were observed for the Aβ42/40 ratio, p-tau181, total 
tau, neurogranin, FABP3, YKL-40, interleukin-15, and 8-OHdG. Additional 
neurodegeneration, inflammation, and metabolic biomarkers showed no differences 
between groups.
DISCUSSION: While between-group differences in clinical outcomes were not 
observed, most likely due to the small sample size and relatively short 
treatment duration, exploratory biomarker analyses suggested that PB and TURSO 
engages multiple pathophysiologic pathways in AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: Proteostasis and mitochondrial stress play key roles in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD).Sodium phenylbutyrate and taurursodiol (PB and TURSO) targets these 
mechanisms.The PEGASUS trial was designed to assess PB and TURSO effects on 
biologic AD targets.PB and TURSO reduced exploratory biomarkers of AD and 
neurodegeneration.Supports further clinical development of PB and TURSO in 
neurodegenerative diseases.

Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly, 
prompting extensive efforts to pinpoint novel therapeutic targets for effective 
intervention. Among the hallmark features of Alzheimer's disease is the 
development of neurofibrillary tangles comprised of hyperphosphorylated tau 
protein, whose progressive spread throughout the brain is associated with 
neuronal death. Trans-synaptic propagation of tau has been observed in mouse 
models, and indirect evidence for tau spread via synapses has been observed in 
human Alzheimer's disease. Halting tau propagation is a promising therapeutic 
target for Alzheimer's disease; thus, a scalable model system to screen for 
modifiers of tau spread would be very useful for the field. To this end, we 
sought to emulate the trans-synaptic spread of human tau in Drosophila 
melanogaster. Employing the trans-Tango circuit mapping technique, we 
investigated whether tau spreads between synaptically connected neurons. 
Immunohistochemistry and confocal imaging were used to look for tau propagation. 
Examination of hundreds of flies expressing four different human tau constructs 
in two distinct neuronal populations reveals a robust resistance in Drosophila 
to the trans-synaptic spread of human tau. This resistance persisted in lines 
with concurrent expression of amyloid-β, in lines with global human tau knock-in 
to provide a template for human tau in downstream neurons, and with 
manipulations of temperature. These negative data are important for the field as 
we establish that Drosophila expressing human tau in subsets of neurons are 
unlikely to be useful to perform screens to find mechanisms to reduce the 
trans-synaptic spread of tau. The inherent resistance observed in Drosophila may 
serve as a valuable clue, offering insights into strategies for impeding tau 
spread in future studies.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative 
disorder characterized by cognitive decline, behavioral changes, and functional 
impairments. Apathy, a common symptom in Alzheimer's disease, refers to a lack 
of motivation, interest, and emotional responsiveness. It can significantly 
impact patients' quality of life and increase caregiver burden. This study aimed 
to determine the effects of a diversified rehabilitation program combined with 
donepezil on apathy, cognitive function, and family caregiver burden of 
Alzheimer's disease patients.
METHODS: A total of 105 Alzheimer's disease patients treated at our hospital 
between January 2020 and January 2023 were selected and analyzed 
retrospectively. They were assigned to the control group (n = 50) or the 
observation group (n = 55). The two groups did not differ in terms of general 
data such as age and sex. All patients were treated with donepezil orally. The 
control group was given routine nursing, whereas the observation group was given 
a diversified rehabilitation program intervention, including cognitive training 
and emotional support. The Hasegawa's dementia scale, mini-mental state 
examination, and Montreal cognitive assessment scale were adopted to evaluate 
the cognitive function of the two groups before and after treatment. A caregiver 
burden scale, the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) and the Apathy Evaluation Scale 
Informant version (AES-I) were used to evaluate the caregiver burden and apathy 
of the two groups.
RESULTS: A significantly higher overall response rate to treatment was found in 
the observation group (94.55%) than in the control group (80.00%) (p = 0.024). 
After treatment, scores on the Hasegawa's dementia scale, mini-mental state 
examination, and Montreal cognitive assessment scale of the two groups increased 
to varying degrees, with greater increases in the observation group than in the 
control group (p < 0.05). The ZBI and AES-I scores of the two groups decreased 
to different degrees after treatment, with greater decreases in the observation 
group than in the control group (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: A diversified rehabilitation program combined with donepezil can 
substantially alleviate the apathy of Alzheimer's disease patients, improve 
their cognitive function, and reduce the burden on their families.

The aggregation of amyloid β (Aβ) peptides is a significant hallmark of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the detection of Aβ aggregates and the inhibition 
of their formation are important for the diagnosis and treatment of AD, 
respectively. Herein, we report a series of benzothiazole-based Ir(III) 
complexes HN-1 to HN-8 that exhibit appreciable inhibition of Aβ aggregation in 
vitro and in living cells. These Ir(III) complexes can induce a significant 
fluorescence increase when binding to Aβ fibrils and Aβ oligomers, while their 
measured log D values suggest these compounds could have enhanced blood-brain 
barrier (BBB) permeability. In vivo studies show that HN-1, HN-2, HN-3, and HN-8 
successfully penetrate the BBB and stain the amyloid plaques in AD mouse brains 
after a 10-day treatment, suggesting that these Ir(III) complexes could act as 
lead compounds for AD therapeutic and diagnostic agent development.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis is complex. The 
pathophysiology is not fully understood, and safe and effective treatments are 
needed. Glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) mediates AD progression through 
several signaling pathways. Recently, several studies have found that various 
natural compounds from herbs and nutraceuticals can significantly improve AD 
symptoms.
AIMS: This review aims to provide a comprehensive summary of the potential 
neuroprotective impacts of natural compounds as inhibitors of GSK-3β in the 
treatment of AD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search on PubMed, 
ScienceDirect, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, focusing on in vitro and 
in vivo studies that investigated natural compounds as inhibitors of GSK-3β in 
the treatment of AD.
RESULTS: The mechanism may be related to GSK-3β activation inhibition to 
regulate amyloid beta production, tau protein hyperphosphorylation, cell 
apoptosis, and cellular inflammation. By reviewing recent studies on GSK-3β 
inhibition in phytochemicals and AD intervention, flavonoids including oxyphylla 
A, quercetin, morin, icariin, linarin, genipin, and isoorientin were reported as 
potent GSK-3β inhibitors for AD treatment. Polyphenols such as schisandrin B, 
magnolol, and dieckol have inhibitory effects on GSK-3β in AD models, including 
in vivo models. Sulforaphene, ginsenoside Rd, gypenoside XVII, falcarindiol, 
epibrassinolides, 1,8-Cineole, and andrographolide are promising GSK-3β 
inhibitors.
CONCLUSIONS: Natural compounds from herbs and nutraceuticals are potential 
candidates for AD treatment. They may qualify as derivatives for development as 
promising compounds that provide enhanced pharmacological characteristics.

INTRODUCTION: Dietary patterns are associated with dementia risk, but the 
underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown.
METHODS: We used RNA sequencing data from post mortem prefrontal cortex tissue 
and annual cognitive evaluations from 1204 participants in the Religious Orders 
Study and Memory and Aging Project. We identified a transcriptomic profile 
correlated with the MIND diet (Mediterranean-Dietary Approaches to Stop 
Hypertension Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay) among 482 individuals who 
completed ante mortem food frequency questionnaires; and examined its 
associations with cognitive health in the remaining 722 participants.
RESULTS: We identified a transcriptomic profile, consisting of 50 genes, 
correlated with the MIND diet score (p = 0.001). Each standard deviation 
increase in the transcriptomic profile score was associated with a slower annual 
rate of decline in global cognition (β = 0.011, p = 0.003) and lower odds of 
dementia (odds ratio = 0.76, p = 0.0002). Expressions of several genes 
(including TCIM and IGSF5) appeared to mediate the association between MIND diet 
and dementia.
DISCUSSION: A brain transcriptomic profile for healthy diets revealed novel 
genes potentially associated with cognitive health.
HIGHLIGHTS: Why healthy dietary patterns are associated with lower dementia risk 
are unknown. We integrated dietary, brain transcriptomic, and cognitive data in 
older adults. Mediterranean-Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Intervention 
for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet intake is correlated with a specific 
brain transcriptomic profile. This brain transcriptomic profile score is 
associated with better cognitive health. More data are needed to elucidate the 
causality and functionality of identified genes.

PURPOSE: Post-stroke (PS) cognitive impairment (CI) is frequent and its 
devastating functional and vital consequences are well known. Despite recent 
guidelines, they are still largely neglected. A large number of recent studies 
have re-examined the epidemiology, diagnosis, imaging determinants and 
management of PSCI. The aim of this update is to determine whether these new 
data answer the questions that are essential to reducing PSCI, the unmet needs, 
and steps still to be taken.
METHODS: Literature review of stroke unit-era studies examining key steps in the 
management of PSCI: epidemiology and risk factors, diagnosis (cognitive profile 
and assessments), imaging determinants (quantitative measures, voxelwise 
localization, the disconnectome and associated Alzheimer's disease [AD]) and 
treatment (secondary prevention, symptomatic drugs, rehabilitation and 
noninvasive brain stimulation) of PSCI.
FINDINGS: (1) the prevalence of PSCI of approximately 50% is probably 
underestimated; (2) the sensitivity of screening tests should be improved to 
detect mild PSCI; (3) comprehensive assessment is now well-defined and should 
include apathy; (4) easily available factors can identify patients at high risk 
of PSCI; (5) key imaging determinants are the location and volume of the lesion 
and the resulting disconnection, associated AD and brain atrophy; WMH, ePVS, 
microhemorrhages, hemosiderosis, and cortical microinfarcts may contribute to 
cognitive impairment but are more likely to be markers of brain vulnerability or 
associated AD that reduce PS recovery; (6) remote and online assessment is a 
promising approach for selected patients; (7) secondary stroke prevention has 
not been proven to prevent PSCI; (8) symptomatic drugs are ineffective in 
treating PSCI and apathy; (9) in addition to cognitive rehabilitation, the 
benefits of training platforms and computerized training are yet to be 
documented; (10) the results and the magnitude of improvement of noninvasive 
brain stimulation, while very promising, need to be substantiated by large, 
high-quality, sham-controlled RCTs.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: These major advances pave the way for the reduction 
of PSCI. They include (1) the development of more sensitive screening tests 
applicable to all patients and (2) online remote assessment; crossvalidation of 
(3) clinical and (4) imaging factors to (5) identify patients at risk, as well 
as (6) factors that prompt a search for associated AD; (7) the inclusion of 
cognitive outcome as a secondary endpoint in acute and secondary stroke 
prevention trials; and (8) the validation of the benefit of noninvasive brain 
stimulation through high-quality, randomized, sham-controlled trials. Many of 
these objectives can be rapidly and easily attained.

INTRODUCTION: In older adults, where sleep disturbances and cognitive impairment 
are common, mounting evidence suggests a potential connection between sleep and 
cognitive function, highlighting the significance of utilizing sleep as a 
biomarker for early detection of cognitive impairment to improve clinical 
outcomes in a noninvasive, cost-effective manner.
AREAS COVERED: This review describes the relationship between sleep and 
cognitive function in older adults, encompassing both subjective and objective 
measures of sleep quality, duration, architecture, and sleep-disordered 
breathing. The authors consider the directionality of the associations observed 
in prospective and cross-sectional studies, exploring whether sleep disturbances 
precede cognitive decline or vice versa. Furthermore, they discuss the potential 
bidirectional relationships between sleep and Alzheimer's disease (AD) risks in 
older adults while also examining the neurodegenerative pathways of this 
relationship.
EXPERT OPINION: Routine sleep monitoring in primary care settings has the 
potential to bolster early detection and treatment of sleep disturbance, and by 
extension, reduce the risk of dementia. Improving sleep assessment tools, such 
as wearables, provide scalable alternatives to traditional methods like 
polysomnography, potentially enabling widespread monitoring of sleep 
characteristics. Standardized measurement and inclusive participant recruitment 
are needed to enhance generalizability, while longitudinal studies are essential 
to understand the interaction between sleep and AD pathology.

High mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1) acts as a pathogenic inflammatory 
response to mediate ranges of conditions such as epilepsy, septic shock, 
ischemia, traumatic brain injury, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and 
mass spectrometry. HMGB1 promotes inflammation during sterile and infectious 
damage and plays a crucial role in disease development. Mobilization from the 
nucleus to the cytoplasm is the first important step in the release of HMGB1 
from activated immune cells. Here, we demonstrated that Sirtuin 2 (SIRT2) 
physically interacts with and deacetylates HMGB1 at 43 lysine residue at nuclear 
localization signal locations, strengthening its interaction with HMGB1 and 
causing HMGB1 to be localized in the cytoplasm. These discoveries are the first 
to shed light on the SIRT2 nucleoplasmic shuttle, which influences HMGB1 and its 
degradation, hence revealing novel therapeutic targets and avenues for 
neuroinflammation treatment.

The impact of peptic ulcer disease (PUD) and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) 
eradication therapy on dementia risk in high H. pylori prevalence populations 
remains uncertain. This study investigates the relationship between PUD, H. 
pylori eradication, and dementia risk, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), in an 
elderly South Korean cohort, considering age and eradication timing. Data from 
the Korean National Health Insurance Service (2002-2015) for individuals aged 
55-79 were analyzed. Participants were divided based on PUD and H. pylori 
therapy status. Propensity score matching was used to evaluate dementia 
incidence and hazard ratios over 5 and 10 years, alongside the timing of 
eradication therapy. PUD is linked to higher dementia risk at 5 and 10 years, 
more for overall dementia than AD, with eradication status not significantly 
altering the risk. Age-specific analysis showed increased AD risk in the 60s and 
70s age groups. Late eradication therapy is correlated with a higher dementia 
risk. PUD is a risk factor for dementia in elderly South Koreans, particularly 
with delayed H. pylori therapy. The findings emphasize timely H. pylori 
management and its potential role in neurodegenerative disease prevention.

Fatigue is a common and distressful symptom in older people and has been 
associated with adverse health outcomes. Nevertheless, its sex-specific 
pathophysiological underpinnings and clinical correlates have been scarcely 
investigated. We aimed to comprehensively explore the clinical and 
neurobiological determinants of fatigue in cognitively unimpaired older adults. 
A sex-stratified analysis was conducted to look for differences in the clinical 
expression of fatigue among women and men. Data on cognitively normal 
individuals were gathered from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) 2 study. Fatigue was defined based on self-report at baseline. For each 
participant, information on sociodemographics, comorbidities, mood, cognitive 
performance, frailty, and biomarkers of brain pathology was collected. Logistic 
regression models, stratified by sex, were conducted to explore the factors 
associated with fatigue. Among the 291 participants selected, 44 subjects (15.1% 
of the total sample) self-reported fatigue at baseline. Subjects reporting 
fatigue were more likely women, had higher frailty degrees, and more severe 
depressive symptoms than those without fatigue. Moreover, they tended to have 
lower MRI hippocampus volumes. Among women, those reporting fatigue exhibited 
higher frailty levels, worse depression, and lower MRI hippocampus volumes 
relative to those without fatigue. Higher frailty degrees were also observed in 
men reporting vs. non-reporting fatigue. In the adjusted logistic regression 
model, more severe depression (OR 1.64, 95% CI 1.18-2.28; p < 0.01) and lower 
MRI hippocampus volumes (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.19-0.90; p = 0.03) resulted 
independently associated with fatigue in women, while higher frailty degrees (OR 
3.10, 95% CI 1.27-7.54 per 0.1 increase in a 39-item Frailty index; p = 0.01) in 
men. Fatigue is a complex symptom with a sex-specific pattern of clinical and 
neurobiological correlates. A better understanding of the underlying mechanisms 
of these associations is warranted to develop sex-informed approaches for 
personalized treatments.

BACKGROUND: We recently reported that the dopamine (DA) analogue CA140 modulates 
neuroinflammatory responses in lipopolysaccharide-injected wild-type (WT) mice 
and in 3-month-old 5xFAD mice, a model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the 
effects of CA140 on Aβ/tau pathology and synaptic/cognitive function and its 
molecular mechanisms of action are unknown.
METHODS: To investigate the effects of CA140 on cognitive and synaptic function 
and AD pathology, 3-month-old WT mice or 8-month-old (aged) 5xFAD mice were 
injected with vehicle (10% DMSO) or CA140 (30 mg/kg, i.p.) daily for 10, 14, or 
17 days. Behavioral tests, ELISA, electrophysiology, RNA sequencing, real-time 
PCR, Golgi staining, immunofluorescence staining, and western blotting were 
conducted.
RESULTS: In aged 5xFAD mice, a model of AD pathology, CA140 treatment 
significantly reduced Aβ/tau fibrillation, Aβ plaque number, tau 
hyperphosphorylation, and neuroinflammation by inhibiting NLRP3 activation. In 
addition, CA140 treatment downregulated the expression of cxcl10, a marker of 
AD-associated reactive astrocytes (RAs), and c1qa, a marker of the interaction 
of RAs with disease-associated microglia (DAMs) in 5xFAD mice. CA140 treatment 
also suppressed the mRNA levels of s100β and cxcl10, markers of AD-associated 
RAs, in primary astrocytes from 5xFAD mice. In primary microglial cells from 
5xFAD mice, CA140 treatment increased the mRNA levels of markers of homeostatic 
microglia (cx3cr1 and p2ry12) and decreased the mRNA levels of a marker of 
proliferative region-associated microglia (gpnmb) and a marker of 
lipid-droplet-accumulating microglia (cln3). Importantly, CA140 treatment 
rescued scopolamine (SCO)-mediated deficits in long-term memory, dendritic spine 
number, and LTP impairment. In aged 5xFAD mice, these effects of CA140 treatment 
on cognitive/synaptic function and AD pathology were regulated by dopamine D1 
receptor (DRD1)/Elk1 signaling. In primary hippocampal neurons and WT mice, 
CA140 treatment promoted long-term memory and dendritic spine formation via 
effects on DRD1/CaMKIIα and/or ERK signaling.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that CA140 improves 
neuronal/synaptic/cognitive function and ameliorates Aβ/tau pathology and 
neuroinflammation by modulating DRD1 signaling in primary hippocampal neurons, 
primary astrocytes/microglia, WT mice, and aged 5xFAD mice.

In the context of the escalating global health challenge posed by Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), this comprehensive review considers the potential of melatonin in 
both preventive and therapeutic capacities. As a naturally occurring hormone and 
robust antioxidant, accumulating evidence suggests melatonin is a compelling 
candidate to consider in the context of AD-related pathologies. The review 
considers several mechanisms, including potential effects on amyloid-beta and 
pathologic tau burden, antioxidant defense, immune modulation, and regulation of 
circadian rhythms. Despite its promise, several gaps need to be addressed prior 
to clinical translation. These include conducting additional randomized clinical 
trials in patients with or at risk for AD dementia, determining optimal dosage 
and timing, and further determining potential side effects, particularly of 
long-term use. This review consolidates existing knowledge, identifies gaps, and 
suggests directions for future research to better understand the potential of 
melatonin for neuroprotection and disease mitigation within the landscape of AD.

There are genetic and environmental risk factors that contribute to the 
development of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Some of these 
include the genetic predisposition of the apolipoprotein E4 genotype, consuming 
a high-fat diet (HFD), and the female sex. Brain insulin receptor resistance and 
deficiency have also been shown to be associated with AD and cognitive 
impairment. Intranasal (INL) insulin enhances cognition in AD, but the response 
varies due to genotype, diet, and sex. We investigated here the combination of 
these risk factors in a humanized mouse model, expressing E3 or E4, following a 
HFD in males and females on cognitive performance and the brain distribution of 
insulin following INL delivery. The HFD had a negative effect on survival in 
male mice only, requiring sex to be collapsed. We found many genotype, diet, and 
genotype x diet effects in anxiety-related tasks. We further found beneficial 
effects of INL insulin in our memory tests, with the most important findings 
showing a beneficial effect of INL insulin in mice on a HFD. We found insulin 
distribution throughout the brain after INL delivery was largely unaffected by 
diet and genotype, indicating these susceptible groups can still receive 
adequate levels of insulin following INL delivery. Our findings support the 
involvement of brain insulin signaling in cognition and highlight continuing 
efforts investigating mechanisms resulting from treatment with INL insulin.

There is insufficient data on systemic embolic events (SSEs) in patients with 
ischemic left ventricular aneurysm (LVA) concerning the impact of 
anticoagulation therapy. In this retrospective cohort study with 1043 patients 
with ischemic LVA, SSEs occurred in 7.2% over 2.4 years. After adjusting for 
relevant factors, the use of anticoagulants was independently associated with a 
lower incidence of SSE (3.1% vs. 9.0%, P < 0.001; subdistribution hazard ratios 
(SHR) 0.21, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.10-0.44, P < 0.001), with no 
significant difference in net adverse clinical events (NACEs) (10.6% vs. 13.3%, 
P = 0.225). Specifically, anticoagulation in patients with apical segment 
akinesis significantly reduced SSEs (3.9% vs. 13.6%, P = 0.002) and NACE rates 
(7.8% vs. 19.4%, P = 0.002). Major bleeding rates did not significantly differ 
between groups (5.6% vs. 3.5%, P = 0.111). These findings highlight the SSE risk 
in ischemic LVA and suggest potential benefits of anticoagulation, particularly 
in those with apical segment akinesis. These findings need to be validated in 
independent datasets.

Interferon beta (IFNβ) is a member of the type-1 interferon family and has 
various immunomodulatory functions in neuropathological conditions. Although the 
level of IFNβ is low under healthy conditions, it is increased during 
inflammatory processes to protect the central nervous system (CNS). In 
particular, microglia and astrocytes are the main sources of IFNβ upon 
inflammatory insult in the CNS. The protective effects of IFNβ are well 
characterized in reducing the progression of multiple sclerosis (MS); however, 
little is understood about its effects in other neurological/neurodegenerative 
diseases. In this review, different types of IFNs and their signaling pathways 
will be described. Then we will focus on the potential role and therapeutic 
effect of IFNβ in several CNS-related diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, 
Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 
stroke, spinal cord injury, prion disease and spinocerebellar ataxia 7.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia, leads to 
neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. We investigated the therapeutic effects 
of L-carnitine on cognitive performance and anxiety-like behavior in a rat model 
of AD induced by unilateral intracerebroventricular injection of β-amyloid1-42 
(Aβ1-42). L-carnitine (100 mg/kg/day) was administered intraperitoneally for 28 
consecutive days. Following this, the open-field test, novel object recognition 
test, elevated plus-maze test, Barnes maze test, and passive avoidance learning 
test were used to assess locomotor activity, recognition memory, anxiety-like 
behavior, spatial memory, and passive avoidance memory, respectively. Plasma and 
hippocampal oxidative stress markers, including total oxidant status (TOS) and 
total antioxidant capacity (TAC), were examined. In addition, histological 
investigations were performed in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus using 
Congo red staining and hematoxylin and eosin staining. The injection of Aβ1-42 
resulted in cognitive deficits and increased anxiety-like behavior. These 
changes were associated with an imbalance of oxidants and antioxidants in plasma 
and the hippocampus. Also, neuronal death and Aβ plaque accumulation were 
increased in the hippocampal dentate gyrus region. However, injection of 
L-carnitine improved recognition memory, spatial memory, and passive avoidance 
memory in AD rats. These findings provide evidence that L-carnitine may 
alleviate anxiety-like behavior and cognitive deficits induced by Aβ1-42 through 
modulating oxidative-antioxidant status and preventing Aβ plaque accumulation 
and neuronal death.

Mammalian flavoenzyme Monoamine oxidase (MAO) resides on the outer mitochondrial 
membrane (OMM) and it is involved in the metabolism of different monoamine 
neurotransmitters in brain. During MAO mediated oxidative deamination of 
relevant substrates, H2O2 is released as a catalytic by-product, thus serving as 
a major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Under normal conditions, MAO 
mediated ROS is reported to propel the functioning of mitochondrial electron 
transport chain and phasic dopamine release. However, due to its localization 
onto mitochondria, sudden elevation in its enzymatic activity could directly 
impact the form and function of the organelle. For instance, in the case of 
Parkinson's disease (PD) patients who are on l-dopa therapy, the enzyme could be 
a concurrent source of extensive ROS production in the presence of uncontrolled 
substrate (dopamine) availability, thus further impacting the health of 
surviving neurons. It is worth mentioning that the expression of the enzyme in 
different brain compartments increases with age. Moreover, the involvement of 
MAO in the progression of neurological disorders such as PD, Alzheimer's disease 
and depression has been extensively studied in recent times. Although the usage 
of available synthetic MAO inhibitors has been instrumental in managing these 
conditions, the associated complications have raised significant concerns 
lately. Natural products have served as a major source of lead molecules in 
modern-day drug discovery; however, there is still no FDA-approved MAO inhibitor 
which is derived from natural sources. In this review, we have provided a 
comprehensive overview of MAO and how the enzyme system is involved in the 
pathogenesis of different age-associated neuropathologic conditions. We further 
discussed the applications and drawbacks of the long-term usage of presently 
available synthetic MAO inhibitors. Additionally, we have highlighted the 
prospect and worth of natural product derived molecules in addressing MAO 
associated complications.

The neuronal excitotoxicity that follows reoxygenation after a hypoxic period 
may contribute to epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and various 
disorders that are related to inadequate supplement of oxygen in neurons. 
Therefore, counteracting the deleterious effects of post-hypoxic stress is an 
interesting strategy to treat a large spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases. 
Here, we show that the expression of the key telomere protecting protein Trf2 
decreases in the brain of mice submitted to a post-hypoxic stress. Moreover, 
downregulating the expression of Terf2 in hippocampal neural cells of 
unchallenged mice triggers an excitotoxicity-like phenotype including glutamate 
overexpression and behavioral alterations while overexpressing Terf2 in 
hippocampal neural cells of mice subjected to a post-hypoxic treatment prevents 
brain damages. Moreover, Terf2 overexpression in culture neurons counteracts the 
oxidative stress triggered by glutamate. Finally, we provide evidence that the 
effect of Terf2 downregulation on excitotoxicity involves Sirt3 repression 
leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. We propose that increasing the level of 
Terf2 expression is a potential strategy to reduce post-hypoxic stress damages.

The successful treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still a big challenge. 
Rivastigmine is one of the most used drugs for the treatment of AD. The short 
half-life, lower bioavailability, and less concentration of the drug in the 
brain after oral delivery are considered the main drawbacks of rivastigmine. To 
improve these drawbacks, nanostructure-mediated drug delivery has gained more 
attention. This study investigates the effect of rivastigmine-loaded in 
optimized chitosan nano-particles (RS-CSNPs) as polymeric nano-carriers by 
different administration routes (oral and intranasal) on aluminum chloride 
(AlCl3)-induced Alzheimer-like disease in rat. The model was established by 
giving rats 100 mg/kg/b.wt of AlCl3 orally for 3 months. Then the experimental 
rats were treated with RS-CSNPs either orally or intranasally for 75 days. 
Histopathology, immunohistochemistry of Tau expression in brain tissue, and gene 
expression of Caspase-3, NF-κB, and Nrf-2 were carried out. The therapeutic 
agents used decreased the alterations observed in AlCl3 group with improvement 
in the neuronal viability. In addition to low expression of tau protein, 
down-regulation of caspase-3 and NF-κB genes and up-regulation of Nrf-2. 
RS-CSNPs alleviated the progression of AD presumably via blocking the 
inflammatory cascade and decreasing the oxidative stress process. The intranasal 
route is superior to the oral one and promising in AD management.

BACKGROUND: Danggui Shaoyao San (DSS), a frequently prescribed Chinese medicine 
formula, has demonstrated clinical efficacy in the treatment of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). This study aims to explore the differences in therapeutic effects 
of DSS and its disassembled prescriptions, Suangan (SG) and Xingan (XG), in 
treating Alzheimer's Disease and the mechanism of DSS recovering autophagy in 
AD.
METHODS: A network pharmacology strategy was employed to delineate the bioactive 
constituents, associated targets, and regulatory mechanisms of DSS in AD, 
encompassing in silico target forecasting, the generation and scrutiny of PPI 
networks, alongside GO and KEGG-based pathway elucidation. An AD mouse model, 
induced by intracerebroventricular injection of Aβ1-42, was used to evaluate the 
therapeutic effects of DSS and its disassembled prescriptions on AD. Cognitive 
function was evaluated using the Morris water maze. Expression levels of 
inflammatory cytokines were quantified via RT-qPCR and ELISA. Western blotting 
was used to detect the expression of proteins related to AD pathological markers 
and the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway.
RESULTS: 50 active compounds and 718 HUB genes were screened from relevant 
databases and literature. KEGG and GO analyses indicated that DSS's potential 
mechanisms against AD involved the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway and mitophagy. In 
vivo animal model, the results demonstrated that DSS, SG, and XG treatments 
improved cognitive function and ameliorated neuroinflammation in mice. 
Additionally, they alleviated the pathological changes of neuronal cells. These 
treatments also increased the protein level of PSD-95, and decreased levels of 
APP and p-Tau. Among them, DSS exhibited the best efficacy. Furthermore, DSS, 
SG, and XG upregulated the expression of LC3, Beclin1, and p-AMPK, while 
decreasing the expression of P62 and p-mTOR.
CONCLUSIONS: DSS, SG, and XG were found to ameliorate AD-related pathological 
symptoms in Aβ1-42-injected mice, likely through the AMPK/mTOR autophagy 
signaling pathway.

The bidirectional regulation between the gut microbiota and brain, known as 
gut-brain axis, has received significant attention. The myelin sheath, produced 
by oligodendrocytes or Schwann cells, is essential for efficient nervous signal 
transmission and the maintenance of brain function. Growing evidence shows that 
both oligodendrogenesis and myelination are modulated by gut microbiota and its 
metabolites, and when dysbiosis occurs, changes in the microbiota composition 
and/or associated metabolites may impact developmental myelination and the 
occurrence of neurodevelopmental disabilities. Although the link between the 
microbiota and demyelinating disease such as multiple sclerosis has been 
extensively studied, our knowledge about the role of the microbiota in other 
myelin-related disorders, such as neurodegenerative diseases, is limited. 
Mechanistically, the microbiota-oligodendrocyte axis is primarily mediated by 
factors such as inflammation, the vagus nerve, endocrine hormones, and 
microbiota metabolites as evidenced by metagenomics, metabolomics, vagotomy, and 
morphological and molecular approaches. Treatments targeting this axis include 
probiotics, prebiotics, microbial metabolites, herbal bioactive compounds, and 
specific dietary management. In addition to the commonly used approaches, viral 
vector-mediated tracing and gene manipulation, integrated multiomics and 
multicenter clinical trials will greatly promote the mechanistic and 
interventional studies and ultimately, the development of new preventive and 
therapeutic strategies against gut-oligodendrocyte axis-mediated brain 
impairments. Interestingly, recent findings showed that microbiota dysbiosis can 
be induced by hippocampal myelin damage and is reversible by myelin-targeted 
drugs, which provides new insights into understanding how hippocampus-based 
functional impairment (such as in neurodegenerative Alzheimer's disease) 
regulates the peripheral homeostasis of microbiota and associated systemic 
disorders.
