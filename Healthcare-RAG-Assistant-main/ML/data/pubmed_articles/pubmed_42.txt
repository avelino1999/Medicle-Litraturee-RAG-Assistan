AIMS: This study aimed to investigate novel therapeutic approaches for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) by targeting the Transforming Growth Factor-β (TGF-β) 
pathway using hybrid compounds derived from oxymatrine and amino acids.
BACKGROUND: AD remains a significant challenge in neurodegenerative disorders, 
necessitating innovative treatments that can mitigate its devastating effects. 
The TGF-β pathway has been implicated in AD pathogenesis, making it a promising 
target for therapeutic intervention.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to synthesize and evaluate the 
anti-AD activity of hybrid molecules combining oxymatrine with different amino 
acids. These compounds were designed to enhance blood-brain barrier permeability 
and selectively modulate TGF-β signaling.
METHOD: Hybrid compounds were synthesized based on molecular docking studies. 
Characterization of synthesized compounds was performed using thin-layer 
chromatography (TLC), infrared spectroscopy (IR), and nuclear magnetic resonance 
(NMR) spectroscopy. Anti-AD activity was assessed using an AD rat model induced 
by a high-cholesterol diet, employing behavioral tests (radial arm maze and 
Hebb's Williams maze) and biochemical assays to measure Aβ and TGF-β levels.
RESULT: All hybrid molecules exhibited significant anti-AD activity, with 
compound 3B demonstrating the highest efficacy at a dose of 100 mg/kg. 
Biochemical analyses revealed modulation of Aβ and TGF-β levels, indicating the 
compounds' potential therapeutic effects against AD.
CONCLUSION: This study unveils a new class of hybrid compounds derived from 
oxymatrine and amino acids that effectively target the TGF-β pathway, offering 
promising therapeutic potential for AD. These compounds demonstrate 
neuroprotective properties, suggesting they may mitigate ADrelated pathology, 
including tau deposition, synaptic dysfunction, and cognitive decline.

The consumption and utilization of Ginkgo biloba leaves and seeds in traditional 
herbal treatments have left an indelible mark. Their rich chemical makeup and 
remarkable pharmacological effects, particularly in the form of EGb761 leaf 
extracts, have captivated researchers seeking novel treatments for degenerative 
nerve illnesses like Alzheimer's disease. However, the story of Ginkgo biloba 
doesn't end there. The Ginkgo biloba seeds, which were once highly regarded as 
sustenance and medicine but are often overlooked, hold ancient wisdom that 
awaits discovery and understanding, also, it is advised to consume one to two 
seeds per day because of the ginkgo toxin side effect. Traditional Chinese 
medicine has harnessed its potential to combat intestinal tract worm infections, 
pyogenic skin diseases, enuresis, asthma, cough, and more, owing to its abundant 
reserves of carbs, protein, fat, and polyphenols. Moreover, recent studies have 
emerged, suggesting their neuroprotective properties. Fostering awareness and 
encouraging the consumption of Ginkgo biloba seeds thus becomes paramount. As we 
embark on a quest to delve into the depths of Ginkgo biloba seeds, this 
comprehensive review aims to shed light on their key components, bioactivities, 
processing techniques, and the latest insights into their pharmacological 
actions. By embracing a holistic understanding of Ginkgo biloba seeds, we lay 
the foundation for their scientific advancement and the development of this 
remarkable edible seed. Furthermore, it is essential to acknowledge that while 
Ginkgo biloba holds immense potential, caution is warranted, as adverse effects 
such as allergies have been reported, particularly in individuals with known 
allergies.

Clinical Medical College of North Sichuan Medical College, Nanchong Central 
Hospital, Nanchong, China.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the potential effects of repetitive 
transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on the reversion of mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) to normal cognitive function and to elucidate the underlying 
mechanisms.
METHODS: The study enrolled 25 MCI participants, who underwent a 10-day of rTMS 
treatment and an 18-month follow-up, along with 15 healthy subjects. 
Participants with MCI were categorized into MCI reverters (MCI-R) and MCI 
maintainers (MCI-M). We assessed differences in baseline cognitive performance, 
functional connectivity, and changes of cognitive functions after rTMS between 
MCI-R and MCI-M to identify possible predictors of reversion of MCI and explore 
the neural modulation mechanisms.
RESULTS: MCI-M exhibited more severe cognitive impairments across more domains, 
particularly in language function (p < 0.05). Functional connectivity was more 
severely damaged in MCI-M participants, notably within the default mode network 
(DMN), executive control network (ECN), and frontoparietal network (FPN). After 
rTMS therapy, MCI-R participants demonstrated more significantly improved 
immediate and delayed recall memory scores (p < 0.05). These memory function 
changes and baseline functional connectivity of DMN, ECN, and FPN were 
predictive of the reversion of MCI.
CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of rTMS in memory function may promote the reversion 
of MCI to normal cognition, with the functional connectivity of DMN, ECN, and 
FPN playing a crucial important role. The severity of cognitive impairment and 
functional connectivity damage correlated with the likelihood of the reversion 
of MCI to normal cognition, underscoring the importance of early rTMS 
intervention for dementia prevention.

The quantification of neurofilament light polypeptide (NFL) in biofluids is 
being clinically used to detect and grade general neuronal damage in 
neurodegenerative diseases and quantify neuronal injury during acute events like 
traumatic brain injury. Specific assays that target only particular molecular 
breakdown products of neurofilaments have the potential to distinguish between 
various pathologies. Nevertheless, the molecular structure of neurofilament 
light polypeptide in cerebrospinal fluid remains to be elucidated. We 
characterized neurofilament light polypeptide in cerebrospinal fluid by 
size-exclusion chromatography, Western blotting and mass spectrometry. 
Neurofilament light polypeptide in cerebrospinal fluid was found to be composed 
of aggregates of fragments of the full-length molecule. These aggregates were 
sensitive to reduction by dithiothreitol and dissociated to monomeric fragments 
of 6-12 kDa (Western blot), covering most of the coiled-coil domains of 
neurofilament light polypeptide. Since only cysteine residues can form disulfide 
bonds, this points to a role of the single cysteine 322 for maintaining the 
stability of the aggregates. The sequence region covered by the identified 
fragments ended just a few amino acids C-terminally of the coiled-coil region at 
a site which had been previously mapped to a calpain cleavage site in the glial 
fibrillary acidic protein, which is highly homologous to neurofilament light 
polypeptide in the coiled-coil region. This cleavage site was also confirmed to 
be present in bovine neurofilament light polypeptide by in vitro digestion of 
purified neurofilament light polypeptide with calpain-1. The difference of the 
molecular weights of the reduced and non-reduced forms of neurofilament light 
polypeptide suggests that neurofilament light polypeptide in CSF consists of 
disulfide-linked aggregated fragments, most likely tetramers, or alternately 
dimers in a complex with another binding partner.

INTRODUCTION: Disruptions in estrogen exposure (i.e., surgically induced 
menopause) have been linked to poorer cognitive aging and dementia risk. Hormone 
therapy use (e.g., birth control, menopausal hormone therapy) has shown mixed 
associations with cognitive performance, possibly due to limited cognitive test 
batteries. To address previous inconsistencies, we investigated baseline data 
from Investigating Gains in Neurocognition in an Intervention Trial of Exercise 
(IGNITE). We hypothesized that (1) oophorectomy prior to natural menopause would 
be associated with poorer cognitive performance, (2) timing and duration of 
birth control and menopausal hormone therapy would influence associations with 
cognitive performance, and (3) APOE4 carrier status would interact with 
oophorectomy and hormone therapy to influence cognitive performance.
METHODS: In 461 post-menopausal females (M age = 69.6) we assessed oophorectomy 
and hormone therapy use to examine associations with the Montreal Cognitive 
Assessment (MoCA) and factor-analytically derived composite scores for episodic 
memory, processing speed, working memory, executive function/attentional 
control, and visuospatial processing.
RESULTS: Hypothesis (1) We did not observe associations between oophorectomy 
prior to natural menopause and poorer cognitive performance. However, hormone 
therapy use, started on average within 2 years of oophorectomy, was associated 
with better episodic memory (β = 0.106, p = 0.02), working memory (β = 0.120, p 
= 0.005), and visuospatial processing (β = 0.095, p = 0.03). Hypothesis (2) 
Birth control use was associated with better performance on the MoCA (β = 0.093, 
p = 0.04), working memory (β = 0.102, p = 0.02), and executive 
function/attentional control (β = 0.103, p = 0.02). However, duration and timing 
of birth control and menopausal hormone therapy were not associated with 
cognitive performance. Hypothesis (3) We did not observe significant 
interactions between APOE4 status and oophorectomy or hormone therapy in their 
associations with cognitive performance.
DISCUSSION: Our results suggest exposure to estrogen during adulthood, 
specifically birth control and hormone therapy among women undergoing 
pre-menopausal oophorectomy, benefits cognitive function in older adulthood. Our 
comprehensive cognitive battery allowed us to examine cognitive function with a 
high degree of granularity. Future work should evaluate causal mechanisms of 
associations between lifetime estrogen exposure and later life cognitive 
function.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia 
globally, placing a substantial economic burden on patients and society. 
Exercise serves as an adjuvant therapy for AD with a low incidence of related 
adverse events. As a non-pharmacological intervention, it has demonstrated 
significant potential in the therapy of AD.
OBJECTIVE: This study examines the key hotspots and emerging trends in exercise 
therapy for AD, offering valuable insights for researchers engaged in future 
research in this field.
METHODS: The Web of Science Core Collection database was utilized to search for 
literature on exercise therapy for AD from January 1, 2000, to November 1, 2024, 
with 1,372 relevant articles being identified. And CiteSpace 6.2.R4 and 
VOSviewer were used to evaluate the bibliometric indicators.
RESULTS: Since 2000, the number of publications in the field of exercise therapy 
for AD has been increasing. In addition to the well-known areas of research, 
such as the impact of exercise on cognitive function, the combination of 
exercise and medication therapy, the effects of exercise on specific symptoms, 
and the exercise with music therapy, the field may also focus on more novel 
topics. These include the integration of the design and implementation of 
exercise interventions, exercise and dendritic spines, and exercise and 
neurophysiological mechanisms. Furthermore, an analysis of emerging keywords 
reveals that the current main research direction is exploring the specific 
physiological mechanisms through which exercise affects AD. This includes three 
emerging trends: the impact of exercise on cognitive impairment in AD patients, 
the effects of exercise on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and Amyloid 
beta, and the influence of exercise on Stress and neuroinflammation.
CONCLUSION: The research results indicate that interventions using exercise to 
alleviate the negative symptoms of AD, as well as combining exercise with 
medication for therapy, are gaining increasing attention from researchers. 
Meanwhile, novel topics such as exercise and music therapy, the design and 
implementation of exercise interventions, and neurophysiological mechanisms 
should also attract scholarly interest. Additionally, exploring the 
physiological mechanisms behind exercise therapy for AD could be a key focus for 
future research.

BACKGROUND: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are prevalent among persons with 
Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). However, there are limited 
safe and effective nonpharmacological treatments for controlling NPS. 
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a promising noninvasive and 
safe treatment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study investigated the effects of remotely 
supervised tDCS in managing NPS in older adults with mild to moderate ADRD. 
Forty older adults diagnosed with early-stage ADRD were randomly assigned in a 
1:1 ratio to receive home-based active tDCS (n = 20) or sham tDCS (n = 20).
RESULTS: Results showed a significantly greater improvement in the following 
NPS: scratching (P = 0.052, Hedges' g = -0.60 [confidence interval {CI}: -1.24, 
0.04], Cliff's δ = -0.41 [CI: -0.67, -0.06]), nighttime behaviors (P = 0.041; 
Hedges' g = -0.62 [CI: -1.26, 0.03]; Cliff's δ = -0.41 [CI: -0.67, -0.06], and 
appetite/eating changes (P = 0.010; Hedges' g = -0.78 [CI: -1.43, -0.13]; 
Cliff's δ = -0.41 [CI: - 0.56, -0.10]).
CONCLUSION: This study shows promising initial results for using home-based, 
remotely supervised tDCS to manage NPS, such as nighttime behaviors, changes in 
eating and appetite, and scratching. Larger studies with more participants are 
needed to explore various tDCS doses and their long-term effects on NPS.

A Deep Subgrouping Framework for Precision Drug Repurposing via Emulating 
Clinical Trials on Real-world Patient Data.

Drug repurposing identifies new therapeutic uses for existing drugs, reducing 
the time and costs compared to traditional de novo drug discovery. Most existing 
drug repurposing studies using real-world patient data often treat the entire 
population as homogeneous, ignoring the heterogeneity of treatment responses 
across patient subgroups. This approach may overlook promising drugs that 
benefit specific subgroups but lack notable treatment effects across the entire 
population, potentially limiting the number of repurposable candidates 
identified. To address this, we introduce STEDR, a novel drug repurposing 
framework that integrates subgroup analysis with treatment effect estimation. 
Our approach first identifies repurposing candidates by emulating multiple 
clinical trials on real-world patient data and then characterizes patient 
subgroups by learning subgroup-specific treatment effects. We deploy STEDR to 
Alzheimer's Disease (AD), a condition with few approved drugs and known 
heterogeneity in treatment responses. We emulate trials for over one thousand 
medications on a large-scale real-world database covering over 8 million 
patients, identifying 14 drug candidates with beneficial effects to AD in 
characterized subgroups. Experiments demonstrate STEDR's superior capability in 
identifying repurposing candidates compared to existing approaches. 
Additionally, our method can characterize clinically relevant patient subgroups 
associated with important AD-related risk factors, paving the way for precision 
drug repurposing.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common diseases characterized by 
neurodegeneration and is becoming a major public health problem worldwide. AD is 
manifested mainly by progressive impairments in cognition, emotion, language and 
memory in the elderly population. Many treatment strategies have been explored 
for decades; however, there is still no effective way to address the root cause 
of AD pathogenesis, only to target symptoms to improve patient cognitive 
outcomes. Intracerebral administration is difficult because of the challenges 
posed by the blood‒brain barrier (BBB). NPs are materials with sizes between 1 
and 100 nm that can improve biocompatibility, extend the half-life, transport 
macromolecules, be delivered across the BBB to the central nervous system, and 
exhibit good targeting capabilities. NPs can provide new ideas for the treatment 
of AD in terms of their antiaging, antineuroinflammatory, antioxidative, and 
nerve repair-promoting effects. In this manuscript, we first describe the 
relationship between AD and the BBB. Second, we introduce the application of 
nanoparticles for AD treatment. Finally, we summarize the challenges faced by 
nanoparticles in the treatment of AD.

Microbial infections have long been implicated in the gut-brain link to 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). These infections may influence AD development either 
directly, through brain invasion, or indirectly via bacterial metabolites 
crossing the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) or interacting with the enteric nervous 
system (ENS). Such findings have inspired clinicians to repurpose antimicrobial 
drugs for AD, yielding promising results. However, the sole bacterial link to AD 
may be insufficiently understood. Bacterial amyloid presence in biofilms is 
well-documented, with certain bacterial proteins exacerbating amyloid formation 
while others inhibit it. For instance, Curli-specific gene protein C (CsgC) in 
E. coli suppresses curli amyloid formation. This review investigates the 
possibility of human CsgC-like proteins, identifying beta-2 microglobulin (β2M) 
and E3 ubiquitin ligases (E3s) as potential analogs that may influence amyloid 
degradation. We propose that nanoparticles (NPs) could serve as platforms to 
anchor these proteins, forming Amyloid Dissociating Bifunctional NanoChaperones 
(ADBiNaCs) with enhanced antiamyloidogenic activity. This innovative approach 
holds promise for novel AD treatment strategies, meriting further investigation 
into the role of bacterial and human amyloid-modulating proteins in AD 
pathology.

ObjectiveIron is the most abundant metal in the human brain, and plays a crucial 
role in many biological processes. However, disruptions in brain iron metabolism 
can lead to iron buildup, which occurs with aging and is linked to several brain 
disorders, including Alzheimer's disease. Microglia, the brain's resident immune 
cells, have the highest capacity to store iron, which is stored intracellularly 
within ferritin complexes. Importantly, women are at a higher risk of developing 
Alzheimer's disease and experience faster disease progression compared to 
men.MethodsWe used postmortem brain samples from patients with Alzheimer's 
disease and small vessel disease patients of both sexes for immunohistochemical 
studies. Samples were stained with the Prussian blue method to visualize iron 
deposits and with antibodies against the microglia marker Iba1 and ferritin 
light chain.ResultsOur study reveals that the number of iron deposits and the 
levels of ferritin light chain in microglia are positively correlated in men 
with Alzheimer's disease, but negatively correlated in women. There is no 
correlation between brain iron deposition and ferritin in samples from patients 
with small vessel disease of both sexes.ConclusionsThese results could inform 
more tailored approaches to the treatment and management of Alzheimer's disease 
based on sex-specific differences in brain iron metabolism and microglial iron 
storage capacity.

Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is an innate immune 
receptor predominantly expressed by microglia in the brain. Recent studies have 
established TREM2 as a central immune signaling hub in neurodegeneration, where 
it triggers immune responses upon sensing pathological development and tissue 
damages. TREM2 binds diverse ligands and activates downstream pathways that 
regulate microglial phagocytosis, inflammatory responses, and metabolic 
reprogramming. Interestingly, TREM2 exists both in its membrane-bound form and 
as a soluble variant (sTREM2), that latter is generated through proteolytic 
shedding or alternative splicing and can be detected in cerebrospinal fluid and 
plasma. Emerging clinical and preclinical evidence underscores the potential of 
TREM2 and sTREM2 as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). This review provides a comprehensive overview of the molecular 
functions, regulatory mechanisms, and pathological implications of TREM2 and 
sTREM2 in AD. Furthermore, we explore their potential roles in diagnostics and 
therapeutics while suggesting key research directions for advancing 
TREM2/sTREM2-based strategies in combating AD.

OBJECTIVE: A healthy lifestyle has been shown to mitigate cognitive decline in 
patients with mild cognitive impairment, with family caregivers playing a 
pivotal role in the patients' lifestyle management. Exploring the level of 
dementia risk reduction lifestyle and the influencing factors at both the 
patient and caregiver levels in patients with mild cognitive impairment is 
crucial for identifying strategies to improve patients' lifestyles and delay 
disease progression.
METHODS: Using a convenience sampling method, 302 patients with mild cognitive 
impairment and their family caregivers admitted to the neurology departments of 
four tertiary care hospitals in China, from December 2024 to February 2025 were 
recruited and surveyed using a general information questionnaire, the Dementia 
Risk Reduction Lifestyle Scale (DRRLS), the Motivation to Change Lifestyle and 
Health Behaviors for Dementia Risk Reduction scale (MCLHB-DRR), the Perceived 
Social Support Scale (PSSS), and the Mutuality Scale (MS). Multiple linear 
regression was used to analyze the factors influencing the dementia risk 
reduction lifestyle of patients.
RESULTS: DRRLS score of 83.61 ± 16.13, multiple linear regression showed that 
the patient's monthly individual income, the presence of chronic disease, health 
beliefs, and social support were independent influences on their dementia risk 
reduction lifestyle. Furthermore, the lifestyle and mutuality of family 
caregivers were also independent influences on dementia risk reduction lifestyle 
in patients. The final model explained 75.5% of the variance in the lifestyle.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with mild cognitive impairment have a general level of 
dementia risk reduction lifestyle. The characteristics of both patients and 
caregivers collectively influence the patients' lifestyle. Healthcare providers 
should conduct early dyadic assessments and develop targeted dyadic intervention 
strategies based on influencing factors to improve patients' lifestyles and help 
them delay disease progression.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) show potential for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) and monitoring of its progression. However, EV-based AD diagnosis 
faces challenges due to the small size and low abundance of biomarkers. Here, we 
report a fully integrated organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) sensor for 
ultrafast, accurate, and convenient point-of-care testing (POCT) of serum EVs 
from AD patients. By utilizing acoustoelectric enrichment, the EVs can be 
quickly propelled, significantly enriched, and specifically bound to the OECT 
detection area, achieving a gain of over 280 times response in 30 s. The 
integrated POCT sensor can detect serum EVs from AD patients with a limit of 
detection as low as 500 EV particles/mL and a reduced detection time of just two 
minutes. Furthermore, the integrated POCT sensors were used to monitor AD 
progression in an AD mouse model by testing the mouse Aβ EVs at different time 
courses (up to 18 months) and compared with the Aβ accumulation using 
high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This innovative technology has 
the potential for accurate and rapid diagnosis of Alzheimer's and other 
neurodegenerative diseases, and monitoring of disease progression and treatment 
response.

BACKGROUND: Over 6 million patients in the United States are affected by 
Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). Early detection of ADRD can 
significantly improve patient outcomes through timely treatment.
OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate machine learning (ML) models for early ADRD 
diagnosis and prediction using de-identified EHR data from the University of 
Missouri (MU) Healthcare.
DESIGN: Retrospective case-control study.
SETTING: The study used de-identified EHR data provided by the MU NextGen 
Biomedical Informatics, modeled with the PCORnet Common Data Model (CDM).
PARTICIPANTS: An initial cohort of 380,269 patients aged 40 or older with at 
least two healthcare encounters was narrowed to a final dataset of 4,012 ADRD 
cases and 119,723 controls.
METHODS: Six ML classifier models: Gradient-Boosted Trees (GBT), Light 
Gradient-Boosting Machine (LightGBM), Random Forest (RF), eXtreme 
Gradient-Boosting (XGBoost), Logistic Regression (LR), and Adaptive Boosting 
(AdaBoost) were evaluated using Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic 
Curve (AUC-ROC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score. SHAP (SHapley 
Additive exPlanations) analysis was applied to interpret predictions.
RESULTS: The GBT model achieved the best AUC-ROC scores of 0.809-0.833 across 1- 
to 5-year prediction windows. SHAP analysis identified depressive disorder, age 
groups 80-90 yrs and 70-80 yrs, heart disease, anxiety, and the novel risk 
factors of sleep apnea, and headache.
CONCLUSION: This study underscores the potential of ML models for leveraging EHR 
data to enable early ADRD prediction, supporting timely interventions, and 
improving patient outcomes. By identifying both established and novel risk 
factors, these findings offer new opportunities for personalized screening and 
management strategies, advancing both clinical and informatics science.

Traditional vaccinology has primarily focused on neutralizing antibody titers as 
the main correlate of vaccine efficacy, often overlooking the multifaceted roles 
of antibody Fc effector functions in orchestrating protective immune responses. 
Fc-mediated immune responses play a pivotal role in immune modulation and 
pathogen clearance. Emerging evidence from natural infections and vaccine 
studies highlights the critical contribution of Fc effector functions in 
determining the quality and durability of immunity. This work explores the 
limitations of current vaccine evaluation paradigms that prioritize 
neutralization over Fc effector mechanisms. It also describes findings from a 
study showing an unexpected role for SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike antibodies: both 
convalescent plasma and patient-derived monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) lead to 
maximum phagocytic capacity by monocytes at low concentrations, whereas at 
higher concentrations the phagocytic capacity was reduced. Given that the 
severity of COVID-19 disease and antibody titers are strongly positively 
correlated, this work challenges the paradigm that high antibodies offer better 
protection against severe disease. It is proposed that humoral and cellular 
responses elicited by vaccination should never be higher than those produced by 
natural infection. By integrating antibody Fc effector functions into vaccine 
development, a paradigm shift is proposed that emphasizes synergic antibody 
responses. Such an approach could transform vaccine efficacy assessment, enhance 
protection against dangerous pathogens, and drive innovation in vaccine design.

BACKGROUND: People from minoritised ethnic groups are more likely to be impacted 
by dementia. In the general population, dementia may be prevented or delayed by 
up to 40% by reducing risk in 12 modifiable risk factors (MRF). However, 
minoritised ethnic groups are not systematically included.
OBJECTIVES: We conducted a scoping review following Joanna Briggs Institute 
guidance to map: (1) which minoritised ethnic groups have been included in UK 
research on dementia MRF, (2) for which MRF and (3) using which research 
methods.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Eligible studies analysed one or more of the 12 MRFs among 
minoritised ethnic groups.
EVIDENCE SOURCES: Medline, Embase Classic+Embase, PsycInfo, Web of Science, 
CINAHL and grey literature were searched.
CHARTING METHODS: Patient and public involvement with minoritised ethnic groups 
and professionals informed the data extraction tool. We use frequencies and 
graphs in data description.
RESULTS: We screened 7748 records, assessed 122 full text records and included 
14 studies, which mostly used broad ethnic groups. Hypertension, diabetes and 
depression were studied as predictors of dementia in 10, eight and six studies, 
respectively, compared with low social contact and air pollution in just two 
each. Measures of MRF lacked consistency, and data per ethnic group were not 
reported in several studies. Research examining interactions in combinations of 
MRFs was lacking.
CONCLUSIONS: More research is needed with specific ethnic groups, consistent 
measures and focusing on discrimination and MRF interaction and severity. This 
will be key to personalised risk reduction with diverse communities.

Aggregated forms of protein arising from misfolded variants under physiological 
conditions can lead to the development of disorders related to proteinopathy, 
including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Some small molecules derived from plants can 
enhance the process of protein disaggregation via various pathways. Among the 
different bioactive substances, osthole-a natural coumarin compound-can be 
highly effective against protein aggregation and associated proteinopathies. In 
this research, we investigated osthole's capacity to prevent tau aggregation, a 
key protein in tauopathy and AD. Osthole was discovered to impede amyloid fibril 
formation by modulating the kinetics of fibril assembly. In addition, osthole 
has the potential to enhance the α-helix percentage of tau, while the fractions 
of β-sheet and random coil were reduced, suggesting that osthole can 
proficiently stabilize tau structure. Osthole hindered the structural shift from 
random coil to β-sheet and the creation of hydrophobic areas. Fluorescence 
spectroscopy and docking analysis indicated that nonpolar and intermolecular 
energies play a greater role in forming the osthole-tau complex than polar 
energy, and hydrophobic residues LEU344, ILE354, and PHE346 participating in the 
strong interaction (logKb values ranging from 5.09 to 5.41 across the studied 
temperature range). Osthole effectively reduced amyloid-induced neurotoxicity in 
SH-SY5Y cells by inhibiting ROS production and caspase-3 mRNA expression and 
activity. In summary, we suggest that osthole could serve as a small molecule 
for treating different tauopathy-related disorders, justifying additional 
research moving forward.

Despite being present in many drugs, guanylhydrazones and semicarbazones are two 
functional groups that have been little investigated as potential therapeutic 
strategies for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). For this reason, we 
initiated the synthesis and evaluation of these compounds as potential 
anticholinesterase agents, aiming to offer new alternatives for drug development 
against AD. In the severe phase of AD butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) becomes the 
main enzyme responsible for the hydrolysis of acetylcholine (ACh). Therefore, in 
this project, we present the results of BChE inhibitory activity, enzyme 
kinetics, cytotoxicity, and molecular modeling studies for three guanylhydrazone 
and two semicarbazone derivatives that were previously synthesized and evaluated 
as acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors. Among the compounds tested, 
guanylhydrazones (1, 2, and 3) showed inhibitory activity against BChE, 
exhibiting a mixed non-competitive inhibition profile. Specifically, compound 2 
(phenanthrenequinone) demonstrated superior inhibitory potency with an IC50 of 
0.68 μM, compared to compound 1 (acridinone) with an IC50 of 3.87 μM, and 
compound 3 (benzodioxole) with an IC50 of 101.7 μM. In contrast, semicarbazones 
(4 and 5) showed no BChE inhibition up to the highest concentration tested 
(300 μM). Importantly, all five compounds were found to be non-cytotoxic. Our 
results suggest that these compounds have potential as drug prototypes targeting 
different phases of AD. Compounds 3, 4, and 5 may be more effective in the early 
phase, when AChE activity remains high; compound 1 could be useful in the 
intermediate phase; and compound 2 appears particularly promising for the severe 
phase, when BChE plays a more dominant role.

OBJECTIVE: The aim was to investigate the pooled prevalence of reversion from 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to normal cognition people, and the influencing 
factors for reversion.
METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, The Cochrane Library, Wanfang Database, 
China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database (CNKI), Weipu Database, SinoMed 
were systematically searched from the inception to June 1, 2023. Participants 
were diagnosis as MCI adults.
RESULTS: In total, 4075 studies were screened and data from 48 studies involving 
31876 subjects were used in meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of reversion 
from MCI to normal cognition was 31%. The following risk factors were associated 
with the reversion from MCI to normal cognition: education (low to high), age, 
Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ), 
Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT) delay recall test, Apolipoprotein E (APOE) 
positive, multiple domain impaired, live along, depression, doing house work 
daily/exercise once a week.
CONCLUSIONS: The study shows the pooled prevalence of reversion from MCI to 
normal cognition was high, and there are controllable factors. Understanding the 
controllable factors of reversion from MCI to normal cognition can provide the 
clinicians with the theoretical basis for the management and treatment of the 
patients.

Ampakines, positive allosteric modulators of AMPA-glutamate receptors (AMPAR), 
have therapeutic implications in neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders in 
which AMPAR signaling is compromised such as Alzheimer's, ADHD, and 
schizophrenia. Low impact ampakines are a distinct subset of ampakines that only 
partially offset receptor desensitization and do not meaningfully alter binding 
affinity of AMPAR agonists, which may explain their lack of seizurogenic effects 
seen with other AMPAR positive modulators. Herein, we describe the preclinical 
pharmacology and antipsychotic activity of the low impact ampakine 
1-(benzofurazan-5-ylcarbonyl)piperidine (CX691). CX691 moderately offsets 
desensitization in hippocampal patches, supporting its designation as a low 
impact ampakine and penetrates the blood-brain barrier. CX691 is more potent 
than well characterized high impact ampakines CX614 and CX546 and low impact 
ampakine CX516 in abrogating amphetamine-stimulated locomotor activity in 
Sprague Dawley rats. Low-dose CX691 synergistically reduces 
methamphetamine-induced locomotor activity when paired with approved 
antipsychotics clozapine and olanzapine. In rats treated chronically with 
amphetamine, CX691 retains antipsychotic activity whereas high doses of CX516 
lack therapeutic effects. In contrast to haloperidol, CX691 is devoid of 
cataleptic activity at supratherapeutic doses in rats. CX691 enhances 
performance in the eight-arm radial maze, a spatial task that assesses 
hippocampal function, an activity of potential value for ameliorating cognitive 
deficits in schizophrenia. Taken together, these findings illustrate that low 
impact ampakines with improved potency might be useful therapeutic interventions 
in schizophrenic patients when given alone or as adjuncts to ongoing traditional 
antipsychotic drug therapies.

BACKGROUND: Artificial patient technology could transform health care by 
accelerating diagnosis, treatment, and mapping clinical pathways. Deep learning 
methods for generating artificial data in health care include data augmentation 
by variational autoencoders (VAE) technology.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to test the feasibility of generating artificial patients 
with reliable clinical characteristics by using a geometry-based VAE applied, 
for the first time, on high-dimension, low-sample-size tabular data.
METHODS: Clinical tabular data were extracted from 521 real patients of the 
"MAX" digital conversational agent (BOTdesign) created for preparing patients 
for anesthesia. A 3-stage methodological approach was implemented to generate up 
to 10,000 artificial patients: training the model and generating artificial 
data, assessing the consistency and confidentiality of artificial data, and 
validating the plausibility of the newly created artificial patients.
RESULTS: We demonstrated the feasibility of applying the VAE technique to 
tabular data to generate large artificial patient cohorts with high consistency 
(fidelity scores>94%). Moreover, artificial patients could not be matched with 
real patients (filter similarity scores>99%, κ coefficients of agreement<0.2), 
thus guaranteeing the essential ethical concern of confidentiality.
CONCLUSIONS: This proof-of-concept study has demonstrated our ability to augment 
real tabular data to generate artificial patients. These promising results make 
it possible to envisage in silico trials carried out on large cohorts of 
artificial patients, thereby overcoming the pitfalls usually encountered in in 
vivo trials. Further studies integrating longitudinal dynamics are needed to map 
patient trajectories.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent type of dementia, is characterized 
by a biological process that begins with the development of AD neuropathologic 
change (ADNPC) while individuals remain asymptomatic. A key molecular hallmark 
of ADNPC is the accumulation of amyloid-β plaques. β-secretase plays a critical 
role in the upstream pathological cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), 
producing amyloid-β peptides that are prone to misfolding, ultimately 
contributing to plaque formation. Neuronal extracellular vesicles (NEVs) in the 
blood transport β-secretase and preserve its activity, allowing for noninvasive 
profiling of β-secretase activity for detecting early onset of ADNPC. In this 
study, a novel approach is approached for noninvasive assessment of β-secretase 
activity in AD patients using an NEV β-secretase activity assay. This assay 
identifies NEVs exhibiting colocalization of NEV markers with AD-associated 
β-secretase, generating a β-secretase activity profile for each patient. The NEV 
β-secretase activity assay represents a significant advancement in leveraging 
the diagnostic potential of NEVs, offering a noninvasive, quantitative method 
for reliably assessing β-secretase activity to detect the early onset of ADNPC.

BACKGROUNDS: Dementia can impose a heavy economic burden on both society and 
families. Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent form of dementia, is a 
complex neurodegenerative disease characterized by the abnormal deposition of 
extracellular amyloid β-protein (Aβ) and the aggregation of intracellular Tau 
protein to form neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Given the limited efficacy of 
pharmacological treatment, scientists have already paid more attention to 
non-pharmacological strategies, including dietary restriction (DR). DR refers to 
a nutritional paradigm aimed at promoting overall health by modifying the 
balance between energy consumption and expenditure. Studies have demonstrated 
that DR effectively extends the healthy lifespan, delays the aging process, and 
achieves promising results in the prevention and treatment of AD in preclinical 
studies.
METHODS: In this review we collected related studies and viewpoints by searching 
on PubMed database using the keywords. Most of the citations were published 
between 2015 and 2025. A few older literatures were also included due to their 
relevance and significance in this field.
RESULTS: We first provide a concise overview of the current therapeutic and 
preventive strategies for AD. Then, we introduce several specific DR protocols 
and their favorable effects on AD. Furthermore, the potential mechanisms 
underlying the benefits of DR on AD are discussed. Finally, we briefly highlight 
the role of DR in maintaining brain health.
CONCLUSION: This review may offer valuable insights into the development of 
innovative non-pharmacological strategies for AD treatment.

BACKGROUND: Cerebellar disease may result in Cerebellar Cognitive Affective 
Syndrome (CCAS). The CCAS-Scale, designed to screen for CCAS, has been validated 
in English Hoche (Brain 141:248-270, 2018) and adapted to other languages.
METHODS: Here, the German CCAS-Scale Thieme (Neurol Res Pract 2:39, 2020) was 
validated in 209 patients with cerebellar disorders and 232 healthy controls. 
Correction formulas for the outcome parameters [failed test items (range: 1-10) 
and sum raw score (range: 0-120)] were developed, controlling for age, 
education, and sex effects. Diagnostic accuracy and reliability were assessed.
RESULTS: Correction formulas improved selectivity in controls, reducing false 
positives (failed items: 40%; sum score: 13% vs. original method Hoche (Brain 
141:248-270, 2018): 67%), while maintaining moderate sensitivity (failed items: 
69%; sum score: 48% vs. original method Hoche (Brain 141:248-270, 2018): 87%). 
Word fluency tests differentiated best between patients and controls, while 
other items did not. Internal consistency (α = 0.71) was acceptable. Removal of 
word fluency tests worsened it. Retest and interrater reliability were high 
[intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC): 0.77-0.95]. However, these ICCs 
yielded a large minimal detectable change (MDC; 2.2-2.4 failed items, 9.5-11.4 
raw score points) in patients, limiting the use of the CCAS-Scale in follow-up 
examinations.
CONCLUSION: The correction formulas improved diagnostic accuracy of the 
CCAS-Scale, particularly for the sum raw score. Therefore, we recommend using 
the corrected sum raw score for evaluation instead of the uncorrected number of 
failed items, proposed originally Hoche (Brain 141:248-270, 2018). Some test 
items, however, did not differentiate well between patients and controls and 
MDCs were large, highlighting the need for refined CCAS assessment instruments 
as progression or treatment outcomes.

AIM: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major cause of dementia, marked by cognitive 
decline and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). Early 
differentiation between AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and healthy 
controls (HC) is essential for improving diagnostic accuracy and guiding 
effective treatment strategies.
METHODS: This retrospective study included 120 participants divided into AD 
(n = 40), MCI (n = 40), and HC (n = 40) groups. Brain MRI data were analyzed 
using the AccuBrain system to quantify AD Resemblance Atrophy Index (AD-RAI), 
Quantitative Medial Temporal Atrophy (QMTA), hippocampal volume, and white 
matter hyperintensities. Correlation analyses were conducted between imaging 
biomarkers and cognitive function scores (Mini-Mental State Examination, MMSE; 
Neuropsychiatric Inventory, NPI). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve 
analysis was used to evaluated the diagnostic performance of the biomarkers.
RESULTS: AD patients had significantly higher AD-RAI (0.91 ± 0.25) and more 
pronounced hippocampal atrophy (0.36 ± 0.09) compared to MCI and HC (P < 0.001). 
Correlation analyses showed that AD-RAI and QMTA were negatively correlated with 
MMSE scores (r = -0.718, P < 0.001; r = -0.463, P < 0.001), while hippocampal 
volume was positively correlated with MMSE (r = 0.408, P < 0.001). ROC analysis 
revealed that AD-RAI had an AUC of 0.777 for distinguishing AD from MCI, while 
QMTA had an AUC of 0.938 for distinguishing AD from HC. BPSD patients exhibited 
higher AD-RAI (1.09 ± 0.18) and greater hippocampal atrophy, with ROC AUC > 0.9 
for distinguishing BPSD from non-BPSD patients.
CONCLUSION: The AccuBrain MRI system demonstrated high sensitivity and 
diagnostic value in distinguishing AD from MCI and HC, as well as in identifying 
patients with BPSD. Correlation and ROC analyses support the use of these 
imaging biomarkers for early diagnosis and personalized treatment strategies in 
AD.

BACKGROUND: Pyroptosis, a highly inflammatory form of programmed cell death, 
plays a key role in diseases such as sepsis, rheumatoid arthritis, Alzheimer's 
disease, and COPD. It is driven by inflammasome activation, leading to the 
release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6), an essential 
micronutrient with known anti-inflammatory effects, has been suggested as a 
potential regulator of inflammasome activation and pyroptosis. This review 
examines current evidence on pyridoxine's role in modulating pyroptosis.
METHODS: A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science 
for studies published between 2014 and 2024. The search focused on pyridoxine's 
relationship with inflammation, inflammasomes, and pyroptosis pathways using 
keywords such as "pyridoxine," "Vitamin B6," "pyroptosis," "inflammasome," 
"caspase-1," and "gasdermin D." Both preclinical and human studies were 
reviewed, with emphasis on molecular mechanisms underlying pyridoxine's 
anti-inflammatory effects.
RESULTS: Studies consistently showed that pyridoxine reduced inflammasome 
activation, decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and inhibited 
caspase-1 (CASP-1) activity, thereby suppressing pyroptosis. Human studies, 
though indirect, linked higher pyridoxine levels to reduced systemic 
inflammation, suggesting a possible anti-pyroptotic effect.
CONCLUSIONS: Pyridoxine shows potential as an anti-pyroptotic agent due to its 
anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. However, further 
well-designed clinical trials are needed to confirm its role in controlling 
pyroptosis, especially in diseases associated with excessive inflammasome 
activation.

This study highlights the potential therapeutic benefits of oxymatrine (OMT), a 
quinolizidine alkaloid found in Sophora flavescens, for Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). This study connects the dots between metabolic and neuronal origins by 
exploring the effects of oxymatrine in slowing down hypercholesterolemic and 
fibrotic changes that contribute to cognitive deficits. In our study, laboratory 
rats were fed a high-cholesterol diet for eight weeks. Cognitive abilities were 
assessed weekly using Hebb's Williams Maze and Radial arm mazes. Additionally, 
intraperitoneal doses of OMT were administered (20 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg, and 80 
mg/kg) for 21 days. Furthermore, using ELISA, plasma and brain oxysterols, 
transforming growth factor β, amyloid β, matrix metalloproteinase- 9, claudin- 
5, and ATP Binding Cassette Transporter A1 levels were measured biweekly. 
High-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, aspartate aminotransferase, 
and alanine transaminase levels were estimated using diagnostic kits. The 
findings demonstrate that The administration of oxymatrine to experimental 
animals resulted in a dose-dependent synergistic decline in several biomarkers, 
including oxysterols, transforming growth factor β, amyloid β, matrix 
metalloproteinase- 9, low-density lipoprotein, aspartate aminotransferase, and 
alanine transaminase levels. At the same time, a concomitant increase in the 
levels of Claudin- 5, ATP Binding Cassette transporter A1, high-density 
lipoprotein, and antioxidants in the same animals was observed, especially at a 
dose of 80 mg/kg. This study aims to establish a link between metabolic and 
neural origins by investigating the effects of oxymatrine in reducing the 
progression of hypercholesterolemia and fibrosis, which contribute to cognitive 
impairment in AD. The research explores how oxymatrine regulates mediators 
involved in oxysterol production and fibrotic alterations in AD. Preliminary 
results suggest that oxymatrine has the potential to significantly delay the 
development and progression of AD, offering a promising treatment alternative 
for those affected by the disease. The findings of the present study strongly 
suggest that OMT effectively retards the progression of AD, which is commonly 
associated with the intake of high-cholesterol diets. Subsequent investigations 
ought to examine the molecular mechanisms behind oxymatrine's interaction with 
oxysterols and lipid metabolism, including sophisticated imaging methodologies 
and metabolomics. Longitudinal studies are essential to evaluate the long-term 
efficacy and safety of oxymatrine in both animal models and people. Exploring 
its possible synergistic effects with current medications may yield more 
effective therapeutic techniques. Identifying biomarkers for personalised 
medication may also be beneficial. Clinical trials and research on oxymatrine's 
potential as a prophylactic medication may yield significant insights.

Multiple sclerosis (MS), an auto-immune disease of the central nervous system 
(CNS) with inflammatory and neurodegenerative properties, remains an 
insufficiently understood disease despite more than 150 years of research. In 
contrast to diseases from other medical fields such as, for instance, oncology, 
a description of its clinical and non-clinical features based on readouts such 
as biomarkers is still in its infancy. While, in this regard, neurofilament 
light chain (NfL) seems to be a promising new tool, the significant intra- and 
interindividual variation of this serological marker somewhat limits its 
widespread applicability in everyday clinical reality. This has sparked novel 
studies in which glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was proposed as an 
on-top marker serving to improve overall specificity. In this context, it was 
found that MS disease progression was significantly more often associated with 
increased levels of both NfL and GFAP compared to increased NfL levels alone. 
This highlights the complexity of the disease while also emphasizing the 
potential benefits of introducing additional markers to enhance current options. 
We propose that nitrosative stress markers, such as nitrate, nitrite, and 
nitrotyrosine (3NT), could serve this purpose effectively.

A New Perspective on Agitation in Alzheimer's Disease: A Potential Paradigm 
Shift.

Ostergaard JR(1).

Boulevard 99, DK-8200 Aarhus, Denmark.

Agitation is a common and difficult-to-manage neuropsychiatric syndrome in 
dementia. Recently, an association with the autonomous nervous system has been 
suggested. From the literature researched, however, only two studies 
investigating autonomic function concomitant to agitation situations appeared; 
one case series comprised two American veterans with vascular and Alzheimer's 
dementia, respectively, and in a case series of patients with CLN3 (juvenile 
neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis), this was found to be the most common 
neurodegenerative disease leading to dementia in childhood. In both case series, 
the measurement of the autonomic system disclosed a parasympathetic withdrawal 
and sympathetic hyperactivity in the temporal context with agitated behavior. If 
the time-wise-related autonomic imbalance shown previously can be demonstrated 
in a larger cohort of patients with Alzheimer's disease, the use of 
transcutaneous vagal stimulation might be a potential paradigm shift in the 
treatment of agitation in Alzheimer's disease.

Recent studies show that patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) harbor specific 
methylation marks in the brain that, if accessible, could be used as epigenetic 
biomarkers. Liquid biopsy enables the study of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) 
fragments originated from dead cells, including neurons affected by 
neurodegenerative processes. Here, we isolated and epigenetically characterized 
plasma cfDNA from 35 patients with AD and 35 cognitively healthy controls by 
using the Infinium® MethylationEPIC BeadChip array. Bioinformatics analysis was 
performed to identify differential methylation positions (DMPs) and regions 
(DMRs), including APOE ε4 genotype stratified analysis. Plasma pTau181 (Simoa) 
and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) core biomarkers (Fujirebio) were also measured and 
correlated with differential methylation marks. Validation was performed with 
bisulfite pyrosequencing and bisulfite cloning sequencing. Epigenome-wide cfDNA 
analysis identified 102 DMPs associated with AD status. Most DMPs correlated 
with clinical cognitive and functional tests including 60% for Mini-Mental State 
Examination (MMSE) and 80% for Global Deterioration Scale (GDS), and with AD 
blood and CSF biomarkers. In silico functional analysis connected 30 DMPs to 
neurological processes, identifying key regulators such as SPTBN4 and APOE 
genes. Several DMRs were annotated to genes previously reported to harbor 
epigenetic brain changes in AD (HKR1, ZNF154, HOXA5, TRIM40, ATG16L2, ADAMST2) 
and were linked to APOE ε4 genotypes. Notably, a DMR in the HKR1 gene, 
previously shown to be hypermethylated in the AD hippocampus, was validated in 
cfDNA from an orthogonal perspective. These results support the feasibility of 
studying cfDNA to identify potential epigenetic biomarkers in AD. Thus, liquid 
biopsy could improve non-invasive AD diagnosis and aid personalized medicine by 
detecting epigenetic brain markers in blood.

Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) have exhibited promising 
therapeutic potential in Alzheimer's disease (AD), although the underlying 
mechanisms remain poorly understood. Previously established Alzheimer's disease 
neuron models derived from Ts21-induced pluripotent stem cells (Ts21-iPSCs) have 
been shown to exhibit progressive amyloid beta accumulation during neuronal 
differentiation. In this study, we employed a Transwell co-culture system to 
investigate the interaction between neurons derived from Ts21-iPSCs and ADSCs. 
Our findings revealed that co-culture with ADSCs significantly enhanced the 
survival rate of AD neurons. Proteomics analysis identified significant 
upregulation of left-right determination factor 2 (LEFTY2) protein in the 
co-culture medium. Supplementation with 2 nM LEFTY2 markedly improved the 
survival and growth of AD neurons. Furthermore, LEFTY2 effectively downregulates 
the expression of apolipoprotein E4 and amyloid beta 1-42, along with 
attenuating phosphorylated tau231 levels in AD neurons. These results suggest 
the potential of LEFTY2 as a promising therapeutic candidate for Alzheimer's 
disease.

Chronic alcohol consumption leads to excessive production of reactive oxygen 
species (ROS), driving oxidative stress that contributes to both alcohol use 
disorder (AUD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). This review explores how 
ROS-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation serve as shared 
pathological mechanisms linking these conditions. We highlight the role of 
alcohol-induced oxidative damage in exacerbating neurodegeneration and compare 
ROS-related pathways in AUD and AD. Finally, we discuss emerging therapeutic 
strategies, including mitochondrial antioxidants and inflammasome inhibitors, 
that target oxidative stress to mitigate neurodegeneration. Understanding these 
overlapping mechanisms may provide new insights for preventing and treating 
ROS-driven neurodegenerative disorders.

Repulsive guidance molecule-a (RGMa) has emerged as a significant therapeutic 
target in a variety of neurological disorders, including neurodegenerative 
diseases and acute conditions. This review comprehensively examines the 
multifaceted role of RGMa in central nervous system (CNS) pathologies such as 
Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 
multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, spinal cord injury, 
stroke, vascular dementia, auditory neuropathy, and epilepsy. The mechanisms 
through which RGMa contributes to neuroinflammation, neuronal degeneration, and 
impaired axonal regeneration are herein discussed. Evidence from preclinical 
studies associate RGMa overexpression with negative outcomes, such as increased 
neuroinflammation and synaptic loss, while RGMa inhibition, particularly the use 
of agents like elezanumab, has shown promise in enhancing neuronal survival and 
functional recovery. RGMa's responses concerning immunomodulation and 
neurogenesis highlight its potential as a therapeutic avenue. We emphasize 
RGMa's critical role in CNS pathology and its potential to pave the way for 
innovative treatment strategies in neurological disorders. While preclinical 
findings are encouraging so far, further clinical trials are needed to validate 
the safety and efficacy of RGMa-targeted therapies.

Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the degeneration of cholinergic neurons, 
which is primarily driven by the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme and 
oxidative stress. This study investigated the therapeutic potential of the 
cannabis-containing herbal remedy Suk-Saiyasna in alleviating amyloid β42 
(Aβ42)-induced cytotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells. The DPPH radical-scavenging 
activity and inhibitory effects on AChE were evaluated in vitro. The AChE 
inhibitory potential of 167 ligands, including cannabinoids, flavonoids, 
terpenoids, and alkaloids derived from Suk-Saiyasna, was assessed using ADMET 
analysis and molecular docking techniques. The results demonstrated that the 
Suk-Saiyasna extract exhibited a DPPH radical scavenging effect with an IC50 
value of 27.40 ± 1.15 µg/mL and notable AChE inhibitory activity with an IC50 of 
1.25 ± 0.35 mg/mL. Importantly, at a concentration of 1 µg/mL, the extract 
significantly protected cells from Aβ42-induced stress compared to controls. 
Docking studies revealed that delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC), 
mesuaferrone B, piperine, β-sitosterol, and chlorogenic acid exhibited 
substantial binding affinities to AChE, surpassing reference drugs like 
galantamine and rivastigmine. Furthermore, in silico ADMET predictions indicated 
that Δ9-THC and piperine possessed favorable pharmacokinetic profiles, including 
solubility, absorption, and blood-brain barrier permeability, with no 
neurotoxicity or carcinogenicity associated with Δ9-THC.

Circadian rhythm disruption is a modifiable risk factor for Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) progression, marked by neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and amyloid-β 
(Aβ) accumulation. Hypoxia-inducible factor 3α (Hif3α) has emerged as a key 
regulator of inflammatory and oxidative pathways. To evaluate the impacts of 
circadian disruption on AD progression and investigate the therapeutic potential 
of bamboo leaf flavonoids (BLFs), C57BL/6N mice (normal mice) and APP/PS1 
transgenic mice (AD mice) were exposed to circadian disruption via randomized 
light exposure and stress, as the in vivo model. Then, BLFs were administered to 
assess effects on neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and organ damage. Next, 
Nissl body staining and Aβ protein immunohistochemistry were performed to 
evaluate the effects of BLFs on brain pathology. Through transcriptome 
sequencing, key factors and the related pathway were screened out. In vitro, 
molecular mechanisms were explored in PC12 cells treated with Aβ42 and Hif3α 
siRNA fragments. Results demonstrated that circadian disruption increased 
oxidative stress and early liver and kidney damage degrees, with greater 
severity in AD mice. BLFs partially reversed oxidative damage and reduced Aβ 
deposition. Transcriptome analysis revealed upregulation of Hif3α in 
circadian-disrupted mice, linked to inflammation and oxidative stress. In vitro, 
the knockdown of Hif3α reduced inflammation and normalized protein expression, 
which could be regulated by BLFs and suppressed AD progression. In conclusion, 
circadian disruption exacerbated AD progression via regulating 
Hif3α/Rab7/TNFα/IL1β pathway. BLFs offered neuroprotection roles by mitigating 
inflammation and oxidative damage, highlighting Hif3α as a promising target for 
AD therapy and biomarker development.

This study aimed to investigate the inhibitory effect of the chloroform fraction 
(CF) from Vitis vinifera root extract on LPS-induced neuroinflammation in BV-2 
microglia cells and a C57/BL6J mouse model. CF significantly suppressed 
LPS-induced proinflammatory cytokines, including nitric oxide (NO), tumor 
necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in BV-2 microglia cells. 
Mechanistically, CF inhibited LPS-induced activation of nuclear factor-κB 
(NF-κB) by blocking the p65 subunit and preventing the phosphorylation of 
NF-kappa-B inhibitor α (IκBα), while its effect was independent of the 
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Furthermore, CF modulated the 
TRIF signaling pathway by regulating TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and interferon 
regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), which contributed to the suppression of inflammatory 
mediators in BV-2 microglia cells. In vivo, we evaluated the neuroprotective 
effects of CF against cognitive dysfunction and inflammatory responses in an 
LPS-induced mouse model. Our behavioral assessments, including the Morris water 
maze and Y-maze tests, demonstrated that CF alleviated LPS-induced spatial 
learning impairment and cognitive decline. Additionally, CF significantly 
reduced the levels of inflammatory cytokines in serum and inflammatory mediators 
proteins expression in whole brain in LPS-injected mice, suggesting a direct 
link between reduced inflammatory responses and improved cognitive function. 
These findings suggest that CF from V. vinifera root extract may serve as a 
potential therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases mediated by 
microglial activation, such as Alzheimer's disease.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, characterized by 
β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, leading to neuronal loss and 
cognitive impairments. Recent studies have reported the dysregulation of RNA 
splicing in AD pathogenesis. Our previous transcriptomic study demonstrated the 
neuroprotective effect of the phytocannabinoid cannabinerol (CBNR) against the 
cell viability loss induced by Aβ in differentiated SH-SY5Y cells. This study 
also highlighted the deregulation of genes involved in mRNA splicing after Aβ 
exposure or CBNR pre-treatment. Here, we investigated whether CBNR could restore 
the splicing defects induced by Aβ in an AD in vitro model. Using the rMATS 
computational tool for detecting differential alternative splicing events 
(DASEs) from RNA-Seq data, we obtained 96 DASEs regulated in both conditions 
and, remarkably, they were all restored by CBNR pre-treatment. The pathway 
analysis indicated an over-representation of the "Alzheimer's disease-amyloid 
secretase pathway". Additionally, we observed that Aβ exposure increased the 
frequency of retained introns (RIs) among the shared DASEs, and that this 
frequency returned to normality by CBNR pre-treatment. Interestingly, most of 
these RIs contain a premature in-frame stop codon within the RNA sequence. 
Finally, analyzing the DASE regions for miRNA hybridization, we found 33 
potential DASE/miRNA interactions that were relevant in AD pathogenesis. These 
findings revealed a novel trans-gene regulation by CBNR, potentially explaining 
part of its neuroprotective role. This is the first study demonstrating the 
involvement of a cannabinoid in the regulation of mRNA splicing in an AD model.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by 
cognitive decline, neuroinflammation and neuronal damage. This study aimed to 
investigate the neuroprotective effects of cilomilast (CILO), a 
phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) inhibitor, alone and in combination with chlorogenic 
acid (CGA), a natural polyphenol, against scopolamine (SCOP)-induced cognitive 
impairment in mice. Forty male albino mice were divided into five groups: normal 
control, SCOP control, CGA + SCOP, CILO + SCOP and CILO + CGA + SCOP. Behavioral 
assessments, including the Y-maze and pole climbing tests, demonstrated that 
SCOP significantly impaired cognition, while treatment with CILO and CGA 
reversed these deficits, with the combination group showing the greatest 
improvement. Histopathological analyses revealed that CILO and CGA reduced 
neuronal damage and amyloid beta (Aβ) accumulation. Immunohistochemical and 
biochemical assessments confirmed a decrease in neuroinflammatory markers, 
including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and nuclear factor kappa B 
(NF-κB). Molecular analyses showed that CILO restored cyclic adenosine 
monophosphate (cAMP) levels, leading to activation of protein kinase A (PKA), 
cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and brain-derived neurotrophic 
factor (BDNF), key regulators of neuronal plasticity and survival. CGA enhanced 
these effects by further inhibiting PDE4, amplifying the neuroprotective 
response. These findings suggest that PDE4 inhibitors, particularly in 
combination with CGA, may represent promising therapeutic strategies for 
AD-related cognitive impairment.

Metabolic disorders and brain insulin resistance (IR) are major risk factors for 
the development of neurodegenerative conditions. Kumquat fruit (KF) 
administration has demonstrated significant anti-dysmetabolic effects, improving 
peripheral IR in murine models of metabolic syndrome. Along these lines, this 
study evaluated the neuroprotective effects of KF supplementation in a model of 
dysmetabolism-induced neuronal damage and its ability to counteract the 
disruption of brain insulin signalling. To this end, biochemical and 
histological analysis assessed neuroapoptosis, disruption of brain insulin 
signalling and neuroinflammation in a model of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced 
neuronal damage. Our findings demonstrate, for the first time, that KF 
supplementation significantly counteracts HFD-induced neuroapoptosis 
downregulating pro-apoptotic genes (FAS-L, BIM and P27) and upregulating the 
anti-apoptotic ones (BDNF and BCL-2). Coherently, KF positively influenced the 
expression of selected genes related to Alzheimer's Disease. Relevantly, these 
effects were associated to KF ability to restore brain insulin signalling by 
increasing insulin receptor expression, reducing IRS-1 serine phosphorylation, 
enhancing both AKT activation and GSK-3β inactivation. Accordingly, KF 
suppressed HFD-neuroinflammation, counteracting the overexpression of NF-κB and 
its downstream enzymatic products, iNOS and COX-2. Collectively, these findings 
demonstrate the neuroprotective benefits of KF administration, supporting its 
potential as a dietary intervention for dysmetabolic-related neurodegenerative 
disorders.

Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), including Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's 
disease (HD), and prion disease, represent a group of age-related disorders that 
pose a growing and formidable challenge to global health. Despite decades of 
extensive research that has uncovered key genetic factors and biochemical 
pathways, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying these diseases and 
effective therapeutic strategies remain elusive. Caenorhabditis elegans (C. 
elegans) has emerged as a powerful model organism for studying NDDs due to its 
unique biological features such as genetic tractability, conserved molecular 
pathways, and ease of high-throughput screening. This model provides an 
exceptional platform for identifying molecular targets associated with NDDs and 
developing novel therapeutic interventions. This review highlights the critical 
role of C. elegans in elucidating the complex molecular mechanisms of human 
NDDs, with a particular focus on recent advancements and its indispensable 
contributions to the discovery of molecular targets and therapeutic strategies 
for these NDDs.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the presence of amyloid-beta (Aβ) 
plaques, which trigger oxidative stress and neuronal cell death. The present 
study investigated the neuroprotective effects of Oroxylum indicum (L.) leaf 
(OIL) extract against Aβ-induced oxidative stress and cellular damage in SH-SY5Y 
cells. The cells were treated with OIL extract with and without Aβ25-35, and 
their viability was investigated. Moreover, the mechanism of action of OIL was 
assessed by determining caspase-3 levels, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and 
malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, enzymatic activity of catalase (CAT), superoxide 
dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), phosphorylation of 
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt), extracellular 
signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), and cAMP-responsive element-binding 
protein (CREB), and expression of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) proteins. The 
results indicated that OIL reduced Aβ-induced neurotoxicity in a 
concentration-dependent manner, improving cell viability, reducing ROS levels 
and MDA production, increasing antioxidant enzyme activity of CAT, SOD, and 
GSH-Px, and decreasing caspase-3 expression. In addition, OIL enhanced 
phosphorylation of Akt, ERK1/2, and CREB and upregulated Bcl-2 protein 
expression. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis identified 
oroxylin A, baicalein, and chrysin as the major phenolic constituents of the OIL 
extract. The findings suggest that the extract holds promise as a therapeutic 
intervention against Aβ-induced neurotoxicity, offering potential implications 
for the treatment of AD. Further studies are needed to investigate the activity 
of OIL in primary neurons or in vivo.

Interferon Regulatory Factors as a Potential Therapeutic Target for 
Neuroinflammation: A Focus on Alzheimer's Disease.

Interferon Regulatory Factors (IRFs) are critical modulators of immune and 
inflammatory responses, yet their roles in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other 
neurodegenerative disorders remain incompletely understood. While IRFs are 
recognized for their regulatory functions in neuroinflammation, microglial 
activation, and neuronal survival, their dual roles as both drivers of 
pathological inflammation and mediators of neuroprotective pathways underscore a 
sophisticated regulatory paradox in neurodegenerative disorders. This review 
aims to synthesize current evidence on IRF-mediated neuroinflammation in AD and 
related diseases, focusing on the multifaceted functions of key IRF family 
members, including IRF1, IRF3, and IRF7. We critically evaluate their divergent 
roles: IRF1 and IRF3, for instance, exacerbate neuroinflammatory cascades and 
amyloid-beta (Aβ) pathology in AD, whereas IRF7 may paradoxically suppress 
inflammation under specific conditions. Additionally, we explore IRF 
dysregulation in Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis, and Huntington's disease, emphasizing shared and distinct mechanisms 
across neurodegenerative disorders. Restoring IRF balance through genetic 
manipulation, small-molecule inhibitors, or microbiome-derived modulators could 
attenuate neuroinflammation, enhance Aβ clearance, and protect neuronal 
integrity. Ultimately, this work provides a framework for future research to 
harness IRF signaling pathways in the development of precision therapies for AD 
and other neurodegenerative diseases.

The growing demand for agricultural products has led to the misuse of 
pesticides, resulting in the use of higher concentrations of these substances. 
This has led to an increase in toxicity imposed on other beneficial organisms 
and to the bioaccumulation of toxic pesticide concentrations in the bodies of 
both pests and non-target organisms, as well as in their end users, including 
humans. In this study, the neurotoxic potential of the commonly used pesticides 
abamectin (an insecticide) and boscalid (a fungicide) was evaluated. Both in 
vitro and in silico studies showed that human butyrylcholinesterase is not a 
target for abamectins B1A and B1B. Boscalid showed a modest Glide score (-28.8 
kJ/mol) and a considerably higher IC50 (308.8 µM) against human 
butyrylcholinesterase than the approved inhibitor 
(2-((1-(benzenesulfonyl)-1H-indol-4-yl)oxy)ethyl)(benzyl)amine (IC50 = 0.473 
µM). However, due to its non-mutagenicity and low toxicity, structural analogues 
of boscalid might be considered as candidates for the symptomatic treatment of 
Alzheimer's disease. Molecular dynamics simulations over 100 ns confirmed the 
stability of boscalid within the active site of butyrylcholinesterase, where it 
maintained key interactions with catalytic residues such as Trp82 and His438. 
These findings highlight its potential as a starting point for structure-based 
drug design strategies aimed at optimizing cholinesterase inhibitors with 
improved pharmacokinetic properties. According to absorption, distribution, 
metabolism, elimination, and toxicity studies, boscalid is orally active, which 
cannot be attributed to abamectins B1A and B1B.

BACKGROUND: Some short-term vitamin D supplementation trials suggest benefits on 
cognitive performance, but apart from observational studies, there is little 
evidence whether long-term vitamin D supplementation can prevent development of 
dementia. We investigated whether vitamin D3 supplementation could affect the 
incidence of diagnosed dementia in a generally healthy population.
METHODS: The study included 2 492 participants from the Finnish Vitamin D Trial, 
free of diagnosed dementia at baseline. They were randomized to placebo, 1 600 
IU/d, or 3 200 IU/d of vitamin D3 arm for up to 5 years. Incident diagnoses of 
dementia were obtained from the national care registries.
RESULTS: The mean age of the participants at baseline was 68.2 years and 42.8% 
were female. During the mean follow-up of 4.2 years, 18 participants in the 
placebo arm, 14 participants in the 1 600 IU/d arm (compared to placebo, hazard 
ratio [HR] = 0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.38-1.55), and 13 participants 
in the 3 200 IU/d arm (HR = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.35-1.48) were diagnosed with 
dementia. Of the diagnoses, 29 were Alzheimer's disease, without statistically 
significant differences in the event rates between the 3 arms. Age, sex, or body 
mass index did not modify the effects. In the subgroup of 550 participants, the 
mean baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration was 74.8 nmol/L. After 12 
months, the mean concentrations were 73.0, 99.7, and 120.4 nmol/L in the 
placebo, 1 600 IU/d, and 3 200 IU/d arms, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Five-year, medium-dose or high-dose vitamin D3 supplementation did 
not affect the dementia incidence in this largely vitamin D-sufficient older 
population.

The gut-brain axis has emerged as a key player in the regulation of brain 
function and cognitive health. Gut microbiota dysbiosis has been observed in 
preclinical models of Alzheimer's disease and patients. Manipulating the 
composition of the gut microbiota enhances or delays neuropathology and 
cognitive deficits in mouse models. Accordingly, the health status of the animal 
facility may strongly influence these outcomes. In the present study, we 
longitudinally analyzed the fecal microbiota composition and amyloid pathology 
of 5XFAD mice housed in a specific opportunistic pathogen-free (SOPF) and a 
conventional facility. The composition of the microbiota of 5XFAD mice after 
aging in conventional facility showed marked differences compared to WT 
littermates that were not observed when the mice were bred in SOPF facility. The 
development of amyloid pathology was also enhanced by conventional housing. We 
then transplanted fecal microbiota (FMT) from both sources into wild-type (WT) 
mice and measured memory performance, assessed in the novel object recognition 
test, in transplanted animals. Mice transplanted with microbiota from 
conventionally bred 5XFAD mice showed impaired memory performance, whereas FMT 
from mice housed in SOPF facility did not induce memory deficits in transplanted 
mice. Finally, 18 weeks of housing SOPF-born animals in a conventional facility 
resulted in the reappearance of specific microbiota compositions in 5XFAD vs WT 
mice. In conclusion, these results show a strong impact of housing conditions on 
microbiota-associated phenotypes and question the relevance of breeding 
preclinical models in specific pathogen-free (SPF) facilities.
IMPORTANCE: Housing conditions affect the composition of the gut microbiota. Gut 
microbiota of 6-month-old conventionally bred Alzheimer's mice is dysbiotic. Gut 
dysbiosis is absent in Alzheimer's mice housed in highly sanitized facilities. 
Transfer of fecal microbiota from conventionally bred mice affects cognition. 
Microbiota of mice housed in highly sanitized facilities has no effect on 
cognition.

BACKGROUND: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a novel therapy for severe 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, there is an ongoing debate regarding the 
optimal target for DBS, particularly the fornix and the basal ganglia of Meynert 
(NBM).
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of DBS for 
severe AD and to compare the fornix and the NBM as potential targets.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective, nonrandomized clinical study involving 20 
patients with severe AD (MMSE score 0 to 10, CDR level 3) from January 2015 to 
August 2022, comprising 12 males and eight females, with a mean age of 
59.05 ± 6.45 years. All patients underwent DBS treatment, among which 14 
received bilateral fornix implantation, while six received bilateral 
implantation in the NBM. Electrical stimulation commenced 1 month 
postoperatively. We assessed the patients before surgery, followed by 
evaluations at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months poststimulation. 
Primary outcome measures focused on changes in cognitive function, assessed 
using the MMSE, MoCA, ADAS-Cog, and CDR scales. Secondary measures encompassed 
quality of life, caregiver burden, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and sleep 
disturbances, evaluated through the BI, FAQ, FIM, ZBI, NPI, HAMA, HAMD, and PSQI 
scales.
RESULTS: All patients tolerated DBS well, with no serious adverse effects 
reported. Early on, DBS significantly improved cognitive function and quality of 
life. Long-term benefits include the improvement of neuropsychiatric symptoms 
and sleep disorders and the alleviation of caregiver burden. Comparison between 
DBS targeting the NBM and fornix revealed no significant differences in overall 
scale scores. However, upon deeper analysis, NBM-DBS exhibited a more pronounced 
improvement in neuropsychiatric symptoms, particularly in NPI scores.
CONCLUSION: DBS is a potential therapeutic approach for severe AD, capable of 
improving patients' cognitive function, quality of life, and neuropsychiatric 
symptoms. Notably, NBM-DBS showed distinct advantages in ameliorating 
neuropsychiatric symptoms, providing valuable insights for clinically selecting 
the optimal DBS target.

Ergothioneine and lactoferrin show antioxidant and neuroprotective effects, but 
their interactive effects and underlying mechanisms on Alzheimer's disease are 
unclear. This study aims to investigate the synergistic neuroprotective effect 
for a combination of ergothioneine and lactoferrin and the molecular mechanisms 
in APP/PS1 transgenic mice and neuroblast N2a cells. In transgenic mice, the 
combination of ergothioneine and lactoferrin improved cognitive function and 
alleviated typical Alzheimer's disease's pathological characteristics of Aβ 
aggregation and tau phosphorylation. In N2a cells, compared with ergothioneine 
or lactoferrin alone, their combination synergistically increased cell viability 
by approximately 15% and decreased apoptosis by 5% in flow cytometry. The 
combination of ergothioneine and lactoferrin showed a more enhanced antioxidant 
efficacy through Keap1/Nrf2-mediated mechanisms in comparison to ergothioneine 
or lactoferrin alone. In summary, the combination of ergothioneine and 
lactoferrin synergistically enhances neuroprotection in APP/PS1 transgenic mice 
and N2a cells, providing a foundation for the development of functional foods 
for the prevention and control of Alzheimer's disease.

INTRODUCTION: The approval of lecanemab-irmb offers potential disease-modifying 
treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but geographical access barriers to 
infusion and amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) imaging sites might 
prevent timely access to the drug. We examined disparities in access to 
lecanemab infusion sites and amyloid PET scan facilities in Georgia's 159 
counties.
METHODS: Facility location maps were used to examine lecanemab access. We used 
drive time analysis to identify and map counties by drive time.
RESULTS: No rural county had an amyloid PET scan center and only one had a 
lecanemab infusion center. Residents in rural counties need to drive > 1 hour on 
average to reach the nearest facility, which is statistically significantly 
longer than those in non-rural counties.
DISCUSSION: Lack of access and long drive times pose health equity issues for 
those in rural counties, which already have a higher percentage of older 
residents and a higher prevalence of behavioral AD risk factors.
HIGHLIGHTS: We mapped amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) scan and 
lecanemab infusion facilities in Georgia. We examined the drive time to the 
nearest facility in each county. One lecanemab infusion facility and no amyloid 
PET scan facilities were found in rural counties. The mean drive time to the 
nearest facility is significantly longer for rural counties. The results call 
for policies and resources to address this health disparity issue.

INTRODUCTION: Disrupted rest-activity rhythms (RARs) have been linked to poorer 
cognitive function and Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers. Here we extend this 
work to midlife women, who commonly experience menopause-related sleep and 
cognitive problems.
METHODS: One hundred ninety-four postmenopausal participants underwent a 
neuropsychological evaluation, 72 h of wrist actigraphy generating RAR 
variables, and a blood draw to measure AD biomarkers: phosphorylated tau 
(p-tau181, p-tau231) and amyloid beta (Aβ40, Aβ42).
RESULTS: Lower interdaily stability (IS) and relative amplitude (RA) and higher 
interdaily variability (IV) and least active 5 h (L5) were associated with worse 
processing speed, independent of sleep. Adjustment for sleep significantly 
attenuated the associations of RA with memory. Lower RA was associated with 
higher p-tau231 level, independent of sleep. Further adjustment for 
menopause-related factors modestly accounted for the associations between RAR, 
cognitive measures, and AD biomarkers.
DISCUSSION: Weaker RAR, particularly RA, was associated with worse cognitive 
functions, and higher AD biomarkers levels, possibly linking RAR with AD 
pathology in women.
HIGHLIGHTS: Lower rhythm stability and robustness and higher fragmentation were 
associated with worse processing speed.Lower robustness was associated with 
higher levels of phosphorylated tau-231.Menopause factors did not attenuate the 
association between rest-activity rhythms and cognitive function.

Anti-amyloid beta monoclonal antibodies (anti-Aβ mAbs) have received approval 
from the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients with mild 
cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (collectively 
known as early AD) based on evidence from clinical trials. However, whether 
findings from these trials are generalizable to the real world is uncertain. We 
need reliable evidence on the real-world safety of these treatments to inform 
decision making for clinicians, patients, and caregivers. Using lecanemab as an 
exemplar, we outline the key considerations in designing and implementing an 
observational study on safety and utilization outcomes using established 
administrative healthcare claims data sources with the target trial emulation 
framework. The target trial emulation framework is a rigorous causal inference 
framework that minimizes common biases in observational studies. The approach 
proposed here can be applied to evaluation of additional mAbs as they become 
available.
HIGHLIGHTS: Little is known about real-world safety of anti-amyloid beta 
monoclonal antibodies for early Alzheimer's disease.Existing real-world data can 
support studies of their safety and utilization outcomes.Target trial emulation 
can guide the design of these studies while minimizing bias.We provide key 
design and analytical considerations for future studies.

BACKGROUND: Lecanemab is a humanized murine IgG1 antibody. Recent Phase 3 
clinical trials have demonstrated its ability to reduce brain amyloid-β (Aβ) 
load and slow cognitive decline in patients with early Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
However, since its approval, reports on adverse effects (AEs) associated with 
lecanemab have been limited. To better understand the AEs related to lecanemab 
and provide guidance for future clinical use, we analyzed lecanemab-associated 
AEs using data from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse 
Event Reporting System (FAERS).
METHODS: We extracted all AEs reports from the FAERS database for the period 
from the first quarter of 2023 to the third quarter of 2024. Using the Reporting 
Odds Ratio (ROR), Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), Bayesian Confidence 
Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN), and Multi-item Gamma Poisson Shrinker (MGPS) 
algorithms, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of lecanemab-related AEs, 
restricting the analysis to AEs with the role code of primary suspect (PS).
RESULTS: A total of 811 AEs reports related to lecanemab used in AD patients and 
506 AEs in Non-AD patients were included. The preferred terms (PTs) identified 
as positive across all four algorithms included headache, Amyloid Related 
Imaging Abnormalities-oedema/effusion (ARIA-E), chills, Amyloid Related Imaging 
Abnormalities-haemosiderosis/microhaemorrhage (ARIA-H), fatigue, 
infusion-related reaction, nausea, pyrexia, pain, influenza like illness, and so 
on. Among these, ARIA-E, ARIA-H, brain oedema and status epilepticus were 
associated with Important Medical Events (IMEs) for AD patients, and brain 
oedema, cerebral haemorrhage, cerebral microhaemorrhage, subdural haematoma, 
ischaemic stroke, cerebral infarction were associated with IMEs for Non-AD 
patients. At the system organ class (SOC) level, the highest signal detection 
for lecanemab was observed in nervous system disorders among AD and Non-AD 
patients [ROR for AD: 2.42 (2.2-2.65); ROR for Non-AD: 6.97 (6.12-7.95)]. The 
median time to the occurrence of these AEs was 44 days after administration in 
AD patients and 30 days for Non-AD patients.
CONCLUSION: This study utilized the FAERS database to evaluate 
lecanemab-associated AEs in AD and non-AD patients, along with their temporal 
patterns post-marketing authorization, thereby establishing a foundation for 
subsequent clinical pharmacovigilance. A biweekly 10 mg/kg was identified as the 
optimal therapeutic dosage. ARIA emerged as frequent treatment-related AEs, with 
APOEɛ4 carriers demonstrating heightened susceptibility. This necessitates 
serial brain MRI surveillance for all patients during treatment, aimed not only 
at early ARIA detection but also vigilant monitoring of IMEs including cerebral 
haemorrhage, cerebral microhaemorrhages, subdural haematoma, cerebral edema, 
ischaemic stroke, and cerebral infarction. While AD patients predominantly 
exhibited non-specific clinical manifestations, non-AD cohorts showed elevated 
risks of stroke-related complications. Consequently, dynamic neurological 
deficit monitoring is indispensable for non-AD populations receiving lecanemab 
to mitigate adverse outcomes. Finally, comprehensive reassessment of 
anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy indications is warranted in both AD and 
non-AD patients to reduce hemorrhagic risks.

Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) B receptors (GABABRs) that acts slowly and 
maintains the inhibitory tone are versatile regulators in the complex nervous 
behaviors and their involvement in various neuropsychiatric disorders, such as 
anxiety, epilepsy, pain, drug addiction, and Alzheimer's disease. Additional 
study advances have implied the crucial roles of GABABRs in regulating 
feeding-related behaviors, yet their therapeutic potential in addressing the 
neuropsychiatric disorders, binge eating, and feeding-related disorders remains 
underutilized. This general review summarized the physiological structure and 
functions of GABABR, explored the regulation in various psychiatric disorders, 
feeding behaviors, binge eating, and metabolism disorders, and fully discussed 
the potential of targeting GABABRs and its regulator-binding sites for the 
treatment of different psychiatric disorders, binge eating and even obesity. 
While agonists that directly bind to GABABR1 have some negative side effects, 
positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) that bind to GABABR2 demonstrate excellent 
therapeutic efficacy and tolerability and have better safety and therapeutic 
indexes. Moreover, phosphorylation sites of downstream GABABRs regulators may be 
novel therapeutic targets for psychiatric disorders, binge eating, and obesity. 
Further studies, clinical trials in particular, will be essential for confirming 
the therapeutic value of PAMs and other agents targeting the GABABR pathways in 
a clinical setting.

BACKGROUND: Long-term therapy with nucleos(t)ide analogs (NUCs) is inevitable 
for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients. However, how NUC therapy on the 
developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) in these patients remains controversial.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used the Korean National Health 
Insurance Service claims database from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2013, 
treatment naïve CHB patients and those without previously diagnosed with AD. 
Participants were followed from the index date until either the diagnosis of AD 
or the study's conclusion on December 31, 2021. The primary outcome was the 
incidence of AD, compared between the group with initiated NUC therapy 
(n = 18,365) at cohort entry and the group without NUC therapy (n = 212,820).
RESULTS: During the study, 416 patients were diagnosed with AD. After 
propensity-score matching (18,365 pairs), the 5- to 7-year follow-up showed a 
significantly lower hazard ratio (HR) in the NUC-treated group compared to the 
untreated group (HR 0.31-0.40), with HRs remaining constant over time. Subgroup 
analysis showed more pronounced benefits of NUC therapy in patients under 65 
years (HRs: 0.22 vs. 1.23; P < 0.05) and those without dyslipidemia (HRs: 0.14 
vs. 1.09; P < 0.05). Protective effects were also observed across subgroups with 
hypertension, chronic kidney disease, heart disease, and a history of brain 
trauma, consistent with AD risk factor trends.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study analyses suggest that NUC therapy appears to have a 
protective effect against the development of AD in patients with CHB.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is among the leading cause of nursing home 
admission (NHA). Identifying potentially modifiable factors associated with the 
risk of NHA is crucial to reduce this risk in individuals with AD.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the relationship between comorbidity burden, as 
measured by the Charlson comorbidity index, the multimorbidity-weighted index 
and the health related quality of life comorbidity index, and NHA in patients 
with AD.
METHODS: We conducted an observational longitudinal study including patients 
from the MEMORA real-life cohort. Patients had to be aged 60 years or older, 
with a diagnosis of AD. The association between comorbidity indices and 
occurrence of NHA was assessed using Cox proportional-hazards models and 
competing-risks regressions considering mortality as a competing event. All 
analyses were adjusted for age, sex, educational level, stage of AD and the 
presence of neuropsychiatric symptoms.
RESULTS: Overall, 488 AD patients were included (68.2% with dementia). There 
were 125 (26%) NHA that occurred during the follow-up, with a median time of 25 
months until NHA. Higher level of comorbidity burden as measured by the three 
comorbidity indices was associated with higher risk of NHA compared to lower 
level of comorbidity burden. Similar findings were found after considering 
mortality as a competing event, with a HR of 2.41(95%CI:1.36-4.28, p = 0.003) 
for MWI, an HR of 1.96(95%CI:1.22-3.17, p = 0.006), and an HR of 
1.68(95%CI:1.04-2.71, p = 0.034).
CONCLUSION: The implementation of appropriate interventions that aim to improve 
the management of the comorbidity burden could help to reduce the risk of NHA in 
individuals with AD.

In recent years, nanoparticle (NP) systems have demonstrated significant promise 
in pharmaceutical applications. This study focused on the development of 
donepezil hydrochloride-loaded PLGA-NPs, prepared using the 'Double Emulsion 
Solvent Evaporation' method. The impact of varying concentrations of polyvinyl 
alcohol-(PVA) in the aqueous phase and sonication time on NP characteristics was 
comprehensively examined. Results showed that increasing PVA concentration and 
sonication time resulted in a reduction in NP size, with an optimal formulation 
(I-DNP) achieving a particle size of 136.37 nm ± 0.93 and a PDI of 
0.122 ± 0.011, indicating uniformity. The zeta potential was measured at 
- 24.17mV ± 1.21, confirming the electrostatic stability of the formulation, 
essential for long-term stability. Trehalose was incorporated to enhance 
stability, and gastrointestinal stability testing revealed that I-DNP degraded 
faster in acidic environments. The encapsulation efficiency reached 
69.22 ± 4.84%, suggesting effective drug loading, and release studies exhibited 
a sustained release profile, with a Fickian and non-Fickian release mechanism. 
DSC, FT-IR, and 1H-NMR analyses confirmed the encapsulation and structural 
integrity of the formulation. In biological activity studies, I-DNP exhibited 
potent anti-AChE and anti-BuChE activities, with Chorioallantoic Membrane (CAM) 
assays showing significant inhibition of angiogenesis. These findings highlight 
the potential of I-DNP as a promising therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's 
disease, demonstrating its ability to enhance drug stability, controlled 
release, and potential blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration. Future studies 
will focus on long-term stability testing and in vivo Alzheimer's models to 
further validate its clinical applicability. This research contributes to the 
advancement of nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems for neurodegenerative 
diseases, paving the way for innovative therapeutic approaches.

Parkinson's disease is a complex neurological ailment manifested by dopaminergic 
neurodegeneration in the substantia nigra of the brain. This study investigates 
the molecular tripartite interaction between Lewy bodies, amyloid beta, and tau 
protein in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Lewy bodies which have been 
found as the important pathological hallmark in the degenerative neurons of 
Parkinson's patients, are mainly composed of α-synuclein. The accumulation of 
α-synuclein has been directly and indirectly linked to the severity and degree 
of progression of the disease. In addition, approximately 50% of Parkinson's 
disease cases are also described by hyperphosphorylation of tau protein 
indicating its significant involvement in the disease. The study further 
explains how α-synuclein, tau and amyloid beta can spread via cross-seeding 
mechanisms and accelerate each other's aggregation leading to neuronal death. 
Both GSK-3β and CDK5 are involved in phosphorylation which among other effects 
contributes to the misfolding of both α-synuclein and tau proteins that lead to 
neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease. Several mediators, that contribute to 
mitochondrial damage through elevated oxidative stress pathology are clearly 
described. Because of the increase in the incidence of Parkinson's disease, as 
predicted to be 17 million when the study was being conducted, studying these 
pathological mechanisms is very important in trying to establish treatments. 
This work contributes a path to finding a multi-target treatment regimen to 
alleviate the burden of this devastating disease.

Despite observational studies suggesting a link between chronic musculoskeletal 
pain (CMP) and increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia, the causal 
nature of this relationship remains uncertain due to potential confounding 
factors and reverse causality. We employed two-sample Mendelian Randomization 
(TSMR), bidirectional MR, mediation MR, drug-target MR, and colocalization 
analysis, along with gene set enrichment and protein-protein interaction (PPI) 
analyses. TSMR assessed the causal associations between CMP and the risk of 
dementia and its subtypes, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia 
(VaD), Lewy body dementia (LBD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and Parkinson's 
disease (PD). Bidirectional MR evaluated reverse causality, while mediation 
analyses identified potential mediators, focusing on neuroimaging and cognitive 
phenotypes. Drug-target MR investigated the role of the SLC39A8 gene, and 
colocalization analysis determined shared causal genetic variants. Gene set 
enrichment and PPI analyses elucidated the biological pathways implicated in the 
CMP-dementia relationship. Robust evidence established a causal relationship 
between chronic low back pain (LBP) and increased risk of PD, with knee 
osteoarthritis identified as a partial mediator, suggesting a pathway involving 
chronic inflammation. Bidirectional MR analysis revealed no evidence of reverse 
causality, further supporting the unidirectional causal link from LBP to PD. 
Colocalization analysis confirmed distinct genetic architectures for LBP and PD, 
while drug-target MR implicated the SLC39A8 gene as a potential mediator. Gene 
set enrichment and PPI analyses highlighted critical biological pathways, such 
as purine metabolism and glutamate receptor signaling. Suggestive evidence 
indicated potential causal links between limb pain and overall dementia, myalgia 
and VaD, as well as potential protective effects of Polymyalgia Rheumatica (PMR) 
against AD and rheumatism against PD. This study reveals a complex causal 
relationship between CMP and neurodegenerative diseases, particularly the robust 
link between LBP and PD. The findings underscore the need for further research 
to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and inform targeted prevention and 
treatment strategies.

Many drug targets in ongoing Parkinson's disease (PD) clinical trials have 
strong genetic links. While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) nominate 
regions associated with disease, pinpointing causal genes is challenging. Our 
aim was to prioritize additional druggable genes underlying PD GWAS signals. The 
polygenic priority score (PoPS) integrates genome-wide information from MAGMA 
gene-level associations and over 57,000 gene-level features. We applied PoPS to 
East Asian and European PD GWAS data and prioritized genes based on PoPS, 
distance to the GWAS signal, and non-synonymous credible set variants. We 
prioritized 46 genes, including well-established PD genes (SNCA, LRRK2, GBA1, 
TMEM175, VPS13C), genes with strong literature evidence supporting a mechanistic 
link to PD (RIT2, BAG3, SCARB2, FYN, DYRK1A, NOD2, CTSB, SV2C, ITPKB), and genes 
relatively unexplored in PD. Many hold potential for drug repurposing or 
development. We prioritized high-confidence genes with strong links to PD 
pathogenesis that may represent our next-best candidates for developing 
disease-modifying therapeutics.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder marked by 
β-amyloid accumulation, tau pathology, and impaired metabolic waste clearance. 
Recent evidence suggests that meningeal lymphatic vessels (MLVs) contribute 
significantly to the drainage of cerebrospinal and interstitial fluid. Deep 
cervical lymphaticovenous anastomosis (LVA), a microsurgical technique designed 
to enhance this drainage, has been proposed as a potential therapeutic strategy 
for AD. Preliminary findings from exploratory studies in China indicate possible 
cognitive and biomarker improvements, but current evidence is limited by small 
sample sizes, non-randomized designs, and methodological variability. Without 
standardized protocols and rigorous clinical validation, the broader 
applicability of LVA remains uncertain. Further investigation through 
multicenter, controlled trials is essential to objectively assessing its safety, 
efficacy, and clinical relevance in the management of AD.

Impaired memory retrieval is one of the cognitive markers in the early stage of 
Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Previous studies report that exchange protein directly 
activated by cAMP 2 (Epac2) plays a specific and time-limited role in promoting 
memory retrieval. In this study, we investigated the effect of a novel Epac2 
activator, S220, on neuronal and synaptic activities, and memory impairment in 
an acute AD mouse model. S220 treatment increased the firing rate of action 
potential and intracellular calcium in primary neuronal cultures. Moreover, S220 
treatment increased synaptic currents in CA1 neurons. In the acute AD mouse 
model, intrahippocampal injection of amyloid-β (Aβ) oligomers impaired memory 
performance. Notably, administering S220 20 min before retention of contextual 
fear conditioning recovered the Aβ-induced memory impairment, suggesting an 
enhancing effect on memory retrieval. Collectively, our data demonstrate that 
the novel Epac2 activator S220 promotes synaptic communication and neuronal 
firing, and thereby improves Aβ-induced memory impairment via enhancing memory 
retrieval, indicating the role of Epac2 as a potential treatment target for AD.

With population aging, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is becoming increasingly 
prevalent, causing great health and economic burdens worldwide. Despite decades 
of research, there are still no effective disease-modifying treatments for AD, 
highlighting the urgent need for more in-depth understanding of the 
disease-causing mechanisms. The brain serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmission system 
undergoes structural and functional changes in aging and AD, which contributes 
to cognitive decline and comorbid mood disturbances. This review discusses the 
critical involvement of the brain 5-HT system in aging and AD. Existing findings 
on the changes in projection fiber innervation and receptor/transporter 
expression in AD are reviewed. Preclinical and clinical progress on the 
development of 5-HT-modulating drugs for AD and the obstacles faced by these 
development efforts are discussed. Epigenetic control of the brain 5-HT system 
and the potential of modulating 5-HT transmission via DNA methylation are also 
examined.

Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative tauopathy 
associated with repetitive head impact (RHI) exposure. Genetic variation in the 
17q21.31 region, containing microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT), has been 
implicated in tauopathies but has not been investigated in CTE. The region 
includes a megabase-long inversion (H1/H2) and copy-number variations, including 
α, β, and γ segments, which can be characterized as nine segregating structural 
haplotypes. We leveraged array SNP data and a reference panel across the 
17q21.31 region to impute structural haplotypes and test their association with 
CTE endophenotypes in 447 European ancestry brain donors with RHI exposure. The 
H1β1γ1 haplotype was significantly associated with dementia and 
semi-quantitative tau burden in multiple cortical and medial temporal regions 
commonly affected in CTE. H1β1γ1 differential expression analyses in 
dorsolateral frontal cortex implicated cis-acting genes and inflammatory 
pathways. Taken together, the H1β1γ1 haplotype may help explain CTE 
heterogeneity among those with similar RHI exposure.

BACKGROUND: Blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction is an early event in 
neurodegenerative disorders. Pericytes are key cells for BBB maintenance. Upon 
pericyte injury, the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β (PDGFRβ) is 
released in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The relation of CSF PDGFRβ with 
markers of amyloid pathology, neuroinflammation, and axonal and synaptic damage 
across dementia remains unclear.
METHODS: Retrospectively, we quantified CSF PDGFRβ and CSF core Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), astrocytic (GFAP), microglial (sTREM 2, YKL-40), axonal (NfL), and 
synaptic (GAP-43, neurogranin) biomarkers in 210 patients from the Cognitive 
Neurology Centre, Paris, France, including n = 23 neurological controls (NC), n 
= 84 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [AD, n = 41; non-AD, n = 43], 
and n = 103 patients with dementia (AD, n = 73; non-AD, n = 30).
FINDINGS: Comparing clinical stages, CSF PDGFRβ levels were increased at the MCI 
stage (Cohen's d = 0.55 [CI95% 0.066, 1.0], P = 0.025) compared with NC. Non-AD 
MCI displayed higher levels than controls (Cohen's d = 0.74 [CI95% 0.22, 1.3], P 
= 0.042). No association was observed with CSF Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio but with p-tau 
181 (β = 0.102 [CI95% 0.027, 0.176], P = 0.0080) and t-tau levels (β = 0.133 
[0.054, 0.213], P = 0.0010). CSF PDGFRβ levels were positively associated with 
CSF neuroinflammation and synaptic markers levels. Higher CSF PDGFRβ levels were 
associated with lower MMSE scores at MCI (β = -1.23 [CI95% -2.33, -0.260], P = 
0.015) and dementia stages (β = -2.24 [CI95% -3.62, -0.85], P = 0.0020). CSF 
neuroinflammation biomarkers mediated the association of CSF PDGFRβ with 
neurodegeneration and synaptic integrity markers.
INTERPRETATION: CSF PDGFRβ, a candidate biomarker of BBB dysfunction, is 
increased in the early stages of neurodegenerative disorders, in association 
with neuroinflammation and axonal and synaptic damage.

A pathological hallmark of neurodegenerative disease is the accumulation of 
aberrant protein aggregates which contribute to the cytotoxicity and are 
therefore a target for therapy development. One key mechanism to manage cellular 
protein homeostasis is heat shock proteins (HSPs), protein chaperones which are 
known to target aberrant protein accumulation. Activation of HSPs target 
aberrant TDP-43, tau and amyloid to rescue neurodegenerative disease. As an 
attempt to target HSP activation for neurodegeneration therapy, we here develop 
a drug screening assay to identify compounds that will activate the master 
regulator of HSPs, the transcription factor heat shock factor 1 (HSF1). As HSF1 
is bound by HSP90 which prevents its activation, we developed a NanoBRET assay, 
which allows us to monitor and quantify the HSF1-HSP90 interaction in living 
cells to screen for compounds disrupting this interaction and thereby releasing 
HSF1 for activation. After the optimisation and validation of the assay, a two 
thousand compound library was screened which produced 10 hits including two 
known HSP90 inhibitors. Follow-up functional study showed that one of the hits 
oxyphenbutazone (OPB) significantly reduces the accumulation of insoluble TDP-43 
in a cell model, eliciting no signs of stress or toxicity. Overall, this study 
demonstrates a viable strategy for new drug discovery in targeting aberrant 
proteins and identifies potential candidates for translation into 
neurodegenerative disease treatment.

BACKGROUND: Wider screening and assessment for Alzheimer's disease and other 
related dementias (ADRD) may increase access to supportive care, improve 
allocation of medical care, and foster the use of interventions that prevent or 
delay disease progression. Yet, the effect of diagnostic timing on clinical and 
utilization outcomes is poorly understood. Community-based settings such as a 
hospital emergency department (ED) may be an underrecognized opportunity to 
assess cognition and impacts on individuals and health systems. This study 
assessed the feasibility of recruiting older adults for telephone-based trials 
following presentation to the ED and administering telephone based cognitive 
assessments over the phone in this population.
METHODS: Medicare-enrolled individuals 65+ years of age (n = 160) presenting to 
the Oregon Health & Science University Emergency Department (Portland, Oregon) 
between May 2022 and February 2023 were recruited by telephone. Participants 
were administered the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS) Assessment 
and the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) 
Cognitive Measure Questions on Mental Clarity via telephone 1-12 weeks 
post-discharge to evaluate cognition. Electronic medical records (EMR) were 
reviewed for medical care utilization including primary care provider (PCP) 
visits, hospital admissions, and ED visits for the 3 years prior to ED 
presentation.
RESULTS: Twenty-six percent of eligible ED users contacted elected for study 
enrollment. The TICS Assessment score had a significant relationship with the 
three evaluated health care utilization measures (ED, PCP visits, or 
hospitalizations); the PROMIS Assessment had significant but weak correlations 
to ED and PCP visits.
CONCLUSIONS: Older adults 65+ years presenting to the ED are amenable to enroll 
in telephone-based cognition-focused trials and cognitive assessments can be 
carried out over the telephone in this population. The PROMIS Assessment may be 
a better cognition assessment tool when evaluating for cognition and care 
utilization in this population. In addition to the limits of the screening tools 
used in this study, a lack of a representative sample is a limitation of the 
study design. Future studies could use other validated cognitive assessment 
tools and utilize a study design with a recruitment strategy focused on 
obtaining a representative sample of older ED patients.

This national expert-based Delphi-consensus aims at formulating recommendations 
on the management of dementia care in Italy. This effort seems important and 
timely given in light of a new scenario arising from a new biological definition 
of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the availability of disease-modifying treatments 
(DMTs).
METHODS: the Steering Committee of the Italian Neurological Society for dementia 
(SINdem) created appropriate statements. Invited SINdem experts were requested 
to vote on the statements according to a modified three-round Delphi method. 
Only those statements reaching Grade A (full agreement ≥ 75%) or B (overall 
agreement ≥ 80% and full disagreement < 5%) were included in the final document. 
Round answers' consistency was graded using the Cohen's k and within-class 
correlation coefficient.
RESULTS: Forty-six experts voted on 20 statements, which focused on the 
following aspects: i) organization of care services from early diagnosis to the 
management of advanced clinical stages; ii) access to biomarkers for a 
biological diagnosis of AD; iii) requirements necessary for the administration 
of DMTs; iv) main actors and pathways for the management of patients suffering 
from cognitive disorders. At the end of the process, 4 statements (20%) received 
a Grade A consensus, while 16 (80%) reached a Grade B consensus. Although the 
responses reflect heterogeneity among Italian regions, there was a fair degree 
of consistency for all statements.
CONCLUSION: The high strength of this expert-based Delphi-consensus may offer 
guidance for improving the patient's journey of individuals with cognitive 
decline from a biological diagnosis to DMTs administration and may possibly 
offer hints to the Health Systems on dementia.

INTRODUCTION: We utilized the Veterans Affairs Healthcare System administrative 
database to study the clinical decision-making processes for anti-amyloid 
therapy (AAT).
METHODS: Patients with clinical notes mentioning lecanemab were identified 
(March 2023-June 2024) for manual review and structured database queries.
RESULTS: From an initial sample (N = 2499), 1064 patients (55,000 notes) were 
reviewed manually (mean age 76 years; 7.3% women; 9.2% Black; 3.9% Hispanic). 
The AAT group (n = 56) had lower rates of common comorbidities, except 
post-traumatic stress disorder, than patients excluded from AAT (n = 528). The 
documented notes including "Lack of patient interest/resource constraints" 
(24.6% vs 3.6%), "anticoagulant use" (23.1% vs 10.7%), and "advanced AD" (18.6% 
vs 0), supplied partial explanations on exclusion vs inclusion.
DISCUSSION: Only 5.3% of patients reached the point of care of being a 
candidate, scheduled for, or receiving AAT infusion. Patient preference and 
clinician discretion, especially regarding modifiable factors (e.g., medication 
regimens), appreciably influence the patient journey to AAT.

Neuropharmacological effects of calycosin: a translational review of molecular 
mechanisms and therapeutic applications.

Calycosin, a naturally occurring isoflavonoid found predominantly in Astragalus 
membranaceus, exhibits significant therapeutic potential in various neurological 
conditions. Its multifaceted bioactive properties-antioxidant, 
anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic-position it as a promising candidate for 
neuroprotection and neuroregeneration. This review explores calycosin's 
mechanisms of action, including its modulation of key signaling pathways such as 
HMGB1/TLR4/NF-κB (high mobility group box 1/toll-like receptor 4/nuclear factor 
kappa B), phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3 K)/Akt, ERK1/2 (extracellular 
signal-regulated kinase 1/2), and Hsp90/Akt/p38. In cerebral 
ischemia/reperfusion injury, calycosin reduces oxidative stress markers like ROS 
(reactive oxygen species) and MDA (malondialdehyde), enhances antioxidant 
enzymes (SOD (superoxide dismutase) and GPX (glutathione peroxidase)), and 
downregulates pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β) through the 
HMGB1/TLR4/NF-κB pathway. It also inhibits autophagy via the STAT3/FOXO3a 
pathway and apoptosis by modulating Bax and Bcl-2 expression. In neuro-oncology, 
calycosin inhibits glioblastoma cell migration and invasion by modulating the 
TGF-β-mediated mesenchymal properties and suppressing the c-Met and CXCL10 
signaling pathways. Additionally, it enhances the efficacy of temozolomide in 
glioma treatment through apoptotic pathways involving caspase-3 and caspase-9. 
Calycosin shows promise in Alzheimer's disease by reducing β-amyloid production 
and tau hyperphosphorylation via the GSK-3β pathway and improving mitochondrial 
function through the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 
coactivator 1-Alpha (PGC-1α)/mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) 
signaling pathway. In Parkinson's disease, calycosin mitigates oxidative stress, 
prevents dopaminergic neuronal death, and reduces neuroinflammation by 
inhibiting the TLR/NF-κB and MAPK pathways. It has also shown therapeutic 
potential in meningitis and even neuroprotective effects against 
hyperbilirubinemia-induced nerve injury. Despite these promising findings, 
further research, including detailed mechanistic studies and clinical trials, is 
needed to fully understand calycosin's therapeutic mechanisms and validate its 
potential in human subjects. Developing advanced delivery systems and exploring 
synergistic therapeutic strategies could further enhance its clinical 
application and effectiveness.

Neuroinflammation plays a crucial role in the etiology of neurodegenerative 
diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 
epilepsy. Several key inflammatory pathways are pivotal in the development of 
neuroinflammation in PD, AD, and epilepsy. The NF-κB pathway is a central 
regulator of inflammation, and its chronic activation triggers the transcription 
of genes that drive inflammatory responses. JAK-STAT signaling system triggers 
the production of cytokines and chemokines that generate neuroinflammation; 
mitogen-activated protein kinases mediate the p38 pathway and control the 
synthesis of cytokines. Activation of the NO signaling pathway causes oxidative 
stress and neuronal damage. Plant-based therapeutics are gaining attention due 
to their anti-neuroinflammatory and neuroprotective phytochemicals, which shield 
the neurons from damage. Some of the examples are curcumin, resveratrol, 
ginsenosides, cannabidiol, notoginseng, quercetin, and so on. Clinical studies 
also indicate that certain plant-based formulations like Wei Li Bai, IPX066, 
Bushen huoxue, and so on can be effective alternatives to presently available 
remedies. The review is an attempt at assimilating the information from 
available literature on the role of different neurotransmitters involved in 
neuroinflammation and their connection in AD, PD, and epilepsy and applications 
of plant-based therapies in the prevention and cure of the above-mentioned 
diseases.

Neurodegeneration is featured by the gradual stagnation of neuronal function and 
structure, leading to significant motor and cognitive impairments. The primary 
histopathological features underlying these conditions include the cumulation of 
pathological protein aggregates, chronic inflammation, and neuronal cell death. 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are prominent examples of 
neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs). As of 2023, over 65 million people worldwide 
are affected by AD and PD, with the prevalence of these conditions steadily 
increasing over time. Interestingly, there are no effective therapies available 
to halt or slow NDD progression. Most approved treatments are focused on symptom 
management and are often associated with substantial side effects. Given these 
limitations, the development of novel therapeutic approaches targeting the 
molecular mechanisms underlying these disorders is essential. Notably, RNA-based 
therapeutics have recently emerged as a potential therapeutic approach for 
managing various neurological diseases, offering the potential for innovative 
molecular interventions in NDD. In this review, we have discussed the pathogenic 
role of various protein aggregates in NDD and highlighted emerging RNA-based 
strategies aimed at targeting these pathological proteins.

Amyloid and tau PET have contributed significantly to understanding the biology 
of Alzheimer disease (AD), aided development of biomarker-driven AD diagnostic 
criteria, and facilitated approval of the first disease-modifying drugs for AD. 
As opportunities to use amyloid and tau PET in the clinic have expanded, several 
factors will impact their application and real-world impact in patients with AD. 
First, quantification of amyloid and tau PET interpretations, supported by 
appropriate visual confirmation, will be needed for monitoring therapy response. 
Also, amyloid and tau PET will need to be balanced with emerging biofluid assays 
from CSF and blood. Blood-based biomarkers, although still requiring validation, 
have particular potential to complement PET utilization; nonetheless, the 
topographic information uniquely provided by tau PET will remain important in 
clinical practice. Additionally, the proper use of amyloid and tau PET for 
clinical management will require an understanding and consideration of mixed 
pathology, as is usually present in AD, along with continued advances in imaging 
technology to better address copathology. Further research and investment in 
this evolving field will improve diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic approaches, 
ultimately benefiting outcomes in patients with AD.

Intervention points for the role of physical activity in prevention and 
treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

University, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing global health challenge with limited 
pharmacological treatments. Epidemiological studies link regular physical 
activity with a lower risk of AD and cognitive decline in general, whereas 
randomized controlled trials show that aerobic exercise slows disease 
progression and improves cognitive function. However the underlying mechanisms 
remain incompletely understood. In this review we discuss five likely 
intervention points through which physical activity may influence AD progression 
and pathology: (1) reducing neuroinflammation and amyloid beta (Aβ) aggregation, 
(2) enhancing clearance of Aβ aggregates, (3) increasing neuronal resilience, 
(4) promoting hippocampal neurogenesis and (5) strengthening cognitive reserve. 
Understanding which of these mechanistic links are most likely to drive the 
AD-protective effects of exercise could help refine lifestyle-based 
interventions to complement pharmacological treatments and inform future 
prevention strategies.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as pivotal mediators in neurological 
diseases, showcasing multifaceted potential roles ranging from pathogenesis to 
diagnosis. These nano-sized membranous structures, released by various cell 
types including neurons, astrocytes, and microglia, encapsulate a diverse cargo 
of proteins, lipids, RNA species, and even DNA fragments. In neuropathology, EVs 
contribute significantly to intercellular communication within the central 
nervous system (CNS), influencing physiological or pathological cascades. 
Through the transfer of bioactive molecules, EVs modulate neuroinflammation, 
neuronal survival, synaptic plasticity, and the propagation of protein 
aggregates characteristic of neurodegenerative disorders. Moreover, their 
presence in biofluids such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), blood, and urine 
reflects the pathophysiological state of the CNS, offering a window into the 
diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of neurological diseases. Recent 
advancements in EV isolation techniques, coupled with high-throughput omics 
technologies, have facilitated the profiling of EV cargo, enabling the 
identification of disease-specific biomarkers with high sensitivity and 
specificity. This review explores the intricate roles of EVs in neuropathology, 
highlighting their involvement in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, 
multiple sclerosis, and other neurological disorders. Furthermore, it delves 
into the diagnostic potential of EVs, discussing current challenges and 
prospects in harnessing EV-derived biomarkers for precision medicine in 
neurology. Ultimately, understanding the biology of EVs in neurological contexts 
promises transformative insights into disease mechanisms and therapeutic 
strategies, paving the way for innovative diagnostic tools and targeted 
interventions in clinical practice.

Memantine HCl (MEM) and Donepezil HCl (DON) are widely used separately and in 
combination to treat Alzheimer's disease, and some studies suggest that these 
drugs may also prevent bone fractures and promote bone regeneration. For this 
purpose, we formulated fiber-based 3D scaffolds for local delivery of MEM/DON to 
improve the regeneration process of bone fractures. First, Poly (ε-caprolactone) 
(PCL)-based MEM/DON-loaded nanofibrous membranes were produced by 
electrospinning, and then these nanofibrous membranes were transformed into 3D 
scaffolds using the thermally induced self-agglomeration (TISA) method. 
Encapsulation efficiency after these two steps was found to be around 20%. 
Analyses confirmed that the 3D scaffolds have a morphology similar to the 
extracellular matrix, and that their hydrophilicity, swelling ratio, porosity, 
and degradation rate were adequate for bone tissue regeneration. Release studies 
show that the scaffolds provide an initial burst release of the drugs, followed 
by a sustained release for 21 days. These 3D scaffolds did not show any 
cytotoxic effect on the L-929 cell line, and increased cell viability over time 
indicates that they can be used in tissue engineering applications.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Biomarkers for predicting disease severity and 
outcome in Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) are scarce. We aimed to determine if 
brain-derived tau in serum (sBD-tau) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF BD-tau) are 
associated with long-term outcome and disease severity in GBS.
METHODS: In this retrospective study of 100 GBS patients, we measured sBD-tau 
and CSF BD-tau at diagnosis. Outcome was defined as GBS disability scale 
(GBSDS) > 2 and overall neuropathy limitation scale (ONLS) at 12 months, disease 
severity as respiratory support and ONLS at nadir. BD-tau levels were compared 
between groups and correlated with ONLS scores. Regression analyses and receiver 
operator characteristic curve analyses were performed for GBSDS > 2 at 
12 months.
RESULTS: BD-tau levels were higher for GBSDS > 2 at 12 months in serum and CSF. 
Odds ratio for sBD-tau was 1.9 (95% CI 1.08-3.2, p = 0.03) and for CSF BD-tau 
was 5.9 (95% CI 1.4-25, p = 0.02). Area under curve for sBD-tau was 0.75 (95% CI 
0.57-0.9, p < 0.001) and for CSF BD-tau was 0.78 (95% CI 0.65-0.9, p = 0.001). 
ONLS at 12 months correlated with sBD-tau (ρ = 0.34 [95% CI 0.12-0.53], 
p = 0.002) and CSF BD-tau (ρ = 0.33 [95% CI 0.08-0.54], p = 0.01). Statistically 
significant difference in BD-tau levels was not seen for respiratory support or 
ONLS at nadir.
CONCLUSION: BD-tau at GBS onset is associated with long-term outcome but not 
disease severity. Because BD-tau is essentially a CNS biomarker, our results 
suggest that CNS involvement influences recovery.

INTRODUCTION: The monoclonal antibodies Aducanumab, Lecanemab, Gantenerumab, and 
Donanemab were developed for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: We used single-molecule detection and super-resolution imaging to 
characterize the binding of these antibodies to diffusible amyloid beta (Aβ) 
aggregates generated in-vitro and harvested from human brains.
RESULTS: Lecanemab showed the best performance in terms of binding to the 
small-diffusible Aβ aggregates, affinity, aggregate coating, and the ability to 
bind to post-translationally modified species, providing an explanation for its 
therapeutic success. We observed a Braak stage-dependent increase in 
small-diffusible aggregate quantity and size, which was detectable with 
Aducanumab and Gantenerumab, but not Lecanemab, showing that the diffusible Aβ 
aggregates change with disease progression and the smaller aggregates to which 
Lecanemab preferably binds exist at higher quantities during earlier stages.
DISCUSSION: These findings provide an explanation for the success of Lecanemab 
in clinical trials and suggests that Lecanemab will be more effective when used 
in early-stage AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: Anti amyloid beta therapeutics are compared by their diffusible 
aggregate binding characteristics. In-vitro and brain-derived aggregates are 
tested using single-molecule detection. Lecanemab shows therapeutic success by 
binding to aggregates formed in early disease. Lecanemab binds to these 
aggregates with high affinity and coats them better.

Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disease that impairs cognitive 
function. The incidence of Alzheimer's disease increases with the increase in 
the elderly population. Although the clear pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease 
is not yet known, the formation of amyloid plaques and tau fibrils, diminished 
acetylcholine levels, and increased inflammation can be observed in patients. 
Alzheimer's disease, whose pathogenesis is not fully demonstrated, cannot be 
treated radically. Since it has been observed that only pharmacological 
treatment alone isn't sufficient, alternative approaches have become essential. 
Among these approaches, nanocarriers greatly facilitate the transport of drugs 
since the blood-brain barrier is an important obstacle to the penetration of 
drugs into the brain. Photosensitizers trigger activation after exposure to 
near-infrared radiation light of a suitable wavelength or laser light, resulting 
in the selective destruction of Aβ plaques. Photodynamic therapy and 
photothermal therapy have been investigated for their potential to inhibit Aβ 
plaques through photosensitizers. By encapsulating photosensitizers in 
nanocarriers, the limitations of photosensitizers can be overcome. By using 
these photosensitizers, near-infrared radiation fluorescence imaging can be used 
as a theranostic. In this review, potential treatment options for photodynamic 
therapy and photothermal therapy for Alzheimer's disease are summarised, and a 
simultaneous or combined approach is discussed, taking into account potential 
nanotheranostics.

Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative illness that significantly diminishes 
patients' quality of life. Chronic pain remains a major contributor to 
exacerbating patients' well-being. This comprehensive review aims to explore the 
mechanisms underlying pain perception in AD as well as identify potential 
targets and future considerations for pain relief. AD causes structural and 
functional alterations in the affected brain, including shrinkage of gray matter 
volume and disruptions in brain network connectivity. Besides memory loss, pain 
is a significant yet often neglected symptom. Effective pain management in AD is 
challenged by the adverse effects of pain-relief medications and communication 
difficulties, especially as the disease progresses. Both non- and 
pharmacological interventions are currently used to alleviate pain in AD. 
Pharmacological options include opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, 
paracetamol/acetaminophen, and adjuvant pain relievers like antidepressants and 
antiepileptic medications, though these are not officially approved for pain 
relief in AD. Non-pharmacological strategies, such as exercise therapy, music 
therapy, Reiki, reflexology, and behavioral therapy, are preferred to prevent 
the side effects of medication. However, the use of these methods is limited due 
to a lack of high-quality research. The review highlights a crucial link between 
neurological changes in AD and the perception of pain, underscoring the need for 
customized pain management approaches for this population. Emphasizing 
non-pharmacological interventions could potentially improve pain management in 
AD patients, provided that further research supports their effectiveness.

INTRODUCTION: List-learning tasks are important for characterizing memory in 
ADRD research, but the Uniform Data Set neuropsychological battery (UDS-NB) 
lacks a list-learning paradigm; thus, sites administer a range of tests. We 
developed a harmonized memory composite that incorporates UDS memory tests and 
multiple list-learning tasks.
METHODS: Item-banking confirmatory factor analysis was applied to develop a 
memory composite in a diagnostically heterogenous sample (n=5943) who completed 
the UDS-NB and one of five list-learning tasks. Construct validity was evaluated 
through associations with demographics, disease severity, cognitive tasks, brain 
volume, and plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau181 and p-tau217). Test-retest 
reliability was assessed. Analyses were replicated in a racially/ethnically 
diverse cohort (n=1058).
RESULTS: Fit indices, loadings, distributions, and test-retest reliability were 
adequate. Expected associations with demographics and clinical measures within 
development and validation cohorts supported validity.
DISCUSSION: This composite enables researchers to incorporate multiple 
list-learning tasks with other UDS measures to create a single metric.

Homeostatic Activation of 26S Proteasomes by Protein Kinase A Protects against 
Cardiac and Neurobehavior Malfunction in Alzheimer's Disease Mice.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients often show brain and cardiac malfunction. AD 
represents a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, but the demand 
for effective treatment for AD is far from being met. This is primarily because 
AD pathogenesis, including brain-heart interaction, is poorly understood. 
Proteasome functional insufficiency is implicated in AD; as such, proteasome 
enhancement promises a potentially new strategy to treat AD. The proteasome can 
be activated by protein kinase A (PKA) via selectively phosphorylating 
Ser14-RPN6/PSMD11 (p-S14-RPN6); however, whether p-S14-RPN6 is altered and what 
role p-S14-RPN6 plays in AD remain unclear. Hence, this study was conducted to 
address these critical gaps. We found that genetic blockade of the homeostatic 
p-S14-Rpn6 via germline knock-in of Rpn6 S14A (referred to as S14A) 
significantly reduced proteasome activities in the cerebral cortex but did not 
discernibly impair learning and memory function in 4-month-old mice or cause 
cardiac dysfunction before 12 months of age. Increases in Ser14-phosphorylated 
Rpn6 in the cerebral cortex and markedly elevated Aβ proteins in the myocardium 
were observed in young 5XFAD mice, a commonly used AD model. When introduced 
into the 5XFAD mice, S14A significantly aggravated the learning and memory 
deficits as revealed by the radial arm water maze tests and accelerated cardiac 
malfunction as measured by serial echocardiography in the same cohort of 5XFAD 
mice. Thus, the present study establishes for the first time that homeostatic

Characterization of the intraspecies chimeric mouse brain at embryonic day 12.5.

Strell P, Waldron MA, Johnson S, Shetty A, Crane AT, Steer CJ, Low WC.

Incidence of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, 
Huntington's, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis have increased dramatically as 
life expectancy at birth has risen year-over-year and the population ages. 
Neurological changes within the central nervous system, specifically the brain, 
include cell loss and deterioration that impact motor function, memory, 
executive function, and mood. Available treatments are limited and often only 
address symptomatic manifestations of the disease rather than disease 
progression. Cell transplantation therapy has shown promise for treating 
neurodegenerative diseases, but a source of autologous cells is required. 
Blastocyst complementation provides an innovative method for generating those 
autologous neural cells. By injecting mouse induced pluripotent stem cells 
(iPSCs) into a wild type (WT) mouse blastocyst, we generated a chimeric mouse 
brain derived of both donor and host neuronal and non-neuronal cells. An 
embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5), automated image analysis of mouse-mouse chimeric 
brains showed the presence of GFP-labeled donor-derived dopaminergic and 
serotonergic neuronal precursors. GFP-labeled donor-derived cholinergic 
precursor neurons and non-neuronal microglia-like and macrophage-like cells were 
also observed using more conventional imaging analysis software. This work 
demonstrates that the generation of mouse-mouse chimeric neural cells is 
possible; and that characterization of early neuronal and non-neuronal 
precursors provides a first step towards utilizing these cells for cell 
transplantation therapies for neurodegenerative diseases.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, accounting for 60-80% 
of all cases globally. Hallmark pathologies of AD include the accumulation of 
amyloid β peptide and phosphorylated tau, leading to neuronal circuit 
dysfunction, defective axonal transport, and neurotransmitter system (NTS) 
abnormalities. Disruptions in acetylcholine, GABA, dopamine, serotonin, and 
glutamate levels, as well as the loss of cholinergic, GABAergic, and 
monoaminergic neurons, contribute to the progression of AD. Additionally, 
neurotrophic factors like brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve 
growth factor (NGF) are significantly reduced in AD, impacting neuronal health 
and synaptic integrity. This review highlights the emerging role of neurotrophic 
factor alpha 1 (NF-α1), also known as carboxypeptidase E, in AD. NF-α1 shows 
neuroprotective and neurogenesis-promoting properties, offering potential for 
therapeutic interventions. The review compares NF-α1 gene therapy with other 
neurotrophin-based treatments, providing insights into its efficacy in AD 
management.

Cognitive symptoms and deficits are core features of late-life depression (LLD), 
with an estimated 20%-50% of affected individuals meeting diagnostic criteria 
for mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Cognitive deficits, especially executive 
dysfunction, have consistently been associated with poorer treatment outcomes 
among people with LLD. Furthermore, distinguishing depression with cognitive 
complaints or cognitive impairment from the early stages of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) can be challenging. Cognitive concerns are often emphasized among those 
with LLD, although, paradoxically, their description of memory difficulty may 
include detailed recall of specific memory lapses. Conversely, people with AD 
often have limited insight into their progressive cognitive decline, minimizing 
and concealing their cognitive difficulties. Neuropsychological assessment is 
one of the most useful means of clarifying this differential diagnosis. A 
subcortical cognitive pattern is commonly observed among people with LLD, 
including psychomotor slowing, variable attention, and executive dysfunction, 
which can affect memory encoding and free recall. A broad range of therapeutic 
approaches have been applied to older adults experiencing LLD along with 
cognitive symptoms, MCI, or dementia. Most studies focus on treatments to 
address LLD or MCI, with relatively fewer examining treatments specifically at 
this intersection. Nonpharmacological strategies, including aerobic exercise, 
cognitive remediation, and neuromodulation, are highly recommended to improve 
both depression and cognition. Antidepressants may have benefits for elements of 
cognition among people with LLD, but they have less evidence for their efficacy 
for people with cognitive deficits and dementia. This review provides an updated 
conceptual and practical framework for clinicians evaluating and treating LLD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder. The 
pathology of this disease is based on two basic mechanisms: amyloid-beta (Aβ) 
and tau fibrillation. Many genes and mechanisms have been identified as the 
primary causes of AD in clinical settings, and there have been exciting 
developments in drug treatments. Several molecules and biological structures 
regulate the genome outside of the standard DNA function. As in many diseases, 
circular RNAs (circRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), and exosomes (EXOs), investigated 
from different aspects of AD, are useful for treatment and diagnosis. This 
review examines two biological elements regarding their roles in the Aβ-tau 
pathology of AD and their potential as treatment targets. Importantly, the 
activities of miRNAs that play a role in these processes were evaluated. Trial

Data-Driven Modeling of Amyloid-beta Targeted Antibodies for Alzheimer's 
Disease.

Rabiei K, Petrella JR, Lenhart S, Liu C, Doraiswamy PM, Hao W.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is caused by the build-up of amyloid beta (A$\beta$) 
proteins in the brain, leading to memory loss and cognitive decline. Despite the 
approval of monoclonal antibodies targeting A$\beta$, optimizing treatment 
strategies while minimizing side effects remains a challenge. This study 
develops a mathematical framework to model A$\beta$ aggregation dynamics, 
capturing the transition from monomers to higher-order aggregates, including 
protofibrils, toxic oligomers, and fibrils, using mass-action kinetics and 
coarse-grained modeling. Parameter estimation, sensitivity analysis, and 
data-driven calibration ensure model robustness. An optimal control framework is 
introduced to identify the optimal dose of the drug as a control function that 
reduces toxic oligomers and fibrils while minimizing adverse effects, such as 
amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA). The results indicate that 
Donanemab achieves the most significant reduction in fibrils. These findings 
provide a quantitative basis for optimizing AD treatments, providing valuable 
insight into the balance between therapeutic efficacy and safety.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: This study explores the lived experiences of patients with 
chronic illnesses to understand how the meanings attributed to chronic illness, 
physical activity and well-being intertwine. This understanding is crucial for 
care practices aiming to support and enhance well-being.
METHODOLOGICAL DESIGN: We conducted a qualitative interview study grounded in 
hermeneutic-phenomenology to capture participants' lifeworld experiences in 
narrative form. COREQ is used as a reporting guideline.
ETHICAL ISSUES AND APPROVAL: Ethical considerations followed the ICN's ethical 
code of conduct, including addressing the sensitivity of researching vulnerable 
patients. All participants gave informed consent verbally and in writing. The 
study is registered with the Danish Data Protection Agency (REG-115-2021).
METHODS: We interviewed 22 individuals with multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's 
disease or ischemic heart disease in Denmark. Thematic analysis, inspired by Van 
Manen's phenomenology of practice, was employed and findings were discussed with 
the theory of well-being by Todres and Galvin.
RESULTS: Our analysis revealed a narrative of dual experiences: significant loss 
and transformative existential growth. The theme 'Losing oneself determined by 
bodily impact' captured the profound impact of participants' illnesses, 
including loss of embodiment, familiar life and a promised future. Conversely, 
the theme 'Physical activity as a pathway to existential growth' highlighted the 
empowering role of physical activity in finding relief, claiming control and 
fostering reconnections with oneself and others.
STUDY LIMITATIONS: Limitations of this study include the timing of interviews 
across different stages of illness and the context-dependent nature of 
qualitative findings, which may affect their transferability to other settings.
CONCLUSION: This investigation highlights the value of physical activity beyond 
traditional health outcomes for those with chronic illnesses. Physical activity 
emerges as a vital component for existential growth and improved well-being. The 
study advocates for incorporating meaningful physical activities into care 
strategies to enrich the quality of life for individuals with chronic and 
life-threatening diseases.

OBJECTIVE: The accumulation of amyloid plaques and disturbance of cholesterol 
homeostasis are implicated in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease. 
Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CYP46A1) are key 
proteins involved in the efflux and metabolism of excess cholesterol, and small 
non-coding RNAs (miRNAs), can help to regulate the expression of the genes 
encoding these proteins. The aim of the present study was to investigate the 
alterations in the expression of APOE and CYP46A1 genes, as well as their 
respective regulatory miRNAs, in astrocytes treated with amyloid beta (Aβ).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this experimental study, isolated astrocyte cells were 
cultured and treated with Aβ for 24 hours. Changes in the expression of APOE and 
CYP46A1 genes, as well as their regulating miRNAs, were assessed using the 
realtime polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique.
RESULTS: The expression of APOE and CYP46A1 genes increased with Aβ treatment. 
MiR-33a-5p, as the negative regulator of the APOE gene exhibited significant 
decrease. Additionally, miR-let-7a-5p, as the positive regulator of the APOE 
gene, showed an increase in the Aβ treated group. Moreover, miR-98-5p, as the 
negative regulator of the CYP46A1 gene, showed a half-fold decrease. While, 
miR-27a-3p as the positive regulator of the CYP46A1 gene, increased 
significantly with Aβ treatment.
CONCLUSION: Alterations in the expression of APOE and CYP46A1 genes, as well as 
the expression of miRNAs regulating these genes, in astrocytes treated with Aβ 
suggests that the cell is attempting to modify the regulatory pathways of 
cholesterol homeostasis in the brain under pathological conditions, such as 
Alzheimer's disease.

INTRODUCTION: Clinical features of cognitive performance in extreme old 
age differ from those of pathological cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease 
(AD).
METHODS: We compared cognitive traits between 638 centenarians aged 100-115 
years and 208 and 221 patients with AD from independent facilities.
RESULTS: The presence of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele did not affect 
Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores in centenarians. Centenarians 
retained the ability to follow three consecutive commands, associated with their 
educational background and activities of daily living. Cognitive retention 
remained unchanged in semi-supercentenarians (aged ≥ 105 years) and 
supercentenarians (aged ≥110 years). A quantitative genome-wide association 
study (GWAS) identified two loci associated with maintaining the ability to 
follow three consecutive commands.
DISCUSSION: This is the first study to compare cognitive traits between >600 
centenarians and patients with AD. Centenarians attained higher MMSE scores for 
the phenotype of following three consecutive commands than patients with AD, 
being useful in clinical practice.
HIGHLIGHTS: Cognitive phenotypes in centenarians differ from those in the AD 
groups Clinical trait to follow consecutive instructions is retained in 
centenarians but not in AD groups GWAS identified SNPs related to the maintained 
trait of MMSE in centenarians.

Nearly 7 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's disease or a related 
dementia (ADRD). Timely detection, quality of care, and access to services for 
people with ADRD remain poor. Broad acceptance and implementation of quality 
standards may help improve care processes, outcomes, and inequities in ADRD 
care. We review existing quality measures for ADRD and identify care domains 
that lack well-developed measures or for which uptake of existing measures is 
low. Increasing the use of existing evidence-based ADRD quality measures for 
health system performance improvement, pragmatic research, and Alternative 
Payment Models like the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Guiding an 
Improved Dementia Experience (GUIDE) Model, launched in 2023, may promote 
changes in care delivery and help address disparities in dementia care. 
Highlights US dementia care needs better measurement tools to assess quality and 
inequities. Increased use of current Alzheimer's disease and related dementias 
quality measures is urgently needed to improve care. Consensus on high-quality 
dementia care is vital for health system expectations. The Centers for Medicare 
& Medicaid Services Guiding an Improved Dementia Experience (GUIDE) Model tests 
a new payment strategy to enhance dementia care quality. Other payers can boost 
measurement to drive quality care like the GUIDE Model.

INTRODUCTION: Biomarkers play a crucial role in understanding Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) pathogenesis and treatment effects. However, comparing biomarker 
measures without standardization and appreciating their magnitude relative to 
the disease can be challenging.
METHODS: To address this issue, we propose the CentiMarker approach, similar to 
Centiloid, which provides a standardized scale between normal (0) and nearly 
maximum abnormal AD (100) ranges. We applied this scale to cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) biomarkers in dominantly inherited AD and sporadic AD cohorts.
RESULTS: CentiMarkers facilitated the interpretation of disease abnormality, 
demonstrating comparable changes and distributions of AD biomarkers across 
disease stages. CentiMarkers make the treatment effect more comparable than 
their original scales across various biomarkers.
DISCUSSION: The versatility of CentiMarkers makes it a valuable tool for 
standardized biomarker comparison in AD research, enabling informed cross-study 
comparisons and contributing to accelerated therapeutic development. Adoption of 
the CentiMarker scale could enhance biomarker reporting and advance our 
understanding of AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: Comparing fluid biomarkers without appreciating their magnitude 
relative to the disease can be challenging. We propose a CentiMarker metric to 
standardize biomarker measures from normal (0) and nearly maximum abnormal AD 
(100) ranges. CentiMarkers make the treatment effect more comparable across 
various biomarkers than when using the original scales.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a significant public health challenge due to 
its progressive cognitive impairment and the absence of proven treatments. In 
this study, several novel 1,2,3-triazole-methoxyphenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazole 
derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for their ability to inhibit key 
enzymes associated with AD: acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and 
butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). Structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis 
revealed that derivatives featuring electron-withdrawing groups, particularly 
nitro and fluorine substituents, exhibited remarkable inhibitory activity 
against BChE while showing minimal effectiveness against AChE. Among these, 
compound 13s (R = 4-CH3, R' = 4-NO2) demonstrated the highest potency, 
selectively targeting BChE with an IC50 value of 11.01 µM. Molecular docking and 
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provided deeper insights into the favorable 
interactions between these compounds and BChE. Additionally, cytotoxicity 
studies confirmed the active compound's limited toxicity toward normal cells, 
indicating a promising therapeutic profile. These findings suggest that the 
synthesized selective anti-BChE compounds hold potential for consideration in 
the later stages of AD treatment.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
predominantly affecting the elderly population. It is characterized by cognitive 
deficits associated with the accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques and 
neurofibrillary tangles. Huang-Lian-Jie-Du (HLJD) decoction, recognized as a 
representative formulation with heat-clearing and detoxification effects, has 
been demonstrated to be effective in treating AD. However, the underlying 
mechanisms require further investigation.
METHODS: 5xFAD mice were administrated low and high doses of HLJD. The Morris 
water maze test was conducted to assess the effects of HLJD. Aβ42 and total tau 
protein levels were evaluated. Additionally, network pharmacology analysis was 
performed to identify therapeutic targets of HLJD's active components and their 
relevance to AD. ELISA, qPCR, Western Blot, and immunofluorescence assays were 
employed to confirm the identified pathways. Finally, primary microglia isolated 
from 5xFAD mice were used to validate the candidate targets of HLJD.
RESULTS: HLJD improved cognitive deficits in 5xFAD mice and reduced amyloid 
plaque deposition and tau protein levels. Network pharmacology analysis 
indicated that HLJD influences the neuroinflammatory response, particularly 
through the Dap12 signaling pathway. This was confirmed by reduced levels of 
neuroinflammation markers, including TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and indicators of 
microglial activation and polarization. The expression of Trem2 and Dap12 in the 
hippocampus (HIP) of 5xFAD mice, as well as in the isolated primary microglia, 
were downregulated following HLJD treatment.
CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that HLJD alleviates cognitive deficits in AD by 
suppressing the Trem2/Dap12 signaling pathway in the HIP of 5xFAD mice, thereby 
inhibiting microglial neuroinflammation.

Growing interest in the role of the immune response in Alzheimer's Disease and 
related dementias (ADRD) has led to widespread use of fluid inflammatory markers 
in research studies. To standardize the use and interpretation of inflammatory 
markers in AD research, we build upon prior guidelines to develop consensus 
statements and recommendations to advance application and interpretation of 
these markers. In this roadmap paper, we propose a glossary of terms related to 
the immune response in the context of biomarker discovery/validation, discuss 
current conceptualizations of inflammatory markers in research, and recommend 
best practices to address key knowledge gaps. We also provide consensus 
principles to summarize primary conceptual, methodological, and interpretative 
issues facing the field: (1) a single inflammatory marker is likely insufficient 
to describe an entire biological cascade, and multiple markers with similar or 
distinct functions should be simultaneously measured in a panel; (2) association 
studies in humans are insufficient to infer causal relationships or mechanisms; 
(3) neuroinflammation displays time-dependent and disease context-dependent 
patterns; (4) neuroinflammatory mechanisms should not be inferred based solely 
on blood inflammatory marker changes; and (5) standardized reporting of CSF 
inflammatory marker assay validation and performance will improve incorporation 
of inflammatory markers into the biological AD criteria.

Heterogeneity in progression of clinical dementia obstructs the general 
therapeutic potential of current treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Though 
the mechanisms of this heterogeneity remain unclear, the characterization of 
bioactive tau species and factors that regulate their seeding behavior might 
give valuable insight as pathological tau is well correlated with cognitive 
impairment. Here, we conducted an innovative investigation into the molecular 
basis of widespread, connectivity-based tau propagation that begins in the 
inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) and spreads to neocortical areas such as the 
prefrontal cortex (PFC). Biochemical analysis of human postmortem ITG and PFC 
tissues revealed individual variability in tau seeding, which correlated with 
cognitive decline, particularly in the ITG, a region known for promoting 
accelerated tau propagation. Notably, this study presents the first evidence 
that site-specific phosphorylation and isoform composition of both 
aggregation-prone high-molecular-weight (HMW) tau and the relatively unexplored, 
yet potentially crucial in AD progression low-molecular-weight (LMW) tau 
significantly contribute to tau propagation and cognitive decline. Our findings 
underscore the importance of comprehensively considering diverse tau forms 
including both HMW and LMW tau species in understanding AD progression. 
Additionally, these results are the first to identify distinct morphological 
strains within the AD brain associated with differing seeding propensity, 
potentially enabling patient stratification based on their tau profile. 
Furthermore, RNA-seq analyses of gene expression patterns in the ITG revealed 
molecular heterogeneity associated with tau seeding potential. Patients with 
higher levels of seed-competent tau displayed greater impairments in synaptic 
and neural plasticity, and increased neuroinflammation. This multidisciplinary 
study offers novel insights into various molecular mechanisms driving AD 
progression, suggesting potential molecular targets for early intervention and 
improved patient subtyping, which is critical for developing precision medicine 
approaches.
