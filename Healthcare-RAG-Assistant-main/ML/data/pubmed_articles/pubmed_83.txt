Autoimmune blistering diseases (AIBDs), including pemphigoid and pemphigus, are 
intractable dermatological disorders clinically characterized by blistering and 
erosion affecting mucosal membranes and the skin. Due to their rarity and the 
limited coverage for less severe cases under Japanese medical subsidies, 
comprehensive epidemiological analyses encompassing less severe cases have not 
been conducted in Japan. In this study, we analyzed the epidemiology of AIBDs in 
Japan, utilizing data from a Japanese nationwide database. We identified 9796 
cases of bullous pemphigoid (BP), 62 cases of epidermolysis bullosa acquisita 
(EBA), 871 cases of pemphigus vulgaris (PV), and 578 cases of pemphigus 
foliaceous (PF). BP patients exhibited an older age distribution compared to 
EBA, PV, and PF, with median ages of 81, 72, 65, and 70 years, respectively. 
Higher rates of comorbidities such as Alzheimer's disease, spondylopathies, and 
extrapyramidal and movement disorders were observed only in BP cases, while 
other neurodegenerative disorders such as polyneuropathies, unspecified 
dementia, and schizophrenia were frequent in both BP and EBA. Dipeptidyl 
peptidase-4 inhibitors were more commonly prescribed before the onset of BP and 
EBA compared to PV and PF. Treatment patterns indicated that PV patients were 
more frequently administered higher doses of oral corticosteroids compared to 
other AIBDs. Additionally, aggressive therapies, including steroid pulse, 
intravenous immunoglobulin, and plasmapheresis therapies, were more frequently 
applied in PV cases. In-hospital mortality rates were higher in BP and EBA at 
8.0% and 11.3%, respectively, compared to PV and PF at 2.8% and 5.9%, 
respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that BP and EBA reached a 5-year 
in-hospital mortality rate of approximately 0.21 and 0.34, while PV and PF rates 
were approximately 0.07 and 0.11, respectively. The Cox hazard model revealed 
that higher age is the risk factor for in-hospital mortality in all diseases. 
Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated a cumulative steroid cessation probability of 
0.25 at 3 years for BP, and at 6 and 5 years for PV and PF, respectively. The 
Cox hazard model revealed that higher age and lower maximum corticosteroid dose 
contribute to the steroid cessation probability in BP, PV, and PF. This study 
provides insights into the epidemiology, treatment patterns, comorbidities, and 
outcomes of AIBDs in Japan.

BACKGROUND: Whilst there is a drive to increase diagnosis rates in dementia, 
there is a lack of attention on getting a correct and timely subtype diagnosis. 
For people with a rarer subtype of dementia, getting the correct diagnosis, and 
subsequent care, might be more difficult than for people aged 65+ presenting 
with the more common symptoms of Alzheimer's disease dementia. Thus, the aim of 
this mixed-method systematic review was to synthesise the evidence base on 
misdiagnosis of dementia.
METHODS: Misdiagnosis in dementia was defined as either receiving an initial 
incorrect dementia subtype diagnosis or receiving an incorrect non-dementia 
diagnosis. Post-mortem assessments of subtype diagnosis were excluded. Nine 
databases were searched in June 2023, with screening of titles and abstracts and 
consequent full texts completed independently by two researchers. Findings were 
synthesised using narrative synthesis.
RESULTS: Twenty studies were included. Studies were categorised into four 
themes: (i) Factors associated with delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis; (ii) 
Difficulties related to the diagnostic process; (iii) Economic consequences of 
misdiagnosis; and (iv) Experiences of delayed diagnosis or help-seeking. People 
with Lewy Body dementia or behavioural variant fronto-temporal dementia were 
found to experience longer diagnosis times and often incorrect initial 
diagnoses. Whilst evidence is limited regarding the economic impacts, evidence 
from the US points towards increased economic costs of misdiagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS: There is an urgent need to investigate the rates and emotional and 
economic impacts of misdiagnosis on people with dementia, their carers, and the 
health and social care system. Advancing the evidence base is crucial to reduce 
misdiagnosis and inform clinical practice.

Neurodegenerative diseases severely impact the life of millions of patients 
worldwide, and their occurrence is more and more increasing proportionally to 
longer life expectancy. Electroencephalography has become an important 
diagnostic tool for these diseases, due to its relatively simple procedure, but 
it requires analyzing a large number of data, often carrying a small fraction of 
informative content. For this reason, machine learning tools have gained a 
considerable relevance as an aid to classify potential signs of a specific 
disease, especially in its early stages, when treatments can be more effective. 
In this work, long short-term memory-based neural networks with different 
numbers of units were properly designed and trained after accurate data 
pre-processing, in order to perform a multi-class detection. To this end, a 
custom dataset of EEG recordings from subjects affected by five 
neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, 
dementia with Lewy bodies, progressive supranuclear palsy, and vascular 
dementia) was acquired. Experimental results show that an accuracy up to 98% was 
achieved with data belonging to different classes of disease, up to six 
including the control group, while not requiring particularly heavy 
computational resources.

Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease are among the most common 
neurodegenerative disorders. These diseases are correlated with advancing age 
and are hence increasingly becoming prevalent in developed countries due to an 
increasingly aging demographic. Several tools are used to predict and diagnose 
these diseases, including pathological and genetic tests, radiological scans, 
and clinical examinations. Artificial intelligence is evolving to artificial 
general intelligence, which mimics the human learning process. Large language 
models can use an enormous volume of online and offline resources to gain 
knowledge and use it to perform different types of tasks. This work presents an 
understanding of two major neurodegenerative disorders, artificial general 
intelligence, and the efficacy of using artificial general intelligence in 
detecting and predicting these neurodegenerative disorders. A detailed 
discussion on detecting these neurodegenerative diseases using artificial 
general intelligence by analyzing diagnostic data is presented. An Internet of 
Things-based ubiquitous monitoring and treatment framework is presented. An 
outline for future research opportunities based on the challenges in this area 
is also presented.

Nilotinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets the Abelson tyrosine kinase 
(c-Abl) signaling pathway, is FDA-approved to treat chronic myeloid leukemia. 
Nilotinib has properties indicative of a possible utility in neuroprotection 
that have prompted exploration of repurposing the drug for the treatment of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). AD is a progressive 
age-related neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the deposition of 
extracellular amyloid-β plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. It is 
incurable and affects approximately 50 million patients worldwide. Nilotinib 
reduces c-Abl phosphorylation, amyloid-β levels, and dopaminergic neuron 
degeneration in preclinical AD models. This study explores the effects of 
nilotinib on amyloid processing and mitochondrial functioning in the SH-SY5Y 
human neuroblastoma cell line. SH-SY5Y cells were exposed to nilotinib (1, 5, 
and 10 µM). Real-time PCR and immunoblot analysis were performed to quantify the 
expression of genes pertaining to amyloid-β processing and neuronal health. 
Nilotinib did not significantly change APP, BACE1, or ADAM10 mRNA levels. 
However, BACE1 protein was significantly increased at 1 µM, and ADAM10 was 
increased at 10 µM nilotinib without affecting APP protein expression. Further, 
nilotinib treatment did not affect the expression of genes associated with 
neuronal health and mitochondrial functioning. Taken together, our findings do 
not support the efficacy of nilotinib treatment for neuroprotection.

Microbes have inhabited the earth for hundreds of millions of years longer than 
humans. The microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA) represents a bidirectional 
communication pathway. These communications occur between the central nervous 
system (CNS), the enteric nervous system (ENS), and the emotional and cognitive 
centres of the brain. The field of research on the gut-brain axis has grown 
significantly during the past two decades. Signalling occurs between the gut 
microbiota and the brain through the neural, endocrine, immune, and humoral 
pathways. A substantial body of evidence indicates that the MGBA plays a pivotal 
role in various neurological diseases. These include Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Rett syndrome, attention deficit hyperactivity 
disorder (ADHD), non-Alzheimer's neurodegeneration and dementias, 
fronto-temporal lobe dementia (FTLD), Wilson-Konovalov disease (WD), multisystem 
atrophy (MSA), Huntington's chorea (HC), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple 
sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), temporal lobe epilepsy 
(TLE), depression, and schizophrenia (SCZ). Furthermore, the bidirectional 
correlation between therapeutics and the gut-brain axis will be discussed. 
Conversely, the mood of delivery, exercise, psychotropic agents, stress, and 
neurologic drugs can influence the MGBA. By understanding the MGBA, it may be 
possible to facilitate research into microbial-based interventions and 
therapeutic strategies for neurological diseases.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-associated neurodegenerative condition marked 
by amyloid plaques, synaptic dysfunction, and neuronal loss. Besides 
conventional medical care, herbal therapies, both raw and refined, have 
attracted researchers for their potential therapeutic effects. As a 
proof-of-concept, our study combined HPLC-DAD analysis of bioactive 
constituents, network pharmacology, molecular dynamics (MD), molecular docking, 
post-MD analysis, and experimental verification to investigate the mechanisms of 
crude drug formulations as a therapeutic strategy for AD. We identified nine 
bioactive compounds targeting 188 proteins and 1171 AD-associated genes. Using a 
Venn diagram, we found 47 overlapping targets, forming "herb-compound-target 
(HCT)" interaction networks and a protein‒protein interaction (PPI) network. 
Simulations analyzed binding interactions among the three core targets and their 
compounds. MD assessed the stability of the best-ranked poses and beneficial 
compounds for each protein. Among the top 22 hub genes, AChE, BChE, and MAO, 
ranked 10, 14, and 34, respectively, were selected for further analysis. Two 
tetraherbal formulations, Form A and Form B, showed notable activity against 
AChE. Form A exhibited significant (p < 0.0001) inhibitory activity (IC50 = 
114.842 ± 2.084 µg/mL) compared to Form B (IC50 = 142.829 ± 4.258 µg/mL), though 
weaker than galantamine (IC50 = 27.950 ± 0.122 µg/mL). Form B had significant 
inhibitory effects on BChE (IC50 = 655.860 ± 32.812 µg/mL) compared to Form A 
(IC50 = 679.718 ± 20.656 µg/mL), but lower than galantamine (IC50 = 23.126 ± 
0.683 µg/mL). Both forms protected against Fe2+-mediated brain injury by 
inhibiting MAO. Docking identified quercetin (-10.2 kcal/mol) and myricetin 
(-10.1 kcal/mol) for AChE; rutin (-10.6 kcal/mol) and quercetin (-9.7 kcal/mol) 
for BChE; and kaempferol (-9.1 kcal/mol) and quercetin (-8.9 kcal/mol) for MAO. 
These compounds were thermodynamically stable based on MD analysis. 
Collectively, the results offer a scientific rationale for the use of these 
specifically selected medicinal herbs as AD medications.

BACKGROUND: Neurocognitive disorders (NCDs) have a variable decline in cognitive 
function, while loneliness was associated with cognitive impairment and 
increased dementia risk. In the present study, we examined the associations of 
loneliness with functional and cognitive status in patients with minor (mild 
cognitive impairment) and major NCDs (dementia).
METHODS: We diagnosed mild NCD (n = 42) and major NCD (n = 164) through DSM-5 
criteria on 206 participants aged > 65 years using the UCLA 3-Item Loneliness 
Scale (UCLA-3) to evaluate loneliness, the activities of daily living (ADL) and 
the instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) scales to measure functional 
status, and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) to assess cognitive functions.
RESULTS: In a multivariate regression model, the effect of loneliness on 
cognitive functions was negative in major (β = -1.05, p < 0.0001) and minor NCD 
(β = -0.06, p < 0.01). In the fully adjusted multivariate regression model 
(sex-age-education-multimorbidity-depressive symptoms-antidementia drug 
treatment), the effect of loneliness remained negative for major NCD and became 
positive for minor NCD (β = 0.09, p < 0.001). The effect of loneliness on IADL 
(β = -0.26, p < 0.0001) and ADL (β = -0.24, p < 0.001) showed a negative effect 
for major NCD across the different models, while for minor NCD, the effect was 
positive (IADL: β = 0.26, p < 0.0001; ADL: β = 0.05, p = 0.01). Minor NCD 
displayed different levels of MMSE (β = 6.68, p < 0.001) but not ADL or IADL, 
compared to major NCD for the same levels of loneliness. MANOVA pill test 
suggested a statistically significant and different interactive effect of 
loneliness on functional and cognitive variables between minor and major NCDs.
CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed the relationships between loneliness and cognitive and 
functional status in major NCD, observing a novel trend in minor NCD.

Background and Objectives: Alzheimer's disease is a global health concern, with 
a rising prevalence among the elderly. Current pharmacological treatments, 
including acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) and N-Methyl D-Aspartate 
(NMDA) receptor antagonists, are associated with adverse events (AEs), 
particularly in the context of polypharmacy. This study aimed to investigate the 
relationship between Alzheimer's disease treatment combinations, the number of 
concomitant medications, and the occurrence of AEs. Materials and Methods: Data 
from the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report database, spanning from April 2004 
to June 2020, were analyzed. Patients aged 60 and older with Alzheimer's disease 
treated with AChEIs (donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine) or the NMDA 
receptor antagonist memantine were included. Logistic regression models were 
employed to assess the association between AEs and Alzheimer's disease drug 
combinations, as well as the number of concomitant medications. Results: Among 
2653 patients, 47.7% were prescribed five or more drugs. The frequency of AEs 
was 6.4% for bradycardia, 4.6% for pneumonia, 3.6% for altered state of 
consciousness, 3.5% for seizures, 3.5% for decreased appetite, 3.5% for 
vomiting, 3.4% for loss of consciousness, 3.4% for fracture, 3.2% for cardiac 
failure, and 3.0% for falls. The combination of memantine with AChEIs was 
associated with a higher risk of bradycardia, whereas donepezil alone was linked 
to a reduced risk of fractures and falls. Polypharmacy was significantly 
correlated with an increased incidence of AEs, particularly altered state of 
consciousness, decreased appetite, vomiting, and falls. The adjusted odds ratios 
for using five or more drugs compared to no drugs was 10.45 for altered state of 
consciousness, 7.92 for decreased appetite, 4.74 for vomiting, and 5.95 for 
falls. Conclusions: In the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, the occurrence of 
AEs is associated with the number of concurrent medications, independently of 
the known AEs of Alzheimer's disease drugs and their combination patterns.

This review explores the potential health benefits and applications of phenolic 
secoiridoids derived from olive oil by-products in the prevention of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). As reviewed herein, polyphenols, such as 
epigallocatechin-3-gallate, epicatechin, and resveratrol, show in vitro and in 
vivo antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties, and are 
particularly relevant in the context of AD, a leading cause of dementia 
globally. The olive oil industry, particularly in the Mediterranean region, 
produces significant amounts of waste, including leaves, pomace, and wastewater, 
which pose environmental challenges but also offer an untapped source of 
bioactive compounds. Despite promising in vitro and in vivo studies indicating 
that olive-derived polyphenols, such as oleuropein and hydroxytyrosol, may 
mitigate AD pathology, human clinical trials remain limited. The variability in 
extraction methods and the complex nature of AD further complicate research. 
Future studies should focus on standardizing the protocols and conducting robust 
clinical trials to fully assess the therapeutic potential of these compounds. 
This approach not only supports the development of new treatments for AD but 
also promotes environmental sustainability by valorizing olive oil industry 
waste.

Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by cholinergic 
dysfunction, making the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and 
butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) critical for improving cholinergic 
neurotransmission. However, the development of effective dual inhibitors remains 
challenging. Objective: This study aims to synthesize and evaluate novel 
pyridazine-containing compounds as potential dual inhibitors of AChE and BuChE 
for AD treatment. Methods: Ten novel pyridazine-containing compounds were 
synthesized and characterized using IR, 1H NMR, and 13C NMR. The inhibitory 
activities against AChE and BuChE were assessed in vitro, and pharmacokinetic 
properties were explored through in silico ADME studies. Molecular dynamics 
simulations were performed for the most active compound. Results: Compound 5 was 
the most potent inhibitor, with IC50 values of 0.26 µM for AChE and 0.19 µM for 
BuChE, outperforming rivastigmine and tacrine, and showing competitive results 
with donepezil. Docking studies revealed a binding affinity of -10.21 kcal/mol 
to AChE and -13.84 kcal/mol to BuChE, with stable interactions confirmed by 
molecular dynamics simulations. In silico ADME studies identified favorable 
pharmacokinetic properties for compounds 5, 8, and 9, with Compound 5 showing 
the best activity. Conclusions: Compound 5 demonstrates strong potential as a 
dual cholinesterase inhibitor for Alzheimer's disease, supported by both in 
vitro and in silico analyses. These findings provide a basis for further 
optimization and development of these novel inhibitors.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental 
condition marked by social interaction difficulties, repetitive behaviors, and 
immune dysregulation with elevated pro-inflammatory markers. Autophagic 
deficiency also contributes to social behavior deficits in ASD. Histamine H3 
receptor (H3R) antagonism is a potential treatment strategy for brain disorders 
with features overlapping ASD, such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease.
METHODS: This study investigated the effects of sub-chronic systemic treatment 
with the H3R antagonist E159 on social deficits, repetitive behaviors, 
neuroinflammation, and autophagic disruption in male BTBR mice.
RESULTS: E159 (2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg, i.p.) improved stereotypic repetitive 
behavior by reducing self-grooming time and enhancing spontaneous alternation in 
addition to attenuating social deficits. It also decreased pro-inflammatory 
cytokines in the cerebellum and hippocampus of treated BTBR mice. In BTBR mice, 
reduced expression of autophagy-related proteins LC3A/B and Beclin 1 was 
observed, which was elevated following treatment with E159, attenuating the 
disruption in autophagy. The co-administration with the H3R agonist MHA (10 
mg/kg, i.p.) reversed these effects, highlighting the role of histaminergic 
neurotransmission in observed behavioral improvements.
CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings suggest the therapeutic potential of H3R 
antagonists in targeting neuroinflammation and autophagic disruption to improve 
ASD-like behaviors.

BACKGROUND: According to scientific literature, some 99% of patients affected by 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) suffer from behavioral and psychological symptoms of 
dementia (BPSD), also known as neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs). In particular, 
agitation is one of the most difficult disorders to treat. States of agitation 
represent a very serious problem as they make these subjects dangerous for 
themselves and others and worsen as the disease advances. To date, there are no 
specific solutions for treating agitation. The only authorized drug is 
risperidone (as well as brexpiprazole, approved by the FDA on 11 May 2023), 
which can be used for no longer than 6-12 weeks because it increases the risk of 
death-owing to cardiocerebrovascular accidents-by 1.6-1.7 times.
METHODS: In order to address the latter noteworthy unmet medical need, NanoBEO 
was produced. The aim of the present work is to generate the health technology 
assessment (HTA) of this nanotechnological device. The latter consists of a 
controlled release system, based on solid lipid nanoparticles loaded with 
bergamot essential oil (BEO).
RESULTS: The results of the present research assessed the current evidence in 
the field of non-pharmacological treatments for this condition, including 
relevant primary preclinical and clinical data studies supporting the use of 
this device and the production of the operative plan for its launch on the 
market. The findings offer recommendations for decision-making on its 
implementation in dementia.
CONCLUSIONS: NanoBEO represents a public-worth innovation in this neglected 
area, marking a significant advancement in the history of dementia, moving from 
academic research to product development.

This systematic literature review aims to answer the question of how 
micronutrients might influence the development and progression of dementia. In 
the present work, we focused on an overview of an updated review of relevant 
literature published in the last two decades. This review aims to delineate the 
relationship between micronutrient supplementation and cognitive decline in 
older subjects. In carrying out this review, we followed PRISMA, and our 
literature search was performed on PubMed. This systematic review includes only 
primary studies that have investigated the efficacy of nutritional interventions 
for the prevention of dementia and improvement of cognitive function in subjects 
aged 65 years or older with normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 
or Alzheimer's disease (AD). A gross heterogeneity of studies forbids the 
possibility of a direct comparison of the results. A review of the inclusion 
criteria and restrictions has been conducted to check the validity and 
reliability of the results. In this review, thirty-three primary studies were 
included. Results have shown that supplementation with vitamin D, probiotics, 
and PUFAs would most likely reduce cognitive decline, dementia, or AD compared 
with vitamins A, B, C, and E, which were seen to be relatively ineffective. Of 
note, when considering vitamin B supplementation, positive effects were only 
observed in non-aspirin users having high ω-3 fatty acid (ω-3 FA) plasma levels. 
In some cases, however, there were genotypic differences in subjects in response 
to vitamin B supplementation.

Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common clinical neurodegenerative 
disorder, primarily characterized by progressive cognitive decline and 
behavioral abnormalities. The hallmark pathological changes of AD include 
widespread neuronal degeneration, plaques formed by the deposition of amyloid 
β-protein (Aβ), and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). With the acceleration of 
global aging, the incidence of AD is rising year by year, making it a major 
global public health concern. Due to the complex pathology of AD, finding 
effective interventions has become a key focus of research. Ouabain (OUA), a 
cardiac glycoside, is well-known for its efficacy in treating heart disease. 
Recent studies have also indicated its potential in AD therapy, although its 
exact mechanism of action remains unclear. Methods: This study integrates 
bioinformatics, multi-omics technologies, and in vivo and in vitro experiments 
to investigate the effects of OUA on the pathophysiological changes of AD and 
its underlying molecular mechanisms. Results: This study analyzed the expression 
of the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) across different 
stages of AD using bioinformatics. Serum samples from patients were used to 
validate soluble TREM2 (sTREM2) levels. Using an Aβ1-42-induced microglial cell 
model, we confirmed that OUA enhances the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway activation 
by upregulating TREM2, which reduces neuroinflammation and promotes the 
transition of microglia from an M1 proinflammatory state to an M2 
anti-inflammatory state. To evaluate the in vivo effects of OUA, we assessed the 
learning and memory capacity of FAD4T transgenic mice using the Morris water 
maze and contextual fear conditioning tests. We used real-time quantitative PCR, 
immunohistochemistry, and Western blotting to measure the expression of 
inflammation-associated cytokines and to assess microglia polarization. OUA 
enhances cognitive function in FAD4T mice and has been confirmed to modulate 
microglial M1/M2 phenotypes both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, through 
bioinformatics analysis, molecular docking, and experimental validation, TREM2 
was identified as a potential target for OUA. It regulates PI3K/Akt signaling 
pathway activation, playing a crucial role in OUA-mediated M2 microglial 
polarization and its anti-inflammatory effects in models involving 
Aβ1-42-stimulated BV-2 cells and FAD4T mice. Conclusions: These findings 
indicate that OUA exerts anti-neuroinflammatory effects by regulating microglial 
polarization, reducing the production of inflammatory mediators, and activating 
the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Given its natural origin and dual effects on 
microglial polarization and neuroinflammation, OUA emerges as a promising 
therapeutic candidate for neuroinflammatory diseases such as AD.

This literature review explores the association between hypertension and major 
neurocognitive disorders, including delirium, Alzheimer's disease, vascular 
dementia, Lewy body dementia, and frontotemporal dementia, which contribute 
significantly to global mortality and morbidity. Hypertension is a potentially 
modifiable risk factor for cognitive decline, as it contributes to the 
progression of neurodegenerative pathologies via vascular damage, inflammation, 
and the disruption of the blood-brain barrier. Despite this, the effectiveness 
of antihypertensive treatments in preventing or alleviating cognitive decline 
remains contentious. While some research highlights the potential benefits of 
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, 
other studies show inconsistent results, complicated by variations in 
hypertension definitions, diagnostic criteria for cognitive disorders, and 
confounding factors like medication adherence. Furthermore, the complex 
bidirectional relationship between hypertension and major neurocognitive 
disorders warrants more investigation, as cognitive decline can exacerbate 
cardiovascular risks through heightened inflammatory responses and compromised 
autonomic regulation. This review underscores the need for prospective, 
long-term studies to elucidate the relationships between hypertension and 
cognitive disorders and to evaluate the potential therapeutic benefits of 
antihypertensive treatments.

Preconditioning of Mesenchymal Stem Cells Enhances the Neuroprotective Effects 
of Their Conditioned Medium in an Alzheimer's Disease In Vitro Model.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) develops as a result of oxidative damage to 
neurons and chronic inflammation of microglia. These processes can be influenced 
by the use of a conditioned medium (CM) derived from mesenchymal stem cells 
(MSCs). The CM contains a wide range of factors that have neurotrophic, 
antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects. In addition, the therapeutic 
potential of the CM can be further enhanced by pretreating the MSCs to increase 
their paracrine activity. The current study aimed to investigate the 
neuroprotective effects of CM derived from MSCs, which were either activated by 
a TLR3 ligand or exposed to CoCl2, a hypoxia mimetic (pCM or hCM, respectively), 
in an in vitro model of AD.
METHODS: We have developed a novel in vitro model of AD that allows us to 
investigate the neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of MSCs on induced 
neurodegeneration in the PC12 cell line and the activation of microglia using 
THP-1 cells.
RESULTS: This study demonstrates for the first time that pCM and hCM exhibit 
more pronounced immunosuppressive effects on proinflammatory M1 macrophages 
compared to CM derived from untreated MSCs (cCM). This may help prevent the 
development of neuroinflammation by balancing the M1 and M2 microglial 
phenotypes via the decreased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, 
IL-6, and TNF-α) and increased secretion of IL-4, as well as the expression of 
IL-10 and TGF-β by macrophages. Moreover, a previously unknown increase in the 
neurotrophic properties of hCM was discovered, which led to an increase in the 
viability of neuron-like PC12 cells under H2O2-induced oxidative-stress 
conditions. These results are likely associated with an increase in the 
production of growth factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor 
(VEGF). In addition, the neuroprotective effects of CM from preconditioned MSCs 
are also mediated by the activation of the Nrf2/ARE pathway in PC12 cells.
CONCLUSIONS: TLR3 activation in MSCs leads to more potent immunosuppressive 
effects of the CM against pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages, while the use of hCM 
led to increased neurotrophic effects after H2O2-induced damage to neuronal 
cells. These results are of interest for the potential treatment of AD with CM 
from preactivated MSCs.

To people living with Alzheimer's Disease-Related Disorders (ADRD), timely and 
coordinated communication is essential between their informal caregivers and 
healthcare providers. In provider shortage areas, for example, the state of 
Nevada, telehealth can be an effective primary care delivery alternative to 
in-person visits. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of telehealth visits for 
people living with ADRD in the state of Nevada, a decision-analytic Markov model 
was developed from healthcare system perspectives with a 10-year horizon/1-year 
cycle. To estimate the effects of demographic and geographic parameters on the 
Markov model, race parameters were divided into non-Hispanic White individuals 
vs. others and location parameters were divided into urban vs. rural. A 12-item 
short-version Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI-12) was applied to measure the 
informal caregiver burdens of non-institutionalized people living with ADRD. The 
values of mortality rate and healthcare utilization were obtained from 
healthcare systems' publicly available payor administrative data and Nevada 
State Inpatient/Emergency Department datasets. Among urban-residing non-Hispanic 
White individuals, the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) per modified 
ZBI-12 indicated a cost saving of USD 9.44 with telehealth visits; among 
urban-residing racial minorities, the ICER per modified ZBI-12 indicated a cost 
saving of USD 29.26 with in-person visits; and among rural residents, the ICER 
per modified ZBI-12 indicated a cost-saving of USD 320.93 with telehealth 
visits. Distributional differences in the cost-saving effects of telehealth 
primary care were noted in line with racial and geographic parameters. Workforce 
and caregiver training is necessary for reducing distributional differences, 
especially among urban-residing racial monitories living with ADRD in the 
provider shortage area of the state of Nevada.

Natural Products and Their Neuroprotective Effects in Degenerative Brain 
Diseases: A Comprehensive Review.

As the global population ages, the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases such 
as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's is rapidly rising. These diseases present a 
significant public health challenge, as they severely impair cognitive and motor 
functions, ultimately leading to a substantial reduction in quality of life and 
placing a heavy burden on healthcare systems worldwide. Although several 
therapeutic agents have been developed to manage the symptoms of these diseases, 
their effectiveness is often limited, and there remains an urgent need for 
preventive strategies. Growing evidence indicates that bioactive compounds from 
natural products possess neuroprotective properties through antioxidant and 
anti-inflammatory effects, modulating key pathways such as phosphatidylinositol 
3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) and brain-derived neurotrophic 
factor-tropomyosin receptor kinase B-cAMP response element-binding protein 
(BDNF-TrkB-CREB), which are crucial for neuronal survival. These compounds may 
also reduce amyloid-beta and tau pathology, as well as enhance cholinergic 
neurotransmission by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase activity. By targeting 
oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration, natural products 
offer a promising approach for both prevention and treatment. These findings 
suggest that natural products may be promising for preventing and treating 
neurodegenerative diseases. This review aims to explore the pathogenesis of 
neurodegenerative diseases, the limitations of current therapies, and the 
potential role of natural products as therapeutic agents.

HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are 
two neurocognitive disorders with overlapping clinical presentations and 
pathophysiology. The two have been thought to be two separate entities. However, 
the introduction and widespread use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has altered 
the clinical manifestations of HAND, shifting from a pattern of subcortical 
dementia to one more akin to cortical dementia, resembling AD. Thus, the line 
between the two disease entities is not clear-cut. In this review, we discuss 
the concept of Alzheimer's disease-like dementia (ADLD) in HIV, which describes 
this phenomenon. While the mechanisms of HIV-associated ADLD remain to be 
elucidated, potential mechanisms include HIV-specific pathways, including 
epigenetic imprinting from initial viral infection, persistent and low viral 
load (which can only be detected by ultra-sensitive PCR), HIV-related 
inflammation, and putative pathways underlying traditional AD risk factors. 
Importantly, we have shown that HIV-specific microRNAs (miRs) encapsulated in 
extracellular vesicles (EV-miRs) play an important role in mediating the 
detrimental effects in the cardiovascular system. A useful preclinical model to 
study ADLD would be to expose AD mice to HIV-positive EVs to identify candidate 
EV-miRs that mediate the HIV-specific effects underlying ADLD. Characterization 
of the candidate EV-miRs may provide novel therapeutic armamentaria for ADLD.

The European olive tree, Olea europaea L., and its polyphenols hold great 
therapeutic potential to treat neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment. This 
review examines the evidence for the anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective 
actions of olive polyphenols and their potential in the treatment of long COVID 
and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's 
disease (PD), and multiple sclerosis (MS). Key findings suggest that olive 
polyphenols exhibit antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, and 
antiviral properties, making them promising candidates for therapeutic 
intervention, especially when formulated in unique combinations. Recommendations 
for future research directions include elucidating molecular pathways through 
mechanistic studies, exploring the therapeutic implications of olive polyphenol 
supplementation, and conducting clinical trials to assess efficacy and safety. 
Investigating potential synergistic effects with other agents addressing 
different targets is suggested for further exploration. The evidence reviewed 
strengthens the translational value of olive polyphenols in conditions involving 
cognitive dysfunction and emphasizes the novelty of new formulations.

The prevalence of psychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases is 
steadily increasing, placing a significant burden on both society and 
individuals. Given the intricate and multifaceted nature of these diseases, the 
precise underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Consequently, there is an 
increasing imperative to investigate the mechanisms, identify specific target 
sites for effective treatment, and provide for accurate diagnosis of patients 
with these diseases. Numerous studies have revealed significant alterations in 
the expression of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in psychiatric disorders and 
neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting their potential to increase the 
probability of these diseases. Moreover, these findings propose that lncRNAs 
could be used as highly valuable biomarkers in diagnosing and treating these 
diseases, thereby offering novel insights for future clinical interventions. The 
review presents a comprehensive summary of the origin, biological functions, and 
action mechanisms of lncRNAs, while exploring their implications in the 
pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases and their 
potential utility as biomarkers.

Lactobacillus Eats Amyloid Plaque and Post-Biotically Attenuates Senescence Due 
to Repeat Expansion Disorder and Alzheimer's Disease.

Patients with Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD) are faced with a 
formidable challenge of focal amyloid deposits and cerebral amyloid angiopathy 
(CAA). The treatment of amyloid deposits in ADRD by targeting only oxidative 
stress, inflammation and hyperlipidemia has not yielded significant positive 
clinical outcomes. The chronic high-fat diet (HFD), or gut dysbiosis, is one of 
the major contributors of ADRD in part by disrupted transport, epigenetic DNMT1 
and the folate 1-carbon metabolism (FOCM) cycle, i.e., rhythmic 
methylation/de-methylation on DNA, an active part of epigenetic memory during 
genes turning off and on by the gene writer (DNMT1) and eraser (TET2/FTO) and 
the transsulfuration pathway by mitochondrial 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfur 
transferase (3MST)-producing H2S. The repeat CAG expansion and m6A disorder 
causes senescence and AD. We aim to target the paradigm-shift pathway of the 
gut-brain microbiome axis that selectively inhibits amyloid deposits and 
increases mitochondrial transsulfuration and H2S. We have observed an increase 
in DNMT1 and decreased FTO levels in the cortex of the brain of AD mice. 
Interestingly, we also observed that probiotic lactobacillus-producing 
post-biotic folate and lactone/ketone effectively prevented FOCM-associated gut 
dysbiosis and amyloid deposits. The s-adenosine-methionine (SAM) transporter 
(SLC25A) was increased by hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy). Thus, we hypothesize that 
chronic gut dysbiosis induces SLC25A, the gene writer, and HHcy, and decreases 
the gene eraser, leading to a decrease in SLC7A and mitochondrial 
transsulfuration H2S production and bioenergetics. Lactobacillus engulfs 
lipids/cholesterol and a tri-directional post-biotic, folic acid (an antioxidant 
and inhibitor of beta amyloid deposits; reduces Hcy levels), and the lactate 
ketone body (fuel for mitochondria) producer increases SLC7A and H2S (an 
antioxidant, potent vasodilator and neurotransmitter gas) production and 
inhibits amyloid deposits. Therefore, it is important to discuss whether 
lactobacillus downregulates SLC25A and DNMT1 and upregulates TET2/FTO, 
inhibiting β-amyloid deposits by lowering homocysteine. It is also important to 
discuss whether lactobacillus upregulates SLC7A and inhibits β-amyloid deposits 
by increasing the mitochondrial transsulfuration of H2S production.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease, and it is 
currently the seventh leading cause of death worldwide. It is characterized by 
the extracellular aggregation of the amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) into oligomers and 
fibrils that cause synaptotoxicity and neuronal death. Aβ exhibits a dual role 
in promoting oxidative stress and inflammation. This review aims to unravel the 
intricate connection between these processes and their contribution to AD 
progression. The review delves into oxidative stress in AD, focusing on the 
involvement of metals, mitochondrial dysfunction, and biomolecule oxidation. The 
distinct yet overlapping concept of nitro-oxidative stress is also discussed, 
detailing the roles of nitric oxide, mitochondrial perturbations, and their 
cumulative impact on Aβ production and neurotoxicity. Inflammation is examined 
through astroglia and microglia function, elucidating their response to Aβ and 
their contribution to oxidative stress within the AD brain. The blood-brain 
barrier and oligodendrocytes are also considered in the context of AD 
pathophysiology. We also review current diagnostic methodologies and emerging 
therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating oxidative stress and inflammation, 
thereby offering potential treatments for halting or slowing AD progression. 
This comprehensive synthesis underscores the pivotal role of Aβ in bridging 
oxidative stress and inflammation, advancing our understanding of AD and 
informing future research and treatment paradigms.

Withania somnifera (WS), also known as ashwagandha, is a popular botanical 
supplement used to treat various conditions including memory loss, anxiety and 
depression. Previous studies from our group showed an aqueous extract of WS root 
(WSAq) enhances cognition and alleviates markers for depression in Drosophila. 
Here, we sought to confirm these effects in the 5xFAD mouse model of β-amyloid 
(Aβ) accumulation. Six- to seven-month-old male and female 5xFAD mice were 
treated with WSAq in their drinking water at 0 mg/mL, 0.5 mg/mL or 2.5 mg/mL for 
four weeks. In the fourth week of treatment, spatial memory, anxiety and 
depressive-like symptoms were evaluated. At the conclusion of behavioral 
testing, brain tissue was harvested, immunohistochemistry was performed, and the 
cortical expression of antioxidant response genes was evaluated. Both 
concentrations of WSAq improved spatial memory and reduced depressive and 
anxiety-related behavior. These improvements were accompanied by a reduction in 
Aβ plaque burden in the hippocampus and cortex and an attenuation of activation 
of microglia and astrocytes. Antioxidant response genes were upregulated in the 
cortex of WSAq-treated mice. Oral WSAq treatment could be beneficial as a 
therapeutic option in AD for improving disease pathology and behavioral 
symptoms. Future studies focused on dose optimization of WSAq administration and 
further assessment of the mechanisms by which WSAq elicits its beneficial 
effects will help inform the clinical potential of this promising botanical 
therapy.

Currently, the age structure of the world population is changing due to 
declining birth rates and increasing life expectancy. As a result, physicians 
worldwide have to treat an increasing number of age-related diseases, of which 
neurological disorders represent a significant part. In this context, there is 
an urgent need to discover new therapeutic approaches to counteract the effects 
of neurodegeneration on human health, and computational science can be of 
pivotal importance for more effective neurodrug discovery. The knowledge of the 
molecular structure of the receptors and other biomolecules involved in 
neurological pathogenesis facilitates the design of new molecules as potential 
drugs to be used in the fight against diseases of high social relevance such as 
dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), to cite only a 
few. However, the absence of comprehensive guidelines regarding the strengths 
and weaknesses of alternative approaches creates a fragmented and disconnected 
field, resulting in missed opportunities to enhance performance and achieve 
successful applications. This review aims to summarize some of the most 
innovative strategies based on computational methods used for neurodrug 
development. In particular, recent applications and the state-of-the-art of 
molecular docking and artificial intelligence for ligand- and target-based 
approaches in novel drug design were reviewed, highlighting the crucial role of 
in silico methods in the context of neurodrug discovery for neurodegenerative 
diseases.

Aging is the major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the aged brain, 
myelin debris accumulates and is cleared by microglia. Phagocytosed myelin 
debris increases neutral lipid droplet content in microglia. Neutral lipids 
include cholesteryl esters (CE) and triacylglycerol (TAG). To examine the 
effects of myelin debris on neutral lipid content in microglia, we added myelin 
debris to human HMC3 and mouse N9 cells. The results obtained when using 
3H-oleate as a precursor in intact cells reveal that myelin debris significantly 
increases the biosynthesis of CE but not TAG. Mass analyses have shown that 
myelin debris increases both CE and TAG. The increase in CE biosynthesis was 
abolished using inhibitors of the cholesterol storage enzyme 
acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase 1 (ACAT1/SOAT1). ACAT1 inhibitors are 
promising drug candidates for AD treatment. In myelin debris-loaded microglia, 
treatment with two different ACAT1 inhibitors, K604 and F12511, increased the 
mRNA and protein content of ATP-binding cassette subfamily A1 (ABCA1), a protein 
that is located at the plasma membrane and which controls cellular cholesterol 
disposal. The effect of the ACAT1 inhibitor on ABCA1 was abolished by 
preincubating cells with the liver X receptor (LXR) antagonist GSK2033. We 
conclude that ACAT1 inhibitors prevent the accumulation of cholesterol and CE in 
myelin debris-treated microglia by activating ABCA1 gene expression via the LXR 
pathway.

Cannabis sativa is known for producing over 120 distinct phytocannabinoids, with 
Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) being the most prominent, 
primarily in their acidic forms. Beyond Δ9-THC and CBD, a wide array of 
lesser-known phytocannabinoids, along with terpenes, flavonoids, and alkaloids, 
demonstrate diverse pharmacological activities, interacting with the 
endocannabinoid system (eCB) and other biological pathways. These compounds, 
characterized by phenolic structures and hydroxyl groups, possess lipophilic 
properties, allowing them to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) effectively. 
Notably, their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuro-modulatory effects 
position them as promising agents in treating neurodegenerative disorders. While 
research has extensively examined the neuropsychiatric and neuroprotective 
effects of Δ9-THC, other minor phytocannabinoids remain underexplored. Due to 
the well-established neuroprotective potential of CBD, there is growing interest 
in the therapeutic benefits of non-psychotropic minor phytocannabinoids (NMPs) 
in brain disorders. This review highlights the emerging research on these 
lesser-known compounds and their neuroprotective potential. It offers insights 
into their therapeutic applications across various major neurological 
conditions.

Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a common complication that affects 
memory, executive function, and processing speed postoperatively. The 
pathogenesis of POCD is linked to excessive neuroinflammation and pre-existing 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Previous studies have shown that acupuncture 
improves cognition in the early phase of POCD. However, POCD can last for longer 
periods (up to weeks and years). The long-term effects of acupuncture are 
unknown. In this study, we hypothesized that electroacupuncture (EA) could 
reduce inflammation and cognitive dysfunction induced by laparotomy over a 
longer period. We characterized the effects of postoperative EA on cognitive 
changes and investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms in mice. Laparotomy 
was performed in 3-month-old mice followed by daily EA treatment for 2 weeks. 
Our data indicated that laparotomy induced prolonged impairment in memory and 
executive functions, which were mitigated by postoperative EA. EA also reduced 
tau phosphorylation and suppressed the activation of tau-related kinases and 
glia, with effects comparable to ibuprofen. These findings demonstrate the 
beneficial effects of EA in a mouse model of POCD, suggesting that EA's ability 
to suppress neuroinflammation may contribute to its protective effects. In 
conclusion, EA may be a viable non-pharmacological intervention for managing 
POCD in different phases of the medical condition.

Platelets are essential blood components that maintain hemostasis, prevent 
excessive bleeding, and facilitate wound healing. Reduced platelet counts are 
implicated in various diseases, including leukemia, hepatitis, cancer, and 
Alzheimer's disease. Enhancing megakaryocytic differentiation is a promising 
strategy to increase platelet production. Compound K (CK), a major bioactive 
metabolite of ginsenosides from Panax ginseng, has demonstrated anti-cancer and 
neuroprotective properties. In this study, we investigated the effects of CK on 
megakaryocytic differentiation and apoptosis in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) 
cell lines K562 and Meg-01. CK treatment significantly upregulated the mRNA 
expression of key megakaryocytic differentiation markers, including CD61, CD41, 
and CD42a, and promoted the formation of large, multinucleated cells in K562 
cells. Additionally, flow cytometry analysis revealed that CK at 5 µM induced 
apoptosis, a critical process in thrombocytopoiesis, in both K562 and Meg-01 
cells. RT2 Profiler PCR array analysis further identified a marked increase in 
the expression of genes associated with the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome 
in CK-treated K562 and Meg-01 cells. This study is the first to demonstrate that 
CK promotes megakaryocytic differentiation and apoptosis through the activation 
of the ERK/EGR1 and NLRP3 inflammasome pathways. These findings suggest that CK 
may enhance platelet production, indicating its potential as a therapeutic 
candidate for platelet-related disorders and other associated diseases.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disease in which 
treatment often includes an exercise regimen. Exercise is neuroprotective in 
animal models of PD, and, more recently, human clinical studies have verified 
exercise's disease-modifying effect. Aerobic exercise and resistance training 
improve many of PD's motor and non-motor symptoms, while neuromotor therapy and 
stretching/flexibility exercises positively contribute to the quality of life in 
people with PD. Therefore, understanding the role of exercise in managing this 
complex disorder is crucial. Exerkines are bioactive substances that are 
synthesized and released during exercise and have been implicated in several 
positive health outcomes, including neuroprotection. Exerkines protect neuronal 
cells in vitro and rodent PD models in vivo. Aerobic exercise and resistance 
training both increase exerkine levels in the blood, suggesting a role for 
exerkines in the neuroprotective theory. Many exerkines demonstrate the 
potential for protecting the brain against pathological missteps caused by PD. 
Every person (people) with Parkinson's (PwP) needs a comprehensive exercise plan 
tailored to their unique needs and abilities. Here, we provide an exercise 
template to help PwP understand the importance of exercise for treating PD, 
describe barriers confronting many PwP in their attempt to exercise, provide 
suggestions for overcoming these barriers, and explore the role of exerkines in 
managing PD. In conclusion, exercise and exerkines together create a powerful 
neuroprotective system that should contribute to slowing the chronic progression 
of PD.

There is a high demand for the development of drugs against Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), which is related to the misfolding and aggregation of Amyloid-β (Aβ), due 
to the increasing number of patients with AD. In our present study, we aimed to 
assess the aggregation inhibitory effect of various synthetic YS-peptides on 
Aβ25-35 to identify an applicable peptide for clinical use for AD treatment and 
prevention. Suppression and aggregate resolution activities of YS-peptides 
against Aβ25-35 were evaluated using a Thioflavin T assay and scanning electron 
microscopy (SEM). Structure-activity relationship studies revealed that YS-RD11 
(RETLVYLTHLD) and YS-RE16 (RETLVYLTHLDYDDTE) showed suppression and 
aggregate-resolution activities. The effect of YS-peptides on phagocytosis in 
microglial cells (BV-2 cells) demonstrated that YS-RD11 and YS-RE16 activated 
the phagocytic ability of microglia. In the Aβ25-35-induced AD mouse model, 
YS-RD11 prevented and improved the deficits in short-term memory. In conclusion, 
YS-RD11 is a suitable candidate therapeutic drug against AD and uses a strategy 
similar to that used for antibodies.

diseases, its role in Parkinson plus syndromes (PPS) has only been partially 
investigated. It appears that elevated Hcy, along with an imbalance of its 
essential vitamin cofactors, are both implicated in the development and 
progression of parkinsonian syndromes, which represent different disease 
pathologies, namely alpha-synucleinopathies and tauopathies. Attributing a 
potential pathogenetic role in hyperhomocysteinemia would be crucial in terms of 
improving the diagnostic and prognostic accuracy of these syndromes and also for 
providing a new target for possible therapeutic intervention. The scope of this 
review is to focus on vitamin imbalance in PPS, with a special emphasis on the 
role of Hcy, B12 and folic acid in the neurodegenerative process and their 
implication in the therapeutic approach of these disorders.

Nanobodies (Nbs) are antibody fragments derived from heavy-chain-only IgG 
antibodies found in the Camelidae family as well as cartilaginous fish. Their 
unique structural and functional properties, such as their small size, the 
ability to be engineered for high antigen-binding affinity, stability under 
extreme conditions, and ease of production, have made them promising tools for 
diagnostics and therapeutics. This potential was realized in 2018 with the 
approval of caplacizumab, the world's first Nb-based drug. Currently, Nbs are 
being investigated in clinical trials for a broad range of treatments, including 
targeted therapies against PDL1 and Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), 
cardiovascular diseases, inflammatory conditions, and neurodegenerative 
disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis. They are also being studied for their potential for detecting 
and imaging autoimmune conditions and infectious diseases such as severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). A variety of methods are now 
available to generate target-specific Nbs quickly and efficiently at low costs, 
increasing their accessibility. This article examines these diverse applications 
of Nbs and their promising roles. Only the most recent articles published in the 
last five years have been used to summarize the most advanced developments in 
the field.

Several major challenges, including an ageing population and declining workforce 
and the implementation of recent breakthrough therapies for Alzheimer disease, 
are prompting a necessary rethink of how people with neurodegenerative dementias 
are diagnosed and medically managed. Digital health technologies could play a 
pivotal part in this transformation, with new advances enabling the collection 
of millions of data points from a single individual. Possible applications 
include unobtrusive monitoring that aids early detection of disease and 
artificial intelligence-based health advice. To translate these advances to 
meaningful benefits for people living with a disease, technologies must be 
implemented within a system that retains the physician expert as a central 
figure in decision-making. This Perspective presents a new framework, termed the 
Digitized Memory Clinic, for the diagnostic pathway of neurodegenerative 
dementias that incorporates digital health technologies with currently available 
assessment tools, such as fluid and imaging biomarkers, in an interplay with the 
physician. The Digitized Memory Clinic will manage people across the entire 
disease spectrum, from the detection of risk factors for cognitive decline and 
the earliest symptoms to dementia, and will replace the present paradigm of a 
pure 'brick-and-mortar' memory clinic. Important ethical, legal and societal 
barriers associated with the implementation of digital health technologies in 
memory clinics need to be addressed. The envisioned Digitized Memory Clinic aims 
to improve diagnostics and enable precise disease-tracking prognostication for 
individuals with memory disorders and to open new possibilities, such as 
precision medicine for prevention and treatment.

BACKGROUND: There is a growing body of evidence indicating the significant role 
of the immune system and immune cells in the progression of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). However, the exact role of genes from various immune cell types in AD 
remains unclear. We aimed to utilize summary data-based Mendelian randomization 
(SMR) to explore the potential causal relationships between genes in specific 
immune cells and the risk of AD.
METHODS: By utilizing data sets of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) for 
14 different immune cell types and large-scale AD genome-wide association study 
(GWAS), we employed SMR to identify key genes associated with AD within specific 
immune cells. Sensitivity analyses, including F-statistic, colocalization, and 
assessment of horizontal pleiotropy, were further conducted to validate the 
discovered genes. In addition, replication analyses were performed in AD GWAS 
from the FinnGen consortium. Finally, we further identified existing drugs that 
target or interact with the druggable genes and reviewed the studies about the 
associations between these drugs and AD.
RESULTS: SMR analysis revealed 342 genes associated with AD across 14 immune 
cell types. Further sensitivity analyses identified nine genes, CTSH, FCER1G, 
FNBP4, HLA-E, JAZF1, KNOP1, PLEKHA1, RP11-960L18.1, and ZNF638 that had 
significant associations with AD across nine specific immune cell types. JAZF1, 
KNOP1 and PLEKHA1 were replicated in an independent analysis using the GWAS 
data. The review on gene-related drugs also supported these findings.
CONCLUSIONS: Our research suggests that the expression of the genes JAZF1, 
KNOP1, and PLEKHA1 in specific immune cell types is related to the risk of AD.

Complement is a critical component of innate immunity, evolved to defend against 
pathogens and clear toxic debris ranging from dead and dying cells to immune 
complexes. These roles make complement a key player in homeostasis; however, 
complement has a dark side. When the rigid control mechanisms fail, complement 
becomes dysregulated, acting as a driver of inflammation and resultant pathology 
in numerous diseases. Roles of complement in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other 
dementias have emerged in recent years, supported by genetic, biomarker and 
pathological evidence and animal model studies. Numerous questions remain 
regarding the precise roles of complement in the brain in health and disease, 
including where and when complement is expressed, how it contributes to immune 
defence and garbage disposal in the healthy brain, and exactly how complement 
contributes to pathology in dementias. In this brief review, we will summarise 
current knowledge on complement roles in brain, present the evidence implicating 
complement in AD and explore whether complement represents an attractive 
therapeutic target for AD.

Autophagy is a conserved eukaryotic cellular clearance and recycling process 
through the lysosome-mediated degradation of damaged organelles and protein 
aggregates to maintain homeostasis. Impairment of the autophagy-lysosomal 
pathway is implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Transcription factor EB (TFEB) is a master regulator of autophagy and lysosomal 
biogenesis. Therefore, activating TFEB and autophagy provides a novel strategy 
for AD treatment. We previously described that clomiphene citrate (CC) promotes 
nuclear translocation of TFEB and increases autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis. 
In this study, 7- and 3-month-old APP/PS1 mice were treated with TFEB agonist CC 
and assessed. The behavioral tests were performed using Morris water maze and 
open field test. Additional changes in amyloid-β pathology, autophagy, and 
inflammatory response were determined. We found that CC activated TFEB and the 
autophagy-lysosomal pathway in neuronal cells. Moreover, using mouse model of 
Alzheimer's disease, CC treatment promoted clearance of amyloid-β plaques and 
ameliorated cognitive function in both 7- and 3-month-old APP/PS1 mice. The 
CC-induced activation of TFEB occurs by promoting acetylation of TFEB for 
nuclear translocation. These findings provide a molecular mechanism for the 
TFEB-mediated activation of the autophagy-lysosome pathway by CC, which has the 
potential to be repurposed and applied in the treatment or prevention of AD.

Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), an emerging persistent organic pollutant, has 
been controversial in its impact on cognitive functions. Our previous research 
has confirmed that the sub-chronic PFOS exposure leads to neuronal apoptosis in 
the cerebral cortex, impairing cognitive functions in normal mice. However, our 
current study presents a surprising finding: sub-chronic exposure to PFOS 
effectively reduces cognitive impairments in Alzheimer's disease (AD) mice and 
significantly retards the disease's progression. Our results indicate that PFOS 
exposure upregulates the expression level of insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) in 
the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of AD mice, thereby selectively enhancing the 
amyloid-beta (Aβ) clearance pathway without affecting the Aβ production. 
Moreover, PFOS exposure inhibits microglial proliferation and reduces 
inflammatory cytokines levels in the PFC of AD mice, providing further 
supporting for the pivotal role of IDE in attenuating AD progression under PFOS 
exposure. Collectively, our study is the first to demonstrate that sub-chronic 
PFOS exposure can alleviates cognitive impairments in AD pathology, with the 
IDE-mediated Aβ clearance pathway potentially playing a critical role.

BACKGROUND: The clinical pathogenesis of COVID-19 necessitates a comprehensive 
and homogeneous study to understand the disease mechanisms. Identifying clinical 
symptoms and laboratory parameters as key predictors can guide prognosis and 
inform effective treatment strategies. This study analyzed comorbidities and 
laboratory metrics to predict COVID-19 mortality using a homogeneous model.
METHOD: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 7500 COVID-19 patients 
admitted to Rasoul Akram Hospital between 2022 and 2022. Clinical and laboratory 
data, along with comorbidity information, were collected and analyzed using 
advanced coding, data alignment, and regression analyses. Machine learning 
algorithms were employed to identify relevant features and calculate predictive 
probability scores.
RESULTS: The frequency and mortality rates of COVID-19 among males (19.3 %) were 
higher than those among females (17 %) (p = 0.01, OR = 0.85, 95 % CI = 
0.76-0.96). Cancer (p < 0.05, OR = 1.9, 95 % CI = 1.48-2.4) and Alzheimer's 
(p < 0.05, OR = 2.36, 95 % CI = 1.89-2.9) were the two most common comorbidities 
associated with long-term hospitalization (LTH). Kidney disease (KD) was 
identified as the most lethal comorbidity (45 % of KD patients) (OR = 5.6, 95 % 
CI = 5.05-6.04, p < 0.001). Age > 55 was the most predictive parameter for 
mortality (p < 0.001, OR = 6.5, 95 % CI = 1.03-1.04), and the CT scan score 
showed no predictive value for death (p > 0.05). WBC, Cr, CRP, ALP, and VBG-HCO3 
were the most significant critical data associated with death prediction across 
all comorbidities (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is particularly lethal for elderly adults; thus, age plays 
a crucial role in disease prognosis. Regarding death prediction, various 
comorbidities rank differently, with KD having a significant impact on mortality 
outcomes.

In recent years, an increasing amount of work has been carried out regarding the 
study of the etiopathology of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). This neurodegenerative 
disease is characterized by several organic and molecular correlates, which 
paint a complex picture that also reflects the historic challenge faced by the 
worldwide scientific community in finding an effective cure for it. In this 
paper, we describe the synthesis of novel rivastigmine derivatives and their 
characterization as wide-spectrum enzyme (AChE, BChE, FAAH, MAO-A and MAO-B) 
inhibitors with potential application in the therapy of AD following the 
paradigm of multi-target design. 5 (ROS151) and 23 show similar inhibitory 
profile compared to donepezil on cholinesterases, and ca. two hundred 
twenty-three and eighty-seven times more active than rivastigmine on AChE. 
Moreover, ROS151 was found to be a potential metal chelator. Compounds 6 and 8 
are very interesting and original multi-functional promising hybrids, with 
comparable potency on distinct panels of enzymes. All these promising 
rivastigmine-like hybrids were assayed for their pharmacokinetic properties by 
using different bio-analytical techniques, showing interesting applicability 
profiles. Moreover, cytotoxicity assays displayed a safety profile on three 
different cell lines.

This study presents the synthesis and characterization of a series of 13 novel 
acetamides. These were subjected to Ellman's assay to determine the efficacy of 
the AChE and BChE inhibitors. Finally, we report their antioxidant activity as 
an alternative approach for the search for drugs to treat AD. These studies 
revealed that compounds 1a-1k and 2l-2m were obtained in moderate yield. Four 
amides (1h, 1j, 1k, and 2l) were selective for one of the enzymes (BChE); thus, 
those that inhibited BChE were more active than the positive control 
(galantamine) and showed better IC50 values (3.30-5.03 µM). The theoretical free 
binding energies calculated by MM-GBSA indicated that all inhibitors were more 
stable than rivastigmine, and the inhibition mechanisms involved the entire 
active site: peripheral anionic site, oxyanion hole, acyl-binding pockets, and 
catalytic site. We examined the cytotoxicity of compounds 1h, 1j, 1k, and 2l in 
human dermal cells and found that they did not exhibit any toxic effects under 
the tested conditions. Additionally, these compounds, which also inhibited BChE, 
displayed mixed inhibition and did not exhibit hemolytic effects on human 
erythrocytes. Furthermore, the ABTS and DPPH assays indicated that, although 
none of the compounds showed activity in the DPPH assay, the EC50 values for 
radical trapping by the ABTS method showed that compounds 1a, 1d, 1e, and 1g had 
EC50 values lower than 10 µg/mL, indicating their strong radical scavenging 
capacity. We also report the crystal structures of compounds 1c, 1d, 1f, and 1g, 
which are found in monoclinic crystal systems.

OBJECTIVES: To derive data-driven subtypes of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 
and characterize the complicated changes of general cognitive and daily 
functions over time in MCI subtypes.
METHODS: A total of 813 subjects diagnosed as MCI at baseline from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were included. Data-driven 
MCI subtypes were derived from group-based multi-trajectory modeling (GBMTM) 
analyses using longitudinal measurement scores in the cognitive domains of 
visuospatial function, language, and executive function. General cognitive and 
daily functions were measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and 
the Functional Assessment Questionnaire (FAQ), respectively, whose longitudinal 
trajectory changes were depicted by Linear mixed models.
RESULTS: Three MCI subtypes were derived, which were defined as "Cognitive 
decline group", "Mild cognitive decline group" and "No cognitive decline group". 
The "Mild cognitive decline group" had the highest percentage in the sample 
(46.2 %), followed by the "No cognitive decline group" (35.2 %). Patients in the 
"Cognitive decline group" had the highest mean age (74.69 years) at baseline, 
the highest APOE ε4 carriers (63.2 %), and the greatest dementia conversion rate 
(77.0 %). The changes in MMSE and FAQ score trajectories were fastest in the 
"Cognitive decline group" in the first 36 months and most slowly in the "No 
cognitive decline group".
CONCLUSION: MCI individuals could be subdivided into more fine-grained cognitive 
subtypes, and identifying these distinct MCI subtypes and their different 
trajectories of cognitive decline may have important prognostic value for 
improving clinical course prediction.

In this work, we exemplified the "copride" family of drug candidates able to 
both inhibit acetylcholinesterase and to activate 5-HT4 receptors, with 
anti-amnesiant and promnesiant activities in mice. Twenty-one analogs of 
donecopride, the first-in class representative of the series, were synthesized 
exploring the influence on the biological activities of the substituents 
(methoxy, amine and chlorine) carried by its phenyl ring. This work was the 
support of an intensive structure-activity relationship study and allowed to 
obtain some interesting derivatives of donecopride. In this respect, the 
replacement of the methoxy group of the latter with a deuterated one led to 
deudonecopride. On the other hand, the replacement of the chlorine atom of 
donecopride by various halogen atoms was of particular interest, among which 
fluorine led to a potent analog, we called flucopride. The latter exhibited 
promising in vitro activities associated to excellent drugability parameters. 
Flucopride was consequently involved in in vivo studies such as a 
scopolamine-induced deficit model of working memory and in a novel object 
recognition test. Through these evaluations, flucopride demonstrated both its 
antiamnesiant and promnesiant capacities, which could make it a potential 
preclinical drug candidate for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

Aging is an intricate process involving interactions among multiple factors, 
which is one of the main risks for chronic diseases, including Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). As a member of cysteine protease, cathepsin S (CTSS) has been 
implicated in inflammation across various diseases. Here, we investigated the 
role of neuronal CTSS in aging and AD started by examining CTSS expression in 
hippocampus neurons of aging mice and identified a significant increase, which 
was negatively correlated with recognition abilities. Concurrently, we observed 
an elevation of CTSS concentration in the serum of elderly people. Transcriptome 
and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) results revealed that CTSS 
overexpression in neurons aggravated brain inflammatory milieu with microglia 
activation to M1 pro-inflammatory phenotype, activation of chemokine 
C-X3-C-motif ligand 1 (CX3CL1)-chemokine C-X3-C-motif receptor 1 (CX3CR1) axis 
and janus kinase 2 (JAK2)-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 
(STAT3) pathway. As CX3CL1 is secreted by neurons and acts on the CX3CR1 in 
microglia, our results revealed for the first time the role of neuron CTSS in 
neuron-microglia "crosstalk." Besides, we observed elevated CTSS expression in 
multiple brain regions of AD patients, including the hippocampus. Utilizing CTSS 
selective inhibitor, LY3000328, rescued AD-related pathological features in 
APP/PS1 mice. We further noticed that neuronal CTSS overexpression increased 
cathepsin B (CTSB) activity, but decreased cathepsin L (CTSL) activity in 
microglia. Overall, we provide evidence that CTSS can be used as an aging 
biomarker and plays regulatory roles through modulating neuroinflammation and 
recognition in aging and AD process.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by 
progressive behavioral and cognitive impairments. Despite growing evidence of 
the neuroprotective action of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), the 
effects and mechanism of omega-3 PUFAs on AD control are yet to be clarified. By 
crossing male heterozygous fat-1 mice with female APP/PS1 mice, we assessed 
whether elevated tissue omega-3 PUFA levels could alleviate AD progression and 
their underlying mechanism among the offspring WT, APP/PS1 and APP/PS1 × fat-1 
groups at various stages. We found that the fat-1 transgene significantly 
increased brain omega-3 PUFA and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) levels, and 
cognitive deficits together with brain Aβ-40 and Aβ-42 levels in 6-month-old 
APP/PS1 × fat-1 mice were significantly lower than those in APP/PS1 mice. 
Subsequently, the tandem mass tag (TMT) method revealed the elevated expression 
of cortex and hippocampus myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) in APP/PS1 × 
fat-1 mice at 2-6 months. Furthermore, GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis 
suggested that the MAG-related myelin sheath pathway and its interaction with AD 
were regulated by omega-3 PUFAs. Moreover, subsequent western blot assays showed 
that both increased endogenous omega-3 levels and in vitro supplemented DHA 
up-regulated MAG expression, and the AD-protective effects of DHA on LPS-induced 
BV2 cells were significantly weakened when MAG was inhibited by si-RNA 
transfection. In summary, our study suggested that omega-3 PUFAs might protect 
against AD by up-regulating MAG expression.

Inflammation is considered as one of the most primary protective innate immunity 
responses, closely related to the body's defense mechanism for responding to 
chemical, biological infections, or physical injuries. Furthermore, prolonged 
inflammation is undesirable, playing an important role in the development of 
various diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, 
atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and even certain cancers. Marine-derived 
fungi represent promising sources of structurally novel bioactive natural 
products, and have been a focus of research for the development of 
anti-inflammatory drugs. This review covers secondary metabolites with 
anti-inflammatory activities from marine-derived fungi, over the period spanning 
August 2018 to July 2024. A total of 285 anti-inflammatory metabolites, 
including 156 novel compounds and 11 with novel skeleton structures, are 
described. Their structures are categorized into five categories: terpenoids, 
polyketides, nitrogen-containing compounds, steroids, and other classes. The 
biological targets, as well as the in vitro and in vivo screening models, were 
surveyed and statistically summarized. This paper aims to offer valuable 
insights to researchers in the exploration of natural products and the discovery 
of anti-inflammatory drugs.

Background/Objectives: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related degenerative 
brain disorder characterized by a progressive decline in cognitive function and 
memory. This study aimed to evaluate whether rutin hydrate (RH) has 
neuroprotective effects in an AD-like learning and memory impairment rat model 
induced by scopolamine (SCO). Methods: The rats were administered with RH (100 
mg/kg) and SCO (1.5 mg/kg) and underwent behavioral tests, including the Morris 
water maze test, Y-maze test, and passive avoidance test, to evaluate their 
learning and memory abilities. Additionally, long-term potentiation (LTP) was 
induced to observe changes in the field excitatory postsynaptic potential 
(fEPSP) activity. Results: RH treatment attenuated the SCO-induced shortening of 
step-through latency in the passive avoidance (PA) test, increased the 
percentage of alternation in the Y-maze, and increased the time spent in the 
target zone in the Morris water maze (MWM). Moreover, RH increased the total 
activity of fEPSP following theta burst stimulation and attenuated the 
SCO-induced blockade of fEPSP. RH also ameliorated the SCO-induced decrease in 
the expression levels of the BDNF, TrkB, ERK, CREB, and Bcl-2 proteins and the 
increase in the Bax protein level in the rat hippocampus. This demonstrates that 
RH has beneficial neuroprotective effects in the brain, improving learning, 
memory, and synaptic plasticity in rats. Conclusions: Our results highlight the 
molecular and cellular mechanisms through which RH exerts its neuroprotective 
effects in the prevention and treatment of learning and memory deficit 
disorders. RH could potentially be used as a therapeutic strategy for the 
restoration of learning and memory function and the prevention of the 
progression of AD.

Neurological diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), are the 
primary cause of disability worldwide and the second leading cause of death. The 
chronic nature of these conditions and the lack of disease-modifying therapies 
highlight the urgent need for developing effective therapies. To accomplish 
this, effective models of NDDs are required to increase our understanding of 
underlying pathophysiology and for evaluating treatment efficacy. Traditionally, 
models of NDDs have focused on the central nervous system (CNS). However, 
evidence points to a relationship between systemic factors and the development 
of NDDs. Cardiovascular disease and related risk factors have been shown to 
modify the cerebral vasculature and the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. 
These findings, combined with reports of changes to vascular density and 
blood-brain barrier integrity in other NDDs, such as Huntington's disease and 
Parkinson's disease, suggest that cardiovascular health may be predictive of 
brain function. To evaluate this, we explore evidence for disruptions to the 
circulatory system in murine models of NDDs, evidence of disruptions to the CNS 
in cardiovascular disease models and summarize models combining cardiovascular 
disruption with models of NDDs. In this study, we aim to increase our 
understanding of cardiovascular disease and neurodegeneration interactions 
across multiple disease states and evaluate the utility of combining model 
systems.

The landscape of pharmacological treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD) has 
undergone significant transformations with the advent of disease-modifying 
therapies (DMTs) targeting β-Amyloid (Aβ) accumulation, one of the hallmark 
pathologies of AD. The approval and market introduction of monoclonal antibodies 
mark the dawn of a new era in AD therapeutics as well. Furthermore, considerable 
progress has also been made in the development of new drugs targeting non-Aβ and 
non-Tau protein pathways. These advancements are key in tackling the root causes 
of AD, offering hope for treatments that both relieve symptoms and slow disease 
progression, improving patient outcomes and quality of life. This review aims to 
provide a comprehensive update on the advances in drug development and 
application for AD, including those currently in clinical trials and those 
already approved for the market to treat patients.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease 
characterized by structural changes in the brain, including hippocampal atrophy, 
cortical thinning, amyloid plaques, and tau tangles. Due to the aging of the 
global population, the burden of Alzheimer's disease is expected to increase, 
making the exploration of non-pharmacological interventions, such as physical 
exercise, an urgent priority.
RESULTS: There is emerging evidence that regular physical exercise may mitigate 
the structural and functional declines associated with Alzheimer's disease. The 
underlying mechanisms, however, remain poorly understood. Gut-brain axis 
research is a promising area for further investigation. This system involves 
bidirectional communication between the gut microbiome and the brain. According 
to recent studies, the gut microbiome may influence brain health through 
modulating neuroinflammation, producing neuroactive compounds, and altering 
metabolic processes. Exercise has been shown to alter the composition of the gut 
microbiome, potentially impacting brain structure and function. In this review, 
we aim to synthesize current research on the relationship between physical 
exercise, structural brain changes in Alzheimer's disease, and the gut-brain 
axis.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we will investigate whether changes in the gut 
microbiome induced by physical exercise can mediate its neuroprotective effects, 
offering new insights into the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease. 
By integrating findings from neuroimaging studies, clinical trials, and 
microbiome research, this review will highlight potential mechanisms. It will 
also identify key gaps in the literature. This will pave the way for future 
research directions.

Republic of Korea.

Neurodegenerative disorders, particularly Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, 
continue to challenge modern medicine despite therapeutic advances. Orphan 
G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have emerged as promising targets in the 
central nervous system, offering new avenues for drug development. This review 
focuses on the structural biology of orphan GPCRs implicated in these disorders, 
providing a comprehensive analysis of their molecular architecture and 
functional mechanisms. We examine recent breakthroughs in structural 
determination techniques, such as cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray 
crystallography, which have elucidated the intricate conformations of these 
receptors. The review highlights how structural insights inform our 
understanding of orphan GPCR activation, ligand binding and signaling pathways. 
By integrating structural data with molecular pharmacology, we explore the 
potential of structure-guided approaches in developing targeted therapeutics 
toward orphan GPCRs. This structural-biology-centered perspective aims to deepen 
our comprehension of orphan GPCRs and guide future drug discovery efforts in 
neurodegenerative disorders.

Growing evidence suggests that neuroinflammation is not just a consequence of 
neurodegeneration in pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's 
disease, Huntington's disease or Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, but it is rather 
a determinant factor, which plays a pivotal role in the onset and progression of 
these disorders. Neuroinflammation can affect cells and processes in the central 
nervous system (CNS) as well as immune cells, and might precede protein 
aggregation, which is a hallmark of the neurodegenerative process. Standard 
treatment methods are far from being able to counteract inflammation and delay 
neurodegeneration. Remarkably, phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (PDE5is), which 
represent potent vasoactive drugs used as a first-line treatment for erectile 
dysfunction (ED), display important anti-inflammatory effects through cyclic 
guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) level stabilization. Since PDE5 hydrolyzes cGMP, 
several studies positioned PDE5 as a therapeutic target, and more specifically, 
PDE5is as potential alternative strategies for the treatment of a variety of 
neurological disorders. Indeed, PDE5is can limit neuroinflammation and enhance 
synaptic plasticity, with beneficial effects on cognitive function and memory. 
The aim of this review is to provide an overview of some of the main processes 
underlying neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration which may be potential 
targets for PDE5is, focusing on sildenafil, the most extensively studied. 
Current strategies using PDEis for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases 
will be summarized.

Tregs have the potential to be utilized as a novel therapeutic agent for the 
treatment of various chronic diseases, including diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, 
asthma, and rheumatoid arthritis. One of the challenges associated with 
developing a therapeutic product based on Tregs is the non-selectivity of 
polyclonal cells. A potential solution to this issue is a generation of 
antigen-specific CAR-Tregs. Other challenges associated with developing a 
therapeutic product based on Tregs include the phenotypic instability of these 
cells in an inflammatory microenvironment, discrepancies between engineered 
Treg-like cells and natural Tregs, and the expression of dysfunctional isoforms 
of Treg marker genes. This review presents a summary of proposed strategies for 
addressing these challenges.

INTRODUCTION: Early identification of clinical conditions associated with 
Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRD) is vital for intervention. One 
promising early detection method is the use of instrumented assessment to 
identify subtle motor declines associated with ADRD. This pilot study sought to 
establish the feasibility of building a machine learning model to identify 
individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using motor function data 
obtained from an inexpensive, portable device.
METHODS: Our novel, multimodal motor function assessment platform integrates a 
depth camera, forceplate, and interface board. Healthy older adults (n=28) and 
older adults with MCI (n=19) were assessed during static balance, gait, and 
sit-to-stand activities in both single- and dual-task conditions. Three machine 
learning models (ie, support vector machine, decision trees, and logistic 
regression) were trained and tested with the goal of classification of MCI.
RESULTS: Our best model was decision trees, which demonstrated an accuracy of 
83%, a sensitivity of 0.83, a specificity of 1.00, and an F1 score of 0.83. The 
top features were extracted and ranked on importance.
DISCUSSION: This study demonstrates the feasibility of building a machine 
learning model capable of identifying individuals with mild cognitive impairment 
using motor function data obtained with a portable, inexpensive, multimodal 
device.

OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative 
disorder. A key factor in its pathogenesis is the dysfunction of the 
N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor due to D-serine degradation by D-amino acid 
oxidase. Benzoate has been suggested to enhance NMDA receptor function, 
potentially benefiting early-phase AD. This study aimed to synthesize evidence 
from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) on the safety and efficacy of sodium 
benzoate in AD patients.
METHODS: We followed PRISMA statement guidelines during the accommodation of 
this systematic review and meta-analysis. A computer literature search (PubMed, 
Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central) was conducted. We included RCTs 
that compared sodium benzoate with placebo regarding cognitive functions. The 
primary outcome measure was the Alzheimer's disease assessment scale-cognitive 
subscale, pooled as the mean difference between the two groups from baseline to 
the endpoint. The secondary outcomes measures are the clinician's 
interview-based impression of change plus caregiver input, catalase, and 
superoxide dismutase antioxidants.
RESULTS: Three RCTs (described in four articles) with 306 patients were included 
in this study. Sodium benzoate significantly improved the ADAS-cog score 
compared with placebo (MD -2.13 points, 95% CI [-3.35 to -0.90]; P= 0.0007).
CONCLUSION: Sodium benzoate is a safe drug that may improve cognitive function 
in patients with early-stage Alzheimer's disease. However, the significant 
effect arises primarily from one small study, highlighting the need for caution 
in interpretation. Further research with larger sample sizes and longer 
durations is necessary to validate these findings and assess safety and 
efficacy.

BACKGROUND: Depression is common in people with dementia, and negatively affects 
quality of life.
AIMS: This paper aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of an intervention for 
depression in mild and moderate dementia caused by Alzheimer's disease over 12 
months (PATHFINDER trial), from both the health and social care and societal 
perspectives.
METHOD: A total of 336 participants were randomised to receive the adapted PATH 
intervention in addition to treatment as usual (TAU) (n = 168) or TAU alone (n = 
168). Health and social care resource use were collected with the Client Service 
Receipt Inventory and health-related quality-of-life data with the EQ-5D-5L 
instrument at baseline and 3-, 6- and 12-month follow-up points. Principal 
analysis comprised quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) calculated from the 
participant responses to the EQ-5D-5L instrument.
RESULTS: The mean cost of the adapted PATH intervention was estimated at £1141 
per PATHFINDER participant. From a health and social care perspective, the mean 
difference in costs between the adapted PATH and control arm at 12 months was 
-£74 (95% CI -£1942 to £1793), and from the societal perspective was -£671 (95% 
CI -£9144 to £7801). The mean difference in QALYs was 0.027 (95% CI -0.004 to 
0.059). At £20 000 per QALY gained threshold, there were 74 and 68% 
probabilities of adapted PATH being cost-effective from the health and social 
care and societal perspective, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The addition of the adapted PATH intervention to TAU for people 
with dementia and depression generated cost savings alongside a higher quality 
of life compared with TAU alone; however, the improvements in costs and QALYs 
were not statistically significant.

Early imaging-based detection of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) has improved in the 
era of reperfusion therapy. Despite of this, prognosis of outcome after AIS 
remains a challenge. Therefore, parameters that support clinical decision making 
are sought. Blood-based biomarkers have the potential to provide valuable 
information in addition to the established prognostic factors. Neuronal 
biomarkers of acute or degenerative neuronal injury have shown to be reliably 
detected in plasma. These biomarkers are well-established in neurodegenerative 
pathology, such as Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we explored the 
association between stroke diameter and plasma biomarkers for neuronal injury 
and tau pathophysiology (brain-derived tau [BD-tau], phosphorylated-tau-217 
[p-tau21] and neurofilament light [NfL]) in patients (n = 193) admitted to the 
acute ward, Akershus University Hospital. All patients received a final 
diagnosis of AIS, transient ischemic attack or stroke mimics. Blood samples were 
obtained the day after admission. We find that levels of BD-tau (p = .004) and 
NfL (p = .011) were higher after AIS than in patients with stroke mimics. The 
cortical stroke diameter correlated with BD-tau (tau-b = 0.64, p < .001) and 
p-tau217 (tau-b = 0.36, p = .003). Linear regression confirmed BD-tau to be the 
strongest variable associated with stroke diameter, pointing to the potential 
clinical value of plasma BD-tau in outcome prediction after AIS.

OBJECTIVES: Older people reporting subjective memory complaints (SMCs) may have 
a greater risk of cognitive decline. Multidomain lifestyle interventions are a 
promising strategy for the prevention of cognitive decline. The aim of this 
study was to investigate whether the presence of SMCs affects the efficacy of a 
2-year multidomain lifestyle intervention on cognition.
METHODS: This study is part of the Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to 
Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER) project. Participants (a 
subsample of 568 individuals, baseline age 60-77 years) were randomized (1:1) to 
receive a 2-year multidomain lifestyle intervention group including dietary 
advice, exercise, cognitive training, and vascular risk management, or regular 
health advice control group. Cognitive performance was assessed at baseline and 
at 1- and 2-year visits, using a neuropsychological test battery, including 
tests assessing memory, executive functions, and processing speed. Participants 
rated the frequency of SMCs using the Prospective and Retrospective Memory 
Questionnaire.
RESULTS: Having more retrospective SMCs was linked to a less favorable cognitive 
trajectory over 2 years. The difference between the intervention and control 
groups in annual change in tested memory performance was 0.077 (95% CI, 
0.008-0.146) among those reporting more retrospective SMCs and -0.011 (-0.074 to 
0.053) among those with less SMCs; interaction effect p = .019. No other 
interactions between SMCs and intervention allocation were observed.
DISCUSSION: A lifestyle intervention may be beneficial for older adults with and 
without SMCs. Persons having more retrospective SMCs may benefit more from the 
intervention regarding memory functioning. Clinical Trials Registration Number: 
NCT01041989.

This study aims to evaluate the therapeutic application of N-acetylcysteine 
(NAC) as a treatment or adjunct therapy for various medical conditions. While 
its efficacy in treating acetaminophen overdose, cystic fibrosis, and chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease is well-established, emerging evidence suggests 
that NAC may also benefit a broader spectrum of illnesses due to its safety, 
simplicity, and affordability. A comprehensive review was conducted by searching 
PubMed, relevant books, and conference proceedings for publications discussing 
NAC about the specified health conditions. The clinically relevant data were 
analysed using the American Family Physician Evidence-Based Medicine Toolkit, 
following a standard integrated review methodology. NAC shows potential as an 
adjunctive treatment for a wide range of medical conditions, particularly 
chronic diseases. It may be beneficial for polycystic ovary syndrome, 
endometriosis, male infertility, cataracts, glaucoma, dry eye syndrome, 
parkinsonism, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, stroke outcomes, 
non-acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure, Crohn's disease, ulcerative 
colitis, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. 
Although evidence for some conditions is less robust, NAC's therapeutic 
potential warrants further investigation. Given the aging population and the 
decline in glutathione levels, the use of NAC should be considered across a 
variety of medical conditions. This paper suggests that NAC supplementation 
could play a significant role in reducing morbidity and mortality associated 
with numerous chronic diseases.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease leading to 
dementia in the elderly, and the mechanisms of AD have not been fully defined. 
Circular RNAs (circRNAs), covalently closed RNAs produced by reverse splicing, 
have critical effects in the pathogenesis of AD. CircRNAs participate in 
production and clearance of Aβ and tau, regulate neuroinflammation, synaptic 
plasticity and the process of apoptosis and autophagy, indicating that circRNAs 
may be alternative biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Our review summarizes the 
functions of circRNAs in the progression and development of AD, which provide 
insights into the prospect of circRNAs in the diagnosis and treatment of AD.

BACKGROUND: Biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI, or prodromal AD) are highly significant for early diagnosis, clinical 
trials and treatment outcome evaluations. Electroencephalography (EEG), being 
noninvasive and easily accessible, has recently been the center of focus. 
However, a comprehensive understanding of EEG in dementia is still needed. A 
primary objective of this study is to investigate which of the many EEG 
characteristics could effectively differentiate between individuals with AD or 
prodromal AD and healthy individuals.
METHODS: We collected resting state EEG data from individuals with AD, prodromal 
AD, and normal cognition. Two distinct preprocessing pipelines were employed to 
study the reliability of the extracted measures across different datasets. We 
extracted 41 different EEG features. We have also developed a stand-alone 
software application package, Feature Analyzer, as a comprehensive toolbox for 
EEG analysis. This tool allows users to extract 41 EEG features spanning various 
domains, including complexity measures, wavelet features, spectral power ratios, 
and entropy measures. We performed statistical tests to investigate the 
differences in AD or prodromal AD from age-matched cognitively normal 
individuals based on the extracted EEG features, power spectral density (PSD), 
and EEG functional connectivity.
RESULTS: Spectral power ratio measures such as theta/alpha and theta/beta power 
ratios showed significant differences between cognitively normal and AD 
individuals. Theta power was higher in AD, suggesting a slowing of oscillations 
in AD; however, the functional connectivity of the theta band was decreased in 
AD individuals. In contrast, we observed increased gamma/alpha power ratio, 
gamma power, and gamma functional connectivity in prodromal AD. Entropy and 
complexity measures after correcting for multiple electrode comparisons did not 
show differences in AD or prodromal AD groups. We thus catalogued AD and 
prodromal AD-specific EEG features.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal that the changes in power and connectivity in 
certain frequency bands of EEG differ in prodromal AD and AD. The spectral 
power, power ratios, and the functional connectivity of theta and gamma could be 
biomarkers for diagnosis of AD and prodromal AD, measure the treatment outcome, 
and possibly a target for brain stimulation.

Treatment strategies that are efficient against established Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) are needed. BRICHOS is a molecular chaperone domain that prevents amyloid 
fibril formation and associated cellular toxicity. In this study, we treated an 
AD mouse model seven months after pathology onset, using intravenous 
administration of recombinant human (rh) Bri2 BRICHOS R221E. Two injections of 
rh Bri2 BRICHOS R221E per week for three months in AD mice reduced amyloid β 
(Aβ) burden, and mitigated astro- and microgliosis, as determined by glial 
fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 
(Iba1) immunohistochemistry. Sequencing of RNA from cortical microglia cells 
showed that BRICHOS treatment normalized the expression of identified 
plaque-induced genes in mice and humans, including clusterin and GFAP. Rh Bri2 
BRICHOS R221E passed the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in age-matched wild-type mice 
as efficiently as in the AD mice, but then had no effect on measures of AD-like 
pathology, and mainly affected the expression of genes that affect cellular 
shape and movement. These results indicate a potential of rh Bri2 BRICHOS 
against advanced AD and underscore the ability of BRICHOS to target 
amyloid-induced pathology.

The profile of autoantibodies is dysregulated in patients with Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). Autoantibodies to beta-site amyloid precursor protein 
(APP)-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) are present in human blood. This study aims to 
investigate the clinical relevance and pathophysiological roles of 
autoantibodies to BACE1 in AD. Clinical investigations were conducted in two 
independent cohorts, the Chongqing cohort, and the Australian Imaging, 
Biomarkers, and Lifestyle (AIBL) cohort. The Chongqing cohort included 55 AD 
patients, 28 patients with non-AD dementia, and 70 cognitively normal subjects 
(CN). The AIBL cohort included 162 Aβ-PET- CN, 169 Aβ-PET+ cognitively normal 
subjects (preclinical AD), and 31 Aβ-PET+ cognitively impaired subjects 
(Clinical AD). Plasma autoantibodies to BACE1 were determined by one-site Elisa. 
The associations of plasma autoantibodies to BACE1 with brain Aβ load and 
cognitive trajectory were investigated. The effects of autoantibodies to BACE1 
on AD-type pathologies and underlying mechanisms were investigated in APP/PS1 
mice and SH/APPswe/PS1wt cell lines. In the Chongqing cohort, plasma 
autoantibodies to BACE1 were higher in AD patients, in comparison with CN and 
non-AD dementia patients. In the AIBL cohort, plasma autoantibodies to BACE1 
were highest in clinical AD patients, followed by preclinical AD and CN 
subjects. Higher autoantibodies to BACE1 were associated with an increased 
incidence of brain amyloid positivity conversion during follow-up. 
Autoantibodies to BACE1 exacerbated brain amyloid deposition and subsequent 
AD-type pathologies, including Tau hyperphosphorylation, neuroinflammation, and 
neurodegeneration in APP/PS1 mice. Autoantibodies to BACE1 increased Aβ 
production by promoting BACE1 expression through inhibiting PPARγ signaling. 
These findings suggest that autoantibodies to BACE1 are pathogenic in AD and the 
upregulation of these autoantibodies may promote the development of the disease. 
This study offers new insights into the mechanism of AD from an autoimmune 
perspective.

This research examined the distinctions in brain network characteristics among 
individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 
a control group. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and mini-mental state 
examination (MMSE) data were retrieved from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ANDI) database, comprising 40 subjects in each group. Correlation 
maps for evaluating brain network connectivity were generated using fractal 
dimension (FD) analysis, a method capable of quantifying morphological changes 
in cortical and cerebral regions. Employing graph theory, each parcellated brain 
region was represented as a node, and edges between nodes were utilized to 
compute small-world network properties for each group. In the comparison between 
control and AD demonstrated the significantly lower FD values (P<0.05) in 
temporal lobe, motor cortex, part of occipital and parietal, hippocampus, 
amygdala, and entorhinal cortex, which present the atrophy. Similarly, comparing 
control group to MCIs, regions closely associated with memory, such as the 
hippocampus, showed significantly lower FD values. Furthermore, both AD and MCI 
groups displayed diminished connectivity and decreased network efficiency. In 
conclusion, fractal dimension (FD) analysis illustrate the progression of 
structural declination from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). Additionally, structural small-world network analysis presents 
itself as a potential method for assessing network efficiency and the 
progression of AD. Moving forward, further clinical assessments are warranted to 
validate the findings observed in this study.

Ultrasound neuromodulation is a promising noninvasive technique capable of 
penetrating the skull and precisely targeting deep brain regions with millimeter 
accuracy. Recent studies have demonstrated that transcranial ultrasound 
stimulation (TUS) of sleep-related brain areas can induce sleep in mice and even 
trigger a reversible, hibernation-like state without causing damage. Beyond its 
utility in preclinical models of central nervous system diseases, such as 
epilepsy, tremors, Alzheimer's disease, and depression, TUS holds significant 
potential for clinical translation. Given that many neurological disorders, 
including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, are associated with sleep 
abnormalities, leveraging clinical TUS applications for these diseases also 
creates a pathway for translating this technology to sleep modulation in human 
use. These findings highlight the potential for ultrasound neuromodulation to 
advance neuroscience research and clinical applications in sleep control.

Huperzine A (HupA) is used in Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapy for its effective 
inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and enhancement of cholinergic 
neuronal function. However, direct oral administration and injection of HupA 
cause side effects like nausea, anorexia, and rapid metabolism. Using a 
tripolymer, poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate 
(PBVHx), from the polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) family synthesized via synthetic 
biology, we present a novel AD therapy strategy with peritoneally administered 
PBVHx microspheres loaded with HupA (HupA-PBVHxMs). This approach extends HupA's 
metabolic duration in the blood and brain, enhancing AChE inhibition efficacy. 
Uniformly sized HupA-PBVHxMs, created using microfluidics and rotary 
evaporation, show up to 70.4 % drug encapsulation efficiency, sustained HupA 
release for 40 days, reduced neurotoxicity from Aβ25-35, and maintained in vivo 
HupA supply and AChE inhibition for over 20 days. In cognitive tests, 
HupA-PBVHxMs improved function in AD mice. Thus, PBVHx microspheres with slower 
HupA release and lower biotoxicity offer a superior platform for sustained AChE 
inhibitor release, outperforming commercial PLGA microspheres.

Knowledge on the genetic basis of Parkinson's disease has grown tremendously 
since the discovery of the first monogenic form, caused by a mutation in 
α-synuclein, and with the subsequent identification of multiple other causative 
genes and associated loci. Genetic studies provide insights into the phenotypic 
heterogeneity and global distribution of Parkinson's disease. By shedding light 
on the underlying biological mechanisms, genetics facilitates the identification 
of new biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Several clinical trials of 
genetics-informed therapies are ongoing or imminent. International programmes in 
populations who have been under-represented in Parkinson's disease genetics 
research are fostering collaboration and capacity-building, and have already 
generated novel findings. Many challenges remain for genetics research in these 
populations, but addressing them provides opportunities to obtain a more 
complete and equitable understanding of Parkinson's disease globally. These 
advances facilitate the integration of genetics into the clinic, to improve 
patient management and personalised medicine.

Interactions of Li(+) ions with NCS1: A potential mechanism of Li(+) 
neuroprotective action against psychotic disorders.

Li+ based drugs have been used for the treatment of psychiatric disorders due to 
their mood stabilizing role for decades. Recently, several studies reported the 
protective effect of Li+ against severe neuropathologies such as Parkinson's, 
Alzheimer's, and Huntington's disease. Surprisingly, despite a broad range of 
Li+ effects on neurological conditions, little is known about its molecular 
mechanism. In this study, we propose that neuronal calcium sensor 1 (NCS1), can 
be an effective molecular target for Li+ action. Here we show that the EF-hands 
in ApoNCS1 have submillimolar affinity for Li+ with Kd = 223 ± 19 μM. Li+ 
binding to ApoNCS1 quenches Trp emission intensity, suggesting distinct Trp 
sidechains environment in Li+NCS1 compared to ApoNCS1 and Ca2+NCS1. Li+ 
association also stabilizes the protein α-helical structure, in a similar way to 
Ca2+. Li+ association does not promote NCS1 dimerization. Association of Li+ 
increases NCS1 affinity for the D2R receptor binding peptide, in a similar way 
to Ca2+, however, the affinity of NCS1 for chlorpromazine is reduced with 
respect to Ca2+NCS1, possibly due to a decrease in solvent exposed hydrophobic 
area on the NCS1 surface in the presence of Li+. MD simulation data suggests 
that Li+ ions are coordinated by four oxygens from Asp and Glu sidechains and 
one carbonyl oxygen, in a similar way as reported previously for Li+ binding to 
DREAM. Overall, the data shows that Li+ binds to EF-hands of NCS1 and Li+NCS1 
interactions may be involved in the potential neuroprotective role of Li+ 
against psychotic disorders.

BACKGROUND: New treatments for 5q spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) have led to 
changes in the disease phenotype. Questions about long-term efficacy, however, 
persist. We present the results from five-year follow-up of the first ten 
Norwegian patients with SMA type1 treated with nusinersen.
METHODS: - Ten patients referred to the expanded access program were included. 
Standardized assessments with Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of 
Neuromuscular Disorders (CHOP INTEND), the Hammersmith Infant Neurological 
Examination (HINE-2), compound muscle action potential (CMAP) examination and 
cerebrospinal fluid analysis of neurofilament light chain (cNfL) were performed.
RESULT: Age at baseline ranged from three months to 11 years and eight months. 
Nine patients were alive and continued to receive treatment at 62 months of 
follow-up. CHOP INTEND scores increased significantly up to 38 months. Any 
further increase from 38 to 50 months was not statistically significant, and 
scores remained almost unchanged from 50 to 62 months. HINE-2 scores increased 
but the difference from baseline never reached statistical significance. The 
youngest patients showed the best motor outcome. The changes in CMAP scores were 
not statistically significant. cNfL values were significantly reduced after 18 
months compared with baseline; the largest difference occurred between baseline 
and 6 months. There was a significant negative correlation between log cNfL and 
CHOP INTEND (p = 0.042). Bulbar and respiratory function did not improve during 
the observation period.
CONCLUSION: Our findings support previously reported results on efficacy and 
safety of nusinersen. All patients have shown improvement in motor function. The 
need of respiratory and nutritional support did not improve.

Clinical trials based on a single molecular target continue to fail, and the 
adverse effects of Aβ protein aggregation and neuroinflammation need to be 
solved and treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Herein, by designed a nano-sized 
flower mesoporous selenium transport carrier (Met@MSe@Tf) with high enzyme-like 
activity, metformin (Met) was loaded, and transferrin (Tf) was modified to bind 
to transferrin receptor to promote receptor-mediated transport across the BBB. 
In the AD lesion environment, with the acidic environment response dissociation, 
promote the release of metformin by nanoflower to achieve therapeutic effect in 
the brain lesion site. Metformin, a major anti-diabetic drug in diabetic 
metabolism, has been found to be a promising new therapeutic target in 
neurodegenerative diseases. Further studies showed that the metformin drug 
release from the designed and synthesized transport nanoparticles showed high 
intrinsic activity and the ability to degrade the substrate involved, especially 
the degradation of Aβ deposition in the cortex and hippocampus, increased the 
phagocytosis of microglia, thus relieving neuroinflammation simultaneously. 
Collectively, in vivo experiments demonstrated that Met@MSe@Tf significantly 
increased the number of NeuN-positive neurons in the hippocampus of AD mice, 
promoted neurovascular normalization in the brain, and improved cognitive 
dysfunction in AD transgenic AD mice. Thus, it provides a preclinical proof of 
concept for the construction of a highly modular accurate drug delivery platform 
for Alzheimer's disease.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study was undertaken to compare the performance of 
plasma p-tau181 with that of [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission 
tomography (PET) in the identification of early biological Alzheimer disease 
(AD).
METHODS: We included 533 cognitively impaired participants from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Participants underwent PET scans, biofluid 
collection, and cognitive tests. Receiver operating characteristic analyses were 
used to determine the diagnostic accuracy of plasma p-tau181 and [18F]FDG-PET 
using clinical diagnosis and core AD biomarkers ([18F]florbetapir-PET and 
cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] p-tau181) as reference standards. Differences in the 
diagnostic accuracy between plasma p-tau181 and [18F]FDG-PET were determined by 
bootstrap-based tests. Correlations of [18F]FDG-PET and plasma p-tau181 with CSF 
p-tau181, amyloid β (Aβ) PET, and cognitive performance were evaluated to 
compare associations between measurements.
RESULTS: We observed that both plasma p-tau181 and [18F]FDG-PET identified 
individuals with positive AD biomarkers in CSF or on Aβ-PET. In the MCI group, 
plasma p-tau181 outperformed [18F]FDG-PET in identifying AD measured by CSF 
(p = 0.0007) and by Aβ-PET (p = 0.001). We also observed that both plasma 
p-tau181 and [18F]FDG-PET metabolism were associated with core AD biomarkers. 
However, [18F]FDG-PET uptake was more closely associated with cognitive outcomes 
(Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Mini-Mental State Examination, Clinical Dementia 
Rating Sum of Boxes, and logical memory delayed recall, p < 0.001) than plasma 
p-tau181.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, although both plasma p-tau181 and [18F]FDG-PET were 
associated with core AD biomarkers, plasma p-tau181 outperformed [18F]FDG-PET in 
identifying individuals with early AD pathophysiology. Taken together, our study 
suggests that plasma p-tau181 may aid in detecting individuals with underlying 
early AD.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD), an escalating global health issue, lacks 
effective treatments due to its complex pathogenesis. YangXue QingNao Wan 
(YXQNW) is a China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA)- approved TCM formula 
that has been repurposed in clinical Phase II for the treatment of AD. 
Identifying YXQNW's active ingredients and their mechanisms is crucial for 
developing effective AD treatments.
PURPOSE: This study aims to elucidate the anti-AD effects of YXQNW and to 
explore its potential therapeutic mechanisms employing an endophenotype network 
strategy.
METHODS: Herein we present an endophenotype network strategy that combines 
active ingredient identification in rat serum, network proximity prediction, 
metabolomics, and in vivo experimental validation in two animal models. 
Specially, utilizing UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS, active ingredients are identified in 
YXQNW to build a drug-target network. We applied network proximity to identify 
potential AD pathological mechanisms of YXQNW via integration of drug-target 
network, AD endophenotype gene sets, and human protein interactome, and 
validated related mechanisms in two animal models. In a d-galactose-induced 
senescent rat model, YXQNW was administered at varying doses for cognitive and 
neuronal assessments through behavioral tests, Nissl staining, and transmission 
electron microscopy (TEM). Metabolomic analysis with LC-MS revealed YXQNW's 
influence on brain metabolites, suggesting therapeutic pathways. Levels of key 
proteins and biochemicals were measured by WB and ELISA, providing insights into 
YXQNW's neuroprotective mechanisms. In addition, 5×FAD model mice were used and 
administered YXQNW by gavage for 14 days at two doses. Amyloid-β levels, 
transporter expression, and cerebral blood flow have been detected by MRI and 
biochemical assays.
RESULTS: The network proximity analysis showed that the effect of YXQNW on AD 
was highly correlated with amyloid β, synaptic function, glucose metabolism and 
mitochondrial function. The results of metabolomics combined with in vivo 
experimental validation suggest that YXQNW has the potential to ameliorate 
glucose transport abnormalities in the brain by upregulating the expression of 
GLUT1 and GLUT3, while further enhancing glucose metabolism through increased 
O-GlcNAcylation and mitigating mitochondrial dysfunction via the AMPK/Sirt1 
pathway, thereby improving d-galactose-induced cognitive deficits in rats. 
Additionally, YXQNW treatment significantly decreased Aβ1-42 levels and enhanced 
cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the hippocampus of 5×FAD mice. while mechanistic 
findings indicated that YXQNW treatment increased the expression of ABCB1, an Aβ 
transporter, in 5×FAD model mice to promote the clearance of Aβ from the brain 
and alleviate AD-like symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals that YXQNW may mitigate AD by inhibiting Aβ 
deposition and ameliorating mitochondrial dysfunction and glucose metabolism, 
thus offering a promising therapeutic approach for AD.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a neurodegenerative 
disorder characterized by pervasive personality and behavioural disturbances 
with severe impact on patients and caregivers. In current clinical practice, 
treatment is based on nonpharmacological and pharmacological approaches. 
Unfortunately, trial-based evidence supporting symptomatic pharmacological 
treatment for the behavioural disturbances in FTD is scarce despite the 
significant burden this poses on the patients and caregivers.
METHOD: The study examined drug management decisions for several behavioural 
disturbances in patients with FTD by 21 experts across European expert centres 
affiliated with the European Reference Network for Rare Neurological Diseases 
(ERN-RND).
RESULTS: The study revealed the highest consensus on drug treatments for 
physical and verbal aggression, impulsivity and obsessive delusions. 
Antipsychotics (primarily quetiapine) were recommended for behaviours posing 
safety risks to both patients and caregivers (aggression, self-injury and 
self-harm) and nightly unrest. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were 
recommended for perseverative somatic complaints, rigidity of thought, 
hyperphagia, loss of empathy and for impulsivity. Trazodone was specifically 
recommended for motor unrest, mirtazapine for nightly unrest, and bupropion and 
methylphenidate for apathy. Additionally, bupropion was strongly advised against 
in 10 out of the 14 behavioural symptoms, emphasizing a clear recommendation 
against its use in the majority of cases.
CONCLUSIONS: The survey data can provide expert guidance that is helpful for 
healthcare professionals involved in the treatment of behavioural symptoms. 
Additionally, they offer insights that may inform prioritization and design of 
therapeutic studies, particularly for existing drugs targeting behavioural 
disturbances in FTD.

IMPORTANCE: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of 
blindness among people aged 50 years or older worldwide. There is a need for new 
strategies for the prevention and treatment of AMD. There is some limited 
evidence to suggest the possibility of a protective association of dementia 
medications with the development of some types of AMD, but the evidence is weak.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the dementia medications memantine and 
donepezil are associated with the risk of developing AMD.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Three population-based cohort studies were 
performed using data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD and Aurum 
databases from May 15, 2002, to June 21, 2022. Participants included individuals 
with dementia (vascular dementia, nonvascular dementia, or Alzheimer disease) 
aged 40 years or older. Statistical analysis was carried out between February 
and November 2023.
EXPOSURES: Exposures were dementia medications. Cohort 1 compared patients 
prescribed donepezil with those prescribed rivastigmine or galantamine using the 
new-user design. Cohort 2 compared memantine with donepezil, rivastigmine, or 
galantamine using the prevalent new-user design. In a sensitivity analysis, 
cohort 3 compared memantine with rivastigmine or galantamine only.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: New diagnosis of AMD.
RESULTS: There were 132 846 individuals (mean [SD] age, 80.4 [7.6] years; 61.8% 
women; mean [SD] body mass index [BMI], 25.5 [4.6]) with a diagnosis of dementia 
included in cohort 1, 159 419 individuals (mean [SD] age, 81.2 [7.6] years; 
59.7% women; mean [SD] body mass index [BMI], 25.6 [4.7]) with a diagnosis of 
dementia included in cohort 2, and 92 328 individuals with a diagnosis of 
dementia included in cohort 3 (mean [SD] age, 80.9 [7.7] years; 58.5% women; 
mean [SD] body mass index [BMI], 25.5 [4.7]). The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for 
donepezil compared with rivastigmine or galantamine (cohort 1) was 0.95 (95% CI, 
0.67-1.35). The adjusted HR for memantine compared with donepezil, rivastigmine, 
or galantamine (cohort 2) was 1.03 (95% CI, 0.83-1.27). The adjusted HR for 
memantine vs rivastigmine or galantamine only (cohort 3) was 1.24 (95% CI, 
0.83-1.86).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study of patients with dementia found no 
significant associations between memantine or donepezil compared with other 
dementia medications and the risk of development of AMD. Further research is 
recommended to examine any possible pathophysiological protective action of 
memantine and other dementia medications against the development of AMD.

Gene therapy has made substantial progress in the treatment of the genetic 
diseases, focussing on the reduction of characteristics of recessive/dominant 
disorders, as well as various cancers. Extensive research has been conducted in 
the past few decades to investigate the application of nanotechnology and 
CRISPR/Cas technology in gene therapy. Nanotechnology due to attributes such has 
targeted drug delivery, controlled release, scalability and low toxicity has 
gained attention of the medical world. CRISPR/Cas9 system is considered as an 
impactful genome editing tool in the area of next-generation therapeutics and 
molecular diagnostics. CRISPR technology emphasises on gene editing, gene 
regulation modulation, and formulation of defined genetic changes. Its 
applications in treatment of the genetic disorders are extended beyond 
traditional therapies. These techniques are being explored as treatment of 
several genetic disorders including Duchenne muscular dystrophy, cystic 
fibrosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington disease. 
Despite considerable therapeutic potential of gene therapy, several obstacles 
must be addressed before it can be widely adopted in clinical practice, 
particularly in terms of ensuring safety and effectiveness. As research advances 
in this captivating field, these therapies will become the primary treatments 
and will have significant beneficial effects on the lives of patients with 
genetic disorders.

The clinical manifestation of Parkinson's disease exhibits significant 
heterogeneity in the prevalence of non-motor symptoms and the rate of 
progression of motor symptoms, suggesting that Parkinson's disease can be 
classified into distinct subtypes. In this study, we aimed to explore this 
heterogeneity by identifying a set of subtypes with distinct patterns of 
spatiotemporal trajectories of neurodegeneration. We applied Subtype and Stage 
Inference (SuStaIn), an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that combined 
disease progression modelling with clustering methods, to cortical and 
subcortical neurodegeneration visible on 3 T structural MRI of a large 
cross-sectional sample of 504 patients and 279 healthy controls. Serial 
longitudinal data were available for a subset of 178 patients at the 2-year 
follow-up and for 140 patients at the 4-year follow-up. In a subset of 210 
patients, concomitant Alzheimer's disease pathology was assessed by evaluating 
amyloid-β concentrations in the CSF or via the amyloid-specific radiotracer 
18F-flutemetamol with PET. The SuStaIn analysis revealed three distinct 
subtypes, each characterized by unique patterns of spatiotemporal evolution of 
brain atrophy: neocortical, limbic and brainstem. In the neocortical subtype, a 
reduction in brain volume occurred in the frontal and parietal cortices in the 
earliest disease stage and progressed across the entire neocortex during the 
early stage, although with relative sparing of the striatum, pallidum, accumbens 
area and brainstem. The limbic subtype represented comparative regional 
vulnerability, which was characterized by early volume loss in the amygdala, 
accumbens area, striatum and temporal cortex, subsequently spreading to the 
parietal and frontal cortices across disease stage. The brainstem subtype showed 
gradual rostral progression from the brainstem extending to the amygdala and 
hippocampus, followed by the temporal and other cortices. Longitudinal MRI data 
confirmed that 77.8% of participants at the 2-year follow-up and 84.0% at the 
4-year follow-up were assigned to subtypes consistent with estimates from the 
cross-sectional data. This three-subtype model aligned with empirically proposed 
subtypes based on age at onset, because the neocortical subtype demonstrated 
characteristics similar to those found in the old-onset phenotype, including 
older onset and cognitive decline symptoms (P < 0.05). Moreover, the subtypes 
correspond to the three categories of the neuropathological consensus criteria 
for symptomatic patients with Lewy pathology, proposing neocortex-, limbic- and 
brainstem-predominant patterns as different subgroups of α-synuclein 
distributions. Among the subtypes, the prevalence of biomarker evidence of 
amyloid-β pathology was comparable. Upon validation, the subtype model might be 
applied to individual cases, potentially serving as a biomarker to track disease 
progression and predict temporal evolution.

BACKGROUND: Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), a prevalent chronic neurological 
disorder, affects millions of individuals and is often resistant to 
anti-epileptic drugs. Increasing evidence has shown that acetylcholine (ACh) and 
cholinergic neurotransmission play a role in the pathophysiology of epilepsy. 
Tropisetron, an antiemetic drug used for chemotherapy in clinic, has displayed 
potential in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, depression, and schizophrenia 
in animal models. However, as a partial agonist of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine 
receptors (α7nAChRs), whether tropisetron possesses the therapeutic potential 
for TLE has not yet been determined.
METHODS: In this study, tropisetron was intraperitoneally injected into 
pilocarpine-induced epileptic rats for 3 weeks. Alpha-bungarotoxin (α-bgt), a 
specific α7nAChR antagonist, was applied to investigate the mechanism of 
tropisetron. Rats were assessed for spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) and 
cognitive function using video surveillance and Morris's water maze testing. 
Hippocampal impairment and synaptic structure were evaluated by Nissl staining, 
immunohistochemistry, and Golgi staining. Additionally, the levels of glutamate, 
γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), ACh, α7nAChRs, neuroinflammatory cytokines, 
glucocorticoids and their receptors, as well as synapse-associated protein 
(F-actin, cofilin-1) were quantified.
RESULTS: The results showed that tropisetron significantly reduced SRS, improved 
cognitive function, alleviated hippocampal sclerosis, and concurrently 
suppressed synaptic remodeling and the m6A modification of cofilin-1 in TLE 
rats. Furthermore, tropisetron lowered glutamate levels without affecting GABA 
levels, reduced neuroinflammation, and increased ACh levels and α7nAChR 
expression in the hippocampi of TLE rats. The effects of tropisetron treatment 
were counteracted by α-bgt.
CONCLUSION: In summary, these findings indicate that tropisetron exhibits an 
anti-epileptic effect and provides neuroprotection in TLE rats through the 
activation of α7nAChRs. The potential mechanism may involve the reduction of 
glutamate levels, enhancement of cholinergic transmission, and suppression of 
synaptic remodeling. Consequently, the present study not only highlights the 
potential of tropisetron as an anti-epileptic drug but also identifies α7nAChRs 
as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of TLE.

Understanding the dynamic assembly process of amyloid β (Aβ) during fibril 
formation is essential for developing effective therapeutic strategies against 
Alzheimer's disease. Here, we employed high-speed atomic force microscopy to 
observe the growth of Aβ fibrils at the single-molecule level, focusing 
specifically on their interaction with anti-Aβ antibodies. Our findings show 
that fibril growth consists of intermittent periods of elongation and pausing, 
which are dictated by the alternating addition of Aβ monomers to protofilaments. 
We highlight the distinctive interaction of antibody 4396C, which specifically 
binds to the fibril ends in the paused state, suggesting a unique mechanism to 
hinder fibril elongation. Through real-time visualization of fibril growth and 
antibody interactions combined with molecular simulation, this study provides a 
refined understanding of Aβ assembly during fibril formation and suggests novel 
strategies for Alzheimer's therapy aimed at inhibiting the fibril elongation.

INTRODUCTION: Emerging preclinical evidence suggests that semaglutide, a 
glucagon-like peptide receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) for type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(T2DM) and obesity, protects against neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. 
However, real-world evidence for its ability to protect against Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) is lacking.
METHODS: We conducted emulation target trials based on a nationwide database of 
electronic health records (EHRs) of 116 million US patients. Seven target trials 
were emulated among 1,094,761 eligible patients with T2DM who had no prior AD 
diagnosis by comparing semaglutide with seven other antidiabetic medications. 
First-ever diagnosis of AD occurred within a 3-year follow-up period and was 
examined using Cox proportional hazards and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses.
RESULTS: Semaglutide was associated with significantly reduced risk for 
first-time AD diagnosis, most strongly compared with insulin (hazard ratio [HR], 
0.33 [95% CI: 0.21 to 0.51]) and most weakly compared with other GLP-1RAs (HR, 
0.59 [95% CI: 0.37 to 0.95]). Similar results were seen across obesity status, 
gender, and age groups.
DISCUSSION: These findings support further studies to assess semaglutide's 
potential in preventing AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: Semaglutide was associated with 40% to 70% reduced risks of 
first-time AD diagnosis in T2DM patients compared to other antidiabetic 
medications, including other GLP-1RAs. Semaglutide was associated with 
significantly lower AD-related medication prescriptions. Similar reductions were 
seen across obesity status, gender, and age groups. Our findings provide 
real-world evidence supporting the potential clinical benefits of semaglutide in 
mitigating AD initiation and development in patients with T2DM. These findings 
support further clinical trials to assess semaglutide's potential in delaying or 
preventing AD.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe neurological illness causes 
cognitive decline and mortality if not treated early. However, the current 
therapeutic modalities are inefficient to manage the cognitive dysfunction of 
AD. Therefore, in the present manuscript, we have enumerated the pharmacological 
benefit of Poliumoside in the Streptozotocin-induced cognitive dysfunction in 
Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Initially, the cognitive dysfunction in rats was induced 
by the intracerebroventricular administration of Streptozotocin, then rats 
received PMD (5 mg and 10 mg/kg body weight) was given. Various behavioural 
analysis, such as Morris water maze (MWM), and object recognition tests (ORT), 
and locomotor analysis was conducted in PMD treated group. Various biochemical 
analysis was conducted to analyze the effect of PMD on hippocampus 
oxidative-nitrosative stress and pro-inflammatory cytokines. MTT assay and 
annexin V/PI staining was performed to analyse the effect of PMD on the cell 
viability and neuronal toxicity of PC12 cells, respectively. Molecular docking 
analysis was also conducted with crystal structure of human AChE.
RESULTS: PMD treatment improved cognitive capacity in rats in MWM and ORT. 
Compared to STZ rats, PMD-treated rats had significantly higher locomotor 
activity and lower AChE activity. PMD also restores dopamine, 5-HT, and NE 
levels and reduces metabolic their deactivation as evidenced by increased levels 
of DOPAC, HVA, 5-HIAA. Nitrite, MDA, SOD, CAT, and GSH levels were restored near 
normal in PMD-treated rats, reducing hippocampus oxidative-nitrosative stress. 
Pro-inflammatory cytokines were similarly lowered in PMD-treated rats. In 
in-vitro studies, PMD did not affect PC12 cell survival at the maximal dose of 
10 µM. In addition, PMD concentration-dependently prevents H₂O₂-induced neuronal 
death in PC12 cells. The in-silico docking analysis showed that the PMD fit 
snugly into the active site of human AChE by engaging with the anionic domain 
and the catalytic triad of Trp86, Tyr337, Phe338, and Gly121 residues.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our study demonstrated that PMD have significant 
impact on AD by inhibiting ACheE and restoring neurotransmitter levels, which 
enhances Ach levels in rats and improves cognitive impairment in STZ rats.

Amyloidogenic transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis is a relentlessly progressive 
disease caused by the misfolding and systemic accumulation of amyloidogenic 
transthyretin into amyloid fibrils. These fibrils cause diverse clinical 
phenotypes, mainly cardiomyopathy and/or polyneuropathy. Little is known about 
the aggregation of transthyretin during disease development and whether this has 
implications for diagnosis and treatment. Using the cryogenic electron 
microscopy structures of mature ATTR fibrils, we developed a peptide probe for 
fibril detection. With this probe, we have identified previously unknown 
aggregated transthyretin species in plasma of patients with ATTR amyloidosis. 
These species are large, non-native, and distinct from monomeric and tetrameric 
transthyretin. Observations from our study open many questions about the biology 
of ATTR amyloidosis and reveal a potential diagnostic and therapeutic target.

amyloidosis is an under-recognized cause of heart failure due to lack of tools 
that can effectively distinguish between native and amyloidogenic transthyretin. 
Using structures of mature ATTR fibrils derived from patient tissue, we have 
developed a novel detection probe that addresses this unmet need. This probe not 
only binds ATTR fibrils with high affinity, but also large ATTR aggregates in 
plasma of patients with ATTR amyloidosis. TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Combined with 
previous results, our data unveils a novel biomarker for cardiac ATTR 
amyloidosis that has the potential to be exploited as a novel diagnostic and/or 
therapeutic target. Our results may be leveraged to develop a screening tool 
using blood samples to identify disease onset earlier than the current 
diagnostic standard. This will enable timely treatment, improve patient 
prognosis, and reduce burden on the health care system.

OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aims to comprehensively analyze the efficacy 
and underlying mechanisms of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) in enhancing 
cognitive functions and its therapeutic potential for various cognitive 
impairments. The review focuses on the impact of VNS on emotional processing, 
executive functions, learning, memory, and its clinical applications in 
conditions such as epilepsy, depression, Alzheimer's disease, and other 
neurological disorders.
METHODS: A systematic search of electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of 
Science) was conducted using the keywords "vagus nerve stimulation," "cognitive 
enhancement," "emotional processing," "executive function," "learning and 
memory," "epilepsy," "depression," "Alzheimer's disease," "neurological 
disorders," "attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder," "sleep disorders," and 
"long COVID." The inclusion criteria encompassed controlled trials, longitudinal 
studies, and meta-analyses published in English between 2000 and July 2024.
RESULTS: A comprehensive review of 100 articles highlighted the cognitive 
effects of Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS). Studies show that VNS, especially 
through transcutaneous auricular VNS (taVNS), enhances emotional recognition, 
particularly for facial expressions, and improves selective attention under high 
cognitive demands. Additionally, VNS enhances learning and memory, including 
associative memory and spatial working memory tasks. In clinical applications, 
VNS exhibits promising benefits for improving cognitive functions in 
treatment-resistant epilepsy, depression, and Alzheimer's disease.
CONCLUSION: VNS represents a promising therapeutic approach for enhancing 
cognitive function across diverse patient populations. The reviewed evidence 
highlights its efficacy in modulating cognitive domains in healthy individuals 
and improving cognition in neurological conditions. However, the comparative 
effectiveness of different VNS modalities and the differential effects of online 
versus offline VNS on cognitive psychology require further investigation. Future 
research should focus on optimizing VNS protocols and elucidating specific 
cognitive domains that benefit most from VNS interventions. This ongoing 
exploration is essential for maximizing the therapeutic potential of VNS in 
clinical practice.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated inflammatory and degenerative 
disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) with heterogeneous clinical 
manifestations. In the last decade, the landscape of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
and blood biomarkers as potential key tools for MS diagnosis, prognosis and 
treatment monitoring has evolved considerably, alongside magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI). CSF analysis has the potential not only to provide information on 
the underlying immunopathology of the disease and exclude differential 
diagnoses, but also to predict the risk of future relapses and disability 
accrual, guide therapeutic decisions and thus improve patient outcomes. This 
Series article overviews the biological framework and current applicability of 
fluid biomarkers for MS, exploring their potential role in the molecular 
characterisation of the disease. We discuss recent advances in the field of 
neurochemistry that enabled the detection of brain-derived proteins in blood, 
opening the door to much more efficient longitudinal disease monitoring. 
Furthermore, we identify the current challenges in the application of fluid 
biomarkers for MS in a real-world setting, while offering recommendations for 
harnessing their full potential as key paraclinical tools to improve patient 
management and personalise treatment.

BACKGROUND: A major goal of the Target Enablement to Accelerate Therapy 
Development for Alzheimer's disease (TREAT-AD) program is to develop and 
identify high-quality tools to test target or mechanistic hypotheses. As part of 
this initiative, it is important that commercial reagents including research 
antibodies being used to interrogate drug targets have confirmed validation data 
in knock-out cell lines. Ideally, these antibodies should also have utility for 
both in vitro and in vivo studies such that the levels of target proteins in 
target tissues can be quantified.
METHODS: We evaluated commercial antibodies against TREAT-AD protein targets 
Moesin (Uniprot ID: P26038), CD44 (Uniprot ID: P16070), Midkine (Uniprot ID: 
P21741) and Secreted frizzled-related protein 1, referred to as "sFRP-1" 
(sFRP-1; Uniprot ID: Q8N474). Moesin, Midkine and sFRP-1, that were confirmed as 
selective based on data in knock-out cell lines. Western blot analysis was used 
to compare protein levels in brain homogenates from a mouse model with 
AD-relevant pathology (5XFAD) versus age-matched C57BL/6J control mice.
RESULTS: Anti-Moesin ab52490 reacted in mouse brain homogenate with a predicted 
molecular weight of 68 kDa. Moesin protein expression was 2.8 times higher in 
5xFAD compared to WT. Anti-CD44 ab189524 reacted with a band at the predicted 
size of 82 kDa. CD44 protein expression was 1.9 times higher in 5xFAD compared 
to WT. Anti-Midkine AF7769 reacted with a band ~16 kDa and a 17.8 times greater 
expression in 5xFAD compared to WT. Anti-sFRP-1 ab267466 reacted with a band at 
35 kDa as predicted. sFRP-1 protein expression was 11.9 times greater in 5xFAD 
compared to WT.
CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm the utility of these selective commercially 
available antibodies against Moesin, CD44, Midkine, and sFRP-1 for in vivo 
studies in mice and provide insight into the use of 5XFAD mice for in vivo 
target engagement studies for these target proteins.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative condition that 
affects memory and cognition, characterized by neuronal loss and currently 
lacking a cure. Mutations in PSEN1 (Presenilin 1) are among the most common 
causes of early-onset familial AD (fAD). While changes in neuronal excitability 
are believed to be early indicators of AD progression, the link between PSEN1 
mutations and neuronal excitability remains to be fully elucidated. This study 
examined iPSC-derived neurons (iNs) from fAD patients with PSEN1 mutations S290C 
or A246E, alongside CRISPR-corrected isogenic cell lines, to investigate early 
changes in excitability. Electrophysiological profiling revealed reduced 
excitability in both PSEN1 mutant iNs compared to their isogenic controls. 
Neurons bearing S290C and A246E mutations exhibited divergent passive membrane 
properties compared to isogenic controls, suggesting distinct effects of PSEN1 
mutations on neuronal excitability. Additionally, both PSEN1 backgrounds 
exhibited higher current density of voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels 
relative to their isogenic iNs, while displaying comparable voltage-gated sodium 
(Nav) channel current density. This suggests that the Nav/Kv imbalance 
contributes to impaired neuronal firing in fAD iNs. Deciphering these early 
cellular and molecular changes in AD is crucial for understanding disease 
pathogenesis.

Study designs incorporate interim analyses to allow for modifications to the 
trial design. These analyses may aid decisions regarding sample size, futility, 
and safety. Furthermore, they may provide evidence about potential differences 
between treatment arms. Bayesian response adaptive randomization (RAR) skews 
allocation proportions such that fewer participants are assigned to the inferior 
treatments. However, these allocation changes may introduce covariate 
imbalances. We discuss two versions of Bayesian RAR (with and without covariate 
adjustment for a binary covariate) for continuous outcomes analyzed using change 
scores and repeated measures, while considering either regression or mixed 
models for interim analysis modeling. Through simulation studies, we show that 
RAR (both versions) allocates more participants to better treatments compared to 
equal randomization, while reducing potential covariate imbalances. We also show 
that dynamic allocation using mixed models for repeated measures yields a 
smaller allocation proportion variance while having a similar covariate 
imbalance as regression models. Additionally, covariate imbalance was smallest 
for methods using covariate-adjusted RAR (CARA) in scenarios with small sample 
sizes and covariate prevalence less than 0.3. Covariate imbalance did not differ 
between RAR and CARA in simulations with larger sample sizes and higher 
covariate prevalence. We thus recommend a CARA approach for small 
pilot/exploratory studies for the identification of candidate treatments for 
further confirmatory studies.

BACKGROUND: Variants of the gene triggering receptor expressed on myeloid 
cells-2 (TREM2) increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other 
neurodegenerative disorders. Signaling by TREM2, an innate immune receptor 
expressed by microglia, is thought to enhance phagocytosis of amyloid beta (Aβ) 
and other damaged proteins, promote microglial proliferation, migration, and 
survival, and regulate inflammatory signaling. Thus, TREM2 activation has 
potential to alter the progression of AD. AL002 is an investigational, 
engineered, humanized monoclonal immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibody designed to 
target TREM2. In AD mouse models, an AL002 murine variant has been previously 
shown to induce microglial proliferation and reduce filamentous Aβ plaques and 
neurite dystrophy.
METHODS: Preclinical studies assessed the safety, tolerability, 
pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of AL002 in cynomolgus monkeys. INVOKE-1 
(NCT03635047) was a first-in-human phase 1, randomized, placebo-controlled, 
double-blind study assessing the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of AL002 
administered as single ascending doses (SAD) in healthy volunteers.
RESULTS: In cynomolgus monkeys, weekly intravenous injections of AL002 for 4 
weeks were well tolerated, dose-dependently decreased soluble TREM2 (sTREM2) in 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and total TREM2 in hippocampus and frontal cortex, and 
increased biomarkers of TREM2 signaling in CSF and brain. In the phase 1 study 
of 64 healthy volunteers, a single intravenous infusion of AL002 demonstrated 
brain target engagement based on a dose-dependent reduction of sTREM2 in CSF and 
parallel increases in biomarkers of TREM2 signaling and microglia recruitment. 
Single-dose AL002 showed central nervous system penetrance and was well 
tolerated, with no treatment-related serious adverse events over 12 weeks.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the continued clinical development of AL002 
for AD and other neurodegenerative diseases in which TREM2 activation may be 
beneficial. AL002 is currently being tested in a phase 2, randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled study in early AD.

Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is a risk factor for Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). Multi-domain cognitive training (CT) may slow cognitive decline 
and delay AD onset. However, most work involves short interventions, targeting 
single cognitive domains or lacking active controls. We conducted a single-blind 
randomized controlled trial to investigate the effect of a 6-month, multi-domain 
CT on Fluid Cognition, functional connectivity in memory and executive 
functioning networks (primary outcomes), and white matter microstructural 
properties (secondary outcome) in aMCI. Sixty participants were randomly 
assigned to either a multi-domain CT or crossword training (CW) group, and 
thirty-four participants completed the intervention. We found a significant 
group-by-time interaction in Fluid Cognition (p = 0.007, F (1,28) = 8.26, 
Cohen's d = 0.38, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.45-14.4), with 90% of CT 
patients showing post-intervention improvements (p < 0.01, Cohen's d = 0.7). The 
CT group also showed better post-intervention Fluid Cognition than healthy 
controls (HCs, N = 45, p = 0.045). Functional connectivity analyses showed a 
significant group-by-time interaction (Cohen's d ≥ 0.8) in the dorsolateral 
prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and inferior parietal cortex (IPC) networks. 
Specifically, CT displayed post-intervention increases whereas CW displayed 
decreases in functional connectivity. Moreover, increased connectivity strength 
between the left DLPFC and medial PFC was associated with improved Fluid 
Cognition. At a microstructural level, we observed a decline in fiber density 
(FD) for both groups, but the CT group declined less steeply (1.3 vs. 2%). The 
slower decline in FD for the CT group in several tracts, including the 
cingulum-hippocampus tract, was associated with better working memory. Finally, 
we identified regions in cognitive control and memory networks for which 
baseline functional connectivity and microstructural properties were associated 
with changes in Fluid Cognition. Long-term, multi-domain CT improves cognitive 
functioning and functional connectivity and delays structural brain decline in 
aMCI (ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT03883308).

Neuroinflammation is a critical component in neurodegenerative disorders. The 
inflammasome, facilitates the cleavage of caspase-1, leading to the maturation 
and subsequent secretion of inflammatory factors interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18. 
Consequently, pyroptosis mediated by gasdermin D, exacerbates neuroinflammation. 
Among the inflammasomes, NLRP1/3 are predominant in the central nervous system 
(CNS), Although NLRP1 was the earliest discovered inflammasome, the specific 
involvement of NLRP1 in neurodegenerative diseases remains to be fully 
elucidated. Recently, the discovery of an endogenous inhibitor of NLRP1, 
dipeptidyl peptidase 9, suggests the feasibility of producing of small-molecule 
drugs targeting NLRP1. This review describes the latest findings on the role of 
the NLRP1 inflammasome in the pathology of neurodegenerative disorders, 
including Alzheimer's disease, and summarises the regulatory mechanisms of NLRP1 
inflammasome activation in the CNS. Furthermore, we highlight the recent 
progress in developing small-molecule and biological inhibitors that modulate 
the NLRP1 infammasome for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders, some of 
which are advancing to preclinical testing. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The 
objective of this review is to synthesise the research on the structure, 
activation, and regulatory mechanisms of the NLRP1 inflammasome, along with its 
potential impact on both acute and chronic neurodegenerative conditions. The 
discovery of endogenous inhibitors, such as dipeptidyl peptidase 9 and 
thioredoxin, and their interaction with NLRP1 suggest the possibility of 
developing NLRP1-targeted small-molecule drugs for the treatment of 
neurodegenerative disorders. This review also discusses the use of both direct 
and indirect NLRP1 inhibitors as prospective therapeutic strategies for these 
conditions.

After a number of failed drug studies on Alzheimer's disease (AD) over the past 
decade, clinical trials of AD started to show encouraging results and were 
approved or pending approval for clinical use. However, controversies on the 
clinically meaningful benefits and risks of brain edema and microhemorrhages 
have reminded us to think further about monitoring treatment and developing new 
drug targets. The goal of this review is to find insights from clinical trials 
that aimed at two key pathological features of AD, i.e., amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau 
protein, and to explore other targets such as anti-inflammation in AD. The 
complex pathophysiology of AD may require combination therapies rather than 
monotherapy. Throughout the course of AD, multiple pathways are disrupted, 
presenting a multitude of possible therapeutic targets for designing prevention 
and intervention for AD.

We aimed to prepare novel dibenzo [a,d][7]annulen derivatives that act on 
N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors with potential neuroprotective effects. 
Our approach involved modifying the tropane moiety of MK-801, a potent 
open-channel blocker known for its psychomimetic side effects, by introducing a 
seven-membered ring with substituted base moieties specifically to alleviate 
these undesirable effects. Our in silico analyses showed that these derivatives 
should have high gastrointestinal absorption and cross the blood-brain barrier 
(BBB). Our pharmacokinetic studies in rats supported this conclusion and 
confirmed the ability of leading compounds 3l and 6f to penetrate the BBB. 
Electrophysiological experiments showed that all compounds exhibited different 
inhibitory activity towards the two major NMDA receptor subtypes, GluN1/GluN2A 
and GluN1/GluN2B. Of the selected compounds intentionally differing in the 
inhibitory efficacy, 6f showed high relative inhibition (∼90 % for 
GluN1/GluN2A), while 3l showed moderate inhibition (∼50 %). An in vivo toxicity 
study determined that compounds 3l and 6f were safe at 10 mg/kg doses with no 
adverse effects. Behavioral studies demonstrated that these compounds did not 
induce hyperlocomotion or impair prepulse inhibition of startle response in 
rats. Neuroprotective assays using a model of NMDA-induced hippocampal 
neurodegeneration showed that compound 3l at a concentration of 30 μM 
significantly reduced hippocampal damage in rats. These results suggest that 
these novel dibenzo [a,d][7]annulen derivatives are promising candidates for 
developing NMDA receptor-targeted therapies with minimal psychotomimetic side 
effects.

Working memory for nonverbal auditory information is essential for everyday 
functioning but its cognitive organisation is not well understood. Here we 
addressed this issue in a musician, YA, with absolute pitch (AP, the uncommon 
ability to categorise and label individual musical pitches without an external 
reference) who developed posterior cortical atrophy. We assessed YA's AP ability 
and her working memory for pitch and rhythmic patterns using procedures modelled 
on a standard test of auditory verbal working memory (digit span), referenced to 
age-matched, cognitively-normal AP and non-AP possessing musicians. YA had 
retained AP and performed comparably to healthy older AP and non-AP musicians on 
all musical working memory tasks, despite impaired auditory verbal working 
memory. These findings suggest that the cognitive mechanisms for auditory verbal 
working memory, nonverbal (pitch and rhythm) working memory and AP are at least 
partly dissociable, and both musical working memory and AP can be spared despite 
posterior parietal degeneration.

Sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) are a series of 
cholesterol-related transcription factors. Their role in regulating brain 
cholesterol biosynthesis, amyloid accumulation, and tau tangles formation has 
been intensively studied in protein-protein interaction analysis based on genes 
in clinical databases. SREBPs play an important role in maintaining cholesterol 
homeostasis in the brain. There are three subtypes of SREBPs, SREBP-1a 
stimulates the expression of genes related to cholesterol and fatty acid 
synthesis, SREBP-1c stimulates adipogenesis, and SREBP-2 stimulates cholesterol 
synthase and LDL receptors. SREBP-2 is activated in response to cholesterol 
depletion and stimulates a compensatory upregulation of cholesterol uptake and 
synthesis. Previous studies have shown that inhibition of SREBP-2 reduces 
cholesterol and amyloid accumulation, and new research suggests that SREBPs play 
a multifaceted role in Alzheimer's disease. Here, we highlight the importance of 
SREBPs in AD, in terms of multiple pathways regulating cholesterol in the brain, 
and primarily demonstrate the potential of SREBP-2 inhibitors. There was a trend 
towards a significant increase in the expression levels of different SREBP 
isoforms in AD patients compared to healthy controls. Therefore, there is a 
close link between SREBPs and AD, and this review analyses the potential role of 
SREBPs in the treatment of AD. In addition, we systematically reviewed the 
research progress of SREBPs in AD, and this review will provide more innovative 
insights into the pathogenesis and treatment of AD and new strategies for drug 
development in AD.

BACKGROUND: The use of digital biomarkers through remote patient monitoring 
offers valuable and timely insights into a patient's condition, including 
aspects such as disease progression and treatment response. This serves as a 
complementary resource to traditional health care settings leveraging mobile 
technology to improve scale and lower latency, cost, and burden.
OBJECTIVE: Smartphones with embedded and connected sensors have immense 
potential for improving health care through various apps and mobile health 
(mHealth) platforms. This capability could enable the development of reliable 
digital biomarkers from long-term longitudinal data collected remotely from 
patients.
METHODS: We built an open-source platform, RADAR-base, to support large-scale 
data collection in remote monitoring studies. RADAR-base is a modern remote data 
collection platform built around Confluent's Apache Kafka to support 
scalability, extensibility, security, privacy, and quality of data. It provides 
support for study design and setup and active (eg, patient-reported outcome 
measures) and passive (eg, phone sensors, wearable devices, and Internet of 
Things) remote data collection capabilities with feature generation (eg, 
behavioral, environmental, and physiological markers). The back end enables 
secure data transmission and scalable solutions for data storage, management, 
and data access.
RESULTS: The platform has been used to successfully collect longitudinal data 
for various cohorts in a number of disease areas including multiple sclerosis, 
depression, epilepsy, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, Alzheimer 
disease, autism, and lung diseases. Digital biomarkers developed through 
collected data are providing useful insights into different diseases.
CONCLUSIONS: RADAR-base offers a contemporary, open-source solution driven by 
the community for remotely monitoring, collecting data, and digitally 
characterizing both physical and mental health conditions. Clinicians have the 
ability to enhance their insight through the use of digital biomarkers, enabling 
improved prevention, personalization, and early intervention in the context of 
disease management.

We studied the effect of NF-κB blockade on the state of various pools of 
progenitor cells of the nervous tissue and the psychoneurological status of 
experimental animals with modeled Alzheimer's disease. Administration of 
scopolamine hydrobromide to C57BL/6 mice for 4 weeks was accompanied by the 
development of "persistent" disturbances in the orientation and exploratory 
behavior and mnestic function. An ameliorating effect of the NF-κB inhibitor on 
these cognitive disorders typical of senile dementia was revealed. At the same 
time, we observed an increase in the content of neural stem cells and committed 
neuronal precursors in the subventricular zone of the brain.

OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the neuroprotective effect of ferulic acid 
(FA) against bisphenol A (BPA) induced Alzheimer's disease-like pathology in 
male rats.
METHODS: Rats were allocated into four groups, control, BPA, BPA + FA, and FA, 
respectively, for 40 days. Spatial working memory and recognition memory were 
evaluated. Moreover, the brain levels of oxidative stress biomarkers, 
proinflammatory cytokines, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and 
phosphorylated serine/threonine protein kinase (p-Akt) were measured. We also 
determined the brain neuropathological protein levels, including Beta-Amyloid 
1-42, total Tau (tTau), and phosphorylated Tau (pTau) proteins. Furthermore, 
brain levels of Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and Beta-secretase (BACE) were 
assessed. Brain histological investigation and immunohistochemistry 
determination of glial fibrillar acidic protein (GFAP) were also performed. 
Moreover, docking simulation was adapted to understand the inhibitory role of FA 
on AChE, BACE-1, and ERK1/2.
RESULTS: Interestingly, the BPA + FA treated group showed a reversal in the 
cognitive impairments induced by BPA, which was associated with improved brain 
redox status. They also exhibited a significant decrease in brain inflammatory 
cytokines, ERK, and p-Akt levels. Moreover, they revealed a decline in 
beta-amyloid 1-42 and a significant improvement in tTau expression and pTau 
protein levels in the brain tissue. Further, the brain levels of AChE and BACE 
were substantially reduced in BPA + FA rats. The neuroprotective effect of FA 
was confirmed by restoring the normal architecture of brain tissue, which was 
associated with decreasing GFAP.
CONCLUSION: FA could be a potent neuroprotectant agent against AD with a 
possible prospect for its therapeutic capabilities and nutritional supplement 
value due to its antioxidant and antiapoptotic properties.

The neurotoxicant trimethyltin (TMT) triggers cognitive impairment and 
hippocampal neurodegeneration. TMT is a useful research tool for the study of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis and treatment. Although the antidiabetic 
agent metformin has shown promising neuroprotective effects, however, its 
precise modes of action in neurodegenerative disorders need to be further 
elucidated. In this study, we investigated whether metformin can mitigate TMT 
cognition impairment and hippocampal neurodegeneration. To induce an AD-like 
phenotype, TMT was injected i.p. (8 mg/kg) and metformin was administered daily 
p.o. for 3 weeks at 200 mg/kg. Our results showed that metformin administration 
to the TMT group mitigated learning and memory impairment in Barnes maze, novel 
object recognition (NOR) task, and Y maze, attenuated hippocampal oxidative, 
inflammatory, and cell death/pyroptotic factors, and also reversed 
neurodegeneration-related proteins such as presenilin 1 and p-Tau. Hippocampal 
level of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) as a key regulator of energy 
homeostasis was also improved following metformin treatment. Additionally, 
metformin reduced hippocampal acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, glial 
fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive reactivity, and prevented the loss of 
CA1 pyramidal neurons. This study showed that metformin mitigated TMT-induced 
neurodegeneration and this may pave the way to develop new therapeutics to 
combat against cognitive deficits under neurotoxic conditions.

The development of monoclonal anti-amyloid antibodies, a disease-modifying 
treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD), has raised the necessity to identify the 
epidemiological profile of the possible target patients who would benefit from 
such therapy. These are patients in the early stages of AD with 
biomarker-confirmed brain amyloid positivity. In this study, the epidemiological 
profile of possible target patients in Austria and Vienna was estimated. The 
number of patients in the stage of amyloid-beta (Aβ)-positive prodromal AD in 
Austria and Vienna are 193,500 and 34,700 patients, respectively. The expected 
patient demand for the upcoming therapy in Austria and Vienna are 61,200 and 
11,100 patients, respectively.In the memory clinic of the Vienna General 
Hospital, the number of treatment-eligible patients for an upcoming anti-amyloid 
antibody was on average 52.8 patients per year, which is about 10% of the total 
number of patients visiting the memory clinic every year. Several challenges to 
provide therapy to the general population include expanding the MCI screening in 
primary care and increasing the capacity of the healthcare system for biomarker 
testing, infusion delivery, and ARIA management. The study primarily addresses 
the status quo of identifying patients on memory clinics through cognitive 
screening and biomarker testing.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder and cause 
of dementia. Despite the prevalence of AD, there is a lack of effective disease 
modifying therapies. Recent evidence indicates that the gut microbiome (GMB) may 
play a role in AD through its regulation of innate and adaptive immunity. Gut 
microbes regulate physiology through their production of metabolites and 
byproducts. Microbial metabolites may be beneficial or detrimental to the 
pathogenesis and progression of inflammatory diseases. A better understanding of 
the role GMB-derived metabolites play in AD may lead to the development of 
therapeutic strategies for AD. In this review, we summarize the function of 
bioactive GMB-derived metabolites and byproducts and their roles in AD models. 
We also call for more focus on this area in the gut-brain axis field in order to 
create effective therapies for AD.
