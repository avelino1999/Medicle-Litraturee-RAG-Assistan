The major vascular cause of dementia is cerebral small vessel disease (SVD). Its 
diagnosis relies on imaging hallmarks, such as white matter hyperintensities 
(WMH). WMH present a heterogenous pathology, including myelin and axonal loss. 
Yet, these might be only the "tip of the iceberg." Imaging modalities imply that 
microstructural alterations underlie still normal-appearing white matter (NAWM), 
preceding the conversion to WMH. Unfortunately, direct pathological 
characterization of these microstructural alterations affecting myelinated 
axonal fibers in WMH, and especially NAWM, is still missing. Given that there 
are no treatments to significantly reduce WMH progression, it is important to 
extend our knowledge on pathological processes that might already be occurring 
within NAWM. Staining of myelin with Luxol Fast Blue, while valuable, fails to 
assess subtle alterations in white matter microstructure. Therefore, we aimed to 
quantify myelin surrounding axonal fibers and axonal- and microstructural damage 
in detail by combining (immuno)histochemistry with polarized light imaging 
(PLI). To study the extent (of early) microstructural damage from 
periventricular NAWM to the center of WMH, we refined current analysis 
techniques by using deep learning to define smaller segments of white matter, 
capturing increasing fluid-attenuated inversion recovery signal. Integration of 
(immuno)histochemistry and PLI with post-mortem imaging of the brains of 
individuals with hypertension and normotensive controls enables voxel-wise 
assessment of the pathology throughout periventricular WMH and NAWM. Myelin 
loss, axonal integrity, and white matter microstructural damage are not limited 
to WMH but already occur within NAWM. Notably, we found that axonal damage is 
higher in individuals with hypertension, particularly in NAWM. These findings 
highlight the added value of advanced segmentation techniques to visualize 
subtle changes occurring already in NAWM preceding WMH. By using quantitative 
MRI and advanced diffusion MRI, future studies may elucidate these very early 
mechanisms leading to neurodegeneration, which ultimately contribute to the 
conversion of NAWM to WMH.

Recent advances in development of amyloid-targeting therapies support the 
potential to slow the rate of progression of Alzheimer's disease. We conducted a 
narrative review of published evidence identified through a targeted search of 
the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases (2020-2023), recent presentations at 
disease-specific conferences, and data updates from cohort studies in 
Alzheimer's disease to describe the trajectory of the progression of Alzheimer's 
disease. Our findings enable the interpretation of clinical trial results and 
the value associated with slowing disease progression across outcomes of 
relevance to patients, care partners, clinicians, researchers and policymakers. 
Even at the earliest stages, Alzheimer's disease imposes a substantial burden on 
individuals, care partners, and healthcare systems. The magnitude of the burden 
increases with the rate of disease progression and symptom severity, as 
worsening cognitive decline and physical impairment result in loss of functional 
independence. Data from cohort studies also indicate that slowing disease 
progression is associated with decreased likelihood of needing extensive 
clinical care over at least 5 years, decreased care partner burden, and 
substantial individual and societal cost savings. Slowed disease progression is 
of significant benefit to individuals with Alzheimer's disease, their loved 
ones, and the healthcare system. As clinicians and policymakers devise 
strategies to improve access to treatment earlier in the disease spectrum, they 
should carefully weigh the benefits of slowing progression early in the disease 
(e.g. preservation of cognitive and functional abilities, as well as relative 
independence) to individuals, their loved ones, and broader society.

INTRODUCTION: We used clinical assessment records to provide pan-Canadian 
estimates of the prevalence and risks associated with recent (within the last 3 
days) critical wandering among home care clients, with and without dementia.
METHODS: The data source is interRAI Home Care (interRAI HC) assessments. The 
population was all long-stay home care clients assessed between 2004 and 2021 in 
seven Canadian provinces and territories (N = 1,598,191). We tested associations 
between wandering and cognition and dementia diagnoses using chi-square tests 
and logistic regression.
RESULTS: Approximately 84% of the sample was over the age of 65. The overall 
rate of recent wandering was 3.0%. Dementia diagnosis was strongly associated 
with two to four times higher rates in the prevalence of recent critical 
wandering.
DISCUSSION: InterRAI HC offers insights into the wandering risk of home care 
clients. This information should be used to manage risks in the community and 
could be shared with first responders.
HIGHLIGHTS: In all the study regions combined, the rate of recent wandering is 
3.0%. Dementia was associated with 18 times greater prevalence of recent 
critical wandering. Home care clients at risk of wandering have complex clinical 
profiles that pose important risks for their health and well-being. 
Collaboration and information sharing between search and rescue and health 
professions is essential for managing risks related to critical wandering.

INTRODUCTION: Vacuolar Protein Sorting 35 (VPS35) is pivotal in the retromer 
complex, governing transmembrane protein trafficking within cells, and its 
dysfunction is implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. A missense mutation, 
Asp620Asn (D620N), specifically ties to familial late-onset Parkinson's, while 
reduced VPS35 levels are observed in Alzheimer's, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
(ALS), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and tauopathies. VPS35's absence in 
certain neurons during development can initiate neurodegeneration, highlighting 
its necessity for neural health. Present therapeutic research mainly targets the 
clearance of harmful protein aggregates and symptom management. Innovative 
treatments focusing on VPS35 are under investigation, although fully 
understanding the mechanisms and optimal targeting strategies remain a 
challenge.
AREAS COVERED: This review offers a detailed account of VPS35's discovery, its 
role in neurodegenerative mechanisms - especially in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's 
- and its link to other disorders. It shines alight on recent insights into 
VPS35's function in development, disease, and as a therapeutic target.
EXPERT OPINION: VPS35 is integral to cellular function and disease association, 
making it a significant candidate for developing therapies. Progress in 
modulating VPS35's activity may lead to breakthrough treatments that not only 
slow disease progression but may also act as biomarkers for neurodegeneration 
risk, marking a step forward in managing these complex conditions.

Synaptic dysfunction is an early feature in Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
pathogenesis and a major morphological correlate of memory deficits. Given the 
main synaptic location of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), their 
dysregulation has been implicated in these pathological effects. Here, to detect 
possible alterations in the expression and synaptic localisation of the GluN1 
subunit in the brain of amyloidogenic APP/PS1 mice, we employed histoblot and 
SDS-digested freeze-fracture replica labelling (SDS-FRL) techniques. Histoblots 
showed that GluN1 expression was significantly reduced in the hippocampus in a 
layer-dependent manner, in the cortex and the caudate putamen of APP/PS1 
transgenic mice at 12 months of age but was unaltered at 1 and 6 months. Using 
quantitative SDS-FRL, we unravelled the molecular organisation of GluN1 in seven 
excitatory synapse populations at a high spatial resolution in the CA1 and CA3 
fields and the DG of the hippocampus in 12-month-old APP/PS1 mice. In the CA1 
field, the labelling density for GluN1 in the excitatory synapses established on 
spines and interneurons, was significantly reduced in APP/PS1 mice compared to 
age-matched wild-type mice in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare but unaltered in 
the stratum radiatum. In the CA3 field, synaptic GluN1 was reduced in mossy 
fibre-CA3 pyramidal cell synapses but unaltered in the A/C-CA3 pyramidal cell 
synapses. In the DG, the density of GluN1 in granule cell-perforant pathway 
synapses was reduced in APP/PS1 mice. Altogether, our findings provide evidence 
of specific alterations of synaptic GluN1 in the trisynaptic circuit of the 
hippocampus in Aβ pathology. This differential vulnerability in the disruption 
of NMDARs may be involved in the mechanisms causing abnormal network activity of 
the hippocampal circuit and cognitive impairment characteristic of APP/PS1 mice.

PURPOSE: Many patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) also have psychosis, and it 
has been reported that these patients have more severely impaired cognitive 
functions than patients without psychosis. The glutamatergic system in the brain 
is known to play an important role in memory and learning in the neural 
circuits. However, there has been limited research on how antipsychotic drugs 
affect the glutamatergic system of AD. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the 
effects of aripiprazole on the glutamatergic system in an animal model of AD 
using functional molecular imaging.
PROCEDURES: In this study, 5xFAD mice were used as the animal model. At the age 
of 5 months, the mice were divided into wild-type, vehicle control, and 
aripiprazole-treated groups (n = 6 per group). The aripiprazole-treated group 
was administered aripiprazole for 2 months at a dose of 1 mg·kg-1·day-1. At 
7 months of age, the animals underwent behavioral tests and glutamate positron 
emission tomography (PET) scans.
RESULTS: The aripiprazole-treated group exhibited alleviated memory impairment 
in a novel object recognition test. Moreover, this group displayed 7-8% higher 
binding in the glutamate PET scan than the vehicle-treated 5xFAD group. 
Postmortem examination confirmed the recovery of glutamatergic damage.
CONCLUSIONS: The administration of aripiprazole alleviated memory impairment and 
restored the damaged glutamatergic system in 5xFAD mice. Although the use of 
aripiprazole in AD patients may be a constraint in terms of safety, we confirmed 
the possibility that the administration of antipsychotic drugs can be effective 
in AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) stands as the predominant form of dementia, presenting 
significant and escalating global challenges. Its etiology is intricate and 
diverse, stemming from a combination of factors such as aging, genetics, and 
environment. Our current understanding of AD pathologies involves various 
hypotheses, such as the cholinergic, amyloid, tau protein, inflammatory, 
oxidative stress, metal ion, glutamate excitotoxicity, microbiota-gut-brain 
axis, and abnormal autophagy. Nonetheless, unraveling the interplay among these 
pathological aspects and pinpointing the primary initiators of AD require 
further elucidation and validation. In the past decades, most clinical drugs 
have been discontinued due to limited effectiveness or adverse effects. 
Presently, available drugs primarily offer symptomatic relief and often 
accompanied by undesirable side effects. However, recent approvals of aducanumab 
(1) and lecanemab (2) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) present the 
potential in disrease-modifying effects. Nevertheless, the long-term efficacy 
and safety of these drugs need further validation. Consequently, the quest for 
safer and more effective AD drugs persists as a formidable and pressing task. 
This review discusses the current understanding of AD pathogenesis, advances in 
diagnostic biomarkers, the latest updates of clinical trials, and emerging 
technologies for AD drug development. We highlight recent progress in the 
discovery of selective inhibitors, dual-target inhibitors, allosteric 
modulators, covalent inhibitors, proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs), and 
protein-protein interaction (PPI) modulators. Our goal is to provide insights 
into the prospective development and clinical application of novel AD drugs.

Neurodegenerative diseases represent a significant challenge to modern medicine, 
with their complex etiology and progressive nature posing hurdles to effective 
treatment strategies. Among the various contributing factors, mitochondrial 
dysfunction has emerged as a pivotal player in the pathogenesis of several 
neurodegenerative disorders. This review paper provides a comprehensive overview 
of how mitochondrial impairment contributes to the development of 
neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, 
Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, driven by bioenergetic 
defects, biogenesis impairment, alterations in mitochondrial dynamics (such as 
fusion or fission), disruptions in calcium buffering, lipid metabolism 
dysregulation and mitophagy dysfunction. It also covers current therapeutic 
interventions targeting mitochondrial dysfunction in these diseases.

Repurposing antidiabetic drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has 
emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy. This review examines the potential 
of repurposing antidiabetic drugs for AD treatment, focusing on preclinical 
evidence, clinical trials, and observational studies. In addition, the review 
aims to explore challenges and opportunities in repurposing antidiabetic drugs 
for AD, emphasizing the importance of well-designed clinical trials that 
consider patient selection criteria, refined outcome measures, adverse effects, 
and combination therapies to enhance therapeutic efficacy. Preclinical evidence 
suggests that glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogs, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 
(DPP4) inhibitors, metformin, thiazolidinediones, and sodium-glucose 
co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors exhibit neuroprotective effects in AD 
preclinical models. In preclinical studies, antidiabetic drugs have demonstrated 
neuroprotective effects by reducing amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques, tau 
hyperphosphorylation, neuroinflammation, and cognitive impairment. Antidiabetic 
drug classes, notably GLP-1 analogs and SGLT2 inhibitors, and a reduced risk of 
dementia in patients with diabetes mellitus. While the evidence for DPP4 
inhibitors is mixed, some studies suggest a potential protective effect. On the 
other hand, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (AGIs) and sulfonylureas may 
potentially increase the risk, especially in those experiencing recurrent 
hypoglycemic events. Repurposing antidiabetic drugs for AD is a promising 
therapeutic strategy, but challenges such as disease heterogeneity, limited 
biomarkers, and benefits versus risk evaluation need to be addressed. Ongoing 
clinical trials in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early AD patients without 
diabetes will be crucial in determining the clinical efficacy and safety of the 
antidiabetic drugs, paving the way for potential treatments for AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia worldwide. Current 
diagnostic modalities of AD generally focus on detecting the presence of amyloid 
β and tau protein in the brain (for example, positron emission tomography [PET] 
and cerebrospinal fluid testing), but these are limited by their high cost, 
invasiveness, and lack of expertise. Retinal imaging exhibits potential in AD 
screening and risk stratification, as the retina provides a platform for the 
optical visualization of the central nervous system in vivo, with vascular and 
neuronal changes that mirror brain pathology. Given the paradigm shift brought 
by advances in artificial intelligence and the emergence of disease-modifying 
therapies, this article aims to summarize and review the current literature to 
highlight 8 trends in an evolving landscape regarding the role and potential 
value of retinal imaging in AD screening.

The intricate nature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has presented significant 
hurdles in the development of effective interventions. Sulforaphane (SFN) is of 
interest due to its antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective 
properties, which could address various aspects of AD pathology. This study 
explores the potential of SFN in a rat model of AD induced by Aβ (1-42) 
peptides. AD symptoms were triggered in rats by injecting Aβ (1-42) peptides 
directly into their cerebral ventricles. SFN (10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg), 
Trigonelline (10 mg/kg), and Pioglitazone (10 mg/kg) were administered in Aβ 
(1-42) treated animals. Behavioral assessments were performed using the Novel 
Object Recognition tests. Various biochemical parameters, such as soluble Aβ 
(1-42), IRS-S312, GSK-3β, TNF-α, acetylcholinesterase, nitrite levels, lipid 
peroxidation, and reduced glutathione activity, were quantified using ELISA kits 
and spectrophotometric assays. Histopathological analyses included Hematoxylin 
and Eosin, Crystal Violet, Congo red, and IRS-1 Immunohistochemistry staining. 
Quantification was performed to assess neuronal loss and Aβ plaque burden. The 
novelty of this study lies in its comprehensive evaluation of SFN's impact on 
multiple AD-related pathways at dual doses. The Novel Object Recognition test 
revealed that SFN, especially at higher doses, improved memory deficits induced 
by Aβ (1-42). Biochemically, SFN reduced hippocampal Aβ levels, IRS-S312, 
GSK-3β, TNF-α, and acetylcholinesterase activity, while increasing glutathione 
levels, all in a dose-dependent manner. Histopathological analyses further 
confirmed SFN's protective role against Aβ-induced neuronal damage, amyloidosis, 
and changes in insulin signaling. These results highlight SFN's potential as a 
multifaceted therapeutic agent for AD, offering a promising avenue for treatment 
due to its antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties. The 
inclusion of combination treatments with Trigonelline and Pioglitazone alongside 
SFN offers insights into potential synergistic effects, which could pave the way 
for developing combination therapies for AD.

Manganese (Mn) is an environmental pollutant, and overexposure can cause 
neurodegenerative disorders similar to Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's 
disease that are characterized by β-amyloid (Aβ) overexpression, Tau 
hyperphosphorylation and neuroinflammation. However, the mechanisms of Mn 
neurotoxicity are not clearly defined. In our study, a knockout mouse model of 
Mn exposure combined with gut flora-induced neurotoxicity was constructed to 
investigate the effect of gut flora on Mn neurotoxicity. The results showed that 
the levels of Tau, p-Tau and Aβ in the hippocampus of C57BL/6 mice were greater 
than those in the hippocampus of control mice after 5 weeks of continuous 
exposure to manganese chloride (Mn content of 200 mg/L). Transplanted normal and 
healthy fecal microbiota from mice significantly downregulated Tau, p-Tau and Aβ 
expression and ameliorated brain pathology. Moreover, Mn exposure activated the 
cGAS-STING pathway and altered the cecal microbiota profile, characterized by an 
increase in Clostridiales, Pseudoflavonifractor, Ligilactobacillus and 
Desulfovibrio, and a decrease in Anaerotruncus, Eubacterium_ruminantium_group, 
Fusimonas and Firmicutes, While fecal microbiome transplantation (FMT) treatment 
inhibited this pathway and restored the microbiota profile. FMT alleviated Mn 
exposure-induced neurotoxicity by inhibiting activation of the NLRP3 
inflammasome triggered by overactivation of the cGAS-STING pathway. Deletion of 
the cGAS and STING genes and FMT altered the gut microbiota composition and its 
predictive function. Phenotypic prediction revealed that FMT markedly decreased 
the abundances of anaerobic and stress-tolerant bacteria and significantly 
increased the abundances of facultative anaerobic bacteria and biofilm-forming 
bacteria after blocking the cGAS-STING pathway compared to the Mn-exposed group. 
FMT from normal and healthy mice ameliorated the neurotoxicity of Mn exposure, 
possibly through alterations in the composition and function of the microbiome 
associated with the cGAS-STING/NLRP3 pathway. This study provides a prospective 
direction for future research on the mechanism of Mn neurotoxicity.

BACKGROUND: Lingguizhugan (LGZG) decoction, an ancient Chinese herbal remedy 
originating from the Eastern Han Dynasty, consists of Poria cocos, Cinnamomi 
ramulus, Atractylodes macrocephala, and Glycyrrhiza, as described in the Golden 
Chamber Synopsis. It has a history spanning over 1600 years, in which it has 
been primarily used for the treatment of inflammation, injuries, and fluid 
retention; however, the potential of LGZG decoction to ameliorate Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) progression by modulating the gut-brain axis through attenuation of 
gut microbiota and their metabolites remains unknown.
PURPOSE: To examine the in vivo anti-AD effects and mechanism of LGZG decoction 
in alleviating AD cognitive impairment.
STUDY DESIGN: Two-part experiments in vivo were designed, one for behavior 
tests, intestinal and brain histopathology, intestinal microbiome and 
quantitative determination, and another one for metabolite supplementation 
study.
METHODS: AlCl3/D-gal was used to establish an AD-like mouse model. Behavioral 
tests, such as the Morris water maze test, were used to assess the effect of 
LGZG decoction on cognitive dysfunction. The concentration of proinflammatory 
mediators was measured by ELISA. The protein content was detected by western 
blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. The content of short-chain fatty acids 
was measured by LC-MS/MS. Evaluation of 16S rRNA gene sequencing for species and 
strain-level gut microbiome analysis was performed.
RESULTS: LGZG decoction mitigated cognitive impairment in an AD-like mouse 
model, and decreased the deposition of amyloid-β and the production of 
proinflammatory cytokines in the brain. LGZG decoction remodeled the intestinal 
microecology, enhanced the integrity of the intestinal and brain tissue 
barriers, and modulated Aβ transportation through gut microbiota metabolite 
SCFAs. The neuroprotective effect of SCFAs on the AD-like model mice may be 
manifested through the inhibition of pP38 of the MAPK signaling pathway.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that LGZG decoction reshapes the gut microbiota. 
SCFAs derived from the gut microbiota ameliorate the cognitive decline induced 
by AlCl3/D-gal through the gut-brain axis and reduce brain Aβ aggregation. We 
propose LGZG decoction as a potential therapeutic option for AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative condition 
characterized by progressive cognitive decline and memory loss, affecting 
millions of people worldwide. Traditional treatments, such as cholinesterase 
inhibitors and NMDA receptor antagonists, offer limited symptomatic relief 
without addressing the underlying disease mechanisms. These limitations have 
driven the development of more potent and effective therapies. Recent advances 
in immunotherapy present promising avenues for AD treatment. Immunotherapy 
strategies, including both active and passive approaches, harness the immune 
system to target and mitigate AD-related pathology. Active immunotherapy 
stimulates the patient's immune response to produce antibodies against 
AD-specific antigens, while passive immunotherapy involves administering 
preformed antibodies or immune cells that specifically target amyloid-β (Aβ) or 
tau proteins. Monoclonal antibodies, such as aducanumab and lecanemab, have 
shown potential in reducing Aβ plaques and slowing cognitive decline in clinical 
trials, despite challenges related to adverse immune responses and the need for 
precise targeting. This comprehensive review explores the role of the immune 
system in AD, evaluates the current successes and limitations of 
immunotherapeutic approaches, and discusses future directions for enhancing the 
treatment efficacy.

PURPOSE: To study the effects of benign prostatic hyperplasia treatments, 
namely: alpha-adrenergic receptor blockers, 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors and 
phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors on the risk of Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's 
disease and mortality.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All male Medicare enrollees aged 65 or above who were 
diagnosed with benign prostatic hyperplasia and received one of the study drugs 
between 2007-2020 were followed-up for the three outcomes. We used Cox 
regression analysis to assess the relative risk of each of the outcomes for each 
study drug compared to the most prescribed drug, tamsulosin, while controlling 
for demographic, socioeconomic and comorbidity factors.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The study analyzed 1.1 million patients for a mean 
follow-up period of 3.1 years from being prescribed one of the study drugs. For 
all outcomes, patients on tamsulosin were used as the reference for comparison. 
For mortality, alfuzosin was associated with 27% risk reduction (HR 0.73, 95%CI 
0.68-0.78), and doxazosin with 6% risk reduction (HR 0.94, 95%CI 0.91-0.97). For 
Parkinson's disease, terazosin was associated with 26% risk reduction (HR 0.74, 
95%CI 0.66-0.83), and doxazosin with 21% risk reduction (HR 0.79, 95%CI 
0.72-0.88). For Alzheimer's disease, terazosin was associated with 27% risk 
reduction (HR 0.73, 95%CI 0.65-0.82), and doxazosin with 16% risk reduction (HR 
0.84, 95%CI 0.76-0.92). Tadalafil was associated with risk reduction (27-40%) in 
all 3 outcomes. More research is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms 
of these observations. Given the availability of safer alternatives for treating 
benign prostatic hyperplasia, caution should be exercised when using tamsulosin 
in elderly patients, especially those with an increased risk of developing 
neurodegenerative diseases.

Impaired cerebral glucose metabolism is a pathologic feature of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), with recent proteomic studies highlighting disrupted glial 
metabolism in AD. We report that inhibition of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase 1 
(IDO1), which metabolizes tryptophan to kynurenine (KYN), rescues hippocampal 
memory function in mouse preclinical models of AD by restoring astrocyte 
metabolism. Activation of astrocytic IDO1 by amyloid β and tau oligomers 
increases KYN and suppresses glycolysis in an aryl hydrocarbon 
receptor-dependent manner. In amyloid and tau models, IDO1 inhibition improves 
hippocampal glucose metabolism and rescues hippocampal long-term potentiation in 
a monocarboxylate transporter-dependent manner. In astrocytic and neuronal 
cocultures from AD subjects, IDO1 inhibition improved astrocytic production of 
lactate and uptake by neurons. Thus, IDO1 inhibitors presently developed for 
cancer might be repurposed for treatment of AD.

Depression is a mental disorder characterised by persistent low mood, anhedonia 
and cognitive impairment that affects an estimated 3.8% of the world's 
population, including 5% of adults. Peganum harmala L. (P. harmala) is a 
medicinal plant and has been reported to be effective against Alzheimer's 
disease, Parkinson's disease and depression. The present study was aimed to 
evaluate the behavioral and pharmacological effects of P. harmala seed extract 
in rats exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) in vivo and to 
investigate the mechanism of action. CUMS-exposed rats were treated with P. 
harmala extract (75 and 150 mg/kg, i.p.) for 2 weeks. HPLC analysis was used to 
determine the concentration of harmaline and harmine alkaloids in the extract. 
Heavy metal analysis in seeds was performed by ICP-MS. Our results showed that 
P. harmala at the dose of 150 mg/kg significantly reduced the depressive-like 
behaviors in CUMS-exposed rats, as evidenced by increased sucrose consumption in 
the sucrose preference test (SPT), decreased immobility time in the forced swim 
test (FST) and plasma corticosterone levels, increased the time spent in open 
arms in the elevated plus maze (EPM), and improved memory and learning in the 
passive avoidance test (PAT). In addition, P. harmala decreased monoamine 
oxidase-A (MAO-A) levels, and increased serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA), and 
noradrenaline (NA) levels in the brains of rats exposed to CUMS. P. harmala 
decreased the expression of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor nuclear 
factor-κB (NF-κB), and increased the antioxidant nuclear factor erythroid 
2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in rat brain. Furthermore, P. harmala improved 
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and tropomyosin receptor kinase B 
(TrkB) protein expression in rat brain. In conclusion, P. harmala at a dose of 
150 mg/kg is more effective in preventing depressive-like behavior in 
CUMS-exposed rats by improving neurotransmitter levels, reducing oxidative 
stress, suppressing neuroinflammation and activating the BDNF/TrkB pathway, all 
of which are important in the pathogenesis of depression.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this paper is to explore how telephone-delivered 
mindfulness training impacts family conflict and communication within the 
informal dementia caregiving team, including primary caregivers, their care 
partner, and the care recipient.
METHOD: Primary caregivers and their care partners participated in an eight-week 
telephone-delivered mindfulness-based intervention (MBI). This study used mixed 
methods and a pre-post design to evaluate the intervention's effect on family 
satisfaction, perceived support, and family conflict.
RESULTS: Both family satisfaction and perceived informational support increased 
significantly, and qualitative analysis revealed four key themes illustrating 
how the mindfulness intervention served to positively impact family conflict and 
communication among participating caregivers.
CONCLUSION: This study provides preliminary evidence for the beneficial effects 
of an MBI on family functioning among rural African American caregivers of 
people with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.

BACKGROUND: Whether cognitive and functional recovery in skilled nursing 
facilities (SNF) following hospitalization differs by delirium and Alzheimer's 
disease related dementias (ADRD) has not been examined.
OBJECTIVE: To compare change in cognition and function among short-stay SNF 
patients with delirium, ADRD, or both.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using claims data from 2011 to 2013.
SETTING: Centers for Medicare and Medicaid certified SNFs.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 740,838 older adults newly admitted to a short-stay SNF 
without prevalent ADRD who had at least two assessments of cognition and 
function.
MEASUREMENTS: Incident delirium was measured by the Minimum Data Set (MDS) 
Confusion Assessment Method and ICD-9 codes, and incident ADRD by ICD-9 codes 
and MDS diagnoses. Cognitive improvement was a better or maximum score on the 
MDS Brief Interview for Mental Status, and functional recovery was a better or 
maximum score on the MDS Activities of Daily Living Scale.
RESULTS: Within 30 days of SNF admission, the rate of cognitive improvement in 
patients with both delirium/ADRD was half that of patients with neither 
delirium/ADRD (HR = 0.45, 95% CI:0.43, 0.46). The ADRD-only and delirium-only 
groups also were 43% less likely to have improved cognition or function compared 
to those with neither delirium/ADRD (HR = 0.57, 95% CI:0.56, 0.58 and HR = 0.57, 
95% CI:0.55, 0.60, respectively). Functional improvement was less likely in 
patients with both delirium/ADRD, as well (HR = 0.85, 95% CI:0.83, 0.87). The 
ADRD only and delirium only groups were also less likely to improve in function 
(HR = 0.93, 95% CI:0.92, 0.94 and HR = 0.92, 95% CI:0.90, 0.93, respectively) 
compared to those with neither delirium/ADRD.
CONCLUSIONS: Among older adults without dementia admitted to SNF for post-acute 
care following hospitalization, a positive screen for delirium and a new 
diagnosis of ADRD, within 7 days of SNF admission, were both significantly 
associated with worse cognitive and functional recovery. Patients with both 
delirium and new ADRD had the worst cognitive and functional recovery.

AIMS: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is closely associated with Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), and is considered an accelerator of AD. Our previous study has confirmed 
that the Calpain inhibitor Calpeptin may alleviate AD-like complications of 
diabetes mellitus. This work further investigated its underlying mechanism.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Diabetes mellitus rat model was constructed by a high-fat 
and high-sugar diet combined with streptozotocin, followed by the administration 
of Calpeptin. Moreover, rats were micro-injected with LV-TXNIP-OE/vector into 
the CA1 region of the hippocampus one day before streptozotocin injection. The 
Morris water maze test assessed the spatial learning and memory ability of rats. 
Immunohistochemistry and western blotting detected the expression of the 
pericyte marker PDGFRβ, tight junction proteins occludin and ZO-1, calpain-1, 
calpain-2, APP, Aβ, Aβ-related, and TXNIP/NLRP3 inflammasome-related proteins. 
Immunofluorescence staining examined the blood vessel density and neurons in the 
hippocampus. Evans blue extravasation and fluorescence detected the permeability 
of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in rats. Additionally, the oxidative stress 
markers and inflammatory-related factors were assessed by enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS: Calpeptin effectively reduced the expression of Calpain-2 and 
TXNIP/NLRP3 inflammasome-related proteins, improved the decreased pericyte 
marker (PDGFR-β) and cognitive impairment in hippocampus of DM rats. The 
neuronal loss, microvessel density, permeability of BBB, Aβ accumulation, 
inflammation, and oxidative stress injury in the hippocampus of DM rats were 
also partly rescued by calpeptin treatment. The influence conferred by calpeptin 
treatment was reversed by TXNIP overexpression.
CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrated that calpeptin treatment alleviated AD-like 
symptoms in DM rats through regulating TXNIP/NLRP3 inflammasome. Thus, calpeptin 
may be a potential drug to treat AD-like complications of diabetes mellitus.

Alzheimer's disease is a multifaceted neurodegenerative disease. Cholinergic 
dysfunction, amyloid β toxicity, tauopathies, oxidative stress, 
neuroinflammation are among the main pathologies of the disease. Ligands 
targeting more than one pathology, multi-target directed ligands, attract 
attention in the recent years to tackle Alzheimer's disease. In this review, we 
aimed to cover different biochemical pathways, that are revealed in recent years 
for the pathology of the disease, as druggable targets such as cannabinoid 
receptors, matrix metalloproteinases, histone deacetylase and various kinases 
including, glycogen synthase kinase-3, mitogen-activated protein kinase and 
c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and their ligands for the treatment of Alzheimer's 
disease in the hope of providing more realistic insights into the field.

The therapeutic landscape of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is rapidly changing. 
Disease-modifying medications for AD that target amyloid-beta (Aß) deposits in 
the brain have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in recent 
years. However, there remain many questions about which patients are most 
appropriate for these medications. One group in particular with unique 
considerations includes older adults with a prior history of seizures. AD and 
seizures represent an important, bidirectional relationship. This case report 
presents a patient story that highlights the importance of discussions around 
seizure history in consideration of anti-amyloid medications and the importance 
of risk-benefit assessments when considering anti-amyloid therapeutics for 
patients with AD.

With the intensification of aging population, the prevention or treatment of 
neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, 
has drawn more and more attention. As a long used traditional Chinese medicine, 
Uncaria rhynchophylla (Miq.) Jacks., named Gouteng in Chinese, has been reported 
to have an effective neuroprotective role in neurodegenerative diseases. In this 
review, the beneficial pharmacological effects and signaling pathways of herbal 
formulas containing U. rhynchophylla, especially major compounds identified from 
U. rhynchophylla, such as corynoxine B, corynoxine, rhynchophylline, and 
isorhynchophylline, in neurodegenerative diseases, were summarized, which not 
only provide an overview of U. rhynchophylla for the prevention or treatment of 
neurodegenerative diseases but also give some perspective to the development of 
new drugs from traditional Chinese medicine.

BACKGROUND: Observational studies have shown that the correlation between 
neurodegenerative diseases and colorectal cancer (CRC) remains controversial. 
Therefore, this study aimed to verify the causal association between these two 
diseases.
METHODS: Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was used to assess the causal 
relationships between five major neurodegenerative diseases and CRC. 
Multivariable MR (MVMR) analysis was conducted to assess the direct causal 
effect of neurodegenerative diseases on CRC. Colocalization and pathway 
enrichment analyses were conducted to further elucidate our results. Sensitivity 
analysis was conducted to assess the robustness of the results.
RESULTS: Genetically predicted Alzheimer's disease (AD) nominally increased CRC 
risk (OR = 1.0620, 95%CI = 1.0127-1.1136, P = 0.013). There was no causal effect 
of genetically predicted CRC on neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, we 
demonstrated that genetically predicted AD marginally increased colon cancer 
risk (OR = 1.1621, 95%CI = 1.0267-1.3153, P = 0.017). Genetically predicted Lewy 
body dementia (LBD) had a significant causal effect on the increasing risk of 
colon cancer (IVW OR = 1.1779, 95%CI = 1.0694-1.2975, P = 0.001). MVMR indicated 
that effect of AD on colon cancer was driven by LBD, type 2 diabetes, body mass 
index, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol, triglyceride, total cholesterol (TC), processed meat consumption, 
smoking, alcohol consumption, and educational attainment, whereas the effect of 
LBD on colon cancer was only influenced by TC. Colocalization and pathway 
enrichment analysis suggested that LBD and colon cancer possibly shared causal 
variants (nearby gene APOE), and ERBB4 signaling and lipid metabolism may 
mediate the causal association between LBD and colon cancer. Sensitivity 
analysis confirmed the reliability of our findings.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that genetic vulnerabilities to AD nominally 
increased the overall risk of CRC and colon cancer. Genetically predicted LBD 
indicated an elevated risk of colon cancer, potentially linked to ERBB4 
signaling and lipid metabolism.

Polygonati Rhizoma (PR, Huangjing in Chinese) and its processed product (PRP), 
which are used in Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for cognitive enhancement 
and treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), have not been fully explored in terms 
of the different mechanisms underlying their anti-AD effects. Therefore, we used 
APP/PS1 mice as an AD model to assess the effects of PR and PRP on anxiety-like 
behaviors, cognitive function, memory performance, and pathological changes in 
the murine brain. UPLC-HRMS was applied to identify the components of PR and PRP 
that entered into the blood and brain. Network pharmacology was used to 
elucidate potential mechanisms underlying the improvement of AD. Differences in 
the intestinal flora composition between mice treated with PR and PRP were 
investigated using 16S rRNA sequencing, establishing a correlation between 
pharmacological components and distinct flora profiles. The results revealed 
that both PR and PRP interventions ameliorated cognitive deficits and attenuated 
Amyloid β (Aβ) plaque deposition in the brains of AD mice. Seven specific 
blood-entering components, namely glutamic acid, Phe-Phe, and uridine, etc., 
were associated with PR intervention, whereas ten specific blood-entering 
components including (2R,3S)-3-isopropylmalate, 
3-methylhexahydropyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrazine-1,4-dione, and 3-methoxytyrosine were 
related to PRP intervention. Uridine was identified as a common 
brain-penetrating component in both PR and PRP interventions. Network 
pharmacology analysis suggested that the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, 
Calcium signaling pathway and Alzheimer's disease were specific pathways 
targeted in AD treatment using PR intervention. Moreover, the apoptosis pathway 
was specifically linked to AD treatment during PRP intervention. Furthermore, 
the administration of both PR and PRP enhanced the abundance and diversity of 
the intestinal flora in APP/PS1 mice. Western blotting confirmed that PR excels 
in regulates inflammation, whereas PRP balances autophagy and apoptosis to 
alleviate the progression of AD. This study offers valuable insights and 
establishes a robust foundation for further comprehensive exploration of the 
intrinsic correlation between TCM and AD.

BACKGROUND: Porphyromonas gingivalis (P.gingivalis) is associated with the onset 
of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the underlying molecular mechanism is unclear. 
Neuroinflammation in the brain from the microglial immune response induces the 
pathological progression of AD. In this study, the roles and molecular mechanism 
of P.gingivalis in microglial inflammation in vitro were investigated.
METHODS: In this study, a P.gingivalis oral administration mouse model was 
generated, and microglia were stimulated with P.gingivalis in vitro. The 
viability of the microglia after P.gingivalis treatment was evaluated through 
CCK-8 and live/dead cell staining. Inflammation in brain tissue after 
P.gingivalis treatment and the immune response of microglia in vitro were 
detected by RT‒PCR, Western blotting and IF. Moreover, the RNA sequence was 
used, and the role of the NF-κB signalling pathway in microglial activation was 
analysed after P.gingivalis stimulation.
RESULTS: The mRNA and protein levels of IL-6 and IL-17 were increased, and the 
expression of IL-10 was decreased in brain tissue after P.gingivalis oral 
administration. The viability of the HMC3 cells significantly decreased with 5% 
P.gingivalis after stimulation. The results of live/dead cell staining also 
showed the inhibitory effect of 5% P.gingivalis supplementation on cell 
viability. Moreover, 5% P.gingivalis supplementation increased the mRNA and 
protein levels of IL-6 and IL-17 and decreased IL-10 expression in HMC3 cells. 
P.gingivalis supplementation increased the mRNA and protein levels of iNOS and 
CD86 and decreased CD206 expression in HMC3 cells. RNA sequencing revealed that 
the NF-κB signalling pathway was involved in this process. Furthermore, p-P65 
was upregulated and p-IKBα was downregulated in brain tissue and HMC3 cells 
after P.gingivalis stimulation, and an NF-κB signalling pathway inhibitor (QNZ) 
reversed the viability, M1 polarization and inflammatory factors of microglia in 
HMC3 cells in vitro.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, P.gingivalis induced neuroinflammation in the brain, 
possibly through promotion of M1 polarization of microglia via activation of the 
NF-κB signalling pathway during the progression of AD.

Neurological diseases have consistently represented a significant challenge in 
both clinical treatment and scientific research. As research has progressed, the 
significance of mitochondria in the pathogenesis and progression of neurological 
diseases has become increasingly prominent. Mitochondria serve not only as a 
source of energy, but also as regulators of cellular growth and death. Both 
oxidative stress and mitophagy are intimately associated with mitochondria, and 
there is mounting evidence that mitophagy and oxidative stress exert a pivotal 
regulatory influence on the pathogenesis of neurological diseases. In recent 
years, there has been a notable rise in the prevalence of cerebral 
ischemia/reperfusion injury (CI/RI), vascular dementia (VaD), and Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), which collectively represent a significant public health concern. 
Reduced levels of mitophagy have been observed in CI/RI, VaD and AD. The 
improvement of associated pathology has been demonstrated through the increase 
of mitophagy levels. CI/RI results in cerebral tissue ischemia and hypoxia, 
which causes oxidative stress, disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and 
damage to the cerebral vasculature. The BBB disruption and cerebral vascular 
injury may induce or exacerbate VaD to some extent. In addition, inadequate 
cerebral perfusion due to vascular injury or altered function may exacerbate the 
accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) thereby contributing to or exacerbating AD 
pathology. Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA; alteplase) and 
endovascular thrombectomy are effective treatments for stroke. However, there is 
a narrow window of opportunity for the administration of tPA and thrombectomy, 
which results in a markedly elevated incidence of disability among patients with 
CI/RI. It is regrettable that there are currently no there are still no specific 
drugs for VaD and AD. Despite the availability of the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA)-approved clinical first-line drugs for AD, including 
memantine, donepezil hydrochloride, and galantamine, these agents do not 
fundamentally block the pathological process of AD. In this paper, we undertake 
a review of the mechanisms of mitophagy and oxidative stress in neurological 
disorders, a summary of the clinical trials conducted in recent years, and a 
proposal for a new strategy for targeted treatment of neurological disorders 
based on both mitophagy and oxidative stress.

Discharge disposition for home health care patients with Alzheimer's disease and 
related dementia: The role of living arrangements and rural living.

University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.

PURPOSE: To examine the relationship between living arrangements and discharge 
disposition, and how this relationship differs by the rural or urban 
characteristics of the patient's residence among home health care patients with 
Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD).
METHODS: This retrospective study used the 2019 Outcome and Assessment 
Information Set and the Master Beneficiary Summary File. Our study was based on 
531,269 Medicare fee-for-service patients with ADRD. We used linear probability 
regression models to examine the relationship between discharge disposition (to 
the community vs. an institution) and living arrangements, including an 
interaction term for rural-urban residence.
FINDINGS: Patients in rural areas (19.8%) were more likely to live alone than 
those in urban areas (15.2%). Our main results show that patients living at home 
with others (coefficient: -0.02, p-value < 0.001) or alone (coefficient: -0.03, 
p-value < 0.001) were less likely to be discharged to the community compared to 
patients who lived in congregate settings. Also, for patients with ADRD who 
lived in rural areas, living at home with others (rural*home with others; 
coefficient: -0.02, p-value < 0.001) or living alone (rural*home alone; 
coefficient: -0.03, p-value<0.001) were associated with additional lower 
probabilities of being discharged to their communities.
CONCLUSIONS: A multidimensional approach considering living arrangements to 
support home health care patients with ADRD could be critical to achieving 
better health outcomes. Furthermore, implementing area-specific target 
interventions could be important for improving the care and health of patients 
with ADRD as well as reducing rural-urban disparities in discharge disposition.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common, complex and multifactorial 
disease that may require screening across multiple routes of referral to enable 
early detection and subsequent future implementation of tailored interventions. 
Blood- and eye-based biomarkers show promise as low-cost, scalable and 
patient-friendly tools for early AD detection given their ability to provide 
information on AD pathophysiological changes and manifestations in the retina, 
respectively. Eye clinics provide an intriguing real-world proof-of-concept 
setting to evaluate the performance of these potential AD screening tools given 
the intricate connections between the eye and brain, presumed enrichment for AD 
pathology in the aging population with eye disorders, and the potential for an 
accelerated diagnostic pathway for under-recognized patient groups.
METHODS: The BeyeOMARKER study is a prospective, observational, longitudinal 
cohort study aiming to include individuals visiting an eye-clinic. Inclusion 
criteria entail being ≥ 50 years old and having no prior dementia diagnosis. 
Excluded eye-conditions include traumatic insults, superficial inflammation, and 
conditions in surrounding structures of the eye that are not engaged in vision. 
The BeyeOMARKER cohort (n = 700) will undergo blood collection to assess plasma 
p-tau217 levels and a brief cognitive screening at the eye clinic. All 
participants will subsequently be invited for annual longitudinal follow-up 
including remotely administered cognitive screening and questionnaires. The 
BeyeOMARKER + cohort (n = 150), consisting of 100 plasma p-tau217 positive 
participants and 50 matched negative controls selected from the BeyeOMARKER 
cohort, will additionally undergo Aβ-PET and tau-PET, MRI, retinal imaging 
including hyperspectral imaging (primary), widefield imaging, optical coherence 
tomography (OCT) and OCT-Angiography (secondary), and cognitive and cortical 
vision assessments.
RESULTS: We aim to implement the current protocol between April 2024 until March 
2027. Primary outcomes include the performance of plasma p-tau217 and 
hyperspectral retinal imaging to detect AD pathology (using Aβ- and tau-PET 
visual read as reference standard) and to detect cognitive decline. Initial 
follow-up is ~ 2 years but may be extended with additional funding.
CONCLUSIONS: We envision that the BeyeOMARKER study will demonstrate the 
feasibility of early AD detection based on blood- and eye-based biomarkers in 
alternative screening settings, and will improve our understanding of the 
eye-brain connection.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The BeyeOMARKER study (Eudamed CIV ID: CIV-NL-23-09-044086; 
registration date: 19th of March 2024) is approved by the ethical review board 
of the Amsterdam UMC.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) manifests with a higher rate of occurrence 
in women. Previous epidemiological studies have suggested a potential 
association between AD and gynecological cancers, but the causal relationship 
between them remains unclear. This study aims to explore the causal link between 
12 types of gynecological cancers and AD using a bidirectional Mendelian 
randomization (MR) approach.
METHODS: We obtained genetic correlation tools for AD using data from the most 
extensive genome-wide association study. Genetic correlation data for 12 types 
of gynecological cancers were also sourced from the Finnish Biobank. These 
cancers include breast cancer (BC), cervical adenocarcinoma (CA), cervical 
squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC), cervical cancer (CC), endometrial cancer (EC), 
ovarian endometrioid carcinoma (OEC), ovarian cancer (OC), ovarian serous 
carcinoma (OSC), breast carcinoma in situ (BCIS), cervical carcinoma in situ 
(CCIS), endometrial carcinoma in situ (ECIS), and vulvar carcinoma in situ 
(VCIS). We used the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) model for causal analysis 
and conducted horizontal pleiotropy tests, heterogeneity tests, MR-PRESSO tests, 
and leave-one-out analyses to ensure the robustness of our results. We also 
applied replication analysis and meta-analysis to further validate our 
experimental results.
RESULTS: The study found that EC (P_IVW =0.037, OR [95% CI] = 1.032 [1.002, 
1.064]) and CCIS (P_IVW = 0.046, OR [95% CI] = 1.032 [1.011, 1.064]) increase 
the risk of AD, whereas OC was negatively correlated with AD (P_IVW = 0.016, OR 
[95% CI] = 0.974[0.954, 0.995]). In reverse MR analysis, AD increased the risk 
of CC (P_IVW = 0.039, OR [95% CI] = 1.395 [1.017, 1.914]) and VCIS (P_IVW = 
0.041, OR [95% CI] = 1.761 [1.027, 2.021]), but was negatively correlated with 
OEC (P_IVW = 0.034, OR [95% CI] = 0.634 [0.417, 0.966]). Sensitivity analysis 
results demonstrated robustness. These findings were further substantiated 
through replication and meta-analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Our MR study supports a causal relationship between AD and 
gynecological cancers. This encourages further research into the incidence of 
gynecological cancers in female Alzheimer's patients and the active prevention 
of AD.

Coffee, a universally consumed beverage, is known to contain thousands of 
bioactive constituents that have garnered interest due to their potential 
neuroprotective effects against various neurodegenerative disorders, including 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Extensive research has been conducted on coffee 
constituents such as Caffeine, Trigonelline, Chlorogenic acid, and Caffeic acid, 
focusing on their neuroprotective properties. These compounds have potential to 
impact key mechanisms in AD development, including amyloidopathy, tauopathy, and 
neuroinflammation. Furthermore, apart from its neuroprotective effects, coffee 
consumption has been associated with anticancerogenic and anti-inflammatory 
effects, thereby enhancing its therapeutic potential. Studies suggest that 
moderate coffee intake, typically around two to three cups daily, could 
potentially contribute to mitigating AD progression and lowering the risk of 
related neurological disorders. This literature underscores the potential 
neuroprotective properties of coffee compounds, which usually perform their 
neuronal protective effects via modulating nuclear factor 
kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), nuclear factor 
erythroid-derived 2-like 2 (Nrf2), interleukins, tumor necrosis factor-alpha 
(TNF-α), and many other molecules.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Updates in Alzheimer disease (AD) diagnostic 
guidelines by the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) 
and the International Working Group (IWG) over the past 11 years may affect 
clinical diagnoses. We assessed how these guidelines affect clinical AD 
diagnosis in a cohort of cognitively unimpaired (CU) and cognitively impaired 
(CI) individuals.
METHODS: We applied clinical and biomarker data in algorithms to classify 
individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort 
according to the following diagnostic guidelines for AD: 2011 NIA-AA, 2016 
IWG-2, 2018 NIA-AA, and 2021 IWG-3, assigning the following generic diagnostic 
labels: (1) not AD (nAD), (2) increased risk of developing AD (irAD), and (3) 
AD. Diagnostic labels were compared according to their frequency, convergence 
across guidelines, biomarker profiles, and prognostic value. We also evaluated 
the diagnostic discordance among the criteria.
RESULTS: A total of 1,195 individuals (mean age 73.2 ± 7.2 years, mean education 
16.1 ± 2.7, 44.0% female) presented different repartitions of diagnostic labels 
according to the 2011 NIA-AA (nAD = 37.8%, irAD = 23.0%, AD = 39.2%), 2016 IWG-2 
(nAD = 37.7%, irAD = 28.7%, AD = 33.6%), 2018 NIA-AA (nAD = 40.7%, irAD = 9.3%, 
AD = 50.0%), and 2021 IWG-3 (nAD = 51.2%, irAD = 8.4%, AD = 48.3%) frameworks. 
Discordant diagnoses across all guidelines were found in 512 participants 
(42.8%) (138 [91.4%] occurring in only β-amyloid [CU 65.4%, CI 34.6%] and 191 
[78.6%] in only tau-positive [CU 71.7%, CI 28.3%] individuals). Differences in 
predicting cognitive impairment between nAD and irAD groups were observed with 
the 2011 NIA-AA (hazard ratio [HR] 2.21, 95% CI 1.34-3.65, p = 0.002), 2016 
IWG-2 (HR 2.81, 95% CI 1.59-4.96, p < 0.000), and 2021 IWG-3 (HR 3.61, 95% CI 
2.09-6.23, p < 0.000), but not with 2018 NIA-AA (HR 1.69, 95% CI 0.87-3.28, p = 
0.115).
DISCUSSION: Over 42% of the studied population presented discordant diagnoses 
when using the different examined AD criteria, mostly in individuals with a 
single positive biomarker. Except for 2018 NIA-AA, all guidelines identified 
asymptomatic individuals at risk of cognitive impairment. Our findings highlight 
important differences between the guidelines, emphasizing the necessity for 
updated criteria with enhanced staging metrics, considering clinical, research, 
therapeutic, and trial design aspects.

Leukotrienes (LTs) are a group of substances that cause inflammation. They are 
produced by the enzyme 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) from arachidonic acid. Cysteinyl 
LTs are a group of lipid molecules that have a prominent role in inflammatory 
signaling in the allergic diseases. Although they are traditionally known for 
their role in allergic disease, current advancements in bio-medical research 
have shed light on the involvement of these inflammatory mediators in diseases 
such as in the inflammation related to central nervous system (CNS) disorders. 
Among the CNS diseases, LTs, along with 5-LOX and their receptors, have been 
shown to be associated with multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
and Parkinson's disease (PD). Through a comprehensive review of current research 
and experimentation, this investigation provides an insight on the biosynthesis, 
receptors, and biological effects of LTs in the body. Furthermore, implications 
of leukotriene signaling in CNS and its intricate role in neurodegeneration are 
also studied. Through the revelation of these insights, our aim is to establish 
a foundation for the development of enhanced and focused therapeutic approaches 
in the continuous endeavor to combat neurodegeneration. Furthermore, the 
pharmacological inhibition of leukotriene signaling with selective inhibitors 
offers promising prospects for future interventions and treatments for 
neurodegenerative diseases.

The neurobiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is unclear due to its 
multifactorial nature. Although a wide range of studies revealed several 
pathomechanisms of AD, dementia is yet unmanageable with current 
pharmacotherapies. The recent growing literature illustrates the role of 
microglia-mediated neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of AD. Indeed, 
microglia serve as predominant sentinels of the brain, which diligently monitor 
the neuroimmune axis by phagocytosis and releasing soluble factors. In the case 
of AD, microglial cells are involved in synaptic pruning and remodeling by 
producing inflammatory mediators. The conditional inter-transformation of 
classical activation (proinflammatory) or alternative activation 
(anti-inflammatory) microglia is responsible for most brain disorders. In this 
review, we discussed the role of microglia in neuroinflammatory processes in AD 
following the accumulation of amyloid-β and tau proteins. We also described the 
prominent phenotypes of microglia, such as disease-associated microglia (DAM), 
dark microglia, interferon-responsive microglia (IRMs), human AD microglia 
(HAMs), and microglial neurodegenerative phenotype (MGnD), which are closely 
associated with AD incidence. Considering the key role of microglia in AD 
progression, microglial-based therapeutics may hold promise in mitigating 
cognitive deficits by addressing the neuroinflammatory responses.

Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) are key in understanding complex 
diseases. Nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) occur in 
protein-coding regions, potentially altering amino acid sequences, protein 
structure and function. Computational methods are vital for distinguishing 
deleterious nsSNPs from neutral ones. We investigated the role of NLRP3 gene in 
neuroinflammation associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. A total 
of 893 missense (nsSNPs) were obtained from the dbSNP database and subjected to 
rigorous filtering using bioinformatics tools like SIFT, Align GVGD, PolyPhen-2, 
and PANTHER to identify potentially damaging variants. Of these, 18 nsSNPs were 
consistently predicted to have deleterious effects across all tools. Notably, 16 
of these variants exhibited reduced protein stability, while only 4 were 
predicted to be buried within the protein structure. Among the identified 
nsSNPs, rs180177442 (R262L and R262P), rs201875324 (T659I), and rs139814109 
(T897M) were classified as high-risk variants due to their significant 
deleterious impact, probable damaging effects, and association with decreased 
protein stability. Molecular docking and simulation analyses were conducted 
utilizing Memantine, a standard drug utilized in AD treatment, to investigate 
potential interactions with the altered protein structures. Additional clinical 
and genetic investigations are necessary to elucidate the underlying mechanisms 
that link NLRP3 polymorphisms with the initiation of AD.

Brain Plasticity Mechanisms in Various Populations: Protocol for a 
Single-Center, Open-Label, Controlled Clinical Trial.

BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment is one of the major diseases facing the aging 
population. The progressive decline of cognitive function can lead to declining 
health or even the loss of life, work, and social ability. Exercise and 
behavioral stimulation can increase neurotransmitters in the brain and improve 
overall health and cognitive function. Reactivity training can mobilize 
neuromuscular function and induce changes in brain plasticity, which may 
effectively improve cognitive dysfunction and delay the occurrence and 
development of Alzheimer disease; however, the evidence supporting its 
effectiveness is still limited.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the effectiveness and reliability of 
visual-motor reaction training in improving cognitive function, thereby 
promoting the application of novel nonpharmacological therapies.
METHODS: This study is a single-center, open-label, controlled clinical trial. A 
total of 78 participants will be recruited for the study, including an equal 
number of athletes, ordinary healthy college students, and ordinary older adults 
in the community. Participants will receive 2 weeks of visual-motor response 
training. The primary outcome of this study is to assess differences in 
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at 2 weeks. The secondary outcomes 
were the following: acousto-optic response time, Hamilton Depression Rating 
Scale (HAM-D), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), Mini Mental State 
Examination (MMSE), Activity of Daily Living (ADL) Scale, Subjective Cognitive 
Decline Questionnaire-9 (SCD-Q9), a 10-word memory test, and safety.
RESULTS: The study was approved by the Shanghai Clinical Research Ethics 
Committee on January 2, 2024 (SECCR/2023-162-01). As of September 11, 2024, we 
have completed the recruitment of all 3 groups of volunteers. We expect to 
complete data collection and analysis by February 2025.
CONCLUSIONS: The purpose of this study is to compare improvements in brain 
perceptual motor functions and cognitive levels across different populations 
through response ability training and to explore the efficacy and safety of 
exercise-based nonpharmacological therapies in improving cognitive function. 
Other potential benefits include understanding the functional differences and 
perceptual characteristics of the brain's perceptual-motor system between 
athletes and the general population and exploring the adaptability of the brain 
in acquiring skills during competitive sports training. This could provide an 
evidence base for early sports talent development and broader youth development.

BACKGROUND: Blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown is associated with 
neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) 
is also common in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH). Biomarkers in 
the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may reflect the severity of neuropathological 
damage and indicate a relationship between BBB integrity and iNPH and its 
surgical outcome. The authors investigated the association of CSVD and 
comorbidity-related CSF biomarkers with shunt outcomes in iNPH.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective cohort study recruited 53 patients with 
iNPH, who were subgrouped by CSVD severity. CSF proteins were analyzed, 
including soluble platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β (sPDGFR-β), 
Alzheimer's disease biomarkers, neurofilament light chain (NfL), and triggering 
receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (Trem2). We assessed symptom improvement, 
investigated its association with biomarkers levels, calculated protein cutoffs 
for surgical outcomes using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and 
compared model predictions using different proteins through hierarchical 
regression analysis.
RESULTS: Among patients with iNPH, 74% had comorbid CSVD. Patients with severe 
CSVD exhibited significantly higher sPDGFR-β levels ( P =0.019) and better 
postoperative performance (β=0.332, t=2.174, P =0.039; r =0.573, P =0.001). 
Analysis of the predictive potential of the biomarkers showed that sPDGFR-β was 
predictive of surgical outcomes (area under curve=0.82, sensitivity=66.8%, 
specificity=94.7%). A Comparison of the models revealed a greater effect of 
sPDGFR-β (Adjusted R 2 =0.247, ∆R 2 =0.160, ∆F(1, 37)=8.238, P =0.007) on 
cognitive improvement.
CONCLUSION: This study highlighted the relevance of CSF biomarkers in assessing 
CSVD severity and predicting iNPH surgical outcomes. CSF shunt surgery may 
provide an alternative treatment for neurodegenerative diseases with BBB 
breakdown and dysfunctional CSF clearance.

INTRODUCTION: Racial and ethnic disparities in potentially inappropriate 
medication (PIM) use among older adults with dementia are unclear.
METHODS: Data were drawn from the baseline visits of participants who 
were ≥60 years old and diagnosed with dementia in the National Alzheimer's 
Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set (NACCUDS) recruited from National Institute 
on Aging (NIA)-funded Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers (ADCs) throughout the 
United States. PIM utilization was evaluated using the 2019 American Geriatrics 
Society Beers Criteria for PIM Use in Older Adults. We estimated the association 
between race and ethnicity and the following outcomes and estimation models: (1) 
any PIM use, any PIM in each drug class, and any PIM best avoided in dementia 
patients using logistic regression models, (2) total number of medications, 
total number of PIMs, and anticholinergic burden scale (ACBS) using Poisson or 
negative binomial regression models, and (3) proportion of total medications 
that were PIMs using generalized linear models (GLM).
RESULTS: Compared to White participants, Black, Hispanic, and Asian participants 
reported taking fewer total medications (incidence rate ratio [IRR] ± standard 
error[SE] = 0.903 ± 0.017, 0.875 ± 0.021, and 0.912 ± 0.041, respectively, all 
p < 0.01). Asian participants were less likely to be exposed to any PIM (odds 
ratio [OR] ± SE = 0.619 ± 0.118, p < 0.05). Compared to White participants, 
Black participants were less likely to be exposed to benzodiazepine 
(OR ± SE = 0.609 ± 0.094, p < 0.01) and antidepressant (OR ± SE = 0.416 ± 0.103, 
p < 0.001) PIMs, but greater antipsychotic (OR ± SE = 1.496 ± 0.204, p < 0.01), 
cardiovascular (OR ± SE = 2.193 ± 0.255, p < 0.001), and skeletal muscle 
relaxant (OR ± SE = 2.977 ± 0.860, p < 0.001) PIMs. Hispanic participants were 
exposed to greater skeletal muscle relaxant PIMs and had lower anticholinergic 
burden. Asian participants were exposed to fewer benzodiazepine PIMs.
DISCUSSION: Significant racial and ethnic disparities in exposure to PIMs and 
PIMs by medication category in dementia research participants who have access to 
dementia experts found in the study suggest that disparities may be wider in the 
larger community.

INTRODUCTION: CT1812 is in clinical development for the treatment of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) exploratory proteomics was employed to 
identify pharmacodynamic biomarkers of CT1812 in mild to moderate AD from two 
independent clinical trials.
METHODS: Unbiased analysis of tandem-mass tag mass spectrometry (TMT-MS) 
quantitative proteomics, pathway analysis and correlation analyses with 
volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (vMRI) were performed for the SPARC cohort 
(NCT03493282). Comparative analyses and a meta-analysis with the interim SHINE 
cohort (NCT03507790; SHINE-A) followed by network analysis (weighted gene 
co-expression network analysis [WGCNA]) were used to understand the biological 
impact of CT1812.
RESULTS: CT1812 pharmacodynamic biomarkers and biological pathways were 
identified that replicate across two clinical cohorts. The meta-analysis 
revealed novel candidate biomarkers linked to S2R biology and AD, and network 
analysis revealed treatment-associated networks driven by S2R.  DISCUSSION: 
Early clinical validation of CT1812 candidate biomarkers replicating in 
independent cohorts strengthens the understanding of the biological impact of 
CT1812 in patients with AD, and supports CT1812's synaptoprotective mechanism of 
action and its continued clinical development.
HIGHLIGHTS: This exploratory proteomics study identified candidate biomarkers of 
CT1812 in SPARC (NCT03493282) Comparative analyses identified biomarkers 
replicating across trials/cohorts Two independent Ph2 trial cohorts (SPARC and 
interim SHINE [NCT03507790; SHINE-A]) were used in a meta-analysis Amyloid beta 
(Aβ) & synaptic biology impacted by CT1812 and volumetric magnetic resonance 
imaging (vMRI) treatment-related correlates emerge Network analyses revealed 
sigma-2 receptor (S2R)-interacting proteins that may be "drivers" of changes.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Although extreme heat events disproportionately 
affect older adults and the importance of cognition is known, research examining 
older adult cognition under heat stress is limited. This study examines the 
relationship between risk/protective factors and heat strain on older adult 
cognition, employing a social-ecological model.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Retrieved from the 1996-2016 waves of the Health 
and Retirement Study, our study used older adults aged 50 and older and their 
spouses residing in the United States. Individual-fixed effects models estimated 
changes in cognition as measured by fluid and crystallized intelligence scores 
in response to extreme heat days. This study further estimated interactions of 
extreme heat with protective/risk factors for cognition (i.e., education, 
physical activity, social engagement, and genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease).
RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that extreme heat days were associated with 
fluid but not crystallized intelligence scores. Educational attainment, mild 
physical activity, and social contacts with children moderated this 
relationship. Furthermore, Alzheimer's disease polygenic scores moderated the 
correlation between extreme heat days and crystallized intelligence scores.
DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: An increasing frequency of extreme heat events and 
an aging population globally highlight the need for policies and interventions 
building resiliency in older adults. Actions promoting the protective modifiable 
behaviors to older adult cognition identified by our study can lead to healthier 
individuals and communities.

Introduction: The gut microbiota (MB), although one of the main producers of Aβ 
in the body, in physiological conditions contributes to the maintainance of a 
healthy brain. Dysbiosis, the dysbalance between Gram-negative and Gram-positive 
bacteria in the MB increases Aβ production, contributing to the accumulation of 
Aβ plaques in the brain, the main histopathological hallmark of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). Administration of prebiotics and probiotics, maintaining or 
recovering gut-MB composition, could represent a nutraceutical strategy to 
prevent or reduce AD sympthomathology. Aim of this research was to evaluate 
whether treatment with pre- and probiotics could modify the histopathological 
signs of neurodegeneration in hippocampal CA1 and CA3 areas of a transgenic 
mouse model of AD (APP/PS1 mice). The hippocampus is one of the brain regions 
involved in AD. Methods: Tg mice and Wt littermates (Wt-T and Tg-T) were fed 
daily for 6 months from 2 months of age with a diet supplemented with prebiotics 
(a multi-extract of fibers and plant complexes, containing 
inulin/fruit-oligosaccharides) and probiotics (a 50%-50% mixture of 
Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Lactobacillus paracasei). Controls were Wt and Tg 
mice fed with a standard diet. Brain sections were immunostained for Aβ plaques, 
neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and inflammatory proteins that were evaluated 
qualitatively and quantitatively by immunofluorescence, confocal microscopy and 
digital imaging with ImageJ software. Results: Quantitative analyses 
demonstrated that: 1) The treatment with pre- and probiotics significantly 
decreased Aβ plaques in CA3, while in CA1 the reduction was not significant; 2) 
Neuronal damage in CA1 Stratum Pyramidalis was significantly prevented in Tg-T 
mice; no damage was found in CA3; 3) In both CA1 and CA3 the treatment 
significantly increased astrocytes density, and GFAP and IBA1 expression, 
especially around plaques; 4) Microglia reacted differently in CA1 and CA3: in 
CA3 of Tg-T mice there was a significant increase of CD68+ phagocytic microglia 
(ball-and-chain phenomic) and of CX3CR1 compared with CA1. Discussion: The 
higher microglia reactivity could be responsible for their more efficient 
scavenging activity towards Aβ plaques in CA3 in comparison to CA1. Treatment 
with pre- and probiotics, modifying many of the physiopathological hallmarks of 
AD, could be considered an effective nutraceutical strategy against AD 
symptomatology.

The relationship between amyloid beta (Aβ) and oxidative stress (OS), both 
prominent factors in Alzheimer's disease-related neural degeneration, is deeply 
interconnected. The cleavage of the extracellular domain of Amyloid precursor 
protein (APP) and phosphorylating different substrates, respectively, the β-site 
amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE-1) and Glycogen synthase 
kinase-3-beta (GSK-3β) enzymes initiate the synthesis of Aβ, which causes 
cognitive deficits in AD. This study aimed to explore the protective potential 
of Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10). It also sought to uncover any synergistic effects when 
combined with donepezil, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, in treating 
Alzheimer's disease in male albino rats, focusing on the modulation of the 
BACE-1/GSK-3β pathway. The experiment involved 70 rats categorized into 
different groups: control, donepezil alone, CoQ10 alone, AD-model, donepezil 
co-treatment, CoQ10 co-treatment, and CoQ10 + donepezil combination. Various 
assessments, such as cholinesterase activity, oxidative stress, serum iron 
profile, Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), Tau protein, β-site amyloid 
precursor protein cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE-1), phosphatase and tensin homolog 
(Pten), and Glycogen synthase kinase-3-beta (GSK-3β), were conducted on 
behavioral and biochemical aspects. CoQ10 treatment demonstrated memory 
improvement, enhanced locomotion, and increased neuronal differentiation, mainly 
through the inhibition of the dual BACE-1/GSK-3β. These findings were 
substantiated by histological and immunohistological examinations of the 
hippocampus.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD), characterized by the ongoing deterioration 
of neural function, often presents alongside depressive features and greatly 
affects the quality of life of individuals living with the condition. Although 
several treatment methods exist, their efficacy is limited. In recent years, 
repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) utilizing the theta burst 
stimulation (TBS) mode, specifically the intermittent TBS (iTBS), has 
demonstrated promising therapeutic potential in the management of 
neuropsychiatric disorders.
AIM: To examine the therapeutic efficacy of iTBS mode of rTMS for treating 
depressive symptoms in patients with AD.
METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled 105 individuals diagnosed with AD 
with depressive symptoms at Huzhou Third Municipal Hospital, affiliated with 
Huzhou University, between January 2020 and December 2023. Participants received 
standard pharmacological interventions and were categorized into control (n = 
53) and observation (n = 52) groups based on treatment protocols. The 
observation group received iTBS mode of rTMS, while the control group received 
pseudo-stimulation. A comparative analysis evaluated psychological well-being, 
adverse events, and therapeutic at initiation of hospitalization (T0) and 15 
days post-treatment (T1).
RESULTS: At T1, both groups exhibited a marked reduction in self-rating 
depression scale and Hamilton depression scale scores compared to T0. 
Furthermore, the observation group showed a more pronounced decrease than the 
control group. By T1, the Mini-mental state examination scores for both groups 
had increased markedly from their initial T0 assessments. Importantly, the 
increase was particularly more substantial in the observation group than in the 
control group. Fourteen patients in the control group had ineffective treatment 
effects, while five patients in the observation group experienced the same. 
Additionally, the observation group experienced a substantially reduced 
incidence of ineffective treatment as compared to the control group (both P < 
0.05); there were no recorded serious adverse events in either group.
CONCLUSION: The iTBS model of rTMS effectively treated AD with depression, 
improving depressive symptoms and cognitive function in patients without serious 
adverse reactions, warranting clinical consideration.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, is 
marked by beta-amyloid plaque accumulation and cognitive decline. The limited 
efficacy and significant side effects of anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody 
therapies have prompted exploration into innovative treatments like focused 
ultrasound therapy. Focused ultrasound shows promise as a non-invasive technique 
for disrupting the blood-brain barrier, potentially enhancing drug delivery 
directly to the brain and improving the penetration of existing therapeutic 
agents.
METHODS: This systematic review was conducted using PubMed and Embase databases, 
focusing on studies published in the last ten years that examined the use of 
low-intensity focused ultrasound for blood-brain barrier disruption in 
Alzheimer's disease. The search strategy encompassed terms related to 
Alzheimer's disease, focused ultrasound, and the blood-brain barrier. Studies 
were selected based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The quality 
of included studies was assessed using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based 
Medicine Levels of Evidence framework.
RESULTS: Twelve studies were analyzed, the results of which suggested that low 
intensity focused ultrasound when combined with microbubbles may safely and 
transiently disrupt the blood-brain barrier. These studies, primarily 
early-phase and observational, highlight the potential feasibility of focused 
ultrasound in facilitating drug delivery to the brain for the treatment of 
Alzheimer's disease. Notably, one study reported positive impacts on cognitive 
tests, suggesting potential direct therapeutic effects of focused ultrasound 
beyond blood-brain barrier disruption.
CONCLUSION: The results of the included studies indicate the use of focused 
ultrasound in Alzheimer's disease treatment might be safe and effective in 
transiently opening the blood-brain barrier. Although current evidence is 
promising, further research is needed to establish generalizability. Future 
studies should also aim to further elucidate the mechanisms of action of 
low-intensity focused ultrasound as well as microbubbles for blood-brain barrier 
opening and explore potential clinical benefits beyond blood-brain barrier 
opening such as impacts on cognitive outcomes. Future studies should also aim 
for greater participant diversity to ensure findings are applicable across the 
full spectrum of Alzheimer's disease patients.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of a multicomponent 
psychotherapy programme for people with mild Alzheimer's dementia (AD) and their 
caregivers on depression and related neuropsychiatric symptoms.
METHOD: The cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)-based treatment consisted of 25 
weekly sessions, including behavioural activation, behaviour management, 
interventions for the caregiver, reminiscence, couples counselling, and 
cognitive restructuring. 41 participants and their caregivers were randomised to 
either the CBT or the control group, which received treatment-as-usual (TAU). 
Follow-ups took place at 6 and 12 months posttreatment. The primary outcome was 
depression in the patient with AD. The secondary outcomes were apathy, other 
neuropsychiatric symptoms, functional abilities, quality of life, and quality of 
the relationship with the caregiver.
RESULTS: Linear mixed models revealed a statistically significant superiority of 
CBT regarding clinician-rated depression at the 12-month follow-up with large 
effect sizes (within-subject d = 1.22, between-subject d = 1.00). Effect sizes 
were only moderate for self-rated depression and small for informant-rated 
depression. There was also a significant advantage for CBT regarding 
clinician-rated apathy, relationship quality, and informant-rated quality of 
life (QoL) but not for the other neuropsychiatric symptoms or self-rated QoL.
CONCLUSION: The results are very encouraging and support an adequately powered 
multicentre study.

Multiple Adverse Reactions Associated With the Use of Second-Generation 
Antipsychotics in People With Alzheimer's Disease: A Pharmacovigilance Analysis 
Based on the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition leading to 
memory loss, cognitive impairment, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. 
Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) are commonly used to manage these 
neuropsychiatric symptoms, but their safety profile in patients with AD requires 
further investigation.
OBJECTIVE: The objective was to evaluate the safety of SGAs in patients with AD 
by analyzing adverse drug reactions (ADRs) using the US Food and Drug 
Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database.
METHODS: This study conducted a comprehensive analysis of FAERS data from 2014 
to 2023, focusing on ADRs in patients with AD treated with SGAs such as 
risperidone, quetiapine, olanzapine, clozapine, and aripiprazole. Descriptive, 
disproportionality, time, and dose analysis were performed using the Bayesian 
confidence propagation neural network, Weibull, and physiologically based 
pharmacokinetic model.
RESULTS: Out of 1289 patients with AD treated with SGAs, the most common ADRs 
involved the nervous system, gastrointestinal system, and cardiac disorders. 
Disproportionality analysis identified significant positive signals in cardiac, 
renal, and vascular systems. Quetiapine, risperidone, and olanzapine showed more 
positive signals compared with clozapine and aripiprazole. Time analysis 
indicated that cardiovascular ADRs occurred randomly, whereas renal ADRs 
increased with prolonged use. Dose analysis suggested that small doses of SGAs 
did not elevate the risk of multiple cardiac, renal, or vascular ADRs.
CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: The study underscores the importance of monitoring for 
ADRs, particularly in the cardiac and renal systems, when using SGAs in patients 
with AD. Future research incorporating more comprehensive clinical data is 
warranted to support safe and rational drug utilization.

Dementia and cancer are multifactorial, widely-feared, age-associated clinical 
syndromes that are increasing in prevalence. There have been major breakthroughs 
in clinical cancer research leading to some effective treatments, whereas the 
field of dementia has achieved comparatively limited success in clinical 
research. The lessons of cancer research may help those in the dementia research 
field in confronting some of the dilemmas faced when the clinical care regimen 
is not entirely safe or efficacious. Cancer clinical trials have assumed that 
untreated individuals with cancer are at high risk for morbidity and mortality 
after primary diagnoses. Thus, patients deserve a choice of clinical 
interventions, either standard of care or experimental, even if the benefits are 
not certain and the therapy's side effects are potentially severe. The prognosis 
for many individuals at risk for dementia carries a correspondingly high level 
of risk for both mortality and severe morbidity, particularly if one focuses on 
"health-span" rather than lifespan. Caregivers and patients can be strongly 
impacted by dementia and the many troubling associated symptoms that often go 
well beyond amnesia. Polls, surveys, and a literature on "dementia worry" 
strongly underscore that the public fears dementia. While there are 
institutional and industry hurdles that complicate enrollment in randomized 
trials, the gravity of the future morbidity and mortality inherent in a dementia 
diagnosis may require reconsideration of the current protective stance that 
limits the freedom of at-risk individuals (either symptomatic or asymptomatic) 
to participate and potentially benefit from ongoing clinical research. There is 
also evidence from both cancer and dementia research that individuals enrolled 
in the placebo arms of clinical trials have unexpectedly good outcomes, 
indicating that participation in clinical trial can have medical benefits to 
enrollees. To highlight aspects of cancer clinical research that may inform 
present and future dementia clinical research, this review highlights three main 
themes: the risk of side effects should be weighed against the often dire 
consequences of non-treatment; the desirability of long-term incremental (rather 
than "magic bullet") clinical advances; and, the eventual importance of 
combination therapies, reflecting that the dementia clinical syndrome has many 
underlying biological pathways.

Despite advances in antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory treatment, inflammation 
and its consequences remain a major challenge in the field of medicine. 
Inflammatory reactions can lead to life-threatening conditions such as septic 
shock, while chronic inflammation has the potential to worsen the condition of 
body tissues and ultimately lead to significant impairment of their 
functionality. Although the central nervous system has long been considered 
immune privileged to peripheral immune responses, recent research has shown that 
strong immune responses in the periphery also affect the brain, leading to 
reactive microglia, which belong to the innate immune system and reside in the 
brain, and neuroinflammation. The inflammatory response is primarily a 
protective mechanism to defend against pathogens and tissue damage. However, 
excessive and chronic inflammation can have negative effects on neuronal 
structure and function. Neuroinflammation underlies the pathogenesis of many 
neurological and neurodegenerative diseases and can accelerate their 
progression. Consequently, targeting inflammatory signaling pathways offers 
potential therapeutic strategies for various neuropathological conditions, 
particularly Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, by curbing inflammation. Here 
the blood-brain barrier is a major hurdle for potential therapeutic strategies, 
therefore it would be highly advantageous to foster and utilize brain innate 
anti-inflammatory mechanisms. The tricarboxylic acid cycle-derived metabolite 
itaconate is highly upregulated in activated macrophages and has been shown to 
act as an immunomodulator with anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial functions. 
Mesaconate, an isomer of itaconate, similarly reduces the inflammatory response 
in macrophages. Nevertheless, most studies have focused on its esterified forms 
and its peripheral effects, while its influence on the CNS remained largely 
unexplored. Therefore, this study investigated the immunomodulatory and 
therapeutic potential of endogenously synthesized itaconate and its isomer 
mesaconate in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammatory processes. Our 
results show that both itaconate and mesaconate reduce LPS-induced 
neuroinflammation, as evidenced by lower levels of inflammatory mediators, 
reduced microglial reactivity and a rescue of synaptic plasticity, the cellular 
correlate of learning and memory processes in the brain. Overall, this study 
emphasizes that both itaconate and mesaconate have therapeutic potential for 
neuroinflammatory processes in the brain and are of remarkable importance due to 
their endogenous origin and production, which usually leads to high tolerance.

Xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibitors, both synthetic and semisynthetic, have been 
developed extensively over the past few decades. The increased level of XO is 
not only the major cause of gout but is also responsible for various conditions 
associated with hyperuricemia, such as cardiovascular disorders, chronic kidney 
disorders, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease and chronic wounds. Marketed available 
XO inhibitors (allopurinol, febuxostat, and topiroxostat) are used to treat 
hyperuricemia but they are associated with fatal side effects, which pose 
serious problems for the healthcare system, rising the need for new, more 
potent, safer compounds. This review summarizes recent findings on XO and 
describes their design, synthesis, biological significance in the development of 
anti-hyperuricemic drugs with ADME profile, structure activity relationship 
(SAR) and molecular docking studies. The results might help medicinal chemists 
to develop more efficacious XO inhibitors.

Neurofilament light chain (NFL) is elevated in neurodegenerative diseases, 
including Parkinson's disease (PD). This study aimed to investigate serum NFL in 
newly diagnosed PD and its association with cognitive and motor decline over 10 
years. Serum NFL levels were measured in PD patients and controls from the 
ParkWest study at diagnosis (baseline) and after 3 and 5 years. Mixed-effects 
regression analyzed changes in NFL and the association with annual changes in 
MMSE and UPDRS-III scores over 10 years. PD patients had elevated serum NFL at 
all visits and a faster annual increase over 5 years compared to controls 
(0.09 pg/mL per year; p = 0.029). Higher baseline NFL predicted faster cognitive 
decline β -0.77 transformed MMSE; p = 0.010), and a 40% NFL increase predicted 
future motor decline (β 0.28 UPDRS-III; p = 0.004). Elevated serum NFL in early 
PD is linked to faster cognitive and motor impairment, suggesting its prognostic 
value in PD biomarker panels.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is difficult to 
cure and of global concern. Neuroinflammation is closely associated with the 
onset and progression of AD, making its treatment increasingly important. 
Compounds from natural products, with fewer side effects than synthetic drugs, 
are of high research interest. STAT3, a multifunctional transcription factor, is 
involved in various cellular processes including inflammation, cell growth, and 
apoptosis. Its activation and inhibition can have different effects under 
various pathological conditions. In AD, the STAT3 protein plays a crucial role 
in promoting neuroinflammation and contributing to disease progression. This 
occurs primarily through the JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway, which impacts 
microglia, astrocytes, and hippocampal neurons. This paper reviews the STAT3 
signaling pathway in AD and 25 compounds targeting STAT3 up to 2024. Notably, 
Rutin, Paeoniflorin, and Geniposide up-regulate STAT3 in hippocampal and cortex 
neurons, showing neuroprotective effects in various AD models. Other 23 
compounds downregulate AD by suppressing neuroinflammation through inhibition of 
STAT3 activation in microglia and astrocytes. These findings highlight the 
potential of compounds from natural products in improving AD by targeting STAT3, 
offering insights into the prevention and management of AD.

Our aim was to find out whether speech-related temporal parameters (SRTPs) are 
sensitive indicators of the clinical outcome in acetylcholinesterase (AChE) 
inhibitor therapy with donepezil, compared to the standard cognitive Alzheimer's 
Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) used in clinical trials. 
In this 24-week-long, naturalistic, self-control, open-labeled, prospective 
pilot study with 10 mg donepezil on 20 mild AD patients, cognitive functions 
were evaluated using 15 different SRTPs analyzed by automatic speech recognition 
in the Speech-Gap Test® compared to ADAS-Cog test results. Among the SRTPs, the 
filled pause duration ratio significantly improved after 12 weeks of donepezil 
treatment. During the 24-week follow-up, additional SRTPs such as the filled 
pause count ratio and the filled pause frequency showed significant benefits. 
ADAS-Cog total scores showed a slight but not significant improvement compared 
to baseline after 12 and 24 weeks of donepezil treatment. Among the ADAS-Cog 
subtests, only orientation improved significantly after 24 weeks of donepezil 
treatment. Our results indicate that subtle changes in SRTPs measured by the 
Speech-Gap Test® could be considered as sensitive indicators of the efficacy of 
the pharmacotherapy in mild AD. According to our data, other cognitive domains 
did not show improvement in response to donepezil therapy rating by ADAS-Cog. 
Based on all of this, it is likely that examining and evaluating speech 
parameters may play an important role in determining the effects of 
pharmacological treatment of mild AD. The novelty of our study is that it 
applies the measurement of linguistic parameters as primary outcomes during a 
drug trial of mild AD in scientific research for the first time.

Microneedle (MN) patches are gaining increasing attention as a cost-effective 
technology for delivering drugs directly into the skin. In the present study, 
two different 3D printing processes were utilized to produce coated MNs, namely, 
digital light processing (DLP) and semisolid extrusion (SSE). Donepezil (DN), a 
cholinesterase inhibitor administered for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, 
was incorporated into the coating material. Physiochemical characterization of 
the coated MNs confirmed the successful incorporation of donepezil as well as 
the stability and suitability of the materials for transdermal delivery. Optical 
microscopy and SEM studies validated the uniform weight distribution and precise 
dimensions of the MN arrays, while mechanical testing ensured the MNs' 
robustness, ensuring efficient skin penetration. In vitro studies were conducted 
to evaluate the produced transdermal patches, indicating their potential use in 
clinical treatment. Permeation studies revealed a significant increase in DN 
permeation compared to plain coating material, affirming the effectiveness of 
the MNs in enhancing transdermal drug delivery. Confocal laser scanning 
microscopy (CLSM) elucidated the distribution of the API, within skin layers, 
demonstrating sustained drug release and transcellular transport pathways. 
Finally, cell studies were also conducted on NIH3T3 fibroblasts to evaluate the 
biocompatibility and safety of the printed objects for transdermal applications.

Autoimmune hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease: unanswered question.

Arshavsky YI(1).

California, United States.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) was described more than a century ago. However, there 
are still no effective approaches to its treatment, which may suggest that the 
search for the cure is not being conducted in the most productive direction. AD 
begins as selective impairments of declarative memory with no deficits in other 
cognitive functions. Therefore, understanding of the AD pathogenesis has to 
include the understanding of this selectivity. Currently, the main efforts aimed 
at prevention and treatment of AD are based on the dominating hypothesis for the 
AD pathogenesis: the amyloid hypothesis. But this hypothesis does not explain 
selective memory impairments since β-amyloid accumulates extracellularly and 
should be toxic to all types of cerebral neurons, not only to "memory engram 
neurons." To explain selective memory impairment, I propose the autoimmune 
hypothesis of AD, based on the analysis of risk factors for AD and molecular 
mechanisms of memory formation. Memory formation is associated with epigenetic 
modifications of chromatin in memory engram neurons and, therefore, might be 
accompanied by the expression of memory-specific proteins recognized by the 
adaptive immune system as "non-self" antigens. Normally, the brain is protected 
by the blood-brain barrier (BBB). All risk factors for AD provoke BBB 
disruptions, possibly leading to an autoimmune reaction against memory engram 
neurons. This reaction would make them selectively sensitive to tauopathy. If 
this hypothesis is confirmed, the strategies for AD prevention and treatment 
would be radically changed.

BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment is projected to affect a preponderant 
proportion of the aging population. Lifelong dietary habits have been 
hypothesized to play a role in preventing cognitive decline. Among the most 
studied dietary components, fish consumptionhas been extensively studied for its 
potential effects on the human brain.
AIMS: To perform a meta-analysis of observational studies exploring the 
association between fish intake and cognitive impairment/decline and all types 
of dementia.
METHODS: A systematic search of electronic databases was performed to identify 
observational studies providing quantitative data on fish consumption and 
outcomes of interest. Random effects models for meta-analyses using only extreme 
exposure categories, subgroup analyses, and dose-response analyses were 
performed to estimate cumulative risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs).
RESULTS: The meta-analysis comprised 35 studies. Individuals reporting the 
highest vs. the lowest fish consumption were associated with a lower likelihood 
of cognitive impairment/decline (RR = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.75, 0.90, I2 = 61.1%), 
dementia (RR = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.73, 0.93, I2 = 38.7%), and Alzheimer's disease 
(RR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.67, 0.96, I2 = 20.3%). The dose-response relation revealed 
a significantly decreased risk of cognitive impairment/decline and all cognitive 
outcomes across higher levels of fish intake up to 30% for 150 g/d (RR = 0.70, 
95% CI: 0.52, 0.95). The results of this relation based on APOE ε4 allele status 
was mixed based on the outcome investigated.
CONCLUSIONS: Current findings suggest fish consumption is associated with a 
lower risk of cognitive impairment/decline in a dose-response manner, while for 
dementia and Alzheimer's disease there is a need for further studies to improve 
the strength of evidence.

BACKGROUND: Inhibition of p38 alpha mitogen activated protein kinase (p38α) has 
shown great promise as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD) in preclinical 
tests. However, previous preclinical studies were performed in "pure" models of 
AD pathology. A vast majority of AD patients have comorbid dementia-contributing 
pathologies, particularly some form of vascular damage. The present study 
therefore aimed to test the potential of p38α inhibition to address dysfunction 
in the context of comorbid amyloid and vascular pathologies.
METHODS: An amyloid overexpressing mouse strain (5xFAD) was placed on an 8-week 
long diet to induce the hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) model of small vessel 
disease. Mice were treated with the brain-penetrant small molecule p38α 
inhibitor MW150 for the duration of the HHcy diet, and subsequently underwent 
behavioral, neuroimaging, electrophysiological, or 
biochemical/immunohistochemical analyses.
RESULTS: MW150 successfully reduced behavioral impairment in the Morris Water 
Maze, corresponding with attenuation of synaptic loss, reduction in tau 
phosphorylation, and a partial normalization of electrophysiological parameters. 
No effect of MW150 was observed on the amyloid, vascular, or neuroinflammatory 
endpoints measured.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides proof-of-principle that the inhibition of p38α 
is able to provide benefit even in the context of mixed pathological 
contributions to cognitive impairment. Interestingly, the benefit was mediated 
primarily via rescue of neuronal function without any direct effects on the 
primary pathologies. These data suggest a potential use for p38 inhibitors in 
the preservation of cognition across contexts, and in particular AD, either 
alone or as an adjunct to other AD therapies (i.e. anti-amyloid approaches). 
Future studies to delineate the precise neuronal pathways implicated in the 
benefit may help define other specific comorbid conditions amenable to this type 
of approach or suggest future refinement in pharmacological targeting.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Exposure to repetitive head impacts (RHI) is linked 
to the development of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), which can only be 
diagnosed at post-mortem. The presence of a cavum septum pellucidum (CSP) is a 
common finding in post-mortem studies of confirmed CTE and in neuroimaging 
studies of individuals exposed to RHI. This study examines CSP in living former 
American football players, investigating its association with RHI exposure, 
traumatic encephalopathy syndrome (TES) diagnosis, and provisional levels of 
certainty for CTE pathology.
METHODS: Data from the DIAGNOSE CTE Research Project were used to compare the 
presence and ratio of CSP in former American football players (n = 175), 
consisting of former college (n = 58) and former professional players (n = 117), 
and asymptomatic unexposed controls without RHI exposure (n = 55). We further 
evaluated potential associations between CSP measures and cumulative head impact 
index (CHII) measures (frequency, linear acceleration, and rotational force), a 
TES diagnosis (yes/no), and a provisional level of certainty for CTE pathology 
(suggestive, possible, and probable).
RESULTS: Former American football players exhibited a higher CSP presence and 
ratio than unexposed asymptomatic controls. Among player subgroups, professional 
players showed a greater CSP ratio than former college players and unexposed 
asymptomatic controls. Among all football players, CHII rotational forces 
correlated with an increased CSP ratio. No significant associations were found 
between CSP measures and diagnosis of TES or provisional levels of certainty for 
CTE pathology.
DISCUSSION: This study confirms previous findings, highlighting a greater 
prevalence of CSP and a greater CSP ratio in former American football players 
compared with unexposed asymptomatic controls. In addition, former professional 
players showed a greater CSP ratio than college players. Moreover, the 
relationship between estimates of CHII rotational forces and CSP measures 
suggests that cumulative frequency and strength of rotational forces experienced 
in football are associated with CSP. However, CSP does not directly correlate 
with TES diagnosis or provisional levels of certainty for CTE, indicating that 
it may be a consequence of RHI associated with rotational forces. Further 
research, especially longitudinal studies, is needed for confirmation and to 
explore changes over time.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurological disorder that increases with age and 
must be treated immediately by worldwide healthcare systems. Internal 
neurofibrillary tau tangles and extracellular amyloid accumulation have been 
widely recognized as the primary causes of Alzheimer's disease. These 
degenerative age-related ailments are expected to proliferate exponentially as 
life expectancy rises. Experimental models of AD are essential for acquiring a 
deep knowledge of its pathogenesis and determining the viability of novel 
therapy options. Although there isn't a model that encompasses all the 
characteristics of real AD, these models are nonetheless highly helpful for the 
research of various modifications associated with it, even though they are only 
partially indicative of the disease circumstances being studied. Better 
knowledge of the advantages and disadvantages of each of the different models, 
as well as the use of more than one model to evaluate potential medications, 
would increase the effectiveness of therapy translation from preclinical 
research to patients. We outline the pathogenic characteristics and limitations 
of the main experimental models of AD in this review, including transgenic mice, 
transgenic rats, primates and non-primate models along with in-vitro cell 
culture models in humans. Additionally, it highlights the possible future of 
experimental modeling of AD and includes the co-morbid models.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder that primarily 
impacts cognitive function. Currently there are no disease-modifying treatments 
to stop or slow its progression. Recent studies have found that several 
peripheral and systemic abnormalities are associated with AD, and our 
understanding of how these alterations contribute to AD is becoming more 
apparent. In this review, we focuse on amyloid‑beta (Aβ), a major hallmark of 
AD, summarizing recent findings on the source of brain-derived Aβ and discussing 
where and how the brain-derived Aβ is cleared in vivo. Based on these findings, 
we propose future strategies for AD prevention and treatment, from a novel 
perspective on Aβ metabolism.

Both wild-type and mutant tau proteins can misfold into prions and 
self-propagate in the central nervous system of animals and people. To extend 
the work of others, we investigated the molecular basis of tau prion-mediated 
neurodegeneration in transgenic (Tg) rats expressing mutant human tau (P301S); 
this line of Tg rats is denoted Tg12099. We used the rat Prnp promoter to drive 
the overexpression of mutant tau (P301S) in the human 0N4R isoform. In 
Tg12099(+/+) rats homozygous for the transgene, ubiquitous expression of mutant 
human tau resulted in the progressive accumulation of phosphorylated tau 
inclusions, including silver-positive tangles in the frontal cortices and limbic 
system. Signs of central nervous system dysfunction were found in terminal 
Tg12099(+/+) rats exhibiting severe neurodegeneration and profound atrophy of 
the amygdala and piriform cortex. The greatest increases in tau prion activity 
were found in the corticolimbic structures. In contrast to the homozygous 
Tg12099(+/+) rats, we found lower levels of mutant tau in the hemizygous rats, 
resulting in few neuropathologic changes up to 2 years of age. Notably, these 
hemizygous rats could be infected by intracerebral inoculation with recombinant 
tau fibrils or precipitated tau prions from the brain homogenates of sick, aged 
homozygous Tg12099(+/+) rats. Our studies argue that the regional propagation of 
tau prions and neurodegeneration in the Tg12099 rats resembles that found in 
human primary tauopathies. These findings seem likely to advance our 
understanding of human tauopathies and may lead to effective therapeutics for 
Alzheimer's disease and other tau prion disorders.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) act as mediators for intercellular transfer of Aβ 
and tau proteins, promoting the propagation of these pathological misfolded 
proteins throughout the brain in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Levels of blood 
exosomal Aβ42, total Tau (t-Tau) and phosphorylated Tau (p-Tau) had a high 
correlation with their concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), 
demonstrating that exosomal biomarkers have equal contribution as those in CSF 
for the diagnosis of AD. We aimed to comprehensively characterize the proteome 
of plasma-derived EVs to identify differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) and 
pathways in AD. Tandem mass tag (TMT) labeled quantitative proteomics was 
applied to analyze plasma-derived EV proteins in 9 AD patients and 9 healthy 
controls. 335 proteins were quantified, and 12 DEPs were identified including 
seven upregulated proteins and five down-regulated proteins. Oligomerized Aβ1-42 
induced SH-SY5Y cell damage model was built to mimic the pathological changes of 
AD, and small interfering RNA (siRNA) against S100A8 was used to knock down 
S100A8 expression. Results displayed S100A8 was down regulated in plasma-derived 
EVs from AD patients, while enriched in EVs derived from Aβ1-42-induced SH-SY5Y 
cells. Furthermore, Aβ1-42-induced SH-SY5Y cells treated with S100A8 siRNA 
showed decreased Aβ levels in cell lysate and EVs, especially in EVs. 
SIGNIFICANCE: The investigation aimed to comprehensively characterize the 
proteome of plasma-derived EVs to identify DEPs and potential biomarker of AD. 
S100A8 was found down regulated in plasma-derived EVs from AD patients using TMT 
labeled quantitative proteomics. The diagnostic value of S100A8 was also 
confirmed using receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis. 
Furthermore, Aβ1-42-induced SH-SY5Y cells treated with S100A8 siRNA showed 
decreased Aβ levels in cell lysate and EVs, especially in EVs. The preliminary 
findings suggest that suppression of S100A8 expression inhibits Aβ aggregation 
both in cell lysate and EVs from Aβ1-42-induced SH-SY5Y cells, and S100A8 more 
likely regulates Aβ aggregation via EVs. Therefore, plasma-derived EV S100A8 
might be a potential biomarker of AD. Manipulation of S100A8 expression may be a 
novel therapeutic strategy in the treatment of AD.

The triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2 (TREM2), a pivotal innate 
immune receptor, orchestrates functions such as inflammatory responses, 
phagocytosis, cell survival, and neuroprotection. TREM2 variants R47H and R62H 
have been associated with Alzheimer's disease, yet the underlying mechanisms 
remain elusive. Our previous research established that TREM2 binds to heparan 
sulfate (HS) and variants R47H and R62H exhibit reduced affinity for HS. 
Building upon this groundwork, our current study delves into the interplay 
between TREM2 and HS and its impact on microglial function. We confirm TREM2's 
binding to cell surface HS and demonstrate that TREM2 interacts with HS, forming 
HS-TREM2 binary complexes on microglia cell surfaces. Employing various 
biochemical techniques, including surface plasmon resonance, low molecular 
weight HS microarray screening, and serial HS mutant cell surface binding 
assays, we demonstrate TREM2's robust affinity for HS, and the effective binding 
requires a minimum HS size of approximately 10 saccharide units. Notably, TREM2 
selectively binds specific HS structures, with 6-O-sulfation and, to a lesser 
extent, the iduronic acid residue playing crucial roles. N-sulfation and 
2-O-sulfation are dispensable for this interaction. Furthermore, we reveal that 
6-O-sulfation is essential for HS-TREM2 ternary complex formation on the 
microglial cell surface, and HS and its 6-O-sulfation are necessary for 
TREM2-mediated ApoE3 uptake in microglia. By delineating the interaction between 
HS and TREM2 on the microglial cell surface and demonstrating its role in 
facilitating TREM2-mediated ApoE uptake by microglia, our findings provide 
valuable insights that can inform targeted interventions for modulating 
microglial functions in Alzheimer's disease.

The potential role of adenosine, a natural neuroprotective agent, and its 
receptors in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease has been proposed. The 
present study aims to examine the effect of administering both an A1 receptor 
agonist and an A2A adenosine receptor antagonist simultaneously on memory, 
inflammatory factors, and PSD-95 in an LPS-induced Alzheimer's disease model in 
rats. Fifty-six male Wistar rats were randomly divided into seven groups: 
Saline, LPS, Saline + Vehicle, LPS + Vehicle, LPS + SCH58261 (A2A receptor 
antagonist), LPS + CPA (A1 receptor agonist), LPS + SCH58261+CPA. LPS 
(3 mg/kg/ip) was used to cause memory impairment. Treatment was performed by 
intraventricular injection of CPA at a dose of 700 μg and SCH-58261 at 40 μg for 
ten days. Passive avoidance and Y-maze tests were performed to examine animals' 
memories. IL-10, TNF-α, and PSD-95 levels were measured in the brain using ELISA 
and western blot, respectively. Compared to the groups receiving each medication 
separately, the simultaneous administration of CPA and SCH58261 improved memory 
(P<0.05). Additionally, compared to the single medication groups, there was a 
significant increase in IL-10, PSD-95, and a significant decrease in TNF-α in 
the brain tissue (P<0.05). These findings suggest that the activation of A1 
receptors along with A2A receptor inhibition could be a potential therapeutic 
strategy for Alzheimer's disease. These findings suggest that A1 receptor 
activation combined with A2A receptor inhibition may be a promising therapeutic 
approach for Alzheimer's disease.

Aberrant energy metabolism in the brain is a common pathological feature in the 
preclinical Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Recent studies have reported the early 
elevations of glycolysis-involved enzymes in AD brain and cerebrospinal fluid 
according to a large-scale proteomic analysis. It's well-known that astrocytes 
exhibit strong glycolytic metabolic ability and play a key role in the 
regulation of brain homeostasis. However, its relationship with glycolytic 
changes and cognitive deficits in early AD patients is unclear. Here, we 
investigated the mechanisms by which astrocyte glycolysis is involved in early 
AD and its potential as a therapeutic target. Our results suggest that 
Aβ-activated microglia can induce glycolytic-enhanced astrocytes in vitro, and 
that these processes are dependent on the activation of the AKT-mTOR-HIF-1α 
pathway. In early AD models, the increase in L-lactate produced by enhanced 
glycolysis of astrocytes leads to spatial cognitive impairment by disrupting 
synaptic plasticity and accelerating Aβ aggregation. Furthermore, we find 
rapamycin, the mTOR inhibitor, can rescue the impaired spatial memory and Aβ 
burden by inhibiting the glycolysis-derived L-lactate in the early AD models. In 
conclusion, we highlight that astrocytic glycolysis plays a critical role in the 
early onset of AD and that the modulation of glycolysis-derived L-lactate by 
rapamycin provides a new strategy for the treatment of AD.

To analyze the expressional changes in the PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β pathway and 
metalloprotease in the cellular Alzheimer's Disease (AD) model with the effect 
of antioxidant resveratrol. Neuron-like cells were obtained by a two-step method 
of neuronal differentiation by using a combination of retinoic acid (RA) and 
brain-derived factor (BDNF) exposure. Then, the application of the amyloid beta 
peptide 25-35 (Aβ25-35) to the cell culture mimicked the environmental toxicity 
observed in AD. Afterward, cell viability and apoptosis assays were performed to 
determine whether the resveratrol exerts a cytotoxic and apoptotic effect. 
Finally, the expressional changes in genes in the cellular AD model with the 
effect of resveratrol were analyzed by Real-Time PCR. The analysis in silico was 
assessed using the STRING V12.0 database in each group. Apoptosis data findings 
were decreased by 1.5-fold and 2.5-fold respectively by 
Differentiated+Resveratrol (RES) and RES when compared to control but no 
significant difference was observed between RES and AD model groups. Real-time 
PCR analysis results revealed PI3K (3.38-fold), AKT (3.95-fold), and RELN 
(1.99-fold) expressions were significantly higher (p < .001), and also GSK-3β, 
TAU, ADAMTS-4, ADAMTS-5, and TIMP-3 gene expression levels were significantly 
downregulated (2.53-, 1.79-, 2.85-, 4.09-, and 6.62-fold, respectively) in the 
Differentiated+Aβ + RES groups compared to the Differentiated+Aβ group 
(p < .001). Network analysis shows the functional enrichment of 23 
Alzheimer-related GO terms in the Wnt signaling, proteolysis, and extracellular 
matrix organization pathways. Resveratrol has inhibited GSK-3β by activating the 
PI3K/Akt insulin pathway in a neurotoxic environment. In addition, TAU, RELN, 
metalloproteases, and their inhibitors associated with Alzheimer's pathology 
have been regulated supporting the neuroprotective effect of resveratrol.

In the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, the overexpression of glycogen 
synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) stands out due to its multifaced nature, as it 
contributes to the promotion of amyloid β and tau protein accumulation, as well 
as neuroinflammatory processes. Therefore, in the present study, we have 
designed, synthesized, and evaluated a new series of GSK-3β inhibitors based on 
the N-(pyridin-2-yl)cyclopropanecarboxamide scaffold. We identified compound 36, 
demonstrating an IC50 of 70 nM against GSK-3β. Subsequently, through 
crystallography studies and quantum mechanical analysis, we elucidated its 
binding mode and identified the structural features crucial for interactions 
with the active site of GSK-3β, thereby understanding its inhibitory potency. 
Compound 36 was effective in the cellular model of hyperphosphorylated 
tau-induced neurodegeneration, where it restored cell viability after okadaic 
acid treatment and showed anti-inflammatory activity in the LPS model, 
significantly reducing NO, IL-6, and TNF-α release. In ADME-tox in vitro 
studies, we confirmed the beneficial profile of 36, including high permeability 
in PAMPA (Pe equals 9.4) and high metabolic stability in HLMs as well as lack of 
significant interactions with isoforms of the CYP enzymes and lack of 
considerable cytotoxicity on selected cell lines (IC50 > 100 μM on HT-22 cells 
and 89.3 μM on BV-2 cells). Based on promising pharmacological activities and 
favorable ADME-tox properties, compound 36 may be considered a promising 
candidate for in vivo research as well as constitute a reliable starting point 
for further studies.

IMPORTANCE: Anti-β-amyloid immunotherapy using lecanemab is becoming 
increasingly available to patients with Alzheimer disease (AD). Individuals with 
Down syndrome (DS) develop AD neuropathology by age 40 years, representing a 
significant cohort of genetically determined AD.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the binding properties of lecanemab in the brains of 
people with DS, in anticipation of their inclusion in clinical trials or access 
to antiamyloid immunotherapies.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: The study included cases of postmortem brain 
tissue analysis from 15 individuals with DS aged 43 to 68 years that were 
acquired from Alzheimer Disease research centers at the University of 
California, Irvine and the University of Kentucky from 2008 to 2021. Data were 
analyzed from August 2023 through May 2024.
EXPOSURE: The binding properties of lecanemab were assessed in brain tissue.
MAIN OUTCOME: The primary outcome was the extent of lecanemab binding to amyloid 
plaques and brain blood vessels.
RESULTS: Tissue from 15 people (8 were female [53%]) with DS ranging in age from 
43 to 68 (mean, 56.6) years were included in the study. Lecanemab-labeled 
amyloid plaques appeared in all 15 DS cases studied, indicating potential target 
engagement. However, extensive binding of lecanemab to brain blood vessels in DS 
was observed, raising significant safety concerns. These findings underscore the 
necessity for clinical trials of lecanemab in people with DS to evaluate both 
safety and efficacy, particularly in individuals older than 43 years.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest significant binding of 
lecanemab to cerebral amyloid angiopathy in DS. Lecanemab should be rigorously 
tested in clinical trials for AD in the DS population to determine its safety 
and efficacy, especially in those older than 43 years.

Structural Reorganization Mechanism of the Aβ(42) Fibril Mediated by 
N-Substituted Oligopyrrolamide ADH-353.

The inhibition of amyloid-β (Aβ) fibrillation and clearance of Aβ aggregates 
have emerged as a potential pharmacological strategy to alleviate Aβ 
aggregate-induced neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Maity et al. 
shortlisted ADH-353 from a small library of positively charged N-substituted 
oligopyrrolamides for its notable ability to inhibit Aβ fibrillation, 
disintegrate intracellular cytotoxic Aβ oligomers, and alleviate Aβ-induced 
cytotoxicity in the SH-SY5Y and N2a cells. However, the molecular mechanism 
through which ADH-353 interacts with the Aβ42 fibrils, leading to their 
disruption and subsequent clearance, remains unclear. Thus, a detailed molecular 
mechanism underlying the disruption of neurotoxic Aβ42 fibrils (PDB ID 2NAO) by 
ADH-353 has been illuminated in this work using molecular dynamics simulations. 
Interestingly, conformational snapshots during simulation depicted the 
shortening and disappearance of β-strands and the emergence of a helix 
conformation, indicating a loss of the well-organized β-sheet-rich structure of 
the disease-relevant Aβ42 fibril on the incorporation of ADH-353. ADH-353 binds 
strongly to the Aβ42 fibril (ΔGbinding= -142.91 ± 1.61 kcal/mol) with a notable 
contribution from the electrostatic interactions between positively charged 
N-propylamine side chains of ADH-353 with the glutamic (Glu3, Glu11, and Glu22) 
and aspartic (Asp7 and Asp23) acid residues of the Aβ42 fibril. This aligns well 
with heteronuclear single quantum coherence NMR studies, which depict that the 
binding of ADH-353 with the Aβ peptide is driven by electrostatic and 
hydrophobic contacts. Furthermore, a noteworthy decrease in the binding affinity 
of Aβ42 fibril chains on the incorporation of ADH-353 indicates the weakening of 
interchain interactions leading to the disruption of the double-horseshoe 
conformation of the Aβ42 fibril. The illumination of key interactions 
responsible for the destabilization of the Aβ42 fibril by ADH-353 in this work 
will greatly aid in designing new chemical scaffolds with enhanced efficacy for 
the clearance of Aβ aggregates in AD.

Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterised by abnormal protein 
aggregates in the brain that lead to cognitive decline. While current therapies 
only treat symptoms, disease-modifying treatments are urgently needed. Studies 
suggest that the composition of the microbiota is altered in people with AD, 
suggesting a link between gut bacteria and AD-related brain changes.
SUMMARY: In our narrative review, we explore various microbial interventions, 
such as faecal microbiota transplantation, probiotics, and diet, as powerful 
potential treatments. Studies suggest changes in microbiota composition 
following these interventions, with some beneficial effects on cognitive 
function. However, the mechanism of action of these microbial interventions is 
still unknown.
KEY MESSAGE: Our aim was to highlight the importance of personalised approaches, 
taking into account individual metabolic and microbiome profiles. We try to 
address gaps in current research and emphasise the need for microbiota analysis 
at different stages of the disease and its integration with clinical parameters 
and lifestyle information for a comprehensive understanding of AD progression

One of the puzzling aspects of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) is how it 
commences. Changes in one key brain peptide, amyloid-beta (Aβ), accompany 
disease progression, but whether this comprises a trigger or a consequence of AD 
is still a topic of debate. It is clear however that the cerebral presence of 
oligomeric Aβ (1-42) is a key factor in early AD-pathogenesis. Furthermore, 
treatment of rodent brains with oligomeric Aβ (1-42) either in vitro or in vivo, 
acutely impairs hippocampal synaptic plasticity, creating a link between 
Aβ-pathology and learning impairments. Here, we show that a once-off inoculation 
of the brains of healthy adult rats with oligomeric Aβ (1-42) exerts 
debilitating effects on the long-term viability of the hippocampus, one of the 
primary targets of AD. Changes are progressive: months after treatment, synaptic 
plasticity, neuronal firing and spatial learning are impaired and expression of 
plasticity-related proteins are changed, in the absence of amyloid plaques. 
Early changes relate to activation of microglia, whereas later changes are 
associated with a reconstruction of astroglial morphology. These data suggest 
that a disruption of Aβ homeostasis may suffice to trigger an irreversible 
cascade, underlying progressive loss of hippocampal function, that parallels the 
early stages of AD.

Age-related neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer's disease (AD), are 
challenging diseases for those affected with no cure and limited treatment 
options. Functional, human derived brain tissues that represent the diverse 
genetic background and cellular subtypes contributing to sporadic AD (sAD) are 
limited. Human stem cell derived brain organoids recapitulate some features of 
human brain cytoarchitecture and AD-like pathology, providing a tool for 
illuminating the relationship between AD pathology and neural cell dysregulation 
leading to cognitive decline. In this review, we explore current strategies for 
implementing brain organoids in the study of AD as well as the challenges 
associated with investigating age-related brain diseases using organoid models.

Abnormalities in the transition between α-helices and β-sheets (α-β transition) 
may lead to devastating neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's syndrome 
and Alzheimer's disease. Ionic liquids (ILs) are potential drugs for targeted 
therapies against these diseases because of their excellent bioactivity and 
designability of ILs. However, the mechanism through which ILs regulate the α-β 
transition remains unclear. Herein, a combination of GPU-accelerated microsecond 
molecular dynamics simulations, correlation analysis, and machine learning was 
used to probe the dynamical α-β transition process induced by ILs of 
1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([C n mim]Cl) and its molecular mechanism. 
Interestingly, the cation of [C n mim]+ in ILs can spontaneously insert into the 
peptides as free ions (n ≤ 10) and clusters (n ≥ 11). Such insertion can 
significantly inhibit the α-β, transition and the inhibiting ability for the 
clusters is more significant than that of free ions, where [C10mim]+ and 
[C12mim]+ can reduce the maximum β-sheet content of the peptide by 18.5% and 
44.9%, respectively. Furthermore, the correlation analysis and machine learning 
method were used to develop a predictive model accounting for the influencing 
factors on the α-β transition, which could accurately predict the effect of ILs 
on the α-β transition. Overall, these quantitative results may not only deepen 
the understanding of the role of ILs in the α-β transition but also guide the 
development of the IL-based treatments for related diseases.

Neurodegenerative diseases are broadly hallmarked by impaired energy metabolism 
and toxic intracellular accumulations such as damaged organelles or reactive 
oxygen species (ROS). Gold nanoparticles readily cross the blood-brain barrier 
and increase nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide + hydrogen (NADH) oxidation to 
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), which is vital for intracellular 
energy generation, cellular repair, and protection from ROS. Thus, the use of 
gold nanoparticles to treat and potentially reverse cellular injury seen in 
neurodegenerative disease has been an area of ongoing research. This systematic 
review explores current literature regarding the use of gold nanoparticle 
therapy in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's 
disease, Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and multiple 
sclerosis (MS). In vitro studies of CNM-Au8 (Clene Nanomedicine, Salt Lake City, 
UT) have been shown to reduce TDP-43 aggregates associated with ALS. These 
studies also exhibited the neuroprotective effects of CNM-Au8 in rat primary 
neurons exposed to amyloid-beta peptides, which are associated with Alzheimer's 
disease. In animal models of MS, oral delivery of CNM-Au8 was demonstrated to 
produce robust and significant remyelination activity, oligodendrocyte 
maturation, and expression of myelin markers. In these same MS animal models, 
CNM-Au8 improved the motor function of cuprizone-treated mice in both open-field 
and kinematic gait studies. Recent phase II trials of CNM-Au8 in 13 patients 
with Parkinson's disease and 11 patients with stable relapsing MS demonstrated a 
statistically significant increase in the NAD+/NADH ratio across two cohorts. As 
the current data repeatedly suggest, these gold nanoparticles are efficacious 
for the treatment and reversal of symptoms across these varying 
neurodegenerative pathologies. Further opportunities exist for increasing human 
trials and eventually incorporating this new technology into existing treatment 
regimens.

Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the second most common subtype of stroke, 
characterized by high mortality and a poor prognosis. Despite various treatment 
methods, there has been limited improvement in the prognosis of ICH over the 
past decades. Therefore, it is imperative to identify a feasible treatment 
strategy for ICH. Mitochondria are organelles present in most eukaryotic cells 
and serve as the primary sites for aerobic respiration and energy production. 
Under unfavorable cellular conditions, mitochondria can induce changes in 
permeability through the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition 
pore (mPTP), ultimately leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and contributing to 
various diseases. Recent studies have demonstrated that mPTP plays a role in the 
pathological processes associated with several neurodegenerative diseases 
including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, 
ischemic stroke and ischemia-reperfusion injury, among others. However, there is 
limited research on mPTP involvement specifically in ICH. Therefore, this study 
comprehensively examines the pathological processes associated with mPTP in 
terms of oxidative stress, apoptosis, necrosis, autophagy, ferroptosis, and 
other related mechanisms to elucidate the potential mechanism underlying mPTP 
involvement in ICH. This research aims to provide novel insights for the 
treatment of secondary injury after ICH.

Pharmacological effects of Astragalus polysaccharides in treating 
neurodegenerative diseases.

Shi Y(1), Ma P(1).

Author information:
(1)School of Basic Medical, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, 
Chengdu, Sichuan, China.

Astragalus membranaceus widely used in traditional Chinese medicine, exhibits 
multiple pharmacological effects, including immune stimulation, antioxidation, 
hepatoprotection, diuresis, antidiabetes, anticancer, and expectorant 
properties. Its main bioactive compounds include flavonoids, triterpene 
saponins, and polysaccharides. Astragalus polysaccharides (APS), one of its 
primary bioactive components, have been shown to possess a variety of 
pharmacological activities, such as antioxidant, immunomodulatory, 
anti-inflammatory, antitumor, antidiabetic, antiviral, hepatoprotective, 
anti-atherosclerotic, hematopoietic, and neuroprotective effects. This review 
provides a comprehensive summary of the molecular mechanisms and therapeutic 
effects of APS in treating neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and multiple sclerosis (MS). It 
discusses how APS improve insulin resistance, reduce blood glucose levels, 
enhance cognitive function, and reduce Aβ accumulation and neuronal apoptosis by 
modulating various pathways such as Nrf2, JAK/STAT, Toll, and IMD. For PD, APS 
protect neurons and stabilize mitochondrial function by inhibiting ROS 
production and promoting autophagy through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. APS also 
reduce oxidative stress and neurotoxicity induced by 6-hydroxydopamine, 
showcasing their neuroprotective effects. In MS, APS alleviate symptoms by 
suppressing T cell proliferation and reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine 
expression via the PD-1/PD-Ls pathway. APS promote myelin regeneration by 
activating the Sonic hedgehog signaling pathway and fostering the 
differentiation of neural stem cells into oligodendrocytes. This article 
emphasizes the significant antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and 
neuroprotective pharmacological activities of APS, highlighting their potential 
as promising candidates for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

Aim: Individuals with Alzheimer disease (AD), Huntington disease (HD) and 
Parkinson disease (PD) have impaired balance, and comparing these deficits could 
improve management of neurological diseases.Methods: Scores on the Balance 
Evaluation Systems Test (BESTest) were compared across three groups, consisting 
of individuals with AD, HD and PD in early stages of their respective 
disease.Results: Individuals with PD had significantly higher scores on the 
BESTest than individuals with AD (95% CI [4.30, 21.37], p < 0.01) or HD (95% CI 
[6.53, 24.18], p < 0.001). Individuals with AD and HD were not significantly 
different on the overall BESTest or any of its subsections.Conclusion: AD and HD 
may have overlapping pathologies resulting in early and similar balance 
impairments in these groups.

Plain Language Summary: Balance impairment differs among individuals with 
Alzheimer disease, Huntington disease and Parkinson disease, with individuals 
with Parkinson disease demonstrating significantly better balance when compared 
in early stages of each disease.

Dysfunctional RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) have been implicated in several 
geriatric diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, little is known 
about the nuclear molecular actions and cooperative functions mediated by RBPs 
that affect gene regulation in sporadic AD or aging. In the present study, we 
investigated aging- and AD-associated changes in the expression of PSF and 
G3BP2, which are representative RBPs associated with sex hormone activity. We 
determined that both PSF and G3BP2 levels were decreased in aged brains compared 
to young brains of mice. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of human neuronal 
cells has shown that PSF is responsible for neuron-specific functions and 
sustains cell viability. In addition, we showed that PSF interacted with G3BP2 
in the nucleus and stress granules (SGs) at the protein level. Moreover, 
PSF-mediated gene regulation at the RNA level correlated with G3BP2. 
Interestingly, PSF and G3BP2 target genes are associated with AD development. 
Mechanistically, quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction 
(qRT-PCR) analysis demonstrated that the interaction of RBPs with the pre-mRNA 
of target genes enhanced post-transcriptional mRNA stability, suggesting a 
possible role for these RBPs in preserving neuronal cell viability. Notably, in 
the brains of patients with sporadic AD, decreased expression of PSF and G3BP2 
in neurons was observed compared to non-AD patients. Overall, our findings 
suggest that the cooperative action of PSF and G3BP2 in the nucleus is important 
for preventing aging and AD development.

Neuroinflammation is an important pathogenic mechanism in many neurodegenerative 
diseases, including those caused by frontotemporal lobar degeneration. 
Post-mortem and in vivo imaging studies have shown brain inflammation early in 
these conditions, proportional to symptom severity and rate of progression. 
However, evidence for corresponding blood markers of inflammation and their 
relationships to central inflammation and clinical outcome are limited. There is 
a pressing need for such scalable, accessible and mechanistically relevant blood 
markers because these will reduce the time, risk and costs of experimental 
medicine trials. We therefore assessed inflammatory patterns of serum cytokines 
from 214 patients with clinical syndromes associated with frontotemporal lobar 
degeneration in comparison to healthy controls, including their correlation with 
brain regional microglial activation and disease progression. Serum assays used 
the MesoScale Discovery V-Plex-Human Cytokine 36 plex panel plus five additional 
cytokine assays. A subgroup of patients underwent 11C-PK11195 mitochondrial 
translocator protein PET imaging, as an index of microglial activation. A 
principal component analysis was used to reduce the dimensionality of cytokine 
data, excluding cytokines that were undetectable in >50% of participants. 
Frequentist and Bayesian analyses were performed on the principal components to 
compare each patient cohort with controls and test for associations with central 
inflammation, neurodegeneration-related plasma markers and survival. The first 
component identified by the principal component analysis (explaining 21.5% 
variance) was strongly loaded by pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, 
TNF-R1, M-CSF, IL-17A, IL-12, IP-10 and IL-6. Individual scores of the component 
showed significant differences between each patient cohort and controls. The 
degree to which a patient expressed this peripheral inflammatory profile at 
baseline was correlated negatively with survival (higher inflammation, shorter 
survival), even when correcting for baseline clinical severity. Higher 
pro-inflammatory profile scores were associated with higher microglial 
activation in frontal and brainstem regions, as quantified with 11C-PK11195 
mitochondrial translocator protein PET. A permutation-based canonical 
correlation analysis confirmed the association between the same cytokine-derived 
pattern and central inflammation across brain regions in a fully data-based 
manner. This data-driven approach identified a pro-inflammatory profile across 
the frontotemporal lobar degeneration clinical spectrum, which is associated 
with central neuroinflammation and worse clinical outcome. Blood-based markers 
of inflammation could increase the scalability and access to neuroinflammatory 
assessment of people with dementia, to facilitate clinical trials and 
experimental medicine studies.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease 
characterized by abnormal accumulation of tau proteins and amyloid-β, leading to 
neuronal death and cognitive impairment. Recent studies have implicated aging 
pathways, including dysregulation of tau and cellular senescence in AD 
pathogenesis. In AD brains, tau protein, which normally stabilizes microtubules, 
becomes hyperphosphorylated and forms insoluble neurofibrillary tangles. These 
tau aggregates impair neuronal function and are propagated across the brain's 
neurocircuitry. Meanwhile, the number of senescent cells accumulating in the 
aging brain is rising, releasing a pro-inflammatory SASP responsible for 
neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. This review explores potential 
therapeutic interventions for AD targeting tau protein and senescent cells, and 
tau -directed compounds, senolytics, eliminating senescent cells, and agents 
that modulate the SASP-senomodulators. Ultimately, a combined approach that 
incorporates tau-directed medications and targeted senescent cell-based 
therapies holds promise for reducing the harmful impact of AD's shared aging 
pathways.

Sleep is established as an essential physiological need that impacts physical, 
emotional, and cognitive functions profoundly. Physiologically, inadequate sleep 
weakens immune function, heightening susceptibility to infections and chronic 
illnesses such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Hormonal 
disruptions due to sleep loss further exacerbate metabolic dysregulation, 
contributing to weight gain and other health complications. Emotionally, sleep 
deprivation leads to mood disturbances, including increased irritability, 
heightened stress responses, and a greater likelihood of mood disorders like 
depression and anxiety. These effects are compounded by cognitive impairments 
such as reduced alertness, impaired memory consolidation, and compromised 
decision-making abilities, akin to the impairments caused by alcohol 
consumption. Motor skills and coordination also suffer, elevating the risk of 
accidents, particularly in high-stress environments. For older adults, sleep 
quality is closely linked to cognitive function and overall longevity. Optimal 
sleep patterns are associated with slower brain aging and improved health 
outcomes. However, sleep disorders exacerbate existing conditions such as 
epilepsy and asthma, necessitating interventions like cognitive behavioral 
therapy (CBT) and medications such as melatonin to mitigate their impact. 
Education emerges as a crucial tool in promoting healthier sleep habits across 
all age groups. Addressing misconceptions about sleep and integrating sleep 
health into public health policies are essential steps toward improving overall 
well-being. Additionally, lifestyle factors such as diet and physical activity 
play significant roles in regulating sleep patterns, further emphasizing the 
interconnectedness of sleep with broader health outcomes. In summary, the 
articles underscore the intricate mechanisms through which sleep influences 
physiological functions and advocate for comprehensive approaches to enhance 
sleep hygiene and mitigate the adverse effects of sleep deprivation on human 
health.

MiRNAs are short non-coding RNA molecules that have been shown to affect a vast 
number of genes at the post-transcriptional level, hence regulating several 
signaling pathways. Because the miRNA-34 family regulates a number of different 
signaling pathways, including those linked to cancer, the immune system, 
metabolism, cellular structure, and neurological disorders, it has garnered a 
great deal of attention from researchers. Members of the miRNA-34 family have 
been shown to inhibit tumors in a variety of cancer types. This family is also 
important for obesity, the cardiovascular system, and glycolysis. It's 
interesting to note that the miRNA-34 family is known to play a role in major 
depressive disorder, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease (PD), adverse childhood 
experiences or trauma, regulation of stress responses, Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
and stress-related psychatric conditions. In this review, the expected targets 
of the miRNA-34 family are presented alongside the well-established targets 
identified by pathway analysis. Furthermore, the therapeutic potential of this 
miRNA family will be discussed.

Dementia-related neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), including Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), are known to be caused by accumulation of toxic proteins. However, 
the molecular mechanisms that cause neurodegeneration and its biophysical 
effects on cells remain unclear. In this study, we used juvenile neuronal ceroid 
lipofuscinosis (JNCL), a pediatric dementia with a clear etiology of mutations 
in ceroid lipofuscinosis neuronal 3 (CLN3), to explore the changes in cell 
adhesion, a biophysical process that regulates neuronal development and 
survival. We used JNCL cerebral organoid gene expression datasets to identify 
the biological pathways that affect neural development, and found enriched gene 
expression in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway and increased 
expression of its inducer snail family transcriptional repressor 2 (SNAI2). A 
cell adhesion assay using lymphoblasts from patients with JNCL revealed 
defective adhesion to cell culture plates, glass surfaces, collagen type I, and 
neuroblast-like cells. To determine whether inhibition of EMT could improve the 
cell adhesion of JNCL lymphoblasts, we used all-trans retinoic acid, a 
well-known EMT inhibitor and inducer of neural differentiation. In JNCL 
lymphoblasts, ATRA treatment enhanced adhesion to collagen type I and these 
effects were abolished by Ca2+ chelator. These results provide new insights into 
the role of CLN3 and cell adhesion in the pathogenesis of NDD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most debilitating age-related disorders 
that affect people globally. It impacts social and cognitive behavior of the 
individual and is characterized by phosphorylated tau and Aβ accumulation. 
Astrocytesmaintain a quiescent, anti-inflammatory state on anatomical level, 
expressing few cytokines and exhibit phagocytic activity to remove misfolded 
proteins. But in AD, in response to specific stimuli, astrocytes overstimulate 
their phagocytic character with overexpressing cytokine gene modules. Upon 
interaction with generated Aβ and neurofibrillary tangle, astrocytes that are 
continuously activated release a large number of inflammatory cytokines. This 
cytokine storm leads to neuroinflammation which is also one of the recognizable 
features of AD. Astrogliosis eventually promotes cholinergic dysfunction, 
calcium imbalance, oxidative stress and excitotoxicity. Furthermore, C5aR1, 
Lcn2/, BDNF/TrkB and PPARα/TFEB signaling dysregulation has a major impact on 
the disease progression. This review clarifies numerous ways that lead to 
astrogliosis, which is stimulated by a variety of processes that exacerbate AD 
pathology and make it a suitable target for AD treatment. Drugs under clinical 
and preclinical investigations that target several pathways managing 
astrogliosis and are efficacious in ameliorating the pathology of the disease 
are also included in this study. D-ALA2GIP, TRAM-34, Genistein, L-serine, MW150 
and XPro1595 are examples of few drugs targeting astrogliosis. Therefore, this 
study may aid in the development of a potent therapeutic agent for ameliorating 
astrogliosis mediated AD progression.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with a projected 
significant increase in incidence. Therefore, this study analyzed single-nucleus 
AD data to provide a theoretical basis for the clinical development and 
treatment of AD. We downloaded AD-related monocyte data from the Gene Expression 
Omnibus database, annotated cells, compared cell abundance between groups, and 
investigated glial and neuronal cell biological processes and pathways through 
functional enrichment analysis. Furthermore, we constructed a global regulatory 
network for AD based on cell communication and ecological analyses. Our findings 
revealed increased abundance of Capping Protein Regulator And Myosin 1 linker 1 
(CARMIL1)+ astrocytes (AST), Immunoglobulin Superfamily Member 21 (IGSF21)+ 
microglia (MIC), SRY-Box Transcription Factor 6 (SOX6)+ inhibitory neurons 
(InNeu), and laminin alpha-2 chain (LAMA2)+ oligodendrocytes (OLI) cell 
subgroups in tissues of patients with AD, while prostaglandin D2 synthase 
(PTGDS)+ AST, Src Family Tyrosine Kinase (FYN)+ MIC, and Proteolipid Protein 1 
(PLP1)+ InNeu subgroups specifically decreased. We found that the cell phenotype 
of patients with AD shifted from a simpler to a more complex state compared to 
the control group. Cell communication analysis revealed strong communication 
between MIC and NEU. Furthermore, AST, MIC, NEU, and OLI were involved in 
oxidative stress- and inflammation-related pathways, potentially contributing to 
disease development. This study provides a theoretical basis for further 
exploring the specific mechanisms underlying AD.

Klotho is recognized as an aging-suppressor protein that is implicated in a 
variety of processes and signaling pathways. The anti-inflammatory, 
anti-apoptotic, anti-oxidant, and anti-tumor bioactivities of klotho have 
extended its application in neurosciences and made the protein popular for its 
lifespan-extending capacity. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that klotho 
levels would reduce with aging and numerous pathologies, particularly those 
related to the central nervous system (CNS). Evidence supports the idea that 
klotho can be a key therapeutic target in CNS diseases such as amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, stroke, and Alzheimer's disease. 
Reviewing the literature suggests that the upregulation of klotho expression 
regulates various signaling pathways related to autophagy, oxidative stress, 
inflammation, cognition, and ferroptosis in neurological disorders. Therefore, 
it has been of great interest to develop drugs or agents that boost or restore 
klotho levels. In this regard, the present review was designed and aimed to 
gather the delegated documents regarding the therapeutic potential of Klotho in 
CNS diseases focusing on the molecular and cellular mechanisms.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating, age-associated neurodegenerative 
disorder and the most common cause of dementia. The clinical continuum of AD 
spans from preclinical disease to subjective cognitive decline, mild cognitive 
impairment, and dementia stages (mild, moderate, and severe). 
Neuropathologically, AD is defined by the accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) into 
extracellular plaques in the brain parenchyma and in the cerebral vasculature, 
and by abnormally phosphorylated tau that accumulates intraneuronally forming 
neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Development of treatment approaches that prevent 
or even reduce the cognitive decline because of AD has been slow compared to 
other major causes of death. Recently, the United States Food and Drug 
Administration gave full approval to 2 different Aβ-targeting monoclonal 
antibodies. However, this breakthrough disease modifying approach only applies 
to a limited subset of patients in the AD continuum and there are stringent 
eligibility criteria. Furthermore, these approaches do not prevent progression 
of disease, because other AD-related pathologies, such as NFTs, are not directly 
targeted. A non-mutually exclusive alternative is to address lifestyle 
interventions that can help reduce the risk of AD and AD-related dementias 
(ADRD). It is estimated that addressing such modifiable risk factors could 
potentially delay up to 40% of AD/ADRD cases. In this review, we discuss some of 
the many modifiable risk factors that may be associated with prevention of 
AD/ADRD and/or increasing brain resilience, as well as other factors that may 
interact with these modifiable risk factors to influence AD/ADRD progression.

    medRxiv. 2024 Jan 30:2023.12.28.23300612. doi: 10.1101/2023.12.28.23300612.

BACKGROUND: Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a rare neurodegenerative 
disease characterized by the accumulation of aggregated tau proteins in 
astrocytes, neurons, and oligodendrocytes. Previous genome-wide association 
studies for PSP were based on genotype array, therefore, were inadequate for the 
analysis of rare variants as well as larger mutations, such as small 
insertions/deletions (indels) and structural variants (SVs).
METHOD: In this study, we performed whole genome sequencing (WGS) and conducted 
association analysis for single nucleotide variants (SNVs), indels, and SVs, in 
a cohort of 1,718 cases and 2,944 controls of European ancestry. Of the 1,718 
PSP individuals, 1,441 were autopsy-confirmed and 277 were clinically diagnosed.
RESULTS: Our analysis of common SNVs and indels confirmed known genetic loci at 
MAPT, MOBP, STX6, SLCO1A2, DUSP10, and SP1, and further uncovered novel signals 
in APOE, FCHO1/MAP1S, KIF13A, TRIM24, TNXB, and ELOVL1. Notably, in contrast to 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), we observed the APOE ε2 allele to be the risk allele 
in PSP. Analysis of rare SNVs and indels identified significant association in 
ZNF592 and further gene network analysis identified a module of neuronal genes 
dysregulated in PSP. Moreover, seven common SVs associated with PSP were 
observed in the H1/H2 haplotype region (17q21.31) and other loci, including IGH, 
PCMT1, CYP2A13, and SMCP. In the H1/H2 haplotype region, there is a burden of 
rare deletions and duplications (P = 6.73 × 10-3) in PSP.
CONCLUSIONS: Through WGS, we significantly enhanced our understanding of the 
genetic basis of PSP, providing new targets for exploring disease mechanisms and 
therapeutic interventions.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by cognitive impairments. Despite the limited efficacy of current 
treatments for AD, the 1,2,4-oxadiazole structure has garnered significant 
attention in medicinal chemistry due to its potential impact on mGluR1 and its 
association with AD therapy. In this study, a series of novel 1,2,4-oxadiazole 
derivatives were designed, synthesized, and evaluated for the neuroprotective 
effects in human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells. Among all the derivatives 
tested, FO-4-15 (5f) existed the lowest cytotoxicity and the highest protective 
effect against H2O2. Based on these in vitro results, FO-4-15 was administered 
to 3×Tg mice and significantly improved the cognitive impairments of the AD 
mice. Pathological analysis showed that FO-4-15 significantly reduced Aβ 
accumulation, Tau hyper-phosphorylation, and synaptic impairments in the 3×Tg 
mice. Dysfunction of the CaMKIIα/Fos signaling pathway in 3×Tg mice was found to 
be restored by FO-4-15 and the necessity of the CaMKIIα/Fos for FO-4-15 was 
subsequently confirmed by the use of a CaMKIIα inhibitor in vitro. Beyond that, 
mGluR1 was identified to be a potential target of FO-4-15, and the interaction 
of FO-4-15 and mGluR1 was displayed by Ca2+ flow increase, molecular docking, 
and interaction energy analysis. The target of FO-4-15 was further confirmed in 
vitro by JNJ16259685, a nonselective inhibitor of mGluR1. These findings suggest 
that FO-4-15 may hold promise as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is clinically heterogeneous, which suggests the 
existence of subtypes; however, there has been no consensus regarding their 
characteristics. This study included 633 PD individuals across distinct cohorts: 
unmedicated de novo PD, medicated PD, mild-moderate PD, and a cohort based on 
diagnostic work-up in clinical practice. Additionally, 233 controls were 
included. Clustering based on cortical and subcortical gray matter measures was 
conducted with and without adjusting for global atrophy in the entire PD sample 
and validated within each cohort. Subtypes were characterized using baseline and 
longitudinal demographic and clinical data. Unadjusted results identified three 
clusters showing a gradient of neurodegeneration and symptom severity across the 
entire sample and the individual cohorts. When adjusting for global atrophy 
eight clusters were identified in the entire sample, lacking consistency in 
individual cohorts. This study identified atrophy-based subtypes in PD, 
emphasizing the significant impact of global atrophy on subtype number, 
patterns, and interpretation in cross-sectional analyses.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease and other dementias (ADODs) severely threaten 
the wellbeing of older people, their families, and communities, especially with 
projected exponential growth. Understanding the macroeconomic implications of 
ADODs for policy making is essential but under-researched.
METHODS: We used a health-augmented macroeconomic model to calculate the 
macroeconomic burden of ADODs for 152 countries or territories, accounting for: 
the effect on labour supply of reduced working hours of informal caregivers; the 
effect on labour supply of ADODs-related mortality and morbidity; 
age-sex-specific differences in education, work experience, labour market 
participations, and informal caregivers; and treatment and formal care costs 
diverting from savings and investments.
FINDINGS: ADODs will cost the world economy 14 513 billion international dollars 
(INT$, measured in the base year 2020; 95% uncertainty interval [UI] 
12 106-17 778) from 2020 to 2050, equivalent to 0·421% (95% UI 0·351-0·515) of 
annual global GDP. Japan incurs the largest annual GDP loss at 1·463% 
(1·225-1·790). China (INT$2961 billion [2507-3564]), the USA (INT$2331 billion 
[1989-2829]), and Japan (INT$1758 billion [1471-2150]) face the largest absolute 
economic burdens. The economic burden of informal care ranges from 60·97% in 
high-income countries to 85·45% in lower-middle-income countries, and treatment 
and formal care costs range from 10·50% in lower-middle-income countries to 
30·80% in high-income countries.
INTERPRETATION: The macroeconomic burden of ADODs is substantial and unequally 
distributed across countries and regions. Global efforts to reduce the burden, 
especially with regard to informal care, are urgently needed.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder 
associated with the amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau hallmarks. The molecular insights 
into how neuroinflammation is initially triggered and how it affects neuronal 
cells are yet at the age of infancy. In this study, SH-SY5Y cells were used as a 
model for neurons by differentiating and were co-cultured with differentiated 
THP1 cells (microglia model) as well as treated with Aβ(25-35) and with 
antioxidant FA to study inflammatory, oxidative stress responses and their 
effects on co-cultured neurons. Neurons co-cultured with microglial cells showed 
pronounced increase in ROS levels, NOS expression, truncated N-terminal form 
(34 kDa) of APE1 expression and AIF's translocation in the nucleus. The 
pre-treatment of FA, on the other hand reversed these effects. It was further 
evaluated how FA/Aβ treatment altered microglial phenotype that in turn affected 
the neurons. Microglial cells showed M1 phenotype upon Aβ(25-35) stress, while 
FA induced M2 phenotype against Aβ stress, suggesting that FA alleviated Aβ 
induced phenotype and its associated effects in the co-cultured neurons by 
altering the phenotype of microglial cells and induced expression of full length 
(37 kDa) APE1 enzyme and inhibiting AIF's nuclear translocation, thus inhibiting 
apoptosis. This is the first study that revealed Aβ induced cleavage of APE1 
enzyme in differentiated neurons, suggesting that APE1 may be the potential 
early target of Aβ that loses its function and exacerbates AD pathology. FA 
activated a fully functional form of APE1 against Aβ stress. The impaired 
function of APE1 could be the initial mechanism by which Aβ induces oxidative 
and inflammatory responses and dietary phytochemical FA can be a potential 
therapeutic strategy in managing the disease by activating APE1 that not only 
repairs oxidative DNA base damage but also maintains mitochondrial function and 
alleviates neuroinflammatory responses.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The Chinese formula Guben-Jiannao Ye (GBJNY) 
formula has a long history of usage in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for 
the treatment of learning and memory disorders as well as senile insomnia. This 
formulation is derived from Sun Simiao's five tonic pills. Furthermore, modern 
pharmacological investigations have revealed its ability to improve cognitive 
impairment and ameliorate sleep-wake circadian rhythm disorders. However, the 
precise mechanism underlying its efficacy remains elusive.
AIM OF THE STUDY: The current research explored the modulatory effects and 
possible mechanisms of GBJNY in circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders and 
cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease using transcriptome sequencing and 
experimental validation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The LC-MS/MS tandem technology was utilized to 
qualitatively discern the active components present in GBJNY. The APP/PS1 mice 
received continuous treatment with GBJNY or Melatonin for 3 months. The learning 
and memory abilities of mice were assessed utilizing the Morris water maze (MWM) 
test, while sleep changes were studied utilizing the electroencephalogram (EEG) 
and electromyogram (EMG). Concurrently, mice's hippocampus clock gene 
rhythmicity was investigated. Subsequently, we employed HE staining, Golgi 
staining, and immunofluorescence to observe GBJNY's impact on synaptic damage 
and neuronal loss. We performed high-throughput sequencing to analyze the mRNA 
expression profiles of mice, aiming to identify differentially expressed genes 
(DEGs). Subsequently, we conducted GO and KEGG enrichment analyses to explore 
associated signaling pathways. Furthermore, we evaluated the expression levels 
of proteins involved in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and Aβ deposition in the 
hippocampus of mice. Through this comprehensive approach, we sought to elucidate 
and validate the potential mechanisms of action of GBJNY in APP/PS1 mice.
RESULTS: Results showed 216 DEGs. Following this, we conducted GO enrichment and 
KEGG pathway analyses to delve deeper into the distinctions and fundamental 
functions of the mRNA target genes. The enrichment analysis underscored the 
prominence of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway as the most pivotal among 
them. Through in vivo experiments, it was further demonstrated that the 
administration of GBJNY enhanced memory and learning capacities in APP/PS1 mice. 
Additionally, GBJNY treatment resulted in alterations in the sleep-wake 
circadian rhythm, characterized by reduced wakefulness and an increase in 
non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Moreover, alterations in the peak 
expression of Per1, Per2, Clock, Cry1, Cry2, and Bmal1 mRNA were noted in the 
hippocampus of treated mice. Particularly noteworthy were the observed 
reductions in amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition within the hippocampus, improvements 
in neuronal synaptic integrity, and upregulation of mTOR, Akt, and PI3K protein 
expression in the hippocampal region. These findings underscore the critical 
involvement of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in mitigating disturbances in 
sleep-wake circadian rhythms.
CONCLUSIONS: GBJNY enhanced the cognitive performance of APP/PS1 mice and 
altered clock gene expression patterns, alleviating sleep-wake circadian rhythm 
disruptions. The fundamental mechanism appears to be linked to the PI3K/Akt/mTOR 
pathway regulation, offering a foundation for potential clinical applications.

Amyloid plaque formation in the brain is mainly responsible for the onset of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Structure-based peptides have gained importance in 
recent years, and rational design of the peptide sequences for the prevention of 
Aβ-aggregation and related toxicity is imperative. In this study, we investigate 
the structural modification of tetrapeptides derived from the hydrophobic 
C-terminal region of Aβ42 "VVIA-NH2" and its retro-sequence "AIVV-NH2." A 
preliminary screening of synthesized peptides through an MTT cell viability 
assay followed by a ThT fluorescence assay revealed a peptide 13 
(Ala-Ile-Aib-Val-NH2) that showed protection against Aβ-aggregation and 
associated neurotoxicity. The presence of the α-helix inducer "Aib" in peptide 
13 manifested the conformational transition from cross-β-sheets to α-helical 
content in Aβ42. The absence of fibrils in electron microscopic analysis 
suggested the inhibitory potential of peptide 13. The HRMS, DLS, and ANS studies 
further confirmed the inhibitory activity of 13, and no cytotoxicity was 
observed. The structure-based peptide described herein is a promising amyloid-β 
inhibitor and provides a new lead for the development of AD therapeutics.

Alzheimer's disease is age-related multifactorial neurodegenerative disease 
manifested by gradual loss of memory, cognitive decline and changes in 
personality. Due to rapid and continuous growth of its prevalence, the treatment 
of Alzheimer's disease calls for development of new and efficacies drugs, 
especially those that could be able to simultaneously act on more than one of 
possible targets of action. Aminoquinolines have proven to be a highly promising 
structural scaffold in the design of such a drug as cholinesterases and 
β-secretase 1 inhibitors. In this study, we synthesised twenty-two new 
4-aminoquinolines with different halogen atom and its position in the terminal 
N-benzyl group or with a trifluoromethyl or a chlorine as C(7)-substituents on 
the quinoline moiety. All compounds were evaluated as 
multi-target-directedligands by determining their inhibition potency towards 
human acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase and β-secretase 1. All of the 
tested derivatives were very potent inhibitors of human acetylcholinesterase and 
butyrylcholinesterase with inhibition constants (Ki) in the nM to low μM range. 
Most were estimated to be able to cross the blood-brain barrier by passive 
transport and were nontoxic toward cells that represented the main models of 
individual organs.

BACKGROUND: Dementia prevalence is expected to increase as populations grow and 
age. Therefore, additional resources will be needed to meet the global demand 
for care for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD).
OBJECTIVE: Estimate global and country-level health care spending attributable 
to ADRD and the cost of informal care for people living with ADRD.
METHODS: We gathered data from three systematic literature reviews and the 
Global Burden of Disease 2019 study. We used spatiotemporal Gaussian process 
regression to impute estimates for the many countries without underlying data. 
We projected future costs to 2050 based on past trends in costs, diagnosis 
rates, and institutionalization rate.
RESULTS: We estimated that in 2019, the direct health care spending attributable 
to ADRD across 204 countries reached $260.6 billion (95% uncertainty interval 
[UI] 131.6-420.4) and the cost of informal ADRD care was $354.1 billion (95% UI 
190.0-544.1). On average, informal care represents 57% (95% UI 38-75%) of the 
total cost of care. We estimated that direct health care spending attributable 
to ADRD will reach $1.6 trillion (95% UI 0.6-3.3) in 2050, or 9.4% (95% UI 
3.9-19.6%) of projected health spending worldwide. We estimated the cost of 
informal care will reach $0.9 trillion (95% UI 0.3-1.7) in 2050.
CONCLUSIONS: These cost estimates underscore the magnitude of resources needed 
to ensure sufficient resources for people living with ADRD and highlight the 
role that informal care plays in provision of their care. Incorporating informal 
care cost estimates is critical to capture the social cost of ADRD.
